Preface
We love economics. We marvel at the way economic systems work. When we buy a smart-
phone, we think about the complex supply chain and the hundreds of thousands of people 
who played a role in producing an awe-inspiring piece of technology that was assembled 
from components manufactured across the globe.
The market’s ability to do the world’s work without anyone being in charge strikes 
us as a phenomenon no less profound than the existence of consciousness or life itself. 
We believe that the creation of the market system is one of the greatest achievements of 
humankind.
We wrote this book to highlight the simplicity of economic ideas and their extraordinary 
power to explain, predict, and improve what happens in the world. We want students to 
master the essential principles of economic analysis. With that goal in mind, we identify 
the three key ideas that lie at the heart of the economic approach to understanding human 
behavior: optimization, equilibrium, and empiricism. These abstract words represent three 
ideas that are actually highly intuitive.
Our Vision: Three Unifying 
Themes
The first key principle is that people try to choose the best available option: optimization. 
We don’t assume that people always successfully optimize, but we do believe that people 
try to optimize and often do a relatively good job of it. Because most decision makers try 
to choose the alternative that offers the greatest net benefit, optimization is a useful tool 
for predicting human behavior. Optimization is also a useful prescriptive tool. By teaching 
people how to optimize, we improve their decisions and the quality of their lives. By the 
end of this course, every student should be a skilled optimizer—without using complicated 
mathematics, simply by using economic intuition.
The second key principle extends the first: economic systems operate in equilibrium, a 
state in which everybody is simultaneously trying to optimize. We want students to see that 
they’re not the only ones maximizing their well-being. An economic system is in equilib-
rium when each person feels that he or she cannot do any better by picking another course 
of action. The principle of equilibrium highlights the connections among economic actors. 
For example, Apple stores stock millions of iPhones because millions of consumers are 
going to turn up to buy them. In turn, millions of consumers go to Apple stores because 
those stores are ready to sell those iPhones. In equilibrium, consumers and producers are 
simultaneously optimizing and their behaviors are intertwined.
Our first two principles—optimization and equilibrium—are conceptual. The third is 
methodological: empiricism. Economists use data to test economic theories, learn about 
the world, and speak to policymakers. Accordingly, data play a starring role in our book, 
though we keep the empirical analysis extremely simple. It is this emphasis on matching 
theories with real data that we think most distinguishes our book from others. We show 
students how economists use data to answer specific questions, which makes our chapters 
concrete, interesting, and fun. Modern students demand the evidence behind the theory, 
and our book supplies it.
For example, we begin every chapter with an empirical question and then answer that 
question using data. One chapter begins by asking:
Would a smoker quit the habit for $100 a month?

Preface
Later in that chapter, we describe how smoking fell when researchers paid smokers to quit. 
Another chapter opens with the question
Why are you so much more prosperous than your great-great-grandparents were?
Later in that chapter, we demonstrate the central role played by technology in explaining U.S. 
economic growth and why we are much better off than our relatives a few generations ago.
In our experience, students taking their first economics class often have the impression 
that economics is a series of theoretical assertions with little empirical basis. By using data, 
we explain how economists evaluate and improve our scientific insights. Data also make 
concepts more memorable. Using evidence helps students build intuition, ­because data 
move the conversation from abstract principles to concrete facts. Every chapter sheds light 
on how economists use data to answer questions that directly interest students. ­Every chap-
ter demonstrates the key role that evidence plays in advancing the science of economics.
Features
All of our features showcase intuitive empirical questions.
•	 In Evidence-Based Economics (EBE), we show how economists use data to answer 
the question we pose in the opening paragraph of the chapter. The EBE uses actual 
data that highlights some of the major concepts discussed within the chapter. This 
tie-in with the data gives students a substantive look at economics as it plays out in 
the world around them.
The questions explored aren’t just dry intellectual ideas; they spring to life the min-
ute the student sets foot outside the classroom—Is Facebook free? Is college worth 
it? Will free trade cause you to lose your job? Is there value in putting yourself into 
someone else’s shoes? Are tropical and semitropical areas condemned to poverty by 
their geographies? What caused the recession of 2007–2009? Are companies like Nike 
harming workers in Vietnam?
 Evidence-Based Economics 
 T
 he theoretical discussion in the previous section supports the central role of tech-
nology in explaining sustained growth. We will now see that empirical evidence 
also bolsters the conclusion that technology plays a key role. 
 To evaluate the sources of U.S. economic growth, we follow the  same strategy  as in 
the previous chapter. There, we used  the aggregate production function and estimates of 
the physical capital stock and the efficiency units of labor across different countries to 
 evaluate  their contributions to cross-country differences in GDP. The only major differ-
ence here is that higher-quality U.S. data enable us to conduct the analysis for GDP per

•	 In keeping with the optimization theme, from time to time we ask students to make a 
real economic decision or evaluate the consequences of past real decisions in a ­feature 
entitled Choice & Consequence. We explain how an economist might ­analyze 
the same decision. Among the choices investigated are such questions and concepts 
as the unintended consequences of fixing market prices, the tragedy of the commons, 
signaling, the power of growth, foreign aid and corruption, and policies that address 
the problem of banks that are “too big to fail.”
 Life expectancy around the world was much lower 70 years 
ago than it is today.  4  In 1940, child and infant mortality 
rates were so high and adult diseases, such as pneumonia 
and tuberculosis, were so deadly (and without any cure) 
that life expectancy at birth in many nations stood at less 
than 40 years. For example, the life expectancy at birth 
of an average Indian was an incredibly low 30 years. In 
Venezuela, it was 33; in Indonesia, 34; in  Brazil, 36. Life 
expectancy at birth in many Western nations was also low 
but still considerably higher than the corresponding num-
bers in the poorer nations. Consider that life expectancy 
at birth in the United States was 64 years. 
 In the course of the next three or four decades, this 
picture changed dramatically.  As we saw in the previous 
chapter, w hile the gap in life expectancy between rich 
and poor nations still remains today, health conditions 
have improved significantly all over the world, particularly 
before the spread of the AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan 
Africa starting in the 1980s. Life expectancy at birth in 
India in 1999 was 60 years. This was twice as large as the 
same number in 1940. It was also 50 percent higher than 
life expectancy at birth in Britain in 1820 (40 years), which 
had approximately the same GDP per capita as India in 
1999. How did this tremendous improvement in health 
conditions in poor nations take place? 
 The answer lies in scientific breakthroughs and innova-
tions that took place in the United States and Western 
Europe throughout the twentieth century. First, there 
was a wave of global drug innovation, most importantly 
the development of antibiotics, which produced many 
products that were highly effective against major killers 
in  developing countries. Penicillin, which provided an ef-
fective treatment against a range of bacterial infections, 
 became widely available by the early 1950s. Also impor-
tant during the same period was the development of new 
vaccines, including ones against yellow fever and smallpox. 
 The second major factor was the discovery of DDT 
 (Dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethylene). Although eventually 
the excess use of DDT as an agricultural pesticide would 
turn out to be an environmental hazard, its initial use in 
disease control was revolutionary. DDT allowed a break-
through in attempts to control one of the major killers of 
children in relatively poor parts of the world—malaria. 
 Finally, with the establishment and help of the World Health 
Organization (WHO), simple but effective medical and 
public health practices, such as oral rehydration and boil-
ing water to prevent cholera, spread to poorer countries. 
 LETTING THE DATA SPEAK 
 Life Expectancy and Innovation 
 
•	 Letting the Data Speak is another feature that analyzes an economic question 
by using real data as the foundation of the discussion. Among the many issues we 
explore are such topics as McDonald’s and elasticity, fair trade, airline price wars, 
life expectancy and innovation, living in an interconnected world, and why Chinese 
authorities have historically kept the yuan undervalued.

Preface
Organization
Part I Introduction to Economics lays the groundwork for understanding the economic 
way of thinking about the world. In Chapter 1, we show that the principle of optimization 
explains most of our choices. In other words, we make choices based on a consideration 
of benefits and costs, and to do this we need to consider trade-offs, budget constraints, and 
opportunity cost. We then explain that equilibrium is the situation in which everyone is 
simultaneously trying to individually optimize. In equilibrium, there isn’t any perceived 
benefit to changing one’s own behavior. We introduce the free-rider problem to show that 
individual optimization and social optimization do not necessarily coincide.
Because data plays such a central role in economics, we devote an entire chapter—
Chapter 2—to economic models, the scientific method, empirical testing, and the critical 
distinction between correlation and causation. We show how economists use models and 
data to answer interesting questions about human behavior. For the students who want to 
brush up their graphical skills, there is an appendix on constructing and interpreting graphs, 
which is presented in the context of an actual experiment on incentive schemes.
Chapter 3 digs much more deeply into the concept of optimization, including an in-
tuitive discussion of marginal analysis. We use a single running example of choosing an 
apartment, which confronts students with a trade-off between the cost of rent and the time 
spent commuting. We demonstrate two alternative approaches—optimization in levels and 
optimization in differences—and show why economists often use the latter (marginal) 
technique.
Chapter 4 introduces the demand and supply framework via a running example of the 
market for gasoline. We show how the price of gasoline affects the decisions of buyers, 
like commuters, and sellers, like ExxonMobil. As we develop the model, we explore how 
individual buyers are added together to produce a market demand curve and how individual 
sellers are added together to generate a market supply curve. We then show how buyers 
and sellers jointly determine the equilibrium market price and the equilibrium quantity of 
goods transacted in a perfectly competitive market. Finally, we show how markets break 
down when prices aren’t allowed to adjust to equate the quantity demanded and the quan-
tity supplied.
Part II Foundations of Microeconomics anchors Micro with a deeper exploration of the 
sources of demand and supply. One important thing that we have learned as teachers is that 
even after a year of economics, most students really have no idea about the underpinnings 
of the demand and supply curves—specifically, where the curves actually come from. Most 
textbooks do not illuminate these issues.
When crafting Chapters 5 and 6, our goal was to provide two stand-alone chapters that 
show students that consumption and production are really two sides of the same coin, 
“glued” together by the idea of incentives. We gather consumer and producer concepts 
under their own respective umbrellas, and merge material that is spread out over several 
chapters in other texts. The goal is to show the commonalities and linkages between con-
sumers’ and producers’ optimization decisions. With this setup, the student is able to view 
the whole picture in one place and understand how concepts tie together without flipping 
back and forth between several chapters.
In Chapter 5, we look “under the hood” to show where the demand curve actually 
comes from. We frame the question of how consumers decide what to buy as “the buyer’s 
problem” and discuss the three key ingredients of tastes and preferences, prices, and the 
budget set. The discussion is intuitive: once these three pieces are in place, the demand 
curve naturally falls out. This approach leads fluidly to a discussion of consumer surplus, 
demand elasticities, and how consumers predictably respond to incentives. In this way, 
the student can readily see holistically why policymakers and business people should con-
cern themselves with the demand side of economics. For the students who want it, there 
is an appendix on income and substitution effects, which is presented as an extension of 
the text.
In Chapter 6, we use the same holistic approach, but here we follow a single company 
(The Wisconsin Cheeseman, which a coauthor worked at for two high school summers) 
to showcase “the seller’s problem.” The seller’s problem also has three parts: production, 

	
Preface
25
costs, and revenues. In thinking through the seller’s problem, it is natural to treat these 
three components together rather than strew them over separate chapters as in other books. 
They need to be simultaneously considered by the firm when making optimal choices, so 
why not present them jointly? The running theme of The Wisconsin Cheeseman makes the 
chapter quite cohesive, and what was once a difficult puzzle to sort through becomes clear 
when presented under a single continuous example. For the more inquisitive students there 
is an appendix showing that for firms with different cost structures, economic profits can 
exist in long-run equilibrium.
Chapter 7 takes an aerial view by considering what happens when we put together the 
buyers of Chapter 5 and the sellers of Chapter 6 in a perfectly competitive market. The 
chapter begins by asking: can markets composed of only self-interested people maximize 
the overall well-being of society? The beauty of economics is on full display in this ­chapter, 
as it shows that in a perfectly competitive market, the invisible hand creates harmony be-
tween the interests of the individual and those of society. Prices guide the invisible hand 
and incentivize buyers and sellers, who in turn maximize social surplus by allocating re-
sources efficiently within and across sectors of the economy. The chapter uses Vernon 
Smith’s seminal laboratory experiments to provide the evidence that prices and quantities 
converge to the intersection of supply and demand.
In Chapter 8 we first walk through a discussion of the production possibilities curve, 
comparative advantage, and the gains from trade. We move the discussion from individu-
als trading with each other to trade between states (an innovation in a principles text) and 
finally to trade between countries. Students can thus see that the principles motivating them 
to trade are the same as those motivating states and nations to trade. They develop an un-
derstanding that there are sometimes winners and losers in trade, but that overall, the gains 
from trade are larger than the losses. The key policy issue becomes: can we shift surplus to 
make trade a win–win for everyone?
If students stopped reading the book at this point, they would be rabid free-market pro-
ponents. This is because the beauty of the free market is unparalleled. Chapter 9 begins a 
discussion of important cases that frustrate the workings of the invisible hand. When some 
firms produce, they pollute the air and water. There are some goods that everyone can 
consume once they are provided, such as national defense. Chapter 9 probes three cases of 
market failure—externalities, public goods, and common pool resources—and highlights 
an important link: in all three cases, there is a difference between social and private benefits 
or social and private costs. The student learns that the invisible hand of Chapter 7 can be-
come “broken” and that government can enact policies in regard to externalities to improve 
social well-being, provide public goods, and protect common pool resources.
But government intervention can be a two-edged sword, and in Chapter 10 we ask 
the question, “How much government intervention is necessary and how much is desir-
able?” We provide an aerial view of taxation and spending, and study how regulation—the 
main tool that governments use to deal with the externalities and other market failures of 
Chapter 10—has its costs and limitations. We see that the trade-off between equity and 
­efficiency represents the nub of the conflict between those who support big government 
and those who argue for smaller government. The Evidence-Based Economics feature at 
the end of the chapter tackles the thorny question of the optimal size of government by 
exploring the deadweight loss of income taxation.
Chapter 11 motivates the importance of factor markets—the inputs that firms use to 
make their goods and services—by asking if there is discrimination in the labor market. 
This question is couched within a general discussion about why people earn different 
wages in the labor market. This approach allows the student to seamlessly transition from 
being a demander (as in Chapter 5 as a buyer) to being a supplier (of labor). The economics 
behind the other major factors of production—physical capital and land—naturally follow 
from the labor discussion. The chapter concludes by showing several interesting data sets 
measuring whether discrimination exists in labor markets.
Part III Market Structure introduces the alternatives to the perfectly competitive mar-
ket: monopolies, oligopolies, and monopolistic competition. This section also provides the 
tools necessary to understand these market structures.
Chapter 12 on monopoly connects the student’s thinking to Chapter 6 where the seller’s 
problem was introduced and shows that all of the production and cost concepts learned 

26	
Preface
earlier apply here: production should be expanded until marginal cost equals marginal 
revenue. To illustrate the “monopolist’s problem,” we use a running example of the allergy 
drug Claritin and its 20-year patent to show how a monopoly optimizes. Once again, we 
use the metaphor of the broken invisible hand to illustrate how a monopoly reallocates re-
sources toward itself and thereby sacrifices social surplus. At this point, the student might 
wonder why legal market power is ever granted by the government. The opening question, 
Can a monopoly ever be good for society? discusses the other side of the coin by presenting 
evidence that a monopoly can sometimes be good for society.
At this point in the book, we have covered many of the topics that are treated in existing 
texts. Chapter 13 is a point of major departure, as we devote an entire chapter to game the-
ory, which is a source of some of the most powerful economic insights. We emphasize that 
it helps us better understand the world when we place ourselves in the shoes of someone 
else. In so doing, the student develops a deeper understanding of how to choose a strategy 
that is a best response to the strategies of others. We apply game theory to many situations, 
including pollution, soccer, and advertising, to name a few.
In Chapter 14, we present the two market structures that fall between the extremes of 
perfect competition and monopoly: oligopoly and monopolistic competition. We develop 
the chapter around the motivating question of how many firms are necessary to make a 
market competitive. Throughout, we emphasize how oligopolist firms and monopolisti-
cally competitive firms set their prices and quantities by considering the choices of their 
competitors. We connect with previous chapters by framing the discussion in terms of the 
optimization problem of these firms: the “oligopolist’s problem” and the “monopolistic 
competitor’s problem.” We show how in the short run it is identical to the monopolist’s 
problem and in the long run to the perfectly competitive model.
Part IV Extending the Microeconomic Toolbox provides a selection of special-topic, 
optional chapters, depending on the individual instructor’s course emphasis. We have in-
cluded these chapters because we feel that too often the student doesn’t get to see the 
myriad of interesting applications that follow from all those months of learning basic eco-
nomic principles!
Chapter 15 studies trade-offs involving time and risk. The chapter begins by asking 
how the timing of a reward affects its economic value. We show how compound interest 
causes an investment’s value to grow over time. We also show how to discount future fi-
nancial flows and how to make financial decisions using the net present value framework. 
The second half of the chapter discusses probability and risk and explains how to calculate 
expected value. We apply these ideas to the study of gambling, extended warranties, and 
insurance.
Why does a new car lose considerable value the minute it is driven off the lot? ­Chapter 16 
examines markets we are all familiar with—ones in which one side of the market has more 
information than the other. The chapter examines the informational disparities between 
buyers and sellers in terms of hidden characteristics (for example, a sick person is more 
likely to apply for health insurance) and hidden actions (for example, an insured person 
is more likely to drive recklessly). Along the way, we look at many timely topics such as 
lemons in the used-car market, adverse selection in the health insurance market, and moral 
hazard in risk and insurance markets.
In Chapter 17 we explore situations that students sometimes face: auctions and bargain-
ing. Our optimization theme continues, as we discuss best strategies and bargaining prin-
ciples in a variety of settings. We explore the four common types of auctions and provide 
insights into how economics can help the student bid in auctions—from eBay to estate auc-
tions to charity auctions. We then shift gears and examine bargaining situations that affect 
our lives daily. To show the power of the bargaining model, we present empirical evidence 
of who in the household determines how money is spent.
Perhaps the most unusual chapter for a principles textbook is Chapter 18, which is on 
social economics. Here we introduce new variants of homo economicus. We explore two 
different areas of human behavior: the economics of charity and fairness and the economics 
of revenge. We then revisit the concept and origin of preferences—do we take satisfaction 
from contributing to a charity or from exacting revenge on a perceived enemy? This last 
chapter drives home the fact that economic principles can be extended to every corner of 
our world. And it teaches us that we can considerably extend our understanding of the 

	
Preface
27
world around us by adding insights from our sister sciences—psychology, history, anthro-
pology, sociology, and political science—to name a few.
Part V Introduction to Macroeconomics provides an introduction to the field. In  
Chapter 19 we explain the basic measurement tools. Here we explore the derivation of the 
aggregate output of the economy, or the gross domestic product (GDP), with the produc-
tion, expenditure, and income methods, explaining why all these methods are equivalent 
and lead to the same level of total GDP. We also consider what isn’t measured in GDP, such 
as production that takes place at home for one’s family. Finally, we discuss the measure-
ment of inflation and the concept of a price index.
In Chapter 20 we show how income (GDP) per capita can be compared across countries 
using two similar techniques—an exchange rate method and a purchasing power method. 
We explain how the aggregate production function links a country’s physical capital stock, 
labor resources (total labor hours and human capital per worker), and technology to its 
GDP and thus draw the link between income per capita and a country’s physical capital 
stock per worker, human capital, and technology. We then use these tools to investigate the 
roles of physical capital, human capital, and technology in accounting for the great differ-
ences in prosperity across countries.
In Part VI, Long-Run Growth and Development, we turn to a comprehensive treatment 
of growth and development. In Chapter 21, we show that economic growth has trans-
formed many countries over the past 200 years. For example, in the United States today, 
GDP per capita is about 25 times higher than it was in 1820. In this discussion, we explain 
the “exponential” nature of economic growth, which results from the fact that new growth 
builds on past growth, and implies that small differences in growth rates can translate into 
huge differences in income per capita over several decades. We explain how sustained 
economic growth relies on advances in technology and why different countries have expe-
rienced different long-run growth paths. We also emphasize that economic growth does not 
benefit all citizens equally. For some citizens, poverty is the unintentional by-product of 
technological progress. For the instructors who want a more in-depth treatment of growth 
and the determinants of GDP, we present a simplified version of the Solow Model in an 
optional appendix to the chapter.
Why do some nations not invest enough in physical and human capital, adopt the best 
technologies, and organize their production efficiently? Put another way, why isn’t the 
whole world economically developed? Chapter 22 probes this question and considers the 
fundamental causes of prosperity. We discuss several potential fundamental causes, in par-
ticular, geography, culture, and institutions, and argue why the oft-emphasized geographic 
factors do not seem to account for much of the wide cross-country gaps in economic 
prosperity.
In Part VII, Equilibrium in the Macroeconomy, we discuss three key markets that play a 
central role in macroeconomic analysis: the labor market, the credit market, and the market 
for bank reserves. Chapter 23 begins with the labor market—labor demand and labor sup-
ply. We first describe the standard competitive equilibrium, where the wage and the quan-
tity of labor employed are pinned down by the intersection of the labor demand and labor 
supply curves. We then show how imperfectly flexible wages lead to unemployment. We 
then use this framework to discuss the many different factors that influence unemployment, 
including both frictional and structural sources.
Chapter 24 extends our analysis by incorporating the credit market. We explain how 
the modern financial system circulates funds from savers to borrowers. We describe the 
different types of shocks that can destabilize a financial system. We look at how banks and 
other financial intermediaries connect supply and demand in the credit market, and we use 
banks’ balance sheets to explain the risks of taking on short-term liabilities and making 
long-term investments.
Chapter 25 introduces the monetary system. We begin by explaining the functions of 
money. The chapter then introduces the Federal Reserve Bank (the Fed) and lays out the 
basic plumbing of the monetary system, especially the role of supply and demand in the 
market for bank reserves. We explain in detail the Fed’s role in controlling bank reserves 
and influencing interest rates, especially the interest rate on bank reserves (the federal 
funds rate). The chapter explains the causes of inflation and its social costs and benefits.

Preface
In Part VIII, Short-Run Fluctuations and Macroeconomic Policy, we use a modern 
framework to analyze and explain short-run fluctuations. Our analysis is inclusive and  
integrative, enabling us to combine the most relevant and useful insights from many dif-
ferent schools of economic thought. We believe that the labor market is the most in-
formative lens through which first-year economics students can understand economic 
fluctuations. We therefore put the labor market and unemployment at the center of our 
analysis. In this part of the book, we also extend our discussion of the role of finan-
cial markets and financial crises. We present a balanced perspective that incorporates the  
diverse range of important insights that have emerged in the last century of theoretical and 
empirical research.
Chapter 26 lays the foundations of this approach, showing how a wide range of economic 
shocks cause short-run fluctuations and how these can be studied using the labor market. We 
trace out the impact of technological shocks, shocks to sentiments (including animal spirits), 
and monetary and financial shocks that work through their impact on the interest rate or by 
causing financial crises. In each case, we explain how multipliers amplify the impact of the 
initial shock. We also explain how wage rigidities affect the labor market response to these 
shocks. We apply our labor market model to both economic contractions and expansions and 
look at the problems that arise when the economy grows too slowly or too quickly.
Chapter 27 discusses the wide menu of monetary and fiscal policies that are used to 
partially offset aggregate fluctuations. We describe the most important strategies that have 
recently been adopted by central banks. We then discuss the role of fiscal policy and pro-
vide an analytic toolkit that students can use to estimate the impact of countercyclical 
expenditures and taxation. 
In Part IX, Macroeconomics in a Global Economy, we provide a wide-angle view of the 
global economy and the relationships that interconnect national economies. In ­Chapter 28 
we show how international trade works, using the key concepts of specialization, ­comparative 
advantage, and opportunity cost. We study the optimal allocation of tasks ­inside a firm and 
show that firms should allocate their employees to tasks—and individuals should choose 
their occupations—according to comparative advantage. We then broaden the picture by fo-
cusing on the optimal allocation of tasks across countries and show that here, too, the same 
principles apply. We analyze international flows of goods and services and the financial 
consequences of trade deficits. We describe the accounting identities that enable economists 
to measure the rich patterns of globalized trade. We also discuss the critical role of technol-
ogy transfer.
Chapter 29 studies the determinants of exchange rates—both nominal and real—­
between different currencies and how they impact the macroeconomy. We describe the 
different types of exchange rate regimes and the operation of the foreign exchange market. 
Finally, we study the impact of changes in the real exchange rate on net exports and GDP.

After the initial setup of the MyEconLab course for Acemoglu/Laibson/List, there are 
two primary ways to begin using this rich online environment. The first path requires no 
further action by the instructor. Students, on their own, can use MyEconLab’s adaptive 
Study Plan problems and tutorial resources to enhance their understanding of concepts. 
The online gradebook records each student’s performance and time spent on the assess-
ments, activities, and the study plan and generates reports by student or chapter.
Alternatively, instructors can fully customize MyEconLab to match their course exactly: 
reading assignments, homework assignments, video assignments, current news assign-
ments, digital activities, experiments, quizzes, and tests. Assignable resources include:
•	 Preloaded exercise assignment sets for each chapter that include the student tutorial 
resources mentioned earlier
•	 Preloaded quizzes for each chapter
•	 Interactive Reading Assignments in MyEconLab enable educators to encourage core 
reading by providing an assessment incentive along the way. These short reading 
segments feature embedded exercises that prompt students to learn actively. These 
exercises are automatically graded, so educators can integrate assessment into read-
ing assignments quickly and easily.
•	 Assignable and gradable exercises that are similar to the end-of-chapter questions and 
problems and numbered exactly as in the book to make assigning homework easier
•	 Real-Time Data Analysis Exercises allow students and instructors to use the very lat-
est data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s FRED site. By completing the 
exercises, students become familiar with a key data source, learn how to locate data, 
and develop skills in interpreting data.
•	 In the eText available in MyEconLab, select exhibits labeled MyEconLab Real-Time 
Data allow students to display a pop-up graph updated with real-time data from  FRED.
•	 Current News Exercises provide a turnkey way to assign gradable news-based exer-
cises in MyEconLab. Each week, Pearson scours the news, finds current economics 
articles, creates exercises around the news articles, and then automatically adds them 
to MyEconLab. Assigning and grading current news-based exercises that deal with the 
latest economics events and policy issues have never been more convenient.
•	 Econ Exercise Builder allows you to build customized exercises. Exercises include 
multiple-choice, graph drawing, and free-response items, many of which are gener-
ated algorithmically so that each time a student works them, a different variation is 
presented.
•	 Test Item File questions that allow you to assign quizzes or homework that will look 
just like your exams
MyEconLab grades every problem type (except essays), even problems with graphs. 
When working homework exercises, students receive immediate feedback, with links to 
additional learning tools.
•	 Experiments in MyEconLab are a fun and engaging way to promote active learn-
ing and mastery of important economic concepts. Pearson’s Experiments program is 
flexible and easy for instructors and students to use.
•	 Single-player experiments allow your students to play against virtual players from 
anywhere at any time as long as they have an Internet connection.
•	 Multiplayer experiments allow you to assign and manage a real-time experiment 
with your class.
Pre- and post-questions for each experiment are available for assignment in 
MyEconLab.
For a complete list of available experiments, visit www.myeconlab.com.
•	 Digital Interactives immerse students in a fundamental economic principle, helping 
them to learn actively. They can be presented in class as a visually stimulating, highly 
engaging lecture tool, and can also be assigned with assessment questions for grad-
ing. Digital Interactives are designed for use in traditional, online, and hybrid courses, 
and many incorporate real-time data, as well as data display and analysis tools. To 
learn more, and for a complete list of digital interactives, visit www​.­myeconlab.com.

For Students
MyEconLab puts students in control of their learning through a collection of testing, prac-
tice, and study tools tied to the online, interactive version of the textbook and other media 
resources.
In MyEconLab’s environment, students practice what they learn, test their understand-
ing, and pursue a personalized and adaptive study plan generated from their performance 
on sample tests and from quizzes created by their instructor. In Homework or Study Plan 
mode, students have access to a wealth of tutorial features, including:
•	 Instant feedback on exercises that helps students understand and apply the concepts
•	 Links to the eText to promote reading of the text just when the student needs to revisit 
a concept or an explanation
•	 Animations of most of the textbook’s exhibits provide step-by-step animation and 
audio to help students develop intuition in reading and interpreting graphs. The anima-
tions are accessible directly from the eText or from the Multimedia Library.
•	 Step-by-step guided solutions that force students to break down a problem in much 
the same way an instructor would do during office hours
•	 Pop-up key term definitions from the eText to help students master the vocabulary of 
economics
•	 A graphing tool that is integrated into the various exercises to enable students to 
build and manipulate graphs to better understand how concepts, numbers, and graphs 
connect
Additional MyEconLab Resources
•	 Enhanced eText—In addition to the portions of eText available as pop-ups or links, a 
fully searchable enhanced eText is available for students who wish to read and study in 
a fully electronic environment. The enhanced eText includes all of the animations and 
embedded links to all of the end-of-chapter questions and problems, enabling students 
to read, review, and immediately practice their understanding. The embedded exercises 
are auto-graded exercises and feed directly into MyEconLab’s adaptive Study Plan.
MyEconLab and Adaptive Learning MyEconLab’s Study Plan is now powered by a so-
phisticated adaptive learning engine that tailors learning material to meet the unique needs 
of each student. MyEconLab’s new Adaptive Learning Study Plan monitors students’ 
performance on homework, quizzes, and tests and continuously makes recommendations 
based on that performance.

	
Preface
31
If a student is struggling with a concept such as supply and demand or having trouble 
calculating a price elasticity of demand, the Study Plan provides customized remediation 
activities—a pathway based on personal proficiencies, number of attempts, or difficulty of 
questions—to get the student back on track. Students will also receive recommendations 
for additional practice in the form of rich multimedia learning aids such as an interactive 
eText, Help Me Solve This tutorials, and graphing tools.
The Study Plan can identify a student’s potential trouble spots and provide learning 
material and practice to avoid pitfalls. In addition, students who are showing a high de-
gree of success with the assessment material are offered a chance to work on future topics 
based on the professor’s course coverage preferences. This personalized and adaptive 
feedback and support ensures that students are optimizing their current and future course 
work and mastering the concepts, rather than just memorizing and guessing answers.
Dynamic Study Modules, which focus on key topic areas and are available from within 
MyEconLab, are an additional way for students to obtain tailored help. These modules 
work by continuously assessing student performance and activity on discrete topics and 
provide personalized content in real time to reinforce concepts that target each student’s 
particular strengths and weaknesses.
Each Dynamic Study Module, accessed by computer, smartphone, or tablet, promotes 
fast learning and long-term retention. Because MyEconLab and Dynamic Study Modules 
help students stay on track and achieve a higher level of subject-matter mastery, more class 
time is available for interaction, discussion, collaboration, and exploring applications to 
current news and events. Instructors can register, create, and access all of their MyEconLab 
courses at www.pearsonmylab.com.

As the three of us worked on this project, we taught each other a lot about economics, teach-
ing, and writing. But we learned even more from the hundreds of other people who helped us 
along the way. For their guidance, we are thankful and deeply humbled. Their contributions 
turned out to be critical in ways that we never imagined when we started, and our own ideas 
were greatly improved by their insights and advice. 
Our reviewers, focus group participants, and class testers showed us how to better for-
mulate our ideas and helped us sharpen our writing. Through their frequently brilliant feed-
back, they corrected our economic misconceptions, improved our conceptual vision, and 
showed us how to write more clearly. Their contributions appear in almost every paragraph 
of this book. All of their names are listed below.
Our research assistants—Alec Brandon, Justin Holz, Josh Hurwitz, Xavier Jaravel, 
Angelina Liang, Daniel Norris , Yana Peysakhovich, and Jan Zilinsky—played a critical 
role at every phase of the project, from analyzing data to editing prose to generating deep 
insights about pedagogical principles that are woven throughout the book. These research 
assistants played many roles. We learned to trust their instincts on every element of the 
book, and quickly realized that their contributions were indispensable to the project’s 
success. We are especially indebted to Josh, who has earned our eternal gratitude for 
many late work nights and for his brilliant editorial and economic insights.
We are grateful to Zick Rubin, who advised us as we started to organize the project 
and encouraged us as the book developed. We are also deeply thankful to the many in-
spiring economists who contributed major components of the project. Robert M. Schwab, 
­University of Maryland, Bruce Watson of Boston University, Anuradha Gupta, and ­Julia 
Paul contributed extensively to the development of the end-of-chapter questions and prob-
lems, which stand out as examples of inspiring pedagogy. James Hornsten, Northwest-
ern University, Timothy Diette, Washington and Lee University, and Rashid Al-Hmoud of 
Texas Tech University wrote the innovative and intuitive Instructor’s Manual and Active 
Learning ­Exercises. Julia Heath and David Bourne, University of Cincinnati,  Eric Nielsen, 
St. Louis Community College, Steven Yamarik, California State University, Long Beach 
and Paul Graf, Indiana University, Bloomington created outstanding PowerPoint slides and 
animations that illuminate and distill the key lessons of the book. Anuradha Gupta and Julia 
Paul created the expansive test bank. 
Most importantly, we acknowledge the myriad contributions of our editors and all of 
our amazing colleagues at Pearson. They have marched with us every step of the way. 
We wouldn’t dare count the number of hours that they dedicated to this project–­including 
­evenings and weekends. Their commitment, vision, and editorial suggestions touched 
every sentence of this book. Most of the key decisions about the project were made with 
the help of our editors, and this collaborative spirit proved to be ­absolutely essential to 
our writing. Dozens of people at Pearson played key roles, but the most important contri-
butions were made by Adrienne D’Ambrosio, Executive ­Acquisitions Editor, Mary Clare 
­McEwing, Executive ­Development Editor, Nancy ­Freihofer, ­Production Manager, Sarah 
­Dumouchelle, Andra Skaalrud, Diane Kohnen, and Ann Francis our Project Managers, 
­Kathleen McLellan, Product Testing and Learner ­Validation Manager, Lori DeShazo,  
­Executive Field Marketing ­Manager, ­Alison Haskins, ­Senior Product Marketing Man-
ager, Noel Lotz, Digital Content Team Lead, Melissa Honig, Digital Studio Project Man-
ager, and Margaret E. Monahan-Pashall.
We are particularly grateful to Adrienne who has been deeply committed to our project 
from the first day and has tirelessly worked with us at every key decision. We also wish 
to thank Denise Clinton, Digital Editor, who first got us started, and Donna Battista, Vice 
President Product Management, who championed the project along the way. All of these 
advisers transformed us as writers, teachers, and communicators. This book is a testimony 
to their perseverance, their dedication, and their brilliant eye for good (and often bad!)

writing. Their commitment to this project has been extraordinary and inspirational. We are 
profoundly grateful for their guidance and collaboration.
Finally, we wish to thank our many other support networks. Our own professors, who 
first inspired us as economists and showed, through their example, the power of teaching 
and the joy that one can take from studying economics. Our parents, who nurtured us in so 
many ways and gave us the initial human capital that made our entire careers possible. Our 
kids—Annika, Aras, Arda, Eli, Greta, Mason, Max, and Noah—who sacrificed when our 
long hours on this book ate into family life. And, most profoundly, we thank our spouses, 
who have been supportive, understanding, and inspirational throughout the project. 
This book is the product of many streams that have flowed together and so many people 
who have contributed their insights and their passion to this project. We are deeply grateful 
for these myriad collaborations.

ticipants, and focus group participants

Facebook doesn’t charge you a penny, so it’s 
tempting to say, “it’s free.”
Is Facebook 
free?
Here’s another way to think about it. What do you give up when you use 
Facebook? That’s a different kind of question. Facebook doesn’t take your 
money, but it does take your time. If you spend an hour each day on Facebook, 
you are giving up some alternative use of that time. You could spend that 
time playing soccer, watching Hulu videos, napping, daydreaming, or listening 
to music. There are many ways to use your time. For example, a typical U.S. 
college student employed 7 hours per week earns almost $4,000 in a year—
enough to pay the annual lease on a sports car. A part-time job is just one 
­alternative way to use the time that you spend on Facebook. In your view, what 
is the best alternative use of your Facebook time? That’s the economic way of 
thinking about the cost of Facebook.
In this chapter, we introduce you to the economic way of thinking about  
the world. Economists study the choices that people make, especially the costs 
and benefits of those choices, even the costs and the benefits of Facebook.

Most people are surprised to learn how much ground economics cov-
ers. Economists study all human behavior, from a person’s decision 
to lease a new sports car, to the speed the new driver chooses as she 
rounds a hairpin corner, to her decision not to wear a seat belt. These 
are all choices, and they are all fair game to economists. And they are 
not all directly related to money. Choice—not money—is the unifying 
feature of all the things that economists study.
In fact, economists think of almost all human behavior as the out-
come of choices. For instance, imagine that Dad tells his teenage daughter that she must 
wash the family car. Though it may not be obvious, the daughter has several options: she 
can wash it, she can negotiate for an easier chore, she can refuse to wash it and suffer the 
consequences, or she can move out (admittedly, a drastic response, but still a choice). 
Obeying one’s parents is a choice, though it may not always feel like one.
Economic Agents and Economic Resources
Saying that economics is all about choices is an easy way to remember what economics is. 
To give you a more precise definition, we first need to introduce two important concepts: 
economic agents and resource allocation.
An economic agent is an individual or a group that makes choices. Let’s start with a 
few types of individual economic agents. For example, a consumer chooses to eat bacon 
cheeseburgers or tofu burgers. A parent chooses to enroll her children in public school or 
private school. A student chooses to attend his classes or to skip them. A citizen chooses 
whether or not to vote, and if so, which candidate to support. A worker chooses to do her 
job or pretend to work while texting. A criminal chooses to hotwire cars or mug little 
old ladies. A business leader chooses to open a new factory in Chile or China. A senator 
chooses to vote for or against a bill. Of course, you are also an economic agent because you 
make an enormous number of choices every day.
Not all economic agents, however, are individuals. An economic agent can also be a 
group—a government, an army, a firm, a university, a political party, a labor union, a sports 
team, a street gang. Sometimes economists simplify their analysis by treating these groups 
as a single decision maker, without worrying about the details of how the different indi-
viduals in the group contributed to the decision. For example, an economist might say that 
Apple prices the iPhone to maximize its profits, glossing over the fact that hundreds of 
executives participated in the analysis that led to the choice of the price.
The Scope of Economics
1.1 
Choice—not money—is the  
unifying feature of all the things  
that ­economists study.
An economic agent is an individual 
or a group that makes choices.
Key IDEAS
Economics is the study of people’s choices.
The first principle of economics is that people try to optimize: they try to 
choose the best available option.
The second principle of economics is that economic systems tend to be 
in equilibrium, a situation in which nobody would benefit by changing his or 
her own behavior.
The third principle of economics is empiricism—analysis that uses data. 
Economists use data to test theories and to determine what is causing 
things to happen in the world.

Scarce resources are things that 
people want, where the quantity 
that people want exceeds the 
quantity that is available.
Scarcity is the situation of having 
unlimited wants in a world of limited 
resources.
Economics is the study of how 
agents choose to allocate scarce 
resources and how those choices 
affect society.
The second important concept to understand is that economics studies the allocation of 
scarce resources. Scarce resources are things that people want, where the quantity that 
people want exceeds the quantity that is available. Gold wedding bands, Shiatsu massages, 
Coach handbags, California peaches, iPhones, triple-chocolate-fudge ice cream, and rooms 
with a view are all scarce resources. And so are most ordinary things, like toilet paper, sub-
way seats, and clean drinking water. Scarcity exists because people have unlimited wants 
in a world of limited resources. The world does not have enough resources to give everyone 
everything they want. Consider sports cars. If sports cars were given away for free, there 
would not be enough of them to go around. Instead, sports cars are sold to the consumers 
who are willing to pay for them.
The existence of a marketplace for sports cars gives economic agents lots of choices. 
You have 24 hours to allocate each day—this is your daily budget of time. You choose 
how many of those 24 hours you will allocate to Facebook. You choose how many of those 
24 hours you will allocate to other activities, including a job. If you have a job, you also 
choose whether to spend your hard-earned wages on a sports car. These kinds of decisions 
determine how scarce sports cars are allocated in a modern economy: to the consumers 
who are able and willing to pay for them.
Economists don’t want to impose our tastes for sports cars, hybrids, electric vehicles, 
SUVs, or public transportation on you. We are interested in teaching you how to use eco-
nomic reasoning so that you can compare the costs and benefits of the alternative options 
and make the choices that are best for you.
Definition of Economics
We are now ready to define economics precisely. Economics is the study of how agents 
choose to allocate scarce resources and how those choices affect society.
As you might have expected, this definition emphasizes choices. The definition also 
takes into account how these choices affect society. For example, the sale of a new sports 
car doesn’t just affect the person driving off the dealer’s lot. The sale generates sales tax, 
which is collected by the government, which in turn funds projects like highways and hos-
pitals. The purchase of the new car also generates some congestion—that’s one more car in 
rush-hour gridlock. And it’s another car that might grab the last parking spot on your street. 
If the new owner drives recklessly, the car may also generate risks to other drivers. The car 
will also be a source of pollution. Economists study the original choice and its multiple 
consequences for other people in the world.

Positive Economics and Normative Economics
We now have an idea of what economics is about: people’s choices. But what is the reason 
for studying choices? Part of the answer is that economists are just curious, but that’s only 
a small part of the picture. Understanding people’s choices is practically useful for two key 
reasons. Economic analysis:
	
1.	 Describes what people actually do (positive economics).
	
2.	 Recommends what people ought to do (normative economics).
The first application is descriptive and the second is advisory.
Positive Economics Describes What People Actually Do  Descriptions 
of what people actually do are objective statements about the world. Such factual 
statements can be confirmed or tested with data. For instance, it is a fact that in 2010, 
50 percent of U.S. households earned less than $52,000 per year. Describing what 
has happened or predicting what will happen is referred to as positive economics or 
positive economic analysis.
For instance, consider the prediction that in 2020 U.S. households will save about 
5 percent of their income. This forecast can be compared to future data and either con-
firmed or disproven. Because a prediction is ultimately testable, it is part of positive 
economics.
Normative Economics Recommends What People Ought to Do  Normative 
economics, the second of the two types of economic analysis, advises individuals and 
society on their choices. Normative economics is about what people ought to do. 
Normative economics is almost always dependent on subjective judgments, which means 
that normative analysis depends at least in part on personal feelings, tastes, or opinions. 
So whose subjective judgments do we try to use? Economists believe that the person being 
advised should determine the preferences to be used.
For example, if an economist were helping a worker to decide how much to save for re-
tirement, the economist would first ask the worker about her own preferences. Suppose the 
worker expressed a high degree of patience—“I want to save enough so I can maintain my 
level of expenditure when I retire.” In this case, the economist would recommend a saving 
rate that achieves the worker’s desire for steady consumption throughout her life—about 
10 to 15 percent of income for most middle-income families. Here the economist plays 
the role of engineer, finding the saving rate that will deliver the future level of retirement 
spending that the worker wants.
The economist does not tell the worker what degree of patience to have. Instead, the 
economist asks the worker about her preferences and then recommends a saving rate that is 
best for the worker given her preferences. In the mind of most economists, it is legitimate 
for the worker to choose any saving rate, as long as she understands the implications of that 
saving rate for expenditure after retirement.
Normative Analysis and Public Policy  Normative analysis also generates advice to 
society in general. For example, economists are often asked to evaluate public policies, like 
taxes or regulations. When public policies have winners and losers, citizens tend to have 
opposing views about the desirability of the government program. One person’s migratory 
bird sanctuary is another person’s mosquito-infested swamp. Protecting a wetland with 
environmental regulations benefits bird-watchers but harms landowners who plan to 
develop that land.
When a government policy has winners and losers, economists will need to make some 
ethical judgments to conduct normative analysis. Economists must make ethical judgments 
whenever we evaluate policies that make one group worse off so another group can be 
made better off.
Ethical judgments are usually unavoidable when economists think about government 
policies, because there are very few policies that make everyone better off. Deciding 
whether the costs experienced by the losers are justified by the benefits experienced by the 
winners is partly an ethical judgment. Is it ethical to create environmental regulations that 
prevent a real estate developer from draining a swamp so he can build new homes? What if 
Economics is the study  
of choice.
Positive economics is analysis that 
generates objective descriptions or 
predictions about the world that can 
be verified with data.
Normative economics is analysis 
that prescribes what an individual or 
society ought to do.

those environmental regulations protect migratory birds that other people value? Are there 
other solutions to this seemingly unresolvable problem? Should the government try to buy 
the land from the real estate developer? And if land purchasing is the government’s policy, 
how should society determine the price that the government offers the developer? Should 
the developer be forced to sell at that price? These public policy questions—which all ask 
what society should do—are normative economic questions.
Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
There is one other distinction that you need to know to understand the scope of economics. 
Economics can be divided into two broad fields of study, though many economists do a bit 
of both.
Microeconomics is the study of how individuals, households, firms, and govern-
ments make choices, and how those choices affect prices, the allocation of resources, 
and the well-being of other agents. For example, microeconomists design policies that 
reduce pollution. Because global warming is partially caused by carbon emissions 
from coal, oil, and other fossil fuels, microeconomists design policies to reduce the use 
of these fuels. For example, a “carbon tax” targets carbon emissions. Under a carbon 
tax, relatively carbon-intensive energy sources—like coal power plants—pay more tax 
per unit of energy produced than energy sources with lower carbon emissions—like 
wind farms. Microeconomists have the job of designing carbon taxes and determin-
ing how such taxes will affect the energy usage of households and firms. In general, 
microeconomists are called upon whenever we want to understand a small piece of the 
overall economy.
Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. Macroeconomists study 
economy-wide phenomena, like the growth rate of a country’s total economic output, or 
the percentage increase in overall prices (the inflation rate), or the fraction of the labor 
force that is looking for work but cannot find a job (the unemployment rate). Macro-
economists design government policies that improve overall, or “aggregate,” economic 
performance.
For example, macroeconomists try to identify the best policies for stimulating an 
economy that is experiencing a sustained period of negative growth—in other words, an 
economy in recession. During the 2007–2009 financial crisis, when housing prices were 
plummeting and banks were failing, macroeconomists had their hands full. It was their job 
to explain why the economy was contracting and to recommend policies that would bring 
it back to life.
Economic agents have diver-
gent views on the future of 
this swamp. The owner of the 
property wants to build hous-
ing units. An environmentalist 
wants to preserve the wetland 
to protect the whooping crane, 
an endangered species. What 
should happen?
Microeconomics is the study of how 
individuals, households, firms, and 
governments make choices, and 
how those choices affect prices, the 
allocation of resources, and the well-
being of other agents.
Macroeconomics is the study 
of the economy as a whole. 
Macroeconomists study economy-
wide phenomena, like the growth 
rate of a country’s total economic 
output, the inflation rate, or the 
unemployment rate.
You now have a sense of what economics is about. But you might be wondering what 
distinguishes it from the other social sciences, including, anthropology, history, political 
science, psychology, and sociology. All of the social sciences study human behavior, so 
what sets economics apart?
Economists emphasize three key concepts.
1. Optimization: We have explained economics as the study of people’s choices. The 
study of all human choices may initially seem like an impossibly huge topic. And at first 
glance, choosing a double-bacon cheeseburger at McDonalds does not appear to have much 
in common with a corporate executive’s decision to build a $500 million laptop factory in 
China. Economists have identified some powerful concepts that unify the enormous range 
of choices that economic agents make. One such insight is that all choices are tied together 
by optimization: people decide what to do by consciously or unconsciously weighing all 
of the known pros and cons of the different available options and trying to pick the best 
feasible option. In other words, people make choices that are motivated by calculations of 
benefits and costs.
Three Principles of Economics
1.2 
Trying to choose the best feasible 
option, given the available 
information, is optimization.

Section 1.3   |  The First Principle of Economics: Optimization
45
1.3
Optimization is the first principle of economics. Economists 
believe that optimization explains most of our choices, including 
minor decisions like accepting an invitation to see a movie, and 
major decisions like deciding whom to marry.
2. Equilibrium: The second principle of economics holds 
that economic systems tend to be in equilibrium, a situation 
in which no agent would benefit personally by changing his 
or her own behavior. The economic system is in equilibrium 
when each agent feels that he or she cannot do any better by picking another course 
of action. In other words, equilibrium is a situation in which everyone is simultane-
ously optimizing.
3. Empiricism: The third principle of economics is an emphasis on empiricism—analysis 
that uses data or analysis that is evidence-based. Economists use data to test theories and to 
determine what is causing things to happen in the world.
Empiricism is analysis that uses data. 
Economists use data to test theories 
and to determine what is causing 
things to happen in the world.
People make choices that are 
­motivated by calculations of benefits 
and costs.
Equilibrium is the special situation 
in which everyone is simultaneously 
optimizing, so nobody would benefit 
personally by changing his or her 
own behavior.
Let’s now consider our first principle in more detail. Economics is the study of choices, and 
economists have a theory about how choices are made. Economists believe that economic 
agents try to optimize, meaning that economic agents try to choose the best feasible op-
tion, given the information that they have. Feasible options are those that are available and 
affordable to an economic agent. If you have $10 in your wallet and no credit/debit/ATM 
cards, then a $5 Big Mac is a feasible lunch option, while a $50 filet mignon is not.
The concept of feasibility goes beyond the financial budget of the agent. There are many 
different constraints that determine what is feasible. For instance, it is not feasible to work 
more than 24 hours in a day. It is not feasible to attend meetings (in person) in New York 
and Beijing at the same time.
The definition of optimization also refers to the information available at the time of the 
choice. For example, if you choose to drive from San Diego to Los Angeles and your car 
is hit by a drunk driver, you are unlucky but you haven’t necessarily failed to optimize. As 
long as you made your travel plans taking into account the realistic risk of a car crash, then 
you have optimized. Optimization means that we weigh the potential risks in a decision, not 
that we perfectly foresee the future. When someone chooses the best feasible option given 
the information that is available, economists say that the decision maker is being rational 
or, equivalently, he or she is exhibiting rationality. Rational action does not require a crystal 
ball, just a logical appraisal of the costs, benefits, and risks associ-
ated with each decision.
On the other hand, if you decide to let a friend drive you from 
San Diego to Los Angeles and you know that your friend has just 
had a few beers, this is probably a case in which you failed to 
optimize. It is important to note that the test of optimization is the 
quality of your decision, and not the outcome. If you arrive at your 
destination without a crash, that would still (probably) be a subop-
timal choice, because you got lucky despite making a bad decision.
We devote much of this book to the analysis of optimization. 
We explain how to optimize, and we discuss lots of evidence that 
supports the theory that economic agents usually optimize. We also discuss important cases 
where behavior deviates from optimization. In the cases where agents fail to optimize, 
normative economic analysis can help them realize their mistakes and make better choices 
in the future.
Finally, it is important to note that what we optimize varies from person to person and 
group to group. Although most firms try to maximize profits, most economic agents are not

trying to maximize only income. If that were our goal, we’d all work far more than 40 hours 
per week and we’d keep working well past retirement age. Most households are trying to 
optimize overall well-being, which requires income, leisure, health, and a host of other 
factors (like social networks and a sense of purpose in life). Most governments are trying 
to optimize a complex mix of policy goals. For most economic agents, optimization is not 
just about how much money we have.
Trade-offs and Budget Constraints
To understand optimization, you need to understand trade-offs. Trade-offs arise when 
some benefits must be given up in order to gain others. Think about Facebook. If you spend 
an hour on Facebook, then you cannot spend that hour doing other things. For example, you 
cannot work at most part-time jobs at the same time you are editing your Facebook profile.
Economists use budget constraints to describe trade-offs. A budget constraint is the set 
of things that a person can choose to do (or buy) without breaking her budget.
Here’s an illustration. Suppose that you can do only one of two activities with your 
free time: work at a part-time job or surf the Web. Suppose that you have 5 free hours in a 
day (once we take away necessities like sleeping, eating, bathing, attending classes, doing 
problem sets, and studying for exams). Think of these 5 free hours as your budget of free 
time. Then your budget constraint would be:
5 hours =  Hours surfing the Web  +  Hours working at part-time job.
This budget constraint equation implies that you face a trade-off. If you spend an extra 
hour surfing the Web, you need to spend one less hour working at a part-time job. Likewise, 
if you spend an extra hour working at the part-time job, you need to spend one less hour 
surfing the Web. More of one activity implies less of the other. We can see this in Exhibit 1.2, 
where we list all of the ways that you could allocate your 5 free hours.
Budget constraints are useful economic tools because they quantify trade-offs. When 
economists talk about the choice that an economic agent faces, the economist first specifies 
the budget constraint.
Opportunity Cost
We are now ready to introduce another critical tool in the optimization toolbox: opportunity 
cost. Our Web surfing example provides an illustration of the concept. The time that we 
spend on the Web is time that we could have spent in some other way: playing basketball, 
jogging, daydreaming, sleeping, calling a friend, catching up on e-mail, working on a prob-
lem set, working at a part-time job, and so on. You implicitly sacrifice time on these alter-
native activities when you spend time surfing the Web (unless you secretly use Facebook 
while you are being paid for a job—in this case, please keep your boss off your friend list).
Try generating your own list of alternative activities that are squeezed out when you surf 
the Web. Think about the best alternative to Web surfing, and put that at the top; then work 
down from there. Your list illustrates the concept of opportunity cost; you can either spend 
An economic agent faces a trade-off 
when the agent needs to give up 
one thing to get something else.
A budget constraint shows the 
bundles of goods or services that 
a consumer can choose given her 
limited budget.

a specific hour of your day surfing the Web or on some other activity. In most situations 
you can’t simultaneously do both.
Evaluating trade-offs like this can be difficult because so many options are under con-
sideration. Economists tend to focus on the best alternative activity. We refer to this best 
alternative activity as the opportunity cost. This is what an optimizer is effectively giving 
up when she surfs the Web.
The importance of opportunity cost is clear once we remember that resources are lim-
ited, or scarce. Whenever we do one thing, something else gets squeezed out. When you 
surf the Web for an hour, some other activity is reduced by an hour, though you may not 
think about it at the time. You can’t write a term paper and update your Facebook page at 
the same time. Even if you only postpone the term paper, something else has got to give 
when that postponed time comes up. (Studying for the economics final?) Optimization re-
quires that you take account of the opportunity cost of whatever you are doing. In essence, 
an optimizer always considers how else she could be using her limited resources.
Here’s another example to drive home the concept. Assume that your family is taking 
a vacation over spring break. Your choices are a Caribbean cruise, a trip to Miami, or a 
trip to Los Angeles. (Assume that they all have the same monetary cost and use the same 
amount of time.) If your first choice is the cruise and your second choice is Miami, then 
your ­opportunity cost of taking the cruise is the Miami trip.
The concept of opportunity cost applies to all resources, not just your time budget of 
24 hours each day. Suppose that a woodworker has a beautiful piece of maple that can be 
used to make a sculpture, or a bowl, or a picture frame. (Assume that they all use the same 
amount of wood and take the same amount of time.) If the woodworker’s first choice is 
the sculpture and the second choice is the bowl, then the bowl is the opportunity cost of 
making the sculpture.
Assigning a Monetary Value to an Opportunity Cost  Economists sometimes try 
to put a monetary value on opportunity cost. Translating benefits and costs into monetary 
units, like dollars or yen, makes everything easier to analyze. One way to estimate the 
monetary value of an hour of your time is to analyze the consequences of taking a part-time 
job or working additional hours at the part-time job you already have.
The opportunity cost of your time is at least the net benefit that you would receive from 
a job (assuming that you can find one that fits your schedule). Here’s why. A part-time job 
is one item in the long list of alternatives to surfing the Web. If the part-time job is at the 
top of your list, then it’s the best alternative, and the part-time job is your opportunity cost 
of surfing the Web. What if the part-time job is not at the top of your list, so it’s not the 
best alternative? Then the best alternative is even better than the part-time job, so the best 
alternative is worth more than the part-time job. To sum up, your opportunity cost is either 
the net benefit of a part-time job or a value that is even greater than that.
To turn these insights into something quantitative, it helps to note that the median 
wage for U.S. workers between 16 and 24 years of age was $11.35 per hour in 2013—
this data is from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, a job has many attri-
butes other than the wage you are paid: unpleasant tasks (like being nice to obnoxious 
customers), on-the-job ­training, friendly or unfriendly coworkers, and resumé building, 
just to name a few.
If we ignore these non-wage attributes, the benefit of an hour of work is just the wage 
(minus taxes paid). On the other hand, if the positive and negative non-wage attributes 
don’t cross each other out, the calculation is much harder. To keep things simple, we’ll 
focus only on the after-tax wage in the analysis that follows—about $10 per hour for young 
workers—but we urge you to keep in mind all of the non-wage consequences that flow 
from a job.
Cost-Benefit Analysis
Let’s use opportunity cost to solve an optimization problem. Specifically, we want to com-
pare a set of feasible alternatives and pick the best one. Economists call this process cost-
benefit analysis. Cost-benefit analysis is a calculation that adds up costs and benefits 
using a common unit of measurement, like dollars. It is used to identify the alternative that 
has the greatest net benefit, which is equivalent to benefits minus costs.
Opportunity cost is the best 
alternative use of a resource.
Cost-benefit analysis is a 
calculation that adds up costs and 
benefits using a common unit of 
measurement, like dollars.

To see these ideas in action, suppose that you and a friend are going to Miami Beach 
from Boston for spring break. The only question is whether you should drive or fly. Your 
friend argues that you should drive because splitting the cost of a rental car and gas “will 
only cost $200 each.” He tries to seal the deal by pointing out “that’s much better than a 
$300 plane ticket.”
To analyze this problem using cost-benefit analysis, you need to list all of the costs and 
benefits of driving relative to the alternative of flying. You then need to translate those costs 
and benefits into a common unit of measurement.
From a benefit perspective, driving saves you $100—the difference between driving 
expenses of $200 and a plane ticket of $300. From a cost perspective, driving costs you 
an extra 40 hours of time—the difference between 50 hours of round-trip driving time and 
about 10 hours of round-trip airport/flying time. Spending 40 extra hours traveling is a cost 
of driving.
But we still don’t know whether driving is a good idea or a bad idea, because we 
haven’t yet expressed everything in common units. Suppose the opportunity cost of 
your time is $10 per hour (slightly below the median wage for U.S. workers between 
ages 16 and 24). This is the value of your time. Then the net benefit of driving relative 
to flying is
($100 Cost saving) − (40 Hours of additional travel time) × ($10/hour)  
= $100 − $400 = −$300.
Hence, the net benefit of driving is overwhelmingly negative. An optimizer would choose 
to fly.
Your decision about travel to Miami is a simple example of cost-benefit analysis, 
which is a great tool for collapsing all sorts of things down to a net dollar benefit. This 
book will guide you in making such calculations. If you are making choices as to which 
house to buy, which job to take, or whether Medicare should pay for heart transplants, 
cost-benefit analysis can help. Economists are not popular for making some of these 
“cold-hearted” calculations, but it’s nonetheless useful to be able to quantitatively ana-
lyze difficult decisions.
To an economist, cost-benefit analysis and optimization are the same thing. When you 
pick the option with the greatest net benefits—benefits minus costs—you are optimizing. 
So cost-benefit analysis is useful for normative economic analysis. It enables an economist 
to determine what an individual or a society should do. Cost-benefit analysis also yields 
many useful positive economic insights. In most cases, cost-benefit analysis correctly pre-
dicts the choices made by actual consumers.
 
Evidence-Based Economics
W
e can now turn to the question we posed at the beginning of the chap-
ter. By now you know that Facebook has an opportunity cost—the best 
alternative use of your time. We will now estimate this cost. To do this, 
we’re going to need some data. Whenever you see a section in this textbook titled 
“Evidence-Based Economics,” you’ll know that we are using data to analyze an 
economic question.
In 2013, Web users worldwide spent 250 million hours on Facebook each day. On 
a per person basis, each of the nearly 1 billion Facebook users allocated an average of 
15 minutes per day to the site. College students used Facebook more intensively. The 
average college student spent about an hour per day on Facebook.

We estimate that the time spent worldwide on Facebook has an average opportunity 
cost of $5 per hour. We generated this estimate with a back-of-the-envelope—in other 
words, approximate—calculation that averages together every Facebook user’s opportu-
nity cost.
Here’s how we did the calculation. First, we assume that users in the developed 
world—which represents wealthy countries such as France, Japan, and the United 
States—have an opportunity cost of $9 per hour, which is a typical minimum wage in 
a developed country. Employers are legally required to pay at least the minimum wage, 
and most workers in developed countries get paid much more than this. Even people 
who choose not to work still value their time, since it can be used for lots of good things 
like napping, texting, dating, studying, playing angry birds, and watching movies. It’s 
reasonable to guess that these nonworkers—for instance, students—will also have an 
opportunity cost of at least the minimum wage.
Second, we assume that Facebook users in the developing world—which represents 
all countries, except the developed countries—have a relatively lower opportunity cost 
of time. We assume that Facebook users in the developing countries have an opportunity 
cost of $1 per hour—for instance, their employment opportunities are far less favorable 
than those in the developed world.
To evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates, ask yourself this question: “How 
much would someone need to pay you to take away an hour of your free time?” Does 
your answer correspond more closely to our estimate for the developed world ($9/hour) 
or the developing world ($1/hour)?
About half of Facebook users live in developed countries and half live in developing 
countries, so, given our assumptions, the average opportunity cost is (1/2) × $9 + (1/2) × 
$1 = $5 per hour. Accordingly, the total opportunity cost of time spent on Facebook is 
calculated by multiplying the total number of hours spent on Facebook each day, by the 
average opportunity cost of time per hour:
a 250 million hours
day
b a $5
hour b = a $1.25 billion
day
b .
Multiplying this by 365 days per year yields an annualized opportunity cost of over 
$450 billion. This is an estimate of the cost of Facebook. As you have seen, this is only 
a crude approximation, since we can’t directly observe the opportunity cost of each 
person’s time.
We can also think about this calculation another way. If people had substituted their 
time on Facebook for work with average pay of $5 per hour, the world economy would 
have produced about $450 billion more measured output in 2013. This is more than the 
annual economic output of Austria.
Finally, we can also estimate the opportunity cost of a typical U.S. college student 
who spends 1 hour per day on Facebook. Assuming that this student’s opportunity cost 
is equal to $10 per hour, the opportunity cost is $3,650 per year.
($10/hour) × (365 hours/year) = $3,650 per year.
We chose $10 per hour for the opportunity cost, since the median before-tax wage of  
16- to 24-year-old U.S. workers was $11.35 per hour in 2013, and such low-income 
workers don’t pay much in taxes.
So far, we have gone through a purely positive economic analysis, describing the fre-
quency of Facebook usage and the trade-offs that this usage implies. None of this analy-
sis, however, answers the related question: Are Facebook and other social networking 
sites worth it? We’ve seen that the time spent on sites like these is costly because it has 
valuable alternative uses. But Facebook users are deriving substantial benefits that may 
justify this allocation of time. For example, social networking sites keep us up-to-date

on the activities of our friends and family. They facilitate the formation of new friend-
ships and new connections. And Facebook and similar sites are entertaining.
Because we cannot easily quantify these benefits, we’re going to leave that analysis 
to you. Economists won’t tell you what to do, but we will help you identify the trade-
offs that you are making in your decisions. Here is how an economist would summarize 
the normative question that is on the table:
Assuming a $10 per hour opportunity cost, the opportunity cost of using ­Facebook 
for an hour per day is $3,650 per year. Do you receive benefits from ­Facebook that 
exceed this opportunity cost?
Economists don’t want to impose their tastes on other people. In the view of an econ-
omist, people who get big benefits from intensive use of Facebook should stay the 
course. Economists don’t want to dictate choices. Instead, we want economic agents 
to recognize the implicit trade-offs that are being made. Economists are interested in 
helping people make the best use of scarce resources like budgets of money and time. In 
many circumstances, people are already putting their resources to best use. Occasion-
ally, however, economic reasoning can help people make better choices.

Section 1.4   |  The Second Principle of Economics: Equilibrium
51
In most economic situations, you aren’t the only one trying to optimize. Other people’s 
behavior will influence what you decide to do. Economists think of the world as a group of 
economic agents who are interacting and influencing one another’s efforts at optimization. 
Recall that equilibrium is the special situation in which everyone is optimizing, so nobody 
would benefit personally by changing his or her own behavior.
An important clarification needs to accompany this definition. When we say that nobody 
would benefit personally by changing his or her own behavior, we mean that nobody ­believes 
they would benefit from such a change. In equilibrium, all economic agents are making their 
best feasible choices taking into account all of the information they have, including their 
beliefs about the behavior of others. We could rewrite the definition by saying that in equi-
librium, nobody perceives that they will benefit from changing their own behavior.
To build intuition—which means 
­understanding—for the concept of 
equilibrium, consider the length of 
the regular checkout lines at your 
local supermarket ­(ignore the ex-
press lines). If any line has a shorter 
wait than the others, optimizers will 
choose that line. If any line has a 
longer wait than the others, optimiz-
ers will avoid that line. So the short 
lines will attract shoppers, and the 
long lines will drive them away. And 
it’s not just the length of the lines 
that matters. You pick your line by 
estimating which line will move the 
fastest, which incorporates every-
thing that you can see, including the number of items in each person’s shopping cart. Econo-
mists say that “in equilibrium” all of the checkout lines will have roughly the same wait time. 
When the wait times are expected to be the same, no shopper has an incentive to switch lines. 
In other words, nobody perceives that they will benefit by changing their behavior.
Here’s another example. Suppose the market price of gasoline is $3/gallon and the gaso-
line market is in equilibrium. Three conditions will need to be satisfied.
	
1.	 The amount of gasoline produced by gasoline sellers—oil companies—will equal 
the amount of gasoline purchased by buyers.
	
2.	 Oil companies will only operate wells where they can extract oil and produce gaso-
line at a cost that is less than the market price of gasoline: $3/gallon.
	
3.	 The buyers of gasoline will only use it for activities that are worth at least  
$3/gallon—like driving to their best friend’s wedding—and they won’t use it for 
activities that are worth less than $3/gallon—like visiting their least favorite rela-
tives. When gas prices go up, who in the family can’t make it for Thanksgiving?
In equilibrium, both the sellers and the buyers of gasoline are optimizing, given the market 
price of gasoline. Nobody would benefit by changing his or her behavior.
In this book, we often study the behavior of groups of economic agents. A group 
could be 2 chess players; or 30 participants in an eBay auction; or millions of investors 
buying and selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange; or billions of households 
buying gasoline to fuel their tractors, trucks, mopeds, motorcycles, and cars. In all these 
cases, we study the equilibrium that emerges when all of these economic agents inter-
act. In other words, we examine these environments using the assumption that everyone 
is constantly simultaneously optimizing—for instance, at every move in a chess game 
and during every trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Economists believe that this

equilibrium analysis provides a good description of what actually happens when groups 
of people interact.
The Free-Rider Problem
Let’s use the concept of equilibrium to analyze an economic problem that may interest 
you: roommates. Assume that five roommates live in a rented house. The roommates can 
spend some of their free time contributing to the general well-being of the group by throw-
ing away used pizza boxes and soda cans and otherwise cleaning up after themselves. Or 
they can spend all their free time on activities that only benefit themselves—for instance, 
watching YouTube videos or listening to Pandora.
It would be beneficial to the group if everyone chipped in and did a little cleaning. But 
each of the five roommates has an incentive to leave that to others. If one roommate spends 
30 minutes doing the dishes, all the other roommates benefit without having to lift a finger. 
Consequently, rentals with lots of roommates are often a mess.
Lazy roommates are an example of something that economists call the free-rider prob-
lem. Most people want to let someone else do the dirty work. We would like to be the free 
riders who don’t contribute but still benefit from the investments that others make.
Sometimes free riders get away with it. When there are very few free riders and lots of 
contributors, the free riders might be overlooked. For example, a small number of people 
sneak onto public transportation without paying. These turnstile jumpers are such a small 
group that they don’t jeopardize the subway system. But if everyone started jumping turn-
stiles, the subway would soon run out of cash.
In the subway system, free riding is discouraged by security patrols. In rooming groups, 
free riding is discouraged by social pressure. Even with these “punishment” techniques, 
free riding is sometimes a problem because it’s not easy to catch the free rider in the act. 
It’s possible to slip over a turnstile in a quiet subway station. It’s easy to leave crumbs on 
the couch when nobody is watching.
People’s private benefits are often out of sync with the pub-
lic interest. Jumping the subway turnstile is cheaper than pay-
ing for a subway ticket. Watching YouTube is more fun than 
sweeping up the remains of last night’s party. Equilibrium 
analysis helps us predict the behavior of groups of people and 
understand why free riding occurs. People sometimes pursue 
their own private interests and don’t contribute voluntarily to 
the public interest. Unfortunately, selfless acts—like those of 
a war hero—are exceptional, and selfish acts are more com-
mon. When people in a group act, each member of the group 
might do what’s best for himself or herself instead of acting 
in a way that optimizes the well-being of the entire group.
Equilibrium analysis helps us design special ­institutions—
like financial contracts—that reduce or even eliminate free 
riding. For example, what would happen in the rooming 
group if everyone agreed to pay $5 per week so the room-
mates could hire a cleaning service? It would be easier to enforce $5 weekly payments than 
to monitor compliance with the rule “clean up after yourself, even when nobody is here 
to watch you.” Pizza crumbs don’t have name tags. So equilibrium analysis explains why 
individuals often fail to serve the interest of the group and how the incentive structure can 
be redesigned to fix these problems.
A free rider in the New York 
subway system. Are you paying 
for him to ride the subway?
Economists test their ideas with data. We call such evidence-based analysis, empirical 
analysis or empiricism. Economists use data to determine whether our theories about hu-
man behavior—like optimization and equilibrium—match up with actual human behavior.

Of course, we want to know if our theories fail to explain what is happening in the world. In 
that case, we need to go back to the drawing board and come up with better theories. That 
is how economic science, and science in general, progresses.
Economists are also interested in understanding what is causing things to happen in the 
world. We can illustrate what causation is—and is not—via a simple example. Hot days 
and crowded beaches tend to occur at the same time of the year. What is the cause and what 
is the effect here? It is, of course, that hot days cause people to go swimming. It is not that 
swimming causes the outside air temperature to rise.
But there are other cases when cause and effect are hard to untangle. Does being rela-
tively smart cause people to go to college? Or does going to college cause people to be 
relatively smart? Or do both directions of causation apply?
We’ll come back to the topic of empiricism in general, and causality in particular, in 
great detail in Chapter 2. Sometimes causes are easy to determine but sometimes identify-
ing cause and effect requires great ingenuity.
Is taking this course good for you? Let’s start by thinking about the costs. Though oppor-
tunity costs are often hard to see, they are still important. The key opportunity cost of this 
course is another course that you won’t be able to take during the time spent as a student. 
What other course did economics crowd out? Japanese history? Biochemistry? Russian 
poetry? If you are taking the two-semester version of this course, then you need to consider 
the two other courses that economics is crowding out.
Now consider the benefits of an economics education. The benefits come in a few dif-
ferent forms, but the biggest benefit is the ability to apply economic reasoning in your daily 
life. Whether you are deciding how much to spend on a date, where to go on vacation, or 
how to keep an apartment with four other roommates clean, economic reasoning will im-
prove the quality of your decisions. These benefits will continue throughout your life as 
you make important decisions, such as where to invest your retirement savings and how to 
secure the best mortgage.
Most decisions are guided by the logic of costs and benefits. 
Accordingly, you can use positive economic analysis to predict 
other people’s behavior. Economics illuminates and clarifies all 
human behavior.
We also want you to use economic principles when you give 
other people advice and when you make your own choices. This 
is normative economics. Learning how to make good choices is 
the biggest benefit you’ll realize from learning economics. That’s 
why we have built our book around the concept of decision making. Looking at the world 
through the economic lens puts you at an enormous advantage throughout your life.
We also think that economics is a lot of fun. Understanding people’s motivations is 
­fascinating, particularly because there are many surprising insights along the way.
To realize these payoffs, you’ll need to connect the ideas in this textbook to the eco-
nomic activities around you. To make those connections, keep a few tips in mind:
• You can apply economic tools such as trade-offs and cost-benefit analysis to any 
economic decision. Learn to use them in your own daily decisions. This will help you 
master the tools and also appreciate their limitations.
• Even if you are not in the midst of making a decision, you will learn a lot of econom-
ics by keeping your eyes open when you walk through any environment in which 
people are using or exchanging resources. Think like an economist the next time 
you find yourself in a supermarket, a used car dealership, a soccer match, or a poker 
game.
• The easiest way to encounter economic ideas is to keep up with what’s happen-
ing in the world. Go online and read a national newspaper like the New York Times 
or the Wall Street Journal. News magazines will also do the job. There’s even a 
newsmagazine called The Economist, which is required reading for prime ministers

Economics is the study of how agents choose to allocate scarce resources 
and how those choices affect society. Economics can be divided into two kinds 
of analysis: positive economic analysis (what people actually do) and normative 
economic analysis (what people ought to do). There are two key topics within 
economics: microeconomics (individual decisions and individual markets) and 
macroeconomics (the total economy).
Economics is based on three key principles: optimization, equilibrium, and 
empiricism.
Choosing the best feasible option, given the available information, is 
optimization. To optimize, an economic agent needs to consider many issues, 
including trade-offs, budget constraints, opportunity costs, and cost-benefit 
analysis.
Equilibrium is a situation in which nobody would benefit personally by 
changing his or her own behavior.
Economists test their ideas with data. We call such evidence-based analysis 
empirical analysis or empiricism. Economists use data to determine whether 
our theories about human behavior—like optimization and equilibrium—match 
actual human behavior. Economists also use data to determine what is causing 
things to happen in the world.

that they should bribe the maître d’ to get a table.
	
a.	 What factors should they consider when they are de-
ciding how high to make their bribe?
	
b.	 Jerry, Elaine, and George had tickets for a movie after 
dinner. How would this have affected the amount that 
they were willing to pay as a bribe?
	
c.	 The amount that they finally decide to pay is higher 
than the value of the meal that they would have had. 
Does this mean that they are being irrational?

	 2.	 You are thinking about buying a house. You find one you 
like that costs $200,000. You learn that your bank will 
give you a mortgage for $160,000 and that you will have 
to use all of your savings to make the down payment of 
$40,000. You calculate that the mortgage payments, prop-
erty taxes, insurance, maintenance, and utilities would to-
tal $950 per month. Is $950 the cost of owning the house? 
What important factor(s) have you left out of your calcu-
lation of the cost of ownership?

displaying an equilibrium price of $2 per kilogram. 
Based on this situation, what is your understanding of 
optimization?

1 hour. The same trip takes 5 hours by bus. The train costs 
€80 and the bus €20. When Alain is not traveling he can 
work and earn €25 per hour. 
	
a.	 What are the opportunity costs of traveling by bus and 
train for Alan?

out to be lovely on their wedding day. Do you think 
your friends were being rational when they made their 
wedding plans? Explain. 
	
b.	 You usually have to see a doctor several times each 
year. You decided to buy health insurance at the start

i.	 You can either stand during a college football game 
or you can sit. You believe that you will see the game 
very well if you stand and others sit but that you will 
not be able to see at all if you sit and others stand. You 
therefore decide to stand.
	
ii.	 Your friend tells you that he expects many people to 
stand at football games.
	
iii.	 An economist studies photos of many college football 
games and estimates that 75 percent of all fans stand 
and 25 percent sit.
	
	 Which of these statements deals with optimization, which 
deals with equilibrium, and which deals with empiricism? 
Explain.
	 7.	 John can either drive himself to the airport or take a cab. 
Driving a distance of 20 kilometers to the airport might 
be exhausting for him, especially since he expects to run 
into rush-hour traffic. On the other hand, if he takes a 
cab, he would be relying on the driver to get him to the 
airport and it will cost him a little more. Using the cost-
benefit analysis, help John decide what he should do.
	 8.	 This chapter discussed the free-rider problem. Consider 
the following two situations in relation to the free-rider 
concept.
	
a.	 The Taft-Hartley Act (1947) allows workers to be 
employed at a firm without joining the union at their 
workplace or paying membership fees to the union. 
This arrangement is known as an open shop. Con-
sidering that unions negotiate terms of employment 
and wages on behalf of all the workers at a firm, why 
do you think that most unions are opposed to open 
shops?
	
b.	 For your business communication class, you are sup-
posed to work on a group assignment in a team of six. 
You soon realize that a few of your team members 
do not contribute to the assignment but get the same 
grade as the rest of the team. If you were the profes-
sor, how would you redesign the incentive structure 
here to fix this problem?

If you are reading this book, there is a good 
chance that you are either in college or think-
ing about taking the plunge. As you know, 
college is a big investment. Tuition averages 
almost $2,500 per year at community  
colleges, almost $5,000 per year at public  
colleges, and almost $25,000 per year at  
private colleges. And that’s not the only cost. 
Your time, as we have seen, is worth $10 or 
more per hour—this time value adds at least 
$20,000 per year to the opportunity cost of a 
college education.
As with any other investment, you’d like to 
know how a college education is going to pay 
you back. What are the “returns to education,” 
and how would you measure them? In this 
chapter you’ll see that you can answer such 
questions with models and data.
Is college  
worth it?

Recall that empiricism—using data to analyze the world—is the third key principle of 
economics. We explored the first two principles—optimization and equilibrium—in the 
previous chapter. Empiricism is the focus of this chapter.
Empiricism is at the heart of all scientific analysis. The scientific method is the name 
for the ongoing process that economists, other social scientists, and natural scientists 
use to:
	
1.	 Develop models of the world
	
2.	 Test those models with data—evaluating the match between the models and the data
Economists do not expect this process to reveal the “true” model of the world, since the 
world is vastly complex. However, economists do expect to identify models that are use-
ful in understanding the world. Testing with data enables economists to separate the good 
models—those that approximately match the data—from the bad models. When a model 
is overwhelmingly inconsistent with the data, economists try to fix the model or replace it 
­altogether. We believe that this process enables us to find more useful models that help to 
explain the past and to predict the future with some confidence. In this section, we ­explain 
what a model is and how a model can be tested with data.
Models and Data
Everyone once believed that the earth was flat. We now know that it is more like a beach 
ball than a Frisbee. Yet the flat-earth model is still actively used. Go into a gas station and 
you’ll find only flat road maps for sale. Consult your GPS receiver and you’ll also see flat 
maps. Nobody keeps a globe in the glove compartment.
Flat maps and spherical globes are both models of the surface 
of the earth. A model is a simplified description, or representation, 
of the world. Because models are simplified, they are not perfect 
replicas of reality. Obviously, flat maps are not perfectly accurate 
models of the surface of the earth—they distort the ­curvature. If 
you are flying from New York to Tokyo, the curvature matters. 
But if you are touring around New York City, you don’t need to 
worry about the fact that the earth is shaped like a sphere.
Scientists—and commuters—use the model that is best suited to analyze the problem at 
hand. Even if a model/map is based on assumptions that are known to be false, like flatness 
of the earth, the model may still help us to make good predictions and good plans for the

Exhibit 2.1 Flying from 
New York to Tokyo 
Requires More Than a  
Flat Map
This flat map is a model of 
part of the earth’s surface. It 
treats the world as ­perfectly 
flat, which leads the map 
maker to exaggerate 
­distances in the northern 
latitudes. It is useful for cer-
tain purposes—for instance, 
learning geography. But 
you wouldn’t want to use 
it to find the best air route 
across the Pacific Ocean. 
For example, the shortest 
flight path from New York 
to Tokyo is not a straight 
line through San Francisco. 
Instead, the shortest path 
goes through Northern 
Alaska! The flat-earth model 
is well suited for some tasks 
(geography lessons) and ill-
suited for others (interconti-
nental flight navigation).

Subway Map
This is a model of the sub-
way system in New York

for example, it treats New 
York City as a perfectly flat 
surface and it also distorts 
the shape of the city—but 
it is nevertheless very useful 
for commuters and tourists.
future. It is more important for a model to be simple and useful than it is for a model to be 
precisely accurate.
All scientific models make predictions that can be checked with data—facts, measure-
ments, or statistics that describe the world. Recall from Chapter 1 that economists often de-
scribe themselves as empiricists, or say that we practice empiricism, because we use data

to create empirical evidence. These terms all boil down to the same basic idea: using data to 
answer questions about the world and using data to test models. For example, we could test the 
New York City subway map by actually riding the subway and checking the map’s accuracy.
When conducting empirical analysis, economists refer to a model’s predictions as 
­hypotheses. Whenever such hypotheses are contradicted by the available data, economists 
return to the drawing board and try to come up with a better model that yields new hypotheses.
An Economic Model
Let’s consider an example of an economic model. We’re going to study an extremely sim-
ple model to get the ball rolling. But even economic models that are far more complicated 
than this example are also highly simplified descriptions of reality.
All economic models begin with assumptions. Consider the following assumption about 
the returns to education: Investing in one extra year of education increases your future 
wages by 10 percent. Let’s put the assumption to work to generate a model that relates a 
person’s level of education to her wages.
Increasing a wage by 10 percent is the same as multiplying the wage by 1 + 0.10 = 1.10.  
The returns-to-education assumption implies that someone with an extra year of education 
earns 1.10 times as much as she would have earned without the extra year of education. For 
example, if someone would earn $15 per hour with 13 years of education, then a 14th year 
of education will cause her hourly wage to rise to 1.10 × $15, or $16.50.
Economists use assumptions to derive other implications. For example, the returns-to-­
education assumption implies that two additional years of education will increase earnings by 
10 percent twice over—once for each extra year of education—producing a 21 percent total 
increase.
1.10 × 1.10 = 1.21.
Consider another example. Four additional years of education will increase earnings by  
10 percent four times over, implying a 46 percent total increase.
1.10 × 1.10 × 1.10 × 1.10 = (1.10)4 = 1.46.
This implies that going to college would increase a college graduate’s income by 46 ­percent 
compared to what she would have been paid if she had ended her education after finish-
ing high school. In other words, a prediction—or hypothesis—of the model is that college 
graduates will earn 46 percent more than high school graduates.
In principle, we can apply this analysis to any number of years of education. We there-
fore have a general model that relates people’s educational attainment to their income. The 
model that we have derived is referred to as the returns-to-education model. It describes 
the economic payoff of more education—in other words, the “return” on your educational 
investment. Most economic models are much, much more complex than this. In most eco-
nomic models, it takes pages of mathematical analysis to derive the implications of the 
assumptions. Nevertheless, this simple model is a good starting point for our discussion. It 
illustrates two important properties of all models.
First, a model is an approximation. The model does not predict that everyone would in-
crease their future wages by exactly 10 percent if they obtained an extra year of education. 
The predicted relationship between education and future wages is an average ­relationship—
it is an approximation for what is predicted to happen for most people in most circum-
stances. The model overlooks lots of special considerations. For example, the final year of 
college probably does much more to increase your wages than the ­second-to-last year of 
college, because that final year earns you the official degree, which is a key item on your 
resumé. Likewise, your college major importantly impacts how much you will earn after 
college. Those who major in economics, for example, tend to earn more than graduates in 
most other majors. Our simple model overlooks many such subtleties. Just as a flat subway 
map is only an approximation of the features of a city, the returns-to-education model is 
only an approximation of the mapping from years of education to wages.
Second, a model makes predictions that can be tested with data­—in this case, data on 
people’s education and earnings. We are now ready to use some data to actually evaluate 
the predictions of the returns-to-education model.
Empirical evidence is a set of facts 
established by observation and 
measurement.
Hypotheses are predictions 
(typically generated by a model) that 
can be tested with data.

Evidence-Based Economics
T
o put the model to the test we need data, which we obtain from the Current Popula-
tion Survey (CPS), a government data source. This survey collects data on wages, 
education, and many other characteristics of the general population and is avail-
able to anyone who wants to use it. When data are available to the general public, they 
are called “public-use data.”
Exhibit 2.3 summarizes the average annual earnings for our test. The returns- 
to-education model does not match the data perfectly. The exhibit shows that for 
30-year-old U.S. workers with 12 years of education, which is equivalent to a high 
school diploma, the average yearly salary is $32,941. For 30-year-old U.S. workers with 
16 years of education, which is equivalent to graduation from a four-year college, the 
average salary is $51,780.
If we simply divide these two average wages—college wage over high school 
wage—the ratio is 1.57.
average salary of 30­year­olds with 16 years of education
average salary of 30­year­olds with 12 years of education = $51,780
$32,941 = 1.57.
Recall that the returns-to-education model says that each additional year of education 
raises the wage by 10 percent, so four extra years of education should raise the wage by 
a factor of (1.10)4 = 1.46.
We can see that the model does not exactly match the data. Going from 12 years of edu-
cation to 16 years is associated with a 57 percent increase in income. However, the model 
is not far off—the model predicted a 46 percent increase.
Q: How much more do workers with a college education earn?

Means
You may wonder how the data from the CPS can be used to calculate the wages reported 
above. We used the concept of the mean, or average. The mean (or average) is the sum of 
all the different values divided by the number of values and is a commonly used technique 
for summarizing data. Statisticians and other scientists use the terms mean and average 
interchangeably.
We can quickly show how the mean works in a small example. Say that there are five 
people: Mr. Kwon, Ms. Littleton, Mr. Locke, Ms. Reye, and Mr. Shephard, each with a 
different hourly wage:
    Kwon = $26 per hour,
 Littleton = $24 per hour,
   Locke = $8 per hour,
     Reye = $35 per hour,
Shephard = $57 per hour.
If we add the five wages together and divide by 5, we calculate a mean wage of  
$30 per hour.
$26 + $24 + $8 + $35 + $57
5
= $30.
This analysis of a small sample illustrates the idea of calculating a mean, but con-
vincing data analysis in economics relies on using a large sample. For example, a typi-
cal economic research paper uses data gathered from thousands of individuals. So a key 
strength of economic analysis is the amount of data used. Earlier we didn’t rely on a hand-
ful of observations to argue that education raises earnings. Instead, we used data from 
more than thousands of surveyed 30-year-olds. Using lots of data—economists call them 
observations—­strengthens the force of an empirical argument because the researcher can 
make more precise statements.
To show you how to make convincing empirical arguments, this course uses lots of real 
data from large groups of people. Credible empirical arguments, based on many observa-
tions, are a key component of the scientific method.
Argument by Anecdote
Education is not destiny. There are some people with lots of education who earn very little. 
There are some people with little education who earn a lot. When we wrote this book, Bill 
Gates, a Harvard dropout who founded Microsoft, was the richest man in the world. Mark 
Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO, also dropped out of Harvard.
With these two examples in mind, it is tempting to conclude that dropping out of col-
lege is a great path to success. However, it is a mistake to use two anecdotes, or any small 
sample of people, to try to judge a statistical relationship.
Here’s another example of how the amount of data can make a big difference. Exhibit 2.4  
plots data from just two people. They are both 30-years-old. As you can see, the ­exhibit 
does not reproduce the positive relationship between education and earnings that is plot-
ted in ­Exhibit 2.3. Instead, it looks as though rising education is associated with falling 
earnings. But the pattern in Exhibit 2.4 is far from shocking given that it plots only two 
people. Indeed, if you study two randomly chosen 30-year-olds, there is a 25 percent 
chance that the person with only a high school diploma has higher earnings than the 
person with a four-year college degree. This fact highlights that there is much more than 
education that determines your earnings, although getting a college degree will usually 
help make you money.
When you look at only a small amount of data, it is easy to jump to the wrong conclu-
sion. Keep this warning in mind the next time a newspaper columnist tries to convince 
you of something by using a few anecdotes. If the columnist backs up her story with data 
­reflecting the experiences of thousands of people, then she has done her job and may de-
serve to win the argument. But if she rests her case after sharing a handful of anecdotes, 
remain skeptical. Be doubly skeptical if you suspect that the anecdotes have been carefully 
The mean, or average, is the sum 
of all the different values divided by 
the number of values.

selected to prove the columnist’s point. Argument by anecdote should not be taken too 
seriously.
There is one exception to this rule. Argument by example is appropriate when you are 
contradicting a blanket statement. For example, if someone asserts that every National 
Basketball Association (NBA) player has to be tall, just one counterexample is enough 
to prove this statement wrong. In this case, your proof would be Tyrone Bogues, a 5-foot 
3-inch dynamo who played in the NBA for 14 years.
Does jogging cause people to 
be healthy? Does good health 
cause people to jog? In fact 
both kinds of causation are 
­simultaneously true.
Exhibit 2.4 Annual Earnings for Two 
30-Year-Old Americans by Education
Even though Exhibit 2.3 taught us 
that the average annual earnings 
of college graduates is 57 percent 
higher than those of high school 
graduates, it is not difficult to find 
specific examples where a high 
school graduate is actually earning 
more than a college graduate. Here 
we learn of one such example: the 
high school graduate earns  
$45,000 per year, whereas the  
college graduate earns $35,000.

Using our large data set on wages and years of education, we’ve seen that on average 
wages rise roughly 10 percent for every year of additional education. Does this mean that 
if we could encourage a student to stay in school one extra year, that would cause that indi-
vidual’s future wages to rise 10 percent? Not necessarily. Let’s think about why this is not 
always the case with an example.
The Red Ad Campaign Blues
Assume that Walmart has hired you as a consultant. You have developed a hypothesis about 
ad campaigns: you believe that campaigns using the color red are good at catching people’s 
attention. To test your hypothesis, you assemble empirical evidence from historical ad cam-
paigns, including the color of the ad campaign and how revenue at Walmart changed during 
the campaign.
Your empirical research confirms your hypothesis! Sales go up 25 percent during cam-
paigns with lots of red images. Sales go up only 5 percent during campaigns with lots of 
blue images. You race to the chief executive officer (CEO) to report this remarkable result. 
You are a genius! Unfortunately, the CEO instantly fires you.
What did the CEO notice that you missed?
The red-themed campaigns were mostly concentrated during the Christmas season. 
The blue-themed campaigns were mostly spread out over the rest of the year. In the  
CEO’s words,
The red colors in our advertising don’t cause an increase in our revenue. Christmas 
causes an increase in our revenue. Christmas also causes an increase in the use of red in 
our ads. If we ran blue ads in December our holiday season revenue would still rise by 
about 25 percent.
Causation and Correlation

2.1

Section 2.2  |  Causation and Correlation

Think of causation as the path from 
cause to effect.
Unfortunately, this is actually a true story, though we’ve changed the details—including 
the name of the firm—to protect our friends. We return, in the appendix, to a related story 
where the CEO was not as sharp as the CEO in this story.
Causation versus Correlation
People often mistake causation for correlation. Causation occurs 
when one thing directly affects another. You can think of it as the 
path from cause to effect: putting a snowball in a hot oven causes 
it to melt.
Correlation means that there is a mutual relationship between 
two things—as one thing changes, the other changes as well. 
There is some kind of connection. It might be cause and effect, 
but correlation can also arise when causation is not present. For example, as it turns out stu-
dents who take music courses in high school score better on their SATs than students who 
do not take music courses in high school. Some educators have argued that this relationship 
is causal: more music courses cause higher SAT scores.
Yet, before you buy a clarinet for your younger sibling, you should know that research-
ers have shown that students who already would have scored high on their SATs are more 
likely to also have enrolled in music classes. There is something else—being a good  
student—that causes high SAT scores and enrollment in music. SAT scores and taking 
music courses are only correlated; if a trombone player’s arm were broken and she had to 
drop out of music class, this would not cause her future SAT scores to fall. When two things 
are correlated, it suggests that causation may be possible and that further investigation is 
warranted—it’s only the beginning of the story, not the end.
Correlations are divided into three categories: positive correlation, negative corre-
lation, and zero correlation. Economists refer to some factor, like a household’s income, 
as a ­variable. Positive correlation implies that two variables tend to move in the same 
­direction—for example, surveys reveal that people who have a relatively high income are 
more likely to be married than people who have a relatively low income. In this situation 
we say that the variables of income and marital status are positively correlated. ­Negative 
­correlation ­implies that the two variables tend to move in opposite directions—for ­example, 
people with a high level of education are less likely to be unemployed. In this situation we 
say that the variables of education and unemployment are negatively correlated. When two 
variables are not related, we say that they have a zero correlation. The number of friends you 
have likely has no relation to whether your address is on the odd or even side of the street. 
When Correlation Does Not Imply Causality  There are two reasons why we should 
not jump to the conclusion that a correlation between two variables implies a particular 
causal relationship:
	
1.	 Omitted variables
	
2.	 Reverse causality
An omitted variable is something that has been left out of a study that, if included, would 
explain why two variables are correlated. Recall that the amount of red content in Walmart’s 
ads is positively correlated with the growth rate of Walmart’s sales. However, the red color 
does not necessarily cause Walmart’s sales to rise. The arrival of the Christmas season 
causes Walmart’s ads to be red and the Christmas season also causes Walmart’s month-
over-month sales revenue to rise. The Christmas season is an omitted variable that explains 
why red ads tend to occur at around the time that sales tend to rise. (See Exhibit 2.5.)
Is there also an omitted variable that explains why education and income are positively cor-
related? One possible factor might be an individual’s tendency to work hard. What if workahol-
ics tend to thrive in college more than others? Perhaps pulling all-nighters to write term papers 
allows them to do well in their courses. Workaholics also tend to earn more money than others 
because workaholics tend to stay late on the job and work on weekends. Does workaholism 
cause you to earn more and, incidentally, to graduate from college rather than drop out? Or 
does staying in college cause you to earn those higher wages? What is cause and what is effect?
Reverse causality is another problem that plagues our efforts to distinguish  
correlation and causation. Reverse causality is the situation in which we mix up the 
Causation occurs when one thing 
directly affects another through a 
cause-and-effect relationship.
A correlation means that there is 
a mutual relationship between two 
things.
A variable is a factor that is likely to 
change or vary.
Positive correlation implies that two 
variables tend to move in the same 
direction.
Negative correlation implies 
that two variables tend to move 
in opposite directions. When the 
variables have movements that are 
not related, we say that the variables 
have zero correlation.
An omitted variable is something 
that has been left out of a study 
that, if included, would explain why 
two variables that are in the study 
are correlated.
Reverse causality occurs when we 
mix up the direction of cause and 
effect.

Cause: Christmas
Effect: red ads
Effect: rising revenue
(Omitted variable)
An experiment is a controlled 
method of investigating causal 
relationships among variables.
Randomization is the assignment 
of subjects by chance, rather than 
by choice, to a treatment group or 
control group.
Exhibit 2.5 An Example of an Omitted 
Variable
The amount of red content in Walmart’s 
ads is positively correlated with the growth 
of Walmart’s revenue. In other words, 
when ads are red-themed, Walmart’s 
­month-over-month sales revenue tends 
to grow the fastest. However, the redness 
does not cause Walmart’s revenue to rise. 
The Christmas season causes Walmart’s ads 
to be red and the Christmas season also 
causes Walmart’s sales revenue to rise. The 
Christmas season is the omitted ­variable 
that explains the positive ­correlation 
­between red ads and revenue growth.
direction of cause and effect. For example, consider the fact that relatively wealthy people 
tend to be relatively healthy too. This has led some social scientists to conclude that greater 
wealth causes better health—for instance, wealthy people can afford better healthcare. On 
the other hand, there may be reverse causality: better health may cause greater wealth. For 
example, healthy people can work harder and have fewer healthcare expenditures than less 
healthy people. It turns out that both causal channels seem to exist: greater wealth causes 
better health and better health causes greater wealth!
In our analysis of the returns to education, could it be that reverse causality is at play: 
higher wages at age 30 cause you to get more education at age 20? We can logically rule 
this out. Assuming that you don’t have a time machine, it is unlikely that your wage as a 
30-year-old causes you to obtain more education in your 20s. So in the returns-to-education 
example, reverse causality is probably not a problem. But in many other analyses—for 
­example, the wealth-health relationship—reverse causality is a key consideration.
Economists have developed a rich set of tools to determine what is causation and what 
is only correlation. We turn to some of these tools next.
Experimental Economics and Natural Experiments
One method of determining cause and effect is to run an experiment—a controlled method 
of investigating causal relationships among variables. Though you may not read much 
about economic experiments in the newspaper, headlines for experiments in the field of 
medicine are common. For example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires 
pharmaceutical companies to run carefully designed experiments to provide evidence that 
new drugs work before they are approved for general public use.
To run an experiment, researchers usually create a treatment (test) group and a con-
trol group. Participants are assigned randomly to participate either as a member of the 
treatment group or as a member of the control group—a process called randomization. 
­Randomization is the assignment of subjects by chance, rather than by choice, to a treat-
ment group or to a control group. The treatment group and the control group are treated 
identically, except along a single dimension that is intentionally varied across the two 
groups. The impact of this variation is the focus of the experiment.
If we want to know whether a promising new medicine helps patients with diabetes, we 
could take 1,000 patients with diabetes and randomly place 500 of them into a treatment 
group—those who receive the new medicine. The other 500 patients would be in the control 
group and receive the standard diabetes medications that are already widely used. Then, we 
would follow all of the patients and see how their health changes over the next few years. This 
experiment would test the causal hypothesis that the new drug is better than the old drug.
Now, consider an economics experiment. Suppose that we want to know what difference 
a college degree makes. We could take 1,000 high school students who cannot afford college, 
but who want to attend college, and randomly place 500 of them into a treatment group where 
2.2

2.3
they had all of their college expenses paid. The other 500 students would be placed in the 
control group. Then, we would keep track of all of the original 1,000 ­students—including the 
500 control group students who weren’t able to go to college ­because they couldn’t afford it. 
We would use periodic surveys during their adult lives to see how the wages in the group that 
got a college education compare with the wages of the group that did not attend college. This 
experiment would test the hypothesis that a college education causes wages to rise.
One problem with experimentation is that experiments can sometimes be very costly to 
conduct. For instance, the college-attendance experiment that we just described would cost 
tens of millions of dollars, because the researchers would need to pay the college fees for 
500 students. Another problem is that experiments do not provide immediate answers to 
some important questions. For example, learning about how one more year of education af-
fects wages over the entire working life would take many decades if we ran an experiment 
on high school students today.
Another problem is that experiments are sometimes run poorly. For example, if medical 
researchers do not truly randomize the assignment of patients to medical treatments, then 
the experiment may not teach us anything at all. For instance, if patients who go to cutting-
edge research hospitals tend to be the ones who get prescribed the newest kind of diabetes 
medication, then we don’t know whether the new medication caused those patients to get 
better or whether it was some other thing that their fancy hospitals did that actually caused 
the patients’ health to improve. In a well-designed experiment, randomization alone would 
determine who got the new medicine and who got the old medicine.
When research is badly designed, economists tend to be very skeptical of its conclu-
sions. We say “garbage in, garbage out” to capture the idea that bad research methods 
invalidate a study’s conclusions.
If we don’t have the budget or time to run an experiment, how else can we identify cause 
and effect? One approach is to study historical data that has been generated by a “natural” 
experiment. A natural experiment is an empirical study in which some process—out of 
the control of the experimenter—has assigned subjects to control and treatment groups in 
a random or nearly random way.
Economists have found and exploited natural experiments to answer numerous major 
questions. This methodology can be very useful in providing a more definitive answer to 
our question at hand: What are you getting from your education?
A natural experiment is an 
empirical study in which some

Evidence-Based Economics
M
any decades ago, compulsory schooling laws were much more permissive, al-
lowing teenagers to drop out well before they graduated from high school. 
Philip Oreopoulos studied a natural experiment that was created by a change 
in these compulsory schooling laws.1 Oreopoulos looked at an educational reform in 
the United Kingdom in 1947, which increased the minimum school leaving age from  
14 to 15. As a result of this change, the fraction of children dropping out of school by age  
14 fell by 50 percentage points between 1946 and 1948.
In this way, those kids reaching age 14 before 1947 are a “control group” for those 
reaching age 14 after 1947. Oreopoulos found that the students who turned 14 in 1948 
and were therefore compelled to stay in school one extra year earned 10 percent more 
on average than the students who turned 14 in 1946.
Natural experiments are a very useful source of data in empirical economics. In many 
problems, they help us separate correlation from causation. Applied to the returns to 
education, they suggest that the correlation between years of education and higher in-
come is not due to some omitted variable, but reflects the causal influence of education.

Household Survey. Compare 
kids in the United Kingdom 
who were allowed to drop 
out of school at age 14 with

schooling laws.
Factors other than the change 
in the compulsory schooling 
laws might explain why the 
kids who were compelled 
to stay in school eventually 
earned more in the workforce

­omitted variable).
How much do wages increase 
when an individual is com-
pelled by law to get an extra 
year of schooling?
Economists like to think about our research as a process in which we pose and answer ques-
tions. We’ve already seen a couple of these questions. For example, in the current chapter, we 
asked, “How much do wages increase when an individual is compelled by law to get an extra 
year of schooling?” and in Chapter 1, we asked, “What is the opportunity cost of your time?”
Good questions come in many different forms. But the most exciting economic ques-
tions share two properties.
	
1.	 Good questions address topics that are important to individual economic agents 
and/or to our society. Economists tend to think about economic research as some-
thing that contributes to society’s welfare. We try to pursue research that has general 
implications for human behavior or economic performance. For example, under-
standing the returns to education is important because individuals invest a lot of 
resources obtaining an education. The United States spends nearly a tenth of its eco-
nomic output on education—$1.5 trillion per year. It is useful to quantify the payoffs 
from all this investment. If the returns to education are very high, society may want to 
encourage even more educational investment. If the returns to education are low, we 
should share this important fact with students who are deciding whether or not to stay 
in school. Knowing the returns to education will help individuals and governments 
decide how much of their scarce resources to allocate to educational investment.
	
2.	 Good economic questions can be answered. In some other disciplines, posing a good 
question is enough. For example, philosophers believe that some of the most impor-
tant questions don’t have answers. In contrast, economists are primarily interested in 
questions that can be answered with enough hard work and careful reasoning.
Here are some of the economic questions that we discuss in this book. As you look over 
the set, you will see that these are big questions with significant implications for you and 
for society as a whole. The rest of this book sets out to discover answers to these questions. 
We believe the journey will be exhilarating—so let’s get started!

Summary
The scientific method is the name for the ongoing process that economists 
and other scientists use to (a) develop ­mathematical models of the world and 
(b) test those models with data.
Empirical evidence is a set of facts established by observation and 
measurement, which are used to evaluate a model.
Economists try to uncover causal relationships among variables.
One method to determine causality is to run an experiment—a controlled 
method of investigating causal relationships among variables. Economists now 
actively pursue experiments both in the laboratory and in the field. Economists 
also study historical data that have been generated by a natural experiment to 
infer causality.

Problems
	 1.	 This chapter talks about means. The median is a closely 
related concept. The median is the numerical value sepa-
rating the higher half of your data from the lower half. 
You can find the median by arranging all of the obser-
vations from lowest value to highest value and picking 
the middle value (assuming you have an odd number of 
observations). Although the mean and median are closely 
related, the difference between the mean and the median 
is sometimes of interest.
	
a.	 Suppose country A has five families. Their incomes 
are $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, and $50,000. 
What is the median family income in A? What is the 
mean income?
	
b.	 Country B also has five families. Their incomes are 
$10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, and $150,000. 
What is the median family income in B? What is the 
mean income?
	
c.	 In which country is income inequality greater, A or B?
	
d.	 Suppose you thought income inequality in the US had

20 students in the class averaged at 75. What is the aver-

	 3.	 This chapter stressed the importance of using appropriate 
samples for empirical studies. Consider the following two 
problems in that light.
	
a.	 You are given a class assignment to find out if peo-
ple’s political leanings affect the newspaper or maga-
zine that they choose to read. You survey two students 
taking a political science class and five people at a 
coffee shop. Almost all the people you have spoken 
to tell you that their political affiliations do not affect 
what they read. Based on the results of your study, 
you conclude that there is no relationship between po-
litical inclinations and the choice of a newspaper. Is 
this a valid conclusion? Why or why not?
	
b.	 Your uncle tells you that the newspaper or magazine 
that people buy will depend on their age. He says that 
he believes this because, at home, his wife and his 
teenage children read different papers. Do you think 
his conclusion is justified?
	 4.	 With the fairly recent Internet boom and IT revolution, piracy 
and plagiarism, among many other things, have increased. 
Do you think that having stricter cyber laws and censorship 
preventing the “misuse” of information is a good idea?
	 5.	 As the text explains, it can sometimes be very difficult to 
sort out the direction of causality.
	
a.	 Why might you think that more police officers would 
lead to lower crime rates? Why might you think that 
higher crime rates would lead to more police officers?
	
b.	 In 2012, the New England Journal of Medicine 
­published research that showed a strong correlation 
between the consumption of chocolate in a country 
and the number of Nobel Prize winners in that coun-
try. Do you think countries that want to encourage 
their citizens to win Nobel Prizes should increase 
their consumption of chocolate?
	 6.	 The chapter shows that in general people with more 
­education earn higher salaries. Economists have of-
fered two explanations of this relationship. The human 
capital argument says that high schools and colleges 
teach people valuable skills, and employers are will-
ing to pay higher salaries to attract people with those 
skills. The signaling argument says that college gradu-
ates earn more because a college degree is a signal to 
employers that a job applicant is diligent, intelligent, 
and persevering. How might you use data on people 
with two, three, and four years of college education to 
shed light on this controversy?
	 7.	 Maimonides, a twelfth-century scholar, said, “Twenty-
five children may be put in the charge of one teacher. If 
the number in the class exceeds twenty-five but is not more 
than forty, he should have an assistant to help with the 
­instruction. If there are more than forty, two teachers must 
be ­appointed.” Israel follows Maimonides’s rule in deter-
mining the number of teachers for each class. How could 
you use Maimonides’s rule as a natural experiment to study 
the effect of teacher-student ratios on student achievement?

Roughly 90,000 people applied but the state had funds

the impact of increased ­access to healthcare on health 
outcomes?

Constructing and Interpreting Graphs
As you start to learn economics, it’s important that you have a 
good grasp of how to make sense of data and how to present data 
clearly in visible form. Graphs are everywhere—on TV, on the 
Web, in newspapers and magazines, in economics textbooks. 
Why are graphs so popular?
A well-designed graph summarizes information with a ­simple 
­visual display—the old adage “a picture is worth a thousand 
words” might help you understand the popularity of visual 
­images. In this textbook, you will find many graphs, and you will 
see that they provide a way to supplement the verbal description 
of economic concepts.
To illustrate how we construct and interpret graphs, we will 
walk you through a recent study that we have conducted, present-
ing some data summaries along the way.
A Study About Incentives
Would you study harder for this economics class if we paid you $50 for earning an 
A? What if we raised the stakes to $500? Your first impulse might be to think “Well,  
sure . . . why not? That money could buy a new Kindle and maybe a ticket to a Beyoncé 
concert.”
But as we have learned in Chapter 1, there are opportunity costs of studying more, such 
as attending fewer rock concerts or spending less time at your favorite coffee house chat-
ting with friends. Such opportunity costs must be weighed against the benefits of earning 
an A in this course. You might conclude that because this question is hypothetical, anyway, 
there’s no need to think harder about how you would behave.
But it might not be as imaginary as you first thought.
Over the past few years, thousands of students around the United States have actually 
been confronted with such an offer. In fact, Sally Sadoff, Steven Levitt, and John List car-
ried out an experiment at two high schools in the suburbs of Chicago over the past several 
years in which they used incentives to change students’ behavior. Such an experiment al-
lows us to think about the relationship between two variables, such as how an increase in a 
financial reward affects student test scores. And it naturally leads to a discussion of cause 
and effect, which we have just studied in this chapter: we’ll compare causal relationships 
between variables and consider simple correlations between variables. Both causation and 
correlation are powerful concepts in gaining an understanding of the world around us.
Experimental Design
There are two high schools in Chicago Heights, and both have a problem with student 
dropouts. In terms of dropouts, it is not uncommon for more than 50 percent of incoming 
ninth-graders to drop out before receiving a high school diploma. There are clearly prob-
lems in this school district, but they are not unique to Chicago Heights; many urban school 
districts face a similar problem.
How can economists help? Some economists, including one of the coauthors of this 
book, have devised incentive schemes to lower the dropout rates and increase academic 
achievement in schools. In this instance, students were paid for improved academic 
performance.2
A well-designed graph summarizes 
information with a simple visual 
­display—the old adage “a picture is 
worth a thousand words” might help 
you understand the popularity of 
­visual images.

Let’s first consider the experiment to lower the dropout rate. Each student was randomly 
placed into one of the following three groups:
Control Group: No students received financial compensation for meeting special stan-
dards established by experimenters (which are explained below).
Treatment Group with Student Incentives: Students would receive $50 for each 
month the standards were met.
Treatment Group with Parent Incentives: Students’ parents would receive $50 for 
each month the standards were met.
A student was deemed to have met the monthly standards if he or she:
	
1.	 did not have a D or F in any classes during that month,
	
2.	 had no more than one unexcused absence during that month,
	
3.	 had no suspensions during that month.
Describing Variables
Before we discover how much money these students actually made, let’s consider more 
carefully the variables that we might be interested in knowing. As its name suggests, a 
variable is a factor that is likely to vary or change; that is, it can take different values in 
different situations. In this section, we show you how to use three different techniques to 
help graphically describe variables:
	
1.	 Pie charts
	
2.	 Bar graphs
	
3.	 Time series graphs
Pie Charts
Understanding pie charts is a piece of cake. A pie chart is a circular chart split into segments 
to show the percentages of parts relative to the whole. Put another way, pie charts are used to 
describe how a single variable is broken up into different categories, or “slices.” Economists 
often use pie charts to show important economic variables, such as sources of government 
tax revenue or the targets of government expenditure, which we discuss in Chapter 10.
For example, consider the race of the students in our experiment. In Exhibit 2A.1, we 
learn that 59 percent of ninth-graders in the experiment are African-American. We therefore 
differentiate 59 percent of our pie chart with the color blue to represent the proportion of 
African-Americans relative to all participants in the experiment. We see that 15 percent of 
the students are non-Hispanic whites, represented by the red piece of the pie. We continue 
A pie chart is a circular chart split 
into segments, with each showing 
the percentages of parts relative  
to the whole.

do all of the segments add 
up to the complete “pie.”

breaking down participation by race until we have filled in 100 percent of the circle. The 
circle then describes the racial composition of the participants in the experiment.
Bar Charts
Another type of graph that can be used to summarize and display a variable is a bar chart. 
A bar chart uses bars (no surprise there) of different heights or lengths to indicate the 
properties of different groups. Bar charts make it easy to compare a single variable across 
many groups. To make a bar chart, simply draw rectangles side-by-side, making each 
rectangle as high (or as long, in the case of horizontal bars) as the value of the variable it 
is describing.
For example, Exhibit 2A.2 captures the overall success rates of students in the various 
experimental groups. In the exhibit we have the independent variable—the variable that 
the experimenter is choosing (which treatment a student is placed in)—on the horizontal or 
x-axis. On the vertical or y-axis is the dependent variable—the variable that is potentially 
affected by the experimental treatment. In the exhibit, the dependent variable is the propor-
tion of students meeting the academic standards. Note that 100 percent is a proportion of 1, 
and 30 percent is a proportion of 0.30.
We find some interesting experimental results in Exhibit 2A.2. For instance, we can see 
from the bar graph that 28 percent of students in the Control group (students who received 
no incentives) met the standards. In comparison, 34.8 percent of students in the Parent 
­Incentive group met the standards. This is a considerable increase in the number of students 
meeting the standards—important evidence that incentives can work.
Time Series Graphs
With pie charts and bar graphs, we can summarize how a variable is broken up into dif-
ferent groups, but what if we want to understand how a variable changes over time? For 
instance, how did the proportion of students meeting the standards change over the school 
year? A time series graph can do the trick. A time series graph displays data at different 
points in time.
As an example, consider Exhibit 2A.3, which displays the proportion of students meet-
ing the standards in each month in the Control and Parent Incentive groups. Keep in mind 
that although there are multiple months and groups, we are still measuring only a single 
­variable—in this case, the proportion meeting the standard. As Exhibit 2A.3 makes clear, the 
number of students meeting the standard is higher in the Parent Incentive treatment group 
than in the Control group. But notice that the difference within the Parent Incentive and Con-
trol groups changes from month to month. Without a time series, we would not be able to ap-
preciate these month-to-month differences and would not be able to get a sense for how the  
A bar chart uses bars of different 
heights or lengths to indicate the 
properties of different groups.
Exhibit 2A.2 Proportion of 
Students Meeting Academic 
Standards by Experimental Group
The bar chart facilitates ­comparing 
numbers across groups in the 
­experiment. In this case, we can 
compare how different groups 
­perform in terms of meeting 
­academic standards by comparing 
the height of each bar. For example, 
the Parent ­Incentive group’s bar is 
higher than the ­Control group’s bar, 
meaning that a higher proportion 
of students in the Parent Incentives 
group met the standards than in the 
Control group.

effectiveness of the incentive varies over the school year. As you read this book, one im-
portant data property to recognize is how variables change over time; time series graphs are 
invaluable in helping us understand how a variable changes over time.
Scatter Plots
You might ask yourself, without such monetary incentives is education worth it? In this 
chapter we showed you how wages and years of education are related. Another way to 
show the relationship is with a scatter plot. A scatter plot displays the relationship ­between 
two variables as plotted points of data. Exhibit 2A.4 shows the relationship between years 
of education and average weekly income across U.S. states in September of 2013. For 
­example, the point 10.4 years of education and $800 in weekly earnings is from New 
­Jersey. This means that the average years of education for New Jersey adults is 10.4 and the 
average weekly earnings is $800.
Cause and Effect
We’ve written a fair amount about causation and correlation in this chapter. Economists are 
much more interested in the former. Causation relates two variables in an active way—a 
causes b if, because of a, b has occurred.

The time series graph takes the 
same information that was in the 
bar chart, but shows how it changes 
depending on the month of the 
school year during the experiment. 
The points are connected to more 
clearly illustrate the month-to-
month trend. In addition, by using 
a different color or line pattern, we 
can represent two groups (Control 
and Parent Incentives) on the same 
graph, giving the opportunity to 
compare the two groups, just as 
with the bar chart from before.

For example, we could conclude in our experimental study that paying money for the 
students’ performance causes them to improve their academic performance. This would 
not necessarily be the case if the experiment were not properly implemented—for exam-
ple, if students were not randomly placed into control and treatment groups. For instance, 
imagine that the experimenters had placed all of the students who had achieved poorly in 
the past in the control group. Then the relatively poor performance of the control group 
might be due to the composition of students who were assigned to the control group, and 
not to the lack of payment. Any relationship between academic achievement and payment 
stemming from such an experiment could be interpreted as a correlation because all other 
things were not equal at the start of the experiment—the control group would have a higher 
proportion of low achievers than the other groups.
Fortunately, the Chicago Heights Experiment was implemented using the principle 
of randomization, discussed earlier in this chapter. The experimenters split students into 
groups randomly, so each experimental group had an equal representation of students and 
their attributes (variables such as average student intelligence were similar across groups). 
Because the only possible reason that a student would be assigned to one group instead of 
another was chance, we can argue that any difference between the groups’ academic per-
formance at the end of the experiment was due to the difference the experimental treatment 
imposed, such as differences in financial incentives.
This means that we can claim that the cause of the difference between the performance 
of the Student Incentive group and the Control group, for example, is that students in the 
Student Incentive group were given an incentive of $50 whereas students in the Control 
group received no incentive for improvement.
Correlation Does Not Imply Causality
Often, correlation is misinterpreted as causation. You should think of correlation between 
two variables as providing a reason to look for a causal relationship, but correlation should 
only be considered a first step to establishing causality. As an example, not long ago, a 
high-ranking marketing executive showed us Exhibit 2A.5 (the numbers are changed for 
confidentiality reasons). He was trying to demonstrate that his company’s retail advertise-
ments were effective in increasing sales: “It shows a clear positive relationship between 
ads and sales. When we placed 1,000 ads, sales were roughly $35 million. But see how 
sales dipped to roughly $20 million when we placed only 100 ads?! This proves that more 
advertisements lead to more sales.”
Before discussing whether this exhibit proves causality, let’s step back and think about 
the basic characteristics of Exhibit 2A.5. In such an exhibit we have:
	
1.	 The x-variable plotted on the horizontal axis, or x-axis; in our figure the x-variable 
is the number of advertisements.
Exhibit 2A.5 
Advertisements  
and Sales
Just looking at the line 
chart of sales versus num-
ber of advertisements, 
we would be tempted to 
say that more ads cause 
more sales. However, 
without randomization, 
we risk having a third 
variable that is omitted 
from the chart, which 
increases sales but has 
nothing to do with ads. Is 
such an omitted variable 
lurking here?

2.	 The y-variable plotted on the vertical axis, or y-axis; in our figure the y-variable is 
the sales in millions of dollars.
	
3.	 The origin, which is the point where the x-axis intersects the y-axis; both sales and 
the number of advertisements are equal to zero at the origin.
In the exhibit, the number of advertisements is the independent variable, and the amount 
of sales is the dependent variable. When the values of both variables increase together in 
the same direction, they have a positive relationship; when one increases and the other 
­decreases, and they move in opposite directions, they have a negative relationship.
So in Exhibit 2A.5, we find a positive relationship between the two variables. What is 
the strength of that positive relationship? This is called the slope. The slope is the change 
in the value of the variable plotted on the y-axis divided by the change in the value of the 
variable plotted on the x-axis:
Slope = Change in y
Change in x = Rise
Run.
In this example, the increase in the number of advertisements from 100 to 1,000 was as-
sociated with an increase in sales from $20 million to $35 million. Thus, the rise, or the 
change in sales (y), is $15 million and the run, or change in x, is 900. Because both are 
rising (moving in the same direction), the slope is positive:
Slope = $35,000,000 - $20,000,000
1000 ads - 100 ads
= $15,000,000
900 ads
= $16,667 per ad.
Thus, our exhibit implies that one more advertisement is associated with $16,667 more in 
sales. But, does this necessarily mean that if the retailer increases the number of advertise-
ments by one, this will cause sales to increase by $16,667?
Unfortunately, no. While it is tempting to interpret the sales increasing with ads as a 
causal relationship between the two variables, because the number of advertisements was 
not randomly determined with an experiment, we cannot be sure that this relationship is 
causal. In this case, the marketing executive forgot to think about why they so drastically 
increased their advertisement volume to begin with! They did so because of the holiday 
season, a time when sales would presumably have been high anyway.
So, after some further digging (we spare you the details), what the data actually say is 
that the retailer placed more ads during times of busy shopping (around Thanksgiving and 
in December), but that is exactly when sales were high—because of the holiday shopping 
season. Similar to what happened in the Walmart red/blue ad example in this chapter, once 
we recognize such seasonal effects and take them into account, the causal relationship be-
tween ads and sales disappeared!
This example shows that you should be careful when you connect a few points in a 
graph. Just because two variables move together (a correlation), they are not necessarily 
related in a causal way. They could merely be linked by another variable that is causing 
them both to increase—in this case, the shopping season.
To see the general idea of what is happening more clearly, let’s instead graph the quan-
tity of ice cream produced versus the number of monthly drownings in the United States.  
Using data across months in 2011, we constructed Exhibit 2A.6. In Exhibit 2A.6, we see 
that in months when ice cream production is relatively high, there are a lot of drownings. 
Likewise, in months when there is relatively little ice cream production, there are many 
fewer drownings. Does this mean that you should not swim after you eat ice cream?
Indeed, parents persuaded by such a chart might believe that it’s causal, and never let 
their kids eat ice cream near swimming pools or lakes! But luckily for us ice cream lovers, 
there is an omitted variable lurking in the background. In the summertime, when it is hot 
people eat more ice cream and swim more. More swimming leads to more drowning. Even 
though people eat more ice cream cones in the summer, eating ice cream doesn’t cause 
people to drown.
The slope is the change in the value 
of the variable plotted on the y-axis 
divided by the change in the value 
of the variable plotted on the x-axis.

Just as a heightened shopping season was the omitted variable in the retailer advertise-
ment example, here the omitted variable is heat—it causes us to swim more and to eat more 
ice cream cones. While the former causes more drownings (as we would all expect), the 
latter has nothing to do with drowning even though there is a positive correlation between 
the two as shown in Exhibit 2A.6.
Beyond an understanding of how to construct data figures, we hope that this appendix 
gave you an appreciation for how to interpret visual displays of data. An important lesson 
is that just because two variables are correlated—and move together in a figure—does not 
mean that they are causally related. Causality is the gold standard in the social sciences. 
Without understanding the causal relationship between two variables, we cannot reliably 
predict how the world will change when the government intervenes to change one of the 
variables. Experiments help to reveal causal relationships. We learned from the Chicago 
Heights ­experiment that incentives can affect student performance.

Optimization: Doing 
the Best You Can
3
Suppose you have just landed a job near 
the center of a city and you now need to 
decide where to live. If you live close to the 
city center, your round-trip commute will be 
15 minutes. If you live in the distant suburbs, 
your round-trip commute will be 60 minutes. 
If there are lots of workers like you who work 
downtown, where will the apartments be 
­relatively less expensive? How will you choose 
where to live? How should you make the best 
decision given the trade-offs you face?
In this chapter, we’ll dig into the concept of 
optimization—choosing the best feasible option. 
You will learn how to optimize by ­using cost-benefit 
analysis. And we will apply this knowledge to a 
single example that we revisit throughout the chapter—­
choosing an apartment.

Section 3.1   |  Two Kinds of Optimization: A Matter of Focus 
81
In Chapter 1, we described economics as the study of choice. Economists believe that 
people usually make choices by trying to select the best feasible option, given the avail-
able information. In other words, people optimize. Recall that this is the first principle of 
economics.
Economists believe that optimization describes most of the 
choices that people, households, businesses, and governments 
make. To an economist, seemingly unrelated decisions—for 
­example, where a college student will travel on spring break, 
which apartment a worker will rent, or what price Apple charges 
for an iPhone—are all connected by the unifying principle of 
­optimization. Whatever choices people face, economists believe 
that they are likely to try to choose optimally. Economists don’t 
assume that people always successfully optimize, but economists 
do believe that people try to optimize and usually do a pretty good job with whatever 
­information they have.
In other words, economists believe that people’s behavior is approximated by optimiza-
tion. People aren’t perfect optimizers because optimization is usually not easy, and it is 
often quite complex. To illustrate the complexity, consider the choice of an apartment. 
In large cities there are hundreds of thousands of rental apartments. And each apartment 
has many different characteristics to consider, such as location, views, and neighborhood 
amenities.
At the heart of this complexity are trade-offs. For example, how do you compare two 
apartments, one of which has the virtue of lower rent and one of which has the virtue of a 
shorter commute? How would you determine which apartment is a better choice for you? 
In this chapter, we are going to see how to optimally evaluate such trade-offs. We will 
­introduce you to the most important optimization tools that economists use.
We have a lot to say about choosing a rental apartment, but we want you to remember 
that the choice of an apartment is just one illustration of the general concept of optimization.
Two Kinds of Optimization:  
A Matter of Focus
3.1 
Economists believe that optimization 
describes most of the choices that 
people, households, businesses, and 
governments make.
Key Ideas
When an economic agent chooses the best feasible option, she is 
optimizing.
Optimization in levels calculates the total net benefit of different 
alternatives and then chooses the best alternative.
Optimization in differences calculates the change in net benefits when 
a person switches from one alternative to another, and then uses these 
marginal comparisons to choose the best alternative.
Optimization in levels and optimization in differences give identical 
answers.

Chapter 3  |  Optimization: Doing the Best You Can
3.1
Optimization can be implemented using either of two techniques of cost-benefit analy-
sis. Both techniques emphasize the concept of net benefit—benefit minus cost—which we 
introduced in Chapter 1.
	
1.	 Optimization in levels calculates the total net benefit of different alternatives, and 
then chooses the best alternative.
	
2.	 Optimization in differences calculates the change in net benefits when a person 
switches from one alternative to another and then uses these marginal comparisons 
to choose the best alternative.
As you’ll see in the examples that follow, optimization in levels and optimization in 
differences should always yield answers in perfect agreement. These techniques are two 
sides of the same coin.
To get a taste for these two methods, take a peek at the Halloween bag after this para-
graph. Think about how much you would enjoy eating the contents of this bag—the bag’s 
benefit to you.
Optimization in levels calculates 
the total net benefit of different 
alternatives and then chooses the 
best alternative.
Optimization in differences 
calculates the change in net benefits 
when a person switches from one 
alternative to another and then 
uses these marginal comparisons to 
choose the best alternative.
First	Halloween	Bag
Second	Halloween	Bag
Now think about how much you would enjoy eating the contents of a second bag of candy:
In principle, the bag that offers the greatest total enjoyment is the bag you would choose if 
you were asked to choose between them. This kind of analysis is an example of optimiza-
tion in levels. You calculated the benefit of each bag, and then you chose the best bag.
Now consider a second version of exactly the same decision. We’ll take the same two 
bags of candy and put them side by side. We’ll now reorder the candy bars to highlight 
the similarities and differences. In this case, all of the bars match except the first bag  

3.2
3.3
	
Section 3.1   |  Two Kinds of Optimization: A Matter of Focus 
83
3.1
 This is an example of optimization in differences. Optimization in differences analyzes 
the change in net benefits when a person switches from one bag to another and then uses 
this marginal comparison to choose the best alternative.
We asked you to make the same choice twice—we used the same pair of bags in both 
choices. The first time you chose, you analyzed each of the Halloween bags in isolation. 
The second time you chose, you analyzed the difference between the two bags. This change 
in focus is all that distinguishes optimization in levels and optimization in differences. If 
you choose optimally, this shift in focus shouldn’t have changed your final decision, but it 
might have speeded things along. In many cases, optimization in differences is faster and 
easier, because you focus on the key differences between the options.
Economists believe that the framework of optimization 
approximates how people make most economic choices. 
But economists don’t take optimization for granted. A 
large body of economic research studies the question: 
do people really optimize?
Thousands of research papers have been written on 
this question. This research has broadly concluded that 
optimization is a good model of economic behavior in 
most, though not all, situations. One field of economics—­
behavioral economics—identifies the specific situations 
in which people fail to optimize. Behavioral economists 
explain these optimization failures by combining eco-
nomic and psychological theories of human behavior.
Several special situations are associated with behav-
ior that is not optimal. For example, when people have 
self-control problems—like procrastination, or, far worse, 
addiction—optimization is not a good description of 
behavior. 
People also tend to fail as optimizers when they 
are new to a task. For instance, the first time some-
one plays poker they tend to play poorly—they make 
rookie mistakes. On the other hand, optimization is a 
good description of choices when people have lots 
of experience. For example, as a consumer gains a 
few years of experience with a new credit card, they 
become half as likely to miss their monthly payment 
deadline. 
Because people aren’t born perfect optimizers, optimi-
zation is a useful skill to develop. Economists show peo-
ple how to be better optimizers—such advice amounts to 
normative economic analysis. 
We hope that you use the concept of optimization in 
two ways: it is a good description of the behavior of ex-
perienced decision makers and it provides an excellent 
toolbox for improving decision making that is not already 
optimal.
Choice & Consequence
Do People Really Optimize?
has a Milky Way and the second bag has a 3 Musketeers. Since all of the candy bars  
except one are the same, it’s natural to focus on this one difference. Does this ­difference— 
3 Musketeers replacing Milky Way—increase the value to you of the Halloween Bag? If 
this one difference increases the value, you should pick the second bag. If this one differ-
ence decreases the value, you should pick the first bag.
Behavioral economics jointly 
analyzes the economic and 
psychological factors that explain 
human behavior.

Many cities have a single 
central business district—
which is often referred to 
as the city center—where 
lots of employers are 
concentrated. 
In most cities, apartments 
near the city center cost 
more to rent than otherwise 
identical apartments that 
are far away. Why is this so?

Let’s explore optimization in levels in more depth. To illustrate ideas, we return to our 
opening example in which you are an apartment hunter.
Imagine that you have narrowed your choices to four leading candidates—your “short 
list.” Exhibit 3.1 summarizes this short list, including two key pieces of information 
for each apartment—the monthly rent and the amount of commuting time per month.  
In ­Exhibit 3.1, rents fall the farther you are from work. Later in this chapter, we explain 
why the economic model predicts this relationship between rents and distance from work. 
We’ll also show you empirical evidence that confirms this prediction.
You might wonder about everything that was left out of the summary of information in 
Exhibit 3.1. What about other differences among these apartments, like how long it takes to 
walk to the neighborhood laundromat or whether there is a park nearby? We also omitted com-
muting costs other than time, like the direct dollar cost of public transportation or, if you drive 
yourself, gasoline and tolls. Shouldn’t all of these considerations be part of the comparison?
To keep things simple, we will omit other factors for now, even though they are ­important 
in practice. We omit them to keep the calculations simple and so that the basic economic con-
cepts are easier to see. As you’ll discover in the problems at the end of the chapter, once you 
understand the basic ideas, it is easy to add more details. For now, we will assume that the four 
apartments—Very Close, Close, Far, and Very Far— are identical except for the differences in 
Exhibit 3.1.
Note, too, that we are focusing only on costs in this example—the cost of commuting time 
and the cost of rent. We are assuming that the benefits of these apartments are the same—for 
instance, proximity to shopping or public transportation. If the benefits are the same, then 
cost-benefit analysis becomes simpler. In normal cost-benefit analysis the decision maker 
finds the alternative with the highest value of net benefit, which is benefit minus cost. When 
the benefits are the same across all the alternatives, cost-benefit analysis simplifies to finding 
the alternative with the lowest cost. That’s what we are going to do next.

3.2
Exhibit 3.1 contains the information that we need, but on its own, it 
does not enable us to choose the best apartment. We do not yet have a 
way to add up the costs of rent and commuting time. We need to sum 
these costs to calculate the total cost of each apartment. The total cost 
includes the direct cost of rent and the indirect cost of commute time.
To sum these two costs, we first need to decide on a common unit of 
account. Let’s pick dollars per month for now. Because rent is already 
expressed in dollars per month, half of our work has been done for us. 
All that remains is to translate the indirect cost—commuting time—
into the same unit of measurement.
To do this, we use the concept of opportunity cost, which we 
­introduced in Chapter 1. Let’s begin by assuming that the opportunity 
cost of commuting time is $10/hour. This is the hourly value of the 
alternative activity that is crowded out when you spend more time com-
muting. The fact that it is a dollar value doesn’t imply that this time would have been spent 
at work if it weren’t spent commuting. An extra hour of time has value to you whatever you 
would do with that time, including napping, socializing, watching videos, taking longer 
showers, or working.
If the round-trip commute takes 20 hours per month and the opportunity cost of time is 
$10/hour, then the dollar cost of that commute is
 a 20 hours
month b a $10
hour b = a $200
monthb.
The first term on the left is commute time per month, which is expressed in hours per 
month, just as it is in Exhibit 3.1. The term just before the equal sign is the opportunity cost 
of time, which is expressed as dollars per hour. The units in hours cancel, leaving a final 
cost expressed as dollars per month.
Now we are ready to rewrite Exhibit 3.1. Using the calculations that we just illustrated 
for 20 hours of monthly commuting time, we can calculate costs for a commute of any du-
ration. Exhibit 3.2 reports this commuting cost in dollars per month for all four apartments.
Exhibit 3.2 gives us the answer to our optimization problem. Apartment Far is the best 
apartment for a consumer with an opportunity cost of time of $10/hour. This apartment has 
the lowest total cost —$1,180—taking into account both direct rent costs and indirect time 
costs of commuting.
We can also see this result by plotting the total costs. Exhibit 3.3 plots the total cost of 
each of the four apartments. It is easy to see that Apartment Far is the best. Economists call 
the best feasible choice the optimum, which you can see labeled on the total cost curve.
To sum up our discussion so far, optimization in levels has three steps:
	
1.	 Translate all costs and benefits into common units, like dollars per month.
	
2.	 Calculate the total net benefit of each alternative.
	
3.	 Pick the alternative with the highest net benefit.

Comparative statics is the 
comparison of economic outcomes 
before and after some economic 
variable is changed.
Comparative Statics
Economic models predict how a person’s choices change when something in the environ-
ment changes. Comparative statics is the comparison of economic outcomes before and 
after some economic variable is changed. For example, some consumers will choose to 
drive more expensive cars if their wealth increases. In this example, the car choice is the 
economic behavior that changes when the variable of consumer wealth changes.
We now return to the example in the previous subsection to conduct a comparative statics 
analysis. Specifically, we ask what happens when the opportunity cost of time is changed.
Recall that we studied the choice of an apartment assuming that the opportunity cost of 
time was $10/hour. Let’s instead assume that the opportunity cost of time is $15/hour. Why 
might opportunity cost rise? For example, a freelance worker’s opportunity cost of time 
would rise if their hourly wage rose.
How does this increase in the opportunity cost of time change the predicted behavior? 
Before we take you through it step-by-step, try to use your intuition. How would a change 
in the value of time affect the optimal decision of where to live? Should commuters with a 
higher value of time move closer to where they work or farther away?
To answer this question, we again need to translate the indirect cost—commuting time—
into the same units as the direct cost of rent, which is dollars per month. Accordingly, we 
rewrite Exhibit 3.2, assuming instead a $15/hour opportunity cost of time. Exhibit 3.4 
reports this commuting cost in dollars per month for all four apartments.
Exhibit 3.4 provides the answer to our new optimization problem. The best apartment 
for a consumer with an opportunity cost of time of $15/hour now shifts to Apartment Close

Exhibit 3.5 plots the total cost of each of the four apartments assuming a $15/hour 
­opportunity cost of time. Apartment Close is the best choice—the optimum.
The higher opportunity cost of time caused the optimal choice to change from Apart-
ment Far to Apartment Close. When the opportunity cost of time increases from $10/hour  
to $15/hour, it becomes more valuable for the commuter to choose an apartment that ­ 
reduces the amount of time spent commuting. So the optimal choice switches from a rela-
tively inexpensive apartment with a longer commute to a relatively expensive apartment 
with a shorter commute—Apartment Close.
Exhibit 3.6 takes the two different cost curves from Exhibits 3.3 and 3.5 and plots them 
in a single figure. The purple line represents the total cost curve for the commuter with an 
opportunity cost of $10/hour. The orange line represents the total cost curve for the com-
muter with an opportunity cost of $15/hour. Two key properties are visible in Exhibit 3.6.
	
1.	 The $10/hour cost curve lies below the $15/hour cost curve. The $10/curve has lower 
commuting costs for each apartment, so the total cost, which takes into account both 
the direct cost of rent and the indirect cost of commuting, is lower for all apartments.
	
2.	 The $10/hour curve has a minimum value for Apartment Far, while the $15/hour 
curve has a minimum value for Apartment Close. In other words, the optimal apart-
ment switches from Apartment Far to Apartment Close when the opportunity cost 
of time rises from $10/hour to $15/hour.

Marginal analysis is a cost-
benefit calculation that studies 
the difference between a feasible 
alternative and the next feasible 
alternative.
Marginal analysis will never change  
the ultimate answer to the 
question “what is optimal?” but it 
will change the way that you think 
about optimizing.
Until now, we have studied the apartment-hunting problem by calculating the total cost 
of each apartment. As explained above, we call that approach optimization in levels. We 
are now going to discuss an alternative optimization technique: optimization in differ-
ences. Optimization in differences is often faster to implement than optimization in levels, 
­because optimization in differences focuses only on the way that alternatives differ.
Optimization in differences breaks an optimization problem down by thinking about 
how costs and benefits change as you hypothetically move from one alternative to another. 
For example, consider two alternative vacations at the same hotel in Miami: a four-day trip 
versus a five-day trip. Suppose that you are choosing between these two options. If you 
optimize in levels, you would evaluate the total net benefit of a four-day trip and compare 
it to the total net benefit of a five-day trip. Alternatively, you could think about only the 
differences between the two trips. In other words, you could think only about the costs 
and benefits of the extra day. An optimizer will take the five-day vacation if the benefit 
of vacationing for the fifth day exceeds the cost of the fifth day. In choosing between the 
four- and five-day options, the optimizer doesn’t actually need to worry about the first four 
days, since those four days are shared by both the four-day trip and the five-day trip. The 
optimizer can focus on the one thing that differentiates the two vacations: the fifth day.
Economists use the word marginal to indicate a difference ­between alternatives, usually 
a difference that represents one “step” or “unit” more. The fifth day of vacation is the dif-
ference, or margin, between a four-day vacation and a five-day vacation.
A cost-benefit calculation that focuses on the difference between a feasible alternative 
and the next feasible alternative is called marginal analysis. Marginal analysis compares 
the consequences—costs and benefits—of doing one step more 
of something. Thinking back to our apartment example, marginal 
analysis can be used to study the costs and benefits of moving one 
apartment farther away from the city center.
Marginal analysis will never change the ultimate answer to the 
question “what is optimal?” but it will change the way that you 
think about optimizing. Marginal analysis forces us to focus on 
what is changing when we compare alternatives. Marginal analysis 
is the way that we implement optimization in differences. Marginal 
analysis is one of the most important concepts in economics.
Marginal Cost
Let’s return to the problem of choosing the best apartment. We go back to this problem to 
preserve continuity with our earlier analysis. Though it may appear otherwise, we are not 
personally obsessed with apartment-hunting. Our analysis illustrates techniques that will 
enable you to optimize in any situation.
When we studied the problem of choosing a rental apartment, we did not use marginal 
analysis. Instead, we solved the problem by calculating and comparing the total cost—
including direct and indirect costs—of the four apartments. We’ll now solve the same 
apartment-selection problem using marginal analysis. The optimum won’t change—we’ll 
confirm that below—but the way that you think about the problem will.
Again consider the commuter with a $10/hour opportunity cost of time. Instead of think-
ing about each of the apartments in isolation, let’s now think about the apartments com-
paratively. Specifically, let’s focus on what changes as we hypothetically “move” from one 
apartment to the next, stepping farther away from the city center. What is the difference 
between each pair of apartments?
Exhibit 3.7 helps you think about these changes. The “Commuting Cost” column 
­reports the monthly commuting cost for each apartment assuming a $10/hour opportu-
nity cost of time. The “Marginal Commuting Cost” column reports the value of the extra 
monthly commuting time that is generated by moving one apartment farther from the city 
center. For example, to move from Apartment Close to Apartment Far generates additional

commuting costs of $50 per month. In other words, the “Marginal Commuting Cost” col-
umn reports the difference between two commuting costs in adjacent positions on the list. 
In this particular example, the marginal commuting cost is always the same—the commut-
ing cost rises by the same amount with each move farther away from the city center. This 
won’t generally be the case, but we’ve set it up this way in this problem to keep things 
simple. In general, marginal cost is the extra cost generated by moving from one feasible 
alternative to the next feasible alternative.
Now turn to the column labeled “Rent Cost,” which reports the monthly rent for each 
apartment. The “Marginal Rent Cost” column reports the change in the rent cost gener-
ated by moving from one apartment to the next apartment—one step farther from the city 
center. For example, to move from Apartment Very Close to Apartment Close would save 
you $90 per month, so the marginal rent cost is a negative number, −$90. Likewise, if you 
moved from Apartment Close to Apartment Far, you would save an additional $60 per 
month, so the marginal rent cost is −$60.
Finally, we’d like to know the marginal value of total cost. It turns out that we can calcu-
late the marginal value of total cost in two alternative ways. First, we can add up the marginal 
commuting cost and the marginal rent cost to obtain the marginal total cost. For example, 
look at the first row of marginal cost numbers and confirm that $50 + −$90 = −$40. In 
other words, a move from Apartment Very Close to Apartment Close raises commuting costs 
by $50 and changes rent by −$90, producing a combined change of −$40.
Alternatively, we could calculate total cost itself. This is done in the column labeled 
Total Cost. For instance, for Apartment Very Close, the commuting cost is $50 and the 
rent cost is $1,180, so the total cost is $1,230. For Apartment Close, the commuting cost 
is $100 and the rent cost is $1,090, so the total cost is $1,190. Total cost falls by $40 when 
we move from Apartment Very Close, with total cost $1,230, to Apartment Close, with total 
cost $1,190.
Both methods confirm that the marginal total cost is −$40 when moving from Apart-
ment Very Close to Apartment Close.
Marginal commuting cost + Marginal rent cost = $50 + −$90 = −$40
Total cost of Close − Total cost of Very Close = $1,190 − $1,230 = −$40
The fact that we calculated −$40 in both cases is no accident. The exact match reflects 
the fact that it doesn’t matter how we decompose costs to calculate marginal total cost. 
It doesn’t matter whether we calculate marginal total cost by summing marginal costs 
category by category or whether we calculate marginal total cost by subtracting the total 
cost of one apartment from the other. Because the answer is the same, you should calculate 
marginal total cost whichever way is easier for you.
The last column of Exhibit 3.7—marginal total cost—contains all of the information 
that we need to optimize. Start at the top of the column and think about how each “move” 
away from the city center affects the worker. The first move, from Very Close to Close, has 
a marginal cost of −$40 per month, so it is cost cutting. That move is worth it.
The second move, from Close to Far, has a marginal cost of −$10 per month. That 
move is also cost cutting and consequently it is also worth taking.
Marginal cost is the extra cost 
generated by moving from one 
feasible alternative to the next 
feasible alternative.

Chapter 3  |  Optimization: Doing the Best You Can
The third move, from Far to Very Far, has a marginal cost of $20 per month. So that 
move is not worth taking, because it represents an increase in costs.
To sum up, the first two moves paid for themselves and the final move did not. Very Far 
can’t be an optimum, since moving from Far to Very Far made the worker worse off. Very 
Close can’t be an optimum, since moving from Very Close to Close made the worker better 
off. Finally, Close can’t be an optimum, since moving from Close to Far made the worker 
better off.
We conclude that Far is the optimum—the best feasible choice. Moving from Close to 
Far made the worker better off. But moving from Far to Very Far made the worker worse 
off. Far is the only apartment that satisfies the following property: moving to the apartment 
makes the worker better off and moving away from the apartment makes the worker worse 
off. In other words, Far has the virtue that it is a better option than its “neighbors.”
The optimizer’s goal is to make himself as well off as possible. An optimum is the point at 
which the optimizer cannot do any better. The apartment that is better than all its feasible alter-
natives is also the apartment that minimizes total costs. This is an example of the Principle of 
Optimization at the Margin, which states that an optimal feasible alternative has the property 
that moving to it makes you better off and moving away from it makes you worse off.
It helps to visualize these ideas. Exhibit 3.8 plots the total cost of each apartment and the 
marginal cost of moving one apartment at a time farther away from the center of town. For 
instance, moving from Very Close to Close lowers total cost by $40. The dashed red line 
shows a change of −$40 between the total cost of Very Close and the total cost of Close.
Optimization using marginal analysis will always pick out a single optimal alternative 
when the total cost curve has the bowl-like shape in Exhibit 3.8. Where the total cost (in 
purple) is falling, marginal cost (in red) will be negative and marginal analysis will recom-
mend moving farther away from the city center, thereby lowering total cost. After total 
cost bottoms out, marginal cost will afterwards be positive, implying that the renter should 
move no farther out.
When the total cost curve is not bowl-shaped, the analysis gets more complicated, but 
even in this case, optimization in differences ultimately identifies the same optimum as 
optimization in levels.
Since optimization in levels and optimization in differences pick out the same op-
timum, you can use whichever method is easier for the particular problem that you are 
The Principle of Optimization at 
the Margin states that an optimal 
feasible alternative has the property 
that moving to it makes you better 
off and moving away from it makes 
you worse off.
Exhibit 3.8 Total Cost of Each 
Apartment and the Marginal

Apartments, Assuming an

The cost-minimizing choice 
is Apartment Far. We can see 
this by looking at total cost (in 
purple) or by looking at mar-
ginal cost (in red). Total cost 
is falling when marginal cost 
is negative. Total cost is rising 
when marginal cost is posi-
tive. Apartment Far is the only 
apartment that is better than 
all of its neighbors. Marginal 
cost is negative when moving 
to Apartment Far and marginal 
cost is positive when moving 
away from Apartment Far. Thus, 
Apartment Far is the only apart-
ment that satisfies the Principle 
of ­Optimization at the Margin.

analyzing. However, it is important to understand why economists mostly use optimization 
in ­differences—in other words, optimization at the margin. Optimization at the margin is 
simple because you can ignore everything about two alternatives that are being compared 
except the particular attributes that are different. Marginal analysis reminds you not to ana-
lyze information that will turn out to be irrelevant to your decision.
To sum up, optimization in differences has three steps:
	
1.	 Translate all costs and benefits into common units, like dollars per month.
	
2.	 Calculate the marginal consequences of moving between alternatives.
	
3.	 Apply the Principle of Optimization at the Margin by choosing the best alternative 
with the property that moving to it makes you better off and moving away from it 
makes you worse off.
 
Evidence-Based Economics
T
hroughout this chapter, we’ve been assuming that rental prices are higher near the 
city center, holding the quality of the apartment fixed. You may have wondered 
whether we had our facts right.
People often imagine dingy apartments downtown and nice houses out in the country. 
If we want to isolate the effect of location, we need to hold apartment quality constant 
and vary only location.
Economists Beth Wilson and James Frew assembled a database that contains infor-
mation on many apartments that were available for rent in Portland, Oregon.1 They used 
statistical techniques to effectively compare apartments near the city center to similar 
apartments that were farther away. Such analysis reveals a strong negative relationship 
between distance and rent, which is plotted in Exhibit 3.9.
Exhibit 3.9 was calculated for apartments that all have the following features—one 
bedroom, one bathroom, laundry unit in the apartment, covered parking, cable, and 
air-conditioning—and have none of the following features—a fireplace, access to an 
exercise room, or access to a pool. The analysis compares the rent of these apartments, 
holding all of their features constant except for the distance to the city center.
Q: How does location affect the rental cost of housing?

Evidence-Based Economics (Continued) 
Exhibit 3.9 confirms that proximity to the city center raises rents. The closer you get to 
the city, the higher the rent goes. For example, at a distance of 6 miles from the city center, 
the typical rent for an apartment with the specified features is nearly $1,000. For an apart-
ment that is 1 mile from the city center, the rent for the “same” apartment is $1,500.
Exhibit 3.9 also displays a noticeable flattening around 12 miles from the city center. 
Can you guess why rents stop changing in this region? The answer follows from consider-
ations about the opportunity cost of time and the structure of Portland’s highway system. 
Like most large cities, Portland has a ring of fast highways—a “ring road”—about 12 miles 
from the center of the city. People who live within a few miles of the ring road have the 
advantage of being near a highway system that speeds up travel time. Because of the ring 
roads, commute times change relatively little as you go from 9 miles to 14 miles away from 
the city center.
Scarcity, Prices, and Incentives
We can now come full circle and return to an important question that we asked previously. 
Why do rental prices fall as you move farther from the city center? What does this have to 
do with the topic of this chapter: optimization?

that don’t have the killer 
views. To an economist, this 
price differential is a good 
way of measuring the dollar 
value of a scarce resource: a 
room with a view.
We’ve shown that many optimizing commuters would love to live in the city center 
if the rental prices were the same downtown as they are in distant neighborhoods. But 
everyone can’t live downtown. Everyone can’t have a short commute. There just aren’t 
enough downtown apartments for everyone who would like one. That is an example of 
economic scarcity—one of the first concepts we studied in Chapter 1.
The market for apartments resolves the question of who gets to have the short com-
mute. Markets allow optimizing landlords and optimizing renters to freely negotiate 
the rental price of an apartment. In the marketplace, the rental price of apartments is 
determined by market forces rather than by politicians or regulators. The optimizers 
with the highest opportunity cost of time push up the rental price of apartments with the 
shortest commutes.
Market prices—here the rental price of apartments—provide incentives that implicitly 
allocate economic resources. As the price of downtown apartments rises, only workers with 
the highest opportunity cost of time will be willing to rent them. Most other workers will 
choose to move farther away and accept the consequences of a longer commute. That’s a 
trade-off—more time commuting in exchange for a lower monthly rent.
Market prices have the effect of allocating the downtown apartments to the people who 
are willing to pay the most for them. This allocation mechanism implies that mostly highly 
paid workers—and others with a high opportunity cost of time—tend to rent the apartments 
with the best locations.
Some critics of markets complain that markets are unfair—why should the highest-paid 
workers also get the apartments with the best locations? The defenders of markets respond 
that people are paying for the privilege of having a good apartment—the apartments with 
the best locations have higher rents—and the market allocation mechanism guarantees that 
people who are willing to pay the most for the best apartments get them. 
Understanding how the market allocation process works is the subject of our next ­chapter 
and many other chapters in this book. As we begin to discuss these issues, we want you 
to think about how society should ­determine the price of scarce resources, like downtown 
apartments. Should we have a system that allows optimizing landlords and optimizing rent-
ers to negotiate freely to ­determine rental prices for apartments? What if this produces a 
system in which the highest-paid workers are the only ones who can afford to live in the 
most convenient apartments? Is that inequitable? Can you think of a better way to allocate 
apartments?

Caveat
How does location affect  
the rental cost of housing?
In most cities, though not all, 
the farther you are from the 
city center, the more rental 
costs fall (holding apartment 
quality fixed). For example, in 
Portland, Oregon, rents fall 
by 33 percent as you move 
from the city center to oth-
erwise identical apartments 
6 miles out of town.

Oregon.
Though the analysis uses 
­special statistical techniques 
to compare similar apartments 
located at different distances 
from the city center, it is pos-
sible that some important 
apartment characteristics were 
not held fixed in the com-
parison. This would bias the 
calculations.

Summary
Economists believe that optimization describes, or at least approximates, many 
of the choices economic agents make. Economists believe that most people optimize 
most of the time. But economists don’t take optimization for granted. Economic re-
search attempts to answer the question: Do people optimize? Using optimization to 
describe and predict behavior is an example of positive economic analysis.
Optimization also provides an excellent toolbox—especially, cost-benefit 
analysis and marginal analysis—for improving decision making that is not 
already optimal. Using optimization to improve decision making is an example of 
normative economic analysis.
Optimization in levels has three steps: (1) translate all costs and benefits into 
common units, like dollars per month; (2) calculate the total net benefit of each 
alternative; (3) pick the alternative with the highest net benefit.
Optimization in differences analyzes the change in net benefits when you 
switch from one alternative to another. The most important example is marginal 
analysis, a cost-benefit calculation that focuses on the difference between one 
alternative and the next alternative. Marginal analysis compares the consequences 
of doing one step more of something. Marginal cost is the extra cost generated by 
moving from one alternative to the next alternative.
Optimization in differences has three steps: (1) translate all costs and 
benefits into common units, like dollars per month; (2) calculate the marginal 
consequences of moving between alternatives; (3) apply the Principle of 
Optimization at the Margin by choosing the best alternative with the property that 
moving to it makes you better off and moving away from it makes you worse off.
Optimization in levels and optimization in differences yield answers in 
agreement. These techniques are two sides of the same coin.

Problems
	 1.	 Suppose you as a risk-averse individual are making two 
different decisions: the first is to buy a financial stock, 
the second is to buy a good to consume. Identify how 
you would behave in each situation so as to optimize 
your choice. Does optimal choice always mean obtain-

	 2.	 When we consume an apple, we can evaluate its total util-
ity as well as its marginal utility.
	
a.	 Define the concept of marginal analysis in general.
	
b.	 What is the marginal utility in this case? Why is mar-
ginal utility more useful than total utility in the deci-
sion of optimal consumption?
	 3.	 Determine if the following statements better describe 
­optimization in levels or optimization in differences.
	
a.	 John is attempting to decide on a movie. He deter-
mines that the new Batman movie provides him with 
$5 more of a benefit than the new Spiderman movie.
	
b.	 Marcia finds that the net benefit of flying from 
­Chicago to Honolulu on a non-stop United Airlines 
flight is $400, and the net benefit for the same trip fly-
ing on a one-stop American Airlines flight is $200.
	
c.	 Nikki decided to take the first available parking space 
as she entered the student lot. She felt that the first 
available space had a $5 premium compared with all 
other possible spaces because she did not want to risk 
being late for her exam.
	
d.	 Reagan determined that the net benefit of taking the 
combination of two lecture courses and an online lec-
ture course was $100. The same three courses online 
gave her a net benefit of $80, and all three in a lecture-
based format gave her a net benefit of $90.
	 4.	 You are taking two courses this semester, biology and 
chemistry. You have quizzes coming up in both classes. 
The following table shows your grade on each quiz for 
different numbers of hours studying for each quiz. (For 
the purposes of this problem, assume that each hour of 
study time can’t be subdivided.) For instance, the table 
implies that if you studied 1 hour on Chemistry and  
2 hours on Biology you would get a 77 on Chemistry and 
a 74 on Biology.

	 Your goal is to maximize your average grade on the two quiz-
zes. Use the idea of optimization in differences to decide how 
much time you would spend studying for each quiz if you 
had only 1 hour in total to prepare for the two exams (in other 
words, you will study for 1 hour on one exam and 0 hours on 
the other exam). How would you allocate that single hour of 
study time across the two subjects? Now repeat the analysis 
assuming that you have 2 hours in total to prepare for the two 
exams. How would you allocate those 2 hours across the two 
subjects? Finally, repeat the analysis assuming that you have 
three hours in ­total to prepare for the two exams. How would 
you allocate those 3 hours across the two subjects?

following tax rates: if your income is $30,000 or less you 
pay no income tax; if your income is above $30,000, you 
pay 30 percent of the amount above $30,000. And so, for 
­example, someone who earns $60,000 would pay 30% × 
($60,000 − $30,000) = $9,000.
Your marginal tax rate is defined as the taxes you pay 
if you earn one more dollar. Your average tax rate is de-
fined as the total taxes you pay divided by your income. 
And so, to continue with this example, someone who 
earns $60,000 would have a marginal tax rate of 30 per-
cent and an average tax rate of $9,000/$60,000 = 15%.
You have three alternatives. You could not work at all, 
you could work half time, or you could work full time. 
If you do not work at all, you will earn $0; if you work 
half-time you will earn $30,000; and if you work full-time, 
you will earn $60,000. Any time you do not work, you can 
spend surfing. You love to surf: surfing full-time is worth 
$50,000 per year to you, surfing half-time is worth $25,000 
per year to you, and not surfing at all is worth nothing to 
you. As you are making your decision about how much  
to work, should you pay attention to your average tax rate 
or to your marginal tax rate? Explain your answer carefully.

$15,000, while the fixed costs are equal to $5,000. What 
is the marginal cost of producing the 101st unit? Suppose 
that these variable costs are composed of 10 workers and

During 2013, the retail price of a gallon of ­gasoline in the United States 
fluctuated between $3 and $4 per gallon. How much gasoline do 
you buy now? How much would you buy if the price were lower—say, 
$1 per gallon? How low would it have to go to tempt you to take lots of 
road trips? What if the price were $0.04 per gallon, so that gasoline was 
practically free? Amazingly, that’s what Venezuelans paid for gas in 2013, due to 
an extraordinary government subsidy.
In this chapter, we study how buyers and sellers respond to the changing 
price of goods and services, and we use the energy market and gasoline as our 
leading example. How does the price of gas affect the decisions of gas buyers, 
like households, and gas sellers, like ExxonMobil? How do the decisions of 
buyers and sellers jointly determine the price of gas when it isn’t dictated by 
government policies?
How much more gasoline 
would people buy if its 
price were lower?

Every year over one billion drivers pull into gas stations around the world. These driv-
ers almost never find that gas stations are “sold out.” Most of the time, it takes less than  
10 minutes to fill the tank and pull back on the road.
The efficiency of this system is amazing. Nobody tells the companies that run the gas 
stations how many drivers to expect, and nobody tells the drivers where to fill their tanks. 
No “fill ‘er up” tickets are presold by Ticketmaster or Live Nation. But somehow, there 
is almost always enough gas for every driver who wants to fill the tank. Drivers get the 
gas they are willing to pay for, and gasoline companies make enough money to pay their 
­employees and send dividends to their shareholders.
This chapter is about how the gasoline market and other markets like it work.  
A market is a group of economic agents who are trading a good or service, and the rules 
and arrangements for trading. Agricultural and industrial goods like wheat, soybeans, 
iron, and coal are all traded on markets. A market may have a specific physical location—
like Holland’s Aalsmeer Flower Auction—or not. For example, the market for gasoline 
is ­dispersed—located on every corner you find a gas station. Likewise, Monster.com  
(a ­Web-based job market) operates wherever there’s a computer and an Internet connec-
tion. To an economist, dating Web sites like okcupid.com or 
­christianmingle.com are markets, too.
We focus the discussion on markets in which all exchanges 
occur voluntarily at flexible prices. This chapter explains how 
markets use prices to allocate goods and services. Prices act as 
a selection device that encourages trade between the sellers who 
can produce goods at low cost and the buyers who place a high 
value on the goods.
We will illustrate all of this by studying the market for gaso-
line, which is refined from crude oil, as well as the broader mar-
ket for energy. You’ll see that the price of gasoline is set in a way

KEY IDEAS
In a perfectly competitive market, (1) sellers all sell an identical good or 
service, and (2) any individual buyer or any individual seller isn’t powerful 
enough on his or her own to affect the market price of that good or service.
The demand curve plots the relationship between the market price and 
the quantity of a good demanded by buyers.
The supply curve plots the relationship between the market price and 
the quantity of a good supplied by sellers.
The competitive equilibrium price equates the quantity demanded and 
the quantity supplied.
When prices are not free to fluctuate, markets fail to equate quantity 
demanded and quantity supplied.

that implies that gas stations are ready to sell a quantity of gasoline that is equal to the 
quantity of gasoline that drivers want to buy.
Competitive Markets
Think of a city filled with hundreds of gas stations, each of which has an independent 
owner. The gas station on your block would lose most of its business if the owner started 
charging $1 more per gallon than all of the other stations. Likewise, you 
wouldn’t be able to fill your tank if you drove around town offering gas 
station attendants $1 less per gallon than they were charging their other 
customers. Gas station attendants usually don’t cut special deals with 
individual customers. Drivers of Cadillacs and Kias pay the same price 
for a gallon of regular unleaded.
To prove that pleading poverty and haggling for a better gas price 
won’t work, try bargaining for a discount the next time you need to fill 
your tank. Try this only if you have enough gas to reach the next station.
If all sellers and all buyers face the same price, that price is referred 
to as the market price. In a perfectly competitive market, (1) sellers 
all sell an identical good or service, and (2) any individual buyer or 
any individual seller isn’t powerful enough on his or her own to affect 
the market price. This implies that buyers and sellers are all price-
takers. In other words, they accept the market price and can’t bargain 
for a better price.
Very few, if any, markets are perfectly competitive. But economists 
try to understand such markets anyway. At first this sounds kind of 
nutty. Why would economists study a thing that rarely exists in the 
world? The answer is that ­although few, if any, markets are perfectly 
competitive, many markets are nearly perfectly competitive. Many gas 
stations do have nearby competitors—often right across the street—
that prevent them from charging more than the market price. There 
are some gas stations that don’t have such nearby competitors—think 
of an isolated station on a country road—but such examples are the 
exception. If sellers have nearly identical goods and most market

A price-taker is a buyer or seller who 
accepts the market price—buyers 
can’t bargain for a lower price and 
sellers can’t bargain for a higher price.
When two gas stations are ­located at the same 
­intersection, their prices tend to be very close, and 
sometimes are ­exactly the same.

participants face lots of competition, then the perfectly competitive model is a good 
­approximation of how actual markets work.
On the other hand, there are some markets in which large market participants—­like 
Microsoft in the software market—can single-handedly control market prices; we’ll come 
to markets like that in later chapters.
In this chapter, our goal is to understand the properties of markets that have flexible 
prices and are perfectly competitive (identical goods and market participants who can’t 
influence the market price). Along the way, we’ll ask three questions.
	
1.	 How do buyers behave?
	
2.	 How do sellers behave?
	
3.	 How does the behavior of buyers and sellers jointly determine the market price and 
the quantity of goods transacted?
Each of the next three sections addresses one of these fundamental questions.
We start by studying the behavior of buyers. We assume that these buyers are price-takers: 
they treat the market price as a take-it-or-leave-it offer and don’t try to haggle to lower the 
price. We want to study the relationship between the price of a good and the amount of the 
good that buyers are willing to purchase. At a given price, the amount of the good or service 
that buyers are willing to purchase is called the quantity demanded.
To illustrate the concept of quantity demanded, think about your own buying behavior. 
When gas prices rise, do you tend to buy less gas? For example, if gas prices rise, a student 
who lives off campus might bike to school instead of driving. She might join a carpool or 
shift to public transportation. If gas prices rise high enough, she might sell her gas guzzler 
altogether. Even a student who lives on campus might cut back her gasoline consump-
tion. During spring break, she might take the bus from Boston to her parents’ home in 
­Washington, D.C., rather than driving her car.
Let’s quantify these kinds of adjustments. Take Chloe, a typical consumer who responds to 
increases in gasoline prices by ­reducing her purchases of gasoline. Chloe may not be able to 
adjust her gasoline consumption immediately, but in the long run she will use less gas if the 
price of gas ­increases—for instance, by switching to public transportation. The relationship 
­between Chloe’s purchases of gasoline and the price of gasoline is summarized in the shaded 
How Do Buyers Behave?
4.2 
Quantity demanded is the amount 
of a good that buyers are willing to 
purchase at a given price.
From 2005 to 2008, gasoline prices rose by 30 percent and Hummer sales fell by 
50 percent. At that time, no other car brand experienced sales declines that were this 
steep. Hummer demand fell so quickly that General Motors shut down the brand in 2010.

Two variables are negatively related 
if the variables move in the opposite 
direction.

the quantity demanded rises when 
the price falls (holding all else equal).

box in the upper-right corner of Exhibit 4.1. This ­table reports the quantity demanded at dif-
ferent prices and it is called a demand schedule. Chloe’s demand schedule for gasoline tells 
us how Chloe’s gasoline purchases change as the price of gas changes, holding all else equal. 
The phrase “holding all else equal” implies that everything other than the price of gas is held 
constant or fixed, including income, rent, and highway tolls. The demand schedule reveals that 
Chloe increases the quantity of gasoline that she purchases as the price of gasoline falls. 
Demand Curves
We’ll often want to plot a demand schedule. That is what the demand curve does. The 
­demand curve plots the relationship between prices and quantity demanded (again, hold-
ing all else equal). In Exhibit 4.1, each dot plots a single point from the demand schedule. 
For example, the leftmost dot represents the point at which the price is $6 per gallon and 
the quantity demanded is 50 gallons of gasoline per year. Similarly, the rightmost dot repre-
sents the point at which the price is $1 per gallon and the quantity demanded is 300 ­gallons 
of gasoline per year. Notice that the horizontal axis (the x-axis) represents the quantity 
demanded. The vertical axis (the y-axis) represents the price per gallon. Economists always 
adopt this plotting convention—quantity demanded on the horizontal axis and price on the 
vertical axis. Economists usually “connect the dots” as we have in Exhibit 4.1, which im-
plies that prices and quantities demanded don’t always have to be round numbers.
The demand curve has an important property that we will see many times. The price of 
gasoline and the quantity demanded are negatively related, which means that they move in 
opposite directions. In other words, when one goes up, the other goes down, and vice versa. 
In Chloe’s case, a gas price of $6/gallon generates a quantity demanded of 50 gallons per 
year, and a price of $1/gallon generates a much greater quantity demanded of 300 gallons 
per year. The price of gas and the quantity demanded move in opposite directions.
Almost all goods have demand curves that exhibit this fundamental negative relation-
ship, which economists call the Law of Demand: the quantity demanded rises when the 
price falls (holding all else equal).
In this book all demand curves, demand schedules, and graph labels related to demand 
are in blue.
Willingness to Pay
Chloe’s demand curve can also be used to calculate how much she is willing (and able) to 
pay for an additional gallon of gasoline. One extra gallon of gasoline is called a marginal

constant. The Latin phrase ceteris 
paribus means “with other things 
the same” and is sometimes used in 
economic writing to mean the same 
thing as “holding all else equal.”
The demand curve plots the 
quantity demanded at different 
prices. A demand curve plots the 
demand schedule.

gallon. The height of her demand curve at any given quantity is the amount she is willing 
to pay for that marginal unit of the good. In other words, the height of her demand curve is 
the value in dollars that Chloe places on that last gallon of gasoline.
For example, Chloe is willing to pay $4 for her 150th gallon of gasoline. In other words, 
with 149 gallons already at her at her disposal in one year, Chloe’s willingness to pay for 
an additional gallon of gasoline is $4. Willingness to pay is the highest price that a buyer 
is willing to pay for an extra unit of a good.
On the other hand, Chloe is willing to pay only $3 for a marginal gallon of gasoline if 
she already has 199 gallons (for use that year). Chloe’s willingness to pay for an additional 
gallon is negatively related to the quantity that she already has—this is the quantity on the 
horizontal axis in Exhibit 4.1. The more gasoline that she already has, the less she is will-
ing to pay for an additional gallon. For most goods and services, this negative relationship 
applies. The more you have of something—for instance, slices of pizza—the less gain there 
is from acquiring another unit of the same good.
This is an example of a concept called diminishing marginal benefit: as you consume 
more of a good, your willingness to pay for an additional unit declines. An easy way to 
remember this concept is to think about donuts. My first donut in the morning is worth a lot 
to me so I am willing to pay a lot for it. My fourth donut in the same sitting is worth much 
less to me, so I am willing to pay less for it. In general, the more donuts I eat, the less I am 
willing to pay for an extra donut.
From Individual Demand Curves to Aggregated  
Demand Curves
So far we’ve talked about a single consumer, Chloe. But we can easily extend the ideas that 
we have discussed to all buyers of gasoline, including consumers and firms.
Think about the worldwide market for energy. Chloe’s demand curve implies that she 
will increase her use of gasoline when the price of gasoline goes down. Other gasoline us-
ers will also increase their consumption of gasoline as its price falls.
Though all individual demand curves are downward-sloping, that’s about all they have 
in common. For example, a schoolteacher in Kenya may earn $1,000 per year. For any 
given price of gasoline, the schoolteacher probably won’t consume nearly as much gaso-
line as a typical worker in the United States (who has about 50 times as much income to 
spend).
This leaves us with a challenge. How do we account for the gasoline demand of billions 
of consumers worldwide? All of their demand curves will obey the Law of Demand, but 
otherwise they won’t look alike. To study the behavior of the worldwide energy market, 
economists need to study the worldwide demand curve for gasoline, which is equivalent 
to the sum of all the individual demand curves. Economists call this adding-up process the 
aggregation of the individual demand curves.
We’ll begin by showing you how to add up the demand of just two individual buyers. 
We’ll first teach you how to do it with demand schedules. Then we’ll show you what that 
implies for plotted demand curves. Remember that these different ways of thinking about 
demand are equivalent. Each method reinforces the other.
Exhibit 4.2 contains two individual demand schedules and a total demand schedule. 
To calculate the total quantity demanded at a particular price, simply add up Sue’s and 
Carlos’s quantity demanded at that price. For example, at a price of $4 per gallon, Sue 
has a quantity demanded of 200 gallons per year. At that same price, Carlos has a quantity 
demanded of 400 gallons per year. So the aggregate level of quantity demanded at a price 
of $4 per gallon is 200 + 400 = 600 gallons per year.
Conceptually, aggregating quantity demanded means fixing the price and adding up the 
quantities that each buyer demands. It is important to remember that quantities are being 
added together, not prices. Here’s an example to help you remember this point. Consider a 
bakery selling donuts at $1 each. Suppose that two hungry students walk into the bakery and 
each wants a donut. The total quantity demanded by the two students would be two donuts at 
a price of $1 per donut. Remember this tale of two donuts and you’ll avoid getting confused 
when you calculate total demand schedules.
Exhibit 4.2 also contains plotted demand curves. When a demand curve is a straight 
line, as in this exhibit, the relationship between price and quantity demanded is said to 
Willingness to pay is the highest 
price that a buyer is willing to pay 
for an extra unit of a good.
Diminishing marginal benefit: As 
you consume more of a good, your 
willingness to pay for an additional 
unit declines.
The process of adding up individual 
behaviors is referred to as 
aggregation.

be linear. Economists often illustrate demand curves with straight lines because they are 
easy to explain and easy to express as equations. On the other hand, real-world demand 
curves don’t tend to be perfectly straight lines, so the linear model is mostly used as an 
illustrative case.
The plotted demand curves in Exhibit 4.2 can be aggregated the same way that the 
­demand schedules are aggregated. Again, look at the quantities demanded at a single price, 
say $4 per gallon. Sue’s demand curve has a quantity demanded of 200 gallons per year. 
­Carlos’s ­demand curve has a quantity demanded of 400 gallons per year. Total quantity 
demanded at a price of $4 per gallon is the sum of the two individual quantities demanded: 
200 + 400 = 600 gallons per year.
Building the Market Demand Curve
Exhibit 4.2 shows you how to add up demand curves for just two buyers. We would like to 
study the demand of all buyers in a market. Economists refer to this as the market demand 
curve. It is the sum of the individual demand curves of all the potential buyers. The market 
demand curve plots the relationship between the total quantity demanded and the market 
price, holding all else equal.
Over 1 billion economic agents purchase gasoline every year. If we added up the total 
quantity of gasoline demanded at a particular market price, we could calculate the market 
demand for gasoline at that price. But economists rarely study the market demand for 
gasoline. Economists who study energy markets recognize that the gasoline market is very 
closely tied to all of the other markets for products produced from crude oil. Jet fuel, diesel 
fuel, and automobile gasoline are all produced from oil. Accordingly, when economists 
study the market for gasoline, we aggregate to the total market for oil. Exhibit 4.3 reports 
a rough approximation of the worldwide demand curve for billions of “barrels of oil” 
(there are 42 gallons per barrel), which is the unit of measurement that is commonly used 
in this market.
The market demand curve is the 
sum of the individual demand curves 
of all the potential buyers. It plots 
the relationship between the total 
quantity demanded and the market 
price, holding all else equal.

Finally, note that the demand curve in Exhibit 4.3 is not a straight line, and therefore 
looks a bit different from the straight demand curves that you saw earlier. This serves as 
a reminder that the key property of a demand curve is the negative relationship between 
price and quantity demanded. Demand curves can exhibit this negative relationship without 
being straight lines.
Exhibit 4.3 also contains a horizontal dashed line that represents the market price of 
oil from 2011 to 2013: $100 per barrel. The horizontal price line crosses the demand 
curve at a point labeled with a dot. At this intersection the buyers’ willingness to pay  
(the height of the demand curve) is equal to the market price of oil. Buyers keep purchasing 
oil as long as their willingness to pay is greater than or equal to the price of oil. At a market 
price of $100 per barrel, the demand curve implies that buyers will keep purchasing oil 
until they reach a quantity demanded of 35 billion barrels of oil per year.
Shifting the Demand Curve
When we introduced the demand curve, we explained that it describes the relationship be-
tween price and quantity demanded, holding all else equal. It’s now time to more carefully 
consider the “all else” that is being held fixed.
The demand curve shifts when these five major factors change:
• Tastes and preferences
• Income and wealth
• Availability and prices of related goods
• Number and scale of buyers
• Buyers’ beliefs about the future
Changing Tastes and Preferences  A change in tastes or preferences is simply a change 
in what we personally like, enjoy, or value. For example, your demand for oil products would 
fall (holding price fixed) if you became convinced that global warming was a significant global 
problem and it was your ethical duty to use fewer fossil fuels. Because your willingness to buy 
oil products decreases as a result of your growing environmental worries, your demand curve 
shifts to the left. We refer to this as a “left” shift in the demand curve because a lower quantity 
demanded for a given price of oil corresponds to a leftward movement on the horizontal axis. 
If many people have experiences like this—say an environmental documentary convinces 
millions of drivers to buy hybrids—then the market demand curve will experience a shift to 
the left. See Exhibit 4.4 for an example of a left shift in a demand curve.
Naturally, a taste change could also shift a demand curve to the right, corresponding to an in-
crease in the quantity demanded at a given market price. For example, this would happen to your 
individual demand curve if you started dating someone who lives a few towns away, thereby 
increasing your transportation needs. Exhibit 4.4 also plots a right shift in a demand curve.

For an inferior good, rising 
­income shifts the demand curve 
to the left. No insult intended to 
Spam lovers.
This example illustrates two key concepts:
• The demand curve shifts only when the quantity demanded changes at a given 
price. Left and right shifts are illustrated in panel (a) of Exhibit 4.4.
• If a good’s own price changes and its demand curve hasn’t shifted, the own price 
change produces a movement along the demand curve. Movements along the de-
mand curve are illustrated in panel (b) of Exhibit 4.4.
It is important to master these terms, because they will keep coming up. Use Exhibit 4.4 
to confirm that you know the difference between a “shift of the demand curve” and a 
“movement along the demand curve.” It helps to remember that if the quantity demanded 
changes at a given price, then the demand curve has shifted.
We now continue with a discussion of the key factors, other than tastes and 
preferences, that shift the demand curve.
Changing Income or Changing Wealth  A change in income or a 
change in wealth affects your ability to pay for goods and services. Imagine 
that you recently got your first full-time job and went from a student budget 
to a $40,000 annual salary. You might buy a car and the gas to go with it. 
You’d probably also start taking more exotic vacations: for instance, flying 
to Hawaii rather than taking the bus to visit your friends in Hackensack. Your 
willingness (directly and indirectly) to buy fuel will now be higher, holding 
the price of fuel fixed, implying that your demand curve shifts to the right. For 
a normal good, an increase in income causes the demand curve to shift to the 
right (holding the good’s price fixed).
On the other hand, consider a good like Spam, which is canned, precooked 
meat. In the developed world, as people’s incomes rise, they are likely to con-
sume fewer canned foods and more fresh foods. If rising income shifts the de-
mand curve for a good to the left (holding the good’s price fixed), then the good is called an 
inferior good. This seemingly insulting label is actually only a technical term that describes 
a relationship between increases in income and leftward shifts in the demand curve.
Changing Availability and Prices of Related Goods  A change in the availability 
and prices of related goods will also influence demand for oil products (holding the price of 
The demand curve shifts only when 
the quantity demanded changes at a 
given price.
If a good’s own price changes 
and its demand curve hasn’t 
shifted, the own price change 
produces a movement along the 
demand curve.  
4.2
Exhibit 4.4 Shifts of 
the Demand Curve vs. 
Movement Along the 
Demand Curve
Many factors other than 
a good’s price affect the 
quantity demanded. If a 
change in these factors 
reduces the quantity de-
manded at a given price, 
then the demand curve 
shifts left (panel (a)). If a 
change in these factors 
increases the quantity de-
manded at a given price, 
then the demand curve 
shifts right (panel (a)).  
On the other hand, if only 
the good’s own price 
changes, then the ­demand 
curve does not shift 
and we move along the 
­demand curve (panel (b)).

For an inferior good, an increase in 
income causes the demand curve to 
shift to the left (holding the good’s 
price fixed).
Two goods are substitutes when 
the fall in the price of one leads to 
a left shift in the demand curve for 
the other.
Two goods are complements when 
the fall in the price of one, leads to 
a right shift in the demand curve for 
the other.

Evidence-Based Economics
W
e’ve explained that the quantity of gasoline demanded falls as the price rises. 
We’re now ready to study empirical evidence that backs this up.
Brazil and Venezuela share a border, and they have similar levels of income 
per person. Both are also large oil producers—each produced about 3 million barrels per 
day in 2013. However, they have radically different energy policies. Like most countries, 
Brazil heavily taxes the sale of gasoline. In contrast, Venezuela aggressively subsidizes 
the sale of gasoline. To compare their policies, we report the U.S. dollar price of gasoline 
in 2013, when Brazilian drivers paid $5.58 per gallon and Venezuelan drivers paid only 
$0.04 per gallon. The Venezuelan government provided enough of a subsidy to make

oil fixed), thereby shifting the demand curve for oil. For example, if a city cuts the price of 
public transportation, drivers are likely to partially cut back use of their cars. This produces 
a left shift in the demand curve for gas. Two goods are said to be substitutes when the fall in 
the price of one leads to a left shift in the demand curve for the other. Public transportation 
and gas are substitutes, because a fall in the price of public transportation leads people to 
drive their cars less, producing a left shift in the demand curve for gas.
On the other hand, there are some related goods and services that play the opposite role. 
For example, suppose that a ski resort located 200 miles from where you live decreases its 
lift ticket prices. The price cut will lead some people to increase their visits to the ski ­resort, 
thereby increasing their transportation needs and shifting right their ­demand curve for gas. 
Two goods are said to be complements when the fall in the price of one good, leads to a right 
shift in the demand curve for the other good.
Changing Number and Scale of Buyers  When the number of buyers increases, the 
demand curve shifts right. When the number of buyers decreases, the demand curve shifts 
left. The scale of the buyers’ purchasing behavior also matters. For example, if the mayor 
of a small town switches all of the town buses from gasoline to battery power, this will have 
a much smaller impact on worldwide gasoline demand than a switch by the mayor of the 
world’s largest city, Tokyo.
Changing Buyers’ Beliefs About the Future  Changing buyers’ beliefs about the 
future also influence the demand curve. Suppose that some people begin losing their jobs 
during the first months of an economy-wide slowdown. Even if you hadn’t lost your job, 
you might still be worried. You could lose your job at some point in the near future, and 
anticipating this possibility might lead you to build up a rainy-day fund right now. To do this, 
you might cut your spending by carpooling or eliminating weekend trips to local ski resorts. 
Such belt-tightening tends to reduce gas usage and shifts the demand curve for oil to the left.

gasoline practically free. The Venezuelan government is a major oil producer and supplies 
enough gas to meet consumer demand, even when the price was $0.04 per gallon.
The Law of Demand predicts that a lower price should be associated with a higher quan-
tity demanded, all else held equal. In fact, per person gasoline consumption is almost five 
times higher in Venezuela than in Brazil.
Exhibit 4.5 plots the price of gasoline on the vertical axis (including taxes and subsi-
dies) and the quantity of gasoline demanded on the horizontal axis. As you can see, there 
is a negative relationship between price and quantity demanded. We’ve also added Mexico 
to this figure to give you a sense of how another Latin American country (with similar per 
person income) compares. Mexico provides a small subsidy on gasoline and consequently 
falls between the other two countries. The Law of Demand predicts a negative relationship 
between price and quantity demanded, and the data confirms that prediction.

Quantity supplied is the amount 
of a good or service that sellers are 
willing to sell at a given price.
You now understand the behavior of buyers. To understand the complete picture of a 
­market, we also need to study sellers. The interaction of buyers and sellers in a marketplace 
determines the market price.
We want to analyze the relationship between the price of a good and the amount of the 
good that sellers are willing to sell or supply. At a given price, the amount of the good or 
service that sellers are willing to supply is called the quantity supplied. Note that in this 
book, all supply curves, supply schedules, and graph labels relating to supply are in red.
To build intuition for the concept of quantity supplied, think about a company like 
­ExxonMobil. As the price of oil goes up, ExxonMobil increases its willingness to sup-
ply oil that is relatively expensive for the company to discover and extract. Some oil is in 
deep-water locations where the ocean depth is 2 miles and the oil is another 8 miles below 
the seafloor. Such wells are drilled by specialized ships two football fields long, which are 
staffed by hundreds of workers and equipped with robotic, unmanned submarines. Because 
of the enormous expense, such wells are only drilled when the 
price of oil is over $70 per barrel.
Drilling for oil from offshore platforms above the Arctic Cir-
cle is even more costly. If a single small iceberg could sink the 
Titanic, imagine the challenge of building and protecting oil rigs 
in areas where tens of thousands of large icebergs pass each year. 
Offshore oil wells within the Arctic Circle are only drilled when 
the price of oil is over $80 per barrel.
The higher the price of oil goes, the more drilling locations 
become profitable for ­ExxonMobil. Many observers talk about 
oil and warn that we are running out of it. In fact, companies like 
ExxonMobil are only running out of cheap oil. There is more oil 
under the surface of the earth than we are ever going to use. The 
problem is that much of that oil is very expensive to extract and 
deliver to the market.
Supply Curves
ExxonMobil responds to increases in the price of oil by developing new oil fields in ever 
more challenging locations. The relationship between ExxonMobil’s production of oil and 
the price of oil is summarized in the boxed supply schedule in Exhibit 4.6. A supply ­schedule 
How Do Sellers Behave?
4.3 
A supply schedule is a table that 
reports the quantity supplied at 
different prices, holding all else equal.
Exhibit 4.6 ExxonMobil’s 
Supply Schedule for Oil 
and Supply Curve for Oil
The quantity supplied 
rises with the price of oil, 
so quantity supplied and 
price are positively related. 
Equivalently, we could 
say that the supply curve 
is ­upward-sloping—the 
height of the curve rises as 
we move from left to right 
along the horizontal axis.
Drilling from offshore platforms above the Arctic Circle is not 
­profitable unless the price of oil exceeds $80 per barrel. At 
the other extreme, oil from the ­deserts of Saudi Arabia costs 
less than $20 per barrel to extract.

The market supply curve is the 
sum of the individual supply curves 
of all the potential sellers. It plots 
the relationship between the total 
quantity supplied and the market 
price, holding all else equal.
The supply curve plots the quantity 
supplied at different prices. A supply 
curve plots the supply schedule.
Two variables are positively related 
if the variables move in the same 
direction.
Law of Supply: In almost all cases, 
the quantity supplied rises when the 
price rises (holding all else equal).
is a table that reports the quantity supplied at different prices, holding all else equal. The sup-
ply schedule shows that ExxonMobil increases the quantity of oil supplied as the price of 
oil increases. Exhibit 4.6 also plots ExxonMobil’s supply curve, which plots the quantity 
supplied at different prices. In other words, a supply curve plots the supply schedule.
The supply curve in Exhibit 4.6 has a key property. The price of oil and the quantity 
supplied are positively related. By positively related we mean that the variables move in 
the same direction—when one variable goes up, the other goes up, too. In almost all cases, 
quantity supplied and price are positively related (holding all else equal), which economists 
call the Law of Supply.
ExxonMobil starts to produce oil when the price exceeds a level of $10 per barrel. An 
oil price of $50 per barrel generates a quantity supplied of 1.2 billion barrels per year. A 
higher oil price of $100 per barrel generates a higher quantity supplied of 1.5 billion barrels 
per year. At the highest price of oil listed in the supply schedule, the quantity supplied rises 
further to 1.7 billion barrels per year.
Willingness to Accept
If ExxonMobil is optimizing, the firm should be willing to supply one additional barrel of 
oil if it is paid at least its marginal cost of production. Recall from the chapter on optimiza-
tion (Chapter 3) that marginal cost is the extra cost generated by producing an additional 
unit. As long as an oil producer is paid at least its marginal cost per barrel, it should be 
willing to supply another barrel of oil.
For an optimizing firm, the height of the supply curve is the firm’s marginal cost. For 
example, ExxonMobil’s supply curve implies that if the price of oil is $100, then the quan-
tity supplied is 1.5 billion barrels per year. We can turn this around and say it another 
way—ExxonMobil is willing to accept $100 to produce its 1.5 billionth barrel of oil. That’s 
what the supply curve tells us. Economists call this ExxonMobil’s willingness to accept, 
which is the lowest price that a seller is willing to get paid to sell an extra unit of a good. 
For an optimizing firm, willingness to accept is the same as the marginal cost of pro-
duction. ­ExxonMobil is willing to accept $100 for an additional barrel, because $100 is 
­ExxonMobil’s marginal cost when it produces its 1.5 billionth barrel in a year.
From the Individual Supply Curve to the Market Supply Curve
When we studied buyers, we summed up their individual demand curves to obtain a market 
demand curve. We’re now ready to do the same thing for the sellers. Adding up quantity 
supplied works the same way as adding up quantity demanded. We add up quantities at 
a particular price. We then repeat this at every possible price to plot the market supply 
curve. The market supply curve plots the relationship between the total quantity supplied 
and the market price, holding all else equal.
Let’s start with an aggregation analysis that assumes there are only two oil companies, 
ExxonMobil and Chevron. Assume that they have the supply schedules listed in ­Exhibit 4.7. 
At a price of $100 per barrel, the quantity supplied by Chevron is 1 billion barrels of oil per 
year and the quantity supplied by ExxonMobil is 1.5 billion barrels of oil per year. So the 
total quantity supplied at the price of $100 per barrel is 1 billion + 1.5 billion = 2.5 billion 
barrels of oil per year. To calculate the total supply curve, we repeat this calculation for 
each price. The resulting total supply curve is plotted in Exhibit 4.7.
Of course, the market contains thousands of oil producers, not just ExxonMobil and 
Chevron. The market supply curve is the sum of the individual supply curves of all these 
thousands of potential sellers, just as the market demand curve is the sum of the individual 
demand curves of all the potential buyers.
Aggregating the individual supply curves of thousands of oil producers yields a market 
supply curve like the one plotted in Exhibit 4.8. We’ve included a dashed line at $100/barrel, 
which is the approximate market price that prevailed in the world oil market from 2011 to 
2013. At this price, the total quantity supplied is 35 billion barrels of oil per year.
Shifting the Supply Curve
Recall that the supply curve describes the relationship between price and quantity 
supplied, holding all else equal. There are four major types of variables that are held 
Willingness to accept is the lowest 
price that a seller is willing to get 
paid to sell an extra unit of a good. 
Willingness to accept is the same as 
the marginal cost of production.

Changing Prices of Inputs Used to Produce the Good  Changes in the prices of 
inputs shift the supply curve. An input is a good or service used to produce another good or 
service. For instance, steel is used to construct oil platforms, to create oil drilling machinery,

Many factors other than 
a good’s price affect the 
quantity supplied. If a 
change in these factors 
decreases the quantity 
supplied at a given price, 
then the supply curve 
shifts left (panel (a)). If a 
change in these factors 
increases the quantity 
supplied at a given price, 
then the supply curve 
shifts right (panel (a)). On 
the other hand, if only 
the good’s own price 
changes, then the supply 
curve does not shift and 
we move along the supply 
curve (panel (b)).

A photograph of a Libyan oil 
refinery burning during the 2011

Muammar Gaddafi. During the 
war almost all of Libya’s oil pro-
duction was shut down, shifting 
the world oil supply curve to 
the left.
to build pipelines, and to construct oil tankers. Hence, steel is a critical input to oil production. 
An increase in the price of steel implies that some opportunities to produce oil will no longer 
be profitable, and therefore optimizing oil producers will choose not to supply as much oil 
(holding the price of oil fixed). It follows that an increase in the price of steel shifts the 
supply curve of oil to the left. In other words, holding the price of oil fixed, the quantity of oil 
supplied falls. On the other hand, a fall in the price of steel shifts the supply curve of oil to the 
right. Panel (a) of Exhibit 4.9 plots these left and right shifts in the supply curve.
This example illustrates two key concepts:
• The supply curve shifts only when the quantity supplied changes at a given price. 
Left and right shifts are illustrated in panel (a) of Exhibit 4.9.
• If a good’s own price changes and its supply curve hasn’t shifted, the own price 
change produces a movement along the supply curve. Movements along the supply 
curve are illustrated in panel (b) of Exhibit 4.9.
Changes in Technology Used to Produce the Good  Changes in 
technology also shift the supply curve. In recent years, “fracking” (induced 
hydraulic fracturing) has revolutionized the energy industry. This technology 
uses pressurized fluids to create fractures in the underground rock formations 
that surround a drilled well. The fractures enable oil and natural gas to seep out 
of the rock and be drawn from the well. Fracking has caused a right shift in the 
supply curves for petroleum and natural gas.
Changes in the Number and Scale of Sellers  Changes in the number 
of sellers also shift the supply curve. For example, in 2011 Libyan rebels 
overthrew Muammar Gaddafi, a dictator who had controlled the country for 
42 years. Gaddafi loyalists defended his regime and the fighting dragged on for 
6 months. During this period, Libya essentially stopped oil production. Before 
the war, Libyan wells had been producing about 1.5 million barrels per day. This is the scale 
of Libyan production. During the Libyan civil war, the worldwide supply curve shifted to the 
left by 1.5 million barrels per day.
Changes in Sellers’ Beliefs About the Future  Finally, changes in sellers’ beliefs 
about the future shift the supply curve. For example, consider the market for natural gas. 
Every winter, natural gas usage skyrockets for home heating. This creates a winter spike in 
The supply curve shifts only when 
the quantity supplied changes at a 
given price.
If a good’s own price changes and 
its supply curve hasn’t shifted, 
the own price change produces a 
movement along the supply curve.

natural gas prices. Expecting such price spikes, natural gas producers store vast quantities 
during the summer (when prices are low by comparison). In other words, natural gas 
producers use much of their summer natural gas production to build up stockpiles instead 
of selling all of the summer production to the public. This implies that natural gas suppliers 
shift the supply curve to the left in the summer. This is an optimization strategy. By pulling 
supply off the (low-price) summer market and increasing supply in the (high-price) winter 
market, natural gas suppliers obtain a higher average price. Summarizing this strategy, 
natural gas producers adjust their supply throughout the year in response to expectations 
about how the price of natural gas will move in the future.
Summary of Shifts in the Supply Curve and Movements  
Along the Supply Curve
The supply curve shifts when these factors change:
	
1.	 Prices of inputs used to produce the good
	
2.	 Technology used to produce the good
	
3.	 Number and scale of sellers
	
4.	 Sellers’ beliefs about the future
The only reason for a movement along the supply curve:
A change in the price of the good itself
Competitive markets converge  
to the price at which quantity 
­supplied and quantity demanded  
are the same.
Supply and Demand in Equilibrium
Up to this point, we have provided tools that explain the separate behavior of buyers and 
­sellers. We haven’t explained how to put the two sides of the market together. How do buyers 
and sellers interact? What determines the market price at which they trade? What determines 
the quantity of goods bought by buyers and sold by sellers? We 
will use the market demand curve and the market supply curve to 
answer these questions. We’ll continue to study a perfectly com-
petitive market, which we’ll refer to from now on as a “competitive 
market.”
Competitive markets converge to the price at which quantity 
supplied and quantity ­demanded are the same. To visualize what 
it means to equate quantity supplied and quantity demanded, we 
need to plot the demand curve and supply curve on the same fig-
ure. Exhibit 4.10 does this.

Exhibit 4.11 Excess 
Supply
When the market price 
is above the competitive 
equilibrium level, quantity 
demanded is less than 
quantity supplied. This is 
a case of excess supply. 
In this particular example, 
the excess supply is  
38 − 29 = 9 billion 
­barrels of oil per year.
In Exhibit 4.10, the demand curve (in blue) and the supply curve (in red) for the oil 
market cross at a price of $100 per barrel and a quantity of 35 billion barrels. Because the 
demand curve slopes down and the supply curve slopes up, the two curves have only one 
crossing point. Economists refer to this crossing point as the competitive equilibrium. 
The price at the crossing point is referred to as the competitive equilibrium price, which 
is the price at which quantity supplied and quantity demanded are the same. This is some-
times referred to as the market clearing price, because at this price there is a buyer for every 
unit that is supplied in the market. The quantity at the crossing point is referred to as the 
competitive equilibrium quantity. This is the quantity that corresponds to the competitive 
equilibrium price.
At the competitive equilibrium price, the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity 
supplied. At any other price, the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied will be un-
equal. To see this, draw a horizontal line at any other price. Only the horizontal line at the 
competitive equilibrium price equates quantity demanded and quantity supplied.
Exhibit 4.11 illustrates a case in which the market is not in competitive equilibrium 
­because the market price is above the competitive equilibrium price. The higher price 
makes selling more desirable and buying less desirable, raising the quantity supplied above 
its competitive equilibrium level and lowering the quantity demanded below its com-
petitive equilibrium level. When the market price is above the competitive equilibrium 
price, quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, creating excess supply. For example, 
­Exhibit 4.11 shows that at a market price of $140 per barrel for oil, the quantity supplied 
of 38 billion barrels of oil per year exceeds the quantity demanded of 29 billion barrels of 
oil per year.
If the market stayed in this situation, sellers would pump 38 billion barrels of oil per 
year, but buyers would purchase only 29 billion of those barrels, leaving the difference— 
9 billion barrels—unsold each year. This would push down oil prices, as enormous stockpiles 
of oil started to build up around the world. Because existing oil storage tanks are limited in 
scale and expensive to build, sellers would start undercutting each other’s prices to get rid of 
the rising inventory of unsold oil. Prices would fall. As a result, the situation in Exhibit 4.11 
normally wouldn’t last for long. Sellers, who are selling nearly identical barrels of oil, would 
compete with one another for customers by cutting prices. This would continue until the 
market price fell back to the competitive equilibrium price. This competitive process plays 
an important role in pushing the market toward the aptly named competitive equilibrium.
Exhibit 4.12 illustrates the opposite case. When market price is below the competitive 
equilibrium price, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, creating excess demand. 
In Exhibit 4.12 the quantity demanded of 44 billion barrels of oil per year exceeds the 
quantity supplied of 30 billion barrels of oil per year. Buyers want 44 billion barrels of oil, 
but there are only 30 billion barrels available on the market.
When the market price is below 
the competitive equilibrium price, 
quantity demanded exceeds 
quantity supplied, creating excess 
demand.  
When the market price is above 
the competitive equilibrium price, 
quantity supplied exceeds quantity 
demanded, creating excess supply.  
The competitive equilibrium is the 
crossing point of the supply curve 
and the demand curve.
The competitive equilibrium price 
equates quantity supplied and 
quantity demanded.
The competitive equilibrium 
quantity is the quantity that 
corresponds to the competitive 
equilibrium price.

The situation in Exhibit 4.12 also normally won’t last long. Buyers who aren’t getting 
the goods they want will compete with one another by offering to pay higher prices to get 
the limited quantity of oil. This will continue until the market price rises to the competitive 
equilibrium price of $100 per barrel.
Curve Shifting in Competitive Equilibrium
We are now ready to put this framework into action. We’d like to know how a shock to the 
world oil market will affect the equilibrium quantity and the equilibrium price of oil.
For example, what would happen if a major oil exporter suddenly stopped production, as 
Libya did in 2011? This causes a left shift of the supply curve, as illustrated in Exhibit 4.13. 
Since oil has become more scarce, the price of oil needs to rise from its old level to equate 
quantity supplied and quantity demanded. The rise in the equilibrium oil price is associated 
with a movement along the demand curve (which hasn’t shifted). Because the demand curve 
is downward-sloping, a rising price causes a reduction in the quantity demanded. In fact, the 
outbreak of full-scale fighting in Libya and the consequent shutdown of the Libyan oil fields 
did correspond with an increase in the world price of oil.

Chapter 4  |  Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium
We can also predict the effect of a shift in the demand curve. For example, what would 
happen if rising environmental concerns led consumers to cut back their carbon footprint 
by using less oil? This change in consumer tastes shifts left the demand curve for oil, 
which is plotted in Exhibit 4.14. Oil demand has decreased, so the price of oil needs to fall 
from its old level to equate quantity supplied and quantity demanded. The decrease in the 
equilibrium oil price is associated with a movement along the supply curve (which hasn’t 
shifted). Because the supply curve is upward-sloping, a falling price causes a reduction in 
the quantity supplied.
Using demand and supply curves to study markets enables economists to resolve 
­puzzles. For example, in Exhibit 4.14, the market price of oil drops and people buy less oil! 
Hearing those two facts might sound perplexing. Shouldn’t a drop in the price of oil lead 
to an increase in oil buying? In Exhibit 4.14, you can see that the drop in the price of oil 
is caused by a shift of the market demand curve to the left. This left shift causes the price 
to fall and the fall in price causes the quantity supplied to fall. So the fall in price and the 
fall in the equilibrium quantity are both consequences of the left shift in the demand curve.
So far we have studied examples in which only one curve—either the demand or supply 
curve—shifts at a time. But life isn’t always this simple. Sometimes both curves shift at 
the same time. For example, a revolution in Libya might shift the supply curve for oil to 
the left at the same time that rising environmental consciousness shifts the demand curve 
for oil to the left.
We would also like to know what happens in mixed cases. Exhibit 4.15 shows how si-
multaneous shifts in the supply and the demand curves translate into changes in the market 
price and the quantity of transactions. As you can imagine, there are many possible combi-
nations of shifts. These figures and their captions take you through one group of cases. The 
problems at the end of the chapter take you through other cases.
In all three panels of Exhibit 4.15 the demand curve shifts left and the supply curve 
shifts left. The three panels graph three different special cases. We represent the old de-
mand curve in light blue and the new demand curve in dark blue. Likewise, the old sup-
ply curve is light red and the new supply curve is dark red. The grey dot marks the old

The black dot marks the new competitive equilibrium, where the new demand curve and

competitive equilibrium price is P2. The old competitive equilibrium quantity is Q1 and the 
new competitive equilibrium quantity is Q2.
In all three panels, the equilibrium quantity falls: Q2 is less than Q1. However, the equi-
librium price responds differently depending on the relative size of the shifts in the demand 
and supply curves. In the first panel, the left shift in demand dominates and the equilibrium 
price falls from P1 to P2. In the second panel, the equilibrium price stays exactly the same: 
P1 = P2. In the third panel, the left shift in supply dominates and the equilibrium price 
rises from P1 to P2. Summing up, when both supply and demand shift left, the competitive 
equilibrium quantity will always decrease, but the competitive equilibrium price may move 
in either direction or stay the same.
Our analysis has concluded that competitive markets will end up at the competitive 
­equilibrium—the point where the supply and the demand curves cross. But this can happen 
only if prices are allowed to respond to market pressures.
However, some markets have prices that are set by laws, regulations, or social norms. 
Economists are interested in the way that all markets work, even markets that are not 
­allowed to reach a competitive equilibrium. We illustrate these issues by considering mar-
kets without a flexible price.
Take another look at Exhibit 4.12. When the market price of gasoline is artificially held 
below the level of the competitive equilibrium price, the quantity of gasoline demanded 
exceeds the quantity supplied. Accordingly, many drivers who would like to buy gas at the 
market price won’t be able to do so.
In a situation like this, the allocation of gasoline is determined by something other than 
who is willing to pay for it. During the U.S. oil crisis of 1973–1974, the U.S. government

This photograph was taken in 
1974. Why don’t we see signs 
like this today?
At the end of 1973, the U.S. government effectively capped the price of gasoline, creating 
a situation of excess demand.
effectively capped the price of gasoline, causing quantity demanded to exceed quantity 
supplied. This is referred to as a price ceiling. Drivers soon realized that there was excess 
demand at the capped price, leading them to show up early to get whatever gas was avail-
able. Lines began to form earlier and earlier in the day.
A New York Times reporter wrote, “Everywhere lines seemed to be the order of the day. In 
Montclair, ­N.J., Mrs. Catherine Lee got up at 4:20 one morning and drove to her filling station 
to be first on line. She had to settle for second place—No. 1 had gotten there at 3:15. Mrs. Lee 
fluffed up the pillow she had brought, threw two comforters over herself, and slept for three 
hours until the station opened.” Some drivers devised ingenious means of getting around the 
system. “In Bedford, Massachusetts, a businessman drove his auto into a Hertz car rental lot, 
ordered a car, received it complete with a full tank of gas, siphoned the gas into his own car, 
paid Hertz their daily rental fee—no mileage charge, of course—and drove home in his car to 
enjoy his full tank of gas.”1
The lines were an optimal response by buyers who understood that there was excess 
­demand. Because quantity demanded exceeded quantity supplied, gas stations frequently 
ran out of gas. During the peak of the crisis, 20 percent of stations ran out of fuel. Getting 
in line early—very early—was an optimal way of assuring that you’d be able to fill your 
own tank.
Some folks didn’t like waiting in long lines, particularly when they suspected that the 
station was going to run out of fuel before they got their turn at the pump. “They’re out of 
their minds, they’re turning sick. They’ll kill you. They’re fighting amongst themselves. 
They’ll shoot you with a gun. They’re all sick.” Does this sound like a scene from World 
War Z? It’s actually a gas station attendant describing his customers during the gasoline 
crisis of 1973–1974. An owner of another station put it this way: “It was mayhem. They 
were fighting in the streets and one customer pulled a knife on another one. And that was 
before we opened.”
Economic history is filled with stories of governments that try to fix the price of goods 
instead of letting the market generate an equilibrium price. Price controls often do not work 
out well and governments keep forgetting this lesson.
The following Choice & Consequence feature details one more example of a failed ef-
fort to fix a price. As you read it, ask yourself how the goods in question could have been 
­allocated differently.

The Unintended Consequences of Fixing Market Prices
What would happen if your town announced a first-come, 
first-served sale of 1,000 Apple laptops for $50 each? 
Would the residents form an orderly line and patiently wait 
their turn?
In Henrico County, Virginia such a laptop sale was ac-
tually conducted. County residents began lining up at 
1:30 a.m. on the day of the sale. When the gates opened 
at 7 a.m., more than 5,000 people surged into the sale site, 
pushing and shoving their way to get to the ­computers. 
Elderly people were trampled underneath the human 
tidal wave, and a baby’s stroller was crushed. ­Eventually, 
about 70 police officers were called in to restore order. 
Seventeen people were injured and four landed up 
in the hospital. And after the uproar died down, over  
4,000 people were left with nothing to show for all the 
trouble. Of those that did manage to obtain one of the 
computers, many later sold them.2
The Henrico County computer sale resulted in a situ-
ation of excess demand. At the fixed price set by the 
county, $50 per laptop, the quantity demanded of 5,000 
exceeded the quantity supplied of 1,000. ­Exhibit 4.16 
­illustrates the fact that there were not enough ­laptops 
to go around. The people who got laptops were not 
necessarily the ones who were willing to pay the most. 
Instead, the consumers who got the laptops were 
the ones who were able and willing to fight their way 
through the crowd. Even if we assume that the laptops 
were subsequently resold to other people who valued 
the laptops more, the stampede itself caused many in-
juries. A stampede is a bad way to allocate society’s 
resources.
Economists are often asked to provide advice on how 
to design markets that will work well. Naturally, a flex-
ible price would have made this market work ­better 
and it would have raised far more revenue for Henrico 
County.
Alternatively, the market could have been organized as 
an auction with bids received by phone or e-mail. The 
county could have auctioned off the 1,000 laptops to the 
1,000 highest local bidders.
Even a random lottery would have worked much 
better than the stampede. The stampede allocated 
the laptops to the people who were the strongest and 
the pushiest and led to numerous injuries. A random 
lottery would allocate the laptops to the people who 
get lucky. And these lucky winners would be free to 
sell their laptop to anyone who valued it more than 
they did.
Exhibit 4.16 Excess Demand for Henrico County’s Laptops
By fixing the price at $50 per laptop, Henrico County created a situation of excess demand. At this price, the 
quantity demanded (5,000 laptops) exceeded the quantity supplied (1,000 laptops). To equate the quantity 
demanded and the quantity supplied, a much higher price was needed: the competitive equilibrium price. 
The vertical supply curve reflects the fact that the supply of laptops at the $50 sale was fixed at 1,000 units.

Chapter 4  |  Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium
  A market is a group of economic agents who are trading a good or service, 
and the rules and arrangements for trading. In a perfectly competitive market,  
(1) sellers all sell an identical good or service, and (2) individual buyers or 
­individual sellers aren’t powerful enough on their own to affect the market price 
of that good or service.
Quantity demanded is the amount of a good that buyers are willing to 
purchase at a given price. A demand schedule is a table that reports the quantity 
demanded at different prices, holding all else equal. A demand curve plots the 
demand schedule. The Law of Demand states that in almost all cases, the quantity 
demanded rises when the price falls (holding all else equal).
The market demand curve is the sum of the individual demand curves of all 
the potential buyers. It plots the relationship between the total quantity demanded 
and the market price, holding all else equal.
The demand curve shifts only when the quantity demanded changes at a 
given price. If a good’s own price changes and its demand curve hasn’t shifted, 
the own price change produces a movement along the demand curve.
Quantity supplied is the amount of a good or service that sellers are willing 
to sell at a given price. A supply schedule is a table that reports the quantity 
supplied at different prices, holding all else equal. A supply curve plots the 
supply schedule. The Law of Supply states that in almost all cases, the quantity 
supplied rises when the price rises (holding all else equal).
The market supply curve is the sum of the individual supply curves of all the 
potential sellers. It plots the relationship between the total quantity supplied and 
the market price, holding all else equal.
The supply curve shifts only when the quantity supplied changes at a given 
price. If a good’s own price changes and its supply curve hasn’t shifted, the own 
price change produces a movement along the supply curve.
The competitive equilibrium is the crossing point of the supply curve and 
the demand curve. The competitive equilibrium price equates quantity supplied 
and quantity demanded. The competitive equilibrium quantity is the quantity that 
corresponds to the competitive equilibrium price.
When prices are not free to fluctuate, markets fail to equate quantity 
demanded and quantity supplied.

Consumers  
and Incentives
 5
At first thought, you might believe that convincing people to quit smoking ­really 
has nothing to do with economics. In fact, you might think that smoking isn’t 
even an economic decision. This chapter shows you how economics touches 
every aspect of our lives by focusing on incentives—rewards or penalties that 
motivate a person to behave in a particular way. For instance, you may want 
to earn an “A” in this course to make your parents proud. Or, maybe you want 
to do well in this course because you think it will help you gain admission to 
a premier graduate ­program or land a high-paying job upon graduation. Or 
maybe you want to succeed just to prove to yourself that you can do it.
Incentives are as numerous as the behaviors they’re ­designed to change. 
Some are financial in nature, as when a salesperson earns a commission on 
a sale. Others are moral or ethical in nature, like that impulse to make 
your parents proud. Others are coercive; if you don’t use your hockey 
stick properly in a game of ice hockey—say you trip your opponent 
with it—you’ll find yourself sitting in the penalty box.
In many ways, you can think of economics as the study of 
incentives. One of the main tasks of an economist is recognizing 
these various motives and taking them into account when design-
ing incentive schemes. Economists have been designing incentive 
schemes for decades—whether to get people back to work after a 
spell of unemployment, to promote safe sex, or to stimulate charitable contributions—nothing is 
off-limits to an economist.
So, does a financial incentive like paying people to stop smoking work? We’ll find out the 
answer to that question in this chapter. This chapter also explains why human behavior is often 
so predictable. In short, the chapter provides you with the economic tools to design incentive 
schemes to promote your own goals, as well as better understand the world we live in.

Section 5.1  |  The Buyer’s Problem
125
The first question that we explore is “How do consumers decide what to buy?” We can 
frame this question as a problem—the buyer’s problem. You might be thinking, “Hey, why 
is it a problem to spend money? It’s not that hard!”
Economists would agree with you. By “buyer’s problem” we mean how consumers 
­arrive at a choice as to what to purchase. There are, in fact, three necessary ingredients to 
the buyer’s problem:
	
1.	 What you like
	
2.	 Prices of goods and services
	
3.	 How much money you have to spend
Together, these elements provide the foundations for the demand curves introduced in 
Chapter 4. In the next chapter, we see the other side of the coin, so to speak—the elements 
that make up the “seller’s problem,” which provide the foundation for the supply curves 
introduced in Chapter 4.
First, as a buyer, you want to buy goods and services that you like, because you prefer to 
buy what tastes good, sounds good, or looks good. You must also consider prices of the vari-
ous goods and services that interest you. Prices are important because that extra dollar spent 
on an iPhone means one less dollar spent on a latte at Starbucks. Alongside prices is a third 
consideration: how much money you have to spend. We wish our 
wallets were bottomless, but all of us have limited money to spend, 
and your budget constraint forces you to make important trade-offs.
Under certain assumptions, simply knowing these three 
­ingredients—what you like, prices, and how much money you have 
to spend—leads to a set of powerful implications and rules that gov-
ern the buyer’s problem. What emerges from this straightforward 
economic model are answers to simple questions, such as whether to 
buy a new pair of shoes at Zappos.com or to spend your money on a 
skateboard. We now look in more detail at these three key ingredients.
What You Like
The benefits that you receive from consuming goods and services is a direct result of your 
tastes and preferences. If you like the taste of Diet Coke, for example, you will receive ben-
efits from drinking a can. The only assumption that economists make in formulating this 
The Buyer’s Problem
5.1
KEY IDEAS
The buyer’s problem has three parts; what you like, prices, and 
your budget.
An individual’s demand curve reflects an ability and willingness to pay 
for a good or service.
Consumer surplus is the difference between what a buyer is willing to 
pay for a good and what the buyer actually pays.
An optimizing buyer makes decisions at the margin.
Elasticity measures a variable’s responsiveness to changes in another 
variable.
Simply knowing these three 
­ingredients—what you like, prices, 
and how much money you have to 
spend—leads to a set of powerful 
implications.

Chapter 5  |  Consumers and Incentives
5.1
part of the buyer’s problem is that the consumer attempts to maximize the benefits from 
consumption. This makes sense. When you buy something, you want to buy what you think 
will give you the most satisfaction.
As part of the buying decision, consumers must figure out how to make the most of 
every dollar and, in the process, must consider the trade-offs that they face. For example, 
the dollar used to help buy a Wii could have helped buy a Kindle or a new laptop instead. 
These are the opportunities that you forgo when purchasing a Wii.
What do our buying decisions signal about us as consumers? Consider a common situ-
ation. Suppose that you decide to take your birthday money to the mall. If you purchase a 
pair of Lucky jeans for $50, we know that you like Lucky jeans, but what else do we know? 
In fact, we know that you wouldn’t trade your new pair of jeans for a $50 pair of shoes at 
the mall. Indeed, we know that of all the things that you could have purchased for $50, at 
the moment you bought the jeans you thought nothing in the mall was better to purchase.
Your own tastes and preferences might not seem obvious to you. They might depend 
on your current mood or change as you grow older. Your buying decisions, however, will 
reveal a great deal about your tastes and preferences. They will show that from the set of 
all the things that you are able to buy, you most prefer the things that you choose to buy.
Prices of Goods and Services
Prices are the most important incentives that economists study. Prices allow us to formally 
define the relative cost of goods. Say that a pair of jeans has a price of $50 and a sweater 
has a price of $25. What these prices imply is that the opportunity cost of buying a pair of 
jeans is two sweaters. So if you purchase a pair of jeans, we know that you like those jeans 
more than you like two sweaters. In this chapter, we assume that each good has a price that 
is fixed—a non-negotiable sticker price—and that consumers can buy as much of any good 
they want at the fixed price if they have sufficient money to pay for it. In this way, our con-
sumer is a price-taker. As we discussed in Chapter 4, this is an assumption typically made 
to describe perfectly competitive markets.
The rationale behind this assumption is that an individual consumer tends to buy only 
a tiny fraction of the total amount of a produced good. Because each buyer is only a 
small part of the market, an individual purchase will not have an effect on the market as 
a whole. For example, when you go to the mall you might purchase only one of millions 
of pairs of jeans sold annually, so your decision to buy does not meaningfully affect the 
price of jeans.
When considering prices, you must take account of not only the price of the good you 
wish to purchase but the prices of all other goods that are available. The relative prices of 
goods determine what you give up when you purchase something, so they are important 
when making the purchase decision.
You are planning on purchasing a flat-screen television 
for your dorm room. After doing some research you find 
that the local Walmart is selling your preferred brand for 
$500. The Best Buy located across town is selling the 
­exact same television for $490. Do you drive across town 
to buy it?
You figure $10 is just not enough of a savings from 
$500, so you choose to buy from the local Walmart.
Now consider another purchase decision: buying a cal-
culator. In this case, Walmart has your preferred calculator 
for $20. The BestBuy located across town is selling the 
exact same calculator for $10. Do you drive across town 
to buy it? Makes sense to drive across town, right? You 
are saving 50 percent!
You have just committed a common decision-making 
error. When making optimal decisions, you should focus 
on the absolute marginal benefits and marginal costs, 
not the proportional ones. Had you focused on absolute 
­marginal benefits, you would have noticed that these 
decision problems are identical: in each case you would 
have saved $10 by driving across town.
If it pays to drive across town to purchase the calculator, it 
certainly pays to do the same for the flat-screen television.
$10 is $10!

5.1
How Much Money You Have to Spend
The final ingredient of the buyer’s problem is what you can buy. The budget set is the set of 
all possible bundles of goods and services that a consumer can purchase with his income. 
Economists usually describe the budget set in the context of another concept—the budget 
constraint. The budget constraint represents the goods or activities that a consumer can 
choose that exactly exhausts the entire budget. We will make two assumptions about the 
budget constraint. First, we’ll assume that consumers do not save or borrow. We know, of 
course, that many consumers do save and borrow, but for now we want to keep our model 
simple by focusing exclusively on buying decisions. This assumption allows us to focus 
more sharply on how we can use the budget constraint to learn about important economic 
concepts. Second, we plot the budget constraint as a smooth line, even though our ex-
amples will be using whole units. We do this as a matter of convenience, and it does not 
affect the analysis.
Let’s continue with the example of your birthday money. Assume for your 21st birthday 
that your parents and grandparents decide to surprise you with a $300 shopping spree. For 
simplicity, assume that this money is to be spent on only two goods—jeans or sweaters. 
Of course, in reality you could buy any number of other goods, but focusing on two goods 
draws out the most important insights from the economic model. And, once you understand 
the two-good case, it is usually straightforward to extend the analysis to more goods. Re-
member that you have exactly $300 to spend, and the price of jeans is $50 per pair and the 
price of each sweater is $25. Exhibit 5.1 provides the budget constraint and budget set for 
your shopping spree problem.
A first aspect of Exhibit 5.1 that might be confusing is the axis labels. Note that the 
quantity of pairs of jeans and sweaters are plotted on the x- and y-axes, respectively.  
In Chapter 4, we focused on demand and supply curves, which have quantity and price on 
the x- and y-axes. When plotting the budget constraint, however, the quantity of each good 
is on the x- and y-axes. That means the intercepts of the budget constraint represent the 
maximum quantity of each good that can be purchased if you buy only that good. So, the 
intercept values are the total dollars available divided by the price of the good measured 
on that axis. For example, the x-intercept is calculated as $300 divided by $50, or 6 pairs 
of jeans.
A second feature of Exhibit 5.1 is the triangular area. This area represents the budget 
set—all the possible combinations of goods (often called “bundles” in economics) that you 
can purchase. The solid blue line represents the budget constraint—the various quantities 
that you can purchase using all of your birthday money. The budget constraint is a straight 
line because you face a fixed price for jeans and sweaters that does not change with the 
number of goods that you buy. What else is the figure telling us?
A budget set is the set of all 
possible bundles of goods and 
services that can be purchased with 
a consumer’s income.
Exhibit 5.1 The Budget Set 
and the Budget Constraint 
for Your Shopping Spree
With $300 to spend on 
sweaters and jeans, the 
budget set summarizes 
the bundles of sweaters 
and jeans that could be 
purchased. The budget 
constraint shows the bun-
dles that exactly exhaust 
the entire budget. The 
table shows a few possible 
bundles on the budget con-
straint, while the figure plots 
the quantity of jeans on the 
x-axis and the quantity of 
sweaters on the y-axis.

1.	 We can see that the scarcity principle discussed in Chapter 1 is at work: choosing to 
buy more sweaters means buying fewer pairs of jeans, and vice-versa. For example, 
with Bundle B you are buying 2 pairs of jeans and 8 sweaters. Compared to Bundle A  
you have 2 more pairs of jeans but at the expense of 4 sweaters. If you look at the 
table accompanying the graph, you can see the trade-offs between the amounts of 
pairs of jeans and sweaters.
	
2.	 Because your budget constraint is a straight line, its slope is constant. This means 
that your opportunity cost is constant.
We can compute your opportunity cost of buying jeans using a simple formula:
	
Opportunity costjeans = Loss in sweaters
Gain in jeans 	
where the loss in sweaters measures the number of sweaters that you must give up for one 
additional pair of jeans. Remember that the price of jeans is double that of sweaters, so 
opportunity costjeans = 2 sweaters—this represents the opportunity cost of buying one pair 
of jeans. Another way to compute the opportunity cost of buying jeans is to consider the 
budget constraint. Because in this case it is a straight line, you can divide the y-intercept 
(12) by the x-intercept (6) to compute your opportunity cost of buying jeans.
A similar formula provides the opportunity cost of buying sweaters:
	
Opportunity costsweaters = Loss in jeans
Gain in sweaters.	
Opportunity costsweaters= ½ pair of jeans. This simply means that for every 2 sweaters that 
you decide to purchase you have to give up 1 pair of jeans. This follows from the fact that 
the price of jeans is twice the price of sweaters ($50 versus $25). Again, you can also com-
pute this opportunity cost from the x- and y-axes of the budget constraint (6 divided by 12 =  
½ pair of jeans).

5.2   Putting It All Together
Now that we have the three ingredients of the buyer’s problem in place, we can begin to 
construct how we use these elements to optimize, or do the best we can given our pref-
erences, prices, and budget. As an example, consider Exhibit 5.2, which lists all of the 
ingredients to solve the shopping-spree problem. In Exhibit 5.2 we have assumed that 
you have certain preferences, as indicated by the marginal benefits derived from each of 
various quantity levels. Note that in the benefits columns, we do not specify what units of 

5.3

5.2
measurement we are working with—for example, dollars or some other measure of value. 
But it is helpful to use similar units when comparing benefits and costs. For illustrative 
purposes, therefore, let’s assume that the benefits are measured in dollars, because working 
with common units enables us to combine, and therefore compare, costs and benefits using 
operations like addition and subtraction.
So, how should you spend your $300? The problem calls for 
an approach based on marginal thinking. Using such an approach, 
you purchase the available good that yields the highest marginal 
benefits per dollar spent. As such, you should ask yourself: on 
which good should my first dollars be spent? Let’s see how this 
approach works:
(1) The first sweater yields $100 in marginal benefits, whereas the first pair of jeans 
yields $160 in marginal benefits. Even though the first sweater has a lower marginal benefit 
than jeans, its price is half that of jeans, so you find that buying the sweater still yields the 
highest marginal benefits per dollar spent (the sweater yields 4 ($100/$25) in benefits per 
dollar spent, whereas the jeans yield 3.2 ($160/$50)). So you should purchase the sweater.
(2) Still thinking at the margin, you realize that your next choice should be to buy 
­another sweater: buying the first pair of jeans yields $160 in marginal benefits, whereas 
buying another sweater yields $85 in marginal benefits. The marginal benefits per dollar 
spent favor buying the sweater.
(3) If you continue to reason in this way, you will find the quantities at which you opti-
mize your total benefits—buying 6 sweaters and 3 pairs of jeans, exactly exhausting your 
budget of $300 and yielding $845 in total benefits. This optimal choice, which is bolded in 
Exhibit 5.2, maximizes your total benefits because there is no other spending pattern that 
yields a greater level of total benefits.
This solution highlights two important features of the buying problem. First, you should 
make your purchase decisions based on marginal benefits per dollar spent. Second, in 
­doing so an important conclusion results: when optimizing, the marginal benefit that you 
gained from the last dollar spent on each good is equal.
This decision rule can be summarized via a simple equation:
	
MBs
Ps
=
MBj
Pj
,	
where MBs is the marginal benefit from sweaters, MBj is the marginal benefit from jeans, 
and Ps and Pj are the respective prices of sweaters and jeans.
Economists sometimes call this the “equal bang for your buck” rule. In our shopping-
spree example, you received $50 of marginal benefits from buying the sixth sweater and 
$100 of marginal benefits from buying the third pair of jeans. Therefore, we have:
	
$50
$25 = $100
$50 .	
Why does this rule hold? Because if marginal benefits are not equal, then you can do 
better—be happier—by shifting consumption toward the good that has higher marginal 
benefits per dollar spent.
This rule can easily be extended to the case with a large number of goods. It teaches us 
that in equilibrium, the ratio of marginal benefits to price must be identical across goods. 
If this is not the case, then you can purchase a different basket of goods and be better off. 
You will notice that this rule of making decisions at the margin follows directly from the 
cost-benefit principle discussed in Chapter 1.
At this point, you might be thinking that while the example of sweaters and jeans works, 
the world might not always fit so neatly together algebraically. For example, there are some 
goods that are indivisible and have a high price—large-ticket items such as big-screen tele-
visions, automobiles, houses, and yachts—which typically are consumed only infrequently.
This point is valid and very thoughtful. In these instances, buying the first house 
might provide higher marginal benefits per dollar spent than you gain from consuming 
other goods, but buying the second house yields fewer marginal benefits per dollar spent  
An optimizing buyer makes decisions 
at the margin.

5.1
than other goods. In cases where goods are not easily divisible and our decision rule 
cannot be met exactly, the general intuition still holds: you should always spend each 
additional dollar on the good for which your marginal benefits per dollar spent are the 
largest.
What factors might change how many jeans and sweaters you purchase in equilibrium? 
There are two important ones that we now consider: changes in price and changes in income.
Price Changes
Consider what happens to our buyer’s problem if the price of sweaters doubles to $50. 
Jeans and sweaters now have the same price. What must happen to the budget constraint 
with this change in price? Exhibit 5.3 gives us the answer. If you now buy all sweaters on 
your shopping spree, you can only buy 6 sweaters, so the y-intercept must change to 6. 
Does the x-intercept change? No, because the price of jeans has not changed.
What Exhibit 5.3 shows is that when the price of one good relative to the other good 
changes, the slope of the budget constraint must also change. Now if you buy an additional 
sweater you can purchase 1 less pair of jeans, so the opportunity costsweaters = 1 pair of 
jeans. This stands to reason because the prices are now equal.
A decrease in the price of either good will cause the budget constraint to pivot outwards. 
For example, let’s return to our original set of prices, but now assume that the price of jeans 
is cut in half—to $25 per pair. In this case, the budget constraint pivots outward and the  
x-intercept moves to 12. Exhibit 5.4 shows how the budget constraint pivots with a decrease 
Exhibit 5.3 An Inward Pivot in the 
Budget Constraint from a Price 
Increase
Reproducing the figure in Exhibit 5.1  
with an increase in the price of 
sweaters, we see that the budget 
constraint pivots inward. (Note that 
the term “pivot” signifies that one 
of the intercepts does not change.) 
This is because the consumer’s 
­income can buy fewer units of a 
good if the price goes up. The 
slope also changes because the 
opportunity cost changes when the 
price of one good changes.

Exhibit 5.4 A Rightward Pivot

A decrease in the price of one 
good causes the budget ­constraint 
to pivot outwards. This is ­because 
the consumer’s income can 
buy more units of a good if the 
price goes down. The slope also 
changes because the ­opportunity 
cost changes when the price 
changes.

in the price of jeans. Again, the prices are identical after this price change, and therefore the 
opportunity costjeans = 1 sweater.
How do price changes affect the buyer’s problem? When a price changes, the opportu-
nity cost changes. This will cause the buyer to change the optimal quantities consumed. 
Below we show how such price changes influence how many jeans and sweaters you 
purchase.
Income Changes
Another important factor that influences how many jeans and sweaters you purchase is 
how much money you have to spend—such cases revolve around changes in an indi-
vidual’s income, or budget. One example is if your shopping-spree gift turned out to be  
$600 ­instead of $300. Exhibit 5.5 shows the new budget constraint and how this change 
in income causes the budget constraint to shift outward. When income is doubled, the  
y-intercept and x-intercept of the budget constraint also must double because you have 
twice as much income. You can now buy more.
But the slope of the budget constraint does not change because the relative prices 
have not changed. Because the relative prices have not changed, the opportunity cost 
remains the same, too: buying 1 additional pair of jeans still precludes the purchase of 
2 sweaters.
In the Evidence-Based Economics discussion and the appendix to this chapter we 
present examples of how income changes affect how many jeans and sweaters you 
purchase.
Exhibit 5.5 An Outward 
Shift in the Budget 
Constraint from an 
Increase in Income
An increase in income 
shifts the budget con-
straint outward. To see 
this, consider what hap-
pens to the number of 
jeans and sweaters you 
can buy if your budget 
­increases—the quanti-
ties go up. Furthermore, 
the slope will not change 
because the opportunity 
cost of purchasing either 
sweaters or jeans does not 
change with an increase in 
income.

5.3   From the Buyer’s Problem  
to the Demand Curve
With an understanding of how to spend optimally, we can begin to construct demand 
curves. Recall from Chapter 4 that willingness to pay is the highest price that a buyer is 
willing to pay for a unit of a good. Hence, if your willingness to pay for 1 gallon of orange 
juice is $10.00, it means that’s the highest price that you are willing to pay for it.

Exhibit 5.6 Your Demand Curve 
for Jeans
The demand curve shows how 
the quantity demanded depends 
on the price of the good. The 
table summarizes the quantity 
demanded of pairs of jeans at 
different prices. The figure plots 
those numbers with quantity 
demanded on the x-axis and 
price on the y-axis.

An individual’s willingness to pay measured over different quantities of the same good 
makes up the individual’s demand curve. As we learned in Chapter 4, the demand curve isolates 
the contribution that a good’s own price makes toward determining the quantity demanded in 
a given time period, keeping everything else the same. We also saw in Chapter 4 that quantity 
demanded refers to the amount of a good that buyers are willing to purchase at a particular price.  
A demand curve maps how quantity demanded responds to price changes, holding all else 
equal. We all have demand curves for many goods—from dinner dates to movies to oranges 
to cars to the Twilight series.
Let’s look at a demand curve by continuing with the shopping-spree example. Once 
the three components of the buyer’s problem are understood, we can derive your demand 
curve. We saw from our marginal analysis above that when the price of jeans is $50, you 
purchase 3 pairs of jeans. Thus, one point on your demand curve for jeans is price = $50, 
quantity demanded = 3. 
What about if the price of jeans rises to $75? Using marginal analysis similar to what 
we used above, from Exhibit 5.2 we can compute that you now purchase 2 pairs of jeans. 
And, when the price of jeans rises to $100, your quantity demanded is 1 pair. Similarly, if 
the price decreases to $25, then your quantity demanded is 4 pairs of jeans. These combi-
nations represent the demand curve and are displayed in Exhibit 5.6.
We produce Exhibit 5.6 by making optimal decisions based on the buyer’s problem. 
Every point on your demand curve represents a unique price and quantity level. Therefore, 
the demand curve provides an indication of how many pairs of jeans you would like to buy 
at each price level. In Exhibit 5.6 we plot the demand curve as smooth, even though you 
would be unable to buy 3.5 pairs of jeans. We do this merely for convenience. As we move 
from the individual to the entire market of buyers, the units of quantity demanded will be 
so large that the demand curve will be smooth.
We can see that your demand curve slopes downward: at a price of $25 your quantity 
­demanded is 4 pairs of jeans, but at a price of $50 per pair your quantity demanded ­decreases 
to 3 pairs. It only makes sense that as price increases, quantity demanded ­decreases be-
cause the opportunity cost of buying a pair of jeans increases. 
What factors other than your tastes and preferences and the price of jeans might affect 
how many pairs you buy? Our earlier examination of the buyer’s problem provides hints. 
The key to the answer involves prices of related goods and the budget set. Changes in the 

5.3

5.1
5.2
	
Section 5.4  |  Consumer Surplus
133
5.4
prices of related goods and the amount of money available both cause the demand curve to 
shift. In addition, as mentioned in Chapter 4, if your expectations of what is going to hap-
pen in the future change, then that also will shift the demand curve.
Consumer surplus is the difference 
between what a buyer is willing to 
pay for a good and what the buyer 
actually pays.
Consumer surplus is the difference 
between the willingness to pay and 
the price paid for the good.

5.4   Consumer Surplus
So far we’ve learned that in an effort to do the best we can, we 
should recognize the incentives that we face and make deci-
sions based on marginal analysis. That is, we should consider the 
marginal benefits and marginal costs in our decision making. In 
markets, the process of optimal decision making by consumers 
­often yields total benefits well above the price that we pay for 
goods. Economists give these market-created benefits a name—
consumer surplus. Consumer surplus is the difference between 
the willingness to pay and the price paid for the good.
To illustrate how to calculate consumer surplus, let’s continue with the shopping-spree 
example and consider the purchase of jeans more closely. Exhibit 5.7 provides the relevant 
points from your demand curve in Exhibit 5.6. Exhibit 5.7 shows that your willingness to 
pay for the first pair of jeans is $100. Because the market price is $50, you have gained  
$50 ($100 − $50) in consumer surplus from purchasing this first pair of jeans. Your will-
ingness to pay for the second pair of jeans is $75; thus you gain $25 in consumer surplus 
from purchasing the second pair of jeans. How much consumer surplus do you gain from 
the third pair of jeans? The answer is zero, because your willingness to pay ($50) is exactly 
equal to the price ($50) that you pay for this pair of jeans.
At this point, you might be wondering why your consumer surplus ($75) is considerably 
lower than the total benefits that you received from buying the three pairs of jeans (from 
Exhibit 5.2, the total benefits from purchasing three pairs of jeans is $410, and you pay 
$150 for the jeans, yielding net benefits of $260). This is because the two measures are 
importantly different: consumer surplus measures the difference between your willingness 
to pay (the height of your demand curve) and what you actually pay for the good. The total 
benefits displayed in Exhibit 5.2 provide how much overall satisfaction you gain from 
consuming the good.
Computing consumer surplus for the market as a whole is calculated similarly. As we 
learned in Chapter 4, we can horizontally sum individual demand curves to obtain a market

demand curve. Assume that upon doing so, we find that the market demand curve for jeans 
is given by Exhibit 5.8.
In Exhibit 5.8, “consumer surplus” represents the total market consumer surplus. Be-
cause the demand curve is linear, the area of the consumer surplus triangle can be com-
puted as the base of the triangle multiplied by the height of the triangle multiplied by ½.
 Consumer surplus = Base of triangle * Height of triangle

= $2.25 billion.
Thus, the consumer surplus that all consumers receive from the jeans market is $2.25 billion. 
We can see from Exhibit 5.8 that this surplus is gained by those customers who actually buy 
jeans—the set of customers who are willing to pay $50 for jeans. These are customers on the 
top left portion of the demand curve.
An Empty Feeling: Loss in Consumer Surplus  
When Price Increases
Policymakers often use consumer surplus to measure the dollar value of consumer gains 
from a specific market and how those gains change with proposed legislation. How might 
it be useful in a practical sense? When working in the White House, one of the authors 
considered various policies to clean up groundwater. One potential solution was that jeans 
manufacturers would have to stop using certain chemical treatments on their fabrics. Say 
that the government concluded that if this policy took ­effect, the treatment chemical pro-
hibition would increase the market price of jeans from $50 to $75. What happens to con-
sumer surplus in the jeans market if everything else stays the same except for this price 
change? Exhibit 5.9 provides the answer.
Exhibit 5.9 shows the new consumer surplus, shaded in light blue. We find that 
market consumer surplus is now equal to 40 million × $50/2 = $1 billion. As a 
consumer, this development gives you an empty feeling, as many price increases 
do, because you have lost consumer surplus. In this situation, the market has lost ­ 
$1.25 ­billion ($2.25 billion − $1 billion) in consumer surplus, which is shaded in orange.

You, personally, have just lost $50 in consumer surplus from jeans market (your sur-
plus is now $25). When determining whether to enact the new prohibition, policy-
makers compare such losses in consumer surplus to the benefits gained in cleaner 
groundwater to make a final policy decision (they also consider changes in producer 
surplus, which we discuss in the next chapter).

plus decreases. This graph visually

Evidence-Based Economics
A
t the beginning of this chapter, we posed a question concerning whether a 
smoker would quit the habit for $100 a month. Within the economics literature, 
an approach that is gaining popularity is to pay people to quit smoking. The 
tools of this chapter can help us begin to think about whether such an incentive can 
work, and why it might work.
In thinking about such a reward, we have learned that the impact of an increase in in-
come leads to changes in the consumer budget constraint and subsequently the demand 
for goods and services. To see these tools in action, we return to the shopping-spree 
example. Exhibit 5.5 shows the mechanics behind the effects of an increase in what we 
have available to spend.
With that foundation laid, we can return to the question of quitting smoking for a month. 
Given our economic framework, the very same principle that was at work in the shopping-
spree problem applies when considering the smoker’s problem. By providing $100 for not 
smoking, we create a trade-off between the current benefits of smoking and the benefits ob-
tained by $100 of increased income. There is also another saving: by not smoking, you save 
the money otherwise spent on cigarettes or cigars (shifting your budget constraint outward 
even more). For simplicity, let’s assume that is another $100 per month. Thus the compari-
son that we need to make is whether, at the margin, $200 of additional monthly income 
provides more benefits than the current benefits you gain from smoking. If they do, then you 
quit smoking. If they do not, then you continue smoking and miss out on the $200 incentive.
Q: Would a smoker quit the habit for $100 per month?

  Evidence-Based Economics (Continued) 
Which would make you quit smoking?
As we discussed in the introduction, incentives come in many different forms—not 
just money. Another complementary approach that is often used to curb smoking is non-
financial incentives. Such an approach includes advertisements highlighting what smok-
ing does to your teeth and gums, warnings prominently placed on packs of cigarettes, 
counseling, social pressure, and banning smoking in public places, forcing smokers to  
go outside.
To explore whether financial and nonfinancial incentives can encourage smokers to quit 
smoking, researchers have designed randomized experiments. The experiments typically 
are carried out as follows. The researcher actively recruits smokers who are voluntary par-
ticipants in a research experiment to help them quit smoking. The researcher then randomly 
assigns these participants to test and control groups. To measure compliance, biochemical 
tests are used to confirm that the participants have not smoked during the experimental 
period. In this way, if you are in the incentive treatment, you receive the financial incentive 
if the biochemical test reveals that you are smoke-free. If you are found to have smoked, 
then no financial incentive is rewarded.
One such study enrolled 179 subjects at Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center in 
a 10-week program to stop smoking. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a control 
group that received only the standard program or to a test group that received incentives in 
addition to the standard program.1 The standard program comprised informational meet-
ings every 2 weeks where 2 weeks’ worth of nicotine patches were distributed to the par-
ticipants. In addition to the informational meetings and nicotine patches, the participants 
in the test group received $20 for each meeting attended, and $100 if they were smoke-free 
30 days after the program was completed.
The main results of the experiment are displayed in Exhibit 5.10. Exhibit 5.10 measures 
the percentage of people in the test and control groups who were smoke-free 30 days af-
ter the program was completed. The results highlight the power of incentives: 16.3 percent 
of the incentivized participants were found to have quit smoking. This rate is nearly four 
times greater than the 4.6 percent quitting rate of the nonincentivized group. This short-
term effect of incentives is supported by several other studies, as discussed in an article 
which surveys this literature.2
Equally as important, however, is whether these people remained smoke-free after the 
incentive program was over. The Philadelphia Veterans Affairs experiment followed up 
with the experimental subjects 6 months after the program, again using biochemical tests. 
What do you think the researchers found?

The results are enlightening. The researchers report that the 16.3 percent quit rate ob-
served among the incentivized group had dropped to 6.5 percent. This was only slightly 
larger than the percentage of quitters in the nonincentivized control group, which re-
mained at 4.6 percent. A clear conclusion is that the financial incentives are quite pow-
erful: when incentives are in place, many people quit smoking because the benefits of 
quitting ($100 per month plus the money saved from not buying cigarettes) exceed the 
benefits of smoking. But when the financial incentives end, people tend to return to their 
old habit of smoking.
Can you think of other behaviors that financial incentives might change? Upon reading 
this chapter, you will likely not be surprised to learn that economists have. For example, as 
we learned in the appendix to Chapter 2, economists have used financial incentives to im-
prove student performance. As those data suggest, receiving a financial reward of $50 per 
month caused high school students to improve their academic performance ­considerably—
their grades and attendance levels improved. In another study, economists have measured 
the effects of paying students to go to the gym. Again, the results confirm the power of 
financial incentives—students in the incentivized group were much more frequently in 
the gym working out than those not receiving financial rewards. With these results in 
hand, several normative questions arise: should the government use taxpayer dollars to 
pay people to quit smoking or to go to the gym or to finish high school? We leave this for 
you to decide.

5.5   Demand Elasticities
Elasticity is the measure of 
sensitivity of one variable to a 
change in another.
Elasticity measures the sensitivity of 
one economic variable to a change 
in another.
The price elasticity of demand 
measures the percentage change in 
quantity demanded of a good due 
to a percentage change in its price.
So far, we’ve learned the nuts and bolts about where the demand curve comes from and 
whether quantity demanded increases or decreases when price changes. But suppose we 
want more precise answers as to exactly how responsive quantity demanded is to a change 
in price. Economic analysis can provide such answers with the concept of ­elasticity. 
­Elasticity measures the sensitivity of one economic variable to a change in another. In 
other words, it tells us how much one variable changes when another changes. More pre-
cisely, an elasticity is the ratio of percentage changes in variables.
By measuring changes in percentage terms, elasticity goes a 
step deeper than a simple recognition of the slope relationship of 
how one variable changes in relation to another. This is an impor-
tant step because it permits not only a recognition of the direction 
of change but also the size of change. Elasticities come in many 
forms, but in this chapter we focus on the most important ones 
associated with demand curves:
	
1.	 The price elasticity of demand
	
2.	 The cross-price elasticity of demand
	
3.	 The income elasticity of demand
The Price Elasticity of Demand
We know from the Law of Demand that when the price of a good increases, the quantity 
demanded generally falls. But what we do not know from this law is by how much quantity 
demanded falls. The price elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in quan-
tity demanded of a good resulting from a percentage change in the good’s price. Formally, 
the price elasticity of demand is calculated as
	
Price elasticity of demand(eD) = Percentage change in quantity demanded
Percentage change in price
.	
To show how to calculate this elasticity, let’s consider your demand schedule for jeans in 
Exhibit 5.6. When the price is $25 per pair you buy 4 pairs, but when the price increases to 
$50 per pair you buy only 3 pairs. This means that when the price increases by 100 percent 
(from $25 to $50), your quantity demanded decreases by 25 percent (from 4 to 3 pairs), 
yielding an elasticity of demand equal to
	
-25%
100% = -0.25.	
Two features of this computation are important. First, because of the Law of Demand, 
the price elasticity of demand will generally be negative. Because this is the case, econo-
mists often drop the minus sign when reporting elasticities (mathematicians denote this 
as an absolute value), so we would state here that our price elasticity of demand is 0.25. 
We follow that convention here. As such, higher price elasticities mean that consumers are 
more responsive to a change in price.
Second, the distinction between whether a good has a price elasticity of demand greater 
than or less than 1 is of great import. Why? Suppose that you are working at your university 
bookstore and the manager wants to increase revenues from mug sales. Currently your store 
sells 20 mugs per week for $5 each, yielding revenues of $100 (20 mugs × $5). To increase 
revenues, your manager’s first instinct might be to raise the price of mugs from $5 to $6.
We know from the Law of Demand that this 20 percent price increase will lower the 
quantity of mugs purchased, but we need to understand the elasticity of demand before we 
can make predictions about how revenues change. Assume that after the price increase, 
your store sells 12 mugs per week, yielding revenues of $72 (12 mugs × $6). Even though 
you raised the price of mugs, your revenues decreased. What is happening here?
The price elasticity of demand provides the answer. In this case, when price increased 
by 20 percent, the percentage change in quantity demanded decreased by 40 percent (8/20). 
5.5

Section 5.5  |  Demand Elasticities
139
This means that the price elasticity of demand is 2 (40 percent/20 percent). When the 
price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, the percentage change in quantity demanded 
is greater than the percentage change in price. This means that any price increase will lead 
to lower revenues.
Alternatively, if the price elasticity of demand had been less than 1, the percent-
age change in quantity demanded would be lower than the percentage change in price.  
Consider the case where the same 20 percent price increase lowers quantity demanded by 
only 10 percent. The price elasticity is now 0.5 (10 percent/20 percent). In this case, mug 
revenues would increase to $108 (18 mugs × $6) if you raised the price from $5 to $6.
Finally, had the price elasticity of demand been exactly equal to 1, a 20 percent price in-
crease lowers quantity demanded by exactly 20 percent. In this situation, any price increase 
would leave revenues unchanged. In sum, the revenues that your store brings in critically 
depend on the price elasticity of demand.
Moving Up and Down the Demand Curve
At this point, you might be wondering if the elasticity varies over the demand curve. Let’s 
consider an example to find out.
Economists have found that many people value preserving ecosystems. Exhibit 5.11 
uses data from a recent exercise that explored how much people are willing to pay to 
preserve cut throat trout in Yellowstone National Park. The demand curve is for Jacob, 
and shows how much he would pay to preserve various quantities of trout (which are 
measured in 100s on the x-axis). Point A on the demand curve informs us that at a price 
of $5, Jacob’s quantity demanded is to preserve 100 trout; point B tells us that at a price 
of $1, Jacob’s quantity demanded is to preserve 500 trout. What is the price elasticity at 
these two points?
First, let’s calculate the price elasticity beginning at the higher price point on the demand 
curve, Point A (P = $5, Q = 100). Say that price drops to $1, effectively moving along the 
demand curve until point B. In this case, price decreases by 80 percent ($4/$5) and quantity 
demanded increases by 400 percent (400/100). Therefore, the price elasticity of demand is 
equal to 5 (400/80 = 5). So Jacob is very responsive to price changes at point A.
Second, let’s calculate the price elasticity of demand beginning at point B (P = $1,  
Q = 500), for a price increase to $5. This moves along the demand curve from point B to 
point A. Now the price elasticity is 0.20 (the percentage change in quantity demanded is  
80 percent, and the percentage change in the good’s price is 400 percent).
This analysis reveals three important insights about elasticities. First, elasticity is a much 
different concept than the slope of the line. Even though the slope is the same over the entire 
demand curve (because demand is linear), the elasticity varies. This is ­because the ratio of 
price to quantity is different along the demand curve. For example, at Point A, the ratio is 
5/100 whereas at Point B it is 1/500. As this ratio grows, demand becomes more elastic. 
This leads to the second insight: elasticities tend to vary over ranges of the demand curve. 
You can see this in Exhibit 5.11. On the upper half of a linear demand curve, the elasticity 
is greater than 1, and on the lower half, the elasticity is less than 1. What this means is that

Curve for Trout Preservation
A linear demand curve for 
trout preservation is plotted, 
highlighting the way that price 
elasticity varies along a linear 
demand curve. The figure 
shows that the lower on the 
demand curve, the more in-
elastic is demand. At point A 
demand is elastic, whereas at 
point B demand is inelastic.

Moving Up and Down the Demand Curve
Arc Elasticities
One thing that you might be puzzled by is the fact that the elasticity is different de-
pending on what you use as the starting and ending points. This is one reason why 
economists use the approach described in the text for small price changes.
Another measure that economists often calculate is arc elasticity. The arc ­elasticity 
achieves a stable elasticity regardless of the starting point by using the average price 
and quantity in the calculation:
 arc eD =
(Q2 - Q1) > [(Q2 + Q1) > 2]
(P2 - P1) > [(P2 + P1) > 2]
The upside of this formula for calculating elasticities is that regardless of where you 
start, the elasticity will be the same if you are examining changes over the same range 
of the demand curve. This is because the arc elasticity is a method of computing 
­elasticities that measures at the mid-point of the range.
To see this fact, let’s return to our example of trout preservation. First, let’s calcu-
late the price elasticity of demand beginning at P = $5, Q = 100, and explore what 
happens when price drops to $1. Plugging the numbers into the formula, we have
 arc eD =
(500 - 100) > [(500 + 100) > 2]
(1 - 5) > [(1 + 5) > 2]
which equals 1. If we begin instead at the point P = $1, Q = 500, and consider a price 
increase to $5, we estimate the arc elasticity as
 arc eD =
(100 - 500) > [(100 + 500) > 2]
(5 - 1) > [(5 + 1) > 2]
.
Again, this equals 1. With this approach, moving from point A to point B provides 
an elasticity identical to moving from point B to point A.
When doing economic analysis we recommend that you compute the arc elas-
ticity because this will provide you with a more accurate description of consumer 
responsiveness.
The arc elasticity is a method of 
calculating elasticities that measures 
at the mid-point of the demand 
range.
5.5
the elasticity from point A to point B is different from the elasticity from point B to point A. 
Finally, in the exact middle of a linear demand curve, the elasticity is equal to 1 at that point.
Elasticity Measures
Because of the importance of the price elasticity of demand, economists have developed a 
terminology to classify goods based on the magnitude of the price elasticity:
• Goods with a price elasticity of demand greater than 1 have elastic demand. When 
the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, the percentage change in quantity 
­demanded is greater than the percentage change in price. Economic research has 
shown that peanut butter and olive oil tend to have elastic demand.
• Theoretically, demand may be perfectly elastic, which means that demand is highly 
responsive to price changes—the smallest increase in price causes consumers to stop 
consuming the good altogether. The blue (horizontal) line in panel (a) of Exhibit 5.12 
is an example of a perfectly elastic demand curve.
• Goods with a price elasticity of demand equal to 1 have unit elastic demand. For 
such goods, a 1 percent price change affects quantity demanded by exactly 1 per-
cent. In this case, a price increase does not affect total expenditures on the good. 
Economists have found that wine has unitary elastic demand. The blue line in panel 
(b) of Exhibit 5.12 is an example of a unit-elastic demand curve, where elasticity is 
measured using the arc elasticity.
Goods that have elastic demand 
have a price elasticity of demand 
greater than 1.
A very small increase in price causes 
consumers to stop using goods that 
have perfectly elastic demand.  
Goods that have unit elastic 
demand have a price elasticity of 
demand equal to 1.

Determinants of the Price Elasticity of Demand
Exhibit 5.13 lists a handful of elasticity estimates that economists have generated with 
consumption and price data over the past several decades. One way to think about these 
numbers is to consider the types of goods that you might purchase when shopping at a 
supermarket. For example, as you walk in you might see a display of olive oil. Economists 
have found that olive oil has an elastic demand: a 1 percent increase in the price of olive oil 
yields a 1.92 percent decrease in quantity demanded of olive oil. This means that consum-
ers are quite sensitive to changes in olive oil prices. You might walk an aisle over and see 
ketchup, which also is an elastic good, with a price elasticity equal to 1.36. At the end of 
the next aisle, you might see potato chips, which are an inelastic good because the price 
elasticity is equal to 0.45. This means that changes in their price cause small changes in 
quantity demanded: a 1 percent increase in the price of potato chips leads to a 0.45 percent 
decrease in the quantity demanded of potato chips.
Exhibit 5.12 Examples of Various Demand Curves
From left to right, three demand curves are plotted to visually summarize a perfectly elas-
tic, a unitary, and a perfectly inelastic demand curve. Although we will mainly deal with sim-
ple linear demand curves, extreme cases like these can be useful to consider for intuition.

Goods that have inelastic demand 
have a price elasticity of demand 
less than 1.
Quantity demanded is unaffected 
by prices of goods with perfectly 
inelastic demand.  
• Goods with a price elasticity of demand less than 1 have inelastic demand. When the 
price elasticity of demand is less than 1, the percentage change in quantity demanded 
is less than the percentage change in price. Research within economics has taught 
us that goods such as cigarettes and potato chips are not very responsive to price 
changes and thus have inelastic demand.
• Demand can also be perfectly inelastic, which means that quantity demanded is 
completely unaffected by price. The blue (vertical) line in panel (c) of Exhibit 5.12  
is an example of perfectly inelastic demand. The phrase “gotta have it” describes 
such goods, which include insulin for diabetics.

Chapter 5  |  Consumers and Incentives
5.1
What do you think makes some goods, such as olive oil and ketchup, elastic, whereas 
others, such as shampoo and potato chips, are inelastic? Economists have pinpointed three 
primary reasons for elasticity differences:
• Closeness of substitutes
• Budget share spent on the good
• Available time to adjust
Let’s look at each of them a little more closely.
(1) Closeness of substitutes. Say there is a strike among local cheese factory ­workers 
and the price of pizza skyrockets. You should ask yourself, “Is there another good, a sub-
stitute good, available that I like nearly as much as pizza?” If the answer is yes, then you 
will be more likely to switch to that good—perhaps hamburgers—rather than continue to 
purchase pizza at the higher price. In this way, the number of available substitutes affects 
how responsive consumers are to price changes: as the number of available ­substitutes 
grows, the price elasticity of demand increases.
(2) Budget share spent on the good. The budget share relates to how important the good 
is in your consumption bundle. People should give more weight to “important” goods and 
less weight to unimportant ones. If the good represents a small fraction of your overall 
purchases—say, a $0.50 key chain that you replace every five years—you likely will not be 
overly concerned if the local factory workers strike and the price of key chains doubles. It is 
just not important to your overall budget and so you are not sensitive to price changes, even 
large ones. Alternatively, if the good represents a large fraction of your budget—say, a house 
or furniture purchase—then you are likely to be more responsive to price changes. In gen-
eral, as you spend more of your budget on a good, the price elasticity of demand increases.
(3) Available time to adjust. Time is an important element in that people are more 
responsive to price changes in the long run than in the short run. When the price of oil 
jumped to $150 per barrel in the summer of 2008 and a gallon of gasoline nationwide was 
$4, would a Hummer owner immediately trade it in for a hybrid? Probably not. Would the 
Hummer owner immediately stop driving and take public transit everywhere? Likely not, 
but she may have skipped that extra trip to the grocery store or passed on an extra visit to 
Grandma’s house to save on gasoline.
As we discussed in Chapter 4, gas prices led some Hummer owners to trade in their  
gas guzzlers.
5.5

5.4
5.1
5.2
	
Section 5.5  |  Demand Elasticities
143
The key is that it is difficult to make major changes in the short run, because you are 
constrained with what can be done over a short period of time. For example, the Hummer 
owner may have wanted to trade in her Hummer for a hybrid, but there may have been 
significant switching costs that prevented a reasonable trade. Her options would have been 
much more flexible in the long run; for example, she could arrange to carpool to work or 
move to an apartment near where she works. Such instances highlight the fact that consum-
ers, in general, respond much less to price changes in the short run than in the long run.
The Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
Economists are interested in much more than merely how a good’s price affects consum-
ers. Another type of elasticity that economists consider is how quantity demanded for one 
good changes when the price of a substitute or complement good changes. This is called 
the cross-price elasticity of demand and is a measurement of the percentage change in 
quantity demanded of a good due to a percentage change in another good’s price. Formally, 
the cross-price elasticity is written as:
Cross@price elasticity = Percentage change in quantity demanded of good x
Percentage change in price of good y
.	
This measure provides the elasticity of demand for good x with respect to the price of good y.
If a cross-price elasticity is negative, then the two goods are complements. As discussed 
in Chapter 4, two goods are complements when the fall in the price of one leads to a right 
shift in the demand curve for another. For example, if the price of iPods falls, you want more 
of them, but also your demand for headphones is likely to increase. The size of the cross-
price elasticity determines the strength of the positive shift in your demand for headphones.
If a cross-price elasticity is positive, then the two goods are substitutes. Two goods are 
substitutes when the rise in the price of one leads to a right shift in the demand curve for 
the other. For example, an iPhone would be a substitute for an iPod—both are music stor-
age devices. Thus, as the price of an iPod increases, instead of spending your money on the 
iPod, you might buy an iPhone instead.
Exhibit 5.14 summarizes a handful of cross-price elasticities that economists have gen-
erated with consumption and price data over the past several decades. A first insight from 
these examples is that goods such as meat and fish, clothing and entertainment, and whole 
and low-fat milk are substitutes for one another. At the other end of the spectrum, meat and 
potatoes and food and entertainment are complements. A second insight from Exhibit 5.14  
is the magnitudes of the cross-price elasticities. For example, when considering whole milk 
and low-fat milk, a cross-price elasticity of 0.5 tells us that a 10 percent increase in the 
price of whole milk leads to a 5 percent increase in demand for low-fat milk. Economists 
have found such estimates useful to predict how changes in one part of the economy will 
influence demand in another. Policymakers use such estimates to gain an understanding of 
how taxation of one good affects the demand for another.
The Income Elasticity of Demand
A third type of elasticity measurement has to do with how changes in income affect con-
sumption patterns. The income elasticity of demand informs us of the percentage change 
Cross-price elasticity of demand

in quantity demanded of a good due to a percentage change in the consumer’s income. The 
income elasticity is calculated as
	
Income elasticity = Percentage change in quantity demanded
Percentage change in income
	
and reveals how a change in income affects the quantity demanded of a good. The sign and 
magnitude of income elasticities are of particular interest to economists. Goods are usually 
classified into two categories:
• Normal goods: A good is normal if the quantity demanded is directly related to 
­income; when income rises, consumers buy more of a normal good.
• Inferior goods: A good is inferior if the quantity demanded is inversely related to 
income; when income rises, consumers buy less of an inferior good.
Exhibit 5.15 summarizes a handful of income elasticity estimates that economists have 
generated. These data show that goods such as foreign vacations, healthcare, and electricity

Businesses are interested in the bottom line—profits. But 
before any profit target can be reached, businesses must 
bring in revenues. Revenues are simply the amount of 
money a business brings in from selling its goods and 
services. For example, a back-of-the-envelope calcula-
tion suggests that in 2011, McDonald’s sold 15.6 billion 
hamburgers at a price of about $2.50 each. Therefore, 
McDonald’s brought in $39 billion dollars of revenues 
through hamburger sales.
How hamburger revenues respond to price and income 
changes is a question of particular interest to ­McDonalds. 
As we discussed in this chapter, the ­secret to determining 
how revenues change when prices change is elasticity.
As we showed, when demand is inelastic, an increase 
in McDonald’s hamburger prices will lead to an increase 
in revenues. On the other hand, when demand is elastic, 
an increase in the price of burgers will cause a decrease 
in revenues. This is the case because when demand is 
inelastic, an increase in price causes a relatively small de-
crease in quantity demanded, so revenues will increase. 
When demand is elastic, an increase in price causes a 
relatively large decrease in quantity demanded—so large 
that revenues actually decrease.
Because of this interesting property, price elasticities 
are important to businesses and policymakers. Studies of 
the elasticity of demand for fast-food restaurants suggest 
an industry elasticity of 0.8.6
So why doesn’t McDonald’s raise the price of its ham-
burgers? (Hint: Think about whether McDonald’s faces 
the industry elasticity. If not, will the elasticity ­McDonald’s 
faces be greater or less than the industry elasticity? 
­Another consideration is how hamburger prices affect 
sales of other products at McDonald’s.)
We have just learned that other elasticities are impor-
tant, too. For example, food and entertainment have a 
negative cross-price elasticity (−0.7), meaning that they 
are complements.
If McDonald’s hamburgers have a similar relationship 
with entertainment, then when the price of entertain-
ment goes up by 10 percent, McDonald’s can expect the 
­demand for its product to decrease by 7 percent—an 
­important insight for pricing and inventory purposes.
Likewise, upon understanding how income changes affect 
demand for its products, McDonald’s can use ­advertising, 
pricing, or other means to maintain a healthy bottom line.
Letting the Data Speak
Should McDonald’s Be Interested in Elasticities?

When income rises and consumers

are normal goods. At the other end of the spectrum, goods such as rice and public transit 
are inferior: the more we earn, the less we consume.
Exhibit 5.15 shows that the magnitude of the income elasticity for normal goods can 
vary significantly. For example, if your income increases by 10 percent, your consump-
tion of electricity increases by only 2.3 percent. The same 10 percent change in income, 
however, leads to a large change in foreign vacations—a 10 percent rise in income is asso-
ciated with a 21 percent increase in foreign vacation expenditures. Goods with an income 
elasticity above 1 are called luxury goods. 
Economists have found income elasticities useful to forecast how income changes will 
affect the overall economy. These numbers are important for policymakers because they 
help to inform how proposed rulemakings concerning income taxes might influence con-
sumption of various goods and services.
As a consumer, you optimize by solving the buyer’s problem, which 
dictates that you make decisions at the margin, recognizing both financial and 
nonfinancial incentives.
Individual demand curves are derived from the three components of the 
buyer’s problem: what we like, prices, and how much money we have to spend.
Consumer surplus measures the difference between an individual’s 
willingness to pay and what the consumer actually pays for a good or service. 
Policymakers often use consumer surplus to measure how proposed legislation 
impacts consumer surplus.
An elasticity measures the sensitivity of one economic variable to a change 
in another. Important elasticity measures include the price elasticity of demand, 
the income elasticity of demand, and the cross-price elasticity of demand. 
Elasticity measurement is especially important for businesses and policymakers 
who want to understand how consumer behavior changes in response to a price or

Combining knowledge of the decision making rules that result from the 
buyer’s problem with an understanding of elasticities, we can more reliably 
understand how we ourselves will respond to incentives, and we are better able to 
create the proper incentives to change behavior of others in a predictable way.

Appendix
Representing Preferences with 
Indifference Curves: Another Use 
of the Budget Constraint
Our goal in this chapter was to learn how consumers make choices. Through the lens of the 
buyer’s problem, we learned about the importance of preferences, prices, and the budget con-
straint. Although we focused mainly on prices and the budget constraint, preferences are also 
very important. Exhibit 5.2 shows the “benefit” of each pair of jeans and each sweater. Where 
those preferences come from is too advanced for an introductory book, but in this appendix 
we touch upon the question of how economists think about preferences and consumer choice.
Returning to the shopping-spree example, recall that you have $300 to spend on sweat-
ers and jeans. Similar to representing the budget constraint, we can show your preferences 
plotted graphically. To do so, economists commonly use a concept called the indifference 
curve. An indifference curve is the set of bundles that provide an equal level of satisfaction 
for the consumer. Economists often call this level of satisfaction utility, which is simply an 
abstract measure of satisfaction.
Exhibit 5A.1 uses the data from Exhibit 5.2 and displays two such indifference curves along-
side your $300 budget constraint. The intuition of an indifference curve is that ­regardless of 
where you are on that curve, you are equally happy, or have the same level of utility. Consider 
the first indifference curve (U = U1). If we choose point A (6 sweaters and 3 pairs of jeans), we 
know that it gives you the same level of satisfaction as point B (4 sweaters and 5 pairs of jeans). 
In fact, from Exhibit 5.2 we know that each bundle gives you $845 in total benefits.
What’s convenient about indifference curves is that they summarize every possible bundle 
of sweaters and jeans for which you are indifferent based on your preferences. When this 
curve is plotted with the budget constraint, all of the elements of the buyer’s problem are sum-
marized. The budget constraint summarizes what you can afford and the indifference curve 
summarizes what you like. The combination of the two shows the point at which you should 
choose—or where you maximize your utility, or satisfaction, subject to your budget constraint.
To see this idea graphically, we focus on the budget constraint and the indifference curve in 
Exhibit 5A.1 where U = U1. Along this indifference curve your utility is constant and along the 
budget constraint is every bundle of sweaters and jeans that you can afford. The point of tangency 
of the two, at point A, is the bundle that you can both afford and maximizes your satisfaction. 
You’ll notice that the tangency of the indifference curve in Exhibit 5A.1 and the budget constraint 
from earlier is at 6 sweaters and 3 jeans, just as we found in our marginal analysis before.
Exhibit 5A.1 Introducing 
Indifference Curves
Plotting the budget line from 
Exhibit 5.1, this graph introduces 
two indifference curves, which 
are derived from the benefit data 
in Exhibit 5.2. Along each curve, 
consumers are indifferent—that is, 
their total benefits are constant. 
Take U = U1; at points A and B 
­total benefits are equal.

An indifference curve is the set of 
bundles that provide an equal level 
of satisfaction for the consumer.
Utility in economics is a measure of 
satisfaction or happiness that comes 
from consuming a good or service.

Appendix  |  Representing Preferences with Indifference Curves: Another Use of the Budget Constraint
Indifference curves can also help us think about how choices change in response to 
changes in prices or income. In Exhibit 5A.1 we plot only two indifference curves, but for 
any given level of utility, there is an indifference curve. As we learned in this chapter, as 
income increases, the budget constraint shifts to the right; likewise, the budget constraint 
pivots in response to a price change. Combining an understanding of indifference curves 
with knowledge of the budget constraint informs us about how consumption changes when 
income or prices change. We avoid discussing the exact mechanics of this here, but just about 
every intermediate microeconomics textbook includes a discussion of these building blocks.
Instead, we will briefly discuss one of the most important conceptual issues associated 
with price changes. Consider if the price of jeans is cut in half: instead of $50 per pair, they are 
now $25 per pair. You might react in one of two ways: this is super news: “I feel ‘wealthier’ 
now so I am going to buy more jeans and sweaters.” Economists call this an income effect, 
because this change in consumption moves you to a higher indifference curve. A second way 
in which you might react is to say: “jeans are now relatively cheap compared to sweaters, so I 
will buy more jeans and fewer sweaters.” Economists call this a substitution effect, because 
this change in consumption moves you along a given indifference curve.
So, what do you think is the end result of these two effects? We know that you will certainly 
buy more jeans—our marginal analysis and demand curve told us that at a price of $25, you will 
purchase 4 pairs of jeans relative to the 3 pairs you were purchasing when the price was $50. 
And by the same marginal analysis, we know you will also buy more sweaters (8 instead of 6). 
However, how we get to this final optimum is a far more subtle point. On the one hand, jeans 
are relatively more affordable, meaning the substitution ­effect should increase your quantity 
demanded of jeans. On the other hand, looking back to ­Exhibit 5.2, we can see that the marginal 
benefit of jeans drops off very quickly after the fourth pair, whereas sweaters stay a consistently 
good deal, meaning the income effect may favor sweaters. It becomes an empirical question.
For our example, we find that with this price change, the number of jeans purchased 
increases to 4, and the number of sweaters increases to 8. Exhibit 5A.2 shows both ef-
fects graphically. Point A is the original optimum from the shopping spree where you buy  
6 sweaters and 3 pairs of jeans. When the price of jeans drops to $25, the budget constraint 
pivots outward. Point C is the new optimum after the price of jeans drops to $25. The price 
drop causes you to buy 4 pairs of jeans and 8 sweaters. How do you get there? Through a 
combination of income and substitution effects.
To graphically visualize the two effects we start at point A and ask: in theory, how many 
sweaters and pairs of jeans would you buy at our original indifference curve (U1 = $845) 
with jeans at this new, lower, price? The answer is found at the tangency of our original  
indifference curve and the dashed budget constraint with the same slope as our new, 
­pivoted-out red budget constraint. This dashed-line curve has a slope of −1 (since the ratio 
of the price of jeans to the price of sweaters is now $25/$25 = 1) and intersects both the 
x- and y-axes at 8.5 units. This tells us that the substitution effect due to cheaper jeans has 
given us the chance to achieve the same utility as before ($845) while spending less money 
An income effect is a consumption 
change that results when a price 
change moves the consumer to a 
lower or higher indifference curve.
A substitution effect is a 
consumption change that results 
when a price change moves the 
consumer along a given indifference 
curve.
Exhibit 5A.2 Income and 
Substitution Effects
A change in price has two effects 
on consumption—an income ef-
fect and a substitution effect. If 
the price of jeans is halved, then 
the budget line pivots outward 
from the original blue line to the 
new red line. Point A is the origi-
nal optimum and point C is the 
new optimum.

($25 × 8.5 = $212.50 < $300), a feat that would be impossible at the former $50 price 
point for jeans. The new tangency occurs at point S* and it tells us that the substitution 
­effect moves your consumption of jeans from 3 to 4 and your consumption of sweaters 
from 6 to 4.5 (for convenience, we assume that you can purchase half units).
But stopping there would mean neglecting the $87.50 “extra” you now have to spend—
the new lower price of jeans has made you relatively wealthier. Moving from point S* to 
point C summarizes the income effect of the new lower price. You can see that the income 
effect has a large impact, moving consumption of sweaters from 4.5 to 8 while keeping 
consumption of jeans unchanged at 4. For jeans, this might seem like a counter intuitive 
­result—having more income left the quantity of jeans that you buy unchanged after the sub-
stitution effect. But let’s not forget our discussion of marginal analysis and income elasticity.
Consider Exhibit 5A.3, which updates the marginal benefits per dollar spent to account 
for the decrease in the price of jeans. Notice that when buying the fifth pair of jeans, the 
marginal benefit per dollar spent is $1.2 ($30/$25), whereas purchasing a fifth sweater has 
a marginal benefit per dollar spent of $2.4 ($60/25). In fact, after the fourth pair of jeans, 
you really have little interest in buying more jeans because the marginal benefit of an extra 
sweater is always higher. What does this suggest about the income elasticity for jeans over 
this range? Importantly, it shows that whether jeans are a normal good depends on how 
many pairs of jeans you already own.

Sellers and 
Incentives

In every market, there are buyers and sellers. Taco Bell sells tacos, Apple sells 
iPods, Old Navy sells casual clothing, and Amazon.com sells Kindles. Service mar-
kets also feature buyers and sellers: you purchase tune-ups from mechanics, guitar 
lessons from music instructors, and haircuts from barbers. In the previous chapter, 
you learned a set of decision rules that led to optimal outcomes for the buyer. 
In this chapter, you’ll learn a set of decision rules that optimize outcomes for the 
seller.
We begin with the seller’s problem, which is nearly identical to the buyer’s 
problem discussed in Chapter 5. In much the same way that consumers choose 
the optimal bundle of goods and services to maximize their net benefits, sellers 
choose what to produce and how much to produce to maximize their net ben-
efits: profits.
Our discussion in this chapter continues to focus on perfectly ­competitive 
markets. We show that like optimizing consumers, optimizing sellers rely on 
­marginal thinking. We will learn that simply knowing market prices and how much 
it costs a firm to produce a good or a ­service leads to a set of decision rules that 
govern the seller’s problem. These insights will help you understand and predict 
how proposed ­public ­policies influence behavior and outcomes of firms. They 
also ­provide general guidance into how you should run your own business inter-
ests should your ­entrepreneurial spirit inspire you to start up an Internet company, 
open a ­Subway sandwich shop, or open an ethanol plant.

Section 6.2   |  The Seller’s Problem
153
We will begin our study of how firms make decisions by assuming that they do so in per-
fectly competitive markets. Three conditions characterize perfectly competitive markets:
• No buyer or seller is big enough to influence the market price.
• Sellers in the market produce identical goods.
• There is free entry and exit in the market.
The first two assumptions are important because they ensure that agents in this type of 
market are price-takers—a term we’ve already met in Chapters 4 and 5. Just as a consumer 
is a price-taker by buying as much as she wants at the market price if she has enough 
money, sellers in perfectly competitive markets are price-takers in that they can sell as 
much as they want at the market price. The rationale behind this assumption is that an 
individual seller tends to sell only a tiny fraction of the total amount of a good produced. 
Because the seller’s output is small relative to that of the market, the individual choice of 
how much to produce isn’t going to be important for market outcomes. But the combined 
effect of many sellers’ decisions will affect the market price.
We can see this through the lens of the decisions of a local farmer. If the farmer decides 
to rotate crops and grow corn this year rather than soybeans, this choice does not cause 
price fluctuations throughout the world. However, if every farmer in the world decided to 
grow corn this year instead of soybeans, the price of corn would decrease dramatically and 
the price of soybeans would increase.
The third assumption—that firms can enter and exit industries as they please—has 
­important consequences for the market as a whole. One example of a market where sellers 
can enter and exit as they please is selling on eBay. At any time you can decide to enter the 
DVD market by auctioning off your DVD collection on eBay. Sellers can pretty much en-

KEY IDEAS
The seller’s problem has three parts: production, costs, and revenues.
An optimizing seller makes decisions at the margin.
The supply curve reflects a willingness to sell a good or service at 
various price levels.
Producer surplus is the difference between the market price and the 
marginal cost curve.
Sellers enter and exit markets based on profit opportunities.
The overarching goal of the seller is to maximize net benefits, or profits. The seller’s prob-
lem therefore revolves around the question: “How do sellers decide what and how much to 
produce?” We can frame this question as a problem—the seller’s problem—just as when

we looked at the buyer’s problem in Chapter 5 and discussed how consumers make buying 
decisions.
Think of your local pizzeria. The owner first buys ingredients, then creates a master-
piece with dough, sauce, and toppings, after which he takes it to the market. In this anal-
ogy, the seller’s problem has three main components. First, the seller must know how the 
inputs combine to make the outputs. For example, how many tomatoes are necessary for 
just the right sauce? Second, the seller must know how much it costs to produce a pizza. 
For instance, how much does the brick oven cost, and what about the electricity cost and 
workers’ wages? And, does it matter that new ingredients need to be purchased each time 
he produces a pizza, while the oven sits ready for use? Finally, the seller must know how 
much he can sell the pizza for once it is produced. So we can say that the three elements of 
the seller’s problem are:
 
1. Making the goods
 
2. The cost of doing business
 
3. The rewards of doing business
We’ll now look at each of these elements in more detail.
Making the Goods: How Inputs Are Turned into Outputs
A firm is a business entity that produces and sells goods or services; it can consist of thou-
sands of people, a few people, or a single person. Every firm faces the decision of how to 
combine inputs to create outputs. Production is the process by which the transformation 
of inputs (such as labor and machines) to outputs (such as goods and services) occurs. The 
relationship between the quantity of inputs used and the quantity of outputs produced is 
called the production function.
To begin to understand the production function, let’s consider a real-life company in 
Sun Prairie, Wisconsin: The Wisconsin Cheeseman. The firm is a mail-order gift company 
that packs and mails food and floral products and ships them all over the world. Let’s focus 
exclusively on one of the services that it provides: packing cheese into cheese boxes. The 
Cheeseman relies on two main inputs, labor to pack the cheese into boxes—a task that one 
of the co-authors of this book spent two teenage summers doing—and physical capital 
(equipment and structures). Physical capital is any good, including machines and buildings 
used for production.
Whereas hiring and firing workers can be done in a short period of time, ­altering 
physical capital takes a much longer period of time. Economists denote the short run as 
a period of time when only some of a firm’s inputs can be ­varied—for The ­Cheeseman, 
labor. Alternatively, the long run is defined as a period of time wherein a firm can 
change any input. This means that physical capital is a fixed factor of production—
an input that cannot change in the short run—and that labor is a variable factor of 
­production—an input that can change in the short run.
Exhibit 6.1 provides information on The Wisconsin Cheeseman’s short-run produc-
tion function. It shows how the output varies with the number of workers employed 
(we’ve changed actual numbers because those are proprietary information). Columns 1 
and 2 show how The Cheeseman’s daily production of cheese boxes varies with the num-
ber of employees it hires. The first worker can complete 100 cheese boxes per day. Two 
workers can pack 207 cheese boxes per day. As such, the marginal product of adding 
the second worker is 107 cheese boxes in a day because this is the amount by which total 
output changes with the addition of the second worker (207 − 100). So we can define 
marginal product as the additional amount of output obtained from adding one more unit 
of input (in this case, workers).
For The Cheeseman, the only way to change production in the short run is to change the 
number of workers. Exhibit 6.2 provides a graphical summary of the relationship between the 
number of workers and the number of cheese boxes packed: the short-run production function. 
Exhibits 6.1 and 6.2 reveal three important characteristics of production for The Cheeseman.
(1) The marginal product increases with the first few workers. This feature suggests that, 
for example, two laborers working together can produce more than the sum of their produc-
tion in isolation. This might happen because the first two workers ­specialize in a particular

can be varied.

when all of a firm’s inputs can be 
varied.

input that cannot be changed in the 
short run.
A variable factor of production is 
an input that can be changed in the 
short run.

Exhibit 6.2 The Short-Run 
Production Function for 
The Cheeseman
Plotted here is the number of 
workers on the x-axis and the 
number of cheese boxes ­produced 
on the y-axis. As the number of 
workers goes up, the number 
of cheese boxes that can be 
produced tends to increase, but 
notice that the first 10–15 workers 
lead to much steeper increases 
in production than the 25th–35th 
additional worker. Also notice that 
the last worker actually reduces 
productivity.

portion of the cheese-packing task that they are good at completing. In specialization, work-
ers develop specific skill sets so as to increase total productivity. To see specialization in 
action, during your next visit to Subway, watch how the first worker prepares the bread and 
places the meats just right. Then watch the second worker prepare the veggies, sprinkle oils, 
and cut the sandwich. After which, the third worker prepares the final product and tallies the 
bill. A true assembly line of beauty, something that specialization has created naturally.
(2) The marginal product eventually decreases with successive additions of workers. 
This characteristic means that as more and more workers are added they begin to add less 
and less to total production. For example, the marginal product of the fourth worker is 
123 boxes, whereas it is only 114 boxes for the fifth worker. Economists call this decreas-
ing production pattern the Law of Diminishing Returns. This law states that at a cer-
tain point of successive increases in inputs, marginal product begins to decrease. This law 
might apply for a number of reasons. For example, with a set amount of physical capital, 
Specialization is the result of 
workers developing a certain 
skill set in order to increase total 
productivity.
The Law of Diminishing Returns 
states that successive increases 
in inputs eventually lead to less 
additional output.

Chapter 6  |  Sellers and Incentives
successive increases in labor eventually lead to lower output per worker because there is 
idle time—workers cannot use the machines as often as they would like.
(3) Adding too many workers can actually decrease overall production. This point refers 
to the fact that adding too many workers can be counterproductive. Indeed, this is exactly 
the situation with the last worker that The Cheeseman hires: Exhibit 6.1 shows that adding 
the thirty-ninth worker has a negative marginal product of 100 boxes! You can see this situ-
ation vividly in Exhibit 6.2, where the production curve begins to slope downward at that 
point. Management should send this worker home, dispatch him to a different task, or even 
have him wash the owner’s dog, because he is lowering production of cheese boxes. This 
might happen because congestion causes workers to get in the way of one another.
The Cost of Doing Business: Introducing Cost Curves
We now look at the second component of the seller’s problem: what the firm must pay for 
its inputs, or the cost of production. Similar to the two factors of production discussed 
above, there is a natural division in the total cost of production:
Total cost = Variable cost + Fixed cost.
This equation has three parts. Total cost is the sum of variable and fixed cost. Variable costs 
are those costs associated with variable factors of production. In The Cheeseman’s case, these 
are costs associated with workers and therefore change with the level of production in the short 
run. In contrast to variable costs, a fixed cost is a cost associated with a fixed factor of produc-
tion, such as structures or equipment, and therefore does not change with production in the 
short run. Indeed, in the short run, The Wisconsin Cheeseman has to pay for these factors even 
if it produces nothing because the firm cannot sell its plant and equipment in the short run.
These costs are summarized in Exhibit 6.3. Column 4 shows variable costs (VC)—­
because workers at The Cheeseman are paid a daily wage of $72 ($9 per hour, 8 hours per 
day), the daily variable costs increase by $72 for each worker hired. We assume that The 
Cheeseman can hire as many workers as it wants at this wage. The cost of structures and 
machinery represents the cost of physical capital, and this is computed by management to be  
The cost of production is what a 
firm must pay for its inputs.
Total cost is the sum of variable and 
fixed costs.
A variable cost is the cost of 
variable factors of production, which 
change along with a firm’s output.
A fixed cost is the cost of fixed 
factors of production, which a firm 
must pay even if it produces zero 
output.

$200 per day. These are the fixed costs (FC) given in column 5 of Exhibit 6.3. These costs 
are the same no matter how many workers are hired. Thus, fixed costs do not vary in the 
short-run, but variable costs do. Column 6 shows total cost (TC), which is the sum of vari-
able and fixed costs for a particular quantity of output.
We are provided with three more interesting cost concepts if we divide both sides of our 
total cost equation by output (quantity The Cheeseman produces):
 Total cost
Q
= Variable cost
Q
+ Fixed cost
Q
.
The term on the left-hand side of this equation is called average total cost (ATC), which 
is total cost divided by total output. Column 7 in Exhibit 6.3 shows the average total cost 
for The Cheeseman. For example, the ATC for The Wisconsin Cheeseman with an output 
of 321 units is computed by taking the total cost of $416 and dividing it by the total output 
of 321, which yields $1.29, as shown in Exhibit 6.3. This means that when it produces 
321 units, the average cost per cheese box packed is $1.29.
The first term on the right-hand side of this equation is called the average variable cost 
(AVC), which is the total variable cost divided by total output. For The Cheeseman, when it 
produces 321 units, its AVC is $0.67, which means that it pays its variable factor of produc-
tion (labor) an average of $0.67 per cheese box packed.
Finally, average fixed cost (AFC) is the total fixed cost divided by the total output. For 
The Cheeseman, when it produces 321 units, its AFC is $0.62, which means that it pays its 
fixed factor of production (physical capital) an average of $0.62 per cheese box packed. What 
this all means is that of the $1.29 average total cost when The Cheeseman produces 321 units, 
$0.67 goes to variable costs (labor) and $0.62 goes to fixed costs (physical capital).
Our last cost concept is marginal cost, which is presented in column 10 of Exhibit 6.3. 
Marginal cost (MC) is the change in total cost associated with producing one more unit of 
output. Marginal cost can be written as:
 Marginal cost = Change in total cost
Change in output .
When The Wisconsin Cheeseman produces 321 units, a MC of $0.63 means that it costs 
The Cheeseman $0.63 to produce the 321st cheese box. Exhibit 6.3 also reveals another 
interesting relationship: marginal cost and marginal product are inversely related to one 
another. As one increases the other automatically decreases. To see why, consider The 
Cheeseman’s production and cost relationships. When The Cheeseman adds its first few 
workers (up to 4), the total output goes up and the marginal product also increases, decreas-
ing marginal cost. After too many workers are hired, they find themselves wasting time, 
waiting to use equipment. This leads to lower marginal product and higher marginal cost.
Using the data from Exhibit 6.3, Exhibit 6.4 shows a graphical representation of the im-
portant relationships between costs and quantity produced: the marginal cost curve, average 
total cost curve, and average variable cost curve for The Cheeseman. Output quantity is plot-
ted on the x-axis and costs (in dollars) on the y-axis. One interesting feature about these cost 
curves is that when the marginal cost curve is below the average cost curves (both average 
total cost and average variable cost), they must be falling or sloping downward, and when the 
marginal cost curve is above the average cost curves, they must be rising or upward-sloping.
Why? This is by itself the very nature of the definition of marginal cost. To capture this 
­intuition, think of your overall grade point average (GPA) as average total cost and your 
­semester GPA as marginal cost. Say that in your freshman year you earn all B’s, a 3.0 GPA. 
Now let’s say that in your sophomore year you earn straight A’s, a 4.0 GPA. What will hap-
pen to your overall GPA? It will rise; in fact, if you take the exact same number of credits in 
each of your freshman and sophomore years, your cumulative GPA will now be 3.5. Now 
what happens to your overall GPA if in your junior year you earn all C’s, a GPA of 2.0? It 
decreases. This is because your new grades are below the average that you established in 
your first two years.
This also provides the intuition for why MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimums: 
when MC is below ATC and AVC they must be falling, and when MC is above ATC and AVC 
they must be rising, as in Exhibit 6.4. An understanding of these curves leads to powerful 
implications, as we discuss next.
Average total cost (ATC) is the total 
cost divided by the total output.
Average variable cost (AVC) is the 
total variable cost divided by the 
total output.
Average fixed cost (AFC) is the 
total fixed cost divided by the total 
output.
Marginal cost is the change in total 
cost associated with producing one 
more unit of output.

The Rewards of Doing Business: Introducing Revenue Curves
We are now ready to look at the third component of the seller’s problem: the price at which 
a firm can sell its goods. A firm makes money from selling goods, and The Wisconsin 
Cheeseman is no different. The revenue of a firm is the amount of money it brings in from 
the sale of its outputs. Revenue is determined by the price of goods sold times the number 
of units sold:
Total revenue = Price × Quantity sold.
Recall that in perfectly competitive markets, sellers can sell all they want at the market 
price. Thus, they are price-takers.
But what determines the price of cheese boxes? Chapter 4 can lend insights to this 
­question: the price comes from the intersection of the market demand curve and the market 
Revenue is the amount of money 
the firm brings in from the sale of its 
outputs.

Total Cost, and Average Variable Cost 
Curves for The Wisconsin Cheeseman
This figure plots several cost measures 
with the output (or quantity) on the  
x-axis and the cost (or price) on the  
y-axis. Each cost measure is plotted 
across various output levels. Notice

and AVC curves at their respective

Imagine that you are asked to help in a 
fund-raising effort for your college.1 You 
learn that your college has an old call cen-
ter that it doesn’t use. You ask why and 
the reply is “Well, the cost of making a 
call is $1, while the cost of mailing a let-
ter is only $0.50.” You are shocked: how 
could each call be that expensive?
After a little prodding, your college 
­admits how the people who prepare 
their mailings calculated this figure of 
a ­dollar per call. They had simply summed the cost of 
the ­computer-networked phone-banking system your 
school had purchased years before and the cost of 
paying students to make calls and divided by the total 
number of calls to obtain the ­average 
­total cost of a call. Of course, they 
didn’t take into ­account the fact that the 
school had ­already bought the comput-
ers and that the marginal cost of every 
call was very, very low—equal only to 
the amount you would have to pay a 
caller for a ­minute of time! If you know 
that the ­donation rate over the phone is 
much higher than the donation rate from 
mailings, and the marginal cost of send-
ing a letter ­exceeds that of making a phone call, then 
after reading this chapter, you will know to ­immediately 
advise your college to pick up the phones and start 
dialing!

supply curve. This is just like any other market equilibrium you 
learned about in Chapter 4: the intersection of market supply and 
market demand gives the equilibrium price.
Exhibit 6.5 reveals this intuition. Panel (a) of Exhibit 6.5 shows 
the market supply and market demand curves. Recall that we can 
construct the market demand curve as described in Chapters 4 
and 5. We can construct the market supply curve in exactly the same manner as the market 
demand curve—through horizontally summing the individual supply curves. To see how 
this works, let’s assume that in equilibrium, the cheese box packing industry has 10,000 
identical firms, which each produce 1,225 cheese boxes per day. Thus, a total of 12,250,000 
cheese boxes are packed daily in this market. As shown in panel (b) of ­Exhibit 6.5, this 
equilibrium quantity occurs at an equilibrium price of $1.13 per cheese box packed.
At this point, it is important to recognize the difference between the demand curve fac-
ing The Cheeseman and the demand curve in a perfectly competitive market. As panel (b) 
of Exhibit 6.5 reveals, a perfectly competitive firm, such as The Wisconsin Cheeseman, 
faces a horizontal demand curve, or a demand curve that is perfectly elastic. What this 
means is that The Cheeseman can pack as many cheese boxes as it desires and be paid the 
market equilibrium price ($1.13) for every cheese box packed. If The Cheeseman attempts 
to charge a little bit more than $1.13 per box, it will have no customers because buyers 
can go to a different packer and pay $1.13 per box. In addition, there is no reason for The 
­Cheeseman to lower its price below $1.13 to attract buyers because it can sell all it wants 
at $1.13 per box.
Besides showing the demand curve facing The Cheeseman, panel (b) of ­Exhibit 6.5 
shows the marginal revenue curve. Marginal revenue is the change in total revenue asso-
ciated with producing one more unit of output. In a perfectly competitive market, marginal 
revenue is equal to the market price. Therefore, the marginal revenue curve is equivalent to 
the demand curve facing sellers. Because the price that The Cheeseman faces is $1.13, the 
marginal revenue is $1.13 for every cheese box packed. We are now in a position to learn 
about the good stuff—making money!
Exhibit 6.5 Supply and Demand: The Market Versus The Wisconsin Cheeseman
Panel (a) summarizes the market supply and market demand curves for cheese boxes. 
The price determined by the market equilibrium is the price The ­Cheeseman faces, 
which is shown in panel (b). We think of that price as representing the demand curve 
The Cheeseman faces, which is the flat blue line. This demand curve is equal to 
­marginal revenue because it represents the change in revenues from selling one more 
cheese box.

Putting It All Together: Using the Three Components  
to Do the Best You Can
Now that we have the three components of the seller’s problem in place, we can begin to 
construct how these three elements are used to maximize the firm’s profits. The profits of 
a firm are the difference between total revenues and total costs:
Profits = Total revenues − Total costs.
For The Wisconsin Cheeseman to determine its profits, there is only one more question to 
answer: how much to produce? To figure out what quantity maximizes profits, we need to 
think about a production level and conduct a thought experiment as to how producing a bit 
more or a bit less affects both revenues and costs. That is, the key behind maximizing prof-
its is to think about the firm’s marginal revenues and marginal costs. This is an application 
of optimizing from Chapter 3.
To see how this works, consider Exhibit 6.6, which recreates panel (b) of Exhibit 6.5. 
Let’s first think about point A in the exhibit. At this point, The Cheeseman hires 9 workers 
and it produces 939 cheese boxes. At this production level it costs $0.85 to pack the last 
cheese box, as given by the marginal cost in Exhibit 6.3. We know that The ­Cheeseman is 
paid $1.13 for each packed box.
Can The Cheeseman earn higher profits? Yes. If it produces one more cheese box, it 
increases revenues by $1.13, which is greater than the $0.85 it costs to produce. Profit 
could be increased by $0.28 just by selling one more cheese box! This provides a gen-
eral rule: if a firm can produce another unit of output at a marginal cost that is less than 
the market price (that is, MC < price), it should do so, because it can make a profit on 
producing that unit.
Consider the other side of the coin: if The Cheeseman was producing at point B—hiring 
17 workers and producing 1,438 units. Its marginal cost of producing the last unit is now 
greater than the market price ($1.50 versus $1.13); thus it loses money by producing that 
last unit. It therefore shouldn’t produce it and should hire fewer workers.
In fact, with this marginal decision making in mind, it’s straightforward to see how a 
firm maximizes its profits. It should expand production until the point where:
Marginal revenue = Marginal cost.
This is the same as producing where price equals marginal cost because marginal rev-
enue equals price in a perfectly competitive market.
Exhibit 6.6 Movement of 
Production toward Equilibrium
The red curve is The Cheeseman’s 
marginal cost curve, and the blue 
line is The Cheeseman’s marginal 
revenue curve. At point A, The 
Cheeseman should produce more 
to increase profits. At point B, The 
Cheeseman should produce less. 
To maximize profits, Cheeseman 
produces where marginal cost 
equals marginal revenue.

How can we compute the level of profits at this point? One aid is to overlay the aver-
age total cost curve to Exhibit 6.6, which we do in Exhibit 6.7. Because total revenues = 
price × Q and total costs = ATC × Q, we can write total profits as:
Price × Q − ATC × Q = (Price − ATC) × Q.
In other words, we can compute total profits by taking the difference between price and 
average total cost at the point of production and multiplying that difference by the total 
quantity produced. In the case of producing at MR = MC, this provides the shaded area in 
Exhibit 6.7.
We can compute this area as follows:
(P − ATC) × Q = ($1.13 − $0.93) × 1,225 = $245.
This follows because The Cheeseman is paid $1.13 per box at a production level of 
1,225 boxes. At this level of production, the average total cost is $0.93 (see Exhibit 6.3). 
So, taking the price of $1.13 and subtracting the average total cost of $0.93, we get $0.20, 
which is per-unit profit. We then multiply this per-unit profit by quantity sold, or 1,225, 
to find the daily profit figure of $245. This profit level is equal to the base times the 
height of the shaded rectangle in Exhibit 6.7. Because marginal revenue equals marginal 
cost (MR = MC) at this level of production, we know that this choice optimizes profits 
and represents the equilibrium for The Cheeseman: once producing at this point, The 
Cheeseman will not change its production activities unless something else in the market 
changes.
Profits of only $245 a day might seem trivial, but note that when economists discuss 
profits we are expressing something much different from what you’re used to reading about 
in the newspapers. For example, when a major corporation reports “record profits,” it is re-
porting what economists call accounting profits. Accounting profits are equal to revenues 
minus explicit costs. Explicit costs are the sorts of line-item expenditures that accountants 
carefully tally and report, like wages for workers or equipment expenditures. But firms also 
face implicit costs. For example, the owner of The Wisconsin Cheeseman may have a high 
opportunity cost of time that he is sacrificing in order to run The ­Cheeseman (to see where 
an implicit cost like this would play out in Exhibit 6.3, the cost of the owner’s time would 
be in the Fixed Cost column). Much like the cost of labor and machines, this implicit cost 
is subtracted away from revenues to produce our conception of profits, ­economic profits. 
Economic profits are equal to total revenue minus both explicit and implicit costs. As a re-
sult, it is still feasible to run a business that is earning small (or even zero) economic profits, 
as we demonstrate later in this chapter.
Accounting profits are equal to 
total revenue minus explicit costs.
Economic profits are equal to total 
revenue minus both explicit and 
implicit costs.
Exhibit 6.7 Visualizing The 
Wisconsin Cheeseman’s Profits  
with MC, MR, and ATC
Adding The Cheeseman’s ATC to 
­Exhibit 6.6 allows us to visualize 
­profits graphically. The shaded box 
represents The Cheeseman’s profits. 
To see why, remember that profits are 
the difference between total revenue 
and total costs. Because MR repre-
sents price and ATC represents the 
cost per unit produced, their differ-
ence at the quantity where marginal 
cost equals marginal revenue mul-
tiplied by quantity produced yields 
total profits: ($1.13 − $0.93) × 1225 
= $245.

One common way of thinking is that if you maximize per-
unit profit, you will maximize total profit. It only makes 
sense, right? If the firm is earning $10 per unit, it must be 
doing better than if it were earning $8 per unit. The flaw 
in this reasoning is that it only takes half of the optimal 
solution into consideration. That is, from the total profit 
equation it only takes (price − ATC) into consideration.
Recall that total profit comprises not only how much 
you sell each unit for in the market but also how many 
units you actually sell. If the $10 per unit is earned with 
500 units of sales, then total profits are $5,000. But if the 
$8 per unit is earned with 1,000 units of sales, then the 
profit is $8,000—considerably more, even though the per-
unit profits are lower.
The data in Exhibit 6.3 show this intuition for The 
­Wisconsin Cheeseman. Because marginal revenue is a 
horizontal line, the per-unit profit is maximized when the 
ATC is at its lowest point. This happens to be point A 
in Exhibit 6.6. But it’s not difficult to compute that The 
Cheeseman’s profit at this point is lower than when pro-
duction is expanded until MR = MC. In fact, at point A 
daily profit is $215.97. This is much smaller than the daily 
profit of $245 when profits are optimized. This might 
seem like a trivial difference, but if you translate these 
numbers across several plants and over several years, 
you’re talking about big money.
CHOICE & CONSEQUENCE
Maximizing Total Profit, Not Per-Unit Profit
The firm’s supply curve relates ­output 
to prices.
The MR = MC rule is powerful because, by linking the market price to the marginal cost 
curve, we can determine in the short run how a competitive firm changes its output when 
the market price changes. That is, it permits us to describe the 
firm’s supply curve, which relates output to prices. To see why, 
think about how the market price determines the firm’s output 
choice.
For instance, how would The Cheeseman change its behavior 
if the price for packing cheese increased to $1.41 per box, as 
shown in Exhibit 6.8? We would expect The Cheeseman to increase its quantity supplied, 
but by how much? ­Using the intuition discussed earlier, we expect The Cheeseman to ex-
pand production until MC = MR3, which occurs at 1,390 units.

If the market price 
changes, the marginal 
revenue curve that The 
Cheeseman faces will also 
change. Here, when The 
Cheeseman faces an up-
ward shift of the marginal 
revenue curve to MR3, 
production will increase. 
On the other hand, if The 
Cheeseman faces a down-
ward shift of the marginal 
revenue curve to MR2, 
production will decrease.

If, however, the market price for cheese boxes decreased to $0.78 per box (also shown in  
Exhibit 6.8), The Cheeseman would decrease production until MC = MR2, which occurs at 
854 units. Importantly, we can trace out The Cheeseman’s supply curve by completing this 
exercise for various price levels.
Price Elasticity of Supply
When considering how responsive the firm is to price changes, much like the case with 
demand in Chapter 5, we can use elasticity measures. In this case, the most important 
measure that economists use is called the price elasticity of supply, the measure of how 
responsive quantity supplied is to price changes is computed as:
Price elasticity of supply (εs) = Percentage change in quantity supplied
Percentage change in price
.
The price elasticity of supply will tend to be positive because as price increases, firms 
tend to increase their quantity supplied.
Characterizing supply curves is quite similar to the descriptions we used to describe 
demand curves in Chapter 5. For example, an elastic supply means that quantity supplied 
is quite responsive to price changes: any given percentage change in price leads to a larger 
percentage change in quantity supplied. Panel (a) in Exhibit 6.9 shows the ­extreme case: 
a perfectly elastic supply curve. In this case, even a very small change in price leads to an 
infinite change in quantity supplied.
Alternatively, an inelastic supply means that any given percentage change in price 
causes a smaller percentage change in quantity supplied. An extreme case is depicted in 
panel (c) of Exhibit 6.9. Here the supply curve is perfectly inelastic: at every price level 
the same quantity is supplied. An example of such a case is an oil refinery that is ­operating 
at full capacity: even if gasoline prices increase, it cannot increase production in the short 
run. Similarly, if corn prices suddenly jump in July, it is difficult for Iowan farmers to 
produce more corn in the short run. They can plant more corn next year, but not this year.
In between these two extremes are typical supply curves—those that are upward-­
sloping. One example is presented in panel (b) of Exhibit 6.9. In these cases, the steeper 
the supply curve, the less sensitive quantity supplied is to price changes. Panel (b) of 
­Exhibit 6.9 shows a special type of supply curve, one that is unit-elastic. A price increase 
from $5 to $6 (a 20 percent increase) leads to a 20 percent increase in quantity supplied; 
likewise, a price decrease from $6 to $5 (a 17 percent decrease) leads to a 17 percent 
­decrease in quantity supplied. For unit-elastic supply curves, the elasticity is equal to  
1: a 1 percent change in price leads to a 1 percent change in quantity supplied.
Price elasticity of supply is the 
measure of how responsive quantity 
supplied is to price changes.

Much like demand elasticities, the size of supply elasticities is determined by several 
factors. Key determinants include whether the firm has excess inventories—if The Cheese-
man has several tons of cheese on hand, it can more easily increase production quantities. 
Likewise, how long the firm has to respond to price changes is important—the longer the 
time to respond, the more elastic the supply. Finally, if workers are readily available, then 
supply will be more elastic because the firm can respond to price increases by quickly hir-
ing workers.
Shutdown
With an understanding of how quantity supplied responds to price changes, we can con-
sider extreme market situations, such as when the firm should shut down, or suspend, op-
erations. A shutdown is a short-run decision to not produce anything during a specific time 
period. Think about the case when the market price drops to $0.59 per cheese box. Now the 
MR = MC rule directs The Cheeseman to produce at point S in Exhibit 6.10 (444 units). Is 
this a profit-maximizing point of production?
The answer is no. This is because at this particular price the firm does not even bring 
in enough money to cover its average variable cost of $0.65 per unit. Why? Note that the 
price is below average variable cost at this point ($0.59 < $0.65); thus if The Cheeseman 
continues operations, it is paying the variable input—workers—more to produce cheese 
boxes than the firm is bringing in per cheese box.
The Cheeseman should shut down because by doing so it would lose only the fixed costs 
of production ($200) rather than the fixed costs ($200) plus the uncovered variable costs 
($0.06 per unit, or 444 × $0.06 = $26.64). This is so because by shutting down the plant, 
it employs no workers, and hence has zero variable cost.
You might think, “Wait a second! Why shut down and absorb the fixed costs? By pro-
ducing, The Cheeseman can at least earn some revenues.” That is true. The Cheeseman 
would bring in money by remaining in operation, but for every unit it produces it is paying 
labor $0.06 more than it is receiving in marginal revenue. The optimization rule that fol-
lows is that if revenues do not cover all of the variable costs, then shutdown is optimal in 
the short run:
The firm should shut down if price is less than AVC.
So, should The Cheeseman ever produce in the short run if total costs exceed total rev-
enues? The answer is yes. Consider point C in Exhibit 6.10. This is a point of production 
where price is greater than average variable cost, but price is less than average total cost. In 
this case, the price is greater than the average variable cost; thus all of the variable costs are 
covered by revenues. This is an instance when The Cheeseman should continue operations

even though it is losing money because besides covering all of the variable costs, it is also 
covering a fraction of the fixed costs.
You might think that it does not make sense for The Cheeseman to continue production 
at point C; after all, the firm is losing money! Why not shut down? The key is that we as-
sume fixed costs are sunk costs, which are a special type of cost that, once they have been 
committed, can never be recovered (think of a 5-year building lease—The Cheeseman is 
by law required to pay rent over the entire 5-year period). That is, The Cheeseman can’t 
retrieve sunk costs in the short run. One of the important things to remember about sunk 
costs is that once they are committed, they shouldn’t affect current or future production 
decisions. The reason for this is simple: these costs are sunk—that is, lost, regardless of 
what action is chosen next—they can’t affect the relative costs and benefits of current and 
future production decisions. By continuing operations at point C, The Cheeseman is at least 
covering some of the fixed cost.
These examples lead to construction of the short-run supply curve for The Cheeseman: 
it is the portion of its marginal cost curve that lies above average variable cost. If the 
market price puts The Cheeseman at a point on its marginal cost curve that lies below the 
minimum of the average variable cost curve, then the firm should shut down. Otherwise, it 
should produce. Exhibit 6.11 shows The Cheeseman’s short-run supply curve as the mar-
ginal cost curve above the average variable cost curve.
Sunk costs are costs that, once 
committed, can never be recovered 
and should not affect current and 
future production decisions.
Producer surplus is the difference 
between the market price and the 
marginal cost curve.
Producer surplus is computed by 
taking the difference between the 
market price and the marginal cost 
curve.
Similar to the concept of consumer surplus, economists have a means of measuring surplus 
for sellers. This is called producer surplus. Producer surplus is computed by taking the 
difference between the market price and the marginal cost curve.
Thus, graphically, producer surplus is the area above the 
­marginal cost curve and below the equilibrium price line. In 
this way, it is distinct from economic profits, as we measured in 
­Exhibit 6.7, because economic profits include a consideration of 
total cost, not just marginal cost.
Let’s consider producer surplus for The Cheeseman. Assume 
that The Cheeseman is facing a market price of $2, as depicted in 
Exhibit 6.12.
As it turns out, The Cheeseman can produce many units at a mar-
ginal cost below the market price. In Exhibit 6.12, we depict this 
surplus as the pink-shaded region that is below the market price and above The Cheeseman’s 
marginal cost curve. Notice the similarity between this and consumer surplus—whereas a

consumer’s surplus arises from having a willingness to pay above the market price, a pro-
ducer’s surplus arises from selling units at a price that is above marginal cost.
Similar to consumer surplus, we can add up sellers’ producer surplus to obtain the total 
producer surplus in the market. We do this by measuring the area above the marginal cost 
curve that is below the equilibrium price line to compute producer surplus for the entire 
market.
When we have linear supply curves, we can use a mathematical formula to compute the 
producer surplus. Consider panel (a) of Exhibit 6.13, which shows a supply curve for daily 
trucking services to ship cheese from Madison, Wisconsin to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. If the 
equilibrium market price is $100 per trip, then we compute the producer surplus as the base 
of the triangle multiplied by the height of the triangle multiplied by ½:
Producer surplus = ½ × (Base of triangle × Height of triangle) = ½ × (4 × $80) = $160.
This means that total producer surplus per day is $160 in this market.
There are several ways in which producer surplus can increase or decrease. For exam-
ple, if there is a shift in the market demand curve that causes a higher equilibrium market 
price, producer surplus increases because the area above the supply curve and below the 
equilibrium price line gets larger. This is shown in panel (b) of Exhibit 6.13. Now producer 
surplus is ½ × (5 × $100) = $250.

Section 6.5   |  From the Short Run to the Long Run
167
6.5
Thus far we have only considered The Cheeseman’s daily production decision, and in ­doing 
so, we’ve treated the facilities and machinery (or physical capital) that The Cheeseman uses 
as fixed. But firms often think about more than just each day’s production. For example, 
many businesses issue quarterly or annual reports that discuss the firm’s long-term out-
look. In this section we move from the daily supply decision to the long run, where The 
­Cheeseman can combine any quantity of labor and physical capital to maximize profits.
What exactly is the long run, though? As we have already noted, the long run is defined 
as a period of time in which all factors of production are variable. That is, in the long run 
there are no fixed factors of production because even machines and buildings can be retro-
fitted, purchased, expanded, or sold. Because of this fact, there are important differences 
between a firm’s short- and long-run supply curves.
These differences can be understood by considering The Cheeseman’s production deci-
sions. In the short run, if it wants to change production, it can only do so by hiring more 
workers or laying off workers. This is because only labor is variable in the short run. In the 
long run, however, The Cheeseman searches for the optimal combination of workers and 
building size (physical capital). That is, in the long run, The Cheese­man is able to combine 
workers and physical capital to achieve the minimal ATC for each output level. This differ-
ence causes the short-run cost curves to be above the long-run cost curve.
To see the relationship between the short- and long-run cost curves, consider short-run 
ATCs for three different plant sizes: one small, one medium, and one large. These are each 
shown in panel (a) of Exhibit 6.14. Because in the long run The Cheeseman is able to 
choose the plant size that minimizes costs, its long-run ATC lies below the three short-run 
ATCs. One way to think about it is that the average cost rises more in the short run with 
increased production because The Cheeseman can only hire more labor; in the long run it 
can hire more labor and purchase more physical capital.
As Exhibit 6.14 shows, the long-run ATC curve has a pronounced U-shape. On panel (a) 
of the U, ATC decreases as output increases. Over this range, economies of scale exist. For 
The Wisconsin Cheeseman, we find that economies of scale occur over the daily output 
range until about 444. Such an effect might occur because as the scale of the plant gets big-
ger, workers have more opportunities to specialize. When ATC does not change with the

to the Long Run

Economies of scale occur when 
ATC falls as the quantity produced 
increases.

In the long run, The Cheeseman is not constrained by its facilities. The dark green 
curve in panel (a) shows the long-run ATC curve of The Cheeseman with several

size. Panel (b) shows the long-run supply curve.

level of output, the plant experiences constant returns to scale. This occurs over the output 
range of 444 to 1,690. Diseconomies of scale occur when ATC increases as output rises. For 
The Cheeseman, this occurs at output levels exceeding 1,690. This might happen because 
management teams begin to get spread too thin or duplication of tasks occurs.
Long-Run Supply Curve
Panel (b) of Exhibit 6.14 shows the long-run supply curve (marginal cost curve) alongside 
the long-run ATC curve. We can use this marginal cost curve to construct The Cheeseman’s 
long-run supply curve in a way similar to how we derived the short-run supply curve from 
the marginal cost curve.
Consider point A. Should The Cheeseman produce at this price? The answer is no. 
This is because this price is lower than average total cost, and therefore The Cheeseman is 
spending more money to produce cheese boxes than it is paid for them. So total revenue is 
less than total costs, leading to a negative economic profit.
There is really no choice for Cheeseman but to exit the industry because it cannot profit-
ably exist at the equilibrium price. Note that exit is a long-run decision to leave the market. 
We can therefore state a long-run decision rule:
Exit if: Price is less than ATC or, likewise, if total revenue is less than total cost.
This reasoning naturally leads to the construction of a long-run supply curve for The 
­Cheeseman that is different from its short-run supply curve: the long-run supply curve 
is the portion of its marginal cost curve that lies above average total cost. This is shown 
in panel (b) of Exhibit 6.14 with the solid red line depicting the long-run supply curve. 
Exit is a long-run decision to leave 
the market.
Recently, we visited Chrysler’s car manufacturing plant 
in Sterling Heights, Michigan, where thousands of cars 
are produced annually by thousands of workers. The as-
sembly plant houses highly skilled workers and plenty of 
robotics to put together the various pieces to create a 
final product—combining sheet metal with hundreds of 
loose parts to make a shiny rimmed automobile.
In one part of the plant, we saw a welded frame (the 
chassis) moving along a large conveyor belt. The con-
veyor belt swerved through many teams of workers, 
who were responsible for adding to this initial baseline 
component.
One team carefully set the engine in place. The next 
put in front and rear suspension, a different team later 
installed the transmission, then another team was respon-
sible for the steering box, and yet another for the brake 
system. Before the car was painted with three coats of 
shiny paint, inspectors made sure no defects were appar-
ent. Finally, before leaving the lot, even more inspectors 
made sure that the brakes, windshield wipers, windows, 
and other parts were operating up to standard.
What is noteworthy about this process is the specializa-
tion that occurred. Each worker had a single job: install a 
specific part, inspect, or paint. Each specific job involved 
a complex set of tasks that must be precisely completed 
to provide the quality and quantity necessary to ensure 
the plant was optimizing profits.
We can imagine that if workers instead were dispatched 
to build these cars separately, they would not be able to 
produce one per day in total. But, with specialization, this 
plant can produce hundreds of cars per day. In this way, 
a large assembly plant can produce more cars per worker 
than a small assembly plant. This is exactly what Henry 
Ford realized in 1908 when he introduced the world to 
the first affordable car—the Model T.
Although at the time Ford had many advantages—for 
example, the success of the Model T arose in part from 
using Vanadium steel, which put Ford years ahead of its 
competition—specialization was especially important. 
Ford’s plants and every car plant now reaps economies 
of scale. Much as for The Wisconsin Cheeseman, econo-
mies of scale are achieved when ATC declines as output 
increases. One of the key features in prosperous modern 
economies is that specialization leads to more production 
per worker.

Much like the short-run and long-run analysis for the individual firm, at the industry level 
there are critical distinctions between the short run and the long run. The primary difference 
is that even though the number of firms in the industry is fixed in 
the short run, in the long-run firms can enter or exit the industry 
in response to changes in profitability because in the long run they 
have the ability to change both labor and physical capital.
Firm Entry
When would a firm decide to enter a market? Steve’s Wholesale 
Cheese (an actual firm in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin located near 
The Wisconsin Cheeseman) is considering entering the cheese-­
packing industry, which currently has 10,000 identical firms. 
Suppose Steve’s Wholesale is identical to The Cheeseman and to the other firms. Further, 
assume that the current market price is above Steve’s minimum long-run average total cost, 
as in point E of Exhibit 6.15.
Should Steve enter? The answer is yes. Notice that because the price is $1.13, which 
is greater than Steve’s average total cost of $0.93, Steve can enter the industry and make 
a profit of (P − ATC) on each unit produced. In this case, Steve would earn profits given 
by the area of the shaded rectangle (P − ATC) × Q. Therefore, Steve’s Wholesale Cheese 
should take advantage of this opportunity and enter the cheese-packing business.
From the Firm to the Market: 
Long-Run Competitive Equilibrium
6.6 
The dotted line below ATC is the portion of the supply curve that exists in the short run, but 
not in the long run because it is between the AVC and ATC curves.
The Cheeseman’s total profit in the long run is computed identically to its short-run 
profit: total revenue minus total cost. Thus, profit equals the difference between price and 
average total cost multiplied by the quantity sold: (P − ATC) × Q. Accordingly, when 
computing producer surplus in the long run, we take the difference between market price 
and the seller’s long-run marginal cost curve.
From knowing how to derive the short-run and long-run supply curves, a natural ques-
tion arises: what factors determine where the firm’s supply curve is located on the graph? 
Because the supply curve is the marginal cost curve above the AVC curve (in the short run) 
or above the ATC curve (in the long run), the answer to this question revolves around cost 
considerations. Similar to the individual demand curve, there are factors that cause the 
firm’s supply curve to shift leftward or rightward. These factors were more fully discussed 
in Chapter 4, but include input prices (such as labor costs) and technological innovations.
Even though the number of firms 
in the industry is fixed in the short 
run, in the long run firms can enter 
or exit the industry in response to 
changes in profitability.
Exhibit 6.15 Steve’s Wholesale 
Cheese Entry Decision
Considering a new firm, Steve’s 
Wholesale (which is identical to 
The Cheeseman), we see that 
there are potential profits to earn 
by entering. We can see this by 
noting that the area of the shaded 
box representing economic 
­profits is greater than zero when 
the market price is at $1.13.

It’s not hard to imagine that many firms would make this calculation, realize they can 
be profitable in the industry, and decide to enter. What would happen then? If there is free 
entry into the industry—which means entry is unfettered by any special legal or technical 
­barriers—the entry process continues until the last entrant drives the market price down to 
the minimum average total cost. Let’s walk through why this is the case.
First, think about what entry of new firms does to the market supply curve. Because the 
market supply curve is the summation of individual firms’ supply curves, adding new firms 
causes the industry to provide higher quantity at any given price. After all, the entrants 
must be added to the existing industry total. In other words, entry shifts the market supply 
curve to the right.
This shift will cause the market price to fall. Why? Panel (a) of Exhibit 6.16 provides 
the intuition. We know that the market price in a perfectly competitive industry is deter-
mined by the intersection of the market demand and market supply curves (point A in the 
exhibit). A shift to the right of the market supply curve from S1 to S2 lowers the market 
price from $1.13 to $0.90 (point B in panel (a) of Exhibit 6.16).
Will another firm decide to enter? No, because the market price drops to the minimum of 
the average total cost curve (point E in panel (b) of Exhibit 6.16). At this point, the market 
reaches an equilibrium because no more firms will enter. For this example, Steve entering the 
market moved the price down to the minimum average total cost of the industry, resulting in 
zero economic profits. There is now no longer a profit incentive for other 
suppliers to enter.
If upon entry the new price would have been above the minimum 
average total cost, then another firm would have entered because there 
remains an incentive to enter. This would further shift the market sup-
ply curve to the right, lowering the market price even more. This would 
continue until the market price was driven to the minimum average total 
cost of the industry.
Firm Exit
Now suppose that once we reach that equilibrium, a group of research-
ers issues a report claiming that touching cheese can give skin irritations  
to toddlers. This announcement causes the market demand curve for 
cheese boxes to shift leftward. Assume that this shift of the market ­ 
demand curve for cheese boxes causes the equilibrium price to change 
from $0.90 to $0.71, as in panel (a) of Exhibit 6.17, where the price drops 
There is free entry into an industry 
when entry is unfettered by any 
special legal or technical barriers.
Exhibit 6.16 Firm Entry in the Long Run
Panel (a) shows that with firm entry, the market supply curve shifts to the right, moving 
equilibrium from point A to point B. This decreases the market price. Panel (b) shows 
the effect of this change in price on The Cheeseman, which will produce at point E.

from point A to B. The price is now below the minimum average total cost of the firms, 
as shown in panel (b) of Exhibit 6.17 at point T. This causes firms in the industry to make 
­negative profits. Therefore, if there is free exit from the market—in which a firm’s exit is 
unfettered by any special legal or technical barriers—in the long run some cheese packers 
will close shop and leave the industry. Because we’ve assumed that all firms are identical, 
all firms in the market are equally unprofitable and would prefer to exit. You might wonder 
which firms exit. There are a couple of ways to think about this. One is that there are a lucky 
few who figure out that they’re losing money before the others, and they leave first. The other, 
probably more realistic, possibility is that there are cost differences across firms, and the 
highest-cost firms exit first. We examine an example of this in the ­appendix to this chapter, 
but for now let’s continue with the example of all firms being identical.
This exit from the industry causes the market supply curve to shift leftward, raising the 
market price from point B to point C in panel (a) of Exhibit 6.17. Just as entry continued 
until the price was driven down to the minimum average total cost, exit continues until the 
market price rises to the minimum average total cost. Once this point is reached, we are in a 
long-run equilibrium. This occurs at point E in panel (b) of Exhibit 6.17.
Notice that regardless of initial demand or supply shifts and accompanying price changes 
in the market, entry or exit causes the market to reach the minimum of the long-run average 
total cost curve. That is, the equilibrium quantity in the market might change due to market 
demand and supply shifts, but the equilibrium price always returns to the minimum of the 
long-run average total cost.
Zero Profits in the Long Run
We can see that free entry and free exit are forces that push the market price in a perfectly 
competitive industry toward the long-run minimum average total cost. This leads to two 
important outcomes under our perfectly competitive market assumption.
First, even though the industry’s short-run supply curve is upward-sloping for the rea-
sons we discussed above, the industry’s long-run supply curve is horizontal at the long-run 
minimum average total cost level. Why? Price always returns to the minimum average total 
cost, and because average total cost does not change, price always remains the same in the 
long run. This is because variations in long-run industry output are absorbed by firm entry 
and exit, causing long-run quantities to change, but not equilibrium prices.
Let’s walk through an example to illustrate this intuition. Consider panel (a) in ­Exhibit 6.18, 
which shows an initial market demand of D1 and supply of S. The initial equilibrium quantity is 
Q1 and price is P1, which we know is equal to the minimum average total cost.
There is free exit from an industry 
when exit is unfettered by any 
special legal or technical barriers.
Exhibit 6.17 Firm Exit After Demand Shifts Leftward
Panel (a)  shows that if market demand shifts to the left, price will decrease from 
point A to B. At this new price, firms will exit, which will cause the market supply 
curve to shift to the left, moving the market equilibrium to point C and putting The 
­Cheeseman at point E in panel (b).

Chapter 6  |  Sellers and Incentives
Suppose market demand shifts rightward to D2. While prices might temporarily rise, 
entry of new firms in the long-run shifts the supply curve to the right, as in panel (b) of ­ 
Exhibit 6.18. As entry continues, supply eventually reaches S2 and price falls back to the 
long-run minimum average total cost, or a price of P1. If we connect the two long-run 
­equilibria, we have the market’s long-run supply curve Slong-run, which is horizontal at P1, 
shown in panel (c) of Exhibit 6.18.
So, we see that in the long run price equals the minimum of average total cost because 
of entry and exit. Because there are a number of identical firms standing ready to enter 
or exit the industry, in the long run as much quantity as necessary can be produced at the 
minimum average total cost.
The second long-run outcome achieved with free entry and exit is that firms in a perfectly 
competitive market earn zero economic profits in equilibrium. Economic profits serve an 
important signal as to whether firms are better off in this industry or some other industry: if 
economic profits are positive, then entry occurs until economic profits fall to zero. If eco-
nomic profits are negative, exit occurs until economic profits rise to zero. Free entry and exit 
forces price to the minimum average total cost, and therefore economic profits are zero in 
the long-run equilibrium.
An important assumption that we make in this analysis is that firms are identical and 
can hire inputs (labor and physical capital) at a constant cost (i.e. the industry can hire as 
many workers as it desires at $72 per day). When firms are not identical in terms of their 
cost structure, we find results that diverge from this zero economic profit conclusion. In 
such cases, low-cost firms can earn positive economic profits in long-run equilibrium. We 
leave this case to be discussed further in the appendix.
Economic Profit versus Accounting Profit
If you’re thinking from an entrepreneur’s perspective, maybe the zero-profit implication of firm 
entry and exit makes you despair a little. After all, why even try to start a business if the end re-
sult will be profitless? As we discussed earlier, there is one important reason why you shouldn’t 
think this way: economic profits are not the same as accounting profits. As a business owner, 
when economic profits are zero, it simply means that you cannot earn more money if you take 
your talents to a different industry—you are being paid at least your opportunity cost of time.
Let’s think through the difference between accounting and economic profits with an 
example. On January 20, 2011, newspaper clippings in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, read:
Wisconsin Cheeseman Closing. Workers at the Wisconsin Cheeseman Company in Sun 
Prairie were told Thursday that the company is closing. Wisconsin Cheeseman President 
and CEO Dave Mack said the company is being restructured. He said 80 mostly full-time 
employees were put on notice Thursday that they could lose their jobs in two months.

Starting from left to right, this figure summarizes the dynamics of entry and exit that 
lead to the long-run supply curve being flat. The first two panels (a) and (b) have one

To some, this came as a surprise because they believed that The Wisconsin Cheeseman 
had been earning a profit. Why would a company earning a profit go out of business, many 
wondered. The answer lies in the definition of profit—even though The Cheeseman might 
have been earning positive accounting profits, economic profits might have been negative. 
For instance, assume that if The Cheeseman were not in its current line of business, its next 
best use for its management team and physical capital would be to set itself up as a ware-
house for fast-food storage for nearby Madison.
In fact, let’s go further and assume that The Cheeseman could increase its profits consider-
ably if it decided to shift from the cheese-packing industry to the fast-food storage business. In 
such a case, accounting profits of cheese packing might indeed be positive, whereas economic 
profits are negative. This is because the implicit costs of cheese ­packing—the opportunity cost 
of management time and plant—must be considered. Much like the cost of labor, this implicit 
cost is subtracted from revenues to produce the economist’s conception of profits.2
 
Evidence-Based Economics
A
t the beginning of this chapter, we posed a question concerning whether an etha-
nol subsidy would affect ethanol producers. The ethanol production industry is 
approximately perfectly competitive, so the tools of this chapter can help us un-
derstand this question. Later, in Chapter 10, we discuss taxes and subsidies more fully.
We can begin to shed light on this issue by exploring whether economic profits for 
the industry increase when subsidies are given. We have learned in this chapter that 
one sign of positive economic profits is firm entry. Thus, we can ask, how did the num-
ber of ethanol plants change when the U.S. government subsidized the ethanol indus-
try? ­Exhibit 6.19 plots the total number of ethanol plants in orange and the number 
of new plants under construction/expanding in blue. In 2006, every gallon of ethanol-
based fuel was effectively subsidized by $0.51 with a refundable tax credit, and when 
­President Bush announced in his 2006 State of the Union Address that ethanol plants 
would remain in favor, the number of ethanol plants under construction skyrocketed, as 
displayed in Exhibit 6.19. In 2009, the subsidy dropped to $0.45 cents per gallon and 
construction of new firms fell back considerably, to levels observed before 2006 (though 
the construction rates had been falling from 2007 to 2009).
Q: How would an ethanol subsidy affect ethanol producers?
A subsidy is a payment or tax 
break used as an incentive for an 
agent to complete an activity.

Evidence-Based Economics (Continued) 
Ultimately, the increase and decrease in ethanol plants in response to subsidies suggests 
that economic profits were driving entry and exit, but the ethanol industry was affected by 
many factors during this time period, making it difficult to pinpoint if the subsidies them-
selves caused the number of plant openings to change. For example, prices of corn—an 
important input to ethanol production—dipped to record lows in 2005. This by itself could 
lead to expansion of ethanol plants if investors believed corn prices would stay low. And 
macroeconomic conditions changed dramatically during 2008, so these impacts could in-
fluence plant construction and expansion.
One approach to provide further evidence into our question of interest is to construct an 
artificial market where everything is identical except the presence of the subsidy and then 
compare it to the market that receives the subsidy. In a lab experiment where students act 
as potential ethanol producers we did just that.3
Put yourself in the shoes of a subject who participated in this laboratory experiment. 
The experiment was set up to examine cases that included government subsidies for etha-
nol production and cases where ethanol subsidies were not available. In this experiment, 
each of 12 producers received the same cost curves and each producer made the entry 
decision in each of six periods (that is, they made the entry choice six times). If they enter, 
then their plant capacity is to produce 2 million gallons of ethanol and they are paid the dif-
ference between their revenues and their costs as their earnings. Panel (a) of Exhibit 6.20 
plots the marginal cost and average total cost curves for sellers in the no-subsidy treatment. 
The cost curves in the subsidy treatment are shown in panel (b) of Exhibit 6.20. Each firm 
in the subsidy treatment has a $0.25 lower cost of production for every gallon.
The experimental subjects are told that supply-and-demand conditions dictate that 
prices will be as displayed in Exhibit 6.21, which shows that if one seller enters the 
market, then there will be 2 million gallons produced and the price per gallon will be 
$1.40. In this case, for the subsidized seller, the profits are ($1.40 − $1.00) × 2 million  
((P − ATC) × quantity), or $800,000. For the nonsubsidized seller, the profits are  
($1.40 − $1.25) × 2 million ((P − ATC) × quantity), or $300,000.
Exhibit 6.20 Individual Cost Curves for Ethanol Producers (quantity in millions)
The exhibit plots the marginal cost and average total cost curve for ethanol 
producers under two different scenarios. Panel (a) illustrates when ethanol 
producers have no subsidy, and panel (b) shows when ethanol producers have

What do you think happened in each round of the no-subsidy and subsidy treatments? 
How would you choose if you were an experimental participant? Exhibit 6.22 provides a 
summary of the experimental results. Panel (a) in Exhibit 6.22 shows that in round 1 of the 
no-subsidy treatment, 11 of the 12 sellers entered the market. Thus, 22 ­million gallons of 
ethanol were produced and the equilibrium price was $0.90 per gallon. Therefore, every 
seller lost $0.35 per gallon (P − ATC, or $0.90 − $1.25). These losses caused 3 sellers to 
drop out of the market for round 2, leaving 8 sellers and a price of $1.05 per gallon. Still, in 
round 2 sellers are losing money. This cannot continue in equilibrium. Exhibit 6.22 shows 
that it does not: by the fourth round, the equilibrium number of sellers prevails—4 sellers 
enter, yielding a market price of $1.25 per gallon. This number continues for the remainder 
of the experiment. Ethanol prices converged to the point where price equaled the minimum 
ATC, yielding economic profits of zero for every subject.
Panel (b) of Exhibit 6.22 reveals the data for the subsidy treatment. In this case, 
too few sellers (5) enter the market in round 1. With only 5 sellers, a price of $1.20

Evidence-Based Economics (Continued) 
prevails. This means that every seller earns $0.20 per gallon produced (P − ATC, or 
$1.20 − $1.00). Profits cause other firms to enter, as can be seen in panel (b) of  
Exhibit 6.22. By the 6th round, the equilibrium number of 9 sellers enters the market, 
leading to a price of $1 per gallon. Again, price ends up equaling the minimum ATC. In 
this case, even though there is a subsidy, quantity increases to drive economic profits to 
zero, just as theory would predict.
This experiment confirms what we would expect from a competitive industry. Entry and 
exit stabilize to a zero-profit equilibrium in each case. That is, regardless of the presence 
of a subsidy, economic profits are driven to zero in the long run. As far as our opening 
question, what we have learned is that producers in perfectly competitive industries are in-
fluenced in the short run by subsidies, but firms in a competitive industry—like the ethanol 
­industry—should not pin their hopes on reaping positive economic profits in the long run 
because entry will drive long-run economic profits to zero.
Question
Answer
Data
Caveat
How would an ethanol 
subsidy affect ethanol 
producers?
It depends if we are considering 
the short run or the long run. 
The ethanol producer should 
understand that long-run 
economic profits will be zero  
in equilibrium.
Market data combined 
with a lab experiment.
It might be difficult to generalize 
results from the lab experiment. Also, 
during the time period we examined 
data from the ethanol industry many 
factors were changing at once, 
­making it difficult to establish cause 
and effect.
Summary
Sellers optimize by solving the seller’s problem, which dictates that 
decisions are made on the margin: expand production until marginal cost equals 
marginal revenue.
Short-run and long-run supply curves provide an indication of sellers’ 
willingness to sell at various price levels.
The difference between price and the marginal cost curve is producer surplus.
Free entry and exit cause long-run economic profits to equal zero in a 
perfectly competitive market.
With an understanding of decision-making rules from the seller’s problem 
and the forces of free entry and exit, we can not only better understand how to run 
our own business but also better predict how sellers will respond to incentives.

 7. You saw in Chapter 5 that economists often use arc elasticity 
when they calculate the price elasticity of demand. Similarly, 
they often use arc elasticity when they calculate the elasticity 
of supply. That is, they use the average of the new and the 
old quantity when they calculate the percentage change in 
quantity and the average of the new and the old price when 
they calculate the percentage change in price. Use the idea of 
an arc elasticity to calculate the price elasticity of supply in 
the following examples, then determine if supply is relatively 
elastic or inelastic, or perfectly elastic or inelastic.
	
a.	 When the price of a pen increased from $1.00 to 
$1.25, the quantity supplied by a firm increased from 
200 to 300 pens.

room. After taking one of the cars for a test drive, Harold de-
cides to buy it. While $11,000 was the least that Larry would 
have been willing to accept for that car, he quotes a price of 
$15,000. After some bargaining, the car is sold for $12,000.

Appendix  |  When Firms Have Different Cost Structures
Appendix
When Firms Have Different 
Cost Structures
We have thus far considered cases with many identical firms. However, this likely does 
not represent the makeup of industries that you generally imagine. Some firms have better 
technologies than others. Some firms have more experienced or savvy entrepreneurs than 
others. Some might have access to critical inputs, such as natural resources. For example, 
some farmers might have land more suitable to growing certain crops than others. All of 
these factors might lead firms to have different costs of production. What do supply curves 
look like in such industries? How does the equilibrium change?
It is important to note that our main lesson from above remains in this case: every firm 
expands production until MC = MR = P, unless shutdown or exit is optimal. And we con-
tinue to construct the market supply curve from the summation of individual firm supply 
curves. The main difference between the case of identical firms and the case where firms 
are different is that the equilibrium price in the latter equals the long-run average total cost 
of the last entrant. This has important implications because in this case some firms earn 
positive economic profits, even in the long run equilibrium.
To see why this is so, suppose that a new seed is developed that produces a wonderful 
new fruit. Market demand is enormous for this fruit, which can be grown across pasture-
lands in the United States. But the best growing conditions are gently rolling plots of land 
because laborers can more easily pick the fruit. In this case, we are able to rank farmers by 
their average total cost to produce a bushel of this new fruit based on their land type.
In this scenario, we would expect that farmers with the lowest average total cost would 
enter the market first and earn the greatest economic profits. After they enter, the next farm-
ers to enter the market have land that is not as well suited for growing the fruit. Therefore, 
those farmers will have a higher average total cost than the first set of market entrants. If we 
continue with this thought experiment, we find that the last farmer to enter the market will 
be the farmer with zero economic profits. This farmer is indifferent between entering the 
industry at the market price and not entering. Indeed, if the market price were to fall even 
a little, he would not wish to enter the industry.
To show how this works, consider Exhibit 6A.1. A rightward shift in the market ­demand 
curve leads to an increase in price, as panel (a) of Exhibit 6A.1. This increase in price causes 
firms to ­enter the industry, thereby shifting the supply curve rightward, as in panel (b)  
of the exhibit. These new entrants have higher costs than the existing firms, causing the 
equilibrium price to settle at the point where the last entrant has zero economic profits: 
price equals the minimum of his long-run average total cost. In this case, an upward-­
sloping long-run supply curve results, as in panel (b) of the exhibit. With an upward-
sloping long-run supply curve, the equilibrium price is above the average total cost for the 
farmers with the best plots of land (those with the lowest ATC). This allows these low-cost 
farmers to enjoy profits in the long run compared to the case of a horizontal long-run 
­supply curve. This result shows that in equilibrium, economic profits can be positive in the 
long run if sellers have different costs.
Exhibit 6A.2 recaps the basic results we obtain when we consider the implication of free 
entry and exit in a competitive market.

	
Appendix  |  When Firms Have Different Cost Structures
181
Exhibit 6A.1 Equilibrium When Firms Have Different Cost Structures
Panel (a) shows an increase in industry demand, so demand shifts right (­increases) 
from D1 to D2. The resulting increase in price from P1 to P2 means that firms are now 
realizing positive economic profits in this industry (P > ATC).
In response to this increase in economic profits, there is entry into the industry, 
which causes the industry supply to shift right (increase), as shown in panel (b).  
In response to entry, industry output increases, and the price in the market begins to 
fall from P2.
Entry will continue until the marginal firm (the last firm to enter the industry) earns 
zero economic profits, which occurs at the new price. But, since there is heteroge-
neity in firm costs, with the lowest cost producers being first in the market, entry 
subsides before price returns to its initial level, P1. Note that in panel (b), the final 
equilibrium price, P3 is greater than the initial equilibrium price in the market, P1.
Panel (c) combines the initial increase in market demand with the ­subsequent 
­market entry to illustrate both the initial equilibrium in the market (P1, Q1) and the 
final market equilibrium (P3, Q3). Again, since firms have different cost s­tructures, the 
zero profit condition holds when the marginal firm faces a price equal to its average 
total cost. The long-run supply curve for the market is simply the locus of long run 
market equilibria, and is upward-sloping.

Can markets composed 
of only self-interested 
people maximize the 
overall well-being 
of society?
In the previous two chapters we provided 
descriptions of the decision problems facing the 
main actors in any ­market: buyers and sellers. We 
found that when each of them ­follows certain rules of 
behavior, each will maximize his or her own well-being—a good thing because we all want 
to improve our lot in life. But when all of these self-interested people are put together in a 
competitive market, can ­anything but chaos result?
At first glance it does seem as if pandemonium reigns in many markets—bidding wars 
on eBay, stockbrokers frantically waving their arms as they try to buy or sell, buyers and 
sellers haggling over prices at flea markets. ­Obvious ­disarray. All of this chaos, it seems, is 
driven by market participants simply ­looking out for #1—themselves.

KEY IDEAS
The invisible hand efficiently allocates goods and services to buyers  
and sellers.
The invisible hand leads to efficient production within an industry.
The invisible hand allocates resources efficiently across industries.
Prices direct the invisible hand.
There are trade-offs between making the economic pie as big as 
possible and dividing the pieces equally.
Adam Smith, the father of economics, viewed the chaos quite differently. 
He conjectured that self-interest was a necessary ingredient for an economy 
to function efficiently. This view is put forth most elegantly in his treatise The 
Wealth of Nations (1776):
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we 
expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.1
This insight has become known as the power of the “invisible hand.” It is a 
forceful idea in economics because it suggests that when all of the ­assumptions 
of a perfectly competitive market are in place, the pursuit of individual self-­
interest promotes the well-being of society as a whole, almost as if the 
­individual is led by an invisible hand to do so.
In this chapter, we discuss the important implications of the invisible hand. 
We will show that when we impose the assumptions of perfect competition, 
the market system creates harmony between the interests of the individual 
and those of society. We will find that in such cases the free market is almost 
magical in that it allocates the production and final consumption of goods and 
services in a perfectly efficient manner. We will learn that the secret to how 
the market efficiently allocates scarce resources is by allowing prices to direct 
­buyers and sellers—regardless of whether we are discussing traders at the New 
York Stock Exchange, buyers and sellers in flea markets in Chattanooga, or 
people frequenting garage sales in Los Angeles. In this way, once we grasp the 
workings of the invisible hand, we better understand the world around us.
To begin, let’s consider more carefully the perfectly competitive markets discussed in 
­Chapters 4–6. For simplicity, let’s assume that our market is composed of only seven buyers 
and seven sellers who are price-takers. Each wants to buy or sell a used Apple iPod Nano 
5th Generation, in excellent condition. Because the iPods are all in similar condition, we can 
assume that they are identical. Madeline, Katie, Sean, Dave, Ian, Kim, and Ty are buyers in 
the market, and each of their reservation values (willingness-to-pay values) is contained in 
Exhibit 7.1. A reservation value is the price at which a person is indifferent between making 
the trade and not doing so. We learn from Exhibit 7.1 that Madeline is willing to pay $70 for 
an iPod, Katie $60, on down to Ty, who is willing to pay $10 for an iPod. Together, these data 
can be combined to form the market demand curve displayed in Exhibit 7.2.

Chapter 7  |  Perfect Competition and the Invisible Hand
7.1
Tom, Mary, Jeff, Phil, Adam, Matt, and Fiona are all sellers in the market, and each of 
their reservation values (willingness-to-sell values, or marginal costs) is also contained in 
Exhibit 7.1. From the exhibit, we learn that Tom is willing to sell his iPod for $10, Mary for 
$20, on up to Fiona, who will sell her iPod for no less than $70. Together, these values can 
be combined to make up the market supply curve displayed in Exhibit 7.2.
What is the equilibrium price in this case? The equilibrium price is determined by the 
intersection of the market demand and market supply curves. Exhibit 7.2 shows that this 
intersection yields a price of $40—which happens to be the 
price at which Dave is willing to buy an iPod and Phil is 
willing to sell his iPod.
What is the quantity traded at this equilibrium price of 
$40? Similar to equilibrium price determination, we com-
pute the equilibrium quantity level by again looking at 
the intersection of the market demand and market supply 
curves. On so doing, we find that the equilibrium quantity 
is four iPods. This follows because four people (Madeline, 
Katie, Sean, and Dave) are willing to pay at least $40 for 
an iPod, while four sellers (Tom, Mary, Jeff, and Phil) have 
reservation values less than or equal to $40. In this example, 
we assume that if a person is indifferent to trading, as Dave 
and Phil are at $40, they trade.
Social Surplus
An important outcome from buyers and sellers optimizing 
in perfectly competitive markets is that social surplus is 
maximized. Social surplus is the sum of consumer surplus 
and producer surplus, which we studied in Chapters 5 and 6. As we discussed in those two 
chapters, consumer surplus is the difference between the buyers’ reservation values and 
what the buyers actually pay, and producer surplus is the difference between the price and 
Exhibit 7.1 Reservation ­Values of Buyers 
and ­Sellers in the iPod Market
In the iPod market, we have seven buyers 
and seven sellers, each with their own res-
ervation values for an iPod. Together, the 
seven buyers make up the market demand 
for iPods and the seven sellers comprise the 
market supply for iPods.

Exhibit 7.2 Demand and

Market
When we plot the demand 
and supply schedules from 
Exhibit 7.1, we end up with 
stepwise curves ­because 
each individual only 
­demands or supplies one 
unit. The curves intersect 
at the equilibrium price 
of $40, and at that price, 
four iPods will be sold, 
­identifying the equilibrium 
quantity of iPods.

the sellers’ reservation values (marginal cost). So, social surplus represents the total value 
from trade in the market. For social surplus to be maximized, the highest-value buyers are 
making a purchase and the lowest-cost sellers are selling. In this way, buyers and sellers as 
distinct groups are doing as well as they possibly can—they’re optimizing.
To see why social surplus is maximized at the competitive market equilibrium, look at 
panels (a), (b), and (c) of Exhibit 7.3, which breaks down Exhibit 7.2 into simpler chunks. 
Notice that social surplus—the sum of the areas shaded blue and pink—is graphically given 
in all three panels by the area between the market demand and market supply curves from 
the origin to the quantity traded. Panel (b) shows the social surplus at the competitive mar-
ket equilibrium. We compute this surplus by summing the consumer and producer surplus 
of each market participant. For example, because Madeline is willing to pay $70 for an 
iPod, but actually pays only $40, her consumer surplus is $30. Likewise, because Tom is 
willing to sell his iPod for $10, but receives $40, his producer surplus is $30. By performing 
this computation for each of the people who trade, we learn that the social surplus adds up 
to $120, composed of $60 in consumer surplus and $60 in producer surplus.
To understand a little better why the competitive equilibrium maximizes social surplus, 
consider what would happen if we restricted the quantity sold in the market to be below the 
equilibrium quantity. Say we restrict the number of trades to two: that is, the two highest-
value consumers buy from the two lowest-cost sellers. That means Madeline and Katie 
buy and Tom and Mary sell. Regardless at what price the trade occurs, the result will be as 
depicted in panel (a) of Exhibit 7.3. In this situation, we find a lower total surplus compared 
to the competitive market equilibrium outcome: the market now achieves $100 in total sur-
plus (this can be found by taking the difference between the reservation values of Madeline 
and Katie ($130) and Tom and Mary ($30)). This figure is lower than the $120 of surplus 
achieved in the competitive equilibrium of panel (b).
What would happen if, instead, we expanded the trading opportunities and enforced trade 
of five iPods? That is, we have the five highest-value buyers purchasing from the five lowest-
cost sellers. Panel (c) of Exhibit 7.3 illustrates this case. With five sellers, we need to go all the 
way up the supply curve and include Adam, the fifth-lowest-cost seller. Likewise, we need to 
go all the way down the demand curve to Ian, the fifth-highest-value buyer. We now not only 
obtain the surplus in the competitive market equilibrium (when four trades are made, as in 
panel (b) of Exhibit 7.3) but we also obtain the yellow-shaded region in panel (c).

Exhibit 7.3 Maximizing Social Surplus
When a cap of two iPods is imposed, the situation is as depicted in panel (a). ­Social 
surplus is not maximized because Sean and Jeff do not make profitable trades. On 
the flip side, when a minimum of five iPods traded is ­imposed, as in panel (c), Adam 
and Ian now trade, even though the cost to the seller (Adam) is higher than the 
benefit to the buyer (Ian), leaving us worse off compared to the social optimum. 
Leaving the iPod market to act without outside direction, as in panel (b), generates 
the maximum amount of social surplus ­precisely because it does not leave out prof-
itable trades (as in (a)) or force unprofitable trades (as in (c)).

The yellow-shaded region in panel (c) represents losses from forcing a fifth trade. This 
is because the seller values the fifth item more than the buyer does. The loss in this case is 
equal to $20: $50 − $30, or Adam’s cost minus Ian’s benefit. This loss occurs because the 
marginal benefit of having Ian receive an iPod ($30) is less than the marginal cost of hav-
ing Adam give up his iPod ($50). Because marginal benefits are lower than marginal costs, 
our decision rules developed in earlier chapters suggest that this is not an optimal action to 
take. In this case, total surplus decreases from $120 in the competitive equilibrium to $100 
($120 − $20).
Pareto Efficiency
We now know that the competitive market equilibrium is efficient in the sense that all 
mutually advantageous trades take place: no more, no less. In this way, there are no unex-
ploited gains to trade. Accordingly, the competitive market equilibrium maximizes social 
surplus: this is the best that society as a whole can do if it is simply interested in maximiz-
ing the total size of the economic pie.
But in many situations we are also interested in who gets 
what—the allocation of surplus. One natural place to start is to 
ask: in the competitive market equilibrium, can we make any 
­individual better off without harming someone else? The answer 
is no. This concept is called Pareto efficiency, and is related to 
­social surplus. An outcome is Pareto efficient if no individual 
can be made better off without making someone else worse off. 
As it turns out, besides maximizing social surplus, the competi-
tive market equilibrium is also Pareto efficient.
So we can say that in a perfectly competitive market, the first 
distinct function of the equilibrium price is that it efficiently 
­allocates goods and services to buyers and sellers. The theory 
that purely self-interested individuals, without any specific direction, are led by the invis-
ible hand to maximize the total well-being of society—almost as if they were ordered to 
do so—represents one of the deepest insights within economics. Later in the chapter, we 
discuss the empirical evidence (recall that this is knowledge gained through direct observa-
tion and measurement) of whether this theoretical prediction has empirical support.
The competitive market ­equilibrium 
maximizes social surplus: this is 
the best that society as a whole 
can do if it is simply interested in 
­maximizing the total size of the 
­economic pie.
An outcome is Pareto efficient if 
no individual can be made better 
off without making someone else 
worse off.
While the invisible hand holds sharp results for individuals, by making use of concepts 
introduced in Chapter 6 it also has a considerably broader scope. Consider a firm that owns 
two manufacturing plants, each of which produces microchips to sell in a perfectly com-
petitive market. The two plants are quite different, with one being built in the late 1970s 
and the other in 2010. The older plant therefore has less advanced production technologies 
and higher production costs than the newer plant, as depicted in Exhibit 7.4. The exhibit 
shows that at each production level, the newer plant can produce microchips at a lower 
marginal cost than the older plant.
The firm has historically allowed each plant to operate independently, with both plant 
managers tasked with maximizing their own plant’s profits. If the price of microchips is $10, 
what quantity of microchips should each of the plant managers choose in order to maximize 
profits? An application of the seller’s decision rule that we learned in Chapter 6 is appropri-
ate: in the short run, if price is greater than average variable cost (P > AVC), then each plant 
should expand production until marginal cost equals price. Let’s assume that P > AVC.
Therefore, the manager of the older plant will expand production until the marginal cost 
equals price (or, MC = P = MR), because marginal revenue equals price in a perfectly com-
petitive market, as we learned in Chapter 6. This occurs at a quantity level of 20,000, as shown

in Exhibit 7.5. The manager of the new plant will make her optimization decision similarly 
and have her plant produce 50,000 units, as shown in Exhibit 7.6.
The total cost of production can be computed by multiplying the average total cost times 
the quantity (ATC × Q), as shown in the shaded region under the average total cost (ATC) 
Exhibit 7.4 Marginal Costs for Two 
Manufacturing Plants
The old manufacturing plant, with its 
less productive capital, faces a higher 
marginal cost to produce than the 
new plant. Represented graphically, 
this means that the old manufacturing 
plant’s marginal cost curve (pink) is 
higher than the new plant’s marginal 
cost curve (red) for any given quantity 
of production.

The old manufacturing plant will

the cost of producing that additional

at a quantity of 20,000 units. The total

resented by the shaded region. Recall 
that economic profits = Q(P − ATC) =

Just as in the case of the old manu-

plant takes the market price ($10) and 
produces at the point where marginal 
cost equals the market price. Given 
that the new plant faces a lower mar-
ginal cost than the old plant, we would 
expect that at the price of $10, the 
new plant would have a higher level 
of production, and this is precisely 
the case, as the new plant produces 
50,000 units. Note also that the new 
plant is earning economic profits be-
cause P > ATC. In this case, profits = 
50,000($10 − $7.5) = $125,000.

Exhibit 7.7 The Impact of Enforced Production Schedules
The CEO is dealt a crushing defeat – by imposing conditions on the two plants according 
to his intuitions, he has increased costs, wiped out economic profits, and introduced eco-
nomic losses of $875,000 (Profit = Q(P − ATC) = 70,000($10 − $22.50) = −$875,000).

curve in Exhibits 7.5 and 7.6. For the old plant, we see that this total cost is $10 × 20,000 =  
$200,000. For the new plant, we see that total cost is $7.50 × 50,000 = $375,000. While 
the old plant is earning zero economic profits (because P = ATC ), the new plant is earning 
an economic profit of 50,000($10 − $7.5) = $125,000.
At the annual shareholder’s meeting, both plant managers report important statistics 
to the new CEO, including production and cost figures. The CEO is devastated by these 
­figures, stressing that “given the differences in technologies and costs, I am astounded that 
the older plant is producing at all!” He assumes that it must be due to the “old boys” net-
work, further noting that “we cannot continue to keep old and inefficient plants open just 
because our friends work there.”
As his first edict, the new CEO announces that “it is time to move to the 21st century; 
we must immediately move all production to the new plant. This new plant will produce 
the entire 70,000 microchips (20,000 + 50,000) itself because of its better technologies; in 
this way, we will demonstrate to the world how our firm is moving progressively forward 
to make our shareholders better off.”
The plant managers try to explain to the CEO the errors in his economic reasoning—that 
he should be thinking on the margin—but the CEO is sure of his intuition on this one. The 
CEO’s directive is enforced and leads to the plants’ annual production changes, as shown 
in Exhibit 7.7. At the enforced levels of production, the total cost of production is given

by ATC × Q, or the shaded regions under the ATC curves in the exhibit. The CEO has 
achieved what he desired: the new plant is now producing all 70,000 microchips.
A year passes. At the next annual shareholder’s meeting, the new plant manager returns 
to report statistics once again to the CEO. The manager discloses that market demand and 
market supply conditions have yielded the same pricing environment as that of last year: 
$10 per microchip. The CEO views this as great news—he suspects that profits will rise 
handsomely because of his edict; he envisions people comparing him to Warren Buffet 
because of his sharp business acumen.
But he is crushed to learn that overall profits are down considerably from last year. 
Whereas the old production schedule brought $125,000 in economic profits, the new 
schedule erases those profits and replaces them with economic losses of $875,000 (and 
we have not even considered the fixed costs of the old plant!) The CEO, almost never at a 
loss for words, is speechless, only able to mutter words of amazement about how his plan 
could backfire so drastically. The plant manager, understanding the power of the invisible 
hand, shows the CEO Exhibit 7.8, which includes marginal costs and the CEO’s ­quantity 
restrictions. Panel (a) of Exhibit 7.8 shows the older plant’s marginal cost curve, and  
panel (b) shows the newer plant’s marginal cost curve.
The plant manager explains that under the CEO’s plan, the new plant produced the last 
microchip at a marginal cost of $30, as shown in panel (b) of the exhibit. This marginal 
cost is much greater than the $10 that it would have cost the older plant to make its first 
microchip, as displayed in panel (a) of the exhibit. In this way, if production of that one unit 
could have been shifted from the new plant to the older plant, overall costs would have been 
lowered by $20 = $30 − $10, enhancing overall profits by $20!
The CEO wonders just how far one can push this marginal reasoning. The plant manager 
shows him the arrows in Exhibit 7.8, which indicate that the same logic can be used until 
the marginal costs are equalized across plants, or at a point where MCOLD = MCNEW. The 
manager stresses that at this point, the overall production costs across the two plants will 
be minimized because they cannot profitably shift production any further.
In an inspired moment, the CEO notes that these optimal production numbers are 
­exactly the levels reached by the plants a year earlier, before the CEO intervened (MCOLD = 
MCNEW = Price = $10). He openly wonders how, in the pursuit of their own self-interest, 
the plant managers could organize production to minimize total costs, in turn optimizing 
profits for the firm. In his own roundabout way, the CEO has just stumbled across one of 
the most important insights described by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations, when not-
ing that the entrepreneur: “intends only his own gain. . .” but he is “led by an invisible hand 
to promote an end which was no part of his intention.”
The moral of the fable? Under the assumptions of a perfectly competitive market, 
­allowing the market to operate freely not only permits each plant manager to maximize his 
or her own plant’s profits by producing where MR = MC but in so doing the plants achieve 
7.2

7.3
something that neither plant manager set out to do: minimize total costs 
of production. This is true because MCOLD = MCNEW, which is a neces-
sary condition to minimize total costs across the producers.
Importantly, in so doing the plant managers also maximize the total 
profits of the two plants combined. In this sense, it is remarkable that 
market forces dictate that production across the two plants is allocated 
in a manner that is optimal for the social good: producing goods us-
ing the least amount of scarce resources. This is exactly what the CEO 
aimed to do, but failed. Yet when the competitive market is allowed to 
operate efficiently, we do not need a central planner (or a CEO) dictat-
ing goals for the betterment of society. Plant managers are willing to do 
that chore on their own, without even knowing it. So we can say that in a 
competitive market, the second distinct function of the equilibrium price 
is that it efficiently allocates the production of goods within an industry. Why? Because an 
optimizer expands production until MC = P; thus marginal costs are equalized across firms, 
because all firms face the same market price.
We just learned that the invisible hand optimally allocates scarce resources and arranges 
production patterns within an industry. But the economy is much more complicated than 
two plants in a small town. How can we determine if any specific industry is producing too 
much or too little? Let’s turn to a new example to explore if the invisible hand has power in 
allocating scarce resources across industries. To do so, we need to dig a level deeper into 
the lessons learned in Chapter 6.
As an illustration, consider a different perfectly competitive market—the delivery of 
paper products for publishing houses—with identical sellers making positive economic 
profits in the short run. This market situation is depicted in Exhibit 7.9. As you can see in 
the exhibit, at a price of $25 per ton, there are economic profits. But with economic profits, 
what happens?
Chapter 6 taught us that positive economic profits are a powerful force that attracts 
entrants. Other delivery companies want to enter because they, too, would like to earn eco-
nomic profits. We illustrate the effect of entry in panels (a) and (b) of Exhibit 7.10. Panel (a)  
shows that firm entry causes the market supply curve to shift rightward (from S1 to S2). 
This shift causes the equilibrium price to decrease (from $25 to $12) and the equilibrium 
quantity to increase (from 500 million to 620 million).

When does entry stop? As we learned in Chapter 6, entry stops when the market price 
decreases all the way down to where the marginal cost curve intersects the average total 
cost curve. In this example, the equilibrium price is $12 per ton, as shown in panel (b) of 
­Exhibit 7.10. This is because at any price higher than $12 per ton, other delivery firms 
would still like to enter because they can earn positive economic profits. Once price reaches 
the minimum of the ATC curve, we are in equilibrium because P = MC = ATC, which 
means that there is zero economic profit and therefore no reason for more firms to enter.
This example shows what happens when positive economic profits exist in an industry:  
resources flow to that industry because of the profits available. This behavior causes 
­resources to flow from less productive uses to more productive uses. That is, businesses 
seek to improve their profits, and in so doing they move resources into the production of 
goods and services that society values the highest.
What happens if the equilibrium price lies below the ATC curve? Consider a related 
­delivery business: the trucking market in the corn belt, where truckers haul corn from 
­farmers’ fields to grain mills for $10 per ton of corn. This market is currently in a situation 
where price is less than average total cost (P < ATC), as depicted in Exhibit 7.11. This means 
that truckers should exit because they are earning negative economic profits, or losses.
Exhibit 7.10 Firm Entry and Its Effect on the Market
As additional firms enter the paper delivery market, the supply curve shifts ­rightward, 
reducing the market price. Entry continues as long as economic profits exist (P > ATC). 
However, as soon as the economic profits go to zero, firms will no longer have an incen-
tive to enter the paper delivery business and firm entry will cease.

Where will these truckers go? One possibility is that the truckers will begin to ­deliver 
paper products for publishing houses. This, of course, is not necessary, as there are 
thousands of other jobs for truckers, but it is one distinct possibility. We demonstrate 
the effect of such a shift of truckers out of the grain trucking market in panel (a) of 
­Exhibit 7.12: the supply curve shifts leftward, increasing the equilibrium price (from $10 
to $12) and decreasing the equilibrium quantity (from 3200 to 3000 millions of tons of 
corn transported).
When does exit from hauling corn stop? Much as in the case of entry, truckers exit until 
the price rises to the minimum of the ATC curve, as shown in panel (b) of Exhibit 7.12. 
Again, once the market price reaches the minimum of the ATC, we are at the point of equi-
librium because P = MC = ATC, so there is no reason for further firm exit.
This simple example illustrates that the power of the invisible hand extends well 
­beyond individuals trading in markets and managers at microchip plants. What we have 
just learned is that competitive markets provide strong incentives for profit-seeking 
­entrepreneurs to shift their resources from unprofitable industries to profitable ones. This 
shifting of resources continues until exactly the right amount of production occurs in 
each industry.
Such shifting of resources leads to a very important outcome: in a perfectly competi-
tive market equilibrium, production occurs at the point of minimum ATC, as shown in 
­Exhibits 7.10 and 7.12. Because resources leave those industries in which price cannot 
cover their costs of production, and enter those industries where price can cover their 
costs of production, the total value of production is maximized in equilibrium. In this 
way, the market price is acting as an incentive for sellers to promote the greatest good for ­ 
society—move scarce resources to their highest possible use—even though sellers are 
solely attempting to maximize their own profits.
This reasoning leads to a third distinct function of equilibrium prices in a competitive 
market: they allocate scarce resources across industries in an optimal manner. This is 
because the industry equilibrium is where P = ATC = MC, and 
this happens only at the minimum point of the ATC curve. Viewed 
through this lens, entry and exit of firms is a good sign that the 
market is working, not a sign that something has run afoul.
Indeed, if we observe no entry and no exit, we should be wor-
ried that the free market is not functioning well: the carrot of 
economic profit and the stick of economic losses might not be 
serving their allocative purposes in this case.
Exhibit 7.12 Firm Exit and Its Effect on the Market
The grain trucking market currently faces economic losses, so firms will exit, reducing 
supply until the point where there are zero economic losses, which occurs where  
P = MC = ATC.

The fact that the market can do the world’s work without anyone being in charge might 
strike you as a scientific mystery as fascinating as the great challenges facing humankind 
today: What is the universe made of? What is the biological basis of consciousness? From 
the economic vantage point, you might wonder just how far we can crack open the mystery 
of the invisible hand.
What we know so far is that when the right conditions are in place—and we should 
stress that these conditions are quite strict—self-interest and the social interest are per-
fectly aligned. This is what led Adam Smith to comment that when markets are functioning 
well, those who are promoting their self-interest are also promoting the interests of society 
more broadly, as if led by an “invisible hand” to do so. This fundamental point teaches us 
that when markets align self-interest with social interest, we obtain very desirable results.
But what is it that leads agents to act in this manner? The short answer is that the incen-
tive is prices. Market prices act as the most important piece of information, leading the 
high-value buyers to buy and the low-cost sellers to sell. For example, prices adjust until 
the quantity demanded of oceanfront property equals the quantity supplied of oceanfront 
property. Likewise, prices force entrepreneurs to allocate the production of goods effi-
ciently, whether it is across firms in the same industry or across industries in the global 
economy. The flow of labor and physical capital to sectors with the highest rewards causes 
the production to be at just the right level in a competitive market equilibrium.
It seems almost unrealistic to believe that prices can be the sole organizer of thousands 
of markets that are linked in ways that we still do not begin to understand. No one has 
knowledge of all of the links between timber markets in Canada, corn markets in Iowa, 
fishing markets on Cape Cod, tea markets in China, and the tourism market in Costa Rica, 
but the fact that the pricing system can order behavior across such a vast array of markets, 
individuals, and groups, highlights the power of incentives within the market system.
Nobel Laureate Vernon Smith, a pioneer in the use of laboratory experimentation in 
economics, had this to say about prices:
How is it that the pricing system accomplishes the world’s work without anyone being in 
charge. . . . Smash it in the command economy and it rises as a Phoenix with a thousand 
heads. . . . No law and no police force can stop it, for the police become as large a part of 
the problem as of the solution. . . . The pricing system . . . is a scientific mystery . . . to 
understand it is to understand something about how the human species got from hunter-
gathering through the agricultural and industrial revolutions to a state of affluence.2
We can understand some of the workings of how price guides the invisible hand when 
considering a stark anecdotal example that one of the authors experienced when he lived in 
central Florida in the late 1990s. During that time, there was a flurry of hurricane warnings 
and activity. In each instance, goods such as sheets of plywood to board windows, bottled 
water and ice, and generators in case of power outages were in strong demand. As you now 
know, such a surge in demand shifts the demand curve rightward, increasing price.
To illustrate, consider the market for bottled water. What would happen if the de-
mand for bottled water in central Florida suddenly ­increased? This situation is depicted 
in ­Exhibit 7.13. At any given price level, more units are desired under the new demand 
curve (D2) than under the old ­demand curve (D1).
How would the invisible hand operate in this case? The increase 
in price would reverberate through the economy, incentivizing water 
distributors to make special trips to central Florida to fill the increased 
demand. Indeed, seeing trucks with out-of-state license plates unload-
ing bottled water was a common occurrence during such periods. The 
invisible hand guided these out-of-state truckers to meet demand by 
trucking water to Floridian consumers because they could make more 
profits than they otherwise would have earned in their other activities.
Local officials understandably complained of price gouging dur-
ing this time. In some cases, officials tried to force price to remain 
unchanged during times of hurricanes. Government restrictions on the 
price a firm can charge for a good or service is called a price control.

Exhibit 7.13 An Outward Shift of 
the Demand for Bottled Water
With a hurricane looming, demand 
for bottled water shifts out from D1  
to D2. In response, sellers increase 
their quantity supplied until the 
market achieves a new equilibrium, 
where D2 intersects S.
Price
Quantity

As we discussed in Chapter 4, if price controls are binding (that is, price is held below 
the equilibrium price), a shortage results: quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, as 
shown in Exhibit 7.14.
It is interesting to note that during hurricane season when price gouging was especially 
­criticized and sellers were more forcefully told to keep prices low, fewer truckers with out-
of-state license plates would arrive with fresh bottled water. This response makes sense 
within the model of the market system: if prices are not allowed to rise and reward market 
participants, suppliers’ response will not be as swift, if at all. This is because restricting the 
price to its old level does not give entrepreneurs an incentive to supply their product—in this 
case, water. If truckers did not service the market before the hurricane under the old prices, 
why would they now if they were interested solely in maximizing profits? The price control 
that the officials enforced eliminated the price incentive, ensuring that residents would have 
less drinking water than they otherwise would have had without such price controls.
By artificially limiting quantity, the price control creates another problem: how do we 
allocate the bottled water that is available (Q1 in Exhibit 7.14)? Free markets ration goods 
with prices—anyone who desires a bottle of water at the market price simply pays it and 
receives the water. The market is efficient because those who are willing to pay the most 
­receive the good. But when price controls are imposed the market is no longer free to 
­operate efficiently. In cases like this, long lines of people waiting to purchase the water is 
a typical outcome. This is not only frustrating but inefficient, because our time is valuable 
and the water does not always go to those who value it the most.
Deadweight Loss
Economists call the decrease in social surplus that results from a market distortion a 
­deadweight loss. The deadweight loss from a price control can be seen in Exhibit 7.15. 
Exhibit 7.14 Shortages: 
Quantity Demanded Exceeds

equilibrium price, suppliers have

Panel (a) of Exhibit 7.15 shows the social surplus if the market is 
allowed to operate freely: quantity traded is Q2 at an equilibrium 
price of P2. Consumer surplus is Triangle A and producer surplus 
is Triangle B. Thus, social surplus is Triangle A + Triangle B.
Panel (b) shows how restricting the price to P1 affects the mar-
ket. The price control prevents buyers and sellers from realizing 
all of the gains to trade. With the price control in place, consumers 
pay a price of P1 per bottle of water and they consume Q1 bottles. 
Consumer surplus is now area C and producer surplus is triangle E. By keeping price arti-
ficially low, the government helps consumers (area C in panel (b) is larger than triangle A 
in Panel (a)) but hurts producers (the area of triangle B in panel (a) is larger than the area in 
triangle E in panel (b)). Overall, there is lost surplus because of this imposition. The loss in 
surplus is triangle D in Panel (b). This area is called the deadweight loss from the price con-
trol. It becomes a normative question whether you are comfortable making this trade-off.
In sum, binding price controls have three effects: (1) they lower social surplus, because 
the number of trades decreases compared to a free market; (2) they redistribute surplus 
from one side of the market to the other. In the case of a price ceiling, as shown here and 
discussed in Chapter 4, the surplus is transferred from producers to consumers; and (3) for 
the people who benefit, there is a reallocation of surplus, which occurs through non-price 
mechanisms. In our example of price controls, those consumers who are willing to wait the 
longest, are the most connected, or simply those who are the strongest, receive the good. 
As a result, some consumers benefit, while others are made worse off.
You will note that this situation is very similar to what occurred in our iPod example 
above. When we restricted the quantity traded to two iPods, we found a lower total surplus 
compared to the competitive market equilibrium outcome. Going back to Exhibit 7.3, we 
can see that the deadweight loss of restricting trade in the iPod example was $20: the sur-
plus of the trade between Sean and Jeff. In Chapter 10 we discuss at much greater length 
how taxes lead to deadweight loss.
The Command Economy
To understand the difficulty of what the invisible hand accomplishes, it is instructive to 
consider cases where countries have attempted to place strong controls on the economy, in 
effect trying to do the job of the invisible hand. One example of the dramatic differences 
The decrease in social surplus that 
results from a market distortion  
is a deadweight loss.
Exhibit 7.15 Deadweight Loss from Price Controls
Panel (a) shows a free market. Equilibrium price (P2) and quantity (Q2) leads to 
­consumers receiving triangle A and producers receiving triangle B. Social surplus is 
maximized. In Panel (b), there is a price control in place: price is restricted to be ­below 
the equilibrium price. A deadweight loss equal to area D results. Now consumer 
­surplus is area C and producer surplus is area E. Social surplus has decreased by the 
­deadweight loss because of the price control.

In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in the summer of 2005, 
much of the Gulf Coast had been pummeled by wind and 
inches upon inches of rain. Water was everywhere, but of-
ten undrinkable. Basic provisions we take for granted, like 
drinking water, weren’t easy to come by and the ­Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was caught 
flat-footed.
In response to catastrophic events like a hurricane or an 
earthquake, the caricature of private industry is that firms 
will gouge customers. And sometimes this is true, but in 
response to Katrina, there was one unlikely hero: Walmart. 
In fact, the Mayor of Kenner, a suburb of New Orleans, 
had this to say about Walmart’s response: “. . . the only 
lifeline in Kenner was the Walmart stores. We didn’t have 
looting on a mass scale because Walmart showed up with 
food and water so our people could survive.”
Indeed, in the three weeks after Katrina, Walmart 
shipped almost 2,500 truckloads of supplies to storm-
damaged areas. These truckloads reached affected areas 
before FEMA, whose troubles responding to the storm 
were so great that it shipped 30,000 pounds of ice to 
Maine instead of Mississippi. These stories and more 
are in Horwitz (2009), which summarizes the divergent 
­responses to Katrina by private industry and FEMA.
How was Walmart so effective in its response? Well, it 
maintains a hurricane response center of its own that ­rivals 
FEMA’s, and prior to the storm’s landfall it ­anticipated a 
need for generators, water, and food, so it effectively 
diverted supplies to the area. Walmart’s emergency re-
sponse center was in full swing as the storm ­approached 
with 50  ­employees managing the response from 
headquarters.
This sounds like the sort of response FEMA should have 
produced; so if that’s the job of FEMA, why did Walmart 
respond so heroically? Simple economics. Walmart un-
derstood that there would be an important shift of the 
demand curve for water, generators, and ice in response 
to the storm and the textbook response to such shifts is 
an increase in quantity supplied. Lucky for us, few are 
better at shipping provisions around the country than 
Walmart.
Walmart enjoys one other advantage over FEMA. The 
company knows the market for provisions. Every day, 
Walmart must consider the demands of its millions of 
consumers and supply products that maximize its ­profits. 
FEMA, on the other hand, faces no such incentives, so 
when it is suddenly tasked with responding to a devas-
tating storm like Katrina, FEMA will be trying to intuit 
what people need and by the time they’re ready to act, 
a private firm like Walmart will have already solved the 
shortage.3

that can result is the case of Korea. After World War II in 1945, the Soviet Union and the 
United States agreed on the surrender and disarming of Japanese troops in Korea. The 
­Soviet Union accepted the surrender of Japanese weaponry north of the 38th parallel, and 
the United States accepted the surrender south of the 38th parallel. Both countries estab-
lished governments and market systems sympathetic to their own ideologies, leading to 
Korea’s current division into two political entities: North Korea and South Korea.
The economic system implemented by the Soviet Union in North Korea remains today 
as one of the few remaining command economies, where a centralized authority deter-
mines the goods and services produced. With the aid of the United States, South Korea 
established a market economy based upon price signals and strong economic incentives. 
The market economy in South Korea remains vibrant today. This situation is, in effect, a 
unique natural experiment that permits an exploration of what happens to two similar areas 
when we impose a command economy in one and a market economy in the other.
Let’s look at the two economies a little more closely. One place to start is the market 
value of final goods and services produced in each country in a given period of time, or what 
economists call the gross domestic product (GDP). Exhibit 7.16 shows the real per capita 
GDP in North Korea and South Korea from 1950 to 2008. The differences are dramatic. 
For North Korea, per capita GDP grew from $850 to only $1,133 over this time period. 
Alternatively, for South Korea, per capita GDP grew from roughly $850 to $18,356. To put 
these differences into perspective, consider that very poor countries such as the ­Sudan and 
Nicaragua have per capita GDP of approximately $1,015, very close to North Korea’s level. 
In fact, today the wealth of Bill Gates exceeds the annual GDP of North Korea.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is 
the market value of final goods and 
services produced in a country in a 
given period of time.

Exhibit 7.17 highlights other differences between North and South Korea measured in 
recent years. The exhibit shows the dramatic differences in imports, exports, outputs in 
agricultural and manufacturing areas, and the level of services available. Interestingly, the 
statistics point to the fact that under a command system, North Korea has had a very dif-
ficult time developing beyond an agricultural economy.
Perhaps the most vivid image of the differences between North and South Korea is 
­Exhibit 7.18. This amazing image was made in December of 2000 by a U.S. satellite taking 
shots of regions of the world at night. In a news briefing on December 23, 2002, Defense 
Secretary Donald Rumsfield commented: “If you look at a picture from the sky of the Korean 
Peninsula at night, South Korea is filled with lights and energy and vitality and a booming 
economy; North Korea is dark.” While the most vibrant area is the capital city of South Korea, 
Seoul, even outside of Seoul several locations within South Korea dwarf the lighted develop-
ments of the sharpest blip in North Korea, which occurs in the capital city, Pyongyang.
The Central Planner
Why is it difficult for command economies to operate effectively and experience signifi-
cant, sustained GDP growth? Let’s take an extreme case by putting yourself in the shoes 
of a central planner. Pretend that you are in charge of the U.S. economy with the goal of 
maximizing the well-being of your citizens and that you have a command economy, not a 
free-market economy, on your hands. What would you do? How would you coordinate the 
millions of individual consumers, businesses, resource suppliers, and sellers? How would

you make sure that the tractor manufacturing plant in Racine, Wisconsin, had the necessary 
steel, rubber, glass, and other critical inputs to produce tractors? How many cars should the 
Chrysler plant in Belvidere, Illinois, produce? Should the last bit of copper from mines in 
Utah be used to produce electrical wires or pots and pans? What about the natural gas that 
flows from the fields of Texas; should those cubic meters be used to warm homes in Boston 
or in Denver? Or should they be used to power the chemical plants in Biloxi, Mississippi?
After considering these queries, you likely have begun to more fully appreciate the 
linkages between industries. If the silica sand mines do not produce enough silica, glass 
manufacturing plants will be unable to meet their production goals. This shortage of glass 
will result in a lower quantity of glass for goods such as lights, mirrors, countertops, LCDs, 
and windshields for cars. If windshields are not provided to the Chrysler plant in Belvidere, 
Illinois, in a timely manner, workers will experience significant down time, leading in turn 
to Chrysler not meeting its production goals. The chain reaction will continue as fewer 
cars move off the line and fewer cars are shipped via rail and over the road, resulting in 
the shipping companies not meeting their shipping goals. Automobile dealerships subse-
quently will receive fewer cars to sell, thereby lowering the number of new cars sold and 
the commissions of car dealers. This lowering of income will in turn cause car dealers to 
take fewer vacations to sandy beaches, which sets off its own chain reaction in the tourism 
industry. And on and on in a great game of dominoes!
As you can see, the coordination problem of bringing agents together to trade is a dif-
ficult one for central planners. And after you have solved the coordination problem, you 
need to think about how to tackle the incentive problem: that is, aligning the interests of 
the agents. In market economies, prices—not central planners—incentivize producers, and 
the bottom line of profits is what determines success for entrepreneurs.
But in planned economies, rewards are based on meeting quantity targets. Consider the 
plant manager who is dispatched to produce wood boards for backyard decks. If he is told the 
target is based on weight, he produces only very long, wide, bulky boards, because he wants 
to maximize weight and is unresponsive to shipping costs or consumer desires. If he is told the 
target is based on quantity, he produces only very short, narrow, and thin boards. He doesn’t 
much care if they fall apart when a consumer stands on them while barbequing, because the 
manager is not rewarded for quality. Stories such as these abound from planned economies.
Difficulties like these suggest that the reason for the fall of most planned systems  
(Cuba and North Korea represent the last bastions of command economies) is that the 
central planner does not fully understand consumer wants and needs and the production 
capabilities of every sector of the economy, and it is difficult to incentivize workers if 
prices are not utilized. Because any individual knows only a small fraction of all that is 
known collectively, it is impossible to replicate the work of the invisible hand. This truth is 
captured in Nobel Laureate Friedrich Hayek’s words:
The marvel is that in a case like that of a scarcity of one raw material, without an order being 
issued, without more than perhaps a handful of people knowing the cause, tens of thousands 
of people whose identity could not be ascertained by months of investigation, are made to use 
the material or its products more sparingly; that is, they move in the right direction.4
When the interests of economic 
agents coincide, a coordination 
problem of bringing the agents 
together to trade arises.
When the optimizing actions of two 
economic agents are not aligned, 
these agents face an incentive 
problem.

“Attention, Kmart Shoppers! Attention, Kmart Shop-
pers! Handbag sale on aisle 3, 50% off; handbag sale on 
aisle 3, 50% off. Get there fast before they are all gone.”
If you have ever frequented Kmart, you surely have 
heard an announcement like this. You likely remember the 
flashing blue light, and the accompanying flock of shop-
pers rushing to the celebrated aisle to fight over the swag.
The Blue Light Special began in 1965 in a local Indiana 
Kmart. The clever store manager made good use of a 
police car light to draw attention to items that were lan-
guishing in the store. Sam Walton, founder of Walmart, 
has lauded the idea as one of the greatest sales promo-
tion ideas ever.
What few people know is that behind this brilliance 
is a command system that surely limits its profitabil-
ity. In the early days of the Blue Light Specials, Kmarts 
were allowed to choose goods to be discounted, tak-
ing advantage of local knowledge and weather-related 
conditions.
Nowadays, rather than permitting each store to choose 
the goods to be discounted, all goods sold on Blue Light 
Specials are dictated from the corporate office in ­Hoffman 
Estates, Illinois, months in advance. Moreover, every day 
exactly the same goods are sold on Blue Light Specials, 
regardless of whether the store is located in Laramie, 
­Wyoming, or Washington, D.C.
Much as the central planner loses the benefits of 
­observing unfettered market prices when she directs 
production decisions, Kmart has lost the ability over the 
years to take advan-
tage of the decentral-
ized knowledge of its 
store managers.
Clearly, 
when 
a 
­December 
winter 
storm hits Laramie, the 
local Kmart should 
not be bound to de-
cisions made thou-
sands of miles away 
the 
previous 
July. 
­Local market condi-
tions dictate a differ-
ent mix of products 
to be offered.
Likewise, when a torrid summer dry spell hits Washington,  
D.C. and a rainy spell hits Seattle, ­Washington, why 
should the Blue Light Specials at D.C. Kmarts be ex-
actly the same as the Blue Light Specials at Kmarts in 
Seattle?
It is important to remember that the beauty of the 
invisible hand does not merely lie in the operation of 
traditional markets that we frequent. It manifests itself 
everywhere—within friendships, families, communities, 
firms, and countries. In the case of Kmart, it would be bet-
ter if the decision maker was not a central planner but the 
invisible hand ­itself, which is an allocation device difficult 
to replicate.5

Command and Control at Kmart
A market economy has features that are remarkable at providing price signals that guide 
resources in a way that maximizes social surplus and makes the economy efficient. Market 
forces act to eliminate waste—guiding resources to their correct destination—and provide 
incentives for all market participants to promote their own interests, which in turn promote 
the broader interests of society. In this way, maximizing efficiency directs us toward mak-
ing the societal pie as large as possible.
But it is important to recognize that the standard of maximizing social surplus is just 
one way to measure the progress of an economy. Another consideration is how the pie 
is allocated. For example, many citizens might believe that every person should have 
proper access to food, housing, and basic healthcare. Pushing this notion even further, a 
social planner might also be concerned with equity. Equity is concerned with how the 
pie is allocated to the various economic agents. To some, equity means an even distribu-
tion of goods across society. Several important questions arise concerning equity and 
efficiency.
Should we help the homeless man on the corner, or assist an unemployed worker? What 
about starving children in Africa? They have virtually no income, implying that they are 
excluded from almost every market because their willingness to pay is not high enough to 
buy many goods. In fact, they cannot afford even the most basic necessities at the market 
price. Just because the competitive market equilibrium maximizes social surplus, and is 
efficient, does not mean that the resulting distribution is morally satisfactory.

Several important questions arise concerning equity and efficiency. 
These are questions within the domain of normative economics, and 
are often debated by policymakers and economists. In a perfectly com-
petitive equilibrium, we know that Pareto efficiency holds. This means 
that it is not possible to make a starving African child better off without 
making someone else worse off. Thus, it is possible that in order to 
increase the well-being of a starving child, it will be necessary to take 
a few hundred dollars from other people.
Of course, such redistribution of wealth is important to modern 
societies, and we’ll see in later chapters that governments and private 
charities intervene in the functions of the market for this very reason. ­ 
We will find that this kind of intervention presents an important trade-off 
between efficiency and equity, and that as a society we continually have 
choices over efficiency and equity. This is one major purpose of taxa-
tion. We will learn in later chapters that a host of interesting questions 
arise when we consider taxation and government’s role in the economy.
 
Evidence-Based Economics
T
he discussion in this chapter may have piqued your interest about the workings of 
the invisible hand. But, it may have left you longing for more concrete demonstra-
tions of whether the theory is actually descriptive of reality. In particular, you may be 
thinking that although we conceptually showed various features of the competitive market 
equilibrium, we never presented any empirical evidence suggesting that any of it is actually 
true in practice—or at least approximately true.
To do so is difficult, however, because much like the central planner in planned econo-
mies, we do not observe market demand and market supply curves, so we cannot test 
whether prices and quantities are tending toward their equilibrium values. How could we 
ever go beyond the conceptual arguments of this chapter and show some real empirical 
evidence that the invisible hand does, in fact, operate as economists believe?
To show how economists have tackled this thorny question, let’s narrow it down and put you 
in the shoes of a trader on the New York Stock Exchange via a small experiment. Say you walk 
into your economics classroom and find on the desk in front of you a note card that tells you 
two things: whether you are a buyer or a seller, and your reservation value. That is, for buyers, 
the value on the card represents the highest price that they will pay (reservation value), and for 
sellers, the value on the card represents the lowest price that they will accept (again, a reserva-
tion value but from the opposite point of view). So, for example, referring back to the scenario 
at the beginning of this chapter, we would see that Madeline’s card would specify “$70: Buyer” 
and Adam’s card would specify “$50: Seller.”
You are then informed that if you are a buyer, you can buy one unit per period, and if you 
are a seller, you can sell one unit per period. There will be 5 periods in the experiment. Your 
earnings will be determined as follows: for both buyers and sellers, the difference between 
the trade price and the reservation price will determine market earnings. Thus, for instance, 
if you are a buyer with a reservation value of $25 and you manage to buy a unit at $20, your 
market earnings are $5. You might recall that we call this consumer surplus. Likewise, if 
you are a seller with a reservation value of $5 and you manage to sell a unit at $20, then 
you’ve earned $15 of producer surplus. After completion of each trade, the exchange price 
is announced so that all buyers and sellers are made aware of the most recent transaction.
Each market period lasts 10 minutes. During the market period, buyers should raise their 
hand to make public offers, which the monitor for the experiment will write on the board.

Sellers should do the same. The prices that the buyers submit are called bid prices in Wall 
Street lingo, and the prices that sellers submit are called ask prices. The basic idea is that 
buyers want to buy from the sellers with the lowest ask prices, and sellers want to sell to 
the buyers with the highest bid prices. Once a sale has been cleared, the bids and asks are 
removed and a new set of bids and asks can be submitted. This simple arrangement has 
similarities to how trading actually works on the New York Stock Exchange—bids and asks 
are yelled out and if they match, a trade is executed.
We are now ready to begin the experiment.
The bell rings to start Trading Period 1, and very quickly, bid prices and ask prices come 
in. A buyer to your right yells out “Bid $10!” The experimenter writes down this bid on a 
whiteboard. Other buyers behind you follow suit, raising the $10 bid successfully. At the 
same time, sellers submit their asks, each narrowly beating the last so they can have the 
business of the highest buyer. You yell out “buy $20!” and a seller takes your offer. Having 
a reservation price of $25, you feel good because you just netted $5 in Trading Period 1. 
You can now rest on your laurels until Trading Period 2 begins.
Double Oral Auction
This type of experiment has come to be known as a double oral auction and was first ex-
perimentally studied by Vernon Smith. In a double oral auction, both bids and asks are 
orally stated, just as we have in this experiment. In his study of such auctions, Smith found 
re-assuring results. He tested many different market variants, varying the elasticity of sup-
ply and demand and the numbers of buyers and sellers. In spite of all of these changes, the 
markets still approached equilibrium price and quantity with great accuracy.
Exhibit 7.19 shows one example. Panel (a) of the exhibit shows the supply and demand 
curves for participants in Smith’s double oral auction experiments with quantity on the

In panel (a), we see the 
supply and demand 
curves that describe 
the double-oral auction 
market. The intersec-
tion of the supply and 
demand curves identi-
fies the equilibrium price 
and quantity. Although 
these equilibrium values 
are theoretical predic-
tions, they are borne out 
in the real-life activities of 
Smith’s buyers and sellers, 
as the equilibrium price 
approaches the predicted 
value in panel (b).

Evidence-Based Economics (Continued) 
x-axis and price on the y-axis. The supply and demand curves are just the summation of 
each buyer’s or seller’s reservation values, which have been given to them at the begin-
ning of the experiment—just like the example in Exhibit 7.2. Panel (b) of Exhibit 7.19 
shows the price of each completed transaction in each period plotted in the order that each 
transaction occurred. That is, the x-axis is the transaction number and the y-axis is the 
price paid, with the horizontal dotted line representing the equilibrium price predicted by 
the supply and demand curves in panel (a). Initially, the market price is below the market 
equilibrium, but by the third trading period, the price is very close to the equilibrium 
prediction.
From the perspective of markets like the New York Stock Exchange, Smith’s double 
oral auction results are a triumph for the incredible workings of the invisible hand. Smith’s 
results show the power of our theory, in that the equilibrium price is very close to where 
the supply and demand curves intersect. Digging deeper into these and ­related data, we find 
that the high-value buyers buy, the low-cost sellers sell, and no one else executes a trade.
You might be thinking that yes, this is a swift example, but it’s a far cry from the markets 
that you typically frequent. That is, how often do you encounter markets that resemble the 
conditions of a double oral auction? Unless you have worked as a trader on Wall Street, 
your answer is probably “never.” If you consider the sorts of markets in which you have 
participated, you are probably much more likely to have frequented the local grocery store 
where prices are on price tags, or even a market where you can haggle with sellers, such as 
a used-car lot or an open-air market.
Bilateral Negotiations
If we allowed buyers and sellers to mingle with one another and negotiate privately to buy 
and sell goods, would the results be as promising as what Smith found in his double oral 
auctions? This is exactly the question that one of the authors (List) addressed, when he 
completed several field experiments across many different types of open-air markets: from 
sports card conventions where experts traded sports cards, to Disney World where kids and 
adults traded pins. Like Smith, List gave buyers and sellers reservation values and recorded 
prices publicly after transactions. Unlike Smith, List had actual buyers and sellers engaging 
in bilateral negotiations—in which a single buyer and a single seller confront each other 
with bids and asks—rather than yelling out the offers to the group.
A bilateral negotiation is a market 
mechanism in which a single 
seller and a single buyer privately 
negotiate with bids and asks.

The invisible hand is much stronger 
than many first assumed.
Question
Answer
Data
Caveat
Can markets composed  
of only self-interested  
people maximize the  
overall well-being of 
society?
Yes.
Lab and field  
experiments.
Experiments explore whether 
the high-value ­buyers buy, 
whether the ­low-cost sellers 
sell, and whether the correct 
number of trades occurs. 
Data are not gathered across 
firms in an industry or across 
­industries. Therefore, we only 
show the first of the three 
basic ­results of a perfectly 
competitive equilibrium.
Across a myriad of settings—using a range of different trader types, market demand and 
market supply curves, and different numbers of buyers and sellers—List found a strong 
tendency for prices to approach the competitive equilibrium. The result even held for 
young children! One example from List’s study is given in Exhibit 7.20. The exhibit shows 
the price of each transaction on the y-axis, and each transaction is represented sequentially 
on the x-axis. These data indicate that the market converges to the intersection of supply 
and demand (which is represented here as a price between the two dotted lines, one at $13 
and one at $14).
An implication of this research is that even in decen-
tralized real-world markets, prices and quantities converge 
to where demand meets supply. In fact, even with a small 
number of buyers and sellers—as few as six of each—List 
found that price and quantity converged to the intersection of 
demand and supply. In this way, the invisible hand is much 
stronger than many first assumed, as these markets often 
come close to full efficiency: social surplus is nearly maximized in many of the markets. 
And the question that we posed at the beginning of this chapter—can markets composed 
of only self-interested people maximize the overall well-being of society?—is answered in 
the affirmative.
If you stopped reading this book at this point, you would be a rabid free-market 
­proponent. This is because the beauty of the economic system is unparalleled. Yet, there 
are important instances that frustrate the workings of the invisible hand. For example, when 
a firm produces, it might pollute the air or water, causing harm to people. Likewise, if a 
firm is not a price-taker, but has the power to set prices, the firm might be able to cause a 
reallocation of resources toward itself and social surplus might not be maximized.
We explore how these, and other, realistic situations frustrate the invisible hand’s work-
ings in the coming chapters. Such examples lead us to consider the appropriate mix be-
tween free markets and government intervention. We will learn that all successful modern 
economies have a mix of government and free markets.

Chapter 7  |  Perfect Competition and the Invisible Hand
Summary
When the strong assumptions of a perfectly competitive market are in place, 
markets align the interests of self-interested agents and society as a whole. In 
this way, the market harmonizes individuals and society so that in their pursuit 
of individual gain, self-interested people promote the well-being of society as a 
whole.
The remarkable tendency of individual self-interest to promote the well-
being of society as a whole is all orchestrated by the invisible hand.
The invisible hand efficiently allocates goods and services to buyers and 
sellers, leads to efficient production within an industry, and allocates resources 
efficiently across industries.
The invisible hand is guided by prices. Prices incentivize buyers and sellers, 
who in turn maximize social surplus—the sum of consumer surplus and producer 
surplus—by simply looking out for themselves.
We can measure the progress of an economy by measuring social surplus—
how big the societal pie is. But we can also measure progress by considering 
questions of equity—how the pie is distributed across agents.

	 2.	 Suppose the market for live lobsters is perfectly competi-
tive. The fishermen have to sell the lobsters soon after 
they are caught while they are still alive. Assume that no 
one buys dead lobsters from the fishermen, and therefore, 
the price of dead lobsters is zero. Explain the price elas-
ticity of supply for live lobsters at the daily market.

higher for each kilogram of live lobsters, and 2,800 ki-
lograms of live lobsters are traded at the price of $20 per 
kilogram every day. Calculate the consumer surplus, pro-
ducer surplus, and social surplus.

food items, such as wheat, rice, oil, eggs, chicken, sugar, 
and cooking oil, from the food ration stores at prices that 
are even lower than the production costs. Carribeans can 
also buy food products at the market, where the prices are 
determined by demand and supply and are much higher 
than those at the food ration stores. Evaluate the food ra-
tion system and the free market for food in Carribea from 
the perspectives of efficiency and equity.

As protesters cover their faces for protection from the fumes of the 
fire and tear gas ­released by Seattle police, hundreds of World Trade 
­Organization (WTO) delegates are stranded, ­unable to pass through 
the blockade of 40,000 people at the WTO Ministerial ­Conference 
of 1999. This free trade protest, sometimes called “the Battle of 
­Seattle,” was not an uncommon event, as its ­predecessor—the 
­worldwide “Carnival Against Capitalism”—garnered a similar number 
of demonstrators.
Faced with such passionate opposition to free trade, you may be 
surprised to learn the major lesson of this chapter: free trade ­always 
benefits both ­trading partners and therefore ­represents the key 
­reason why we observe so much interdependence in the world. If this 
is true, what has upset these protesters? Are they being irrational? 
Would a brief course in ­economics have prevented 40,000 people 
from blockading the streets of Seattle?
In fact, we will see that there is nothing irrational in the 
­protesters’ stance and that they likely will not be comforted by

even the best course in economics. This follows from the ­second lesson of the 
­chapter: within any trading country, some individuals may be made worse off by 
trade. The losses potentially arise from reduced consumer or producer ­surplus, 
lost jobs, or lower wages. But importantly, we will learn that the gains from 
trade reaped by the ­winners more than compensate for the losses of the losers. 
The key is to develop policies so that ­everyone can reap the gains from trade.

	
Section 8.1  |  The Production Possibilities Curve
209
Take a look at your tennis shoes. Where were they made? We’d guess in China, the world’s 
largest shoe exporter. Do you own a Wii? It’s manufactured in Japan, one of the major 
­exporters of consumer electronics. What about your haircut? We suspect that you did not 
trim those bangs yourself. Why do so many people and countries rely on others for goods 
and services? What are the gains to such interdependence?
The underlying motivation for trade, whether it occurs between a barber and a butcher 
or between the United States and China, relies on one simple principle: we can all be ­better 
off by trading with one another because trade allows total production to be maximized.  
To see how, we begin with an example that might hit close to home.
In an effort to make some spare cash, you take on a freelance weekend job creating 
Web sites and computer programs to run on each Web site. Your first job is to create  
240 Web sites and produce 240 specific computer programs to run applications on each 
Web site. Because each Web site and computer program is unique, you must start from 
scratch to produce each one. You now have to figure out how to complete these tasks. 
­Taking an economic approach, you recognize that your new job resembles, in a sense, a 
two-good economy (Web sites and programs), and you want to figure out how much you 
can accomplish—your production possibilities—in an 8-hour day.
After some experimentation, you gather enough data to create Exhibit 8.1. The exhibit 
shows output levels for various amounts of time for each of the two tasks. For instance, if 
The Production Possibilities Curve
8.1 
Key Ideas
The production possibilities curve tells us how much we can produce 
from existing resources and technology.
The basis for trade is comparative advantage.
Specialization is based on comparative, not absolute, advantage.
There are winners and losers within trading states and countries.
The winners from trade can more than compensate the losers.
Important arguments against free trade exist.
Exhibit 8.1 Your Production 
Schedule
The exhibit shows how the 
time you spend maps into the 
number of Web sites and com-
puter programs. For example, 
you could spend 6 hours 
­producing Web sites and  
2 hours producing computer 
programs. In this case you 
would produce 6 Web sites 
and 4 computer programs.

you work an entire 8-hour day creating computer programs, you are able to produce 16. 
Alternatively, if you focus your entire work day on designing Web sites, you can create 8. 
Spending a little time on each task yields intermediate production levels.
A simple way to plot these data is with a production possibilities curve (PPC), which 
shows the relationship between the maximum production of one good for a given level of pro-
duction of another good. Exhibit 8.2 takes the data from Exhibit 8.1 to show your “economy’s” 
PPC by indicating the combinations of Web sites and computer programs that you can produce 
in an 8-hour period. The PPC is quite similar to the budget constraint that we discussed in 
­Chapter 5: it tells us how much we can produce from existing resources and technology.
In the exhibit, the x-axis represents the number of individual Web sites that you complete, 
and the y-axis represents the number of computer programs that you complete. The exhibit 
highlights the trade-offs that you make when deciding what to produce. If you committed all 
of your effort to making Web sites, you could prepare 8 of them per day. Alternatively, if you 
spent all of your time programming, you could complete 16 computer programs per day. These 
are the most extreme trade-offs that can be made. As such, they form the endpoints of the PPC 
for your economy, which is represented by the blue line.
But there are choices that you can make between these extremes. When considering a 
PPC, it is useful to remember the following rules:
• Points on the PPC, such as point B in Exhibit 8.2—6 Web sites produced and  
4 computer programs produced—are attainable and efficient.
• Points inside the PPC, such as point A—4 Web sites produced and 4 computer 
­programs produced—are attainable but inefficient.
• Points beyond the PPC, like point C—8 Web sites produced and 8 computer ­programs 
produced—are unattainable.
Therefore, any point on or below the PPC represents possible production levels in an  
8-hour day. Production combinations on the PPC are both attainable and efficient; that is, 
they can be achieved, and they make full use of your resources (your time, in this case). 
Any combination outside the line, like point C, is unattainable. This is because within an 
8-hour day you cannot produce this amount of Web sites (8) and programs (8)—it is techni-
cally not feasible given your skills and available resources.
Why do we say that any point inside the PPC is attainable but not efficient? The ­reason is 
that you could produce more with your time. Consider point A. In this case, you could, for 
example, use your time more efficiently and produce 2 more Web sites (moving rightward 
Exhibit 8.2 The Production 
Possibilities Curve
The PPC is a graphical 
­representation of the 
­production schedule. Much 
like the budget constraint 
from Chapter 5, the slope 
represents the number 
of computer programs 
that you forego when you 
produce an additional 
Web site. Points on the 
PPC (such as point B and 
point D) are attainable and 
­efficient, points inside the 
PPC (such as point A) are 
attainable and inefficient, 
and points outside the 
PPC (such as point C) are 
unattainable.
A production possibilities curve 
(PPC) shows the relationship 
between the maximum production 
of one good for a given level of 
production of another good.

from point A to point B), or 4 more computer programs (moving upward from point A to 
point D), or a combination of some number of additional Web sites and computer programs 
(moving up and right from point A to your PPC). People and firms are inside their PPC 
when they do not efficiently produce. For example, a car manufacturer, such as Chrysler, 
might not have the optimal ratio of workers to machines, leading it to produce inside its 
PPC. In general, it is optimal to find a point on the PPC where production combinations 
are both attainable and efficient, such as points B or D of the exhibit.
Calculating Opportunity Cost
Exhibit 8.2 shows that when you produce more Web sites, you produce fewer computer 
programs. This makes sense—if you are spending your time producing Web sites, then you 
cannot produce computer programs. This is the opportunity cost, or what you give up to 
produce one additional Web site. Just like the trade-off you faced in Chapter 5 on your buy-
ing spree, you can compute the opportunity cost of Web sites by using a formula:
Opportunity costWeb sites = Loss in computer programs
Gain in Web sites
 
where the loss in computer programs measures the number of computer programs that must 
be given up for the gain in Web sites. How do we get these numbers?
We get them by taking the absolute value of the slope of the PPC in Exhibit 8.2. To find 
the slope, we take the “rise” between two points on the vertical y-axis and divide it by the 
“run” on the horizontal x-axis. The rise is the amount by which computer programs change, 
and the run is the amount by which Web sites change. In Exhibit 8.2, we see that from point D  
to point B, the value on the y-axis changes from 8 to 4. On the x-axis, the value changes 
from 4 to 6. So, we have
Opportunity costWeb sites = -4
2 = −2
The absolute value of −2 is 2. The opportunity cost of creating one more Web site, then, 
is 2 computer programs. A similar formula provides the opportunity cost of producing 
computer programs:
Opportunity costWeb sites =
Loss in Web sites
Gain in computer programs 
So we have
Opportunity costprograms = -2
4 = -1
2
The absolute value is 1⁄2. Thus, the opportunity cost of creating computer programs is 1⁄2 a 
Web site, which means that for every computer program you produce, you give up being 
able to produce 1⁄2 of a Web site (you will notice that the opportunity costs are reciprocals; 
this is always the case for a linear PPC).
Upon making these calculations, you become rather nervous about completing the tasks 
of your new job while trying to maintain your grades and an active social life—you will 
need to spend 45 days just to finish the first task! This is because it will take you 15 full 
days to complete the computer programs (240 = 16 per day for 15 days), and an additional 
30 full days to complete the Web sites (240 = 8 per day for 30 days).
Your friend, another economics major, calmly advises you not to worry because she 
knows a student named Olivia who has taken on a similar freelance job. You do not really 
understand how this helps you, because anyone saddled with a similarly horrific job would 
have no time to assist a complete stranger!
Nevertheless, you are desperate, so you approach Olivia. After a discussion, you learn 
that Olivia faces the same Mount Everest that you do—completing 240 computer programs 
and 240 Web sites while trying to maintain her grades and an active social life.
But there’s an interesting wrinkle to the situation: Olivia has talents different from yours. 
She is relatively more proficient at Web site production. Exhibit 8.3 overlays ­Olivia’s PPC on 
your PPC; you can see that Olivia’s opportunity cost is different from your opportunity cost.

You also realize that Olivia is in exactly the same boat as you—she needs to spend 45 days to 
complete her first job too (30 days for the computer programs and 15 days for the Web sites).
How can you and Olivia minimize your work time? Should you rely on each other, or 
go it alone? And if you believe that joining forces is the correct path forward, how should 
the work be allocated between the two of you?
Exhibit 8.3 Two Production 
Possibilities Curves
Olivia’s PPC is represented 
together with your PPC. 
While you must sacrifice 
2 computer programs to 
produce an additional Web 
site, Olivia only needs to 
sacrifice 1⁄2 of a ­computer 
program for an additional 
Web site. Can you trade 
to lower the number of 
workdays?

A first place to start when answering such questions is to recognize the principle of compar-
ative advantage, which revolves around the notion of figuring out what you are relatively 
good at doing. More formally, comparative advantage is the ability of an individual, firm, 
or country to produce a certain good at a lower opportunity cost than other producers. Do 
you have a comparative advantage at producing either of the goods? What about Olivia—
does she have a comparative advantage? The answer to both questions is yes.
The key to determining who has a comparative advantage is 
to compare individual ­opportunity costs. You have a compara-
tive advantage in producing computer programs ­because you 
forego only 1⁄2 of a Web site to produce one computer program. 
Olivia ­foregoes 2 Web sites to produce one computer program. 
Because 1⁄2 is less than 2, your opportunity cost of producing 
computer programs is the lower one in this two-person economy.
Performing similar calculations, we find that Olivia has a 
comparative advantage in producing Web sites because she 
foregoes only 1⁄2 of a computer program to produce each Web site, whereas you forego 
2 computer programs to produce each Web site. The following table summarizes the 
­opportunity cost for Web sites and computer programs:

Comparative advantage is the 
ability of an individual, firm, or 
country to produce a certain good 
at a lower opportunity cost than 
other producers.
The key to determining who has a 
comparative advantage is to ­compare 
individual opportunity costs.

Specialization
So what does all of this mean? It means that if you specialize in producing what you are 
relatively good at, and Olivia specializes in producing what she is relatively good at, then 
you will both be better off if you trade. Complete specialization occurs when each indi-
vidual, firm, or country produces only what it has a comparative advantage in and relies on 
trade for the other goods and services it needs.
The gains from trade in this case are tremendous, as revealed in Exhibit 8.4. To un-
derstand how to construct Exhibit 8.4, consider if both you and Olivia committed all of 
your time to producing computer programs. 24 computer programs would be produced. 
Now if we were to take one hour away from computer program writing and allocate it to 
Web site construction, whose hour (which worker’s time) would we switch to Web site 
production? Since the opportunity cost of Olivia producing a Web site is lower than yours  
(1/2 a computer program foregone versus 2 computer programs foregone), we would shift 
an hour from Olivia. If we wanted even more Web sites, we would continue to shift Olivia’s 
hours until she is completely specializing in Web site production (Point T in Exhibit 8.4). If 
we wanted to produce even more than 16 Web sites, the tradeoff/­opportunity cost will now 
increase to 2 computer programs forgone for each additional Web site because we begin to 
have you produce Web sites.
A key insight from Exhibit 8.4 is that at point T you and Olivia can produce a daily 
output of 16 Web sites and 16 computer programs. This works because you specialize 
in what you are good at—writing programs—and Olivia specializes in what she is good 
at—creating Web sites.
So upon complete specialization, you produce all 480 computer programs and Olivia 
produces all 480 Web sites. Of these 480 computer programs, you use 240 of them for 
your freelance job and give the remaining 240 to Olivia. In turn, she gives you 240 Web 
sites. The mere ability to trade with one another leads both of you to completely specialize, 
­decreasing your work time from 45 days to 30 days!
Absolute Advantage
At this point you might be thinking that the example above is “cooked.” The key, you might 
argue, is that you and Olivia have different talents and, indeed, symmetrical ones at that: your 
opportunity cost is the inverse of Olivia’s opportunity cost. To see that the power of compara-
tive advantage is more general than this simple scenario, let’s continue with the example and

Exhibit 8.4 The Gains from

With complete specialization,  
­you produce 16 ­computer

­produces 16 Web sites

The change in the output of 
both computer ­programs 
and Web sites left of point T 
is ­determined ­entirely by 
the slope of Olivia’s PPC. 
Similarly, it is your PPC that 
­determines the change in 
total ­production to the right 
of point T.

assume that you take an intensive one-week course on Web site production and design. The 
new knowledge that you gain causes your Web site productivity to triple, causing your PPC to 
pivot about the y-axis. Your new PPC is shown in Exhibit 8.5, alongside Olivia’s PPC.
You can now produce 24 Web sites in one day, as compared with 8 before the ­training. 
Therefore, if you now go it alone, you can produce a daily output of 16 computer programs 
or 24 Web sites. So you will only need to work 25 days—15 days on computer programs 
and 10 days on Web sites. This is much less than the 45 days when you were working on 
your own before the training, and it is even less than the 30 days you needed to work when 
you traded with Olivia. But does it mean that trade cannot help in this case?
No, but the gains from trade are now less obvious. You might be thinking that you are 
now better than Olivia at both tasks, so why do you need her help? Being better at both 
tasks means that you have an absolute advantage at producing both Web sites and com-
puter programs. In general terms, an absolute advantage is the ability of an individual, 
firm, or country to produce more of a certain good than other competing producers, given 
the same number of resources (in this case, production in an 8-hour day).
Despite your newfound superior skill, you might be surprised to learn that gains to trade 
still remain. This is so because even though you can produce more Web sites and computer 
programs in a given day than Olivia can produce, you do not have a comparative advan-
tage in producing both goods. With linear PPCs, unless two people have exactly the same 
­opportunity cost, one will always have a comparative advantage in producing one good and 
Suppose that you walk into an economics lab experiment 
to make a little money. When you arrive, the experiment-
ers pair you with another student and lets you know that 
you can produce combinations of keys and locks at the 
rate specified by the blue line in the chart to the right, 
and that your partner can do so at the rate specified 
by the tan line. Your task is to select a production point 
along your PPC. At the same time, your partner makes 
her choice.
After you have made your selection, your choice will be 
combined with that of your partner. Every key and lock 
pair entitles each partner to $10. Spare keys and locks are 
worth nothing.
What key/lock production combination should you 
choose?
A key consideration is what do you and your partner 
have a comparative advantage in producing? The pro-
duction possibilities and opportunity costs are summa-
rized in the table below the chart.
In this type of experiment, many subjects either maxi-
mize the pairs that they alone can produce or simply 
choose the largest number they can. For example, sub-
jects like you typically choose 8 keys, and your partner 
typically maximizes what he or she can produce, choosing 
6 keys. In this case, you both wind up earning nothing!
Why? Though you can produce more keys than locks, 
you should choose to make only locks because you have 
a comparative advantage in producing locks. Likewise, 
your partner should choose to make only keys. In this 
way, you each can produce 6, allowing you to walk away 
with earnings of $60 each. Following your comperative 
advantage leads you and your partner to coordinate 
production.

Each individual should specialize in the production of

(e.g., lower opportunity cost), so your experiment partner 
should specialize in producing keys, producing a total 
of 6 keys, and you should specialize in producing locks, 
manufacturing a total of 6 locks.

the other person the other good. Why? Because one person is relatively better at one task 
than the other, and vice versa.
So what are the gains to specialization and trade in this case? To answer this question, 
we must first compute who has a comparative advantage in production of each of the 
goods. The following table summarizes the new opportunity cost:
 
Web Site  
Opportunity Cost
Computer Program  
Opportunity Cost
You
2⁄3 computer programs
3⁄2 Web sites
Olivia
½ computer programs
2 Web sites
Even though you have taken classes in Web site production, Olivia still has a com-
parative advantage in producing Web sites. At 1⁄2 a computer program, her opportunity cost 
remains lower than your opportunity cost of producing a Web site, 2⁄3 computer programs. 
Likewise, you maintain your comparative advantage in producing computer programs 
­because your opportunity cost is 3⁄2 Web sites, whereas Olivia’s is 2 Web sites.
Accordingly, we can follow the example above and have each of you completely spe-
cialize: you produce 480 programs and Olivia produces 480 Web sites. And you can get the 
jobs done by both working 30 days.
Does this make sense? How come that even after receiving Web site training, you 
are no better off? Do you really need Olivia’s help? Without her, you need to work only  
25 days—15 days on computer programs and 10 days on Web sites. What should you do?
The Price of the Trade
The reason why this example does not lead to a more advantageous outcome for you is 
­because we held the terms of trade constant from the first example: 1 Web site for 1 com-
puter program. The terms of trade is the negotiated exchange rate of goods for goods. The 
principle of comparative advantage, while powerful, does not provide an exact terms of 
trade, but it does provide a range within which trade will occur. In this way, it prescribes 
how the gains to trade are split between the two parties.
As this example shows, if the exchange rate is 1 computer program for 1 Web site, you 
are worse off from trade because you are working 30 days, whereas with no trade you need 
Exhibit 8.5 An Illustration 
of Absolute Advantage
After taking a course in 
Web site design, you can 
produce more computer 
programs (16 versus 8) and 
more Web sites (24 versus 
16) than Olivia. This gives 
you an absolute advantage 
in both types of production.

to work only 25 days. Therefore, at a one-for-one trading rate, you would not participate in 
the trade. Is there any exchange rate for which you would trade?
The answer is yes. There is a range of terms of trade that would be mutually beneficial to 
both you and Olivia, and this range can be found by considering opportunity cost. You both 
consider your own internal trade-off between Web sites and computer programs and compare 
that to the terms of trade. If the trade makes you better off, you do it. Otherwise you do not.
Consider each person’s computer program opportunity cost. You give up 3⁄2 Web sites 
for every computer program you produce. So for you to give Olivia one computer pro-
gram, she must give you at least 3⁄2 Web sites. Now, put yourself in Olivia’s shoes. Given 
her opportunity cost, the most she is willing to give up for one computer program is  
2 Web sites. With those in hand, the rule is straightforward: for both people to engage in 
the trade, the trading price must lie between their opportunity costs. For this example:
2
3/2
Terms of Trade Range  
(Web Sites for Computer  
Programs)
You can now see why a one-for-one trade does not work: it is outside of this range and 
you can do better on your own. Likewise, if you insisted that you receive more than 2 Web 
sites for each computer program, Olivia would not agree to trade because she is better off 
on her own.
Understanding the terms of trade reveals which of the trading partners reaps the gains of 
trade. Prices closer to 3⁄2 Web sites per program favor Olivia, while prices closer to 2 Web 
sites per program favor you. Why? This is so because Olivia is producing Web sites, and 
the fewer she gives up per program, the better off she will be. Likewise, you are producing 
programs, and the more Web sites you receive in return for each program, the better off you 
will be. A price right in the middle—1.75 Web sites per program—provides you and Olivia 
with the same gains from trade.
This example also highlights that the gains to trade shrink as the 
trading partners become more alike. Before you took the intensive 
one-week course on Web site production and design, trading with 
Olivia showed great gains because you were each good at different 
tasks: you were proficient at writing computer programs and Olivia 
at producing Web sites. This led to a substantial gain due to trade. 
As you became more similar to Olivia, the gains to trade shrank.
The gains to trade shrink as the 
­trading partners become more alike.
Just as you and Olivia have different talents, individual states in the United States have 
quite distinct advantages. Consider the undergraduate student living in Minnesota. On any 
given day, she wakes up to a chilled glass of orange juice, slips on her leather boots, and 
drives her Chrysler Jeep to class. Just in these three simple tasks, she has taken advantage 
of goods produced in Florida, California, and Michigan. Although you might not realize it, 
many of the everyday products you consume are produced in states outside of where you 
live. Why is that the case?
Think of it this way: Alaska would have a difficult time producing pineapples just as 
Hawaii would provide a relatively poor environment for growing corn. If trade were not 
allowed to occur between states—say, by law or because transportation costs were too high 
(think of life for your great-great grandparents)—some people might lack even the most 
basic modern necessities. Cotton clothing would be an unknown in the northern states, 
while technologies that make our life easier, like iPads, would be everywhere in California 
but might not yet have arrived in the eastern part of the country. Many states would have 
no access to salmon, while states like New York and Nebraska would be without grapefruit 
juice. Citizens of Wyoming might still be riding horseback, and people living in many 
northern states might suffer vitamin C deficiencies.

Having won four National Basketball Association MVPs 
and two championships in the past 5 years, LeBron James 
is known as the best basketball player on the planet. But 
his talents extend well beyond dunking a basketball. In 
fact, with a wingspan of over 7 feet, LeBron is proficient 
at many tasks.
Think about interior painting. Coupling his wingspan 
with his 6-foot-8-inch height, LeBron can paint entire in-
terior walls of homes without ever using a ladder! In this 
way, LeBron is much more efficient than many profes-
sional painters—he has an absolute advantage in not only 
­basketball but also painting.
With such talents, does it make sense for him to paint 
the interior walls of his own house when he wants a color 
change?
As you’ve learned, it does not. Everyone (including 
­LeBron) will be better off if LeBron sticks to the task 
for which he has a comparative advantage—playing 
­basketball—everyone except the opposition, that is.
CHOICE & CONSEQUENCE
Should LeBron James Paint His Own House?
Of course, states do not exist in isolation; just as for you and Olivia, differences in 
comparative advantage permit trading partners to gain from trade. Producers in every state 
in the United States ship goods to other states, and every state has citizens who consume 
goods made in other states. A good that is made in California and shipped to Wisconsin 
is called an export for California and an import for Wisconsin. Below we discuss trade 
­between countries. In this case, an export is any good that is produced domestically but 
sold abroad. An import is any good that is produced abroad but sold domestically. Exports 
and imports are a useful way to measure trading activity.
Exhibit 8.6 reveals just how important interstate trade is today. The Bureau of Transporta-
tion Statistics (BTS) keeps track of all interstate commodity shipments by state of origin and 
state of destination. In addition, the BTS tracks commodity shipments from U.S. states to other 
countries. Exhibit 8.6 captures all this information in a way that provides an ­indication of how 
vibrant trade is between U.S. states. In the exhibit, for each state, the total value of interstate 
trade (state to state) is divided by the total value of international trade. This exhibit tells us just 
how large a role interstate trade plays in the grand scheme of U.S. global trade.
We find that this ratio is the highest in Tennessee, which means that of all the states, 
Tennessee trades the most with other states compared to its trade with other countries. This 
is partly because Tennessee sends a lot of agricultural, chemical, and transport products to 
other states. States such as Arkansas, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wyoming also engage 
in substantial interstate trade compared to trading with other countries. Overall, the average 
ratio of interstate to international trade is 7.86 across the United States, meaning that trade 
between states is almost 8 times more valuable than international trade!
An interesting pattern in Exhibit 8.6 is states with lower ratios of interstate-to-international  
trade are typically coastal/border states, while states with high ratios of interstate-to- 
international trade are typically in the interior of the United States. This tendency highlights 
the importance of transportation costs in determining trade patterns.
Economy-Wide PPC
Trade between you and Olivia revolved around comparative advantage and was shown in  
your joint PPC. Imagine adding together the production possibilities of hundreds of thousands 
or millions of people—you quickly get a smoothly curved line pointing away from the origin, 
as in Exhibit 8.7. The exhibit shows a production possibilities curve for apples on the y-axis and 
­oranges on the x-axis. Point A corresponds to production that is attainable but inefficient. Point B  
is attainable and efficient. Point C is unattainable with current resources and technology.
An export is any good that is 
produced domestically but sold 
abroad.
An import is any good that 
is produced abroad but sold

Exhibit 8.7 A Production Possibilities Curve
When we encountered PPCs before, the opportunity cost of one 
good in terms of the other was constant—the slope of the PPC. 
However, with a curved PPC, we see that whereas going from 
­producing 0 oranges to 1 orange reduces apple production by a 
small fraction, moving from 6 oranges to 7 oranges reduces apple 
production by more than 2, demonstrating an ­increase in oppor-
tunity costs.

The curvature represents the general principle of increasing opportunity cost mentioned 
in Chapter 1. We see increasing opportunity costs in the economy-wide PPC because mov-
ing to production extremes is difficult, as some inputs are quite well suited for producing 
apples, whereas other inputs are better suited for producing oranges. Thus, as you move re-
sources increasingly into production of one good, the opportunity cost of doing so increases 
at an increasing rate.
What determines the location of a state’s PPC? In the short run, the PPC is fixed. But in 
the long run, resources are not fixed, so increases in natural resources or changes in produc-
tivity due to population growth, changes in technology, and increases in worker education 
shift the PPC outward. Among U.S. states, the factors that contribute most to the location 
of the PPC are the natural resources and the stock of man-made resources (technology) 
available to the state, as well as the education, work habits, and experience of the labor 
force, the relative abundance of labor and physical capital, and the climate.
Exhibit 8.8 shows an example of how one of these productivity catalysts—improved 
technology—makes us better off and shifts the PPC outward. Suppose that a new fertil-
izer is invented that increases maximum orange production by 3 units and maximum apple 
production by 1 unit. These increases will cause the PPC shown in Exhibit 8.8 to shift from 
PPC A to PPC B, where we can produce more apples and more oranges with our current 
set of resources.
Comparative Advantage and Specialization Among States
In our earlier example, we learned that the ability to trade allowed you and Olivia to spe-
cialize in production of the goods that you were best at producing. As a result, both of you 
were better off. Exactly the same forces that operate on the individual level to form the 
basis for trade also operate on the state level.
Consider another example. Suppose that the states of California and Florida are both 
producers and consumers of apricots and of bananas but that California has a comparative 
advantage in producing apricots and Florida has a comparative advantage in producing 
bananas. What do you think should happen?
Similar to you and Olivia, California should focus its production on apricots, whereas 
Florida should focus on producing bananas. Such comparative advantage represents a basis 
for trade. In addition, the trading price would be determined by the opportunity costs. For 
instance, assume that the opportunity costs are as follows:
 
Apricots Opportunity Cost
Bananas Opportunity Cost
California
1⁄5 bananas
5 apricots
Florida
8 bananas
1⁄8 apricots
Exhibit 8.8 How Improved 
Technology Shifts the PPC
With the advent of new 
­fertilizer technology, the PPC 
shifts outward, representing 
the ability to produce more 
apples for every choice of 
orange production, and vice 
versa.

Therefore, the trading price must be within the following range to be acceptable to both 
parties:
Terms of Trade Range  
(Apricots for Bananas)
This is the same logic at work for the price of the trade that we saw in the previous sec-
tion with you and Olivia. The terms of trade, or the exchange rate of apricots for bananas, 
allows both states to be better off through specialization and trade.

and Imports Since 1960
Here, we plot the total  
value of U.S. exports  
and imports from 1960  
to 2013 in real dollars.  
While nearly identical in  
the earlier years, the gap  
between U.S. imports and  
exports becomes apparent  
in the mid-1970s and  
continues to expand as 
imports grow faster than 
exports.

We suspect that if you sneak into your grandparents’ closet and check the tag on your 
grandma’s 1970 dress, it will say that the dress was manufactured in the United States. Do 
the same for your grandpa’s 1963 suit that he wore for his wedding—perhaps it was made 
in Chicago or Philadelphia? Conduct the same investigation in your parents’ closets and 
you will find a mix of goods that were much more likely produced abroad. Now take a peek 
at the tags on your own clothes—they were likely manufactured in another country that 
might not even have been manufacturing clothes in the 1960s and 1970s.
Such differences in sources for apparel are due to international trade. As ­ 
Exhibit 8.9 shows, since 1960 the volume of U.S. trade has grown dramatically. In 2010 
alone, the value of imported goods into the United States was more than $2,300,000,000,000. 
That is a whopping 2.3 trillion dollars of imported goods annually! This number is over 
14 times greater than imports in 1960. Moreover, these increases in trade are not purely 
due to an increased level of production over time: in 1980, imports were only 5.2 percent 
of overall U.S. production, whereas now imports are more than 16 percent of overall U.S. 
production. The world is most definitely becoming more interdependent.
Our exports have also grown dramatically: they are now more than 12 times greater 
than our level of exports in 1960. Yet, they lag our current level of imports, making the 
U.S. a net importer—that is, a country for which imports are worth more than exports 
over a given time period. In fact, as Exhibit 8.9 shows, the United States has been a net 
importer since the mid-1970s. In later chapters, we return to this pattern of trade and 
discuss whether U.S. citizens should be concerned about the high levels of net importa-
tion in recent years.

This aggregate trading pattern, however, does not hold true for all types of goods. For 
example, the United States has historically exported very little crude oil, but it has imported 
millions of barrels of crude oil monthly. In fact, the level of imports has substantially 
­increased since 1960, as shown in Exhibit 8.10.
So what types of goods are causing this major shift in the balance of imports and exports 
for the United States that we observe in Exhibit 8.9? As Exhibit 8.11 shows, manufactured 
goods have played an important role. The exhibit shows that although the United States 
has continued to increase the number of manufactured goods that it produces, it has been 
importing more and more from developing nations.
Until recently, most manufactured goods on the world market were produced in advanced 
economies—the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Recently, however, 
China has surpassed the United States in manufactured exports, as shown in panel (b) of 
Exhibit 8.11. The value of manufactured exports of China now far exceeds the value of

much more.

of internal economic liberalization and reform.

manufactured exports from the United States and other developed na-
tions. China’s growth is indicative of the pattern of trade observed for 
developing countries as a whole. Understanding the determinants of 
these trade patterns merits more serious consideration and has been a 
hot topic of recent research for economists. We return to this trend in the 
Evidence-Based Economics section.
Determinants of Trade Between Countries
Given the lessons of this chapter, you will likely not be surprised to learn 
that comparative advantage underlies the trading patterns ­observed in 
Exhibits 8.9 through 8.11. To illustrate this key idea more succinctly 
and to reveal its economic underpinnings, let’s consider the market for 
tennis shoes in Denmark.
To make the point most clearly, we assume that tennis shoes are 
identical and that Denmark is a price-taker. Further, we assume 
that ­Denmark currently does not trade with other countries. From 
­Denmark’s perspective, therefore, the market for tennis shoes consists 
solely of Danish buyers and sellers.
As Exhibit 8.12 shows, under these assumptions, the domestic price 
is given by the intersection of the Danish demand and the Danish supply 
curves. In this case, the equilibrium price for a pair of tennis shoes is $50, and the equilibrium 
quantity of tennis shoes is 2 million pairs. As we learned in Chapter 5, consumer surplus is the 
triangle below the demand curve and above the market price. Likewise, as Chapter 6 showed, 
producer surplus is the triangle above the supply curve and below the market price.
If the Danish government decides to open its borders to free trade, which is the ability 
to trade without government hindrance or encouragement, will Denmark be an importer or 
an exporter of tennis shoes? That is, will it buy tennis shoes from other countries or will it 
sell tennis shoes to other countries? The answer is not yet clear because we don’t know the 
price of tennis shoes outside of Denmark. We need a world price for tennis shoes, that is, 
the prevailing price of tennis shoes on the world market.
Then, the answer to whether Denmark will import or export comes down to a simple 
comparison: is the Danish domestic price for tennis shoes above or below the world price 
for tennis shoes? 
• If Denmark’s domestic price is below the world price, then it will become an exporter 
of tennis shoes.
• If Denmark’s domestic price is above the world price, then it will become an ­importer 
of tennis shoes.
We turn to both scenarios now and explore who wins and who loses when Denmark begins 
to trade.
The growth in outsourcing (relying on foreign 
­countries for goods and services) has proven that 
there is not just trade in traditional goods like cars 
or clothing, but there is also trade in services. More 
and more, customer service hotlines are managed 
­overseas, for example.
Exhibit 8.12 Equilibrium 
for Tennis Shoes in 
Denmark
With our assumption of 
a perfectly competitive 
market, the equilibrium 
price and quantity of tennis 
shoes in Denmark will arise 
in the ­familiar way—at the 
intersection of the domestic 
supply and demand curves.
Free trade is the ability to 
trade without hindrance or 
encouragement from the 
government.
A world price is the prevailing price 
of a good on the world market.

Exporting Nations: Winners and Losers
Let’s delve a little more deeply into the scenario in which Denmark’s domestic price for 
tennis shoes is below the world price, and it becomes an exporter. We’ll assume that the 
world price for a pair of tennis shoes is $75—well above the equilibrium domestic price of 
$50. Will Danish suppliers continue to supply Danes with tennis shoes for $50? The answer 
is no, because they can sell as many pairs of tennis shoes on the world market for a price 
of $75 and make more money.
As Exhibit 8.13 shows, in this case Danish suppliers will increase their production from 
2 million pairs of tennis shoes to 3.25 million pairs and receive the world price of $75 
per pair. At that price, Danish consumers no longer demand as many pairs of tennis 
shoes: the price has gone up, so they decrease their quantity demanded by moving 
along their demand curve until the price of $75 is reached. This movement stops 
when the quantity demanded reaches 0.75 million pairs, at a price of $75.
This situation leads to an excess supply of production in Denmark. This excess 
supply of 2.5 million pairs of tennis shoes (3.25 − 0.75 = 2.50) is subsequently 
sold on the world market. Because Denmark is a small producer of tennis shoes, this 
added supply does not change the world price.
So who wins and who loses when Denmark opens its borders to trade and becomes 
an exporter? A comparison of producer and consumer surplus measures provides the 
answer. A first consideration is that Danish sellers are clearly better off. They are now 
selling more tennis shoes, and the price is higher for each pair. The sellers’ gain can 
be computed from the change in producer surplus. In ­Exhibit 8.13, we see that before 
trade was allowed, Danish producer surplus was equal to area A. This is the area above 
the supply curve and below the market price. After permitting trade, the new producer 
surplus is equal to areas A + B + C. Thus, Danish sellers experience an increased 
producer surplus of B + C because of trade.
For Danish consumers, though, the story is much different. Without trade, they 
purchased 2 million pairs of shoes per year at $50 per pair, receiving a consumer 
surplus of areas B + D in Exhibit 8.13. After opening to trade, they purchase only 
LETTING THE DATA SPEAK
Fair Trade Products
Will his shoes be sold 
­domestically or abroad?
What’s Behind the Boom?
In response to the feeling that the growth of free trade 
has led to the exploitation of developing countries, a new 
market has opened up for the consumer concerned with 
a broad variety of production-related issues, including 
the environment, fair labor practices, or child labor in the 
developing world. Goods imported from the developing 
world—so called “fair trade” products—are certified by 
third-party organizations as fair trade products.
To receive a fair trade label, the production of a good 
has to meet certain standards. For example, if the pro-
ducer doesn’t allow unionization, uses child or slave labor, 
or doesn’t adhere to the U.N. Charter on Human Rights, 
then it can’t be classified as fair trade.
Consumers can’t seem to get enough of fair trade 
products. Sales growth for fair trade goods has reached 
double-digit proportions over the past decade. Surpris-
ingly, sales continued to expand even in spite of the 2008 
recession, growing 15 percent in 2009.1
In spite of the recent surge in demand for fair trade 
products, not everyone is a fan. Overseeing billions of 
dollars of production isn’t easy, and the capacity for 
certifying organizations to enforce labor standards some-
times can’t keep up with the increasing demand for fair 
trade products.2

0.75 million pairs of shoes and pay $75 per pair. Now consumer surplus is only area D. 
Thus, Danish buyers experience a decreased consumer surplus equal to area B because the 
country opened to trade.
We can therefore draw two conclusions about what happens when a country opens itself 
to trade and becomes an exporter of goods and services:
	
1.	 Sellers win.
	
2.	 Buyers lose.
However, we also need to look at the big picture—there are gains to trade for Denmark 
as a whole. In Exhibit 8.13, area C represents what Danes as a whole gained from 
opening to trade. In principle, this area highlights that Denmark is better off because of 
trade and that the winners’ gains are greater than the losses of the losers, opening up the 
possibility that the winners can compensate the losers. If the Danes were so inclined, 
one way for this to happen is to tax shoe producers and transfer the revenues to shoe 
consumers (though the situation of winners fully compensating losers rarely happens, 
as we discuss below).
Importing Nations: Winners and Losers
Now let’s consider the flip side. If Denmark’s domestic price is above the world price, 
then it will be an importer of tennis shoes. Let’s assume that the world price for a pair of 
tennis shoes is now $25, well below the equilibrium domestic price of $50. We depict this 
scenario in Exhibit 8.14, which shows that in this case Danish suppliers will curb their 
production to 0.75 million pairs of shoes by changing quantity supplied, or sliding down 
the market supply curve until $25 is reached. At that price, Danish consumers demand  
3.25 million pairs of shoes: the price has gone down, so they move along their demand 
curve until the price of $25 is reached (shown on the rightmost dotted line). This movement 
stops when the quantity demanded reaches 3.25 million pairs at a price of $25.
These movements lead to excess demand in Denmark. This excess demand of 2.5 ­million 
pairs of tennis shoes (3.25 − 0.75 = 2.50) is subsequently purchased on the world market, 
making Denmark an importer of tennis shoes. Because Denmark is a small buyer of tennis 
shoes, this added demand does not change the world price.
So who wins and who loses when Denmark opens its borders to trade and becomes an 
importer? Again, a comparison of producer and consumer surplus measures allows us to 
answer this question. For sellers, producer surplus is lowered because they are now selling 
fewer pairs of tennis shoes and the price of each pair sold is lower. Their loss can be seen 
Exhibit 8.13 Winners and Losers  
in an Exporting Nation
Once Denmark is open to free trade, 
its suppliers take a market price that is 
higher than the domestic equilibrium 
price of $50, increasing their quantity 
supplied to 3.25 million shoes. How-
ever, at this higher price, domestic 
quantity demanded is reduced, and 
the surplus shoes are sold to the world 
market. In this case, producers win by 
being able to charge a price above 
$50 per pair, thus capturing areas B 
and C in addition to A (which they 
­already had prior to free trade). On the 
other hand, Danish consumers see a 
reduction in surplus due to the higher 
price they must pay for tennis shoes, 
losing area B to producers.

from the decreased level of producer surplus in Exhibit 8.14: before trade, producer surplus 
was areas A + C; after trade, it is only area A. Thus, Danish sellers experience a decreased 
producer surplus of area C.
For consumers, the story is the opposite. They are now purchasing more shoes at a lower 
price, so they must be better off. Exhibit 8.14 shows by how much: before trade, consumer 
surplus was area B; after trade, it is areas B + C + D. Thus, Danish buyers experience an 
increased consumer surplus equal to areas C and D because the country opened to trade.
We can therefore draw two conclusions about what happens when a country opens itself 
to trade and becomes an importer of goods and services:
	
1.	 Sellers lose.
	
2.	 Buyers win.
And once again, the overall gains to trade for Denmark are positive, represented by area D  
in Exhibit 8.14. This area highlights the fact that even when countries are net ­importers, 
they are net gainers. As a whole, Denmark is much better off, allowing the winners to 
potentially compensate the losers. Taxing consumers and sending the revenues to shoe 
producers is one way in which such compensation can take place. (We discuss further the 
pros and cons of such taxation in Chapter 10.)
Where Do World Prices Come From?
In the cases above when we illustrate the impact that free trade has on Denmark’s tennis shoe 
market, we fix the world price for tennis shoes to make a point about the winners and losers of 
free trade. But where do world prices for tennis shoes, or any good for that matter, come from? 
It turns out that our supply and demand framework does a good job of telling us. As countries 
open up their borders and act upon their comparative advantages, the sum of all these actions 
lets us talk about a world supply and a world demand for a product. The intersection of these 
two (world supply curve and world demand curve) determines the world price.
Determinants of a Country’s Comparative Advantage
You may now be wondering what determines a country’s comparative advantage and 
whether it can predict trade flows before opening itself to trade. As in our analysis of state-
level trading in the United States, the factors that contribute most to comparative advantage 
at the country level are:
	
1.	 Natural resources (to a large degree, beyond the countries’ control, unless 
squandered)
	
2.	 Stocks of man-made resources (more controllable; depend on PPC)
Exhibit 8.14 Winners and Losers  
in an Importing Nation
Once Denmark is open to trade, its buy-
ers will only pay the world price, which is 
lower than the domestic equilibrium price 
without trade of $50. This decreases 
quantity supplied to 0.75 million shoes. 
However, at this lower price, domestic 
quantity demanded is increased and the 
excess demand is covered by shoes from 
the world market. In this case, ­consumers 
are better off because they pay a price 
below $50 per pair, thus capturing 
­areas C and D in addition to B (which 
they ­already had prior to trade). On the 
other hand, producers in Denmark see 
a ­reduction in surplus due to the lower 
price, ­losing area C to consumers.

Because of the wide array of these determinants and their changing nature, it is clear that 
comparative advantage can change over time—just as when you took the computer pro-
gramming course! A country-level example is Japan’s investment in human capital, which 
helped to nurture skills and technology to generate a winning formula for becoming a 
leading car manufacturing nation. Likewise, technological advances that permit a more 
cost-effective means to exploit a country’s stock of natural resources can change the nature 
of comparative advantage.
Globalization is the shift toward 
more open, integrated economies 
that participate in foreign trade and 
investment.
We drive Japanese cars, drink French wine, eat Mexican food, use American computers,
buy Canadian lumber and take vacations in Italy. How can you OPPOSE free trade?
We’ve seen the significant gains associated with free trade between countries, so why would 
any country ever want to hinder trade? Why were the protestors cited in the opening to this 
chapter so passionate in their opposition to free trade? Several arguments are typically set forth:
	
1.	 National security concerns
	
2.	 Fear of the effects of globalization on a nation’s culture
	
3.	 Environmental and resource concerns
	
4.	 Infant industry arguments
	
5.	 Potential negative effects on local wages and jobs
We briefly discuss the first four arguments in turn, reserving the fifth argument concerning 
wages and jobs for our last section on Evidence-Based Economics.
National Security Concerns
As we learned in Chapter 7, allowing resources to flow freely 
has the ­effect of allocating resources within and across indus-
tries efficiently. But that may mean the creation of “banana 
republics”—nations that specialize in the production of one 
good. Though this might be efficient economically, it may 
not be optimal in a defense-oriented world, where national 
security is an important consideration. A country will not pro-
duce just oranges if it fears military attack from other nations. 
Rather, it will invest in steel production and defense technol-
ogy and will maintain a variety of agricultural industries to 
preserve its integrity in times of war. Likewise, even in times 
of peace, a country might be hesitant to completely specialize because it might find itself 
too reliant on other countries. For example, because many modern economies depend on 
oil imports, many cite such reliance as a national security concern.
Fear of Globalization
Protectionism often is justified simply as a counter to globalization. ­Globalization is the 
shift toward more open, integrated economies that participate in foreign trade and invest-
ment. Some nations, however, want to maintain their culture’s uniqueness and therefore view 
globalization as a serious concern. That is to say, as the world becomes increasingly inter-
dependent, it also becomes increasingly similar—decades ago China had no McDonald’s; 
now in large cities there is one on every corner. In addition, Starbucks now serves coffee in 
more than sixty countries—some people fear the loss of their cultural identity through such 
globalization. Such preferences are an important consideration for leaders around the world.
Environmental and Resource Concerns
Tangible goods such as clothing and food are not the only things traded by countries; abstract 
goods such as environmental quality may be traded as well. Countries with lax environmental

Protectionism is the idea that 
free trade can be harmful, and 
government intervention is 
necessary to control trade.
Tariffs are taxes levied on goods 
and services transported across 
political boundaries.
By their very nature, tariffs 
­interfere with equilibrium prices and 
­quantities, artificially reducing social 
surplus in a country.
policies allow for relatively more pollution from firms than countries with strong environ-
mental policies. Opponents of free trade often cite these policy differences as creating “pol-
lution havens” in poor countries. These countries, in an effort to promote economic growth 
and jobs, use lax pollution regulations to attract industry. A similar argument exists for natu-
ral resources, such as ivory. The argument is that free trade endangers the 
stock of animals that provide ivory (for example, elephant, walrus, nar-
whal) because openness to trade leads to higher demand for ivory, threat-
ening species extinction. In the next chapter, we discuss more broadly 
how governments protect such resources.
Infant Industry Arguments
Opponents of free trade also cite the “infant industries” argument, in 
which governments protect their fledgling domestic industries against 
more advanced competitors. For example, to help Toyota grow, the 
Japanese government forced General Motors and Ford out of the coun-
try in 1939. Generally, infant industry arguments rely on the idea that 
in industries with economies of scale, or substantial learning by doing, 
it is important for policymakers to protect local firms early in their development. In addi-
tion, starting a company in isolation may deprive it of “technological spillovers” that its 
competitors, all located near one another, may enjoy—the isolated company will be the 
last to learn of trade secrets.
Ultimately, the basis of any infant industry argument is that a company is currently too 
weak to withstand competition from other firms. To survive, the company requires govern-
ment protection. Protectionism is the idea that free trade can be harmful, and government 
intervention is necessary to control trade.
Protectionism takes many forms, and has been used as a means to block the growing 
interdependence in the world. We now turn to one such example—tariffs.
The Effects of Tariffs
As we discussed in the chapter opener, many individuals worry about their own jobs when 
trade increases between countries. Historically, one of the most popular forms of govern-
ment protectionism is to impose tariffs, which are taxes levied on goods and services 
transported across political boundaries. Protectionism via an imposed tariff is not free, 
however. Indeed, by their very nature, tariffs interfere with equilibrium prices and quanti-
ties, artificially reducing social surplus in a country.
To show how, let’s reconsider the example of Denmark as an 
importing nation of tennis shoes. Assume that for infant ­industry 
reasons, the Danish government decides to invoke a $15 tariff 
on every pair of imported tennis shoes to protect ­Danish suppli-
ers. That is, the government collects $15 from the foreign pro-
ducer for every pair of tennis shoes that crosses Danish borders. 
Exhibit 8.15 shows the effect of such a tariff.
Notice that before the tariff is imposed, consumer surplus 
is given by the sum of the colored regions labeled B, F, E, and  
G, H, I, and J. This is the area under the demand curve but above 
the world price line. The pink triangle labeled area A is domestic producer surplus. This is 
the area above the supply curve but below the world price line.
After Denmark imposes a $15 tariff on shoes, the local market price rises from  
$25 to $40. The imposition of the tariff reduces consumer surplus to the area above the new 
price line and below the domestic demand curve—areas B, F, and H. Therefore, the loss 
in consumer surplus from the tariff is areas E, G, I, and J. Where does this lost surplus go?
Area E goes to producers, so their new surplus is areas A + E. They are better off 
­because they can now sell shoes to the local market at $40 rather than $25. The government 
is also better off since area I goes to the government. The government receives the number 
of import goods times the tariff price in revenue. This revenue equals $15 × 1 million = 
$15 million, or the area of rectangle I.
What about areas G and J? This is the deadweight loss of the tariff. As we discussed 
in Chapter 7, market distortions often lead to deadweight loss. In this case, the Danish

Exhibit 8.15 The Effect of 
a Tariff
Here we revisit the example 
of Denmark as an importing 
country, but now the govern-
ment of Denmark enacts a 
tariff. By raising the price us-
ing the tariff, the government 
earns revenues from the tariff 
(area I), and producer surplus 
rises by area E. But consum-
ers are worse off (they lose 
­areas E, G, I, and J), and 
there is a deadweight loss 
of areas G and J because of 
the tariff.

economy loses the two triangles labeled G and J. This is the cost that the Danes pay to 
protect the tennis shoe industry by imposing a tariff.
From this analysis, we can see one reason why economists in general do not favor such 
protectionism—it raises prices for consumers and lowers social surplus. This might be 
one reason why some countries have been moving away from using tariffs. Exhibit 8.16 
shows the dutiable imports ratio from 1891 to 2008. This is a measure of the ratio of tariff 
revenues (duties) collected to the value of dutiable imports. The orange line marks a series 
of tariff increases, called the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, in the United States during the Great 
Depression. After the imposition of these peak tariffs, the United States quickly learned 
about one repercussion of limiting free trade—other countries will respond in kind! Other 
nations began charging American companies new duties. America consequently reduced its 
tariffs, likely saving millions of dollars through increased consumer and producer surplus.

The x-axis is time and the y-axis is the dutiable imports ratio. This is the ratio of tariff 
revenues (duties) collected to the value of dutiable imports. It is usually reported as 
a percentage. We see that the 1920s and 1930s saw a ­dramatic increase in this ratio. 
Over time, however, the ratio has been steadily decreasing.

s there a link between opening to trade and a loss in jobs and wages in the import-
ing country? We have learned in this chapter that opening a country to trade may 
make some individuals worse off: fewer shoes are made in Denmark when the country 
­becomes an importer. Perhaps this depresses wages in Denmark or puts cobblers out 
of work.
You might be thinking: “Wait a minute! We just learned that whether a country be-
comes an importer or an exporter doesn’t matter; the winners can more than compensate 
the losers, at least in theory. So, why does it matter if wages fall and jobs are lost? Can’t 
we all still be better off?”
This is a keen insight, and theoretically correct. But in practice, complete compensation 
of losers from opening an economy to international trade is difficult. First, as we discuss in 
Chapter 10, the government might not be able to effectively carry out such policies. Second, 
it is often difficult to pinpoint exactly who the winners are and how much they each gained, 
and who the losers are and how much they each lost. It is often the case that the losers are 
spread throughout the economy and sometimes touched in very small ways. Thus, we can 
conclude that opening an economy up to trade clearly expands the pie, but some people 
might end up with a smaller piece than they used to have.
In trying to answer the question of whether opening an economy to trade ad-
versely affects jobs and wages, it is instructive to consider the experience of the 
United States when it began to trade with countries that held a comparative advan-
tage in certain ­industries. Over the last half-century, new countries that produce 
textiles and other manufactured goods have emerged (Exhibit 8.11 shows the emer-
gence of China).
We’ve also seen in this chapter that when a country is a net importer—as is the 
United States for manufactured goods—domestic consumers gain and domestic produc-
ers lose. For example, New England was a key producer of textiles and manufactured 
goods during the first half of the twentieth century, but with the importation of manu-
factured goods from abroad, thousands of textile workers lost their jobs. So jobs are lost 
because of the effects of international trade. Nevertheless, with the expansion of other 
sectors, such as the high-tech and Internet-based industries, the unemployment rate in 
New England states has been among the lowest in the United States. This example 
highlights the fact that people whose skills become obsolete because of the effects of 
international trade can invest time and resources in more education and training. Upon 
doing so, they have a good chance to find work. Consistent with this evidence, the data 
also suggest that many workers displaced because of NAFTA’s passage soon found 
gainful employment.
Even though the U.S. experience suggests that workers have an opportunity to land 
on their feet, another key empirical question related to lost jobs remains: how important 
has opening to trade been in affecting wages? Economists have spent a fair amount of 
time and effort in addressing this question. The typical approach is to draw upon large 
data sets, which span several years and include information on hundreds of thousands 
of workers’ wages across several different sectors of the economy. These data sets are 
then examined to determine if wages of workers in exporting- and importing-competing 
sectors change as an economy opens to trade.
The first wave of economic studies published in the 1990s reports very small, or in-
consequential, effects of trade on wages of workers in those parts of the labor force that

Trade Agreement (NAFTA)

bloc and reduce trade barriers

produce goods competing with those coming in from abroad.3 These studies suggest that 
there is no strong evidence from the data to back the major claim of trade critics.
Yet before concluding that wages are not negatively influenced when a country opens 
to trade and becomes a net importer, Exhibit 8.11 of this chapter points to an important 
phenomenon that has occurred in recent years. Led by China, which has a comparative 
advantage in labor with its large workforce, manufacturing imports from developing 
countries have risen dramatically since 1990. Overall, imports from developing coun-
tries have grown from roughly 2.5 percent of U.S. GDP in 1990 to 6 percent of U.S. 
GDP in 2006. This trend is important because developing countries have a large pool of 
workers who are paid considerably lower wages than the manufacturing workers of our 
historical trading partners.
This could mean that in more recent years trade has had a much more important effect 
on wages in the states than we observed in the past. Scholars are just beginning to address 
this issue, using more recent data. The evidence gathered thus far does not point to anything 
conclusive. For example, economist Robert Lawrence reports that using more recent data 
does not change the overall picture of the studies published in the 1990s—there remains 
little empirical evidence that trade negatively influences wages.4 Meanwhile, economist 
Paul Krugman, the 2008 Nobel Laureate, has argued that the data are far too murky to yield 
reliable empirical results.5 In the end, we believe that at this point there is little evidence 
suggesting that opening to trade leads to lost jobs and lower wages. But, empirical work 
should continue. Do you have any ideas about how to proceed?

Summary
People and countries are dependent on each other for goods and services. 
Although there are potential costs to this interdependency, the gains associated 
with taking advantage of specialization in the production of goods and services 
can be considerable.
Specialization and trade, which are driven by comparative advantage, not 
only allow us to consume beyond our individual PPC but also lead to a wider 
variety of goods and services.
Whereas comparative advantage revolves around measuring production 
relative to the opportunity costs that you and the other person incur, absolute 
advantage relates to production per unit of inputs.
When a country opens up to trade, there are winners and losers. The gains 
from trade are larger than the losses. One key to avoiding protests about free 
trade, like the one we saw in Seattle in 1999, is to develop policies so that 
everyone can reap the gains from trade.
Empirically, it is difficult to find the vast job losses for U.S. workers that 
such critics cite. There is certainly a displacement of workers due to trade, but 
many workers soon find other jobs. Likewise, the supposed negative effect of 
trade on wages is difficult to find in the data. Beyond lost jobs, however, those 
against free trade often cite national security concerns, loss of cultural identity, 
environmental and resource concerns, and infant industry arguments.

Imagine yourself sitting in your economics classroom waiting for the 
start of class. You are chatting with your neighbors about how free trade 
might not be so bad ­after all, and other students are buzzing about 
the power of the invisible hand as they search for their preferred seats. 
Your professor strolls in with her usual materials in tow, but something 
unusual is clutched in her right hand. After setting down her bag, she 
takes out a match from a matchbox. Confidently, she strikes the match 
and lights up the cigar in her right hand. One student gasps; another 
shrieks in delight. Your economics professor is smoking a cigar in 
class! “Students, welcome to the world of externalities,” your profes-
sor says boldly.1
You might ask yourself, how do externalities fit in with the mar-
kets we have studied thus far? In short, they don’t. So far in our study 
of markets, we have focused solely on buyers and sellers, who are the only ones 
­affected by the market transaction. But we know that many times, the actions 
of one party affect the well-being of countless other parties—like people smok-
ing cigars or factories belching out smoke. In situations like these, the invisible 
hand may fail to allocate resources efficiently. For instance, many people may 
suffer from a polluting factory’s emissions without ever benefiting from the pro-
duction that caused the pollution.

KEY IDEAS
There are important cases in which free markets fail to maximize social 
surplus.
This chapter discusses three such cases: externalities, public goods, and 
common pool resources.
One common link between these three examples is that there is a 
difference between the private benefits and costs and the social benefits 
and costs.
Government can play a role in improving market outcomes in such 
cases.
Economists call such examples externalities. An externality occurs when 
there is a spillover from one person’s actions to a bystander. If left alone, people 
will generally not account for how their actions affect others—whether positive 
or negative. For instance, think about automobiles for a minute. They not only 
contribute to the global warming problem but also create traffic congestion. But 
have you ever chosen not to drive a car because of the extra congestion that 
your vehicle will cause? Neither have we. And that is the crux of why such exter-
nalities are called market failures.
In this chapter, we will see that in the case of externalities, governments can 
enact policies to push market outcomes toward a greater level of social well-
being. For example, one possible policy to alleviate traffic jams is to impose 
a fee on automobile drivers using particular roads. It’s precisely that proposal 
that we’ll examine in our Evidence-Based Economics feature at the end of the 
­chapter, which will help us answer the opening question about lowering the 
Queen’s commute time.
A related example of when the free market fails to arrive at a socially 
­efficient outcome if left alone is in the provision of public goods (such as national 
­defense) or in the protection of common pool resources (such as an open-access 
lake). The link between all three of these market failures is that there is a differ-
ence between social and private benefits or social and private costs, causing the 
individual to face different incentives than society faces. Accordingly, much like 
the case with externalities, we will find that government can play a critical role in 
providing public goods and protecting common pool resources.

fan ensures that the shower area remains fog-free. You have been awake for only 15 min-
utes on this day, but you already have made use of electricity 4 times—the alarm clock, the 
bathroom light, the water heater, and the ceiling fan.

Electricity obviously benefits all of us in many ways, but the power company incurs 
production costs to provide electricity. As we learned earlier, the market arrives at a price 
for electricity that reflects both of these factors—marginal benefits and marginal costs. In 
Exhibit 9.1, we make the assumption that the electricity industry is a perfectly competitive 
market. The market demand curve in the exhibit shows consumers’ willingness and abil-
ity to pay for electricity, and the market supply curve reflects producers’ marginal costs 
of generating it. As we learned in Chapter 7, it is at the equilibrium point where these two 
lines intersect that the invisible hand most efficiently allocates resources: the point at which 
social surplus is maximized.
But what Exhibit 9.1 does not show is that when producing electricity, plants typi-
cally emit nasty pollutants, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which can cause 
lung irritation, bronchitis, and pneumonia. You also cannot see in a graph like this that at 
high dosage levels, the mercury released from coal-burning power plants has been linked 
to birth defects. Global warming has also been linked to pollutants emitted from power 
plants.
In economic terms, the power plant imposes an externality on the public as a by-product 
of producing electricity. An externality occurs when an economic activity has either a 
spillover cost or a spillover benefit on a bystander. In this case, the plant is imposing a 
negative externality, because by producing electricity it creates a spillover cost that it does 
not consider when making production decisions. Because the owners of the plant do not 
have to pay for the costs that the plant imposes on society, they do not take into account the 
health or discomfort of the citizenry in their production decisions. That 
is, free markets allocate resources in a way that ignores these negative 
externalities.
A “Broken” Invisible Hand:  
Negative Externalities
Let’s return to Exhibit 9.1, where we show the market demand and mar-
ket supply curves for electricity. We can first ask ourselves, why is this 
outcome efficient? The answer is that it is efficient because at that point 
social surplus is maximized: every buyer who is willing and able to pay 
the equilibrium price for electricity ends up, in fact, consuming elec-
tricity. And, because plants expand production until MC = MR = P, 
social surplus is maximized: both consumers and producers do as well 
as they can in equilibrium.
When there are negative externalities present, however, this market outcome is no 
longer efficient. This is because negative externalities impose an additional cost on 
Many firms pollute when 
they produce goods for us to 
consume.

society that is not explicitly recognized by the buyers and sell-
ers in the market. For electricity generation, this additional cost 
comes from pollution, a by-product of electricity production. 
In computing the efficient outcome, we must adjust the supply 
curve to take account of the negative externalities or external 
costs. That is, as we discussed in Chapter 6, the supply curve 
is the marginal cost curve for the firm and includes a plant’s 
expenditures for inputs such as labor. The external costs that 
society bears as a result of the plant’s pollution are ignored. 
However, to arrive at the efficient production level, we need to recognize both the firm’s 
marginal cost and the marginal external costs of production. Together, they sum to the 
marginal social cost of production.
So what does this mean for the efficient level of output? Exhibit 9.2 shows the answer 
graphically. Exhibit 9.2 reveals that at each level of production we must include both the 
marginal cost of the plant to produce plus the marginal external cost of the pollution. 
This new curve is called the marginal social cost (MSC) curve because it includes both 
the marginal cost of the firm and the marginal external cost imposed on society (MSC = 
marginal cost + marginal external cost). Recall that the original supply curve is the mar-
ginal cost curve of the electricity producer—the MSC is therefore the marginal cost of the 
externality plus this marginal cost.
Taking into account the extra costs imposed on society by the plant’s pollution, we can 
see that Qoptimal is less than Qmarket because when a negative externality must be accounted 
for, a smaller quantity of electricity should be generated since it is now more costly to pro-
duce each unit. Thus, in cases where there are negative externalities, markets (if left alone) 
will produce too much, resulting in too much pollution.
You might wonder just how much this negative externality costs society. We can 
­explore this question graphically by considering Exhibit 9.3. Let’s begin with the equi-
librium quantity level, Qmarket = 400 billion kWh (kilowatt hours). In the free market, this 
is the unit of production that equates marginal willingness to pay with the marginal cost 
of producing that unit of electricity ($0.20 = $0.20). But with the negative externality, 
we see that the marginal social cost is $0.30 for the last unit, not $0.20. This means that 
by producing that last unit, we actually caused social well-being to go down by $0.10 = 
$0.30 − $0.20 (the marginal social cost from producing the last unit minus the marginal 
benefit from producing the last unit). This means that if we do not produce that last unit, 
we will save $0.10. Recall from Chapter 7 that deadweight loss is a decrease in social sur-
plus that results from a market distortion. If producing that last unit caused a deadweight 
loss of $0.10, what is the total deadweight loss associated with the externality?
Exhibit 9.2 The Socially 
Optimal Quantity and 
Price of Electricity
Negative externalities 
lead to external costs of 
­production that the private 
firm will not account for 
when making decisions. The 
­marginal external cost is the 
vertical distance ­between 
supply and marginal ­social 
cost (MSC). If we take the 
marginal external cost 
into account, a higher 
­equilibrium price and a 
lower equilibrium quantity 
result.

Extending the reasoning from the last unit produced to all units produced between  
Qoptimal and Qmarket, we arrive at the yellow-shaded region in Exhibit 9.3. This is the area 
between the marginal social cost curve and the market demand curve between units Q­optimal 
and Qmarket. The triangle represents the sum of the losses for each unit—the difference be-
tween the total marginal cost and total marginal benefits to society as a whole. Thus, the 
yellow-shaded triangle represents the deadweight loss of the negative externality. As a way 
to check your work, the deadweight loss is usually in the form of a triangle with the arrow 
pointing in the direction that society would prefer. In the case depicted in Exhibit 9.3, the 
arrow of the triangle points leftward, meaning society prefers less production than the free 
market provides.
One important feature of this discussion is that pollution is not driven to zero—that is 
not the goal. Rather, the optimal solution calls for us to recognize the marginal cost of the 
pollution externality to society. Upon recognizing the marginal external cost, as in this 
­example, it is often the case that we are left with some pollution. This is for two main rea-
sons: pollutants in moderate dosages are in many cases not very damaging, and it is very 
costly to produce some goods without releasing any pollution.
A “Broken” Invisible Hand: Positive Externalities
There are important situations that are a mirror image of negative externalities—positive 
externalities, which occur when an economic activity has a spillover benefit that is not 
considered when people make their own decisions. As with negative externalities, posi-
tive externalities are all around us. For instance, a resident of Sarasota who landscapes her 
property will probably enhance the value of her neighbors’ property, even though they had 
nothing to do with the decision to landscape.
Another important example of a positive externality is educational attainment, which 
not only helps a student through better employment opportunities and higher wages but 
also confers significant benefits on others. These benefits can come in many forms, but the 
ones most often cited are the following:
	
1.	 Education often increases civic engagement, thereby contributing to a more 
­informed democratic society.
	
2.	 An educated workforce is vital for innovation and adoption of new technologies.
	
3.	 An educated citizenry will be less likely to commit crime.
Among economists and policymakers, the positive externality argument is a commonly 
cited justification for government involvement in education. To show why, let’s begin with 
Exhibit 9.4, which illustrates the market demand and market supply curves for education. 
Exhibit 9.3 Deadweight Loss 
Due to a Negative Externality
In producing the last unit of 
production a deadweight 
loss of $0.10 resulted. Doing 
a similar exercise for all units 
produced to the right of the 
social optimal production level 
(Qoptimal), we can graphically 
represent the deadweight loss 
as the yellow triangle.

For clarity, let’s continue with the assumption that education is a perfectly competitive 
market. Therefore, Qmarket is an efficient outcome: with no externalities, the invisible hand 
is driving the market to an efficient equilibrium.
In the case of positive externalities, however, the invisible 
hand does not yield socially efficient results. This is because pos-
itive externalities create external social benefits that are reaped 
by others. Exhibit 9.5 reveals an example of positive externali-
ties, which can be thought of as the difference between the de-
mand curve (which is marginal benefit) and the marginal social 
benefit (MSB) curve. Therefore, the MSB curve is the marginal  
(private) benefit plus the marginal external benefit: MSB = 
­marginal benefit + marginal external benefit.
Consider Exhibit 9.5 more closely. The efficient amount of education from the view-
point of society is given by Qoptimal. This is where society’s marginal benefit from another 
unit of education equals the marginal cost of producing that unit of education. But this 
Exhibit 9.4 The Market 
Equilibrium for Education
As in Exhibit 9.1, we depict 
a market without externali-
ties. The optimal production 
is reached where the market 
demand curve for education 
intersects the market supply 
curve for education.

Features of an educated populace,

benefits. Graphically, this means 
that the marginal social benefit

mand curve for any amount of 
production. This leads to an under-
production of education, leading 
to a deadweight loss to society, 
equal to the yellow triangle.

won’t be the same as the equilibrium quantity in a free market. The education industry 
will only produce until its marginal cost equals the private demand for education, not the 
social demand. This is because the industry can only sell its output to education buyers. 
For practical reasons, it cannot charge people who enjoy the external benefit of education 
production—those people who benefit from a more informed citizenry or less crime, for 
example.
We can now see the inefficiency created by not recognizing the positive externality. 
Even though there are years of education (between Qmarket and Qoptimal) from which ­marginal  
social benefits are greater than the marginal cost to produce, these years are never produced 
and consumed. As a result, the market quantity will be too low relative to the socially  
efficient level, as seen in Exhibit 9.5, resulting in a deadweight loss.
We can compute the deadweight loss in much the same way as we did in the case of 
negative externalities. Consider Exhibit 9.5 once again, and let’s begin with the equilibrium 
quantity level, Qmarket. In the free market, this was the unit of production that equated will-
ingness to pay for that unit of education with the marginal cost of producing that unit of 
education ($40,000 = $40,000). But with the positive externality, we see that the marginal 
benefit to society is $60,000 ($40,000 private + $20,000 external benefit) for the last unit 
of education that was purchased. This means that if we would produce that last unit, we 
would increase social well-being by $20,000 = $60,000 − $40,000 (the marginal social 
benefit of the last unit − the marginal social cost of the last unit).
In fact, with the higher marginal benefit due to the positive externalities, we see that we 
should keep producing because the marginal gains to society are greater than the marginal 
costs to produce. This reasoning continues until we reach point Qoptimal. The amount of 
economic benefit that could be gained if we produced the optimal quantity is shown in the 
yellow-shaded region of the exhibit. This is the area between the marginal social benefit 
curve and the marginal cost curve between units Qmarket to Qoptimal. This area reflects how 
Externalities are the result of agents trying to do the best 
they can and ignoring how their actions affect others. In 
this sense, it would be wrong to think of externalities as 
“mistakes.” Externalities may result from just not knowing 
the harm we cause others. In this case, we might make 
choices that we later regret.
Consider the case of flu vaccinations. When you make 
the decision of whether or not to be vaccinated against 
the flu, you likely consider only the private benefits and 
costs from the vaccination—namely, the benefits or costs 
to yourself. But you are not the only person to incur ben-
efits or costs.
If you decide to take the flu shot, others gain: once you 
are vaccinated, they are now protected against catching 
the flu from you. But people can also lose if you choose 
not to get the shot, because you could catch the flu and 
spread it. Many of us would not take such externalities—
whether positive or negative—into account when making 
a decision about whether to get a flu shot. But they nev-
ertheless exist.
Researchers who have studied the externalities of vac-
cinations report quite large effects.2 For instance, in cer-
tain situations, the external effect of you getting a flu shot 
can be as high as 1.5 infections. Given that approximately 
10 percent to 20 percent of the U.S. population contracts 
the flu each year, this estimate reveals the potential value 
in flu vaccination programs.
If you find it important to take account of your own exter-
nalities, the next time you are weighing your private benefits 
and costs of getting a flu vaccination, remember that not get-
ting a shot could result in as many as 1.5 more infections for 
everyone else. In this sense, by avoiding the needle you have 
imposed a great externality on the rest of the population—
even some of those who have gotten the shot!

much society could increase social surplus if it produced at the efficient level. Again, you 
will notice that deadweight loss takes the form of a triangle with the arrow pointing in the 
direction that society would prefer.
Pecuniary Externalities
You might be thinking as you read this chapter that every market action has an externality. 
For example, if millions of new consumers decide to buy iPods, market demand will shift 
rightward, increasing price. If you were planning on buying an iPod, these consumers have 
just imposed a negative externality on you!
This is good intuition. Every market does have this type of externality, at least in the 
short run. Economists think of this kind of externality as a different animal compared to the 
externality examples above. The two types of externalities we have just studied have much 
different implications—they create market inefficiencies.
The example of more people buying a good and thereby causing a negative market 
impact for others is called a pecuniary externality. Pecuniary externalities exist when 
market transactions affect other people, but only through the market price. This defin-
ing attribute of pecuniary externalities—that they act only through prices—is critically 
important. It means that pecuniary externalities do not create market inefficiencies. 
Here’s why.
Remember that negative and positive externalities lead to “wrong” equilibrium quan-
tities. They do so because they create an external cost or external benefit that is not 
reflected in the market price. Pecuniary externalities don’t create these effects. Precisely 
because their impact is completely embodied in prices, the market price correctly reflects 
the society-wide impact of market transactions. You could say that pecuniary externali-
ties are necessary for efficient markets because as goods become more or less scarce their 
price should change. Negative and positive externalities, such as pollution and educa-
tion, cause market inefficiencies because goods are either over or under produced and 
consumed.
A pecuniary externality occurs 
when a market transaction affects 
other people only through market 
prices.
When externalities are present, the market outcome is inefficient. Exhibits 9.3 and 9.5 in 
the previous section reveal the inefficiencies of not taking externalities into account. Con-
ceptually, the exhibits show the following two important points:
	
1.	 When there are negative externalities present, free markets produce and consume 
too much.
	
2.	 When there are positive externalities present, free markets produce and consume 
too little.
If, in the presence of negative externalities, too much of a good is being produced, and 
in the presence of positive externalities, too little of a good is being produced, then how 
does society achieve a more efficient outcome? Several possibilities have emerged—some 
involve private citizens working it out themselves while others include government inter-
vention. In this section, we consider a number of private solutions.
One fundamental theme unites the multiple solutions to externalities, whether public 
or private: internalizing the externality. When individuals or companies take into account 
the full costs and benefits of their actions because of some public or private incentive, 
economists say that they are internalizing the externality. When the external effects of 
their actions are internalized, the general result is that the market equilibrium moves toward 
higher social well-being.
To understand how internalizing the externality works in the area of private solutions, 
we’ll consider the scenario of a power plant that is currently emitting tons of toxins in 
waterways, and this adversely affects local fishermen. Place yourself in the seat of a city 
mayor and think about what you would do if the fishermen came clamoring to you for help 
in curbing the plant’s emissions.

Your first thought might be to read the city pollution ordinances to check if there is a 
law against polluting the waterways. Say that upon doing so, you find that there is no such 
regulation—the power plant has the right to pollute for free. Thus, in actuality, the power 
plant has the right to pollute. Amazing!
Your next thought might be to impose laws that establish new regulations on the power 
plant. This is most people’s first instinct because a common misperception is that govern-
ment is the only source of change when, in fact, private organizations have affected change 
for years. Such private solutions to externality problems usually require parties to negotiate 
with one another or a social enforcement mechanism to be in place. Let’s see how bargain-
ing can work.
Private Solution: Bargaining
To gain a sense of how bargaining can work, we’ll continue with the power plant and 
­fishermen example. Say you discover the power plant can eliminate the toxins that it emits 
by purchasing and installing scrubbers (a technology that cleans water and air before they 
are released into the ecosystem). But scrubbers are expensive to purchase and maintain. 
The best cost estimate is that over the next decade, the cost of the necessary scrubbers will 
be $5 million. However, because the power plant holds the right to pollute by law, it does 
not have to install expensive equipment.
On the other side of the equation are the fishermen. Their scientists tell them the 
pollution has gotten to such dangerous levels that there is a chance the entire fishing 
industry could be shut down within a matter of years. Their analysis further tells them 
that the power plant is, in fact, the main culprit, emitting tons of toxins into the wa-
terways weekly. The fishermen conclude that if they can convince the power plant to 
install the scrubbers, they will receive benefits over the next decade of approximately 
$7 million.
In this case, what is the outcome if the fishermen and power plant do not communicate? 
Left to itself, the power plant is clearly not interested in spending $5 million on scrubbers 
because it does not gain from such a purchase. As you can see, this market outcome is not 
socially efficient because total well-being could be increased. In fact, the amount of money 
left on the table is $2 million ($7 million − $5 million). You might recall from Chapter 8 
that you can think of this as the gains to trade.
So does this mean that pollution will continue at the current rate because the power plant 
has the legal right to do what it desires? Can economics help solve this impasse? As it turns 
out, economics does play a critical role.
The legal rights do not have to be the deciding factor; a private deal can be struck. 
How can we be so sure? You know that fishermen are willing to pay up to $7 million to 
rid the waterways of the power plant’s pollution, whereas it costs the power plant only 
$5 million to abate pollution. Therefore, a deal will be brokered in which the fishermen 
give an amount of money between $5 million and $7 million to the power plant, and the 
power plant installs and maintains the scrubbers. What is not clear is where exactly in the 
$5-­million to $7-million price range the deal will be struck (as was observed in Chapter 8 
about the range of ­possible terms of trade).
Now let’s consider when the opposite case is at work: upon looking into the local ordi-
nances, say that you had found that there was a law against the power plant polluting the 
waterways. You would have then informed the power plant that it was out of compliance. If 
it chose at that point not to shut down, it would then have installed the scrubbers, thereby 
eliminating the water pollution.
The remarkable bottom line is that regardless of whether the law permits the power 
plant to pollute or not, the economically efficient outcome is achieved either way—the 
plant installs and maintains the scrubbers because abating pollution provides the highest 
social value.
The Coase Theorem
This insight—that negotiation leads to the socially efficient outcome regardless of who 
has the legal property right (ownership of property or resources)—is called the Coase 
­Theorem, after the Nobel Laureate economist who proposed it, Ronald Coase. The 
A property right gives someone 
ownership of a property or 
resources.
The Coase Theorem states that 
private bargaining will result in an 
efficient allocation of resources.

theorem’s implication is powerful: private bargaining will lead to 
an efficient allocation of resources. This means that the person 
who values ownership the most will end up owning the property 
right.
The end result of the Coase Theorem, then, is that government 
intervention is not necessary to solve externality problems—­
private bargaining can do the job. Although we reach the efficient 
outcome regardless of initial property rights, who holds the initial 
property rights is not irrelevant. This is because the initial prop-
erty right allocation is an important determinant of the distribu-
tion of surplus.
That said, we should be cautious about relying too much on private solutions to exter-
nalities for the following reasons:
	
1.	 The assumption that the parties involved—those creating the externality and those 
suffering from it—can negotiate economically is critically important. This means 
that as long as the transaction costs associated with negotiating aren’t too high, the 
efficient economic outcome can be achieved.
	
2.	 Whether the property right is clearly defined is important; in many cases, the law is 
not clear on who holds it.
	
3.	 The number of agents on each side of the bargaining table matters. It’s easy enough 
to imagine that bargaining can lead to an efficient solution with a small number 
of affected people. But it is more difficult to see how such bargaining could work 
between, say, a power plant and 100,000 affected fishermen.
The Coase Theorem applied to this situation would say that whether the plant has the right to 
pollute or the 100,000 fishermen have the right to clean water, the end result will be the effi-
cient amount of water quality. If the plant does have the right to pollute, then 100,000 fishermen  
must coordinate on how to pay the plant to cut back its emissions. If the fishermen have the 
right to clean water, then the power plant will have to pay them to be able to emit pollution if 
that is the efficient solution. But as a practical matter, it is difficult for 100,000 fishermen to 
somehow negotiate their own agreements with a plant about the ­allowable level of emissions 
and who gets compensated. In this case, a governmental rule might be the most efficient means 
to address the externality.
This is because the transaction costs associated with bargaining might be too high. 
Hence, even when property rights are perfectly established, the cost of bargaining itself—the 
transaction costs associated with making an economic exchange—might be too high to per-
mit this sort of arrangement from happening. This transaction cost not only includes direct 
expenditures, such as legal fees and your time, but also the cost of an awkward situation: 
it might be difficult to walk next door and bargain with your neighbor 
about the amount of dog droppings his pet can leave on your front yard. 
With this in mind, we turn to a second popular private means to address 
the market failure of externalities: social enforcement mechanisms.
Private Solution: Doing the Right Thing
Does the logo to the left look familiar? If you’ve seen it on your kitchen 
appliances, your computer, or your windows, you have approved energy-
efficient products. The ENERGY STAR program is a joint program in-
troduced in 1992 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
and the U.S. Department of Energy to promote energy-efficient products. 
ENERGY STAR is a voluntary labeling program designed to identify and 
promote energy-efficient products to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. 
The first kinds of products to be labeled ENERGY STAR were computers 
and monitors. The program now includes over 60 product categories, in-
cluding major appliances, office equipment, lighting, and home electron-
ics. Today, you can hardly miss the stickers when entering a workplace.
The ENERGY STAR program has worked both because there are 
financial incentives associated with such products (reduced electric-
ity cost and potential tax savings) and because it involves a social 
The end result of the Coase Theorem 
. . . is that government intervention 
is not necessary to solve externality 
problems—private bargaining can 
do the job.
Transaction costs are the costs  
of making an economic exchange.

enforcement mechanism: it gives us information about “green products” and invokes a 
moral code that you should “do the right thing” and purchase them. There are no official 
government regulations that tell people that they have to buy ENERGY STAR products, 
but the substantial growth in the program since 1992 is a testament to the power of motivat-
ing people to try to do their part for the environment. In economic language, the moral code 
of doing one’s part is internalizing externalities.
Once you give it some thought, you realize that social enforcement mechanisms are 
operating all around us and help us to take account of externalities. For instance, we will 
learn later in this chapter that private organizations such as the Sierra Club are quite suc-
cessful at protecting the environment. The charity Smile Train does incredible work with 
overseas children who have cleft palates. Closer to home, when waiting in line for a ride at 
Disney World or in a supermarket checkout line, we rarely observe people “line jumping.” 
People generally refrain from the practice not because there is a stiff financial penalty for 
doing so, but because their actions will likely be frowned upon by the people who bear the 
costs of their rudeness. Such socially imposed costs lead to a reduction in the quantity of 
line jumping to the net benefit of society. Shame, guilt, and the risk that we will be publicly 
decried are all effective social enforcement mechanisms. In particular, all of these social 
controls help to internalize the negative externality imposed on others, leading to less of 
such behavior.
Although private solutions can prove quite effective, direct government intervention 
might be necessary when private interventions fail. Such solutions usually take the form of 
rules that restrict production in some form, taxation, or requiring permits for production. 
We now consider several examples of government solutions to externalities.
Command-and-control regulation 
either directly restricts the level of 
production or mandates the use of 
certain technologies.
There are many ways in which markets fail, or at least fall short of the ideal competitive 
market outcomes ­described in Exhibits 9.1 and 9.4. Whenever markets fail, policymak-
ers need to consider the following question: can the government bring about a particular 
outcome more ­efficiently than the market? We have learned that there are potentially im-
portant private solutions to externalities, including bargaining over outcomes and relying 
on social enforcement mechanisms. Yet these also are apt to fall short in certain situations.
Governments respond to externalities in two main ways:
	
1.	 Command-and-control policies, in which the government directly regulates the 
­allocation of resources
	
2.	 Market-based policies, in which the government provides incentives for private 
organizations to internalize the externality
Let’s return to the case of the power plant’s release of pollutants. Suppose the plant also 
emits air pollutants that affect millions of households in neighboring states. In such a case, 
the costs are dispersed in a manner that makes private negotiations impossible. Put yourself 
in the shoes of the federal regulator and think about what you would do in this case: a situ-
ation in which you are certain that curbing the pollutant emissions from the plant will be 
beneficial to society. You will find yourself relying on the two major approaches just listed, 
to which we now turn in more detail.
Government Regulation: Command-and-Control Policies
If you knew that curbing emissions would benefit society, then you realize that  
Qmarket > Qoptimal, and an approach to lower the quantity produced (and thereby 
­pollution) is a step in the right direction. One common approach to solving this prob-
lem is by using command-and-control regulation. Under command-and-control 
­regulation, policymakers either directly restrict the level of production or mandate the 
use of certain technologies.

Many early environmental regulations, including the landmark clean water and 
clean air legislation of the 1970s, were command-and-control regulations. In this 
case, the government required polluters to adopt the best available pollution-reducing 
technologies. For example, the Clean Water Act stipulated exactly the types of tech-
nologies that each plant had to install if they were to continue operations. Similar 
regulations can be found in the various Clean Air Act Amendments. For example, 
under the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments, new polluting plants had to install certain 
abatement technologies.
As you might have guessed, there are many ways to regulate polluters, and the 
command-and-control technique might not be the most efficient course of regula-
tory action to curb pollution. For one thing, this type of regulatory action typically 
provides few incentives for producers to search for more cost-effective ways to re-
duce pollution itself. This happens because regulators have directed attention to the 
wrong target—they mandate the technology that the producer must use. This pushes 
the producer to develop efficient methods to use the mandated technology. Yet, rather 
than ­focusing producer efforts on developing cheaper ways to use the mandated tech-
nology, the regulator should incentivize producers to find or develop the most cost-
effective technologies.
Government Regulation: Market-Based Approaches
Given that you are interested in efficient regulation, you decide not to make use of the 
­command-and-control approach and instead turn to a market-based regulatory ­approach. 
A  market-based approach internalizes externalities by harnessing the power of market 
forces. What does this mean in terms of the power plant scenario? With the market-based 
approach, the method for reducing pollution is essentially left to the emitter—the power 
plant itself. Thus, there is a greater incentive to develop new ways to reduce pollution than 
in the command-and-control approach.
Corrective Taxes and Subsidies
The most prominent market-based approaches to dealing with externalities are corrective 
taxes and subsidies. Let’s return to the case of the local power plant. Because its produc-
tion is creating a negative externality, it is producing too much. So you want the power 
plant to cut back on production, because doing so moves the quantity produced toward 
the efficient level. You can do this through taxes on the production from the plant. Such 
government taxes are called corrective taxes or Pigouvian taxes, named after economist 
Arthur Pigou, a pioneer in describing how such taxes would work. A corrective tax is 
a tax designed to induce agents who produce negative externalities to reduce quantity 
­toward the socially optimal level.
Given that you understand there is an externality, what should you do? Your first step 
is to estimate the marginal external cost. Economists have developed tools to help policy-
makers calculate such costs, and below in the Letting The Data Speak box we discuss one 
example. In this case, let’s assume that policymakers estimate the marginal external cost as 
given in Exhibit 9.6. The next step is to levy a corrective tax in this amount to reduce the 
equilibrium quantity to the social optimum.
That is, you levy a per-unit tax equal to the marginal external cost of the externality—
which is $0.10 per unit, as shown in Exhibit 9.6. Because the level of the tax is equal to the 
difference between S and MSC, plants’ now choose a profit-maximizing output that is equal 
to Qoptimal. Looked at in another way, the Pigouvian tax creates a virtual market supply 
curve that is identical to the MSC curve by having each plant consider the externality when 
making production choices. They consider the externality because they account for the cor-
rective tax when making their production decisions. Thus, the tax exactly aligns private and 
society’s incentives. In effect, the corrective tax internalizes the pollution externality. This 
results in the efficient market outcome.
The same reasoning that holds for negative externalities also applies to positive ex-
ternalities: the government can use corrective subsidies or Pigouvian subsidies to 
internalize the externality. A corrective subsidy is designed to induce agents who pro-
duce positive externalities to increase quantity toward the socially optimal level. In the 
case of positive externalities, a subsidy is used to correct the externality.
A market-based regulatory 
approach internalizes externalities 
by harnessing the power of market 
forces.
Corrective taxes or Pigouvian 
taxes, is a tax designed to induce 
agents who produce negative 
externalities to reduce quantity 
toward the socially optimal level.

Exhibit 9.6 Effect of a Pigouvian Tax
As the social planner, you understand that 
you must internalize externalities. One solu-
tion is to tax each unit of production by the 
amount of the negative externality. Such a 
tax allows the externality to be internalized, 
resulting in a more efficient outcome.
Let’s return to the case of education, which is shown in Exhibit 9.7. In this case, what 
should you do? Much like when there is a negative externality, you need to first estimate 
the marginal social benefit of education. Upon doing so, the next step is to levy a corrective 
subsidy in this amount to increase the equilibrium quantity to the social optimum.
That is, you levy a per-unit subsidy equal to the marginal social benefit of the 
­externality—which is $20,000 per year, as shown in Exhibit 9.7. This is the difference be-
tween D and MSB. Again, because the level of the subsidy is equal to this difference, indi-
viduals now have an incentive to choose the socially efficient level of education, or Q­optimal. 
In this manner, the Pigouvian subsidy creates a virtual demand curve that is identical to 
the MSB curve by having individuals consider the externality when making their education 
choices. You consider the externality because when deciding whether to obtain more years 
A key challenge to policymakers is estimating the exter-
nal costs or benefits of an activity. For instance, in the 
case of air pollution from the local power plant, how do 
policymakers know the costs of lower air quality? One ap-
proach is to examine how prices of goods that trade in 
markets are affected by air quality. This is exactly what 
economists Kenneth Chay and Michael Greenstone did 
to evaluate the value of cleaning up of various types of air 
pollution after the Clean Air Act of 1970.3 Before 1970, 
there was little federal regulation of air pollution, and 
the issue was not high on the agenda of state legislators. 
As a result, many counties allowed factories to operate 
without any regulation on their pollution, and in several 
heavily industrialized counties, pollution had reached 
very high levels. In particular, in many urban counties, air 
pollution, as measured by the amount of total suspended 
particles had reached dangerous levels.
The clean air act established guidelines for what consti-
tuted excessively high levels of five particularly dangerous 
pollutants, and according to these guidelines, the Environ-
mental Protection Agency and the states would enforce re-
ductions in total suspended particle quantities in counties 
that were in “non-compliant” status. Following the Act in 
1970 and the 1977 amendment that strengthened the im-
plementation of the Act, requiring any increasing emissions 
coming from new investments to be offset by reductions 
in emissions from other sources in the same county, there  
were improvements in air quality (again gauged by total 
suspended particle measure). 
Chay and Greenstone then investigate how housing 
prices changed in the counties where, because of the 
Clear Air Act, there was a large improvement in air quality. 
They find significant improvements in house prices (and no 
­appreciable change in average county incomes). As a ­result, 
they estimate that there was approximately $45  ­billion 
­aggregate increase in housing values because of the Clean 
Air Act. Policymakers make use of such estimates to help 
guide their choices of corrective taxes and subsidies.

of schooling, you take account of the corrective subsidy. Thus, the subsidy exactly aligns 
your and society’s incentives. In effect, the corrective subsidy internalizes the positive ex-
ternality. This results in the efficient market outcome.
As you likely know firsthand, such incentives are often put to use in practice. The fed-
eral government subsidizes education tremendously, beginning in pre-kindergarten classes  
and up through the PhD. The creative ways in which such government subsidies are struc-
tured range from funding public education to special government college scholarships 
to highly subsidized school loans. All of this occurs because the government is trying to 
If you have any roommates, you’re probably well aware of 
a perfect setting for a Pigouvian tax: trash. In particular, 
you and your roommates probably throw out lots of stuff, 
and when the trash can gets full, it’s often a lot of work to 
carry the bag of trash out to the dumpster or trash can. 
Sometimes roommates anticipate this cost and just let 
the trash in the can pile higher and higher.
Ultimately someone has to take it out, though, and 
there is often no great mechanism to incentivize this be-
havior. Cities have a similar problem, but on a much more 
massive scale. Namely, people buy and throw out tons of 
stuff and disposing of all that trash isn’t free. In an attempt 
to reduce this waste and the cost it imposes, cities have 
adopted Pigouvian taxes that have been called “Pay-As-
You-Throw.” These programs charge people a small price 
for each bag of trash that they produce. That price, of 
course, is the cost to the city for disposing of each bag, 
and in theory, this sort of tax should move people to in-
ternalize the cost of their behavior on the city.
Pay-As-You-Throw programs have been run in 4,032 
communities in 43 states, covering about 10 percent of 
the population in the United States, and the overwhelming 
conclusion is that these programs reduce the amount 
of trash people throw out. One survey of communities 
suggested that moving to a Pay-As-You-Throw program 
­reduced household trash by more than a ton per year!4
This reduction comes in part from a reduction in waste cre-
ation but also an increase in recycling. All told, the Pigouvian 
tax on trash does seem to accomplish what Pigou theorized 
so long ago—that with a corrective tax, consumer decisions 
will start to move toward the social optimum.

Once a non-excludable good 
is produced, it is not possible to 
exclude people from using the good.
A non-rival good is a good whose 
consumption by one person does 
not prevent consumption by others.
A public good is both non-rival and 
non-excludable.
Many people from the Midwest are familiar with the blare of a tornado siren signaling that a 
funnel cloud is swirling toward their city. Once the siren sounds, no one can exclude others 
from hearing it, and one person hearing the siren does not affect the ability of others to hear 
it. These two properties—that no one can prevent others from consumption and that one per-
son’s consumption doesn’t prevent another person’s consumption—distinguish public goods. 
They are different from the goods we’ve studied so far—private goods—which are traded in 
markets where buyers and sellers meet and, if they agree on price, ownership is transferred.
To understand the nature of a public good, it is useful to compare and contrast public 
goods and private goods in more detail. There are two characteristics that differentiate them:
	
1.	 Excludability: Private goods are excludable, meaning that people can be kept from con-
suming them if they have not paid for them. Public goods are non-excludable, meaning 
that once they are produced, it is not possible to exclude people from using them.
	
2.	 Rivalry in consumption: Private goods are rival in consumption, meaning that they 
cannot be consumed by more than one person at a time. Public goods are non-rival 
in consumption, meaning that one person’s consumption does not preclude con-
sumption by others.
To summarize, we can say that private goods are excludable and rival in consumption and 
public goods are non-excludable and non-rival in consumption.
We provide Exhibit 9.8 to aid in our thinking about different types of goods in the 
economy based on their degree of excludability and rivalry. Let’s look at the four categories 
of goods in the exhibit in more detail.
(1) Ordinary private goods, shown in the upper-left corner of Exhibit 9.8, are both highly 
excludable and highly rival in consumption. Think about a Snickers candy bar that you 
have just purchased at the book store: once you purchase and eat that specific candy bar, 
no one else can; you have perfectly excluded others from buying that particular ­Snickers

encourage education in an attempt to correct the market failure 
that occurs when you make your education choices.
In sum, externalities potentially drive a wedge between 
social benefits and costs and private benefits and costs. This 
wedge creates a distortion (deadweight loss) if the free market 
equilibrium quantity levels diverge from the social optimum 
quantity levels. Corrective taxes and subsidies can cause agents 
to internalize their externalities. In using such taxes, the govern-
ment raises tax revenues, but that is not its main goal. Rather, it 
is attempting to align private and social incentives. To do so, it 
critically relies on estimates of externalities. A vibrant area of 
research within economics continues to develop to estimate the 
costs and benefits of externalities. How would you estimate the 
dollar value of externalities?

bar. Thus, your consumption has reduced the ability of another person to consume the  
candy bar; in fact, your consumption has created a one-to-one reduction in Snickers bars 
­available to others. A large fraction of the goods and services that we buy and sell in the 
market economy have these same properties, and that is why we have implicitly assumed 
this to be the case when modeling demand and supply in previous chapters.
(2) In the lower-left corner of the exhibit, we find another category of goods—those 
that are highly excludable but non-rival in consumption. We call such excludable, non-rival 
goods club goods—economists also commonly refer to them as “artificially scarce” goods. 
For instance, perhaps after you read this chapter, you will turn on the television to watch 
your favorite cable television show. In so doing, you will not affect the ability of others to 
watch that same show. Therefore, cable TV is a non-rival good because many people can 
watch at the same time without disrupting the ability of others to watch. However, individu-
als can be excluded from watching cable TV if they do not pay for the service. Thus, it is 
a good that is excludable. Club goods present a bit of a conundrum when sold as a private 
good. They are non-rival, so the marginal cost of providing one extra unit is small (perhaps 
even zero), but they tend to require large fixed costs, like wiring cable all around the world 
for cable TV. If sold at marginal cost, firms would never cover the large fixed costs they 
bear. Consumers oftentimes have a positive willingness-to-pay for such goods, though. As 
a result, club goods typically are not sold in perfectly competitive markets.
(3) The upper-right corner shows a category of goods called common pool resource 
goods, which are non-excludable but rival in consumption. For instance, an open-access 
lake is available to all fishermen, but the fish they catch cannot be caught by another fisher-
man and are thus rival. Likewise, if you are at a picnic, what happens when the hamburgers 
run out? You are left with your second choice, a hot dog. We discuss this type of good in 
further detail later in the chapter.
(4) A much different class of goods appears in the lower-right corner of the exhibit—
public goods. Recall that they are goods that are non-rival in consumption and are non-
excludable. Consider protecting the earth from climate change. Governments around the 
world spend billions of dollars annually to curb harmful greenhouse gases. Even if people 
failed to pay their taxes to support such environmental programs, governments cannot ex-
clude them from enjoying the benefits. That is, while cable television is an excludable 
good, enjoying earth’s comfortable climate is not. National defense and local warning sys-
tems are other examples of public goods that we enjoy daily.
Public goods present particular problems for markets to provide because consumers  
do not see the value proposition in buying them. When purchasing a Nintendo DS, it is 
clear what you get for your $100. What are you getting if you send in $100 to the U.S. gov-
ernment for national defense? You will be protected by the Defense Department regardless 
of whether you sent in the cash. And because your $100 makes no appreciable difference 
between a successful and unsuccessful national defense system, you likely will not send in 
$100 in the first place. Why send $100 to the U.S. government and receive little in return 
when you can send the same $100 to Amazon.com and get a ­Nintendo DS game system?
This example represents a key problem with efficiently providing public goods: we 
want them, but we aren’t willing to pay for them because we can’t be excluded from 
consuming them once they are provided. And the same is true for everyone. Thus, public 
goods suffer from what economists call a free-rider problem, in which a person has no 
incentive to pay for a good because failure to pay doesn’t prevent consumption. Free rid-
ers either consume more than their fair share or pay less than their fair share of its cost.
Such cases represent situations in which government intervention can potentially raise 
social surplus. But how much of the public good should the government provide if it wants to 
maximize social surplus? Are there other ways to provide it? We turn to these questions now.
Government Provision of Public Goods
What makes public goods different from private goods is precisely their non-rival and 
non-excludable nature. Their non-excludability represents a distinct opportunity for gov-
ernment to step in and provide them because it can levy taxes for their provision. Standard 
cost-benefit logic applies to the case of providing public goods: the government should 
expand production until marginal benefits equal marginal costs. That is, if the marginal 
benefits exceed the marginal costs of providing the next unit, it should be provided.
A club good is non-rival but 
excludable.
Common pool resource goods are 
a class of goods that are rival and 
non-excludable.
A free-rider problem occurs when 
an individual who has no incentive 
to pay for a good does not pay for 
that good because nonpayment 
does not prevent consumption.

Conceptually, we can calculate the optimal level of public good provision once we know 
the market demand curve and the marginal costs associated with providing various levels 
of a public good. To construct the market demand curve, we must first know the individual 
demand curves. Before doing so, let’s revisit how we constructed the market demand curve 
for private goods.
Recall in that case that we added horizontally. That is, we summed the total quantity 
demanded of all consumers at a given price to compute the market demand at that price.

economics lab experiment with the hope of earning some 
cash. The moderator gives each of you ten dollars and 
explains that you can anonymously, and simultaneously, 
contribute any portion of it back to a public goods (or 
group) account. The contributions collected will be dou-
bled and then redistributed equally among you and the 
nine other students.5
For example, if you each contribute half of your endow-
ment, or $5, to the group account, it then contains $50 = 
10 × $5. After the doubling, that would mean that $100 is 
to be split equally between all 10 players. In the end, you 
walk away with $15: $10 from the group account and the 
$5 you opted not to put into the group account.
How much of your $10 would you contribute?
It is clear that to maximize the group’s take-home earn-
ings, everyone should contribute the full ten dollars to 
the group fund. This would increase the total money 
earned in the experiment from $100 to $200, or $20 per 
person. Why, then, do experiments show that contribu-
tions average less than two dollars, with around half of 
the participants contributing nothing?
For the group, the marginal benefit of contributing 
outweighs the marginal cost of contributing. But, for the 
individual that isn’t the case. If you give $1 to the group 
account, then the group as a whole receives $2 (a mar-
ginal benefit of $1), but you yourself are only guaranteed 
20 cents of that dollar back. That is, by contributing that 
$1 to the group account you cost yourself 80 cents!
Armed with this knowledge, you can see that you can 
maximize your take-home earnings by contributing noth-
ing to the group account.
Let’s walk through a simple illustration. Let’s just as-
sume that everyone else contributes everything to the 
group account. What are your payoffs if you contribute 
nothing versus if you contribute everything?
Contribute zero payoff:
$10 + $90 * 2
10
= $28.
Contribute everything payoff:
$0 + $100 * 2
10
= $20.
As you can see, by free riding and contributing nothing 
to the public good, you are $8 better off versus when you 
contribute everything.
Because the same incentives are alive in the real world 
when it comes to public goods, it is not surprising that 
many of us are free-riders!

Exhibit 9.10 Constructing a Market Demand Curve for 
a Public Good
Public goods need to be valued based on the marginal 
benefit that a single unit of the good provides to society. 
For this reason, market demand curves for public goods 
are added along the vertical axis, producing a total  
willingness to pay for each unit of the public good.

demand curve for pairs of jeans, and panel (b) contains Jim’s 
demand curve for pairs of jeans. For simplicity, both curves 
are drawn smoothly even though it would be hard for you to 
buy 2.5 pairs of jeans. At a price of $50, you demand 3 pairs 
and Jim demands 3 pairs. This leads to a total market de-
mand of 6 pairs at $50, as depicted in panel (c) of the exhibit. 
Upon summing all of the quantities demanded horizontally, 
we are left with the market demand curve in panel (c).
Construction of the market demand curve for public goods 
follows similar logic. However, the nature of public goods’ 
non-rivalry and non-excludability matters a great deal when 
moving from the individual to the market demand curve for 
public goods. Instead of summing horizontally, as is the case 
for private goods, the market demand for public goods is 
found by vertically summing the individual demand curves. 
This is necessary because the public good is non-rival, so 
you and Jim can each consume every unit of the good at the 
same time. Therefore, to arrive at a market demand curve, 
we add the individual demand curves vertically because this 
gives us a measure of the amount of money consumers are 
willing to pay for each unit of the public good.
Let’s put this intuition into action. Assume that we are 
again talking about you and Jim, but now we are consid-
ering the demand for space missions, a public good that 
potentially leads to new insights that will help all of man-
kind (by unlocking the mysteries of space, that are non- 
excludable and non-rival). For comparison purposes, assume  
that you and Jim have exactly the same demand curve for 
space missions as you had for jeans, again made smooth for 
simplicity.
Exhibit 9.10 shows your demand curve for space mis-
sions in panel (a), Jim’s in panel (b), and the market demand 
curve for the public good in panel (c). At each level of pub-
lic good provision, the market demand curve tells us how 
much the market would be willing to pay for an additional 
unit of the public good.
As you can see, because you value the first space mission  
at $70, and Jim also values it at $70, the total marginal benefit  
for this first space mission trip is $140, as shown in panel (c). 
This is called the market demand for one unit because it is 
the total amount of money consumers are willing to pay for 
the first unit of the public good. Likewise, you value the third 
space ­mission at $50, and Jim values it at $50. Therefore,  
the marginal benefit to society of this third space mission 
is $100, as shown in panel (c). In other words, prices are 
summed at each quantity level on the individual demand 
curves to derive the market demand curve for public goods.
To compute exactly how much of the public good the 
government should provide, the supply (marginal cost 
curve) of space missions must be plotted alongside the 
market demand curve for space missions. We do this in  
Exhibit 9.11. To compute the equilibrium level of space 
missions, we follow our decision principles discussed  
earlier: we should expand the number of space missions un-
til the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost, which occurs at Qoptimal in Exhibit 9.11. 
At this point, total surplus is maximized because all of the gains in the market are reaped. 
This is because quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, or marginal benefits equal 
marginal costs. In the next chapter, we explore the ­different ways in which the government 
can raise funds to pay for public goods such as space missions.

Private Provision of Public Goods
Over breakfast, you might listen to National Public Radio (NPR). If so, you likely have 
learned about the rain forests of Borneo, Indonesia, or the Amazon, which are being pur-
chased by private organizations as an attempt to preserve them from being clear-cut. Or 
perhaps you have heard about recent breakthroughs of researchers working to cure cancer. 
Each of these activities, and many more that provide private goods with positive externali-
ties or provide public goods, are funded by private sources.
Although governments importantly provide public goods, they are not the sole provid-
ers. Many public goods are routinely provided through other channels, such as private 
donations, which are, indeed, an effective way to provide public goods. Private provision 
of public goods refers to any situation in which private citizens make contributions to 
the production or maintenance of a public good. There are many avenues for such provi-
sion, but the most important is through private donations of time and money. For example, 
through private donations, NPR is provided all around the United States. Globally, rain 
forests are being saved through private cash donations to the World Wildlife Fund. Cures 
for ailments ranging from carpal tunnel syndrome to heart disease have been made in part 
from individuals donating dollars for research funds.
So what is the scope of private donations of money? Exhibit 9.12 shows the tremen-
dous growth in charitable giving in the United States over a 40-year period. Since 1971,

Once the market demand and sup-

­missions are set, we can rely on the 
decision rules that we’ve learned 
so far to find the optimal amount 
of space missions for society. This 
­quantity will be at the intersection of 
the market demand and market sup-
ply curves, where the marginal ben-
efit of the last space mission equals 
the marginal cost.

individual contributions to charitable causes have increased from roughly $125 billion an-
nually to approximately $300 billion per year by 2011. Even though the recent giving 
levels already represent an important fraction of our economy, experts predict that the 
combination of increased wealth and an aging population will lead to an even higher level 
of giving in the coming years.
But there is more to the world than just the United States. How does giving in the 
United States compare to giving rates in other countries around the world? We must be 
careful when making such comparisons; differences could arise because some countries 
use taxes to fund more public goods than others. In this case, all else being equal, we 
should expect low-tax countries to have fewer public goods provided by the government 
and more public goods provided by charitable giving. Likewise, many people volunteer 
time to a charitable cause rather than give money. With such considerations in mind, 
we consider one of the most comparable data sets across countries. In 2010, the polling 
company Gallup asked people all over the world one simple question: “Have you donated 
money to a charity in the past month?” Exhibit 9.13 shows that a majority of people an-
swer, “Yes” in developed countries. Even in underdeveloped countries, the proportion of 
people giving is above 10 percent, suggesting that donations to charity are an important 
phenomenon all over the world.
You might be thinking that considering the voluntary nature of giving, this form of 
public good provision might be preferred to governments providing public goods. But we 
should be careful with this line of reasoning because there might be certain important 
public goods, such as national defense or local weather alerts, that will be considerably 
underprovided if left to private sources.
An example can help us understand the danger of leaving public good provision en-
tirely in the hands of the private market. Many scientists believe that species are cur-
rently going extinct at a faster rate than at any time in the history of our planet, with the 
exception of cataclysmic encounters, such as collisions with extraterrestrial objects or 
massive volcanic eruptions. To deal with this problem, hundreds of conservation groups 
have been formed with the help of private donations. Which types of species do you 
think their donors are most likely to help? The answer, interestingly, is that charismatic 
species and those that most resemble humans, such as panda bears and monkeys, receive 
the most support. If such funding comes at the expense of funding keystone species—
species that play an important role in the ecosystem—it will be dangerous for the vitality 
of our ecosystem. Of course, the government is not perfect either, and we return to this 
very issue in the next chapter.

The tragedy of the commons 
results when common pool 
resources are dramatically overused.
Which Species Would You Rather Preserve?
Potential donors tend to support charismatic species, such as panda bears, rather than 
keystone species, such as ochre sea stars, that do not have as much visual appeal.
Another important class of goods that are related to public goods are common pool resource  
goods. As summarized in Exhibit 9.8, common pool resource goods are not excludable, so 
anyone can consume as much of them as they can find—for example, urban parking places, 
coral reefs, and hamburgers at a student picnic. Unfortunately, common pool resources are 
rival goods, meaning that every Diet Coke that Jack drinks at the student party results in 
one less Diet Coke for others to drink. This leads to an important negative externality that 
Jack imposes on all others.
The externality involved with a common pool resource arises because of the combi-
nation of open access and depletion through use. When deciding how much to fish in a 
lake, for example, people using the lake consider only their own private marginal costs 
of use. But this use depletes the resource for everyone. This is a classic negative external-
ity: individuals use too much of the resource because they do not consider how others are 
­affected. This result is analogous to the free-market equilibrium quantity being higher than 
the optimal equilibrium quantity in our earlier examples of negative externalities. Because 
everyone accessing the lake creates this same externality with their own use, the total use 
of the lake is above what is socially optimal.
Other examples abound in the world around us: too much water is extracted from aqui-
fers, too many trees are cut on public lands, too many communications devices jam air-
waves, too many donuts are eaten by one individual from the office donut box, and so on. 
Such overuse can result in the tragedy of the commons, which occurs when a common 
resource is used too intensely. In some cases, the consequences of this overuse can be 
severe: instead of preserving a sustainable fishery, for example, complete populations and 
even whole species can be destroyed by overfishing. It’s not that fishermen prefer to drive 
their prey to extinction; in fact, they obviously would prefer a vibrant population. But 
depletion like this can result because of the presence of a negative externality—in this 
case, too many users of the resource.
Solutions to the tragedy of the commons are similar to those discussed earlier in the 
chapter for some types of externalities. These interventions can be used by governments 
or other organized public or private regulatory bodies. For example, a Pigouvian tax can 
be applied to every fish that is taken out of Lake Michigan. Or, because users of com-
mon pool resources have incentives to join together to self-regulate use of the resource, 
it might be possible for people to organize a system that implements a maximum catch 
in any given year.

In medieval times property rights were poorly defined. 
Typically, royalty controlled all the property and through 
arcane mechanisms land was divvied up for use. The fact 
that the market was not allowed to act led to some ­bizarre 
practices, perhaps none as famous to social scientists as 
the management of feeding livestock.
Livestock were the lifeblood of any community, offering 
dairy and meat, but this came at a cost, namely, livestock 
had to be fed, typically by grazing the land. And those 
who owned livestock were frequently required to feed 
them in a common patch of land.
This reliance on common land led to perverse ­incentives. 
In particular, owners of livestock could purchase an extra 
goat or cow and reap all the rewards privately. That ex-
tra livestock had to graze somewhere, though, and the 
cost of lost grazing land was born equally by all in the 
community. Thus, the common grazing area would slowly 
but surely be overused.
This phenomenon became known as the tragedy of the 
commons, a term popularized by an ecologist, Garrett 
Hardin, but the example of livestock overgrazing com-
mon land comes from a nineteenth-century essay by the 
early British economist William Forster Lloyd.6
What makes the tragedy of the commons so tragic isn’t 
just economic inefficiencies. It’s that, at the extreme, the 
owners of livestock could one day find themselves with 
nowhere to feed their animals because of overgrazing. 
The same perverse incentive structure is at work in many 
real-world situations.
Can you name some? What economic tools can we use 
to solve the tragedy of the commons?
CHOICE & CONSEQUENCE
Tragedy of the Commons
Imagine that you are a fisherman who owns a private pond 
fully stocked with 100 bluegill fish. Because you own the 
property rights to the pond, you are the only one who can 
fish at the pond. Therefore, you can catch as many bluegill as 
you want. But you know that in the late spring in 70°F water, 
the female deposits around 40,000 eggs in a shallow nest 
near the sandy shore. Two to six days later, the eggs hatch 
and the male guards the young fry during their first days.
Knowing this, how many fish will you catch?
You will likely not decide to catch all of the bluegill, 
instead leaving many in the pond to restock your supply 
for the next season.
Now imagine that this pond is a common pool 
­resource—anyone and everyone can fish from it, and one 
more fish on another angler’s line means one less fish on 
yours. Would you still be careful to leave a lot of fish in the 
pond for next season?
Both real-world situations and lab experiments con-
ducted by Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom have shown us 
that you probably wouldn’t.7,8 After all, if you decide to 
leave, say, 50 fish in the pond, who is to stop another 
fisherman from catching those fish?
This line of thinking may lead everyone to keep fishing 
until there is absolutely nothing left. As you just learned, this 
type of situation is referred to as the tragedy of the com-
mons; a dilemma in which multiple individuals acting in their 
own self-interest deplete a shared limited resource when in 
the long run it isn’t in anyone’s best interest to do so.
How might the fishermen in our example prevent this 
from happening?
CHOICE & CONSEQUENCE
The Race to Fish
When feasible, outright privatization of the resource—turning its control over to a 
single owner—can also work. Ownership eliminates the externality problem because 
any depletion from use is borne by the owner, who controls access to the resource. It 
gives the owner incentives to regulate access in a way that maximizes the resource’s 
value to the owner. Because efficient use of the resource creates the biggest “pie” for the 
owner—that is, maximizes what users are collectively willing to pay to access it—the 
owner has the incentive to encourage an efficient level of use.

n the late 1990s, traffic became so congested in central London that travel times 
dipped below the nineteenth-century average—before the introduction of the car!9 
Elected on a reformist platform, London’s mayor vowed to make a strong play for 
fixing London’s traffic woes once and for all.
As we learned in this chapter, the basic theory behind externalities is straightforward: 
if there is a negative externality that you wish to solve, a Pigouvian tax can internalize 
the externality. In this case, the negative externality is that drivers enter the road without 
regard to how their presence is affecting others. Thus, a Pigouvian tax can help lesson 
the congestion problem.
This may sound simple, but translating economic theory to the real world can some-
times be challenging. One problem to be solved in London was how to charge for use of 
the roads. Simple tollbooths can often create just as many traffic jams as they are tasked 
to prevent.
Another question to answer was what the size of the tax should be. London settled for 
a daily flat charge of 5 pounds per day (although this was later increased to 10 pounds 
per day with hybrid vehicles paying no tax).10 This fee was called a “congestion charge.” 
Although one might argue that instead of a daily usage tax the government should have 
charged a mileage-based tax, policymakers decided that for the sake of simplicity, they 
would charge a daily usage tax. And to avoid creating unnecessary congestion, the daily 
charge would be enforced with the use of video cameras at roads on the outside of the 
city. Drivers would have to buy a daily pass at retail outlets, online, or with their cell 
phones, and drivers caught without having a daily pass were charged heavy fines.
How did it all turn out? Exhibit 9.14 provides some summary details. Comparing 
traffic patterns the year before the congestion charge was implemented to the year after, 
total traffic had been reduced by 12 percent, and this gain was mostly due to lower auto-
mobile traffic. All in all, economists estimated that the congestion charges had reduced 
traffic circulating in the city center by 15 percent and traffic entering the zone by 18 
percent. Also important in analyzing the benefits of the policy was its impact on the 
reliability of travel (or the variability of travel time), which improved by an average of 
30 percent.
As Exhibit 9.14 shows, the introduction of the congestion tax had an effect of in-
creasing the use of public transportation. As drivers became discouraged from driving 
into the city because of the congestion charge, they began relying on buses. In addition, 
more people chose to travel by bicycle. All in all, the program has been a huge success; 
the Queen of England can now get to Wembley Stadium to watch a Rolling Stones con-
cert in a more timely fashion!
If mayors of American cities would like to achieve similar success, they might wish 
to take London as an example. But they should be aware of the political landmines

plan was greeted with much resistance, as it was blocked by the New York State legis-
lature, and with Mayor Bloomberg’s retirement the congestion tax is no longer being 
considered. In the next chapter, we dive deeper into government taxation, and learn why 
taxes have their critics.

Chapter 9  |  Externalities and Public Goods
Summary
The three major examples of when the invisible hand fails are: externalities, 
public goods, and common pool resources. In each case, free markets typically do 
not maximize social surplus.
Externalities come in many shapes and sizes: they can be either positive or 
negative and occur in consumption or production. The solution to externalities 
can come through private or public means. The key to each is internalizing the 
externality; in so doing, we can align private and social incentives so that we can 
maximize overall well-being.
Public goods, which can be provided publicly or privately, are non-rival in 
consumption and are non-excludable. This means that once they are provided no 
one can be excluded and we can all consume them at the same time.
Common pool resource goods are not excludable but are rival. This leads to 
an important negative externality that one person imposes on all others: once the 
bluegill is taken out of the stream no one else can catch it. Therefore, solutions to 
common pool resource problems mirror solutions to externalities.
A key link between externalities, public goods, and common pool resources 
is that there is a difference between the private benefits and costs and the social 
benefits and costs.

Problems
	 1.	 The European Union banned certain pesticides for two 
years after studies found links between the use of these 
insecticides and a decline in the bee population. In par-
ticular, research has shown that the use of imidacloprid, 
clothianidin, and thiamethoxam on flowering crops have 
adversely affected the honeybee population in North 
America and Europe.
	
a.	 Consider the private market for these pesticides. Use 
supply and demand curves to show the equilibrium 
level of pesticides that will be produced and consumed. 
	
b.	 How might the impact of the insecticide on honey-
bees be modeled as a marginal external cost? Show 
the deadweight loss from this externality in the graph 
you drew for the first part of this question.
	
c.	 Is the private market outcome socially efficient?
	 2.	 Suppose that you put an invisible tracking device on your 
computer that will instantly lead police to it if your com-
puter is ever stolen. Does your purchase of the tracking 
device provide a positive or negative ­externality for other 
computer owners? What kind of externality do you pro-
vide for other computer owners when you purchase a vis-
ible computer lock in order to prevent theft?
	 3.	 To improve the public transportation in Singapore, the 
government has decided to construct the Circle Line 
(CCL), a mass rapid transit (MRT) project compris-
ing many stations in the central region of the country. 
This is a huge infrastructural project and involves dig-
ging and pounding in the residential areas, resulting in 
noise, dust, and traffic congestion in the vicinity. Many 
residents have complained to the construction company 
that the project has led to pollution and inconvenienced 
them.  Explain what type of externality has occurred 
and why the Coase Theorem is unable to rectify this 
issue.
	 4.	 Serene is a dance instructor who tends to play music very 
loudly at her home while practicing. Her neighbor, Jen-
nifer, is a teacher who needs a quiet environment to mark 
her students’ assignments. Dancing gives benefits to Se-
rene worth $120 daily. But Jennifer’s marking progress is 
affected and it costs her $50 everyday.
	
a.	 Is it efficient for Serene to stop dancing with loud mu-
sic on since it inconveniences Jennifer?
	
b.	 If Serene has the right to do whatever she chooses but both 
parties can negotiate with no cost involved, will Jennifer 
be able to mark assignments in a quiet environment?
	
c.	 Jennifer has the right to a quiet environment and 
­Serene can only play music loudly with Jennifer’s ap-
proval. Assume that both parties can negotiate with 
no cost involved. Will Jennifer be able to mark the 
assignments in a quiet environment?
	 5.	 The government of country Alpha imposes an entry 
charge of $3 on each vehicle using the expressway to con-
trol the traffic volume, but to no avail as the road is still 
heavily congested. Explain why the government did not 
raise the charge to further reduce the number of vehicles 
on the expressway.
	 6.	 Malaria is spread by mosquitoes. That is, a mosquitoe 
spreads malaria by biting an infected person and later in-
fusing malaria into a different person. A study by Jeffrey 
Sachs and others shows a strong correlation between the 
incidence of malaria in a country and poverty. Malaria  
is known to exist in poor countries; it has also been 
found that the incidence of malaria exacerbates poverty. 
One of the simplest and effective ways of preventing 
the occurrence of malaria is by using insecticide-treated  
nets (ITNs).
	
a.	 Consider the private market for ITNs. Use supply 
and demand curves to show the equilibrium level of 
nets that will be produced. Is this outcome socially 
efficient?
	
b.	 In the graph, how would you account for the ITNs’ 
effect on poverty? What happens to the level of output 
in the market?
	
c.	 How could the government encourage the production 
of the efficient number of ITNs?
	 7.	 Certain diseases, such as chicken pox, are highly conta-
gious. When a person is affected by chicken pox, their 
family members, colleagues, and people whom they regu-
larly interact with stand a high risk of catching the dis-
ease.  The disease can be prevented by taking an injection 
of vaccine in local hospitals.  The decision to take the 
vaccine is purely voluntary and some people choose not 
to go ahead with it due to the high cost involved.

road is congested at rush hour. If 100 people use the 
road at rush hour, the trip takes 30 minutes. If the 101st 
person enters the road, everyone has to slow down and 
the trip now takes 31 minutes. People value their time at 
$6 per hour (that is, $0.10 per minute). For simplicity,  
ignore all of the costs of using the road other than the 
cost of time.
	
a.	 What is the total social cost of 100 people using the 
road at rush hour?
	
b.	 What is the marginal social cost of the 101st person?
	
c.	 The governor of this state (who has taken a Principles 
of Economics course) would like to institute a toll that 
would equal the costs the last driver who uses the road 
imposes on the other drivers. How high should the toll 
be on this road during rush hour?
	
d.	 Suppose at noon 50 people are using the road. The 
road is not congested and the trip takes just 20 min-
utes. If the 51st driver enters the road, no one has to 
slow down and the trip continues to take 20 minutes. 
How high should the toll be at noon?

$2,500 to Jack, and $1,500 to James.
	
a.	 Is it efficient to build the playground?
	
b.	 Will any of the three parties build the playground on 
their own?
	
c.	 The town council suggests that each of them pay one-
third of the price to build the playground. It puts the 
matter to a vote and requires majority to vote in favor 
to implement it. Will the playground get built?
	11.	 Three roommates—Tinker, Evers, and Chance—share an 
apartment. It is really cold outside and they are consider-
ing turning up the thermostat in the apartment up by 1, 2, 3,

	12.	 Rhino poaching is a serious problem in South Africa, 
where a large proportion of Africa’s rhino population is 
found. The demand for rhino horns, used in traditional 
Chinese medicine, has increased the prices of rhino horns 
substantially. This has fueled an illegal market for rhino

hears voices coming from a speck of dust. He soon learns 
that the speck is actually a tiny planet where the Whos

Whos and they threaten to boil the speck in Beezelnut 
Oil. The only way the Whos can save themselves is by 
making so much noise that the other animals in the jungle 
can hear them. Horton and the Mayor of Whoville have 
trouble convincing all of the Whos to contribute to the 
noise-making effort. Finally, “a very small shirker named 
JoJo” joins in and together all of the Whos make enough

It’s early November, and the presidential race is at 
fever pitch, growing more intense every day. You are 
beginning to grasp the major issues but are still in need 
of a bit more information before casting your vote next 
week. As you eat breakfast, you decide to flip on the 
TV to learn more about the candidates. You listen to a 
persuasive argument from the Democratic candidate, 
who is urging businesses to reduce their carbon 
emissions. She states that if elected, she will propose 
new taxes on polluters to address the inherent dangers 
of ­climate change: polluters must pay for their pollution! 
This makes sense to you: why not levy a tax on polluters

Later that day, you return home from economics class and decide to veg

taxes will harm all consumers, he claims. He suggests that corruption has 
become ­commonplace in government: even seemingly honest officials are 
bamboozling­ the taxpayer. What we need, he says, is less government intrusion 
in our lives. He ends with a persuasive line: “The beginning of massive govern-
ment ­intervention is the end of any great society.”
Uh-oh. Now you are torn. The Republican candidate was quite convinc-
ing. But so was the Democratic one. Which story is correct? Who should you 
­believe? Do we need more or less government intervention in the economy?
In this chapter we will learn that by its very nature, government intervention 
can be a double-edged sword. Well-designed regulation can improve societal 
outcomes, but poorly designed regulation stifles economic efficiency. We’ll also 
look at where the government’s money comes from and where it goes, how 
government intervenes in the economy, and what that intervention costs. Along 
the way, you will pick up tools that will help you answer the complex question of 
the optimal role of government in our economy—how much government inter-
vention is necessary? How much is desirable?
KEY IDEAS
In the United States, governments (federal, state, and local) tax citizens 
and corporations to correct market failures and externalities, raise revenues, 
redistribute funds, and finance operations.
Through direct regulation and price controls, governments can 
intervene to influence market outcomes.
Although government intervention sometimes creates inefficiencies,  
it often results in improved social well-being.
Weighing the trade-offs between equity and efficiency is one task of an 
economist.
It is up to each individual to decide when and where government 
intervention makes the most sense.
The federal government is the central government established by the U.S. Constitution. It 
is the largest governing body in the United States, holding jurisdiction over all fifty states. 
Yet when we refer to “the government,” we do not necessarily mean just the federal govern­
ment. In fact, the federal government collects only about two-thirds of total taxes in the 
U.S. economy.
There are also state and local governments that impose and collect taxes and spend the 
revenues they generate. State governments, as the name implies, hold jurisdiction over 
particular states. Local governments exist at the county and city levels; they, too, collect 
taxes from, and spend them in, the interest of their respective residents. A single citizen can 
fall under the jurisdiction of a city government, county government, state government, and 
federal government simultaneously and thus owe taxes to each.

Chapter 10  |  The Government in the Economy: Taxation and Regulation
10.1
To appreciate the reach of government in the United States, consider Exhibit 10.1, 
which plots total government spending and tax revenues. This exhibit shows that govern­
ment spending has grown over time and now accounts for more than 40 percent of U.S. 
national income. Notice the spike in the mid-1940s, which shows a substantial increase in 
government spending due to World War II. Tax revenues have also grown in tandem. For 
example, in 2011, total government tax revenues stood at $2,651.4 billion. It may be hard 
to believe that such massive tax revenues fall short of spending, but Exhibit 10.1 shows that 
this is often the case. When government tax revenues fall below spending, the government 
runs a budget deficit. When the converse happens and tax revenues exceed spending, the 
government is running a budget surplus.
Where Does the Money Come From?
Exhibit 10.2 provides a summary of how the federal government raises revenues. In 2011, 
for example, the federal government collected over $2,311 billion in tax revenues, or 
­receipts, which is equivalent to about $15,044 per person in the labor force. These receipts 
are collected via various types of taxes, as shown in the exhibit.
	
1.	 Individual income taxes represent the largest portion—roughly 47 percent in 2011.
	
2.	 Payroll taxes represent about a third of the federal government’s receipts. A payroll 
tax, also known as a social insurance tax, is a tax on wages that employers are

revenues do not cover government

tax revenues exceed government 
spending.

the money a government collects

A payroll tax (also known as social 
insurance tax) is a tax on the wages 
of workers.

Total government spending 
and tax revenues have been 
­increasing over the last several 
decades. When government 
spending exceeds tax revenues, 
the government is running a 
budget deficit. Conversely, when 
government tax revenues ­exceed 
spending, there is a budget 
surplus.

required to withhold from employees’ pay. On your paystub, these are often listed 
as Federal Insurance Contribution Act taxes, or FICA taxes.
	
3.	 Corporate income tax provides 7 percent of the overall pie. Corporate income tax 
is generated from taxing profits earned by corporations.
	
4.	 All other taxes make up the remaining 9 percent. This includes excise taxes, 
which are taxes paid when purchasing specific goods such as alcohol, tobacco, and 
gasoline.
The sources of revenue for state and local governments are quite different from those 
of the federal government. Exhibit 10.3 displays the types of taxes levied by these govern­
ments and the receipts brought in by each. The pie chart of revenue in the exhibit is split 
into five pieces.
(1) The largest slice of the pie at 30 percent is the All Other category, which encom­
passes miscellaneous taxes and fees that state and local governments collect. These ­include, 
among others, tolls on roads and sales from public transportation tickets, vehicle licenses, 
and hunting and fishing licenses.
(2) The next biggest portion at 25 percent is Revenue from the Federal Government, 
which are taxes collected at the federal level and then redistributed to the states (often 
used to redistribute resources toward poorer states with otherwise relatively low tax 
receipts).
(3) Sales taxes account for the next largest portion at 18 percent. Unless you live in one 
of the few states that does not have a sales tax, you are likely quite familiar with sales taxes, 
which are calculated as a percentage of the sale price of an item and are usually collected 
from a buyer by a seller at the time of sale. The seller then passes the tax on to the proper 
government agencies. Some items, such as basic necessities, are exempt from sales taxes; 
these exemptions are determined independently by each state and local government. The 
value-added tax (VAT) is similar to the sales tax, except that it is imposed at each stage of 
the production process leading up to the final sale rather than being entirely collected at the 
time of sale of the final good.
(4) At 17 percent of tax revenues, property taxes also constitute a robust slice of the 
revenues. These are taxes on land and structures on which local governments rely to fund 
schools, libraries, and public services such as police and fire protection.
(5) Similar to the federal government, forty-three state governments and many local 
governments collect individual income taxes. These amounted to 11 percent of total 
receipts in 2011. Though the type of tax is the same, each state’s rates vary and are gen­
erally less than federal individual income tax rates. The seven states that do not collect 
any income taxes are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and 
Wyoming (in addition, New Hampshire and Tennessee only tax dividend and interest 
income). Before you plan your next big move, however, keep in mind that these states 
tend to make up for not taxing income with higher tax rates in other categories or lower 
provision of public goods.

Some state and local governments also collect corporate income taxes, though this 
­category accounts for a much smaller share of receipts—2.5 percent in 2011.
Why Does the Government Tax and Spend?
There are four main factors underlying government taxation and spending decisions:
• Raising revenues
• Redistributing income via transfer payments
• Financing operations
• Correcting market failures and externalities
Raising Revenues  Most taxation in our economy is intended to raise revenues for the 
funding of public goods such as national defense, public education, police protection, and 
infrastructure projects. We saw in Chapter 9 that markets will in general fail to provide 
optimal amounts of public goods. This failure in turn motivates governments to levy taxes 
and use the returns for the provision of public goods, which benefit a large number of 
citizens.
Exhibit 10.4 provides a summary of how federal government revenue is spent and shows 
that national defense and Social Security comprise the two largest categories of federal 
spending. The federal government does not spend a large fraction of its budget on educa­
tion, policing, and infrastructure, which are all included in the “Other” category. But state 
and local governments do, as we see in Exhibit 10.5.

10.1
Exhibit 10.5 indicates that 27 percent of state and local government spending went 
toward public education, which includes schools from kindergarten all the way up to state 
universities. Large fractions of these state and local receipts were also spent on highways, 
one type of infrastructure spending. Policing, together with firefighting, libraries, transpor­
tation, parks, and sewage, were included in the “Other” category.
Redistributing Funds  The second major objective of government taxation and 
spending is redistribution. As we discuss in the next chapter, market outcomes can be quite 
inequitable, with high levels of inequality and poverty coexisting alongside huge fortunes 
for a few. Governments in all advanced economies in general, and the U.S. government in 
particular use transfer payments and the tax system to limit the extent of such inequality 
and the economic hardships that poorer households in the society suffer.
Transfer payments refer to payments from the government to certain individual groups, 
such as the elderly or the unemployed (which are not made as a payment for the provision 
of a good or service). In Exhibit 10.4, you can see that after national defense spending, the 
bulk of federal government spending is made up of payments under the umbrella of Social 
Security, Medicare, and Health. Social Security, also known as the Old-Age, Survivors, and 
Disability Insurance program, is the largest transfer program and was introduced by Presi­
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935 to provide economic security to the elderly, disabled, 
widows, and fatherless children. 
Medicare, introduced by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965, provides health insur­
ance to Americans age 65 and above and makes up another large part of federal spending. 
­Income Security includes unemployment compensation, Supplemental Security Income, 
the refundable portion of the Earned Income and Child Tax Credits, food stamps (also 
known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), family support, child nutrition, 
and foster care. Health comprises such major mandatory programs as Medicaid, the State 
Children’s Health Insurance Program, federal employees’ and retirees’ health benefits, and 
healthcare for Medicare-eligible military retirees.
Exhibit 10.5 shows that public welfare also makes up a significant part of state and local 
budgets. This item consists of transfer payments to persons in need, including direct cash assis­
tance (under the Old Age Assistance and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs), 
vendor payments made to private purveyors for medical care, burials, and other services pro­
vided under welfare programs, as well as payments to other governments for welfare purposes.
In addition to transfer payments, governments rely on progressive income taxes to limit 
inequality and distribute the tax burden more toward the shoulders of the rich.
A progressive tax system is one in which tax rates increase with taxable base incomes, 
so that the rich pay higher tax rates than the less well-to-do. To understand this system 
more precisely, we need to distinguish between average and marginal tax rates. The 
­average tax rate faced by a household is the total tax paid divided by total income earned. 
The ­marginal tax rate, on the other hand, refers to how much of the last dollar earned 
the household pays in taxes. The United States has a progressive 
federal income tax system in that high-income individuals pay 
higher average taxes and higher marginal taxes. The “Letting the 
Data Speak” box illustrates the relationship between marginal 
and average tax rates in a progressive system, using federal tax 
information from 2013.
Exhibit 10.7 shows an important consequence of a progressive 
tax system: the rich earn a high share of the national income but 
pay even a higher share of total taxes. For example, the richest 
1 percent earns 14.9 percent of national income, but also pays 
24.2 percent of total federal taxes. People between the 60th and 
80th percentiles of the income distribution, on the other hand, pay 
about the same percentage in taxes as they earn, while those in the bottom 60 percent of the 
earnings distribution pay less in taxes than their percentage of the national income.
The alternatives to the progressive tax system are the proportional and regressive tax 
systems. In a proportional tax system, households pay the same percentage of their in­
comes in taxes regardless of their income level; in other words, the marginal and average 
tax rates do not vary with income. In a regressive tax system, the marginal tax and average 
tax rates decline with income so that low-income households pay a greater percentage of 
Transfer payments occur when 
the government gives part of its 
tax revenue to some individual or 
group.
A progressive tax system involves 
higher tax rates on those earning 
higher incomes.
The average tax rate for a 
household is given by total taxes 
paid divided by total income.
The marginal tax rate refers to how 
much of the last dollar earned is 
paid out in tax.
“The United States has a progressive

In a proportional tax system, 
households pay the same 
percentage of their incomes in taxes 
regardless of their income level.
A regressive tax system involves 
lower tax rates on those earning

Your “tax bracket” corresponds to your marginal tax 
rate (which is higher than your average tax rate because 
the federal tax system is progressive). Exhibit 10.6 gives 
the marginal tax rate single individuals had to pay in 2013.
Using the information provided in this exhibit, you can 
compute the amount you have to pay in taxes. Suppose 
that your taxable income (after deductions and exemp-
tions) is equal to $100,000. Then your tax would be cal-
culated as follows:
      (8,925 − 0) × 10% = $892.50
+ (36,250 − 8,925) × 15% = $4,098.75
    + (87,850 − 36,250) × 25% = $12,900
+ (100,000 − 87,850) × 28% = $3,402
                                           Total = $21,293.25
This puts you in the 28 percent tax bracket, because your 
marginal tax rate—the tax rate applied to the last dollar 
added to your taxable income—is 28 percent. But your 
average tax rate is lower. In particular, it is given by the to-
tal amount of taxes you pay, $21,293.25, divided by your 
total income, $100,000, and is thus 21,293.25
100,000 = 21.29%.

income in taxes than do high-income households. Exhibit 10.8 provides examples of pro­
gressive, proportional, and regressive taxes. In the United States, income taxes are progres­
sive, and Social Security and property taxes tend to be regressive.
As a result of transfer programs and progressive taxation, the post-tax income distribu­
tion in the United States is more unequal than the pre-tax income distribution. We depict 
this in Exhibit 10.9, which plots the pre-tax and the post-tax income shares of the top 
(richest) 1 percent and the lowest (poorest) 20 percent of households in the United States. 
Even though these figures do not include the transfer payments related to healthcare, they 
already indicate that government redistribution reduces inequality by a significant amount. 
For example, in 2010 the pre-tax income share of the lowest 20 percent of U.S. households 
was 5.1 percent, while their post-tax income share was 6.2 percent; the pre-tax income 
share of the top 1 percent of U.S. households was 14.9 percent, while their post-tax income 
share was 12.8 percent.

Because of the progressivity

while the post-tax income

Chapter 10  |  The Government in the Economy: Taxation and Regulation
10.1
Financing Operations  Governments also tax to pay for their own operations, 
including the salaries of presidents, congressmen, and other politicians, and for the sizable 
bureaucracy in charge of the day-to-day running of government operations and services. 
Some economists such as William Niskanen1 argue that politicians and government 
bureaucrats have a tendency to increase government revenues and their size—independent 
of the more useful roles of government listed above. Though most economists and social 
scientists would not agree that this is the major driver of government size, many would 
agree that certain parts of the government bureaucracy are inefficiently large. We return to 
this issue later in this chapter.
Correcting Market Failures and Externalities  In Chapter 9 we saw how the 
government sometimes imposes taxes to correct market failures or externalities. Though 
important in principle, most taxes in practice are not imposed to deal with a specific market 
failure or externality, but because of one of the other three factors listed above. Because 
of this, and the fact that we discussed Pigouvian taxes in Chapter 9, we focus on the other 
three factors in this chapter.
Taxation: Tax Incidence and Deadweight 
Losses
Who bears the burden of taxes—meaning, who actually pays 
the tax?
At first glance, the answer to the question of who bears the 
tax burden seems obvious: whoever is taxed bears the burden. If 
a tax is imposed on a consumer, then the consumer bears it. If it’s 
imposed on sellers (producers), they bear it. But we will learn in 
this section that interestingly enough, things that are not simple: 
the tax burden can be shared between a buyer and a seller even if 
it seems to fall on just one of them. The term tax incidence refers 
to how the burden of the tax is distributed across various agents 
in the economy.
To illustrate, let’s consider city government officials in New 
Orleans, who want to raise money to build a park next to Bourbon 
Street. Understanding that the local restaurants are doing well, they decide to levy a tax of 
$2 on every plate of jambalaya being sold per day. Every time a restaurant sells a plate of 
jambalaya, it must send $2 to the city government. Let’s see how this tax on sellers affects 
market outcomes.
Panel (a) of Exhibit 10.10 shows the market demand and market supply of jambalaya 
plates and the pre-tax equilibrium, which involves a daily quantity of 4,000 plates of jam­
balaya being sold at the equilibrium price of $6.50 a plate. Panel (b) in Exhibit 10.10 
shows what happens when a tax of $2 per plate is imposed on the sellers. We include a 
virtual supply curve (Stax) to show the post-tax supply curve. We see that at every quantity 
level, the post-tax supply curve (Stax) is $2 higher than the old (pre-tax) supply curve S.  
To understand why, note that with $2 from the sale of every plate going to the government, 
the sellers are receiving $2 less than the sale price. For example, if the sale takes place at 
$6.50, they get not this amount but only $4.50. But then, after the tax, at $6.50, they will be 
willing to supply only what they would have supplied at $4.50 on the original supply curve. 
Panel (b) shows that the tax reduces the quantity of jambalaya plates purchased per day 
from 4,000 to 2,500 and raises the equilibrium price to $7.50 a plate. (This means that, after 
the $2 in tax, a seller now receives $5.50 = $7.50 − $2 and market supply is 2,500 plates.)
Can you see what is happening here? First, there is a gap of $2 between what the con­
sumer pays and what the supplier receives, resulting from the $2 tax on jambalaya plates. 
Second, not all of this falls on the restaurants: the consumer is paying $1 more per plate—
half the $2 tax burden—and the supplier is receiving $1 less per plate (thus also bearing 
half of the tax burden).
“Market outcomes can be quite 
inequitable, with high levels of in-
equality and poverty coexisting 
alongside huge fortunes for a few. 
Governments use transfer pay-
ments and the tax system to limit 
the extent of such inequality and 
the economic hardships that poorer 
households in the society suffer.”
Tax incidence refers to how the 
burden of taxation is distributed.

This change in market equilibrium affects consumer and producer surpluses, as shown 
in panel (b) of exhibit 10.10. Consumer surplus is now given by the blue-shaded area 
labeled CS, and producer surplus is given by the pink-shaded area PS. The green area 
represents the portion of revenues that producers pass on to the government. This is the tax 
revenue, and it is equal to the size of the tax multiplied by the number of plates sold. In this 
case, with a $2 tax, 2,500 plates are served per day at a price of $7.50 (the intersection point 
of D and Stax). So, daily tax revenues are given by 2,500 × $2 = $5,000.
This decomposition in panel (b) also shows that the yellow triangle, which was part 
of consumer and producer surplus before the tax, is now part of neither. Nor does it 
accrue to the government as revenue. It therefore represents the ­deadweight loss of 
taxation. The deadweight loss of taxation is the loss in total ­surplus—or, put differ­
ently, the decline in consumer and producer surpluses not made up by the increase in 
tax revenues—due to the gap that the tax has created between the price received by 
sellers and the price paid by consumers. In this example, this gap is exactly equal to 
the $2 tax. The deadweight loss can be computed easily using the formula for the area 
of a triangle: ½ base (change in quantity) × height (tax). In our case, this is equal to =  
½ × $2 × 1,500 = $1,500.
To understand tax incidence we turn to panel (c) of Exhibit 10.10. Here we see that the 
government has taken the portion of pre-tax consumer surplus labeled “Incidence on con­
sumers.” We calculate this by finding the portion of tax revenue that lies above the pre-tax 
Exhibit 10.10 A $2 Tax on Producers
In panel (a) the pre-tax equilibrium is 4,000 plates at $6.50 per plate. In this panel, we 
can also see the consumer surplus (CS), the area underneath the demand curve and 
above the price of $6.50, shaded blue, and the producer surplus (PS), the area above the 
supply curve and below the price of $6.50, shaded pink.
In panel (b), we see the implications of a tax of $2 on a plate of jambalaya. Because 
for every plate of jambalaya they sell, restaurants have to pay $2 to the government, 
the post-tax supply curve is to the left. The intersection of this post-tax curve and the 
demand curve gives the post-tax equilibrium, where the price of a plate of jambalaya is 
now $7.50 and 2,500 plates are consumed. This panel also shows how consumer surplus 
and producer surplus have shrunk. In between the two, shaded in green, is the tax rev-
enue, given by $2 times 2,500 = $5,000. The yellow triangle represents the deadweight 
loss of taxation, the loss in total surplus due to the tax.
Panel (c) shows tax incidence. Consumers are now paying $7.50 per plate of 
­jambalaya, $1 more than in the pre-tax equilibrium; and sellers are taking home 
$5.50 per plate, $1 less than in the pre-tax equilibrium, so that in this example the tax 
incidence is 50 percent on consumers and 50 percent on sellers.

equilibrium price of $6.50. This portion of tax revenue used to be part of consumer surplus 
but is no longer part of it. Thus it represents the incidence of taxes on consumers. Similarly, 
the portion of tax revenue that lies below the pre-tax equilibrium is the incidence of the tax 
on producers—the portion of tax revenue that is lost producer surplus. This result shows 
that although the tax is placed on sellers of jambalaya, both buyers and sellers bear its bur­
den. In fact, in the example we have shown in Exhibit 10.10, the incidence on consumers is 
equivalent to 50 percent of the tax, even though the tax was placed on sellers!
Let’s return to the government officials in New Orleans, who now face another chal­
lenge. After the tax is in place for only a few months, the local merchants begin to clamor. 
They are unhappy with paying the $2 tax. In a town hall meeting, the merchants hatch a 
seemingly clever plan: “Because most of our patrons are from out of town, let’s tax buyers 
$2 for every plate of jambalaya that they purchase. This way, they—not us—will pay for 
our new park.” The town officials, anxious to placate the restaurant owners, think this is 
a great idea. They immediately repeal the tax on restaurants and impose it on consumers. 
They conclude that since buyers are now responsible for paying the tax, sellers should be 
much better off. Is this true?
Exhibit 10.11 helps us to answer this question. In panel (a) of the exhibit, we see that 
the $2 tax on every plate of jambalaya creates a new (virtual) demand curve for jambalaya, 
labeled Dtax.
We construct this virtual demand curve by subtracting $2 from the price associated 
with every quantity on the pre-tax demand curve D. Indeed, now when producers charge 
$5.50 consumers in addition have to pay a tax of $2 and thus face a total cost of $7.50. We 
can once again calculate the new equilibrium, the deadweight losses, and tax incidence.
Upon doing so, you will see that the equilibrium quantity is the same as in panel (b) of 
Exhibit 10.10: 2,500 plates are sold per day (consumers pay $7.50, and suppliers get 
$5.50 per plate). And here is the important point: the deadweight loss, again represented by 
the yellow triangle, is also identical—equal to $1,500. Let’s again compute tax incidence: 
the incidence on consumers—the portion of tax revenue that lies above the pre-tax equi­
librium price (in this case, $6.50)—is given by the same green rectangle. The incidence on 
producers—the portion of the tax revenue that lies below the pre-tax equilibrium price—is 
Exhibit 10.11 A $2 Tax on Consumers
When the $2 tax is imposed on consumers, we see that the post-tax equilibrium is the 
same quality as in the case where the $2 tax rate was imposed on ­sellers. The sizes of the 
consumer and producer surpluses, tax revenue, and deadweight loss are also the same as 
in Exhibit 10.10. Panel (b) shows that, perhaps even more strikingly, 50 percent of the inci-
dence is on consumers and 50 percent is on sellers, just as in Exhibit 10.10. This illustrates 
a more general phenomenon: in competitive markets, tax incidence, as well as the equilib-
rium, is independent of whether the tax is imposed on ­consumers or sellers.

also the same green rectangle. Remarkably, the outcome is identical to the case in which 
the tax was imposed on producers!
We seem to have stumbled across a conundrum. Notice that the incidence of the tax 
on producers doesn’t change even though under the original tax system jambalaya pro­
ducers had to pay the government, whereas in the new tax system, consumers have to pay 
the government. Why doesn’t it change? It’s because in the first case, when producers 
of jambalaya were taxed, menu prices rose from $6.50 to $7.50. Thus, consumers paid 
$7.50 per plate and producers’ net revenue was $5.50 ($7.50 − 
$2 tax) per plate. In the second case, when consumers are 
­directly taxed, the equilibrium menu price decreases to $5.50 
because of the consequences of the tax. Thus, again producers 
receive $5.50 per plate in net revenues, but because of the tax, 
consumers pay a total of $7.50 for every dish of jambalaya they 
consume.
We are encountering a general phenomenon here: in competi­
tive markets, tax incidence and equilibrium prices and quantities 
are independent of whether the tax is imposed on consumers or 
producers.
The Effects of Demand and Supply Elasticities on the Tax Burden  The fact 
that the incidence of the tax is identical for buyers and sellers in the examples above is due 
to how we drew the market demand and market supply curves. That is, buyers and sellers 
were equally as sensitive to price changes at the original equilibrium. However, in general, 
the elasticity of market demand will not be identical to the elasticity of market supply.
In competitive markets, tax 
­incidence and equilibrium prices 
and quantities are independent 
of whether the tax is imposed on 
­consumers or producers.
The deadweight losses of taxation imply that for every dol-
lar of tax raised, the cost is greater than a dollar. This is what 
the economist Arthur Okun called the “leaky bucket”—the 
government finds that it must pour in more than one gal-
lon of revenue to finance one gallon of services.2
But some types of taxes might create fewer leakages 
than others. Lump-sum taxes, which are taxes that require 
every citizen to pay the same amount, regardless of his or 
her circumstances, typically create fewer leakages than 
CHOICE & CONSEQUENCE
The Deadweight Loss Depends on the Tax
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Ronald 
­Reagan shared views on many taxation policies.
taxes on income or transactions. This is because 
they do not introduce the gap that leads to the 
deadweight loss of taxation shown in Exhibits 10.10 
and 10.11. Imagine that the government imposed 
a lump-sum tax on all residents of New Orleans 
rather than the tax on plates of jambalaya; then the 
equilibrium in the jambalaya market would not be 
subject to the tax distortions we saw there. With 
lump-sum taxes, all citizens in an economy would 
pay the government the same fee—say, $5,000—
regardless of their earnings or market demand. 
Such taxes do not distort behavior and therefore 
there is no deadweight loss associated with impo-
sition of such taxes. Although such taxes are rare, 
there are examples in practice. For example, during 
the third administration of Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, the government in Great Britain enacted 
a law in 1989 requiring local authorities to replace 
their system of local property taxes with a lump-
sum head or poll tax. Every adult would now pay 
the same amount of tax, called the Community 
Charge, to the local government, with the amount deter-
mined by each locality. In practice, these types of taxes 
are rarely used because they go against one of the major 
objectives of governments: redistribution.
As we have seen, governments often tax so as to re-
distribute away from the rich and toward the poor, the 
disabled, or the elderly. But lump-sum taxes force rich and 
poor people to pay the same amount—and thus incur a 
higher tax rate on the poor. They are thus regressive taxes.

10.1
Exhibit 10.12 provides an illustrative example. Panel (a) of the exhibit shows the market 
for jambalaya using the same figures as in the example above. In panel (b) of the exhibit, 
we make the market supply curve more elastic than the market demand curve. This means 
that sellers are more responsive to price changes than buyers.
Panel (b) reveals that when the supply curve becomes more elastic, a smaller portion 
of tax revenue lies below the pre-tax market price. So buyers bear more of the tax burden 
because the market supply curve is more elastic than the market demand curve.
What would happen if we reverse the situation and make the demand curve more elastic 
than the supply curve? Exhibit 10.13 provides the answer: now it is the producers who bear 
more of the burden of the tax.
This leads us to a general rule:
The tax burden falls less heavily on the side of the market that is more elastic—that is, 
more responsive to price changes. When supply is more elastic than demand, the tax 
burden falls more heavily on buyers. When demand is more elastic than supply, the tax 
burden falls more heavily on sellers.
The intuition behind why this is true revolves around what an elasticity measures. 
­Recall that when buyers are more price-elastic, they have more alternatives to turn to. 
Thus, when the price rises, they can easily switch to purchasing another good. If buyers

are price-inelastic, or not sensitive to price changes, they have few good alternatives. Thus, 
they must “swallow” the higher price and continue to purchase the taxed good despite the 
higher price. This means that the more elastic buyer will bear less of the price increase than 
the less elastic buyer. The same logic applies to the producer side.
There is another impact of elasticities on the tax burden, which can also be seen from 
Exhibits 10.12 and 10.13: as supply or demand becomes more price-elastic, the deadweight 
loss of taxation increases. This means that the greater the price elasticity of either supply or 
demand, the greater the deadweight loss, all things being equal.
Regulation refers to actions by the 
federal or local government directed 
at influencing market outcomes, 
such as the quantity traded of a 
good or service, its price, or its 
quality and safety.
The main tool that governments use to deal with externalities and other market failures is 
regulation (including direct regulation and price controls). Regulation refers to actions 
by the federal or local government directed at influencing market outcomes, such as the 
quantity traded of a good or service, its price, or safety. This also may involve antitrust 
activities preventing some firms from exercising excessive monopoly power, as well as 
activities that are useful for enforcing laws and property rights and resolving disputes to 
improve the market allocation of resources. We saw in Chapter 9 how the government can 
use Pigouvian taxes and subsidies to correct externalities. In many instances, however, 
the government often directly regulates the activity that creates negative externalities. 
For example, governments typically prevent firms from dumping hazardous waste into 
rivers rather than simply taxing them. Governments also often use regulation to limit the 
market power of certain firms, which, by creating a departure from competitive markets, 
constitutes another major source of market failures, as we discuss in Chapter 12. In this 
section, we look at direct regulation and price controls as used by the government to 
­affect market outcomes.
Direct Regulation
A common form of government intervention in markets is direct regulation (or 
­command-and-control regulation, as discussed in Chapter 9 in regards to pollution). 
­Direct regulation, or commandand-control regulation, refers to direct actions by the gov­
ernment to control the amount of a certain activity. Direct regulations affect just about 
every walk of life, from the safety of foods and drugs to the miles per gallon our automo­
biles achieve to when we can drop out of school. In many cases, such regulations serve 
important purposes. For example, consider a prominent regulator of the quality of goods: 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA represents one of the most complex 
bureaucracies in the United States, employing 9,000 people and operating on a budget of 
approximately $2 billion per year. It is not a perfect organization. Far from it—it is often 
blamed, sometimes deservedly, for being slow to allow new drugs to reach the market as 
rapidly as they should. Nevertheless, the FDA does play an important role. It makes sure 
that drugs that are marketed do, in fact, have the functions that they are supposed to have. 
The FDA is also charged with preventing fly-by-night companies from selling snake oil, so 
to speak, to unsuspecting consumers.
This type of regulation, aimed at ensuring that complex products meet certain quality 
and disclosure requirements, would be difficult to leave to the market itself, as it would 
be costly for each consumer to obtain such information. If each consumer had to individ­
ually verify that a drug was safe to take, it would lead to a massive ­duplication of effort.
Though regulation plays an indispensable role in modern society, it has costs and limita­
tions. Consider a quick thought experiment on quantity regulations. Quantity regulations, 
which include fishing quotas, zoning restrictions, antismoking laws, and blue laws (laws 
that restrict liquor sales on Sundays), can be found throughout any market economy. Let’s 
assume now that the government determines that there is a shortage of physicists. In fact, 
it pronounces that because of the positive externalities that physicists bestow on society 
we should have 5,000 more of them. It proceeds to use quantity regulation to choose 5,000 
people to become physicists, without any market mechanism to guide those choices. Would 
this approach yield an efficient result?

Likely not. Unlike market forces that guide resources to their best use, this type 
of command system would probably fail miserably. The reason is that a gifted artist 
or a dedicated bond trader might be forced into a career solving complicated mathe­
matical equations for which they have no particular talent. As we learned in Chapter 9, 
a ­Pigouvian subsidy is a viable alternative because it uses market forces to encourage 
people at the margin to internalize the externality. If there is an appropriately chosen 
subsidy to becoming a physicist, then it won’t be random people who choose to enter 
physics, but those who had the talent to become a physicist and yet were previously 
indifferent between, say, a career as a bond trader and one as a physicist, thus attracting 
the right people into this profession.
Price Controls: Price Ceilings and Price Floors  As we discussed in Chapter 7, 
sometimes the government intervenes in a market directly by setting a maximum or 
minimum price for which goods and services sell. Such intervention to regulate prices 
is called price controls. Here we examine two types of price controls—price ceilings and 
price floors.
Price Ceilings  A price ceiling is a cap on the price of a market good or service. One 
important example is rent control—referring to the maximum amount that landlords can 
charge renters or the maximum amount by which they can increase rent. Rent controls are 
often introduced partly as a redistributive tool—because renters are typically poorer than 
landlords and wind up spending a large portion of their incomes on rent.
In the United States, rent controls began during World War I and remain in many cities 
today, including New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. The 
idea of rent control is noble. However, economic analysis shows that rent control does cre­
ate important inefficiencies; some of these may help potential renters and others may not. 
Thus a careful economic analysis is necessary for evaluating the benefits and costs of rent 
control.
Consider the case of small apartments in San Francisco. In an effort to help renters, let’s 
say that the local government places a price control on apartments in the form of a price 
ceiling. You can see in Exhibit 10.14 that without rent control, the equilibrium is a rent of 
$1,200 per month and 4,000 apartments are rented. Now consider a rent control imposing a 
price ceiling of $750 per month. What are the implications of this regulation?
Exhibit 10.14 helps us answer this question. At $750 per month, shown by the black line, 
the quantity supplied (QS) decreases to 2,500 units. At this lower rent, quantity demanded 
(QD) has increased to 5,500 units. In consequence, there is now a shortage of 3,000 apart­
ment units at the price of $750: (5,500 − 2,500 = 3,000). Landlords won’t supply as many 
apartments at the lower rate of $750 as they would at the price of $1,200. For instance, at 
$750, rather than rent, they might use some apartments as a secondary residence for them­
selves. At the same time, more renters will want to rent at the lower price, but there won’t be 
A price ceiling is a cap or maximum 
price of a market good.
Exhibit 10.14 The Effect of a Price 
Ceiling
Without rent control, the intersection 
of the market supply and market 
demand curves for apartments leads 
to an equilibrium at the price of $1,200 
per month and 4,000 units are rented. 
A rent control imposing a price ceiling 
of $750 reduces the rent per unit to 
$750 but also creates a shortage of 
3,000 apartments: at this lower price, 
the quantity demanded increases to 
5,500 units, while landlords, moving 
down the supply curve, reduce the 
quantity supplied to 2,500.

as many apartments available. There is excess demand. What we conclude is that the price 
ceiling has caused an inefficiently low quantity of apartments to be available.
As we discussed in Chapter 7, this shortage caused by the government-imposed rent 
control carries a cost—a deadweight loss. Panel (a) of Exhibit 10.15 shows consumer and 
producer surplus before the government imposes a price ceiling. Panel (b) shows the situ­
ation after government-imposed regulation, assuming that among the renters, those with a 
greater willingness to pay are first in line to get an apartment. Under this assumption, the 
2,500 units go to the 2,500 consumers with the highest willingness to pay. The resulting 
deadweight loss is shown by the yellow triangle in the exhibit.
You might ask yourself: if rent control is so clearly welfare-reducing, why do we have 
it in practice? One reason is that it does not reduce everybody’s welfare. As you can see by 
comparing panels (a) and (b) in Exhibit 10.15, consumer surplus is higher under the rent 
control (panel (b)) than without the rent control (panel (a)). In addition, if those renters are 
also poor and the government wished to redistribute income from more well-to-do land­
lords toward this group, rent control will have achieved this goal. But of course, some rent­
ers are hurt by the rent control: fewer of them are now able to find an apartment. Moreover, 
rent control may discourage landlords from maintaining apartments since even a poorly 
maintained apartment will find takers in the market with a shortage of apartments.
When Price Ceilings Have No Bite  Consider what would happen if a large manu­
facturing plant in Oakland expanded and hired thousands of people from San Francisco. 
Now many people want to live in Oakland rather than San Francisco. The demand curve 
for rental units in San Francisco shifts leftward, as shown in Exhibit 10.16. This shift of 
the demand curve leads to an equilibrium market price of $600 corresponding to the in­
tersection of the new demand curve and the original supply curve. Now the government 
regulation has no bite because this price is below the price ceiling of $750. As you can see 
in Exhibit 10.16, the only time price ceilings have an effect on the market is when they are 
below the market clearing price.
Price Floors  Sometimes the government steps in to impose a minimum price on 
a product or service. The result is a price floor, which represents a lower limit on the 
Exhibit 10.15 Consumer and Producer Surplus with Rent Controls
Without rent control, the equilibrium is at a rent of $1,200 per month, and panel (a) shows that 
the consumer surplus is given by the area shaded blue and the producer surplus by the area 
shaded pink. Panel (b) depicts the situation after rent control at $750 per month. Producer 
surplus falls because landlords receive only $750 rent for 2,500 units (this can be seen with a 
smaller shaded pink triangle). Consumer surplus depends on which ones of the 5,500 potential 
renters get the 2,500 units on the market at the rent of $750 per month. Panel (b) draws the 
consumer surplus under the assumption that those with the highest willingness to pay are the 
first in line for apartments. Even in that best case scenario, the sum of consumer and producer 
surpluses is less than in panel (a), and the difference is the deadweight loss created by rent 
control shown as the yellow triangle.

price of the product or service. A prominent example of price floors is that of minimum 
wage requirements. Minimum wage laws were first enacted in New Zealand in 1894, and 
now more than 90 percent of all countries have them. In the United States, the federal 
government has set a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, meaning that it is the lowest wage 
an employer may pay a worker (workers receiving tip income can be paid $2.13 per hour). 
Several states have minimum wage laws prescribing that within their boundaries employers 
have to pay even more. For example, in the state of Illinois, employers must pay workers 
at least $8 per hour.
A price floor has similar implications to those of a price ceiling, except that instead of a 
shortage, a price floor causes a surplus—quantity supplied at a price floor would typically 
be greater than quantity demanded. Because price floors tend to keep the price artificially 
high, surplus is shifted from consumers to producers. Thus, a price floor not only has dead­
weight loss but also reallocates surplus to sellers.

Government failures refer 
to inefficiencies caused by a 
government’s interventions.
We have now seen several ways in which governments may intervene in the economic sys­
tem. Though many of these interventions have well-defined, worthy objectives and some of 
them are essential for the proper functioning of markets we have seen that they also create a 
range of inefficiencies that need to be taken into account. Those include deadweight losses 
of taxation or inefficiencies from price controls or direct regulations. Those who hold that 
the role of the government in the economy should be minimized ­emphasize not only these 
costs but also a broader set of inefficiencies associated with government ­interventions, 
sometimes also called government failures, which need to be weighed against the market 
failures that the governments are correcting. In this section, we outline some of these costs.
The Direct Costs of Bureaucracies
Every government program needs bureaucrats and bureaucracies to monitor its implementa­
tion. Bureaucrats have to be paid. They are also taken out of the productive sectors of the 
economy. That is, instead of working at a manufacturing plant or as a manager at Amazon.com, 
the bureaucrats are engaged in regulation or tax collection. This observation does not suggest 
that bureaucrats are unproductive at what they do—they implement regulation. However, in the 
absence of regulation, these workers would have been productive in other jobs, and this lost 
production represents the opportunity cost of government work.
In this way, the allocation of time and talent of individuals to bureaucracy is an impor­
tant cost of government. This cost is increased by the fact that bureaucracies sometimes 
don’t function efficiently. Though the various government agencies employ many well-
intentioned and efficient individuals, there are long lines, arbitrary decisions, and always a 
few not-so-helpful employees. These are the kinds of inefficiencies we have come to expect

from big bureaucracies. Government intervention in the form of direct regulation may also 
entail similar costs as firms and their employees work to meet certain government-set 
­objectives rather than creating goods and services.
Corruption
Equally as important as the deadweight losses associated with government intervention 
and the inefficiencies of bureaucracies is the corruption that large governments engender. 
Corruption refers to the misuse of public funds or the distortion of the allocation of re­
sources for personal gain. Consider one example—the billions of dollars that go annually 
to African governments as foreign aid. In the last 60 years, more than $1 trillion has been 
transferred from developed countries to Africa, and foreign aid to all countries in 2011 
exceeded $130 billion. Much of it comes from governments of developed nations and a 
significant portion from charities.
But only a small fraction of this money ever reaches its target audience. Economists 
have estimated that the amount of money that actually reaches its intended destination may 
be as little as from 5 percent to 15 percent—that means as little as a nickel of every dollar 
that you send reaches the recipient! Some of the lost aid is eaten up by the inefficiencies of 
the bureaucracies that operate the foreign aid machine, and even more is appropriated by 
corrupt politicians and bureaucrats. For example, a recent study found that only 13 percent 
of education grants reached schools (and most schools received no aid) in Uganda.3 This 
type of corruption is extreme, but not unusual.
You might be thinking that corruption is not an issue in developed countries, where there is a 
good system of checks and balances and watchdog agencies waiting for a public official to mis­
step are everywhere. The evidence suggests otherwise. For instance, in the United States, corrup­
tion is not difficult to find. In 2008, 15 sitting congressmen or senators (and 9 former members 
of the Senate or the House of Representatives) were under criminal investigation, mostly for 
inappropriately using public funds or gifts from businesses that constituted conflicts of interest. 
If we consider the number of convictions of public officials across states, similar insights 
are gained. For instance, from 1977 to 1987 there were roughly 800 corruption convic­
tions per year.4 The most corrupt state, New York, had roughly 50 times more corruption 
convictions than the average state during that time ­period. Such corruption levels continue 
unabated across states today. In 2008, the Department of Justice reported that 1,129 federal, 
state, and local employees had been convicted on corruption charges. In spite of recent 
drama, New York is no longer the heavyweight champion of corruption though—Florida 
actually leads all states in convictions from 1999 to 2008.
All in all, we cannot expect the government to function as seamlessly as the exhibits in 
this chapter indicate. The government will often make mistakes, the bureaucracy will be 
inefficient and slow, and politicians can be corrupt, seeking to capture the process of deci­
sion making and exploiting it for their own benefit or their own ideological ends. When 
evaluating government policies, these costs of government have to be considered. How 
Corruption refers to the misuse of 
public funds or the distortion of the 
allocation of resources for personal 
gain.

these costs weigh against the benefits of government determine, to a large degree, whether 
the government is a night watchman or a central commander of resources.
Underground Economy
You have likely seen lawn care workers, snow shovelers, and babysitters handed cash for 
their work. Or you may have a waiter friend who makes killer tips but does not report them 
on his taxes. The underground economy, sometimes also referred to as the black market, 
includes activities, such as those above, where income taxes are not paid, as well as illegal 
activities, such as drug dealing and prostitution.
In modern economies, black markets cover an array of activities and are generally found 
in areas where the benefits of such activities are the highest—either because of high tax 
rates or because the activity is illegal and therefore the good is not provided in the formal 
market.
One prime example of an underground economy created because of an illegal product was 
the result of Prohibition in the 1920s. After the United States outlawed alcohol in 1919, smug­
glers arranged deliveries to speakeasies and private bars. The result was an era of big organized 
crime—think of Al Capone—and an estimated $500 million in lost tax revenues annually. 
Such an example illustrates some of the problems that an underground economy generates:
	
1.	 When they involve goods and services that have been legally banned, the under­
ground economy undermines the ban.
	
2.	 When underground transactions occur in markets for legal goods and services in 
order to avoid taxes or regulations, they put legitimate businesses at a disadvantage.
	
3.	 To compensate for the lost revenue, governments must levy higher taxes.
	
4.	 Criminals spend vast resources trying to evade the law (and authorities spend 
­resources to catch criminals), which are not effective uses of society’s resources.
The equity-efficiency trade-off 
refers to the trade-off between 
ensuring an equitable allocation 
of resources (equity) and increasing 
social surplus or total output 
(efficiency).
The trade-off between equity and 
efficiency represents the nub of the 
conflict between those who support 
big government and those who call 
for smaller government.
It is worth emphasizing that despite all these government failures, government intervention 
often plays important social roles, such as redistributing resources to ensure a more equita­
ble society. The core issue when governments redistribute resources, fully recognizing that 
this does entail some inefficiencies, revolves around the equity-efficiency trade-off. The 
equity-efficiency trade-off refers to the trade-off between ensuring an equitable allocation 
of resources (equity) and increasing social surplus or total output (efficiency). Most would 
agree that equity and efficiency are the two most important goals for government policy.
Exhibit 10.17 depicts the typical trade-off society faces. What it shows is that the two goals—
equity and efficiency—are often, but not always, in conflict. When social inequality is high, 
above the point marked A in the exhibit, further increases in inequality 
reduce social surplus: as we move up the vertical axis, further increas­
ing social inequality, we also move down the horizontal axis, reducing 
social surplus. This could be for several reasons: for example, greater 
social inequality prevents some people from competing with others 
on a level playing field or increases conflict in society, creating distor­
tions via this channel. But for levels of social inequality below point 
A, further declines in inequality also come at the cost of lower social 
surplus, for example, because of the deadweight losses involved in re­
distributive taxation. Now as we limit social inequality moving down 
the vertical axis, we also move down the horizontal axis, reducing 
social surplus. This trade-off between equity and efficiency represents the nub of the conflict 
between those who support big government and those who call for smaller government.
Where do you want to be along this curve? This is a decision problem that social welfare-
maximizing governments have to confront. But economic analysis informs us on how the 
government can do this best. For instance, economic analysis helps us understand where 
point A is located, beyond which there is no trade-off between reducing social inequality 
and reducing social surplus. Below this point, however, the choice crucially depends on 
value judgments. Some people would prefer to live in a fairly efficient society even if this

comes at the cost of considerable social inequality (corresponding to a point like B). ­Others 
would be willing to put up with greater inefficiencies and lower social surplus in order to 
achieve greater equality (approaching the origin). In a broad sense, the portion of the curve 
between the origin and point A represents the dividing line between Democrats and Repub­
licans: Presidents Clinton and Obama have emphasized the importance of reducing social 
inequality, for example, arguing that the rich need to pay more in taxes. Presidents Reagan 
and George W. Bush, on the other hand, have argued that high tax rates distort decisions 
and have opted for tax reforms based on efficiency grounds.
The actual fact is that all developed nations seek to achieve some degree of equality in 
their society. The welfare state refers to the set of insurance, regulation, and transfer pro­
grams utilized to create a safety net, reduce poverty, and redistribute income from the rich 
to the poor. In the United States, for example, the welfare state comprises several programs, 
such as Medicaid and food stamps, which are targeted to the poor. The welfare state is 
even more expansive in Europe. Despite the deadweight loss associated with such systems, 
many European nations choose to promote some degree of equality in income.
The welfare state refers to the 
set of insurance, regulation, 
and transfer programs operated 
by the government, including 
unemployment benefits, pensions, 
and government-run and financed 
healthcare.
Consumer sovereignty is the view 
that choices made by a consumer 
reflect his or her true preferences, 
and outsiders, including the 
government, should not interfere 
with these choices.
Exhibit 10.17 The Equity–Efficiency Trade-off
The government can often achieve greater 
social equality but only at the expense of 
greater inefficiencies, thus introducing a trade-
off between equity and efficiency over a certain 
range. When social inequality is very high, 
there may be no conflict between equity and 
efficiency.

Beyond promoting equality, some economists have argued that government intervention 
is necessary because individuals may suffer from decision errors or may find it difficult to 
evaluate certain choices. For example, many people do not have the finance background 
necessary to navigate the world of retirement savings account options. In such situations, 
they can make mistakes that are costly to themselves. Should the government try to prevent 
them from making such mistakes?
One answer as to whether the government should engage in these types of actions relates 
to the concept of consumer sovereignty. Consumer sovereignty is the view that choices 
made by a consumer reflect his or her true preferences, and outsiders, including the govern­
ment, should not interfere with these choices. Some economists argue that we should evalu­
ate all resource allocations according to the preferences of consumers at the time they make 
a decision. If those preferences are wrong or turn out to be wrong after the fact, so be it.
At the other end of the spectrum is paternalism. Paternalism is the view that consumers 
do not always know what is best for them, and the government should encourage or induce 
them to change their actions. Many crucial reformers who played important roles in the 
founding of the welfare state, from William Beveridge in the United Kingdom to Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson in the United States, hold this view. This approach 
gives the government an active hand in helping individuals make the right decisions and in 
designing choices so that people make the right decisions when they are unlikely to do so 
by themselves.
The Social Security system in the United States, which forces individuals to save for 
old age, is born out of paternalism. Laws that ban substance abuse are also motivated, in

part, by paternalism. By contrast, in a world with no externalities, consumer sovereignty 
would allow individuals to consume as many drugs as possible, even if they are addictive 
and potentially harmful.
In fact, the big difference between paternalism and consumer sovereignty is again a nor­
mative one. How much do we value consumer sovereignty in and of itself? And how much 
do we want to allow the government to interfere in individual decision making? It’s a murky 
area. Nevertheless, economists find their voices on both sides of the debate. We briefly re­
view both sides now.
The Debate
Those economists toward the paternalistic end of the spectrum would probably say that 
some mistakes simply result from the fact that individuals are not used to making deci­
sions of a certain type. For example, most people, when first confronted with investing in 
the stock market may not understand the implications of their decisions. One role of this 
economics course is to educate you in economic decision making. In the same way, those 
who want government to take an active role would approve of the government’s provision 
of information so that people can make better decisions. In their view, this is not a viola­
tion of consumer sovereignty; in fact, it corresponds to a strengthening of it because better 
decisions are a result of better information.
Some economists go somewhat further and suggest that the government should also play 
the role of “nudging” individuals in the right direction. If the government is convinced, for 
example, that individuals are not saving enough for retirement, or are making investment 
choices that are too risky, then it can design savings schemes to encourage people to save 
more or to invest in less risky assets.
The pure consumer sovereignty view would be that the government’s business is not to 
“nudge” people into choices they can make on their own. Economists favoring this view 
would suggest that any kind of paternalism requires that some group of people (the govern­
ment, the elite, intellectuals) knows what’s good for consumers. Although this may some­
times be true, it generally raises several philosophical and practical problems. How can the 
government make extremely complicated decisions for us? How can we trust the govern­
ment to really have our interests in mind? How can we distinguish between differences 
in opinions and preferences and those cases in which people really are making mistakes?
Beyond these questions, it is important to note that every government intervention is 
costly and paid for by tax revenues. Thus, every activity relinquished to the government in­
creases the deadweight loss that society faces. In the end, we urge you to be the judge of how 
acceptable you find government intervention in individual choices. It is a normative question.
 
Evidence-Based Economics
A
s you have probably concluded by now, this question is difficult to answer, because 
it will depend on your value judgments. We can probably state with some certainty, 
however, that a minimal amount of government intervention in the economy is 
necessary. An economy needs some amount of law and order, some national defense, some 
regulation, some redistribution, and so on. So, most people would agree that government 
needs to be in the picture in some way.
But that still leaves a broad range, and you have to use your own value judgments 
to decide where you want to be in that range. Economics can be helpful in guiding you 
within this range and in deciding on the types of activities in which government should be 
involved. Rather than answering the question “Is more government good or bad?” econom­
ics is useful in helping us evaluate the costs and benefits of government intervention and in 
suggesting potential ways of designing better government policies.

Let’s consider two specific areas to make our general point about how the tools of 
­economics can help you think about the optimal size of government.
1.  As we have shown, a major efficiency loss of taxation is deadweight loss. Thus, the 
debate on the reach of government should hinge on the effect of its actions: the larger the 
deadweight loss, the worse the policy, all else equal. In those cases with large deadweight 
losses, one can make the argument that it is a bad place for the government to intervene.
2.  The government typically operates in a slow-moving manner. A significant drag on 
the economy can result if regulators cannot move swiftly in response to changing market 
conditions.
We now focus on the first of these and then discuss the second in the box at the end of this 
section.
A first consideration with this approach is that a heavy reliance on income taxation 
may result in more deadweight loss than a broader spectrum of taxes (federal sales tax, 
­estate taxes, etc.). This is because deadweight loss is increasing geometrically with the tax 
rate (i.e., all else equal it is better to have many small tax rates rather than one large one 
­because the large one has a lot of deadweight loss). In this sense, when formulating poli­
cies we should always compare the marginal deadweight loss of the last dollar raised from 
different sources of taxation to the marginal benefit of an additional dollar of tax revenue. 
For a tax that distorts behavior, the marginal benefit may not be worth the deadweight loss, 
which suggests the need to decrease this tax.
Let’s think about the income tax more carefully and see if it distorts people’s decision 
to work. At the extremes……
In the United States, the bulk of tax revenue is raised from income taxes. At the ­extremes, 
economists have a pretty good idea of the impact of income taxes on a worker’s decision 
to supply labor. If there is a 100 percent tax on income, then there is really no reason to 
work—your take-home pay would always be $0! A tax that large is likely to be labeled 
absolutely inefficient by economists because the cost to society of no one working would 
be much larger than the tax revenue generated.
But what if the tax rate was closer to present levels of the marginal federal tax rate 
(25 percent for someone earning $40,000 a year; see Exhibit 10.6)? If Americans get 
to keep 75 cents of every dollar that they earn, will everyone stop working or will they 
just carry on as if there were no tax on their income at all? The elasticity of labor sup­
ply gives us an easy number to assess this question. Remember that elasticities are just 
a percentage change in quantity divided by a percentage change in price. In the case of 
labor supply, the tax rate changes the price of working—how much you get paid—and 
the quantity is the number of hours worked.
If the supply of labor is elastic, then the number of hours someone works is very sensi­
tive to the wage rate. Thus, an increase in income taxes will have a large impact on labor 
supply. This lost work will create a lot of deadweight loss. But if labor supply is inelastic, 
then a tax increase won’t cause a big change in the number of hours a worker supplies, 
which means that the size of the deadweight loss won’t be large.
To estimate the elasticity of labor supply, economists have used data taken from work­
ers’ responses to large changes in income tax rates. Early empirical studies found that the 
Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s led to around a 6 percent increase in the number of hours 
worked—resulting in a relatively large elasticity estimate.5 However, when economists 
used richer data sets to estimate the same elasticity, they found a very small elasticity esti­
mate, ranging between 0 and 0.1.6
As research progressed, economists began to focus on the impact of tax rates on a 
worker’s reported taxable income. Initial analysis found very high elasticities of between 
1.3 and 1.5,7 but much of the early research on this topic looked only at the short-run 
response to higher marginal tax rates. However, this can be different from the long-run

elasticity, because individuals may respond more strongly to a temporary change in taxes 
(that is, you may want to work more for a year if taxes are very low during that year, 
but if taxes are very low permanently you may not end up working as hard). Subsequent 
research focusing on long-run elasticities in fact yielded much smaller estimates.
In general, these estimates suggest that the labor supply results have been decidedly 
mixed. This is probably why the two views of labor taxation persist today, and why this 
topic represents an important area for future research. As soon as the estimates begin to 
point to a smaller elasticity range, economists will be able to provide more precise ­estimates 
of the deadweight loss of income taxation.
But the size of government isn’t just a question of how inefficient it is to raise tax 
revenues. Even if there is very little deadweight loss associated with raising taxes, the 
sorts of government failures discussed above might also tip the scale against government 
intervention. Quantitative analysis of such government failures is another active area of 
current research.
Evidence-Based Economics (Continued) 
A glimpse into the possibility that the government may 
operate more slowly than private, profit-seeking enter-
prises is provided by a study comparing the success rates 
of government-funded expeditions to the North Pole and 
Northwest Passage versus privately funded ­voyages.8 
The research, conducted by economist Jonathan ­Karpoff, 
found that privately funded expeditions were smaller, 
cheaper, less likely to lose personnel, less likely to lose 
their ships, and more likely to achieve their objective. 
Plus, the difference in outcomes between private and 
public expeditions was large. For example, publicly 
funded expeditions had an average of 5.9 deaths versus 
0.9 deaths per privately funded expeditions.
Karpoff was able to go a step further and see why 
­privately funded expeditions were so much more suc-
cessful than public expeditions. He found that their chief 
advantage was an ability to adapt to new technology 
quickly. Many publicly funded expeditions were so slow 
to adapt to new technology that they didn’t even sup-
plement their crew’s diets with vitamin C, even though 
knowledge of the relationship between scurvy and vita-
min C deficiency had been known for centuries. Privately 
funded expeditions also developed innovations of their 
own. Chief among these was their ability to learn from 
the native population about shelter, clothing systems, 
and overland travel.
This research provides one example of the nimbleness 
of private voyages compared to that of public voyages. 
Although not definitive, it provides an example of how 
the tools of economics can help you think about the opti-
mal extent of government intervention. How general this 
result is remains a question, but it does illustrate a com-
mon criticism of big government: its slow movement can 
be a drag on economic efficiency.

Summary
Government can play an important role in ensuring that markets are 
competitive, efficient, and equitable.
Key roles of the government include: taxation to raise funds to provide 
public goods such as national defense, policing, and infrastructure investments 
that would not be provided adequately by the market; the use of tax and transfer 
programs in order to achieve a more equitable distribution of resources in society; 
and the use of taxes and subsidies as well as regulation to correct market failures.
The costs of government interventions must be compared carefully with their 
benefits.
Economics is most useful not as a value judgment on whether government 
is good or bad, but in understanding what sorts of activities require government 
intervention.

Is there discrimination  
in the labor market?
As she withdrew her nomination from the 2008 Democratic 
primary, Senator Hillary Rodham ­Clinton noted that “although 
we weren’t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling 
this time, thanks to you it’s got about eighteen thousand cracks 
in it.” The “glass ceiling” that she referred to implies that there 
is a limit to how far certain individuals—in this case, women—can 
climb in the workforce. Does a glass ceiling really exist in the U.S. 
labor market?
As always, data help us answer the question. One interesting 
fact is that over the past several decades, women have represented 
at most 3 percent of U.S. CEOs. Why do women appear to be 
so underrepresented in the upper echelons of companies? Is the 
discrepancy because of discrimination against women? Is it because 
they tend to take time away from working to raise their children?
The lack of women at the top of companies is only the tip of the iceberg when 
it comes to differences across people in labor markets. For example, in the past 
several decades, for every ­dollar men earned, women earned roughly 80 cents. 
Similar differences are found when comparing people of different race, age, and 
even physical attractiveness!
Can economics explain such differences?

Section 11.1  |  The Competitive Labor Market
291
So far, we have focused our attention on goods that we as consumers buy: 
cell phones, cheese boxes, cakes, and electricity. In this chapter we examine 
what producers buy: inputs to produce those goods. The major inputs that we 
will consider are labor, machines (physical capital), and land. In so doing, we 
explore reasons why people earn different wages in the labor market, and why 
some rise to the top while others remain at mid-level. Our discussion of the 
labor market will bring us to a general understanding of the determinants of 
wages. When thinking about how well our model represents the real world, we 
will return to our opening question.
KEY IDEAS
The three main factors of production are labor, physical capital, 
and land.
Firms derive the demand for labor by determining the value of marginal 
product of labor.
The supply of labor is determined by trading off the marginal benefit 
from labor given by earnings against the marginal cost, the value of 
foregone leisure.
Wage inequality can be attributed to differences in human capital, 
differences in compensating wages, and discrimination in the job market.
In addition to labor, a producer must derive the demand for physical 
capital and land to achieve its production objectives.
The market for labor is of particular importance in the economy because it affects all of us. 
You are directly influenced by the labor market when you are looking for a job or are em-
ployed and earning money. In this chapter, instead of firms acting as suppliers, as we have 
seen so far, firms are the buyers (demanders) of labor. And, individuals, 
like you, are the suppliers of labor.
The market for labor, then, is composed of suppliers (workers) and 
demanders (firms). Workers produce goods and services and there-
fore are known as factors of production—a term we’ve met before in 
­Chapter 6. Remember that a factor of production is used in the produc-
tion of other goods.
The markets for factors of production are somewhat different from 
markets for goods and services that we consume because the demand 
for factors of production is derived from the demand for final goods and 
services. A firm first makes the decision to produce a good or service 
and then decides which factors to use to produce that good or service.
Although firms tend to use many factors of production, the main 
factors that we will focus on are labor, machines (physical capital), and 
land. For instance, consider the iPad. To produce it, Apple uses labor 
(in the form of computer hardware and software engineers), physical 
capital (in the form of machinery to build the good), and land (from 
Cupertino, California to Chengdu, China to house its various produc-
tion sites).
The Competitive Labor Market
11.1
In the market for labor, the roles of demander and 
­supplier are reversed: Businesses are buyers (demanders) 
of labor and individual workers are suppliers.

11.3
The Demand for Labor
A typical firm in modern economies uses dozens, likely hundreds, 
of different machines, ranging from computers to lasers to old-
fashioned assembly lines. Nevertheless, all firms rely on labor as 
a major factor of production. Workers operate machines and ­often 
perform tasks more efficiently than machines because ­human 
­beings have judgment skills that machines still lack. In this sense, a firm’s desire to achieve 
its production objectives causes it to demand labor.
Let us return to The Wisconsin Cheeseman, the cheese-packing firm we discussed in 
Chapter 6. We’ll begin by holding fixed the other factors of production that this company 
uses—physical capital and land—and focus exclusively on labor. That is, we will focus on 
the short-run decisions facing The Cheeseman. We’ll also assume that this company is a 
price-taker in the product market.
We saw in Chapter 6 that The Wisconsin Cheeseman can increase the production of 
cheese boxes by employing more people. Exhibit 11.1 shows the relationship between the 
number of cheese boxes produced and the number of workers employed. The numbers that 
underlie the figure are shown in Exhibit 11.2. Exhibits 11.1 and 11.2 make clear the Law 
of Diminishing Returns, which we studied in Chapter 6. Recall that this law states that the 
marginal productivity of an additional unit of labor eventually decreases as we increase the 
number of workers.
From Chapter 6, we are familiar with the first three columns in Exhibit 11.2. For 
­example, column (3) gives the marginal product of labor. This informs us of how many 
more cheese boxes will be produced when The Cheeseman hires another worker. When 
we multiply this number by the price of cheese boxes, we obtain the value of marginal 
product of labor (VMPL). The VMPL is the contribution of an additional worker to a 
firm’s revenues; it is equal to the marginal product of labor times the price of a cheese 
box. For mathematical clarity, we assume the price of a cheese box is $2, so column (4) 
obtains the value of marginal product of labor by multiplying the number in column (3) 
with 2.
Now assume that The Wisconsin Cheeseman currently employs 14 workers and is con-
sidering expanding its workforce. Exhibit 11.2 shows that the value of the marginal product 
of the 15th worker is $110 per day (additional revenue = VMPL = 55 additional boxes of 
cheese × $2 per box = $110). If The Cheeseman is maximizing its profits, should it hire 
the 15th worker?
Let’s start with a daily wage of $118. Should The Cheeseman expand to the 15th worker? 
No. We know this because the value of adding the last worker is his VMPL—$110 for the 
15th worker. It is not profitable to pay a worker $118 who brings in only an additional 
$110 in revenues.
Exhibit 11.1 The Cheeseman’s 
Production Function
The production function 
­describes the number of cheese 
boxes that The ­Cheeseman can 
produce by hiring additional 
­workers. Crucially, eventually 
each additional worker that 
The Cheeseman hires has a 
smaller incremental effect on 
the number of cheese boxes 
produced, demonstrating the 
Law of Diminishing Returns.

The Cheeseman is tasked with 
choosing how much output 
to generate per day and how 
many employees to hire to 
produce that level of output. 
The table summarizes the 
number of workers the firm 
will need for any given level of 
output and how much value 
each additional worker adds. 
Column 1 shows cheese boxes 
produced per day, column 2  
shows number of workers 
­employed, column 3 shows the 
marginal output produced by 
each additional worker, and 
column 4 shows the VMPL,

What about at a daily wage of $105? Now the story changes. Hiring the 15th worker 
increases profits because the daily wage is less than the additional revenue of $110. The 
implication is that for The Cheeseman to be optimally purchasing labor—not paying more 
than it’s worth—it expands its workforce until the VMPL = wage.
This optimizing action enables us to translate the value of marginal product of the firm 
into its labor demand. Exhibit 11.3 illustrates the labor demand of The Wisconsin Cheese-
man, which traces the value of marginal product shown in ­Exhibit 11.2. The labor demand 
curve of a firm is downward-sloping because its value of marginal product is decreasing—a 
consequence of the Law of Diminishing Returns. In Exhibit 11.3, we assume that the market 
wage rate is $110 per day. At this wage, the optimal number of workers for The Cheeseman 
to hire is 15, where the demand for labor intersects the market wage. 
Two ideas are implicit in this derivation, and it is useful to spell them out. First, The 
Wisconsin Cheeseman sells its cheese boxes in a competitive market, and therefore from 
Exhibit 11.3 Demand for Labor
We can depict the quantity of 
labor demanded at each wage 
rate. In orange, we assume that 
the marginal cost of an addi-
tional worker is $110. This allows 
us to identify the equilibrium 
quantity of 15 employees, where 
VMPL = wage.

Chapter 6 we know that it can sell as many cheese boxes as it wants at the market price. 
Second, we assume that the labor market is also competitive, so The Cheeseman can hire 
as many workers as it wishes at the market wage.
We have now seen two ways in which a firm like The Wisconsin Cheeseman maximizes 
its profits:
	
1.	 In Chapter 6, it chose the total quantity of production in order to maximize profits, and 
we saw that this led to the condition: expand production until marginal cost = price.
	
2.	 In this chapter, we see that the firm maximizes profits by optimally choosing its 
labor by expanding its workforce until the marginal product of labor × price = 
VMPL = wage.
How do these two conditions relate to each other? Do they conflict? That is, does a com-
petitive firm struggle to optimize the number of employees it hires while simultaneously 
optimizing its output?
Reassuringly, these two conditions are identical: once one is in place, the other follows. 
To see this, divide both sides of
Marginal product of labor × Price = Wage.
by the marginal product of labor (MPL), which leads to
Price =  Wage
MPL .
This is simply the wage divided by the marginal product of labor. Say that an additional 
worker costs $110 per day and has a marginal product of 55 boxes of cheese. In this case, 
producing 55 more cheese boxes costs $110. Thus, the marginal cost is $110/55, or $2. This 
shows that wage/MPL equals marginal cost. Therefore,
Marginal cost = Wage
MPL
= Price. 
This derivation shows that when The Wisconsin Cheeseman expands its workforce until 
VMPL = wage, it is also producing where price = marginal cost.
Would you rather work over the summer or master 
Call of Duty?
You must decide how much to work 
and how much to “play” or simply 
“not work.”
When considering whether you should take a summer job at 
a firm like The Cheeseman, what trade-offs are you facing? 
On the one hand, you can more easily afford a new laptop if 
you decide to work, but it comes at an expense—missing out 
on fun with your friends over the summer. Economists denote 
nonpaying activities, such as having fun with your friends, as 
“leisure.”
In Chapter 5, we focused on the buyer’s problem, in which your 
choice between various goods and services determined your level of 
satisfaction. When considering the choice between labor and leisure, 
you must decide how much to work and how much to “play” or simply 
“not work.”
There would seem to be one major difference between the two sce-
narios, however. You decide whether or not to buy goods and services 
based on their prices—an iPad might cost $600, whereas a MacBook 
Pro might cost $1,200. But what’s the price of hanging out with your 
friends? Isn’t it free? Well, just as we learned in Chapter 1 that Face-
book isn’t free, the same is true for leisure. This is because the “price” 
of leisure is the opportunity cost of leisure, and that opportunity cost is 
the lost wages from not working.

So, how do you make an optimizing decision when deciding how much to work or hang 
out with your friends? By now, you likely anticipate the answer: you should set marginal 
benefits equal to marginal costs. In this case, that means you should consume leisure up to 
the point where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost, where the marginal cost is 
the wage rate. We can write this condition simply as
Marginal benefit of leisure = Wage.
Let’s put these observations into action by considering an example. Exhibit 11.4 shows 
the total days of labor supplied per year for Alice and Tom at the various wage rates. For 
example, at a wage rate of $100 per day, Alice would work 125 days per year and Tom 
would work 50 days per year. One first consideration is how the number of days worked 
changes with increases in the wage rate. Both Alice and Tom work more at higher wage 
rates. This is intuitive: if the campus bookstore offered you $64 per day (for working 8 
hours) you might not accept, but if it raised the hourly wage to $200 per day you might wait 
in line for a chance to work. Exhibit 11.5 translates Alice’s and Tom’s labor supply choices 
in Exhibit 11.4 to individual labor supply curves.
Exhibit 11.4 Total Days of 
­Labor Supplied per Year for 
Alice and Tom
Here we can see how the labor-
leisure trade-off plays out for 
Alice and Tom. For example, 
if the going rate for an 8- hour 
day is $50, Alice will work 
50 days that year, but Tom won’t 
work at all. However, at a daily 
rate of $125, Alice triples her 
annual working days to 150 days 
and Tom works 50 days.

Panel (a) depicts Alice’s annual work days at each daily wage, and panel (b) does the 
same for Tom. By summing (horizontally) the hours that Alice and Tom are willing to 
work at a given daily wage, we construct the labor market supply curve. Thus, at a 
daily wage of $175, Alice works for 200 days and Tom works for 50 days. Together 
they work 250 days at a daily wage of $175.

To construct the market supply curve, we need to aggregate the individual labor sup-
ply curves. To do this, we horizontally sum the individual labor supply curves. Suppose 
the market consists of only Alice and Tom. In this case, at a daily wage rate of $50, they 
combine to provide 50 days of work (Alice works 50 days; Tom does not work). At a daily 
wage rate of $100, they combine to provide 175 days of work (Alice works 125 days; Tom 
works 50 days). Summing at each wage level produces the market supply curve, which is 
depicted in panel (c) of Exhibit 11.5.
Labor Market Equilibrium: Supply Meets Demand
Let us now put labor demand and labor supply together and explore the equilibrium im-
plications in the cheese-packing industry. Consider Exhibit 11.6, where we aggregate over 
several hundred laborers and several dozen firms competing in the labor market for cheese 
packers. The intersection, as usual, gives the market equilibrium, which determines both 
One difficulty of measuring the labor supply curve in 
practice is that many employees do not have perfect 
­flexibility in choosing how many hours to work. For 
­example, many office workers must agree to work 9 to 5, 
and they may not have a lot of flexibility in deciding their 
overtime hours. This does not mean that the trade-off 
between earnings and leisure that we have emphasized 
is unimportant. But it does mean that estimating labor 
supply will be difficult.
An interesting study by economist Gerald Oettinger 
overcomes this difficulty by looking at the labor supply 
of stadium vendors in a major league baseball stadium 
during the season.1 These vendors, who sell hot dogs, 
beer, cotton candy, lemon ice, peanuts, popcorn, and 
soda at major-league games, are subcontractors who 
decide their own working hours. They do not receive a 
fixed wage; instead, their effective wage is determined 
by the demand for products they sell. More people at 
the games means more sales for the vendors, and people 
attend games at predictable times—particularly on the 
weekends and on nice weather days. The advantage of 
this set-up to test economic theory is that individual ven-
dors are free to set their working hours, thus approximat-
ing the situation we have modeled.
Oettinger found that the vendors, who determine 
whether or not to work on a given day simply by looking 
at a calendar and the weather forecast, worked 55 per-
cent to 65 percent more often when they expected their 
earnings to double. In essence, these vendors display 
the sort of behavior that economic theory would predict. 
Namely, when presented with a higher potential salary, 
they work more.
LETTING THE DATA SPEAK
“Get Your Hot Dogs Here!”
You might recall that in Chapter 8, you accepted a free-
lance job producing Web sites and computer programs. 
Let’s say that your wage was $10 per hour. If your employer 
raised your wage to $10,000 per hour, would that lure you 
to work more hours? For many, the answer may not be 
completely obvious. On the one hand, you can maintain 
a nice lifestyle by working very few hours if you are paid 
$10,000 per hour. On the other hand, the cost of leisure—
your foregone wages—just increased by a great deal.
An economic analysis of the problem does not imply 
that along the entire wage range labor supply slopes 
up when wages go up. Over the wage range that most 
people think about, it does make sense that on average, 
people work more for more money, just like Alice and 
Tom. This is called the substitution effect, a term that we 
introduced in the Appendix to Chapter 5. The substitu-
tion effect implies that when the price of leisure increases, 
people will substitute into working more (and relaxing 
less).
However, another term we discussed in Chapter 5 is the 
income effect, which implies that when wages increase, 
your total income increases and you can afford more ex-
pensive things, such as more leisure time. The relative 
strength of these opposing forces on each individual’s 
decision making determines the slope of his or her labor 
supply curve.
Economists have explored many situations to de-
termine whether the slope of the labor supply curve is 
positive or negative. What do you think they found? One 
example is in the next “Letting the Data Speak.”

the equilibrium wage rate and the amount of labor supplied and demanded in the market. 
The market supply and demand curves allow us to further our understanding of how differ-
ent factors affect the market demand and market supply of labor.
Labor Demand Shifters
There are several key determinants of where the labor demand curve will be situated. Two 
important factors are:
	
1.	 Price of the good that the firm is producing
	
2.	 Technology of the firm
Concerning the price of the good that the firm is producing, let’s again consider The 
Wisconsin Cheeseman. Assume that the popularity of cheese increases, which causes a 
rightward shift in the market demand curve for cheese boxes. This shift increases the equi-
librium price of cheese boxes. The higher price increases the VMPL—the value of marginal 
product of laborers who pack cheese. This in turn will cause The Cheeseman and other 
firms in the industry to demand more workers, leading to a rightward shift of the labor 
demand curve (to D2), as shown in Exhibit 11.7. This shift will cause the equilibrium wage 
and employment level to increase, as shown in the exhibit.
A second factor that shifts the labor demand curve is the technology of the firm. For 
example, assume that robots take over part of the cheese-packing process, lowering the 
marginal product of labor. This could happen if the robots were a substitute for labor and 
leaves workers doing menial tasks that are not as productive as cheese packing. How would 
that affect the labor demand curve? This would cause the labor demand curve to shift to 
the left, lowering equilibrium wages and employment levels. This type of technology is de-
noted as a labor-saving technology. It is a type of technology that substitutes for existing 
labor inputs, reducing the marginal product of labor.
There are also labor-complementary technologies, such as the case when an auto-
mated process increases cheese packers’ productivity. Labor-complementary technologies 
are those that complement existing labor inputs, increasing the marginal product of labor. 
Workers can now pack many more boxes because of the technology. Such a change in 
technology that increases the marginal product of labor shifts the labor demand curve to 
the right, as shown in Exhibit 11.7.
Labor Supply Shifters
Shifts in labor supply also affect equilibrium wage and employment levels. We discuss 
three main factors that shift labor supply:
	
1.	 Population changes
	
2.	 Changes in worker preferences and tastes
	
3.	 Opportunity costs
Labor-saving technology is a type 
of technology that substitutes for 
existing labor inputs, reducing the 
marginal product of labor.
Labor-complementary technologies 
are technologies that complement 
existing labor inputs, increasing the 
marginal product of labor.

11.2
Let’s discuss each in turn.
In terms of population changes, the Census Bureau projects that the U.S. population will 
grow from its current 313 million people to 393 million people by 2050—an increase of 
roughly 80 million people. This is because of both a greater number of births and immigra-
tion. The immigration projections tell an interesting story—the Census Bureau estimates 
that 60 percent of the population increase will be attributable to immigration. In the sim-
plest scenario, when immigrants move into an area, the supply of workers increases. This 
increase causes the labor supply curve to shift rightward, as in Exhibit 11.8. Such a shift 
causes lower wages and higher employment levels.
Changes in preferences and taste also affect the labor supply. In 1975, 46.3 percent of 
women were working. By 2009, this number had increased to greater than 60 percent. One 
explanation for this phenomenon is that women might have more of a “taste” for work than 
they did decades ago. This could have occurred because many women began entering the 
labor force during the mobilization for World War II and continued to do so, especially 
over the last three decades. Over time, preferences may have evolved such that women now 
are both more willing to, and are socially expected to, participate in the labor market than 
they were before World War II. As more and more women enter the labor market, the labor 
supply curve shifts rightward, as in Exhibit 11.8. Because women have higher college en-
rollment rates than men (71.3 percent as compared with 61.3 percent for 2012 high school 
Exhibit 11.8 A Shift in the

Through an increase in the 
labor force population, a shift 
in tastes, or a reduction in out-
side opportunities, more work-
ers are willing to work at any

graduates according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics), this change in preference might be 
here to stay because more women will likely want to reap the returns from their education 
by entering the labor market.
Finally, opportunity costs play a role. For example, if we focus on the labor market for 
cheese packers, if other job opportunities diminish, the workforce of potential cheese pack-
ers grows. More specifically, if the local steel mill shuts down, many workers will be unem-
ployed and looking for work. Some of them will turn to cheese packing, and this increase in 
the number of workers willing to pack cheese will shift the labor supply curve rightward, as 
in Exhibit 11.8. This shift, in turn, will lead to lower wages for cheese packers.
When might opportunity costs lead to a lower number of cheese packers? Think of 
the case where a new Toyota plant opens in the city. Now cheese packers have better 
job opportunities, and therefore some of them begin working at the new Toyota plant. 
This will cause the labor supply curve for cheese packers to shift leftward, raising 
equilibrium wages.
To test whether an increase in labor supply leads to lower 
wages, economist Joshua Angrist turned to the Palestinian 
occupied territories in the West Bank of the Jordan River 
and the Gaza Strip.2 These territories were captured by Israel 
from Jordan and Egypt in 1967. Though their economies 
flourished due to the integration with Israel, no institutions 
of higher education existed in the area for another five 
years. Accordingly, anyone pursuing a university degree had 
to leave to do so, and similarly, anyone in these territories 
with a university degree had earned it elsewhere.
In 1972, to increase employment opportunities for 
­Palestinians in occupied territories, Israel spearheaded the 
creation of twenty institutions of higher education in the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip. As you might expect, these 
new institutions dramatically and rapidly increased the 
­local supply of workers with a higher education.
Using data gathered from the Territories Labor Force 
Survey between 1981 and 1991, Angrist found that the 
average schooling level of men ages 18 to 64 increased 
from 7.7 years in 1981 to 8.65 years in 1991. The frac-
tion of the labor force with at least 13 years of school-
ing increased by five percentage points, and the fraction 
with less than 12 years of schooling fell by fourteen per-
centage points. Between 1981 and 1986 alone, over 
6,600 students graduated from a university in the West 
Bank or the Gaza Strip. In this same span of time, wages 
earned by highly educated workers—those with 13 or 
more years of schooling—dropped significantly. Before 
the increase in educated labor supply, highly educated 
workers earned up to 40 percent more than high school 
graduates. However, after the increase they earned less 
than 20 percent more.
Does this prove that an increase in labor supply lowers 
wages? It is certainly consistent with that notion, but it is 
important to recognize that there may be other explana-
tions for what we see in the data. For example, neighbor-
ing Jordan funded a portion of public-sector employment 
in the territories, but the growth of its economy slowed 
around 1982. This likely staunched the flow of resources 
into the territories, pulling wages and employment 
down, while strikes, curfews, and civil disorder during 
the ­Palestinian uprising could also be partly responsible 
for the lower earnings of highly educated workers in the 
­Palestinian territories.
LETTING THE DATA SPEAK
Do Wages Really Go Down if Labor Supply Increases?
The model of the labor market we developed in the previous section determines a single 
equilibrium wage for a single industry. In practice, there is considerable inequality in wages 
and earnings among workers within a given industry and across industries. Exhibit 11.9 
shows the distribution of average wages for hourly workers in the United States in 2012.
The exhibit puts workers into one of ten groups. People in the first group represent 
­workers in the lowest 10 percent of earners. People in the tenth group represent the 
top 10 percent of earners. Groups between these two extremes represent earners from 
10 percent to 20 percent (Group 2), 20 percent to 30 percent (Group 3), and so on. 
What we readily observe from Exhibit 11.9 is that the top-earning workers earn much

more than other workers. In fact, these workers earn more than 5 times what the lowest-
earning workers are paid.
Why do these differences in wages arise? How can we extend our model of labor market 
equilibrium to incorporate them? We turn to a discussion of three important features of the 
labor market that may give rise to differences in wages across workers:
	
1.	 Differences in human capital
	
2.	 Differences in compensating wages
	
3.	 The nature and extent of discrimination in the job market
Differences in Human Capital
One explanation for the wage differences observed in Exhibit 11.9 is that people have very 
different levels of skills and therefore different levels of productivity. Economists refer to 
each person’s stock of skills for producing output or economic value as human capital. 
Differences in human capital result in differences in wages.
One major source of human capital differences is education attainment. You and every-
one in your class are working to increase the knowledge that you can use in your working 
life. Mathematics will help you solve problems and train your reasoning skills, econom-
ics will help you to develop an ability to evaluate the consequences of your actions, and 
English will help you to better express your ideas. All of these skills, and many more, are 
necessary to produce competitively many goods and services.
Another way to improve your human capital is through experience. The empirical evi-
dence shows that the more time you spend at a particular job, the more productive you 
will become. This type of productivity increase tends to be either job-specific or industry-
specific. Job-specific (or firm-specific) human capital is accrued when a worker learns 
Human capital is each person’s 
stock of skills for producing output 
or economic value.

Many union advocates argue that firms should pay for 
all training sessions. After all, a good training program 
makes workers better at their job—that is, training makes 
them more productive.
We must remember that in a competitive market, any 
worker who has improved basic (“general”) skills will also 
be more productive in general . . . at any firm. So, firms 
will compete for this worker until they push wages up to 
the value of marginal product of labor. But this means 
that the worker collects all of the gains from his training 
(by receiving a higher wage). This means that the firm 
providing the training does not gain anything from its 
training expenditure, but the worker does gain from hav-
ing the general training (he has a higher wage). There-
fore, the firm will have no ­incentive to invest in basic 
skills training, but the worker himself will have a strong 
incentive to do so. Workers are often able to invest in 
their basic skills on the job by taking a wage cut so as to 
indirectly “pay” for their training costs (that is, to com-
pensate the firm that is incurring these costs but has 
nothing to gain from this training). 
The same is not true for job-specific training, how-
ever. Job-specific training results in gains to a worker’s 
employer (in terms of the worker’s productivity), but it 
does not result in gains to the worker in the labor market. 
Because the worker will have no market gains from job-
specific training, he will not pay for this training. But the 
firm will gladly pay.
This reasoning suggests that under our economic 
framework, firms should be willing to pay only for job-
specific training. The workers themselves should bear the 
costs of improving their general skills.
CHOICE & CONSEQUENCE
Paying for Worker Training
how best to complete a task at her specific job, but that experience does not make her more 
productive when working for other firms. For example, learning how to operate a unique 
inventory system gives a worker a skill that translates to more productivity in her firm, but 
not necessarily to more productivity in other firms.
In contrast, industry-specific training may be accrued when a mechanic learns how to 
change tires and thus becomes more productive not only in his own firm, but also in com-
peting firms. One often cited factor explaining why men earn more money than women is 
because women tend to spend more time out of the labor force. Because of this, they are 
able to accrue less job-specific and industry-specific human capital.
Differences in Compensating Wage Differentials
Just as people achieve different levels of education with their schooling choices, they also 
choose different types of work. For example, some work is very high risk—construction 
work, trucking, mining, and military service are all industries with significant mortality 
rates. For the labor market to be in equilibrium, it must be true that the marginal worker is 
paid a wage high enough so that he is indifferent between working in his current job and 
working in his best lower-risk (but lower-wage) alternative.
The wage differences that are used to attract workers to otherwise undesirable occupa-
tions are known as compensating wage differentials. Wage differentials based on risk and 
unpleasantness are important factors to consider when examining wage differences across 
jobs, but there are also reasons why we may see workers in the same job getting paid dif-
ferently. For instance, the office conditions might be unpleasant, local housing prices and 
rents might be high, or the local air quality might be low.
We can see some evidence of compensating differentials at work in Exhibit 11.10, 
which lists average annual salaries taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For example, 
consider the case of the fast-food cook versus the garbage collector. Both positions have 
no degree requirements and involve relatively little training, but garbage collectors are paid 
nearly twice the annual salary of fast-food cooks. Why? Again, it is important to remember 
that an equilibrium wage makes the marginal person with a particular set of skills indif-
ferent to either job. In this case, it is likely that in order to motivate individuals to wake up 
early and be willing to handle refuse as their job, they would need more pay than for a life 
of fast-paced food preparation.
Discrimination in the Job Market
Will workers with the same productivity always receive the same wage for exactly the 
same job? Will they even be hired for the same job? Not necessarily. A third major factor 
Compensating wage differentials 
are wage premiums paid to attract 
workers to otherwise undesirable 
occupations.

What do you want to be when you grow up? As a child, you 
probably thought about this question from time to time, 
and now, as a college student, you may have honed your 
thinking to exclude certain careers. Among the excluded 
careers may be those of garbage collector, sewage worker, 
or truck driver. Given the choice between becoming a truck 
driver and, say, a teacher, the majority of students would 
probably opt for a career path devoted to enriching the 
minds of youths. The job of teacher is well respected, fea-
tures reasonable hours, and includes summers off. Driving 
a truck is monotonous, dangerous, and sedentary (one of 
the authors of this book has realized this firsthand!).
But what if you learned that the average starting salary 
for a teacher coming out of college was around $33,000 per 
year, and the average salary for a truck driver was $51,000? 
Would you be tempted? What if you learned that being 
a truck driver in Iraq could get you squarely into the six 
­figures? Now would you reconsider?
The economic principle at work here is a compensat-
ing wage differential. If a job is relatively more dangerous, 
dirty, or in some other way undesirable, employers must 
use incentives to lure potential workers away from easier 
and cleaner jobs. In considering which careers to pursue, 
people take into account both wages and the amenities 
of the job—things like convenient hours, prestige, on-the-
job risks, and difficulty. When the amenities make a job 
more appealing, lower wages may be offered because of 
the number of other incentives. If the amenities are largely 
negative, however, employers must offer higher wages to 
attract qualified laborers, which is why teachers and bank 
tellers make significantly less money than truck drivers.
How much less? How much would you require in extra 
compensation to be a truck driver rather than a teacher 
or bank teller?

in determining wages in the labor market is the nature and extent of discrimination that 
is present. Economists have pinpointed two major theories for why employers might dis-
criminate: taste based discrimination and statistical discrimination.
The Nobel Prize-winning economist Gary Becker is famous in part for developing the 
market implications of taste-based discrimination, which occurs when people’s prefer-
ences cause them to discriminate against a certain group.3 For example, if an employer is 
a bigot, he might prefer not to work with certain types of people. Some wage statistics are 
consistent with American employers having a taste for discrimination. For example, among 
hourly wage workers, non-Hispanic workers make 36 percent more than Hispanic workers 
in America, on average, as shown in Exhibit 11.11.
It is important to note that wages can be different between groups not only because an 
employer has a taste for discrimination but also because of other factors, such as human 
capital—in particular, in the form of education and experience. In fact, Hispanic workers 
have lower educational attainment, on average, than non-Hispanic workers. This differ-
ence in human capital could therefore be the driver of the wage differences observed in 
Exhibit 11.11.
An interesting additional possibility is that wage differences between workers are driven 
by hard-to-observe factors. For example, perhaps non-Hispanic workers are better employ-
ees because their English skills help them to communicate more effectively with cowork-
ers and customers. Maybe differences in communication abilities alone cause some of the 
differences observed in Exhibit 11.11. Is it discrimination if employers hire on the basis of 
that perception (whether true or false)?
Economists call this type of discrimination statistical discrimination. It occurs when 
employers use an observable variable (such as race or gender) to help determine if the 
person will be a good employee. Thus, it occurs when expectations cause people to dis-
criminate against a certain group.
For instance, if you are in your teens or twenties, why do you think your car 
insurance costs more than your parents’ car insurance? It is because the insurance 
company uses statistical group averages to determine that people your age get in 
more accidents than people your parents’ age. In this way, even though the variable 
age by itself is not perfect, it provides an indication of how risky the driver will be. 
Employers perform similar calculations when deciding on which type of person to 
hire and use gender, race, age, or any other variable they believe is indicative of who 
will be a good worker.
An important distinction between taste-based and statistical discrimination is that em-
ployers are willing to forego profits when engaging in taste-based discrimination. That is, 
to cater to their prejudicial preferences, they will not hire or promote a specific type of 
worker. On the other hand, employers engaging in statistical discrimination are trying to 
Taste-based discrimination occurs 
when people’s preferences cause 
them to discriminate against a 
certain group.

enhance their profits. We return later to how we might measure the impact of discrimina-
tion in the labor market.
Changes in Wage Inequality Over Time
We have just discussed three major reasons for why wages vary across the economy: 
human capital differences, compensating wage differentials, and discrimination. One out-
standing question is how wage differences have changed over 
time. At first glance, you might think that because discrimination 
has become less socially acceptable over time—especially since 
the 1950s and 1960s—wage inequality must have decreased. You 
might be surprised, however, to see Exhibit 11.12, which plots 
the wage distribution for the United States from 1967 to 2010. It 
shows wage trends for people at the bottom, in the middle, and at 
the top of the wage distribution.
The exhibit shows that wage inequality since 1967 has increased dramatically. Whereas 
the top 10 percent of earners have increased their wages by over $50,000 per year, those at 
the bottom remained effectively flat. A similar story plays out for the median wage earner. 
This dramatic change in wage inequality over time is likely due to several sources, but 
economists have pinpointed one factor in particular that has driven a large wedge between 
high- and low-earning workers: technological change.
As we discussed earlier, technology can either be labor saving or labor complementary. 
It can also be skill saving or skill complementary, more often referred to as skill biased. 
Skill-biased technological changes increase the productivity of skilled workers relative 
to that of unskilled workers. The primary technological change over this time period has 
been advances in computing power. This change appears to have been broadly skill biased, 
improving the marginal productivity of skilled workers and causing the demand for their 
labor and pay to increase.
On the flip side, enhanced computing power has also replaced many tasks performed 
by the unskilled, thereby decreasing the labor demand for such workers and lowering their 
wages. This effect can be observed throughout the economy: many customer service ­centers 
are now automated by voice-recognizing software. In the past, trouble with a telephone bill 
would not require communication with an automaton. Likewise, cars, pizzas, and even the 
beds we sleep in are now being made by advanced technologies. Technology has ­advanced 
so far and so fast over the past few decades that perhaps before you get your first job, robots 
behind the counter at the local fast-food franchise may smile and ask, “Would you like fries 
and Coke with that hamburger?”

By following the three time series, 
we can see that while the bottom 
10 percent (blue line) and median 
(red line) wage earners have experi-
enced little to no real wage growth 
since 1967, the top 10 percent 
(green line) of earners have seen 
a 50 percent increase in wages. 
One explanation is that skill-biased 
technological change increased top 
wage earners’ marginal product.

Section 11.4   |  The Market for Other Factors of Production: Physical Capital and Land  
305
11.4
The value of marginal product 
of physical capital is the 
contribution of an additional unit of 
physical capital to a firm’s revenues.
Land includes the solid surface of 
the earth and natural resources.
Despite our focus so far on labor as an input to production, there are other factors equally 
important to the production process. In this section, we discuss the market for physical 
capital (such as machines) and the market for land.
Recall that the value to a firm of adding each consecutive unit of labor is given by mul-
tiplying the output price and the marginal product of labor. We denoted this marginal value 
as VMPL (value of marginal product of labor), and derived the optimal action of the firm to 
hire labor up until the point where the wage rate = VMPL.
A firm’s physical capital requires an identical treatment. As we discussed in Chapter 6,  
physical capital is any good, ­including machines and buildings, used for production. It may 
be the belt on an assembly line, the credit card machine at a restaurant, or the forklift at a 
construction site. Similar to hiring workers, a firm will expand its physical capital until it is 
not worthwhile to do so. This implies that just as The Wisconsin Cheeseman hired labor until  
VMPL = wage, it will employ physical capital until the value of the marginal product of 
physical capital (VMPK)—economists commonly denote physical capital with a K—equals 
the price of physical capital. The value of marginal product of physical capital is the contri-
bution of an additional unit of physical capital to a firm’s revenues.
The same is true for uses of land. Land includes the solid surface of the earth where 
structures are built and natural resources. A firm will continue to purchase and use land—say 
for building space—until the value of the marginal product of land equals the price of land.
Although the economic framework for deciding how much of the three inputs to use 
is identical, labor has one major difference from physical capital and land: both physical 
capital and land can be either rented or owned, whereas labor (of others) cannot be owned. 
When rented, the firm must pay the rental price of physical capital, and to use land it must 
pay the rental price of land. By rental price, we mean the price of using a good for a spe-
cific period of time. For simplicity, we assume that the firm rents physical capital and land 
rather than owns them; we treat investment more broadly in Chapter 15.
To make this discussion more concrete, let’s consider an example of how we can ­arrive 
at an equilibrium in the physical capital market. Suppose that a labor-saving technologi-
cal innovation makes it possible for The Wisconsin Cheeseman to use only one unit of 
labor—a computer programmer—to produce cheese boxes. Recall that the number of 
machines on the assembly line determines how many cheese boxes The Cheeseman pro-
duces. Exhibit 11.13 represents the production schedule for physical capital, where each 
unit of physical capital is one machine. Suppose that the equilibrium price of cheese 
boxes remains at $2. This means that the value of marginal product of physical capital 
(VMPK) = $2 × marginal product of capital per unit (MPK). This relationship is dis-
played in column 4 of Exhibit 11.13.
In Exhibit 11.14 we plot this schedule. If the market for machines has a rental price 
of $80 per machine, then we can see that The Cheeseman will use 10 machines in its 
assembly line, producing 524 cheese boxes per day. This is optimal because the firm has 
set VMPK = market rental rate, thereby maximizing its profits.
We can arrive at equilibrium in the land market using an identical approach. This will 
determine how much land The Cheeseman demands.
So how does The Cheeseman put all of this together and choose its optimal mix of 
labor, physical capital, and land? You will not be surprised to learn that The ­Cheeseman 
considers marginal benefits and marginal costs when making 
its choices. In this case, The Cheeseman optimizes by hiring 
inputs until their marginal cost equals their marginal benefit. 
In equilibrium, this will lead to the marginal product from the 
last dollar spent on each input being equalized (this is simi-
lar to the “equal bang for your buck” story that we learned 
about in Chapter 5 and resources being allocated efficiently in 
­Chapter 7).

Evidence-Based Economics
H
ave economists found evidence that discrimination might exist in labor markets? 
The answer is unequivocally yes—studies analyzing several different labor markets 
have made a case that discrimination against minorities and women exists. The stud-
ies are typically split between field experiments and studies that use statistical techniques 
to analyze existing (naturally occurring) data.
One intriguing example of a field experiment is a study by economists Claudia Goldin 
and Cecelia Rouse.4 They use audition notes from a series of auditions among national 
orchestras to determine whether or not blind auditions—those in which musicians audition 
behind a screen—help women relatively more than men.
The authors considered three rounds of auditions: preliminary, semifinal, and final. 
They found that for women who made it to the finals, a blind audition increased their

is that The Cheeseman’s output is de-

for any given level of output and how 
much value each additional machine 
adds. Column 1 shows cheese boxes

likelihood of winning by 33 percentage points. What this means is that women were much 
more likely to be chosen for national orchestras when the judges were not aware of their 
gender. As the authors note, without blind judging, discrimination has limited the employ-
ment of female musicians.
A related field experiment focusing on hiring practices within sales, administrative sup-
port, clerical, and customer services jobs was conducted by economists Marianne Bertrand 
and Sendhil Mullainathan.5 Following a long line of research using similar techniques, 
the authors focused on testing for discrimination against African Americans in the work-
force. They sent nearly 5,000 resumes in response to help-wanted ads in Chicago and 
Boston, randomly assigning Caucasian-sounding names, such as Emily or Greg, and 
­African-American-sounding names, such as Lakisha or Jamal, to the identical résumé. The 
outcome they were interested in was whether a given resume generated a callback or an 
e-mail for an interview.
We would expect that, without discrimination, callbacks would be distributed evenly 
between African-­American-sounding and Caucasian-sounding names. After all, each 
group had identical resumes. Yet, Bertrand and Mullainathan found that résumés with 
­Caucasian-sounding names had a 9.65  percent chance of receiving a callback, while 
­résumés with African-American-sounding names had only a 6.45 percent chance. This 
means that those with Caucasian-sounding names were about 50 percent more likely to 
receive a callback than those with African-American-sounding names.
These two studies provide evidence of discrimination against two different classes of 
individuals—women in the case of orchestra hiring and people with African-American-
sounding names in the case of the sales and clerical jobs.
One aspect that is left on the sidelines in these two studies is the relative wages of people 
once hired. Economists Kerwin Charles and Jon Guryan tackled this issue by examining a 
large data set on wages.6 They used careful statistical techniques in an attempt to account 
for differences in productivity and human capital as well as differences in compensating 
wage differentials. Their key result is that taste-based discrimination accounts for as much 
as one-fourth of the gap in wages between African Americans and Caucasians. This level 
of discrimination accounts for a total loss in annual earnings for African Americans of 
thousands of dollars. As you can see, this is real money that is being shuffled because of 
discrimination. But the good news is that the researchers found that this type of discrimina-
tion has lessened over time.
These three studies have only scratched the surface of empirical work that explores the 
issue of discrimination. Overall, there is a fair amount of evidence suggesting that there 
is discrimination in labor markets, and in some cases, it is leading to considerable differ-
ences in wages across groups of people. What remains difficult to determine is whether 
such discrimination is taste-based or statistical. Perhaps you can think of research ideas to 
determine the precise nature of discrimination?7

Chapter 11  |  Markets for Factors of Production
Summary
Producers determine the optimal mix of labor, physical capital, and land 
when making production decisions. Markets for these factors of production 
operate in much the same way that markets for final goods and services function: 
firms expand their use until marginal benefits equal marginal costs.
Determining the demand for labor centers on the concept of the value of 
marginal product of labor, which is the contribution an additional worker makes 
to the firm’s revenues.
When making decisions on how to spend our time, we face opportunity cost. 
There is a trade-off between labor, which comprises activities that earn money, 
and leisure, which is time spent on activities other than earning money. The 
opportunity cost for one hour of leisure is the income that we would have earned 
by working for that hour.
Large wage differences exist across people and jobs. The differences 
stem from three main sources: human capital differences, compensating wage 
differentials, and discrimination. 
As with labor, firms expand their use of physical capital until the value of the 
marginal product of physical capital equals the price of physical capital, and they 
likewise use land until the value of the marginal product of land equals the price 
of land.

a.	 Find the marginal product of labor for each worker.
	
b.	 Is the relationship between output and labor consis-
tent with the Law of Diminishing Returns?
	
c.	 Suppose your firm is a perfect competitor in the out-
put market and the labor market. If the price of output 
is $5 and the wage rate is $22, how many workers 
should your firm hire?
	
d.	 If the price of output falls to $3 and the wage remains 
$22, how many workers should your firm hire?
	 2.	 For Acme Manufacturing, the marginal product of labor 
is MP = 160 − 3L. Acme is a perfect competitor and sells 
its output at a price of $20 per unit. It also pays a wage of 
$200 per worker. How many workers should Acme em-
ploy to maximize its profits?
	 3.	 Equal pay for work of comparable worth is the idea that 
certain jobs, though completely different, must have 
the same pay because they are deemed to be of similar 
value. For example, an X-ray technician’s job may be 
deemed to be as valuable as a dental assistant’s job and 
therefore, both these jobs should be paid the same sala-
ries. Implementing equal pay for comparable worth has 
been suggested as a measure that would reduce discrimi-
nation and inequality in the job market. Do you agree? 
What could be the other possible effects of such a policy?

work at Apple stores are paid very low wages, given their 
productivity. Dividing Apple’s revenues by the total num-
ber of employees shows that each employee contributed 
an average of $473,000 in revenues in 2011. But most of 
Apple’s sales staff are paid about $25,000 a year. What is 
the flaw, if any, in your friend’s reasoning?

two strategies. Under the first, you would raise the wage 
for all hours worked from $20 per hour to $22 per hour; 
under the second, you would leave the wage for the first 
40 hours per week at $20 but offer $30 per hour for hours 
worked above 40 hours (that is, you would offer time-
and-a-half for overtime). Both strategies have the same 
cost of $1,100 if a worker chooses to work 50 hours. 
Which strategy is more likely to lead your employees to 
agree to a 50-hour work week?

veloping countries is that the wages workers are being paid 
are too low. Commentators often use dollar comparisons to 
show that, compared to U.S. standards, “sweatshop” work-
ers are paid unfairly low wages. Use what you have read 
about the supply of labor to examine this argument.

requires all employers with at least 50 full-time equiva-

employees or pay a fine of up to $2,000 per employee 
(see http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/index.html for 
a description of the ACA). Some people have argued that 
ACA will lower employment. This problem looks at an 
important issue in this debate.
	
a.	 Suppose the government passes a law that requires 
firms to offer health insurance to their workers. The 
cost of the insurance is equal to $1 for each hour an 
employee works. How will this law affect firms’ de-
mand for labor?
	
b.	 Suppose workers consider a dollar of health insurance 
paid by firms to be the equivalent of $1 in wages. How 
will this law affect the supply curve of labor?
	
c.	 Consider an industry where the equilibrium wage is 
$15 per hour and 100 workers are employed. How 
will this law affect the equilibrium quantity of labor in 
this labor market? How will it affect the equilibrium 
wage in this industry?
	
d.	 Now suppose workers consider a dollar of health 
insurance paid by firms to be worth less than $1 in 
wages. How will this law affect the equilibrium quan-
tity of labor in this labor market? How will it ­affect 
the equilibrium wage in this industry?

zens generous unemployment benefits and other welfare 
payments. While the unemployment rate in Denmark is 
relatively low, the proportion of people who are not in the 
labor force is quite high. After accounting for factors like 
the average age of the population, what else do you think 
could explain this?
	10.	 In 2010, President Obama said that technological progress 
kills jobs. Recall that labor-saving technology substitutes 
for existing labor inputs and reduces the marginal prod-
uct of labor. Taking the example of an ATM (Automatic 
Teller Machine), Obama said that the fact that ATMs have 
replaced tellers pointed to a structural problem in the econ-
omy. Is labor-saving technology necessarily a bad thing?

­surgical equipment. You have a production plant in 
­Alabama where you employ highly skilled labor. Your 
firm is considering moving its production facilities from 
Alabama to Guangzhou in China in an attempt to lower 
labor costs. When you compare wages in China and in the 
United States, you notice that the average wage in China is 
significantly lower than the average American wage. What 
factors other than wages should you consider when you de-
cide whether or not to move production to China? Explain.
	12.	 According to a 2011 study by the American Association 
of University Women (AAUW), about 40 percent of 
full-time faculty nationwide in 2005 were women, yet 
they made up only 22 percent of faculty in computer 
and information sciences, 19 percent of mathemat-
ics faculty, and 12 percent of engineering faculty (the 
STEM fields). In 2005, the then president of Harvard 
University, Lawrence Summers, suggested that differ-
ences in math and science aptitude could explain part of 
this pattern. What reasons other than differences in apti-
tude could explain why women are underrepresented in 
the these fields?

Can a monopoly ever 
be good for 
society?
Neuroscientists have taught us that the mere 
mention of the word monopoly conjures up 
negative associations deep in the brain that only 
words such as death and murder can match. In this 
chapter, we explore why that is the case, focusing 
on the economics of monopolies. Throughout the 
chapter we follow Schering-Plough Corporation, 
a global pharmaceutical company based in the 
United States, which introduced the allergy drug 
Claritin in the early 1980s. During the development 
process, the U.S. government deemed the drug to be truly original and granted 
Schering-Plough a patent, which gave the company the exclusive right to 
manufacture and sell Claritin for 20 years.
Put yourself into the shoes of the CEO of Schering-Plough at that point in 
time. If you were CEO, how would you take advantage of this product exclusivity 
to optimize profits from your new wonder drug?
Your intuition might suggest that delivering enormous profits will be easy. With 
so many people in need of allergy medicine and no competitors to worry about,

you are a monopolist and therefore should set very high prices for ­Claritin, cap-
turing as much consumer surplus from buyers as possible. Knowing that some 
people might really need Claritin to function from day to day, you might even 
consider charging as much as $100 or more per tablet!
In this chapter, you will learn about the monopolist’s problem—how it is 
similar to and different from the competitive seller’s problem we discussed in 
Chapter 6. The lesson of this chapter is that a company with market power be-
haves quite differently from the way that a competitive firm behaves. Compared 
to competitive firms, monopolists produce less and charge more. They thus 
make themselves better off, with the potential of earning economic profits in 
both the short run and the long run. But their gain will come at the cost of mak-
ing consumers worse off and decreasing social surplus.
All of this has led the public to be quite distrustful of monopolies. For this 
reason, as we shall see, governments actively monitor and regulate monopolies. 
However, can a monopoly ever be good for society? We’ll attempt to answer 
that question by the end of the chapter.
KEY IDEAS
Monopoly represents an extreme market structure with a single seller.
Monopolies arise both naturally and through government protection.
Monopolists are price-makers and produce at the point where marginal 
revenue equals marginal cost.
The monopolist maximizes profits by producing a lower quantity and 
charging a higher price than perfectly competitive sellers. By doing so, 
deadweight loss results.
Efficiency can be established in a monopoly through first-degree price 
discrimination or government intervention.
Thus far we have assumed that sellers operate in competitive markets: identical goods are 
produced by many different sellers and sold at the market-determined price. The firm is 
simply a passive price-taker, and the invisible hand directs the self-interested pursuits of 
buyers and sellers to yield socially efficient outcomes. Exhibit 12.1 provides an aerial view 
of perfect competition, which we studied in Chapters 6 and 7, and the new market structure 
that we will be studying in this section—monopoly.
Studying perfectly competitive markets provided important insights into how agents in-
teract in markets and how markets equilibrate. But it proves to be a special type of ­market. 
A more common market situation is one in which a firm is not simply a price-taker, but 
a price-maker—a seller that sets the price of a good. It has the ability to set the price of

the good because it has market power. Column 2 in Exhibit 12.1 summarizes the most 
extreme form of market power: a monopoly.
A monopoly is an industry structure in which only one seller provides a good or service 
that has no close substitutes. In this way, a monopolist is not concerned with the behavior 
of other sellers. The price chosen by the monopolist is the one that makes the company the 
highest profit.
Market power relates to the ability 
of sellers to affect prices.
Monopoly is an industry structure 
in which only one seller provides a 
good or service that has no close 
substitutes.
What does it mean to have market power? Where do we have to look to see firms thrive 
with limited competition? Perhaps it is a titan of social media like Facebook. Maybe it is an 
innovative company like Google. In fact, for the monopolist, market power arises because 
of barriers to entry.
Barriers to entry are obstacles that prevent potential competitors from entering the 
market. As such, they provide the seller protection against competition. Barriers to entry 
range from complete exclusion of market entrants to prevention of a new firm from enter-
ing and competing on an equal footing with an incumbent firm.
There are two types of market power that arise from barriers to entry: legal market 
power and natural market power. We now take a look at these two types in more depth.
Legal Market Power
Legal market power occurs when a firm obtains market power through barriers to entry 
created not by the firm itself, but by the government. These barriers can take the form of 
patents and copyrights that are issued to innovative companies. With a patent, the govern-
ment grants an individual or company the sole right to produce and sell a good or service. 
For example, when Schering-Plough applied to the government for a patent to produce 
and sell Claritin, the government granted the company the exclusive right to manufacture 
and sell the drug for 20 years. With a copyright, the government grants an individual or 
company an exclusive right to intellectual property. For example, when Malcolm Gladwell 
wrote the best-selling book Blink, he copyrighted the work.1 This meant that he was given a 
government guarantee that no one else could print and sell the book without his permission. 
In effect, Gladwell was granted monopoly rights in the sale of his book. Copyright protec-
tion is different across countries and in many cases extends long after the author’s death. 
For example, in the United States, it extends decades after the author’s death.

Barriers to entry provide a seller 
with protection from potential 
competitors entering the market.
Legal market power occurs when a 
firm obtains market power through 
barriers to entry created not by the 
firm itself, but by the government.
A patent is the privilege granted 
to an individual or company by the 
government, which gives him or her 
the sole right to produce and sell a 
good.
A copyright is an exclusive right 
granted by the government to the 
creator of a literary or artistic work.

Such exclusivity laws represent a significant benefit 
for the innovator-turned-monopolist. For instance, mo-
nopolists Schering-Plough Corporation and Gladwell can 
charge higher prices than would occur under perfect com-
petition. As consumers, we are all worse off because we 
must pay higher prices for these goods, but there are a few 
silver linings. First, patents and copyrights are only tem-
porary, and eventually the protected goods enter the public 
domain, and at that point other producers are able to dis-
tribute them. Second, blockbuster drugs and best-selling 
books are difficult and costly to produce, and without the 
increased incentive for creative activity, the expensive in-
vestment to create new prescription drugs or best-selling 
books might never be made. We return to a discussion of 
whether patents are indeed helpful in stimulating innova-
tion in the Evidence-Based Economics section at the end 
of this chapter.
Natural Market Power
A second common source of barriers to entry occurs natu-
rally rather than by design. ­Natural market power occurs 
when a firm obtains market power through barriers to entry created by the firm ­itself. 
Within this category, there are two main sources of monopoly power:
	
1.	 The monopolist owns or controls a key resource necessary for production.
	
2.	 There are economies of scale in production over the relevant range of output.
The 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) represent 
a choice made by the U.S. government to impose strict 
rules on new factories regarding their emissions of pol-
lution. The amendments mandated that if a new firm 
wanted to build a plant in an area where there was al-
ready a lot of air pollution, the firm must invest in ex-
pensive scrubbers and other environmental technologies 
before commencing production.
Many industry executives applauded the new pollution 
laws. They were happy because the rules did not apply 
to the already established plants; they were “grand­
fathered” under the older, less stringent rules. Thus, ex-
isting plants had much lighter requirements as to how 
much pollution reduction they needed to take on.
We’ve already learned that many choices yield im-
portant market consequences. One unintended con-
sequence (or was it?) of this kind of regulation was 
that by raising entry costs for new firms, a barrier to 
entry was created that expanded the market power 
of existing firms. In some cases, the CAAA impact 
on market power was ultimately so large that it out-
weighed the direct costs these firms had to pay to 
reduce pollution!
Accordingly, firm profits actually increased even as these 
firms cleaned up the environment. The downside fell on 
the consumers, of course, because prices rose substantially.
The next time you hear a company arguing for tighter 
environmental standards that clearly raise industry costs, 
before praising the CEO for his “greenness,” be sure to 
ask yourself whether such standards might make his firm 
better off.

12.2
Control of Key Resources
Key resources are those materials that are essential for the production of a good or 
service. The most basic way for a firm to develop market power naturally is to control 
the entire supply of such resources (assuming that there are no close substitutes). For 
example, if renters are willing to pay a premium for an apartment with a lake view and 
there is only one apartment complex on the lake, the owner of that apartment complex has 
considerable market power. Likewise, by controlling 80 percent of the production from 
the world’s diamond mines, the South African diamond company De Beers famously 
exercised significant market power in the diamond market throughout the twentieth cen-
tury. In a similar spirit, Alcoa controls a key manufacturing resource with its ownership 
of bauxite (aluminum ore) mines.
Another key resource is individual expertise. For example, Sergey Brin and Larry Page 
are exceptional at search engine design. Thus, Google’s power arose from two of its per-
sonnel, whose key economic resource is their creative talents.
In much the same way, Web sites that we use daily, such as eBay, Facebook, and Twitter, 
control a key resource: they attract the largest numbers of consumers. Their value subse-
quently increases because of network externalities. Network externalities occur when a 
product’s value increases as more consumers begin to use it. Because eBay has the largest 
number of buyers and sellers, it makes sense for sellers to part with their goods on eBay. 
Similarly, Facebook and Twitter today are synonymous with social networking. Because 
each now has millions of users, they own a key resource: millions of people log in daily. 
Accordingly, Facebook is now much more valuable than MySpace because it has more 
people using it—a fact that attracts even more customers. In this way, network externalities 
set off a profitable cycle for Facebook.
Economies of Scale
Monopolies also form because it is practical for both producers and consumers. Consider 
the case of the transmission of electricity. If your town had multiple providers of electric-
ity transmission, there would have to be multiple sets of wires laid throughout town and 
extraordinary start-up costs would be borne by multiple providers of electricity (and even-
tually passed on to you, the consumer).
In this case, it is better to have one provider serve the entire town because of the 
economies of scale that the single provider enjoys. As we discussed in Chapter 6, econo-
mies of scale occur when the average total cost per unit of output decreases as total 
output increases. As your electricity provider increases its transmission, the average 
total cost per unit of output decreases. The intuition is that if your electricity provider 
wants to hook up and create electricity for a new subdivision, the initial fixed costs will 
be high, but as more and more houses are added, costs will be spread over more house-
holds. ­Exhibit 12.2 shows just such a relationship between average total cost, marginal 
cost, and output. You will note that in this case we have assumed a constant marginal 
cost. This means that over the entire production range of interest, the marginal cost is 
Exhibit 12.2 Average Total 
Cost and Marginal Cost for 
a Natural Monopoly
Natural monopolies are 
characterized by substantial 
fixed costs and economies 
of scale. To see this, at a 
low quantity level the aver-
age total cost (ATC) is very 
high, and as quantity in-
creases the ATC decreases, 
approaching marginal cost.

the same. In previous chapters we have dealt with upward-sloping marginal cost curves, 
but in certain cases a constant marginal cost curve represents a good description of the 
cost structure of a firm.
For goods and services that have economies of scale over the relevant range of output, 
it is efficient for a single firm to serve the entire market because it can do so at a lower 
cost than any larger number of firms could. We denote such cases as natural monopolies, 
because they arise naturally. A natural monopoly arises because the economies of scale 
of a single firm make it efficient to have only one provider of a good or service. Often such 
firms are the first suppliers in a given market, and the cost advantages they achieve through 
producing a large number of goods preclude would-be competitors from entering the mar-
ket. Examples of natural monopolies include providers of clean drinking water, natural gas, 
and electricity.
You may wonder why Facebook, Twitter, and eBay are not considered natural monopo-
lies. All three exhibit network externalities, and such network effects seem to present bar-
riers to entry, don’t they? So why aren’t these companies considered natural monopolies? 
Remember that natural monopolies arise because of economies of scale—the firm’s ATC 
curve decreases over the important range of output. But network externalities arise from 
consumer benefits and have nothing to do with costs and economies of scale. There are 
some goods that feature both economies of scale and network effects, such as operating 
system software and telephone networks.
In contrast to monopolies that arise through legal means, natural monopolies emerge 
when unique cost conditions characterize their industry. Because of these cost conditions, 
natural monopolists worry less about potential market entrants than monopolies that arise 
through legal means. As large economic profits attract entrants like bees to honey in legal 
monopolies such as the pharmaceutical, diamond, and Internet industries, the economic 
profits in the natural monopoly scenario are not as attractive. This is because potential 
entrants realize that they cannot achieve the low costs of the natural monopolist because 
upon entry they likely will “split the market.” Such splitting of the market will render much 
higher costs and lower profits to each seller.
This doesn’t mean that industries that are currently monopolized will never evolve to 
be more competitive. There have been many cases where the market grew sufficiently 
large so that the natural monopoly evolved into a multiseller market. Throughout the 
1990s and early 2000s, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (IE) was the default browser for 
just about all Web traffic. Estimates put IE’s market share at well over 95 percent 
at its peak. But as the number of households connected to the Internet boomed, new 
companies entered the market. Even though there are significant economies of scale to 
developing, coding, testing, and marketing a new browser, the increase in demand has 
generated opportunities for Mozilla Firefox and Google’s Chrome, with IE’s market-
share dropping to below 70 percent.
Regardless of why a firm enjoys market power—whether legally or naturally—it faces 
exactly the same decision problem when it comes to production and pricing choices. We 
turn to that discussion now.
A natural monopoly is a market in 
which one firm can provide a good 
or service at a lower cost than two 
or more firms.
The monopolist’s problem shares two important similarities with the perfectly competitive 
seller’s problem we discussed in Chapter 6. First, the monopolist must understand how 
inputs combine to make outputs. Second, the monopolist must know the costs of produc-
tion. Accordingly, all of the production and cost concepts we learned earlier apply directly 
to the monopolist’s problem.
We do, however, find one important difference between the perfectly competitive 
­seller’s decision problem and the monopolist’s decision problem. Recall from Chapter 6 
that to maximize profits the perfectly competitive firm expands production until marginal  
cost (MC ) equals price (P ), where price is determined by the intersection of the market 
­demand and market supply curves.
Chapter 6 also showed that marginal revenue equals price for a perfectly competitive 
firm because the firm faces a perfectly elastic demand curve (a horizontal demand curve),

as shown in panel (a) of Exhibit 12.3 At the market price, the perfectly competitive firm 
can sell as many units as it wishes. But if it charges a bit more, it will lose all of its business 
because consumers can buy an identical good from another seller who is ready to sell at a 
lower price. Also, if it charges a bit less, it sells the same number of units but does not raise 
as much revenue, so that would not be profit optimizing. As such, a firm facing a perfectly 
elastic demand curve is a price-taker.
This situation represents the major difference between the 
perfectly competitive firm’s decision problem and the monopo-
list’s decision problem. Because the monopolist is the sole market 
supplier, it faces the market demand curve, which is downward-
sloping, as in panel (b) of Exhibit 12.3. Unlike the perfectly com-
petitive firm, the monopolist can increase price and not lose all of 
its business. In fact, the market demand curve tells us exactly the 
trade-off the monopolist faces when it changes its price.
Consider panel (b) of Exhibit 12.3 more carefully. If the monopolist chooses a price of 
$100, it can sell 1,000 units. If the price is increased to $200, then the monopolist can sell 
only 400 units. Of course, the monopolist prefers to sell a lot of units for a high price—say, 
1,000 units at a price of $200. But the downward-sloping market demand curve that mo-
nopolies face makes this outcome impossible. A monopoly is powerful, but it cannot sell at 
a point above the market demand curve. This raises an important consideration: how does 
a monopolist’s total revenue change when it raises or lowers price?
Revenue Curves
To illustrate how total revenue changes with price changes, let’s consider the task fac-
ing you as the CEO of Schering-Plough Corporation. Your company is ready to go to 
the market with Claritin, and you want to figure out how you can make the most money 
possible from the drug. Even though there might be other medicines for allergies, we 
will assume that the conceptual model of monopoly applies because there are no close 
substitutes for Claritin.
A first step in this process is to understand how much money you will bring in at 
various price levels—for now, we assume that you have to charge each customer the 
same price. Recall that the total revenue of a firm is the amount of money it brings in 
from the sale of its outputs. Marginal revenue is the change in total revenue associated 
Unlike the perfectly competitive 
firm, the monopoly can increase 
price and not lose all of its business.
Exhibit 12.3 Perfectly Competitive Firms and Monopolies Face Different  
Demand Curves
Panel (a) shows one of the key results from Chapter 6—that in a perfectly 
competitive market, the demand curve facing the firm is perfectly elastic. The 
demand curve faced by the monopolist in panel (b) is the entire market and is 
therefore downward-sloping. Thus, if the monopolist charges $100, it can sell 
1,000 units; and if it increases the price to $200, it sells only 400 units.

with producing and selling one more unit of output. How do we begin determining total 
and marginal revenue?
The key is to understand the market demand curve for Claritin. After a thorough mar-
ket analysis, you determine that a reasonable estimate of the market demand curve is that 
shown in Exhibit 12.4. The exhibit tells you, for example, that at a price of $5 per pill, you 
can sell 200 million units of Claritin; and at a price of $3, you can sell 600 million units. 
This graphical representation reveals the important trade-off between price and quantity 
sold that the monopolist faces: a higher price yields more revenue per unit sold, but fewer 
number of units sold.
From this demand curve, you can calculate the total revenue and marginal revenue at 
each price level, as shown in columns 3 and 4 of Exhibit 12.5. The exhibit also includes 
fixed costs and marginal costs, which you studied in Chapter 6. You might notice that the 
fixed costs are relatively large and that the marginal cost is constant over the various output 
levels. High fixed costs are typical for industries that spend large amounts of money on re-
searching and developing products, such as pharmaceutical companies. In such instances, 
it is not uncommon for marginal cost to be constant over large ranges of output because 
mass production of the product leads each additional unit of production to have a constant 
additional cost per unit.
Exhibit 12.4 The Market 
Demand Curve for Claritin
With patent protection from 
the government, the demand 
curve that Schering-Plough faces 
for its sales of Claritin is the 
entire market. For example, if 
­Schering-Plough chose a price of 
$4, then it would be able to sell 
400 million units, but the demand 
curve shows that if it chose a 
price of $6 or higher, it wouldn’t 
sell any Claritin, despite having a 
monopoly.

Another important feature that the numbers in Exhibit 12.5 reveal is the relationship be-
tween price and total revenue. Let’s consider an example. Assume that you lower the price 
from $5 to $4. In this case, Exhibit 12.5 reveals that you bring in $600 million more in total 
revenues. This additional $600 million arises from two effects.
First, is a quantity effect: the lower price allows you to sell 200 million more units 
of Claritin. The increase in revenues because of this increased number of sales is shown 
as the green-shaded region in Exhibit 12.6. Computing the area of the green-shaded 
region (base times height) yields an increase in revenues of $800 million (200 million 
multiplied by $4).
But there is a flip side. Those people who were buying at the old price of $5 now only 
have to pay $4. This loss in revenues is known as the price effect; it is shaded pink in 
Exhibit 12.6. Calculating the area of the pink rectangle, we find that the price effect is 
equal to $200 million (200 million multiplied by $1). In sum, therefore, the increase in 
total revenues from the price change is $800 million − $200 million = $600 million. In 
this case, the price effect is smaller than the quantity effect. As we learned in Chapter 5, 
this means that demand is elastic over this range of the demand curve.
These observations reveal a more general pattern at work. With price decreases—
moving down the demand curve—when the quantity effect dominates the price effect, 
then total revenue increases. If the price effect dominates the quantity effect, then total 
revenue falls. Alternatively, if one considers price increases—moving up the demand 
curve—the nature of these relationships reverses. That is, with price increases, if the 
quantity effect dominates the price effect, then total revenue decreases. If the price effect 
dominates the quantity effect, then total revenue increases. The following table summa-
rizes these effects.

Price, Marginal Revenue, and Total Revenue
We are now in a position to put this intuition into action. To do so, we begin by plotting 
the entire relationship among price, marginal revenue, and total revenue in Exhibit 12.7. 
Panel (a) uses the information from Exhibit 12.5 to graph the demand curve and the mar-
ginal revenue curve for Claritin. The curves begin at the same point on the price axis 
because the price of Claritin is the marginal revenue from selling the first unit of Claritin. 
Thereafter, marginal revenue lies below the demand curve, and as quantity expands the 
Exhibit 12.6 The Quantity Effect and the 
Price Effect on Revenues for Claritin
If Schering-Plough set a price of $5 per pill, 
then it would sell 200 million Claritin pills annu-
ally. If it lowered its price to $4 per pill, there 
would be two effects to total revenue. First, 
the lower price would lead to more sales (from 
200 million to 400 million) and more revenue; 
this quantity effect is captured by the green 
box. Second, the lower price would lead to  
lost revenues from the original consumers: the 
200 million consumers who were buying at 
$5 per pill are now paying only $4 per pill. This 
lost revenue from these consumers is called the 
price effect and is captured by the pink box.

Exhibit 12.7 Relationship Among Price, 
Marginal Revenue, and Total Revenue
Panel (a) combines the demand curve for 
Claritin from Exhibit 12.4 with the mar-
ginal revenue curve faced by Schering-
Plough. The marginal revenue curve 
shows the additional revenue generated 
for Schering-Plough at each quantity 
level. When marginal revenue crosses 
the quantity axis (at 600 million), total 
revenue decreases with further sales (see 
panel (b)). This means that total revenue 
is maximized when the marginal revenue 
curve crosses the x-axis.

difference between the demand curve and the marginal revenue curve grows larger. This 
is because for the monopoly to increase its sales, it must lower the price on all goods sold.
In this example, we find that the marginal revenue curve is twice as steep as the demand 
curve, causing it to reach the quantity axis at 600 million units, whereas the demand curve 
reaches it at 1.2 billion units. In fact, this will be the case for every linear demand curve 
because the slope of the marginal revenue curve is twice as large (in absolute value) as 
the slope of the demand curve.
A second important aspect that Exhibit 12.7 reveals is the relationship between mar-
ginal revenue and total revenue. Panel (b) shows the total revenue curve for Claritin, which 
is hill-shaped. Exhibit 12.7 shows that when total revenue is rising, marginal revenue is 
positive. This makes sense because if total revenue is increasing, marginal revenue must 
be positive. Alternatively, when total revenue is falling, marginal revenue is negative. For 
this reason, total revenue is at its maximum when the marginal revenue curve crosses the 
x-axis (quantity axis)—that is the point where an additional unit of output causes marginal 
revenue to equal zero.
To perform your job of choosing the optimal price to maximize profits, you can now 
begin to see how you can eliminate some price levels from consideration. For example, 
would you ever choose a price of $1.50? No, because at this price, the marginal revenue 
from the last unit sold is negative, −$3 (see Exhibit 12.5). In other words, you are decreas-
ing total revenues by selling that last unit! From this reasoning, you can see that you would 
never price below $3, which is the price at which marginal revenue turns negative. To do so 
would only lower revenues and increase costs.

Exhibit 12.8 Marginal Revenue 
and Marginal Cost for Claritin
If Schering-Plough produces at QL, 
then the 300 millionth pill will earn 
$3 in additional revenue (marginal 
revenue) and cost $1 to produce. 
At this point Schering-Plough 
should expand production. Why? It 
will earn more profits! By the same 
logic, consider QH, where Schering-
Plough is producing so many units 
that the marginal cost exceeds the 
marginal revenue. The last unit of 
production costs more to produce 
than it generate in revenue.

We learned in Chapter 6 that a perfectly competitive firm must consider both marginal cost 
and marginal revenue when making its production decision. A monopolist is no different. 
Thus, to help in your Claritin pricing decision, columns 5–8 in Exhibit 12.5 include pro-
duction cost information alongside Claritin revenue information.
Producing the Optimal Quantity
Let’s begin by looking just at marginal revenue and marginal cost, as depicted in 
­Exhibit  12.8. Assume that you choose to produce at quantity level QL which is 
300 ­million. At this level of production, MR > MC, specifically, $3 > $1. Thus, if you 
produce one more unit of Claritin, your additional revenue exceeds the additional cost 
of making the allergy pill. So you should definitely produce one more pill at QL because 
your profits will be enhanced by doing so. With this same reasoning, you can see that 
you should continue to expand production provided that MR > MC. You stop increas-
ing production when you reach the point of MR = MC, or at 500 million units. Similar 
logic can be applied if you initially begin producing at QH in Exhibit 12.8. Because 
MC > MR at this point, the last unit costs more to produce than the additional revenue 
it brought in, serving to lower profits. You can do better by decreasing production to 
the point of MR = MC.
This reasoning shows that your profit-maximizing level of output produced is given 
by the intersection of the MR and MC curves. As we learned in Chapter 6, this rule is 
identical for sellers in a perfectly competitive industry, who produce at the point of MC = 
MR = P. There is one important difference, though: whereas firms in a perfectly competi-
tive industry are price-takers, monopolists are price-makers—they set the price for their 
goods or services because there are no competitors. In this sense, after you determine how 
much to produce, you as a monopolist need to determine where to set Claritin’s price.
Setting the Optimal Price
Now that you have figured out the optimal quantity, how do you start to think about where 
to set the price for Claritin? Your intuition tells you that if millions of people desperately 
want Claritin, you should set a very high price, whereas if only a few thousand people are 
vaguely interested in Claritin, you should set a low price. This intuition is spot-on in that

your pricing decision is, in fact, critically linked to the nature of the 
market demand curve.
In Exhibit 12.9, we graph the demand curve, the MR curve, and the 
MC curve. Once we have found the quantity level where MR = MC, 
your job as the monopolist is to choose the highest possible price that 
permits you to sell the entire quantity that you have produced. Graphi-
cally, you can find this price by using the demand curve.
As shown by the vertical arrow in Exhibit 12.9, you determine 
Claritin’s price by looking at the demand curve to see what price 
consumers are willing to pay for the quantity you put on the market. 
­Following the arrows in Exhibit 12.9, you see that you ­maximize 
your firm’s profits by setting a price of $3.50 because this is the 
highest price that you can charge and still sell the 500 million pills 
that you have produced (if you search the Web, you might find that 
­Internet prices for a Claritin pill are ­currently around $0.50 per pill; 
for ­illustrative purposes, we chose our equilibrium price to be in the range of observed 
prices over the lifetime of the Claritin patent).
The following simple flow chart provides the steps to the ­production and pricing deci-
sions facing the monopolist:
One way for you to ease the pain of allergy season is 
to purchase allergy drugs, such as Claritin.

Schering-Plough expands

To determine the price that 
maximizes profits, it goes di-
rectly upward to the demand 
curve and over to the y-axis 
(the price axis) to determine 
the profit-maximizing price. 
In this case, a price of $3.50 is 
the profit-maximizing price for 
Schering-Plough.

You will likely note that this approach is quite similar to the decision making of our per-
fectly competitive firm in Chapter 6, but with one major difference: price is set at a level 
higher than marginal cost for a monopolist, whereas price is equal to marginal cost for a 
perfectly competitive firm.
In sum, the optimal pricing decision rules are as follows:
Monopolist: Set P > MR = MC;     Perfectly competitive firm: P = MR = MC.
Note that the marginal decision making concerning the level of 
production is identical across these two market structures: expand 
production until MC = MR. The major difference arises from the 
fact that the firm in a competitive industry does not set its price (the 
market does), whereas the monopolist sets price based on the market 
demand curve. By inspection of Exhibit 12.9, we can see that the 
monopolist sets a price that is on the elastic portion of the demand 
curve (recall from Chapter 5 that the top half of a linear demand 
curve is elastic).
Price is set at a level higher than 
marginal costs for a monopolist, 
whereas price is equal to marginal 
cost for a perfectly competitive firm.

How a Monopolist Calculates Profits
How much will your company earn in economic profits from Claritin if you follow this op-
timal decision rule? Computing economic profits for a monopoly works exactly the same 
as computing economic profits for a perfectly competitive firm:
Profits = Total revenue − Total cost = (P × Q) − (ATC × Q) = (P − ATC) × Q.
Taking the numbers from Exhibit 12.5, we can compute monopoly profits in equilibrium. 
Exhibit 12.10 graphically depicts the total profits with the green-shaded area. To summa-
rize how we obtain this green-shaded area, we begin by finding the point where MC = MR. 
This gives us the profit-maximizing output of 500 million units. Moving upward from this 
point to the demand curve, we find the profit-maximizing price of $3.50. At that quantity, 
subtracting the average total cost of $1.02 from the $3.50 price gives us $2.48 of profits 
per unit sold. We then multiply this number by 500 million units to obtain total economic 
profits of $1.24 billion or
$1,240,000,000 = Total revenue − Total cost = ($3.50 − $1.02) × 500,000,000.
As we discussed earlier, in perfectly competitive markets entry causes long-run eco-
nomic profits to be zero. With a monopoly, economic profits remain. This is because there 
is no threat of entry from competitors because of barriers to entry. Therefore, there are no 
new entrants to increase supply and push price down to eliminate economic profits.
Does a Monopoly Have a Supply Curve?
At this point, you may have found it curious that there has been no mention of monopoly 
supply curves. After all, Exhibit 12.9 shows the price and quantity combination at which 
a monopolistic firm will produce by using only the marginal revenue, marginal cost, and 
demand curves. No supply curve! The reason is simple: monopolists, unlike sellers in com-
petitive markets, do not have a supply curve.
To understand why this is the case, first consider what the supply curve of a competi-
tive market represents. To create a supply curve under perfect competition, it is neces-
sary for firms to be price-takers, whose production is based on the given market price. 
Under this assumption, we simply determine the quantity at which the marginal cost 
of producing the last unit of a good is equal to the market price. Thus, in a competitive 
market, a supply curve shows all of the price and quantity combinations at which firms 
will produce.
Monopolists, as price-makers, do not vary their production based on market price be-
cause they set the price; it makes no sense to ask how much of a good a monopolist will 
produce at a given price. Like sellers in competitive markets, monopolists will produce at 
Exhibit 12.10 Computing 
Profits for a Monopolist
Similar to the perfectly 
­competitive firm, Schering-
Plough computes profits as 
quantity times the difference 
between price and ATC 
­[profits = quantity × (P − ATC)]. 
In this case, the green rectangle 
shows profits, which equals 
the difference between the 
price of each pill ($3.50) and 
the ATC ($1.02), multiplied by 
500 million.

the point where their marginal revenue is equal to their marginal cost. But as you have just 
learned, marginal revenue is dependent upon the negatively sloped demand curve that the 
monopolist faces. Because a monopolist’s production decision is based on demand, it can-
not be depicted as an independent supply curve.
In Chapter 7, we learned that the invisible hand creates harmony between individual and 
social interests. Such synchronization has the very attractive feature that social surplus 
is maximized in the competitive equilibrium. The power of the invisible hand is such 
that even in markets composed of only self-interested people, 
the overall well-being of society is maximized. One important 
factor that can “break” the powerful result of the invisible hand 
is market power. A firm that exercises market power causes a 
reallocation of resources toward itself, thereby sacrificing social 
surplus.
One way to think about this is to consider the market for 
­Claritin before and after Schering-Plough’s patent expired. In 
1981, Schering-Plough was awarded a monopoly, in the form of 
a patent, on Claritin. Twenty years later, Schering-Plough’s mo-
nopoly rights expired, and generic prescription drug companies could suddenly enter the 
market and sell close substitutes, such as Allegra.2 This entry process drastically changed 
the market for Claritin in a number of ways.
Panel (a) of Exhibit 12.11 shows the long-run equilibrium of the market after entry 
by competitive firms when Claritin’s patent expired. Firms have a constant marginal cost 
curve, so ATC = MC. You might wonder about fixed costs. Recall that since we are in the 
long run there are no fixed costs.

large piece that is a deadweight loss (DWL).

The equilibrium price is now dramatically lower—just $1 per pill. This lower price 
prompts a boom in quantity demanded, all the way to 1 billion pills. Consumer surplus 
in this perfectly competitive market is depicted by the blue area below the demand curve 
and above the marginal cost curve. In equilibrium, consumer surplus is $2.5 billion (½ × 
1 billion × $5).
To compare outcomes across markets, panel (b) of Exhibit 12.11 presents surplus out-
comes before Claritin’s patent expired. When Schering-Plough’s patent was still in effect, 
consumer surplus was dramatically smaller: $625 million (½ × 500 million × $2.50). 
Schering-Plough’s monopoly power allowed it to capture surplus from consumers. This 
captured surplus is represented by the pink-shaded box labeled PS.
Schering-Plough’s monopolistic pricing didn’t just capture surplus from consumers, 
however. Importantly, social surplus is smaller when Schering-Plough exercises monopoly 
power. This cost to society is deadweight loss and is represented as the yellow triangle 
labeled DWL in panel (b). This is surplus that would exist in the competitive equilibrium 
but is lost when Schering-Plough is a monopolist. The deadweight loss from Claritin’s 
monopolistic pricing is $625 million (½ × 500 million × $2.50).
Does this mean that patents are counterproductive? Not necessarily. Remember that 
because fixed costs were so high to develop Claritin, the government had to create an in-
centive to induce companies to spend money on research and development. The incentive 
that is used with pharmaceutical companies is a temporary patent, and the cost to society of 
this incentive is the deadweight loss from monopoly while the patent is held. Overall, was 
the bargain worth it? We’ll explore that question in more depth below.
Beyond waiting until the Claritin patent expires, are there any other means to restore ef-
ficiency in this market? The answer is yes. To illustrate, consider Exhibit 12.12 and its 
accompanying table, which provides a glimpse of five buyers in the market for Claritin. In 
this example, Augie is willing to pay $5 per pill, Gary $4, Joyce $3, Dawn $2, and Sandi 
$1.50. At the monopolist’s price of $3.50, only Augie and Gary buy Claritin, even though 
Joyce, Dawn, and Sandi all have willingness to pay values above marginal cost.
One way to restore social efficiency (that is, maximize social surplus) is to have a so-
cial planner choose the monopolist’s quantity and price. This “all-knowing” social planner

would need to know both the monopolist’s marginal cost and the buyer’s willingness to pay 
for the Claritin pill. The social planner would want consumers like Joyce, Dawn, and Sandi 
to buy Claritin because their willingness-to-pay values are all higher than the marginal 
cost of producing Claritin. If they buy, social surplus increases by the difference between 
their willingness-to-pay values and the marginal cost of production, or $2 + $1 + $0.50 = 
$3.50. Indeed, the social planner could choose the same outcome as that which results in the 
perfectly competitive equilibrium because that outcome maximizes social surplus.
In analyzing how Schering-Plough produces in its monopoly equilibrium, the planner 
would view the quantity produced as too low. So the social planner would direct Schering-
Plough to produce many more Claritin pills than the firm would prefer to produce. This is 
the reason why monopolies cause a breakdown of the invisible hand results discussed in 
Chapter 7.
So why doesn’t Schering-Plough produce extra Claritin pills and charge a slightly lower 
price to Joyce, Dawn, and Sandi? The reason is that by so doing, it would then have to 
charge a slightly lower price to all buyers, such as Augie and Gary—a move that would 
lower profits, as we showed earlier in the chapter in our discussion of optimal profits and 
the price and quantity effects associated with changing price.
Because the all-knowing social planner is merely a mythical construct, we can ask if 
there is any practical, realistic way to attempt to reach the maximum level of social sur-
plus achieved in a perfectly competitive market. Is there any recourse beyond having the 
government step in and direct Schering-Plough how to price? The answer is yes, but we 
suspect that it is an approach that may make you less than fully comfortable. Let’s discuss 
that now.
Three Degrees of Price Discrimination
Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get all the deals? Maybe you buy a 
plane ticket home for $500, only to learn that the frequent flyer in the seat next to you paid 
$350. Likewise, you might get irked if you’re standing in a checkout line at Walmart when 
the man in front of you pulls out a coupon for a free T-shirt—the same shirt you’re about 
to purchase for $15!
In such situations, consumers are often displeased and struck with the perceived unfair-
ness of the transaction. Producers, however, are ecstatic because of their success at price 
discrimination. Price discrimination occurs when firms charge different consumers dif-
ferent prices for the same good or service. Provided that buyers who receive low prices can-
not simply turn around and sell to buyers who receive high prices (we call this arbitrage), 
companies might be able to enhance their profits by engaging in price discrimination.
We typically discuss three types of price discrimination:
	
1.	 First-degree, or perfect price discrimination, in which consumers are charged 
the maximum price they are willing to pay
	
2.	 Second-degree price discrimination, in which consumers are charged different 
prices based on characteristics of their purchase, such as the quantity they purchase
	
3.	 Third-degree price discrimination, in which different groups of consumers are 
charged different prices based on their own attributes (such as age, gender, location, 
and so on)
Let’s see how first-degree price discrimination works by continuing with the example 
from Exhibit 12.12. In this scenario, if Schering-Plough knew each individual’s willing-
ness to pay, it would charge the five consumers exactly that amount—$5 per pill for Augie, 
$4 for Gary, $3 for Joyce, $2 for Dawn, and $1.50 for Sandi. By 
so doing, Schering-Plough can extract all consumer surplus from 
the buyers.
Extending this logic to the entire market reveals some interest-
ing insights. If you, as the monopolist, are able to perfectly price 
discriminate, then the outcome would be not only to maximize 
your own profits but also to maximize social surplus. To see why, 
let’s reconsider the monopoly outcome, which is summarized 
in panel (a) of Exhibit 12.13. Panel (b) of the exhibit shows the 
monopoly outcome with perfect price discrimination. As panel (b) 
Price discrimination occurs when 
firms charge different consumers 
different prices for the same good 
or service.
Perfect price discrimination, 
also known as first-degree price 
discrimination, occurs when a firm 
charges each buyer exactly his or 
her willingness to pay.
Second-degree price discrimination 
occurs when consumers are 
charged different prices based on 
characteristics of their purchase.
Third-degree price discrimination 
occurs when price varies based on a 
customer’s attributes.
If you as the monopolist are able to 
perfectly price discriminate, then the 
outcome would be not only to maxi-
mize your own profits but also social 
surplus.

shows, with perfect price discrimination you expand production until the demand curve 
intersects the marginal cost curve (point QC). When doing so, Schering-Plough’s producer 
surplus includes the entire consumer surplus and the deadweight loss because it expands 
production until P = MC, and charges each consumer his willingness to pay.
The exhibit shows that you have been able to dramatically increase Schering-Plough’s 
surplus through perfect price discrimination. Yet, it also shows that in aggregate consumers 
clearly suffer. Because the monopolist is able to extract every penny each consumer would 
be willing to pay when it practices first-degree price discrimination, consumer surplus 
equals zero.
We are now in a position to compare social surplus in the Claritin market before and 
after first-degree price discrimination. The entire story is found in Exhibit 12.13, which 
shows with perfect price discrimination, we have completely eliminated the deadweight 
loss of monopoly. Thus, perfect price discrimination is socially efficient: it provides the 
maximum level of social surplus. This equilibrium is also a Pareto-efficient equilibrium 
(as we discussed in Chapter 7) because no one can be made better off without making 
someone else worse off. What might concern you is the extreme inequity in the allocation 
of surplus—buyers receive no surplus and the seller receives all of it!
In practice, perfect price discrimination is difficult. There are two reasons. First, it is 
hard to charge every consumer a unique price. Second, it is challenging to know every 
consumer’s willingness to pay. Therefore, other forms of price discrimination are more 
prevalent in practice. In many of these cases, the monopolist does not know the exact will-
ingness to pay of different consumers but can still improve its profits by charging different 
prices based on perceived differences in willingness to pay.
We focus next on third-degree price discrimination because it affects all of us daily. 
Third-degree price discrimination occurs when price varies by customer or location attri-
butes. You might wonder why movie theatres, restaurants, golf courses, and the like charge 
a lower price to children and senior citizens. Likewise, we have found that sometimes car 
dealerships base their negotiating practices on the gender or race of the car buyer. These 
are all attempts to price discriminate based on an observable characteristic that the seller 
believes is correlated to the consumer’s willingness to pay. In such cases, the monopolist 
segments its customers into groups and maximizes profits by effectively acting like a mo-
nopolist in each submarket, setting MR = MC in each.
Following up on our Claritin example, if the willingness-to-pay values for Augie, Gary, 
Joyce, Dawn, and Sandi were indicative of the population at large, it would be profitable

for the firm to segment by gender and charge men a higher price than women. For ex-
ample, simply moving from charging one price of $3.50 to charging men $4 per pill and 
women $2 per pill would increase profits significantly. By paying $4 instead of $3.50, 
Augie and Gary provide $1 more in total profits. And, whereas at a price of $3.50 the 
three women do not purchase Claritin and therefore add nothing to Schering-Plough’s 
profits, when they are charged $2 they add $2 to profits because both Joyce and Dawn 
now purchase Claritin.
Both first- and third-degree price discrimination are examples where the monopolist 
charges different prices to different people based on their perceived differences in willing-
ness to pay. There are important cases, however, when sellers are not able to differentiate 
between types of consumers. Perhaps they do not have good indicators of how much vari-
ous consumers are willing to pay. Even in this situation price discrimination can exist. For 
example, Apple gives discounts if you purchase a large quantity of song downloads from its 
iTunes music store. Tire salesmen often sell four tires for $200 and one for $75. Bakeries 
sell a dozen doughnuts for $7, whereas two doughnuts sell for $1.50. Likewise, a standard 
arrangement between industrial customers and providers is that those who buy in bulk 
enjoy substantial discounts.
In cases where consumers are charged different prices based on characteristics of their 
purchase, second-degree price discrimination is said to exist. Beyond the examples above, 
can you think of situations when you were a consumer and a firm practiced second-degree 
price discrimination?
Third-degree price discrimination can often rear an ugly 
head. Consider a recent field experiment that compared 
people confined to wheelchairs with a group of non-­
disabled people. The subjects of interest were in need 
of car repairs. For the disabled, it’s a hassle to even leave 
the house, much less shop around for a few price quotes.  
This means that there are real search differences between 
the disabled and non-disabled.
It turns out that the disabled aren’t the only ones who 
know this. Mechanics know it, too, and adjust the prices 
they charge the disabled accordingly.
We know this because field experiments3 have been 
conducted that have randomized whether a disabled or 
nondisabled person brings a banged up (but still specially 
equipped for the disabled) car to an auto repair shop. 
What do the data say?
If it happens that a disabled person is the one who is 
asking for a price quote, then the price he is charged is 
20 percent higher than the price a nondisabled person 
is charged. You can see this in the accompanying exhibit 
by just comparing the orange and purple lines above the 
word Baseline: the disabled are quoted an average price 
of $600, whereas the nondisabled pay around $500.
You might be thinking that this isn’t necessarily price 
discrimination based on search differences. It might just 
be that mechanics don’t like people in wheelchairs. But 
the same study tested this idea by also having every 
person in both groups say the following line when they 
were getting a quote, “I am getting a few price quotes 
today.”
Turns out that just saying this simple line caused the 
price quotes that the handicapped were getting to drop 
a lot. To see this, just compare the first orange line to the 
one above “Say few price quotes” in the exhibit.
What about the nondisabled? Their price quotes stayed 
about the same, suggesting that there was never any 
doubt in the minds of mechanics that the nondisabled 
shop around for the best price.
This case represents an example of third-degree price 
discrimination: body shop mechanics were using the 
fact that the disabled had a hard time searching so they 
tended to charge all disabled people a higher price in an 
effort to enhance their profits.

Bill Gates spent much of his time defending 
­Microsoft in an antitrust case filed by the U.S. 
­Department of Justice in 1998.
The Department of Justice in the United States, and many similar agencies in other 
countries, actively attempts to keep various industries in check. One of their main pur-
poses, sometimes referred to as antitrust policy, is to prevent anticompetitive pricing, 
low quantities, and deadweight loss from emerging and dominating markets. Some mo-
nopolies, such as natural monopolies, are unavoidable. But, as we learned in this chapter, 
monopoly pricing is potentially detrimental to society and quite costly for consumers. 
The goal of antitrust policy is to keep markets open and competitive.
In the United States, antitrust policy started in 1890 with the Sherman Act, even 
though several states had adopted similar statutes prior to this legislation. This was 
the era of the so-called “robber barons”—men such as John D. Rockefeller, Andrew 
­Carnegie, and Cornelius Vanderbilt, who had dominated certain industries—who were 
often accused of using questionable methods and unfair practices. The Sherman Act 
and the policies of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were pitched 
against such monopolies.
The Sherman Act prohibited any agreements or actions that would put restraints on 
trade—in essence, prohibiting anything to do with monopolizing markets. Moreover, it 
made such attempts felonies, punishable not only by large fines but also by prison sen-
tences. These antitrust policies led to the breakup of Standard Oil and introduced greater 
regulation of other large monopolies, including the dominant banks of the era, which 
were becoming increasingly powerful. Today, U.S. antitrust policy is still based on the 
Sherman Act.
The Microsoft Case
In May 1998, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit under the Sherman Act against 
arguably the most successful corporation of the 1990s, Microsoft. It claimed that Micro-
soft was engaging in unfair practices in order to monopolize the market. The crux of the 
case concerned the fact that Microsoft was bundling its Windows operating 
system with its Internet Explorer browser. The Department of Justice argued 
that Microsoft made it effectively impossible for alternative browsers, such 
as Netscape, to maintain a large market share. As a result, Microsoft was ac-
cused of achieving monopoly power through unfair practices. The suit was 
filed the day Windows 98 was released with Internet Explorer bundled into 
the operating system.
After a long trial, the ruling ultimately went against Microsoft—both 
in this case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and in similar cases 
brought against it in Europe by the European Commission. At some point, 
there was even the possibility that Microsoft would be broken into sepa-
rate companies—one unit for selling the Windows operating system and the 
other for selling applications software. In the end, Microsoft paid various 
fines and agreed to change its operating system and marketing practices to 
make it easier for alternative browsers and other applications to be used with 
Windows.
The Microsoft case is interesting, not only because it illustrates the power 
of antitrust laws in the United States but also because it raises questions about 
what should be considered monopoly power in today’s new and dynamic in-
dustries. Could Microsoft really develop a monopoly in the same way as Stan-
dard Oil did in the oil business? Some believe that the answer is yes, and this 
reasoning was the one that prevailed in the courts. In fact, some economists be-
lieve that the dangers of such monopolization are even stronger today, because 
many software products are subject to network externalities. Compatibility is-
sues are the main source of such network effects, and they are undoubtedly 
present in many products.

A simple example of a network effect is your choice of a DVD player. At some point, 
both HD DVD and Blu-Ray were viable choices for the next generation of DVDs. 
Network effects are important in consumer choices—when all of your friends purchase 
and use Blu-Ray, then HD DVD becomes much less attractive for you because you will 
be unable to exchange discs with them. Ultimately, if all stores carry mostly ­Blu-Ray, 
then it will be difficult for you even to find HD DVD discs. Such network effects were 
the basis of the claim that in many software-related industries, products that achieve 
­sufficient market share become difficult to compete against and thus develop monopoly 
power.
Some other economists recognize the importance of network effects but nevertheless 
believe that software and other IT industries are inherently competitive and cannot be mo-
nopolized in the same way that the oil business was a century ago. This group thought that 
the Department of Justice’s case against Microsoft was beyond the scope of the original 
Sherman Act. They argued that if Microsoft’s operating system became too expensive, a 
new operating system, with greater compatibility with other products, would be supplied 
at a lower price, because software innovations cannot come to an end. There are always 
potential competitors watching the industry, and they will seize any opportunity to make 
a profit as soon as it becomes available. The Microsoft case still remains one of the most 
debated among economists today.
Price Regulation
In the past, one government solution has been to allow the monopoly to keep its market 
share but regulate the price it may charge. The notion is that a lower price will expand the 
purchase opportunities for consumers. This seems like a simple enough solution . . . until 
it is time to decide on the “fair” price a monopolist may charge. Two pricing options have 
dominated discussions: setting price equal to marginal cost, and setting price equal to aver-
age total cost.
It may seem that the proper choice is obvious: set price equal to marginal cost because, 
as we know, that is the price at which total surplus is maximized. A price set at marginal 
cost is called the efficient or socially optimal price. Unfortunately, the choice is not this 
simple. As we have learned, in some cases marginal cost is lower than average total cost at 
every level of quantity (this occurred in our Claritin example). This means that setting price 
equal to marginal cost will cause the firm’s total revenue to be less than the total cost, so 
the firm will experience an economic loss and will eventually exit the industry if this sort 
of regulation is imposed.
One solution to this problem is to have the government make up for any losses incurred 
by the monopolist. Unfortunately, the government must raise this money through taxes, and 
as we learned in Chapter 10, government taxes lead to a deadweight loss. Another solu-
tion is to allow the monopolist to charge a higher price—a price equal to its average total 
cost. This price level is called a fair-returns price. Although the fair-returns price does 
not maximize surplus—we again have a deadweight loss—it does allow the monopolist to 
make zero economic profits. This means that the monopolist can stay in business without 
the government making up for the losses incurred.
Unfortunately, these two forms of regulation have their own efficiency problems. The 
main one is that there is now a loss of incentive for the firm to minimize costs, because in 
either case the firm is guaranteed to make zero economic profits. There is also a lack of 
profit motive to innovate and produce new goods and services because the firm will not 
reap the economic rewards.
Now that we have considered ways in which government can regulate monopoly, we 
should consider whether regulating monopoly is the right course of action in the first 
place. In both cases, there are costs to consumers. With an unregulated monopoly, con-
sumers pay a higher price, quantity is lower than socially optimal, and there is a dead-
weight loss. With a regulated monopoly, consumers pay a lower price but there is a 
deadweight loss either as a result of “tax and transfer” to the monopolist or as the result 
of an inefficient price. Many economists have argued that allowing unregulated monopo-
lies to exist is, in practice, more efficient than price regulation. We turn to some of this 
evidence now.
An efficient, or socially optimal 
price is set at marginal cost.
A price set at average total cost is a 
fair-returns price.

Evidence-Based Economics
A
fter learning the rather grim details about monopoly pricing and the deadweight 
loss associated with monopolies, many might wish to turn their backs on mo-
nopolies forever. You might think, “What could be worse than greedy monopo-
lists rolling in money at the expense of ripped-off customers?” Indeed, that is what 
happened when you set the price for Claritin tablets for Schering-Plough.
Perhaps this is why countries such as Canada and India do not permit such extrava-
gant monopoly profits. In Canada, the government controls prices for pharmaceuticals, 
and India does not afford innovators strong patent protection. Maybe these countries 
have it right—why not restrict monopolists in some shape or form?
We must keep in mind that it is the ability to make extraordinary profits that serves 
as an important motivator to many inventors. Firms that are allowed monopoly prof-
its search out every possible avenue for innovative technologies that they can bring to 
market, whether it is a cure for AIDS or a programming code for a search engine that 
will make our lives easier. If we lived in a world of perfect competition, firms would 
have less of a reason to invest in the creation of new products—research and develop-
ment (R&D)—because they would not enjoy the same levels of profit from innovation. 
Through entry, economic profits would be driven to zero in the long run.
This presents us with a conundrum: if we allow a firm to have monopoly power, we 
are assuredly not maximizing social surplus because of deadweight loss. But if we do 
not grant innovators protection, we might not experience a wide variety of goods and 
services because profits may not be available to spur invention. In the case of Claritin, 
the issue boils down to whether you want to suffer with more sneezing, itchier eyes, and 
a runnier nose or pay $3.50 per tablet for Claritin.
The question naturally becomes an empirical one. Just how much more innovation do 
we have because of patent and copyright protection?
When a company obtains a patent, it receives exclusive rights to produce and sell a 
good or service. This exclusive right allows the firm to act as a monopolist and to set 
its own price, which, as we have learned in this chapter, is higher than the equilibrium 
price in a perfectly competitive market. If what we’ve read thus far about monopolies is 
true, then why would the government encourage and even provide the legal framework 
for such monopolistic behavior?
The answer is innovation.
There’s no perfect dataset to address the impact of patent and copyright protection on 
innovation, but let’s discuss several sources to develop an understanding. Our first stop 
will be the nineteenth-century World’s Fairs.
In the nineteenth century, inventors and firms flocked to the World’s Fairs. If the only 
type of fair you’ve seen is a state fair, then you might not be able to appreciate the scale 
of a World’s Fair. For example, the 1851 World’s Fair was held in the largest enclosed 
space at the time, attracted more than 6 million visitors, and gave space to more than 
17,000 inventors from 40 countries. Consider the following: to see every exhibit at the 
1876 World’s Fair would have required walking more than 22 miles!
What’s so exciting to economists about the World’s Fair is that at the time, patent 
laws varied considerably from country to country, and unlike today, it was very difficult 
to patent an invention outside the country of origin. As a result, data from guides for the 
nineteenth-century World’s Fairs, which had information on the country of the inventor, 
the industry of the invention, and whether the inventor had patented his or her invention, 
are a perfect test of the idea that patent laws are necessary for innovation.
An analysis of these data yields a nuanced answer that makes perfect sense: Some 
industries need patent protection more than others.4 In particular, inventors from coun-
tries without strong patent laws focused their attention on hard-to-duplicate inventions

like scientific instruments and food processing because they could easily hide 
the production techniques required to keep their invention a secret. On the 
other hand, inventors from countries with strong patent protection provided 
the bulk of innovations for manufacturing and other machinery, in part 
because these innovations are easily reverse-engineered.
What does this mean for us today? First, for innovations that 
aren’t easily kept secret we need patent protection. But on the 
other hand, not all industries need the same level of protection. 
For example, pharmaceutical drugs, which are easily copied 
by competitors that specialize in mass-producing generic drugs, 
might need a lot more protection than a clothing company that 
develops a new textile shrouded in secrecy.
However, too much protection isn’t a guarantee for more inno-
vation in the long run. In the 1990s, two major efforts were under-
taken to decode the human genome. One was an open-source effort, 
called the Human Genome Project. The other was a private effort by 
a firm called Celera. As time went on, some pieces of the genome were 
decoded by the Human Genome Project first and made freely available 
to everyone. Other pieces were decoded by Celera first, but in those in-
stances Celera used intellectual property law to prevent the Human Genome 
Project from decoding their sequences.
The difference in subsequent research on parts of the genome sequenced by 
the Human Genome Project and Celera is overwhelming. On average, 70 percent 
more scientific work was conducted on Human Genome Project sequences than Celera 
sequences.5
The takeaway is that innovation doesn’t just respond to incentives—it also requires 
inventors to be able to stand on the shoulders of those who came before them. In that vein, 
the monopoly power enjoyed by patent and copyright holders may both spur and hinder 
innovation. The optimal policy for granting innovators a monopoly over their invention 
should balance these costs and benefits.
Analyzing more than 20 years of data on competition and innovation seems to support 
this contention. In particular, the relationship between the level of competition that firms 
face and the amount of innovation arising from firms shows that innovation isn’t driven by 
(1) firms that face perfect competition or (2) firms that have an iron-clad monopoly. Rather, 
those firms in market structures in between—firms that enjoy some monopolistic power 
but are in industries with plenty of brilliant competitors to mimic and spur innovation—are 
the best to drive technological advancements.6

Chapter 12  |  Monopoly
Summary
A monopoly is an industry structure in which only one firm provides a good 
or service that has no close substitutes. Monopolies arise because of barriers to 
entry, which take two forms: legal and natural. In the legal form, government 
creates the barrier, as with a patent or copyright. In the natural form, control of 
key resources or achieving economies of scale in providing such goods as natural 
gas and electricity can result in a natural monopoly.
Barriers to entry permit the monopolist to exercise market power in making 
quantity and pricing decisions. The optimal action of the monopolist is to 
set Price > Marginal revenue = Marginal cost. This differs from a perfectly 
competitive industry, where Price = Marginal cost = Marginal revenue.
In equilibrium, monopoly leads to less quantity and higher prices compared 
to a perfectly competitive market equilibrium. In this way, because consumers 
are standing by ready to purchase from the monopolist for a price greater than 
marginal cost, social surplus is not maximized, leading to a deadweight loss.
There is an appropriate place for monopolies, and understanding whether 
a firm is occupying a monopoly status appropriately is a major concern of U.S. 
lawmakers. Even though there are costs to allowing firms to have monopoly power, 
the extra profit incentive might translate into better and more productive research 
and development for new products, medicines, and technologies.

	 1.	 What is meant by market power? What are the ways in 
which a monopoly gains market power?
	 2.	 Use a graph to explain the difference between a competi-
tive firm’s average total cost curve and the average total 
cost curve of a natural monopoly.
	 3.	 What does it mean to say that a good generates network 
externalities?
	 4.	 Why is national defense better off as a natural monopoly? 
What other industry or service do you think should be a 
natural monopoly?
	 5.	 There is no difference between a monopoly due to legal 
market power and a monopoly resulting from natural 
market power. Do you agree? Explain your answer.
	 6.	 Prior to the liberalization of the telecommunication mar-
ket in Singapore, there was only one company, Singapore 
Telecoms, that provided phone services in Singapore. Did 
this mean that Singapore Telecoms could charge any price 
it desired for its phone services? Explain your answer.
	 7.	 What is the difference between a perfectly competitive 
firm’s demand curve and a monopolist’s demand curve?
	 8.	 What is the relationship between price, marginal revenue, 
and total revenue for a monopolist?
	 9.	 Both competitive firms and monopolies produce at the 
level where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. Then, 
other things remaining the same, why is price lower in a 
competitive market than in a monopoly?
Select questions are available in MyEconLab for practice and instructor assignment.

	10.	 Why does a monopoly firm not have a supply curve?
	11.	 Explain why firms practice the following price discrimi-
nation, and classify the types of price discrimination.
	
a.	 A hotel charges walk-in customers a higher price than 
customers who book rooms in advance.
	
b.	 A supermarket is promoting a particular brand of 
canned food with a “buy two, get one free” offer.
	
c.	 Theaters charge a higher price during weekends and a 
lower price during weekdays for the same movie.
	12.	 To restrict a firm’s monopoly power, why can’t antitrust 
authorities just set a price floor or a price ceiling in the 
market?
	13.	 Are there any cases where a monopoly is beneficial to the 
economy? Explain.
Problems
	 1.	 As this chapter explains, a monopoly is an industry struc-
ture where only one firm provides a good or service that has 
no close substitutes. This question explores the last part of 
this definition further.
	
a.	 At one time Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite 
Radio were the only two satellite radio providers in 
the United States. The Department of Justice (DOJ) 
and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
approved the merger of the two companies in 2008 
even though Sirius-XM would then control 100 per-
cent of the satellite radio market. How do you think 
the two companies convinced the DOJ and the FCC to 
allow the merger to proceed?
	
b.	 In 1947, the United States government charged the 
DuPont Company with a violation of the Sherman 
Act. The government argued that DuPont was mo-
nopolizing the cellophane market. At trial, the govern-
ment showed that DuPont produced nearly 75 percent 
of all of the cellophane sold in the United States each 
year. Nonetheless, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 
favor of DuPont and dismissed the case. How do you 
think DuPont convinced the Supreme Court that it had 
not violated the Sherman Act?
	 2.	 Critically analyze the following and explain whether you 
agree or disagree:
	
a.	 Janet knows a lot of people who do not like Marmite®, 
a yeast extract that is used as a spread on toast. She 
says that Marmite is so unpopular that Unilever, the 
company that manufactures Marmite®, cannot possi-
bly have any monopoly power.
	
b.	 Edgar says that a single firm in the wind power indus-
try is unlikely to have a significant degree of monop-
oly power for an extended period of time. Since the 
cost of producing an additional unit of wind energy is 
so low, a large number of firms can enter the market 
and compete away economic profits.
	 3.	 Since many people use the Microsoft Windows operating 
system, software developers have an incentive to write 
new programs for Windows, computer manufacturers 
make new models of their computers that use Windows, 
and firms that make printers will be certain their printers 
work well on Windows computers. 
	
a.	 Show that Microsoft Windows is an example of a net-
work externality.
	
b.	 Suppose there are 10 people who use personal com-
puters and that the value to each of them from using 
Windows is as follows:
Number of People 
Using a Windows 
Computer

Who Uses a Windows

	 Suppose for the moment all 10 people are using 
­Windows and so Microsoft is a monopolist in the mar-
ket for computer operating system. Why would it be 
difficult for a company to offer a new alternative to 
Windows? Explain.
	 4.	 Textbook publishers hope to maximize profits. Authors, 
however, face very different incentives. Authors are typi-
cally paid royalties, which are a specified percentage of 
total revenue from the sale of a book. And so, for ex-
ample, if an author’s contract says that she will receive 
20 percent of the revenues from the sale of a text and 
the publisher’s total revenues are $100,000, the author’s 
royalties will be $20,000. Who will prefer a higher price 
for the text, the publisher or the author?

after PE class buy more orange juice from you. On the 
other hand, students after a class on calculus appear to be 
neutral to buying the orange juice.
	
a.	 If you were to charge the same price from every stu-
dent, what could you say about the consumer surplus

b.	 If you were to practice price discrimination, how 
would you price the orange juice when selling to the

	10.	 Consider a small city that is infested with cockroaches. 
You have just opened the only pest control company in 
the city. There are two distinct residential areas in the city, 
high-end area and low-end area, but the cost to extermi-
nate cockroaches is the same in both areas. Consider two 
consumers with different demand curves. Consumer A 
stays in the high-end residential area and has a relatively 
inelastic demand for your pest control service. In con-
trast, Consumer B stays in the low-end residential area 
and has a relatively elastic demand for your pest control 
service.
	
a.	 If you were to engage in price discrimination, who 
would you charge a higher price and who a lower 
price? Explain your answer.
	
b.	 What is the type of price discrimination you engage 
in in your answer to part (a)? What are the conditions 
for price discrimination to occur? Explain why you 
will earn a lower profit if you charge the same price 
to both customers as compared to exercising price 
discrimination.
	11.	 Imagine that you arrive at an economics experiment with 
six other people and are told that you will simulate a mar-
ket. You will be the only seller. The other five people will 
be assigned a dollar value that they will receive if they 
buy the good for any amount of money (so if a person’s 
value is $6, he will buy the good for any price less than 
$6 and will be happy). You are also given the following 
demand curve and told that it represents the values that 
the “buyers” are assigned:
	
b.	 What is the value of the consumer surplus, producer 
surplus, and deadweight loss in the market?
	
c.	 How would consumer surplus change if this market

	 8.	 Priceline is a web site that sells flights and hotel bookings 
based on the price that a consumer states that he or she is 
willing to pay. So consumers who want to book a flight or 
a hotel room need to tell Priceline the price they are will-
ing to pay, and the seller lets Priceline know whether it is 
willing to accept that price.
	
a.	 How do sellers make profits by using this form of

Is there value in putting 
yourself into someone 
else’s shoes?
Imagine yourself in the shoes of a person who has just ­committed 
armed robbery of a bank—in other words, you are the robber. Say 
that you have a partner in crime named Josie. You are both caught 
in the get-away vehicle, but before apprehension you both toss your 
guns into a storm drain. The police take both of you in to the local 
precinct and place you in separate interrogation rooms. When the 
detectives enter your room, they outline a set of three options for 
you and tell you that they are giving Josie the same three options:
	
1.	 If neither of you confesses to having a gun during the 
crime, you are both looking at jail time of 2 years for the 
robbery.
	
2.	 If one confesses to having a gun, the confessor goes free 
and the other serves ­substantial jail time—10 years.
	
3.	 If both of you confess to having a gun, then jail terms will 
be negotiated down to 5 years.
What should you do?
The simple economic framework we have developed thus far is not 
equipped to handle situations like these where your “payoffs” (satisfaction, 
profits, etc.) depend on the ­behavior of others and your behavior affects 
their payoffs. These situations include, among others, how to allocate scarce 
­resources in partnerships, firms, friendships, and families. You may wonder what 
economics has to do with friendships and families. Well, as it turns out, a lot.

KEY IDEAS
There are important situations when the behavior of others affects your 
payoffs.
Game theory is the economic framework that describes our optimal 
actions in such settings.
A Nash equilibrium is a situation where none of the players can do 
better by choosing a different action or strategy.
Nash equilibria are applicable to a wide variety of problems, including 
zero-sum games, the tragedy of the commons, and the prisoners’ dilemma.
Game theory is the study of situations in which the payoffs of one agent depend not 
only on his actions, but also on the actions of others. It emerged as a branch of mathematics 
that first focused on the analysis of parlor games. For example, when you’re playing poker 
and trying to figure out your opponent’s next move, you’re using game theory concepts. 
In 2000, a U.C.L.A. grad student named Chris Ferguson applied game theory concepts at 
the World Series of Poker, helping him secure prize money of $1.5 million and the cham-
pionship bracelet (his father taught game theory at U.C.L.A.!). But its use is considerably 
broader than in parlor games. Economists, political scientists, and sociologists use game 
theory to analyze a variety of problems, ranging from competition between firms (as we 
will see in the next chapter), negotiations and bargaining (as we will see in Chapter 17), 
social cooperation (as we discuss in this chapter and in Chapter 18), voting and other politi-
cal decisions, and many others.
In this chapter, we present the basic tools of game theory and explain how they are 
useful for understanding and analyzing many different economic decisions. Such an un-
derstanding provides you with an invaluable resource for studying individual interactions 
that you face daily, and for analyzing topics as varied as international trade negotiations, 
nuclear arms races, and labor arbitration. We will learn that many times it is, indeed, quite 
valuable to put yourself into another’s shoes.
Game theory is the study of 
strategic interactions.
Let’s return to the scene of the crime in the opening anecdote and explore how a game 
theorist would look at your problem. To begin, it is important to recognize the three key 
elements of any game:
	
1.	 The players
	
2.	 The strategies
	
3.	 The payoffs
Let’s first identify these three key elements in this particular game:
Players: You and Josie
Strategies: Confess or hold out
Payoffs: See Exhibit 13.1
A payoff matrix represents the payoffs for each action players can take in a game. In the pay-
off matrix shown in Exhibit 13.1, one player’s actions are read across in rows; the other play-
er’s actions are read down in columns. The cells where the actions intersect give the payoffs, 
which for now are assumed to correspond only to the number of years in prison each player

receives. In particular, more years in jail represent lower payoffs. Game theory can easily 
include things like loyalty and kindness payoffs, but here we remove those considerations.
The convention in writing payoff matrices is that the first number listed is always the payoff 
to the Row Player, and to make it even clearer, we have also put this number in red. The second 
number listed, which is in blue, is always the payoff to the Column Player. So, in this game, if 
you—the first player—confess and Josie also confesses, you each get 5 years in prison.
The scenario depicted in Exhibit 13.1 is a classic one known as the “prisoners’ dilemma.” 
Despite its simplicity, the prisoners’ dilemma illustrates several important features common 
to game theory. It involves interactions among a few players (in this case, two). This game 
is called a simultaneous move game because players select their actions at the same time. 
In the prisoners’ dilemma, this implies that both you and Josie have to pick your action 
simultaneously without knowing the other person’s choice. But it is assumed that you each 
do know the entire payoff matrix—that is, you each know the payoffs for both players.
When constructing a payoff matrix, it is important to understand that all relevant ben-
efits and costs of each action are taken into account. In this example, we assume that the 
payoffs represent all of the relevant payoffs to this game. Thus, we are assuming that other 
potentially important features, such as retribution after jail time is served, do not influence 
the payoffs of this game.
We are now in a position to ask the question game theory equips us to answer: what 
should you do?
Best Responses and the Prisoners’ Dilemma
A first step in figuring out how to play any game is to put yourself in the shoes of the 
other player. That is, a good way to reason through which action you should choose—
confess or hold out—is to think about what every possible action 
of the other player might be and then what your best choice will 
be for each of them. For example, suppose that Josie decides to 
confess. In that case, your payoffs when she chooses to hold out 
are no longer relevant—you should simply focus on the situation 
when she confesses. So, we can strike the column for Hold Out 
in Exhibit 13.1. We then end up with the single column shown 
in Exhibit 13.2.
Exhibit 13.2 makes it clear that in this instance when you hold out and Josie confesses, 
you will receive 10 years in prison, whereas if you also confess, you will serve 5 years. 
Therefore, your best response when you expect Josie to confess is to confess yourself. A best 
response is simply one player’s optimal strategy taking the other player’s strategy as given.
Suppose, instead, that you expect Josie to hold out. With the same best-response 
­approach as used above, we now strike the column for Confess in Exhibit 13.1. After doing 
so, we obtain Exhibit 13.3.
Going through the same steps, you see that confessing allows you to walk away with no 
jail time, whereas holding out puts you in prison for 2 years. Your best response in this case 
is again to confess. You now understand that no matter what you think Josie will do, you 
should always confess. This means that when you are placed in such a game, you should 
always choose to confess, regardless of what you think your partner will do.
Exhibit 13.1 Payoffs in the Prisoners’ 
Dilemma
The payoff matrix gives each player’s pay-
off from every possible combination of 
strategies of all players in the game. For 
example, in the prisoners’ dilemma, which 
has two players, the payoff matrix shows 
that if you confess and Josie also con-
fesses, you will each serve 5 years in prison. 
In contrast, if you both hold out, you will 
each receive 2-year prison sentences.
Row Player: You
Column Player: Josie
Confess
Hold Out
• You get 5 years
• Josie gets 5 years
Confess
Hold Out
• You get 10 years
• Josie is released
• You are released
• Josie gets 10 years
• You get 2 years
• Josie gets 2 years
In simultaneous move games, 
players pick their actions at the 
same time.
A first step in figuring out how to 
play any game is to put yourself in 
the shoes of the other player.
A strategy of a player is a best 
response to the strategies of the 
others in the game if, taking the 
other players’ strategy as given, it 
gives her greater payoffs than any 
other strategy she has available.

13.1
Dominant Strategies and Dominant Strategy Equilibrium
When a player has the same best response to every possible strategy of the other player(s), 
then we say that the player has a dominant strategy. In the game of Exhibit 13.1, confess-
ing is a dominant strategy because it is your best response to any strategy choice of your 
partner.
In the prisoners’ dilemma game, after doing the same exercise for Josie, you can reason 
that Josie has a dominant strategy of confessing, too. When a dominant strategy exists for 
both players, the notion of equilibrium for the game is straightforward. A strategy combi-
nation for the players is a dominant strategy equilibrium if the relevant strategy for each 
player is a dominant strategy. In the game above, there is a dominant strategy equilibrium: 
both players should confess because confessing is a dominant strategy for each player.
Interestingly, this equilibrium leads to an outcome that is not best for both players. Even 
though both you and Josie would be better off if you both held out, the dominant strategy 
equilibrium is for both of you to confess! This situation is the heart of the paradox that we 
have been studying so far—the “prisoners’ dilemma.” The “dilemma” part arises because 
by confessing, you and Josie will each spend 5 years in prison. However, if you were both 
to hold out, you would each spend 2 years in prison. Because less prison time is preferred 
to more, the (Confess, Confess) strategy combination gives strictly lower payoffs to both 
players than (Hold Out, Hold Out). Nevertheless, it is not in your (or in Josie’s) best interest 
to hold out, and this leads to the unique dominant strategy equilibrium in which you both 
confess. Thus the dilemma arises.
Games without Dominant Strategies
The prisoners’ dilemma game has a dominant strategy for each player. Yet, there are many 
games without a dominant strategy. Consider the case wherein you and your friend Gina, 
both avid surfers, open up a surf shop—Hang Ten in Da Den. Your main competition is 
a surf shop down the street, La Jolla Surf Shop. One key decision that you must make is 
Exhibit 13.2 Prisoners’ Dilemma Game 
with Your Partner Confessing
To determine your best response to 
a specific strategy by Josie, you first 
consider the column corresponding 
to that strategy. In this case, you take 
the column for Josie corresponding 
to ­Confess. You then compare your 
­payoffs under your two strategies, 
­Confess and Hold Out. You can see 
that when you confess in this case you 
will get 5 years, whereas if you hold 
out, you will get 10 years.
You
Josie
Confess
Hold Out
• You get 5 years
• Josie gets 5 years
Confess
• You get 10 years
• Josie is released
A dominant strategy is one best 
response to every possible strategy 
of the other player(s).
A combination of strategies is a 
dominant strategy equilibrium if 
each strategy is a dominant strategy.
Hold Out
You
Josie
Confess
Hold Out
• You are released
• Josie gets 10 years
• You get 2 years
• Josie gets 2 years
Exhibit 13.3 Prisoners’ Dilemma Game 
with Your Partner Holding Out
To determine your best response to 
Josie’s holding out, you consider the 
­column under Josie’s strategy of Hold 
Out and again compare your payoffs 
under your two possible strategies. In 
this case, if you confess you will walk 
free, and if you hold out you will spend 
2 years in prison.

whether to advertise. In fact, both your shop and La Jolla Surf Shop have similar decisions 
to make, which we assume are made simultaneously. Upon doing the necessary market 
research, you construct Exhibit 13.4, which provides the payoffs for this simple game.
A summary of the three key elements in this game are as follows:
Players: Hang Ten in Da Den and the La Jolla Surf Shop
Strategies: To advertise or not to advertise
Payoffs: See Exhibit 13.4
In the exhibit, the two rows correspond to your strategies and the two columns corre-
spond to La Jolla Surf Shop’s strategies. The top left cell gives both surf shops’ daily profits 
of $400 if both opt to advertise. In contrast, the lower right cell indicates that if both do 
not advertise, each shop earns a daily profit of $800. The higher profits from each of you 
not advertising are explained by the high cost of advertising and its lack of effectiveness: 
in this market, the main effect of advertising is to steal business from the other shop, not to 
persuade new customers into the market.
The other two cells (lower left and upper right) show the scenarios in which one of the 
shops advertises and the other does not. In these cases, whoever is advertising does consid-
erably better than the other shop because the surf shop that advertises steals some consum-
ers from the other shop. For example, if you place ads and La Jolla Surf Shop does not, you 
earn $700 per day while La Jolla Surf Shop earns only $300 per day.
What should you do? Let’s start with considering your best response. Suppose that 
you expect La Jolla Surf Shop to advertise. How should you best respond? Consider 
Exhibit 13.5, which excludes the column for Don’t Advertise from Exhibit 13.4.
Exhibit 13.5 makes it clear that when La Jolla Surf Shop chooses to advertise, your surf 
shop will earn $400 if you choose to advertise and will earn $300 if you do not. Therefore, 
your best response is to advertise when you expect that La Jolla Surf Shop will advertise 
because $400 > $300.
Suppose, instead, that you expect La Jolla Surf Shop to not place advertisements. We 
now strike the column for Advertise from Exhibit 13.4, and we are left with Exhibit 13.6. 
Your best response when La Jolla Surf Shop chooses not to advertise is to not advertise 
yourself. This is because when advertising, your shop earns $700 and when not advertising 
your shop earns $800, making you prefer not to advertise.
Exhibit 13.4 The Advertising Game
In this payoff matrix, the payoffs of the 
two surf shops depend on whether 
each decides to advertise or not to 
­advertise. For example, the cell at the 
top left-hand corner shows that if you 
both advertise, you will each receive 
a payoff of $400, while the cell at the 
bottom right shows that if you both 
choose not to advertise, you will each 
receive a payoff of $800.
Hang Ten
La Jolla

Don’t Advertise
• Hang Ten earns $400
• La Jolla earns $400

• Hang Ten earns $300
• La Jolla earns $700
• Hang Ten earns $700
• La Jolla earns $300
• Hang Ten earns $800

Exhibit 13.5 When La Jolla Surf Shop Advertises
To determine your best response to La Jolla 
choosing to advertise, you take the column under 
Advertise (corresponding to La Jolla’s choice of 
­advertising) and compare your payoffs from adver-
tising to not advertising. In this case, advertising 
gives you $400, whereas not advertising gives you 
$300. You should advertise.
Hang Ten
La Jolla
Advertise
Don’t Advertise
• Hang Ten earns $400
• La Jolla earns $400
Advertise
• Hang Ten earns $300
• La Jolla earns $700

Do you have a dominant strategy in this game? No; this is because your optimal strategy 
depends on what La Jolla Surf Shop chooses. Does La Jolla Surf Shop have a dominant 
strategy? By similar reasoning, it also does not have a dominant strategy. Thus there is not 
a dominant strategy for your surf shop or for La Jolla Surf Shop. In this case, you remain 
unsure as to what to do because your optimal choice depends on the choice of La Jolla Surf 
Shop. This particular game illustrates a key concept in game theory: you don’t always have 
a simple best response (a dominant strategy) that works against all strategies of others, as 
you do in games with a dominant strategy, such as the prisoners’ dilemma game.
Life doesn’t always present a game that has a dominant strategy. In the advertising 
example, what is best for your shop depends on what you expect the La Jolla Surf Shop 
to do. In such cases, where should we expect to end up in the payoff matrix—does your 
shop advertise? Does La Jolla Surf Shop advertise? Do both of you advertise? What is the 
equilibrium of this game?
Exhibit 13.6 When La Jolla Surf Shop Does 
Not Advertise
To determine your best response to La Jolla 
choosing not to advertise, you take the column  
under Don’t Advertise, and compare your 
­payoffs from advertising and not advertising. In 
this case, advertising gives you $700, whereas 
not advertising gives you $800. You should not 
advertise.

Recall that the notion of equilibrium we used in markets requires that all individuals are 
­simultaneously optimizing given the prices that they face in the market and their income 
levels. To put this differently, no individual can (unilaterally) change his strategy and 
be better off (or improve his payoff). This is intuitive: if a player did have a strategy that 
made him better off, then he would choose that strategy instead of the one he chose.
Nash Equilibrium

A Beautiful Mind
If you are a movie buff, you have surely 
seen the film based on the life of John 
Nash—a ­Hollywood blockbuster called 
A  Beautiful Mind. The film was nomi-
nated for eight Academy Awards, winning 
best picture in 2001. The film focuses 
on Nash’s mathematical genius and his 
struggle with paranoid schizophrenia.
Nash earned a doctorate in mathemat-
ics from Princeton in 1950 with a 28-page 
dissertation on game theory.1
Those 28 pages played a central role 
in developing the foundation of game the-
ory as we know it today. For this ­reason, 
the relevant notion of equilibrium in games is referred to as a “Nash equilibrium.” 
Nash was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in ­Economics for this contribution.

In equilibrium, no player in a game 
can change strategy and improve his 
or her payoff.
A strategy combination is a Nash 
equilibrium if each strategy is a best 
response to the strategies of others.
This is the essence of the equilibrium concept proposed by 
John Nash: in equilibrium, no player in a game can change strat-
egy and improve his payoff. Therefore, a combination of strat-
egies is a Nash equilibrium if each player chooses a strategy 
that is a best response to the strategies of others—that is, players 
are choosing strategies that are mutual best responses. What this 
means is that no one can change his choice and be better off. Ac-
cordingly, the dominant strategy equilibrium that we found in the 
prisoners’ dilemma game is a Nash equilibrium.
This notion of equilibrium depends on two critical factors: (1) that all players under-
stand the game and the payoffs associated with each strategy (so that they will choose what 
is best for themselves) and (2) that all players understand that other players understand 
the game.
In the context of a Nash equilibrium, we expect that an individual forms correct expecta-
tions about the intentions of other players in the game. As we will see when we consider 
experimental evidence on game theory later in this chapter, experience with a game may 
be necessary before we can safely assume that people act in the way that we think they are 
going to act.
Finding a Nash Equilibrium
The key to finding Nash equilibria in simultaneous move games is to follow the logic of 
finding best responses. Let’s return to the advertising decision. Begin by asking yourself: if 
La Jolla Surf Shop advertises, what should your shop do? As reasoned through above, your 
best response is to advertise. You then need to ask: once in this cell of the payoff matrix, 
does either surf shop have a reason to change its strategy?
The answer is no. La Jolla will not change its strategy because if it did, it would earn 
$300 rather than $400. Likewise, you will not change your strategy because if you did, you 
also would earn $300 rather than $400. Therefore, both shops choosing to advertise is a 
Nash equilibrium. That is, once both of you have opted to advertise, neither of you has an 
incentive to change your behavior.
Suppose instead that La Jolla Surf Shop chooses not to advertise. In this case, what 
should your shop do? As reasoned through above, your best response is not to advertise. 
Once in this cell, does either surf shop have a reason to change its strategy?
The answer is again no. La Jolla Surf Shop will not change its strategy because if it 
did, it would earn $700 rather than $800. Likewise, you will not want to change your 
strategy because if you did, you would earn $700 rather than $800. Therefore, not ad-
vertising is a Nash equilibrium for both surf shops. Once in that cell, neither of you has 
an incentive to change your strategy. Accordingly, in this particular game we have two 
Nash equilibria:
	
1.	 Your shop: advertise; La Jolla Surf Shop: advertise
	
2.	 Your shop: don’t advertise; La Jolla Surf Shop: don’t advertise
To illustrate how to find these two Nash equilibria in a payoff matrix, Exhibit 13.7 revisits 
the advertising game.
Let’s begin by thinking about what would happen if you choose to advertise and La 
Jolla does not. You will find yourself in the top right cell. Can you do better? Yes. In this 
case, you would like to change your choice because $800 > $700—thus the red arrow 
pointing downward from this box (it is red because it refers to you, the Row Player). 
Likewise, La Jolla would like to change its choice—thus the blue arrow pointing leftward 
from this box.
You can then use the same reasoning from the bottom left cell. If you are in this cell, 
both you and La Jolla will again change your behavior: you will opt to advertise because 
$400 > $300, and La Jolla will not advertise because $800 > $700. This shows that the 
Nash equilibria are best-response strategies with two arrows pointing in: (Advertise, Ad-
vertise) and (Don’t Advertise, Don’t Advertise). Once two arrows point inward, you can be 
certain that you have found a Nash equilibrium.

Exhibit 13.7 Two Nash Equilibria in the Advertising Game
The key to finding Nash equilibria is to determine if either player has an incen-
tive to change his strategy once in a cell. Let’s begin in the bottom left cell, 
where you do not advertise and La Jolla advertises. In this case, you would like 
to change your strategy (that is, the red arrow points upward denoting that if 
you are in this cell, you would like to change your strategy). La Jolla would also 
like to move away from this cell (its blue arrow points rightward from this cell). 
Once you consider every cell using this approach, the arrows are completed, 
and Nash equilibria occur when both arrows point to a cell. In this example, 
both strategy combinations (Advertise, Advertise) and (Don’t ­Advertise, Don’t 
Advertise) have the two arrows pointing to them, and are thus Nash equilibria.

Game theory doesn’t just apply to your surf shop’s com-
petition with La Jolla Surf shop. You and your partner, 
Gina, are individually just as affected by each other in 
the shop.
Consider a simple example of working versus surfing. 
Suppose that your daily payoffs—with no advertising—
are described in the payoff matrix below. You and Gina 
both receive $400 per day in net benefits if you each work 
at the surf shop. However, if you shirk your responsibilities 
and go surfing while Gina works, your shop does not sell 
as much, but you receive both the benefits from the shop 
staying open and the benefits from surfing, which sum to 
$500. If you both go surfing, however, the shop is closed 
and you both earn only surfing benefits of $200. What 
should you do?
In this situation, there are two Nash equilibria, as the 
best-response arrows demonstrate. One is for you to 
go surfing while Gina tends to the shop. The other is for 
you to tend to the shop while Gina surfs. When there are 
multiple Nash equilibria as in this case, which equilibrium 
will actually be played depends on many factors. For ex-
ample, if Gina is an assertive character and has always 
managed to get what she wants in her prior relations with 
you, we may expect that you working hard and her surf-
ing might be a natural “focal point” and have a greater 
likelihood of emerging than the other Nash equilibrium.

The payoff matrix of the work-or-surf game shows your 
payoffs and Gina’s payoffs depending on whether each 
of you chooses to work or surf. In this game, there are 
two Nash equilibria: (Surf, Work) indicating that you surf 
and Gina works, and (Work, Surf), corresponding to you 
working and Gina surfing.
It might at first seem odd that there are two Nash equilibria in the advertising game. But 
a moment’s reflection reveals that this is quite natural. It’s only worthwhile for you to ad-
vertise when La Jolla advertises, and vice-versa. It is, in fact, a common occurrence in game 
theory to have more than one Nash equilibrium, and in these cases, other factors, such as 
those we discuss in the box below, may determine which of the two equilibria are played.

With the necessary tools in place, we can now begin to study some of the ways in which we 
apply game theory to understand real-world problems. We’ll consider two quite different 
scenarios: pollution and soccer.
Tragedy of the Commons Revisited
Game theory is most often used when a few players make choices that affect each 
other’s payoffs. The same type of reasoning applies even when the number of players 
is large. The tragedy of the commons—the overuse of common resources resulting 
in a negative externality—which we studied in Chapter 9, can also be viewed as an 
­application of game theory. In particular, the same reasoning as that in the prisoners’ 
dilemma applies to the tragedy of the commons. When all others pollute the envi-
ronment, it is a best response for you to do so as well. Unfortunately, it is also the 
best ­response to pollute when all others actually go to the trouble of “being green.” 
­Therefore, in the tragedy of the commons, just as in the prisoners’ dilemma, mutually 
beneficial behavior may not emerge.
Consider the example of the Gowanus Canal, a canal in the New York City ­borough 
of Brooklyn. Pollution has become so bad in the canal that the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency placed it on its National Priority List. How could things get this bad in a 
major city?
Game theory can shed insights into the question. Exhibit 13.8 depicts the weekly profits 
for two firms on the canal: let’s call them Firm 1 and Firm 2. It shows that these profits 
depend on the firms’ pollution choices. Each firm’s choices affect each other’s profit be-
cause if one plant pollutes, it affects the productivity of the other (through both worker 
productivity as well as processing costs—each firm uses water from the canal for produc-
tion and dirty water is costly to clean). Unfortunately for the canal, the payoffs also show 
that, because it is costly to abate pollution, a firm is better off if it pollutes ­regardless of the 
other firm’s choice.
A summary of the three key elements in this game are as follows:
Players: Firm 1 and Firm 2
Strategies: To pollute or not to pollute
Payoffs: See Exhibit 13.8
As in the prisoners’ dilemma game, the dominant strategy equilibrium in Exhibit 13.8 
leads to an outcome that is not best for both players—to pollute. Both could have earned 
$70,000 in weekly profits and be better off if they had both chosen not to pollute. Never-
theless, in the dominant strategy equilibrium, both firms choose to pollute, and both they 
and society (which suffers from greater pollution) are worse off, creating a tragedy of the 
commons result.
This simple game structure contains some of the important elements of a crucial situa-
tion facing many corporations and individuals today: the pressing issue of not dirtying our

Exhibit 13.8 Payoff Matrix for Two Firms
The payoff matrix of the ­tragedy of the 
commons game gives Firm 1’s and Firm 2’s 
payoffs, ­depending on whether each 
­decides to pollute or not to pollute.
The Gowanus Canal in 
Brooklyn, one of the 
most polluted in the 
United States, shows 
the tragedy of the 
commons at work. As 
game theory would 
predict, when other 
firms choose to pollute, 
it’s a best response 
for your firm to do the 
same. But everyone is 
worse off as a result.

planet. And the Nash equilibrium of this game highlights exactly why we end up with dirty 
water and air, and why government intervention might be necessary.
Zero-Sum Games
Let’s move on to something more pleasant—soccer! Suppose that you are the designated 
penalty kicker for your intramural soccer team. Every time you walk up to the ball, you 
have an important decision to make: aim for the left of the net or for the right of the net (for 
simplicity, let’s ignore the options of aiming for the middle or shooting high or low). What 
should you do in such situations?
As in many game-theoretic situations, we can master this question by thinking generally 
about the incentives of your opponent—the goalie. The goalie will try to anticipate your 
behavior and will dive to the left or to the right. If he dives to the side where you kick the 
ball, then he has a pretty good chance of stopping it from going into the net, and if he dives 
to the opposite side, you are very likely to score.
In this example, the payoff matrix represents a zero-sum game, meaning that because 
one player’s loss is another’s gain, the sum of the payoffs is zero. Exhibit 13.9 shows that 
the outcomes for each strategy in the soccer game in fact constitute a zero-sum game. Let’s 
look at this situation in more detail.
A summary of the three key elements in this game are as follows:
Players: You and the goalie
Strategies: Right or left
Payoffs: See Exhibit 13.9
If you both go left, then the goalie is happy and you are not. Thus, the goalie receives 
1 unit of net benefits and you receive −1 unit of net benefits. If you kick right and he dives 
right, then the same payoff results because he saves the shot: +1 for him and −1 for you. 
However, if the goalie dives to the opposite side of where you kick the ball, then you score, 
resulting in a payoff of +1 to you and −1 to the goalie. These cells are in the bottom left 
and top right of the payoff matrix.
Zero-sum games are quite common in the real world. Whenever we sit down to play 
poker, our gains are another player’s losses. Whenever two companies compete to sell to 
the same consumers, one company’s gain is the other one’s loss. Redistribution is also often 
zero-sum: one person’s gain is often another’s loss.
Applying our method of finding Nash equilibria, we draw the arrows, as shown in 
­Exhibit 13.9. They show that no Nash equilibrium exists because there is not a cell in the 
matrix with two arrows pointing in. Therefore, the notion of Nash equilibrium that we have 
developed so far doesn’t make any predictions about the behavior in the penalty kick game.
We’re not finished yet, however. In games like this, maybe the best strategy is not to 
choose any one particular action. For example, what if you randomly choose between 
­kicking left and kicking right and the goalie does too? In that case, you would expect, on 
average, to be neither the loser with a payoff of −1 nor the winner with a payoff of 1, and 
thus, on average, you would end up with a payoff of zero.
In fact, choosing randomly has a clear advantage in this game relative to a pure strategy, 
which involves always choosing a single action for a situation. Consider one scenario of a 
In a zero-sum game, one player’s 
loss is another’s gain, so the sum of 
the payoffs is zero.
A pure strategy involves always 
choosing one particular action for a 
situation.
Exhibit 13.9 A Zero-Sum Game: Penalty Kicks
The payoff matrix of the penalty kick game gives 
the payoff of the kicker and the goalie, depending 
on whether the kicker kicks to the left or right and 
whether the goalie dives to the left or right (that 
is, dives to the Kicker’s left or right). This game is 
an example of a zero-sum game, because the pay-
offs of the two players sum to zero, indicating that 
whatever one wins, the other loses.

pure strategy for yourself: always kick right. If you always kick right, in 
time goalies will notice and best respond by always diving right. This 
will result in a certain negative payoff to you of −1. In fact, reason-
ing this way, we can see that any kind of “predictable” behavior by the 
kicker can be taken advantage of by the goalie, and vice-versa. If you are 
the kicker, you should therefore be as unpredictable as possible. Put dif-
ferently, you should randomize by playing a mixed strategy, which in-
volves choosing between different actions randomly (according to some 
preassigned probabilities). The essence of a mixed strategy is as follows: 
you should privately flip a fair coin before each penalty kick. When it 
comes up heads, you kick right; when it comes up tails, you kick left. 
This strategy represents the basics of the equilibrium in mixed strategies 
for this game: both the penalty taker and the goalie should randomize 
with a probability of 50–50 between left and right.
Now that we’ve seen some real-world applications of game theory, let’s analyze how 
real-world actors play in similar situations and how game theory does in predicting 
behavior.
A mixed strategy involves choosing 
different actions randomly.
Do people really play Nash equilibrium in practice? What about dominant strategies—are 
those frequently played? One might think that the answer to these questions should be a 
simple yes or no. But these questions are difficult to answer—in both the lab and in the real 
world—for two main reasons.
The first reason is that we often do not know the exact payoffs of individuals playing the 
game. In constructing the matrix games in the previous sections, we chose the payoffs and 
assumed that they were correct. In real-world situations, the payoffs are determined by the 
attitudes and feelings of individuals as well as by their monetary returns.
A second reason why we might not observe what game theory predicts is that it is, in 
essence, a theory, and models are not literal descriptions of how the world works—they are 
merely useful abstractions. As such, game theory abstracts from several details. In many 
situations, one player may be more cunning, wiser, or more experienced than another. For 
example, of two chess players, the more experienced, more clever player is likely to win. 
In many matrix games (with two or several players), repetition of the game usually ensures 
that results come closer to Nash equilibrium. With these caveats in mind, we turn to an 
example to illustrate how game theory’s predictions fare in real-world situations.
Game Theory in Penalty Kicks
Consider again the situation faced by penalty kickers and goalies. As you have already 
learned, the best move for both sides is to employ a mixed strategy—randomly choose left 
or right for each kick. But is that what actually happens in soccer games?
Three economists decided to analyze all the penalty kicks taken during a 3-year period 
in the French and Italian elite soccer leagues in order to test game theory.2 By examin-
ing 459 penalty kicks they were able to test whether the players actually did play mixed-
strategy Nash equilibria.
They classified kickers’ and goalies’ choices into one of three strategies: Left, Right, 
and Center. This is just a bit more complicated than our Left/Right example earlier in the 
chapter, but the logic of the game’s mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium is the same: penalty 
kickers and goalies should randomize across the choices.
Amazingly, this is just what the economists found in the actual data. The kickers and 
goalies both seemed to be randomizing their direction choices almost perfectly. So chalk 
up a victory for game theory. It predicted the behavior of these players—who certainly had 
a lot at stake in the games they were playing and therefore had a lot of incentive to optimize 
their behavior—very well.

Section 13.5  |  Extensive-Form Games
349
13.5
The games that we have discussed so far all revolve around two players choosing an action 
simultaneously. Suppose that, instead, one player goes first and the other chooses an action 
only after seeing how the first player chose. This type of situation which specifies the order 
of play is represented by an extensive-form game.
In extensive-form games, the strategies are a little bit richer than in simultaneous games. 
For instance, in our work-or-surf game, it might be the case that you can decide to go surf-
ing before Gina has a chance to decide. Accordingly, you decide on whether you are going 
to work or surf and then Gina, after viewing your choice, decides whether she will work or 
surf. Or Gina might let you know her strategy before you decide on whether to go surfing: 
“If you go surfing, I will, too.”
Recall that strategies are not only the possible actions but are a description of how a 
player will act given every possible action of the other player. How do we model games 
with sequential decisions? As a first step, let’s contrast extensive-form games and simul-
taneous move games. Extensive-form games introduce the sense of timing that is missing 
in simultaneous move games. This sense of timing is relevant for negotiations in which 
different players make offers to each other over time (sequentially). It is also relevant for 
many more traditional games—in chess, for example, players do not make simultaneous 
choices. Rather, they “take turns.”
So we can say that an extensive-form game specifies the order of play and payoffs 
that will result from different strategies and uses a game tree to represent them. To better 
­understand the difference between extensive-form and simultaneous move games, let’s dis-
cuss more carefully the work-or-surf decision that you and Gina face. Exhibit 13.10 shows 
the work-or-surf game tree when you are the first mover.
This game tree has three sets of “nodes.” The first, the red node 
at the far left—represents the first decision maker, in this case, 
you. This is the spot where you decide whether you will work or 
go surfing. In essence, your choice is to travel either the green 
branch—work—or the orange branch—surf.
Gina’s decision comes only after she views your decision, 
­represented by one of the two blue nodes labeled “Gina.” Whether 
you place her at the top node (you decided to work) or at the 
bottom node (you decided to surf), she has the same decision to 
make: work or surf. The payoffs for each of those decisions are in 
Extensive-Form Games
13.5
An extensive-form game is a 
representation of games that 
specifies the order of play.
A related study found a similar pattern of randomization in serve choices in professional 
tennis matches (where predictably serving to the right or to the left would enable the other 
player to return more effectively).3 Indeed, this research on tennis provides interesting 
quotes from two tennis greats when it notes: “After a recent match, Venus Williams said 
she had shown her opponent, Monica Seles, several different types of serves. ‘You have 
to work on that, because it’s very easy to become one-dimensional and just serve to your 
favorite space and the person is just waiting there.’ Seles responded, ‘She mixed it up very 
well.’” Game theory at work!
Exhibit 13.10 A Game Tree for the Work-or-Surf 
Game
In the extensive-form game of the work-or-surf 
game, you first decide whether to work or surf. Then 
Gina, after observing your choice, decides whether 
to work or surf. The extensive form is useful in show-
ing the play sequencing. The numbers given at the 
end are the payoffs to you and Gina. For example, if 
both you and Gina work, you each earn $400.

the end of the game tree. These payoffs follow our earlier coloring convention. Given this 
game form, what should you now do?
Backward Induction
The easiest way of approaching any extensive-form game is to use backward induction. 
Backward induction is the procedure of solving an extensive-form game by first con-
sidering the last mover’s decision. Given the last mover’s decision, we then consider the 
second-to-last mover, and so on. The name derives from the fact that this procedure starts 
from the end of the game and solves backwards.
To backward-induct, you first consider each decision node at the end of the game. If you 
work (green branch), then Gina finds herself in the top decision node. Now, Gina has the 
choices depicted in panel (a) of Exhibit 13.11.
Accordingly, Gina chooses between working, which yields payoffs of (You: $400, Gina: 
$400), and surfing, which yields payoffs of (You: $300, Gina: $500). In this case, Gina 
should choose to surf because the net benefits to her are $500, which is $100 higher than 
the net benefits under the alternative of working ($400). Given that she will choose to surf, 
your payoff will be $300 if you initially chose to work.
On the other hand, if you choose to surf (orange branch), then Gina finds herself at 
the ­bottom decision node, as shown in panel (b) of Exhibit 13.11. Here, she again has the 
choice between working and surfing. If she works, the payoffs are (You: $500, Gina: $300) 
and if she surfs, the payoffs are (You: $200, Gina: $200). Thus, if you decide to surf, Gina 
will choose to go to work because she will earn $100 more in net benefits by working. 
Given that she will choose to work, your payoff will be $500.
We have now completely described Gina’s optimal strategies, which are:
“Choose to work if you surf” and
“Choose to surf if you work.”
Why is it important to know Gina’s strategies? Because you can now make a decision 
knowing how Gina will respond to every one of your actions. With this information 
in hand, you have successfully backward-inducted. Such backward induction allows 
you to make an informed decision as to whether you should work or surf. So, what 
should you do?
You know that if you choose to go to work, Gina will surf, netting you a payoff of $300. 
Alternatively, if you choose to surf, she will work, leaving you with a payoff of $500. The 
decision now seems straightforward: you should go surfing because you will receive a 
payoff that is $200 higher than if you go to work.
Recall that when the decisions were made simultaneously, there were two Nash equi-
libria. Now, with sequential decision making, the backward-induction procedure has 
­delivered a unique equilibrium: you Surf and Gina works.
Backward induction is the 
procedure of solving an extensive-
form game by first considering the 
last mover’s decision in order to 
deduce the decisions of all previous 
movers.
Exhibit 13.11 Gina’s Game Trees If You Decide to Work  
and If You Decide to Surf
Backward induction involves starting at the end of the game and solving it 
­backward. In this case, you look at Gina’s decision of whether to work or surf after 
she has observed whether you have worked or surfed. Panel (a) looks at the case 
­following your choice to work; panel (b) looks at the case following your choice 
to surf.

First-Mover Advantage, Commitment, and Vengeance
The equilibrium above is much more favorable to you than to Gina: you receive $500, 
whereas she receives $300. This outcome occurs even though the payoffs to the differ-
ent actions are the same for you and Gina. We say that the sequential game features a 
first-mover advantage if the first mover earns more benefits than the second mover.
One particularly relevant form of first-mover advantage is the value of commitment. To 
illustrate the main idea, let’s consider an extension of the work-or-surf game.
Using backward induction, we obtained a unique equilibrium in this game: you surf and 
Gina works, even though she would have been better off if you had chosen to work. If only 
she could threaten you with punishment, using the following strategy: “If you surf, I will go 
surfing, too!” But such an action is not credible in the sense that when push comes to shove, 
Gina will choose not to surf when you go surfing because by so doing she will forego $100 
in net benefits. You know that she will choose to work.
Is there any way that Gina can turn the tables on you by taking away the first-
mover advantage? In fact, there is. The trick is for her to make a credible commitment. 
A ­commitment is an action that one cannot turn back on later, even if it is costly. One 
commitment device would be for her to throw her shop keys into the Pacific Ocean. 
With no keys, the only way that she can get into the shop is for you to go to work. She 
has changed the game, making the choice very simple for you. Exhibit 13.12 shows the 
simple decision tree. Gina has effectively eliminated the possibilities that you surf and 
she works.
Now what should you do? It is clear that both outcomes when you work ($400 and 
$300) are better than when you surf ($200). So, given that Gina has credibly committed to 
not working without you, the way that you maximize your payoff is to go to work. Gina 
will then choose to surf, securing a payoff for herself of $500, effectively taking advan-
tage of her credible commitment of tossing her shop keys in the ocean. As demonstrated 
in Exhibit 13.12, such a credible threat leads to a unique equilibrium that is much more 
advantageous to Gina.
Several modes of behavior may be understood in light of this example. Suppose, 
for example, that you can consciously or subconsciously (truthfully, or perhaps just 
for show) establish a reputation as somebody who bears a grudge and who would seek 
revenge against misdeeds even though this is potentially costly for you (because of the 
conflicts and fights that such revenge will induce). If you can (in the eyes of others) 
commit to punishing bullies, you likely won’t be bullied. This reasoning also suggests 
that perhaps vengeance or a reputation for revenge-seeking behavior might have some 
game-theoretic reasoning.
Now with this understanding of how sequential games work, let us turn to the value of 
putting yourself into someone’s shoes—this time, the shoes of another individual who will 
respond to your actions.
A game has a first-mover 
advantage when the first player 
to act in a sequential game gets a 
benefit from doing so.
Exhibit 13.12 An Extensive-Form Game 
with a Credible Commitment
A commitment is an action that one ­cannot 
take back. Commitments, which come 
­before other actions, can change who has 
the advantage. If Gina throws her keys 
into the ocean before you decide whether 
to work or surf, she will have credibly 
­committed to not working, and this will 
force you to work instead.

A
braham Lincoln once said, “When I am getting ready to reason with a man, 
I spend one-third of my time thinking about myself and what I am going to say, 
and two-thirds about him and what he is going to say.” President Lincoln keenly 
understood that it was necessary to put himself into the other man’s shoes before discus-
sions started. Anticipating the demands and strategies of his opponents made Lincoln 
one of the United States’ most celebrated presidents. He thought deeply about the high-
stakes sequential games he had to win to steer the United States through the Civil War.
One way of investigating more systematically the question we pose in this section is 
to conduct lab experiments using trust games. One variant of the trust game is shown 
in ­Exhibit 13.13. There are two players, you and Bernie. You are the first mover and 
must decide whether or not to trust Bernie. The associated payoffs to this game are as 
follows: (1) If you choose not to trust Bernie, then both you and Bernie receive a payoff 
of $10. (2) If you choose to trust Bernie, then Bernie must choose to either defect or 
cooperate. If he defects, then you receive nothing and Bernie receives $30. If Bernie 
cooperates, then both of you receive $15.
How will you play this game?
Assuming that Exhibit 13.13 contains all of the relevant payoffs, then you should 
use backward induction to solve this game. If you put yourself into Bernie’s shoes, you 
would defect if given the chance. This is because by defecting, Bernie earns $30, which 
is greater than his cooperation earnings of $15. So you should choose not to trust Bernie 
because you now know that if you did trust him, he would choose to defect, because 
$30 is greater than $15. So the equilibrium of this game is for you not to trust Bernie. 
This is a bad outcome in the sense that it is not socially efficient: instead of earning a 
total of $30, you and Bernie only earn $20 ($10 each) because you do not trust Bernie. 
In this way, the trust game is a sequential prisoners’ dilemma game.
You will notice that many situations in the real world look like this game. Every 
time you trust a stranger, or even a friend, there is a risk that person will disappoint you. 
When you call a plumber to repair your leaking faucet, there is a risk that he will take 
your money but do a shoddy job and the faucet will start leaking again in a few weeks. 
When you enter a car lot hoping to find a good deal on a used sports car, you face the 
same risk—what if the car is a lemon?
If the equilibrium is as characterized in Exhibit 13.13, the world would be a sad and 
dysfunctional place. What factors could cause the equilibrium in Exhibit 13.13 to be 
different? One important factor is reputational concerns: if the game is played several

times, the players might attempt to develop a reputation. For example, you visit the same 
coffee shop, bakery, butcher shop, and dry cleaner, and you often hang out with the same 
friends. In all of these cases, you and the other agents you are interacting with can develop 
a reputation for trustworthiness and not misbehaving, and this reputation can then help you 
achieve better payoffs.
In Exhibit 13.13, even though it makes sense for you not to trust Bernie in a one-shot 
game, if you were to play, say 100 times, it might make sense for you to trust Bernie and for 
Bernie to play nicely, because you can both be better off if you receive $15 ­every round of 
play rather than $10 each. This long-run strategy might shed light on the kinds of interac-
tions we observe constantly in the real world—for ­example, why businesspeople trust one 
another, or friends and families share trust.
How can we shed light on such a game in the real world and compare behavior in one 
shot versus repeated games? One approach is to run a field experiment, which is what one 
of the authors of this book (John List) did at several sports card trading shows.4 At these 
shows, dealers—think Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons—set up booths to buy and 
sell sports cards. Just like many goods we purchase sports cards have uncertain quality. 
Not every Derek Jeter rookie card is the same, and just as an experienced mechanic can 
inspect a car and determine its quality, an elaborate grading system understood by licensed 
experts is used to determine the quality of trading cards. This quality then determines the 
value of the card.
John List recruited buyers to approach sellers and purchase baseball cards from sell-
ers who promised to deliver a “Mint” card. (In the baseball card market, there are various 
degrees of “Mint,” determined by grading services or authenticators.) The sellers in the ex-
periment were either local dealers, who frequented the card shows often and therefore had 
a reputation to uphold, or nonlocal dealers, who lived in another city and therefore rarely 
frequented the local card shows. Accordingly, they had little reputation at stake. ­After each 
transaction, the buyers secretly turned the goods over to List so that he could have the true 
grade ascertained by a licensed expert.
It is reasonable to believe that local dealers have more of a reputational concern than 
nonlocal dealers, but there might also be other important differences between them. For 
example, ­local dealers might just care more about local customers. To make sure that his 
findings were not driven by these other differences, List organized a second field experi-
ment in which he had buyers purchase sporting event ticket stubs (stubs of the tickets that 
permit you entry into a sporting event) at two different points in time. In the first instance, 
there was no professional grading service to evaluate the quality of the stubs. Directly be-
fore the second time period, a grading service had emerged to evaluate ticket stubs. Again, 
after each transaction, the buyers secretly turned their goods over to List so that he could 
have the true grade ascertained by a licensed expert. If local dealers were just different or 
cared about their customers, we should see similar behavior in the two different time in-
stances. If, on the other hand, they were motivated by reputational concerns, they should be 
much more likely to sell high-quality ticket stubs after introduction of the grading service.
Exhibit 13.14 summarizes the results of the experiments. In the first experiment, among 
the set of nonlocal sellers, fewer than 10 percent of the cards were at the level promised 
by the dealer (the leftmost bar in ­Exhibit 13.14). But at the same time, those sellers who 
did have reputational concerns provided nearly 50 percent of cards at the promised quality 
level. This is evidence consistent with the importance of reputation.
In the second field experiment, List found that before the third-party quality verification 
service was introduced, the local dealers had no qualms about selling lemons. In fact, they 
were not much better than the nonlocal dealers in the first experiment! The second two 
columns in ­Exhibit 13.14 show that only 18 percent of the ticket stubs purchased before the 
introduction of the quality service were at or above the quality level promised by the seller. 
After the introduction of the service, though, quality levels shot back up.

This exhibit shows the percent of cards sold 
at or above the quality level promised at the 
trading shows. With verification, nonlocal 
salespeople of cards only deliver at or above 
the quality they promise in 10 percent of 
the transactions. The corresponding num-
ber is much higher for local salespeople, 
presumably because they have reputational 
concerns. They deliver at or above the qual-
ity they promise in nearly 50 percent of the 
transactions. The exhibit also shows the im-
portance of quality verification: local sales-
man deliver on their promises considerably, 
more often when verification is possible.

These experiments thus show that reputational concerns are quite important. In particu-
lar, these reputational concerns made local sellers much more likely to deliver cards at the 
quality level they promised.
In terms of the trust game between you and Bernie, these results show that if Bernie 
does not have reputational concerns, he will often defect rather than cooperate, leaving you 
with the short end of the stick. On the other hand, he is much more likely to cooperate when 
he does have reputational concerns.
In this case, game theory does a good job in predicting behavior. In games when the 
second mover has little incentive, it is important for the first mover to backward-induct 
before making his or her move. Such backward induction can save a lot of money. On 
the other hand, this example illustrates that you need to understand the incentives of each 
player when constructing the relevant payoffs. If reputational concerns are important, and 
you know that to be true, your behavior is much different (and payoffs much higher) than 
when the second mover is not trustworthy.

Evidence-Based Economics (Continued) 

The data from the sports card market show that some 
sellers deliver high quality even when they have no 
reputational concerns or there is no financial incen-
tive to do so. Such behavior is in line with people tip-
ping at restaurants to which they never plan to return, 
anonymous donors giving to private charities, and some 
firms installing costly pollution abatement equipment 
voluntarily.
One reason for such deviations from Nash predictions 
is the presence of social preferences, meaning that the 
individual’s benefits are defined not only by his or her 
own payoffs but also by the payoffs of others. Social 
preferences play an important role in many economic 
interactions, and we discuss them in greater detail in 
Chapter 18.

There Is More to Life than Money
Summary
Game theory provides us with the tools to examine situations when payoffs 
are intertwined. Whether decisions are made simultaneously or sequentially, 
game theory is all about being able to see the world through the eyes of your 
opponent and understand the opponent’s incentives.
The key concepts of game theory are best responses and Nash equilibrium. 
A best response is one agent’s optimal strategy (action) taking the other player’s 
strategy as given. When the same strategy is a best response against any possible 
strategies of the other players, then it is a dominant strategy. In most games, 
players do not possess such a dominant strategy, making their best responses 
depend on the strategy choices of other players.
A Nash equilibrium arises if each player chooses a strategy that is a best 
response to the strategies of other players. Put differently, a Nash equilibrium  
is a combination of strategies that are mutual best responses.
The concept of Nash equilibrium enables us to make predictions about 
behavior in a range of situations, including those that can be modeled as the 
prisoners’ dilemma, the tragedy of the commons, and zero-sum games. It also 
helps us understand why trustworthy behavior is more likely to emerge when 
players have reputational concerns.

a biography of John Nash. There is a scene in the movie 
where the John Nash character (played by Russell Crowe) 
is at a bar with several friends and has the insight that be-
comes what we now call a Nash equilibrium. Here is a 
game that summarizes what happened in that scene. Sev-
eral women enter the bar; one of the women is very beauti-
ful. All of the men would prefer to dance with the beautiful 
woman. They know that if one man asks the beautiful 
woman to dance that she will accept, but that if two of the 
men ask her to dance, she will refuse to dance with either 
of them. The John Nash character argues that none of the

instead ask the other women. Do you think the director of

As an economist working at the Council of Economic 
Advisers, one of this book’s authors worked with the 
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to 
examine whether the dominance of a few large producers of off-
road engines increased market prices. This very question arises for 
many important industries that touch our lives daily. Consider Apple, 
and whether its pricing of e-books or its dominance of the digital 
music market with iTunes might be considered anticompetitive. 
A first thought that you might have is that because there are only 
a few competitors to Apple on the digital music front—mainly 
Google Play and Amazon.com’s MP3 store—the industry must not 
be very competitive.
Does simply counting the number of firms in an industry tell us 
whether the market is competitive? If so, then how many firms do we need to 
make a market competitive?
So far, we’ve studied two extreme market structures: perfect 
­competition, which features many firms, and monopoly, in which a single 
firm ­supplies the entire market. As useful as these models are, they do not 
provide the necessary tools to help you answer the question of how many

KEY IDEAS
Two market structures that lie between perfect competition and 
monopoly are oligopoly and monopolistic competition.
In both of these markets the seller must recognize actions of competitors.
In oligopolies, economic profits in the long run can be positive.
In monopolistically competitive markets, entry and exit drive economic 
profits to zero in the long run.
There are several important variables such as the number of firms in the 
industry, the degree of product differentiation, entry barrier, and the presence 
or absence of collusion that determine the competitiveness of a market.
firms are necessary to make a market competitive. For this task, you need 
more realistic models of market structure, which lie somewhere between 
­perfect competition and monopoly.
In this chapter, we study the two market structures that do, in fact, fall be-
tween the two extremes of perfect competition and monopoly: oligopoly and 
monopolistic competition. An important point of difference between these 
two market structures and the two extreme market types studied so far is that 
we must now consider interaction between firms. In so doing, we learn about 
the nature of competition and how prices are set within such industries. If you 
read novels, go to the movies, drink Pepsi or Coke, wear designer clothing, or 
just like to play around on your Mac that you purchased at BestBuy, you are 
already familiar with products in oligopolistic and monopolistically competitive 
industries.
This chapter will help you understand the economics underlying these indus-
tries. We will learn that in some instances, even markets with only two firms yield 
competitive outcomes. In other cases, prices that more closely approximate mo-
nopoly prices can result when only a few firms serve a market. By the end of the 
chapter, you will have acquired the economic tools to help you understand just 
how many firms it takes to make a market competitive. And, you’ll learn that much 
more than just the number of firms determines market prices and producer profits.
Every day you buy goods and services, such as books and music, from firms that do not 
naturally fit within the perfectly competitive or monopoly models. You might be thinking, 
how do Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts fit in? First, they are price-makers, so they do not 
fall into the perfectly competitive category. Second, they do not have a monopoly since 
they compete fiercely with other sellers of coffee and food products.
Coffee and tasty foods are typical examples of differentiated products, which are 
goods that are similar but are not perfect substitutes. They contrast with homogeneous 
products, which are those goods that are identical and are therefore perfect substitutes. 
Soybeans grown by different farmers are perfect substitutes; books produced by different 
authors are not.
Industries differ not only in whether or not their products are differentiated or homoge-
neous but also in the number of sellers present in the industry. Some industries will have

a few sellers, like the airline industry or cable TV carriers in your area. Other industries 
will have many sellers, like the book or music industries. A useful classification of market 
structures must therefore distinguish industries along two dimensions:
	
1.	 The number of firms supplying a given product
	
2.	 The degree of product differentiation
These distinctions lead us to introduce two more market structures, which we present in 
Exhibit 14.1.
Our first new market structure is oligopoly, which refers to a situation in which there 
are only a few suppliers of a product. As Exhibit 14.1 shows, oligopolies can feature either 
homogeneous or differentiated products. Because in oligopoly there are only a few firms, 
each firm’s profits and profit-maximizing choices depend on other firms’ actions.
Our second new market structure is monopolistic competition. That might sound like 
an oxymoron—how can a monopoly be competitive? The name reflects the basic tension 
between market power and competitive forces that exists in this market type. All firms in 
a monopolistically competitive industry face a downward-sloping demand curve, so they 
have market power and choose their own price like monopolists. These characteristics ac-
count for the first part of the name. What’s competitive about such markets is that there 
are no restrictions on entry—any number of firms can enter the industry at any time. This 
means that firms in a monopolistically competitive industry, despite having pricing power, 
make zero economic profits in the long run. As Exhibit 14.1 shows, similar to a perfectly 
competitive industry, monopolistic competition features many competing firms, but unlike 
perfect competition, the sellers produce and sell differentiated products.
As we proceed through the chapter, you may want to refer back to Exhibit 14.1, which 
outlines the similarities and differences between the four types of market structures. We 
begin with oligopoly.
Oligopoly is the market structure 
that applies when there are few 
firms competing.
Monopolistic competition is the 
market structure that applies when 
there are many competing firms and 
products are differentiated.
Exhibit 14.1 
Characteristics of Four 
Market Structures
Between the two extremes 
of perfect competition 
and monopoly, there are 
oligopoly and monopolistic 
competition. In oligopoly, 
there are only a few firms 
competing, and this could 
be in the context of either 
homogeneous or dif-
ferentiated products. In 
monopolistic competition, 
many firms sell differenti-
ated products, and each 
enjoys some degree of 
market power.
Oligopoly is a word that might strike you as rather strange. It stems from Greek origins: 
oligoi meaning “a few” and polein meaning “to sell.” Put them together and you have a 
term referring to a market structure in which there are only a few suppliers of a prod-
uct. You encounter oligopolies everywhere. As you push your cart down the soap aisle at 
the local supermarket, you may notice several different brands of bar soap—for instance,

14.2
Duopoly refers to a two-firm 
industry.
Ivory, Camay, Irish Spring, Caress, Dove, Lifebuoy, and Lever 2000. But if you look more 
closely, you will see that there are only a few suppliers—among them, Procter and Gamble, 
Colgate Palmolive, and Lever Brothers.
Oligopolies are tricky to analyze because all sorts of market outcomes can happen, 
depending on the circumstances. For instance, only three companies—Seagate, Western 
Digital, and Hitachi—control almost three-quarters of the market for computer hard drives, 
but they ruthlessly cut prices on one another, and their rivalry has driven prices very close 
to marginal cost. At the same time, luxury goods makers like Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and 
Gucci seldom get into price wars.
If you refer back to Exhibit 14.1, you will see that oligopolies can be usefully divided 
into two categories: those that sell homogeneous goods (for example, hard drives or oil) 
and those that sell differentiated goods (for example, cigarettes or soda). In this chapter, we 
discuss two models to help us understand oligopoly:
	
1.	 Oligopoly model with homogeneous (identical) products.
	
2.	 Oligopoly model with differentiated products.
The first model, oligopoly with identical products, is similar to the monopoly model, but 
one key difference is that the oligopolist must recognize the behavior of its competitors, 
whereas the monopolist does not. The second model, oligopoly with differentiated prod-
ucts, is linked to the monopolistic competition market structure with one major exception: 
entry is impeded in the oligopoly, whereas there is free entry in the monopolistically com-
petitive market.
The Oligopolist’s Problem
The oligopolist’s problem shares important similarities with the two market types dis-
cussed in previous chapters—perfect competition and monopoly. And several of the con-
cepts we have learned, such as those relating to production and cost, apply directly to the 
oligopolist’s problem. From there, the oligopolist’s problem can be described as having 
two unique features:
	
1.	 Due to cost advantages associated with the economies of scale of oligopoly or other 
barriers to entry, entry and exit will not necessarily push the market to zero eco-
nomic profits in the long run (as is the case with perfect competition and monopo-
listic competition).
	
2.	 Because of relatively few competitors, there is an important interaction between the 
few sellers that do occupy the market.
Oligopoly Model with Homogeneous Products
One of the simplest cases of oligopoly is an industry with only two competing firms—a 
duopoly. Suppose that these two firms compete against one another by setting prices. Con-
sumers observe these prices and then choose from which firm to buy. Such a model is com-
monly called Bertrand competition, after the famous French mathematician Joseph Louis 
François Bertrand, who first studied the interactions among competing firms that set prices.
To begin, let’s suppose that the industry of interest is landscaping and that there are cur-
rently two landscaping firms in the city: your company, Dogwood, and a competitor, Rose 
Petal. You both provide lawn mowing and shrubbery trimming services. In addition, because 
the local labor market conditions affect you both equally, you have the same marginal cost, 
which is $30 per landscape job (and you can perform as many jobs as you can get at this mar-
ginal cost). We’ll make one further assumption: consumers view your services as identical 
to Rose Petal’s services. This means that you and Rose Petal are selling perfect substitutes.
With only two companies, it sounds like a pretty serious oligopoly, right? We would likely 
expect both firms to have a lot of market power and therefore be able to charge a high price.
To understand how this market works, we first turn to the demand side. Customers in 
this market have a simple demand rule: they hire landscaping services from the company 
that sells at the lower price. If both landscapers charge the same price, the consumer flips a 
coin to determine which firm to choose. The simple demand rule means, in effect, that the 
landscaper charging the lower price will get all of the demand. If both companies charge 
the same price, each company will get half of the demand.

Chapter 14  |  Oligopoly and Monopolistic Competition
The final element you need to know to make your pricing decision is the market de-
mand. For simplicity, let’s say that the market has a total demand of 1,000 landscaping jobs 
per week, provided that the price is $50 or below. At any price above $50, the market de-
mand is zero (because at high prices people do their own yard work). Exhibit 14.2 presents 
the market demand curve for this situation.
What is directly relevant for a firm’s profit-maximizing decisions is not the market demand 
curve but its residual demand curve, which is the demand that is not met by other firms. 
This residual demand curve depends on the prices charged by all firms in the market. We can 
derive your residual demand curve in this case from the market demand curve as a function of 
your price PDW and Rose Petal’s price PRP. In particular, in this example it is given as
1,000, if your price is less than Rose Petal’s, or PDW < PRP;
1,000/2, if your price is equal to Rose Petal’s, or PDW = PRP;
0, if your price is more than Rose Petal’s, or PDW > PRP.
Contrasted with the market demand curve, which depends on the “market price”—the 
minimum of the prices charged in the market—the residual demand curve depends on the 
prices charged by both you and Rose Petal.
Doing the Best You Can: How Should You Price  
to Maximize Profits?
The task facing you is now clear-cut: you should choose the price that maximizes your 
profits, realizing that you will sell according to the demand structure above. How should 
you start? A first consideration is determining costs. Recall that the marginal cost is as-
sumed to be $30 per job for both you and Rose Petal.
A second consideration is to understand how your behavior affects Rose Petal’s ­behavior. 
Let’s start with some simple strategies. Say that you begin by charging a price of $50 and 
Rose Petal charges $45. What happens in this case? Because your price is higher than Rose 
Petal’s price, Rose Petal will reap all of the business, and will earn $15 above its marginal 
cost on each of the 1,000 landscaping jobs ($15 = $45 − $30).
Is this a Nash equilibrium? Remember from Chapter 13 that a Nash equilibrium occurs 
when each player chooses a strategy that is a best response to the strategies of others. Upon 
some reflection, you can see that this is not a Nash equilibrium, because given Rose Petal’s 
price, you can do better.
How? The answer is to charge a price slightly below $45; in that way, you undercut 
Rose Petal’s price. For example, if you charge a price of $44, you effectively steal the 
entire market from Rose Petal and now your company earns profits—in fact, you earn $14 
more than your marginal cost on every job ($14 = $44 − $30). We depict this situation in 
Exhibit 14.3.
The residual demand curve is the 
demand that is not met by other 
firms and depends on the prices of 
all firms in the industry.
Exhibit 14.2 Market Demand Curve 
for an Oligopoly with Homogeneous 
Products
The exhibit depicts the market demand 
curve for landscape jobs, which 
are assumed to be homogeneous. 
The market has a total demand of 
1,000 landscaping jobs per week, 
provided that the price is $50 or below. 
At any price above $50, the market 
demand is zero.

How does Rose Petal now view the situation? Because the price is above marginal cost 
MC = $30, Rose Petal views this situation in the same manner that you viewed the top por-
tion of Exhibit 14.3. So this is not a Nash equilibrium—given your pricing behavior, Rose 
Petal can do better. To do so, it can undercut you, and charge $43 per landscaping job. This 
pricing move permits Rose Petal to capture all of the market back from you. And it is now 
earning $13 above its marginal cost for every completed job.
When does all of this price-cutting end? In other words, what is the Nash equilibrium? 
Seeing this example through to the end, you will realize that the price-cutting goes on until 
we reach the unique Nash equilibrium: both firms charge a price equal to marginal cost, or 
$30 per landscaping job. That is, PDW = PRP = MC = $30 is the unique Nash equilibrium. 
In this equilibrium, each of the two companies ends up supplying half of the market, and 
because both are selling at marginal cost, they both earn zero economic profits.
To convince yourself that this is a Nash equilibrium you should ask: are there any other 
strategies that these two firms could use to make an economic profit? If not, then both firms 
are playing their best responses, and we have found a Nash equilibrium. The key observa-
tion is that, starting from PDW = PRP = MC, neither firm can increase its profits. If you 
try to charge a bit more, you sell nothing. If you cut price further, you will not cover your 
marginal cost (PDW < MC = $30), so this is not a good strategy either, because you will 
actually lose money on every landscaping job. Both your firm and Rose Petal would obvi-
ously like to make an economic profit, but if either of you raises your price above marginal 
cost by just a penny, the other will receive all of the business. So the outcome isn’t the most 
preferable outcome for you or Rose Petal, but neither of you can do better by unilaterally 
changing your price. This is the definition of a Nash equilibrium. (That this is the unique 
Nash equilibrium also follows from the argument in the previous paragraph, showing that 
no other combination of prices can be a Nash equilibrium.)
So there is a surprising conclusion to the model of an oligopoly with homogeneous 
products: in this model, firms engage in quite tough competition in trying to gain market 
share. In fact, the market outcome is the same as it would be in a perfectly competitive 
industry: price equals marginal cost in equilibrium. This competitiveness comes from the 
fact that any one firm can steal all of the market from the other by dropping price slightly. 
The strong undercutting incentive leads both firms to lower their prices to marginal cost.
This model shares similarities with the prisoners’ dilemma game that we discussed in 
Chapter 13. Even though both you and Rose Petal would be better off if you both chose a 
high price, the unique equilibrium is for each of you to choose a low price.
Oligopoly Model with Differentiated Products
So far in our discussion of oligopoly models, we have assumed that sellers are en-
gaged in competition to sell homogeneous products. Often, however, a more realistic 
description of an industry is a set of firms that make similar but not homogeneous 
products. A Boeing airliner is not the same as an Airbus, video game consoles from 
Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony are not the same, and a flight on American Airlines 
Exhibit 14.3 Dueling Duopolies  
and a Pricing Response
In a duopoly with homogeneous products, 
the best response of a firm that has a 
higher price is to undercut its rival as long 
as its rival’s price is above marginal cost 
(denoted MC = $30 in the exhibit). So in 
this exhibit, when your price is PDW = $50 
and that of Rose Petal is PRP = $45, you 
can increase your profits by cutting your 
price from $50 to PDW = $44 (which will 
­increase your sales from 0 to 1,000).

Chapter 14  |  Oligopoly and Monopolistic Competition
When there are a few firms selling 
products that aren’t the same, 
the key is to explicitly account for 
consumers’ willingness to substitute 
among the products.
Coke vs. Pepsi, an example of oligopoly with ­differentiated 
products.
is not the same as a flight on Southwest, even though these 
products are all in the same industry. Economists refer to a 
market in which multiple varieties of a common product type 
are available as a differentiated product market. When there 
are a few firms selling products that aren’t the same, the key is 
to explicitly account for consumers’ willingness to substitute 
among the products.
Therefore, this is not the “all-or-nothing” demand a firm 
faces with different prices for homogeneous products. With dif-
ferentiated products, we assume that consumers view the firms’ 
products as being somewhat distinct. As we’ll see, this differentiation helps the seller 
a lot. As we just learned, when products are homogeneous, the incentive to undercut 
price is so intense that firms drive the market price down to marginal cost, thereby earn-
ing zero economic profits. But that won’t happen here, as we’ll see in the following 
example.
To illustrate, let’s consider the soft drink industry, where there are two major ­players: 
Coca Cola and Pepsi. Because many consumers view the two companies’ products as simi-
lar, if either firm cuts its prices, it will gain market share from the other. But in this case the 
firms’ products aren’t exact substitutes (that is, they are not homogeneous goods), so the 
price-cutting company won’t take the entire market just because it prices a bit lower than 
the other firm. Some people are still going to prefer its competitor’s product, even at a 
higher price.
This means that the demand curve facing each firm includes a consideration of the 
competitor’s price. For example, if Coke raises its price, Pepsi sells more soda. Likewise, 
Coke will sell more when Pepsi raises its price. The responses of each company’s quantity 
­demanded to price changes reflect consumers’ willingness to substitute across the two prod-
ucts. But this substitution is of limited magnitude; a firm can’t take over the whole market 
with a 1¢ price cut, as in the homogeneous products case discussed earlier in the chapter.
So, how should Pepsi and Coke determine their prices? Let us highlight the main in-
tuition here. Much like any firm that we have studied thus far, the idea is to set marginal 
revenue equal to marginal cost. In this case, each firm must put itself in the other’s shoes to 
recognize how its prices will affect the prices of its competitor. For example, Pepsi execu-
tives must estimate the demand for Pepsi given every possible price for Coke. They can 
then construct their optimal price for every possible price of Coke. They must also estimate 
what price Coke is likely to set.
Coke makes the same calculations in order to figure out its best response to changes 
in Pepsi’s prices. Note that the equilibrium is determined by actions of both Pepsi and 
Coke. The relevant concept that got us to this point is once again Nash equilibrium, 
which means that both firms set their prices as best responses to each other.
We have seen that with homogeneous products, two firms competing head-to-head 
are sufficient to bring the price down to marginal cost. This is no longer true with dif-
ferentiated products. In fact, in an oligopoly with differentiated products, firms typically 
make positive economic profits, and some oligopolies persist 
in the long run with positive profits because of barriers to 
entry (for example, established brands often act as barriers 
to entry).
But what happens if there is a third firm supplying soda to 
the market? In that case, the market would continue to be an 
oligopoly, but now with three firms. In oligopoly with differ-
entiated products, price will typically be lower with three firms 
competing compared to two firms competing (this contrasts 
with oligopoly with homogeneous products where, as we just 
saw, price is equal to marginal cost even with two firms). As the 
number of firms in an oligopolistic market increases further, 
prices tend to decline toward marginal cost. If enough entry 
occurs, it could cause the market to turn into a monopolisti-
cally competitive structure. In that case, we have to turn to the 
monopolistically competitive model, which we present later in 
this chapter, to understand what would happen.

Collusion: One Way to Keep Prices High
When the government opened bidding for the Federal Communications Commission’s 
Spectrum Licenses, which allowed cellular phone companies to compete for a specified 
frequency band to provide wireless communication services in a 
particular market, several puzzling bids were put forth. US West, 
for some reason, kept submitting bids that ended in the numbers 
378, while other companies chose round figures. What is the logic 
behind this puzzling behavior?
The fact of the matter is that US West was in tight competition 
for a frequency band in Rochester, Minnesota, block 378 (a zone 
of airspace). By submitting bids that ended in 378, US West was signaling its intentions to 
competitors—in many cases, it was signaling that competitors should “stand down” and 
stop bidding on this frequency band.
The standard oligopoly models discussed so far cannot explain such puzzling behav-
ior. In order to get at the motivations behind the behavior, we must consider a model of 
­collusion. Collusion occurs when rival firms conspire among themselves to set prices or to 
control production quantities rather than let the free market determine them.
To see how collusion works, let’s return to your firm and Rose Petal—duopolists in the 
landscaping business. In the Bertrand model discussed above, we found that the Nash equi-
librium resulted in zero economic profits. One way around this zero-profits “problem” is 
to engage in collusion over prices. Imagine that over coffee you and the CEO of Rose Petal 
decide to collude by setting your prices jointly rather than independently.
How should you set prices jointly? One model of how an oligopoly might behave is for 
all the firms to coordinate and collectively act as a monopolist would act and then split the 
monopoly profits among themselves. This type of oligopoly structure makes sense on one 
level, with regard to the total profits of the industry as a whole. We know that absent price 
discrimination, monopoly profits are the highest profits that can be obtained from a given 
It’s not in the interest of one company 
to collude if the other is colluding.
Airlines have always been known for their rather cutthroat 
brand of competition. In this business, competition is 
fierce. When a new, low-price competitor called South-
west Airlines entered the industry and shook it up, econo-
mists sat back and watched the price wars begin.
In fact, economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad 
­Syverson have found in their research that price wars be-
gan well before Southwest entered the market.1 These 
economists studied the three quarters after Southwest 
announced that it would create flights but before it actu-
ally started selling tickets (so, for example, after South-
west announced it would serve Dallas-to-Chicago flights 
but before it began to sell Dallas-to-Chicago tickets). 
They found that prices were 24 percent lower in this 
three-quarter time period—before actual entry could be 
suspected as a contributing factor.
Why would airlines respond to a competitor before 
the competitor is actually competing? One reason may 
be that airlines attempt to “capture” as many consumers 
as possible. For example, by selling special frequent-flyer 
deals and luring new customers into a long-term relation-
ship, airlines may be able to compete with new entrants 
like Southwest. Before Southwest entered the market, it

was not worthwhile for airlines to offer such deals, but 
faced with new competition, the airlines might have de-
cided that enticing new customer loyalty was worth it.
Another reason why prices might have fallen before 
Southwest entered the market is because the long-term 
value of the market had decreased, making collusion 
less profitable. We discuss economic elements of col-
lusion next.

market. Therefore, jointly acting together to earn monopoly profits is the best an industry 
can do in profit terms.
That means that both your firm and Rose Petal can collude and set prices at $50 per 
landscaping job. At this price, the market demand is 1,000 jobs, and if both firms have 
the same price, half of the consumers will go to each firm; therefore both firms will make 
considerable economic profits. Accordingly, collusion is much more profitable for both of 
you than competition.
So, should we expect prices in a duopoly to always reach monopoly levels when the 
two firms can communicate and set prices jointly? There are two main reasons why we 
might be skeptical. First, even when firms agree on collusion, they have an incentive to 
disregard their agreements and engage in secret price-cutting to capture more of the profits 
for themselves. Thus, although collusion is a great deal for oligopolists, it is difficult to 
sustain. Second, as we discuss later in this section, such price-fixing is illegal. The potential 
punishment for engaging in such actions has a strong discouraging effect.
The Breakdown of Collusive Agreements  Although collusion sounds easy in 
principle—let’s both set a high price and make a lot of money—in practice, it has proven 
difficult. The logic behind its difficulty lies in game theory: each company has the incentive 
to cheat on the collusive agreement. Even if both sellers have agreed to collude, they would 
rather cheat on that agreement than keep their word.
Let’s reconsider the landscaping game to see this reasoning. Consider the situation in 
which the oligopolists are considering cheating on a collusive agreement. For example, let 
us assume that you and Rose Petal have agreed to set a high price—$50 per job. You each 
must decide whether to stick with $50 per job or cut the price, which defines a simple game. 
In fact, the situation is similar to the prisoners’ dilemma game we studied in ­Chapter 13. 
Your dominant strategy is to cheat on that agreement and secretly cut your price a little bit, 
say to $49.50 per job. Faced with a price of $49.50 from you and $50 from Rose Petal for 
this homogeneous service, all consumers will be attracted by your lower price. Therefore, 
you can take over the entire market with a slight price cut, nearly doubling your economic 
profits.
Much like confessing in the prisoners’ dilemma game in Chapter 13, cheating in this 
game is a dominant strategy for both you and Rose Petal. This means that the only equi-
librium is for you and Rose Petal to continue to cheat until you set price at marginal cost.
When Collusion Can Work  Is it possible to sustain collusion if firms recognize that 
they will be playing this game over and over rather than just once? The answer is yes. There 
are two important considerations that determine how successful a collusive arrangement is:
	
1.	 Detection and punishment of cheaters.
	
2.	 The long-term value of the market.
If another player can cheat without being detected—such as giving customers a secret price 
discount—then it is difficult to maintain collusive agreements on keeping prices high. Sell-
ers simply give secret price discounts because it is their dominant strategy to do so.
Suppose a cheater has been detected. How might he or she be punished? Consider one 
long-term strategy that you might want to adopt if you are playing the game with Rose 
Petal: I will keep my price at $50 per job provided that you also keep your price at $50 per 
job; if you ever cut your price, then I will cut my price to a very low level, say $30, forever. 
This type of strategy provides incentives for both firms to keep their prices at $50: if you 
both keep your price at that level, you will both enjoy extraordinary profits. But should 
Rose Petal cut its price, as soon as you find out about it, you price at marginal cost, or 
$30 per job forever, thus denying Rose Petal the high profits that it would have enjoyed 
with the collusive agreement. This type of punishment strategy is called a grim strategy.
A second consideration that is important to whether colluders will cheat is the long-term 
value of the market. The key is how you both trade off today’s profits against tomorrow’s 
profits. A colluder who values future monopoly profits more than current cheating profits 
will abide by the collusive agreement. In this view, impatient firms, for example those in 
danger of bankruptcy and therefore in desperate need of profits today, are more likely to 
cheat on the collusive agreement. In addition, if the government bans a product, then firms 
selling that product will know that on the last day of legal sales, no individual firm has an

player to price a good at marginal 
cost forever if the other cheats on

Section 14.2  |  Oligopoly
369
Up to this point, we have discussed models in which sell-
ers set prices. In another type of oligopoly model, sell-
ers compete on quantities rather than prices. This type 
of model is called Cournot competition, after Antoine  
Augustin Cournot, a French philosopher and mathema-
tician, who modeled duopolies focusing on quantity 
choices, rather than on price competition.
Perhaps the most famous group that chooses to col-
lude by choosing quantities is OPEC. OPEC (Organi-
zation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is an oil 
cartel that coordinates the policies of several major 
oil-producing countries. Maybe you’ve grumbled about 
OPEC as you fork over $80 to fill up the gas tank for your 
trek home for the summer holiday. Yet for all of the con-
cerns, OPEC even has a problem keeping the price of its 
good—oil—high.
This problem arises from the natural instability of collu-
sive arrangements we have just learned: each country can 
increase its profits by pumping more oil, but if they all do 
so they will depress prices, reducing everybody’s profits.
OPEC meets monthly to decide on production quo-
tas for each member. Frequently, however, the members 
choose not to abide by the agreement and subsequently 
overpump oil. And by “frequently,” we mean “pretty 
much all the time.” Take a look at Exhibit 14.4, which 
shows OPEC’s production quota agreements and its ac-
tual production from 2001 to November 2007. The blue

The blue line shows the total quota for OPEC members according to their car-

an incentive to increase its production above the quota, with reasoning similar 
to that of the prisoners’ dilemma game. As a consequence, actual production 
pretty much always exceeds the quota.

“The competitor is our friend, the customer is our enemy.”
This was the credo in the market for lysine—an addi-
tive for animal feed—during the mid-1990s, when Archer 
Daniels Midland (ADM) colluded with a number of Asian 
and European agricultural companies to inflate the price 
of lysine. This might seem like pretty small stuff, but ADM 
is an enormous corporation. It has its hand in nearly every 
dish you eat. Lysine is big business.
As hard as collusion is to prove, it might be harder to 
actually execute. As discussed above, the biggest prob-
lem is actually being able to trust your co-conspirators. 
Most economic models of collusion tend to rely on pun-
ishment. If one party reneges on its promise to sell a small 
quantity at a higher price, then presumably that party will 
have to be punished in order for collusion to stand any 
chance of working.
ADM and its co-conspirators weren’t able to punish 
each other, mostly because without a proper audit study 
it was impossible to know who was cutting prices.
In fact, on one tape capturing a meeting where prices 
were fixed, an executive suggests that an accounting firm 
be called in to actually run an audit—“Never mind the 
legal consequences,” the exec states.
No, punishment wasn’t the mechanism at work here. 
Instead, it seems that ADM and its confederates utilized 
the power of social norms. One tape captures an execu-
tive saying to his competitors, “I want to be closer to you 
than I am to any customers. They’re not my friends. You’re 
my friends.”
Every company involved tried to establish its credibility 
in this social manner, often by posturing that its competi-
tor was its friend and its customer its enemy. This mantra 
is repeatedly caught on secretly recorded tapes. To a cer-
tain extent, it’s surprising that such a simple mechanism 
was so effective. The zaniness of the entire arrangement 
was played up for comedic effect in the movie The Infor-
mant, which focused on the FBI investigation into ADM.
Even if it makes for humorous fodder now, this 
­zaniness was still profitable. Some estimates are ADM 
and its ­co-conspirators extracted millions of dollars from 
­consumers. But they eventually paid. ADM was hit by a 
record fine by the Department of Justice. 
CHOICE & CONSEQUENCE
Collusion in Practice
We now return to the final major market structure, monopolistic competition. You will 
­recall that a monopolistically competitive market features many firms offering differen-
tiated products. Once we give it some thought, we can see that goods from this type of 
market structure touch our lives daily: our morning coffee, the clothes we put on every 
morning, the bike we ride to school, our choice of restaurants for lunch, the movie we 
watch at night, and the novel we take to bed are all examples of goods supplied by monopo-
listically competitive industries.
The Monopolistic Competitor’s Problem
The monopolistic competitor’s problem shares important similarities with the problems 
of the perfect competitor in Chapters 6 and 7 and the monopolist in Chapter 12. Most im-
portantly, in the short run the mechanics of monopolistic competition are identical to the 
monopolist’s problem, whereas in the long run the equilibrium mirrors perfect competition.
To see these insights in action, let’s assume that you have just accepted a part-time 
job at Dairy Queen, where your job responsibilities include providing advice on pricing.  
­Exhibit 14.5 provides the daily residual demand curve for Dairy Queen ice cream cones—
this is the residual demand curve because it gives the demand that is not met by other pro-
ducers and thus left to be satisfied by Dairy Queen. Because Dairy Queen sells ice cream 
that is different from the several other ice cream shops in the city, the demand curve it faces 
is downward-sloping, as in Exhibit 14.5. Thus, much like a monopolist, a monopolistically 
competitive firm can increase price and not lose all of its business. In fact, the demand 
curve it faces tells us exactly the trade-off Dairy Queen faces when it changes its price. The 
marginal revenue curve, as depicted in Exhibit 14.5, is similar in shape to the monopolist’s 
marginal revenue curve.

Doing the Best You Can: How a Monopolistic Competitor 
Maximizes Profits
How should you advise Dairy Queen to maximize its profits? You may not be surprised to 
learn that the decision rule to maximize profits is identical to that for the monopolist:
Exhibit 14.5 Dairy Queen’s Demand 
Curve and Marginal Revenue Curve
The (residual) demand curve facing a 
monopolistically competitive firm is 
downward-sloping much like the demand 
curve facing the monopolist. As a result, 
the marginal revenue curve is below the 
demand curve, again just like the marginal 
revenue curve facing a monopolist.
Expand Q until
MC = MR
Produce Q* at 
that point
Trace up to the
demand curve
Find P* associated 
with Q*
Exhibit 14.6 shows how this works in practice. It depicts the demand curve, the marginal 
revenue curve, and the marginal cost curve for Dairy Queen. As a monopolistic competitor, 
Dairy Queen must figure out the quantity and price that maximizes its profits. The optimal 
quantity is found by setting marginal revenue equal to marginal cost, that is, MC = MR. To 
determine price, you trace up to the residual demand curve to see what price consumers are 
willing to pay for the quantity that you put on the market. Exhibit 14.6 reveals that Dairy 
Queen can maximize its profits by producing a quantity level of 520 ice cream cones and 
charging a price of $4.00.
The optimal decision rules are therefore:
Monopolist and Monopolistic Competitor: Set P > MR = MC.
Perfect Competitor: P = MR = MC.

Chapter 14  |  Oligopoly and Monopolistic Competition
One way in which firms can differentiate their products 
from those of other firms is to advertise. The right kind of 
advertising can lead to higher prices and higher profits 
for the monopolistically competitive firm.
In perfectly competitive markets such as the corn and 
wheat markets, there is no incentive for firms to advertise 
because they can already sell all the goods that they want 
at the market price. But a monopolistically competitive 
firm does have an incentive to advertise in order to in-
crease the demand for its product.
Let’s look at an example: many winemakers often adver-
tise the superiority of their wines. One example is Kendall-
Jackson. If its advertising is successful, consumers believe 
that Kendall-Jackson wines are superior to other wines. 
They are then willing to pay a premium for the Kendall-
Jackson wines and are less willing to substitute away from 
such wines—even if the Kendall-Jackson wines are more 
expensive but very similar to those of other winemakers. 
In this instance, Kendall-Jackson increases its economic 
profits at the expense of the consumer. It is this aspect of 
advertising—the taking advantage of the consumer—that 
constitutes one of the major arguments against advertising.
Furthermore, critics of advertising claim that advertise-
ments rarely give the public valuable information about 
the product. Instead, they present misleading situations 
that convince people that they need a product when they 
really don’t, or that a product is far superior to that of its 
competitors when it really isn’t.
In the past, the government has barred certain indus-
tries from advertising. A 1984 article in the ­American 
Economic Review by John Kwoka concluded that such 
bans on advertising in the field of optometric ser-
vices actually increased the price for the services by 
20 percent.2
Initially, this finding may seem counter intuitive—
wouldn’t optometrists, who were banned from advertis-
ing and thus did not have to shell out advertising dollars, 
be able to charge a lower price? Well, the answer is yes, 
but because consumers found it difficult to obtain infor-
mation about the optometry market without any ads to 
look at, optometrists faced lower competition and could 
get away with charging higher prices.
Furthermore, advertising can give consumers a signal 
as to the quality of the service. For example, optometry 
is a business that relies heavily on repeat customers. Ac-
cordingly, an optometrist needs repeat patients in order 
to afford advertising. Because of this, only those optom-
etrists who believe their patients will be satisfied enough 
to return after the initial visit will pay for advertising, and 
thus consumers can look to advertisements to give them 
an indication of optometrist quality.
These reasons, and the empirical evidence that shows 
a decrease in price when advertising is allowed, has led 
the government to repeal many of the advertising bans 
that had been put in place and allow firms to advertise 
their business as they see fit.
LETTING THE DATA SPEAK
Why Do Some Firms Advertise and Some Don’t?
This summary of the optimal decision rules highlights the fact that the decision concern-
ing the relationship between marginal revenue and marginal cost, which determines the 
level of production, is identical across the three market structures of perfect competition, 
monopoly, and monopolistic competition: expand production until MC = MR. The major 
difference arises with the firm in a perfectly competitive industry: it faces a perfectly elastic 
demand curve for its product, which leads to P = MR. For the monopolist and monopolis-
tic competitor, however, we have P > MR because they face a downward-sloping demand 
curve.
How a Monopolistic Competitor Calculates Profits
How much does Dairy Queen earn per day if it follows the optimal decision rule of setting 
P > MR = MC? Computing economic profits for the monopolistically competitive firm 
works exactly the same way as computing economic profits for the other three market 
structures, that is,
Profits = Total revenue − Total cost = (P × Q) − (ATC × Q) = (P − ATC) × Q.
Panel (a) of Exhibit 14.7 reveals the intuition of this calculation by superimposing the 
cost curves over the demand and marginal revenue curves. The exhibit shows that the 
level of economic profits is calculated as the area of the green-shaded rectangle, which 
equals 520 cones × ($4 − $2) = $1,040. Because average total cost is below the profit-­
maximizing price (P > ATC) at this quantity level, the firm is making positive economic 
profits.

Section 14.3  |  Monopolistic Competition
373
Similar to sellers in all market structures, economic profits are not ensured for the seller 
in a monopolistically competitive industry. Consider panel (b) of Exhibit 14.7, which is an 
example of Dairy Queen losing money. That is, because price is less than average total cost, 
there are losses for Dairy Queen. The level of losses is equal to the pink-shaded ­rectangle: 
Total revenue − Total cost = (P − ATC) × Q, which is 520 × ($4 − $6) = −$1,040.
Could the situation in panel (b) of Exhibit 14.7 be a short-run equilibrium for Dairy 
Queen? To answer this question, we consider the decision rule of whether to shut down 
or continue production in the short run. The decision rule that Dairy Queen should follow, 
when facing negative economic profits in the short run, is exactly the same as that followed 
by sellers in the other three market structures that we have studied:
	
1.	 If total revenues cover variable costs, then continue to 
produce in the short run.
	
2.	 If total revenues do not cover variable costs, then shut-
down is optimal, as you will lose less money by shut-
ting down and paying fixed costs than you would by 
operating.
You might be wondering what happens in the long run. We 
now turn to a discussion of long-run equilibrium in a monopolisti-
cally competitive industry.
Long-Run Equilibrium in a Monopolistically  
Competitive Industry
So far, the analysis has been identical to the decision problem facing a monopolist. When 
we consider what happens in the long run for a monopolistically competitive industry, 
­however, the analysis changes starkly—as noted above, from one that looks like the mo-
nopolist’s problem to one that looks like the perfect competitor’s problem. Recall that 
what’s competitive about monopolistically competitive industries is that there are no 
­restrictions on entry and exit—firms can freely enter and exit the industry at any time. What 
does this mean about the economic profits in the long run for firms in a monopolistically 
competitive industry?
Exhibit 14.7 Economic Profits and Economic Losses
In panel (a), the profit-maximizing price-quantity combination gives economic profits, 
as shown by the green rectangle. The base of this rectangle is equal to quantity, and 
its height is the distance between average total cost (ATC) and price. In panel (b), even 
at the profit-maximizing price-quantity combination, the firm incurs a loss, as shown 
by the pink rectangle. This is because average total cost is very high (due to high fixed 
costs) in this example.

Chapter 14  |  Oligopoly and Monopolistic Competition
Let’s first discuss the case of positive economic profits in the short run, which is shown 
in panel (a) of Exhibit 14.7. Is this a long-run equilibrium? No. The reason is that with 
positive economic profits, sellers will be attracted to this market. The key to understanding 
what happens in monopolistically competitive markets is to recognize what happens to the 
demand curves of the market’s existing firm(s) when another firm enters.
We know that when there are more substitutes for a good, a firm’s residual demand 
curve shifts to the left and becomes more elastic (less steep). The leftward shift implies 
that at a given price, the quantity demanded will now be less than what it was before the 
shift. The more elastic demand curve leads to a lower markup over marginal cost (recall 
the analysis of monopoly pricing in Chapter 12). To illustrate these ideas, consider the case 
of Baskin-Robbins deciding to open a store down the street from Dairy Queen. Now there 
are more substitution possibilities for consumers. Entry of another seller means that Dairy 
Queen has a residual demand curve that is flatter than what it previously faced. And be-
cause demand is being split across more firms, not only is the residual demand curve Dairy 
Queen faces flatter but it has also shifted to the left.
Exhibit 14.8 shows how the residual demand curve for Dairy Queen changes because 
of this market entry. Panel (a) of the exhibit repeats panel (a) of Exhibit 14.7 and shows 
Dairy Queen’s profit-maximizing quantity and price that we discussed earlier. Panel (b) 
shows the new demand curve juxtaposed against the old demand curve. Notice how the 
new demand curve, DNew, is both flatter than, and to the left of, DOld. The marginal revenue 
curve shifts accordingly.
Even after entry, though, Dairy Queen should continue to act as if it is a monopolist 
over its residual demand curve. Thus, its maximization problem remains the same: choose 
quantity where MR = MC, and set price using the residual demand curve. In this case, 
panel (c) of Exhibit 14.8 shows that Dairy Queen produces 450 ice cream cones per day. 
Dairy Queen’s profit-maximizing price is now $2.50, and it earns profits equal to the green-
shaded area in panel (c).
As the exhibit shows, it is still the case that Dairy Queen is earning economic profits. We 
should therefore expect more firms to enter. Each firm that enters will further shift leftward 
Dairy Queen’s residual demand curve as well as make it more elastic.
When does entry stop? Similar to a perfectly competitive industry, entry stops when 
there are no longer economic profits. This point is shown in Exhibit 14.9. At the long-run 
equilibrium, Dairy Queen sells 400 cones per day at a price of $2 per cone. Why is Dairy 
Queen’s economic profit zero in equilibrium? Because at this point price equals average 
total cost; thus, profits are zero since profits = (P − ATC) × Q = ($2 − $2) × 400 = 0. 
Dairy Queen is just covering its costs of operations (variable and fixed) at this point.
Although the end result of entry is identical to the equilibrium in a perfectly competi-
tive industry—zero economic profits—the mechanics are quite different. Recall that in a 
perfectly competitive industry, market changes operate through shifts in the market supply 
Exhibit 14.8 The Effect of Market Entry on an Existing Firm’s Demand Curve
Economic profits lead to firm entry. Firm entry shifts the residual demand curve to 
the left and makes it more elastic (panel (b)). Economic profits decrease (panel (c)). 
Entry will continue as long as economics profits remain positive.

curve (see Exhibit 6.16 in Chapter 6). In monopolistic competition, market changes occur 
because the residual demand curve becomes flatter and shifts leftward with entry.
Because entry pushes economic profits to zero in the long run, monopolistically com-
petitive firms have an incentive to continually try to distinguish themselves from rivals—in 
this way, such markets are perpetually in motion. For example, we are barraged by many 
different advertisements, commercials, and brand names, as well as a never-ending series 
of modest product innovations. Just consider how Taco Bell continually produces a “new” 
product from a different assortment of meats, beans, and cheeses. Or how Microsoft con-
tinually develops new features for Word and Excel. These “upgraded,” “improved,” and 
“new” products are all in the spirit of the ongoing pursuit of the firm to distance itself and 
its products from potential entrants. In some cases, these attempts at diversification might 
increase production costs, which also contributes to why, in long-run equilibrium, these 
firms earn zero economic profit.
Similar market dynamics would have occurred had we started with economic losses 
(panel (b) of Exhibit 14.7), where price was less than average total cost. In a market with 
free entry and exit, this situation would have induced Dairy Queen, or other ice cream 
shops, to exit the ice cream business. This is because, just as in a monopoly, oligopoly, or 
perfectly competitive market, losses in an industry cause existing sellers to seek greener 
pastures in the long run. Firm exit will cause the demand curve facing existing individual 
sellers to shift rightward and steepen (become less elastic).
Exhibit 14.9 Zero Profits in 
Long-Run Equilibrium
The long-run equilibrium in a 
monopolistically competitive 
industry is obtained when 
entry (or exit) stops at the 
point where the profit-
maximizing price is equal to 
average total cost, yielding 
zero economic profits.
As we learned in Chapter 12, one important factor that can “break” the powerful result of 
the invisible hand is market power. Compared to a competitive market, monopolists will be 
able to charge a price greater than marginal cost, thereby reducing sales and thus total sur-
plus (consumer plus producer surplus). We learned earlier in this chapter that this is also the 
case with oligopoly with differentiated products. In both market structures, firms have mar-
ket power and are able to charge prices greater than marginal cost, reducing total surplus.
What about monopolistic competition? With free entry and exit, economic profits in the 
long-run equilibrium equal zero: in good times sellers enter until all profits are exhausted, 
and in bad times sellers exit until all losses are extinguished. Such a feature is an impor-
tant determinant of whether the invisible hand can operate to ensure that selfish agents 
are maximizing the social well-being. So, does that mean that the invisible hand operates 
effectively in the monopolistically competitive case? That is, is total surplus maximized 
under monopolistic competition? The answer is no.
Exhibit 14.10 shows the intuition behind why total surplus is not maximized in a mo-
nopolistically competitive market. The key difference between the perfectly competitive in-
dustry and monopolistic competition is that the latter restricts quantity to keep price higher.

Exhibit 14.10 Equilibria for a Perfectly Competitive Market and a Monopolistically 
Competitive Market
A perfectly competitive industry produces where average total cost is minimized, 
which results in a price equaling marginal cost. There is deadweight loss in a 
­monopolistically competitive industry because production occurs at less than the 
­efficient scale—no firm can grow large enough to reach the minimum of its ATC curve 
and price is above marginal cost ­(denoted as “Markup” in the exhibit).
Panel (a) of Exhibit 14.10 depicts the equilibrium for the per-
fectly competitive industry, in which all firms are producing at 
the minimum of their average total cost curves. Thus, firms in 
a perfectly competitive market produce goods using the least 
amount of resources. This is an important implication of the in-
visible hand.
But as panel (b) of Exhibit 14.10 shows, the same does not 
happen under monopolistic competition. The fact that monopo-
listic competitors each have a downward-sloping demand curve 
causes them to act differently than a perfectly competitive seller. 
First, they produce at a level that is below the efficient scale of production (the minimum of 
the ATC curve). Second, they mark up price above its marginal cost. Both of these features 
are shown in panel (b) of Exhibit 14.10. The markup causes some buyers who are ready, 
willing, and able to purchase the good at a price at or above marginal cost to be out of 
the market. Because of this fact, there is deadweight loss, as the monopolistic competitor 
produces too little compared to the socially efficient production level. The monopolistic 
competitor does not engage in this extra production because it would then need to cut the 
price it charges other customers for its goods, resulting in lower economic profits.
Regulating Market Power
So, should the government step in and regulate oligopolistic and monopolistically competi-
tive markets? There is no straightforward answer to this question. In some cases, the an-
swer is definitely yes. But in some others, the costs of regulation may exceed the benefits.
A clear case in which government regulation is warranted is successful collusion. As we 
have seen, oligopolists may be tempted to enter into collusive agreements to increase their 
profits at the expense of consumers. One of the main roles of antitrust policy in most coun-
tries, particularly in the United States, is to prevent these types of collusive agreements.
Another strategy oligopolists use to increase their market power is to merge with their 
competitors. Mergers refer to a situation in which two companies form a single company. 
Starting from an oligopoly with two firms, the merger will lead to a monopoly and thus 
to greater market power. The cornerstones of U.S. antitrust policy, the Sherman Antitrust

Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914, are concerned with the regulation of mergers. In 
particular, the Department of Justice (DOJ) reviews merger cases and decides whether the 
main objective is to increase market power or whether there are important efficiency gains 
from such a merger.
One of the main approaches the DOJ adopts in its analysis of mergers is to calculate how 
concentrated an industry is. An industry is deemed concentrated when a few firms account 
for a large fraction of total sales in that industry. Crucially, what the DOJ looks at, and what 
economic theory suggests to be important, isn’t the number of active firms in the market, 
but how concentrated the market is (meaning whether the distribution of sales in the market 
concentrates in the hands of a few firms). When a merger stands to increase concentration 
significantly, the DOJ is less likely to allow the merger.
One of the tools that the DOJ uses to guide its enforcement of the Sherman Act is 
the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). The HHI is a measure of market concentration, 
which is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm competing in the market 
and then summing the resulting numbers (squaring is done because it gives larger firms 
greater weight). For example, if there are two firms in an industry and one firm accounts 
for 75 percent of the sales and the other 25 percent, the HHI is equal to 752 + 252 = 6,250. 
The higher the HHI, the more concentrated the industry. The HHI approaches zero when a 
market consists of a large number of firms of relatively equal size.
Even though the HHI doesn’t tell us everything about an industry, it can inform our un-
derstanding of industries. For example, take the following three industries: household laun-
dry equipment, motor vehicles, and computers. Which do you think has the highest HHI? 
The lowest? Estimates from the Department of Commerce suggest that household laundry 
equipment is the most concentrated, with an HHI of 2,855. Motor vehicles are next with an 
HHI of 2,676, and computers are the least concentrated with an HHI of 680. A general rule 
of thumb is that markets in which the HHI is less than 1,000 are considered not concen-
trated, those between 1,000 and 1,800 are considered to be moderately concentrated, and 
those in which the HHI is in excess of 1,800 are considered to be concentrated. One should 
not just rely on concentration to decide how competitive an industry is. Recall, for example, 
the lawn-mowing oligopoly discussed earlier. There, the degree of concentration was high, 
but Bertrand competition ensured that price was equal to marginal cost.
There are also limits to how effectively the government can use regulation to reduce 
market power, particularly in monopolistically competitive markets with many producers. 
Imagine if the government had to regulate prices for every product sold in monopolisti-
cally competitive industries. And imagine further that it would set the number and type 
of entrants for each product line. This type of intervention would border on a command 
economy, and there are many difficulties with that approach, as we discussed in Chapter 7.
All in all, economists favor regulation for monopolies and for highly concentrated oli-
gopolies, but are generally comfortable with permitting the more limited market power 
of monopolistically competitive firms, even though this still reduces total surplus to the 
economy. Yet, with this lost surplus comes a market structure that provides a variety of 
products, which is a good feature of monopolistic competition.
The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is 
a measure of market concentration 
to estimate the degree of 
competition within an industry.
We now have studied the four major market types. In Chapters 4–7, we focused on per-
fect competition. In Chapter 12, we studied monopolists. Between the two extreme mar-
ket ­structures—perfect competition and monopoly—are monopolistic competition and 
oligopoly. Exhibit 14.11 provides a summary of the four market structures across several 
dimensions.
As we just learned, monopolistic competition and oligopoly share many features with mo-
nopolies, including the ability to set prices. The primary difference across these three market 
structures is the number of competitors, or the number of sellers. A monopoly has only one 
seller. But monopolistic competition and oligopoly are market structures with more than one 
seller, and because of this fact, they have to concern themselves with the actions of other firms.

H
ow can we know if there are enough firms in a market to make it competitive? In 
Chapter 6, we learned that the market is perfectly competitive if there are many 
firms—so many that each can take the market price of the good that it is supplying 
as given. But we also learned in the present chapter that just two firms can be sufficient 
for the market price to be equal to the marginal cost. So how do we answer this question?
Two economists, Timothy Bresnahan and Peter Reiss, came up with a unique ­angle 
to obtain an answer.3 They reasoned that if a market is already effectively competi-
tive, the addition of one more firm should not change prices. Take another look at  
Exhibit 14.8, which shows that when existing firms have market power, the entry of 
one more firm will make the market “more competitive” and will reduce prices. In 
contrast, recall that in a perfectly competitive market, both consumers and producers 
are price-takers, and neither can influence the market price. In a perfectly competitive 
market, if the size of the market increases, there will be entry of new firms to meet the 
additional demand, but this will not reduce prices (in fact, new firms, just like existing 
firms, will be operating at the minimum point of their average total cost curve; recall 
Exhibits 7.5 and 7.6 in ­Chapter 7). In summary, when firms have significant market

power, further entry reduces prices, while in a competitive market, further entry should 
leave prices unchanged.
Bresnahan and Reiss examined the prices of tires to find out when further entry leads to 
no further price decreases. Their investigation thus answers our question of when the mar-
ket becomes effectively competitive. They obtained information on prices and the number 
of tire dealers across different towns in the western United States. To approximate markets, 
they limited the sample to 157 small towns that had at least an 80-mile round-trip to the 
next large city (if there was a large city nearby, the prices in a particular small town would 
be less relevant, because the residents of the small town could buy their tires in the nearby 
large city).
Exhibit 14.12 shows the average tire prices in different towns classified according to 
whether the towns had one, two, three, four, or five tire dealers. One major reason why 
there were different numbers of tire dealers in different towns was because the popula-
tion varied across towns. As the quality of tires could vary within the sample, the second 
row of the exhibit shows the average tire mileage rating, which is a measure of average 
tire quality. It is important to know the quality of a product because otherwise we might 
observe distinct prices not due to differences in market power, but simply due to differ-
ences in quality.
Exhibit 14.12 shows a remarkable pattern. There is practically no difference in prices 
between markets with four and five tire dealers. In fact, Bresnahan and Reiss show that the 
price difference between markets with three and four dealers is mostly due to the differ-
ences in the tire mileage ratings; that is, the average quality of tires appears to be higher in 
towns with three dealers. Once this difference in tire quality is accounted for, there is no 
evidence that prices are different between markets with three or four dealers. In sum, the 
evidence from the Bresnahan and Reiss study suggests that three or four firms are sufficient 
for the tire market to be (effectively) competitive.
At this point, you may be wondering if towns with different numbers of tire dealers 
were systematically different along other dimensions. If so, the comparison of prices across 
towns could be contaminated by such differences. One way of dealing with this problem 
is to investigate the same question with a laboratory experiment, where such confounding 
differences will not arise. 
Two economists, Martin Dufwenberg and Uri Gneezy, did just that.4 They designed an 
experiment in which a number of sellers each chose a bid (selling price) between 2 and 100. 
Whichever seller made the lowest bid (set the lowest price) kept the dollar amount equal 
to his or her bid. You may notice the similarity between this experiment and the oligopoly 
model with homogeneous products. When there are two sellers, this is exactly identical to 
the duopoly model we studied. Our analysis in that case suggested that each seller should 
engage in cutthroat competition and bid “2.”
Exhibit 14.12 Tire Prices and Tire Quality in Selected U.S. Towns
Prices with four or five dealers are virtually the same. With three dealers, prices 
are higher, but this mostly reflects the higher tire ­mileage rating in these markets. 
Overall, there is relatively little ­variation in prices in markets with three, four, or five 
dealers, suggesting that competition between three or four dealers is sufficient for 
the tire market to be effectively competitive.

You might also reason, though, that in a duopoly you are playing against just one other 
seller, and you may try to go for a higher bid and take home more money if you happen 
to have the lower bid. Dufwenberg and Gneezy, in fact, found that in a duopoly, average 
bids were just below 50, so the experiment does not mirror the theory. However, when 
the number of sellers increased to four, the sellers acted much more competitively. In 
fact, with four sellers, the average winning bid at the end of ten rounds of play was close 
to two! Thus, in the lab too, it appears that four competitors are sufficient to drive the 
equilibrium toward the competitive outcome. As economic theory predicts, prices depend 
on the fierceness of competition, and the empirical research suggests that the number of 
competitors does not have to be very large to bring prices very close to the competitive 
level. Interestingly, this research shows that even in markets with a large HHI, intense 
competition can be observed.
Although this empirical evidence suggests that four is an important number, we should 
take great care not to overgeneralize this point. It might be the case that in other industries 
or in other cities (or in other experiments), it takes many more or fewer firms to generate 
a competitive market. In the end, economic theory and empirical insights can inform us of 
general principles, such as when and where to expect anticompetitive pricing, and when to 
suspect that it is having an important influence. But statements on the actual existence, or 
effectiveness, of anticompetitive arrangements are quite difficult to make without actually 
investigating the industry itself.

Summary
Oligopoly and monopolistic competition are two market structures that 
lie between the market extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. Firms 
in these market structures must consider the behavior of competitors, whereas 
neither a monopolist nor firms in a perfectly competitive industry need do so.
There’s no single model of oligopoly that is applicable to every situation. 
The equilibrium outcome will depend on the unique features of the market—
whether the goods are homogeneous or differentiated, how many firms are in 
the industry, and whether collusion is sustainable. Nevertheless, there are some 
important general lessons from the study of oligopoly. Economic profits of firms 
will be higher when goods are differentiated, when there are fewer firms in the 
industry (unless the goods are in fact homogeneous), and when collusion is 
sustainable.
In the short run, behavior of the monopolistic competitor and the monopolist 
are identical: Set Price > Marginal Revenue = Marginal Cost. In the long run, 
entry and exit cause the equilibrium in a monopolistically competitive industry—
zero economic profits—to be identical to equilibrium in perfect competition.
Economics provides a useful set of tools to begin a discussion of whether a 
market is competitive, but there is no one factor—such as the number of firms—
that wholly dictates the nature of competition within a specific industry.

monly called the “luxury tax” on themselves. A team is 
subject to the tax if its payroll exceeds a specified level. 
The annual threshold for the luxury tax is $189 million 
for 2014–16. A team that exceeds the threshold must pay 
17.5% to 50% of the amount by which its payroll is above 
the threshold, where the “tax rate” depends on the num-
ber of years the team is over. This question looks at why 
teams might subject themselves to this tax.
	
a.	 Suppose there are two major league baseball teams, 
Team 1 and Team 2. They will both choose to offer ei-
ther high salaries to players or low salaries. They will 
make their decisions simultaneously. If both choose low 
each will earn $0; if both choose high each will earn 
$400. If one chooses high and the other chooses low, the 
team that chooses high will attract the best players and 
will earn $600, but the team that chooses low will earn 
just $300. Show that high is a dominant strategy but that 
both teams would be better off if both chose low.
	
b.	 Under a 1922 Supreme Court decision, major league 
baseball is not subject to many antitrust laws. Suppose

c.	 Some people might argue that the luxury tax in base-
ball is not ans important determinant of major league 
salaries. As evidence, they show that team payrolls 
rarely exceed the threshold level and so teams rarely 
pay the tax. What does you answer to this question

cerned that the other party will do the same, which may 
defeat the purpose of reducing the price. If both cinemas 
lower the price, both will earn $1,600 per day. If both 
cinemas maintain the price, both will earn $2,000 per day. 
If one cinema reduces the price while the other maintains 
the price, the cinema that reduces price will earn $3,000 
per day and the one that maintain the price will earn $800 
per day.

People care about the timing of experiences. They usually prefer 
to postpone unpleasant experiences such as writing a term 
paper, working on a problem set, reading a textbook, quitting 
smoking, or following a diet. Likewise, people usually like 
to experience pleasant things immediately, like watching a 
YouTube video or eating a candy bar. In this chapter we show 
you how the timing of a reward affects its economic value.
Do people exhibit a

KEY IDEAS
Interest is the payment received for temporarily giving up the use of 
money.
Economists have developed tools to calculate the present value of 
payments received at different points in the future.
Economists have developed tools to calculate the value of risky 
payments. 
Most decisions have costs and benefits that occur at different times. Consider going to col-
lege. Lots of college costs come now—hard work, foregone wages (opportunity cost), and 
tuition payments. On the other hand, many of the economic benefits from a college educa-
tion come later in life, especially higher wages. If someone is going to make an optimal 
choice about whether or not to get a college degree, they’ll need to somehow put all of the 
costs and benefits into comparable units and add them up.
Other activities are also associated with up-front costs and delayed benefits: for instance, 
exercising, dieting, and saving. To analyze choices like these, we need to understand how 
to predict and value the delayed benefits. Is it optimal to invest a dollar today, so that I can 
consume the dollar and all of the interest I’ve earned on it when I retire decades later?
This chapter also discusses how risk affects economic value. To an economist, risk is 
not a four-letter word—risky options are not necessarily bad options. Risk just means that 
some of the costs and benefits are not fixed in advance. For example, when you marry 
someone, you recognize that the success of the marriage is not completely predictable.  
A person’s income, health, and even tastes can change. During a wedding ceremony cou-
ples acknowledge some of these risks when they vow “to have and to hold from this day 
forward; for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health.”
In general, almost all investments have risky returns. How will 
the stock market perform? How will housing prices change? Will the 
­degree that you are earning in college turn out to be valuable, or will 
employers look for different skills in the future? In this chapter, we use 
economic analysis to evaluate these risks.
The tools that economists use to value delayed rewards have much 
in common with the tools that we use to value risky rewards. In both 
cases, economists weight rewards. When economists value rewards 
that will be experienced in the future, we multiply the reward by a 
positive factor that is less than 1 to capture the idea that future re-
wards are worth less than current rewards. When a reward might not 
occur, economists incorporate this risk by multiplying the reward by 
the positive probability (again, less than 1) that the reward will occur. 
This chapter explains how these time- and risk-weighting factors are 
determined and shows you how to use them.

Financial markets enable people to transfer money through time. For example, to move 
money into the future, depositors “lend” money to a bank now and then withdraw it, with 
interest, at a future date.
Economists call such a change an intertemporal transformation. “Inter” means ­between—
for instance, when you travel between countries you are travelling internationally. “Tempo-
ral” refers to time. Intertemporal transformations move resources ­between time periods.
Future Value and the Compounding of Interest
The key variable that summarizes an intertemporal transformation of money is the interest 
payment. Let’s consider a simple example. Imagine that you deposit $100 in a bank account. 
The amount of an original investment—in this case $100—is referred to as ­principal. How 
much money will you have in the account after 1 year, assuming that the account pays an 
annual interest rate of r? The bank account contains your principal of $100 plus interest of 
r × $100. 
For example, if the interest rate is 5 percent, then the interest rate will be
r = 5% = 5
100 = 0.05.
For a 5 percent interest rate and a $100 deposit, the 1-year interest payment would be  
0.05 × $100 = $5. The total value of the account at the end of a year can then be written:
$100 + (r × $100) = (1 + r) × $100.
This is the sum of the principal and the interest and it is referred to as the future value after 
1 year of accumulation.
Suppose that you decide to leave all of your money—principal plus interest—on deposit 
at the end of the first year. Your account balance at the beginning of Year 2 is (1 + r) × $100. 
Let’s call this “Balance.” During Year 2 you will receive interest on the balance from the end 
of Year 1, or interest of (r) × (Balance). At the end of Year 2 your account will contain the 
amount that you had in the account at the end of Year 1, which is what we called Balance, 
plus the interest that you received in Year 2,
(Balance) + (r) × (Balance) = (1 + r) × (Balance).
Since the Balance from the end of Year 1 was (1 + r) × $100, the amount at the end of 
Year 2 is
(1 + r) × Balance = (1 + r) × (1 + r) × $100 = (1 + r)2 × $100.
Do you notice a pattern? If you left your money at the bank for 1 year, you would get 
this much back at the end of Year 1:
(1 + r) × $100.
If you left your money at the bank for 2 years, you would get this much back at the end of 
Year 2:
(1 + r)2 × $100.
For each extra year that you leave your money at the bank, you can multiply your final 
balance by an additional factor of (1 + r). Consequently, if you leave your money with the 
bank for T years, you would get this much back at the end of year T:
Future value = (1 + r)T × (Principal)            Compound Interest Equation
This is called the compound interest equation or the future value equation. In this 
equation, r is the interest rate and T is the number of years that the investment lasts. To 
derive the compound interest equation we assume that none of your interest payments are

Principal is the amount of an 
original investment.
Interest is the payment received 
for temporarily giving up the use of 
money. 
The sum of principal and interest is 
referred to as future value.  
The compound interest equation or 
future value equation calculates the 
future value of an investment with 
interest rate r that leaves all interest 
payments in the account until the 
final withdrawal in year T.

being withdrawn along the way. Accordingly, you earn interest on past interest payments, 
because all of the earlier interest payments remain in the account until the final withdrawal 
in year T. To capture the idea of earning interest on interest, economists say that the interest 
is compounding.
The compound interest equation has some remarkable properties. Notice that the equa-
tion has an exponential term, (1 + r)T, with exponent T. This implies that the balance of 
your account grows multiplicatively each year. In other words, each year the account in-
creases by the multiplicative factor (1 + r).
Such compound growth is very powerful, which is convenient if you are trying to save 
for college tuition, build up a large nest egg for retirement, or prepare for any number of 
future financial goals. To see the power of compound growth, it helps to think about a few 
examples. Suppose you put $1 into an account at age 20, and let the money compound 
(without touching it) until you retire at age 70. In this example, the duration of the invest-
ment is 70 − 20 = 50 years, so T = 50. We want to know how much money you’ll have in 
this account at the end of that 50-year period.
Let’s begin by considering a very special case in which r = 0.00. When the interest rate 
is exactly 0, your final balance will be:
(1 + r)T × $1 = (1 + 0.00)50 × $1 = 150 × $1 = $1.
Because 150 = 1, you emerge with $1 at the end of your 50-year wait. You’ve earned no 
interest and your final withdrawal, $1, is exactly equal to your principal, $1.
Let’s now consider some other interest rates. Here’s where things get funky. Exhibit 15.1 
plots the function (1 + r)T for a range of interest rates. The figure shows the value of your 
balance as your age ranges from 20 to 70. Specifically, we consider r = 2%, r = 4%, 
r = 6%, r = 8%, and r = 10%. Now something extraordinary happens. If the interest rate is  
2 percent, your $1 of principal grows to $2.69. In other words, your money nearly triples 
over 50 years. That’s not bad.
But what if the interest rate is 10 percent? Then your deposit grows to $117.39. That’s 
not a typo. Your $1 deposit grows 117 times as large over 50 years. Since the future value 
is (1 + r)T × (Principal), the growth factor is the same whether the original principal is  
$1 or $1,000. So a $1,000 original deposit would grow to about $117,390. Compound 
growth can be very powerful. Saving when you are young—and letting the interest 
­compound—reaps enormous benefits when you are old.
How to do it: The compound 
interest equation includes the 
expression (1 + r)T. Use the financial 
calculator available on MyEconLab 
to evaluate this expression for 
any interest rate r, and any 
time horizon T. Most hand-held 
calculators also have an exponent 
function that multiplies a number by 
itself T times.
Exhibit 15.1 Value of a $1 Investment over the Next 50 Years
Each line plots the value of $1 invested at a constant interest rate r for T years. For 
example, after 50 years of compound growth, $1 of principal invested at an interest 
rate of 8 percent has a future value of $1 3 (1 1 0.08)50 5 $46.90. For large interest 
rates, compound growth generates explosive returns.

Let’s again consider the case of $1 of principal and split the $117.39 
final account value into (1) principal and (2) interest. When the bank 
pays you at the end of 50 years, $1 is repayment of principal, so the 
remaining $116.39 is the payment of interest. In this case, the interest 
payment greatly exceeds the repayment of principal. Recall that the 
interest payment is what the bank pays you over and above your prin-
cipal, for the privilege of using your money.
Borrowing Versus Lending
Interest payments come in two basic categories, depending on whether 
you are a lender or a borrower. We have already discussed the inter-
est that you receive from a bank as a depositor. On the other hand, 
you make interest payments to the bank if you borrow money from the 
bank—for instance, by carrying debt on your bank-issued credit card or 
by obtaining a home mortgage from the bank.
Making a deposit effectively transfers spending from the present to 
the future. You deposit money now and you withdraw it (with interest) 
in the future. When you borrow from the bank you generate the 
opposite direction of time travel. If you anticipate having money in 
the future, but you want to spend it now, you borrow. Accordingly, 
borrowing enables you to spend future income today. Exhibit 15.2 
summarizes visually how lending and borrowing affect the timing 
of your spending.
Interest on a deposit and interest on a loan work the same way. 
With a deposit, you receive
(1 + r)T × (Principal amount)
when you withdraw the money, with interest, in T years. With a loan, you pay
(1 + r)T × (Loan amount)
when you pay back the loan, with interest, in T years (assuming, in this example, that no 
periodic interest payments are made along the way). Note that both expressions have the 
same multiplicative factor, (1 + r)T. Consequently, we can use the plots in Exhibit 15.1 to 
Saving money when young reaps returns when  
old. Most working households should save  
10 to 20 percent of their pre-tax income.
Borrowing enables you to spend 
­future income today.

calculate the payments associated with compounding deposits or compounding loans. The 
mathematical equations are exactly the same in both cases.
There is one difference, however, between loans and deposits that we should highlight. 
Typical interest rates on loans tend to be higher than typical interest rates paid on invest-
ments. For example, it is not uncommon to borrow at 15 percent interest or even 20 percent 
interest on a credit card. Such high interest rates can produce enormous repayments. By 
way of illustration, consider a 50-year loan of $1,000 at a 15 percent interest rate. Suppose 
that no payments were made until year 50, so the loan was compounding for 50 years. For 
this scenario, the amount due after 50 years would be:
(1 + 0.15)50 × $1,000 = $1,083,657.44.
That’s over 1 million dollars due after 50 years of compound interest!
In practice, such enormous repayments almost never occur on a $1,000 loan. No bank 
would let you wait 50 years to repay your credit card debt. The bank anticipates that a borrower 
with 1 million dollars due is more likely to declare bankruptcy than to repay. So the banks 
don’t wait 50 years to get their money back. They’ll require interest payments along the way.
Consequently, when thinking about loans it is helpful to consider time horizons that are 
much shorter than 50 years. A 1 year, $1,000 loan at a 15 percent rate of interest will cost 
the borrower $150 in interest.
Present Value and Discounting
Suppose someone asked you to lend them money to help fund the construction of a strip mall.
“You lend me $10,000, and I will repay you $20,000 in 20 years.”
Assume that you have good reasons to trust this person and you can rely on him to repay 
your money with certainty. So you are confident that this is a risk-free loan. Even with that 
confidence, it’s still not clear if you should take him up on his offer.
In such a situation, an economist would ask you what alternative use you could make 
of your $10,000. (To keep things simple, we’ll focus on alternative uses that are also risk-
free.) In other words, an economist thinks about opportunity cost. What is the next best 
investment that you could make with your $10,000 of principal?
Suppose that you have another risk-free investment option that will pay 5 percent inter-
est. So you face a choice. Do you participate in the strip mall project, or do you take the 
alternative project with the 5 percent return?
To compare these projects, you could ask, “If I have access to an investment with a  
5 percent return, how much money would I need today to produce $20,000 20 years from 
now?” We can express this question as a mathematical equation that is similar to the equa-
tions that we have already been studying in this chapter:
(1 + 0.05)20 × $x = $20,000.
In this equation, $x is the amount of money that you would need right now to generate 
$20,000 in 20 years, assuming that you have access to an investment that will provide an 
annual return of 5 percent. To solve for x, we just divide both sides by (1 + 0.05)20 to find
x = $20,000
(1.05)20 = $7,538.
In this case, x = $7,538. You could take $7,538 right now, invest it in a project that has a  
5 percent return, and it will deliver $20,000 in 20 years. Consequently, $20,000 in 20 years 
is worth $7,538 to you right now.
The variable x is the present value of $20,000 in 20 years, or in this case, the present value of 
the strip mall project. The present value of a future payment is the amount of money that would 
need to be invested today to produce that future payment. Economists say that the present value 
is the discounted value of the future payment. Economists invoke discounting because of the 
form that the present value equation takes.
Present value = Payment T periods from now
(1 + r)T
        Present Value Equation
The present value of a future 
payment is the amount of money 
that would need to be invested 
today to produce that future 
payment. In other words, the 
present value is the discounted 
value of the future payment.

15.2
Note that (1 + interest rate) is greater than 1, so multiplying it  
by itself T times yields an expression (1 + r)T that is also greater 
than 1. Therefore, in the present value equation the future 
­payment—the payment T periods from now—is divided by a de-
nominator that is greater than 1. In other words, the future pay-
ment is discounted to calculate the present value.
It is useful to remember that discounting brings back money to 
the present (present value) and involves division, whereas com-
pounding takes present money into the future (future value) and 
involves multiplication.
It is helpful to write the present value equation in a slightly different form.
Present value = c
1
11 + r2T d * (Payment T periods from now).
This version of the equation is mathematically identical to the previous version, but this 
second version emphasizes that we are multiplying the future payment by a factor that is 
less than 1. That factor is the ratio in the square brackets.
One can see that the strip mall project is a bad deal the instant you calculate that its present 
value is only $7,538. You don’t need an economist to tell you that you should not pay $10,000—
which is the present cost of buying into the strip mall project—for something that is only worth 
$7,538. Economists say that this project has a negative net present value, because the up-front 
cost of $10,000 exceeds $7,538, which is the discounted value of the delayed benefits. The net 
present value of a project is the present value of the benefits minus the present value of the costs.
(Present value of the benefits) − (Present value of the costs) = Net present value.
For our example, the net present value is
$7,538 − $10,000 = −$2,462.
A positive net present value represents a “go” decision for a project; a negative net present 
value represents a “no-go.”
The present value concepts are useful tools, because many economic opportunities 
­generate complex streams of future payments. We can now collapse all of those future 
­payments to a single number—the net present value of the project.
To further illustrate the concept of net present value, consider another investment 
­opportunity. Pay $10,000 today. In return, you’ll receive two future payments: $10,000 in 
10 years and $10,000 in 15 years. Is this a good deal? Once again, we can use the present 
value equation to answer this question. We’ll use a 5 percent rate of interest.
First, let’s calculate the present value of $10,000 in 10 years.
Present value of $10,000 in 10 years = $10,000
(1.05)10 = $6,139. 
Then, let’s calculate the present value of $10,000 in 15 years.
Present value of $10,000 in 15 years = $10,000
(1.05)15 = $4,810. 
These two present values sum up to
$6,139 + $4,810 = $10,949.
So this project is a good deal. You pay $10,000 today for a project with a present value of 
$10,949. In other words, the net present value of the project is positive:
(Present value of the benefits) − (Present value of the costs) = Net present value
$10,949 − $10,000 = +$949.
Discounting brings back money to the 
present (present value) and involves 
division; compounding takes present 
money into the future (future value) 
and involves multiplication.
The net present value of a project 
is the present value of the benefits 
minus the present value of the costs.

Net present value is one of the most important tools in economics and is universally used 
by businesses and governments to decide which projects to implement. In the exercises at 
the end of this chapter, you’ll get more practice applying this concept.
We just showed you how to discount future monetary payments to calculate a present 
value. We can also discount other future activities. For example, people discount future 
pleasures—like massages or donuts—when these goods are compared to other pleasures 
that are available right now.
To illustrate this idea, suppose you were asked to choose between a 60-minute massage 
in a year or a 50-minute massage right now. Which one would you take? Most people prefer 
the shorter, earlier massage. This reflects an important principle: people want pleasurable 
events to occur sooner rather than later. We will now show you how economic models re-
flect this preference for earlier rewards.
Time Discounting
Suppose there is some future activity that will generate pleasure or some other form of 
well-being. Suppose that this benefit is not money—for ­instance, the pleasure of getting a 
massage. Economists refer to general well-being as utility. To make future utility compa-
rable to current utility, we need to multiply the future utility by a factor that is less than 1. 
In general, this won’t be exactly the same factor that we use with monetary payments. 
However, both the factors that multiplicatively discount future monetary payments and the 
factors that multiplicatively discount future utility are less than 1. Stuff that comes in the 
future is worth less than stuff that comes right now.
To make these ideas concrete, suppose that an hour-long massage generates 
60 units of utility—one util for every minute the massage lasts. A util is a single 
unit of utility. Suppose that people discount utility that will occur one year from 
now by multiplying those future utils by 1⁄2. A multiplicative weight (between 0 
and 1) is called a discount weight—a discount weight multiplies delayed utils to 
translate them into current utils. Using a discount weight of 1⁄2, we can determine 
whether a person prefers 50 current utils (from a 50-minute massage) or 60 utils 
in a year (from a 60-minute massage). In this example, the 60 future utils have a 
discounted value of:
a 1
2b(60 utils in a year) = 30 current utils.
We now have the answer. If a person discounts delayed utils with a weight of 1/2, then she 
prefers 50 utils right now to 60 utils in a year’s time. In present value, the 60 ­delayed utils 
are only worth 30 utils now. Discount weights enable us to compare delayed utils and im-
mediate utils, helping us identify the preferred option. Once we know your discount weight 
for a particular time horizon—the psychological value that you place on a delayed util—we 
can predict the intertemporal trade-offs that you will make.
Here’s another example that illustrates these ideas. Suppose you are considering whether 
or not to eat a hot fudge sundae. Assume that the sundae offers immediate pleasures of 
6 utils and delayed costs of 8 utils. The delayed costs would include things like reduced 
health and fitness.
First, let’s imagine that you did not discount the future, so that your discount weight 
on future utils is 1. Then you would skip the hot fudge sundae, since the costs exceed the 
benefits.
Benefit − Cost = Net benefits
  6 − 8 = −2.
Since the net benefit is negative, you decide not to eat the sundae.
Time Preferences
15.3 
Utility in economics is a measure of 
satisfaction or happiness that comes 
from consuming a good or service.
Utils are individual units of utility.
A discount weight multiplies delayed 
utils to translate them into current utils.

Suppose instead that you do discount the future. Then, it’s not obvious what you would 
do. For example, if your discount weight were 1⁄2, then
(Immediate benefit) − (Discounted value of delayed cost) = 6 – (1
2)8 = +2.
This calculation implies that you would eat the sundae, since the net benefit is positive.
Now suppose that you care a bit more about the future. Suppose that you discount the 
future with a weight of 7⁄8. In other words, we are now assuming that a util in the future is 
worth 7⁄8 as much as a util today. Then,
(Immediate benefit) − (Discounted value of delayed cost) = 6 − (7
8)8 = −1.
With a discount weight of 7⁄8, the delayed discounted cost is  
(7⁄8)8 = 7. This is high enough to exceed the immediate benefit of 
eating the sundae, which is 6. Since 7 > 6, you decide to forego 
the sundae.
These examples illustrate an important general principle. The 
greater your discount weight—in other words, the more highly 
you weight things that happen in the future—the more your cur-
rent decisions are driven by the future consequences of those 
decisions.
Preference Reversals
Let’s now enrich our sundae example by thinking about the way that you discount over 
several days. Suppose that you discount in the following special way. You place full weight 
on the present and half weight on all future days.
 
Today
Tomorrow
The Day After Tomorrow
Weight:
1
1
2 
1
2 
This is a slightly odd pattern of weights. It implies that you psychologically draw a sharp 
distinction between now and all later periods. To you, what really matters is whether a 
reward comes now (today) or later. Note that the weight you put on tomorrow is the same 
as the weight you put on the day after tomorrow. For you, all of the future days are roughly 
alike. It is today that is special. We call this type of preference pattern present bias.
Let’s again think about your preferences for eating ice cream. Today, you are happy 
to eat the ice cream, because the immediate benefit exceeds the discounted value of the 
delayed cost:
(Immediate benefit) − (Discounted value of delayed cost) = 6 − (1
2)8 = +2.
Suppose however, that the ice cream parlor is unexpectedly closed today. Your friend asks 
you if you’d like to come back tomorrow. What is your answer?
From today’s perspective, both tomorrow and the day after tomorrow have the same 
weight of 1/2. From today’s perspective, the value of eating ice cream tomorrow is:
(Discounted value of delayed benefit) − (Discounted value of delayed cost)  
= (1
2)6 − (1
2)8 = −1.
Because the discounted net benefit is negative, you decide not to eat ice cream tomorrow.
This preference pattern is an example of a preference reversal. You decided that you 
wanted to eat ice cream today. But you also decided that you do not want to eat ice 
cream tomorrow. Of course, this is not entirely consistent. Once the sun rises tomorrow 
morning, it will once again be like today and you’ll once again want to eat ice cream.  
If you are always planning to stop eating ice cream tomorrow, when will your diet actu-
ally begin?
The more highly you weight things 
that happen in the future the more 
your current decisions are driven by 
the future consequences of those 
decisions.

Preference reversals arise from discount weights like the ones described above. Specifi-
cally, those discount weights imply that today gets much more weight than tomorrow, but 
tomorrow and the day after tomorrow receive the same (or nearly the same) weight. There 
are also discount weights that do not generate preference reversals.
Most economists do not have a view on what discount weights you should have. In-
stead, we believe that discount weights reflect your tastes. If you sharply devalue things 
that occur in the future, you have low future discount weights. If you care about the future 
as much as the present, you have future discount weights that are close to 1. Economists 
are interested in measuring people’s discount weights. Knowing how consumers discount 
the future helps economists predict people’s choices and design public policies that suit 
people’s preferences for intertemporal trade-offs.

ucky you. You have just been approached by a market tester taking orders for free 
snacks. Here is the list of options: apple, banana, potato chips, Mars bar, Snickers 
bar, or borrelnoten. (You happen to be Dutch, so you know that borrelnoten is a 
popular salty snack in the Netherlands.)
Order the snack you want today and the market tester will return in a week to bring 
you whatever you chose. Which free snack would you select now to eat next week? 
Pause for a moment and think about it before continuing.
One week later, the market tester returns and tells you that what you chose a week 
ago does not matter after all. Instead, you can choose whatever you want from the origi-
nal list of snacks regardless of what you previously ordered. Do you think you would 
pick the same snack that you chose a week ago? Or would you switch? If you switched, 
how do you think your choice might change now that you are going to immediately eat 
whatever you choose?
When Dutch workers were asked to order a snack one week in advance, 74 percent 
asked for a healthy snack: bananas or apples.1 However, when the researchers came

Q: Do people exhibit a preference for immediate gratification?
There is nothing necessarily irrational about a preference 
reversal such as those that we have discussed. However, 
it is not rational to mispredict those preference changes. 
For example, if you join an expensive gym expecting to 
exercise twice a week for the next year but you never ac-
tually exercise, that’s a forecasting error. Your forecast is 
irrational if you keep mistakenly believing that you are 
going to start exercising in the near future. At some point, 
you need to admit to yourself that you are not going to 
use the gym so you can then cancel your membership.
Rational people will correctly anticipate their own future 
behavior. For example, if you are never going to exercise, 
then you should not pay for a gym membership in the first 
place. Or maybe you should find a way to force yourself 
to exercise—perhaps by making a commitment to meet a 
friend at the gym. To make optimal choices, we need to 
correctly anticipate our own future behavior. Basing your 
forecast on your current preference for future behavior is 
not necessarily rational. You need to base your forecast 
on the preferences that you will hold when the moment 
to act actually arrives. It’s easy to intend to write your term 
paper tomorrow. It’s easy to intend to exercise tomorrow. 
It’s easy to intend to eat healthfully tomorrow. Do your 
good intentions match your actions?

15.4
We’ve completed our discussion of how time affects the value of economic goods and ser-
vices. We now turn to our other major topic in this chapter: risk.
To an economist, risk exists when outcomes are not known with certainty in advance. 
Risk can even exist if all of the outcomes are “good” outcomes. For example, if you are a 
contestant on a game show and you will win either $500 or $5,000 (and have no chance of 
going home empty-handed), it is still the case that your outcome is risky. If something is 
risky, then it is said to have a component that is random.
Roulette Wheels and Probabilities
To understand risk, it is useful to start by thinking about a roulette wheel. In an American 
casino, a roulette wheel has 38 equal-sized pockets. The person in charge of a roulette 
wheel is called the croupier. The croupier spins a small white ball around the outer circum-
ference of the roulette wheel. The ball eventually slows down and falls into the center of

consumption, only 30 percent of the workers chose fruit. On average, subjects exhibited 
a preference reversal. Asked ahead of time they ordered something healthy. But when the 
moment of truth arrived, many subjects switched their priorities and went for the salty 
snack or the candy.
People exhibit many kinds of preference reversals. On Sunday night, students decide 
to get to the library early on Monday morning. On Monday morning, students sleep in. 
Would-be exercisers pay for gym memberships with good intentions. But it turns out that 
it’s never the right time to ­exercise, and visits fall short of expectations. Dieters have 
good intentions about what they will eat later in the day. But when the dessert cart arrives, 
the diet is postponed until the next day. People choose hard work, exercise, and healthy 
snacks for their future selves. But they want immediate gratification for the present. This 
leads to a pattern of preference reversals, as patient plans for the future are often over-
turned when the future arrives.

the wheel. The ball bounces around the center of the wheel, eventually coming 
to rest in one of the 38 pockets.
If a roulette wheel is not rigged by the casino—there are laws against that—
there is a 1-in-38 chance that the ball will land in any particular pocket. Without 
getting too philosophical, let’s analyze what this statement means and how we 
can use roulette wheels to understand most of what you need to know about risk.
To make our discussion easier, imagine a different, hypothetical roulette 
wheel with 100 pockets, labeled from 1 to 100. Suppose we spun our new wheel 
once. What is the chance that you will win if you bet on the number 79 (and no 
other number)? The answer is 1 in 100.
Likelihood of winning if you bet on a single number =
1
100 = 0.01 = 1%.
Suppose instead that you bet on both the numbers 79 and 16? What is the 
chance you will win in this scenario? There are now two ways to win—either by 
spinning 79 or 16. So the likelihood of winning is 2 in 100.
Likelihood of winning if you bet on two numbers =
2
100 = 0.02 = 2%.
You can see the pattern here. Now suppose that you have bets on the following 10 dif-
ferent numbers: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, and 100. What is the chance of winning? 
You have 10 ways to win, and there are 100 possible outcomes. So the likelihood of win-
ning is 10 in 100.
Likelihood of winning if you bet on ten numbers =
10
100 = 0.1 = 10%.
A probability is the frequency with which something occurs. In the world of our imagi-
nary roulette wheel, the probability of a specific number coming up is 1 in 100, which we 
can write as a ratio: 1/100, or 1 percent. Think of the ratio as the frequency of the event 
occurring.
The probability that one of N particular numbers comes up is just N / 100. Here are two 
examples. First, because there are 50 even numbers from 1 to 100 (N = 50), the probability 
of spinning an even number is 50 / 100, which is 0.5, or 50 percent. Second, the probability 
of spinning a number less than or equal to 60 is 60 / 100, which is 0.6, or 60 percent.
Independence and the Gambler’s Fallacy
Fair roulette wheels have a special property. The outcome of one spin of the wheel will not 
help you predict the outcome of the next spin. This lack of connection between spins is 
called independence. When two random outcomes are independent, knowing about one 
outcome does not help you predict the other outcome.
At first glance, this independence property seems like a natural feature of roulette 
wheels. After all, if the outcome of the next spin were partly predictable, that might give 
gamblers an advantage over the house. But the idea that one spin does not predict the next 
pushes you to accept some interesting consequences.
Suppose you are playing at our imaginary wheel and that you have been betting on the 
number 64 every time. Suppose that 64 comes up 3 times in a row. Wow. That was good 
luck! You might be tempted to say that the table is “hot.” Or that the number 64 is “hot.” 
Maybe you are on a streak? Alternatively, you might decide to reach the opposite conclu-
sion. Maybe you should bet on a different number now that 64 has come up 3 times in a 
row? It would be shocking if 64 came up again!
These are all tempting conclusions, but they are all wrong. If you are betting on 64 with 
each spin, the likelihood of winning on the next spin is always 1 in 100. This is true whether 
or not 64 came up on the last spin. This is true even if 64 came up 10 times in a row on the 
last ten spins. Whatever the past history of spins, the likelihood that 64 will come up on the 
next spin is always 1 in 100.
A probability is the frequency with 
which something occurs.
When two random outcomes are 
independent, knowing about one 
outcome does not help you predict 
the other outcome.

Many gamblers don’t understand the independence property. Some gamblers believe in 
streaks: if they got lucky on the last spin, they mistakenly believe that they have a higher 
chance of winning on the next spin. This mistake is called the hot hand fallacy. Other 
gamblers believe that the roulette wheel somehow evens out from one spin to the next: “If 
the ball landed on the number 64 in the last spin, the chance of 64 coming up on the next 
spin is less than 1 in 100.” This last mistake—believing the wheel somehow tends to avoid 
repeats—is called the gambler’s fallacy.
You simply need to remember that roulette wheels don’t have memory. What hap-
pened on the last spin has no bearing on the next spin. In the language of statistics, the 
spins are independent of one another. Failing to appreciate independence is a good way 
to get drawn into gambling. If you mistakenly believe that the last spin somehow helps 
you predict the next spin, then you might mistakenly believe that you know how to “beat” 
the casino. Of course, you’ll have it backwards, because the more you play roulette, the 
more money you should expect to lose. We’ll calculate how much you’ll lose a little bit 
later in this chapter. 
Expected Value
Now that you’ve had an introduction to probabilities, we can put these ideas to work. We 
are going to calculate an expected value, which is the sum of all possible outcomes or val-
ues, each weighted by its probability of occurring. To explain what this means, it is easiest 
to work through an example.
Let’s return to the imaginary roulette wheel. Suppose that you have the following agree-
ment with the house. “If the ball ends up on the number 64 you win $100. If the ball ends 
up on 15 you lose $200. If the ball ends up on any other number, nothing happens.” How 
much will you win on average? In other words, how much would you win on average if you 
played this bet many times?
We can calculate this average payoff by multiplying the probability of each possible 
outcome by the dollars associated with each outcome. Here’s how:
(Probability of “64”) × ($100) + (Probability of “15”) × (−$200)  
+ (Probability of all other numbers) × ($0)
=
1
100 ($100) +
1
100 (-$200) + 98
100 ($0) 
= $1 − $2 + $0
= −$1.
The probabilities are 1 / 100 for the outcome of winning $100 (spinning a “64”), 1 / 100 
for the outcome of losing $200 (spinning a “15”), and 98 / 100 for the outcome that “noth-
ing happens” (spinning any number other than “64” and “15”). The dollar outcomes are 
weighted by their associated probabilities. The average payoff, which is called the expected 
value of this bet, is −$1.
Now consider a different bet. “If the wheel ends up with a number on or below 50, you 
win $200. If the wheel ends up with a number on or above 51, you lose $100.” What is the 
expected value of this bet?
Since there are 50 numbers on the imaginary roulette wheel on or below 50, the prob-
ability of winning $200 is 50 / 100, or 50 percent. Because there are 50 numbers on the 
imaginary roulette wheel on or above 51, the probability of losing $100 is 50 / 100, or 
50 percent. Therefore, the expected value of this gamble is $50:
(Probability of winning $200) × ($200) + (Probability of losing $100) × (−$100)
= 50
100 ($200) + 50
100 (- $100) 
= $100 − $50
= $50.
Expected value is the sum of all 
possible outcomes or values, each 
weighted by its probability of 
occurring.

We’ve explained that roulette tables don’t have memory. 
They don’t have patterns; they don’t have streaks; they 
don’t avoid repeats. Because there are no patterns that 
gamblers can exploit, gamblers can’t beat the casino in a 
game of roulette. Let’s calculate how much gamblers lose 
when they play roulette.
We’ll keep our imaginary 100-pocket roulette wheel, 
but we’ll set things up to roughly mimic the odds that 
gamblers have at a real American roulette table. Assume 
that the rules work the following way. If the wheel spins 
any number from 1 through 47, you win x dollars. If the 
wheel spins on any number from 48 through 100, you 
lose x dollars. What is your expected winning from play-
ing this game (with “bet” x )?
 Expected winning = 47
100 ($x  ) + 53

 = $x c 47
100 - 53
100 d
 
 = $x * -6
100
 
 = -6% of $x .
 
On average, you will lose 6 percent of the amount you 
bet. Of course, this doesn’t mean that you will actually lose 
this exact amount on each outing to the roulette ­table. 
Some nights you’ll lose more and some nights you’ll lose 
less, depending on your luck on that visit to the casino. 
On average, you’ll lose 6 percent of the money you bet.
You now know the expected cost of playing roulette.2 
If you bet $100 per spin of the wheel, then you should 
expect to lose $6 on average per spin. If the wheel spins 
40 times in an hour, and you bet on each spin, you should 
expect to lose 40 × $6 = $240 per hour.
Economists are not interested in scolding people about 
gambling. If gambling is fun for you, most of us won’t 
try to talk you out of the casino. But we do want you to 
understand the costs of gambling so you can make an 
informed decision. Economists and statisticians can’t help 
rolling their eyes when people say that they have a system 
that enables them to break even at the roulette table. The 
actual expected financial cost is about 6 percent of each 
bet that you make. It’s up to you to decide whether gam-
bling is entertaining enough to justify this implied price.

Is Gambling Worthwhile?
Extended Warranties
Almost all of the risk that we face is outside of casinos. We can use the imaginary roulette 
wheel to study these kinds of “gambles” too. We’ll illustrate the general applicability of 
these tools by using them to study the economic costs and benefits of an extended warranty.
Assume that you are buying a $300 TV from BestBuy. The TV automatically comes 
with a 1-year warranty. Suppose that you can extend that warranty so that it covers years 
two and three. Suppose further that the extended warranty costs $75. This is the typical cost 
of an extended warranty on a $300 TV. Is the extended warranty a good deal?
Let’s calculate the net present value of the extended warranty. To do this, we’ll need to es-
timate the frequency with which TVs break down. Suppose that each year, the probability of a 
breakdown is about 10
100 = 10 percent. In other words, each year the chance of a breakdown is 
equivalent to the chance of spinning a number from 1 through 10 on our imaginary 100-pocket 
roulette wheel. (This is the actual frequency of breakdowns for the least reliable brands.)
If you have an extended warranty, what do you get in the event of a breakdown? 
Your out-of-date TV is repaired or replaced. But an out-of-date TV is not as valuable

as it was when you originally bought it. During its second year of use, you can replace 
the original $300 TV with an equally good TV by spending only $250. During its third 
year of use, you can replace the original TV with an equally good TV by spending only 
$200. As technology improves, you can replace your old TV with less expensive, more 
recently built models. To sum up, your TV is worth only $250 in year two and only $200 
in year three.
The cost of the extended warranty is paid now. But the benefit of getting a potential 
replacement TV is realized in year two or year three. We need to discount those delayed 
benefits. Let’s assume that you are buying the TV and the extended warranty on credit, and 
your interest rate on your credit card is 10 percent.
Now we have all the information that we need to calculate the net present value of buy-
ing the extended warranty. Here is the formula:
 10
100 *
$250
(1 + 0.10)2 + 10
100 *
$200
(1 + 0.10)3 - $75 = $20.66 + $15.03 - $75 
= −$39.31.
Let’s interpret the individual terms in the equation above. The first term,  
10
100 *
$250
(1 + 0.10)2, is the value of having the extended warranty during the second year of 
ownership. The TV breaks with a probability of 10
100 = 10 percent. If it breaks, you get a 
replacement, which is worth $250. To calculate the present value of this replacement, we 
divide by (1 + r)2 = (1 + 0.10)2, where the exponent of 2 reflects the assumption that the 
payment is received two years from today.
The second term, 10
100 *
$200
(1 + 0.10)3, is the value of having the extended warranty during 
the third year of ownership. Once again, the TV breaks in the third year with a probability 
of 10
100 = 10 percent. If it breaks, the replacement is worth $200. To calculate the present 
value of this replacement, we divide by (1 + r)3 = (1 + 0.10)3, where the exponent of 
3 reflects the assumption that the payment is received three years from today.
The third term, −$75, is the cost of the extended warranty, which is paid at the moment 
that you purchase the TV. Because it is a cash outflow from you to BestBuy, it is negative.
The net present value is negative and large. As you can see above, the extended warranty 
provides expected benefits with present value of
$20.66 + $15.03 = $35.69,
but the extended warranty costs $75. So the net present value of the extended warranty is 
$35.69 − $75 = −$39.31. Extended warranties are a bad deal for most consumers, unless 
you are psychologically highly averse to the prospect of a broken TV and the financial cost 
of replacing it.
Moreover, our analysis ignored some additional reasons to avoid extended warranties, 
including the potential to misplace the warranty and time-consuming logistics: “Please call 
again later. Call volume to our warranty center is heavier than anticipated.”
Empirical evidence reveals that many people actually are extremely averse to the chance 
of a small financial loss and are therefore willing to buy expensive insurance to reduce 
the risk of such losses (like the extended warranty that we just discussed). Consequently, 
stores like BestBuy aggressively market extended warranties, and these extended war-
ranties are the source of most of BestBuy’s accounting profits. BestBuy doesn’t make an 
­accounting profit when it sells a television set without an extended warranty.
A high level of aversion to small financial losses is referred to as loss aversion. Loss 
­aversion is the idea that people psychologically weight a loss much more heavily than they 
psychologically weight a gain. When researchers empirically study this difference in weights, 
the researchers usually find that losses are weighted twice as heavily as gains. This degree 
of loss aversion implies that a person would be indifferent between $0 for sure or a coin

Loss aversion is the idea that 
people psychologically weight 
a loss more heavily than they 
psychologically weight a gain.

Consider a person choosing 
between two investments with the 
same expected rate of return but 
one investment has a fixed return 
and the other investment has a 
risky return. When people are risk 
averse, they prefer the investment 
with the fixed return. When people 
are risk seeking, they prefer the 
investment with the risky return. 
When people are risk neutral, they 
don’t care about the level of risk and 
are therefore indifferent between 
the two investments.
Summary
Most decisions have benefits and costs that occur at different times. To 
optimize, economic agents need to translate all of the benefits and costs into a 
single time period so they can be compared.
Interest is the payment received for temporarily giving up the use of money. 
The present value of a future payment is the amount of money that would 
need to be invested today to produce that future payment. The net present value of 
a project is the present value of the benefits minus the present value of the costs.
Utility is a measure of satisfaction or well-being. Utils are individual units of 
utility. A discount weight multiplies delayed utils to translate them into current utils.
Risk means that some of the costs and benefits are not fixed in advance.
A probability is the frequency with which something occurs. For example, 
a probability of 0.12 means that the event will happen 12 percent of the time on 
average, or 12 times (on average) out of every 100 attempts. An expected value is 
a probability-weighted value.
Loss aversion is the property that people psychologically weight a loss much 
more heavily than they psychologically weight a gain.
If two investments have the same expected return, but one investment 
has a fixed return and the other investment has a risky return, people with risk 
aversion prefer the investment with the fixed return.

Note that only the loss is weighted by the special factor of 2, which reflects the impact of 
loss aversion.
Economists are of two minds about loss aversion. Some believe that loss aversion 
is a bias that students should be taught to overcome. Other economists believe that 
loss aversion is a legitimate preference that should be respected and encouraged to 
express itself in economic life. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky first showed that 
loss aversion is a common behavior, though they didn’t take a position on whether 
loss aversion is a bias or a legitimate preference.3 Their work led to a Nobel Prize that 
was awarded to Kahneman. Tversky died at a young age and the Nobel is not given 
posthumously.
Loss aversion is one important example of a risk preference. In general, economists 
distinguish three categories of risk preferences: risk aversion, risk seeking, and risk neu-
trality. To understand these concepts, consider a person choosing between two invest-
ments with the same expected rate of return but one investment has a fixed return and the 
other investment has a risky return. When people are risk averse, they prefer the invest-
ment with the fixed return. When people are risk seeking, they prefer the investment with 
the risky return. When people are risk ­neutral, they don’t care about the level of risk 
and are therefore indifferent between the two investments. Thousands of empirical studies 
have shown that people are risk averse in most situations.

	 2.	 When you were born, your parents deposited $20,000 in 
the bank. The bank offers a fixed interest rate of 6 per-
cent. On your eighteenth birthday, your parents decide to 
withdraw the money that they deposited to pay for your 
college tuition. How much money can they expect to 
withdraw? Assume that interest is compounded annually.
	 3.	 Suppose you win a grand lottery on January 1, 2015. You 
can choose to receive the entire amount of $200 million 
either as a lump sum on January 1, 2015, or you can re-
ceive four equal payments of $52 million paid on January 
1, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. Assume your lottery earn-
ings are not taxed.
	
a.	 How would you decide which option to choose? As-
sume the interest rate to be 3 percent.

tended up to 30 years, the Congressional Budget Office 
(CBO) calculates the cost of these loans by discounting 
the future cash flows from the loan using the interest rate 
on the 30-year Treasury bond. The risk of default on the 
30-year Treasury bond is extremely low. In contrast, over 
the life of a Stafford loan, on average about 20% of the 
amount due is never repaid. What do you think are the 
implications of using the yield on the 30-year bond to 
calculate the cost of student loans?

hand hypothesis?
	 9.	 You are considering playing a card game. The rules of the

caused by fire. If the fire occurs, you will have to pay 
$50,000 to repair your house. What is the expected

and your savings account, at the end of the year? 
	
b.	 We will say that an insurance policy is fair insurance 
if the premium for the policy equals the expected

KEY IDEAS
In many markets buyers and sellers have different information, which 
can lead to market inefficiencies.
Asymmetry in information is either due to hidden characteristics or 
hidden actions.
In cases with hidden characteristics, agents can use their private 
information to decide whether to participate in a transaction or a market, 
causing adverse selection.
In cases with hidden actions, an agent can take an action that adversely 
affects another agent, causing moral hazard.
There are both private and government solutions to reduce the effects 
of adverse selection and moral hazard.
information, which means that one party has superior information to another 
party. How does such a situation fit into the models that we have presented thus 
far? The answer is not very well, because so far we have only considered cases 
where information is ­symmetric—that is, buyers and sellers have exactly the 
same information about the goods and ­services up for sale. For example, as dis-
cussed in our treatment of supply and demand in a perfectly competitive market 
in Chapters 4–7.
In this chapter, we’ll learn about situations in which an agent on one side 
of the market has an informational advantage over an agent on the other 
side. For example, used car salesmen know more about their cars than buyers 
do, you know more about your health than health insurance companies do, 
and investment banks know more about their financial risk than regulators 
do. Such “asymmetry” has important implications for economic decision 
making. We also discuss the interesting market and government solutions that 
have arisen to solve the negative effects of asymmetric information, and see 
how thinking about information asymmetries can help answer our opening 
question.
Upon some reflection, you will find that life presents many interactions in which one party 
to a transaction has different information from the other—information that the other party 
cares about. We refer to such discrepancies in knowledge between buyers and sellers as 
asymmetric information. We also say that the party with information that the other party 
to the transaction does not possess has private information.
We can distinguish two kinds of asymmetric information: first, hidden characteristics, 
in which one party in a transaction observes some characteristics of the good or service that 
the other doesn’t observe; second, hidden actions, in which one party in a transaction takes 
actions that are relevant for, but not observed by, the other party. For instance, potential 
customers might not know about the hidden rust patches on a secondhand car that the car 
salesman knows only too well—thus creating hidden characteristics. Or factory workers 
Asymmetric Information
16.1
In a market with asymmetric 
information, the information 
available to sellers and buyers differs.
There are hidden characteristics if 
one side observes something about 
the good being transacted that is 
both relevant for and not observed 
by the other party.
There are hidden actions if one side 
takes actions that are relevant for, 
but not observed by, the other party.

may try to hide the fact that they are taking an extra 10 minutes 
on their lunch break from their employer—an example of hidden 
actions.
Both types of asymmetric information can have profound 
impacts on markets—impacts that are, from a social standpoint, 
quite negative. If the information gaps are large enough, it is 
­possible in theory for a market to completely shut down even if 
everyone could benefit from trade! Interestingly, the people who 
suffer from such market failure include not only those with an 
informational disadvantage but also those with the extra information. We’ll explain why 
shortly. Given the large gains from exchange that asymmetric information can destroy, it’s 
not surprising that many institutions have arisen to mitigate its effects. Before we get to 
those institutions, though, let’s look in more depth first at transactions with hidden charac-
teristics and then at transactions with hidden actions.
Hidden Characteristics: Adverse Selection  
in the Used Car Market
Suppose that instead of buying a brand-new car, as in our opening chapter scenario, you 
decide to buy a used car. You begin your search by going online and scanning the local 
newspaper ads. You find a few nice-sounding vehicles in your price range, including a Ford 
Fusion and a Toyota Prius. But you end up focusing on a Dodge Smart Car, advertised for 
$5,000. Yet, a few doubts begin to creep into your mind: why is this person selling such a 
neat car for only $5,000? Does he expect it to break down? Did it already have problems? 
Does it look clean because it was just fished out of the local pond? You can’t answer these 
questions; only the owner has information on the extent of his own car’s problems, so you’re 
justifiably afraid you might be stuck with a product of low quality—in this case, a lemon.
Suspicious of such private sellers, you decide to try a used car lot. There you find slightly 
higher prices for similar cars than you found online. You see a car you like, but once again, 
uncertainty enters your mind: where did the dealer get this car? Was it repossessed from an 
owner who never had the oil changed? Maybe the fresh coat of paint is hiding fire damage. 
Will the dealer honor his warranty claim? As with the private sellers, the dealer knows much of 
this information. But such private ­information is valuable, so there is an incentive for the dealer 
to withhold important facts about the car. Have you ever heard of a seller admitting that the 
odometer has been rolled back? Well, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration de-
termined that more than 450,000 vehicles sold each year have odometers that are rolled back.
How does such information asymmetry affect the market? To illustrate, let’s say that you 
decide to purchase the Dodge Smart Car offered by a private seller. To understand how in-
formation asymmetry plays out, we first need to make some simplifying assumptions. Let’s 
first assume that there are two kinds of cars available: high-quality cars (“peaches”) and low-
quality cars (“lemons”). Let’s further suppose that to you, these cars look exactly the same, 
but you know that half of them are lemons and half are peaches. Only the seller actually 
knows whether he has a lemon or a peach. Because lemons constantly break down and need 
repairs often, they are worth zero to you and to the seller. On the other hand, the peaches 
are sturdy, reliable vehicles that both you and the seller value. Suppose for example that the 
value of such a peach to you is $5,000 and to the seller is $4,000—the fact that the value to 
you is greater than that to the seller means that there are gains from trade in this case.
What if this market is the same as those standard markets we’ve studied so far? In that 
case, we would have a separate price for lemons and a separate price for peaches. Lemons 
would be priced at $0, and peaches would sell somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000, 
depending on the number of sellers and buyers in the market. Thus, only peaches would be 
traded, and there would be gains to trade because buyers would value the cars more than 
sellers (in fact, the gains from a trade would be $1,000: $5,000 − $4,000). In this way, at 
least one of you would be better off because of the trade, and if the price is between $4,000 
and $5,000, then both of you would be better off. For example, if you buy the car at $4,500, 
you and the dealer are both $500 better off.
So, the outcome when quality is fully observable to everyone is that people in the market 
are at least as well off after the transaction as before. This is how well-functioning markets 
work—they raise the welfare of their participants.
If information gaps are large enough, 
it is possible in theory for a market 
to completely shut down even if 
­everyone could benefit from trade.

Section 16.1  |  Asymmetric Information
407
16.1
But now let’s think about what would happen under asymmetric information, where the 
seller knows if his car is a peach or a lemon but you do not. All that you know is that half of 
the used cars you are looking at are peaches and half are lemons. You thus recognize that the 
probability of any particular car being a peach is 50 percent, and vice-versa. ­Suppose also 
that you are risk neutral. You will recall from Chapter 15 that this means you will evaluate 
risky choices with their expected value. For example, suppose a coin is flipped, and if it 
ends up heads you win $10, and if it ends up tails you lose $10. If you are risk neutral, then 
this gamble is worth zero to you (or writing it mathematically, ½ × (10) + ½ × (−10) = 0).
Knowing this, what is the most that you would now be willing to pay for the car? 
­Because you value peaches at $5,000 and lemons at $0, and a car has a 50 percent chance 
of being either, as a risk-neutral buyer you will evaluate the expected value of buying a 
car of unknown quality as ½ × (5,000) + ½ × (0) = $2,500. This means that if you pay 
more than $2,500, you will be making a bad choice since your expected value is $2,500.
Now let’s think about the seller, who values peaches at $4,000 and lemons at $0. Would 
the seller give you a peach for $2,500? No, because he values peaches at $4,000. Instead, 
at $2,500, only owners of lemons will be offering their cars. Thus, if you are willing to pay 
$2,500 for a used car, the only car you will ever get from a private seller in this market is a 
lemon. Because sellers have private information on the car, you can now see what happens 
in this market: the best you can do is to buy a lemon! Knowing this, you are not willing 
to buy any used car that is actually offered for sale. In this case, asymmetric information 
causes the entire market to shut down even when there are ­substantial gains to trade!
The phenomenon illustrated here is a specific form of asymmetric information problem 
known as adverse selection. Adverse selection occurs when one agent in a transaction 
knows about a hidden characteristic of a good and decides whether to participate in the 
transaction on the basis of this (private) information. In our example, sellers of lemons gain 
from entering the market. But the limiting case discussed above shows that it is in theory 
possible for the market to completely shut down even if everyone could benefit from trade. 
Ironically, in this case, even the people who have superior information may be harmed.
Hidden Characteristics: Adverse Selection  
in the Health Insurance Market
Adverse selection in the used car market arises because sellers have private information. 
But there are also prominent adverse selection examples in which buyers have private 
­information. One such instance occurs in health insurance markets, where the term adverse 
selection was originally introduced.
As we learned in Chapter 15, risk-averse individuals would benefit from having 
­insurance against major risks. Without health insurance even a routine hospital visit in the 
United States might cost an individual several thousand dollars, and major surgeries and 
hospital stays can bankrupt all but the wealthiest of families. It is therefore natural that 
individuals and families should seek insurance against such risks. Since the passage of the 
Affordable Care Act or so-called Obamacare, in 2010, they are in fact mandated to do so, 
and we will see why such mandates may actually make sense.
In theory, the health insurance market works just like other insurance markets. Individuals 
sign up for a health plan and pay monthly premiums. In return, the health insurance company 
covers a large fraction of the costs for most doctor visits and hospital stays and procedures.
The problem of adverse selection again complicates things. In the used car market, adverse 
selection results from the fact that sellers know the quality of their car, while buyers do not. In 
health insurance markets, there is a similar asymmetry, but instead buyers of insurance have su-
perior information because they have a better idea about their health than insurance companies.
Once this asymmetry is in place, the wheels of adverse selection are in motion. To 
­illustrate its effects in health insurance markets, let’s assume that there are two types of 
individuals, high risk and low risk. High-risk individuals are less healthy and are more 
likely to need expensive treatment in the near future. Clearly, health insurance programs 
will attract a disproportionate number of high-risk individuals. But these are exactly the 
individuals that health insurance companies do not want to attract, because they are more 
often in need of expensive care.
Similar to the market for used cars, the adverse selection problem in the health insurance 
market can create major inefficiencies. One possibility is similar to the extreme outcome 
In a market with adverse selection, 
one agent in a transaction knows 
about a hidden characteristic of 
a good and decides whether to 
participate in the transaction on the 
basis of this information.

that we witnessed in the used car market: in the same way that bad cars drove out good 
ones, high-risk individuals can drive out low-risk individuals in the health insurance market.
How does this work? Health insurance companies might start charging higher premiums 
because they expect to attract many high-risk individuals, but then these higher premiums 
might discourage low-risk individuals from seeking health insurance. This causes even 
higher premiums. The cycle, sometimes called the “death spiral,” continues, and in theory, 
can unravel all the way to its logical conclusion of insurance companies charging such high 
premiums that no one ends up insured!
Market Solutions to Adverse Selection: Signaling
Are markets helpless against adverse selection? Not entirely. In practice, there are ways of 
dealing with it. One prominent solution for used cars is third-party certification markets, 
such as CARFAX, to ensure that the used car is not a lemon. More generally, we observe 
Educational Testing Services (ETS) offering SAT tests for college applicants, U.S. News &  
World Report ranking universities, Underwriters Laboratories certifying consumer and in-
dustrial products, Moody’s reporting corporate bond ratings, and accounting companies 
auditing financial reports for public corporations.
Such market-based solutions can help move markets plagued by adverse selection to-
ward efficient operation. Another mechanism that has arisen to combat the adverse selection 
problem is that of warranties. Warranties, which we first encountered in Chapter 15, are 
guarantees of quality issued directly by either the manufacturer or the seller. For example, 
when you buy a big-screen television, the manufacturer often provides a 1-year warranty 
on parts and services. For cars, manufacturers typically provide a 3-year, or 36,000 mile, 
warranty on the major parts, such as the engine and transmission.
A warranty is an example of signaling, in which an individual with private information 
takes action—sends a signal—to convince someone without the information that he or his 
products are high quality. How can a warranty be effective in signaling a high-quality good? 
The idea is that warranties are particularly expensive for low-quality products because these 
tend to break down more often. But then, because low-quality producers will shy away 
from offering warranties, the very fact that a seller offers a warranty suggests that he or she 
is likely to be selling a high-quality product. If it were costless for sellers to provide war-
ranties, then the signal would not be informative. But because warranties are potentially 
very expensive, low-quality goods are less likely to have warranties. In the Evidence-Based 
Economics section we discuss the value of automobile certification in the used car market.
Signaling does not just take place on the seller side of the market. Buyers, too, engage in 
signaling. For example, how can you, as a buyer of health insurance, send a signal of your 
quality (health)? One way is to show proof of annual physicals and overall good health 
prospects in the long run—exercising, not smoking, and not taking a lot of risks. Similarly, 
in the car insurance market, you signal that you are a safe driver by getting good grades in 
school and passing your driver competency tests.
Signaling refers to an action 
that an individual with private 
information takes in order 
to convince others about his 
information.
Market‐based solutions can help limit adverse selection. Third‐party certification mechanisms such as Moody’s ratings for 
corporate bonds, warranties for various products, and SAT tests for college applicants help—to a degree—to balance 
information asymmetries.

16.1
Why do more educated workers earn more than less edu-
cated workers? We learned in Chapter 11 that workers 
are paid the value of their marginal product. Thus one 
reason why people are paid differently is because they 
have different productivities. Yet, in many jobs it is dif-
ficult to determine individual productivity. For example, 
in a consulting firm, no two people manage the same 
client, so it’s difficult to say that any one individual did 
well handling a given case—there isn’t a proper compari-
son available. This is different from the scenario we con-
sidered in Chapters 6 and 11, where each Cheeseman 
worker packaged a definite number of cheese boxes and 
the production of one worker could be directly compared 
to the production of another worker.
Nobel Prize-winning economist Michael Spence sug-
gested an alternative explanation for why more educated 
workers earn more than less educated ones.1 Spence 
developed the theory of signaling, whereby in markets 
with asymmetric information and adverse selection, indi-
viduals could choose costly signals in order to reveal their 
private information. Education might be such a signal. 
With a college degree, you might be telling the world, 
and in particular potential employers, that you have been 
successfully admitted to a selective college program and 
that you have the capacity to perform well in a variety of 
courses.
Such signaling is similar to Toshiba providing a warranty 
for its plasma TVs, or Ford guaranteeing its car engines 
for 3 years or 36,000 miles. The key to why signaling can 
work in the case of obtaining a college degree is that 
the signal is sufficiently scarce (not everybody has such 
a degree) and it is more costly to obtain for lower-ability 
students than for higher-ability students—for example,

S
o is the popular wisdom true that the value of a new car will plunge the instant it 
is driven off the lot? Are there any data to back up that claim?
Exhibit 16.1 provides several illustrative examples showing that this claim is 
indeed true. The numbers in the exhibit show the price gap in 2010 between 2009 un-
used year-old cars and 2009 used year-old cars (both certified used cars and noncertified 
used cars).
What the numbers show is a 20 percent to 40 percent price difference between new 
and used cars. Could these percentage differences be due entirely to a year of wear-and-
tear? Perhaps it’s because people don’t like driving a car that someone else drove before 
them? Nobel Prize-winning economist George Akerlof’s classic article on the econom-
ics of information, published in 1970, starts with the observation that the low price of 
used cars does not seem entirely justified by wear-and-tear or by the fact that people 
don’t like driving cars that others have previously owned.2
Akerlof proposed an explanation based on asymmetric information. You will recall 
that this explanation rests on the observation that cars sold by their owners might be so

cheap because people are worried about getting a lemon. This explanation is supported by 
the data in Exhibit 16.1 that show consumers pay a premium for transacting with dealers 
instead of with private parties. Even though you probably shouldn’t trust used car sales-
men fully either, dealer-certified cars come with warranties and dealers have a reputation 
to protect, thus reducing the extent of the adverse selection problem and convincing buyers 
to pay higher prices for such dealer-certified vehicles.
Such evidence suggests the presence of a lemons market, because dealer certification 
is one way in which customers ensure they aren’t getting a lemon. If buyers want to go to 
private sellers, they take on an increased risk of getting a lemon. There are lots of other 
differences between private sellers and dealers, however. To find a market for lemons, we 
would need proof that the used cars sold actually were lemons. One way of getting such 
proof is to study the maintenance records of cars sold and not sold in the private used car 
market.
The U.S. Census Bureau Truck Inventory Use Survey of 1977 allowed economists 
­Michael Pratt and George Hoffer3 to look at the maintenance records of a random sampling 
of pickup trucks purchased new and used. They found considerable differences between 
those cars kept by their original owners and those cars that people bought used. They con-
cluded that there is evidence of lemons actually reaching the market.
Similar evidence has emerged suggesting that lemons might be clogging the used car 
market in the Basle City region of Switzerland. Economists Winand Emons and George 
Sheldon4 analyzed the vehicle-safety inspection records of all cars in that region. They 
found that the probability of having a major defect was higher among those cars sold 
privately, supporting the idea of adverse selection in the used car market. Notably, they 
found exactly the opposite trend in cars sold by dealers who provided certification for used 
cars, thus supporting the hypothesis that market mechanisms emerge to combat a lemons 
problem.

Moral hazard is another term 
for actions that are taken by one 
party but are relevant for and not 
observed by the other party in the 
transaction.
People tend to take more risks if 
they don’t have to bear the costs  
of their behaviors.
We have explored the first type of asymmetric information in which there are hidden char-
acteristics observable by one party in a transaction and not the other. We now look at a 
second type of asymmetric information in which there are hidden actions taken by one 
party in a transaction that are relevant for but not observed by the other party. When hidden 
actions on the part of one agent influence another agent’s payoffs, we also say that there is 
moral hazard.
The notion of moral hazard is usually associated with risk and insurance markets but 
reaches far beyond. The basic idea is that people tend to take more risks if they don’t have 
to bear the costs of their behaviors. So, for example, an insured 
driver doesn’t bear the full marginal cost he imposes on the insur-
ance company when driving more miles or more aggressively. In 
particular, he does not receive an insurance penalty for aggressive 
driving, such as “fishtailing” on snow-covered roads or “tailgat-
ing” another car on the highway. Both actions are associated with 
an increased probability of being in an accident, in which case the 
insurance company will usually have to pay. If drivers had to pay 
for damages, they would drive more safely, but with insurance they have less of an incen-
tive to avoid actions that raise the likelihood of being in an accident.
Likewise, once insured, home owners near water do not have full incentives to pro-
tect themselves from the adverse effects of floods. Some have argued that the National 
Flood Insurance Program administered by the U.S. government encourages home owners 
to build—and sometimes rebuild—too close to water. As you might guess, knowing that 
one’s beach house will be fully covered by insurance in case of a storm surge doesn’t do 
much to discourage building in a vulnerable location. In effect, the insurance subsidizes 
risky behavior.

Although the exact importance of signaling in the labor 
market is controversial, an interesting example of signal-
ing comes from a very unusual corner: the tail of the pea-
cock.5 Peacocks have famously ornate plumage, often 
referred to as their tail, which has yard-long feathers and 
brilliant, iridescent blue-green colors. This tail puzzled 
evolutionary biologists for a long time. The tail is costly to 
grow and what’s more, it makes the peacock less mobile 
and an easier prey for predators. Natural selection should 
have eliminated it.
The reason why it has not been eliminated is that pea-
hens seem to have a preference for mating with pea-
cocks with such ostentatious tails. This fact by itself could 
­explain the evolution of the tail. But is it just an accident 
that peahens prefer to mate with peacocks with such 
showy tails? Some biologists argue that it is not an ac-
cident at all. The tail is a signal. Only peacocks with good 
genes can develop such brightly colored plumage. Thus 
the plumage is a costly way of signaling good genes. It is 
a valuable signal, precisely because it is costly and it can-
not be easily copied by peacocks with less good genes. 
The debate about the exact origins of the peacock’s tail in 
biology is by no means settled. But it shows the possibil-
ity of signaling in nature and animal behavior.

At the root of the moral hazard argument is that peo-
ple who have insurance behave more recklessly. But, do 
they really? Think of something close to home: wearing 
a helmet when you’re pedaling away on your bike. This 
is a form of insurance. In case of an accident, you don’t 
have to suffer the full consequences, so you are “insured” 
against major head damage.
Interestingly, the evidence shows that bicyclists wear-
ing helmets have significantly fewer head injuries but 
significantly more non-head injuries than bicyclists not 
wearing helmets.6 This result suggests that they were, in 
fact, taking extra risks that they would have avoided with-
out helmets. Of course, even with such riskier behavior, 
helmets protect you against severe injuries, and we defi-
nitely recommend that you wear them!
Also of note is the possibility that bicycle helmets 
change not only risk-taking by bicyclists but might also 
be affecting the behavior of automobile drivers. At 
least, that’s the evidence from an enterprising psycholo-
gist from England who rode his bike around fitted with 
sensors that could tell how close he was to the road’s 
edge and how close a car was when it passed him.7 He 
found that when he wore a helmet, drivers left him much 
less room.
This evidence definitely does not suggest that you 
should leave your helmet at home. Just as football players 
are constantly told to hit only with their shoulder pads, 
­bicyclists should be aware of the risks they might unwit-
tingly take when they strap on a helmet.
LETTING THE DATA SPEAK
Moral Hazard on Your Bike
Moral hazard extends well beyond insurance markets. 
­Employee theft represents perhaps the clearest example of moral 
hazard in the workplace. Experts estimate that employee theft 
costs American business hundreds of billions of dollars annu-
ally and is increasing at alarming rates—some say by 15 ­percent 
per year. This is an example of a hidden action because if the 
employees are good at stealing, they do so in a way that the 
­employer cannot detect.
Under moral hazard the uninformed party can sometimes 
­design a contract to incentivize the party with private informa-
tion. Economists refer to such relationships as a principal–agent 
­relationship. The party with the hidden action (thus with the pri-
vate information) is the agent. The uninformed party, who can design a contract before the 
agent chooses his action, is the principal. This contract determines the agent’s payoff (for 
example, wage or salary when the principal is an employer and the agent a worker) as a 
function of his success or failure or other indicators of his performance. The principal tries 
to structure the contract so as to provide appropriate incentives to the agent (for example, 
so as to incentivize the worker to work hard).
Market Solutions to Moral Hazard in the Labor Market: 
Efficiency Wages
In a principal–agent relationship, the principal’s problem is to create clever plans to 
mitigate moral hazard. Whether it is a car insurance company trying to induce safer 
driving habits or an employer trying to stop employee theft, such incentive schemes 
are everywhere. For their part, economists have spent decades studying such incentive 
schemes.
The party with the hidden action 
(thus with the private information) 
is the agent. The uninformed party,

In a principal–agent relationship, 
the principal designs a contract 
specifying the payments to the 
agent as a function of his or her 
performance, and the agent 
takes an action that influences 
performance and thus the payoff of 
the principal.

An early example of one such clever innovation in the labor market 
can be found at Ford Motor Company. Led by Henry Ford, it was one of 
the most important corporations in the United States in the early twen-
tieth century.8 In 1914, Henry Ford did something that at first appeared 
strange, even paradoxical, in the context of our competitive labor mar-
ket models. He increased the daily minimum wage of Ford employees 
from $2.34 to $5.00.
Why would a profit-maximizing employer increase his employees’ 
pay above competitive levels? One possibility is that Ford might have 
been acting altruistically, out of some type of social responsibility. 
However, Ford’s own account puts the motivation for the five-dollar 
day as follows: “There was no charity in any way involved. . . . We 
wanted to pay these wages so that the business would be on a lasting 
foundation. We were building for the future.”
Ford’s strategy is consistent with profit maximization in a world of asymmetric infor-
mation. In fact, what Ford did was an example of paying what economists call ­efficiency 
wages. Efficiency wages refer to wages above the lowest pay workers will accept; 
­employers use the higher wage to increase productivity (people work harder to avoid los-
ing their high-paying jobs). Ford appears to have had such an objective, as he later noted: 
“The payment of five dollars a day for an eight-hour day was one of the finest cost-cutting 
moves we ever made.”
How could moral hazard be a problem in a Ford factory? Imagine yourself on the 
­assembly line 100 years ago. Your chore is to check for defective parts. Such work is 
quite monotonous, as is evident by the high turnover and absenteeism rates that Ford was 
facing before 1914. But there is only a small chance that if you exert low effort, you will 
be ­detected by your line manager, thus making your effort choice a hidden action. With a 
limited scope for being held accountable for mistakes and careless work, many would be 
tempted not to work hard.
Here is where the problem of asymmetric information arises. The manager at Ford can’t 
tell exactly how many parts an employee checks, just as the manager at a movie theater 
can’t tell if his employee has swept under all of the seats or only a few between showings. 
On the job, moral hazard refers to shirking from responsibilities.
The basic idea behind Ford’s solution to the moral hazard problem is that a work-
er’s effort rises when her wages increase. There are several potential reasons for this 
relationship.
	
1.	 Higher-paid workers might wish to work harder because a higher-paying job is 
more valuable to them, and the risk of not succeeding in this job—and thus having 
to quit or be fired—becomes potentially more costly.
	
2.	 Higher wages might encourage workers to stay longer in the company, reducing 
turnover, which is costly to the employer because of the additional recruitment and 
training that it necessitates. Moreover, the longer employment relationships that 
result with low turnover might increase worker productivity through experience 
effects. Higher wages might thus increase profits via both channels.
	
3.	 Higher pay might motivate the worker psychologically. For example, workers who 
perceive generosity from their employers might perceive this as a “gift” and re-
ciprocate by working harder at their jobs—a phenomenon sometimes dubbed gift 
exchange in the economics literature.
Market Solutions to Moral Hazard in the Insurance Market: 
“Putting Your Skin in the Game”
Just as with adverse selection, many market mechanisms have arisen to reduce moral 
­hazard. One of the key approaches is to align the principal and agent’s incentives. Within 
insurance markets, that means aligning policyholders’ incentives with those of the insurer. 
A typical technique to achieve this goal is to make certain that the insured individuals have 
some “skin in the game” and will have to share the costs that their actions impose on their 
insurer. There are several ways to accomplish such an alignment of payoffs between poli-
cyholders and insurers.
Was Henry Ford kindhearted or simply a shrewd 
businessman?

Suppose that you are the school superintendent in your 
school district and you want to improve K–12 education. 
You are told that a major problem is that the teachers 
do not work hard enough to invest in the children. They 
should be given stronger incentives. Your deputy, who has 
completed the first part of a course on the economics of 
information, suggests that this can be achieved by making 
teachers’ pay a function of the test score improvements 
of pupils. The higher the test score improvement of the 
students, the greater the compensation of the teachers. 
Would you go ahead with such a plan?
As part of a field experiment in the Chicago Heights 
school district, Roland Fryer, Steve Levitt, John List 
and Sally Sadoff implemented precisely such a plan.9 
At the beginning of the school year, certain teachers 
were informed that they could participate in a pay-for-­
performance bonus program based on how their students 
improved on standardized tests. The program used an 
end-of-year test to measure the students’ improvement 
relative to the beginning of the year and then awarded 
the bonus based on those scores. Teachers could earn as 
much as $8,000 if their students improved, an increase of 
more than 15 percent of their annual salary. Other teach-
ers were held as the control group to make sure that any 
differences in test score improvement were due to the 
incentive program.
On the face of it, providing incentives to teachers 
sounds like a good idea. Moral hazard is endemic in 
all service occupations, and teaching is no exception. 
In the study, the researchers did find that the merit pay 
worked: students in classrooms with an incentive teacher 
did much better than those students who had teachers 
with no financial incentive. Importantly, the researchers 
were careful to proctor the tests and have them graded 
independently, just in case the incentives in this program 
caused unscrupulous behavior among teachers.
But there is also a dark side to incentivizing teachers. 
A  different study by economists Steve Levitt and Brian 
Jacob used data from actual standardized tests adminis-
tered to third through eighth graders in the Chicago Pub-
lic Schools (CPS) system.10 These test scores were being 
used to identify schools for closures and repurposing. The 
intriguing, but also very disturbing, result Jacob and Levitt 
discovered was endemic teacher cheating in response to 
these incentives. Focusing on hard-to-believe strings of 
answers in a student’s test as well as looking at the similar-
ity of certain answer strings across students in a particular 
classroom or school (all telltale signs of teachers giving the 
answers to students), they found that teacher cheating in-
creased significantly in response to incentives. The lesson 
is that hidden actions in many real-world situations such as 
teaching are multifaceted. Incentives should be designed 
carefully, taking all dimensions of hidden actions into ac-
count, or else they might lead to improvements in some 
dimensions but also significant deterioration in others.

Designing Incentives for Teachers
	
1.	 Deductibles form the portion of claims that policyholders must pay for out of their 
own pockets. A person with a $500 deductible on his auto insurance, for example, 
who causes an accident leading to $5,000 of damage, will only obtain $4,500 from 
the insurer. By imposing some of the costs of claims directly on policyholders, the 
insurer gives them an incentive to take actions that reduce the likelihood of claims.
	
2.	 Co-payments work similarly. These are payments (most commonly applied in 
health insurance markets) that the policyholder makes whenever filing a claim. The 
$5 or $10 fee you pay for each prescription you obtain through a prescription drug 
plan, for example, is a common type of co-payment.
	
3.	 In coinsurance, the responsibility for paying claims is split between the insurer 
and the policyholder on a set schedule. Many health insurance policies, for 
­instance, pay 80 percent of costs. The policyholder remains responsible for the 
other 20 percent.

H
ealth insurance is a first-order issue for society but a difficult one for economists. 
Competition can spur innovation, lower prices, and in general, increase efficiency. 
Yet when it comes to health insurance, the case for competition is murky. As de-
scribed earlier in the chapter, if insurance companies have no way of figuring out the 
health status of each person interested in an insurance policy, then there is no guarantee 
that competition will lead to a vibrant health insurance industry. This leads to potential 
gains from government intervention, such as the Obamacare program we discussed earlier.
In the mid-1990s, a small-scale test of this problem occurred at Harvard University. 
For ages, Harvard had offered its employees many different insurance plans and had 
subsidized all of the plans at high levels. For example, the change in premium from the 
cheapest healthcare option to the most expensive was over $600, but employees only had 
to pay an extra $300 to get all of that extra coverage because Harvard was subsidizing 
their health premiums. Then in 1995, as healthcare prices were skyrocketing, Harvard 
decided to have employees actually pay the extra cost of their expensive healthcare plans. 
It instituted a program whereby all plans were subsidized at the same base level and con-
sumers had to pay all the extra costs for their more expensive plans. What resulted was 
that prices went up for every plan, but they went up the most for the most expensive plans.
For some employees, this new plan went into effect in 1995. For others, it went into 
effect in 1996. Using this difference, economists David Cutler and Sarah Reber were able 
to test the influence of asymmetric information on the introduction of increased price 
competition and how beneficial competition would be for the provision of healthcare.11
They found that there was a significant increase in adverse selection with the in-
troduction of increased price competition: healthy people decided it wasn’t worth it 
to pay the extra price for the fancy healthcare plans, which increased the percentage 
of ­unhealthy people in the most expensive plans. This adverse selection increased 
the price of the most expensive plans. The authors estimated that the cost of this adverse 
selection was quite substantial, equivalent to about 2–4 percent of baseline healthcare 
spending at Harvard—meaning that the cost of greater adverse selection to Harvard 
staff, on average, was as if the baseline care plans were 2–4 percent more expensive.
So asymmetric information can cause private insurance to have a steeper price tag 
than it would have otherwise. Can government intervention help? We turn to this next.

The purpose of each of these three devices is to give policyholders some incentive to 
reduce the size or likelihood of their claims. These and other practices reduce the impact 
of moral hazard on insurance markets. But it’s important to remember that even when its 
­effects are dampened by these devices, moral hazard can still create inefficiencies and 
­affect the structure of the markets in which it is a factor.

Even when private solutions to adverse selection and moral hazard are effective, there 
might remain gains to government intervention. To see why, let’s consider the case of 
healthcare. We know that unhealthy people are more likely to require medical care 
and are therefore more likely to purchase insurance. This adverse selection problem 
drives up insurance companies’ costs, leading to higher prices. If prices increase so 
much that the marginal consumer decides to opt out of health insurance, the problem 
is exacerbated until only the sickest consumers are insured at high prices or the market 
collapses.
The data are broadly consistent with such death spirals, leading to the unraveling 
of insurance coverage in the United States before the implementation of Obamacare 
(Affordable Care Act (ACA)). For ­example, in the spring of 2010, more than 8 million 
of the 46 million uninsured were between the ages of 18 and 24, and approximately 
16.5 million were between the ages of 18 and 34. These younger workers presumably 
have better health than the average American (who is 36.7 years old) and can be con-
sidered as relatively low risk. As they decide not to get health insurance, the average 
risk of those seeking insurance increases, which necessitates higher premiums and 
encourages yet more low-risk individuals to drop out of the market. This sort of death 
spiral in the health insurance market due to adverse selection was in fact one of the 
motivations for Obamacare, which, by making health insurance mandatory, intended 
to prevent such unraveling.
The underlying problem is one of hidden characteristics: people who purchase health 
insurance have more information about their likely medical costs than insurers. An impor-
tant implication of these hidden characteristics is that even when everyone wants insurance, 
and will pay more for insurance than the health costs they expect to incur, the market will 
not necessarily provide insurance to everyone. Accordingly, there is a role for government 
to step in and potentially improve market outcomes.
The ACA made health insurance mandatory, potentially preventing the market from 
completely unraveling. The mandate works as a tax: by 2016, individuals who do not have 
health insurance will pay about $60 per month. The act was signed into law by President 
Obama in March of 2010.
The goal of the ACA was to increase health insurance coverage for Americans by in-
creasing quality and decreasing the price. Price could potentially decrease because the 
ACA forces healthier people to buy insurance, lessening the adverse selection problem.
Did this actually work in practice?
Although it is too early to tell if the ACA worked as anticipated, there is a blueprint 
that economists have empirically examined to explore a similar question. The ACA is very 
similar to the Massachusetts universal healthcare reform of 2006, 
in that the Massachusetts plan also included an individual mandate. 
Three economists, Amitabh Chandra, Jonathan Gruber, and Robin 
McKnight, tested whether the mandate alleviated the adverse selec-
tion problem in the Massachusetts health insurance market.12 By 
comparing the number of healthy and unhealthy enrollees just before 
and after the mandate, they found that the rate of healthy enrollees 
nearly tripled while the rate of unhealthy enrollees only doubled. The 
finding that the rate of enrollment rose among healthier people sug-
gests that the Massachusetts mandate helped to reduce the adverse 
selection problem.
The next step is to explore how health insurance prices were in-
fluenced. This research is ongoing, but consistent with economic 
theory, the empirical work has shown that there has been a decrease 
in the average price of premiums statewide due to the Massachusetts 
reform.

Government Intervention and Moral Hazard
Can government intervention alleviate problems of moral hazard? The answer is yes, and 
such interventions are all around us. Let’s continue with our healthcare example. Upon 
introducing the ACA or the Massachusetts reform, a number of potential problems arise. 
For example, moral hazard could lead to citizens taking less care of their health than when 
they did not have insurance. With excellent insurance coverage in place, individuals might 
be more likely to engage in risky activities such as smoking or might engage in fewer pre-
ventative activities such as health checkups and screenings.
How can the government intervene to mitigate such moral hazard? One option is to 
­introduce taxes to curb risky behaviors or introduce subsidies to promote healthy choices. 
As we have already seen, another option is to introduce deductibles and co-payments, simi-
lar to what private providers do today.
Of course, government intervention because of asymmetric information goes well 
­beyond healthcare. For example, states mandate car insurance and design incentives to 
encourage safe driving habits.
While in theory these solutions make a lot of sense, in prac-
tice, as we learned in Chapter 10, the government faces real chal-
lenges. First, the market solutions we have discussed prevent the 
wholesale collapse of the market (which we saw is a possibility 
in the case of lemons). Second, even in those cases where there 
are improvements to be made, similar problems of asymmetric 
information that limit private trade can prevent effective govern-
ment action. After all, the government cannot observe hidden 
characteristics or hidden actions either.
In many cases, the problems are the costs created by government policies intended to 
create a more equitable distribution of income and resources in the presence of asymmetric 
information. These problems are at the root of the famous trade-off between equity and 
­efficiency, which we discussed in Chapter 10: the government can improve equity, but 
often at the cost of reduced efficiency.
The Equity-Efficiency Trade-off
Economists understand that some amount of unemployment has always existed in market 
economies and is largely unavoidable. It takes time for workers to find jobs suited to their 
skills and interests. But when workers are unemployed, they receive no labor income and 
their families suffer. Most advanced market economies strive to achieve greater equity by 
providing unemployment benefits in order to reduce such fluctuations in worker incomes. 
But, unemployment benefits also create costs because of moral hazard.
Moral hazard is present in the problem facing unemployed workers because how hard 
a worker is trying to find a job or what possibilities he is turning down is private informa-
tion. It would be difficult to design an unemployment benefit system that stipulates that 
generous unemployment benefits will be available to workers who are “trying hard to get 
jobs.” Generous unemployment benefits imply weaker incentives to look for work and the 
possibility of a longer duration of unemployment.
The presence of moral hazard in the behavior of unemployed workers introduces an 
unavoidable trade-off in the design of unemployment benefits: greater equity and insur-
ance for unemployed workers and their families come at the cost of reducing worker effort 
to find new jobs. Naturally, this trade-off does not mean that unemployment benefits are 
unnecessary or undesirable, but it might imply that unemployment benefits should not be 
so generous as to remove all incentives to search for new jobs. For example, providing 
workers with unemployment benefits that are equal to the wage that they would earn if 
working would definitely be a bad idea.
Crime and Punishment as a Principal–Agent Problem
Problems of asymmetric information are relevant not only when governments engage in 
redistribution as in the unemployment benefit case but also when they try to enforce law 
The government can improve ­equity, 
but often at the cost of reduced 
efficiency.

and order. Nobel Prize-winning economists Gary Becker and George Stigler suggested 
that the problem of how to monitor and punish crime should be thought of as a principal–
agent problem, with society acting as the principal and a citizen subject to regulations as 
the agent.
Government rules are everywhere. All states enforce laws, uphold property rights, and 
prevent crimes. If they didn’t, society would have to suffer through the detrimental actions 
of quite a few bad apples. At the other extreme, if a state wanted to prevent all crime, it 
would need to have an unmanageably large police force. Somewhere in between, each type 
of government finds its optimal level of crime and punishment.
Becker and Stigler suggested that crime could be thought of as a principal–agent 
­relationship under moral hazard because the actions of the agent, whether he or she has 
broken the law or committed a crime, are not perfectly observable by the principal, in this 
case the state (or the government).15 Viewed through this perspective, crime prevention 
is a problem in the design of incentives. Becker and Stigler then suggested that, to a first 
approximation, incentives will be shaped by expected punishment, defined as the product 
of two terms as follows:
Expected punishment = Probability of detection × Punishment if detected.
Thus either the probability of detection needs to be sufficiently high, or punishment, if 
detected, has to be severe enough to reach the level of expected punishment necessary to 
prevent a crime.
Becker noted that although ensuring a high probability of detection is costly for society, 
increasing the punishment if detected is not so costly. The optimal “penal code” should 
have a relatively small probability of detection and thus a small police force, but it should 
impose a heavy punishment against those who are detected. This is a powerful framework 
for thinking about the design of laws and their enforcement. It potentially explains why 
many small crimes go unpunished but how society might still successfully create sufficient 
deterrence against other, more serious crimes.
The role of moral hazard in the job-seeking behavior of un-
employed workers is illustrated by several studies. In the 
United States, unemployed workers spend an ­average of 
just 41 minutes per weekday looking for a job. This num-
ber increases to more than 60 minutes per weekday in the 
week before their unemployment benefits ­expire (in most 
states, unemployment benefits expire after 6 months of 
unemployment).
This evidence suggests that in the presence of unem-
ployment insurance, unemployed workers do not exert 
as much effort in seeking a new job as they would have 
done without the insurance.13 Consistent with this per-
spective, European workers, who typically receive more 
generous unemployment benefits than workers in the 
United States, appear to spend less time looking for a 
new job.
The job-finding behavior of unemployed workers also 
confirms that they are more eager to find jobs right be-
fore their benefits expire. In Austria, for example, a typical 
unemployed worker is estimated to be 2.4 times more 
likely to exit unemployment in the week right before ben-
efits expire than in other weeks.14
LETTING THE DATA SPEAK
Moral Hazard Among Job Seekers
According to studies, unemployed workers don’t exert 
as much effort in finding a job as they would have  
without insurance.

Summary
Many real-world markets are characterized by asymmetric information 
because there are important informational disparities between buyers and  
sellers.
One type of asymmetric information is driven by hidden characteristics, 
meaning that certain characteristics are hidden from either sellers or buyers. 
Hidden characteristics lead to adverse selection when agents can use their private 
information to decide whether to participate in a transaction.
Another type of asymmetric information is due to hidden actions, which  
arise when one party to a transaction can take actions, not observed by the 
other party, affecting everyone’s payoffs. Hidden actions lead to moral hazard 
problems.
Although the market has developed means to deal with information 
asymmetries, such as warranties, deductibles, certification, and efficiency  
wages, in many situations these may be insufficient, and government  
intervention may be useful to limit the inefficiencies that asymmetric  
information creates.

Problems
	 1.	 When a major league baseball player’s contract has ex-
pired, he can either sign a new contract with his current 
team or become a free agent and sign a contract to play 
with a different team. If adverse selection is a problem in 
the market for major league ball players, who do you think 
are more likely to be injured the season after they sign a 
new contract: players who re-sign with their current team 
or players who sign with a new team? Explain.
	 2.	 There are fifty low-risk people in a town and fifty high-
risk people. A low-risk person has an average of $500 in 
medical expenses each year and is willing to pay $800 for 
medical insurance (this person is risk averse). A high-risk 
person has an average of $1,200 in medical expenses each 
year and is willing to pay $1,500 for medical insurance. 
Insurance companies are unable to tell who is high-risk 
and who is low-risk.
	
a.	 Show that an insurance company would lose money if 
it offered medical insurance at a price of $1,000.
	
b.	 Show that if the insurance company offered medical in-
surance at a price of $1,300, low-risk people would not 
be insured. Calculate total surplus if the price is $1,300.
	
c.	 Now suppose the government in this town passes a law 
that requires everyone to purchase medical insurance 
and sets the price of insurance at $1,600. Calculate to-
tal surplus under this law.
	
d.	 The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act (commonly called the Affordable Care Act, or 
“Obamacare”) includes an individual mandate that 
requires everyone to have health insurance. Does 
this question suggest that there is an efficiency argu-
ment in favor of the individual mandate? Defend your 
­answer carefully.
	 3.	 This chapter explains that signaling refers to an action that 
an individual with private information takes in order to con-
vince others about his information. Screening also involves 
private information but is somewhat different from signal-
ing. Screening refers to an action taken by an uninformed 
person to learn about someone else’s private information. 
So, for example, you are engaged in screening if you have 
a mechanic inspect a used car you are considering buying.
	
	 The biblical story of King Solomon is in 1 Kings 3: 
16–28 (see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_
of_­Solomon). Two young women who both had an infant 
son came to Solomon for a judgment. One of the women 
claimed that the other, after accidentally smothering her 
own son while sleeping, had exchanged the two children 
to make it appear that the living child was hers. The other 
woman denied this, and so both women claimed to be the 
mother of the living son and said that the dead boy be-
longed to the other. Show that King Solomon understood 
screening very well.
	 4.	 All used cars are lemons or peaches. Owners know 
whether or not their car is a lemon, but buyers do not; 
that is, the quality of a car is private information. There 
are many more buyers than sellers. Buyers value a peach 
at $2,000 and a lemon at $100; owners value a peach at 
$1,500 and a lemon at $50. Owners can have their cars 
inspected for $50. If they do have their car inspected, they 
will receive a certificate that shows whether the car is a 
lemon or a peach. Show that owners of peaches will have 
their cars inspected and will sell those cars for $2,000. 
Show also that the owners of lemons will not obtain a 
certificate and will sell their cars for $100.
	 5.	 Suppose some workers are capable and others are ex-
traordinary. Firms are willing to pay capable workers a 
salary of $14,000 and extraordinary workers a salary of 
$20,000. Workers know if they are capable or extraor-
dinary but firms do not (that is, ability is private infor-
mation). It would cost a capable person $8,000 to earn a 
college degree but it would cost an extraordinary person 
just $4,000 to earn a college degree since they can finish 
their education much faster. Show that in equilibrium in 
this labor market (i) extraordinary people go to college but 
capable people do not, and (ii) firms pay college graduates 
$20,000 and high school graduates $14,000.
	 6.	 Grade inflation is widespread; college students receive 
higher grades on tests and exams today for work that 
would have received lower grades in the past. One recent 
study found that 41 percent of students had grade point 
averages of A-minus or higher in 2009, compared to just 
7 percent in 1969. In other words, grades improve while 
actual learning does not. Employers often use grades and 
college degrees as signals in the job market, where there 
is asymmetric information. What effect would grade in-
flation have on the effectiveness of college degrees and 
grades as signals?
	 7.	 The U.S. government, like many governments through-
out the world, bailed out large financial institutions that 
were thought to be “too big to fail” during the 2008 finan-
cial crisis. Some critics of the bailouts argued that these 
policies created a moral hazard problem; banks would 
undertake too many risky projects if they knew that the 
government would bail them out if the project failed. This 
question explores this moral hazard problem.
	
a.	 Suppose a bank has the opportunity to invest in a risky 
project. If the project is successful, the bank will earn 
$60; if it is unsuccessful, the bank will lose $80. The 
probability that the project will be successful is 0.5. 
What is the expected value of investing in this proj-
ect? If the bank is risk neutral, will the bank make this 
investment? 
Select problems are available in MyEconLab for practice and instructor assignment.

b.	 Now suppose the government has a policy that helps 
banks that are suffering losses. Under this policy, the 
government will give a bank 50 percent of the bank’s 
losses if a project is unsuccessful. Thus, if the project 
in this problem is unsuccessful, the government will 
give the bank 0.5 × $80, or $40. What is the expected 
value of investing in this project? If the bank is risk 
neutral, will the bank make this investment?
	 8.	 Steven Levitt and Chad Syverson compared instances of 
home sales in which real estate agents are hired by ­others 
to sell a home to instances in which an agent sells his 
or her own home. They found that homes owned by real 
estate agents sold for 3.7 percent more than other houses 
and stayed on the market 9.5 days longer, everything 
else being equal. How could moral hazard explain these 
results?
	 9.	 Sumo wrestling tournaments typically have 66 wrestlers. 
Each wrestles 15 matches. A wrestler who has a winning 
record (eight wins or more) is guaranteed to rise in the 
official rankings; a wrestler with a losing record falls in 
the rankings. Suppose the last match of a tournament is 
between Wrestler A, who has won eight matches so far, 
and Wrestler B, who has won seven. If moral hazard is a 
serious problem in sumo wrestling, who do you think is 
more likely to win this match?
	10.	 Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, is married 
to the Nobel Prize-winning economist George A. Akerlof. 
When they hired babysitters in the 1980s, they decided 
to pay wages that were higher than the going wage for 
babysitters. If they could get a babysitter at a lower wage, 
what could explain why they decided to pay more?
	11.	 The government wants to reduce white-collar crime.
	
a.	 Suppose for the moment innocent people are never 
wrongly convicted of a crime. Explain why the 
Becker model of crime and punishment suggests that 
we ­increase the fines people pay if they are convicted 
instead of hiring more people to investigate white-
collar crime.
	
b.	 Now suppose that mistakes happen and innocent peo-
ple are sometimes convicted of white-collar crime. 
Why in this case might we want to hire more investi-
gators instead of raising fines? What role does equity 
or fairness play in this case?

As you strain to understand Kepler’s First Law for your as-
tronomy test tomorrow, you can’t resist peeking at your most 
recent eBay struggle. Some guy named “MrBigTime” repeat-
edly tops your bids for a fourth-generation Apple iPod Touch. 
The auction ends at midnight tonight, and you contemplate 
your best strategy going forward—bid aggressively now 
or place a winning bid at the last possible moment (a ploy 
known as “sniping”)? You just cannot get your mind back to 
astronomy. This auction is much too exciting—there’s no time 
to worry about heavenly bodies now.
Anyone who has bid in an auction can relate. Heart 
thumping, palms sweating, auctions seem to bring out 
the animal spirits. Perhaps this is why they have become a normal way of life 
for ­millions of people around the globe who wish to buy, sell, or trade. In 
the United States alone, more than 20 percent of adults participate in online 
­auctions. And they buy and sell all sorts of things. In 2006, a college student 
posted 2 percent of his future earnings for sale on eBay in exchange for the 
highest investment in his college education.
Up until now, we have treated you, the consumer, as a price-taker who pur-
chases what best suits your preferences at the market price (assuming you can 
afford the item). In no way are you able to affect the price you pay—you are just 
one of many consumers. In reality, there are many situations where you do have 
some influence over the price that you pay for goods. On eBay, for example, 
the high bidder wins the item and pays an amount equal to her bid. In markets

KEY IDEAS
Auctions are increasingly used to sell goods and services.
There are four major types of auctions: English, Dutch, sealed bid first 
price and sealed bid second price auctions. Economic theory predicts that 
under certain assumptions they yield identical revenues for the seller.
Bargaining is another frequent way that goods and services are exchanged.
Bargaining power importantly determines the terms of exchange.
where buyers and sellers engage in active bargaining over 
prices, such as for cars, houses, and many home appliances, you 
are an active participant in setting prices by negotiating directly 
with the seller.
In this chapter, we explore the economics behind 
­situations where you, the consumer, can affect the price you 
pay. Once again, optimization will be a key component: you 
will do the best you can within these new economic settings. 
We discuss how you should optimize in such settings—whether 
you should adopt a bid-sniping strategy on eBay, for example, 
or whether you should walk away from a car deal. We also 
examine how these same bargaining principles affect your 
­everyday life, perhaps in ways that you would have never even 
imagined. This pursuit will take us into marriage markets and 
will help us answer a second question: Who determines how 
the household spends its money?
An auction is a market process in which potential buyers bid on a good and the highest 
bidder receives the good. Auctions have a long and storied past. From the slave auctions 
in ancient Egypt to the marriage auctions for brides in Asia Minor to the Praetorian Guard 
auctioning off the Roman Empire in A.D. 193, auctions have been used to allocate goods 
and services for centuries. While auctions have served an important purpose throughout 
history and are now used to sell almost anything one can imagine—vintage wines, fore-
closed homes, pollution permits, baseball cards, and even future streams of people’s in-
comes, as shown in the photograph at the beginning of this chapter—economists have only 
recently come to an understanding of the various auction formats we find in markets today.
Why are some goods auctioned at the highest bid price instead of being sold at posted 
prices like products at Walmart or Home Depot? Put simply, some goods don’t have well-
established prices, making auctions a particularly useful method 
of selling that encourages price discovery. For example, when you 
are thinking of selling a painting given to you by your grandpar-
ents that might be of interest to only a handful of buyers, auction-
ing it off might be a good way of discovering what the appropriate 
price will be and finding the right sort of buyers. In general, it is 
common for goods that are unique, with relatively few buyers, to 
be auctioned. For other goods that are interchangeable and have 
both many sellers and many buyers, price discovery isn’t so much

of an issue. Accordingly, goods such as cans of tuna and peaches typically sell at grocery 
stores with posted prices.
However, with the advent of the Internet, auctions have moved beyond the selling of 
exotic goods with a small number of buyers. It is now easy to find “ordinary” goods such 
as books, golf balls, iPods, and notebooks—goods for which price discovery isn’t the main 
consideration—for sale in auctions every day. For sellers, Internet auctions represent a 
quick way to sell items. No one has quite been able to come up with any single reason as to 
why auctions have become so popular for consumers (although their popularity may have 
reached its peak1). One factor is that auctions can be fun. Many buyers might get a thrill of 
competing for the Apple iPod Touch on eBay, with the possibility of getting a really good 
deal, rather than walking into the Apple store and paying the posted price.
These attractive features have led to tremendous growth in participation in online auc-
tions, as shown in Exhibit 17.1. Just over the last decade, the percent of U.S. adults who 
participate in online auctions has roughly doubled, increasing from 10 percent to more than 
20 percent. And what is sold generates billions of dollars: today more than $300 billion is 
sold annually in auctions.
In this section, we focus on several common auction formats. Across these formats, we 
will keep an eye on how people bid, what prices they pay, and what revenues sellers re-
ceive. You will find that auction analysis helps us understand the formation of markets and 
is an excellent application of game theory, which we presented in Chapter 13.
Let’s begin with some simplifying assumptions. We’ll assume that bidders each have 
their own private valuation of a good—in other words, their own willingness to pay that is 
unknown to other bidders and to the seller. Let’s also assume, for simplicity, that an auc-
tion has five bidders who are interested in bidding on a pair of Oakland 
Raiders National Football League (NFL) football tickets.
They have willingness-to-pay values as given in Exhibit 17.2. Of 
the five bidders, Ashley has the highest willingness to pay for the Raid-
ers tickets: $250. This means that the maximum that Ashley will pay 
for the tickets is $250. The person with the lowest valuation is Eli. He 
is willing to pay $50 for the tickets. Billy, Carol, and Dalton all have 
values in between those of Ashley and Eli. Given these values, we’ll 
now see how our bidders fare in different types of auctions. But be-
fore doing so you might ask: why doesn’t the seller just charge Ashley 
$250 for the Raiders tickets? The answer is that the seller doesn’t know 
Ashley’s willingness to pay (her private valuation), and the auction is 
useful partly because the seller doesn’t need to know this information 
(and this is, of course, related to the price discovery role of auctions).

Types of Auctions
There are many kinds of auctions. For our purposes, auctions can be usefully split along 
two features:
	
1.	 How people place their bids
	
2.	 How price is determined
People typically place their bids by either open outcry or sealed bid.
An open outcry auction is an auction where bids are public and bidders compete ac-
tively against one another. A sealed bid auction is one in which bidders place their bids 
privately so that no other bidder knows the bid of another participant. The second fea-
ture that distinguishes auctions is how price is determined. In some cases, people pay 
what they actually bid. In others, another bidder’s bid—usually the next highest bid—­
determines the price. These two distinctions—how bids are made and the way in which 
price is ­determined—lead to four major auction types:
	
1.	 Open outcry English auctions
	
2.	 Open outcry Dutch auctions
	
3.	 Sealed bid first-price auctions
	
4.	 Sealed bid second-price auctions
In all four cases, we will develop some economic intuition to guide optimal bidding 
­strategies—intuition that will involve a bit of game theory.
Open-Outcry English Auctions
The English auction is probably the auction most familiar to you. This is the “going, go-
ing, gone” kind of auction used at establishments like Sotheby’s when it sells expensive 
paintings and antiques, and what you may have witnessed first-hand at 
estate auctions. An English auction consists of an auctioneer and sev-
eral bidders. The auctioneer begins the bidding process by announc-
ing a low starting bid. From this point on, bidders bid directly against 
each other, and each bid must improve upon the last. When no bidder 
is willing to bid any higher, the bidder with the highest bid pays her 
bid and wins the good. In sum, an English auction is an open-outcry 
auction in which the price increases until there is only one standing 
bid. That bidder wins the item and pays the bid.
You might recognize this format as having features similar to 
many online auctions, such as eBay: bids are shown publicly, and 
price increases until the end of the auction (an “ascending” price 
determination), when the high bidder wins and pays his bid. More 
generally, English auctions are commonly used to sell real estate, 
foreclosed homes, cars, and antiques and are popular to raise money 
for charity.
Optimizing in an English Auction  What should your optimal 
strategy be in an English auction? To answer this question, put yourself 
in Ashley’s shoes as we auction off the pair of Raiders tickets. Say that 
An open outcry auction is an 
auction in which bids are public.
A sealed bid auction is an auction 
in which bids are private so that no 
bidder knows the bid of any other 
participant.
An English auction is an open-
outcry auction in which the price 
increases until there is only one 
standing bid. That bidder wins the 
item and pays his bid.

Chapter 17  |  Auctions and Bargaining
the auctioneer begins at a price of $25 and asks who would like to bid. 
Looking at the values in Exhibit 17.2, we see that Ashley, as well as 
the other four bidders, will bid at this price because each of them has 
a value for the tickets exceeding $25. Therefore, Ashley should bid at 
this price. She does so because as a bidder in this type of auction, she 
is willing to bid up to her value for the object, but no more, because she 
will have to pay her bid if she wins.
Next consider Eli. With the same reasoning as above, he should 
not be willing to bid more than $50 for the Raiders tickets. Therefore, 
when bidding reaches $50, Eli will no longer bid. This is because if 
he bids above $50 and wins, he will lose consumer surplus because he 
only values the tickets at $50. It just doesn’t make sense for Eli to bid 
any amount greater than $50, and he should drop out at $50.
Let’s continue with the bidding process. What happens when the 
price reaches $100? Dalton, who should not bid more than $100, now 
drops out. What about when the bids reach $150? Now Carol stops 
bidding. This process continues until we reach $200. Let’s say that 
­Ashley bids $200 for the Raiders tickets. Does Billy bid? No, because 
he would have to bid higher than $200. He values the tickets at 
$200, so he will not bid any higher. Ashley therefore wins the 
Raiders tickets and pays $200, netting herself $50 in consumer 
surplus ($250 − $200).
What we just observed is a general result in an English auc-
tion: it is a dominant strategy to bid until the price is above your 
value for the item. In Chapter 13, we noted that a dominant strat-
egy is a strategy that gives you the highest payoffs, regardless of 
the other players’ actions. Thus, the dominant strategy equilib-
rium, and also therefore the Nash equilibrium in the English auction, is for everyone to bid 
in this manner.
In equilibrium, the winner will be the highest-value bidder, and she will pay a price 
equal to the second-highest value (or slightly more if the second-highest bidder bids his 
All in all, this empirical evidence 
suggests that it’s probably best to 
spend your time studying astron-
omy, not sniping!

auctions end at a prespecified time, but Amazon​.com 
auctions end when 10 minutes have gone by without a 
bid. This small difference leads to bidders placing lots 
of last-minute bids on eBay auctions—a practice known 
as sniping. Both Web sites offer the option of entering 
a maximum bid and letting a proxy bidding service au-
tomatically place bids in minimum increments until the 
maximum bid is reached, but many eBayers still snipe at 
the last minute.
So just how many more snipe bids do bidders on eBay 
make? Nobel Prize-winning economist Alvin Roth and 
Axel Ockenfels found that 20 percent of individuals place 
their final bids in the last 60 minutes of an eBay auction 
compared to 7 percent of Amazon users.2 They also dis-
covered that in their sample, at least 40 percent of eBay 
auctions had last bids placed in the 5 minutes prior to 
close, with 12 percent in the last 10 seconds!
Do you think that it makes sense to wait until the last 
minute or second to bid?
Research by economists Sean Gray and David Reiley 
provides some insights.3 They explored the benefits of 
eBay sniping with a field experiment. The two econo-
mists ran an experiment in which they themselves placed 
bids on pairs of identical items (such as DVD movies 
and die-cast Hot Wheels cars), placing their maximum 
bid on one item of the pair days before the auction’s 
end and placing the same bid on the other item just 
10 seconds before the auction’s end time. Results from 
70 pairs of objects show no statistically significant ben-
efit to ­sniping, as final prices for the items were approxi-
mately the same.
All in all, this empirical evidence suggests that it’s prob-
ably best to spend your time studying astronomy, not 
sniping! This evidence provides some insight into how 
you should bid in eBay auctions, the topic of our chapter-
opening question.

value exactly—for this example, if Billy had bid $200, then Ashley would have won with 
a bid of $200.01). So in auctioning off the Raiders tickets at an English auction, the seller 
should expect to receive approximately $200 in revenues for the tickets.
Open-Outcry Dutch Auctions
In the seventeenth century, tulip mania hit the Netherlands. In what many consider to be the 
first documented economic bubble, it was widely noted that single tulip bulbs were selling 
for more than 10 times the annual income of daily laborers. At the height of the mania,  
12 acres of land traded for a single bulb. As we might expect, the speculative bubble 
­fostered many creative ways in which tulips were exchanged. Perhaps the most interesting 
was the Dutch auction.
The Dutch auction is also an outcry auction. But one big difference from the English 
auction is that in a Dutch auction the auctioneer begins the bidding at an offer price far 
above any bidder’s value and lowers price in increments until one of the bidders accepts 
the offer. That is, the auction continues in a descending order of values until someone an-
nounces that he is willing to buy at a given price. The first person who accepts at a given 
price wins the auction and pays that price. In this way, the Dutch auction is an open-outcry 
descending price auction, whereas the English auction is an open-outcry ascending price 
auction.
The Dutch auction is probably not very familiar to you, but it continues to be used in 
modern economies. Beyond the tulip auctions in Amsterdam that still thrive today, Dutch 
auctions are used by the Department of the Treasury in the United States to sell securities. 
Even private firms use Dutch auctions: when Google first offered its stock to the public it 
made use of a variation on the Dutch auction: OpenIPO. Likewise, many other firms have 
also used Dutch auctions to repurchase stock shares in their companies.
Optimizing in a Dutch Auction  To consider your optimal strategy in a Dutch auction, 
let’s return to our ticket auction. Let’s say that the auctioneer begins the bidding at a price 
of $500. Would anyone accept that price? Scanning the individual values in Exhibit 17.2, 
we see that none of the five bidders will purchase at this price. The closest is Ashley, but 
because she is only willing to pay $250, she will not bid at a price of $500. If she did, she 
would lose $250 in surplus ($500 − $250). So, because no one buys at $500, after a certain 
period of time the auctioneer lowers his price to $490 . . . then to $480 . . . then to $470, 
and so on.
When will the auction end? Who will win and what will he or she pay?
Deciding how to bid in a Dutch auction is a bit more difficult than in the English 
auction, where you simply bid until the price reaches your maximum willingness to 
pay. To see this, let’s consider Ashley’s decision when the price in the Dutch auction 
reaches $250.
Should she announce that she would like to purchase at this price? If she does, then 
she will win the tickets, but will pay $250. This price will yield zero consumer surplus for 
her ($0 = $250 − $250). Alternatively, she could “let it ride” and not buy at this price. In 
this case, she runs the risk of not winning. Crucially, she does not know the values of the 
other four bidders or how they will bid, so the trade-off facing her is a purchase with zero 
consumer surplus now versus a chance of a higher surplus. Let’s assume she lets the auc-
tion continue.
When no one buys at $250, the auctioneer lowers the price to $240. Now Ashley 
has another decision. She can accept the $240 price and gain $10 in consumer surplus 
($250 − $240) with certainty, or she can wait until a lower price is announced with the 
downside risk of someone else buying before her, which will lead to zero consumer surplus 
for her. What should she do now?
At this point, we need further assumptions to provide guidance to Ashley on her optimal 
bidding strategy. As you might have guessed, one crucial assumption concerns risk prefer-
ences. Recall from Chapter 15 that we refer to people who are neither risk averse nor risk 
seeking as risk neutral. Consider the following bet: a coin is flipped, and if it ends up heads 
A Dutch auction is an open-outcry 
auction in which the price decreases 
until a bidder stops the auction. The 
bidder who stops the auction wins 
the item and pays his bid.
How much would you pay?

you win $10, and if it ends up tails you lose $10. A risk seeker gladly accepts this bet, a 
risk averter declines, and a risk-neutral person is indifferent. Risk neutrality is a convenient 
benchmark for small and moderate stakes, and here we will assume that bidders are risk 
neutral.
So given risk neutrality, when should Ashley jump in with her bid? The higher her 
bid, the lower her surplus, but also the higher the likelihood that she’ll be the first bidder 
and win the Raiders tickets. Given that underlying all of Ashley’s decision making is her 
private value, we can see that in such an auction, the higher her valuation, the more she 
should bid. Another factor should also influence her bidding: the number of bidders com-
peting against her in the auction. If she’s only one of two people in the auction, she can 
take more chances and let the price decrease substantially. But if she is competing with 
several others, then the chances are that somebody else will jump in before her unless she 
bids aggressively.
A simple strategy for Ashley to optimize in this case is to multiply her willingness to 
pay ($250) by the number of competitors (4) divided by the total number of bidders in the 
auction (5). (Under some assumptions, this strategy can be derived as a Nash equilibrium, 
but we do not need to get into these derivations).
Since her willingness to pay is $250, and there are four other bidders (five bidders in 
total), this rule implies that Ashley’s optimal action is to announce “buy” when the price 
reaches $250 × 4/5 = $200. It turns out that this type of strategy is a Nash equilibrium for 
all bidders, meaning that it is a best response for Ashley to do this when others are also using 
the same strategy (bid 4/5 times their own valuation). As a result, in this Nash equilibrium 
we expect Eli, for example, to announce “buy” when the price reaches $40 ($50 × 4/5).
In general, as the number of bidders gets really low—say, just two bidders—you bid 
much less aggressively, which of course makes sense. According to the rule in the previous 
paragraph, Ashley should bid $250 × 1/2 = $125 with two bidders.
In contrast, when the competition intensifies—say, the number of bidders goes to 100—
you bid much closer to your individual value. With the above rule, for example, Ashley will 
bid at $250 × 99/100 = $247.50 with 100 bidders.
If everyone follows this optimizing rule, then in the Dutch auction the bidder with the 
highest value will win the auction and will pay $200. This is because Ashley is the first to 
announce “buy,” and she will do so at $200. She will therefore receive $50 in consumer 
surplus. And the seller of the Raiders tickets receives $200 in revenues.
Interestingly, this is identical to what the seller received in the English auction. Note, 
however, that there is no general rule that the actual payments will be identical between the 
two auctions. For example, if we changed Billy’s valuation in Exhibit 17.2 to $210, then in 
the Dutch auction Ashley would win again and pay $200 (Billy’s strategy would now be to 
bid $210 × 4/5 = $168, but again Ashley will clinch the good at $200 before this happens). 
However, in the English auction, Billy would raise his bid until the price reached $210, and 
thus Ashley would now end up paying more, $210 instead of $200.
But, what is remarkable is that two features are identical in the English and the Dutch 
auction: first, Ashley, who has the highest valuation, wins in both auction types. Second, 
although the actual revenues generated by the two auctions can be different depending on 
the exact valuations of the bidders, it turns out that the expected revenues are the same. 
Think of it this way: if we ran several auctions with many different goods and many dif-
ferent bidders with varying valuations in each auction, on average the revenues that we 
should expect to raise using each auction type are identical. That is, in theory, the English 
and Dutch auctions should raise the same amount of money. We will see next that this is 
actually a much more general phenomenon.
Sealed Bid: First-Price Auction
The two types of auctions we’ve discussed thus far—English and Dutch auctions—are 
known as open-outcry auctions in that they are public in nature. Auctions have also arisen 
in which bidders are allowed to make bids privately. These are known as sealed bid auc-
tions. In sealed bid auctions, all bids are made privately so that each bidder knows only her 
own bid. That is, bidders in this type of auction submit their bids simultaneously without 
knowing the bids of the other auction participants. One example of a popular type of sealed 

17.1
17.2
	
Section 17.1  |  Auctions
429
bid auction is called a sealed bid first-price auction. In a sealed bid first-price auction all 
bidders write down their bids privately on cards and hand them to the auctioneer. The win-
ner is the person who has submitted the highest bid; this person wins the item and pays a 
price equal to her bid.
Optimizing in a Sealed Bid First-Price Auction  Let’s now return to the auction for 
the Raiders tickets (again with the values given in Exhibit 17.2). How should Ashley bid 
in this type of auction? She will not bid more than $250, because she would lose consumer 
surplus if she were to win with a bid above $250—for example, if she bids $275 and wins, 
she would realize a $25 loss because the price she pays ($275) is $25 higher than her value 
for the tickets. So is $250 her optimal bid? That will certainly give her the best chance of 
winning. But, even if she does win, she’ll receive zero consumer surplus because she is 
paying her maximum willingness to pay. So should she perhaps think about bidding a bit 
lower? If so, how much lower?
Notice that the trade-off here is exactly the same one Ashley faced in the Dutch auction: 
a lower bid is less likely to win, but she receives more consumer surplus if she does win. So 
you may not be surprised to learn that the optimal bidding strategy in a sealed bid first-price 
auction is the same as that of the Dutch auction.
Therefore, Ashley’s optimizing strategy is to submit a bid of $200, or 4/5 of her willing-
ness to pay ($250). The other bidders should use similar strategies when submitting their 
bids. For example, Eli should submit a bid of $40 ($40 = $50 × 4/5). The equilibrium in 
the sealed bid first-price auction is for everyone to bid in this manner. Provided everyone 
does so, no one benefits from changing her bid.
Thus, the seller of the Raiders tickets again receives $200 in revenues, and Ashley 
­receives $50 in consumer surplus.
Sealed Bid: Second-Price Auction
Collectible markets represent one of the most vibrant venues where auctions flourish. 
Whether antiques, baseball cards, comic books, pins, or Star Wars memorabilia, avid collec-
tors around the globe have hundreds of opportunities daily to bid in auctions to bolster their 
collections. The market for stamps represents perhaps the oldest and most robust collectors 
market. Today, at any given time, eBay has thousands of active stamp auctions. But, the 
number of auctions was not always that large. The hobby of stamp collecting began in ear-
nest in the 1850s. The first 100 stamp auctions took place from 1870 to 1882, most of them 
in New York City. In the 1890s, such auctions became common, with over 2,000 auctions 
held worldwide by 1900.
These auctions were typically run using English auction rules. However, many indi-
viduals from outside of town wished to bid in the auctions. Accommodations were soon 
made to such individuals who wished to bid without having to travel to the auction in 
person. For example, an 1878 stamp auction catalogue reads that “out-of-town collec-
tors may have equal facilities for purchasing with city collectors, bids may be sent to the 
­auctioneers . . . who will . . . represent their bids the same as though they were personally 
present, and without charge.” In those cases where all city bid offerings were lower than 
the highest mailed-in bid, the highest mail bidder won and paid the second-highest bid. The 
sealed bid second-price auction was born!
Modern sealed bid second-price auctions share many similarities to the 1878 stamp 
auction. For instance, much like sealed bid first-price auctions, all bidders write down 
their bids privately and hand them to the auctioneer. The winner is the person who has 
submitted the highest bid. The major difference between the first- and second-price auc-
tions arises when it comes time to pay for the good. In sealed bid second-price auctions, 
the highest bidder pays a price equal to the second-­highest bid. Why this seemingly arbi-
trary rule?
Optimizing in a Sealed Bid Second-Price Auction  To discover the logic behind 
this type of auction, we consider our optimal bidding strategy in a sealed bid second-
price auction for the Raiders tickets. A key consideration is that if you win in this type of 
auction, you do not pay your bid but rather pay the second-highest bid. This situation is 
much different from the other three auction formats discussed above, in which you always

pay your bid. In particular, the main reason why Ashley did not bid $250 in the first-price 
auction was because to do so guaranteed her zero consumer surplus.
Should Ashley now bid more than $250 because that will increase her chances of win-
ning? This might make sense because she will only have to pay the second-highest bid. Or 
maybe she should bid less than $250.
You might be surprised to learn that in this auction, it is a dominant strategy to bid ex-
actly your willingness to pay for the item. Let’s see why bidding $250 is a dominant strat-
egy for Ashley in this case. We’ll do this in two steps: first, we’ll see why Ashley should 
not overbid (that is, why she shouldn’t bid more than $250), and then we’ll see why she 
should not bid lower than $250.
Why shouldn’t Ashley bid more than $250?
Suppose that, between Billy, Carol, Dalton, and Eli, Billy has the highest bid at $200. 
Suppose also that Ashley bids $100 more than her value, that is, $350 instead of her true 
value of $250. In this case, Ashley wins and pays $200 (the second-highest bid). But you 
will also recognize that in this case, Ashley would have done just as well by bidding her 
true value of $250: she would have won and once again paid $200. In fact, this will be the 
case whenever the second-highest bid in the auction is below $250: a $250 bid from Ashley 
does just as well as a bid above $250.
But next consider the case in which Billy bids $300. Now, bidding $350, Ashley again 
wins the auction, but she will have to pay the second-highest bid, which is Billy’s $300. 
Uh oh! Ashley now has won the tickets but has to pay $300 for them, which is $50 more 
than her valuation of $250. Not a good deal. If, instead, she had just bid her true valuation, 
$250, she would have let Billy win, which is preferable from Ashley’s viewpoint given 
Billy’s bid.
This reasoning shows that both Ashley and Billy are better off bidding their valuations, 
because by overbidding they risk ending up with the tickets at a price that leads to negative 
consumer surplus.
This is a general result: any time you bid above your value in a sealed bid second-price 
auction, you expose yourself to losses at no gain. There is no gain because if you win when 
you do not want to win, you will pay too much. Alternatively, if when bidding your value 
you win the auction, bidding above your true value has no gain.
What about bidding below your value? We turn to this next.
Why shouldn’t Ashley bid less than $250?
Let’s start by assuming that Ashley bids $100 below her value—a bid of $150 instead of 
her valuation of $250—but that the highest bid from the others comes from Billy, with a bid 
of $200. In this case, Billy wins the auction and pays the second-highest bid ($150). Ashley 
should have won the auction because she has the highest value. In fact, if she had bid her 
value of $250, she would have won and paid the second-highest bid, $200, and secured a 
surplus of $50 for herself. So by underbidding, she has just lost out on $50 in surplus. It is 
clear that bidding below her value hurt her in this case.
What if all the other bids were much lower? For example, suppose that the highest bid 
from the others is $100. Is Ashley then better off bidding lower than her value in this case? 
No. Now, Ashley wins and pays the second-highest bid ($100). Note that Ashley would 
have done just as well by bidding her value of $250: she would have won and paid $100 
either way. So in this case, bidding below her value would have had no benefit for Ashley. 
This, too, is a general result: any time you bid below your value in a second-price auction, 
you gain nothing and you risk not getting the good even though it is selling below your 
valuation.
These two examples highlight a general economic principle: in a sealed bid second-
price auction, a person should bid his value. This is a dominant strategy—you cannot do 
better by using any other strategy. Since bidding their values is a dominant strategy for 
all players in the second-price auction, this also means that bidding their values is a Nash 
equilibrium (and also a dominant strategy equilibrium).
This leads to a somewhat surprising set of insights. In all four auctions the 
winner is the bidder with the highest valuation. Moreover, all four auctions have 
the same expected revenue. So, in all of these cases, Ashley wins the tickets and  

17.1

Section 17.1  |  Auctions
431
pays $200, and the seller receives $200 in revenues and Ashley receives $50 in 
­consumer surplus.
The Revenue Equivalence Theorem
Exhibit 17.3 summarizes the four major auction formats from the perspectives of bid-
ders and sellers (for the valuations given in Exhibit 17.2). It highlights that in all four 
cases, the bidder with the highest value (Ashley) wins, and 
also, given the valuations in Exhibit 17.2, she pays $200 for the 
tickets. Though, as already noted, it is not necessarily the case 
that each auction format will always generate exactly the same 
revenue, the result is that they will generate the same expected 
revenue. This is in fact the essence of a general result known 
as the revenue equivalence theorem: the four major auction 
types will, in expectation, raise the same amount of money for 
the auctioneer.
William Vickrey, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, was the first to point out that dif-
ferent auction formats yielded identical expected revenue outcomes under certain assump-
tions.4 Applying game theory to the study of auctions, Vickrey went even further to develop 
the following insights, which our discussion so far illustrates:
	
1.	 Bidders should view Dutch auctions and sealed bid first-price auctions in the same 
way: that is, a bidder in the Dutch auction should wait until the price falls to the 
exact amount she would have bid if she had been participating in a sealed bid first-
price auction. This is why our bidding strategy for these two auction types is identi-
cal. In this sense, your strategy is the same whether you are bidding in a Dutch or a 
sealed bid first-price auction.
	
2.	 In both the English auction and the sealed bid second-price auction, dominant 
strategies are at work. For the English auction, it is a dominant strategy to bid 
up until the price reaches your maximum willingness to pay for the good. As a 
result, the highest-value bidder wins the auction and pays a price equal to the 
second-highest bid (which is the second-highest bidder’s value). Your strategy 
as a bidder in a sealed bid second-price auction is similar: you have a dominant 
strategy to bid your value. If everyone follows his dominant strategy, the highest 
bidder will pay a price equal to the second-highest bid (which is the second-
highest bidder’s value).
You might be thinking: this is all well and good in theory, but what actually happens in 
practice when all of the assumptions of the theory are not guaranteed to hold? We turn to 
that question next.
The revenue equivalence theorem 
states that under certain assumptions 
the four auction types are expected 
to raise the same revenues.
Exhibit 17.3 Summary of Revenue Determination in the Four Auction Types
Here, we summarize the results of our four auction types. We also see that all four 
auctions generate a revenue of $200. Though the exact revenue generated by 
these auction types could differ, the revenue equivalence theorem guarantees that 
all four auctions lead to the same expected revenue.

Evidence-Based Economics
E
mpirical tests of auction theory have been conducted pri-
marily through the use of laboratory experiments. These 
experiments mainly test for the revenue equivalence we de-
scribed above of the four auction formats—that is, they are con-
ducted to answer the question, “Do all four auction forms yield 
the same revenue for the auctioneer?” These experiments also test 
whether individual bidders follow the strategies that we have just 
discussed.
In a creative study, economist David Reiley ran auctions on 
the Internet to test whether real-world bidding behavior follows 
the predictions of auction theory.5 To do so, Reiley purchased 
over $2,000 of Magic cards—a collectible card game—and re-
sold them via the four auction formats on the Internet. His basic 
procedure was to auction two copies of the same card in two dif-
ferent auction formats in order to make direct comparisons of the 
revenue earned in each one.
For example, he purchased two Chandra (one of the two chief wizards) playing cards, 
and auctioned one in a Dutch auction and the other in a sealed bid first-price auction. Like-
wise, he purchased two Jace (the other chief wizard) cards, and auctioned one in an English 
auction and one in a sealed bid second-price auction. This approach ensured that when he 
compared revenues and bids across the two auction formats—say, the Dutch auction and 
the sealed bid first-price auction—his goods were identical, thus permitting a clean test of 
auction theory.
A first test of consistency with the revenue equivalence theorem is that, for a given 
playing card (Chandra), the average revenue raised in a Dutch auction (which proxies 
for expected revenue to which the revenue equivalence theorem applies) should be the 
same as the average revenue raised in a sealed bid first-price auction. Recall that in our 
discussion, these two auction types encouraged the same bidding strategy (depending on 
the number of competing bidders) and led to the same expected revenue. Alternatively, 
this would mean that the difference between the amount of revenue that a Chandra earns 
in a Dutch auction and the revenue that same card earns in a sealed bid first-price auc-
tion should be zero. Reiley tested the above equivalence with matched pairs of identical 
cards.
In Reiley’s experiment, it turns out that on average across all of his auctions, the dif-
ference in revenue is greater than zero. He found that he could expect to earn $0.32 more 
selling the card through a Dutch auction than through a sealed bid first-price auction. Given 
that the cards sold for roughly $4.50 on average, this difference is noteworthy.
Similarly, Reiley used matched pairs of identical Magic cards to see if revenue from 
an English auction was equivalent to revenue from a sealed bid second-price auction. 
Here, he found that there were not significant differences between bidding in an ­English 
auction and a sealed bid second-price auction, consistent with the revenue equivalence 
theorem.
Thus, in the case of these Magic card auction experiments, our bidding theory holds up 
pretty well in the outcomes for the English and sealed bid second-price auctions, but it is a 
little off on the comparison between the Dutch and sealed bid first-price auctions. Before 
advancing a win or loss for auction theory, much more work is necessary. Even as you read 
this passage, the debate rages on concerning how well auction theory predicts behavior in 
the field.

The field is evolving, with 
both experimental data and 
naturally occurring data 
lending insights into how 
well auction theory explains 
real behavior.
So far in this chapter, we have focused on markets where buyers compete with one an-
other to buy a good. Sellers are passive in the sense that once they choose the auction for-
mat, they sit back and watch people fight it out. A different form of exchange is bilateral 
bargaining (or bilateral negotiation, as we discussed in Chapter 7). Bilateral bargaining 
is a form of exchange that has one seller actively negotiating with one buyer over the 
terms of trade. If you have ever used the “best offer” option on eBay, you are experi-
enced at bilateral bargaining. Or if you have visited a flea market, you know something 
about bilateral bargaining—the exhilaration of a bustling marketplace where merchants 
offer their goods and services to shoppers looking for the thrill of the “deal.” If you are 
a skilled bargainer, you know this thrill very well—the feeling of haggling and winding 
up with a great price.
Bilateral bargaining has constituted the foundation of markets for centuries—from 
Athen’s Agora to Rome’s Forum to the medieval fairs and markets in England to the 
1,000-year-old souk in Morocco. Today, there are substantial bazaars and flea mar-
kets that litter the landscape of developed and developing countries alike. Although 
it is difficult to provide an economic estimate of the importance of such markets, 
the National Flea Market Association reports that the number of flea markets in the 
United States and the recorded gross sales have grown substantially over the past 
several years, with more than 2 million licensed vendors and more than $30 billion 
in sales annually. This is surely a vast underestimate, however, because a nontrivial 
portion of the transactions are carried out by nonlicensed vendors via nontaxed sales. 
More broadly, such markets are of great importance, especially in developing coun-
tries where the institution represents an integral part of the allocation of goods and 
services in the formal market.
What Determines Bargaining Outcomes?
You might wonder in bargaining situations who has the upper hand—why, for example, do 
some sellers always seem to get great prices, while in other cases, buyers seem to get the 
better deals.

As you might have guessed, much of it comes down to the benefits and costs inher-
ent in the potential exchange. In bargaining terms, the most important element that 
determines final outcomes is called bargaining power. Two principles—the cost of 
failing to come to an agreement and the influence of one partner on the other—are gen-
erally used to describe the bargaining power of each partner engaged in bargaining. For 
instance, if your influence over the other agent increases, then your bargaining power 
increases. But, if your cost of not coming to an agreement increases, then your bargain-
ing power goes down.
Let’s put this intuition to work with an example. Say that for months you have been 
desperately trying to find a part-time job. The local economy continues to sputter, so 
no one near campus is hiring. But, suddenly a job is posted that fits your desires per-
fectly. The firm—Caribou Coffee—advertises that it needs just one person. But when 
you arrive to apply, you find yourself in a line of 500 people who are also interested in 
the position.
After the initial screening, you find yourself in a final pool of ten applicants. Manage-
ment interviews you again and finds you to be an attractive candidate, but you know that 
chances are the other nine are equally qualified. Near the end of the interview, they ask you 
what wage would be needed for you to accept the job. How should you respond?
You should begin by asking yourself who has the bargaining power in this situation. 
First, you realize that you have little influence over Caribou Coffee—it can hire any of the 
other nine applicants, who seemingly are equally qualified and are thus perfect substitutes 
for you. Second, the cost to you of not coming to an agreement is quite high—you have 
been trying to find a job for months, and finally the perfect fit is here. But Caribou has a 
very low cost of not coming to an agreement with you because there are several applicants 
seeking this job.
You have now decided that you have little bargaining power in this case. This means 
that Caribou Coffee can offer the minimum wage and little in the way of employee benefits 
should it be so inclined. So, because it seems that you are at Caribou’s mercy, you conclude 
that you should let them know that your compensation demands are minimal.
What could change in this example that would give you more bargaining power? 
Let’s assume that a new Walmart locates in your town, bringing hundreds of jobs to the 
local community. Now bargaining power has changed since your outside options have 
improved. Thanks to the presence of a new potential employer, you are less inclined 
to settle for a low wage package from Caribou, and when asked what wage you will 
need, you are thus likely to be bolder because it is no longer as costly for you to fail 
to come to an agreement with Caribou: there’s a real possibil-
ity that you can obtain a similar job at Walmart. You also have 
more influence over Caribou because now the number of other 
workers competing for that job decreases because Walmart will 
employ many people in the local community.
As you can see, bargaining power relates to “who holds the 
chips” or who has the power in the negotiations. The person who 
has, first, a lower cost of not coming to an agreement and, sec-
ond, a greater influence over the other person, has the bargain-
ing power and “holds the chips.” In turn, bargaining power helps 
to determine whether, and at what terms, the parties transact.
Bargaining in Action: The Ultimatum Game
How can we go about testing whether economic models can predict what will happen 
in bargaining situations? If a person with no bargaining power meets a person with 
much greater bargaining power, will the result be as predicted: the person with no 
bargaining power gets nothing? One way to test this conjecture is to use a laboratory 
experiment.
As a college student, you may already have been recruited by a mass e-mail from 
your school’s economics or psychology department, asking you to participate in a labo-
ratory experiment. It might have even been for the game that we now examine—the 
Ultimatum Game.
Bargaining power relates to “who 
holds the chips.” The person who 
has . . . a lower cost of not coming 
to an agreement and . . . a greater 
influence over the other person . . . 
holds the chips.
Bargaining power describes the 
relative power an individual has in 
negotiations with another individual.

In this game, half of the subjects (Proposers) are given some amount of money—say, 
$10—and they are paired with a person (Responder) who receives nothing. The game con-
sists of two decisions, one to be made by those playing the role of Proposers and the other 
by those playing the role of Responders. Each proposer chooses how much of their $10 
to offer the Responder. Each Responder then decides whether to accept or reject the offer. 
An acceptance leads to the proposed allocation taking place, and a rejection leads to both 
players walking away with zero. Exhibit 17.4 displays the game.
If you were a Proposer, how much would you choose to offer?
We can make use of game theory to find an answer. As explained in Chapter 13, this is 
an extensive-form game and you can use backward induction to determine how you should 
play. That is, you can work backwards from the Responder’s optimal actions to find out 
how you should play.
So let’s start at the last nodes of the game tree in Exhibit 17.4 and consider the second 
mover, the Responder. Suppose she receives an offer of 10 cents. If she says no, she’ll get 0  
and if she says yes she’ll receive the 10 cents. Assuming that she prefers more money to 
less, it will be in her best interest to accept the offer. You’ll see that this reasoning applies 
to any positive offer, so any amount the Proposer chooses to offer, the Responder is likely to 
accept. By backward induction, you understand that the Responder will accept any positive 
offer and arrive at the conclusion that your optimal offer is the lowest possible amount—
say, one penny. Thus the equilibrium in the Ultimatum Game takes a simple form: the 
Proposer offers the lowest amount possible to the Responder, and the Responder accepts 
that offer. As we discussed in Chapter 13, this game has therefore a first-mover advantage.
This equilibrium might strike you as a bad deal for the Responder. As the Responder, 
you have no bargaining power; the Proposer has all of the chips. But the arrangement still 
doesn’t seem quite right to you—if it only costs you a penny to reject the offer of the Pro-
poser, why not reject it because the proposed split is not fair?
In fact, experimental evidence suggests that such low offers are often rejected. Indeed, 
Proposers seem to sense that their low offers won’t fly, so they rarely offer the paltry figure 
of just one penny. Instead, their optimal offer is determined by how much they fear a rejec-
tion (and ultimately winding up with nothing).
So is this outcome a rejection of the bargaining model? No. It just tells us that something 
else beyond money—such as fairness—is also important to people. We return to a discus-
sion of fairness and other social preferences in Chapter 18.
More important to the bargaining model are two observations from the vast experimental 
data. First, Proposers, who have more bargaining power than Responders in the Ultimatum  
Game, because they hold a first-mover advantage, usually end up with more than half 
($5) of the $10 when bargains are struck (when Responders accept their offer). In games 
executed all over the world, Proposers in general end up with $6 or so, providing evidence 
that the person with the greater bargaining power does walk away with more of the spoils.
Exhibit 17.4 The Ultimatum Game
The game begins with the Proposer’s decision. 
The Proposer can offer any amount from $0 to $10, 
which we represent as a smooth curve between $0 
and $10 in the exhibit. Once the Proposer makes 
a decision ($x in the exhibit), that decision is con-
veyed to the Responder as the Proposer’s offer. 
Now, the Responder decides whether to accept the 
offer (pocketing $x and leaving the Proposer with 
$10 − x) or to reject the offer (leaving both players 
with $0).

Second, information can importantly determine which player “holds the chips” in bar-
gaining. For example, there is a variant of the Ultimatum Game in which the Proposer 
knows exactly how much money there is to split, and the Responder does not know this. 
What do experiments show in these cases where the Proposer has more information and 
thus “holds the chips”? The Proposer’s gains are much closer to the entire $10.
In practice, many other factors other than being the first mover determine bargaining 
power. Some agents will have a reputation for being a tough bargainer, and this will natu-
rally increase their bargaining power. For example, if you know that the Responder has a 
reputation for never accepting anything less than $8, you may just give up and offer her $8, 
settling with just $2 yourself. In other situations, how badly you need the good in question 
will determine your bargaining power. For instance, if you are bargaining with a used-car 
salesman, and he knows that you need the car immediately for a cross-country trip starting 
tomorrow morning, you won’t have much bargaining power. He can then get away with 
charging you a high price because he knows that your demand is price-inelastic. If, on the 
other hand, he knows that you have already searched and found other good deals and you 
do not need the car urgently, this will increase your bargaining power and induce him to 
give you a good deal because you are price-elastic.
Bargaining and the Coase Theorem
Another interesting application of bargaining ties us back to lessons from a previous chap-
ter. You may recall the Coase Theorem from Chapter 9. This theorem states that with cer-
tain assumptions in place, two agents can always bargain to reach the efficient outcome.
Where might this theorem apply? In addition to the situations we considered in ­Chapter 9 
(which arose to solve the problem of externalities), the Coase Theorem has particular rel-
evance in the field of law. Divorce law is one such area.
In some countries and U.S. states such as Mississippi and Tenessee, divorce is illegal 
without the consent of both partners in a marriage (unless there are grounds for “fault 
­divorces”); in others, such as California and Virginia, people have the right to get a divorce 
whether their partner likes it or not. We’ll term the first case “need two to divorce” and the 
second case “need only one to divorce.” Now consider the question: within a state, should 
a change from “need two to divorce” to “need one to divorce”—in effect, making getting a 
divorce easier—­increase divorce rates?
The Coase Theorem implies that the answer should be no. To see why, imagine a marriage 
in which one partner (Adam) wants a divorce and the other (Barb) does not. Of course, hap-
piness in marriage cannot just be measured in money. But we can attach a monetary value to 
the strength of Adam and Barb’s feelings, and the happiness they will get from marriage, by 
considering how much they would sacrifice in order to obtain a divorce (Adam’s case) and 
avoid a divorce (Barb’s case). Suppose this is $5,000 for Adam and $10,000 for Barb.
Let’s first consider the case where Adam and Barb reside in a state with the less stringent 
“need one to divorce” laws. Here, only one person is required to initiate the divorce, and hence 
the one partner wanting the divorce (Adam) is legally decisive and holds the marriage rights. 
Therefore, the distribution of bargaining power under these laws favors 
Adam. But, recall that Barb values the marriage more than Adam values 
the divorce. So according to the Coase Theorem, we should expect that 
Barb will pay Adam to prevent a divorce from taking place. More specifi-
cally, Barb will prevent Adam from initiating a divorce by paying some 
amount between $5,000 ­(Adam’s value of getting a divorce) and $10,000 
(Barb’s maximum value for staying married). Of course, in reality, this 
payment may not take the form of actual money changing hands. It may 
be that Adam does fewer household chores or dictates how the money the 
couple has in the bank is spent. The important thing is that the marriage 
can be saved by certain transfers from Barb to Adam. And notably, with 
such a deal, both Adam and Barb are better off—Adam receives a transfer 
that is above the $5,000 value of divorce, and Barb keeps the marriage 
alive for less than $10,000.
What about in a “need two to divorce” state? The answer is no di-
vorce once again. In this case, Barb is legally decisive and holds the mar-
riage rights and thus has more bargaining power. As it stands, Adam’s 
Economics extends everywhere, even to divorce.

value from divorce is low relative to Barb’s value from marriage. To arrange a divorce, 
Adam would need to compensate Barb (to get Barb to agree) with more than $10,000 (for 
­example, offering alimony). Given that Adam only values the divorce at $5,000, the divorce 
will never take place in this case either. Thus, we see that no matter whose side the law falls 
on, the decision to get a divorce does not change. Importantly, note that while the identity 
of the legally decisive partner changes depending on the law, it is always the ­economically 
advantaged partner—meaning the partner who values marriage or divorce more—that 
­determines the final outcome, giving a deeper insight behind what it means, in bargaining, 
to “hold the chips.” Note also that at no point did it matter how much larger Barb’s value  
is than Adam’s—this example works just the same if we replace $10,000 with $5,001.
But there is an important implication of the divorce laws: because they determine the 
distribution of bargaining power, they have an impact on how the gains from the efficient 
outcome are divided. In one case Adam receives transfers from Barb to keep the marriage 
alive, in the other case he doesn’t. So the Coase Theorem in general implies that whether a 
particular relationship remains active and agreement is reached doesn’t depend on who has 
the rights to make the decision in the first place, but the distribution of the gains from this 
relationship depends very much on the initial allocation of rights.
Exhibit 17.5 summarizes our discussion and shows that an efficient outcome arises no 
matter how lawyers and judges decide to construct divorce rights.
Try the opposite case for yourself, imagining that the happy partner values the marriage 
only at $5,000, while the unhappy partner values divorce at $10,000. You will again find 
that the divorce rate is identical—in this case, they will get divorced under both laws! Do 
you think that the data conform to these predictions?
Exhibit 17.5 The Coase 
Theorem in Action
Provided the assumptions of 
the Coase Theorem hold and 
Barb values marriage more 
than Adam values divorce, no 
divorce will take place under 
either set of divorce laws.
Case
Outcome
Divorce requires consent of  
both partners
The partner who values divorce at $5,000 (Adam) is not 
willing to pay the partner who values marriage at $10,000 
(Barb) enough to buy divorce.
Result: No divorce.
Divorce requires consent of  
one partner
The partner who values marriage at $10,000 (Barb) pays the 
partner who does not (Adam) an amount above $5,000 and 
below $10,000.
Result: No divorce.
 
Evidence-Based Economics
D
o you ever wonder how your life will unfold after college? Perhaps 
you will find a high-paying job, marry, and have three kids. Maybe, 
instead, you will have three kids with a spouse who has a high-­
paying job. Perhaps these two cases seem identical—you might be saying to 
yourself, “Who cares about who makes the money, as long as we have it?” 
Such thinking implicitly assumes what economists call a unitary model: a 
dollar in the pocket of one spouse is the same as a dollar in the pocket of the 
other. In consumption terms, this means that the family maximizes its happi-
ness under a budget constraint that pools all of its income, wealth, and time.
Is this model a correct depiction of reality? For example, in a unitary 
model, if the husband in a household won $500 playing the lottery, the 
household would buy all of the same goods and services as it would if the wife had 
instead won the lottery.

If we instead think of the household decisions as determined by a bargaining game, how 
will things change? Recall the two important features underlying bargaining power—the 
cost of failing to come to an agreement and the influence of one partner on another. In 
terms of the first feature, a low-income husband may have a great deal to lose if his high-
income wife decides to divorce him—an outcome that may occur if the couple fails to agree 
on how to spend their earnings. However, if the husband receives an unexpected windfall of 
income, he may suddenly find his bargaining power increase significantly. Consequently, 
we would expect that after the windfall gain of the husband, spending in this household 
would be more aligned with the husband’s preferences.
Economists have studied the bargaining power hypothesis by examining data from 
a unique natural experiment in the United Kingdom (UK).6 In the late 1970s, the UK 
changed the form of its universal child benefit program. Before the change, men in the 
household received the child benefit dollars. After the change, receipt of the benefit income 
shifted from fathers to mothers in two-parent families.
What do you think they found happened after the change? The authors compared house-
hold spending before and after the tax law change and found that after the change there was a 
dramatic shift toward increased expenditures on women’s and children’s clothing relative to 
men’s clothing. These expenditure items are commonly known to be driven by women’s pref-
erences. So when bargaining power shifted, so did the consumption patterns of the household.
A related study finds similar but much more consequential patterns. Economist Nancy 
Qian studied how mortality and education patterns changed when prices for tea and or-
chards changed in China.7 The changes in the rigid central planning institutions that started 
being reformed after the death of Chairman Mao brought a significant increase in the price 
of tea, which is generally produced by women in China. These changes also altered the 
price of orchard products, which generally rely on male labor. These changes provided 
Qian with information that she could use to test the role of bargaining power.
Interestingly, depending on which commodity had a significant price change in the local 
area, children in the households under study had quite different outcomes. For example, 
Qian found that an increase in the value of tea improved female survival rates—meaning 
that female children were much more likely to live longer after the price of tea increased. 
Moreover, price increases in tea influenced educational attainment of both boys and girls by 
about 0.2 years (in many countries women value their kid’s education more highly than men 
value their kids’ education). Alternatively, increasing male income (through increases in the 
value of orchard products) by the same amount actually decreased educational attainment 
of girls and had no effect on the educational attainment of boys. The likely explanation is 
that women care much more about the health and education of their children than their hus-
bands do, and when they earn more, they are able to spend more to improve these outcomes.
Both of these studies provide empirical evidence of the power of the bargaining model. 
The lesson here is that you should always be aware of bargaining power, even in situations 
where you least expect it to matter—as in the household buying decision!

Above we discussed how female bargaining power can arise 
from additional income and favorable price changes. Another 
potential channel for increasing female bargaining power is 
the sex ratio—the ratio of men to women in a population. The 
intuition is that as the sex ratio rises, women become relatively 
more scarce and therefore will have greater bargaining power.
In order to establish this relationship empirically, John 
List and two colleagues surveyed households in China 
with high and low shares of ethnic minorities.8
Sex ratios vary across ethnicities in China because the 
one-child policy, which restricted families to a single child, 
did not apply as strictly to China’s ethnic minorities. The 
one-child policy, when it applies, creates a more distorted 
sex ratio. For this reason, holding all else equal, it is likely 
that the sex ratio in areas with low shares of ethnic minorities 
is higher than areas with high shares of ethnic minorities.
Upon identifying these areas, List and colleagues ran-
domly surveyed households with a three-part survey. First, 
all members were asked to record their subjective opinion 
of their importance in the household. The second com-
ponent asked about who handles household finances (an 
objective measure of bargaining power). Lastly, they had 
each person participate in an experiment wherein they 
split money between the household and a charity in China. 
For this last component, each person ­received 100 yuan 
to make a decision (in private). Then, the exercise was re-
peated, but as a collective decision of the household.
Their results suggest that in areas where sex ratios 
are higher, female bargaining power is stronger in that 
women report more decision-making power, are more 
likely to handle household finances, and are more likely 
to have the collective allocation choice match their pri-
vate choice. This evidence complements the data from 
the labor markets we have discussed and shows the im-
portance of using economics to understand what hap-
pens in the household.

Summary
In many cases the interaction of buyers and sellers has a role in determining 
the price of the item being traded. For this reason, studying auctions and bilateral 
bargaining expands our understanding of how resources are allocated.
There are four common auctions: English, Dutch, and sealed bid ­first- and  
second-price auctions. Though these auctions work very differently and opti-
mizing behaviors vary considerably across them, under certain assumptions the 
outcomes they yield have some remarkable similarities. In particular, with all of 
these auction formats, the buyer with the highest valuation wins the item being 
auctioned, and the expected revenue of the seller is the same.
Bargaining power of an individual—who “holds the chips” in bargaining—is 
critical in determining whether, and at what price, the trade will take place.
In situations where the Coase Theorem applies, the distribution of bargaining 
power will not affect whether the efficient outcome is reached, but will determine 
how the gains from this outcome are divided.

Problems
	 1.	 An escalation clause in a real estate contract specifies 
what a prospective buyer will offer for a home if the seller 
receives multiple offers. An escalation clause typically 
includes three elements:
•	 The buyer’s initial offer
•	 How much that offer will rise above any other competi-
tive bid
•	 The maximum amount the buyer will offer in case of 
multiple offers
	
	 So, for example, an escalation clause might state that a 
buyer is offering $200,000 for a home and that the buyer 
will bid $1,000 more than other offers up to a maximum 
of $250,000.
	
	 Suppose you are willing to pay up to $300,000 for a house 
that is for sale. You decide to include an escalation clause 
in the contract. What is the maximum amount you should 
specify in the contract that you will pay if the seller re-

	 3.	 The original Filene’s Basement in Boston had a unique 
pricing system. Every article in the store was marked with 
a tag showing the price and the date the article was first 
put on sale. Twelve days later, if it had not been sold, the 
price was reduced by 25 percent. Six selling days later, it 
was cut by 50 percent, and after an additional six days, it 
was offered at 75 percent off the original price. After six 
more days, it was given to charity if it had not been sold.
	
a.	 Was the Filene plan similar to any of the auctions we 
studied in this chapter?
	
b.	 Suppose you are interested in a coat you have seen in 
a store that uses the same pricing system as Filene’s 
Basement. (“The Basement” closed its doors in 2011.) 
The initial price is $200. You are willing to pay as much 
as $150. Could it be optimal to buy the coat when the 
price is reduced to $150? Could it be optimal to wait 
six days and try to buy the coat when the price is re-
duced to $100? Could it be optimal to wait 12 days and 
try to buy the coat when the price is reduced to $50?
	 4.	 A town wants to build a new bridge. Construction firms will 
submit sealed bids. The town will award the contract to the 
firm that submits the lowest bid and will pay the firm the 
amount of the second lowest bid, that is, the town will con-
duct a second-price procurement auction. So, for example, if 
Firm A bids $8 million, Firm B bids $9 million, and Firm C 
bids $10 million, then the city will award the contract to Firm 
A (it submitted the lowest bid) and pay Firm A $9 million 
(the amount of the second-lowest bid). Suppose your firm is 
willing to build the bridge for a minimum of $9 million.
	
a.	 Show that bidding $9 million is a better strategy than bid-
ding some amount below $9 million—say, $7 million.
	
b.	 Show that bidding $9 million is a better strategy than bid-
ding some amount above $9 million—say, $11 million.

c.	 Should you bid $950 if the Treasury is using a

	 6.	 Consider the auction for a dollar where there are two 
bidders. Each bidder can bid 5 cents or multiples of  
5 cents each time. The dollar will go to the bidder with the 
highest bid, but the second-highest bidder will also have 
to pay his bid to the auctioneer. The auction ends when 
neither player wants to make a higher bid or the bidding 
reaches $2, whichever occurs first. Explain how one of the 
bidders could pay more than one dollar for a one-­dollar 
bid. Can you find the Nash equilibrium in this game?
	 7.	 The owners’ and the players’ union are negotiating over a 
contract for the upcoming hockey season. In October, the 
owners will make an offer to the union. If they reach an 
agreement, they will share $50 of revenues. So, for exam-
ple, if the owners offer the players $10 in October and the 
players accept, then the players receive $10 and the owners 
keep the remaining $40. If the players reject the offer, then 
they go on strike and negotiations resume in November. In 
November, the players will make an offer to the owners. If 
they reach an agreement, they will share just $20 of rev-
enues (revenues have fallen because of the strike). So, for 
example, if the players offer the owners $10 in November 
and the owners accept, then the owners receive $10 and the 
players keep the remaining $10. If the owners reject the 
November offer, then the strike continues for the rest of  
the season and the players and the owners both receive zero.
	
a.	 What would you expect to happen in November if 
there is a strike in October? (Hint: think about the 
­ultimatum game.)
	
b.	 Use backwards induction to find what would happen 
in October. For simplicity, assume that if someone is 
indifferent between accepting or rejecting an offer, 
they will accept the offer.
	 8.	 Suppose Mom gives her 10-year-old son $100 on Christ-
mas. She asks him to share this amount with his younger 
sister. He can offer her any amount between $0 and $100, 
but if she refuses to accept what he has offered, both of 
them will get nothing.
	
a.	 What is this type of game called?
	
b.	 What set of strategies will lead to a Nash equilibrium 
in this game?
	 9.	 The Johnson Steel Company generates water pollution 
when it makes steel. It could eliminate this pollution at a 
cost of $700. The Smith family lives downstream. It ­suffers 
$1,000 of damages from the water pollution ­Johnson ­creates. 
­Assume that transactions costs are zero.
	
a.	 Suppose first that the law says Johnson has the right 
to pollute. Show that if Johnson and the Smith family 
negotiate, Johnson will eliminate the pollution.
	
b.	 Now suppose the law is changed so that the Smith 
family has the right to enjoy clean water. Show that 
Johnson will eliminate the pollution even if ­Johnson 
and the Smith family can negotiate. Is the Smith 
­family better off now than in part (a)?
	10.	 Ronald Coase used the example of a farmer and railroad 
tracks to explain bargaining. Sparks from trains running 
on tracks near farmland would set off fires in the fields. 
To avoid this, railroad companies would either have to 
stop running trains on tracks along fields or incur a cost in 
fixing a spark arrester along these tracks. Farmers could 
avoid the cost of fires by leaving land near railroads 
empty. Suppose that the cost of preventing a fire was 
equal to $20,000 for a railroad company and not having a 
fire in the field was worth $10,000 for a farmer. Consider 
the case where the law stipulated that railroads could not 
throw sparks along fields. What would be the outcome?
	11.	 Space heaters are dangerous. The U.S. Consumer Prod-
uct Safety Commission estimates that more than 25,000 
residential fires every year are associated with the use 
of space heaters, resulting in more than 300 deaths. This 
question asks you to think about the Coase Theorem and 
the assignment of liability from these accidents. Suppose 
a company could produce a space heater that is perfectly 
safe for $175 or a standard space heater for $150. Sup-
pose further that a consumer who buys a space heater will 
receive $225 of benefits. If he buys a traditional space 
heater, he will incur (on average) $60 of damages but he 
will not incur damages if he purchases a safe model.
	
a.	 Show that efficiency requires the firm to produce safe 
space heaters. 
	
b.	 Suppose the law says that firms are not liable for 
the damages associated with space heater accidents. 
Show that the firm will sell only safe space heaters.
	
c.	 Now suppose Congress passes a law that says firms 
are liable for the damages from space heaters, and so 
on average a firm that sells a standard space heater 
will have to pay $60 in damages. Show that the firm 
will produce safe space heaters.
	12.	 This chapter illustrates how the Coase Theorem can be ap-
plied to explain the outcome of a divorce in two different 
systems. In both cases, where the unhappy partner values 
the divorce at $5,000 and the happy partner values the mar-
riage at $10,000, the equilibrium is “no divorce.” Now as-
sume that the situation is reversed: the happy partner, who 
does not want a divorce, places a lower value on the mar-
riage ($5,000); the unhappy partner, who wants a divorce, 
values the divorce at a higher value ($10,000). Applying the 
same concept, analyze the outcome of the marriage under 
two scenarios: “right not to divorce” and “right to divorce.”

If you have made it this far in the book, you might 
be feeling a bit uneasy. You might have come to 
the grave conclusion that the mythical homo 
­economicus—the economic man serving as the 
backbone of the discipline of economics—is 
­essentially a species with which you are unfamiliar. 
He is self-absorbed in the pursuit of material wealth 
and unswerving in his drive to satisfy his own needs 
before the needs of others. As an employer, he hires at the 
lowest wage possible; as a seller, he charges whatever the ­market 
will bear; and as a producer, he pursues profits even at the cost of imposing 
negative externalities (for example, ­pollution) on other citizens.
In spite of its obvious simplicities, this economic paradigm has served 
us well in providing a coherent framework through which to model human 
­behavior. But in the past few decades, some economists have considered an 
alternative—an economic agent who does not always make decisions solely 
to promote his own wealth. In fact, this more “human” economic agent cares 
about others and the fairness of his actions.
As we have stressed throughout this book, economics does not tell us what 
people should value. Rather, it provides us with tools to help us understand how 
they should behave once we know what they value. In this chapter, we focus on 
a variant of homo economicus who acts more selflessly and who is influenced

KEY IDEAS
Many people have preferences that go beyond material wealth.
Charity, fairness, trust, revenge, and conforming to those around us 
represent a few examples.
Economic tools can be used to understand when such factors will play 
an important role.
Economists have found that such behaviors are important when their 
opportunity cost is low.
by his surroundings. In doing so, we will discuss the 
economics of charity, fairness, trust, and revenge. This 
will allow us to answer the chapter-opening question on 
whether people care about fairness. We also consider 
the importance of peers in shaping the decisions that we 
make daily. We will find that peer effects are all around 
us: ­affecting our waistlines, our finances, and how hard 
we work at our jobs. In all of these cases economic tools 
­provide us with a deeper understanding of when we 
should expect such considerations to have importance—
the key is the opportunity cost of such actions.
Some economists have considered . . .  
an economic agent who does not 
always make decisions solely to 
­promote his own wealth. This more 
“human” economic agent cares about 
others and the fairness of his actions.
In Chapter 5 we learned about three necessary ingredients to the buyer’s problem:
	
1.	 What you want.
	
2.	 Prices.
	
3.	 How much money you have to spend.
Together, these elements provide the foundations for demand curves. Even though we have 
exclusively focused on tangible goods in our discussions thus far—sweaters, jeans, DVDs, 
iPads, and the like—the economic model is flexible enough to describe your demand for 
intangibles such as charity and fairness. Just like your preferences, budget constraint and 
market price determine whether you purchase an iPad; they also determine your charitable 
contributions and how much “fairness” you demand in resource allocations. We turn now 
to a consideration of each.
The Economics of Charity
As a child, you were most likely taught to help those in need. If your brother falls down, 
help him up. If a friend is in trouble, lend her a hand. If a stranger needs directions, do the 
best you can to help. As an adult, you are now better able to help others. For example, you 
can serve soup at the local food pantry or you can donate money to help save the rain for-
ests. As we discussed in Chapter 9, such activities have become very important in modern 
economies.
Exhibit 18.1 provides a summary of self-reported volunteerism around the globe. What 
we observe overall is a tremendous amount of volunteering in these thirty-six sampled

countries. For example, over 50 percent of the Norwegian adult popu-
lation volunteers some time to at least one charitable cause annually. 
Citizens in many other countries give their time, too: in the United 
Kingdom, 30 percent of people give their time. In Sweden, Uganda, 
and the United States, more than 1 in 5 people volunteer their time to 
charitable causes every year. Beyond helping others, one motivation 
for volunteerism is ­because it makes us feel good (think of that warm, 
fuzzy feeling you get when helping those in need). Thus, even though 
the opportunity cost of our time might be quite high, we give our time 
to help others.
Another important way in which people help charitable causes is to 
give money. As we have already learned in Chapter 9, although govern-
ments are major providers of public goods, they are not the sole provid-
ers. Indeed, many public goods are routinely supplied through other 
channels. For example, through private donations, National ­Public 
­Radio can be aired all around the United States. Rain forests by the 
dozens can be saved as a result of private cash donations to the World 
Wildlife Fund. And cures for ailments ranging from carpal tunnel syndrome to heart dis-
ease have resulted in part from charitable gifts.
So what is the scope of private donations of money? As we learned in Chapter 9, in-
dividual contributions to charitable causes have ­increased to more than 2 percent of U.S. 
Exhibit 18.1 Volunteering Around the Globe
One way to donate to others is with your time. Data from thirty-six countries allows 
us to compare the rate at which people volunteer around the world. For example, 
in Norway, over 50 percent of the adult population volunteers some amount of time 
during the year. But the United States is no slouch either, coming in fifth with more 
than 20 percent of its adult population volunteering time.

GDP. To put this number into perspective, consider that Greece’s most recent GDP—the 
value of all of the goods and services produced by the Greek economy—is less than this 
amount, about $286 billion!
You might wonder where all of this money goes. Exhibit 18.2 provides a glimpse 
from 2011, which represents a typical year. The majority of contributions—32 percent—
by U.S. households went to religious causes. But most people who contribute do so 
to more than one cause. These remaining gifts are commonly directed to educational 
purposes, healthcare/medical research, the poor, and combined purposes, as can be seen 
in Exhibit 18.2. Every so often, major events happen that lead to an outpouring of gifts 
above and beyond the typical flows documented in Exhibit 18.2. For example, when 
Hurricane Katrina struck the United States in 2005, monetary donations broke records 
that were previously set by the 9/11 relief efforts.

The act of giving, just like apples and shoes, can be viewed 
as an economic good. And similar to other economic 
goods, as economists, we like to ask the question: if the 
price increases, does the quantity demanded decrease? 
And, if so, by how much? This gives us a price elasticity of 
demand (as we discussed in Chapter 5).
But how do you increase the price of charitable giving?
One way is by reducing its current tax-advantaged sta-
tus. In the United States, individuals as well as corpora-
tions pay taxes on their incomes. However, any of this 
income that is donated to charities is tax-deductible. For 
example, imagine that you face a tax rate of 30 percent. 
Now let’s say that you decide to send your favorite charity 
$100. How much does it really cost? Since you can account 
for charitable contributions when you pay taxes, your gift 
of $100 is equal to $70 in after-tax income (that is, if you 
decided not to give the $100 to charity you would have 
pocketed $70: $100 (earnings) − $30 (taxes)).
Now let’s assume that your tax rate drops to 15 percent; 
what do you think happens?
Note that the opportunity cost of that charitable gift 
has changed: your gift of $100 is now equivalent to $85 
in after-tax income (that is, if you decided not to give 
the $100 to charity you would have pocketed $85: $100 
(earnings) − $15 (taxes)). So, the price of giving the $100 
has just increased from $70 to $85. How do you think 
such a change affects individuals?
Economist Charles Clotfelter asked this very question in 
his analysis of the effect of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 on 
the amount of charitable contributions from U.S. taxpay-
ers.1 The Tax Act of 1986 reduced the highest tax rate faced 
by individuals in the United States, producing the very situ-
ation that we describe above for the highest earners.
And the result?
Clotfelter found that one group was quite sensitive to 
this tax change: individuals in the highest income brack-
ets reduced their contributions to charity considerably. In 
essence, they responded as our model of an optimizer 
predicts they should: as the price of charity increases, 
quantity demanded (amount given to charity) decreases.

18.1
Why Do People Give to Charity?  An active area of research 
has developed within economics to explore possible answers to the 
question: why do people give to charity? Only after we know why 
people give can we provide the proper incentives to promote giving, 
should we wish to do so. Economists view the reasons for giving as 
falling into two broad categories: to help others and to help oneself.
We will denote the first category as pure altruism, which is 
a motivation solely to help others. This is not unlike the conven-
tional notion of altruism, which typically entails a concern for the well-being of others. It 
is “pure” in the sense that when people give time or money to a charity, they do so solely 
to help someone or some cause. For example, if you or your parents gave money or time 
to Hurricane Sandy victims, it might have been because you were simply trying to help 
people in need. Likewise, if you march for cancer awareness, it might be because you want 
to help others who could be stricken with the disease.
An alternative reason why people might give to charity is to help themselves in an indirect 
way. Because this type of giving is considered to be driven by a selfish motive, economists 
refer to it as impure altruism. Impure altruism is a motivation based solely to make oneself 
feel good and means that we give not necessarily to help another person (“out of the good-
ness of our hearts”), but because there’s some private return to our giving (or, similarly, a pri-
vate cost to not giving). People can be influenced to make charitable gifts by many factors, 
such as social pressure, guilt, or a desire to earn prestige, friendship, or respect. This doesn’t 
mean that impure altruism is a bad thing; if the deed gets done, then so be it. But as with 
anything in life, it is good to understand the true motivations behind the action. For charities, 
this is particularly important because policymakers interested in engineering greater gifts of 
time and money need to know the exact motivations driving such behavior.
Only after we know why people give 
can we provide the proper ­incentives 
to promote giving.
Pure altruism is a motivation solely 
to help others.
Impure altruism is a motivation 
solely to help oneself feel good.
Imagine you come home to find a flyer on your door that 
says, “Fundraisers from a children’s hospital will be visiting 
this address between 10 and 11 a.m. tomorrow morning 
to ask for contributions.” Would you change your sched-
ule to make sure to be home between 10 and 11 a.m.? 
Would you change your schedule to make sure not to be 
at home? What factors would play into your decision?
One aspect of impure altruism is social pressure: you 
give to a charity not because you want to help others, but 
because of the social pressure applied to you by others. By 
asking themselves, “Do people give because they like to 
give, or do people give because they dislike not giving?” 
John List together with Stefano DellaVigna and Ulrike 
­Malmendier set out to test the power of pure altruism and 
social pressure in a door-to-door field experiment.2
Their goal was to determine how much money was 
given because of pure altruism and how much because of 
social pressure. Their hypothesis was that some people 
give to charities not because they care about the charity, 
but because they are asked to do so by a person, and 
they care about what others think of them.
Solicitors were dispatched to the suburbs of Chicago to ask 
for money for a children’s hospital. Sometimes, however, the 
experimenters put flyers on doors to warn households that 
solicitors would be coming at a specific time the next day.
In theory, if people dislike being asked for money, then 
they will try to avoid answering the door during the time 
specified for charitable solicitations. The result?
Although fewer people answered the door when they 
knew a solicitor was coming, those who did answer the 
door gave more to the charity, on average, than their 
unwarned counterparts. This finding suggests that some 
people give to charity because of social pressure and 
avoid interaction with a solicitor when possible. It also 
suggests that people who do answer the door are quite 
generous.
In terms of the split between social pressure and pure 
altruism, the authors found that nearly 75 percent of the 
giving was due to social pressure. Can you think of other 
ways to test what drives giving to charity?

18.1
The Economics of Fairness
Throughout this text we have studied the behavior of economic agents. Whether dealing 
with individuals, households, or firms, there was no scope for fairness, or any other social 
preference, to play a role. A good’s price was determined by the intersection of the market 
supply and market demand curves. Similarly, wages of workers were given by the intersec-
tion of labor demand and labor supply.
Even though we know intuitively that social preferences, such as fairness, altruism, and 
revenge, can play roles in our decision making, for simplicity we ignored them to focus on 
other important issues. We turn now to a consideration of how such preferences might lead 
us to revise our economic model.
Fairness on Television?  You may have heard of the TV game show Friend or Foe? 
The show, which was hosted by MTV diva Kennedy, premiered on June 3, 2002 and lasted 
two seasons. The game show worked as follows. After two-person teams were formed, each 
team was separated into “isolation chambers,” where trivia rounds were played. The two-
person teams worked together to answer the questions in order to build a “trust fund.” A 
team’s “trust fund” could range from $200 to $22,200.
After the trivia portion of the show was complete, the winnings were to be divided 
beween the players. The division depended on both players’ choices. There were three 
possible outcomes:
	
1.	 “Friend-Friend”—If both players chose “Friend,” the total trivia winnings were 
divided equally between them.
	
2.	 “Friend-Foe”—If only one player chose “Friend” and the other chose “Foe,” the 
person who chose Foe received the entire amount, leaving the player who chose 
Friend with nothing.
	
3.	 “Foe-Foe”—If both players chose “Foe,” then they each walked away with nothing.
Exhibit 18.3 provides the payoff outcomes for one of the games, where we assume that you 
are playing with another player named Joe for $16,400.
A summary of the three key elements in this game are as follows:
Players: You and Joe
Strategies: Friend or Foe
Payoffs: See Exhibit 18.3
What should you do? If you are only interested in money, your best strategy is to al-
ways play “Foe.” This is because this choice never leads to lower payoffs than playing 
“Friend.”
How do you think people actually played this game on TV?3 (For some excellent 
­footage of people in action playing this prisoners’ dilemma, we invite you to visit http://
www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OQQ-T42Fko.) Overall, the choices were exactly split—of 
the 234 players examined, 50 percent chose “Friend” and 50 percent chose “Foe.” Thus, 
even though choosing “Foe” is the best action if you want to make as much money as pos-
sible, only half of the participants do so.
Exhibit 18.3 Friend or Foe TV Game Show: A Variant 
of the Prisoners’ Dilemma
By representing the Friend or Foe game in matrix form, 
we can easily compare your and Joe’s payoffs and 
­strategies to figure out the predicted outcome. If you 
and Joe both choose “Friend,” you each earn $8,200. 
But the incentive to play “Foe” is high —potentially 
doubling your earnings unless you both play “Foe.”

Chapter 18  |  Social Economics
18.1
Although there are several reasons for why this might be the case, one of them is that 
people have preferences for fairness. That is, they think it’s unfair to take all of the money 
that they have just earned in a partnership. Specifically, we can define fairness as the will-
ingness of individuals to sacrifice their own well-being to either improve upon the well-
being of others or to punish those who they perceive as behaving unkindly.
How would we revise the payoffs in Exhibit 18.3 to account for such preferences? When 
players have fairness preferences, the total payoffs need to reflect both the monetary payoff 
and considerations of fairness. For example, maybe you believe that Joe has fairness prefer-
ences, too, and when playing this game you view the payoffs in Exhibit 18.4 as applicable.
Now when making your choice you consider not only the monetary payoff but also the 
“fairness penalty” contained in the payoff matrix, which you incur when you play “Foe” 
(that is you incur the fairness penalty when you play in an “unfair” manner, choosing “Foe” 
and reducing the payoff of the other player). Suppose that this “fairness penalty” is $5,000. 
Note that as a player, you are simply guessing the magnitude of this number. If you make 
these assumptions, then you simply insert a $5,000 fairness penalty in the matrix and opti-
mize with the new numbers. Inserting $5,000 as the penalty for choosing “Foe” in Exhibit 
18.4 yields Exhibit 18.5, which shows the new payoffs when such penalties are used.
Fairness in the Lab?  Although fairness preferences might certainly be at work driving 
the Friend or Foe? decisions, there are other factors at work as well. For example, it is 
possible that contestants recognize that they are playing in front of millions of people who 
are scrutinizing their every move—employers, spouses, parents, and even their own kids. 
For these sorts of reasons, economists have turned to laboratory experiments to measure 
fairness preferences. One such game that is commonly employed is the Ultimatum Game, 
which is a one-shot bargaining situation between two players. Exhibit 18.6 displays the 
game, which was previously discussed in Chapter 17.
In the Ultimatum Game, a Proposer is given an amount of money to split between him-
self and a Responder. Say that this amount is $10. The Responder is told how the pot has 
Fairness is the willingness of 
individuals to sacrifice their own 
well-being to either improve upon 
the well-being of others or to 
punish those who they perceive as 
behaving unkindly.
Exhibit 18.4 Friend or Foe TV Game Show with 
Fairness Preferences
Unlike Exhibit 18.4, there is now an additional penalty 
imposed on whoever chooses to play “Foe.” Depend-
ing on the size of this fairness penalty, the unsatisfy-
ing prediction of (“Foe, Foe”) from Exhibit 18.4 might 
change to a more socially efficient outcome.

Here, the fairness penalty is set at $5,000 and included 
in the payoffs of the matrix. Once this has been done, 
we are back to our standard game theory analysis—all 
of the new “fairness” concerns are already reflected in 
the payoffs. With such a fairness penalty, if you and Joe 
find yourselves playing (“Friend, Foe”), neither of you 
has any reason to change your action, and the same is 
true if you play (“Foe, Friend”).

been split and then decides whether or not to accept the Proposer’s de-
cision. Say that the proposed split is $9 for the Proposer and $1 for the 
Responder. If the Responder accepts this allocation, the Proposer and 
Responder are paid their proposed shares—in this example, $9 to the 
Proposer, $1 to the Responder. But if the Responder rejects, both the 
Proposer and the ­Responder receive nothing.
As a quick refresher, let’s revisit what game theory tells us about the 
predicted outcome of the Ultimatum Game. If both players are only con-
cerned with their own well-being, we can use the payoffs in ­Exhibit 18.6 
and backward induct to determine how they will play the game. ­Assuming 
that the Responder prefers more money to less, we have ­already shown in 
Chapter 17 that the Responder accepts any positive ­offer, meaning that 
the Proposer will offer the lowest positive amount—in this case, 1 cent.
Even though game theory has stark predictions in this case, we typi-
cally do not find this result in laboratory experiments. In fact, a majority 
of Proposers offer amounts between 25 percent and 50 percent of the 
original pot, with few offers below 5 percent. Furthermore, Responders 
frequently reject offers below 20 percent. Why does this happen?
Fairness is a prominent explanation for describing how people play 
the Ultimatum Game. Recall that people can view a selfish behavior as 
unfair and may wish to punish it. In this game, Responders are willing to reject unfair offers 
which typically has a small cost for them because an unfair offer gives them very little of 
the pot. You should remind yourself that this is not at odds with economics per se: recall 
that economics does not tell us what people should value. For example, economics does not 
prescribe that people should or should not value fairness any more than it says that people 
should or should not value fast cars, a clean environment, or even freckles on coworkers’ 
faces. What economics does predict is that, similar to how people should give more to char-
ity when the opportunity cost of doing so is lower, a person valuing fairness should demand 
more of it at lower prices and less of it at higher prices, holding all else equal—something 
we are going to discuss in greater detail next.
As such, Responders shouldn’t always be willing to punish unfairness. Sacrificing 
one’s well-being to punish an offer of a 90–10 split when the pot is only $10 is under-
standably easier to do than when the pot is $5,000 (the difference between a punishment 
price of $1 and $500). Thus, we may expect that as the opportunity cost of exercis-
ing fairness concerns increases, the likelihood that an individual will exercise them de-
creases. Even in the context of fairness preferences, reasoning through the problem with 
economics can take us quite far. We return to this idea in the Evidence-Based Economics 
section.
Exhibit 18.6 The Ultimatum Game
The Ultimatum Game begins with the Proposer’s 
­decision. The Proposer can offer anywhere ­between 
$0 and $10, which we represent as a smooth 
curve between $0 and $10 in the exhibit. Once 
the ­Proposer makes a decision ($x in the exhibit), 
that decision is conveyed to the Responder as 
the ­Proposer’s offer. Now, the Responder decides 
whether to accept the offer (pocketing $x and 
­leaving the Proposer with $10 − x) or to reject 
the offer (leaving both players with $0). The red 
­numbers at the bottom give the Proposer’s payoff 
and blue numbers are for the Responder.

Say you have volunteered for an economics experiment. 
Upon entering the lab, you are told that you have been 
paired with an anonymous partner who is in another room 
and that the two of you will be splitting a pot of cash. The 
person assigned the role of Allocator decides how the 
money is to be divided, and the other, called the Recipi-
ent, must accept whatever choice the allocator makes.
You have been randomly assigned the role of allocator 
and must choose how much of $10 to give to the ­recipient 
and how much of it to keep for yourself. In effect, you are 
the Dictator. The lab assistants assure you that your iden-
tity will remain anonymous to the person you’re paired 
with, so you can be as selfish or as generous as you want. 
How would you, as the Dictator, split the $10?
Typically, in the Dictator Game, a little more than half 
of allocators send the recipient some of the money, with 
the average share being about 20 percent of the original 
pie. Odds are that you won’t decide to split the $10 
evenly with the Recipient.
But how would your choice change if, instead of be-
ing in separate rooms, you and the recipient were sitting 
face to face? What if, instead of allocating shares to an 
anonymous person, the two of you knew one another?
Lab experiments such as these have shown us that the 
degree of social distance between not only the partici-
pants but also between participants and experimenter 
has an effect on the allocators’ choices. One such experi-
ment found that when no one (including even the experi-
menters) would ever know the allocators’ choices, more 
than 60 percent of people kept the entire pot.4 However, 
when the allocator and recipient were instructed simply 
to look at each other in silence for a few seconds be-
fore the allocator made his or her choice, approximately  
70 percent divided the money evenly.

Evidence-Based Economics
T
he Ultimatum Game provides a direct situation in which the Proposer sets a “take-
it-or-leave-it price” and the Responder has to make a decision on accepting or re-
jecting. There are many economic decisions that we have discussed that share this 
quality: a monopolist setting a price, an oligopolist proposing a collusive agreement, or 
more generally, any bargaining situation that has a take-it-or-leave-it element.
One of the most robust findings in experimental economics is that many responders in 
ultimatum games reject unfair offers, leaving themselves and their bargaining partner with 
a zero payoff. However, in and of itself, this outcome is not at odds with economic theory. 
What we know less about is whether people care about fairness when the price of being 
fair considerably increases. Economics makes a clear prediction in this case: people should 
demand greater fairness when the “price” of fairness is lower, meaning that they can punish 
unfair behavior at a lower opportunity cost.
Let’s trace some history of the economics of fairness. Since the early 1980s, the 
­Ultimatum Game has been one of the most popular experiments in laboratory economics. 
It has been played hundreds of times by your typical college student and even by natives of 
the Peruvian Amazon. Dozens of people have had their brains scanned while playing this 
game. By and large, what the research has found is that Proposers in the game typically 
offer about 40 percent of the money they are endowed with and Responders reject about 
16 percent of the offers. Small offers are much more likely to be rejected than large offers.
Rejecting a positive offer in the Ultimatum Game involves a monetary cost, and 
whether behavior changes when this cost increases is a question of economic import. The 
main economic prediction in this setting is this: Responders will be willing to reject un-
equal offers when the cost of doing so is low but will find it hard to reject such offers 
when the stakes are large. Many of us might be willing to reject an offer of 1 percent of  
10 dollars, yet how many of us would reject 1 percent of 10 million dollars?
Q: Do people care about fairness?

Some economists have recently tested this prediction. They traveled to poor villages in 
Northeast India to run the Ultimatum Game.5 By using subjects from poor villages, they 
could use large stakes at an affordable rate. Within these villages, they executed ultimatum 
games that varied the stakes by a factor of 1,000, permitting them to explore the game over 
different pot sizes of 20, 200, 2,000 and 20,000 rupees. These amounts corresponded, at 
the time, to $0.41, $4.10, $41, and $410, respectively. What this means to the people tak-
ing part in the experiment becomes clearer when we put it into context: the average daily 
income in these villages at the time was 100 rupees ($2.05).
The results from the game are summarized in Exhibit 18.7. Panel (a) of Exhibit 18.7 
shows the offer proportions across the four stakes levels, in other words, the different 
percentages offered for various pies. What we find is that for lower stakes, the offer pro-
portions are higher than for the larger stakes conditions. It seems that Proposers recog-
nize that Responders will have a difficult time rejecting an unfair offer in the high-stakes 
(20,000) treatment, as the average offer is only a little more than 10 percent of the pie. So 
what do you think happens to these low proposals in the high-stakes treatment? Do they 
get rejected?
Exhibit 18.7 Offers and Rejection Rates in the Ultimatum Game
The first pattern of data that emerges is that as the size of the pie increases (from 
20 rupees to 20,000 rupees), the share of the pie that the Proposer offers to the 
­Responder decreases. This finding alone suggests that stakes matter, but without the 
data on rejection rates, we have only part of the story.
The exhibit shows the average proportion of the stakes offered to the Responder. 
Bars represent our four stake treatments of 20, 200, 2,000, and 20,000 rupees to be 
shared in the Ultimatum Game.
When the authors focus on only the offers that are 20 percent of the total pie or 
less, we see the conclusive evidence for the importance of the stakes of the game. 
Whereas over 40 percent of low offers were rejected at the lower stakes, less than  
5 percent of such offers are rejected when the total pie is 20,000 rupees. This also 
explains why Proposers thought they could make lower offers with higher stakes. 
This evidence shows that fairness, just like any other economic good, responds 
to price.

Panel (b) of Exhibit 18.7, which shows rejection rates for offers less than or equal to  
20 percent of the pie, provides the answer. In short, even though people rejected small of-
fers when the stakes were small, very few people rejected them when the stakes were large. 
Panel (b) of Exhibit 18.7 shows that even when Proposers made very low offers, once the 
stakes became large, almost no one rejected the offer. In the 20,000 rupees treatment, for 
example, only 1 of the 24 offers at or below 20 percent was rejected. That’s a very small 
rejection rate considering that the average offer in that treatment group was just a little bit 
more than 10 percent of the pot. And this is much smaller than the 40 percent to 50 percent 
rejection rate observed in the lower-stakes treatments.
This experiment highlights the power of economics in 
that it shows that people do value fairness but will go only 
so far when enforcing it. When the cost is low, people vig-
orously punish unfair offers. But they aren’t as willing to 
punish if it is really expensive to do so. If it costs them 
too much, they will let their fairness preferences take a 
backseat. This result is comforting for economists in that 
it shows that even issues such as fairness have a place in our economic framework: the 
power of economic reasoning extends well beyond production and consumption of goods 
and services such as cars, bicycles, iPhones, and haircuts.

Trust is a key component in most

When we step back and think about it, trust is a key component 
in most economic transactions. This point was stressed by ­Nobel 
Prize-winning economist Kenneth Arrow, who wrote “virtually 
every commercial transaction has within itself an element of 
trust . . . it can be plausibly argued that much of the economic 
backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual 
confidence.”6 Of course, if someone takes advantage of your trust, you might consider 
­exacting one of mankind’s oldest acts: revenge. In this section we discuss the economics 
of trust and revenge.

The Economics of Trust
Trust and trustworthiness are everywhere in life. You trust that the meal that you ate the 
last time you dined out was processed, stored, and prepared in the safest manner possible. 
Likewise, when confiding in a friend, you rely on her trustworthiness to hold your deepest 
secrets. Economists have come to recognize that most economic transactions require trust 
and trustworthiness because it is rarely the case that all dimensions of a transaction can be 
contractually specified and enforced. For instance, it is difficult for Ford Motor Company 
to monitor the every move of line workers in a factory; workers need to be trusted not to 
commit sabotage or steal from the plant. Likewise, parties to a commercial transaction 
must have some degree of trust that each will fulfill the contract agreed upon. Otherwise, 
all of their time would be spent in court. You might recall from Chapter 16 that these are 
moral hazard considerations.
Economists have recently begun to study the nature and extent of trust and trustworthi-
ness of people. One popular approach is to use laboratory experiments and observe people 
in “trust games.” One variant of the trust game is shown in Exhibit 18.8. In this game, there 
are two players, Jen and Gary, who have never met and make their decisions anonymously. 
Jen is the first mover and must decide whether to trust Gary. Thus, Jen can either trust Gary 
or not trust Gary. If she does not trust Gary, then both she and Gary receive a 
payoff of $10. If she chooses to trust Gary, then Gary chooses either to defect 
or cooperate. If he defects, then Jen receives nothing and Gary receives $30. If 
Gary cooperates, then both he and Jen receive $15.
If you were in Jen’s shoes, how would you decide? Likewise, if you were in 
Gary’s shoes, and Jen trusted you, how would you respond?
Assuming that Exhibit 18.8 contains all of the relevant payoffs, then you 
should use backward induction, as we learned in Chapter 13, to solve this 
game. Put in Gary’s shoes, you would defect if given the chance because by so 
doing you earn $30, which is greater than your cooperation earnings of $15. 
Put in Jen’s shoes, you should recognize that Gary’s defection will probably 
occur because of the larger payoff ($30 is greater than $15) coming his way. 
Thus, you should choose not to trust Gary.
The equilibrium of this game is therefore for Jen not to trust Gary. But this 
is a bad outcome in the sense that it is not socially efficient: instead of earning a 
total of $30 between them, they only earn $20 ($10 each) because Jen does not 
trust Gary. You will notice that many situations in the real world look like this 
game. Every time you trust a stranger, or even a friend, there is a risk that they 
will disappoint you. When you call a plumber to repair your leaking faucet, 
there is a risk that he will take your money but do a shoddy job and the faucet 
will start leaking again the next day. If the equilibrium was as depicted in Exhibit 18.8, the 
world would be a sad and quite dysfunctional place.
What factors could cause the equilibrium to be different? One important factor is that 
Gary might have a preference for being trustworthy. In the same way that there could be a 
Exhibit 18.8 A Trust Game Between Jen 
and Gary
In the Trust Game, Jen is the first mover and 
has to decide whether to trust Gary and let 
Gary have the final say, or not to trust Gary 
and settle the game in the first move. Given 
that Gary, if selfish, will defect, Jen would 
maximize her earnings by settling the game 
in her move and never giving Gary a chance. 
­Unfortunately, both players are worse off in 
this case relative to the case where Jen trusts 
Gary and he cooperates with her.

penalty for not being fair, as in Friend or Foe, there could be a penalty for Gary if he were 
to be untrustworthy. Let’s say that the penalty is that he would feel terrible when he acts in 
such a manner.
Exhibit 18.9 shows what the game between Jen and Gary would look like when Gary 
has a penalty equivalent to $20 for choosing defection. Because of this penalty, his benefits 
from defection are now $10 rather than $30. Studying Exhibit 18.9, we see that Gary will 
now prefer to cooperate rather than defect. Recognizing such an outcome, Jen will now 
prefer to trust Gary rather than not trust him. Thus, simply allowing trustworthiness to be 
part of the equation could considerably change the incentives facing the agents and move 
them to a more socially efficient equilibrium.
Another factor that can move the players from the original “bad” equilibrium is if the 
game stretches out to a “long run”—that is, if the game is played several times over. Even 
though in a one-shot game with the original payoffs it makes sense for Jen to not trust Gary, 
if they were to play many times, it might make sense for Jen to trust Gary, because they 
can both be better off if they each receive $15 every time they play rather than $10. This is 
exactly the same reasoning that we saw in Chapter 14, supporting collusion as a long-run 
arrangement between oligopolists.
Let’s be a little more explicit about why this is the case. From Exhibit 18.8, in such a 
repeated relationship, if Jen and Gary cooperate, each will get $15 every time they play the 
game. Now let’s say that Gary defects. In this case, he receives $30 once, but from then on, 
Jen will choose not to trust Gary, leaving each player with $10 every time they play. So by 
defecting, Gary will increase his current payoff, but this will be at the cost of reducing his 
future payoff. Taking this into account, both players might find it in their interest to coop-
erate as a long-run strategy. In this way, the incentive of future cooperation can effectively 
discourage defection.
This long-run strategy might shed light on the kinds of interactions we constantly observe 
in the real world—for example, why friends and families share trust. Similar ideas can ap-
ply to society at large if we think of people as playing a “game of life.” If you behave badly 
by stealing a classmate’s lecture notes, then your friends might develop a negative opinion 
of you and will be less willing to cooperate with you in the future. By casting yourself as 
dishonest, you can be hurt significantly in the future. You might lose future job opportunities 
and the trust of friends, and might even find that people seek to punish your past actions in 
their private dealings with you.
The Economics of Revenge
So far, we have focused our discussion primarily on “nice” features of human behavior: 
charity, fairness, and trust. But, there are preferences that can be distinctly “not nice,” 
such as revenge. Yet we will find that the ability to exact revenge can actually serve a 
Exhibit 18.9 A Trust Game Between Jen 
and Gary with a $20 Guilt Penalty
As with Exhibit 18.5, even when we include 
social preferences in the payoffs, the game 
can be analyzed using our standard toolkit. In 
this case, Gary experiences a guilt penalty of 
$20 for betraying Jen’s trust in the first move. 
This guilt penalty is high enough that Gary will 
instead cooperate to maximize his earnings. 
Knowing this, Jen will trust Gary, leading to 
the outcome (Trust Gary, Cooperate).

useful purpose. Consider an example from medieval Europe. To promote social order, 
the communes in the tenth century kept the peace through the threat of revenge: in other 
words, an “eye for an eye” policy was in place. Even though exacting revenge by punish-
ing people for ­antisocial behaviors was costly, it was theorized to be efficient because it 
reduced misbehavior by townspeople.
It is not difficult to find examples of the economics of revenge in modern economies: 
corporal punishment, public lashings, and other severe means to address misbehavior 
are to be found everywhere around the globe. But is this to promote social order? And 
do individuals punish this antisocial behavior of others even when it is costly to them? 
For example, say you witness a hit-and-run ­accident: do you take the time to call in the 
license plate number to the police and go to the precinct and carefully fill out a police 
report? On a much different level, do you yell at someone for cutting in line knowing that 
you run the risk of being labeled “aggressive” or “tacky” by others?
We can study the economics of revenge more formally by extending the Trust Game 
example. Imagine that after Gary decides whether to cooperate or defect, Jen can im-
pose a fine of $20 on Gary. But imposing the fine will cost Jen $10. How does adding 
such a revenge option change the equilibrium of the Trust Game?
Exhibit 18.10 shows the effect. At the end of the game tree, we have allowed different 
payoffs for Jen. In the first case, she’s not vengeful, so she suffers when she imposes a 
fine on Gary (she’s lost $10 and thus receives a payoff of −$10). In the second case, she 
is vengeful and she actually derives satisfaction from imposing the fine on Gary (because 
she’s getting revenge on him for not returning her trust). Assuming that this satisfaction is 
worth $20 for her, her total payoff is $20 + (−$10) = $10.
If Jen is not vengeful and Gary knows this fact, then Gary knows that she will not 
impose the penalty. So he continues to defect if given the option. But, if Jen is vengeful, 
then Gary knows that if he defects, Jen will happily punish him. Knowing this, Gary must 
reconsider his strategy: defection doesn’t look so good anymore. In particular, in this case 
Gary realizes that Jen will impose the fine and now chooses to cooperate.
Therefore, we have identified another path to a good equilibrium: the threat of revenge. 
Jen’s ability to exact revenge convinces Gary to act in the interests of the collective. This is 
very similar to the effect of credible commitments that we discussed in Chapter 13.
Exhibit 18.10 A Trust Game Between 
Jen and Gary with a Punishment 
Option
In a setting closer to reality, Jen would 
see Gary’s defection and be able to 
­punish Gary. Here, we model that by 
giving Jen the first and final say on 
the outcome of the game. If Jen isn’t 
­vengeful, the game ends just as in 
Exhibit 18.9—knowing that Gary will 
defect, Jen ends the game in the first 
move and doesn’t trust Gary. ­However, 
if Jen is vengeful, then Gary, when it’s 
his turn to decide, will ­cooperate, pre-
ferring $15 to the ­inevitable $10 he gets 
if he defects against a vengeful Jen.

The role that supported long-run trust in the repeated 
trust game between Jen and Gary was “cooperate until 
your partner turns on you, and then turn on him.” If both 
players use this strategy, they likely will not have to face 
the pain of betrayal—the threat of retaliation is too high 
to make defection worthwhile. Many people, businesses, 
and even countries have built trusting relationships from 
the expectation that uncooperative behavior would lead 
to revenge. In fact, such thinking may have an evolution-
ary root.
Biologists and anthropologists currently are locked 
in a heated debate over the power of group selection. 
Several scholars, such as Robert Boyd, Peter Richardson, 
Elliott Sober, and David Sloan Wilson, are working to 
show that although selection may favor the selfish indi-
viduals, groups that have built trusting, cooperative re-
lationships should outlast groups composed entirely of 
selfish individuals.7 Individual selection implies that the 
strongest person will survive to pass on his genes, while 
group selection implies that the strongest groups will 
survive to pass on their genes. A general rule of thumb 
in this research is that “selfishness beats altruism within 
groups, but altruistic groups beat selfish groups.”8 How 
could we test whether this is at work in markets?
CHOICE & CONSEQUENCE
Does Revenge Have an Evolutionary Logic?
Indoctrination is the process by 
which agents imbue society with 
their ideology or opinion.
Throughout this book we have referred at various times to our preferences. What factors 
shape whether we’re fair-minded, whether we give in to social pressure, whether we really 
enjoy the feeling of knowing we did the right thing, or whether we take satisfaction from 
exacting revenge? Are these factors different from those determining whether we prefer 
chocolate or vanilla ice cream?
Where Do Our Preferences Come From?
Our preferences are in part determined by biological and chemical processes (e.g., children 
prefer sweet flavors). In many applications, we can take them as “given” in our economic 
model. Other dimensions of our preferences, however, are determined and affected by so-
cialization, access to information, and indoctrination.
We are not born with a preference for watching TV or playing video games. These are 
preferences that we acquire. Such preferences are a function of the society in which we 
live. We learn to pattern our behavior in ways considered appropriate to that of society. 
And, the influence of society, especially through friends and family, is an important part 
of socialization.
Our preferences are also shaped by a more unsavory force: indoctrination. Indoctrina-
tion is the process by which agents imbue society with their ideology or opinion. Part of 
this indoctrination is benign—it’s just the process of providing information. For example, 
antismoking campaigns pay to advertise widely because they believe these ads cause people 
not to smoke. These groups successfully cultivate a cultural norm against smoking. Most of 
us prefer not to smoke because we have been provided with information about the negative 
health effects of smoking and partly because we know that our society frowns upon smoking.
Far different from the potentially helpful spread of information is the power of organiza-
tions to change people’s preferences through indoctrination. The dangerous temptation of 
governments and powerful individuals to influence citizens with ideologies or opinions has 
plagued many countries. For instance, today many North Korean citizens believe that an 
economy that is ruled centrally is preferred to an economy guided by market forces. As we 
learned in Chapter 7, this is clearly not the case in theory or practice.

Perhaps you will not be surprised to learn that at least 
three separate laboratory experiments have shown that 
economics majors cooperate less than students from 
other disciplines.9 Whether in a prisoners’ dilemma exper-
iment or a dictator game, a student of economics tends 
to exhibit behavior more in line with the selfish homo eco-
nomicus than with a more cooperative economic man.
Is this a form of indoctrination? Could it be that eco-
nomics makes people less social and more selfish?
We should note that there are at least two other expla-
nations for these results. First, it might be the case that 
the economics discipline attracts students who are more 
“selfish” than the average student. That is, the selection 
of students who enter the economics major is different 
from those who enter other majors—those who enter 
economics are more attracted to dollars. This makes 
sense because economics majors tend to do quite well in 
terms of earnings after graduation.
Equally as plausible might be the case that econom-
ics majors have misunderstood economic science as pre-
scribing the “correct” behavior in such games. As you 
now know, as far as economists are concerned, as long as 
you are making the best choice for yourself given the in-
formation you have, you’re acting rationally. This doesn’t 
necessarily mean that you maximize your income or that 
you act selfishly.
But a common misconception is that economics tells 
us that we should be completely selfish—promoting our 
own earnings at the expense of others. In this way of 
thinking, economics students are always figuring out the 
equilibrium in monetary payoffs, to the exclusion of other 
social preferences.
Perhaps you know the ultimate answer to this question 
through your interactions with economics majors. We, as 
economics professors, would like to learn the truth!
LETTING THE DATA SPEAK
Is Economics Bad for You?
Twitter account as well. Likewise, you might go to eBay first if 
you are interested in buying or selling in an auction because eBay 
has many buyers and sellers. Equally as important is the influence 
of others beyond these network externalities. Every day we see 
people, listen to them, and converse about the correct course of 
action. What jeans should I wear when I go out tonight? What is 
the next hot stock? What kind of shoes should I buy?
For better or worse, our social surroundings affect the de-
cisions that we make daily. No one person or group decided 
that flare-leg jeans would be cool in the 1960s, acid-wash would be cool in the 1980s, 
and Kim Kardashian’s frayed hemline jeans would be “in” right now. But the trends 
are there.
Our friends and acquaintances are a major force in shaping both our preferences and the 
choices we make in life. Economists call the influence of the decisions of others on our own 
choices peer effects. People tend to gather information from those around them and use this 
information to decide on their own behavior. Both the characteristics of 
our peers—their talents and skills—and their choices affect our lives.
A few examples will help to illustrate the power of peers and also 
reveal why it is challenging to identify peer effects convincingly in the 
data. The first is a study by economists Oriana Bandiera and ­Imran 
Rasul, who noticed interesting peer effects when studying farmers and 
their adoption of sunflower seed farming in Mozambique.10 They ex-
amined how social ties in the community influenced the adoption of 
new technology to raise sunflower seeds. They found that those who 
adopted to sunflower seeds knew a significantly greater number of 
other people who had switched to farming sunflower seeds than those 
who chose not to adopt. Intuitively, this outcome makes sense.
Imagine that you are a farmer presented with the option of farming a 
new crop. You’d be more likely to adopt it if you knew that several peo-
ple had already done so rather than just one or two people. Why does 
such a relationship exist between the adoption decision of peers and an 
individual’s decision? One possibility is that each farmer is learning 
from his or her peers whether sunflower seeds have high productivity: 
the more your peers adopt, the more likely you are to be convinced that 
Our friends and acquaintances are 
a major force in shaping both our 
preferences and the choices we 
make in life.
Peer effects are the influence of 
the decisions of others on our own 
choices.
Peer effects are everywhere.

this is a good idea. Another possibility is that the adoption decisions of peers create social 
pressure: you might not want to be the only one who hasn’t adopted. Yet another possibility 
is that neighboring farmers’ lands are of similar quality and type, and if you are in an area 
where sunflower seeds are likely to increase yields significantly, then both you and your 
peers will be more likely to adopt.
In a study that is closer to home, economist Bruce Sacerdote sought to study peer 
­effects in college dorms.11 He uncovered what he called the “freshman roommate effect.” 
Exploring a natural experiment in which nearly 1,600 Dartmouth college freshmen were 
randomly assigned a roommate, Sacerdote examined the effects that roommates had on one 
another. Among other results, he reported that roommates had a significant effect on each 
other’s GPA! It seems that having a roommate who studies all the time helps you to study 
more yourself. If you are unhappy about your GPA, however, don’t go hunting down your 
roommate just yet, as Sacerdote and other scholars have found that many other important 
factors influence your GPA, too.
Though clever, Sacerdote’s study is also open to alternative interpretations. Imagine that 
your roommate has no effect on you but your room happens to be next to a busy train sta-
tion with frequent service in the middle of the night. Both you and your roommate will get 
no sleep as trains whiz around you. At semester’s end both you and your roommate may 
have low GPAs, but this is not because one of you has influenced the other, but because 
both of you have been subject to a “common shock”—in this case, train noise keeping you 
awake all night.
Following the Crowd: Herding
Crowds tend together for a purpose: whether at school, a concert, or a roadside accident, 
people tend to flock to one another. In these cases, there is usually something specific that 
attracts attention. However, people can flock together without good reason. In economics, 
herding occurs when individuals conform to the decisions of others.
In general, there are two reasons why individuals might decide to herd. The first might 
simply be that they are afraid of being wrong—for this reason, they might not value their 
own instincts highly. Another is the assumption that if many people are making the same 
decision, they must be doing so for a reason. You might have heard the adage at amusement 
parks: if there is a long line, jump in it because something good is at the end. Herding cre-
ates an informational equilibrium in which people trust the wisdom of others and ignore 
their own information.
For example, imagine that you are walking down a street and decide that you will stop to 
eat lunch. You look around for a diner and see two across the street from one another. Both 
diners are empty. Knowing nothing about them, you randomly choose Big Al’s Diner over 
Kelly’s Diner. In doing so, you might have cost Kelly’s more than just your own patronage. 
Let’s see why.
Five minutes later, another hungry person walks by looking for 
somewhere to eat. He, too, sees Kelly’s and Big Al’s. Perhaps he has 
heard from some of his friends that Kelly’s has good food. But he 
also sees that Big Al’s has a customer (you) and that Kelly’s is empty. 
He takes this information as a signal of quality—Big Al’s must be 
better because it has more customers than Kelly’s, and perhaps that 
customer, you, went to Big Al’s because of some valuable informa-
tion. So he ignores his private information (what he had heard from 
his friends) and follows you to Big Al’s. As more and more people 
come looking for a diner, they, too, follow this reasoning and follow 
the herd. So Kelly’s sits empty, while Big Al’s is full.
This phenomenon is known as an information cascade, which 
occurs when people make choices based on the decisions of others 
rather than on their own private information—the second customer 
ignoring the information from friends to follow you to Big Al’s. It 
might seem reasonable to do this, because other people often make 
decisions based on some relevant information. The results of an in-
formation cascade, however, can be significant. For example, some 
Herding is a behavior of individuals 
who conform to the decisions of 
others.
An information cascade occurs 
when people make the same 
decisions as others, ignoring their 
own private information.

The most commonly studied example of peer effects is in 
the classroom—how peers in your classroom affect you in 
economically important ways. One group of economists 
has taken the study of peer effects into a quite different 
direction. Scott Carrell, Mark Hoekstra, and James West 
used the random assignment of peer groups in the U.S. 
Air Force Academy (USAFA) to consider how peer effects 
impact fitness. Do you think poor fitness or obesity are 
linked to peer effects? The answer may surprise you.
Carrell, Hoekstra, and West studied the impact of 
peers on physical ability by using high school and col-
lege physical fitness results for students in the USAFA.12 
The USAFA is somewhat unique in that college students 
are randomly assigned to groups (squadrons) with ap-
proximately 30 other students, and these groups spend 
the majority of their time together. Further, the physical 
fitness of students at the USAFA is motivated through 
common training monitored relatively closely through a 
Physical Education Average score. The score combines a 
number of different physical activities and certain physical 
fitness requirements.
We show one of the main results from the research 
in Exhibit 18.11. The horizontal axis of the figure shows 
the proportion of students in the 30-student USAFA 
groups who were in the lowest quintile (20 percent of 
least physically fit freshman) for a high school measure 
of fitness involving various activities such as pull-ups and 
push-ups. The vertical axis records the probability of fail-
ing the USAFA fitness requirement. The curves on the 
graph represent high school fitness. These curves show a 
stark result: the probability of a student failing the fitness 
exam increases as the number of unfit students around 
him increases. Similar to our discussion of the Dartmouth 
roommate study, this result could be explained by sev-
eral factors, including some “common shocks” that influ-
ence all of the members of a squadron. Nevertheless, it 
is strongly suggestive that the physical fitness of people 
around you is correlated with your own health!

Starting with the green curve, we can see that individuals who were in the 
­90th ­percentile of high school fitness seem to be unaffected by their peers in 
terms of probability of failing the USAFA fitness test. However, as we move toward 
­individuals closer to average (red line) and below average (blue line) fitness in high 
school, the pattern emerges that the probability of failing the USAFA fitness test 
increases as the average fitness of your peer group drops (moving left to right 
along the x-axis).
economists view information cascades as an important reason behind significant asset 
price increases and subsequent corrections. For instance, people rush to buy the next big 
thing in the stock market, and the share price rises abnormally high. The subsequent cor-
rection lowers the share price, leading to considerable losses for those who got in late.
Another place where information cascades potentially play an important role is in job 
interviews. An employer might look at a candidate’s resume and see that he has been 

460	
Chapter 18  |  Social Economics
unemployed for some time. Even if the interview goes well and the candidate seems well 
suited for the job, the employer might weigh the information that the candidate has so 
far been unsuccessful in finding work as a signal that everyone else thinks this worker is 
unqualified. The employer could then think that he is missing something important in his 
evaluation of the worker and might ignore his own positive signals in favor of the informa-
tion contained in the candidate’s unemployment history. He won’t offer the interviewee a 
job, and neither will the next employer, or the next . . . this information cascade prolongs 
the unfortunate interviewee’s joblessness.
Of all the complaints about the Internet, one you will 
never hear is that there is a shortage of people express-
ing their opinions. Between the blogosphere, Twitter, and 
Facebook, if you have an opinion, you can get it onto the 
Internet (whether or not anyone reads it is a whole differ-
ent question . . .).
With all of these opinions floating around, most people 
have little trouble finding the blogs and comments of 
like-minded individuals; psychologists call this phenom-
enon confirmation bias. Confirmation bias predicts that 
people only read articles that reaffirm their own beliefs, 
thus entrenching them further in their own prejudices.
Not all agree, however. A study of the 2004 election 
concludes that Internet users may be some of the most 
balanced media consumers.13 Internet articles, especially 
blogs, are often formatted to present critiques of others’ 
arguments and then provide the link to the original com-
mentary. This fingertip access to both sides of an argu-
ment makes reading contradictory opinions much easier, 
not to mention cheaper, than subscribing to both The 
New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.

Summary
There is nothing in economics that dictates agents only value material 
wealth. Introspection suggests that we value many things beyond wealth, 
including charity, fairness, trust, revenge, and how others perceive us. Our 
economic tools provide us with an understanding of when such considerations 
have importance.
Economists have also explored how predictions within economics change 
when we consider an agent who acts “more human.” Our economic reasoning 
remains intact when we add such considerations. In this way, predictions from 
the standard economic model are quite robust and help us to study features of our 
economy—fairness, revenge, charity, trust, peer effects—that were not previously 
well understood.
Taken together, these factors help us to understand the world around us and 
how economics can be extended to every corner of our economy.

Questions
	 1.	 How does the standard model of homo economicus differ 
from the homo economicus that is studied in behavioral 
and social economics?
	 2.	 Suppose the act of giving is viewed as an economic good. 
How can the price of charitable donations be measured? 
Does the quantity demanded decrease as the price of giv-
ing increases?
	 3.	 What is the difference between pure and impure altruism? 
Can you give examples from your experience?
	 4.	 Refer to the experiment in the chapter on soliciting dona-
tions for a children’s hospital. Experimenters put flyers 
on doors saying that solicitors would be coming to their 
house at a particular time. Fewer people opened the door 
when they knew that a solicitor would be coming, but 
those who did gave more money, on average, than others 
who did not know. What can you infer about pure and 
impure altruism from the results of this experiment?
	 5.	 In the context of this chapter, what is meant by having a 
preference for fairness?
	 6.	 In the Friend or Foe game, Foe is a (weakly) dominant 
strategy for both players. What can explain why, in 
roughly 50 percent of decisions, players chose Friend and 
split the sum of money with the other player?
	 7.	 Why do lab experiments show a different outcome for the 
Ultimatum game compared to the outcome predicted by 
game theory?
	 8.	 In the Dictator game, the allocator decides how a cer-
tain sum of money is to be divided, and the recipient 
must ­accept whatever choice the allocator makes. How 
does the outcome of the game differ when the allocator 
­remains anonymous to the recipient and when the allo-
cator faces the recipient?
	 9.	 Consider a trust game between two players. Suppose the 
players care only about their own payoffs. The payoffs 
are such that, in equilibrium, the players do not trust each 
other, leading to a socially inefficient equilibrium. How 
could the game be changed so that in equilibrium the 
players do trust one another?
	10.	 In Thailand, many undergraduate students spend their sum-
mer in the rural area where they build libraries or classrooms 
for the locals without getting compensated. Do you think 
their behavior is rational? What could be the reason?
	11.	 What does it mean to say that a good exhibits network 
­externalities? Can you think of a good that you use 
­because it has network externalities?
	12.	 Only few tourist destinations are well-known and most-
visited in each country despite the fact that many other, 
and possibly better, destinations are available. What could 
be the explanation for this?
	13.	 What is an information cascade? Explain with examples.
Problems
	 1.	 Under the tax law in 2012, you could claim all of your 
charitable contributions as a deduction on your federal 
income tax (if you decided to itemize your deductions), 
and the top marginal tax rate was 35 percent.
	
a.	 What is the cost of a $100 charitable contribution un-
der 2012 tax law for someone who itemizes and who 
is in the top tax bracket?
	
b.	 The top marginal tax rate was raised to 39.6 percent in 
2013. How would this change affect the cost of a $100 
charitable contribution for someone who is in the top 
tax bracket?
	
c.	 One proposed change to the 2012 law would have left 
the top tax rate at 35 percent but would have placed a 
cap on itemized deductions of $25,000. Mr. Smith is 
in the top tax bracket and has $25,000 of deductions 
for property taxes and interest on a mortgage. How 
would this change affect Mr. Smith’s cost of a $100 
charitable contribution?
	 2.	 The organ donation policy in the United States is based 
on altruism. It is illegal to buy or sell human organs, so 
patients who need transplants will have to wait until they 
find an appropriate donor. In Iran, however, donors are 
compensated in cash for organs. The United States has 
a long waiting list for organs while there are hardly any 
such shortages in Iran. What does this tell you about 
altruism?
	 3.	 In a dorm room, four of you are discussing about buying 
a new clock. Each of you has $20 in your pocket. Sup-
pose that a clock costs $40, but the benefit of having a 
clock in the room is $6 for each of you. You come up with 
the idea that the cost of the clock should be distributed 
equally, that is, $10 per person.
	
a.	 If each of you cares only about yourself, show that 
contributing $0 is everyone’s dominant strategy.
	
b.	 Now suppose that each of you cares about the others in 
the room. Show that everyone in the room will contrib-
ute their entire $20 to the clock funds.

	 4.	 Suppose a limited number of tickets to a popular foot-
ball game had to be rationed among the public. There are 
three ways of doing this:
	
i.	Auction: The tickets will go to the highest bidder.
	
ii.	Lottery: A certain number of lucky people will get the 
tickets.

b.	 Which method is most likely to be considered “fair”? 
Rank the three methods in decreasing order of their 
perceived fairness.
	
c.	 Is the most efficient method also the most fair? What 
can you infer from this?
	 5.	 Assume that a charity hired you to improve their results 
on donations. You decide to mail letters asking for dona-
tions. You use three different types of letters:
	
	 Letter A: Control—standard letter asking for money.
	
	 Letter B: “Once and Done”—standard letter but with a 
statement at the front noting that: “Make one gift now and 
we’ll never ask for another donation again!”
	
	 Letter C: Soft “Once and Done”—an upfront statement 
of: “It only takes one gift to save a child’s life forever.”
The results are as follows:
	
	 Letter B (“Once and Done”) raises much more money 
than Letter A (Control): In most cases, at least double.
	
	 Letter C (Soft “Once and Done”) raises more money than 
­Letter A. 
	
	 Letter B raises about 50% more money than Letter C.
Of the concepts we have discussed in the chapter—social 
pressure, altruism, and herding—which do you think is 
most responsible for the success of treatment B?
	 6.	 In Mario Puzo’s The Godfather, Michael Corleone 
(played by Al Pacino in the movie version of the book) 
would like to meet with Virgil “The Turk” Sollozzo. 
­Michael was concerned that if he meets with Sollozzo, 
Sollozzo will kill him. We can think of their problem as 
a game. First, Michael decides whether or not to meet. 
If they do not meet, suppose Sollozzo and the Corleones 
each get a payoff of zero. If they do agree to meet then 
Sollozzo will decide whether or not to kill Michael. If he 
decides to kill him, then Sollozzo gets a payoff of 20 and 
the Corleones get a payoff of −10; if he does not kill him 
then each gets a payoff of 10. 
	
a.	 Draw the game tree.
	
b.	 Use backward induction to show that Michael will not 
agree to meet.
	
c.	 The Bocchicchio family had a well-deserved repu-
tation for ruthlessness. They had a simple code of 
vengeance; if you were responsible for the death of 
a member of their family, they would kill a mem-
ber of yours, regardless of the cost to them. Sup-
pose that when Michael meets with Sollozzo, he also 
hires a member of the Bocchicchio family to go to 
­Michael’s house. There, the “hostage” will be guarded 
by ­Michael’s men. If Michael does not return safely, 
Michael’s men will kill the hostage. The Bocchicchio 
family, seeking revenge, will blame Sollozzo for the 
death, since he made the promise that Michael will 
not be harmed, and will eventually kill Sollozzo. If 
Michael and Sollozzo are both killed, the Corleone 
family and Sollozzo each gets a payoff of −10. Use 
backward induction to determine how this game will 
be played.
	 7.	 In the 1950s, sociologists coined the term ­“homophily”—
love of the same—to explain our tendency to associate 
with people who are like us. Why does homophily make it 
difficult to estimate peer group effects empirically? How 
do the studies by Sacerdote and by Carrell, ­Hoekstra, 
and West discussed in this chapter avoid the homophily 
problem?
	 8.	 A group of social scientists were working on the Obama 
campaign in the 2012 presidential election. In order to 
persuade their supporters to vote, they focused on telling 
potential voters that most of the people in their neighbor-
hood were planning to vote. The traditional campaign ap-
proach involved telling voters that most of their neighbors 
did not vote and that not voting was a missed opportunity 
to help their country. Why do you think the Obama team 
felt that their new approach would work better than the 
old one?
	 9.	 There are two new restaurants in your neighborhood: a 
Thai restaurant, and a Chinese restaurant. You want to 
have Thai food but your close friend wants to go to  the 
Chinese restaurant.
	
a.	 Based on the optimization behavior of people, what 
would be the result?
	
b.	 What could change your answer to part (a)? If you 
two are planning to enter a science project competi-
tion as a team, and your close friend is really good at 
science, what is your best strategy?
	
c.	 Suppose that both of you decide to eat Chinese food. 
When you reach the place you find that all the tables 
there are empty but there is a very long queue in front 
of the Thai restaurant. What would you do? What do 
you call this phenomenon?
	10.	 A randomized experiment was conducted to see how 
others’ opinions affect a user’s ratings online. When-
ever a comment was added on a certain social news 
site, researchers gave it an up vote, down vote, or no 
vote. The researchers conducting the experiment noted 
that comments that were given an up vote were more 
likely to get another up vote as compared to the com-
ments that were given other ratings. What do you think 
could explain this?

	11.	 Three psychologists performed the following experi-
ment. They had groups of people ranging in size from 
just one person to as many as fifteen people stand on a 
street corner and stare up into the sky. They then observed 
how many passersby stopped and also looked up at the 
sky. They found that with only one person looking up, 
very few passersby stopped. If five people were staring 
up into the sky, then more passersby stopped, but most 
still ignored them. Finally, with fifteen people looking up, 
they found that 45 percent of passersby stopped and also 
stared up into the sky. How could you use the idea of an 
information cascade to explain this result?
	12.	 There was a sharp increase in the number of the long-
term unemployed following the recession that began in 
December 2007. Rand Ghayad did the following study 
to better understand long-term unemployment. He sent 
out 3,600 fake resumes in response to 600 job open-
ings. He varied the length of time his fake applicants 
had been out of work, how often they had switched 
jobs, and their work experience. He found that the lon-
ger the “applicants” were out of work, the less likely 
they were to be offered an interview. How could you 
use the idea of an information cascade to explain the 
results of this study?

Beginning with this chapter we focus on the economy as a 
whole. Economists refer to the total activity in an economy 
as aggregate economic activity. Macroeconomics is the 
study of aggregate economic activity.
The field of macroeconomics has been completely 
transformed in the last century. Before World War I, no 
country even had a system for measuring aggregate eco-
nomic activity. Back then, economists had to guess what 
was happening by looking at small pieces of the bigger 
picture. They studied things like the tonnage of steel that

Key Ideas
Macroeconomics is the study of aggregate economic activity.
National income accounting is a framework for calculating gross domestic 
product (GDP), which is a measure of aggregate economic output.
GDP can be measured in three different ways, and in principle 
these three methods should all yield the same answer: Production = 
Expenditure = Income.
GDP has limitations as a measure of economic activity and as a measure 
of economic well-being.
Economists use price indexes to measure the rate of inflation and to 
distinguish nominal GDP from real GDP (which holds prices fixed).
was manufactured or the volume of freight that was shipped on rail lines. These 
indicators were used to make educated guesses about aggregate economic 
­activity. If freight shipments were booming, it probably meant that the aggre-
gate economy was booming too, but nobody could be certain.
Today, we no longer have to guess what is happening in the economy. 
­Modern economies have a sophisticated system that measures the level of 
­aggregate activity. Careful measurement has made it possible to study the 
­aggregate economy and to design policies that improve its performance.
In this chapter, we set the stage by answering a foundational question: 
How does it all add up? How do we calculate the total market value of aggre-
gate economic production?
Until now we’ve been studying microeconomics: how individuals, households, firms, and 
governments make choices, and how those choices affect the allocation of resources, the 
well-being of other agents, and the prices of specific goods and services. Now it’s time to 
turn to macroeconomics. Recall from Chapter 1 that macroeconomics is the study of eco-
nomic aggregates and economy-wide phenomena, like the annual growth rate of a coun-
try’s total economic output, or the annual percentage increase in the total cost of living. 
Macro, which is shorthand for macroeconomics, is our new topic.
Macroeconomic analysis explains past patterns in aggregate economic activity and tries 
to predict future changes. For example, macroeconomists are interested in the enormous 
differences in income across countries and the creation of policies that would enable the 
countries with lower income to catch up.
Income per capita—in other words, income per person—in the United States is more 
than twice the level in Portugal, seven times the level in China, and over one-hundred times 
the level in Zimbabwe. How do we measure these cross-country differences? What causes 
them? How long will they persist?
China has been catching up to the United States very quickly. China’s economy has been 
growing four times as fast as the U.S. economy for over 30 years. Will China eventually 
match the level of U.S. income per capita? Will China surpass the United States? Or, will 
something else happen? For example, Japan experienced a long-run slowdown in economic 
growth starting around 1990, when its income per capita was about to overtake that of the

Why do growth rates slow down as income per capita rises?
What can be done to improve living conditions in impoverished 
­nations like Zimbabwe? Annual income per capita in Zimbabwe was 
$369 per year in 2010, barely enough for survival. Figuring out how 
to make low-income countries grow faster is a question of enormous 
importance for human well-being. Malnutrition and lack of health-
care cause tens of millions of annual deaths worldwide. If low-­
income countries could raise their annual growth by five percentage 
points, economists estimate that 50 million lives would be saved over 
the next 20 years.
To understand how to achieve long-run economic prosperity, we need 
to understand how different government policies augment or ­undermine 
economic growth. Corruption and confusion can lead policymakers 
down the wrong path. What are the bad policies, and will we avoid them 
in the future?
Macroeconomists also study the year-to-year, or “short-run,” fluc-
tuations in economic activity. Why does economic growth sometimes 
stall, or turn negative? We call an economic downturn lasting at least two quarters a 
­recession (a quarter is one-fourth of a year).
During recessions the unemployment rate, one of the most important macroeconomic 
variables, rises. A person is officially unemployed if three conditions are satisfied: he or 
she (1) does not have a job, (2) has actively looked for work in the prior four weeks, and 
(3) is currently available for work. Fluctuations in the unemployment rate—the fraction 
of the labor force that is unemployed—are covered in detail in Chapter 23.
To see an example of economic fluctuations, consider the period from 2007 to 2009, 
when the U.S. economy shrank by 4.3 percent and the unemployment rate rose from  
5 percent to 10 percent. At the same time, the world experienced a series of financial crises, 
including stock market crashes, collapsing housing prices, mortgage ­defaults, and bank 
failures. Why did these events occur, and what should governments have done to reduce 
their severity? What caused worldwide stock markets to lose over half their value in a 
year’s time? Why did so many major banks suddenly become insolvent?
Though the financial crisis of 2007–2009 was calamitous, it does not hold a candle 
to the Great Depression, which stretched from 1929 to 1939. From 1929 to 1933, pro-
duction fell by nearly 30 percent and the unemployment rate rose from 3 percent to 
25 percent of the labor force. In July 1932, the U.S. stock market reached the bottom 
Zimbabwe has spectacular natural resources like 
Victoria Falls but has not succeeded in developing a 
healthy economy or a robust tourism industry. Today, 
most of the visitors to the Falls stay on the Zambian 
side of the border.
Recessions are periods (lasting 
at least two quarters) in which 
aggregate economic output falls.
A worker is officially unemployed if 
he or she does not have a job, has 
actively looked for work in the prior 
four weeks, and is currently available 
for work.
The unemployment rate is the 
fraction of the labor force that is 
unemployed.
During the peak of the Great Depression 25 percent of the U.S. workforce 
didn’t have a job. Some towns put up signs discouraging job seekers from  
looking for employment in the area.

National income accounts measure 
the level of aggregate economic 
activity in a country.
The National Income and Product 
Accounts (NIPA) is the system of 
national income accounts that is 
used by the U.S. government.
To measure aggregate economic activity, we will need to take both quantities and prices 
into account. Let’s start by considering the hypothetical nation of Fordica. Fordica is a 
small country with only one employer, the Ford Motor Company, hereafter Ford, which 
produces 5 million cars each year. We’ll assume that Fordica has 200,000 citizens who 
happen to be the workers in Ford’s factories and also the owners of Ford’s stock. We’ll look 
at three different ways of thinking about Fordica’s economy—a production approach, an 
expenditure approach, and an income approach.
Production
As economists, we want to measure the total market value of annual production in the 
­nation of Fordica. To keep things simple, we’ll assume that Ford only needs its own 
­machines and the labor of Fordica’s citizens to build cars. We won’t worry right now 
about other inputs like steel and plastic. In fact, we’ll momentarily assume that these other 
inputs don’t exist.
To determine the market value of production in Fordica, we multiply the quantity of 
cars produced by the market price of each car. For example, if the market price of a Ford is 
$30,000, then Fordica has total annual production of:
(5 million cars) × ($30,000/car) = $150 billion.
By multiplying production quantities and market prices, we have a measure that reflects the 
market value of the goods produced in the economy during a particular period of time—in 
this example, one year. So the economy of Fordica produces goods with a market value of 
$150 billion per year.
Economists call this measure of aggregate economic activity gross domestic 
product, or GDP. We define GDP as the market value of the final goods and ser-
vices produced within the borders of a country during a particular period of time. 
GDP is always associated with a particular period of time, usually either a year 
or a quarter. For example, “GDP in 2015” is the market value of the final goods 
and services produced during the year 2015. “GDP in Q1:2015” is the market 
value of the final goods and services produced during the first quarter of the year 
2015. When talking about aggregate economic activity, the first quarter begins 
in January (January–March). The second quarter begins in April (April–June). 
The third quarter begins in July (July–September). The fourth quarter begins in  
October (October–December).
The definition of GDP includes the word final, which signifies that we are 
interested in valuing the end product in a chain of production. Components 
that are put together to make a final product—for instance, a car engine is a

of an 87 percent roller-coaster plunge from its peak in September, 1929. Are there poli-
cies that will enable us to avoid such disasters in the future? Or are we only able to re-
spond after the fact? Could the 2007–2009 financial crisis have turned into another Great  
Depression?
These are all important questions. To answer them, we need some special tools and 
new models. The first thing that we must do is measure the thing we are studying: a coun-
try’s aggregate economy. This is a seemingly impossible task. How can we measure the 
total activity of millions of economic agents? A hundred years ago, nobody knew how 
to do this. Fortunately, economic science has progressed. Today, we have a framework 
called the national income accounts, which we use to measure the entire economy. In 
the United States, the formal name for this system of national accounts is the National 
Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). Once we understand how the national income 
accounts works, we will be ready to start answering the interesting and important ques-
tions posed above.
The real-life Ford Motor Company em-
ploys about 200,000 workers worldwide. 
It manufactures 5–6 million cars per year, 
generating annual sales of $150 billion.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is 
the market value of the final goods 
and services produced within the 
borders of a country during a 
particular period of time.

component of a car—don’t get counted separately because that would imply double-
counting. The engine is implicitly counted when we value the final good, which is the 
complete car.
GDP is a measure of production, not a measure of sales to consumers. So something that 
is produced is counted in GDP even if it is not sold to a customer. For example, Ford will 
increase its inventory of (unsold) cars if it manufactures a car in 2015 but doesn’t sell it in 
2015. Production that goes into inventories counts as part of GDP.
Expenditure
There’s a second way to think about the level of aggregate activity in the economy of 
Fordica. This second method yields exactly the same answer as the previous production-
based method. Households and firms, some of whom reside in Fordica and some of whom 
reside in foreign countries, are going to buy all of the cars produced in this economy. If we 
add up all of these car purchases, we will find that the total expenditure on Fordica’s output 
is exactly $150 billion (again).
You might object by asking, “What if some of the goods don’t get sold?” Econo-
mists reply that those unsold goods are owned by a firm and those goods are therefore 
counted as part of the firm’s inventory. In the accounting system that we are describing 
here, that inventory is coded as having been “purchased” by the firm. Including both 
household car expenditures and firm inventory car expenditures, total expenditures sum 
to $150 billion.
Income
Let’s pause for a moment and ask why we are focusing on the goods and services 
that are produced by Fordica and purchased from producers in Fordica. We could 
instead have focused on what households and firms located in Fordica earned—in 
other words, their income. Isn’t that really what matters? Let’s consider that alterna-
tive approach, which ­happens to be the third way to think about the level of aggregate 
activity.
We’ve already calculated that Ford generates $150 billion of revenue. It pays $X to its 
workers, and it keeps ($150 billion − $X) for its owners. So the total income of all the 
workers and all of the owners in the nation of Fordica is
$X + ($150 billion − $X) = $150 billion.
Note that this is the identical amount—$150 billion—that we determined the economy 
­produced in our earlier calculations. It is also the value of expenditures on goods and 
­services produced in Fordica.
The fact that we keep coming up with the amount $150 billion is not a coincidence. 
Because of the way we’ve set up the system of national income accounts, every dollar of 
revenue must either go to some worker or be retained by the firm. So the total value of 
revenue must equal the total value of income received by workers and owners. This nec-
essary equivalence is referred to as an identity. Two variables are related by an identity 
when the two variables are defined in a way that makes them mathematically identical. 
The equivalence of the value of production, the value of expenditure, and the value of in-
come may not be apparent at first glance, but the three concepts 
have been defined so that they are necessarily identical.
You can now understand the following aggregate accounting 
identity:
Production = Expenditure = Income.
This identity is the key conceptual point of this chapter and the 
foundation on which most macroeconomic analysis is built. 
Now let’s delve more deeply into the system of national income 
accounts.
Two variables are related by an 
identity when the two variables are 
defined in a way that makes them 
mathematically identical.
Production ∙ Expenditure ∙ ­Income, 
is the key conceptual point of this 
chapter and the foundation on 
which most macroeconomic analysis 
is built.

Circular Flows
Factors of production are the inputs to the production process. Factors of production 
come in two key forms: capital and labor. We’ll have more to say about capital below, 
but for now it is helpful to simplify analysis by thinking of capital as physical capital—
for instance, land, factories, and machines. Both physical capital and labor are “owned” 
by households. Households own most of the physical capital in the economy, either 
directly or indirectly, because firms are owned by shareholders and most shareholders 
are households.
To understand how the three parts of the national income accounts—production, expen-
diture, and income—relate to one another, we need to think about the connections between 
households and firms. Firms, like the aircraft manufacturer Boeing, demand physical capital 
and labor and supply goods and services, like airplanes. Households demand goods and 
services, like air travel, and supply physical capital and labor.
We can explain the connections between households and firms with a circular flow 
diagram of the type displayed in Exhibit 19.1. This diagram highlights four kinds of eco-
nomic flows that connect households and firms. It includes the three kinds of flows that we 
discussed in the Fordica example (Production = Expenditure = Income) and adds a fourth 
category, Factors of Production.

2.	 Expenditure

4.	 Factors of Production
Exhibit 19.1 is admittedly a simplification of the economy because it leaves out important 
institutions like governments, markets, banks, and foreign countries. But the circular flow 
diagram provides a useful way of understanding the basic structure of a modern economy. 
Factors of production are the 
inputs to the production process.
Exhibit 19.1 Circular Flow Diagram
Economists have designed national income accounts that measure GDP in four equiva-
lent ways: production, expenditure, income, and factors of production. The circular flow 
diagram provides a visual way of remembering the relationships among these four equiv-
alent systems. Firms on the left produce goods and services (Production). Households 
on the right pay to buy those goods and services (Expenditure). Firms pay households to 
use households’ physical capital and labor (Income). Physical capital and labor are factors 
of production, which are put to use by firms (Factors). The national income accounting 
system is set up so that all four sets of flows are equal in market value.

The circular flow diagram presents two main decision makers—firms and households—
and it shows the four types of flows that we listed a moment ago.
Production represents the goods and services that are produced by firms. These goods 
and services are ultimately sold to households. We therefore draw an arrow from the firm 
sector to the household sector when talking about production. For example, a Ford ­Mustang 
starts life on the factory floor and ends up in someone’s garage.
Expenditure represents the payments for goods and services. These payments are made 
by households to firms. So we draw an arrow from the household sector to the firm sec-
tor when talking about expenditure. Continuing our earlier example, the household pays 
Ford $30,000 for a Mustang. Note that production and expenditure both involve goods and 
services, so these two flows are grouped together. They jointly represent the market for 
goods and services.
Income represents the payments that are made from firms to households to compensate 
the households for the use of their physical capital and labor (in other words, the use of 
the households’ factors of production). These payments include things like wages, salaries, 
interest, and dividends. We therefore draw an arrow from the firm sector to the household 
sector when talking about income. For instance, the average labor compensation received 
by Ford’s employees is $65,000 per year.
Factors of production represent the productive resources that are owned by house-
holds and used by firms in the production process. Because factors of production—both 
labor and physical capital—are directly or indirectly owned by households, we draw 
an arrow from the household sector to the firm sector when talking about factors of 
production.
The remarkable thing about these four types of transactions or “flows” is that they must 
all be exactly the same in market value. That’s where the system of national income ac-
counts comes in. If we do the accounting correctly, the market value of expenditure must 
equal the market value of production. Likewise, the market value of expenditure must 
equal the market value of income of the households in the economy. In the same way, the 
market value of income must equal the market value of the factors of ­production—labor 
and physical capital—that are receiving those income payments. These relationships are 
just mathematical consequences of the ways that we define the system of national income 
accounts.
Although the circular flow diagram contains four sets of flows with identical market 
values, in the discussion that follows we return to our earlier three-part system of national 
income accounts: Production = Expenditures = Income. In practice, these are the three 
parts of the national income accounts that government statisticians actually measure.
National Income Accounts: Production
We now revisit each of the methods for calculating national income and dig a little deeper. 
First, let’s consider production-based national income accounts. Production-based ac-
counts sum up the market value that is added by each domestic firm in the production 
process. More formally, production-based accounts measure each firm’s value added, 
Production-based accounting 
measures each firm’s value added, 
which is the firm’s sales revenue 
minus the firm’s purchases of 
intermediate products from other 
firms.

which is the firm’s sales revenue minus the firm’s purchases of intermediate products 
from other firms.
For example, consider the Dell computer company. Two decades ago, Dell assembled 
almost all of its computers in the United States. These days, Dell buys almost all of its 
computers from foreign manufacturers. When a customer orders a Dell computer, Dell 
instructs a foreign producer—usually one in Asia, Mexico, or Ireland—to assemble the 
computer. Dell then imports the machine from the foreign factory and sends the machine 
to its U.S. customer. The laptop that Dell purchases from a foreign producer is an interme-
diate product in Dell’s production.
Dell has also shifted its business strategy on the retail side. Dell now markets some, 
though by no means all, of its computers through other companies. For example, you can 
buy a Dell computer at BestBuy, Staples, or Walmart.
Exhibit 19.2 puts all of these pieces together. As the exhibit shows, consumers  
buy about $50 billion worth of Dell computers in the United States each year. About 
$15 billion of sales of Dell computers comes from customers who buy at third-party re-
tailers, like Walmart. About $35 billion of sales comes from customers who buy directly  
from Dell.
Retailers like Walmart pay Dell about two-thirds of the revenue that Walmart re-
ceives from the sale of Dell’s computers. So Dell receives $10 billion from third-
party retailers and another $35 billion from direct-sale customers: $45 billion in total. 
Dell pays its foreign suppliers $30 billion for assembling Dell computers. That leaves 
Dell with $15 billion in net revenue from its U.S. operations. Out of that revenue, Dell 
pays its domestic costs, such as employee wages and construction costs for building 
warehouses.
Let’s determine what value Dell (including its domestic employees) has added to the 
production process. That amount will be Dell’s contribution to U.S. gross domestic product 
(GDP). The answer is $15 billion, which is a lot less than the $50 billion that U.S. consum-
ers spent on Dell computers. We came to $15 billion by taking the revenue that Dell itself

($10 billion) and from direct 
sales to retail customers 
($35 billion). Dell pays its

ers) $30 billion. The dif­

received, $45 billion, and subtracting Dell’s payments of $30 billion to foreign suppliers 
for intermediate goods.
Total sales of Dell computers to retail customers:
$15 billion through other retailers + $35 billion in direct sales = $50 billion.
Revenue received by Dell:
$10 billion from third-party retailers + $35 billion from direct sales = $45 billion.
Revenue received by Dell minus purchases of intermediate products = Dell’s value added:
$45 billion received by Dell − $30 billion paid for intermediate products = $15 billion.
We could go on to ask what else would get counted as U.S. GDP in this chain of eco-
nomic activity (even if it isn’t counted as part of Dell’s contribution). The foreign fac-
tories don’t count toward U.S. GDP. The production of the foreign laptop factories is 
part of a foreign country’s GDP because the factories are within the boundaries of those 
foreign countries.
The production-based accounting system implies that importing some good from abroad 
and selling it to a U.S. consumer at the exact same import price doesn’t add value. How-
ever, importing something for $1 and reselling it for $1.50 is a source of production—$0.50 
of value added to be precise. Dell’s ability to mark up its price relative to the import cost 
comes from a combination of marketing, corporate reputation, customer convenience, and 
bundled ­services like access to call centers.
Likewise, Walmart’s ability to sell Dell’s computers is another source of U.S. value 
added. Walmart isn’t making anything in a factory, but its ability to buy goods at whole-
sale prices and sell those goods at higher retail prices reflects its value added and conse-
quently its contribution to GDP. Walmart’s value added is not the revenue that Walmart 
receives from its customers. Walmart’s value added is the difference between the revenue 
that Walmart receives when it sells Dell’s computers and the amount that Walmart pays 
Dell for the laptops. Dell’s laptops are Walmart’s intermediate goods. In our example, all 
of the third-party retailers receive $15 billion in revenue from selling Dell’s computers and 
pay Dell $10 billion for those computers. Through this chain of transactions, the third-party 
retailers generate value added of $5 billion ($15 billion − $10 billion), which is counted as 
part of production-based U.S. GDP.
National Income Accounts: Expenditure
Let’s now turn to the second, mathematically equivalent, way of measuring GDP. 
­Expenditure-based national income accounts measure the purchases of goods and 
services produced in the domestic economy. These purchases can be assigned to five 
categories.
(1) Consumption. This is the market value of consumption goods and consumption 
services that are bought by domestic households. Such consumption expenditures cover 
everything from Frisbees to foot massages. This category includes all consumption expen-
ditures except expenditures that are made on residential construction (which is part of the 
next category).
(2) Investment. This is the market value of new physical capital that is bought by do-
mestic households and domestic firms. This is technically called private investment but 
is usually just referred to as investment. Such new physical capital includes residential 
houses, business inventories (for example, the Camaro waiting to be bought at a Chevrolet 
dealership), business structures (for example, office towers and factories), and business 
equipment (for example, computers and freight trains). When macroeconomists talk about 
investment, they are referring only to purchases of new physical capital and not to financial 
investments like purchases of stocks or bonds. This difference in usage generates lots of 
confusion, because noneconomists are more familiar with the everyday financial meaning 
of “making an investment” (for instance, buying a mutual fund or contributing money to an 
Individual Retirement Account), which is not what macroeconomists have in mind. In the 
19.2
Consumption is the market 
value of consumption goods and 
consumption services that are 
bought by domestic households.
Investment is the market value of 
new physical capital that is bought 
by domestic households and 
domestic firms.

language of macroeconomics, investment is only the purchase of new physical capital, like 
a new supertanker or a new factory or a new house.
(3) Government expenditure. This is the market value of government purchases of 
goods and services. Tanks and bridges are two examples of government expenditure. For 
the purposes of the national income accounts, government expenditure excludes transfer 
payments (for example, Social Security payments to retirees) and also excludes interest 
paid on government debt. These categories are omitted because they represent payments 
to other agents in the economy who will use those payments to buy goods and services. 
To avoid double-counting, these government payments to other agents are not counted as 
government expenditure on goods and services.
(4) Exports. This is the market value of all domestically produced goods and services 
that are sold to households, firms, and governments in foreign countries.
These first four categories are nonoverlapping. In other words, there is no double-counting. 
Each purchase appears in only one of the four categories above.
(5) Imports. This is the market value of all foreign-produced goods and services that 
are sold to domestic households, domestic firms, and the domestic government. Note that 
imports are already part of consumption expenditures, investment expenditures, and gov-
ernment expenditures. Hence, imports overlap with the first three categories in our list. 
We’ll explain why this overlap is useful in a moment.
We are now ready to use these five categories to calculate gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP). Let Y represent the total market value of goods and services that are 
produced in the domestic economy, which is GDP. We’ll use C to represent con-
sumption: household expenditures on consumption of goods and services, includ-
ing expenditure on consumption of goods and services produced domestically and 
abroad. Variable I will represent investment: expenditures on investment goods by 
private agents (excluding the government), including investment goods produced 
domestically and abroad. We’ll let G represent goverment expenditure: government 
purchases of goods and services, including goods and services produced domesti-
cally and abroad.
We need to adjust for the fact that exports (goods produced in the United States, which 
are sold to households, firms, and governments in foreign countries) count as part of U.S. 
GDP. On the other hand, imports (domestic expenditures on goods and services produced 
abroad) don’t count as part of U.S. GDP.
Let X represent exports: the value of goods and services pro-
duced in the domestic economy and purchased by economic 
agents in foreign countries. Let M represent imports: the value of 
goods and services produced in foreign countries and purchased 
by economic agents in the domestic economy. Finally, note that 
exports minus imports, or X − M, is the trade balance. When  
X is greater than M, exports are greater than imports, so the coun-
try runs a trade surplus. When X is less than M, exports are less 
than imports, so the country runs a trade deficit.
We can now calculate the total value of expenditures on goods 
and services produced in the domestic economy:
Y = C + I + G + X − M    (National Income Accounting Identity).
The GDP equation says that the market value of domestic pro-
duction is equal to the total expenditure of domestic economic 
agents, C + I + G, plus the expenditure of foreign agents on exports, X, minus the value 
of domestic expenditure that was imported, M. We subtract imports because expenditure 
on foreign production is included in the terms C, I, and G. To remove this expenditure on 
foreign production, we subtract imports, M.
This identity, which decomposes GDP into (C + I + G + X − M), is so important that 
we give it a name: the national income accounting identity. We’ll use it many times in 
our study of the macroeconomy.
The national income accounting 
identity, Y = C + I + G + X − M,  
decomposes GDP into con­
sumption + investment + 
government expenditure +  
exports − imports.
The GDP equation says that the mar-
ket value of domestic production is 
equal to the total expenditure of  
domestic economic agents (C ∙ I ∙ G),  
plus the expenditure of foreign 
agents on exports (X) minus the value 
of ­domestic expenditure that was 
­imported (M).
Government expenditure is 
the market value of government 
purchases of goods and services.
Exports are the market value of 
all domestically produced goods 
and services that are purchased by 
households, firms, and governments 
in foreign countries.
Imports are the market value of 
all foreign-produced goods and 
services that are sold to domestic 
households, domestic firms, and the 
domestic government.

overnment statisticians measure gross domestic product, the total market value 
of economic output. In the United States, this work is conducted by the Bureau 
of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce. In 2013, the Bureau 
of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. GDP was $16.8 trillion. That year, the U.S. 
population was 316.4 million people. So GDP per person—in other words, GDP per 
capita—was about $53,100.
It is also valuable to study the components of GDP using the national income ac-
counting identity that we just discussed. Exhibit 19.3 reports this data for the United 
States in 2013. We can observe several important properties. First, the overwhelming 
share of GDP is represented by household consumption. In 2013, consumption rep-
resented 69 percent of GDP. Government expenditure comes in far behind, with only 
19 percent of GDP. Investment follows next with 16 percent. Exports account for 14 per-
cent of GDP and imports account for 16 percent of GDP. Notice that imports appear in 
Exhibit 19.3 with a negative sign, reminding you that when calculating GDP, imports 
are subtracted out after we add up all of the other components. Confirm that the items in 
Exhibit 19.3 add up to GDP (with a bit of rounding error).
The fraction of GDP in each category—these are called GDP shares—has been 
relatively constant over the past 80 years. Exhibit 19.4 reports the GDP shares from 
1929 to 2013. In other words, Exhibit 19.4 reports the ratio of each expenditure cat-
egory to GDP. The sum of these shares, minus the import share, must sum to one. 
Exhibit 19.4 shows that consumption has consistently represented about two-thirds of 
economic activity.
Government expenditures have consistently hovered around 20 percent of economic 
activity, with two exceptions. First, at the very beginning of the sample period, govern-
ment expenditures accounted for only 10 percent of GDP. Large governments did not 
become the norm in the modern world until after World War II.
Second, government expenditures temporarily absorbed a particularly large share of 
GDP during World War II. The high point was nearly 50 percent of GDP. It is natural

U.S. gross domestic product in 2013 was $16.8 trillion. Each component of 
GDP is expressed as a percentage of GDP, or a GDP “share” (component/

ing also causes small discrepancies between the column in dollars and the 
column in shares.

that during major wars the government accounts for a much larger share of a country’s 
economic output because a war effort is run almost exclusively by the government. The 
rise in government activity during World War II is mirrored by a fall in consumption and a 
fall in (private) investment.
There is one final property that is important to note in Exhibit 19.4: the export and 
import shares have both been getting larger in absolute value over the past 80 years. Trans-
portation technology has made it less expensive to ship goods anywhere in the world. Infor-
mation technology has also made it easier for residents of one country to provide services 
to residents of other countries (think of call centers in India). Falling transportation and 
telecommunication costs have fueled an ongoing rise in trade, as optimizers look beyond 
their national borders to buy the goods and services that they want. Rising exports show 
up as a rising share of exports. Because imports appear as a negative number in the GDP 
identity, rising imports show up as a movement in the import share further below zero.

Capital income is any form of 
payment that derives from owning 
physical or financial capital.
National Income Accounting: Income
So far, we’ve taken a detailed look at the economy by studying GDP as a pro-
duction concept—that was the discussion of value added—and then by studying 
GDP as an expenditure concept—that was the discussion of the national income 
accounting identity, Y = C + I + G + X − M. As we explained at the start of the 
chapter, we can also study GDP as an income concept. Recall that income-based 
national accounts track the income of the various agents in the economy. Recall, 
too, that aggregate income is identical to aggregate production and aggregate ex-
penditure. So if aggregate expenditure was $16.8 trillion in 2013, then aggregate 
production and aggregate income were also each $16.8 trillion in 2013.
Income payments come in two key categories. First, there is income paid for peo-
ple’s work. We call this labor income. This category includes familiar items like wages, 
salary, workers’ health insurance, and workers’ pension benefits. It also includes every 
other way that people are directly or indirectly paid for their labor, including signing 
bonuses, free parking spaces at work, and the value to the CEO of being able to use the 
company jet on weekends.
The second category of income payments is income (or benefits) realized by the 
owners of physical capital (for instance, a house) or financial capital (for instance, 
stocks and bonds). We refer to this as capital income. This category includes many 
things: for example, dividends paid to shareholders, interest paid to lenders, earnings 
retained by corporations, rent payments made to landlords, and the benefits of living 
in your own house!
This division into labor income and capital income may encourage the mislead-
ing intuition that people who receive labor income are different from those who 
receive capital income. However, most people in the economy receive both. For example, 
a 50-year-old worker with a job, a house, and a retirement savings account will receive 
labor income from her job, capital income from her house (the implicit value of having a 
roof over her head), and capital income from her retirement savings account (dividends).
It is also important to remember that firms are owned by households. Firms can’t own 
themselves. When a firm earns income, it is the owners of the firm who are the ultimate 
Home ownership is an important source 
of capital income. If you own your home, 
you don’t need to pay rent (though you 
may need to pay interest on a mortgage). 
Economists consider the “nonpayment” 
of rent to be a form of capital income to 
homeowners. The implied income from 
home ownership is the amount of money 
the owner would have needed to spend 
had he or she been renting the same kind 
of residence from a landlord.
Economists use the national income accounting identities to 
study saving and investment. To derive an equation for sav-
ing, start with GDP, which is equivalent to national income, 
and subtract the things that households and the govern-
ment consume. In other words, subtract consumption ex-
penditures and government expenditure. We then find that
Saving = Y − C − G
= (C + I + G + X − M) − C − G
= I + X − M.
To get from the first equation to the second equation, we 
replaced Y with its components from the national income 
accounting identity: C + I + G + X − M. The final equa-
tion in our derivation can be written out in words:
Saving = Investment + Exports – Imports.
In most countries, exports and imports are relatively close 
in magnitude. In that case, exports minus imports will be 
close to zero, enabling us to further simplify our expression:
Saving = Investment.
This simplified expression is just an approximation, since 
exports and imports are never exactly the same when a 
country trades with other countries. However, this equation 
will be exactly true for a closed economy, which is an econ-
omy that does not trade with other countries. In a closed 
economy, exports and imports are both equal to zero.
Let’s now take the last equation and divide both sides 
by GDP. You’ll then see that the saving rate (saving di-
vided by GDP) is equal to the investment rate (investment 
divided by GDP):
Saving
GDP
= Investment
GDP
.
Using U.S. data from 1929 to 2013, we can compare 
the saving rate and the investment rate, year-by-year. 
­Exhibit  19.5 graphs a scatter plot of these two ratios. 
Each point plots a single year of data: the saving rate 
for that year is on the horizontal axis and the investment 
rate for that year is on the vertical axis. As you can see, 
the saving rate and the investment rate move together 
very closely and the cloud of data points stays relatively 
close to the 45 degree line (which is plotted in red).
Exhibit 19.5 implies that saving is roughly equal to in-
vestment. We’ll use this fact in the next chapter when we 
start to discuss the determinants of economic growth, 
­including investment in physical capital.

Before leaving our homes in the morning, many of us go to the Web to look up the cur-
rent weather conditions. Some weather Web sites report a single temperature and a simple 
picture.
This weather report leaves a lot of details out. Humidity, haze, wind speed, and hun-
dreds of other factors all contribute to the actual conditions that we experience as we walk 
to work or sprint for the train. Nevertheless, commuters are grateful for a simple summary 
that tells them most of what they need to know about the local weather.
Likewise, GDP and national income accounting is a useful system for taking the tem-
perature of the economy. It’s not perfect, and it necessarily leaves out a lot of details. Nev-
ertheless, GDP does a good job of telling us much of what we need to know about the level, 
fluctuations, and long-run trends in economic activity. With this tool in hand, we are ready to 
try to measure and predict the behavior of the entire economy.
But it’s important to discuss what GDP leaves out, so we know what GDP can and 
can’t do. GDP has many quirks that limit its value as a measure of societal well-being 
or even of overall economic activity.
Economists are a bold breed. Measuring the production of an entire economy can’t be 
done exactly right, but we do it anyway. Sticking our collective heads in the sand and waiting

beneficiaries. Most large firms have shares that are traded on the stock market. In this case, 
the firm is owned by hundreds of millions of shareholders around the globe. The beneficia-
ries of capital income are these shareholders.
Finally, it is interesting to ask what fraction of income payments are labor payments 
and what fraction of income payments are capital payments. In the United States and other 
developed economies, nearly two-thirds of ­income payments goes to labor and one-third 
goes to capital.

reef off the Italian coast in 2012. Thirty-
two people died and the ship, which cost 
$600 million to build, was sold for scrap. 
The loss of physical capital is an example 
of capital depreciation. GDP does not 
take account of capital depreciation.
for the perfect system of measurement to be invented is not a satisfactory alternative. We 
believe that it’s much better to have an imperfect measure than to throw up our hands and 
give up.
Physical Capital Depreciation
We start by noting that GDP omits physical capital depreciation, which is the 
­reduction of the value of physical capital due to obsolescence or wear and tear. 
Most productive processes cause physical capital to lose some value over time. 
Driving a tractor trailer wears down the brakes and the tires. Pumping oil from the 
ground depletes remaining petroleum reserves.
If we want a complete picture of economic production, we might want to take 
­account of the physical capital depreciation that accompanies production and 
­subtract that depreciation from the value of total production.
Most governments do try to measure depreciation in their national accounts, 
though they do not subtract depreciation when calculating GDP. Depreciation anal-
yses tend to find that depreciation is equal to about 10–15 percent of GDP. For 
example, the U.S. national accounts estimate that depreciation is large enough so 
that if it were subtracted, it would offset 13 percent of GDP.
This sounds like a problem that has been solved, but the situation is actually more 
complicated. First, the depreciation estimates in the national accounts are more like 
sophisticated guess work—“guesstimates”—than something that we know how to 
measure precisely. Second, the depreciation estimates don’t even attempt to cover lots of 
hard-to-analyze categories like oil reserve depreciation. Third, thinking about physical capi-
tal depreciation raises many related questions. For example, changes in our health are also 
left out of the GDP calculations completely. Some productive processes make workers less 
healthy—for example, backbreaking work in a coal mine or exposure to toxic chemicals in 
a manufacturing process. If we take account of physical capital depreciation, should we also 
try to calculate depreciation of health and human capital (a concept that we will return to in 
the next chapter)?
In sum, trying to measure depreciation is a complicated conceptual issue and the stan-
dard measure of GDP does not account for any type of depreciation.
Home Production
GDP also stumbles when it comes to home production, which is not included anywhere 
in the national income accounts. If you grow your own flowers (without buying seeds or 
shovels from a plant store), the bouquet you create is not measured in GDP, but if you buy 
domestically grown flowers from the local florist, every dollar is included in GDP. If you 
knit your own wool cap using wool from the sheep that you keep on your farm, nothing 
shows up in GDP, but if you knit a cap from the same wool and sell it to your neighbor, 
every dollar counts in GDP. Sometimes the accounting rules are laughable. For example, 
GDP goes down if you marry your gardener.
All economists agree that excluding home production is a flaw in the GDP accounts, 
but we do not yet have a way to measure home production. There is no market transaction, 
market price, or measurable quantity that accompanies home production. What is the market 
value of a home-cooked meal? Families have been debating that philosophical question for 
a long time.
If we were only talking about a home-cooked meatloaf here and there, this omission 
would not be a big deal. But a large fraction of economic activity takes place in the home. 
Most families maintain their own homes by personally dusting, vacuuming, mopping, and 
polishing them. People often mow their own grass, rake their own leaves, and weed their 
own flower beds. Most families eat most of their meals at home.
Finally, there is the very important category of childcare, which is illustrated by the 
following example. Suppose there are two parents in different households, Avery and 
Micah. Suppose that they each have kids. If Avery and Micah stay home to care for their 
own kids, there is no market transaction and the childcare is not recorded in GDP. On 
the other hand, if Avery takes care of Micah’s kids and is paid a salary of $40,000, and 
Micah takes care of Avery’s kids and receives a salary of $40,000, then annual GDP rises 
by the sum, $80,000. Note that the children are being cared for regardless of whether this

care is measured by GDP. When each parent cares for his or her own kids, childcare is 
produced without a market transaction and childcare is omitted from GDP. When each 
parent takes care of the other family’s kids, childcare generates a market transaction and 
GDP is $80,000 higher.
There are two reasons why economists lose sleep worrying about all of this. First, a large 
fraction of the adult population does stay at home to work. We know from surveys of time 
use that people who are not officially employed are doing a lot more than watching reruns of 
Breaking Bad. Second, even people with formal jobs are engaged in some home production. 
If you hold down a day job, it is likely that you also do some cleaning or cooking or childcare 
when you get home from work.
Let’s quantify these effects. In the United States, where the total population was  
316.4 million in 2013, there were approximately 144 million working-age adults with 
­formal jobs and another 52 million working-age adults without formal jobs.
Many of the people without formal jobs are engaged in a considerable amount of home 
production, including food preparation, household maintenance, and childcare. Suppose 
that the working-age adults without formal jobs have an average annual home production 
of $20,000 per person. That number averages over people with different amounts of home 
production. Some people who aren’t in the formal labor force care for newborn triplets and 
others watch YouTube all day.
In addition, suppose that the people with formal jobs outside the home also do home 
production of $10,000 per year.
Adding up all of these different sources of home production we get annual home pro-
duction in the United States of $2.5 trillion:
(52 million people) × ($20,000/person)  
+ (144 million people) × ($10,000/person) = $2.5 trillion.
In an economy with $16.8 trillion of market-based production, $2.5 trillion represents 
nearly 15 percent of additional economic production that has been overlooked in the GDP 
calculation. Many other estimates of home production are even higher.
The Underground Economy
The underground economy—transactions that are intentionally hidden from government 
statisticians—represents another hole in the GDP accounts. This includes the plumber 
who asks to be paid in cash and the taxicab driver who negotiates a lower rate if you 
would just agree to let him turn off the meter. Plumbing and cab driving are perfectly le-
gal, but some workers hide income to avoid paying taxes. Earnings from legal professions 
may also be hidden for other reasons, for instance, an acrimonious divorce or the lack of 
a work visa.
The underground economy also includes markets in illegal professions. Drug dealing 
and prostitution top the list (though some communities have legalized some of these activi-
ties). Illegal drug sales alone are estimated to be equal in magnitude to 1 percent of GDP. 
For the U.S. economy, that is equivalent to the value of all agricultural production.
In developed economies with excellent law enforcement systems—think of countries 
like Switzerland, Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States—transactions in the under-
ground economy add up to about 10 percent of GDP. In developing countries, the fraction 
of underground economic activity is generally much higher. For example, in Mexico, the 
underground economy is estimated to be half of measured GDP.
Some countries, including Ireland, Italy, and the United Kingdom have recently started 
to include underground economic activity, including illicit drug purchases and prostitution, 
in their GDP calculations.
Negative Externalities
Negative externalities occur when an economic activity has a spillover cost that does not 
affect those directly engaged in the activity. Positive externalities occur when an eco-
nomic activity has a spillover benefit that does not affect those directly engaged in the 
activity. Externalities—both negative and positive—are usually omitted from the GDP 
calculations. Consider a coal-powered electrical plant generating power for thousands of

in GDP, even when it is not a 
market-based activity?

homes and simultaneously belching out a continuous stream of toxic 
airborne pollutants. GDP counts the electricity produced, but fails to 
subtract the cost of the pollution.
Sometimes negative externalities even get counted as positive con-
tributors to economic output. For example, property crimes, like theft, 
lead people to purchase locks and other security devices. In some cases, 
property owners hire guards to safeguard their possessions. All of this 
preventive activity counts as positive contributions to GDP.
Gross Domestic Product vs. Gross National Product
As we’ve already explained, GDP is the market value of everything 
produced within the borders of a country during a particular period of 
time. So GDP includes both the production of a country’s residents and 
the production of visitors. For example, if a U.S. worker spends two 
months working in Singapore, her production will be counted in the 
GDP of Singapore and omitted from U.S. GDP. Likewise, if a Japanese auto company—
like Honda —opens a plant in Alabama, the value added of this plant will be counted in 
U.S. GDP and not in Japanese GDP. This would be the case even if the plant were operated 
entirely by robots and didn’t have one U.S. employee. The plant is operating within the 
borders of the United States, so its value added is counted in U.S. GDP.
At first glance, you might wonder if cross-border activities amount to much. In fact, 
there are large amounts of such activity. For example, about 70 percent of the “Japanese” 
cars that are sold in the United States are now manufactured at plants in Canada, Mexico, 
and the United States.
With facts like this in mind, economists have constructed a measure of aggregate eco-
nomic activity that includes only the output of factors of production owned by residents of 
a particular country: gross national product (GNP). U.S. GNP includes the production of 
a worker who normally resides in the United States, even if the production occurred when 
the worker was temporarily working abroad. For example, if a U.S. professor gives a sum-
mer course at the National University of Singapore, her two-month salary, which was paid 
by the National University of Singapore, would be included in U.S. GNP and excluded from 
Singapore’s GNP.
Likewise, U.S. GNP would exclude the value added of machines owned by a Japanese 
car manufacturer, even if those machines operate in Alabama. On the other hand, U.S. GNP 
would include the value added of U.S. workers who are employed in a Japanese auto plant 
in Alabama. U.S. GNP is carefully constructed to count only the value added of factors of 
production possessed or owned by U.S. residents, no matter where those factors of produc-
tion operate in the world.
GNP is therefore a measure of national production, where the word national signifies 
the factors of production—like capital and labor—possessed or owned by the residents 
of a particular nation. To calculate GNP, begin with GDP and first add in the production 
of U.S.-owned factors of production that operate within the borders of foreign countries. 
Then subtract the production of foreign-owned factors of production that operate within the 
borders of the United States.
Gross national product = (Gross domestic product)
+ (Production of U.S.-owned capital and labor within the borders of foreign countries)
− (Production of foreign-owned capital and labor within U.S. borders).
Plugging in the actual (rounded) numbers for 2013, we find that U.S. GNP ($17.1 ­trillion) 
is higher than U.S. GDP ($16.8 trillion). Specifically, the market value of production of U.S. 
capital and labor within the borders of foreign countries ($0.8 trillion) exceeds the market 
value of production of foreign capital and labor within U.S. borders ($0.6 trillion). In 2013, 
U.S. GNP was 1.5 percent larger than U.S. GDP.
For a few countries, GNP and GDP diverge much more substantially. For example, 
Kuwait—a wealthy oil exporter in the Persian Gulf—owns a very large portfolio of foreign 
assets, and residents of foreign countries own comparatively few assets inside ­Kuwait. 
The income from Kuwait’s foreign assets is counted in Kuwait’s GNP but excluded 
from ­Kuwait’s GDP. Accordingly Kuwait’s GNP is substantially larger—generally about 
The societal cost of pollution is not subtracted  
from GDP.
Gross national product (GNP) is 
the market value of production 
generated by the factors of 
production—both capital and 
labor—possessed or owned by the 
residents of a particular nation.

10 percent larger—than its GDP. However, Kuwait’s situation is uncommon. For most 
countries, GNP and GDP are nearly the same.
Leisure
Leisure is another sore spot in the GDP system. The GDP accounts give an economy no 
credit for producing leisure. However, most people would agree that leisure is a key in-
gredient in human well-being. For example, in time-use surveys, people report that they 
are happiest when they are socializing.2 Likewise, people report that they are the least 
happy when they are at work or commuting to and from work. When you think about GDP 
comparisons across countries, you need to remember that different countries are working 
at different levels of intensity. Of course, the goal in life is not to maximize your income 
by working every moment that you can. If that were our goal, nobody would ever retire or 
take a vacation. A more reasonable goal is to maximize human well-being—this is another 
example of optimization. GDP tells us how many material goods are being produced by an 
economy, but it does not tell us whether all of those material achievements are being used 
to optimize human happiness.
Does GDP Buy Happiness?
Despite the omission of leisure, GDP per capita is often used as a summary measure of the 
well-being of a society. We would like to know whether GDP per capita is actually a good 
predictor of human happiness. Social scientists do not have a foolproof way of measuring 
happiness, but we do have a crude way of gauging whether a person is satisfied with life: 
ask them. It’s not an ideal method—for instance, people may not tell the truth: “I’m fine, 
how are you?”—but it’s a start. When survey researchers ask about happiness in millions of 
interviews around the world, some remarkable patterns appear in the data.
GDP per capita turns out to be an excellent predictor of life satisfaction. Exhibit 19.6 
displays a positive relationship between GDP per capita and self-reports of life satisfac-
tion in a large sample of countries. The countries with higher levels of GDP per capita 
report higher levels of life satisfaction. The exhibit plots GDP per capita on the horizontal 
axis and average life satisfaction on the vertical axis. Life satis-
faction was measured with a 10-point scale. Each circle repre-
sents a different country, and the size of the circle reflects the size 
of the population in that country. The large circle on the right is 
the United States. The two large circles on the left are India and 
China.
GDP per capita turns out to be an 
­excellent predictor of life satisfaction.

The same relationship also shows up within each country. In other words, when econo-
mists study household-level data on income and life satisfaction, we find that low-income 
households within a country report substantially lower life satisfaction than higher-income 
households within the same country.3
GDP is particularly useful as a tool for determining how the overall economy is growing. 
To implement this growth analysis, we would like to separate the increase in the value of 
GDP that is due to overall price increases (in other words, inflation, a concept we will de-
fine below) from the increase in the value of GDP that is due to increases in the quantity 
and quality of goods and services.
For example, suppose the country of Fordica makes 10 cars in 2012 and 10 identical 
cars in 2013. Here we’ll make the simplifying assumption that the quality of the cars hasn’t 
changed over time. Economists have sophisticated tools for handling improvements in 
quality, but we’ll sidestep those issues to keep the analysis as simple as possible. Holding 
quality fixed, assume that the price of each car rises from $30,000 to $40,000 from 2012 to 
2013. In this case, GDP in 2012 would be (10 cars × $30,000/car) = $300,000 and GDP 
in 2013 would be (10 cars × $40,000/car) = $400,000. At first glance, the economy has 
grown by 33 percent, or
(GDP in 2013) - (GDP in 2012)
GDP in 2012
= ($400,000) - ($300,000)
$300,000
= 1
3 = 0.33 = 33%.
But the actual number of cars produced hasn’t grown at all. It’s still 10 cars. If we counted 
the number of cars, rather than their market value, the growth rate of the economy from 
2012 to 2013 would have been 0 percent. We don’t want to pat ourselves on the back 
­because prices have gone up (holding car quality fixed as we are in this example).
Naturally, we would like to separate the growth that is due simply to price increases 
from the growth that is due to increases in the production of goods and services. To do this, 
we contrast the concepts of nominal GDP and real GDP. Nominal GDP is the standard 
GDP measurement that we’ve been discussing throughout this chapter. Nominal GDP 
is the total market value of production, using current prices to determine value per unit 
produced.
Real GDP is based on the same idea as nominal GDP—summing up the market value 
of the quantities of final goods and services—but real GDP uses prices from a base year 
that may be different from the year that the quantities were produced. To illustrate this 
idea, let’s take 2012 as the base year. In our example, the price of a Ford was $30,000 in 
2012. Now let’s assume that 10 Fords were produced in 2012 and 10 (identical) Fords were 
produced in 2013. To calculate real GDP, we use the 2012 prices to value the output in both 
2012 and 2013. So real GDP was $300,000 in 2012 and was still $300,000 in 2013. Using 
the concept of real GDP, we see that there was no growth between 2012 and 2013. That 
makes sense—the number of cars produced did not change.
To increase clarity, economists use the words nominal or real in their analysis to make 
certain that the reader knows which of the two concepts is being discussed. On the other 
hand, journalists generally assume that growth of real GDP is the only game in town. When 
a headline announces, “U.S. Growth Slows to 2.2%,” the readers are assumed to know, 
without being told, that real growth is being discussed.
So far we have studied real GDP in the simple case of a one-good economy. Naturally, 
this concept can be applied to an economy with any number of goods and services. To get 
some practice using this concept, let’s consider the case of an economy that manufactures 
two types of cars: Fords and Chevrolets. Exhibit 19.7 reports the raw data with which we 
will work.
Let’s start by calculating nominal GDP. We simply add up the total market value of 
goods sold in each year, using current prices. In 2012, nominal GDP is
(10 Fords) × ($30,000/Ford) + (5 Chevrolets) × ($20,000/Chevrolet) = $400,000.
Real vs. Nominal
19.4
Nominal GDP is the total value 
of production (final goods and 
services), using current market 
prices to determine the value of 
each unit that is produced.
Real GDP is the total value of 
production (final goods and 
services), using market prices from a 
specific base year to determine the 
value of each unit that is produced.

In 2013, nominal GDP is
(10 Fords) × ($40,000/Ford) + (20 Chevrolets) × ($25,000/Chevrolet) = $900,000.
Check these totals against the values in the column of Exhibit 19.7 labeled Nominal GDP.
To calculate real GDP, we will use 2012 as the base year. That means that we keep using 
2012 prices in the calculation of both 2012 and 2013 real GDP. This doesn’t rock the boat 
for 2012. Real GDP for 2012 is calculated with 2012 quantities and 2012 prices (exactly 
matching our calculation of nominal GDP in 2012):
(10 Fords) × ($30,000/Ford) + (5 Chevrolets) × ($20,000/Chevrolet) = $400,000.
The boat rocking comes when we calculate real GDP in 2013, using 2012 as the base year. 
Now we need to use quantities from 2013 and prices from 2012. In 2013, real GDP is
(10 Fords) × ($30,000/Ford) + (20 Chevrolets) × ($20,000/Chevrolet) = $700,000.
By holding prices constant—using prices from a single base year, 2012—we are able to 
make meaningful comparisons across years. Economists say that such analysis uses con-
stant ­dollars. In this case, the constant dollars are based on prices from 2012. To make 
the base year clear to their audience, economists say that the analysis uses “constant 2012 
dollars.”
Now that you understand how to calculate real GDP, we are able to talk about the growth 
rate of real GDP, which is usually referred to as real GDP growth. For example, the for-
mula for real GDP growth in 2013 is given by
Real GDP growth in 2013 = (Real GDP in 2013) - (Real GDP in 2012)
Real GDP in 2012
.
By focusing on real GDP growth—which holds prices fixed across time—we compare 
the total value of real output in 2012 ($400,000 in our example) and the total value of 
real output in 2013 ($700,000 in our example). In this example, real GDP has grown by 
75 percent:
($700,000 - $400,000)
$400,000
= 3
4 = 0.75 = 75%.
The concept of real GDP growth lets us focus on the thing that we care the most about—
how much the economy is producing at different points in time—without letting price 
movements muddy up the comparison.
Finally, don’t let this teaching example mislead you. Unfortunately, actual growth rates 
for real GDP are much lower than they are in our illustration. Since 1929, when reliable na-
tional income accounts were first created, real GDP growth in the United States has averaged 
3.3 percent per year. Even rapidly growing developing countries achieve average real GDP 
Exhibit 19.7 Quantities (Q) and Prices (P) in an Economy with Two Goods
The yellow box contains Ford’s quantities and prices in years 2012 and 2013. The

of production using prices and quantities from the same year. Real GDP in 2012 using 
2012 prices is the same as nominal GDP in 2012. Real GDP in 2013 using 2012 prices 
is the total value of quantities in 2013 using prices from 2012.

growth of only 5 percent to 10 percent per year. We’ll analyze long-run real GDP growth in 
Chapter 21, and we’ll study short-run fluctuations in real GDP growth in Chapter 26.
The GDP Deflator
We can also use real GDP to study the level of prices in the overall economy. Specifically, 
if we divide nominal GDP by real GDP in the same year and multiply the resulting ratio 
by 100, we end up with a measure of how much prices of goods and services produced in a 
country have risen since the base year. This ratio is called the GDP deflator:
GDP deflator = Nominal GDP
Real GDP
* 100.
To understand why this ratio is a measure of rising prices, it helps to write out the formula. 
Consider again the example in Exhibit 19.7, in which we treat 2012 as the base year for 
calculations of real GDP. To get our feet wet, let’s first evaluate the GDP deflator for 
2012. We’ve written out the expressions for nominal GDP and real GDP below, putting the 
quantities in blue and the prices in red. Using the data in Exhibit 19.7, you can confirm the 
numbers in the formula below:
GDP deflator (2012) = Nominal GDP (2012)
Real GDP (2012)
* 100 
=
Cost of buying everything produced domestically in 2012 using 2012 prices
Cost of buying everything produced domestically in 2012 using base@year prices * 100 
= 10 * 30,000 + 5 * 20,000
10 * 30,000 + 5 * 20,000 * 100 
= 100.
This first calculation reminds us that in the base year (2012 in this example), nominal GDP 
matches real GDP. Consequently, in the base year, the GDP deflator is exactly equal to 100.
Now let’s consider 2013, the year after the base year. Once again, you can use the data 
in Exhibit 19.7 to confirm the numbers in the equation below:
GDP deflator (2013) = Nominal GDP (2013)
Real GDP (2013)
* 100
=
Cost of buying everything produced domestically in 2013 using 2013 prices
Cost of buying everything produced domestically in 2013 using base@year prices * 100 
= 10 * 40,000 + 20 * 25,000
10 * 30,000 + 20 * 20,000 * 100 
= 900,000
700,000 * 100 
= 128.6.
In the formula for the 2013 GDP deflator, the numerator and the denominator have ex-
actly the same quantities (in blue): 10 Fords and 20 Chevys. These are the quantities that 
are sold in 2013. The only things that change between the numerator and the denomina-
tor are the prices (in red). The numerator (top) has the 2013 prices, which are used to 
calculate nominal GDP in 2013. The denominator (bottom) has the 2012 prices that are 
used to calculate real GDP for 2013—recall that the 2012 prices are the base-year prices.
The numerator shows what it would cost to purchase everything that the economy pro-
duced in 2013 using 2013 prices. The denominator shows what it would cost to purchase 
everything that the economy produced in 2013 using 2012 prices. The GDP deflator is the 
ratio that reflects the rising cost of buying everything produced in 2013, holding the goods 
and services produced in 2013 fixed, but changing the prices from the 2013 prices (in the 
numerator) to the 2012 prices (in the denominator).
The GDP deflator is 100 times the 
ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP 
in the same year. It is a measure of 
how prices of goods and services 
produced in a country have risen 
since the base year.

The 2013 GDP deflator is telling us how the 2013 prices (in red in the numerator) 
compare with the 2012 prices (in red in the denominator), holding the quantities fixed in 
the numerator and the denominator. You can think of the (blue) quantities as weights. The 
higher the 2013 quantity, the more weight that good or service gets in determining the over-
all ratio. This makes sense. Goods or services with large quantities should get more weight 
when we form an overall measure of the price level.
Economists study the percentage change in the GDP deflator from year to year. For 
example, the percentage change in the GDP deflator in 2013 is given by
Percentage change in GDP deflator in 2013
= (GDP deflator in 2013) -  (GDP deflator in 2012)
GDP deflator in 2012
.
The percentage change in the GDP deflator is a measure of the percentage change in the 
overall level of prices. In our illustrative example, the GDP deflator was 100 in 2012, and it 
was 128.6 in 2013. So an economist concludes that prices have risen 28.6 percent:
(128.6 - 100)
100
= 28.6
100 = 0.286 = 28.6%.
Note that this overall rate of price inflation is between the rate of price inflation for Fords 
($30,000 to $40,000, or a 33 percent increase) and the rate of price inflation for Chevrolets 
($20,000 to $25,000, or a 25 percent increase). The relative weights of Ford and Chevy 
prices is determined by their quantity weights.
Exhibit 19.8 plots the value of the actual U.S. GDP deflator from 1929 to 2013, using 
2009 as the base year. Because 2009 is the base year, the GDP deflator is exactly 100 in 
Exhibit 19.8 The Value of the GDP Deflator from 1929 to 2013, Using 2009 as 
the Base Year
Because 2009 is the base year, the GDP deflator is exactly 100 in 2009. Notice 
that the GDP deflator is less than 100 before 2009 and greater than 100 after 
2009. The deflator is an indicator of the overall level of prices in the economy. 
In an economy with rising prices, the deflator rises over time. The only period of 
sharp declines in the GDP deflator was the period from 1929 to 1933, which was 
the Great Depression. The series is plotted on a scale with constant proportional-
ity, implying that changes of equal size on the printed page represent equal pro-
portional movements. For example, going from the level of 4 to 20 (a multiple of 5)  
has the same step size on the printed page as going from the level of 20 to 100 
(another multiple of 5).

2009. The GDP deflator is less than 100 before 2009 and greater than 100 after 2009. From 
1929 to 2013 the GDP deflator increased on average 2.9 percent per year, which is a mea-
sure of how quickly prices rose on average during this period.
There are many different ways to measure overall movements in prices, which causes 
some degree of confusion. In fact, the general public is largely unaware of the GDP deflator 
and its usefulness as a tool for measuring price movements. The most well-known price mea-
sure is the Consumer Price Index, which we come to next.
The Consumer Price Index
As you now know, the GDP deflator is the ratio
GDP deflator (2013) = Nominal GDP (2013)
Real GDP (2013)
* 100 
=
Cost of buying everything produced domestically in 2013 using 2013 prices
Cost of buying everything produced domestically in 2013 using base@year prices * 100.
For example, if the base year were 2009, then the prices that are used in the denominator 
are the prices that existed in the economy in 2009.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates a related formula called the Consumer 
Price ­Index (CPI). As you can see, the CPI looks almost identical to the formula for the 
GDP deflator:
CPI (2013) =
Cost of buying a particular basket of consumer goods using 2013 prices
Cost of buying a particular basket of consumer goods using base@year prices * 100.
As you can see, the GDP deflator and CPI formulas are nearly indistinguishable:
	
1.	 Both formulas use 2013 prices in the numerator and base-year prices in the 
denominator.
	
2.	 Both formulas contain a ratio that compares what it would cost to buy “stuff” in 
2013 (in the numerator) to what it would have cost to buy “the same stuff” using 
base-year prices (in the denominator).
	
3.	 Both formulas also have the same interpretation: a higher ratio implies a greater 
price increase from the base year to 2013.
The key difference between the formulas is the basket of goods that is being bought. The 
GDP deflator studies the basket of goods that is produced domestically. In other words, the 
GDP deflator studies the basket of goods that represents the total production of the domes-
tic economy. We’ll call this the GDP basket.
The CPI studies a particular basket of consumer goods. This basket is constructed to 
reflect the types and quantities of goods that are purchased by a typical U.S. household. 
We’ll call this the consumer basket.
There are three key differences between the two baskets:
(1) The GDP basket includes things that households don’t purchase, like coal-fired 
power plants, locomotives, subway stations, city buses, aircraft carriers, and nuclear sub-
marines. Consumers use services provided by governments and firms that purchase these 
items, but no consumer purchases them directly, so they appear in the GDP basket (in the 
year they are purchased) but not in the consumer basket.
(2) The consumer basket includes things that households purchase but are not counted 
in GDP. For example, GDP only counts domestic production, so it does not count imports, 
such as a laptop manufactured abroad. A Chinese laptop that is purchased by a U.S. con-
sumer does not get counted in the U.S. GDP basket but would get counted in the U.S. 
consumer basket.
(3)Even if a product is included in both the GDP basket and the consumer basket, it is 
likely to have a different weight in the two baskets. For example, housing-related expendi-
tures are in both the GDP basket and the consumer basket, but housing has a larger role in 
the consumer basket. Housing—including the cost of shelter, utility bills, and household 
furnishings—represents over 40 percent of the consumer basket, but these items jointly 
represent less than 20 percent of the GDP basket.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is 
100 times the ratio of the cost of 
buying a basket of consumer goods 
using 2013 prices divided by the 
cost of buying the same basket of 
consumer goods using base-year 
prices.

With all of these differences, it’s natural to wonder whether the GDP deflator and CPI 
tell very different stories about the evolution of prices in the overall economy. In fact, in 
practice it almost makes no difference, as we demonstrate next.
Inflation
The rate of increase in prices is the inflation rate. It is calculated as the year-over-year 
percentage increase in a price index. For example, to calculate the overall U.S. inflation 
rate in 2013, we use the following formula, with either the GDP deflator or the CPI as the 
“price index”:
Inflation rate in 2013 = (Price Index in 2013) - (Price Index in 2012)
Price Index in 2012
.
It turns out that the choice of the price index doesn’t have a large impact on the resulting 
rate of inflation. Exhibit 19.9 plots the historical rate of inflation calculated with either the 
GDP deflator (blue) or the CPI (dashed red line). As you can see, the two inflation series 
move very closely together.
This similarity may partially explain why there are relatively few news stories about the 
GDP deflator. The GDP deflator doesn’t have much to add once we know the CPI. More-
over, CPI is released on a monthly basis, so it is more timely than the GDP deflator, which 
is released quarterly. Finally, CPI describes inflation that matters the most for households. 
In this sense, CPI has more personal relevance for the typical consumer.
Adjusting Nominal Variables
You can’t make meaningful comparisons across time without adjusting nominal variables. 
For example, William Howard Taft was paid $75,000 per year for his service as president. 
He was inaugurated in 1909. In 2013, the U.S. president was paid $400,000. So who was 
paid more?
When we ask that question, we don’t mean “Who received more dollars?” We really 
mean “Whose salary was worth more?” or, in the language of economics, “Who had more 
buying power?” There has been a lot of inflation between 1909 and 2013, so a dollar paid 
out in 1909 bought much more than a dollar in 2013. To compare Taft’s salary to a modern 
presidential salary, we need to translate Taft’s salary into current dollars.
There’s a formula that enables us to do this:
Value in 2013 dollars = Price index in 2013
Price index in 1909 * Value in 1909 dollars.
The rate of increase in prices is the 
inflation rate. It is calculated as the 
year-over-year percentage increase 
in a price index.
MyEconLab  Real-time data

The ratio on the right-hand-side of this equation tells us how much prices have risen, en-
abling us to transform value expressed in 1909 dollars into value expressed in 2013 dollars. 
We can fill in these numbers using the 2013 CPI and an historical estimate of what the CPI 
was in 1909 (official government CPI calculations do not start until 1913).
 Value in 2013 dollars = Price index in 2013
Price index in 1909 * Value in 1909 dollars 
 = 233
9
* $75,000
 
 = $1.9 million.
 
The ratio of price indices tells you that, on average, prices rose by a factor of 233/9 = 25.89 
over this time period, so having $1 in 1909 is equivalent to having $25.89 in 2013.  Scaling 
Taft’s annual salary of $75,000 in 1909 by this ratio of price levels implies that his 1909 
salary has equivalent purchasing power to $1.9 million in 2014. Taft’s salary was worth 
more than 4 times Barak Obama’s presidential salary.
We can use this simple formula to express any historical price (or value) in dollars for  
a more recent year (say, 2013). We generally have a good intuition for what 2013 dol-
lars can buy, and we generally have a poor intuition for a dollar’s buying power in 1909. 
Therefore, this type of transformation can come in very handy. We’ll use it many times 
throughout this textbook.
Summary
Macroeconomics is the study of economic aggregates and the economy as a 
whole. An aggregate is a total. Macroeconomics studies total economic activity.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of the final goods and 
services produced within the borders of a country during a particular period of 
time (for instance, a year). GDP is defined in three equivalent ways: Production =  
Expenditure = Income. The circular flow diagram explains these identities 
and adds a fourth identical way of measuring economic activity: factors of 
production.
Like a short weather report—“92 degrees and partly cloudy”—GDP is just 
a summary measure of economic activity and economic well-being. GDP leaves 
many details out, including depreciation, home production, the underground 
economy, externalities, leisure, and cross-border movements of capital and labor. 
Nevertheless, residents of countries with relatively high levels of GDP per capita 
report relatively high levels of life satisfaction.
Economists distinguish nominal values and real values. Real GDP measures 
the market value of economic production holding prices fixed at a particular base 
year. The GDP deflator is a measure of the overall level of prices in the economy. 
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is another measure of the overall level of prices. 
Both the GDP deflator and the CPI can be used to measure the overall rate at 
which prices are rising: the inflation rate.

a.	 What are the uses of CPI?
	
b.	 According to the Social Welfare Department of Hong 
Kong, “the Comprehensive Social Security Assis-
tance Scheme (CSSA) aims to provide certain amount 
of income for those who cannot support themselves fi-

food and housing rise sharply relative to other items, 
do you think the change in CPI-C is an appropriate 
measure for maintaining the purchasing power of 
CSSA?
	
	 It has been suggested that using the CPI-W to adjust ­Social 
Security payments understates inflation for ­seniors. Do 
you agree? Why might this be the case?
	10.	 Recall the method of calculating real GDP detailed in the 
chapter. As you may already have noticed, this method 
has a problem: in calculating aggregate output, this 
method weights the output of the various goods and ser-
vices by their relative prices in the base year.
Say, for example, a textbook cost $100 in the base 
year, and a laptop cost $2,000. This means that the laptop 
would have 20 times the weight of a book in calculating 
aggregate output.
But, what happens when relative prices change? As 
you know, the prices of most high-tech items, including 
laptops, have generally been decreasing over time. Sup-
pose the price of a laptop declined from $2,000 to $1,000 
in the period from the base year to the current year. Now 
a laptop costs only 10 times as much as the book. So, us-
ing base-year relative prices would overweight laptops in 
calculating real GDP in the current year.
In response to this problem, in 1996 the BEA switched 
to what is called a chain-weighted method of calculat-
ing real GDP. Say the base year is 2008. To calculate the 
growth rate of real GDP between 2008 and 2009, for ex-
ample, the BEA calculates real GDP for 2008 using 2008 
as the base, and then real GDP for 2008 using 2009 as 
the base. Then, the Bureau calculates real GDP for 2009 
using 2009 as the base, and real GDP for 2009 using 
2008 as the base. For each base, the growth rate is then 
­calculated as: 2009 GDP(2008 Base) - 2008 GDP(2008 Base)
2008 GDP(2008 Base)
, 
2009 GDP(2009 Base) - 2008 GDP(2009 Base)
2008 GDP(2009 Base)
. 
So, they end up with two different growth rates, which 
are then averaged. Given this averaged growth rate, and 
the level of GDP in 2008 at 2008 prices, the Bureau then 
calculates real GDP for 2009 as 1 plus the average growth 
rate previously calculated, times 2008 output in 2008 
dollars. The growth rate between 2009 and 2010 is then 
calculated similarly.
Suppose that laptops, economics textbooks, and energy 
drinks are the only three goods produced in the United States. 
The following table gives the quantity of each produced (in 
millions) and their price in the years from 2011 to 2013:

	11.	 On May 22, 2013, Forbes magazine reported that Bill 
Gates had overtaken Mexican businessman Carlos Slim as 
the “richest man in the world.” Gates’s fortune on that date 
was estimated at $70 billion, whereas Slim’s was a mere 
$69.86 billion. (http://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/ 
2013/05/22/bill-gates-is-worlds-richest-bumps-slim/)
But, does this make Gates the richest American who 
ever lived?
John D. Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil, is 
usually credited with this distinction. At the time of his 
death in 1937, the founder of the Standard Oil empire had 
an estimated net worth of $1.4 billion.
	
a.	 Go to the BLS CPI site at http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/

ban Consumers,” select “US All Items, 1982 – 84 = 100” 
and click the “Retrieve data” button at the bottom of  
the page. Adjust the years to retrieve data from 1937 
through 2013.
Use the data under the “Annual” column to calcu-
late Gates’s 2013 net worth measured in 1937 dollars. 
You should find that Gates’s wealth does have more 
buying power than Rockefeller’s wealth.
	
b.	 Some analysts say that Rockefeller’s net worth was 
economically equivalent to $250 billion today. How-
ever, this figure is arrived at in a particular way. First, 
his net worth in 1937 is calculated as a percentage 
of total U.S. GDP in 1937. That percentage is then 
multiplied by the current level of GDP to arrive at the 
equivalent figure in current dollars. See if you can ap-
proximate the $250 billion figure. You can find the 
relevant GDP figures at http://research.stlouisfed.org/

We live in a world of great disparities. Standards of living, educational opportunities, 
health services, and infrastructure differ tremendously across countries. Poverty is en-
demic in many parts of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and 
parts of South America, while most people in the United States, Canada, Western 
Europe, and a few other fairly rich countries live in relative comfort, even abundance. 
These differences are so great that if you travel around the globe, you will be struck 
by the contrast of how different living conditions are in some parts of the world from 
those back home. The realization that there are such great disparities may have been 
one of the factors that sparked your interest in economics in the first place. They are 
also the reason why many people from all over the world emigrate to richer coun-
tries, where standards of ­living are higher.

KEY IDEAS
There are very large differences across countries in income or GDP per 
capita.
We can compare income differences across countries using GDP per 
capita at current exchange rates or adjusted for purchasing power parity 
differences.
The aggregate production function links a country’s GDP to its capital 
stock, its total efficiency units of labor, and its technology.
Cross-country differences in GDP per capita partly result from differences  
in physical capital per worker and the human capital of workers, but differences 
in technology and the efficiency of production are even more important.
Macroeconomics provides a useful conceptual framework for studying­ 
these issues and explains why such disparities exist. In this and the next two 
chapters, we study questions related to economic inequalities across coun-
tries and economic growth (sometimes called “long-run macroeconomics”) 
before turning to the study of economic fluctuations (sometimes called “short-
run ­macroeconomics”) in the subsequent five chapters. In particular, in this 
­chapter, we explain how we can measure differences in standards of ­living 
across ­countries and why such disparities exist. In the next chapter, we turn 
to the study of economic growth, that is, how and why an economy grows 
and ­becomes more ­prosperous over time. In our last chapter in this series, 
­Chapter 22, we ­discuss the ­fundamental factors that keep poor ­countries poor.
Before we can understand the variation of income across the world, our first step is to 
define our measurements. How do we quantify the differences in standards of living and 
economic conditions across countries? Income per capita is one robust measure.
Measuring Differences in Income per Capita
We learned in the last chapter how to measure aggregate income or GDP. We can do so 
by approaching it from the production side, from the expenditure side, or from the income 
side. From the national income accounting identity, all three give exactly the same answer: 
gross domestic product, or GDP for short. Dividing GDP by the total population in the 
country gives us income per capita (per person) or GDP per capita.
We use the two terms interchangeably in this textbook because they represent the same 
number. (Often we use income per capita when we wish to emphasize that the number 
is the average income of the citizens of a country and GDP per capita when we wish to 
­emphasize that the number is what the economy produces per person.)
More formally, we have:
Income per capita = GDP per capita =
GDP
Total population .
For example, the United States in 2010 had GDP equal to about $14.45 trillion. With a total 
population of approximately 310 million, income per capita was approximately $46,613.
How does this compare to the income per capita of other countries? Let us look to a 
neighboring country: Mexico. Income in Mexico is, of course, not calculated in U.S. ­dollars

but in pesos. Thus with a similar computation, we find income per capita in Mexico in the 
same year, 2010, to be approximately 116,036 pesos. This number is not directly compa-
rable to the $46,613 for the United States because it is expressed in different units. But we 
can convert it to the same units by using the exchange rate. For example, on January 1, 2010 
one U.S. dollar was worth 12.9 pesos, or one peso was worth 1/12.9 = 0.078 dollars. Using 
this ratio, we can convert the average income in Mexico into dollars as follows (where p.c. 
stands for “per capita”):
  Mexican income p.c. in $ = Mexican income p.c. in pesos * $>peso exchange rate
 
 = 116,036 * 0.078
 
 = $9,051
So the average Mexican had an income per capita of approximately $9,051. This number 
would be useful if you wanted to think about how much an individual with the average 
Mexican income per capita, all of which was earned in Mexico, would be able to consume 
in the United States.
Using this exchange-rate-based measure, we can compute income per capita in every 
country for which we have data on GDP and population. For example, in 2010, income 
per capita in Sweden was $50,549 and in Switzerland it was $69,167. While income per 
capita in Sweden and Switzerland is similar to that in the United States, large disparities 
emerge when we compare the United States to several other countries. For example, we 
have already seen that the U.S. income per capita is about 5 times that of Mexico. It is also 
30 times greater than income per capita in India, 43 times greater than income per capita in 
Senegal, and approximately 155 times greater than income per capita in Ethiopia.
Exchange rates allow us to compare GDP across countries using the same units, but we 
favor a tool that provides even better comparisons of income per capita across countries: 
purchasing power parity (PPP). Exchange rates convert currencies into the same units but fail 
to account for the fact that the prices of many goods and services will differ across countries. 
For example, some things—like phone calls—are cheaper in the United States than in Mexico 
because better technology is available in the United States and because there is a telecommu-
nications monopoly in Mexico, keeping prices relatively high. But other goods—like guaca-
mole and haircuts—are cheaper in Mexico, often because labor and other inputs are cheaper.
We saw in the previous chapter how to adjust economic variables like GDP to correct for 
changes in prices over time (which led to the notion of real GDP). We should make a similar 
adjustment when comparing GDP between countries. But the exchange rate between dollars 
and pesos doesn’t do this. To see why, recall that the exchange rate between the peso and 
the dollar was 12.9 on January 1, 2010. If instead we had used the exchange rate on Janu-
ary 1, 2009, which was 13.8 pesos per dollar, the average income in Mexico would have 
been $8,408 rather than $9,051. But this fluctuation has little to do with changes in prices 
households face in Mexico or the United States. Rather, it is just a consequence of convert-
ing ­Mexican income into dollars using the current exchange rate, which (as we will see in 
Chapter 29) fluctuates for a variety of reasons unrelated to differences in the cost of living.
Purchasing power parity provides a better way to convert GDP in domestic currencies into 
common units. The idea here is very similar to the adjustment we developed for converting 
nominal GDP into real GDP in the previous chapter. Specifically, the purchasing power parity 
(PPP) constructs the cost of a representative bundle of commodities in each country and adjusts 
GDP so that a dollar in each country can purchase this representative bundle. The resulting mea-
sure is a country’s GDP in PPP-adjusted U.S. dollars. For example, this representative bundle 
cost $1 in the United States and 8.64 pesos in Mexico in 2010. On this basis, the PPP factor 
between U.S. dollars and pesos is $1 for 8.64 pesos or 1 peso for 0.116 = 1/8.64 U.S. dollars.
Using this procedure, income per capita in Mexico in PPP would be:
  Mexican income p.c. in PPP $ = Mexican income p.c. in pesos * $>peso PPP
 
 = 116,036 * 0.116
 
 = $13,460
Comparing this result for Mexico with the $9,051 obtained using the peso/$ exchange rate, 
we see that there is often a significant difference between exchange-rate-based measures 
and PPP-based measures of income per capita, with the gap between the United States 
The purchasing power parity 
(PPP) constructs the cost of 
a representative bundle of 
commodities in each country 
and uses these relative costs for 
comparing income across countries.

economy and poorer economies generally being smaller when we use PPP-based measures. 
This pattern reflects the lower cost of living in countries with lower income per capita—
that is, the fact that exchange-rate-based measures of GDP ignore the fact that many com-
modities are cheaper in poorer countries.
Inequality in Income per Capita
There are still very large disparities across countries when we use PPP-based measures. 
Exhibit 20.1 shows a graph of PPP-adjusted income per capita across countries in 2010  
(expressed in terms of 2005 constant dollars, where the notion of constant dollars was 
defined in the previous chapter). Note that there are 19 countries with less than $1,000 per 
capita, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Liberia, Madagascar, and 
Togo, and another 23 with incomes of between $1,000 and $2,000, including Afghanistan, 
Haiti, Kenya, Tajikistan, Uganda, and Zambia. These measures contrast sharply with those 
of the United States ($41,365), France ($31,299), and Germany ($34,089) in the same year.
In 1986, The Economist magazine proposed the Big Mac 
index as an alternative measure of exchange rates. This 
index would simply be the ratio of prices of a Big Mac in 
two countries. There were already McDonald’s restaurants 
in many countries in 1986, so the price of a Big Mac could 
be computed for a large number of countries, giving an 
alternative measure of the exchange rate between any 
two of them. Though proposed tongue-in-cheek, the Big 
Mac index caught on and is now commonly used. In fact, 
there is a good reason for this. The Big Mac index is a 
simple example of a purchasing power parity adjustment. 
Its shortcoming is that instead of a representative bundle 
of diverse goods, this index only compares a bundle con-
sisting of a single good, the Big Mac, which is only a small 
fraction of people’s consumption. Thus, its price will not 
reflect true cost-of-living differences across countries.

had income per capita less than $1,000 in 2010 (in PPP-adjusted 2005 constant 
­dollars) while only a few countries had income per capita above $40,000.

respond to lower income per capita, and greens correspond to relatively high income per 
capita. The overall picture is similar to that shown in Exhibit 20.1, yet we can now more 
easily identify where the rich and the poor countries are. There are some striking patterns 
to the differences in incomes. For example, the African continent appears to be uniformly 
poorer, except for a few spots. Much of South Asia and Latin America is also quite poor. In 
contrast, North America and Western Europe are relatively prosperous. This map makes it 
clear that there are indeed major economic disparities throughout the world, and one of our 
purposes in this chapter is to understand the causes behind them.
Income per Worker
We have so far talked about income per capita—aggregate income (GDP) divided by  
total population. But total population includes children, the elderly, and those who are not 
employed, who do not take part in production (though in many less developed economies, 
child labor is quite common). This raises the possibility that part of the variation in income 
per capita across countries might be due to differences in what fraction of the popula-
tion works. Therefore, a natural alternative that avoids this problem is to focus on income  
(or GDP) per worker, defined as GDP divided by “workers,” meaning those in employ-
ment. That is:
Income per worker =
GDP
Number of people in employment .
Income (or GDP) per worker is 
defined as GDP divided by the 
number of people in employment.
Exhibit 20.2 A Map of Income per Capita Across the World
The large disparities in income per capita across countries are easily visible on this 
map, which also shows that the poorest countries are concentrated in Africa, parts of 
Asia, Central America, and the Caribbean.

This measure gives us a better picture of how much each worker produces on average by 
excluding those who do not work.
Exhibit 20.3 is similar to Exhibit 20.1, but uses (PPP-adjusted) income per worker. If 
there were large differences in the ratio of workers to the total population, this exhibit would 
look very different from Exhibit 20.1. A direct comparison shows that the overall patterns are 
very similar, though naturally income per worker is higher for every country than income per 
capita because the denominator is always smaller for income per worker. For example, PPP-
adjusted income per capita in 2010 (in 2005 constant dollars) for Mexico is $11,939 (we saw 
that this was equal to 13,460 in current dollars), whereas PPP-adjusted income per worker for 
Mexico in 2010 (again in 2005 constant dollars) is $27,625. For India, the two corresponding 
numbers are $3,477 and $9,010. As a reflection of this, the group of countries with the highest 
income per worker now corresponds to $75,000+ instead of $50,000+ as in Exhibit 20.1.
Productivity
The main reason why income per capita or income per worker varies across countries 
is because productivity varies across countries. Productivity here refers to the value of 
goods and services that a worker generates for each hour of work. From our discussion 
of the national income accounting identity in Chapter 19, you will recall that the value of 
goods and services produced in a country, GDP, is equal to the total income in that country.  
Thus productivity also measures income per hour of work. In-
come per worker and productivity are very closely related and 
thus vary across countries for the same reasons. (The only rea-
son why the two concepts differ is that the total number of hours 
of work per worker may also vary across countries, but in prac-
tice, this variation is small.)
It is useful to focus on productivity differences across countries 
because it emphasizes that to understand the huge differences in 
Productivity refers to the value of 
goods and services that a worker 
generates for each hour of work.
To understand the huge differences in 
income per capita across countries, we 
have to look at the production side.
Exhibit 20.3 Income per Worker Across Countries in 2010 (PPP-adjusted 2005 
Constant Dollars)
The distribution of countries by income per worker looks similar to the distribution 
by income per capita shown in Exhibit 20.1. One visible difference is that it is shifted 
to the right compared to Exhibit 20.1, because every country has higher income 
per worker (GDP divided by the number of people in employment) than income per 
capita (GDP divided by total population).

20.3
income per capita across countries, we have to look at the production side. In particular, 
we need to study the factors that make labor much more productive in some countries than 
in others.
Incomes and the Standard of Living
A natural question is whether income per capita or income per worker is the quantity we 
should focus on. The answer depends on what we are trying to measure. Income per worker 
is particularly informative when we would like to understand why some economies are 
more productive than others, because it focuses directly on differences in GDP relative to 
those in employment.
Another reason why we care about disparities in income across countries is that we 
would like to measure differences in the standards of living across countries. For this pur-
pose, income per capita is a natural first step because the conditions of the whole popula-
tion, including children and the elderly, are conveyed by this measure.
However, there is much that is left out of income per capita, as you have already seen in 
the previous chapter. Even though, again as shown in the previous chapter, income per capita 
is a fairly good predictor of average life satisfaction in a country, we cannot capture the di-
verse dimensions of well-being and the standards of living of an entire population by looking 
at a single number. For example, income can vary widely within countries as well as across 
them. In the United States, the coasts are richer than the middle of the country. In Mexico, 
there are great differences between the north and the south. High income 
inequality in general prevents measures of average income (like GDP per 
capita) from giving a complete picture of how comfortably most people 
in a country actually live. Finally, as already mentioned in the previous 
chapter, people do not just care about income and consumption, but also 
about factors such as pollution, the quality of healthcare, and public 
safety. Variations in these factors across countries are not captured by 
income per capita numbers (as you learned at the end of the last chapter).
All of this implies that we should refrain from making sweep-
ing generalizations about the welfare of a country’s citizens based 
on its income per capita alone. Nevertheless, there is quite a bit we 
can learn from income per capita about the standards of living. In 
the previous chapter, we saw the relationship between income per 
capita and average life satisfaction. In addition, one of the things we 
care about when discussing a particular country is whether there are 
many people living in extreme poverty. Researchers at the World Bank have come up 
with the notion of absolute poverty, corresponding to living on less than $1.08 per day 
in 1993—a measure commonly referred to as the one dollar a day per person poverty 
line. This measure has now been updated to $1.25 per person per day (in 2005 U.S. dol-
lars), though it is still sometimes referred to as one dollar a day. For most of us, it is dif-
ficult to imagine how anybody could survive on such a tiny sum, but more than 1.4 billion  
The one dollar a day per 
person poverty line is a measure 
of absolute poverty used by 
economists and other social 
scientists to compare the extent  
of poverty across countries.
A common error in comparing standards of living across 
countries is to focus only on income per capita, without 
thinking about its composition. This error is most clearly 
illustrated by looking at the situation in South Africa. Until 
1994, South Africa was ruled by a minority white popula-
tion under a repressive system of racial segregation known 
as apartheid—a word meaning “separateness.” The apart-
heid regime prevented blacks from political participation 
and regulated their economic activities. It also created a 
variety of repressive arrangements intended to keep the 
wages of black workers low. ­According to the economic 
historian Charles Feinstein, the result was that although 
the South African economy became more prosperous as a 
whole during much of the twentieth century, the incomes of 
its black citizens did not increase during this entire period.1 
So if we were to look at just income per capita in South 
­Africa, it would not inform us about the very low incomes 
and poor living conditions of most of its black citizens.

people in 2005 did in fact try to make do with less than $1.25 per day. Exhibit 20.4 shows 
a scatter plot with the fraction of a nation’s population living in poverty (according to this 
definition) on the y-axis and its income per capita on the x-axis. The exhibit shows a strong 
association, indicating that income per capita gives us a fairly good idea of which countries 
have populations suffering from extreme poverty.
Note that in this and similar exhibits, the horizontal axis is stretched, so that a 10 percent 
change in income per capita represents the same absolute distance on the horizontal scale, 
whether we’re starting from a lower level, like $500, or a higher level, like $8,000. For 
­example, at the point labeled $500, a 10 percent increase takes the same horizontal distance 
as a 10 percent increase at the point labeled $8,000. This is the same strategy we used for 
the vertical axis in Exhibit 19.8 in the previous chapter, and why this is an informative way 
of representing variables such as income or GDP per capita will become clearer when we 
discuss economic growth in the next chapter.
Another reason why we care about income per capita is that poverty often brings poor 
health. One way to measure the health of a nation is by looking at the average life expectancy at 
birth. Exhibit 20.5 shows a scatter plot with life expectancy on the y-axis and income per capita 
on the x-axis, and again there is a strong association, indicating that this non-income-based 
measure of the standard of living also correlates strongly with income per capita.

Between Poverty and Income per 
Capita in 2010 (PPP-adjusted 2005

Absolute poverty, measured here by 
the fraction of the population living 
on less than $1.25 per day, is higher 
among countries with lower income 
per capita. In the exhibit, when you 
focus on countries with income per 
capita above $10,000, this relation-
ship disappears because relatively 
few people in these relatively pros-
perous countries actually live on less 
than $1.25 per day.

Income per capita
As we noted above, to understand differences in income per capita or income per worker 
across countries, we need to understand differences in productivity. To do so, we first out-
line the main sources of variation in productivity across countries. Then, we turn to a more 
systematic analysis of these factors using the aggregate production function.
Productivity Differences
There are three main reasons why productivity differs across countries, each of which we 
now explain in turn.
(1) Human capital: Workers differ in terms of human capital, which is their stock of 
skills to produce output or economic value. For example, a worker with a university degree 
in computer science will be much more productive in computer programming or Web page 
design than a worker with just a high school degree. Suppose, for example, that in one day 
the computer scientist can do the same tasks as two workers with high school degrees. 
In this case, we say that she has twice the human capital as the workers with high school 
­degrees. But this also implies that she is twice as productive.
(2) Physical capital: Physical capital is any good, including machines (equipment) and 
buildings (structures), used for production. For example, in agriculture, aggregate produc-
tion will depend on agricultural machinery, the equipment used for transporting inputs 
and outputs, and the buildings in which the output is stored. Though these inputs are all 
Productivity and the Aggregate 
Production Function
20.2
Human capital is each person’s 
stock of skills to produce output or 
economic value.
Physical capital is any good, 
including machines and buildings, 
used for production.
There are also several other factors we should take into account when measuring the 
standards of living across countries. One alternative is the United Nations’ Human Develop-
ment Index, which combines income per capita, life expectancy, and measures of education 
to more holistically measure the standard of living. Exhibit 20.6 presents a scatter plot with 
the Human Development Index on the y-axis and income per capita on the x-axis. It shows 
that there is once again a strong association between income per capita and this measure.
Overall, the relationship between income per capita and several measures of the stan-
dard of living, including poverty, life expectancy, and the Human Development Index, 
suggests a simple strategy: first focus on income per capita and then look in greater detail 
at issues related to health, education, poverty, and inequality within and across countries. 
This is the strategy we adopt here.

different, we can aggregate them into a single measure and obtain the physical capital 
stock of the economy using their dollar value. Workers will be more productive when the 
economy has a bigger physical capital stock, enabling each worker to work with more (or 
better) equipment and structures.
(3) Technology: An economy with better technology uses its labor and capital more effi-
ciently and thus achieves higher productivity. We will see below that an economy can have 
better technology either because it uses superior knowledge in production (for example, 
new manufacturing techniques not available to other economies) or because it organizes 
production more efficiently.
The Aggregate Production Function
Human capital, physical capital, and technology each play a part in determining how 
productive workers in an economy are. The aggregate production function is our tool 
for understanding how these three ingredients all come together to generate GDP in an 
economy.
In the previous chapter, we saw how we can aggregate tens of 
thousands of commodities into a single measure of GDP. For our 
analysis here, we can go one step further. Once we have made 
the simplification of aggregating everything into GDP, we can 
just think of GDP as if it were a single commodity. Even though 
this simplification ignores the composition of GDP, it allows us to 
more clearly look at what determines the level of GDP, which is 
our main purpose in this chapter.
The advantage of looking at GDP in this way is that once we 
start thinking of the world in terms of a single commodity, we 
can study the aggregate production function of the economy, which describes the relation-
ship between GDP and its various inputs. This is similar to how we study the relationship 
between the output of a single firm and the inputs that it uses. For example, if we wanted 
to understand how much corn a farm produces, we would first specify the relationship be-
tween total corn production and its key inputs, for example, the number of workers on the 
farm and the equipment that the farm uses.
A key concept in our study of the aggregate production function is factors of production. 
You will recall from the previous chapter that factors of production are the inputs to the 
production process—goods or services purchased in the market for producing other goods, 
in this case for producing GDP. To understand a nation’s output, we will look at a produc-
tion function that describes how the factors of production are combined to produce GDP. 
But differently from the case in which we study a single firm, our focus is not specific com-
modities, such as T-shirts or iPhones, but all of GDP, and we therefore refer to this function 
as the aggregate production function.
The aggregate production function is useful for understanding not only how GDP is 
determined but also why productivity varies across countries.
Labor
The first and most important factor of production is labor. A nation can increase output by 
employing more workers. For example, more workers can be deployed for tilling the soil 
and harvesting corn.
Remember, though, that not all workers are the same. Some will have greater human 
capital than others and will be able to produce more output or economic value (and this is 
the reason why, as we have seen, human capital is a major determinant of productivity). 
Such differences in workers’ human capital make looking at the total number of work-
ers in an economy a poor indicator of how much the economy can produce. Instead, we 
need to know the total efficiency units of labor. Total efficiency units of labor is defined 
as the product of the total number of workers and the average human capital (efficiency) 
of ­(employed individuals) workers. For example, suppose a computer science graduate 
can perform the same job as two high school graduates. Then, it would be natural to give 
twice the weight to her labor than that of high school graduates. Now applying the same 
idea more broadly, we can compute the total efficiency units of labor, denoted by H, as the 
The physical capital stock of an 
economy is the value of equipment, 
structures and other non-labor 
inputs used in production.
An economy with better technology 
uses its labor and capital more 
efficiently and achieves higher 
productivity.
Human capital, physical capital, and 
technology each play a part in deter-
mining how productive workers in 
an economy are.
An aggregate production function 
describes the relationship between 
the aggregate GDP of a nation and 
its factors of production.
Total efficiency units of labor is 
the product of the total number 
of workers in the economy and 
the average human capital of each 
worker.

502	
Chapter 20  |  Aggregate Incomes
20.1
20.3
product of the total number of workers in the economy, L, and the average efficiency or 
human capital of workers, h. Thus, we write:
H = L × h .
This equation implies that the total efficiency units of labor in the economy can be in-
creased either if more workers take part in the production process (for example, because 
employment increases) or if each worker becomes more productive. Acquiring more skills 
through formal schooling is one way for a worker to increase productivity.
Physical Capital and Land
The second major factor of production is physical capital, typically denoted by K (correspond-
ing to the first letter of “Kapital,” the German spelling of capital). When an economy has more 
physical capital, or equivalently, a greater physical capital stock, its workers can work with 
more and better equipment and structures, and thus the economy will produce more GDP.
A third factor of production is land. For example, if we think of an economy in the eigh-
teenth century, land and other natural resources would be the key factors of production. Yet 
other factors of production include natural resources and the entrepreneurial talent of the 
economy (the skills and capabilities of its entrepreneurs and businesspeople). To simplify 
the discussion, we focus only on physical capital and labor (specifically, total efficiency 
units of labor). When we do so, the value of land and natural resources can be included in 
the physical capital stock (the same way that the value of buildings is). We will return to the 
role of entrepreneurial talent in the context of our discussion of technology below.
Representing the Aggregate Production Function
Let us represent the aggregate production function as follows:
Y = A × F(K,H) .
When we read an expression like the one above aloud, we say, “Y is a function of K and H.”  
We read our notation as follows:
	
1.	 Y stands for GDP.
	
2.	 K is the physical capital stock of the nation.
	
3.	 H is the efficiency units of labor that the economy uses in production.
	
4.	 The function F signifies that there is a relationship between physical capital, labor, 
and GDP. In particular, GDP is generated through a combination of physical capital 
and the efficiency units of labor.
	
5.	 A is an index of technology. A higher A implies that the economy produces more 
GDP with the same level of physical capital stock and total efficiency units of labor. 
We discuss the role of technology in greater detail below.
As we have already emphasized, this aggregate production function is similar to the pro-
duction function of an individual firm for producing a specific type of commodity. In 
particular:
(1) Just like the production function of a specific firm, the aggregate production function 
will show that GDP is increasing in both physical capital and labor—put differently, more 
is better. Holding labor constant, if we have a greater physical capital stock, we will be able 
to produce more GDP. Holding physical capital constant, if we have more labor, we will 
also be able to produce more GDP.
(2) The aggregate production function is also subject to the Law of Diminishing 
­Marginal Product (which is related to our discussion of diminishing marginal benefit in 
Chapter 4). The Law of Diminishing Marginal Product states that the marginal contri-
bution of a factor of production to GDP diminishes when we increase the quantity used 
of that factor of production (holding all other factors of production constant). We can il-
lustrate the aggregate production function graphically by holding the total efficiency units 
of labor constant, as in Exhibit 20.7, or by holding the physical capital stock constant, as 
in Exhibit 20.8. Let’s start with Exhibit 20.7.
The Law of Diminishing Marginal 
Product states that the marginal 
contribution of a factor of 
production to GDP diminishes when 
we increase the quantity used of 
that factor of production (holding all 
others constant).

Exhibit 20.8 The Aggregate Production Function with 
the Efficiency Units of Labor on the Horizontal Axis 
(with Physical Capital Stock Held Constant)
Holding the physical capital stock constant, the 
­aggregate production function shows the ­relationship 
between the total efficiency units of labor and GDP. 
Once again, as the total efficiency units of labor 
­increase, so does GDP, but consistent with the Law of 
Diminishing Marginal Product, the relationship becomes 
less and less steep as the total efficiency units of labor 
increase.

This exhibit shows both the increasing relationship between physical capital and out-
put, and the Law of Diminishing Marginal Product. In particular, the marginal contribu-
tion of an additional unit of physical capital to output—how much output increases as a 
result of a unit increase in the physical capital stock—is decreasing in the total physical 
capital stock. We see this by comparing the increase in output for a unit increase in 
physical capital stock at two different points of the aggregate production function in 
Exhibit 20.7. Consider a unit increase close to the origin (point A). When there is less 
physical capital in the economy, the corresponding increase in output is large. When 
we have the same unit increase farther to the right, corresponding to more physical 
capital (point B), the resulting increase in output is smaller, as shown by the smaller 
vertical increase at B than at A. This visual difference captures the Law of Diminishing 
­Marginal Product.
Exhibit 20.7 holds the efficiency units of labor, H, constant and looks at the relationship 
between the physical capital stock and GDP. Exhibit 20.8 does the opposite, holding the 
physical capital stock, K, constant and looking at the relationship between the efficiency 
units of labor of the economy and GDP. This relationship also satisfies the Law of Dimin-
ishing Marginal Product.

Holding the total efficiency units of labor constant, the 
aggregate production function shows the relationship 
between the physical capital stock and GDP in the econ-
omy. As the physical capital stock increases, so does 
GDP. But the relationship becomes less and less steep 
as the physical capital stock of the economy increases 
because of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Product. 
For the same one-unit increase in the physical capital 
stock, the increase in GDP is greater at point A (with 
lower physical capital stock) than at point B (with greater 
physical capital stock).

We now discuss how technology affects the aggregate production function and the factors 
that influence the level of technology of an economy.
Technology
A third determinant of GDP is technology. The aggregate production function specifies that 
technology is a way of summarizing the relationship between the factors of production and 
GDP. A better technology means that the economy can generate more output from the same set 
of inputs. Exhibit 20.9 shows the implications of better technology for the aggregate produc-
tion function: again holding the efficiency units of labor, H, constant, the relationship between 
GDP and the physical capital stock shifts left. Therefore, for every level of the ­efficiency units 
of labor, a better technology implies that the economy will produce more GDP.
Our study of the aggregate production function thus clarifies why productivity depends 
on human capital, physical capital, and technology. Holding the total number of workers 
constant, greater human capital, a larger stock of physical capital, and better technology 
will all increase GDP. Because the total number of workers (and hours of work per worker) 
is constant, this also corresponds to an increase in productivity.
Dimensions of Technology
Technology, as we have defined it, is rather broad, and in fact has two very distinct com-
ponents. The first is knowledge. Today, we know how to produce many new goods, such as 
smart phones and tablets, which were not available previously. In addition, this knowledge 
also enables us to perform certain tasks more efficiently. For example, when you use a com-
puter for writing an essay or doing computations for a class, you are making use of the com-
puting power, which comes from the knowledge that society has acquired and has applied to 
its production process. Part of this knowledge is in the human capital of the workers: workers 
today can perform a range of tasks more productively than their grandparents could. But an 
important part of this knowledge is embodied in the physical capital stock of firms: the com-
puters that firms are using are part of the physical capital stock of the economy.
Nevertheless, there is also a sense in which technology is different from the physical 
capital stock of the economy. Your great-grandparents, however much they may have wished 
to pay for a computer, would not have been able to do so, because computers were not yet 
commercially sold. Your grandparents would have had to pay an enormous price for a com-
puter with fewer capabilities than the one you are using now, and it would have likely been a

Exhibit 20.9 The Shift in the Production Function  
Resulting from More Advanced Technology
As technology improves, the aggregate production func-
tion shifts upwards, indicating that with the same amount 
of physical capital stock and total efficiency units of labor, 
more output can be produced. In this exhibit, the total 
­efficiency units of labor are held constant, and for a given 
level of physical capital stock, the economy with more 
­advanced technology has a higher level of GDP.

A long-term trend of rather remarkable regularity in the 
development of computer microprocessors has been 
­observed since 1965. It’s dubbed Moore’s Law after ­Intel 
cofounder Gordon Moore, who predicted in that year 
that the number of transistors on a chip would double 
approximately every 2 years.2 The number of transistors 
is a key determinant of how fast a computer processor is. 
So roughly speaking, Moore’s Law implies that ­computer 
processor power should double approximately every 
2  years. So far, this seems to have been borne out by 
developments in computer technology, as illustrated in 
Exhibit 20.10. Several other measures of technological 
advances in computing have also behaved according to 
Moore’s Law. For example, the number of pixels in digital 
cameras and RAM storage capacity have also doubled 
every 2 years or so, while power consumption of com-
puter nodes and hard disc storage costs appear to have 
been halved approximately every 2 years.
Naturally, there is nothing predetermined about the 
relationship between time and progress in technology 
that would make this into an actual “law.” This progress 
results from the investments of several companies in new 
computer technologies, which are in turn driven by the 
profitability of these investments. It also relies on gov-
ernment support for university and private research and 
on the ability of the United States and other advanced 
and developing nations to attract increasing numbers 
of young, talented students into science, engineering, 
and related fields. Things can change in the future, halt-
ing this rapid progress in technology. Fewer college stu-
dents could choose to major in science and engineering 
in the future, or governments could decide to limit or 
even stop their support for private or university research, 
weakening incentives for further technological advances. 
Moreover, even without a major cutback in funding or a 
change in the profitability of research in this area, the rate 
of ­advance may slow down from its current breakneck 
pace. Nevertheless, the relationship so far has been very 
accurate and, assuming it continues in the years to come, 
the implications for lives are enormous.

Gordon Moore predicted in 1965 that the speed of computer processors would

of ­transistors packed in a computer chip doubling approximately every 2 years. This 
­remarkable trend, which has come to be known as Moore’s Law, now symbolizes the 
­sustained technological improvements of our era.

giant machine rather than the small notebooks that many of you are using. Thus ­advances in  
technology—in this specific instance, in computer technology—directly increase the num-
ber of tasks we can perform and the speed at which we can accomplish them.
Advances in technology sometimes happen by chance, but more often, they result from the 
purposeful, optimizing decisions of economic agents. For example, society achieves such ad-
vances with research and development (R&D), which involves a wide range of activities like 
research on new scientific ideas in universities and private labs, research directed at finding

new ways of applying science to production on the factory floor, and de-
velopment activities geared at commercializing ­existing knowledge and 
products. R&D is a major activity in the United States economy. Almost 
1.41 million people worked as researchers in 2007 (the most recent year 
for which this information is available), and $430 ­billion—2.77 percent 
of total GDP—was spent on research and development. Of this amount, 
about $270 billion was spent by businesses, while the remaining portion 
was spent by the U.S. government, universities, and other institutions. 
Economists often use the term technology more broadly than to de-
scribe advances in our knowledge about production processes. To see this, 
imagine two economies. In one, the allocation of resources is determined 
by the market, and in the other, resources are allocated randomly across 
individuals and firms. As a specific example, say that both of these 
economies have two types of workers, economics professors and  
basketball players, and two types of tasks, teaching and basketball.
The first economy relies on the market for allocating workers to 
tasks. Basketball players who are better at basketball than teaching 
will play basketball, and economics professors will do the teach-
ing. In the second, allocation takes place randomly. Suppose that 
economics professors are assigned to do the basketball playing and 
the basketball players do the teaching. There are no differences in 
the knowledge available for production between the two econo-
mies, and both have the same human capital. But the first economy 
will be much more successful (especially in basketball), and will produce more output (more 
and better basketball and perhaps even better teaching).
What is the difference between the two economies? This difference has to do with the 
efficiency of production—the ability of society to produce the maximal amount of output 
at a given cost or for given levels of the factors of production and knowledge. When the 
economy is able to increase the efficiency of production, there will be a shift in the ag-
gregate production function similar to that shown in Exhibit 20.9. We therefore include 
efficiency of production as part of our definition of technology because it captures the 
differences in how much output an economy can generate with given amounts of inputs.
The importance of technology for GDP is the reason why we include A and represented 
the aggregate production function as:
A × F(K,H).
Efficiency of production refers 
to the ability of an economy to 
produce the maximal amount  
of output from a given amount  
of factors of production and 
knowledge.
Economist James Schmitz Jr. studied the experience of 
the iron ore industries in the United States and Canada 
in the face of competition from Brazilian producers.3 His 
findings provide a particularly clear illustration of how 
changes in the organization of firms can lead to improve-
ments in the efficiency of production—or “technology"—
and thus increase productivity significantly.
Schmitz documents that productivity—for example, 
measured as output of iron ore per hour—was constant 
since at least 1970 in the Canadian and the U.S. iron 
ore industries when they faced little foreign competi-
tion. In the early 1980s, however, Brazilian producers 
entered the U.S. market and started to deliver iron ore 
to ­Chicago and other central markets. Schmitz shows 
that in the course of the next decade, productivity in the 
U.S. and Canadian iron ore industries, which had been 
flat for a long time, doubled. He shows that this was not 
due to more intensive use of capital or materials, nor 
was it driven by the use of new production techniques.  
Rather, it resulted from a significant reorganization of 
production.
Iron ore production plants were heavily unionized—a 
fact that, according to Schmitz, prevented the plants from 
efficiently allocating labor across different tasks. For ex-
ample, despite industry studies suggesting that there was 
an excess number of repair workers for a large variety of 
equipment, union contracts did not permit reduction in 
repair staff. Following the increase in competition, these 
work rules were changed, enabling a more productive 
use of labor. Schmitz provides a variety of additional evi-
dence showing that these and other changes in work rules  
allowed a more flexible allocation of labor across tasks 
and therefore better utilization of equipment, resulting in 
the dramatic increase in productivity.

Greater A corresponds to better technology and increases GDP for given levels of effi-
ciency units of labor and physical capital stock, which shifts the aggregate production func-
tion left, as shown in Exhibit 20.9. But note that A is not a factor of production. Although it 
designates the technology available to the economy, it does not correspond to an input that 
the producer can purchase in the marketplace.
Entrepreneurship
A particularly important reason why efficiency of production and productivity might differ 
across economies relates to entrepreneurship. As we discuss in greater detail in Chapter 22,  
various factors might influence whether the individuals with a comparative advantage for 
entrepreneurship become entrepreneurs. When they fail to do so, the efficiency of produc-
tion of an economy is lower—in the same way as the mismatch between basketball players 
and economics teachers, though perhaps more importantly.
When Mexico entered the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, NAFTA, with the United States in 1994, many 
economists predicted that Mexico’s economy would grow 
rapidly. But in the first 15 years after signing NAFTA, Mex-
ico’s growth was much less than most analysts expected. 
Monopolies and barriers against the entry of new compa-
nies are just some of the reasons why the country has not 
achieved more significant growth.
Consider the telecommunications sector in Mexico, 
which was for a long time operated as a state monopoly. 
It subsequently was privatized, but turned into a private 
monopoly under the ownership of Carlos Slim, who has 
now become one of the richest people in the world. In 
contrast, the telecommunications sector in the United 
States is very competitive, with many firms competing in 
both wireless and broadband. The Mexican telecommu-
nications sector not only charges higher prices than other 
countries but also invests less than other comparable 
countries, as shown in Exhibit 20.11.
Removing monopolies and entry barriers that prevent 
the efficient allocation of resources is one important way 
of increasing GDP.

Evidence-Based Economics
T
o understand the variation in productivity and income per worker between the United 
States and India (and other countries), it is useful to focus on three factors: human 
capital, physical capital, and technology. To see the relative importance of any one 
of these factors in explaining differences in income (GDP) per worker across countries, we 
can compare a country’s actual income per worker with what would be if the country had 
access to the same human capital, physical capital stock, or technology of another country. 
This is exactly what we do in Exhibit 20.12, specifically with technology.
Using data on education attainment (a key aspect of human capital) and employment, 
we calculate the efficiency units of labor. Column 3 records the average years of schooling 
per worker of each country. It shows that most countries have significantly lower levels of 
average schooling than the United States.
Then, using data on investment over several decades, we calculate the physical capital 
stock for each country. Column 4 shows the ratio of the physical capital stock per worker 
of each country relative to the physical capital stock per worker in the United States. Most 
countries have a significantly lower physical capital stock per worker than the United 
States (but there are also countries like Norway, not shown in the exhibit, that have higher 
levels than the United States).
Using estimates of the shape of the aggregate production function (we provide details 
of this estimation in the appendix to this chapter), we can then see how the efficiency 
units of labor and physical capital stock are translated into income per worker. Comparing 
these contributions of human capital and physical capital with actual income per worker 
(recorded in column 2 of Exhibit 20.12), we can then infer how much of a contribution 
technology makes to income per worker. Specifically, any GDP that cannot be accounted 
for by physical capital and labor, we assume to be accounted for by technology.
Given the estimates of the aggregate production function, we can now compute what the 
income level of all of these countries would have been if they had had access to exactly the 
same technology as the United States (using their actual efficiency units of labor and physi-
cal capital stock). This information is recorded in column 5 of the exhibit. The difference

between actual incomes and these hypothetical numbers illustrates the contribution of 
technology.
The exhibit reveals some powerful facts. Consistent with the patterns we have already 
seen in Exhibits 20.1–20.3, income per worker in the United States is about 9 times that in 
India (82,359/9,010 ≃ 9). We also see that Indians have average years of schooling of 5.1 
compared to 13.1 in the United States and that the physical capital stock per worker in India 
is about 9 percent of that of the United States.
So how much would a typical Indian worker produce with this amount of human capital 
and physical capital if he, hypothetically, had access to the U.S. level of technology?
Column 5 shows that the answer is $24,071. This implies that the hypothetical income per 
Indian worker if India’s technology were at the U.S. level is nearly 3 times as much as its cur-
rent income per worker: 24,071/9,010 ≃ 2.7, suggesting a sizable impact of technology dif-
ferences. If, in addition, India also increased its human capital and physical capital per worker 
to U.S. levels, it would increase its income per worker to the U.S. level. (This is by construc-
tion: if India has the same level of human capital and physical capital per worker, and the same 
technology as the U.S., it would have the same income per worker as the U.S.). In the Indian 
case this would correspond to an increase by another 3 ½ times (82,359/24,071 ≃ 3.5).
Recall, however, that the technology differences that appear so important (roughly as 
important as total efficiency units of labor and physical capital combined) are not just dif-
ferences in the knowledge available to the economy and to firms for production. They also 
reflect differences in the efficiency of production, as our example of economics professors 
and basketball players illustrated, and if there is any mismeasurement in factors of produc-
tion, this will appear as technology differences. For example, in practice, human capital 
across countries differs not only because of average years of schooling but also because of 
major differences in the quality of schooling. If rich countries have a systematically higher 
quality of schooling, our methodology can lead to exaggerated technology differences.

Chapter 20  |  Aggregate Incomes
Summary
Income per capita, defined as aggregate income or gross domestic product 
(GDP) divided by total population, varies greatly across countries, with some 
nations such as the United States and Norway having more than 40 times the 
income per capita of some other nations such as Afghanistan, Niger, and the 
Democratic ­Republic of Congo.
Income (or GDP) per capita across countries can be compared using 
exchange-rate-based measures, which rely on current exchange rates, or 
purchasing power parity-based measures, which compare estimates of the cost of 
the representative bundle of commodities in each country. The latter tends to be 
more reliable as it more appropriately captures differences in relative prices across 
countries, and is not subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in exchange 
rates. Though income per capita omits a wealth of other important information 
about a country (health, schooling, inequality, and poverty), it provides a good 
summary of prosperity and is typically correlated with higher life expectancy, 
greater schooling, and lower poverty.
The aggregate production function links the GDP of a nation to its total 
efficiency units of labor, physical capital stock, technology, and efficiency of 
production. Greater efficiency units of labor and physical capital, as well as better 
technology and efficiency of production, increase GDP.
Though the total efficiency units of labor and physical capital stock matter a 
great deal for GDP, the most important determinant of cross-country differences 
in income (or GDP) per worker appears to be differences in technology and the 
efficiency of production.

Chapter 20  |  Aggregate Incomes
Using the Big Mac burger as a representative com-
modity common to the countries, calculate the purchasing 
power parity (PPP)-adjustment factor for each country, 
and then the PPP level of per capita GDP in each country.
	 3.	 Let us use what we have learned in the first part of the 
chapter to compare living standards in the United States 
and a hypothetical country, Argonia, in 2008.
	
a.	 The U.S. GDP in 2008 was approximately 14 trillion 
dollars and the U.S. population was approximately 
300 million. What was the per capita GDP in the 
United States in 2008?
	
b.	 Suppose that in the local currency, Argonian dollars, 
Argonia’s GDP in 2008 was 1 trillion, and its popu-
lation was 10 million. What was Argonia’s GDP per 
capita in Argonian dollars? What problems do you 
foresee in comparing this number to the U.S. GDP 
per capita in U.S. dollars computed in part a?
	
c.	 The Argonian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate was 
equal to 6 on January 1, 2008 (meaning that 1 U.S. 
dollar is worth 6 Argonian dollars) and reached 9 on 
August 1, 2008. Compute an exchange-rate-based 
measure of the GDP per capita in Argonia in U.S. dol-
lars on these two dates. Do you think the change in 
Argonia’s exchange-rate-based measure of GDP per 
capita between these two dates reflects a true change in 
living standards?
	
d.	 McDonald’s has a thriving business in Argonia and 
sold a Big Mac for 7 Argonian dollars in 2008, while at 
the same time, a Big Mac sold for $3.50 in the United 
States. Using this information, provide an alternative 
estimate of GDP per capita in Argonia. Would you 
trust this estimate better than the one based on ex-
change rates? Why or why not?
	 4.	 Suppose you are given the following information for the 
country Lusitania:
 
2011
Population; total in Lusitania
190 million
Employment
80 million
Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
2,476 billion  
U.S. dollars
	
a.	 What is the income per capita in Lusitania?
	
b.	 What is the income per worker in Lusitania?

the country Arctica.
 
2011
Population; total in Arctica
80 million
Employment
40 million
Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
3,600 billion

c.	 What is the income per capita in Arctica?
	
d.	 What is the income per worker in Arctica?
	
e.	 Based on the given information, would Arctica be 
considered more productive than Lusitania? Explain 
your answer.
	
f.	 How would you use the information given in both 
these tables to compare living standards in Lusitania 
and Arctica?
	 5.	 Suppose that the GDP in current dollars for Polonia is higher 
than Ruritania’s GDP. However, using purchasing power 
parity-adjusted dollars, Ruritania’s GDP is higher than 
­Polonia’s GDP. Based on this information, what would you 
conclude about living standards in Polonia and Ruritania?
	 6.	 In 2011, China revised its poverty line upward to  
2,300 yuan per year, or 6.3 yuan per day. At the prevail-
ing ­exchange rate, this was equal to a little less than a 
single U.S. dollar. Some commentators felt that China’s 
poverty line fell short of the World Bank’s poverty line 
of $1.25 per day, in 2005 purchasing power parity (PPP) 
U.S. dollars. Would you agree? What other information 
would you need to evaluate this claim?
	 7.	 In this question, we will use what you learned in the sec-
ond part of the chapter to compare the performance of 
an economy in two different time periods, as its physical 
capital stock and efficiency units of labor change.
	
a.	 Suppose that from period 1 to period 2, the unemploy-
ment rate in the economy increases. Everything else re-
mains unchanged. What happens to the total efficiency 
units of labor? Express your results formally as an in-
equality, using the formula for total efficiency units of 
labor presented in the chapter (in particular, recall that 
total efficiency units of labor in two periods can be writ-
ten as H1 = L1 × h1 and H2 = L2 × h2; where L is the 
total number of employed workers).
	
b.	 What are the consequences of this increase in unem-
ployment for GDP? Express your results formally as 
an inequality, using the aggregate production function 
presented in the chapter.
	
c.	 What are the consequences for GDP per capita and 
GDP per worker?
	
d.	 Suppose that there is a technological advance from 
­period 1 to period 2 but, at the same time, a decrease 
in physical capital stock. Can you say whether GDP 
will increase or decrease? Why or why not?

Appendix  |  The Mathematics of Aggregate Production Functions
Appendix
The Mathematics of Aggregate 
Production Functions
How did we compute, in Exhibit 20.12, what the average income per worker in India would 
have been if India had access to the U.S. level of technology?
We worked with the aggregate production function Y = A × F(K,H) using the following 
form, which is often estimated as an empirical approximation to data:
 Y = A × F(K,H) = A × K1/3 × H2/3.
It is referred to as a Cobb-Douglas function and has several attractive features.4 For one, 
the coefficients to which K and H are raised to add up to 1 (1⁄3 + 2⁄3 = 1). This ensures that 
the production function exhibits constant returns to scale: that is, increasing K and H by  
1 percent would lead to a 1 percent increase in Y. Moreover, this functional form is con-
sistent with the empirical fact that, roughly speaking, about two-thirds of national income 
goes to labor and one-third to physical capital.
Let us now divide both sides of the above equation by the total number of workers in 
the economy, L, to obtain:
Y * 1
L = A * K1/3 * H2/3 * 1
L .
This can be rewritten as:
y = Y
L = A * K1/3 * H2/3 *
1
L1/3 * L2/3 ,
where y is income per worker, or GDP divided by the number of workers in the economy. 
The last term simply rewrites 1/L differently to derive the next equation.
Now rearranging the previous equation, we obtain
y = A * a K
L b
1/3
* a H
L b
2/3
.
Finally, recalling that H = L × h, this can be rewritten as
y = A * a K
L b
1/3
* h2/3.
Stated differently:
GDP per worker = Technology * (Capital per worker)1/3 * (Human capital per worker)2/3.
This derivation also shows why there is a very tight relationship between cross-country dif-
ferences in GDP per worker and cross-country differences in productivity. For simplicity, 
assuming that each worker works the same number of hours in every country, the left-hand 
side of this equation is also GDP per hour worked and thus the productivity of a country. 
The equation therefore demonstrates that productivity is determined by the three ingredi-
ents we have emphasized in the text: technology, physical capital, and human capital.
We next use data on GDP per worker together with data on the physical capital stock (K),  
or physical capital per worker, and data on human capital per worker (h). Data on GDP are 
available from various sources (with original information coming from national income 
accounts). These sources also provide information on investment, which we can use to 
compute physical capital stocks. Finally, we can compute human capital differences across 
nations from differences in average years of schooling. In particular, we know how much 
more a worker with one more year of schooling earns. We can use this information to cre-
ate an index, h—on the basis of differences in average years of schooling—that captures 
differences in human capital across nations. For example, say college graduate workers 

	
Appendix  |  The Mathematics of Aggregate Production Functions
515
will typically have 16 years of schooling and earn twice as much as workers with 6 years 
of schooling. Then if we set h = 1 for a country with 6 years of schooling on average, we 
would have h = 2 for a country with 16 years of schooling on average.
Now let us start by computing the technology for the United States, denoted by AUS 
­Using the previous equation, we arrive at:
AUS =
yUS
a KUS
LUS
b
1/3
* hUS
2/3
 .
As we have seen, the U.S. GDP per worker is given by
yUS = AUS * a KUS
LUS
b
1/3
* hUS
2/3 .
The expression above is obtained simply by rearranging this.
In the same fashion, we can find the contribution of technology to the GDP of India, 
which is AINDIA:
AINDIA =
yINDIA
a KINDIA
LINDIA
b
1/3
* hINDIA
2/3
 .
We can then ask how the GDP of India would be different if instead of AINDIA we used AUS 
in the preceding expression. We can calculate the hypothetical GDP per worker of India in 
the situation in which India has the same technology term, AUS, as the United States:
yINDIA WITH US TECHNOLOGY = AUS * a KINDIA
LINDIA
b
1/3
* hINDIA
2/3
.
Using our estimates of AUS, KINDIA, LINDIA, hINDIA, for example, we can compute the 
­hypothetical GDP per worker of India, if India were able to use American technology, as 
$24,071. In the same way, we can plug in the U.S. technology terms into the aggregate 
production function of any country, which enables us to do the rest of the computations in 
Exhibit 20.12.

Economic 
Growth
 21
The United States was not always as prosperous as it is today. Its 
(real) GDP per capita today is about 25 times what it was in 1820. 
At that time, only a small fraction of the population lived in cities; 
most people worked in agriculture. People could not even imagine, let alone 
have access to, many of the goods, services, and technologies that we take 
for granted, including radio, television, indoor plumbing, shopping malls, cars, 
planes, or even trains.
The United States and several other countries have vastly increased their 
GDP (income) per capita over the last 200 years, developing new goods, 
services, and technologies. We call this process economic growth. The key 
questions we address in this chapter are how and why the United States and 
several other countries have managed to achieve such notable economic 
growth over the past two centuries.

KEY IDEAS
Economic growth measures how much (real) GDP per capita grows  
over time.
Today’s high levels of GDP per capita in many nations are a result 
of rapid economic growth over the last two centuries.
Sustained economic growth relies on technological progress.
There are sizable differences in the historical growth rates of different 
economies, which are largely responsible for their differences in the levels of 
GDP per capita.
Economic growth is a powerful tool for poverty reduction.
We saw in Chapter 20 how aggregate incomes (GDP) are determined. We can now start 
using these ideas to understand why several countries, including the United States, have 
managed to become so much richer over the past 200 years and in the process, gain a new 
perspective on the differences across countries that we documented in the previous chapter. 
Throughout this chapter, by GDP we refer to real GDP which uses market prices from a 
specific base year (in this chapter generally 2005) to express the value of production in the 
economy, as we discussed in Chapter 19.

Exhibit 21.1 GDP per Capita in the United States (2005 Constant Dollars)
The growth of GDP per capita in the United States has been relatively steady and 
­sustained, except during the Great Depression and its aftermath. Note that the verti-

the same as that between 2,500 and 12,500.

Chapter 21  |  Economic Growth
21.1
A First Look at U.S. Growth
As a first step, Exhibit 21.1 depicts GDP per capita in the United States over the past  
200 years. In Chapter 20, we adjusted incomes in terms of the cost of a given basket of 
commodities in order to compare them meaningfully across countries. Similarly, we saw 
in Chapter 19 how to make a similar adjustment for inflation to obtain real GDP (or real 
income), which can be meaningfully compared over time. Recall that this involves adjust-
ing GDP or incomes according to a base-year dollar value, which we call constant dollars. 
This is what we do in this chapter also. Exhibit 21.1, for example, plots the level of GDP 
per capita in the United States in 2005 constant dollars, so the income for the year 1967, for 
example, is expressed as what it would be equal to in year 2005 dollars.
Exhibit 21.1 clearly illustrates the economic growth in the U.S. economy between 1820 
and 2012. Economic growth, or simply growth, refers to the increase in GDP per capita of an 
economy. The exhibit shows this type of economic growth and a marked increase in GDP per 
capita in the U.S. economy over the last 200 years, though the increase is not entirely steady and 
there are some jagged movements, corresponding to economic fluctuations. One of these stands 
out: the Great Depression, which started in 1929 and recorded a major contraction in U.S. GDP 
per capita. Despite its importance and its impact on the lives of millions, the Great Depression 
was a temporary event—sustained and steady growth of GDP per capita characterizes the U.S. 
economy both before and after it. In this chapter, we focus on such longer-run movements, 
­returning to economic fluctuations like the Great ­Depression in subsequent chapters.
As a result of the continued economic growth depicted in Exhibit 21.1, U.S. GDP per 
capita and standards of living are much higher today than they were in 1820. For example, 
GDP per capita has increased from $1,858 in 1820 to $13,056 in 1950 and to $45,336 in 
2012 (all numbers in 2005 constant dollars). (Notice that the vertical axis of this exhibit 
has a proportional scale, similar to those we have used in several exhibits in Chapters 19 
and 20, and ensures that the distance between $500 and $2,500 is the same as that between 
$2,500 and $12,500. We explain why this is a good way of presenting the data shortly.)
Let us first specify the measurement of growth in a little more detail. A growth rate is 
defined as the change in a quantity—here, GDP per capita—between two dates, relative 
to the baseline (beginning of period) quantity. Let’s choose two dates, say t and t + 1, and 
denote GDP per capita in these two dates by yt and yt +1, respectively. Then the growth rate 
of GDP per capita between these two dates is defined as
 Growtht, t + 1 = yt + 1 - yt
yt
.
Let us focus on annual differences, so that, for example, t and t + 1 correspond to the years 
2005 and 2006, respectively. The U.S. economy had GDP per capita of $42,482 in 2005 
and $43,215 in 2006, so the growth rate between 2005 and 2006 can be computed as
 Growth2005, 2006 = $43,215 - $42,482
$42,482
= 0.017
(or equivalently, 0.017 × 100 = 1.7%). Using this formula, we can compute growth rates 
of GDP for any country.
Exhibit 21.2 depicts the annual growth rate of GDP per capita of the U.S. economy 
between 1950 and 2012, which is computed using this formula. It shows that the average 
growth rate is positive, at approximately 2.03 percent, but economic fluctuations are also 
visible here, including the one starting in 2008, the “Great Recession” which we discuss in 
greater detail in Chapter 26.
Exponential Growth
Central to our discussion of economic growth is the idea of 
­exponential growth, which refers to the process by which a 
quantity grows at an approximately constant growth rate. This re-
sults because the increase in the value of a variable (yt+1 – yt in 
terms of the above equation) is proportional to its current value (yt 
in terms of the above equation). As we will next see, exponential 
growth results because new growth builds on past growth and its 
Economic growth, or growth, is 
the increase in GDP per capita of an 
economy.
The growth rate is the change in 
a quantity, for example, GDP per 
capita, between two dates, relative 
to the baseline (beginning of period) 
quantity.
Exponential growth results because 
new growth builds on past growth 
and its effects compound.
Exponential growth refers to a 
situation in which the growth process 
can be described by an approximately 
constant growth rate of a variable 
such as GDP or GDP per capita.

21.1
effects compound. This implies that relatively modest differences in growth rates translate 
into large differences in the level of a quantity after many years of growing.
The exponential nature of economic growth is one of the major reasons why there are 
such large differences in GDP per capita across countries like the ones we saw in the 
previous chapter.
To understand both exponential growth and its implications, consider a simple example, 
where a variable Yt starts out with the value 1 in the year 2000 and has a constant growth 
rate of 5 percent (0.05) in subsequent years. What will be the value of this variable in the 
year 2015? A first guess might be obtained by adding the increment of 1 × 0.05 = 0.05 to 
the base value 15 times (once for every year between 2000 and 2015). This would give us 
an increase of 15 × 0.05 = 0.75, thus producing the value Y2015 = 1.75.
But this is not a correct depiction of how growth takes place because the power of 
­compounding has to be factored in. Let’s see why this is so by starting with 2001. With a 
growth rate of 5 percent, we will have Y2001 = 1.05. What about in 2002? The key here is that 
the additional 5 percent growth between 2001 and 2002 will start from 1.05—not from the 
initial level of 1.00. Hence, we will have Y2002 = 1.05 × 1.05 = 1.1025. Similarly, Y2003 = 
1.1025 × 1.05 = 1.1576, and by continuing like this, we obtain Y2015 = 2.0789.
The reason why this number is greater than the naive guess of 1.75 is because of ­compounding, 
the root cause of exponential growth. Exponential growth results because current growth builds 
on past growth. For example, to obtain Y2003 we started from the level at 2002, Y2002 = 1.1025, 
and built on it, so the incremental growth between 2002 and 2003 was more than 0.05.
One implication of exponential growth is that to depict variables that have exponential growth 
(approximately constant growth rates), it is much more convenient to use an axis with a pro-
portional scale, like the vertical axis in Exhibit 21.1. This is intuitive: a 10 percent growth rate 
starting from a base of 1,000 will take us to 1,100, but if we had started with 100,000, it would 
have taken us to 110,000. The increment is very different in two cases (100 vs. 10,000), but it 
is the same as a proportion of the base value—10 percent. As a ­result, it is more instructive to 
show this change on a proportional scale where the 10 percent growth corresponds to the same 
distance on the vertical axis regardless of whether we start from a base of 1,000 or 100,000. ­ 
Exhibit 21.3, on the other hand, shows how Exhibit 21.1 would look if we were to use the usual 
nonproportional scale. You can see that this exhibit creates a misleading impression that GDP per 
capita in the United States was accelerating, whereas with a proportional scale in Exhibit 21.1, 
we can clearly distinguish the approximately constant rate of growth of U.S. GDP per capita.
To see the power of exponential growth on economic growth, consider two countries 
with the same level of GDP per capita in 1810, say $1,000 (in 2005 constant U.S. dollars). 
Furthermore, suppose that growth is exponential and, in particular, that GDP per capita in 
one of these countries grows at 2 percent per year while in the other one it grows at just  
1 percent. At first glance, this difference seems small. And it is true that such a difference 
in growth will have only small implications over one or two years.

Chapter 21  |  Economic Growth
But the implications of this difference 200 years later will be quite impressive. The 
country growing at 1 percent per year will achieve GDP per capita of approximately $7,316 
in 2010. In contrast, because of the exponential nature of growth, the country growing at 
2 percent per year over the same period will reach a GDP per capita of $52,485. Thus, there 
will be a more than sevenfold difference between these two countries resulting from “just” 
a 1 percent difference in growth rates.
If instead of 1 percent growth per year, the second country had no growth (that is, 0 per-
cent growth rate), then it would remain at the same level of GDP per capita, $1,000, in 2010. 
You have two choices. You can either start a job with a 
salary of $1,000 per month and a 6 percent increase in 
your salary every month. Or you can start with a salary 
of $2,000, but never get a raise. Which one of these two 
options do you prefer?
The answer might naturally vary from person to per-
son. If you have an immediate need for money, you 
may be ­attracted by the prospect of a $2,000 paycheck. 
But before you rush to sign on the dotted line for the 
$2,000-per-month job, think of the implications of the 
6 percent monthly increase. With a 6 percent-per-month 
increase, your monthly salary will already exceed $2,000 
after only a year. After 4 years, it will be approximately 
$16,400 a month. So if you were thinking of staying in this 
job for more than a year, starting with a lower salary might 
be a much better idea.
The first option is attractive, at least for those of you 
intending to stay with it for a while, precisely because of 
exponential growth. The 6-percent-per-month increases 
in salary do not apply to the base salary (if they did, this 
would have increased your salary by $60 every month). 
Rather, they compound, meaning that each 6 percent 
applies to the amount that has accumulated up to that 
point. Thus after 1 month, your salary will be $1,060. 
­After 2 months, it is $1,060 × 1.06 = $1,123.60. After  
3 months, it is $1,123.60 × 1.06 = $1,191.02, and so on. 
We will next see that exponential growth plays the same 
role in countries’ growth trajectories as in your potential 
income in these two hypothetical jobs.

The gap between the two countries, in this case, would be a truly striking fifty-two-fold! 
This example again illustrates the power of exponential growth—or, in this case, the lack 
thereof.
Patterns of Growth
Exponential growth is largely responsible for how the large differences in GDP per capita 
that we observe today (and discussed in the previous chapter) emerged over time. The na-
tions that are relatively rich today have grown steadily over the past 200 years, whereas 
those that are poor have failed to do so.
To see these effects of economic growth on economies in the real world, we now turn 
to Exhibit 21.4, which shows the patterns of growth in GDP per capita across a num-
ber of countries between 1960 and 2010 (in PPP-adjusted 2005 constant dollars, where 
PPP again stands for “purchasing power parity”). The third column of the exhibit sum-
marizes growth between 1960 and 2010. Instead of showing the growth rate between these 
two dates ­using the formula we described above, this column provides the implied annual 
growth rate, which shows how much on average each country needed to grow each year to 
reach the 2010 level starting with the 1960 number. (Exactly how this number is computed 
is ­explained in the appendix to this chapter.)
What do these comparisons tell us? For one thing, we see that GDP per capita has 
increased significantly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France; the 
growth rates in the last column confirm this. For example, both the United States and 
the United Kingdom show an average annual growth rate of about 2 percent between 
1960 and 2010.
The exhibit also tells us that there has been an even greater increase in GDP per capita 
and correspondingly higher growth rates for ­Singapore, Spain, South Korea, Botswana, 
and China. All five of these countries were significantly poorer than the United States in 
1960, but they closed some or almost all the gap with the United States by 2010. Such 
success is reflected in the higher growth rates for these countries. 
For example, the average annual growth rates of GDP per capita 
in ­Botswana, South Korea, and Singapore during this period were 
above 5 percent, and China’s was 4.72 percent.
The exhibit also shows other countries that have not closed the 
gap between themselves and richer countries, or have done so only 
to a limited extent. These nations include Mexico, Brazil, and In-
dia, which show similar or only slightly higher growth rates than 
the United States. Guatemala, Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda, and Haiti 
had even lower growth rates than the United States over this time 
period and thus have become relatively poorer. In fact, we see from 
the data in this exhibit that GDP per capita in Kenya has essentially 
been stagnant over this almost 50-year period, and GDP per capita in 
Haiti has declined at the rate of 0.14 percent a year. As a result, Haiti 
was much poorer at the end of 2010 than it was in 1960. Things have 
only gotten worse for Haiti since its devastating earthquake in 2010, 
which not only killed over 200,000 Haitians but also destroyed the 
country’s already crumbling infrastructure.
How has GDP per capita evolved in these countries relative to 
the United States? Exhibit 21.5 illustrates this by taking some of 
the countries from Exhibit 21.4 and plotting their levels of GDP 
per capita divided by GDP per capita in the United States, all in 
PPP-adjusted 2005 constant dollars.
The overall patterns are consistent with those shown in 
­Exhibit 21.4, but the growth of these economies over time also re-
veals some interesting facts. For example, GDP per capita in the 
United ­Kingdom has remained at about 70 to 80 percent of the GDP 
per capita of the United States since the 1950s. Spain and South 
Korea showed early spurts of rapid growth, even though they started 
with very different income levels at the beginning of the period. 
By the 1980s, both countries had closed much of the gap between

GDP per capita in 2010 is determined 
both by GDP per capita in 1960 and 
the average annual growth rate of GDP 
per capita in between these two years. 
We see how Botswana is much richer 
than Kenya and Ghana today, even 
though ­Botswana started out poorer, 
because ­Botswana grew on average at 
5.47 ­percent while the average annual 
growth was only 0.40 percent for Kenya 
and 0.98 percent for Ghana. For the same 
reasons, today South Korea is richer than 
Brazil and Singapore is richer than Spain.

themselves and the United States, though they both also show periods of relative decline. 
Brazil also experienced relatively rapid growth in the 1950s and 1960s, closing some of the 
gap with the United States. But around 1980, this process went into reverse, and by 2010, 
GDP per capita in Brazil was about 20 percent of the GDP per capita of the United States—
not much above where it started, in relative terms, in the 1950s. Finally, although there was 
a huge gap between the United States and China during the communist dictatorship of Mao 
Tse-tung (Mao Zedong), this gap started narrowing rapidly following Mao’s death in 1976 
and the opening of the Chinese economy in 1978.

Is China now poorer relative to the United States than it was 
in 1980? We saw in Exhibit 21.5 how Chinese GDP per cap-
ita relative to that of the United States has increased greatly 
over the past 30 years. Yet now consider Exhibit 21.6, which 
plots GDP per capita in China and the United States since 
1950. This picture creates the impression that the gap be-
tween the United States and China is opening up and that 
China is becoming relatively poorer. This is not the case, 
however. In fact, trying to decide whether China is becom-
ing poorer or richer compared to the United States from 
a figure such as Exhibit 21.6 is an example of a common 
error: comparing levels of variables exhibiting exponential 
growth. You will have noticed that precisely to avoid this 
type of fallacy, in Exhibit 21.5 we do not simply plot the 
GDP per capita levels of different countries; rather, we look 
at these levels divided by GDP per capita in the United 
States. By doing so, we directly examine the ratio between 
GDP in the given country and in the United States.
To see the advantage of this procedure, consider two 
hypothetical countries. Say that the first one is twice as 
rich as the second and has GDP per capita of $20,000, 
while the second has GDP per capita of $10,000. Now 
suppose that they both grow by 10 percent. The first 
country will then have GDP per capita of $22,000 and 
the second one will have GDP per capita of $11,000. The 
ratio between the two has not changed, but the absolute 
gap in incomes has increased by $1,000. Thus, comparing 
levels of GDP is not enlightening when there is exponen-
tial growth. In the presence of exponential growth, when 
relative GDP remains stable, absolute gaps will increase. 
For this reason, looking at ratios is the right thing to do in 
Exhibit 21.5. It is an oft-repeated error to compare levels 
of variables exhibiting exponential growth such as GDP 
or investment rather than ratios.

To convey a more complete picture of growth patterns over the last 50 years, Exhibit 21.7 
shows a graph of the growth rates of all countries for which we have data between 1960 and 
2010. It shows that there is a wide range of growth rates. Some countries, such as Haiti and 
the Democratic Republic of Congo, have grown at negative rates during this period, while 
others, such as South Korea and Singapore, have achieved very high growth rates.
Using historical data, we can compare growth across countries even further back in time 
than 1960. To show these growth patterns in a simple way, Exhibit 21.8 lists levels of GDP per 
capita for several countries (in PPP-adjusted 1990 constant dollars) in 1820, 1870, 1920, 1970, 
and 2010 and their annual growth rates between 1820 and 2010 and between 1920 and 2010.
We see that income levels are not all that different across countries in 1820. For 
­example, the United States was only about twice as rich as Mexico (U.S. GDP per capita

of $1,361 vs. Mexico’s $627). But by 2010, there was a sizable gap between these two 
countries, which can be accounted for by their different growth rates. The average growth 
rate of the United States between 1820 and 2010 was 1.65 percent a year, while Mexico 
grew at an average rate of only 1.33 percent a year. The contrast ­between the United States 
and India is even starker. India started out with a little less than half of the GDP per capita 
of the United States in 1820. But by 2010, the gap was nearly tenfold. Once again, this is a 
direct consequence of the difference in the two countries’ growth rates in GDP per capita.
This exhibit also shows that in 1820, the United Kingdom was significantly richer than 
the United States. Yet by 2010, the United States was about 30 percent richer than the United 
Kingdom. This change is because of differences in growth rates: while the United States 
grew at 1.65 percent a year, the United Kingdom grew at only 1.29 percent a year. This 
relatively small difference in growth rates was sufficient for the United States to overtake 
the United Kingdom and become about 30 percent richer by 2010. We can also see from 
this exhibit how several other countries, including Spain, South Korea, and China, became 
poorer relative to the United States by 1970. Yet it also shows that these countries grew faster 
than the United States over the past 40 years, closing the gap that had opened up previously.
Part of this growth is what we call catch-up growth, meaning that these nations are catch-
ing up with the income and technology leader of the world, in this case the United States. Coun-
tries undergoing catch-up growth do so mostly by benefiting from available technologies, but 
also by increasing their saving, efficiency units of labor, and efficiency of production. Catch-up 
growth is very important in practice, though as the examples of slow growth and stagnation in 
Exhibit 21.8 demonstrate, it is far from automatic. In the next chapter, we discuss in greater 
detail why many countries have failed to take advantage of this type of catch-up growth.
Finally, Exhibit 21.8 drives home yet another important idea. The United States and sev-
eral other countries—for example, the United Kingdom, France, and Spain—demonstrate 
sustained growth between 1820 and 2010 in the sense that there is a positive and relatively 
steady growth rate in every 50-year period, and the growth rate for the entire period is 
significantly positive for these countries. Our next task is to understand how this type of 
sustained growth emerges and what factors determine the growth rate of an economy.
Catch-up growth refers to a growth 
process whereby relatively poorer 
nations increase their incomes by 
taking advantage of knowledge 
and technologies already invented 
in other, technologically more 
advanced countries.
Sustained growth refers to a growth 
process where GDP per capita 
grows at a positive and relatively 
steady rate for long periods of time.

A few countries, in particular Botswana, Singapore, and South Korea, have grown very 
rapidly, with average growth rates above 5 percent, while others, such as Haiti, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nicaragua have had negative growth since 1960.

The aggregate production function, which we studied in the previous chapter, gives us a first 
answer to this question. Recall that the aggregate production function, Y = A 3 F(K, H), 
links GDP to the two factors of production, the physical capital (K) and total efficiency 
units of labor (H). The aggregate production function also depends on the level of tech-
nology (A), which captures the knowledge available to the economy and the efficiency of 
production. When A changes, the aggregate production function shifts.
A nation can increase its GDP by increasing its stock of physical capital, K; by increasing 
the total efficiency units of labor, H (for example, by increasing the human capital of workers); 
and by improving its technology, A. In this section, we look more closely at these three areas.
Let us consider the physical capital stock, K, which represents the value of all of the 
equipment (for example, machines, cars, planes, and computers) and structures (like build-
ings) of the economy. The physical capital stock (and therefore GDP) can be increased by 
investment, a process also known as physical capital accumulation.
You will recall from Chapter 19 that the national income accounting identity implies  
that Y = C + I + G + X − M, where C is consumption (household expenditures on con-
sumption of goods and services), I is investment (expenditures on investment goods by 
private agents), G is government purchases of goods and services, X is exports, and M is 
imports. Recall that in a closed economy, there are no exports or imports, and if we also 
ignore the government (as we have done here), then we have G = X = M = 0. Therefore, 
the national income accounting identity implies
Y = C + I.
In other words, GDP is equal to the sum of aggregate consumption and investment. This 
also implies that investment comes directly from aggregate saving. This is because in our 
closed economy without government spending, all income will be either consumed or 
saved, so GDP is also equal to aggregate consumption plus aggregate saving or, in other 
words, Y = C + S. Thus
I = S.

Interpreted differently, this relationship says that all the resources households decide to 
save will be allocated to firms that will use them for investment (for example, by banks that 
will take money deposited by households and lend it to firms for investment). Consequently, 
a nation with a high saving rate will accumulate physical capital rapidly—that is, increase its 
physical capital stock rapidly—and, by the aggregate production function, increase its GDP. 
Thus to determine whether and how rapidly an economy will increase its physical capital 
stock, we need to understand the saving decisions of households, which we turn to next.
Optimization: The Choice Between Saving and Consumption
Consider the U.S. economy in 2008, when its GDP (aggregate income) stood at 14.44 trillion 
dollars. Naturally, not all of this output was consumed. Firms and the government invested 
some portion of it in the physical capital stock of the nation—for example, in new machines, 
roads, and bridges. But the resources for this investment come from the savings of households. 
For example, in a closed economy without the government, we have just seen that I = S.
Thus to understand how the GDP of a nation is divided between consumption and 
investment, we need to study the preferences of consumers, who decide how much of 
their income will be allocated to savings. This involves studying how households trade off 
consumption today versus consumption tomorrow, because saving is a way of allocating 
some of today’s resources for consumption tomorrow (or more generally, consumption 
in the future). This is yet another example of optimization on the part of individuals and 
households. Each household typically faces different priorities and needs that influence 
its decisions to consume its income today versus save it for tomorrow. For example, those 
preparing to send their children to college may save more today.
As with all optimization problems, such choices are affected by prices. In this case, 
the relevant price is the interest rate, which determines the rate of return that households 
expect on their savings. (How the interest rate is determined will be discussed in detail in 
Chapter 24.) Higher interest rates typically encourage more saving. In addition, expecta-
tions of future income growth and perhaps taxes will have an impact on the saving decision. 
For instance, households that expect rapid income growth in the future may have less rea-
son to save to finance future consumption (because future income growth will enable them 
to do this) or even to save “for a rainy day” (against potential future hardships). Conversely, 
if they expect high taxes in the future, households may save more in order to be able to pay 
these taxes without reducing future consumption.
These trade-offs determine the saving rate of the economy, which corresponds to the 
fraction of income that is saved. (In practice, in addition to households, firms and the 
government also save, and we include these in the total saving of the economy.) We can 
compute the saving rate by dividing total saving by GDP (aggregate income). For example, 
in 2013, the level of total saving in the U.S. economy was $2.18 trillion, while GDP was 
$16.80 trillion (both in current dollars). Then the saving rate is
Saving rate = Total saving
GDP
= $2.18 trillion
$16.80 trillion = 12.98%.
What Brings Sustained Growth?
Can physical capital accumulation by itself generate sustained growth—where GDP per capita 
grows at a positive and relatively steady rate for an extended period of time? The answer to 
this question is “no” for a simple reason: the diminishing marginal product of physical capital.
Let’s look a little more closely at this reasoning. As Exhibit 20.7 from the previous chap-
ter shows, because of the diminishing marginal product of physical capital, more and more 
physical capital will translate into smaller and smaller increases in GDP. This precludes 
the possibility of sustained growth by just accumulating more and more physical capital.
What about steadily raising the efficiency units of labor in the economy? Can’t the 
­efficiency units of labor be raised just by increasing the number of workers in the econ-
omy? Can’t we raise GDP steadily by increasing human capital?
First consider increasing the workforce—the number of people taking part in the produc-
tion process. Holding all other factors of production and technology constant, every addi-
tional worker will increase GDP by less and less because of diminishing marginal product 
The saving rate designates the 
fraction of income that is saved.

Suppose that you control the saving rate in a country and 
your objective is to improve the standard of living of the cit-
izens of this country. Is it always a good idea to ­increase the 
saving rate? We have seen that greater saving ­increases the 
physical capital stock of the economy and consequently 
raises GDP. But this doesn’t mean that increasing ­saving is 
always good for society. Imagine the extreme case where 
as the supreme ruler of a country, you are able to encour-
age saving so much that every dollar earned in the country 
is saved. This will indeed increase GDP. But it will not im-
prove the standard of living of the citizens ­because it will 
require them to consume little or nothing. In the extreme 
case where the saving rate reaches 100 p­ercent, consump-
tion drops to zero. This implies that there must exist an op-
timal level of saving for a society, where saving above this 
level would make the society worse off because it would 
significantly reduce consumption.
CHOICE & CONSEQUENCE
Is Increasing the Saving Rate Always a Good Idea?
of labor (or diminishing marginal product of total efficiency units of labor). Therefore, we 
cannot guarantee a steady increase in GDP per capita by just increasing the workforce either.
Note that we can also increase the efficiency units of labor for a given workforce by 
­increasing the human capital of workers—for example, by raising their educational attain-
ment or skill level. Although such changes will indeed increase GDP, they will, by ­themselves, 
not achieve sustained growth. Because each individual has a finite life, there is a limit to how 
many years of schooling he or she can obtain, and, of course, more and more schooling 
would also imply fewer and fewer years in the workforce where an individual ­actively takes 
part in production. Thus, achieving greater and greater levels of efficiency units by continu-
ously increasing the years of schooling of the workforce does not appear feasible.
“But hold on,” you might say. “What about continuously upgrading the quality of edu-
cation? Wouldn’t that work toward increasing the efficiency units of labor?” Not really. 
Empirically, the extent to which such improvements can ensure steady growth also appears 
to be limited, as we will see in greater detail in the Evidence-Based Economics section of 
this chapter. Therefore, even though investments in education and skills do play a major role 
in increasing GDP per capita, we cannot achieve sustained growth of about 1.5–2 percent a 
year just by continuously increasing the educational achievement of the workforce.
These considerations imply that in order to achieve sustained growth, we need some-
thing else. And that something else is technology—particularly advances in the technical 
knowledge used in production.
Knowledge, Technological Change, and Growth
You will recall that Moore’s Law, which we first encountered in the previous chapter  
­(Exhibit 20.10), claims that the number of transistors on memory microchips will double 
every 2 years, thereby increasing the computational power of computers. This trend has been 
true for at least the last 50 years and probably for longer. For example, around 1900, before 
microprocessors and extra mechanical devices, it was prohibitively expensive to make any-
thing but the most trivial calculations. By 1950, with the technologies associated with the 
vacuum tube, society had access to the technology to make one relevant computation per 
second at a cost of $1,000 (in today’s dollars). By the 1970s, with the advent of the transistor, 
we could make up to 100 calculations per second for $1,000. And by the late 1990s, with 
the widespread use of integrated circuits, almost 10 million calculations per second could be 
performed for the same cost. Moore’s Law is an example of technological change.
Technological change is the process of new technologies and new goods and services 
being invented, introduced, and used in the economy, enabling the economy to achieve a

higher level of GDP for given levels of its factors of production, physi-
cal capital stock, and total efficiency units of labor.
Consider another example of technological change—the reduction 
in the cost of light over the past 200 years—as shown in Exhibit 21.9.1 
Obtaining lighting, both for firms and households, has become much 
cheaper over the past two centuries because of the invention of the 
lightbulb and ongoing improvements in the quality of lightbulbs, light-
ing technology, and the transmission of energy.
 Technological change, as it turns out, is exponential. In particular, 
using the same definition of exponential growth from earlier in this 
chapter, this means that improvements in technology take place at an 
­approximately constant rate—rather than by constant increments. There 
is a simple reason for this exponential nature of technological change. 
As we have seen, growth in GDP per capita is exponential because 
growth compounds—that is, it takes place on the basis of the current 
level of GDP whose increase is already a result of past growth. There is 
a similar logic to technological change. New innovations and technolo-
gies build on the knowledge stock resulting from past innovations—building on the shoul-
ders of ­giants, so to speak. This ensures that innovations improve our productive capacity 
in GDP not by a constant amount but by a constant proportional amount. So if we improve 
technology starting with a technology level that produces a GDP per capita of $1,000, then 
innovations that enable us to be more productive by a certain amount—say 10 percent—will 
raise GDP per capita from $1,000 to $1,100. But if we instead start 
with a technology level that produces $100,000 of GDP per capita, 
­similar innovations bringing a 10 percent improvement will take 
us to $110,000.
The exponential nature of technological change illustrated by 
these two examples is also responsible for the fact that improve-
ments in technology need not necessarily run into diminishing 
marginal product (whereas, as we have seen, increases in the use 
of factors of production run into diminishing marginal product). 
For this reason, improvements in technology appear to be the 
most plausible engine of sustained growth.
By now, you will have realized that there is a nice symmetry between our treatment of 
cross-country differences in GDP per capita in the previous chapter and of over-time dif-
ferences, corresponding to growth, in this chapter. In both, the physical capital stock and 
efficiency units of labor play important roles, but they are insufficient to explain the major 
differences. Both across countries and over time, technology instead plays the central role.
New innovations and ­technologies 
build on the knowledge stock 
­resulting from past innovations—
building on the shoulders of giants, 
so to speak.

Evidence-Based Economics
T
he theoretical discussion in the previous section supports the central role of tech-
nology in explaining sustained growth. We will now see that empirical evidence 
also bolsters the conclusion that technology plays a key role.
To evaluate the sources of U.S. economic growth, we follow the same strategy as in 
the previous chapter. There, we used the aggregate production function and estimates of 
the physical capital stock and the efficiency units of labor across different countries to 
evaluate their contributions to cross-country differences in GDP. The only major differ-
ence here is that higher-quality U.S. data enable us to conduct the analysis for GDP per 
hour worked rather than GDP per worker, thus allowing us to measure the labor input 
more accurately. We start the analysis in 1950.
Exhibit 21.10 records average GDP per hour worked (in 2005 constant dollars), the 
average value of the physical capital stock per hour worked, and the most important com-
ponent of the human capital of workers—the average years of schooling—for 10-year 
periods starting in 1950. (To remove the short-term effects of the last recession from our 
calculations on long-term growth, the last period is 2000–2007.) The exhibit shows the 
steady increase in GDP per hour worked, physical capital stock per hour worked, and 
educational attainment in the United States between 1950 and 2007.
We then use a methodology similar to that in the previous chapter to compute the con-
tribution of physical capital, human capital (efficiency units of labor), and technology to the 
growth of GDP in the United States. The results are recorded in columns 4, 5, and 6 of the ex-
hibit (in percentages). Column 7 then gives the annual growth rate of GDP per hour worked, 
which is the sum of the contributions of physical capital, human capital, and technology.
This exhibit highlights the central role that technology has played in U.S. growth. 
Let’s examine the 1960s, shown in the second row. The 0.17 percent recorded as the 
contribution of human capital indicates that if the human capital of U.S. workers had 
remained constant in the 1960s, then the growth rate of GDP per hour worked in the 
1960s would have been lower by 0.17 percent (3.09 percent instead of 3.26 percent). In

Exhibit 21.11 Share of Technology, Physical Capital, and Human Capital in the 
Growth of GDP per Hour Worked in the United States Between 1950 and 2007
This exhibit shows the contribution of physical capital, human capital, and ­technology 
to growth of GDP per hour worked in the United States. The sum of the three ­numbers 
is the growth rate in the period, indicated at the top. It is clear that ­technology is the 
single most important contributor to economic growth in the United States.

contrast, if technology had stayed constant, the annual growth rate of GDP per hour worked 
would have been lower by 2.20 percent. The other rows of the exhibit paint a similar pic-
ture. Mirroring our findings on the role of technology in accounting for cross-country dif-
ferences in the previous chapter, technology accounts for the bulk of growth in U.S. GDP 
per hour worked in most periods.
Exhibit 21.11 presents the same information as the last four columns of Exhibit 21.10 in 
a bar chart, more clearly showing the decomposition of growth between the two factors of 
production and technology. It also highlights the central role of technology. The total height 
of each bar is the annual growth of GDP per hour worked during the corresponding period, 
while the orange part of the bar shows the contribution of technology. It shows that, except 
between 1980 and 1989, technology was the most important contributor to U.S. growth.
The contribution of technology was somewhat lower during the 1970s and 1980s, which 
were decades of relatively low growth in GDP per hour worked, while the stock of physi-
cal capital in the economy continued to increase—partly because there was considerable 
investment in information technology capital during these decades.
An important caveat to the conclusions supported by Exhibits 21.10 and 21.11 is worth 
noting. As pointed out in the previous chapter and in Exhibit 21.10, the contribution of 
technology is obtained as the fraction of growth in GDP not explained by physical capital 
and human capital. This implies that if we understate the contribution of physical capital or 
human capital to GDP growth, which could happen, for example, because we do not fully 
take into account the improved quality of our physical capital stock, then the contribution 
of technology may be somewhat exaggerated.

Exhibit 21.8 depicted economic development in several countries since 1820. This  
200-year period is sometimes referred to as “modern times.” But what about before then? 
Did patterns of growth before the nineteenth century look similar to those we have docu-
mented so far in this chapter? If not, what changed?
Growth Before Modern Times
Humanity had, of course, a long history before the nineteenth century, during which there 
were several major achievements in science, technology, and the arts. But from an eco-
nomic point of view, the period before 1800 is distinguished by one thing: a lack of sus-
tained growth. Looking back at Exhibits 21.1 and 21.2, we see that the U.S. economy has 
had some downturns and one big setback during the Great Depression, but on the whole, it 
has experienced relatively steady economic growth in GDP per capita.
Though the world before 1800 was certainly not stagnant, it did not experience the 
type of sustained growth we see in Exhibit 21.1. There were a few notable periods of 
economic growth and even technological improvements, some of which continued for as 
long as a century or even more. The periods that are most well known are those in ancient 
Greece, ancient Rome, and Venice. During the heydays of these civilizations, standards 
of living improved and economic activity increased significantly. But this growth didn’t 
last. ­Ancient Rome may have grown, although relatively slowly, for over 300 years, but its 
growth ultimately came to an end. The situation was similar in Venice.
Even though there was some economic growth during all of these eras, sustained 
economic growth was rare or even absent. There is a simple way to see why growth in 
these ancient civilizations could not have been sustained. The World Bank’s definition of 
­absolute poverty as living off the equivalent of $1.25 per day, which we discussed in the 
previous chapter, is not an entirely arbitrary one. An individual needs to consume a certain 
amount of calories in order to live, and, of course, people need shelter and clothing. Though 
­estimates vary, it is practically impossible for a country to have income (GDP) per capita

of much less than $500 or so per year, because this would imply that a large fraction of the 
population would be living on much less than $500 per person. We call this level of income 
per capita below which an individual cannot easily survive the subsistence level (even if 
there isn’t one unique subsistence level that applies in every environment). The general 
idea is simple: regardless of the exact level, there exists a minimum level of income per 
person that is necessary for individual survival and subsistence. When income falls below 
this level, much of the population will starve.
Of course, there were no national income and product accounts 10,000 years ago, 
1,000 years ago, or even 200 years ago. All the same, we know that income per capita 
in all places in which there were human civilizations could not have been much less than 
$500 per capita in today’s dollars. Moreover, we know from Exhibit 21.8 that at the begin-
ning of the nineteenth century, incomes in much of the world were not much higher than 
$500 per capita. In the United States, for example, income per capita was about $1,361, 
and in Western Europe, it was only a little higher. Therefore, there cannot have been much 
sustained growth before 1800.
There are two reasons for this lack of sustained growth before modern times. The 
first—the more important one—is related to the major factor that explains sustained 
growth: technology. Before 1800, though there were some important technological 
breakthroughs, the pace of technological change was much slower, almost stagnant com-
pared to what came thereafter. Second, whatever improvements in aggregate incomes 
(GDP) were realized did not typically translate into increases in income per capita. This 
last point was the basis of the theory of Thomas Malthus, which is sometimes referred 
to as the Malthusian model. We next discuss the Malthusian model and how the world 
broke out of it.
Malthusian Limits to Growth
Thomas Malthus had a particularly dismal view of the workings of the economy. This was 
partly because, writing in 1798, he had not seen a period of steady growth like the one ­Europe 
experienced in the nineteenth century.2 Malthus thought that fertility—defined as the num-
ber of children per adult or per woman of childbearing age—would adjust so that income 
always would remain close to a subsistence level, a number like the $500 a year we men-
tioned earlier. In Malthus’s theory, couples have more children when the standard of living 
is above the subsistence level. Then, assuming that aggregate income (GDP) could not grow 
faster than the population, Malthus concluded that increasing population would push income 
per capita down toward—and possibly below—the subsistence level. This fall in income per 
capita in turn would trigger famines or wars that would kill a large fraction of the popula-
tion. With a given level of aggregate income, a lower population would then cause income 
per capita to increase again. So in a pattern sometimes referred to as the Malthusian cycle, 
increased ­aggregate income would raise income per capita above subsistence, fueling popu-
lation growth, which in turn would put pressure on resources and reduce income per capita 
back to its initial level or sometimes even below it. This pattern subsequently “corrects” the 
increase in population through reduced fertility and higher mortality, often due to famines.
Dismal though it may be, the Malthusian model seems to be a good representation of 
how the world actually was before 1800.
Around the same time or shortly thereafter, fertility declined. This process, which 
has both economic and social causes, is referred to as the demographic transition. 
Economists typically emphasize the importance of the transition from agriculture and 
rural areas toward industry and cities as a major cause of the demographic transition. 
Urban families did not need to rely on child labor for help in the field in the same way 
that rural families did, and the increasing costs of rearing children, particularly when 
they had to stay in school longer rather than work in the fields, created incentives for 
smaller families.
Many historians and economists view the demographic transition as a central ingredi-
ent to modern growth, because it enabled the economies that experienced reduced fer-
tility to break away from the Malthusian cycle. Until the demographic transition in the 
nineteenth century, there were recurrent Malthusian cycles. After this date, there was 
relatively sustained growth in income per capita in many economies, particularly in the 
Western world.
The subsistence level is the 
minimum level of income per person 
that is generally necessary for the 
individual to obtain enough calories, 
shelter, and clothing to survive.
Fertility refers to the number of 
children per adult or per woman of 
childbearing age.
The Malthusian cycle refers to 
the preindustrial pattern in which 
increases in aggregate income lead 
to an expanding population, which 
in turn reduces income per capita 
and puts downward pressure on 
population.
The demographic transition refers 
to the decline in fertility and number 
of children per family that many 
societies undergo as they transition 
from agriculture to industry.

The Industrial Revolution
But the demographic transition by itself would not have been sufficient to kick-start growth. 
If all that happened was that fertility declined and stabilized around a lower number, there 
would not necessarily have been any qualitative changes in the patterns of GDP growth per 
capita. Instead, sustained growth was due to another major change that occurred around 
the same time: the Industrial Revolution, which opened the way for more steady and rapid 
technological changes that underpinned modern economic growth.
Contrary to its name, the Industrial Revolution was a gradual process rather than a 
short period of rapid disruption. It is the term coined to designate the arrival of many 
new machines and methods of production in Britain, starting in textile manufacturing and 
thereafter spreading into other sectors. The Industrial Revolution is important both as an 
event in itself (because it was the first time technology and scientific methods were used 
in production in such a coordinated manner) and also as the starting point of the wave of 
industrialization that spread to many other countries around the world. We have already 
seen that the countries that are rich today are those that have managed to achieve steady 
growth rates over the past 200 years. Those are also the ones that have managed to benefit 
from the technologies brought about by the Industrial Revolution.
Although clearly new technologies and new knowledge were created before, innovation 
and the application of new technologies to the production of goods and services became 
more systematic and pervasive during and in the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution. 
The available evidence thus suggests that changes in technology that are the root cause of 
the sustained growth we observe today started with the Industrial Revolution at the end of 
the eighteenth century in Britain.
Growth and Technology Since the Industrial Revolution
Many of the technologies that we take for granted today—from railroads to automobiles 
and airplanes; from radio and TV to telecommunication technologies, computers, the 
­Internet, and social networking; from electricity to almost all of the technologies used on 
the factory floor to produce the goods we use in our everyday life; from almost all of the 
drugs that save hundreds of millions of lives every year around the world to basic sanita-
tion including indoor plumbing—have been invented and made available to us over the 
last 250 years. Such advances are the result of the exponential growth in our knowledge 
and technology since the Industrial Revolution. An important foundation of this growth 
has been research and development (R&D) activity, which firms, universities, and gov-
ernments undertake in order to improve this knowledge base. The United States today 
spends 365 billion dollars, or 2.79 percent of its GDP, on R&D every year. This number is 
even higher in some other countries—for example, 4.66 percent in Israel, 3.00 percent in 
­Switzerland, and 3.70 percent in Sweden. To a large extent, our high standards of living 
today are the return on this R&D investment.
Industrial Revolution is the 
term used for describing the 
series of innovations and their 
implementation in the production 
process that started to take place at 
the end of the eighteenth century 
in Britain.
The fact that an economy is growing 
does not necessarily imply that all 
citizens are benefiting equally from 
that growth.
The fact that an economy is growing does not necessarily imply 
that all citizens are benefiting equally from that growth. In fact, in 
recent decades, rapid growth in the U.S. economy has gone hand-
in-hand with increases in inequality. There are almost always 
some households and individuals with significantly higher-than-
average incomes and some with significantly lower-than-average 
incomes. In fact, economic growth is sometimes associated with 
increasing inequality because only some workers and businesses 
benefit from the new technologies that are driving this growth.
Growth and Inequality
There are several reasons why a society might care about inequality. Some may wish to 
live in a society that does not have great disparities in the living standards of its citizens.

Exhibit 21.12 shows a simple measure of inequality in the 
United States: the share of total U.S. income accruing to the 
richest 10 percent (the other 90 percent of Americans earned 
less than individuals in this top decile, and their aggregate 
earnings correspond to the remaining fraction). The data, 
compiled by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel 
Saez, show that until 1940, the top 10 percent earned about 
45 to 50 percent of total income.3 This proportion then de-
clined to about 35 percent, corresponding to a significant 
­decline in income inequality. It then remained there until the 
late 1970s. Starting in the late 1970s, however, inequality 
started increasing, and by the end of the 1990s, the share of 
the top 10 percent is again up to about 50 ­percent. ­Piketty 
and Saez also show another interesting pattern. Before the 
1970s, much of the earnings of the very rich came from 
capital income—that is, income from sources other than 
wages and salaries, like dividends, accrued wealth, income 
from ownership, and so on. But over the last 30 years, the 
contribution of wages to the income of the very rich has 
changed dramatically, rising to 60 percent in 2000 (though 
it subsequently fell to 38 percent in 2007). More and more, 
even the rich have to work.

Top 10 Percent of Earners
Though growth in the United States has been relatively steady and sustained, 
the distribution of gains from that growth has changed considerably over time. 
At the beginning of the twentieth century, the richest Americans—the top 
10 percent of earners—captured almost 50 percent of total income. The distri-
bution of income became more equal in the 1940s and remained so until the 
mid-1970s. Inequality then started increasing again, with the share of the top 
10 percent of earners in total income reaching 50 percent once again today.

We may feel that greater inequality leads to more social polarization or even to a greater 
incidence of crime in society.
So far, we have focused on income (GDP) per capita as the main measure of the pro-
ductivity and living standards of a nation. But average income per capita of a nation at a 
particular point in time is not the same as the income of all individuals in that nation. As we 
already noted in Chapter 20, this distinction cautions us against focusing just on income per 
capita without taking into account the distribution of income in a given society.
While it is certainly justifiable to care about inequality in and of itself, one reason why 
many policymakers and citizens are concerned about it is because it is associated with pov-
erty. Poverty, particularly of the extreme sort captured by the $1.25 per day measure of the

World Bank, leads to serious economic, health, and social problems. High infant mortality, 
child malnourishment, lack of access to education, and the inability to take part in several 
major economic activities are just some of the problems typically associated with extreme 
levels of poverty. However, it is important to distinguish between inequality and poverty, 
as we do in the above Choice & Consequence box.
Growth and Poverty
What is the relationship between growth and poverty? We saw in the previous chapter 
how countries with higher levels of income (GDP) per capita have fewer people living 
in poverty, as measured by the $1.25 per day measure of the World Bank. Exhibit 21.13 
Consider a society consisting of just two types of people: 
rich and poor. Suppose also that half of the population 
is rich and the other half is poor. Now consider two sce-
narios. In Scenario 1, the rich have $50,000 each, while 
the poor have $1,000 each. In Scenario 2, the rich have 
$5,000, while the poor have $500. Which society would 
you like to live in?
The answer to this question will naturally depend on 
several factors. Different people will evaluate inequality 
and poverty differently. Suppose first that you only care 
about average income and not at all about equity. Then 
the comparison is straightforward. You will easily com-
pute that average income in Scenario 1 is $25,500, while 
it is only $2,750 in Scenario 2. The first scenario clearly 
dominates.
Suppose, on the other hand, that you only care about 
equity. One way of thinking about this is to just focus on a 
measure of inequality and nothing else. In that case, you 
will see that Scenario 1 has greater inequality because 
the ratio of rich-to-poor incomes is 50. In contrast, in 
Scenario 2, the same ratio is only 10. So if you care only 
about inequality and nothing else, you may be tempted 
to say that Scenario 2 is preferable.
There is a fallacy here, however. Most of us would 
care about inequality because we associate it with pov-
erty and low living standards for part of the population. 
Yet ­Scenario 1, despite having greater inequality, also 
has much less poverty. In Scenario 1, the poor individu-
als have $1,000 each, whereas in Scenario 2, each poor 
individual has only $500, regardless of that economy’s 
greater equality. Therefore, even if we strongly care about 
the welfare of others and the level of poverty in society, 
just focusing on inequality would be an error. In fact, in 
this case, Scenario 1 has both greater average income 
and lower poverty. If, instead of noticing this, we just fo-
cused on inequality, presuming that a more equal alloca-
tion would also have lower poverty, we would have made 
an error in judgment.

complements this picture by showing that, on average, growth of income per capita is 
associated with a decline in poverty. For each country in the data, the vertical axis shows 
the percentage rise or decline in poverty between 1993 and the late 2000s (depending 
on data availability), while the horizontal axis shows the average growth between the 
same dates.
Those in the lower-right quadrant are the countries that have experienced positive 
growth and declines in poverty and include China, India, and Vietnam, among others. 
­Venezuela in the upper-left quadrant is one of only three countries that has a negative 
growth rate and has also experienced an increase in poverty. The exhibit also includes 
the line that best fits these points. Although there are some countries where growth and 
poverty have both increased (such as Yemen, Nigeria, and Georgia), on the whole there 
is a negative association between growth over the recent decades and the fraction of the 
population living in poverty. Yet the exhibit also shows that there is quite a bit of disper-
sion around that best-fit line.
Even though this association does not prove that growth in income per capita is the 
direct cause of declining poverty, it is the type of evidence that bolsters many econo-
mists’ belief that economic growth is one of the most effective ways of reducing pov-
erty. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that there is no guarantee that economic 
growth will automatically reduce poverty (as the cases of Georgia, Nigeria, and Yemen 
in the exhibit show). It will do so only if it is not associated with a significant rise in 
inequality.
How Can We Reduce Poverty?
Many different policies have been pursued in order to reduce international poverty, 
and, for reasons that we discuss in greater detail in the next chapter, many have failed. 
Thus it is quite likely that there are no silver-bullet policies for reducing poverty 
around the world.
Nevertheless, economic analysis suggests several potentially useful approaches. One 
solution, which we explore further in Chapter 28, is international trade, which can be ben-
eficial to all countries that take part in it. Although international trade does create losers 
as well as winners, the overall benefit from international trade is generally positive and 
significant. This is particularly so for many poor countries that have natural resources and 
produce agricultural goods that could be exported to the European Union or the United 
States but are blocked by high tariffs and prohibitive quotas. Reducing tariffs and quotas 
that wealthy nations impose on poor countries would be one way of creating gains in GDP 
and perhaps even growth for these nations. In fact, trade might have even further benefits. 
If international trade also brings with it more interaction with wealthy nations, such cross-
country contact might facilitate the transfer of technology.
Another important aspect of improving standards of living around the world is to con-
tinue improving the knowledge and technology available in the world economy. The United 
States spends a sizable fraction of its GDP on R&D, and a significant fraction of its work-
force works in science and engineering. The improvements that result from these efforts 
in the United States and in countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and 
Germany improve not only the standards of living in these nations but also those all around 
the world. For example, improvements in communications technology that originated in 
the United States and Western Europe now enable cell phones to be used globally, which 
has helped improve the lives and the business opportunities of billions of people elsewhere. 
Before wireless communication became available, people in many countries had to rely on 
wireline telephones for communication.
But wireline telephone industry was often under state control or a private monopoly, 
and as a consequence, it was very expensive and not widely available. The advances in 
wireless technology have partly broken the hold of these monopolies on consumers. As 
the technology improves, wireless telecommunication can be used for better healthcare 
­delivery, and it is already being used as an important part of business deals, starting with 
improving communication between firms. Similarly, innovations in pharmaceuticals allow 
lives to be saved around the world, not just in the United States or Germany or France.

Life expectancy around the world was much lower 70 years 
ago than it is today.4 In 1940, child and infant mortality 
rates were so high and adult diseases, such as pneumonia 
and tuberculosis, were so deadly (and without any cure) 
that life expectancy at birth in many nations stood at less 
than 40 years. For example, the life expectancy at birth 
of an average Indian was an incredibly low 30 years. In 
Venezuela, it was 33; in Indonesia, 34; in ­Brazil, 36. Life 
expectancy at birth in many Western nations was also low 
but still considerably higher than the corresponding num-
bers in the poorer nations. Consider that life expectancy 
at birth in the United States was 64 years.
In the course of the next three or four decades, this 
picture changed dramatically. As we saw in the previous 
chapter, while the gap in life expectancy between rich 
and poor nations still remains today, health conditions 
have improved significantly all over the world, particularly 
before the spread of the AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan 
Africa starting in the 1980s. Life expectancy at birth in 
India in 1999 was 60 years. This was twice as large as the 
same number in 1940. It was also 50 percent higher than 
life expectancy at birth in Britain in 1820 (40 years), which 
had approximately the same GDP per capita as India in 
1999. How did this tremendous improvement in health 
conditions in poor nations take place?
The answer lies in scientific breakthroughs and innova-
tions that took place in the United States and Western 
Europe throughout the twentieth century. First, there 
was a wave of global drug innovation, most importantly 
the development of antibiotics, which produced many 
products that were highly effective against major killers 
in ­developing countries. Penicillin, which provided an ef-
fective treatment against a range of bacterial infections, 
­became widely available by the early 1950s. Also impor-
tant during the same period was the development of new 
vaccines, including ones against yellow fever and smallpox.
The second major factor was the discovery of DDT 
­(Dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethylene). Although eventually 
the excess use of DDT as an agricultural pesticide would 
turn out to be an environmental hazard, its initial use in 
disease control was revolutionary. DDT allowed a break-
through in attempts to control one of the major killers of 
children in relatively poor parts of the world—malaria. 
­Finally, with the establishment and help of the World Health 
Organization (WHO), simple but effective medical and 
public health practices, such as oral rehydration and boil-
ing water to prevent cholera, spread to poorer countries.
LETTING THE DATA SPEAK
Life Expectancy and Innovation
Therefore, although not directly useful for closing the gap between wealthy nations and 
the rest of the world, continuing with the innovative agenda in the United States and Europe 
is an important weapon in the fight against international poverty.
In this and the previous chapter, we have focused on how physical capital, human capital, 
and technology determine the potential for economic growth and cross-country differences 
in GDP per capita. We have seen how an economy—rich or poor—can grow by investing 
more in physical capital, upgrading the human capital of its workforce, and improving its 
technology and efficiency of production. The natural question then is why many countries 
in the world do not pursue such improvements but remain poor or submit to low growth 
instead. This is the topic of our next chapter.

Chapter 21  |  Economic Growth
Summary
Many countries, including the United States, have experienced rapid 
economic growth over the last 200 years, increasing their GDP per capita several 
times over. For example, current U.S. GDP per capita is about 25 times U.S. 
GDP per capita in 1820. In addition, U.S. growth has been relatively sustained, 
meaning that GDP per capita has grown relatively steadily, with the exception 
of the Great Depression and the decade following it.
Economic growth can sometimes take place rapidly due to catch-up growth, 
whereby relatively poorer nations increase their GDP per capita by taking 
advantage of knowledge and technologies already invented in other, more 
advanced countries.
Economic growth results from an economy increasing its physical capital, 
raising the human capital of its workers (so that it has greater efficiency units of 
labor for a given size of the workforce), and improving its technology. Because 
of the diminishing marginal product of physical capital and limits to how much 
each worker can invest in his or her human capital before joining the workforce, 
sustained growth is generally impossible to achieve just by building up physical 
and human capital. Rather, the most plausible driver of sustained growth is 
technological progress. Empirical evidence also suggests that technological 
progress accounts for the bulk of the increase in GDP per capita (or per hour 
worked) in the United States.
Though the last 200 years have been characterized by sustained economic 
growth in many parts of the world, the preceding centuries did not experience 
steady growth. Instead, most economies during these times experienced 
Malthusian cycles: increases in GDP-fueled population growth, which reduced 
the standard of living and subsequently acted as a check on further population 
growth by reducing fertility and survival. The world broke out of the Malthusian 
cycle through the Industrial Revolution, which started a process of rapid 
technological progress, underpinning the sustained growth of the last two 
centuries.
Economic growth has the capacity to significantly reduce poverty, provided 
that such growth is not associated with much greater inequality.

were periods that experienced some increase in per capita 
income, sustained growth begins only in the mid-18th cen-
tury, and explodes after that—by the year 2000, income 
per capita is 12 times what it had been 250 years before.
Explain what accounts for such a dramatic change in 
economic growth beginning in the18th century.
	 6.	 Economists have long debated the causes of the slowdown 
in productivity (GDP per hour worked) in the United 
States during the 1970s and 1980s. This slowdown can be 
clearly seen in Exhibits 21.10 and 21.11.
	
a.	 Based on the data in Exhibit 21.10, is it physical capital, 
human capital, or technology that is most ­responsible 
for the overall decline in the annual growth rate of 
GDP per hour worked in these two decades? ­Explain 
your answer with reference to the exhibit.
	
b.	 An interesting study of the slowdown has been done 
by Yale economist William Nordhaus, which is sum-
marized at http://www.nber.org/digest/jun05/w10950​

reaches concerning the 1970s slowdown? Which indus-
tries were most affected by the slowdown, and why?
	 7.	 The concept of diminishing returns to a factor of produc-
tion applies not only to physical capital but to labor as well. 
Use the concept of diminishing returns to labor to explain 
and illustrate why there was no sustained growth in living 
­standards prior to the Industrial Revolution. Draw a graph 
to illustrate the relationship between population and GDP, 
where population is measured on the horizontal axis. Explain 
how your graph changes after the Industrial Revolution.
	 8.	 In 1968, Paul Ehrlich, a Stanford University professor, 
claimed that overpopulation would lead to famines and 
starvation in the 1970s and 1980s. In his book The Popu-
lation Bomb, he said that unless population growth was 
curbed, millions around the world would die. However, 
as we now know, this did not happen. What do you think 
was the flaw in Ehrlich’s argument?

sentation of statistics. Watch the brief video, and answer the 
following questions.
	
a.	 What was the upper limit on life expectancy in al-
most all countries in 1810? Which two countries were 
slightly better off?
	
b.	 Which countries failed to improve much in life 
­expectancy and income as a result of the Industrial 
Revolution?
	
c.	 As of 1948, had disparities in life expectancy and 
income between countries narrowed or widened? 
Which were some of the countries that had not made 
much improvement in either measure by 1948?
	
d.	 As of 2009, what was the general situation regarding 
the distribution of countries in terms of health and 
­income? What countries still lagged behind?
	
e.	 Based on the video, how can country averages dis-
guise the wide variation in living standards within a 
country? Give an example from the video.
	10.	 Suppose that a 10 percent increase in the physical capi-
tal stock increases GDP by 10 percent. Now consider 
an additional 10 percent increase in the physical capital 
stock. Will this increase GDP by less than 10 percent, 
10 ­percent, or more than 10 percent? Explain.
	11.	 Challenge Problem: Refer to Exhibit 21.4. If the United 
States, Mexico, China, Rwanda, and Haiti continue to 
grow at the rates given in the exhibit, how many years 
(starting from 2010) would it take each to catch up to the 
United States in terms of per capita GDP?

	
Appendix  |  The Solow Growth Model
541
Appendix
The Solow Growth Model
The main tool that economists use for formally studying how GDP is determined is the 
Solow model, named after the economist Robert Solow.5 In this appendix, we present the 
Solow model to show how it can be used to study the process of economic growth in 
greater detail. We have placed this material in the appendix rather than in the main body 
of the chapter because it can be skipped without interfering with the other key ideas in this 
­chapter and elsewhere in the book.
The Three Building Blocks of the Solow Model
The Solow model consists of three building blocks. The first one is the aggregate production 
function, which we saw in the previous chapter. Recall that the aggregate production func-
tion, Y = A × F(K, H), links GDP to physical capital (K), total efficiency units of ­labor (H), 
and the level of technology (A). Technology includes the knowledge available to the econ-
omy and the efficiency of production and is a shifter of the aggregate production function.
The second building block is an equation for physical capital accumulation. Most of the 
equipment and structures making up the physical capital stock of an economy are durable. 
When you purchase a computer, you will be using it for several years; many household 
­durables are typically used for much longer. Structures—buildings, roads, and bridges—
last even longer. But the durability of physical capital is not infinite. Physical capital is 
subject to depreciation, meaning that any equipment or structure goes through “wear and 
tear” and ultimately becomes obsolete. For example, when you buy a truck and use it for 
a year, it will have more miles and its brakes may be worn out. As a result of this wear 
and tear, some of its value will have been lost, and you will get quite a bit less if you try to 
sell it than you paid last year. Depreciation erodes the value of physical capital, but it can 
be slowed or reversed by continual investment and upkeep. In the case of your truck, you 
could also invest in it by having the brakes, oil, or tires changed. This type of investment 
counterbalances depreciation and increases the value of the truck.
The same is true for the physical capital stock of the economy, as captured by the 
­following physical capital accumulation equation:
Know = Klast year − Kdepreciated + I
or
Know = Klast year − (Depreciation rate × Klast year) + I
or
Know = (1 − d) × Klast year + I.
Know is the physical capital stock this year. This directly depends on the physical capital 
stock last year, Klast year, specifically the fraction 1 − d of that physical capital stock that 
doesn’t depreciate between the two dates. The remaining dKlast year is the equivalent of 
the decline in the value of your truck. In the meantime, the firms in the economy under-
take investments and purchase new machines to increase the physical capital stock of the 
economy, in the same way that you may have invested in new gadgets or maintenance to 
increase the value of your truck. In the above equation, this is represented by the invest-
ment amount I.
This equation is not only useful for the Solow growth model, but in fact is one of the 
key equations that economists use to compute the actual value of physical capital stock in 
practice, such as in national income accounts.

Appendix  |  The Solow Growth Model
The third building block of the Solow model is saving by households. Recall from our 
discussion in the body of this chapter that investment is determined by household saving 
behavior. Then investment in the economy will be
I = s × Y,
where, as you will recall, Y denotes GDP, s is the saving rate, and I is aggregate investment.
Now, using the first building block, the aggregate production function, we can write
I = s × Y = s × A × F(K, H).
This relationship is drawn in Exhibit 21A.1. The red curve represents the aggregate produc-
tion function, or more specifically the relationship between GDP and the physical capital 
stock for given levels of efficiency units of labor and technology. This shows the same shape 
as Exhibit 20.7 from the previous chapter. The green curve shows the relationship between 
the level of investment and the physical capital stock given the saving rate of households, s.  
It is simply given by a downward shift of the aggregate production ­function—because it 
represents GDP times the saving rate, s. By definition, therefore, the distance between the 
green curve and the horizontal axis at a given level of physical capital stock corresponds 
to aggregate saving or investment, as shown in the exhibit. Because the red curve repre-
sents GDP in the economy, as shown in the exhibit, the distance between the red and green 
curves represents consumption (since Y = C + I).
Steady-State Equilibrium in the Solow Model
A natural situation for us to study is one in which the physical capital stock last year and 
physical capital stock now are equal:
Know = Klast year = K.
We will refer to such a situation as a steady-state equilibrium, which is similar to our 
usual notion of equilibrium with supply being equal to demand but also requires that the 
physical capital stock is the same between the two dates.
This equation, combined with the physical capital accumulation equation above, 
­immediately implies that, in order for the physical capital stock to be unchanged between 
years, we need to have investment equal a fraction d of the physical capital stock, written 
as follows:
I = d × K.
Exhibit 21A.1 Aggregate 
Income and Aggregate Saving
The aggregate production 
­function shows how much GDP 
can be ­produced from a given 
amount of physical capital stock, 
total efficiency units of labor, and 
technology. In the exhibit, this is 
the length of the line ­between 
the aggregate ­production 
­function and the horizontal axis. 
This aggregate income is in turn 
divided between consumption 
and saving (we are ignoring 
government spending). Saving is 
also equal to investment in the 
aggregate.

A steady-state equilibrium is an 
economic equilibrium in which 
the physical capital stock remains 
constant over time.

	
Appendix  |  The Solow Growth Model
543
(To see how to derive this, note that in a steady state, the physical capital accumulation 
equation becomes K = (1 − d) × K + I, and solving this for I gives the desired equation).
In other words, for the physical capital stock of the economy to remain constant over 
time, the amount of investment must equal the depreciated value of the physical capital 
stock, which is the depreciation rate of the economy, d, times the physical capital stock, K. 
Returning to our example above, the value of your truck will remain constant only if the 
new investment you put in is equal exactly to the depreciation—the reduction in the value 
of the truck due to wear and tear.
We now put the different ingredients of the Solow model together to determine the 
steady-state equilibrium. This can be done in Exhibit 21A.2 by also plotting the line rep-
resenting the value of depreciated physical capital, d × K. The steady-state equilibrium is 
given by the intersection between this blue line and the green curve (which represents the 
investment level implied by the saving decisions of households). This follows simply be-
cause at this point of intersection, new investment—I = s × A × F(K, H)—is equal to the 
value of depreciated physical capital—d × K.
This exhibit shows that there is a unique point where the blue straight line intersects 
the green curve representing investment. This intersection is the steady-state equilibrium 
of the Solow model. It gives the steady-state equilibrium level of physical capital stock on 
the horizontal axis, marked K*, and the steady-state equilibrium GDP level on the vertical 
axis, Y*. The exhibit also shows the level of investment (saving) and the value of depreci-
ated physical capital, which equal each other by definition in a steady-state equilibrium, as 
well as the level of consumption in this equilibrium.
Once we have the steady-state equilibrium of the Solow model, we can use it to study 
the determinants of GDP.
Determinants of GDP
Exhibit 21A.2 makes it clear that one of the key determinants of GDP is the saving rate, 
as we discussed in the text. The impact of a higher saving rate on the steady-state physi-
cal capital stock and GDP can be seen in Exhibit 21A.3, where we drop the curve for the 
aggregate production function, A × F(K, H), and simply show the investment level given 
by I = s × A × F(K, H).
In this exhibit, we compare two economies that have access to the same aggregate pro-
duction function and have the same population and same efficiency units of labor, but 
have different saving rates. The economy with the higher saving rate, s′ > s, is depicted 
with the dark green curve, while the one with the lower saving rate, s, is shown with the 
Exhibit 21A.2 Steady-State 
Equilibrium in the Solow Model
The steady-state equilibrium in the 
Solow model is given as the point of 
intersection of the curve denoting total 
saving in the economy (as a function 
of the physical capital stock) and the 
line designating the amount of invest-
ment necessary to replenish depreci-
ated physical capital. In the exhibit, the 
steady-state equilibrium corresponds 
to the physical capital stock of K * and

Exhibit 21A.3 The Impact 
of the Saving Rate on the 
Steady-State Equilibrium
An increase in the saving rate 
rotates up the curve denoting 
total saving in the economy 
and increases the steady-state 
equilibrium physical capital 
stock and GDP level. In the 
­exhibit, the physical capital 
stock increases from K * to 
K ** and GDP from Y* to Y **.

light green curve. (By assumption, both economies have the same rate of depreciation, so 
the same line represents the value of depreciation). The exhibit shows that the economy with 
the higher saving rate will have a steady-state equilibrium to the right and above the original 
one. This corresponds to a greater physical capital stock and hence to greater GDP. Because 
population is kept constant in this exercise, this also translates into greater GDP per capita.
Both better technology and better human capital of workers also imply that the same 
amount of physical capital will translate to greater GDP. If the economy has workers that 
have better human capital, this will increase its efficiency units of labor, H, and given the 
increasing relationship between efficiency units of labor and GDP shown in Exhibit 20.8 
in the previous chapter, we will have greater GDP for a given level of physical capital 
stock. Therefore, in terms of the relationship between GDP and the physical capital stock, 
greater human capital of workers implies a shift of the aggregate production function. As 
a result, aggregate saving shifts to the curve drawn in dark green in Exhibit 21A.4, and the 
steady-state equilibrium will again be to the right and above the original one, as shown in 
the exhibit. This implies that higher human capital leads to both higher steady-state equi-
librium physical capital stock and higher GDP for the country. Because there has not been 
any change in the population (or working-age population), the higher GDP again translates 
into higher GDP per capita.
Exactly the same analysis applies to technology. Recall that better technology corre-
sponds to higher A in terms of our aggregate production function. It can be the result of 
better knowledge being used in production or of greater efficiency of production. In either 
case, it will lead to a shift in the aggregate production function that is identical to that in 
Exhibit 21A.3 (except that it is now the total efficiency units of labor, not the saving rate, 
that is changing). Consequently, the implications are also identical. There will be a higher 
steady-state equilibrium level of physical capital stock and a greater steady-state equilibrium 
level of GDP. Because population is again constant, this will imply greater GDP per capita.
Dynamic Equilibrium in the Solow Model
The Solow model is not only useful for understanding the determinants of steady-state equi-
librium but is also the main vehicle that economists use for thinking about economic growth.
As the qualifier “steady-state” hints, we can also imagine an equilibrium that is not a 
steady-state equilibrium. Such an equilibrium, often referred to as a dynamic equilibrium, 
traces out the behavior of the economy over time. As such, a dynamic equilibrium doesn’t 
correspond to a single point, but to a path (of physical capital stock and GDP levels) that 
will be realized over time.
A dynamic equilibrium traces out 
the behavior of the economy over 
time.

	
Appendix  |  The Solow Growth Model

Exhibit 21A.4 Change in the 
Steady-State Equilibrium 
Resulting from an Increase 
in the Human Capital of 
Workers
When the human capital of 
workers increases, so does 
the total efficiency units of 
labor. This implies that the 
economy can produce more 
with the same physical capi-
tal stock and technology, so 
the curve for the aggregate 
production function shifts up. 
This leads to a new steady-
state equilibrium with higher 
physical capital stock and 
GDP. In particular, the physical 
capital stock increases from 
K * to K ** and GDP from  
Y * to Y **.
To understand this notion, let us look at Exhibit 21A.5, which is the same as  
Exhibit 21A.2 except without the curve for A × F(K, H). The steady-state equilibrium 
again occurs at the point where the blue straight line intersects the curve representing the 
­investment level; thus K* is the physical capital stock and Y* is GDP in this steady-state 
equilibrium.
Now imagine that, starting from K*, suddenly some of the physical capital in this econ-
omy is destroyed, for example, because of war. As a result, the physical capital stock of the 
economy is now represented by K0 < K*. Suppose also that nothing else changes; in par-
ticular, the aggregate production function, the saving rate, the efficiency units of labor, and 
technology all remain the same. At this point, even though just one variable has changed, 
we are no longer in a steady-state equilibrium because physical capital is no longer being 
replenished precisely at the rate at which it is depreciating.
What will the level of production in the economy be now? Because the physical capi-
tal stock is now equal to K0 but the efficiency units of labor have not changed, GDP will 
continue to be given by the aggregate production function at Y0 (and corresponds to the 
point marked as s × Y0 on the vertical axis in Exhibit 21A.5). However, this exhibit also 
makes it clear that at this new point (K0, Y0), the economy is above the straight line. Recall 
that, along this straight line, investment is just equal to the amount of depreciated physical 
capital. Above it, investment does not just make up for depreciated physical capital, but ex-
ceeds it. Recall now the physical capital accumulation equation, which tells us that Know = 
Klast year − Kdepreciated + I. This equation implies that, as investment exceeds depreciated 
physical capital, we have I > Kdepreciated, and thus the physical capital stock will increase. Put 
differently, there will be a dynamic equilibrium path that takes us back toward the steady-
state equilibrium at K*. The dynamic equilibrium path is shown in Exhibit 21A.5 by the 
green arrows. It starts at (K0, Y0) and traces out the path of the economy toward (K*, Y*). 
This highlights both the fact that a dynamic equilibrium corresponds to a path showing the 
behavior of the economy over time and also the key result that such a dynamic equilibrium 
will take the economy back toward the steady-state equilibrium (K*, Y*).
Sources of Growth in the Solow Model
We can now use the Solow model to return to the discussion of sustained growth in the 
text. First, Exhibit 21A.6 demonstrates that increases in the saving rate and physical 
capital accumulation cannot be the source of sustained growth. It shows that, with given 
levels of total efficiency units of labor and technology, there is a maximum amount of

the Solow Model
Suppose the economy starts with a 
physical capital stock of K0 < K*, that 
is, with a physical capital stock less 
than the steady-state equilibrium. 
What happens? The exhibit shows 
that at this point, saving and invest-
ment are greater than the amount 
of physical capital that depreciates, 
so the physical capital stock increases. 
This dynamic process takes us to the

economy cannot expand with a given aggregate production function and total efficiency 
units of labor.
The presence of such a maximal level of GDP, YMAX, implies that sustained growth is not 
possible by just increasing saving. To see this, note that if an economy grows at a constant

saving more.

Exhibit 21A.7 Sustained 
Growth Driven by 
Technological Change
Technological progress is 
at the root of sustained 
growth in the Solow 
model. As technology 
improves, the aggregate 
production function 
shifts up, and equilibrium 
­physical capital stock and 
GDP increase gradually.

rate, such as 2 percent per year, it will eventually reach and exceed any fixed level of GDP, 
such as YMAX. This is consistent with historical evidence. Over the past 200 years, coun-
tries have not achieved steady growth by simply increasing their saving rates. Overall, this 
discussion and Exhibit 21A.6 show that increases in the saving rate can increase GDP, but 
they cannot generate sustained growth.
To show how technological improvements can lead to sustained growth in the Solow 
model, Exhibit 21A.7 revisits our by-now familiar figure for the determination of the 
steady-state equilibrium. It shows that as technology improves, the aggregate production 
function (and consequently the investment curve) shifts up. This raises the equilibrium 
levels of physical capital stock and GDP.
Notably, these improvements take place along the straight line of the steady state as 
shown in the exhibit. Recall that the straight line is given by the equation d × K and does 
not shift as a result of technological improvements.
At each point of intersection, we have s × Y = d × K. Rewriting this gives K/Y = s/d, 
which thus implies that throughout there is a constant ratio of the physical capital stock to 
GDP. Therefore, the implication of the Solow model for sustained growth is that the ratio 
of the physical capital stock to GDP should be constant as the economy grows.
Exhibit 21A.8 plots the historical evolution of the value of the physical capital stock 
to GDP in the U.S. economy. The ratio of the physical capital stock to GDP is roughly 
constant over the last 50 years, with a value of about 2. This pattern is consistent with 
the implication of the Solow model based on sustained growth driven by technological 
­improvements, which, as we just saw, also implies a constant ratio of physical capital stock 
to GDP as the economy grows.
What about catch-up growth? In contrast to sustained growth, catch-up growth can 
result both from the accumulation of physical capital and human capital and from techno-
logical change. The nature of catch-up growth can be illustrated by the dynamic equilib-
rium path of an economy starting with a level of physical capital stock such as K0 below 
its steady-state equilibrium K*, as depicted in Exhibit 21A.5. This dynamic equilibrium 
path represents the growth trajectory of an economy that is temporarily below its steady-
state equilibrium or improves its technology and thus raises its steady-state equilibrium 
level of physical capital stock and GDP. This exhibit thus shows that, typically, such 
an economy will rapidly grow toward its steady-state equilibrium. Such rapid growth 
is a hallmark of the catch-up process as shown by the experiences of several countries 
­depicted in Exhibits 21.4, 21.5, and 21.8.

Appendix  |  The Solow Growth Model
Calculating Average (Compound) Growth Rates
Now let’s discuss how to calculate average growth rates by returning to Exhibit 21.4. Con-
sider the United States. Its GDP per capita was $15,398 in 1960 and $41,365 in 2010 
(in PPP-adjusted 2005 constant dollars). We can now compute the 50-year growth rate 
(between 1960 and 2010) as 168.64 percent, using the formula provided in the text. In 
particular, this number is obtained as
 41,365 - 15,398
15,398
= 1.6864,
corresponding to 168.64 percent growth.
One way of computing the average growth rate is to use the arithmetic average and di-
vide this number by 50 to obtain the average annual growth rate. This would give an annual 
growth rate of 3.4 percent. The number in Exhibit 21.4 is different—2.00 percent. How is 
this number obtained, and why is it different?
The answer to this question is related to the importance of the exponential nature of 
growth, which we discussed earlier in the chapter. Suppose that an economy grows at the 
rate of g = 0.034 (that is, 3.4 percent) every year for 50 years. How much will its GDP 
per capita have gone up at the end of the 50 years? To compute this, we have to note that 
after one year its GDP per capita will have increased by 1+ g. From the second to the third 
year, it will increase by another 1+ g, so between the first and third years, it will have gone 
up by (1+ g)2. Continuing with this reasoning, at the end of 50 years, its GDP per capita 
will have increased by (1 + g)50. If we take g = 0.034, we find that its GDP per capita 
will be 5.32 times higher at the end of the 50 years, which is considerably greater than the 
numbers for the United States. Instead, these numbers imply that at the end of the 50 years, 
U.S. GDP per capita was about 2.6864 times higher. (This number can be obtained simply 
as 41,365/15,398 = 2.6864, that is, GDP per capita in 2010 divided by GDP per capita in 
1960, or you can note that it is 1 + 1.6864, where 168.64 percent was the growth rate of 
the U.S. economy between 1960 and 2010.)
By dividing the total growth between 1960 and 2010 by 50, we have ignored the cu-
mulative effects of growth and overestimated the annual growth rate that would lead to the 
observed increase in GDP per capita.

This discussion also indicates that a more sophisticated way of computing the average 
annual growth rate is by using the geometric average. In this case, we would calculate the 
growth rate as
(1 + g)50 = 2.6864.
We can then use this equation to arrive at the correct average annual growth rate, g. 
(More technically, we would invert this equation and compute g = 2.68641/50 − 1.) This 
approximately gives the (average) annual growth rate as g = 0.020, as recorded in the 
exhibit. In most cases, using either the arithmetic or the geometric average to compute 
average growth rates gives similar answers, provided that we are looking at short periods. 
The reason why there is a sizable difference in this case is because we are considering a 
long period of time.

If you look back at the map of GDP per capita of the world shown in ­Exhibit 20.2 
in Chapter 20, you will notice a striking regularity: many of the ­poorest nations 
are close to the equator in the tropical and semitropical ­areas of the world. 
­Conversely, countries in the temperate areas away from the ­equator are much 
more prosperous. The Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, is cut in 
the middle by the equator. In 2010, its GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing 
power was $241 (in 2005 constant dollars). Move up along the map all the way 
to the sixtieth parallel, and you will find Finland. In that same year, its GDP per 
capita was $32,989 (in 2005 constant dollars). You can do the same ­exercise for 
almost all countries around the equator. Move up the line of longitude to find the 
corresponding countries at the fortieth, fiftieth, or sixtieth ­parallels, and ­almost 
always you will see that the ones further away from the equator are considerably 
richer than the ones nearest it. This pattern has led many social scientists to con-
jecture that there is something particularly pernicious about the economic and

KEY IDEAS
Proximate causes of prosperity link prosperity and poverty of nations to 
the levels of inputs, while fundamental causes look for reasons why there are 
such differences in the levels of inputs.
The geography, culture, and institutions hypotheses advance different 
fundamental causes of prosperity.
Inclusive and extractive economic institutions affect economic 
development.
Creative destruction is integral to economic growth through 
technological change.
Reversal of fortune evidence provides support for the institutions

social conditions in the areas around the equator. Many have gone so far as to as-
sert that tropical and semitropical areas condemn a nation to poverty.
Can this be true? Can geography determine a nation’s prosperity? By the end 
of this chapter, we provide some answers to this intriguing question. We’ll also have 
developed a much better understanding of why the whole world isn’t developed, 
and why there are wide disparities in GDP per capita across countries.
In Chapter 20, we documented the huge differences in GDP per capita and living standards 
across countries. You may recall the huge gap in GDP per capita between the United States 
and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, or Haiti. In that chapter, we emphasized 
how these gaps can be explained in terms of cross-country differences in physical capital, 
human capital, and technology.
Yet an explanation based on these causes alone immediately begs the question of why 
some countries have accumulated more physical capital, invested more in human capital, 
and developed and adopted better technologies than other countries. After all, if investing 
in physical and human capital and adopting cutting-edge technologies can lead to major 
improvements in GDP, wouldn’t all countries in the world wish to do so? Why isn’t the 
whole world as developed as the United States or West European nations?
These deeper questions make us realize that differences in physical capital, human capital, 
and technology are only proximate causes of economic performance. We call them proximate 
causes of prosperity because they link high levels of prosperity to high levels of the inputs to 
production, but without providing an explanation for why the levels of those inputs are high.
To get at the reasons why some countries are either unable or unwilling to invest in dif-
ferent amounts of physical capital, human capital, and technology, we have to dig deeper. 
Causation can be complex, as we discussed in Chapter 2. We sometimes have to see what lies 
beneath the surface to understand the true causes of an observed phenomenon. We refer to 
these ­underlying factors as the fundamental causes of prosperity, which are defined as those 
causes that are at the root of the differences in the proximate causes of prosperity. The relation-
ship between the fundamental and the proximate causes of prosperity is shown in Exhibit 22.1.
Proximate Versus Fundamental 
Causes of Prosperity
22.1 
Proximate causes of prosperity 
are high levels of factors such as 
human capital, physical capital, and 
technology that result in a high level 
of GDP per capita.
Fundamental causes of prosperity 
are factors that are at the root of the 
differences in the proximate causes 
of prosperity.

22.1
To see the distinction between proximate and fundamental causes more clearly, it is useful 
to consider an analogy. Say you are experiencing some symptoms of flu—sore throat, fever, 
and headache—that might motivate you to take drugs, such as throat decongestants or aspirin. 
In this example, the proximate cause of why you take these drugs is that you have a sore throat, a 
high fever, and a headache. But the fundamental cause—the reason why you have the symptoms 
in the first place—is that you have the flu. The flu thus induces both the symptoms and your 
response of taking drugs. Similarly, if a country underinvests in human capital, physical capital, 
and/or technology, we should ask why. Both proximate and fundamental causes have to be 
considered for a complete understanding of why some nations are prosperous and others aren’t.
Although there are many different theories about the fundamental causes of poverty and 
prosperity—theories about why poorer nations around the world have worse technologies 
and do not invest in physical and human capital as much as rich ones—it is useful to classify 
them into three categories: theories of geography, culture, and institutions. We next describe 
these hypotheses and then discuss whether they are consistent with empirical evidence.
Geography
One approach, which we will refer to as the geography hypothesis, claims that differences 
in geography, climate, and ecology ultimately determine the large differences in prosperity 
across the world. According to this hypothesis, some countries have highly unfavorable 
geographical, climactic, or ecological circumstances that are outside of their control. Some 
are situated in areas where much of the soil may be inhospitable for agriculture, daytime 
temperatures are very high, or a lack of navigable rivers makes transport prohibitively 
costly. These conditions, some argue, make it impossible or unlikely for such countries to 
accumulate or effectively use the factors of production.
Many leading thinkers throughout the ages have advocated the geography hypothesis. 
One of its great proponents was the famous French philosopher Montesquieu, who argued 
that climate was a key determinant of work effort and thus prosperity.1 He wrote:
The heat of the climate can be so excessive that the body there will be absolutely 
without strength. So, prostration will pass even to the spirit; no curiosity, no noble 
enterprise, no generous sentiment; inclinations will all be passive there; laziness there 
will be happiness. . . . People are . . . more vigorous in cold climates. The inhabitants 
of warm ­countries are, like old men, timorous; the people in cold countries are, like 
young men, brave.
Another major proponent of this view was Alfred Marshall, who was the first economist to 
write a book (just like ours) aimed at making the principles of economics accessible to a 
broad population of students.2 He stated:
Vigor depends partly on race qualities: but these, so far as they can be explained at all, 
seem to be chiefly due to climate.
These views emphasizing the effect of climate on work effort and vigor are outdated 
(and sometimes tinged with racist overtones). But other versions of the geography hypoth-
esis are still popular. Today, many believe that geographic characteristics determine the 
The geography hypothesis claims 
that differences in geography, climate, 
and ecology are ultimately responsible 
for the major differences in prosperity 
observed across the world.
Exhibit 22.1 Fundamental and Proximate  
Causes of Prosperity
Societies become prosperous when they have 
abundant human and physical capital and use 
advanced technology efficiently in production. 
But these are proximate causes because they 
are in turn shaped by other, deeper factors. 
­Fundamental causes, such as geographic, ­cultural, 
and institutional factors, have an impact on 
prosperity by affecting proximate causes such as 
investment in human capital, physical capital, and 
technology.

technology available to a society, especially in agriculture. The economist Jeffrey Sachs 
has been a strong proponent of this view in his academic writings.3 Using it as the basis of 
his influential policy recommendations to the United Nations and the World Health Orga-
nization, Sachs, for example, argues:
By the start of the era of modern economic growth, if not much earlier, temperate-zone 
technologies were more productive than tropical-zone technologies. . . .
Jeffrey Sachs and others also argue that many parts of the world, 
particularly sub-Saharan Africa, are disadvantaged economically 
because infectious diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, 
spread there more easily. When it is serious and widespread, an 
illness can indeed destroy a large amount of a country’s human 
capital.
If geography is the major fundamental cause of prosperity  
(or its absence), then the poor nations of the world have little rea-
son to expect much improvement in living standards. They are 
permanently disadvantaged, and we should not expect them to 
catch up with the rest of the world and become economically de-
veloped anytime soon—or so the thinking goes.
Not all variations of the geography hypothesis are equally pessimistic. In some, large-
scale investments in transport technology or disease eradication may partially redress these 
geographic disadvantages.
Culture
Another potential fundamental cause of differences in economic performance has to do with 
cultural differences. According to the culture hypothesis, different societies respond differ-
ently to incentives because of specific shared experiences, religious teachings, the strength of 
family ties, or unspoken social norms. Culture is viewed as a key determinant of the values, 
preferences, and beliefs of individuals and societies and, the argument goes, these differences 
play a key role in shaping economic performance. For example, some societies may have 
values that encourage investment, hard work, and the adoption of new technologies, while 
others may nurture superstition and suspicion of new technologies and discourage hard work.
The most famous link between culture and economic development was proposed by the 
German sociologist Max Weber, who argued that the origins of industrialization in Western 
Europe could be traced to Protestantism.4 In his view, the Protestant worldview was crucial 
to the development of a market economy and economic growth because it encouraged hard 
work and saving (and thus investment).
Another common version of the culture hypothesis contrasts the Anglo-Saxon culture 
of the United States and the United Kingdom, which is viewed as conducive to investment 
and the adoption of technology, with the supposedly less dynamic and more closed-minded 
Iberian culture of peoples with Spanish and Portuguese origins. Many social scientists 
have attempted to explain the contrast between North and South America in these terms.
Almost 20 years ago, the Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington coined the term 
“clash of civilizations” to capture what he thought would be the defining conflict of the 
twenty-first century—the conflict between the West and Islam.5 More broadly, Huntington 
has supported the view that culture plays a central role in shaping prosperity. For example, 
his explanation for why South Korea grew rapidly in the twentieth century and Ghana did 
not summarizes his overall approach:6
Culture had to be a large part of the explanation. South Koreans valued thrift, investment, 
hard work, education, organization, and discipline. Ghanaians had different values.
Of course, a society’s culture is not immutable: cultures change, though they do so slowly.
Institutions
A third potential fundamental cause for the differences in prosperity involves institutions, 
the formal and informal rules governing the organization of a society, including its laws and 
regulations. For example, economic historian Douglass North, who was awarded the Nobel 
If geography is the major 
­fundamental cause of ­prosperity 
(or its absence), then the poor 
­nations of the world have little 
­reason to expect much improvement 
in living standards.
The culture hypothesis claims that 
different values and cultural beliefs 
fundamentally cause the differences 
in prosperity around the world.
Institutions are the formal and 
informal rules governing the 
organization of a society, including 
its laws and regulations.

Chapter 22  |  Why Isn’t the Whole World Developed?
Prize in economics largely because of his work emphasizing the importance of institutions 
in the historical development process, offers the following definition of institutions:7
Institutions are the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly 
devised constraints that shape human interaction.
This definition captures three important elements that define institutions:
	
1.	 They are determined by individuals as members of a society.
	
2.	 They place constraints on behavior.
	
3.	 They shape behavior by determining incentives.
First, institutions are “humanly devised.” In contrast to geography, which is largely out-
side of human control, and culture, which changes very slowly, institutions are determined 
by man-made factors. That is, institutions do not just appear out of thin air, but develop due 
to the choices members of a society make over how to organize their interactions.
Second, institutions place constraints on individual behavior. On the positive side, insti-
tutions constrain the ability of an individual to steal from others or to walk away from debts 
that he has built up. On the negative side, they might prevent people from entering into 
occupations or opening new businesses. Such constraints need not be absolute. Individuals 
around the world break laws and skirt regulations every day. For example, Apple did not 
own a license to sell iPads in Taiwan in 2010, so selling the device was illegal. Through 
online auctions, however, people were able to purchase iPad cases for more than $1,000, 
which happened to include a “free” iPad.8
Policies, regulations, and laws that punish or reward certain types of behavior will natu-
rally have an effect on behavior. Though some citizens can circumvent a law that bans, for 
example, the adoption of certain technologies, such a law still discourages their adoption.
This observation leads us to the third important element in North’s definition—­institutions 
affect incentives. The constraints that institutions place on individuals—whether formal 
constraints such as banning certain activities or informal ones discouraging certain types of 
­behavior through customs and social norms—shape human interaction and affect incentives. 
In some sense, institutions, much more than the other candidate fundamental causes, are about 
the importance of incentives.
The institutions hypothesis maintains that the differences in the way that humans have 
chosen to organize their societies—differences that shape the incentives that individuals and 
businesses in the society face—are at the root of the differences in their relative prosperity. For 
example, when markets allocate individuals to the occupations in which their productivity is 
highest, laws and regulations encourage firms to invest in physical capital and technology and 
the educational system enables and encourages people to invest in their human capital, the 
economy will generate higher GDP and achieve greater prosperity than when its institutions 
fail to do so.
To sum up, the institutions hypothesis relies on the following chain of reasoning:
	
1.	 Different societies typically have different institutions.
	
2.	 These different institutions create different types of incentives.
	
3.	 The incentives help determine the degree to which societies accumulate the factors 
of production and adopt new technology.
The idea that the prosperity of a society depends on its institutions is not a new one. 
It goes back at least to Adam Smith, the father of economics, who, in The Wealth of ­Nations, 
emphasized the importance of markets in generating prosperity through the workings of the 
invisible hand and warned how constraints on markets—for example, in the form of restric-
tions on trade—could destroy such prosperity.9
A Natural Experiment of History
The Korean peninsula is divided in two by the thirty-eighth parallel. To the south is the 
Republic of Korea, also known as South Korea. We saw in Chapter 21 how South Korea 
has had one of the fastest-growing economies in the last 60 years and has by now achieved 
living standards comparable to many countries in Europe.
To the north of the thirty-eighth parallel there is another Korea: the Democratic ­People’s 
­Republic of Korea, or simply North Korea. Living standards in North Korea are similar 
to those in a sub-Saharan African country. The best estimate suggests that in 2010 GDP 
per capita (in PPP-adjusted 2005 constant dollars) was $1,612 in the North, making its 
The institutions hypothesis claims 
that differences in institutions—that 
is, in the way societies have organized 
themselves and shaped the incentives 
of individuals and businesses—are 
at the root of the differences in 
prosperity across the world.

inhabitants worse off than the citizens of Sudan or Yemen. In contrast, in that same year 
GDP per capita (in PPP-­adjusted 2005 constant dollars) in the South was $26,609. What 
­explains these large differences? Could it be geography? Culture? Highly unlikely. The 
North and South share the same geography, essentially the same climate, the same access 
to the ocean, and the same disease environments. There are also no noticeable differences 
between their cultures, certainly not before 1947 when the country was split into two. 
­Korea was at that point an unusually homogeneous country, both ethnically and cultur-
ally. If we were to believe that geography or culture were important factors in determining 
South Korea’s economic development after 1947, we would then expect a similar process 
of economic development in North Korea. Nothing of the sort happened.
In fact, the great disparities between the two nations did not exist before World War II 
when the two parts of Korea were united. They emerged only when the two were separated 
and adopted very different institutions.
The separation of Korea into two halves was not something to which its citizens willingly 
agreed. It was an outcome of a geopolitical deal between the Soviet Union and the United States, 
who agreed at the end of World War II that the thirty-eighth parallel would be the dividing line for 
their spheres of influence in Korea and set up different governments in the North and the South.
These governments adopted very different ways of organizing their economies. In North 
Korea, Kim Il-Sung, a leader of anti-Japanese communist partisans during World War II, 
established himself as dictator. With the help of the Soviet Union, Kim Il-Sung introduced 
a rigid form of communism, the Juche system. Resources in North Korea were ­allocated 
through central planning, private property was outlawed, and markets were banned. ­Freedoms 
were curtailed not only in the marketplace but also in every sphere of North ­Koreans’ lives—
except for those that happened to be part of the very small ruling elite around Kim Il-Sung. 
This cronyism persisted under his son Kim Jong-Il, who ruled until his death in 2011, and 
continues today under Kim Il-Sung’s grandson, Kim Jong-Un.
In the South, institutions were shaped by the Harvard- and 
Princeton-educated, staunchly anti-communist Syngman Rhee, 
with significant support from the United States. Though Rhee 
and his successor, General Park Chung-hee, were autocrats, they 
supported a market-based economy, providing incentives to busi-
nesses for investment and industrialization and investing in the 
education of South Koreans. South Korea did eventually become 
democratic in the 1990s and further liberalized its economy.
If institutions are a major determinant of economic prosperity, 
then the sharply divergent institutions of the two Koreas should 
have led to divergent economic fortunes. And that’s exactly what 
happened. Exhibit 22.2 shows how GDP per capita in North and 
If institutions are a major determi-
nant of economic prosperity, then 
the sharply divergent institutions of 
the two Koreas should have led to 
divergent economic fortunes. And 
that’s exactly what happened.

and South Korea (in PPP-adjusted 2005

The economic fortunes of North and South 
­Korea, starting from parity in the 1940s when 
they were united, have diverged sharply. South 
Korea, with institutions mostly based on a 
­market economy, has reached a high level of 
GDP per capita. In contrast, North Korea, under 
a communist dictatorship, has failed to grow 
and has less than 1/16th of the level of the GDP 
per capita of the South.

Private property rights mean that 
individuals can own businesses and 
assets and their ownership is secure.
Economic institutions are the 
aspects of the society’s rules that 
concern economic transactions.
Teenagers in South Korea grow up just like us. Many obtain a good education, and face incen-
tives that encourage them to exert effort and excel in their chosen vocation. South Korea is 
a market economy. South Korean teenagers know that, if successful, one day they can enjoy 
the fruits of their investments and efforts. They can buy computers, clothes, cars, houses, and 
healthcare. They can start businesses and bequeath their property to their offspring.
This is in large part because the South has well-enforced private property rights, 
meaning that its citizens can hold property like businesses, houses, cars, and many other 
things without fearing that the government or anyone else will arbitrarily take it away. Just 
as in the United States, if you own a business in South Korea, you know that the income 
it generates is yours, other than the taxes you pay, which are often used to provide public 
goods and services valued by the citizens of the country. Your property is well protected 
because the state upholds law and order, and if you write business contracts, the courts 
enforce them. It is possible for entrepreneurs to borrow money from banks and financial 
markets, for foreign companies to enter into partnerships with South Korean firms, and for 
individuals to obtain mortgages to buy houses.
Teenagers in North Korea face vastly different lives from those in the South. They grow 
up in poverty, without high-quality education to prepare them for skilled work or entrepre-
neurship. Much of the education they receive at school is pure propaganda about foreign 
threats against North Korea and the benevolent leadership of their supreme leader and the 
North Korean military. But these teenagers know that they will not be able to own property, 
start businesses, or make much money because there is no private property in North Korea. 
They also know that they will not have access to markets where they can deploy their skills 
or use their earnings to purchase the goods that they need and desire.
These different rules are part of the institutions under which North and South Koreans live.
Inclusive and Extractive Economic Institutions
The enforcement of private property rights, which differs so sharply between South 
and North Korea, is one aspect of what we refer to as economic institutions. Economic 
­institutions are those aspects of a society’s rules that concern economic transactions. 
­Besides the protection of property rights, economic institutions include such things as the 
functioning and impartiality of the judicial system, the financial arrangements that deter-
mine how individuals and businesses can borrow money, and the regulations that shape 
how costly it is to enter into a new line of business or a new occupation.
When a society’s economic institutions provide secure property rights, set up a judicial 
system that enforces contracts and upholds the law, allow private parties to sign contracts 
for economic or financial transactions, maintain relatively open and free entry into dif-
ferent businesses and occupations, and enable people to acquire the education and skills

South Korea has sharply diverged over the last 60 years to arrive at the great disparities that 
we observe today.
The Korean case depicts what we often call a natural experiment or an experiment of 
history. A country was split in half by a military outcome. The two newly formed, cultur-
ally identical, and geographically similar countries proceeded to develop very different 
institutions. While the South remained a market economy, the North adopted a very rigid 
form of communist rule with little room for markets, private property, or entrepreneurship. 
The reason this episode approximates a natural experiment is that while institutions were 
changing in this radical way, geography and culture remained largely unchanged. It was 
the changes in institutions that led to massive changes in economic prosperity, as shown in 
­Exhibit 22.2. The Korean example thus provides strong support for the institutions hypoth-
esis (but it does not provide direct evidence against geography and culture because these 
were held fixed in this comparison).
Darkness in North Korea and 
light in South Korea: lights at

ences in prosperity between 
South and North Korea.

to take part in such businesses and occupations, we say that they are inclusive economic 
­institutions. The economic institutions in South Korea approximate these types of inclu-
sive economic institutions. They are inclusive in the sense that they encourage the par-
ticipation of the great majority of the population in economic activities in a way that best 
makes use of their talents and skills.
As we have seen, inclusive economic institutions do not describe the situation in North 
Korea. Economic institutions to the north of the thirty-eighth parallel fail to enforce prop-
erty rights or contracts, erect prohibitive entry barriers, and all but destroy the workings 
of the markets. We refer to such arrangements as extractive economic institutions. This 
terminology stems from the fact that such institutions are often shaped by those who con-
trol political power to extract resources from the rest of the society. Extractive economic 
institutions are not just associated with communist North Korea. Societies ruled by mon-
archs, dictators, and juntas as well as several that hold elections for their ­parliaments and 
presidents have had, and still have, extractive ­economic institutions. In fact, most societies 
throughout history have had ­economic institutions that are closer to the extreme extractive 
­economic institutions of North Korea than to the ideal of inclusive ­economic institutions 
we have defined here.
Examples of market economics that have extractive ­economic institutions ­include for-
mer Soviet republics, such as ­Azerbaijan, ­Turkmenistan and ­Uzbekistan, Myanmar, and 
Pakistan in Asia, ­Argentina, ­Guatemala, and Peru in Latin America, and the Democratic 
­Republic of Congo, Egypt, and Kenya in Africa. Even if the specific forms of these insti-
tutions differ from the extreme form of central planning in North Korea, they share the 
fact that they fail to enforce property rights and instead privilege a few at the expense of 
the many.
Extractive economic institutions do not exist in a vacuum. It is no ­accident that North 
Korea is a repressive dictatorship. Without the ­political elite’s tight control of the state, 
North Korea would not be able to maintain a system that condemns tens of millions to 
poverty. This meshing of political and economic power underscores the important role 
of political institutions, which determine who holds political power and what types of 
constraints exist on the exercise of that power. Extractive economic institutions tend to be 
supported by certain types of political institutions, which concentrate political power in 
the hands of the ­political elite and put little constraint on how political power can be used. 
Similarly, inclusive economic institutions tend to coexist with different types of ­political 
institutions, which tend to distribute political power more equally in society so that no sin-
gle individual or group is able to use that political power for its own benefit at the ­expense 
of the rest of society.
How Economic Institutions Affect 
Economic Outcomes
The contrast between South Korea and North Korea, and between 
­Austria and Czechoslovakia discussed in the next Letting the Data 
Speak box, illustrates a general principle: inclusive economic insti-
tutions foster economic activity, productivity growth, and economic 
prosperity, while extractive economic institutions generally fail to do 
so.10 Property rights are central to this principle ­because only those 
who have secure property rights will be willing to invest and increase 
productivity. A farmer who expects his output to be ­expropriated—
meaning stolen, taken away, or entirely taxed away—will have little 
incentive to work, let alone any incentive to undertake investments 
and innovations. ­Extractive economic institutions distort incentives 
in exactly this fashion. Farmers, traders, businessmen, and workers 
will be discouraged from investing and producing when they have 
no property rights. On top of that, firms will not be able to form 
the trust-based ­relationships that are necessary to productively do 
business when private contracts are worth little more than the paper 
they are written on or when some contractual agreements are banned 
outright. Finally, because they erect market entry barriers rather  
Inclusive economic institutions 
protect private property, uphold law 
and order, allow and enforce private 
contracts, and allow free entry into 
new lines of business and occupations.
Extractive economic institutions do 
not protect private property rights, 
do not uphold contracts, and interfere 
with the workings of markets. They 
also erect significant entry barriers 
into businesses and occupations.
Political institutions are the aspects 
of the society’s rules that concern 
the allocation of political power and 
the constraints on the exercise of 
political power.

than create an environment that would encourage entry, ­extractive economic institutions 
tend to support inefficient firms and prevent entrepreneurs with new ideas from entering 
into the right lines of business and workers from working in occupations to which their 
skills are best suited.
Exhibit 22.4 is helpful for illustrating why extractive economic institutions discourage 
economic activity. There, in a hypothetical economy, we rank potential entrepreneurs in 
descending order according to the return they will make if they enter and start a business. 
Between 1948 and 1989, citizens of Central and Eastern 
European countries, just like those of North Korea, lived 
under a communist dictatorship. Large, state-owned 
­enterprises were the norm in these economies. These 
firms did not compete in the market but instead worked 
toward arbitrary targets set by Communist Party officials 
(which they almost always failed to meet). As a conse-
quence, shortages of food and consumer goods were 
common. In a market economy, companies that fail to 
motivate workers, produce goods of reasonable quality, 
or meet their production targets are ultimately driven 
out of the market. But state-owned enterprises under 
communism did not have to worry about competition or 
about being driven out of the market, because there was 
no competition, and it was the state that set prices and 
footed the bill if these enterprises lost money.
In 1948, Austria and Czechoslovakia, two neighbors in 
central Europe, each had GDP per capita of about $4,000. 
But in Czechoslovakia, farms were subsequently taken 
forcibly from their owners and collectivized, a command 
economy was established, and political freedoms that 
­existed before World War II were abolished. In Austria, 
a market system, along with economic institutions much 
more inclusive than those in communist ­Eastern ­Europe, 
flourished. The consequences were similar to what we 
have seen in the case of North and South Korea. Not 
­surprisingly, Czechoslovakia kept falling ­behind its neigh-
bor, Austria, for 40 years.
The two countries, which had very similar histories, 
geographies, and cultures, had achieved vastly different 
levels of prosperity by 1989 when the communist regime 
finally collapsed. Those Central and Eastern ­European 
­societies that had been under communist rule transitioned 
to democracy and a market economy, became more in-
clusive, and started to grow rapidly as the share of the 
private sector in the economy increased from 5 percent to 
80 percent. Exhibit 22.3 shows the divergence between 
Austria and Czechoslovakia during the communist period 
and the convergence that started after Czechoslovakia 
transitioned to a market economy in the 1990s.

Exhibit 22.4 How  
Extractive Economic 
Institutions Reduce the 
Number of Entrepreneurs
Panel (a): The return-to-
entrepreneurship curve 
shows the number of 
­entrepreneurs with at 
least the return indicated 
on the vertical axis. It 
is obtained by ranking 
potential entrepreneurs 
from higher to lower return 
to entrepreneurship. The 
opportunity cost schedule 
indicates the value to a 
potential entrepreneur of 
her best alternate activity. 
The intersection of the two 
curves gives the equilibrium 
number of entrepreneurs. 
For example, in panel (a), 
all potential entrepreneurs 
with return greater than or 
equal to $50,000 choose 
entrepreneurship.
Panel (b): Extractive eco-
nomic institutions shift the 
return-to-entrepreneurship 
curve to the left, as shown in 
panel (b). Two reasons this 
shift might occur are the fol-
lowing: first, weak property 
rights prevent entrepreneurs 
from capturing their full 
returns, and second, with a 
lack of legal backup, entre-
preneurs cannot easily form 
reliable contracts with busi-
ness partners, which can re-
duce profitability by making 
supplies more expensive and 
revenues more precarious.
Panel (c): Extractive eco-
nomic institutions also 
shift the opportunity cost 
schedule upward because 
they erect entry barriers 
that make entry into entre-
preneurship more expen-
sive. Panel (c) shows the 
overall impact of extractive 
economic institutions on 
the equilibrium number 
of entrepreneurs resulting 
from a leftward shift of the 
return-to-entrepreneurship 
schedule and an upward 
shift of the opportunity 
cost schedule.

Chapter 22  |  Why Isn’t the Whole World Developed?
The return-to-entrepreneurship curve in the exhibit (shown in blue) plots these returns. The 
vertical axis shows the return, while the horizontal axis depicts the number of entrepre-
neurs who have at least the given rate of return (or higher).
To understand how the figure works, consider point A in panel (a). The vertical axis 
shows that we are looking at a return to entrepreneurship of $75,000. The horizontal axis, 
in turn, indicates that the number of entrepreneurs with at least this return to entrepre-
neurship is 500. As we consider a point with a lower return to entrepreneurship, such as 
point B, which corresponds to a return of $25,000, naturally there will be more entrepre-
neurs with at least this return—in this exhibit, 900 of them. This is because, in addition to 
the 500 ­entrepreneurs with a return greater than $75,000, there are also 400 entrepreneurs 
with a return between $25,000 and $75,000, so the total number of entrepreneurs with a 
return greater than or equal to $25,000 is 900. This reasoning immediately implies that 
the return-to-entrepreneurship curve is downward-sloping—as we consider a lower return, 
there will be more entrepreneurs with at least that return.
The horizontal line in red shows the opportunity cost of entrepreneurship, which is 
­assumed to be the same for all potential entrepreneurs. This could be, for example, how 
much they would earn if they were to choose another occupation.
Panel (a) of the exhibit considers the general question of entry into entrepreneurship, 
which is determined by whether one’s returns to entrepreneurship are above or below one’s 
opportunity cost. Consider an entrepreneur in panel (a) with a return given by point A, 
whom we will call Entrepreneur A. Because this point is above the horizontal line, this 
individual has a greater return from entrepreneurship ($75,000) than her opportunity cost, 
which is at $50,000 in this exhibit. Therefore, she will choose to become an entrepreneur. 
On the other hand, an entrepreneur with a return given by point B ­(Entrepreneur B) will 
not do so because this point is below the horizontal line, and thus the return ($25,000) 
falls short of her opportunity cost ($50,000). This reasoning establishes that there will be 
entry into entrepreneurship until the point marked E1 is reached. At this point, the return 
to ­entrepreneurship and the opportunity cost are both $50,000, so any additional entrepre-
neur will be indifferent between entering into or exiting entrepreneurship. Thus, point E1 
­determines the equilibrium level of entrepreneurship in our economy.
How do extractive economic institutions change this picture? First consider the implications 
of insecure property rights, which are investigated in panel (b). Under insecure property rights, 
an entrepreneur will not be able to capture all of the returns that he or she creates; for example, 
the government or some other group may expropriate the returns of his or her enterprise. Sup-
pose, for example, that insecure property rights imply that Entrepreneur A will be able to keep 
only $25,000 out of her $75,000 return, and that the remaining $50,000 will be expropriated 
or paid as bribes. Because all entrepreneurs similarly can keep less of what they make under 
insecure property rights, the return-to-entrepreneurship schedule will shift to the left.
Entrepreneur A also illustrates how extractive economic institutions affect overall 
­entrepreneurship in the economy. This individual’s return to entrepreneurship, $75,000, was 
initially above the opportunity cost schedule. But with insecure property rights, she can 
make only $25,000, which is less than her opportunity cost of $50,000, as indicated by the 
fact that the new point describing Entrepreneur A’s situation, point A′, now lies below the 
opportunity cost line.
We can then see that as a result of the shift, the new equilibrium will be at point E2, which 
involves strictly less entrepreneurship. Less entrepreneurship implies less business creation, 
less technology adoption, lower returns to education and capital accumulation, and therefore 
a lower level of GDP. Thus one effect of extractive economic institutions, working in this 
instance through insecure property rights, is to reduce entrepreneurship and GDP.
Extractive economic institutions distort economic activity not only by creating insecure 
property rights but also by making it more costly or impossible to write contracts with sup-
pliers, to borrow money, or to use the courts to uphold business arrangements. For example, 
say that an entrepreneur would make $75,000 if she could engage the right supplies for her 
business. But without courts to uphold her contracts, she cannot make the deals necessary for 
obtaining supplies, and this lack of legal backup will reduce her returns from entrepreneur-
ship by $50,000. These effects will also shift the return-to-entrepreneurship schedule to the 
left, as shown in panel (b), with the same result of depressing entrepreneurship and GDP in 
the economy.

Finally, extractive economic institutions can create entry barriers, preventing otherwise 
profitable businesses from being founded, and may also encourage entrepreneurs to 
engage in other, nonproductive activities rather than entrepreneurship (for example, 
joining the underground economy). These factors thus increase the opportunity cost of 
entrepreneurship, as shown in panel (c) of the exhibit. Using the same numerical example 
as in panel (b), we can see that without entry barriers, entrepreneurs who can generate 
returns greater than $50,000 will open businesses (see the light red line on the graph). But 
if each entrepreneur also has to get a license that costs $25,000, only entrepreneurs who 
have returns greater than $75,000 will find it profitable to enter (see the dark red line on the 
graph, now shifted upward). We interpret this additional $25,000 as shifting the opportunity 
cost upward because it is a cost that entrepreneurs have to pay before they enter, therefore 
making their second-best alternative more attractive by $25,000. Thus panel (c) of the 
exhibit simultaneously shows two possible implications of extractive economic institutions:
	
1.	 By creating insecure property rights and limiting legal backup, they make entrepre-
neurship less profitable and shift the return-to-entrepreneurship schedule to the left.
	
2.	 By erecting entry barriers, they make entry more costly and shift the opportunity 
cost schedule upward.
The resulting equilibrium, shown at E3, now corresponds to even less entrepreneurship. As 
before, an economy at point E3, with less entrepreneurship, will have lower prosperity than 
point E1 because—as more potential entrepreneurs are discouraged—investment, business 
creation, and technological development are held back, and the economy generates a lower 
level of GDP.
The Logic of Extractive Economic Institutions
Exhibit 22.4 shows how extractive economic institutions tend to reduce entrepreneur-
ship and economic activity, thus adversely affecting economic outcomes. It clarifies how 
there may be large differences in prosperity between two otherwise similar societies that 
differ in terms of their institutions—one having inclusive economic institutions similar 
to those in South Korea, and the other one having extractive economic institutions as in 
North Korea.
But why would a society adopt extractive economic institutions in the first place, par-
ticularly as they seem to lead to relative poverty and a lack of economic development? It 
might seem obvious that everyone should have an interest in creating the type of economic 
institutions that will bring prosperity. Wouldn’t every citizen, every politician, and even a 
predatory dictator want to make their countries as wealthy as they could?
Unfortunately for the citizens of many countries in the world, the answer is no. To 
understand why, we turn to a concept first proposed by the famous Austrian economist 
Joseph Schumpeter.11 Schumpeter emphasized the notion of creative destruction as a cen-
tral element of technological change. Creative destruction refers to the process in which 
new technologies replace old ones, new businesses replace old ones, and new skills make 
old ones redundant. The process of creative destruction implies that technological change, 
which, as we saw in Chapter 21, is the main driver of economic growth, also creates 
economic losers as it replaces otherwise profitable firms or technologies with new ones. 
­Because creative destruction is an inseparable part of the process of technological change 
and economic growth, there will be firms and individuals that will lose as a result of this 
process and will be opposed to it, and this opposition to technological change can provide 
support for the continuation of extractive economic institutions.
Extending Schumpeter’s ideas, we can also introduce the notion of political creative 
­destruction, which refers to the process in which economic growth destabilizes existing 
­regimes and reduces the political power of rulers. This might be because new technologies will 
also bring new actors on the scene who will make political demands, or because new economic 
activities may fall outside of the control of existing rulers. If the process of economic growth 
is also associated with political creative destruction, then we would expect that the politically 
powerful who fear losing their privileged positions will be ­opposed to this process.
In the context of North Korea, for example, the communist elites are powerful and enjoy 
a privileged position. The current leader, Kim Jong-Un, and his cronies could open up the 
Creative destruction refers to the 
process in which new technologies 
replace old ones, new businesses 
replace existing businesses, and new 
skills make old ones redundant.

to the process in which economic

and reduces the political power of

Chapter 22  |  Why Isn’t the Whole World Developed?
A key technology fueling the process of economic growth 
during the nineteenth century was the railroad. Rapid rail-
way construction reduced transport costs and permitted 
greater and cheaper trade within and between countries. 
By 1860, Britain had laid 9,073 miles of railways, Germany 
6,890 miles, and the United States 30,626 miles.
While many countries were investing in railways rapidly, 
two of the most powerful empires in continental Europe—
Russia and Austria-Hungary—did not. Russia started doing 
so only after its bitter defeat in the Crimean war in 1856. 
Even in the early twentieth century, the number of railway 
journeys per inhabitant per year was 21.9 in Britain, but 
only 1.7 in Central and Eastern Europe.
Why did Russia and Austria-Hungary not invest in 
railways?
The answer is related to political creative destruction. 
The monarchs in both countries feared that railways and 
the accompanying process of industrialization would 
undermine their power and destabilize their regimes. 
For example, Francis I, who ruled Austria-Hungary in the 
early nineteenth century, and his right-hand man, Klemens 
von Metternich, were opposed to industrialization and 
railways. When the English philanthropist Robert Owen 
tried to convince the government of Austria-Hungary that 
some social reforms were necessary to improve the living 
standards of the citizens, one of Metternich’s assistants, 
Frederick Gentz, replied:
We do not desire at all that the great masses shall 
­become well off and independent. . . . How could we 
otherwise rule over them?
This attitude is likely what made Francis I and Metternich 
oppose railway construction because it would make their 
subjects more difficult to rule.
This was also the view of Nikolai I, who ruled the 
­Russian Empire between 1825 and 1855. He thought 
that the railways were the harbinger of worker unrest, 
­industrial demands, and instability, so he opposed them. 
­Austria-Hungary and Russia thus blocked technology 
adoption and economic development because they 
feared the political instability that they would bring.
The blocking of productive technologies is not something 
that just happened in history. The Internet is one of the 
most important technologies of today and offers a huge 
amount of information to individuals and firms, as well 
as a platform for the expression of ideas and media. But 
according to the organization Reporters Without ­Borders, 
Bahrain, Belarus, Myanmar, Cuba, Iran, North ­Korea, Saudi 
Arabia, Syria, Turkmenistan, and ­Uzbekistan seriously 
curtail the use of the Internet or suppress online expression. 
As was the case with Russia and ­Austria-Hungary in the 
nineteenth century, oftentimes these policies are related 
to political creative destruction: limiting the content that 
can be accessed online is a strategy to control dissent and 
maintain political power.
LETTING THE DATA SPEAK
Blocking the Railways
economy, let markets work, allow citizens to open businesses and import technologies, and 
start strengthening their ties with South Korea and the West. All these initiatives would 
kick-start economic growth and lift ­millions of North Koreans 
out of poverty. But this process would also allow new leaders to 
emerge—and perhaps also discredit the old leadership that has 
kept the country in poverty for so long. ­Because Kim and his 
allies put their own interests ahead of those of ordinary North 
­Koreans, they prefer to maintain the status quo rather than reform 
economic institutions to enhance economic growth.
In fact, fear of creative destruction and political creative de-
struction makes many rulers, not just communist dictators, explic-
itly ban the adoption of new technologies and block the process of 
economic development.
Inclusive Economic Institutions and the Industrial Revolution
We saw in Chapter 21 how the process of technological change gathered speed during 
the ­Industrial Revolution in Britain, which first involved a series of major innovations in 
textiles that then spread to other areas—for instance, resulting in the famous advances in 
the steam engine, which laid the foundation of modern production as well as the railroad. 
Fear of creative destruction and 
political creative destruction makes 
many rulers . . . explicitly ban the 
adoption of new technologies and 
block the process of economic 
development.

Economic historians have long debated why the Industrial Revolution took place in Britain 
rather than in France or some other European nation or in China, and why it started in the 
second half of the eighteenth century instead of some other time in history.
A complex social and economic process such as the Industrial Revolution seldom has a 
single cause. Economic historians have come up with scores of explanations for why it oc-
curred. Despite this variety, though, many of these explanations either depend on ­Britain’s 
relatively inclusive economic institutions or simply take them as given. This is because it 
would be next to impossible to imagine how the Industrial Revolution could have taken 
place in Britain without such inclusive economic institutions.12 The defining character-
istic of the Industrial Revolution was that new technologies were being developed and 
implemented by businessmen for profit. Without secure property rights, these businessmen 
would not have been encouraged to seek and undertake such innovations. The innovations 
were profitable, in turn, because Britain already had a well-developed market system, and 
those who could adopt new technologies to improve quality and reduce costs in textiles and 
other areas could reach a larger market and make sizable profits.
Britain also had a patent system that allowed the inventors of new technologies to pro-
tect their property rights not only in tangible assets but also in ideas. In fact, the protection 
of new ideas and innovations, just like the protection of other economic assets, was a major 
impetus to innovation and technological change in Britain.
Britain, in contrast to many other countries in the eighteenth century, also allowed rela-
tively free entry into different lines of business. Although different interests tried to block 
entry of competitors and were sometimes successful in this endeavor (as when woolen 
manufacturers temporarily convinced Parliament to ban cotton imports), these entry bar-
riers were often short-lived. By international standards, Britain gradually created a much 
more level playing field for its potential businesspeople. These institutional features of 
British society were the key prerequisites for the Industrial Revolution.
Notably, British economic institutions were also supported by the appropriate politi-
cal institutions. The development of these economic institutions was preceded by major 
political reforms, in particular the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which introduced a con-
stitutional monarchy and considerable constraints on the political powers of the monarch. 
The political institutions enshrined in the Glorious Revolution and further developed in the 
subsequent century were the bulwarks upon which the inclusive economic institutions that 
underpinned the Industrial Revolution were built.
 
Evidence-Based Economics
H
ow do we determine whether tropical geographic conditions condemn a na-
tion to poverty? We cannot do this by varying a nation’s geography and seeing 
whether this affects its long-run economic development because, by definition, 
geographic conditions are largely immutable.
To gauge the importance of geographic factors in differences in prosperity and pov-
erty, we can look at whether countries with the same geographic conditions have sig-
nificantly changed their relative prosperity as their institutions have changed. We have 
already seen one example of the profound effect of institutions on prosperity in this 
chapter: North Korea and South Korea. In this section, we answer our opening question 
by looking at another interesting historical episode.
Europeans came to dominate much of the world starting in the late fifteenth cen-
tury after they went around the southern end of Africa to reach the Indian Ocean and 
they discovered the New World. These events led to the process of colonization, in 
which ­European nations built new colonies around the world and came to conquer many

Evidence-Based Economics (Continued) 
existing empires and states. Many of the non-European parts of the world were 
under their command at one point or another during the 500 years between the 
end of the fifteenth century and the middle of the twentieth century.
Europeans set up very different institutions in various parts of the world. 
We in the United States live in a former European colony, and the strength 
of our institutions today has a lot to do with the fact that Europeans set up 
a very different system in North America than in other colonies. ­Political 
participation quickly became relatively broad in North America and, equally 
importantly, production came to be supported by fairly inclusive economic 
institutions. Small agricultural holders were the main producers in the early 
stages of the American colonies. Though many ­Europeans first came to North 
America as indentured servants who were obliged to supply their ­labor at a 
very low wage to those who brought them to the new continent, they soon 
largely acquired economic and political rights and became citizens with rela-
tively ­secure property rights.
The situation could not have been more different in other colonies. Like North ­America, 
Barbados and Jamaica were British colonies. But the British did not set up ­inclusive 
­economic institutions in these islands. Rather, they developed as clear exemplars of 
­extractive economic institutions: they were plantation economies, with a small minority 
dominating a majority brought over as slaves from Africa. Slaves had no political rights 
and essentially no economic rights. They were forced to work for very long hours. Their 
situation was so terrible that many of them died from the onerous work and the unsanitary 
conditions in which they were kept. These people could not effectively defend their inter-
ests because under the law of the land, the plantation owners controlled all of the power 
and all of the guns.
These types of extractive economic institutions were not just confined to the ­Caribbean 
islands, where the majority of the population consisted of imported slaves. The living con-
ditions of the native population areas that now correspond to Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, 
and Bolivia were only a little better. The descendants of the Mayas, Incas, and Aztecs 
were stripped of all rights (not that they had many before the Europeans arrived) and were 
forced to work in mines and on agricultural estates for low wages and under violent threats. 
These people also did not have any political representation, and their property rights were 
far from secure.
In sum, Europeans set up widely different economic institutions. In some places, they 
were inclusive; in others, highly extractive. Given this variation in institutions, we can try 
to evaluate whether it is the institutions that matter or whether some parts of the world are 
condemned to poverty by their geography. In particular, we can achieve this by examin-
ing how relative prosperity has changed after European colonization in different areas that 
were part of the European empire.
But there is a problem. How do we measure the GDP per capita and prosperity of 
places 500 years ago? Today, we can use the national income accounts, as we saw in 
Chapter 19. But the inhabitants of the Caribbean islands or the Aztecs and the Incas, let 
alone the Native Americans occupying the North American plains, did not have national 
income accounts.
Fortunately, we can use measurements of urbanization (the fraction of the population 
living in urban centers with 5,000 or more inhabitants) as a fairly good proxy for measur-
ing the prosperity of a nation. This is because only countries that can generate sufficient 
agricultural surplus and develop a transportation and trading network to bring this surplus 
to cities can support a large urban population. Much historical evidence documents a causal 
relationship between urbanization and prosperity. Even in the late twentieth century, when 
many nations around the world had long been industrialized, there was still a very strong 
association between GDP per capita and urbanization.

Exhibit 22.5 The  
Relationship Between 
Urbanization and GDP per 
Capita in 2010
This exhibit shows the 
­relationship between 
­urbanization (as measured 
by the fraction of the 
­population living in urban 
centers with more than 
5,000 inhabitants) and GDP 
per capita (in PPP-adjusted 
2005 constant ­dollars) in 
2010 together with the 
best-fit line. It suggests that 
even today, urbanization is a 
good proxy for prosperity.
Exhibit 22.5 shows this relationship in 2010. On the vertical axis, we have GDP per capita 
(in PPP-adjusted 2005 constant dollars) and on the horizontal axis, we have the fraction of the 
population living in urban centers with 5,000 or more inhabitants. The exhibit shows that even 
today there is a fairly strong positive association between urbanization and GDP per capita.
Exhibit 22.6 shows the relationship between urbanization in 1500, estimated from vari-
ous historical sources, and GDP per capita today. The remarkable thing that the exhibit 
reveals is what we call “the reversal of fortune,” as shown by the best-fit line in this figure. 
This reversal differs from the pattern of persistent prosperity that we are generally used 
to seeing around the world. As we saw in Chapter 21, most of the countries that are rich 
today are those that were rich 50 years ago or even 100 years ago. Thus, holding all else 
equal, we expect to see the persistence of relative prosperity over time. We would therefore 
expect areas that were highly urbanized centuries ago to still be the ones that are relatively 
prosperous today, even if some of their advantage may have been eroded.
But Exhibit 22.6 shows something very different. The areas that were relatively more 
­urbanized in 1500, and thus relatively more prosperous, today are generally poorer. In 
1500, places like Mexico, Peru, North Africa, and India were relatively more prosperous 
than the parts of North America that were later to become the United States and ­Canada, 
­Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, which were sparsely populated and scarcely 
­urbanized. ­Today, the picture has changed. There is a sharp reversal.
Admittedly, Exhibit 22.6 uses a limited sample that excludes sub-Saharan African coun-
tries, for which we do not have urbanization data in 1500. But we can extend the sample by 
using another proxy. The same reasoning that led to the use of urbanization rates as a proxy 
for prosperity also suggests that we can use population density as a proxy. Only areas with 
sufficient agricultural surplus, a developed trading and transport structure, and sufficiently 
healthy living conditions can support a high population density. We therefore adopt this ap-
proach in Exhibit 22.7 to include data from places like sub-Saharan Africa. Even with this 
larger sample, the reversal of fortune persists: areas that were relatively more prosperous as 
measured by their population density in 1500 are today relatively less prosperous.

Density
There is also a strong negative 
relationship between popula-
tion density in 1500, another 
potential proxy for prosperity 
before European colonization, 
and prosperity today. Colonized 
areas that were capable of 
supporting larger populations 
(per acre of arable land) in 1500 
are less prosperous today. This 
­pattern is another piece of evi-
dence against the geography 
hypothesis and is consistent 
with the role of institutions in 
shaping ­prosperity. That is, the 
reversal in the relative rankings 
of countries by prosperity since 
1500 is largely a result of the 
fact that Europeans set up more 
­extractive economic institutions 
in colonies that had greater 
population densities.
Exhibit 22.6 The Reversal of 
Fortune Using Urbanization
The former European colonies 
that were more prosperous 
in 1500, before European 
colonization, as proxied by 
their level of urbanization, are 
relatively less prosperous today. 
This can be shown by the 
negatively sloped best-fit line 
for the relationship between 
urbanization (fraction of the 
population living in towns with 
more than 5,000 inhabitants) 
in 1500 and GDP per capita in 
2010. This reversal of fortune 
is strong evidence against the 
geography hypothesis because 
the relative prosperity of these 
nations has changed greatly 
while potential geographic 
determinants of ­prosperity 
haven’t.

Understanding the Reversal of Fortune
How do we explain this reversal of fortune? One possibility could have been to appeal to 
geography. In fact, if we had found that places such as Mexico, India, and sub-Saharan 
­Africa were much poorer than North America and Australia 500 years ago, it may have 
been plausible to think that these differences were due to geography. It could have been 
argued that agriculture was more productive in the temperate soils of North America and 
Australia than in the semitropical soils of Peru or India, and these differences were the 
reason why North America and Australia were richer than South America and South Asia.
But the pattern in the data shows the opposite. Five hundred years ago, many parts of South 
America, South Asia, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa were more developed than North 
America, Australia, and New Zealand, but today they are much poorer. Thus a geographic 
explanation cannot account for the patterns that we are seeing in Exhibits 22.6 and 22.7. 
Geographic conditions are fixed. Therefore, if the geographic conditions of Peru, India, the 
Caribbean, and African nations condemn them to low agricultural productivity and poverty, 
we should see that same poverty in 1500 as well as today. But the fact that these places were 
relatively more prosperous back then suggests that we must look to what actually changed 
between 1500 and today to understand the root of their reversal of fortune. And what changed 
was not these countries’ geography but their institutions after European colonization.
To be fair, one could come up with more sophisticated geographical hypotheses that 
could account for such a reversal. For example, we could argue that geography has a time-
varying effect. Perhaps the geographic characteristics that were conducive to economic 
growth in 1500 have become a burden.
Although this supposition is, in theory, possible, it is not plausible in practice. Today, most 
countries’ wealth is generated by industry, trade, and services. And these are precisely the 
kind of economic activities that depend less on climate and more on institutions. ­Diseases 
matter today, but we are much better at controlling them, and many semitropical areas have 
been able to eradicate deadly diseases such as malaria. Thus, if anything, geographic handi-
caps such as poor soil quality, a worse disease environment, and more adverse transport 
conditions should have mattered much more 500 years ago than today. To the extent that 
sub-Saharan Africa and the tropical parts of Asia and Latin America have adverse geographic 
conditions, these should have disadvantaged them 500 years ago, not today. If such a sophis-
ticated geography hypothesis were correct, today we should see them having a comparative 
­advantage in industry and trade (the very opposite of what we see, where these poor nations 
are still largely agricultural).
These observations lead us to conclude that geographic characteristics are not the main 
reason why tropical and semitropical parts of the world are today much poorer than North 
America and Australia.
Instead, we can view the reversal of fortune as the consequence of an institutional rever-
sal in the sense that Europeans established more extractive economic institutions in places 
that were previously more developed and set up more inclusive economic institutions in 
places that were previously less developed. This pattern resulted from a simple logic. 
European colonialism was driven by a profit motive, and in places where Europeans en-
countered relatively developed civilizations, it was profitable for them to set up extractive 
economic institutions to funnel gold, silver, and agricultural surplus to their countries and 
to themselves. Most importantly, they were able to use the labor in these relatively densely 
populated areas to achieve their objectives, often taking over the existing institutions of the 
empires they dominated and setting up their own extractive economic institutions.
In contrast, in areas where they did not encounter such developed civilizations and the 
land was sparsely settled, such as North America, Europeans themselves went in to colonize 
and develop institutions under which they themselves would live. They had the incentives 
and the ability to structure these institutions in a more inclusive fashion. As a result, the 
lands of the former Aztec and Inca empires—Mexico, Peru, and their surroundings—ended

Evidence-Based Economics (Continued) 
up with extractive economic institutions, while Europeans who settled in the lands that 
were later to become the United States and Canada ended up with more inclusive economic 
institutions. This institutional reversal then led to the reversal of prosperity. Areas under 
inclusive economic institutions rapidly developed, particularly in the nineteenth century 
when they could readily adopt the new technologies of industry, while those under extrac-
tive economic institutions stagnated and grew much less rapidly.
We can now suggest an answer to the question posed in the title of this chapter: Why isn’t the 
whole world developed? The answer is that inclusive economic institutions are at the root of the 
wealth of nations because when market participants are not harassed by excessive regulations 
or paralyzed by uncertainty about the future that extractive economic institutions create, they 
will work, invest, innovate, and create a vibrant economy where opportunities for success feed 
on each other. While luck does inevitably play some role in the 
fate of individuals even in countries with inclusive economic in-
stitutions, an uncorrupt justice system that protects life and prop-
erty and an environment where risk taking and experimentation 
are not frowned upon are the pillars that provide economic and 
­social incentives that enrich individuals and nations.
Inclusive economic institutions are at 
the root of the wealth of nations.

No. Many of these ­countries 
were relatively more pros-

countries further from the 
equator that have become 
prosperous today. This rever-
sal of fortune is not a reflec-
tion of ­changing geographic 
features but of different in-
stitutional structures (extrac-
tive versus inclusive) being 
imposed during European 
colonization.

In the chapter on economic growth, we discussed certain policies that can help poor coun-
tries grow. But what about foreign aid?
Many in the Western world think that, if at all feasible, we should take steps toward 
­improving the lives of the hundreds of millions of people who live in poverty. This convic-
tion has led to a substantial effort over the past 60 years to provide foreign aid—in fact 
“­development aid”—to poor nations. Development aid, given by charitable organizations, 
the World Bank, and the United Nations, or sometimes by bilateral deals between coun-
tries, is meant to alleviate or even fundamentally eradicate poverty around the world.

A solution to world poverty? Angelina Jolie is one of 
many Hollywood celebrities devoting their time and 
money to humanitarian efforts aimed at alleviating 
poverty. Are these efforts likely to eradicate poverty?
Many in the international community—for example, high-level 
­officials of the World Bank and the United Nations and several jour-
nalists and commentators—have much hope pinned on development 
aid. But has this type of foreign aid been effective in reducing poverty 
around the world?
You might at first be surprised, but economists’ overall verdict 
is that foreign aid has been on the whole ineffective in alleviating 
poverty. For example, over the past 50 years, hundreds of billions of 
dollars have been given to Africa as development aid, but as we have 
seen, African nations are still much poorer than the United States or 
Western Europe. Why is that the case?
Though surprising at first, once we use economics to understand 
how foreign aid might work and recognize the difficulties faced, this 
conclusion turns out to be quite reasonable for three reasons. First, we 
know from our analysis so far that GDP per capita can be increased 
and economic growth can be triggered if the levels of a country’s 
physical capital, human capital, and/or technology can be increased 
significantly. Although generous from the viewpoint of the donor nations, the amount 
of foreign aid given to even the poorest countries is not large enough to lead to a siz-
able increase in physical capital or to significantly increase the educational attainment of 
the countries’ population. It also generally does not have an impact on technology or the 
­efficiency of production. In view of this, the fact that foreign aid hasn’t made significant 
progress in increasing GDP per capita among the poorest nations in the world shouldn’t be 
too surprising.
Second, in practice, much of foreign aid does not even get invested in new tech-
nology or education. Problems related to corruption and political economy imply that 
money given to governments or other organizations in poor countries is often captured 
In the 1990s, the government of Uganda spent a fifth of 
its budget on primary education. A sizable fraction of this 
money was provided by the international community as 
developmental aid.
When policymakers and academics evaluate the ef-
fectiveness of spending, they generally ask whether ini-
tial objectives were met and whether the benefits of a 
project exceeded its costs. But in the case of foreign 
and governmental aid, the money often does not even 
reach its intended target, precluding the chance to even 
try to use the money effectively. A survey by economists 
Ritva Reinikka and Jakob Svensson has revealed that 
only 13 percent of schools in Uganda actually received 
the grants to which they were entitled in the period 
studied.13
The study found that a large portion of the money in-
tended for schools was stolen by local officials. Interest-
ingly, the schools located in the richer regions typically 
received more money than the schools located in the 
poorer areas. This disparity appears to be partly due to 
the fact that schools in richer areas have more resources 
to start with and better connections. So they may have 
been able to secure more of the money that was intended 
for them. Very little of the intended resources for students 
in the poorest regions actually reached their destination. 
This type of corruption and siphoning off of government 
resources and aid money is unfortunately all too common 
and poses a formidable obstacle to the effective distribu-
tion of foreign aid in many countries. As in the Ugandan 
case, it may often also contribute to greater inequality 
of resources across regions and schools within a country.

and distributed to corrupt officials. Studies indicate that only about 15 percent of any 
money given to foreign aid actually reaches its destination, and often it does so in a rather 
distorted manner.
There is also a third, and a more fundamental, reason for why foreign aid has a limited 
impact in alleviating poverty. If the root of poverty is the extractive economic institutions of 
many countries around the world, then foreign aid working within the framework of these 
same institutions will not fix the fundamental causes. In fact, in some instances, foreign aid 
funneled to dictators sitting atop of these extractive economic institutions might strengthen 
or enrich them, as suggested by the Choice & Consequence box on the previous page.
All of the evidence on the costs and limits of foreign aid doesn’t mean that foreign aid 
is bad or useless. Often, foreign aid is a transfer to some of the poorest people in the world 
and helps alleviate their hardships, albeit temporarily, and as such serves a useful, even if 
limited, role. Still, we must also devote our energy to developing policies that address the 
fundamental causes of prosperity—like institutions—if we wish to enduringly improve 
living conditions in the world’s impoverished countries.
Summary
Physical capital, human capital, and technology are proximate causes of 
prosperity in the sense that, though they determine whether a nation is prosperous 
or not, they are themselves determined by other, deeper factors. Put differently, 
if we want to understand why some nations are poor, we have to ask why they do 
not sufficiently invest in physical capital or human capital and why they do not 
adopt the best technologies and organize their production efficiently.
The fundamental causes of prosperity include factors that potentially 
influence the physical and human capital investment and technology choices of 
nations and, via this channel, shape their prosperity.
Three leading fundamental causes of prosperity are geography, culture, and 
institutions. According to the geography hypothesis, geographic aspects such as 
climate, topography, or disease environment determine whether or not a nation 
can be prosperous. According to the culture hypothesis, it is the cultural values 
of the country’s people that powerfully determine its potential for prosperity. 
According to the institutions hypothesis, it is the institutions, in particular the 
formal and informal rules governing the organization of society and economic 
interactions therein, that are central to prosperity.
Inclusive economic institutions are those that provide secure property rights, 
and a judicial system that allows and facilitates private contracting and financial 
transactions and maintain relatively open and free entry into different businesses 
and occupations. Extractive economic institutions, by contrast, create insecure 
property rights, a partial judicial system, and entry barriers that protect the 
businesses and incomes of a small segment of society at the expense of the rest. 
According to the institutions hypothesis, inclusive economic institutions tend to 
generate prosperity, while extractive economic institutions do not.
Though the inequalities in GDP per capita around the world have multiple 
causes, the evidence from the economic experiences of former European colonies 
suggests that institutional factors, and not geography, are central to explaining 
these disparities. In fact, the major patterns—for example, the reversal of fortune, 
whereby areas that were relatively prosperous became relatively less prosperous 
after European colonization—cannot be explained by geographic factors.
Foreign aid can be useful to temporarily alleviate extreme poverty or manage 
crises but is unlikely to be a solution to low economic development in many parts of 
the world. This is because aid largely fails to address the institutional roots of poverty.

b.	 From independence in 1947 until the 1990s, there was 
in place in India that came to be known as the “Paper

business owners to navigate a bureaucratic labyrinth in 
order to start and run their companies. For example, one 
entrepreneur complained that simply to import a com-
puter, he had to make 50 trips to New Delhi to get the 
necessary permits. Starting in the 1990s, many of these 
restrictions were abolished. A series of reforms made 
it much easier for firms to conduct business. (Based on

posits that to establish the effectiveness of aid in promot-

should be a positive statistical association between aid 
and investment; second, aid should pass into investment 1 
for 1, that is, a 1 percent (of GDP) increase in aid should 
result in a 1 percent (of GDP) increase in investment. 
Using a dataset of 88 countries from 1965 to 1995, he 
finds that only 17 of 88 countries pass the first test, and of 
them, only 6 pass the second.

spur investment usually does not work.

Employment

What happens to 
employment and 
unemployment if 
local employers go 
out of business?
Economic shocks frequently hit local communities. A weak 
car market causes Ford to shutter an assembly plant. 
A weak regional economy causes a big-box-­retailer—like JCPenney, Kmart, 
or Sears—to shut one of its megastores. Falling coal prices cause a mining 
­company to mothball an open-pit coal mine. Competition from new suppliers 
causes a clothing company to close a textile factory. Do the workers who lose 
these jobs quickly find new ones? Do the local labor markets quickly bounce 
back? Or do these communities experience persistent unemployment?
In this chapter, we study the determinants of employment and unemploy-
ment, and investigate how various economic shocks affect the labor market 
equilibrium.

The level of employment and the level of wages are determined by 
firms’ labor demand, workers’ labor supply, and various wage rigidities.
Frictional unemployment arises because it takes time for an 
unemployed worker to learn about the condition of the labor market and 
find a new job.
Structural unemployment arises because wage rigidities prevent the 
quantity of labor demanded from matching the quantity of labor supplied.
Cyclical unemployment is the difference between the unemployment 
rate and its long-term average.
Because of its enormous economic 
and social costs, politicians and 
­policymakers try to limit the amount 
of unemployment in an economy.
After 17 months of unsuccessful job applications, one unemployed worker wrote in a letter 
to the New York Times that “nothing stops the omnipresent feeling of loneliness, worthless-
ness and desperation.”1 For most people, enduring a long period of unemployment takes a 
terrible toll on their well-being. Long-term unemployment gener-
ates three simultaneous traumas: a loss of income, a loss of skills, 
and a loss of perceived self-worth.
Because of its enormous economic and social costs, policymak-
ers try to limit the amount of unemployment in an economy. To do 
so, they must have a way of measuring and tracking unemploy-
ment over time. Unfortunately, just measuring unemployment is 
challenging. For example, it seems reasonable that a 30-year-old 
without a job who is actively looking for work should count as un-
employed. But should we also count another 30-year-old who has lost a job but has decided 
not to look for work? What about full-time college students or stay-at-home parents: people 
who are busy and work hard but don’t receive a paycheck for their labor?
Economists have agreed on a standard, though nevertheless controversial, way of defin-
ing employment and unemployment. In the United States, this standard is set by the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the Department of Labor, which tracks the official employment 
statistics for the U.S. economy. We describe the BLS definition here.
Classifying Potential Workers
To determine who is employed and unemployed, we start by identifying the population of 
workers whose employment behavior we want to measure. This group includes everyone 
in the general population with three exceptions: children under 16 years of age, people on 
active duty in the military, and institutionalized people, like those in nursing homes or jail. 
The BLS calls the remaining population the civilian non-institutional population ages 16 
and over. For simplicity, we’ll refer to them as potential workers. In January 2014, the 
United States had 246.9 million potential workers.

23.1
Within the population of potential workers, people are classified into one of three cat-
egories: “employed,” “unemployed,” or “not in the labor force.” Those holding full-time or 
part-time paid jobs are officially classified as employed. In other words, as long as a per-
son works for pay at least part-time, she is classified as employed. Using the official defi-
nition, in January 2014, there were 145.2 million employed workers in the United States.
Potential workers are classified as unemployed if they do not have a paid job, have 
actively looked for work in the prior four weeks, and are currently available for work. This 
definition of unemployment makes it easy to classify the workers we had trouble consid-
ering above. Laid-off workers will only be considered unemployed if they are actively 
looking for a new job. Similarly, students and parents who don’t have a paid job and aren’t 
looking for one will not count as unemployed. In January 2014, there were 10.2 million 
unemployed workers in the United States.
The labor force is the sum of all employed and unemployed workers:
Labor force = Employed + Unemployed.
Finally, all potential workers who don’t fit the criteria for being employed or unemployed 
are classified as “not in the labor force.” People in this category include the stay-at-home 
parents and students as well as disabled workers, retirees, and any other potential workers 
who don’t have a paid job and aren’t looking for one. In January 2014, 91.5 ­million potential 
workers were not in the labor force. Exhibit 23.1 depicts the relationship between potential 
workers, employed workers, unemployed workers, and those not in the labor force.
Calculating the Unemployment Rate
Using these classifications, economists calculate a number of statistics to describe the la-
bor market. The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force that is 
unemployed:
  Unemployment rate = 100% * Unemployed
Labor force
 = 100% *
Unemployed
Employed + Unemployed 
Similarly, the labor force participation rate is defined as the percentage of potential 
workers that are in the labor force:

The population of potential work-
ers is 246.9 million people—
otherwise known as the civilian 
non-institutional population ages

be divided into three subgroups: 
employed workers (145.2 million), 
unemployed workers (10.2 million), 
and those not in the labor force 
(91.5 million). The labor force is the 
combination of the employed and 
unemployed workers (155.5 million 
with rounding).

Using these equations and our numbers from before, we can calculate what the labor force, 
unemployment rate, and labor force participation rate were in January 2014. The compo-
nents are rounded, which explains why the first sum doesn’t match exactly.
Labor force = Employed + Unemployed = 145.2 million + 10.2 million  
	
= 155.5 million.
 Unemployment rate = 100% * Unemployed
Labor force = 100% * 10.2 million
155.5 million = 6.6%.
  Labor force participation rate = 100% *
Labor force
Potential workers = 100% * 155.5 million
246.9 million
  = 63.0%.
While these calculations reflect the main way that economists measure unemployment, 
it’s important to note that they are just summaries and therefore leave out many important 
details. In particular, the way we officially count unemployed workers omits two impor-
tant categories of workers who are frustrated by the lack of jobs: discouraged workers and 
­underemployed workers.
Discouraged workers are potential workers who would like to have a job but have given 
up looking for one. Because they are not actively looking for work, these workers are not 
included in the unemployment rate as we defined it above. Instead, discouraged workers 
will be counted as out of the labor force. There were 837,000 discouraged workers in the 
United States in January 2014, representing 0.5 percent of the labor force.
Similarly, we count all paid workers as employed, even if they would like to work more 
hours. Many workers in difficult economic circumstances would like to work more hours 
to support themselves and their families but don’t have the option to do so. Although such 
workers are underemployed, they are not included in the official unemployment statis-
tic. There were 7.3 million underemployed workers in the United States in ­January 2014, 
­representing 4.7 percent of the labor force.
Trends in the Unemployment Rate
As the overall economy fluctuates, so does the unemployment rate. When the overall 
economy suffers a recession—a period in which GDP falls—the unemployment rate tends 
to rise. During typical U.S. recessions the unemployment rate reaches a level between  
6 ­percent and 9 percent. When the economy is healthy and expanding, the unemployment 
rate tends to fall to around 5 percent.
Severe recessions produce the largest increases in the unemployment rate. For exam-
ple, in early 2007—before the start of the recession later that year—the U.S. unemploy-
ment rate hovered around 4.5 percent. The 2007–2009 recession led to a sharp rise in the 
­unemployment rate and a peak rate of 10.0 percent in October 2009. During the Great 
Depression of the 1930s—the most severe contraction of the U.S. economy in the twentieth 
century—the unemployment rate reached 25 percent.
Exhibit 23.2 shows the evolution of the monthly unemployment rate in the U.S. economy 
since 1948. The unemployment rate is relatively high during and following recessions—the 
shaded areas on the exhibit correspond to recessions. For example, the unemployment rate 
was high following the oil price shocks in the mid-1970s and then again during the reces-
sion of 1981–1982. Since World War II, the peak in unemployment, 10.8 percent, occurred 
during the 1981–1982 recession. This peak is even higher than the 10.0 percent peak during 
the severe 2007–2009 recession.
It is also noteworthy that the unemployment rate is never close 
to zero. Since 1948, the U.S. unemployment rate has gone below 
3 percent during only one period in the early 1950s. Even during 
the economic boom in the 1990s, the unemployment rate reached 
a low of only around 4 percent. Later in this chapter, we’ll explain 
why some amount of unemployment—usually around 4 percent 
or 5 percent—is a necessary attribute of a well-functioning mod-
ern economy, while an unemployment rate of 10 percent is a 
­national crisis that policymakers actively try to avoid.
Some amount of unemployment— 
usually around 4 percent or 
5 ­percent—is a necessary attribute of 
a well-functioning modern economy.

Chapter 23  |  Employment and Unemployment
Who Is Unemployed?
The prevalence of unemployment varies widely across different segments of the labor 
force. One of the most noticeable disparities is that unemployment is much higher among 
those with low levels of education. Exhibit 23.3 shows, for example, that the unemploy-
ment rate among those in the labor force with less than a high school diploma was 11.0 
percent in 2013. For people in the labor force with a college degree, the unemployment rate 
was only 3.7 percent.
There are many factors that explain why more educated workers tend to have lower rates 
of unemployment. The principle of optimization provides part of the answer. When people 
lose a job, they tend to spend some of their time looking for a new job and some of their 
time engaged in production at home. There are many “home production” activities, like 
cleaning out the attic or painting the house, and most of them do not require high levels of 
formal education. People with higher levels of education aren’t necessarily more skillful in 
these home production activities.
However, more educated workers tend to earn higher wages than less educated work-
ers when working outside the home (and this is a consequence of the fact that there is 
greater demand for their labor because of their additional human capital, as we have seen 
in Chapter 20). More educated workers therefore have a higher opportunity cost of time. 
An unemployed cab driver might be indifferent between driving a cab and staying home 
for a few weeks to paint his house. An unemployed engineer might be just as good at 
house painting as the taxi driver, but the engineer would be much better off getting back to

work designing robotic assembly lines, earning a relatively high income, and using some  
of that income to hire someone else to paint her house. Higher wages make the cost of 
unemployment higher for workers with more education. Similarly, unemployment is often 
much lower among middle-aged workers, who tend to have more experience and skills—
and therefore higher wages—than younger workers.
Equilibrium in the Labor Market
To study how employment and unemployment are determined, we first need to understand 
how the labor market works. Like any other market, supply and demand play the key roles. 
We develop the demand curve for labor and the supply curve for labor separately and then 
put them together to describe the labor market equilibrium.
The Demand for Labor
When we first studied demand curves in Chapter 4, we discussed households demanding 
goods and services. Now that we are studying the labor market, the role of households 
flips. In the labor market, households supply labor and firms demand labor. Firms are now 
on the demand side ­because they need to hire workers for production.
Optimizing firms try to maximize profits, so they demand the quantity of labor that 
produces the greatest feasible profit (defined as revenues minus costs). How does a firm de-
termine the profit-maximizing quantity of labor? By comparing the revenue that a worker 
produces with the cost of employing that worker.
To see how this works, consider a barbershop. If the barbershop has only one barber, 
let’s assume that he’ll almost always be busy cutting hair and that he’ll generate revenue 
of $25 per hour. Let’s also assume that the market wage for barbers is $15 per hour. So the 
barbershop earns $10 per hour by employing this first barber: $25 − $15 = $10 per hour. 
If the shop adds a second barber, the barbershop will sell more haircuts, but from time to 
time, there won’t be enough customers to keep both barbers busy. So the addition of the 
second barber does not double sales at the barbershop. Suppose instead that the second 
barber increases sales by only $20 per hour. Because the market wage for barbers is $15 per 
hour, employing the additional barber will still increase profits by $20 − $15 = $5 per hour. 
So an optimizing barbershop will also hire the second barber.
Now consider what will happen if the barbershop adds a third barber. The third barber 
will increase sales a bit more, but will do so by even less than the addition of the second 
barber because it will rarely be the case that the shop has enough customers to simultane-
ously keep all three barbers busy. Suppose that this third barber increases sales by only 
$10 per hour. Because the market wage is $15 per hour, hiring this third barber will actually 
lower the profits of the barbershop ($10 − $15 = −$5), so the shop will refrain from hiring 
a third barber. Thus, the barbershop optimizes—in other words, maximizes its profits—by 
­employing only two barbers.
The barbershop scenario demonstrates two important facts 
about labor demand. First, as we have also seen in ­Chapters 20 
and 21, firms typically experience diminishing marginal prod-
uct of labor. Recall that the marginal product is the amount 
of output that one additional worker produces. Diminishing 
marginal product of labor means that each additional worker 
creates less marginal output than the workers who were hired 
before. For example, additional barbers will increase the hair-
cuts that the barbershop offfers, but each additional barber 
won’t be as productive as the last one because there won’t 
be enough customers to keep them all busy. Economists call 
the market value of a worker’s marginal product the value 
of the marginal product of labor. In the barbershop, the first 
barber creates $25 of additional revenue, the second $20, and 
the third only $10. Because the value of the marginal product 
of each additional barber is diminishing, hiring more barbers 
increases the total revenue of a firm by less and less.
23.2 
Even if a customer just walked in the door, the marginal 
­product of the second and third barbers is still zero.

23.5

Chapter 23  |  Employment and Unemployment
23.2
The second important fact illustrated by the barbershop example is that a firm hires workers 
until it cannot increase profits by hiring an additional worker. The firm keeps hiring as long as 
the revenue that an additional worker brings in for the firm—the value of the marginal product 
of labor—is at least as great as the cost of employing that worker, which is the market wage. To 
see why this is the case, consider Exhibit 23.4, which plots the value of the marginal product 
of labor against the number of workers employed. Because the value of the marginal product 
decreases as the number of workers employed increases, the curve is downward-sloping.
If the firm employs fewer workers than the optimal quantity shown in Exhibit 23.4, then 
it can increase profits by hiring more workers, because the revenue those workers bring in 
(the value of their marginal product) is greater than the cost of employing them (the market 
wage). Similarly, if the firm employs more workers than the optimal quantity, the firm can 
increase profits by laying off workers, because the revenue those workers bring in is less 
than the market wage, the cost of employing them.
Therefore, the profit-maximizing firm will hire the amount of labor that makes the value 
of the marginal product of labor equal to the market wage. As we change the market wage, 
the quantity of labor demanded moves along the curve depicting the value of the marginal 
­product—the firm adjusts the number of workers it employs to make the value of the mar-
ginal product equal to the wage. Thus, the downward-sloping curve in Exhibit 23.4—the 
value of the marginal product of labor—is also the labor demand curve, because it shows 
how the quantity of labor demanded varies with the wage.
Shifts in the Labor Demand Curve
The labor demand curve depicts the relationship between the quantity of labor demanded 
and the wage. A movement along the labor demand curve occurs when the wage changes 
and no other economic variables change other than the quantity of labor demanded. On the 
other hand, there are many factors that cause the entire labor demand curve to shift to the 
left or right—as depicted in Exhibit 23.5.
Any change that affects the schedule relating the quantity of labor and the value of the 
marginal product of labor will shift the labor demand curve. We discuss four shifters in this 
section:
• Changing output prices: When the price of haircuts goes down, the value of the 
marginal product of barbers also declines. This implies that the firm would like to 
hire fewer barbers at any given wage, shifting the labor demand curve to the left.
• Changing demand for the output good or service: When the demand for haircuts 
declines, this will impact the value of the marginal product of barbers even if it does 
not directly change the price of haircuts. Falling demand for haircuts lowers the num-
ber of customers coming to the barbershop, leading each barber to spend more time 
waiting idly rather than cutting hair. Such declines in demand for output will shift the 
labor demand curve to the left.
The labor demand curve depicts 
the relationship between the 
quantity of labor demanded and 
the wage. The value of the marginal 
product of labor is also the labor 
demand curve, because they both 
show how the quantity of labor 
demanded varies with the wage.

Exhibit 23.4 The Value of the Marginal Product 
of Labor Is the Labor Demand Curve
Because the marginal product of labor diminishes 
as the quantity of labor increases, the curve that 
plots the value of the marginal product of labor 
is downward-sloping. Profit maximization implies 
that the firm should hire workers up to the point 
where the market wage is equal to the value of 
the marginal product of labor. The value of the 
marginal product of labor schedule is also the 
­labor demand curve.

• Changing technology: When the value of the marginal product of labor increases, the 
labor demand curve shifts to the right. For example, technology that was developed in 
the late nineteenth century first enabled hair stylists to straighten or curl hair: “perms.” 
The ability to offer perms increased the marginal product of hair stylists and shifted the 
demand curve for hair stylists to the right. Technological progress and increases in pro-
ductivity typically shift the labor demand curve to the right, but in rare cases 
the opposite can happen. For example, machines sometimes substitute for la-
bor and shift the labor demand curve to the left. We discuss one such example 
later in the chapter.
• Changing input prices: Businesses use labor and other factors of produc-
tion, like machines and tools, to produce goods and services. When the 
cost of these other factors goes down, businesses purchase more of those 
other factors. This usually increases the marginal product of labor, shifting 
the labor demand curve to the right. For example, mechanical hair clippers 
enable barbers to cut hair more quickly. If a barbershop acquires more hair 
clippers ­(because the cost of hair clippers falls), the barbers will increase 
the number of customers that they can serve per hour.
Until now, we’ve illustrated most ideas with the labor ­demand curve of a 
single barbershop or hair stylist. To study the level of employment and unem-
ployment in the total economy, we need to derive the labor demand curve of the 
entire economy. To ­derive this economy-wide, or “aggregate,” labor demand 
curve, we proceed in two steps. First, we derive the labor demand curve for 
each industry. For example, this is done by adding together the labor demand 
curves of every barbershop. If there were 100,000 barbershops in the economy, 
and each hired two barbers when the wage for barbers is $15 per hour, then the 
total quantity of labor demanded at that wage would be 200,000 barbers. To 
derive the rest of the labor ­demand curve for this industry, we repeat this sum-
mation at every wage.
Once we have derived the labor demand curve of each industry, we can sum 
these industry labor demand curves to obtain the aggregate labor demand curve. 
In principle, we will also need to account for spillover effects among the differ-
ent industries and also between workers and firms. For example, expansion in 
one industry might create additional demand for the products of another indus-
try. In addition, changing the overall level of wages and employment will affect 
workers’ demand for the products of firms. When more workers are employed, 
they have more income to buy the products that other workers produce. We 
­return to these issues in Chapter 26.
Notice that we are simplifying our model by treating the economy as if it con-
tains a single aggregate labor demand curve. In practice, workers have differ-
ent skills and receive different wages. Nevertheless, the simplifying assumption

enables us to generate key insights about how the overall economy functions without hav-
ing to specify how different segments of the labor market function, even if it also means 
that we are omitting some interesting details about the performance of these segments.
The Supply of Labor
The labor supply curve represents the relationship between the quantity of labor sup-
plied and the wage. Like the labor demand curve, the labor supply curve is derived from 
the principles of optimization. In this case, workers optimally allocate their limited time 
between paid work, leisure, and other activities, which might include home production 
like childcare, home maintenance, cooking, or cleaning. When market wages are higher, 
it makes sense for workers to spend more time working outside the home. For instance, if 
you are paid by the hour and your employer is running overtime shifts, you can get paid  
1.5 times your normal hourly wage in those special shifts. For many workers this is a 
tempting arrangement, leading them to work more outside the home and accordingly have 
less time for chores at home or for leisure.
This kind of reasoning implies that as the wage increases, the quantity of labor supplied 
rises. Accordingly, the labor supply curve is upward-sloping, as shown in Exhibit 23.6.
Shifts in the Labor Supply Curve
As we have noted, the labor supply curve is the relationship between the quantity of labor 
supplied and the wage. A movement along the labor supply curve occurs when the wage 
changes and no other economic variables change (other than the quantity of labor supplied).
On the other hand, there are many factors that cause the entire labor supply curve to 
shift to the left or right (both shifts are depicted in Exhibit 23.6). Any change that affects 
the entire schedule relating the quantity of labor supplied and the wage will shift the labor 
supply curve. We discuss three potential changes here:
• Changing tastes: Changing tastes or social norms affect people’s willingness to take 
a paid job. For example, before World War II, married women working for pay outside 
the home were frowned upon. However, during World War II, most governments en-
couraged women to work in armaments factories as an act of patriotism. Factory work 
during the war was one early step in a worldwide shift toward acceptance of female 
labor force participation. As a result of this shift in social norms, female labor force 
participation in the United States rose from 25 percent in 1940 to almost 60 percent in 
the 1990s, corresponding to a large rightward shift in the labor supply curve.
• Changing opportunity cost of time: Devices like vacuum cleaners, dishwashers, 
laundry machines, and lawnmowers lower the opportunity cost of working outside 
the home by freeing up time that was previously needed for home production. This 
encourages people to shift more time out of home production into paid employment, 
The labor supply curve represents 
the relationship between the 
quantity of labor supplied and the 
wage.

Exhibit 23.6 Upward-Sloping 
Labor Supply Curve
The labor supply curve, which 
shows the relationship between 
the quantity of labor supplied 
and the wage rate, is upward-
sloping. As the wage rises 
(holding all else equal), people’s 
willingness to work rises. The 
exhibit also ­depicts left and 
right shifts in the labor supply 
curve. The labor ­supply curve 
shifts when the ­quantity of labor 
supplied changes at a given 
value of the wage.

generating a rightward shift in the labor supply curve. This sort of technology- 
induced change in the opportunity cost of time has also been a factor contributing to 
the rise in female labor force participation.
• Changes in population: Increases in the size of the population, corresponding 
to increases in the number of potential workers in the economy, also shift the la-
bor supply curve to the right. One factor increasing population is immigration. 
For example, each year, the United States experiences a net immigration inflow of 
roughly 1 million people, implying that the population grows one-third of 1 ­percent 
per year due to immigration. This inflow shifts the domestic U.S. labor supply 
curve to the right.
As with the labor demand curve, the labor supply curve of the entire economy (the 
“aggregate” labor supply curve) can be derived by summing over the labor supply of each 
potential worker in the economy.
Equilibrium in a Competitive Labor Market
Recall from Chapter 1 that we define an equilibrium as a situation in which nobody 
would benefit by changing his or her own behavior. Moreover, recall from Chapter 4 
that a competitive equilibrium is given by the intersection of the supply and demand 
curves. Equilibrium in a competitive labor market works the same way. In particular, the 
equilibrium in a competitive labor market is given by the point of intersection between 
the labor supply and labor demand curves, as shown in Exhibit 23.7. At the competitive 
equilibrium wage, w*, the quantity of labor supplied is equal to the quantity of labor 
demanded. At a wage above w*, the quantity of labor supplied would exceed the quantity 
of labor demanded and push the wage down. At a wage below w*, the quantity of labor 
demanded would exceed the quantity of labor supplied and push the wage up. Thus w* is 
the unique wage that equates the quantity of labor supplied and the quantity of labor de-
manded. This equilibrium quantity of labor, shown by L* in Exhibit 23.7, is also referred 
to as equilibrium employment.
We refer to the competitive equilibrium wage as the market-clearing wage. The label 
market-clearing should remind you that every worker that wants a job can (eventually) find 
one: the wage has adjusted so that the quantity of labor demanded matches the quantity 
of labor supplied. This distinguishes the market-clearing wage from the wage that results 
from wage rigidities, which prevents the wage from adjusting to equate the quantity of 
labor demanded and the quantity of labor supplied. As we’ll see later in this chapter, such 
rigidities will generate unemployment.
We will use the labor market equilibrium depicted in Exhibit 23.7 to model the overall 
level of employment in an economy. As mentioned above, we are simplifying our anal-
ysis by focusing on a single type of labor. But the labor market equilibrium shown in 
­Exhibit 23.7 can be readily applied to study equilibrium in a specific segment of the market

or in a local labor market as well. For example, we could consider the supply of and de-
mand for workers with computer programming skills (or doctors or gardeners, etc.) and 
derive the equilibrium wage and employment level in that specific labor market.
It is useful to note that the labor market depicted in Exhibit 23.7 is what is sometimes 
­referred to as a frictionless labor market. In a frictionless market, firms can instantly hire and 
fire workers, both workers and firms have complete information about each other, and the 
wage adjusts instantly to clear the market (setting the quantity of labor supplied equal to the 
quantity of labor demanded). We will see next why departures from this frictionless labor 
market are often useful for understanding real-world labor markets and unemployment.
Why Is There Unemployment?
At the market-clearing wage w* in Exhibit 23.7, the labor supply and labor demand 
curves intersect. Accordingly, the quantity of labor demanded equals the quantity of labor 
­supplied—every worker who wants to work at wage w* has a job. There are people who 
are not working—represented by the segment of the labor supply curve that lies above the 
market-clearing wage. The people on this part of the labor supply curve are only willing to 
work for wages above the market-clearing wage w*.
In the economy depicted in Exhibit 23.7, there are employed workers and workers who 
are not employed because they are unwilling to work at the market-­clearing wage w*. In a 
competitive equilibrium, there should be no workers looking for work (they are either em-
ployed or unwilling to work at the market-clearing wage). This implies that in a competitive 
equilibrium there shouldn’t be people who are not employed and looking for work. But 
then, how would we explain the fact that there were 10.2 million officially unemployed 
Americans in January 2014, who are thus counted as not employed and looking for work?
A first possibility is that the official unemployment statistics are probably count-
ing some workers who are only willing to work for a wage above the market-clearing 
wage w*. Because unemployment survey questions do not specify that the workers should 
be looking for work at the current prevailing market wage, some people might be counted 
as unemployed even though they are looking only for jobs that pay more than the current 
prevailing market wage.
However, the available evidence suggests that most unemployed workers would be will-
ing to work at the prevailing market wage but are unable to find employers that are willing 
to hire them at this wage.2 Thus, we must find another way to explain why 10.2 million 
Americans couldn’t find a job in January 2014.
When economic models do not predict what we observe in the world, we must ask our-
selves whether the assumptions we made in our model are correct. In our model of the labor 
market, we made an assumption that might not actually hold.
We assumed that workers and firms have full information about the job market. For in-
stance, we assumed that they know what the equilibrium wage is, what qualifications employ-
ers are looking for, and where the jobs are. This means that workers can instantly find the right 
job for themselves whenever it is available and no open job will be left unfilled. On the other 
hand, when firms and workers lack important information about the labor market, workers 
cannot always be matched to open jobs, and this mismatch will cause unemployment.
We next discuss this type of unemployment, which we call frictional unemployment. 
We then turn to two other economic factors that explain why unemployment exists and also 
why it varies over time.
23.3 
Job Search and Frictional 
Unemployment
In the economy described by Exhibit 23.7, any worker wishing to be employed at the 
­market-clearing wage w* can do so. Up until this point, our analysis of the labor market as-
sumes that the labor market is frictionless, which implies that the worker can instantly find 
an employer that is willing to hire her. Yet if you’ve ever looked for a job, you’ve probably

Wage Rigidity and Structural 
Unemployment
Frictional unemployment resulting from job search activities is 
a normal and necessary feature of every labor market. However, 
unemployment also arises because wages are sometimes above 
the market-clearing level w*, meaning that the quantity of labor 
­supplied is greater than the quantity of labor demanded. When 
wages are held fixed above the competitive equilibrium level 
that clears the labor market, this is referred to as wage rigidity. 
­Structural unemployment arises when the quantity of labor sup-
plied persistently exceeds the quantity of labor demanded. Wage 
rigidity is a key factor in leading to such a persistent gap. Wage rigidity can occur for many 
reasons, which we discuss next but the economic effects are all the same: holding the mar-
ket wage above the market-clearing wage causes some workers who would like to work at 
the market wage to be unemployed. To illustrate how wage rigidity impacts the labor mar-
ket, we start with minimum wage laws because it is easy to understand their effect ­using 
the supply and demand framework. However, other causes of wage rigidity are much more 
important in the U.S. labor market and we study those in turn.
Minimum Wage Laws
In most countries, legislation specifies a minimum level for the hourly wage. Such leg-
islated wage floors, often called minimum wage laws, can prevent the market wage from

Job search refers to the activities 
that workers undertake to find 
appropriate jobs.
Frictional unemployment refers to 
unemployment that arises because 
workers have imperfect information 
about available jobs and need to 
engage in a time-consuming process 
of job search.
Wage rigidity refers to the 
condition in which the market 
wage is held above the competitive 
equilibrium level that would clear 
the labor market.
Structural unemployment arises 
when the quantity of labor supplied 
persistently exceeds the quantity of 
labor demanded.
Holding the market wage above the 
market-clearing wage causes some 
workers who would like to work at 
the market wage to be unemployed.
Because each person has specific 
capabilities, experience, and job 
preferences, finding the right match 
between an unemployed person and 
a firm usually takes time.
discovered that finding the right job is not simple and might take a 
lot of legwork. It might be simple to find a summer job at McDon-
ald’s, but it’s hard to land a job that is a good fit for your particular 
skills and capabilities.
To find the right job, you need to determine which firms are 
hiring and try to learn how pay, benefits, and other job character-
istics vary among them. You have to line up references and send 
out résumés. It also helps to network with family and friends to 
find some acquaintance of an acquaintance who happens to work 
where you are applying. You need to set up interviews and survive 
them. Finally, you wait for the people who conduct those inter-
views to finish interviewing the other leading candidates. In most cases, someone else gets 
chosen and then you start all over again.
Economists refer to job-hunting activities as job search. Because each person has 
­specific capabilities, experience, and job preferences, finding the right match between an 
unemployed person and a firm usually takes time.
Search frictions arise both because of the time-consuming logistics of finding, apply-
ing, and interviewing for jobs and because firms and workers have imperfect information 
about each other and the state of the economy. Imagine a Detroit autoworker who loses 
his $40/hour job during the 2007–2009 recession. Shortly afterward, he hears about job 
offers in the service sector for $20/hour. Instead of pursuing those jobs, he keeps looking 
for higher-paying jobs in the auto industry. Only after months of unsuccessful searching in 
the auto sector, does he have enough information to conclude that his best options are the 
$20/hour jobs in the service sector. Examples like this illustrate that gathering information 
and searching for the right job takes time.
Unemployment resulting from imperfect information about available jobs and from the 
time-consuming process of job search is frictional unemployment.
Though it might at first seem strange, you can think about the dating market in the same 
way that you think about the job market. It takes a long time to find a person who is a good 
match as a romantic partner. In this sense, people who are not in a relationship, but looking 
for one, are romantically unemployed. We don’t expect single people to find a new romantic 
partner overnight and we shouldn’t expect unemployed workers to instantly find a job either.

falling to the market-clearing wage that equates the quantity of labor supplied with the 
quantity of labor demanded. In the United States, the federal government chooses a na-
tional minimum wage and state legislatures can choose even higher minimum wages for 
in-state jobs. In January 2014, for example, the federal minimum wage was $7.25, while 
the highest state minimum wage was $9.32, which applied in Washington State.
Minimum wages might prevent the quantity of labor supplied from equaling the quan-
tity of labor demanded, as depicted in Exhibit 23.8. In this exhibit, the minimum wage 
is labeled with a line beneath it to signify that the minimum wage is a wage floor: w. In 
­Exhibit 23.8, the minimum wage, w, is above the market-clearing wage, w*. At the mini-
mum wage, w, the quantity of labor demanded by employers is less than the quantity of 
labor supplied by workers. Consequently, some workers—represented by the gap between 
the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded at w—aren’t able to find jobs. These 
unemployed workers are willing to work at the going wage, w, and would even be willing 
to work at wages lower than w. The minimum wage legislation prevents employers from 
Does technology cause unemployment? In a Phillips 
electronics factory in China, hundreds of employees work 
on an assembly line that manufactures electric shavers. 
Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, the same shavers are 
assembled by an army of 128 robotic arms. With video 
cameras for eyes and computer-calibrated hydraulics, 
these robots tirelessly go about their work. Robot-filled 
factories raise the possibility that technology can reduce 
a firm’s demand for labor. Throughout history, workers 
have complained about technological innovation that re-
duces employment.
The most famous episode began in 1811, when gangs 
of British textile workers started burning down factories 
and smashing newly invented mechanized looms. The 
rioters also targeted inventors and mill owners, burning 
down their homes and in one instance conducting an as-
sassination. These so-called Luddites—named after the 
worker Ned Ludd, who was reputed to have smashed 
textile machines several decades earlier—opposed 
the mechanization of production. The riots became 
so frequent and so destructive that the British army 
was called in to restore order. Dozens of rioters were 
hanged and the movement faded in 1813. Ultimately, 
the Luddites could not stop the mechanization of textile 
manufacturing.
Were new machines really destroying the livelihoods of 
the textile workers in 1811? The likely answer is yes. The 
new machines enabled workers to complete tasks in min-
utes that had previously taken hours. Consequently, the 
mills needed to employ fewer workers. Many skilled arti-
sans lost their jobs and their families suffered. So the Lud-
dites were not mistaken in believing that the ­machines 
were putting some of them out of work.
Technological progress can destroy jobs in a single 
industry such as textiles. However, historical evidence 
shows that technological progress does not produce un-
employment in a country as a whole. Technological prog-
ress increases productivity and incomes in the overall 
economy, and higher incomes lead to higher demand 
for goods and thus higher demand for labor. As a result, 
workers who lose jobs in one industry will be able to find 
jobs in others, although for many of them this might take 
time and some of them, like the Luddites, will end up with 
lower wages in their new jobs.
Today, the term Luddite is synonymous with opposi-
tion to new technology. The British textile workers of 
1811 were unlucky. They were victims of technological 
progress. For most people, however, ongoing tech-
nological progress improves their lives by raising their 
productivity and lowering the cost of the goods and ser-
vices they buy.

hiring these workers at wages that would equalize the quantity of labor supplied and the 
quantity of labor demanded.
Minimum wage laws are an example of a policy that creates winners and losers. The win-
ners are the workers who get jobs at wages above the wage that equates quantity supplied 
and quantity demanded. The losers are the firms that have to pay the higher wage and the 
unemployed who would like to work but can’t find a job at the prevailing wage, w. The costs 
and benefits of the minimum wage are actively debated, with economists divided on 
the question of whether the United States should raise its minimum wage.
The minimum wage produces structural unemployment, but it cannot be the 
only cause of unemployment. For example, in January 2014, there were 1.6 million 
college graduates who were unemployed. The median hourly wage for a college 
graduate was $29.85 per hour in 2013, four times the level of the minimum wage. 
Because almost all college graduates are paid far more than the minimum wage, it 
is not the minimum wage that prevents the labor market for college graduates from 
clearing.
In the overall workforce, including all education levels, 1.0 percent of workers are 
paid the minimum wage. Accordingly, the impact of the minimum wage on the labor 
market is modest. The minimum wage does prevent the market for some types of 
low-skilled workers from clearing but has little impact on the general labor market.
Labor Unions and Collective Bargaining
Another source of wage rigidity is collective bargaining, which refers to the con-
tract negotiations that take place between firms and labor unions. A labor union is 
an organization of workers that advocates for better working conditions, pay, and 
benefits for its members. Unions use the threat of going on strike—a mass work 
­stoppage—as a bargaining chip in these negotiations. Collective bargaining often 
leads to equilibrium wages and benefits that are greater than what workers would 
have received under the market-clearing wage. Collective bargaining has the same 
effect on unemployment as minimum wage laws that we saw in Exhibit 23.8. By 
keeping the equilibrium wage above the market-clearing wage, unions cause the 
quantity of labor supplied to be greater than the quantity of labor demanded, thus creating 
structural unemployment. Through such collective bargaining, unions benefit their mem-
bers but make it difficult for non-members to find work.
However, just like the minimum wage, collective bargaining is unlikely to be the most 
important factor causing wage rigidity in the U.S. labor market because union member-
ship is relatively low in the United States. For example, in 2011, 10.6 ­percent of employed 
workers in the United States were members of labor unions. Unions play a more important

role in most other countries. For example, in Italy, in 2011, 35.2 percent of employed work-
ers were members of labor unions.
Efficiency Wages and Unemployment
In 1914, Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, seemed to go bonkers. Out 
of the blue, Ford increased the daily wage of most of his employees from $2.34 to $5.00. 
Why would a profit-maximizing employer double his employees’ pay without any external 
pressure to do so?
Ford explained the wage of $5 per day as an act of self-interest. There was “no charity 
in any way involved,” he said. “We wanted to pay these wages so that the business would 
be on a lasting foundation. We were building for the future.”
In a frictionless, competitive labor market, paying an above-market wage (or above the 
wage that workers would accept) would not be optimal for a firm—in other words, it would 
not maximize the firm’s profits. In such a “perfect” market, the firm knows everything about 
its workers and observes everything that they do at work. In this idealized environment, there 
is no need to pay workers more than the market wage to ­obtain their labor. But in actual 
markets, where workers can shirk (slack off) on the job, paying more than the going wage 
can have benefits for the firm. Ford’s wage premium is an example of what economists call 
efficiency wages. By paying wages above the wage that workers were willing to accept (and 
in fact above the market wage), Ford was able to increase the productivity and profitability of 
his company.
Efficiency wages increase productivity and firm profitability for a number of reasons. 
First, efficiency wages reduce worker turnover. Working on an assembly line is monoto-
nous, causing a relatively high level of turnover. Recruiting and training new workers is 
costly to the company. If workers are paid more than the prevailing market wage by their 
employer, they are more motivated to keep their job because they would face lower wages if 
they needed to find a job elsewhere. Second, the fear of losing a high-paying job motivates 
employees to work harder than they otherwise would, increasing their hourly output. Third, 
there is the possibility that employees would be grateful for an above-market wage, lead-
ing them to reciprocate this apparent generosity by working harder—another boost to their 
hourly output. Finally, efficiency wages also improve the quality of the pool of workers who 
apply for a job in the first place.
If efficiency wages increase productivity, employers like Henry Ford might find it prof-
itable to pay a higher wage than the market-clearing wage. Like minimum wage laws and 
collective bargaining, this results in a form of wage rigidity. As before, this will cause the 
quantity of labor supplied to be greater than the quantity of labor demanded, leading to 
structural unemployment, just as we saw in Exhibit 23.8. One difference is worth noting, 
however. The minimum wage and collective bargaining force employers to pay a wage 
above the market-clearing wage level, whereas with efficiency wages, the equilibrium 
wage is above the market-clearing level because profit-maximizing firms voluntarily pre-
fer to pay such wages.
Downward Wage Rigidity and Unemployment Fluctuations
Another type of wage rigidity results from the fact that workers are highly averse to reduc-
tions in their wage, resulting in what economists call downward wage rigidity. Cuts in the 
wage hurt worker morale and lower productivity. As a result, most firms would rather fire 
workers than cut their wages. Typically, only firms on the brink of bankruptcy attempt to 
talk their workers into accepting wage reductions.
Downward wage rigidity, like the other forms of wage rigidity we have studied so 
far, causes wages to remain above the market-clearing level and causes structural unem-
ployment. To see this, consider the following scenario, depicted in Exhibit 23.9. Assume 
that the labor market begins in a competitive equilibrium with no unemployment (at the 
point labeled E1). Next, imagine that the labor demand curve shifts to the left because the 
economy slows down (we’ll have much more to say about why the economy fluctuates in 
Chapter 26).
Efficiency wages are above the 
wage that workers would accept, 
where the extra pay increases 
worker productivity and improves 
the profitability of the firm.
Downward wage rigidity arises 
when workers resist a cut in their 
wage.

When the wage is flexible, the leftward shift in labor demand moves the market to a new 
equilibrium (point F) in which the equilibrium wage is wF as shown in Exhibit 23.9, and the 
quantity of labor demanded falls to LF. The exhibit also shows that at this new equilibrium, 
the quantity of labor supplied is equal to the quantity of labor demanded and so unemploy-
ment is still equal to zero.
However, when the wage is rigid, it won’t fall to its market-clearing level and will in-
stead stay at its initial level, marked in Exhibit 23.9. This downward wage rigidity causes 
the quantity of labor supplied, which is still at L1, to be greater than the quantity of ­labor 
­demanded, which has now fallen to L2, thus leading to (structural) unemployment, as 
shown in­ ­Exhibit 23.9.
As we will see in more detail in Chapter 26, the downward wage rigidity depicted in 
Exhibit 23.9 is one of the causes of unemployment fluctuations. Recessions are periods of 
leftward (adverse) shifts in labor demand. This, combined with downward wage rigidity, 
increases the rate of unemployment.
The effect of downward wage rigidity can be seen in Exhibit 23.10, which shows 
the wage growth of workers in a large company for 2008, right in the middle of the 
2007–2009 recession.3 Each bar shows the fraction of workers whose wage grew by the 
percentage depicted on the horizontal axis. We see a large bulge in the distribution at zero, 
meaning that wages were frozen instead of being cut. Wage cuts were so infrequent (only 
46 out of 15,000 employees) that they are not even visible on the graph. Although the 
extent of downward wage rigidity does vary from company to company and industry to 
industry, this type of rigidity is overall quite pervasive throughout labor markets and can 
have a significant effect on unemployment, especially during recessions, as we will see in 
greater detail in Chapter 26.
The Natural Rate of Unemployment and Cyclical Unemployment
As we noted earlier, the U.S. economy always has some unemployment. In addition, 
the unemployment rate fluctuates considerably as shown in Exhibit 23.2. To distinguish  
the “normal” rate of unemployment from fluctuations around that normal rate, economists 
use the concept of the natural rate of unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment 
is the rate around which the actual rate of unemployment fluctuates. In practice, the natural 
rate of unemployment is calculated by averaging the unemployment rate over an extended

Exhibit 23.9 Shifts in Labor Demand Affect 
Equilibrium in the Labor Market
With flexible wages, a shift to the left in the 
­demand for labor reduces the equilibrium wage 
and employment (the economy moves from 
point E1 to point F). With a downward rigid wage, 
the same leftward shift has a larger impact on 
employment (the economy moves from point E1 
to point E2). ­Employment now falls all the way 
to L2 instead of LF, because none of the impact 
of the leftward shift in the labor demand curve 
is absorbed by the wage, which remains at its 
original (rigid) level. Moreover, downward wage 
rigidity causes unemployment: ­because the wage 
does not change, the quantity of labor supplied 
remains the same, but the quantity of labor de-
manded falls to L2. The gap between the quan-
tity of labor supplied and the quantity of labor 
demanded (at the rigid wage) corresponds to  
unemployment.
The natural rate of unemployment 
is the rate around which the actual 
rate of unemployment fluctuates.

time period. For example, in Spain, the unemployment rate has averaged 16.1 percent from 
1977 to 2013. In the United States, the unemployment rate has averaged 6.5 percent over 
the same period.
Cyclical unemployment is defined as the deviation of the unemployment rate from its 
natural rate. Cyclical unemployment usually rises in recessions (when the labor demand 
curve shifts to the left) and falls in economic booms (when the labor demand curve shifts 
to the right). Chapter 26 discusses the relationship between unemployment and economic 
fluctuations in depth.
In 2013, the Spanish unemployment rate was 26.1 percent, implying that cycli-
cal unemployment was 10.0 percent (using the natural rate of 16.1 percent). In 2013, 
the U.S. ­unemployment rate was 7.4 percent, implying that cyclical unemployment was 
0.9 percent (using the natural rate of 6.5 percent).
The natural rate of unemployment includes frictional unemployment, which is a neces-
sary part of any well-functioning labor market. But the natural rate of unemployment also 
includes long-term structural unemployment, which is generally considered to be economi-
cally inefficient. Accordingly, the natural rate of unemployment should not be confused 
with the rate of unemployment that is socially optimal or desirable—so some might say 
there is nothing “natural” about it. To see this, consider an economy that is subject to a 
significant level of downward wage rigidity. As Exhibit 23.9 shows, this economy will 
have a relatively high level of structural unemployment and this will increase the long-
term average rate of unemployment. This is not a desirable state of affairs, because many 
potential workers who could have been gainfully employed are out of work and are unable 
to use their labor productively. This example illustrates that the long-term average rate of 
unemployment—the natural rate of unemployment—includes some inefficient sources of 
unemployment.
Just as the natural rate of unemployment has both frictional and structural compo-
nents, so does cyclical unemployment. During recessions, fewer firms try to hire new 
workers, and this increases the difficulty that workers face in locating a suitable job, 
raising frictional unemployment. In addition, as Exhibit 23.9 shows, in the presence of 
downward wage rigidity, the leftward shift of the labor demand curve during a recession 
leads to a rise in structural unemployment as the rigid wage remains above the market-
clearing wage.

rom 1990 to 2007, the unemployment rate in Pittsburgh fell by 1.8 percentage 
points. Pittsburgh had both good and bad economic news during this period, but 
one particularly lucky factor is that economic activity in Pittsburgh was concen-
trated in industries that were not highly exposed to Chinese imports. Pittsburgh special-
ized in industries such as paper, print, and metal products that had “low exposure” to 
competition from Chinese imports, meaning that across the entire U.S. economy these 
sectors experienced relatively slow growth of Chinese imports.

Eastern United States together with the Pittsburgh area in Exhibit 23.11, was very dif-
ferent between 1990 and 2007. In the Raleigh-Durham area, unemployment ­increased 
by 1.9 percentage points. In addition, many workers in this area are now out of the labor 
force because they have stopped looking for jobs entirely. One factor contributing to 
Raleigh-Durham’s weakening labor market was its specialization in industries such as 
textiles and apparel, electrical products, and computers that have “high exposure” to 
competition from Chinese imports.
By comparing hundreds of regions with different levels of exposure to Chinese im-
ports (of which Pittsburgh and Raleigh-Durham are just two examples), economists ­David 
­Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson were able to identify leftward shifts in labor 
demand caused by high exposure to Chinese imports, similar to the shift in Exhibit 23.9.4 
Their analysis shows that high-exposure communities experienced sharper declines in 
manufacturing employment than low-exposure communities. The rate of unemployment 
also rose more in the areas with high exposure than those with low exposure.
The study confirms the model of labor market analysis depicted in Exhibit 23.9, 
in which a leftward shift in the labor demand curve, combined with downward wage

have had very different changes 
in their local unemployment rate 
between 1990 and 2007. ­Pittsburgh 
saw its unemployment rate decline 
from 7.3 percent to 5.5 percent, 
while Raleigh-Durham ­experienced 
an increase in its ­unemployment 
rate from 4.0 ­percent to

at least partially because Raleigh-­

rigidity, reduces the number of jobs and increases the rate of unemployment. Consistent 
with the model’s predictions about wage rigidity, the authors found no decline in man-
ufacturing wages despite the leftward shifts in labor demand. It is therefore likely that 
some of the higher unemployment in high-exposure areas was due to wage rigidity, as in 
­Exhibit 23.9. However, the authors also find a significant decline in non-manufacturing 
wages in high-exposure areas, confirming that wage rigidity only applies to a worker’s 
­existing job and does not carry over to the new jobs that unemployed workers find. Laid-off 
manufacturing workers are offered lower wages when they search for new jobs, and they 
are willing to accept those lower wages to find work.
This analysis might lead you to conclude that the United States should ban Chinese 
imports to increase U.S. employment, but doing so would generate far more problems than 
it would solve. Chinese imports are beneficial to most U.S. households, which enjoy the 
lower prices of the imported goods. Nevertheless, it is true that some domestic workers lose 
their jobs due to international trade, and much of the debate about trade revolves around 
the personal and economic dislocation caused by these job losses and the policies that can 
be used to mitigate these costs. We return to these important issues in Chapters 28 and 29, 
where we provide a full discussion of the effects of international trade.

What happens to employment 
and unemployment if local 
employers go out of business?
Summary
Potential workers are defined as the civilian non-institutional population 
ages 16 and older. Those holding a paid full-time or part-time job are classified 
as employed, while those without a paid job who have actively looked for 
work in the prior 4 weeks and are currently available for work are unemployed. 
Potential workers who are employed and unemployed make up the labor force, 
while the rest of the potential workers are classified as out of the labor force. The 
unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.
The unemployment rate fluctuates significantly over time. It is higher during 
and in the immediate aftermath of recessions.
Different demographic groups have different unemployment rates. For 
example, more educated workers tend to have lower unemployment rates.

	
Key Terms
593
Employment is determined by labor demand and labor supply. The labor 
demand curve is downward-sloping because of the diminishing marginal product 
of labor and profit maximization by firms. The labor supply curve, on the other 
hand, tends to be upward-sloping because higher wages generally encourage 
workers to supply more hours to the labor market.
The competitive labor market equilibrium is given by the intersection of the 
labor demand and labor supply curves. The competitive equilibrium wage is also 
called the market-clearing wage.
In a competitive labor market equilibrium in which all workers know the 
market-clearing wage, there will be no unemployment because every worker 
willing to work at the market-clearing wage can find a job. Workers who are not 
willing to work at the market-clearing wage will stop searching and will therefore 
not be counted as unemployed.
Frictional unemployment exists because workers need to learn about the 
condition of the labor market and search for a job that suits them. Even in a 
healthy labor market, there will always be some unemployed workers in the 
process of changing jobs, or finding a new job after losing their previous one, or 
finding their first job after entry into the labor market. Structural unemployment 
results when the market wage is above the market-clearing level, causing the 
quantity of labor supplied to be greater than the quantity of labor demanded. This 
is often referred to as wage rigidity and can result from institutional features of 
the labor market like minimum wage legislation or collective bargaining. More 
importantly, it can result from efficiency wages or from downward wage rigidity.
Efficiency wages arise when employers pay wages higher than the market-
clearing wage to increase worker productivity. Downward wage rigidity arises 
because of the unwillingness of workers to accept wage cuts and prevents wages 
from immediately falling in response to a leftward shift of the labor demand 
curve.
The most important cause of unemployment fluctuations is a shifting labor 
demand curve. When wages are flexible, a shift to the left of the labor demand 
curve reduces both employment and wages but does not increase unemployment 
because the labor market clears. When wages are rigid, the same leftward shift 
creates a larger decline in employment because the wage does not decline and 
unemployment increases.
The natural rate of unemployment is the long-term average rate of 
unemployment. Cyclical unemployment is the difference between the current rate 
of unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment. Cyclical unemployment 
is positive in recessions and negative in economic booms.

change in the unemployment rate? What could pos-
sibly explain this?
	
b.	 Use the data on the size of the labor force and poten-

measurable economic variable that changes prior to when 
the economy as a whole starts to follow a given trend. 
Conversely, a “lagging indicator” is a measurable vari-
able that only changes in the latter phases of an overall 
trend in the economy—or even afterwards.

Research (NBER), four researchers looked at the effect of 
generous unemployment benefits on the local unemploy-
ment rate. They compared the unemployment situation in 
adjoining counties, which happened to lie in two different 
states with different laws regarding the amount and dura-
tion of unemployment benefits.
The authors of the study found that the unemployment 
rate “rises dramatically in the border counties belonging to 
the states that expanded unemployment benefit duration” 
during the Great Recession. Why might this be so? (Based

of unemployment (seasonally adjusted) in the most 
recent month. Based on what you find, is 17 months 
higher or lower than average?

KEY IDEAS
The credit market matches borrowers (the source of credit demand)  
and savers (the source of credit supply).
The credit market equilibrium determines the real interest rate.
Banks and other financial intermediaries have three key functions: 
identifying profitable lending opportunities; using short-run deposits to make 
long-run investments; and managing the amount and distribution of risk.
Banks become insolvent when the value of their liabilities exceeds  
the value of their assets.
You’ve got your first business idea and you can’t think about much else. You are going to 
be the founder and CEO (chief executive officer) of your own company. OK. Catch your 
breath. And get down to work. Most new businesses fail within 5 years, and you are going 
to do everything that you can to avoid becoming one of those casualties.
You want to create a taxi and limo company that uses only vehicles that are 100 percent 
battery powered, just the sort of thing you reckon would appeal to your fellow New ­Yorkers. 
You call your new firm BatteryPark. Everyone you know loves the idea and promises to 
use your start-up if you manage to get it off the ground. You’ve even been able to convince 
numerous local companies to sign up for your service for their employees and clients.
Now you need to raise money to buy or rent the necessary equipment and buildings: 
licenses, electric vehicles, battery-charging systems, a reservation office with computers, 
and a few garages spread around the city so that your taxis can easily get a fresh battery 
when they run out of juice. You also need to hire staff, train them, and advertise. You ­figure 
you need about $500,000 to start your business and quickly reach an efficient scale of 
operation. That’s not a trivial amount by any stretch of the imagination, but you think it’s 
worth taking the risk, considering what you expect to make from your new business.
But how will you raise $500,000? You certainly don’t have it in your checking account, 
and neither do any of your friends. You think of asking your parents and grandparents, but 
then you imagine how you would feel if your business went south and a family member lost 
his or her life savings. So what’s the solution?
Borrowers and the Demand for Loans
The good news is that you are not alone in your quest for funds. Every year, hundreds of 
thousands of entrepreneurs in the United States and millions around the world borrow 
money to start new businesses. Many, many more businesses that are already in operation 
also borrow funds to expand their existing operations or simply to pay their bills.
Consumers, too, borrow to purchase big-ticket items like automobiles and houses. Some 
households borrow to sustain their quality of life during a temporary period of unemploy-
ment. Many people borrow to put themselves or their children through college. Almost 
­everyone who pursues graduate studies in business, law, or medicine borrows to pay some 
of their bills. We refer to economic agents who borrow funds—including entrepreneurs, 
home buyers, and medical students—as debtors. And the funds that they borrow are 
­referred to as credit.
What Is the Credit Market?
24.1 
Debtors, or borrowers, are 
economic agents who borrow funds.
Credit refers to the loans that the 
debtor receives.

600	
Chapter 24  |  Credit Markets
24.2
24.3
24.1
Most businesses and individuals obtain credit from banks, but the credit market is much 
broader than banks. It includes several non-bank institutions, as well as the market for commer-
cial debt, where well-established, large businesses obtain large loans.
Of course, borrowed money is not lent for free. You need to pay interest. The original 
amount of borrowed money is referred to as principal. The interest rate is the additional 
payment, above and beyond the repayment of principal, that a borrower needs to make on a 
one-dollar loan (at the end of one year). We can also say that the interest rate is the annual 
cost of a one-dollar loan.
Let’s now scale up that one-dollar loan into an $L loan. The total interest payment a 
borrower needs to make for an $L loan is the loan amount multiplied by the interest rate. 
Put differently, if you borrow $L with a one-year loan at an annual interest rate of i, at the 
end of one year you pay back the L dollars of principal plus i × L dollars in interest. To 
distinguish it from the real interest rate, which we define next, we’ll also refer to the inter-
est rate, i, as the nominal interest rate.
Let’s now return to your blockbuster business idea. You have enough confidence in 
your plans that you would be willing to pay a 10 percent interest rate to get your loan. 
That means you would be willing to make an annual interest payment of $50,000 to get a 
$500,000 loan ($500,000 × 0.10 = $50,000). In fact, you are so confident that you would 
take the loan even if you had to pay 20 percent interest.
But what if the interest rate were 50 percent? An interest payment of $250,000 per year 
on a $500,000 loan is a bit steep. At that interest rate, there won’t be much profit left for 
you. Perhaps you should scale back your plans and take a smaller loan. Instead of hiring a 
large team of 20 employees, you might want to start with just a few coworkers.
And what if the interest rate were 100 percent? Principal plus interest one year later 
would then be $500,000 + $500,000 = $1,000,000 on a $500,000 loan. That is, you would 
need to pay back twice as much as you borrowed. If so, it might make sense for you to for-
get about this new idea altogether. It’s hard to imagine that any business could make money 
if it had to finance itself this way.
In reality, most businesses do not need to pay 50 percent or 100 percent interest rates 
on loans. We present such cases to explain why a rise in the interest rate causes a fall in the 
quantity of credit demanded. As the interest rate goes up, fewer firms and individuals are 
willing to pay the high price to acquire credit.
Real and Nominal Interest Rates
The real annual price of your loan isn’t simply given by the nominal interest rate you pay, 
for example the 10 percent, 20 percent, 50 percent, or 100 percent we have just mentioned. 
Instead, it is given by the real interest rate, r. The real interest rate is the nominal inter-
est rate minus inflation. The inflation rate measures how much less valuable one dollar 
becomes because of the increase in the overall price level.
The relationship between the nominal and real interest rate is very similar to the rela-
tionship between nominal and real GDP growth, which we studied in Chapter 19. To turn 
nominal GDP growth into real GDP growth, we need to subtract the inflation rate from 
nominal GDP growth. Similar logic applies to the relationship between the nominal and 
the real interest rate:
Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate − Inflation rate.
Or using symbols,
r = i − π,
where r is the real interest rate, i is the nominal interest rate, and 
π denotes the rate of inflation. Economists call this the Fisher equa-
tion, naming it after Irving Fisher (1867–1947) whose research 
emphasized the distinction between the nominal and real interest 
rates.1 Here is an example of the Fisher equation in action. If the 
nominal interest rate is 5 percent and the inflation rate is 2 percent, 
then the real interest rate is
3% = 5% − 2%.
The interest rate (also referred to as 
the nominal interest rate), i, is the 
annual cost of a one-dollar loan, so 
i × L is the annual cost of an $L loan.
The real interest rate is given by 
the nominal interest rate minus the 
inflation rate.
Optimizing economic agents will 
use the real interest rate, r, when 
­thinking about the economic cost  
of a loan.

24.1
Why will optimizing economic agents use the real interest rate, r, when thinking about the 
economic cost of a loan? If you borrow one dollar for a year, you will need to pay back (1 + i) 
dollars in a year. Inflation implies that each dollar that you borrowed (and spent) at the begin-
ning of the year has the same purchasing power as (1 + π) dollars a year later because the infla-
tion rate is π. It would be misleading to compare a dollar paid back at the end of the year to a 
dollar with more purchasing power borrowed at the ­beginning of the year. Optimizers recognize 
that they should compare what they pay back at the end of the year to what they borrowed at 
the beginning of the year, adjusting the dollars they borrowed for a year’s worth of inflation. 
In essence, the relevant real price of the loan is the difference between what the borrower pays 
back (1 + i) and the inflation-adjusted value of the dollar he or she originally borrowed, (1 + π):
(1 + i) − (1 + π) = i − π.
Recall that the real interest rate is i − π, which appears on the right-hand side of the last 
equation. We have shown that the real interest rate is equal to the difference between what 
the borrower pays back and the inflation-adjusted value of the dollar he or she originally 
borrowed. The real interest rate is the real (inflation-adjusted) cost of a $1 loan. (In the next 
chapter we will return to this equation and discuss the role of inflationary expectation in 
thinking about the real interest rate.)
The Credit Demand Curve
Because it is the real interest rate, r, that matters for business and individual decisions, 
the demand for credit will also be a function of this real interest rate. The credit demand 
curve is the schedule that reports the relationship between the quantity of credit demanded 
and the real interest rate.
Exhibit 24.1 plots the credit demand curve, with the quantity of credit demanded on 
the horizontal axis and the real interest rate on the vertical axis. The credit demand curve 
slopes downward because the higher the real interest rate, the lower the quantity of credit 
demanded. As BatteryPark’s demand for credit illustrates, the higher the interest rate a firm 
pays to borrow money, the lower the borrower’s profit. So, fewer borrowers will be willing 
to obtain a loan at a higher interest rate. This is conceptually the same as other demand 
curves: when the price of any good—like carrots or caviar—goes up, consumers tend to 
buy less of it. Credit works the same way, where the real “price” of credit is the real interest 
rate. The steepness of the credit demand curve tells us about the sensitivity of the relation-
ship between the real interest rate and the quantity of credit demanded.
	
1.	 When the credit demand curve is relatively steep, the quantity of credit demanded 
doesn’t change that much in response to variation in the real interest rate.
	
2.	 When the credit demand curve is relatively flat, the quantity of credit demanded is 
relatively sensitive to variation in the real interest rate.
The credit demand curve is 
the schedule that reports the 
relationship between the quantity 
of credit demanded and the real 
interest rate.

Banks play the role of middlemen, 
matching savers and borrowers.
Having emphasized that the real interest rate is the price that appears on the vertical 
axis of Exhibit 24.1—you can think of it as the price of borrowing money—it is important 
to remember that almost all loans are made at a nominal interest rate. For example, banks 
quote a nominal interest rate when you apply for a mortgage. Businesses also borrow at a 
nominal interest rate when they take out a loan. However, what is relevant for the decisions 
of an optimizer is the implied real interest rate. The real interest rate will play a central 
role in macroeconomic analysis in the next several chapters, especially the real interest 
rate for long-term borrowing (like 30-year mortgages or 10-year corporate loans). For now, 
we focus on the relationship between the real interest rate and the demand for credit. We 
return to the nominal interest rate and its relationship to the real interest rate in the next 
chapter. When using the credit demand curve it is important to draw a very careful dis-
tinction ­between movements along the credit demand curve, as in Exhibit 24.1, and shifts 
of the credit ­demand curve. You have already encountered this distinction when we first 
introduced it in Chapter 4, and it still applies here. Exhibit 24.2 illustrates shifting demand 
curves. Many factors cause the demand curve to shift:
• Changes in perceived business opportunities for firms. Businesses borrow to fund 
their expansions. For example, if an airline like United Airlines notices that more and 
more travelers are trying to buy plane tickets, then United’s demand for airplanes 
will increase. United will then have to borrow money to buy or lease more planes, 
so its credit demand curve will shift to the right. If other businesses are experiencing 
similar trends and increasing their demand for credit at a given real interest rate, then 
the market (or aggregate) credit demand curve will shift to the right.
• Changes in household preferences or expectations. Households borrow for many 
reasons: buying a home, a car, that gargantuan flat-screen TV, or paying college 
­tuition bills. If household preferences change so that they would like to consume 
more of these goods and services, they will tend to borrow more. Likewise, they’ll 
be more willing to borrow when they grow more optimistic about the future, for ex-
ample, because they expect that they’ll be in a good position to pay back those loans 
later. Such changes in household preferences or expectations shift the market credit 
demand curve to the right. Likewise, if households become more pessimistic about 
the future, then they will cut their desired borrowing at each interest rate, shifting the 
market credit demand curve to the left.
• Changes in government policy. Government borrowing in the credit market can swing 
violently from year to year. For example, in 2007 the U.S. federal government ran a def-
icit of $0.4 trillion, which implies that it borrowed $0.4 trillion on the credit market. As 
the 2007–2009 recession deepened, household and business income fell; this situation 
in turn reduced tax revenues collected by the government. At the same time, govern-
ment spending rose both to help out struggling families and to stimulate the contracting 
economy. By 2009, the government deficit was $1.5 trillion. Holding all else equal, an 
increase in government borrowing shifts the market credit demand curve to the right. 
(By 2013, the federal government deficit had shrunk to $0.8 trillion, representing a 
substantial reversal from 2009.) Finally, the government’s tax policies can also shift 
the credit demand curve. Sometimes the government stimulates investment in physi-
cal capital by lowering taxes on profits or explicitly introducing subsidies for physical 
capital investment, thereby shifting the market credit demand curve to the right.
Saving Decisions
Banks provide credit to businesses and households that wish to borrow. But where do banks 
obtain the money that they lend out?
Other economic agents with excess cash have deposited their 
money in the bank. In this sense, banks play the role of middlemen, 
matching savers and borrowers. Banks aren’t the only middlemen 
in the market for credit. Many different kinds of ­institutions—we 
provide a partial list later in this chapter—play the critical role of 
linking people with savings to people or firms who want to use 
those savings.
Let’s momentarily ignore the institutions that serve as the middlemen and focus on 
the depositors—in other words, the savers—who are the initial source of the funds that 

24.2
24.3
	
Section 24.1  |  What Is the Credit Market?
603
24.1
borrowers will ultimately receive. Savers have money that they are willing to lend 
out because they prefer to spend it in the future rather than today. Of course, they 
could keep their money under a mattress or bury it under a palm tree on a deserted 
island. But buried treasure doesn’t pay interest.
The Credit Supply Curve
People and firms with saved money obtain interest by lending the money to a bank 
or some other financial institution. In some cases, this “lending” takes the form of 
depositing the money at the bank in return for interest on a savings ­account. How 
much money are the savers willing to lend in this way? To answer this question, we 
need to understand the optimizing behavior of savers.
Saving results from a natural trade-off: people can spend their income on 
­consumption today or can save it for consumption in the future. Because saving 
requires giving something up—current consumption—people will only save if they 
get something worthwhile in return. The real interest rate is the compensation that 
people receive for saving their money because a dollar saved today has 1 + r ­dollars 
of purchasing power in a year, where r is the real interest rate. Put differently, the 
real interest rate is the opportunity cost of current ­consumption—what you are giv-
ing up in terms of future purchasing power. ­Consequently, a higher real interest rate 
increases the opportunity cost of current consumption and ­encourages a higher level 
of saving.
On the other hand, a higher real interest rate might actually lower the sav-
ing rate. For example, if the real interest rate is relatively high, savings put 
aside when a person is young will grow relatively quickly, enabling a young 
worker to save less while still achieving a long-run goal of accumulating a retirement 
nest egg of a certain targeted size. Note, though, in most situations this negative ­effect 
on saving is thought to be weaker than the (positive) opportunity cost effect discussed 
above. In other words, for most people, a higher real interest rate induces a higher ­ 
saving rate.
Exhibit 24.2 Shifts in the Credit Demand Curve
Changes in perceived business opportunities for firms, changes in household 
­preferences or expectations, and changes in government policy may decrease the 
quantity of credit demanded for a fixed level of the real interest rate, shifting the 
credit demand curve to the left (panel (a)). When they increase the quantity of credit 
demanded for a fixed level of the real interest rate, the credit demand curve shifts to 
the right (panel (b)).

There are five key reasons that people save for the future.
	
1.	First and foremost, people save for retirement. 
When you retire, you’ll only receive a fraction of 
the income that you received during working life. 
For example, the Social Security program pays the 
­typical U.S. household a bit less than half of the 
household’s preretirement income. If you don’t 
want your consumption to fall sharply when you 
­retire, you’ll need to save some of your preretire-
ment income. Most advisers recommend that 
working households in the United States contrib-
ute 10 percent to 20 percent of their income to a 
retirement savings account—for instance a 401(k) 
account or an IRA (Individual Retirement Account).
	
2.	People save “for their kids,” for example, for their 
weddings or their future educational investments 
like college and postgraduate school. A small 
fraction of parents also leave significant amounts 
of money to their kids in their wills. (Such gifts are 
called bequests.)
	
3.	People save to pay for predictable large expenses, 
like a home purchase, durable goods (for instance, 
a washing machine or a car), and vacations.
	
4.	People save so they can invest in a personal busi-
ness. Small businesses sometimes can’t obtain 
loans from banks. The bank’s loan officer might 
not believe in your latest, greatest business idea. 
(If you were a bank’s loan officer, would you give 
a loan to a recent college graduate with a plan to 
open a new taxi and limo service like BatteryPark?) 
In cases where outside funding can’t be obtained, 
small business owners must use their own savings 
to fund their breakthrough ideas.
	
5.	People save for a “rainy day.” Your roof might 
spring a leak and require an expensive repair. You 
might lose your job. You might have a large medi-
cal expense that is not covered by insurance. In 
­situations like these, you’ll need a fund that you can 
lean on to get through hard times.
CHOICE & CONSEQUENCE
Why Do People Save?
Exhibit 24.3 The Credit 
Supply Curve
The quantity of credit 
supplied is plotted on the 
horizontal axis and the 
real interest rate is plot-
ted on the vertical axis. 
As the real interest rate 
rises, the quantity of credit 
supplied increases. This 
is a ­movement along the 
credit supply curve.
The credit supply curve is the 
schedule that reports the relationship 
between the quantity of credit 
supplied and the real interest rate.
This leads us to conclude that the credit supply curve, which is the schedule that 
r­eports the relationship between the quantity of credit supplied and the real interest rate, is 
upward-sloping. Specifically, a higher real interest rate encourages more saving, increasing 
the amount of funds that banks can lend and thereby increasing the quantity of credit sup-
plied. Exhibit 24.3 plots the credit supply curve.
As before, it’s important to carefully distinguish between movements along the credit 
supply curve, as in Exhibit 24.3, and shifts of the credit supply curve, as in Exhibit 24.4. 
Movements along the supply curve correspond to savers’ response to changes only in the

Changes in the saving motives of households or firms may decrease the quantity 
of credit supplied for a fixed level of the real interest rate, shifting the credit sup-
ply curve to the left (panel (a)). When households and firms increase the quantity

shifts to the right (panel (b)).
real interest rate. Shifts in the credit supply curve are driven by changes in the saving mo-
tives of optimizing economic agents, holding fixed the real interest rate.
• Changes in the saving motives of households. As discussed above, households save 
for many reasons—like retirement—but these motives change over time, shifting the 
credit supply curve. For example, if households start to predict economic hard times 
ahead, they will save more because they want to build up a store of wealth to be bet-
ter prepared. This shifts the credit supply curve to the right. Likewise, ­demographic 
trends can change the savings behavior of households. For example, as households 
approach the age of retirement their saving rate tends to rise.
• Changes in the saving motives of firms. A firm has positive earnings if its 
­expenses—including the cost of paying employees—are less than the firm’s revenue. 
Some firms pass such earnings back to their stockholders—for example, by paying 
shareholder dividends. But some firms retain these earnings, depositing them in the 
firm’s bank account and saving them for future investment. The magnitude of such 
retained earnings shifts over time. When firms are nervous about their ability to fund 
their business activities in the future, they tend to hold on to more retained earnings 
instead of paying them out as dividends. This shifts the credit supply curve to the 
right, another form of saving for a rainy day.
Equilibrium in the Credit Market
Exhibit 24.5 plots both the credit supply curve and the credit demand curve. This completes 
our picture of the credit market, where borrowers obtain funds from savers. It is some-
times referred to as the loanable funds market.
We’ve simplified the credit market by assuming that different borrowers all have identical 
risks of defaulting on their loan. In other words, all borrowers have the same risk of not repay-
ing their loan. This simplification implies that there will be a single equilibrium real interest 
rate in the credit market. (In actual markets, borrowers with different risks of defaulting face 
different real interest rates to compensate lenders for these differential default risks.)
The credit market is where 
borrowers obtain funds from savers.

Like other markets represented by a supply curve and a demand curve, the equilib-
rium in the credit market is the point at which the curves intersect. This intersection deter-
mines both the total quantity of credit in the market (Q*) and the equilibrium real interest 
rate (r*). At the equilibrium real interest rate, the quantity of credit demanded is equal to 
the quantity of credit supplied. A real interest rate above this level would lead to an excess 
supply of credit, which would typically put downward pressure on the real interest rate. 
A real interest rate below the equilibrium level would lead to an excess demand for credit, 
creating upward pressure on the real interest rate.
To see this in action, consider how a shift in the credit demand curve affects the credit 
market equilibrium, as shown in Exhibit 24.6. For example, assume that the government in-
troduces a tax credit for business investment expenditures so that every dollar a firm invests 
by building plants or purchasing equipment reduces the taxes that it owes by 30 cents. Such 
a tax credit reduces the cost of investment to firms and thus raises the net benefit—benefits 
­minus costs—of investment. As a consequence, an optimizing firm’s willingness to borrow 
in the credit market (to fund investment in plants and equipment) will increase. Conse-
quently, the credit demand curve shifts to the right. The new equilibrium point has a higher 
real interest rate (r**) and a greater quantity of credit supplied and demanded (Q**).

24.2
Credit Markets and the Efficient Allocation  
of Resources
Credit markets play an extremely valuable social role. By ­enabling 
savers to lend their excess money to borrowers, the credit market 
improves the allocation of resources in the economy.
There is a simple way of seeing this. Suppose there was no 
credit market and you had $1,000 you wanted to save for next 
year. What could you do with it? You could put it in a safe box 
in your house—“putting the money under your mattress”—in which case you would just 
have $1,000 next year. With no inflation, you will have received a real interest rate of zero. 
If there is inflation, say 5 percent, then the real interest rate you will have received is much 
worse, −5 percent, because inflation eroded 5 percent of the purchasing power of your 
money.
We can also work through these examples by using the Fisher equation, which gives 
the formula for the real interest rate: r = i − π. If you receive no nominal interest (so 
i = 0), then the real interest rate is r = 0 − π. When the inflation rate is zero (so π = 
0 ­percent), the real interest rate is r = 0 − 0 = 0 percent. When the inflation rate is 5 percent  
(so π = 5 percent), then the real interest rate is r = 0 − 5 = −5 percent.
You might do better than a 0 percent nominal interest rate by lending your money to 
your uncle who has some business venture in mind. But unless your uncle happens to be a 
good businessman, this choice might be worse than the mattress option.
Unknown to you, there could be several borrowers (possibly more reliable than your 
uncle!) who need that $1,000 for their investment. Without credit markets, they would also 
suffer because many of them would not be able to raise the necessary funds.
The valuable social role of credit markets is to match savers like you with borrowers. 
When credit markets work, you will get a reasonable return on your $1,000 saving (typi-
cally an average real return of 1 percent to 5 percent depending on how much risk you 
take), and worthy potential borrowers will be able to raise the funds they need.
By enabling savers to lend their ex-
cess money to borrowers, the credit 
market improves the allocation of 
resources in the economy.
Banks and Financial 
Intermediation: Putting Supply 
and Demand Together
Banks and other financial institutions are the economic agents connecting supply and demand 
in the credit market. Think of it this way: when you deposit your money in a bank account, 
you do not know who will ultimately use it. The bank pools all of its deposits and uses 
this pool of money to make many different kinds of loans: credit card loans to households; 
mortgages to home buyers; small loans to entrepreneurs; and large loans to ­established  
companies like General Electric, Nike, and Ford. Banks even make loans to other banks 
that need cash.
Running a bank is a complicated operation, and, so far, we’ve taken it all for granted. 
When we talked about the market for credit in the last section, we assumed that the lend-
ers and borrowers could easily find each other. But in real life, matching lenders and 
borrowers is complex. Banks are the organizations that provide the bridge from lenders 
to borrowers, and because of this role, they are called financial intermediaries. Broadly 
speaking, financial intermediaries channel funds from suppliers of financial capital, like 
savers, to users of financial capital, like borrowers.
Financial capital comes in many different forms, including credit (which is also 
­referred to as debt) and equity. When a saver turns her savings into credit, she loans 
her savings to another party in exchange for the promise of repayment of her loan with 
interest. When a saver turns her savings into equity, she uses her savings to become a 
shareholder in a company, which means that she has obtained an ownership share and a 
claim on the future profits of the company. These profits are paid out as dividends to the 
company’s shareholders.

Assets and Liabilities on the Balance Sheet of a Bank
To understand what banks do, it helps to first look at a bank’s balance sheet, which sum-
marizes both its assets and its liabilities. Assets include the investments the bank has made, 
government securities the bank holds, and the money the bank is owed by borrowers, 
­including households and firms that have taken loans from the bank. The bank’s liabilities 
include claims that depositors and other lenders have against the bank. For example, when 
a household deposits $10,000 at a bank, that deposit is a liability for the bank—money that 
the bank owes to the depositor.
Accountants call this statement of assets and liabilities a balance sheet because it is set 
up so that the assets and liabilities are balanced one for one. Think of the words own and 
Banks Are Only One of Many Types of Financial Intermediaries
Many different types of financial institutions act as financial intermediaries, channeling 
funds from suppliers of financial capital—in other words, savers—to users of financial 
capital. In addition to banks, financial intermediaries include, but are not limited to, 
asset management companies, hedge funds, private equity funds, venture capital funds, 
bank-like businesses that comprise the “shadow banking system,” and even pawnshops 
and shops that give payday loans.
Asset management companies, like Blackrock, Fidelity, and Vanguard, enable 
­investors to use their savings to buy financial securities like stocks and bonds. When 
you buy a company’s stock, you are buying a share of ownership in that company. 
When you buy a bond, you are effectively lending money to the company that issued 
the bond. These stock and bond investments are often made through mutual funds, 
which are large, diversified pools of securities. The value of all mutual funds in the 
United States in 2012 was approximately $13 trillion.
Hedge funds are investment pools gathered from a small number of very wealthy 
individuals or institutions, like university endowments. Hedge funds tend to follow 
risky, nontraditional investment strategies, like buying large tracts of land that can be 
used to grow timber, or buying stock in companies that are in financial trouble and 
have recently experienced large drops in their stock value. Hedge funds charge fees 
that are much higher than those of mutual funds. The value of all hedge funds in the 
United States in 2012 was approximately $2 trillion.
Private equity funds are investment pools that also typically involve a small num-
ber of wealthy investors. Private equity funds hold securities that are not publicly 
traded, so you can’t buy them on a stock exchange. For instance, private equity funds 
might buy a company that is privately owned, like a family business. Alternatively, 
they might take a publicly traded company private by buying all of the shares in 
the company. The value of all private equity funds in the United States in 2012 was 
­approximately $3 trillion.
Venture capital funds are a particular kind of private equity fund. They invest in new 
companies that are usually just starting up and therefore have no track record. For instance, 
in 1999, two venture capital funds—Kleiner-Perkins and Sequoia Capital—invested  
$25 million in a start-up company with a funny name—Google—founded the previous 
year. That single investment is now worth over $25 billion, implying a 1,000-to-1 return 
on every dollar invested. However, venture capital is a highly risky type of financial inter-
mediation, and the typical venture capital firm didn’t make any money in the decade after 
the tech bubble burst in 2000. The value of all venture capital funds in the United States 
in 2012 was about $200 billion.
The shadow banking system is comprised of thousands of institutions that are not 
officially banks because they don’t take deposits, but nevertheless act like banks in the 
sense that they raise money and then make loans with those funds. Lehman Brothers, 
whose bankruptcy fueled the 2008 financial crisis, was one example of a shadow bank. 
Instead of taking common deposits, Lehman would take loans from large investors like 
insurance companies and use them to trade stocks and bonds, to make loans to busi-
nesses, and to create new financial products that they could sell to other institutions 
and wealthy investors.
Securities are financial contracts. 
For example, securities may allocate 
ownership rights of a company 
(stocks), or promise payments to 
lenders (bonds).

owe to clarify the balance sheet—the balance sheet states what the bank owns (assets) and 
what it owes (liabilities).
Exhibit 24.7 summarizes some key features of the balance sheet of Citibank at the end 
of 2013, following the convention of listing assets in the left-hand column and liabilities 
in the right-hand column. The right-hand column also lists stockholders’ equity, which is 
defined as total assets minus total liabilities and represents the value of the owners’ (stock-
holders’) stake in the company. Let’s look in a bit more detail at the key categories that 
make up the assets and liabilities of the balance sheet.
Assets  Citibank’s assets are simplified by being divided into three categories: reserves, 
cash and cash equivalents, and long-term investments.
	
1.	 Bank reserves include vault cash (dollars and coins held by Citibank in its own 
vault) and its holdings on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank, often called the Fed, 
which is a special bank that is an agency of the government and is used to regulate 
the entire monetary system. We have much, much more to say about the Fed in 
the next chapter. In Exhibit 24.7, Citibank’s reserves account for $294 billion of 
Citibank’s total assets.
	
2.	 Cash equivalents are riskless, liquid assets that Citibank can immediately access, 
like deposits with other banks. An asset is riskless if its value doesn’t change from 
day to day. An asset is liquid if it can quickly and easily be converted into cash, with 
little or no loss in value. In Exhibit 24.7, cash equivalents account for $192 billion 
of Citibank’s total assets.
	
3.	 Long-term investments mostly comprise loans to households and firms but also 
include things like the value of the real estate that the bank uses for its operations, 
such as its bank branches and corporate headquarters. Long-term investments ac-
count for $1,398 billion of Citibank’s total assets.
Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity  In Exhibit 24.7, Citibank’s liabilities and stock-
holders’ equity are divided into four categories: demand deposits, short-term borrowing, 
­long-term debt, and stockholders’ equity.
	
1.	 Demand deposits are funds “loaned” to the bank by depositors. Most depositors 
don’t think of this as a loan to a bank, but rather as a deposit to a checking account. 
These deposits are referred to as demand deposits because the depositor can access 
the funds on demand—meaning, at any time—by withdrawing the money from an 
ATM or bank teller, writing a check, or using a debit card to make a store purchase. 
Even though demand deposits are “cash in the bank,” so to speak, they are liabili-
ties from the perspective of Citibank, because it owes this money to its depositors. 
Citibank owes depositors $938 billion in demand deposits. We look at these more 
closely in the next section.
Official bank reserves consist of 
vault cash and deposits at the 
Federal Reserve Bank.
Demand deposits are funds that 
depositors can access on demand 
by withdrawing money from the 
bank, writing checks, or using their 
debit cards.
Exhibit 24.7 Citibank’s  
Balance Sheet, June 2013  
(billions of dollars)
Citibank’s balance sheet from 
June 2013 summarizes the as-
sets that the bank owns, as well 
as the claims that depositors and 
other ­financial intermediaries have 
against the bank—the bank’s liabili-
ties. Stockholders’ equity is defined 
as the difference between total as-
sets and total liabilities, so liabilities 
plus stockholders’ equity is exactly 
equal to the value of total assets.

2.	 Short-term borrowing comprises short-term loans that Citibank has obtained from 
other financial institutions. All of these loans need to be repaid in the next year, and 
many of these loans are overnight loans that Citibank needs to repay the next day! 
Usually, such overnight loans are rolled over from one day to the next, meaning 
that Citibank repays its overnight loans and then instantly arranges new overnight 
loans with the same lenders. Unfortunately, heavy reliance on short-term debt gen-
erates some fragility in the banking system. If lenders suddenly start to worry that 
­Citibank will have difficulty paying back short-term debt, Citibank might have 
trouble borrowing new funds and would therefore lack the funds it needs to con-
duct its day-to-day operations. Despite these risks, Citibank funds its operations by 
­borrowing $527 billion of such short-term debt.
	
3.	 Long-term debt is defined as debt that is due to be repaid in a year or more. Citibank has 
$221 billion in long-term debt, representing 13 percent of its liabilities. This proportion 
contrasts sharply with the asset side of the balance sheet, where nearly 75 percent of 
the assets are long-term. The difference between long-term debt and long-term assets 
introduces a source of risk for the bank—a topic that we explore later in this chapter.
	
4.	 Stockholders’ equity is defined as the difference between the bank’s total assets 
and total liabilities.
Stockholders’ equity = Total assets − Total liabilities.
This difference is equal to the estimated value of the company, or what the total value of 
Citibank’s shares should be worth if the accountants got everything right.
We can rearrange the identity for stockholders’ equity to find that
Total assets = Total liabilities + Stockholders’ equity.
Looking at this equation, you can see that the two sides (left and right) of the balance sheet 
match up. Given the way in which accountants define stockholders’ equity, the liability side 
of the balance sheet and the asset side of the balance sheet are always perfectly balanced.
What Banks Do
We can use the bank’s balance sheet to identify three interrelated functions that banks 
­perform as financial intermediaries.
	
1.	 Banks identify profitable lending opportunities.
	
2.	 Banks transform short-term liabilities, like deposits, into long-term investments in 
a process called maturity transformation.
	
3.	 Banks manage risk by using diversification strategies and also by transferring risk 
from depositors to the bank’s stockholders and, in some cases, to the U.S. government.
We discuss each of these three functions in turn.
Identifying Profitable Lending Opportunities
One of the main roles of banks is to find creditworthy borrowers and channel savings of de-
positors to them. Thus, banks bring together the two sides of the credit market. Banks are in 
a good position to do this because, given their willingness to lend, they attract a large number 
of would-be borrowers and choose the more creditworthy among them. Banks employ armies 
of investment specialists and loan officers trained in identifying the best loan applications.
Maturity Transformation
Recall from Exhibit 24.7 that 87 percent of Citibank’s liabilities, which are shown on the 
right-hand side of its balance sheet, are short-term (made up of demand deposits and short-
term borrowing), while nearly 75 percent of its assets, shown on the left-hand side, are long-
term investments. Citibank has transformed its short-term liabilities into long-term assets.
Maturity is the time until debt must be repaid. Demand deposits have a 0-year maturity, 
because the depositor can take back her money at any time. In contrast, when banks lend

Stockholders’ equity is the 
difference between a bank’s total 
assets and total liabilities.
Maturity refers to the time until 
debt must be repaid.

Section 24.3   |  What Banks Do

to borrowers, such loans usually have a maturity ranging from several years up to 30 years. 
The transfer of short-term liabilities like demand deposits into long-term investments is 
called maturity transformation.
Maturity transformation is what enables society to undertake significant long-term 
­investments. But it also implies that banks wind up with a mismatch between the short-
term maturities of their deposits and the long-term maturities of their loans. This maturity 
mismatch could get them into trouble if lots of depositors were to simultaneously ask 
to make withdrawals. Banks can’t simply recall their long-term loans if their short-term 
­depositors want their money back. To ensure that they can fulfill demands for withdrawals, 
banks do not lend out all of their deposits. They hold back some fraction of the deposit pool 
as ­reserves or some other form of cash-like security.
Banks have a large number of depositors, and typically only a tiny fraction of deposi-
tors demand their funds on any given day. Banks are also able to exploit the fact that with-
drawals of existing deposits and inflows of new deposits are roughly offsetting on most 
days. Banks therefore usually need only a small pool of reserves to meet the net withdraw-
als of deposits. This enables them to commit most of their demand deposits to long-term 
investments.
Management of Risk
A bank promises that depositors will never lose a penny. This is a striking promise, since 
the bank makes risky loans with the depositors’ savings. For example, banks often invest 
in mortgages—loans to households to purchase houses—which are risky. About 12 percent 
of the mortgages held by banks at the beginning of the 2007–2009 financial crisis ended up 
late on payments or in default.
Banks manage risk in two ways. First, they hold a diversified portfolio: a typical bank in-
vests not only in mortgages but in a diverse set of assets, including business loans, loans to 
other financial institutions, and government debt. A diversified portfolio is useful ­because 
all the diverse assets of the bank are unlikely to underperform at the same time.
But diversification by itself isn’t sufficient to manage risks because sometimes a large 
fraction of even a diverse set of assets may underperform. Most types of assets lost value 
during the 2007–2009 financial crisis. But even then, depositors remain safe, because of 
banks’ second strategy of risk management: shifting risk to stockholders, and ultimately, 
during severe financial crises, to the U.S. government.
To understand how risk is transferred, consider what happens to a simplified bank bal-
ance sheet after its long-term investments lose 10 percent of their value. To keep things 
simple, we analyze a bank with exactly $11 billion in assets, which is allocated to $1 billion 
in reserves and cash equivalents and $10 billion in long-term investments.

A bank becomes insolvent when the 
value of the bank’s assets is less than 
the value of its liabilities.
A bank is solvent when the value of 
the bank’s assets is greater than the 
value of its liabilities.
A bank run occurs when a bank 
experiences an extraordinarily large 
volume of withdrawals driven by a 
concern that the bank will run out 
of liquid assets with which to pay 
withdrawals.
A banking panic can be self-­fulfilling—
it feeds on itself.
decreased by 10 percent, or $1 billion. Second, the value of stockholders’ equity has been 
reduced by $1 billion. Recall that stockholders’ equity is defined as the difference between 
the value of assets and liabilities. Since the value of the demand deposits has not changed—
these are contractual promises from the bank to its depositors—but the value of the assets 
has declined by $1 billion, the value of stockholders’ equity must also fall by $1 billion.
This example illustrates that stockholders bear all of the risk that the bank faces, as long as 
stockholders’ equity is greater than zero. In other words, as long as the bank’s assets exceed 
its liabilities, every change in the value of the assets is absorbed one-for-one by stockholders.
When the value of the bank’s assets falls below the value of its liabilities, stockhold-
ers’ equity goes to zero. Now the bank owes more than it owns. At about that moment, the 
government shuts down the bank. The government bank regulator—the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC)—steps in and takes control of the bank. The FDIC will 
either (1) shut down the bank’s operations and make payouts to depositors or (2) transfer 
the bank to new ownership.
In the payout scenario, the FDIC takes over the assets of the bank and makes full payouts 
to all individuals with deposits at that bank up to a cap of $250,000; deposits up to $250,000 
are “FDIC-insured.” The FDIC may also make payouts for deposits in excess of $250,000  
if sufficient funds are available. However, most other creditors and all of the stockholders of 
the bank will be wiped out, meaning that they will receive nothing.
More often, however, the FDIC does not pay out to depositors, but instead arranges for 
a speedy takeover by a healthy bank. Bank takeovers usually protect all deposits—even 
those greater than $250,000—but in most cases, the stockholders are still wiped out. The 
next business day the bank opens for business as usual, though it might have a different 
name on the front door. If the failed bank’s depositors aren’t paying attention, they may 
miss the fact that anything has happened at all.
These maneuvers don’t always come cheap. In most cases, the failed bank has liabilities, prin-
cipally demand deposits, that exceed the value of its assets. In technical terms, the failed bank is 
insolvent, meaning that the value of its assets is less than the value of its liabilities. On the other 
hand, the healthy bank that is taking over the failed bank is solvent, meaning that the value of its 
assets is greater than the value of its liabilities. The healthy bank needs some financial induce-
ment to take over the operations of the failed bank. The FDIC has to provide this sweetener.
Bank failures during the financial crisis of 2007–2009 cost the FDIC over $100 billion. 
And the buck doesn’t stop there. Depositors at all U.S. banks implicitly pay for these bank 
failures because the FDIC raises its funds by charging all banks deposit insurance premi-
ums. All bank depositors, not just those at failed banks, end up indirectly paying to clean 
up the mess left in the wake of a bank failure.
Bank Runs
Though socially useful, the maturity and the risk transformation roles played by banks also 
create some risks. Most importantly, maturity transformation causes many of the bank’s 
assets to become illiquid—that is, by turning short-term liabilities into long-term, illiquid 
assets, the bank effectively locks up money that it might need to give back to depositors or 
other creditors on short notice.
During a banking panic, a substantial fraction of depositors may 
try to withdraw their deposits at the same time. If the bank has 
mostly long-term, illiquid assets, the bank may have a hard time 
coming up with the cash that it will need to pay out those with-
drawals. As word gets out that the bank’s cash is running low, more 
depositors will try to make withdrawals in the hope that they can 
get what little cash remains.
In this way a banking panic can be self-fulfilling—it feeds on itself. An unusually large 
amount of withdrawals reduces the bank’s cash, and this cash shortage begets even more with-
drawals as depositors race to withdraw their deposits before the bank runs out of cash. Even if a 
bank was healthy before the panic, it might no longer be healthy after losing many of its deposi-
tors and being forced to sell its illiquid assets in “fire sales” where the bank doesn’t get a good 
price for the assets because it doesn’t have enough time to find the buyers who are willing to 
pay the highest price. The expanding panic and rising flood of withdrawals is called a bank run.
Bank runs have various economic costs. Most importantly, a run forces a bank to liq-
uidate its long-term, illiquid assets prematurely. This sometimes involves abandonment

or inefficient liquidation of long-term investments in physi-
cal capital such as construction projects. In addition, since 
banks are key participants in the credit market, bank runs 
also disrupt the smooth working of the credit market.
Bank runs occurred in different forms during the most recent 
financial crisis, although some of the bank runs were hard for 
the public to see. The most visible bank run occurred in 2007 at 
Northern Rock, a U.K. bank that specialized in mortgage lend-
ing. Northern Rock’s depositors were worried that the bank was 
insolvent, so they started to withdraw their deposits from the 
bank. These withdrawals snowballed into the first U.K. bank 
run in 150 years. Northern Rock desperately tried to find a 
stronger bank that would buy it out and instill confidence in its 
depositors. No such sale could be arranged, and Northern Rock 
was subsequently taken over by the U.K. government.
Bank Regulation and Bank Solvency
If bank runs were a frequent occurrence, the banking system 
would be quite unstable. Fortunately, bank runs like the one 
on Northern Rock—with tens of thousands of jittery depositors rushing to withdraw their 
money—have been relatively rare since the 1930s because of deposit insurance. If a bank 
fails for any reason, depositors’ balances are protected up to some cap. All deposits at or 
below the cap are paid out in full by the relevant (government) insurance agency (the FDIC 
in the United States).
Deposit insurance didn’t stop the bank run at Northern Rock, since the caps were 
relatively low in 2007 in the U.K. and many depositors had balances above the cap. Even 
depositors with fully insured accounts also withdrew their money, as they were afraid that 
the failure of Northern Rock would temporarily prevent them from accessing their money.
But households aren’t the only economic agents depositing money at banks. Firms like 
Nike and Microsoft also hold bank accounts. Moreover, a bank might borrow money from 
other banks. When large firms and the general banking community lose confidence in a 
weak bank, an institutional bank run may ensue, in which firms and banks withdraw their 
deposits (and short-term loans) from the weak bank. FDIC insurance won’t prevent insti-
tutional bank runs because institutions make deposits and short-term loans that are far too 
large to be fully insured by the FDIC. Institutional bank runs occurred frequently during 
the 2007–2009 financial crisis. However, because it is impossible to take a photograph of 
an institutional bank run, it is hard to know exactly when one of them is occurring.
We do know that the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008 was 
preceded by an institutional bank run. Investment banks specialize in helping firms and 
governments make large financial transactions, especially for clients that need to raise 
financial capital to make investments. Investment banks are not FDIC-insured and do not 
take any deposits the way your neighborhood bank does. Instead, all of the liabilities on an 
investment bank’s balance sheet are loans from other institutions, including other banks.
Many of the largest institutions that lent money to Lehman Brothers decided to stop mak-
ing such short-term loans in the two weeks before Lehman went bankrupt. In other words, 
Lehman experienced an institutional bank run just before it failed. We now know that Lehman 
was insolvent at this time—its liabilities exceeded its assets. No wonder smart banks were 
unwilling to extend new loans to Lehman in the weeks before Lehman’s bankruptcy.
Naturally, banks are very eager to avoid such financial meltdowns. They have many strat-
egies at their disposal, though some of these strategies work better than others. As always, 
prevention is the ideal cure. The ultimate source of strength is to have lots of stockholders’ 
equity, implying that a bank has assets that far exceed the value of its liabilities. When a bank 
owns far more than it owes, it is said to be well capitalized. In this case, the public should 
have no doubt about a bank’s solvency, which reduces the likelihood of a bank run.
If a bank is running short of reserves, it can stop making new loans and it can sell its long-
term investments. However, these efforts can backfire, because they may actually reveal that 
a bank is in trouble and can intensify the panic that may already have begun. In addition, if 
a bank stops lending, it reduces its ability to act as a financial intermediary and reduces its 
earnings at exactly the time when it needs those earnings the most.
Northern Rock, a U.K. bank that specialized in mortgage lend-
ing, found it increasingly difficult to raise funds in late 2007. 
This triggered the first U.K. bank run in 150 years. A few 
months later, Northern Rock failed and was taken over by the 
U.K. government.

anks work very hard to create the impression that they are bedrock institutions. But they 
haven’t proved to be as solid as advertised. In the United States alone, nearly 20,000 banks 
have failed since 1900. However, most of those failures occurred before the establishment 
of the FDIC in 1933, which created deposit insurance and also enforced strict nationwide bank 
regulations. Nevertheless, even since the FDIC was established, more than 3,000 banks have failed.
Bank failures appear to be a regular feature of modern market economies. The U.S. economy 
has still observed four major waves of bank failures since the beginning of the twentieth century. 
The first wave of these bank failures occurred from 1919 to 1928—the decade before the Great 
Depression—when almost 6,000 banks failed, or 20 percent of all banks in the United States. 
These failures were concentrated among rural banks that issued mortgages to farms with land 
values that subsequently fell.
The second wave hit during the Great Depression (1929–1939), when more than 9,000 banks 
failed. This wave of bank failures was far more severe than the failures of the 1920s. For ex-
ample, in 1933 alone, more than 25 percent of all U.S. banks failed. All told, nearly 50 percent 
of all U.S. banks failed during the Great Depression.
The third wave occurred during the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s and early 1990s. 
Savings and loan associations are one type of regional bank. During the savings and loan crisis 
nearly 3,000 banks failed, comprising about 15 percent of all U.S. banks. The crisis was caused 
by a boom-to-bust cycle of rising and then falling agricultural and oil prices. During the period of 
rising prices, the banks made risky investments in local farms and businesses. When agricultural 
and oil prices turned around, those investments were decimated.
The fourth wave of failures resulted from the 2007–2009 financial crisis. By ­year-end 2012, 
there were over 460 bank failures, representing less than 5 percent of all U.S. banks. At first glance, 
this may seem to be relatively small when compared with the earlier waves. But the 2007–2009 
wave included the failure of Washington Mutual in 2008, with more than $300 billion in assets. The 
largest previous bank failure was Continental Illinois, which collapsed in 1984 with $40 ­billion in 
assets, which is equal to $90 billion in 2008 dollars.
Even more importantly, the 2007–2009 financial crisis coincided with the collapse of sev-
eral (nonbank) financial institutions, like Lehman Brothers. As described earlier, investment 
banks like Lehman are not regular banks since they don’t take deposits and their lenders are not

24.3
Many economists worry that extremely large banks have be-
come too powerful. If a bank is large enough, the govern-
ment will think twice before letting the bank fail, as this failure 
will reverberate through the economy. If one bank fails, then 
all of the banks that are owed money by the failed bank will 
suffer losses. And the dominoes might keep falling, as one 
bank after another fails and the ripples of financial losses 
keep spreading through other banks. In theory, the failure of 
one megabank could bring down the whole financial system.
Regulators call such large financial institutions systemi-
cally important financial institutions (SIFIs) and agonize 
about the consequences of the failure of a SIFI. The gov-
ernment faces a devilish problem: if a SIFI is in trouble, 
even if this is due to the SIFI’s own irresponsible deci-
sions, how could a responsible government not bail the 
SIFI out? For instance, the government could lend the 
bank some funds (at a low interest rate) thereby enabling 
the bank to keep operating and avoiding the cataclysmic 
economy-wide consequences of the bank’s failure.
Because the SIFI is “too big to fail”—meaning that the 
government is afraid of letting the megabank fail and will 
rescue it if it gets into trouble—the SIFI might knowingly 
choose to take irresponsible risks. If things do go badly, the 
bank will still be OK, since the government will be forced to 
offer a bailout. It’s the “heads I win, tails you lose” situation, 
with the winner being the bank’s shareholders and the loser 
being taxpayers, who indirectly bear the losses when the 
government sends the financial cavalry in to save the day.
To avoid problems like this, bank regulators have ad-
opted two strategies. First, they now require large banks 
to explain how they could be wound down in an orderly 
way if they were to become insolvent. These procedures 
are referred to as “living wills,” and they spell out how 
the bank would sell its assets and pay off its creditors in 
the event that it needed to end its business operations. 
Such living wills are designed to make it more credible 
and easier for a government to shut down a failing bank, 
including a failing SIFI.
Second, regulators are now requiring banks to take on 
less risk and hold more stockholders’ equity, reducing the 
likelihood that a large bank will get into trouble in the first 
place. We return to these issues in the next chapter.

total number of banks in operation during that year. Although this measure is not perfect—­
recall that Washington Mutual counts the same as any other bank, large or small—the data do 
provide some useful guidance about the pattern of historical bank failures.
Two key facts jump out. First, the Great Depression remains the most severe financial 
crisis in U.S. history (see the huge peak for 1933 in Exhibit 24.9). Second, after the FDIC 
regulatory and insurance system was created in 1933, the rate of bank failures plummeted. 
Note that the FDIC not only insures deposits but also acts as a stringent regulator.­ ­Deposit 
insurance reduces the likelihood of bank runs. Regulation reduces the likelihood that banks 
take irresponsible risks with their depositors’ money. At least so far, the FDIC era has been 
relatively placid in comparison to the financial mayhem that preceded it.

Chapter 24  |  Credit Markets
After hearing about the waves of failures that sometimes 
engulf the banking industry, you might be wondering 
how these waves originate. Why do so many banks go 
belly up at the same time?
Banks fail when they invest in long-term assets that 
subsequently fall in price. Since different banks tend to 
invest in the same types of long-term assets, banks’ for-
tunes often rise and fall together. Even a small percent-
age decline in the value of a bank’s long-term assets can 
wipe out all of a bank’s stockholders’ equity, causing the 
bank to become insolvent.
Large changes in asset values are common in economic 
history. For example, in the late 1920s, stock prices and land 
prices skyrocketed, only to plummet subsequently during 
the Great Depression. Likewise, the savings and loan crisis 
of the late 1980s was caused by a fall in asset values. One of 
the contributing factors was a roller-coaster ride in the prices 
of natural resources, particularly oil. From 1972 to 1980, the 
price of crude oil rose from about $20/barrel to $100/barrel 
(in 2010 constant dollars) and then fell back, ending up in 
1986 where it started in 1972 (using constant dollars). When 
oil prices peaked in 1980, most forecasters predicted steep 
ongoing increases in oil prices. Consequently, the subse-
quent fall in oil prices was unanticipated, devastating the oil-­
producing regions in the United States, particularly towns in 
Texas, ­Louisiana, and Oklahoma. Local businesses lost value, 
and over ten thousand of them went bankrupt. In turn, the 
slowdown in regional economies decimated housing prices.
The most recent financial crisis (2007–2009) was also 
associated with falling asset prices. The real value of U.S. 
stocks halved and the real value of residential real estate 
fell by over a third.
Why do asset prices fluctuate so much? The most estab-
lished theory of stock prices links them to fundamentals— 
rational forecasts of the future earnings prospects of 
companies and the future value of interest rates. This ­theory, 
often referred to as the theory of ­efficient markets and  
associated with Nobel prize-winning economist Eugene 
Fama, asserts that stock market prices are based exclusively 
on fundamentals and are entirely rationally determined.2 It 
implies that all movements in stock prices reflect rational 
appraisals of new information, not a tendency for investors 
to let their emotions get in the way. In the efficient markets’ 
view, large fluctuations in asset prices are episodes in which 
important new information became available to investors, 
who then use this information to rationally update their 
beliefs about the future profitability of firms traded on the 
stock exchange.
An alternative view, gaining more traction over the last 
three decades and developed by another Nobel prize-­
winning economist, Robert Shiller, links asset price fluctua-
tions to asset bubbles.3 Bubbles occur when asset prices 
depart from fundamentals. Some economists believe that 
substantial asset price bubbles arise on occasion, partly 
driven by psychological factors and biases, particularly dur-
ing specific episodes such as extended economic and stock 
market booms. If bubbles can be identified while they are 
occurring, then subsequent market crashes would be par-
tially predictable.
Whatever the source of crashes in asset prices, most 
economists agree that banking regulation plays a useful 
role in helping the banking sector survive these episodes. 
Regulators around the world are now drafting new rules that 
will require banks to have more stockholders’ ­equity—more 
assets relative to their liabilities—thereby increasing their 
ability to survive sharp declines in the value of the assets 
on their balance sheets. The chapters that follow contain 
extensive discussions about macroeconomic ­fluctuations—
like recessions—and the many different policies that gov-
ernments use to reduce the severity of these events.
CHOICE & CONSEQUENCE
Asset Price Fluctuations and Bank Failures
Summary
Credit is essential for the efficient allocation of resources in the economy; 
for example, credit allows firms to borrow for investment or households to 
borrow to purchase a house.
The relevant price in the credit market is the real interest rate rather than 
the nominal interest rate. The real interest rate adjusts the price of borrowing or 
lending for the effects of inflation, thus reflecting the economic trade-off between 
the present and the future that borrowers and savers face.
Firms, households, and governments use the credit market for borrowing. The 
credit demand curve summarizes the relationship between the quantity of credit 
demanded by borrowers and the real interest rate. The credit demand curve results 
from optimizing behavior of these borrowers.

The credit supply curve summarizes the relationship between the quantity of 
credit supplied and the real interest rate and also results from optimizing 
behavior, this time of savers. They trade off consumption today for consumption 
in the future, taking into account the reward for delaying consumption—the real 
interest rate.
The intersection of the credit demand curve and the credit supply curve is 
the credit market equilibrium. At the equilibrium real interest rate, the quantity  
of credit demanded is equal to the quantity of credit supplied.
Saving and borrowing in the credit market are intermediated by banks and 
other financial intermediaries. Banks play three key roles in the economy. First, 
they find creditworthy borrowers and channel savings of depositors to them. 
Second, they transform the maturity structure in the economy by collecting 
money from savers in the form of short-term demand deposits and investing that 
money in long-term projects. Third, they manage risk by holding a diversified 
portfolio and by transferring risk from depositors to stockholders and, in 
economic crises, to the government.
Governments provide deposit insurance that reduces the likelihood of 
bank runs, and governments intervene to save failing banks in order to avert 
widespread crises. The U.S. economy has experienced four major waves of bank 
failures since 1900.

Problems
	 1.	 The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis in 2008 raised con-
cern regarding shadow banking. The short article, “Lend-
ing in the Dark” on Project Syndicate (https://www 
.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-risk-profile-of- 
chinese-shadow-banking-by-andrew-sheng-and- 
geng-xiao) briefly discusses the shadow banking sector in 
China. Read the article and answer the following questions.
	
a.	 How serious is the issue of shadow banking in China?
	
b.	 What are the financial risks that China’s banking sys-
tem are facing?
	 2.	 The 1970s was a period of high inflation in many indus-
trialized countries, including the United States.
	
a.	 Due to the increase in the rate of inflation, lenders, 
including credit card companies, revised their nomi-
nal interest rates upward. How is the rate of inflation 
related to the nominal interest rate that credit card 
companies charge? Why would lenders need to in-
crease the nominal interest rate when the inflation rate 
increases?
	
b.	 Usury laws place an upper limit on the nominal rate of 
interest that lenders can charge on their loans. In the 
1970s, in order to avoid usury laws, some credit card 
companies moved to states where there were no ceil-
ings on interest rates. Why would credit card compa-
nies move to states ­without usury laws during a period 
of high inflation like the 1970s?
	 3.	 Imagine two economies—Worksa and Relaxsa. In 
Worksa, people’s saving is insensitive to the real inter-
est rate. On the other hand, in Relaxsa, people’s saving 
largely depends on the real interest rate. Both countries 
have the same credit demand curve slope. 
	
a.	 Referring to the above information, compare the slope 
of the credit supply curves in these two countries. 
	
	 Now both governments plan to raise $10 billion to  
finance infrastructure projects in their own countries.  
To raise the necessary funds, the government will borrow 
money from the credit market.
	
b.	 Suppose the loans made by governments in their own 
countries will not affect people’s saving habits. As-
sume that the initial interest rates for both countries 
are the same. Plot a graph showing how borrow-
ing from the government affects the interest rate in 
Worksa and Relaxsa. Compare the results. Which 
country’s real interest rate will be affected more?
	
c.	 As the government debt has to be repaid at one point, 
the tax is expected to increase in the future. Now peo-
ple would like to save more for a higher tax in the 
future. What will be the effect on the real interest rate 
in the two countries? Plot the graph(s) to explain your 
answer. (Hint: Compare the shifts in different curves.)
	 4.	 In August, 1979, the annual rate of inflation in the U.S. 
was nearly 12%, and the U.S. short-term nominal interest 
rate was nearly 10%. Over the next 35 years, both the rate 
of inflation and short-term nominal interest rate tended to 
fall. By August 2014, the rate of inflation was about 2% 
and the short-term nominal interest rate was close to 0%. 
How has the real short-term interest rate changed from 
1979 to 2014? Why do the inflation rate and the nominal 
interest rate tend to move together over the long-run?
	 5.	 Explain how the equilibrium real interest rate and the 
equilibrium quantity of credit would change in each of 
the following scenarios, and illustrate your answer with a 
well-labeled graph of the credit market.
	
a.	 As the real estate market recovers from the 2007–2009 
financial crisis, households begin to buy more houses 
and condominiums, and apply for more mortgages to 
enable those purchases.
	
b.	 Congress agrees to a reduction in the federal deficit, 
which results in a significant decrease in the amount 
of government borrowing.
	
c.	 Households begin to fear that the recovery from the 
2007–2009 recession will not last, and become more 
pessimistic about the economy.
	
d.	 Businesses become more optimistic about the future 
of the economy, and decide to distribute more of their 
earnings as dividends to their shareholders.
	 6.	 On September 18, 2008, there was a rumor that a bank in 
Hong Kong, Bank of East Asia, incurred a large loss in trad-
ing derivatives including the exposure to Lehman Brothers, 
and that it may downgrade its credit rating. Even though 
Bank of East Asia announced that its trading loss was small, 
it could not stop people from withdrawing their deposits. 
	
a.	 How did the rumor trigger the run on Bank of East Asia?
	
b.	 What are the possible economic costs of bank runs?
	
c.	 The run on Bank of East Asia ended after two days. 
What measures were taken to stop this? (You may 
search the news about the run on Bank of East Asia to 
answer this question.)
Select problems are available in MyEconLab for practice and instructor assignment.
	12.	 As the Choice and Consequence box on “Too Big to 
Fail” notes, bank regulators worry about the prospect of 
the failure of large financial institutions, dubbed “sys-
temically important financial institutions” (SIFIs).
	
a.	 How would the failure of a SIFI affect the economy?
	
b.	 What steps do bank regulators take to prevent SIFIs 
from failing or to minimize the effect of such failures?
	  13.	 Banks fail when they invest in long-term assets that sub-
sequently fall in price. What are the two views on why 
asset prices fluctuate so much that they lead to financial 
crises and bank failures?

	 7.	 Banks that practice narrow banking match the maturity of 
their investments with the term of the deposits that they 
collect from the public. In other words, narrow banks take 
short-maturity deposits and invest in assets that carry a 
low level of risk and are also of short-term maturity, like 
short-term government debt.
	
a.	 Suppose that all FDIC-insured banks decide to adopt 
narrow banking. How would narrow banking reduce 
the level of risk in the banking system?
	
b.	 If narrow banking reduces systemic risk, why do 
banks still practice maturity transformation?
	 8.	 If you have studied microeconomics, you may recall a 
concept called “moral hazard.” Moral hazard occurs when 
an economic agent is incentivized to take risks because 
some (or all) of the losses that might result will be borne 
by other economic agents.
Discuss how federal deposit insurance, administered 
by the FDIC as described in the chapter, might lead to 
moral hazard.
	 9.	 Recall from the chapter that banks in the United States hold 
a fraction of their checking deposits as reserves, ­either as 
vault cash or as deposits with the Federal Reserve (where 
they earn very little interest). ­Regulations require them to 
hold a certain percentage (currently 10 percent) of their 
checking deposits as reserves. However, banks are free to 
hold additional reserves if they choose. The latter are called 
excess reserves. Ordinarily, banks held very few excess 
reserves. However, starting in the financial crisis of 2007–
2009, the amount of excess reserves held by banks went 
from virtually zero to over 1.8 trillion dollars.
	
a.	 Explain why banks would be expected to try to mini-
mize the amount of excess reserves that they hold.
	
b.	 Based on what you learned about banking in the 
­chapter, explain why you think that the crisis prompted 
banks to dramatically expand the amount of excess 
­reserves they held.
	10.	 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., an investment bank, experi-
enced a bank run in 2008. There was also a run on Northern 
Rock, a commercial bank, in 2007. 
	
a.	 What were the similarities between these two bank runs? 
How were they different?
	
b.	 Lehman Brothers was not insured by the Federal ­Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) but deposits at Northern 
Rock were insured by the U.K. government. What could 
explain why there was still a bank run at Northern Rock?
	11.	 The “Choice and Consequence” box on “Asset Price Fluc-
tuations and Bank Failures” discusses the relationship 
between the prices of things like oil and real estate, and the 
solvency of lending institutions like banks.
Consider the following two scenarios. Supply the 
missing entries, and answer the questions that follow.
Assume that Securitas Bank is a large bank in the

What caused the 
German hyperinflation  
of 1922–1923?
During a hyperinflation, a country’s price level doubles within 3 years. 
In 1923, the inflation rate in Germany blew past this threshold. At 
one point, prices were doubling ­every three to four days. At that 
pace, prices doubled about 8 times in one month. For example, a 
single egg cost about 1 million ­German marks on ­October 1, 1923, 
and it cost about 256 ­million marks 30 days later:
8 Doublings: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256
During the entire period of German hyperinflation, prices rose by a 
factor of roughly 500 billion. German currency lost so much value 
that a briefcase or, in some cases, a wheelbarrow was needed 
to carry enough paper currency to buy a day’s groceries. Paper 
currency with low denominations had so little value that it was used 
to make toys, such as the kite on the left.
You might guess that there is something unique about 
Germany that caused this mass hysteria. But hyperinflations 
have occurred in many ­countries over the last century, including 
Austria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, ­Hungary, Greece, Poland, 
and Zimbabwe, to name a few. In this chapter, we ­examine why 
hyperinflations occur and explain how they can be avoided. ­Using 
these ­insights, most countries have avoided hyperinflations since 
the end of World War II. Nevertheless, not all policymakers have learned these 
lessons. For ­example, since 2011, Belarus, Iran, and Venezuela have suffered 
from ­debilitating hyperinflations.

KEY IDEAS
Money has three key roles: serving as a medium of exchange, a store 
of value, and a unit of account.
The quantity theory of money describes the relationship between the 
money supply, velocity, prices, and real GDP.
The quantity theory of money predicts that the inflation rate will equal 
the growth rate of the money supply minus the growth rate of real GDP.
The Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, has a dual mandate—low 
inflation and maximum employment.
The Federal Reserve holds the reserves of private banks.
The Federal Reserve’s management of private bank reserves enables 
the Fed to do three things: (1) set a key short-term interest rate; (2) influence 
the money supply and the inflation rate; and (3) influence long-term real 
interest rates.
Money is the asset that people 
use to make and receive payments 
when buying and selling goods and 
services.
“Money simultaneously serves three 
functions in a modern economy. It is 
a medium of exchange. It is a store 
of value. It is a measure of relative 
value, or a unit of account.”
A medium of exchange is an asset 
that can be traded for goods and 
services.
The world economy is a phenomenally complex social system. Every year, global GDP 
­totals about $80 trillion of goods and services. Money is the asset that people use to con-
duct these transactions. We can’t understand how the world economy works without first 
understanding how money lubricates the system.
To introduce the role of money, consider a student majoring in English who works part-
time in a bookstore; she exchanges her labor for money. Assume she uses her bookstore 
wages to buy something she wants, say, an iPhone. In this example, money greases the 
wheels of the exchange: she will give up 20 hours of time in the bookstore to eventually 
obtain an iPhone. Without money, the English major would have a hard time directly trad-
ing her labor for an iPhone. It is far more efficient for Apple to take her money than her 
labor in exchange for the iPhone.
The Functions of Money
Money simultaneously serves three functions in a modern 
economy:
	
1.	 It is a medium of exchange.
	
2.	 It is a store of value.
	
3.	 It is a measure of relative value, or a unit of account.
A medium of exchange is something that can be exchanged 
in return for goods and services, thereby facilitating trade. For 
example, when you hand the cashier $10 for a pepperoni pizza, you are using money—in 
this case currency—as a medium of exchange. The use of money allows for a convenient, 
universally acceptable way of buying and selling goods and services.
Money serves as a better medium of exchange when it is also a store of value—it en-
ables people to transfer purchasing power into the future. We expect that the $10 bill we 
receive on Tuesday will be accepted as a form of payment on Wednesday, or even a decade

from now. If pizzeria owners didn’t trust that the $10 bill would be accepted in the future, 
they would not accept the $10 bill today.
Money also provides the yardstick for describing prices. What does it cost to buy a pair 
of jeans? In principle, we could report the price in units of eggs. For example, one pair of 
jeans might be equal in value to 200 eggs. Alternatively, we could report all prices in units 
of bananas: one pair of jeans might be worth 100 bananas. But shopping would be difficult 
if every store used a different yardstick for reporting prices. Life would be easier with a 
single yardstick for measuring value—a unit of account. Modern economies use money as 
the unit of account—a universal yardstick that expresses the price of different goods and 
services. We measure the cost of a good by the number of dollars it takes to buy that good, 
not by the equivalent value in bananas.
Economic transactions are much easier to conduct when there is a medium of exchange, 
a store of value, and a universal unit of account. Money performs all of these critical tasks 
simultaneously.
Types of Money
Paper money was invented around 1,000 AD in China, but 
other forms of money have existed throughout human history. 
Before the adoption of paper money, people used money that 
was valuable in and of itself. The most well-known examples 
are silver and gold, though goats, chickens, and horses were 
also sometimes used.
Modern societies have switched to using fiat money—
something that is used as legal tender by government decree 
and is not backed by a physical commodity, like gold or silver. 
For example, paper money is valuable only because other people will accept it as money. 
We don’t accumulate Benjamins because we like the fine portrait of Benjamin Franklin on 
the $100 bill. Rather, $100 bills are useful for exchange, for storing value, and for keeping 
accounts because we trust that paper currency will be used for these purposes in the future.
In theory, any object in limited supply could play the role of fiat money, like used ticket 
stubs from major league baseball games or cobblestones taken from Peter’s Square in the 
Vatican. But if we used things like ticket stubs or cobblestones for money, there would be 
a far greater risk of somebody counterfeiting them. This problem is partially resolved by 
having the government create fiat money that is difficult and illegal to counterfeit (and easy 
to carry around).
The Money Supply
How much money do you have available to purchase goods and services today? For many 
people, the answer would be much more than the amount of cash they have in their pocket. 
Suppose you had $10 of currency in your wallet and a $1,000 balance in your checking ac-
count. The minute you pull out your checkbook, the money available to you for purchases 
jumps from $10 to $1,010. And why stop there? You could increase the balance in your 
checking account by electronically transferring funds from your savings account.
A unit of account is a universal 
yardstick that is used for expressing 
the worth (price) of different goods 
and services.

25.1
In 1861, at the beginning of the Civil War, the U.S. gov-
ernment paid its soldiers with paper currency that was 
convertible into gold. However, in 1862 the government 
ran short of gold and switched to fiat currency, which is 
not convertible.
You can see the difference in the following pair of images. 
The top image is paper currency issued in 1861, which is 
convertible into gold. It was called a Demand Note, because 
the note could be exchanged for gold “On Demand”—look 
for those words in the center of the note. The lower image is 
currency issued in 1862, which could not be exchanged into 
gold and omits the phrase “On Demand.”
When the introduction of fiat money was debated in 
1862, the idea was highly controversial. Many politicians be-
lieved that money would work only if it were backed by gold 
or silver. However, once it was issued, the 1862 fiat money 
quickly gained acceptance and did not generate hyperinfla-
tion. Convertibility wasn’t reintroduced until 1879.
The Civil War was just one of many periods in which fiat 
money has been used in the United States. The American 
colonies temporarily used fiat money during the Revolu-
tionary War. The United States temporarily adopted fiat 
money during the War of 1812. Following each of these 
episodes, convertibility was eventually reinstated.
Convertibility was gradually eliminated in the twenti-
eth century, and the last vestiges of convertibility were 
dropped in 1971. Since then, the system of fiat currency 
has performed well: the buying power of paper cur-
rency has been far less volatile than the buying power of 
gold. Very few economists believe that the United States 
should return to a “gold standard”—a system in which 
paper currency is convertible into gold.
In fact, new non-convertible electronic currencies are 
now being introduced by private organizations. Because 
these new currencies are not endorsed by the govern-
ment, they are not fiat currencies, and their future success 
is anyone’s guess. These electronic cryptocurrencies are 
protected with computer codes (cryptogaphy) that make 
theft of the currency difficult, though not impossible. The 
use of computer codes also hides the identities of the 
agents who use the currencies. The most famous, and  
the first, cryptocurrency, is bitcoin.
Cryptocurrencies have had a controversial start. The 
electronic exchanges on which cryptocurrencies are 
traded have frequently been used for illegal transactions, 
such as the sale of cocaine. Moreover, several exchanges 
have been hacked by rogue computer programmers, re-
sulting in electronic thefts. For example, the bitcoin ex-
change Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy after $477 million 
was stolen. Finally, the cryptocurrencies have had vola-
tile valuations, because the public’s demand for these 
new currencies waxes and wanes. For example, during 
2013 the value of a bitcoin rose from $13 per bitcoin at 
the start of the year to a peak of $1,163 per bitcoin on 
­November 30, before falling to $732 by year-end.

When economists talk about money, we include most forms of assets that can be imme-
diately drawn on to purchase goods and services. With this concept in mind, we define the 
money supply as currency in circulation, checking accounts, savings accounts, and most 
other types of bank accounts. You’ll often hear this definition of money supply referred to 
as M2. Using this definition, the money supply is overwhelmingly comprised of different 
types of bank accounts.
There are several different definitions of money supply, which go by the related names 
M1, M2, and M3. To avoid unnecessarily complicating our discussion, we focus on M2.
Exhibit 25.1 plots the evolution of currency in circulation (which does not include 
currency in bank vaults) and money supply (M2) from 1959 to 2014. To highlight some

Money, Prices, and GDP
We are now ready to study the relationship between money supply, prices, and nominal 
GDP. Along the way, we will use the fact that the ratio of Money/(Nominal GDP) is rela-
tively stable over the long run.
Nominal GDP, Real GDP, and Inflation
Let’s start with a few definitions that we first introduced in Chapter 19. Nominal GDP is 
the total value of production (final goods and services), using prices from the same year the 
output was produced. Real GDP is the total value of production (final goods and services), 
using fixed prices taken from a particular base year, which may or may not be the year the 
output was produced. Finally, the inflation rate is the growth rate of the overall price level 
in the economy.
To illustrate these concepts, consider an illustrative economy that only produces soccer 
balls. Assume that in 2013, this economy produced 10 soccer balls at a market price of 
$50 per ball, for total sales of $500. In 2014, total sales rise to $550. Therefore, nominal 
25.2 
important relationships, we divide everything by the level of nominal GDP. You can see 
that the ratios have starkly different values. In 2014, there are only about 7 cents of cur-
rency in circulation for every dollar of annual GDP. However, there are about 65 cents 
of total money supply for every dollar of GDP. Hence, the total money supply is about 
9 times the magnitude of currency in circulation. This is not surprising once we remem-
ber how little cash we carry around compared with the balances in our bank accounts. 
Moreover, very few of our important financial transactions are conducted with currency. 
In developed countries, only drug dealers buy a house or a car with a suitcase full of 
cash. Indeed, even smaller transactions, like paying the rent each month, are rarely con-
ducted with currency.
We can also use Exhibit 25.1 to think about time trends in these ratios. The (Currency 
in Circulation)/GDP ratio and the (Money Supply)/GDP ratio show no clear long-run time 
trends, though they do bounce around and they have been rising in recent years.

GDP has risen by $50 = $550 2 $500. What has caused the $50 increase? Here are two 
possibilities:
	
1.	 The price of soccer balls is still $50 per ball, and the number of soccer balls pro-
duced has risen to 11 balls.
	
2.	 The price of soccer balls has risen to $55 per ball, and the number of soccer balls 
produced has stayed fixed at 10.
Under either Scenario 1 or 2, nominal GDP is $550, 10 percent more than it was the year before.
In Scenario 1 the price hasn’t changed, but the number of soccer balls produced has 
risen from 10 to 11 balls. In this case, we say that inflation is zero and real GDP has grown 
by 10 percent. For example, using 2013 as the base year for prices, we can see that real 
GDP rose from 10 × $50 = $500 to 11 × $50 = $550, which is a 10 percent increase.
In Scenario 2 the price has risen from $50 to $55 per ball, but the number of soccer 
balls produced has stayed fixed at 10 balls in each year. In this case, we say that inflation is 
10 percent and real GDP is flat. Using 2013 as the base year for prices, we can see that real 
GDP held steady at 10 × $50 = $500. In both years, the number of balls produced was 10.
This example illustrates a basic property of nominal GDP. Increases in nominal GDP 
could arise because of an increase in the price level, an increase in the level of real GDP, 
or a combination of the two. In fact, we can express the growth rate of nominal GDP as the 
sum of the growth rate in prices (the inflation rate) and the growth rate in real GDP.
Growth rate of nominal GDP = Growth rate of prices + Growth rate of real GDP
	
= Inflation rate + Growth rate of real GDP.
We will now use this basic relationship to derive a theory that describes the connection be-
tween the growth rate of the money supply, the inflation rate, and the growth rate of real GDP.
The Quantity Theory of Money
We begin by discussing the relationship between the money supply and nominal GDP. 
­Recall the data from Exhibit 25.1. There we showed that over the long run, the ratio of 
money supply to nominal GDP is approximately constant.
 Money Supply
Nominal GDP = Constant.
The quantity theory of money assumes that this ratio is exactly constant. In general, 
that is not the case, as Exhibit 25.1 clearly shows. So in this sense the quantity theory of 
money is wrong, but it is an approximation of how the economy behaves over a few de-
cades, which economists loosely refer to as the long run. Look again at Exhibit 25.1, and 
you will see that although the ratio of money supply to nominal GDP does change over 
time, it has also been approximately stable over the long run. (The ratio of nominal GDP 
divided by money supply is referred to as the velocity of money— this is the inverse of the 
ratio plotted in Exhibit 25.1. The concept of the velocity of money does not play a role in 
our book, but you may encounter it in other courses.)
If the ratio of two variables is constant, then the numerator and the denominator have 
the same rate of growth. For example, if money supply grows by 10 percent, then nominal 
GDP also needs to grow by 10 percent to keep the ratio of money supply divided by nomi-
nal GDP constant.
So the quantity theory of money implies that the growth rate of money supply and the 
growth rate of nominal GDP will be the same.
Growth rate of money supply = Growth rate of nominal GDP.
Using this relationship, we can return to our equation decompos-
ing the growth rate of nominal GDP into (1) the inflation rate and 
(2) the growth rate of real GDP. Substituting the inflation rate 
plus the growth rate of real GDP for the growth rate of nominal 
GDP, we find that:
Growth rate of money supply = Inflation rate + Growth rate  
of real GDP.
The quantity theory of money 
assumes a constant ratio of money 
supply to nominal GDP.
“The quantity theory of money 
­implies that inflation is equal to the 
gap between the growth rate of 
the money supply and the growth 
rate of real GDP.”

Chapter 25  |  The Monetary System
25.3
We can rearrange this equation to put inflation on the left-hand side. Then we find that
Inflation rate = Growth rate of money supply − Growth rate of real GDP.
This result is a direct implication of the quantity theory of money. This equation implies 
that inflation is equal to the gap between the growth rate of the money supply and the 
growth rate of real GDP. When this gap widens, the inflation rate increases. This equation 
makes clear predictions that we can test with economic data.
Inflation
Recall from Chapter 19 that the inflation rate refers to the rate of increase of a price index. 
Of course, price movements need not always be positive. If a price level decreases, we call the 
rate by which it decreases deflation. For example, if the inflation rate is negative 1 percent, 
we say that the deflation rate is 1 percent. Rising price indexes have been much more common 
than falling prices since World War II, though the United States during the Great Depression 
and Japan during the last two decades both experienced periods of persistent deflation.
What Causes Inflation?
As we have just seen, the quantity theory of money implies that inflation occurs when the 
growth rate of money supply exceeds the growth rate in real GDP. This is the implication 
of the last equation that we derived.
Exhibit 25.2 illustrates this relationship with data from 110 countries over the period 
1960–1990. As you can see, the inflation rate (on the vertical axis), is closely related to 
the growth rate of money supply minus the growth rate of real GDP (this difference is 
on the horizontal axis). All of these variables are annualized in this exhibit, which means 
that they are expressed as a rate of increase per year. The quantity theory of money pre-
dicts that inflation should rise one-for-one with the growth rate of money supply minus 
the growth rate of real GDP. That is approximately what you see in Exhibit 25.2: most of 
the data is close to the 45-degree line, which has a slope of 1. This empirically confirms 
a key long-run prediction generated by the quantity theory of money.
You might have noticed that some of the countries plotted in Exhibit 25.2 had very 
high average inflation rates from 1960 to 1990. In the case of Argentina, the most extreme 
point in Exhibit 25.2, inflation averaged 80 percent per year from 1960 to 1990. Argentina 
experienced this high average inflation rate during this 30-year period because prices rose 
extraordinarily quickly in the 1980s, pulling up the three-decade average. At some points 
in the 1980s, prices rose more than 50 percent per month.
Recall from the chapter opener that during a hyperinflation, a country’s price level dou-
bles within 3 years. Hyperinflationary episodes are always related to extremely rapid growth 
of the money supply. In almost all cases, such extreme monetary growth is brought about by 
large government budget deficits. If a government’s tax revenues fall short of its expendi-
tures, then it meets its obligations by borrowing from the public and/or printing currency to 
buy goods and services. When a government prints currency and uses it to make purchases, 
this increases currency in circulation and thereby increases the money supply. This is also 
how German policymakers generated the great German hyperinflation of 1922–1923.
The Consequences of Inflation
If relative prices are all that matters for optimization decisions—for instance, the price of a 
gallon of milk relative to a worker’s hourly wage—then moderate inflation might not pose 
a problem. In principle, inflation scales up grocery prices and wages, so a worker’s ability 
to buy goods and services is unaffected by economy-wide inflation. Increasing all prices 
by 5 percent and simultaneously increasing a worker’s wage by 5 percent does not change 
any of the relative prices or the worker’s buying power. If inflation simply raised all prices 
and all wages by the inflation rate, then inflation might not be a big deal.
However, all prices and all wages do not always move in sync (at least not in the short 
run). An increase in the inflation rate generates windfall losses to some and windfall 
The deflation rate is the rate of 
decrease of a price index.

This figure empirically evaluates the long-run predictions of the quantity theory of 
money, using data from 1960 to 1990 for 110 countries. The vertical axis plots the 
annualized inflation rate for each country. The horizontal axis plots the annualized 
growth rate of money supply minus the annualized growth rate of real GDP. Each 
country is represented by a single point in the figure. We have also plotted the

relationship predicted by the quantity theory of money.

gains to others. Imagine that you have negotiated a 3-year nominal wage contract with 
your employer. If the inflation rate unexpectedly rises during this 3-year contract, you 
will be harmed by the unexpected inflation (unless your employer agrees to rewrite the 
contract). In this example, though you and the other employees of the firm lose out, the 
shareholders of the firm benefit from the unexpected inflation, because the extra infla-
tion lowers the real (inflation-adjusted) value of the wages that the firm pays its workers.
Next consider a retiree receiving a pension that is not indexed to inflation (in other 
words, the pension payments do not automatically rise with the overall level of prices). 
A rise in inflation makes the retiree worse off because the buying power of the pension 
declines. Here too, there is a winner on the other side of the relationship: the shareholders 
of the firm that is paying the pension. The real (inflation-adjusted) costs of the pension 
payments have gone down.
As yet another example, imagine that you have a mortgage at a fixed rate of interest. 
In other words, you borrowed money from a bank to buy your home and you are repaying 
that loan back at a fixed (predetermined) interest rate. If the inflation rate rises, your real 
interest rate falls, lowering the real cost of your mortgage. In this case, the consumer is the 
winner and the bank’s shareholders are the losers.
When contracts for wages, pensions, or mortgage payments are not indexed to inflation, 
an increase in inflation hurts some economic agents and helps others.
In these three examples, inflation generates specific winners and losers but no clear 
overall impact on society. However, some consequences of inflation are generally socially 
negative or socially positive. We now turn to those cases.
The Social Costs of Inflation
We first discuss three of the most important reasons that inflation is socially costly.
	
1.	 A high inflation rate creates logistical costs. In an environment of high inflation, 
firms need to frequently change their prices. Recall that during the worst months 
of the German 1923 hyperinflation, prices were doubling every three to four days, 

25.1
25.2
25.4
628	
Chapter 25  |  The Monetary System
25.3
which means they were increasing about 1 percent per hour. Imagine trying to run a 
business in which you needed to post new prices several times each day! That’s an 
extreme example, but even much lower rates of inflation—for instance, 20 percent 
per year—necessitate multiple changes to prices over the course of the year. Econo-
mists refer to a business’s cost of changing its prices as “menu costs,” using as a 
metaphor the new menus that restaurants print when prices change.
	
2.	 A high inflation rate distorts relative prices. Prices do not stay in sync when the 
inflation rate is high. Think about a newspaper that charges $1 per paper. Imagine 
that this newspaper has a cross-town rival that also charges $1 per paper. During a 
period of high inflation, the real (inflation-adjusted) price of these newspapers falls 
as long as the papers stick with the $1 price. In other words, the buying power of 
$1 is falling as the overall price level rises. Finally, one of the newspapers acts and 
doubles its price to $2 (sticking with round numbers to simplify newsstand transac-
tions). After this price change, one newspaper costs twice as much as the other, even 
though the two newspapers pay the same wages to their reporters and have the same 
printing costs. This newsstand price gap generates a distortion. Two newspapers 
that should be priced similarly are temporarily priced very differently. During this 
time, both newspapers might be unprofitable. The lower-priced newspaper isn’t 
charging enough to make money (because its labor and printing costs are rising 
with the overall price level). The higher-priced newspaper is rapidly losing readers, 
because its price is twice that of its competitor. Eventually, the lower-priced news-
paper will also raise its price to $2, but this might take a few months—complex 
organizations generally don’t make big changes overnight. This is an example of 
the many ways that inflation causes relative prices to fall out of sync, which reduces 
the efficiency of economic activity.
	
3.	 Inflation sometimes leads to counterproductive policies like price controls. 
­Inflation generates voter anger, and politicians sometimes respond by advancing eco-
nomically destructive schemes, especially price controls. In most of these cases—like 
the gasoline price controls of the 1970s, which were discussed in Chapter 4—the 
policy cure is worse than the disease. Price controls cause problems like long lines 
and supply disruptions. In addition, price controls are partially undone when some of 
those consumers who are lucky enough to obtain the good at the official capped price 
resell it at a higher price in the underground economy. Hence, price controls create 
an inefficient incentive for consumers who don’t want to consume the good to buy it 
anyway, just so they can resell it to someone else at a higher price.
The Social Benefits of Inflation
On the other hand, inflation does generate some social benefits. We mention two here.
	
1.	 Government revenue is generated when the government prints currency. While 
printing and spending an enormous amount of new currency leads to a ­hyperinflation, 
printing/spending a modest amount of new currency can be a socially beneficial 
source of revenue for a government. However, this additional government revenue 
is a double-edged sword. The citizens gain because their government has more 
money to spend, but the citizens also lose because the resulting inflation reduces the 
real value of the currency that the citizens already hold. However, if the amount of 
money creation is low enough, the net social benefit is positive.
The government revenue obtained from printing currency is called ­seignorage. 
This is not a major source of revenue for most governments, though it is relatively 
important in the United States because there are many people around the globe—
especially traders in the underground economy—who hold vast quantities of U.S. 
currency. Demand for U.S. currency also derives from entirely legal sources, like 
people in other countries with an ­unstable local currency who want a stable store 
of value. Seignorage generates roughly $30 billion of implicit revenue for the U.S. 
government each year.
The fact that a government can raise revenue by printing currency makes sei-
gnorage a candidate for abuse, and this is the reason why, as we noted above, some 
governments running large budget deficits often rapidly expand the money sup-
ply and cause inflation—as Zimbabwe, Iran, and Venezuela have done recently. 
Government revenue obtained 
from printing currency is called 
seignorage.

Section 25.3  |  Inflation
629
Printing a lot of currency has short-term appeal for a government, but in the long 
run the strategy of printing currency to pay a government’s bills often gets out of 
hand and leads to devastating episodes of hyperinflation.
	
2.	 Inflation can sometimes stimulate economic activity. Assume that a worker’s 
nominal wage is fixed in the short run. This could result from an annual labor 
agreement or because nominal wages are above their competitive equilibrium 
level and downwardly rigid (as we discussed in Chapter 23). Because nominal 
wages are fixed, the higher the rate of inflation, the more the inflation-adjusted 
wage falls. The inflation-adjusted wage is the wage divided by the overall price 
index—for instance, the consumer price index (CPI). We refer to this inflation-
adjusted wage as the real wage. A fall in the real wage increases a firm’s willing-
ness to ­employ workers. Another way to think about this is that a rise in the overall 
price level shifts the firm’s labor demand curve to the right, since the firm can 
now sell its goods at a higher price. A rightward shift in the labor 
demand curve, increases employment and GDP.
Inflation also lowers the real interest rate. Recall from ­Chapter 24 
that the real interest rate is the nominal ­interest rate minus the infla-
tion rate. If the inflation rate rises and nominal interest rates don’t 
respond one-f­or-one, then the real interest rate falls. Since the real 
interest rate is the inflation-adjusted cost of borrowing, a fall in the 
real interest rate stimulates borrowing that funds consumption and 
investment. An increase in consumption and investment ­(holding 
all else equal), increases GDP.
Modest inflation therefore stimulates the economy in the short-
run, by cutting real wages (stimulating employment) and cutting real 
interest rates (stimulating consumption and investment). We explore 
these channels in more detail in Chapter 27.
The real wage is the nominal wage 
divided by a price index, like the 
consumer price index (CPI).

For ­example, it cost 100 billion Zimbabwe dollars

Evidence-Based Economics
A
t the end of World War I, the Allies imposed heavy financial penalties on the 
defeated Central Powers, particularly Germany. German reparation payments 
were specified in the Treaty of Versailles, which was signed in 1919. Postwar 
Germany, which is referred to as the Weimar Republic, did not make the required pay-
ments and France retaliated by occupying the Ruhr, a small German industrial region, 
in January of 1923. To protest the French occupation, German workers in the Ruhr went 
on strike. This crippled the German economy along with the finances of the ­German 
government. As the economic situation deteriorated, the ­German ­government was able 
to meet only 8 percent of its financing needs with tax collection. The rest was paid by 
borrowing from the public and printing paper money.
Exhibit 25.3 plots the explosive growth of German currency in circulation during 
this episode. As implied by the quantity theory of money, the rapid increase in the 
German money supply (without a simultaneous increase in real GDP) prompted a 
surge in inflation. Though it is impossible to completely rule out all other explanations, 
economists believe that the German hyperinflation would not have occurred if the 
government had reduced its expenditures, borrowed more from the public, or defaulted 
on its debt so it could avoid printing so much currency to pay its bills.
The collapse of the German economy partially set the stage for the ascent of the 
Nazi party. On November 8, 1923, coinciding with the height of the hyperinflation, 
3,000 members of the Nazi party attempted to conduct a regional coup in Munich. This

coup attempt, which came to be known as the Beer Hall Putsch, ended with Adolf Hit-
ler’s arrest and 8-month imprisonment. While in jail, Hitler wrote his autobiography, Mein 
Kampf, or My Struggle, which became a rallying point for the Nazi party.
Tragically, Germany’s economic nightmare continued 6 years after the 1922–1923 hyper-
inflation ended. In 1929, the Great Depression enveloped the country and with it came a deep 
deflation and devastating unemployment. Germany had now experienced three economic 
catastrophes in little more than a decade: the loss of World War I in 1918 (along with 
subsequent reparations), hyperinflation in 1922–1923, and depression/deflation in 1929. 
The Great Depression completed the process of economic impoverishment, catapulting the 
heretofore unpopular Nazis into power. By 1933, Hitler was chancellor of Germany.

The Federal Reserve
In each country, the monetary system is run by a central bank. We now introduce the basic 
operations of the central bank. We will continue this discussion in Chapter 27, when we 
describe how central banks counteract recessions and other economic fluctuations. In the 
current chapter, we introduce the most important tools at the disposal of central banks, and 
describe the “plumbing” of the monetary system.
The Central Bank and the Objectives of Monetary Policy
The central bank is the government institution that monitors financial institutions, con-
trols certain key interest rates, and indirectly controls the money supply. These activities 
are jointly described as monetary policy, and central banks are occasionally referred to as 
the monetary authority.
In the United States, the central bank is called the Federal Reserve Bank, or simply, 
the Fed. Note that the Fed is not the federal government, but rather an independent regula-
tory agency/bank that operates almost completely autonomously from the rest of the federal 
government. Exhibit 25.4 shows the locations of the twelve regional ­Federal Reserve Banks 
and the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, which is located in Washington D.C. The 
Fed’s most important policy decisions are made by the Federal 
Open Market Committee, comprising the presidents of the twelve 
regional Federal Reserve banks (five of whom vote on a rotating 
basis) and the seven members of the Board of Governors.
Monetary policy is multifaceted, both in terms of its goals 
and its policy tools. At the broadest level, the Fed uses monetary 
policy to pursue two key goals or objectives: (1) low and predict-
able levels of inflation and (2) maximum (sustainable) levels of 
employment. These two goals are referred to as the Fed’s dual 
mandate.
The goal of low and predictable inflation is sometimes described 
as “price stability,” but this phrase is slightly confusing, since the Fed 
and almost all other central banks actually interpret “price stabil-
ity” to mean around 2 percent annual inflation. The term inflation 
­targeting refers to the policy of attempting to obtain a specific low level of inflation over the 
long run. Most central banks have adopted some form of official or unofficial inflation targeting.

The central bank is the government 
institution that monitors financial 
institutions, controls certain key 
interest rates, and indirectly controls 
the money supply. These activities 
constitute monetary policy.  
The Federal Reserve Bank, or the 
Fed, is the name of the central bank 
in the United States.  
“The Fed uses monetary policy to 
pursue two key goals or objectives: 
(1) low and predictable levels of in-
flation and (2) maximum (sustainable) 
levels of employment. These two 
goals are referred to as the Fed’s 
dual mandate.”

For the European countries that use the euro—the euro-area countries—the European Cen-
tral Bank (ECB) plays the role of the Fed. But the ECB places greater emphasis on the goal of 
low and predictable inflation and less emphasis on the goal of maximum employment, partly 
because of Germany’s terrible experience with hyperinflation in the 1920s coupled with its 
influence on decision making at the ECB.
What Does the Central Bank Do?
The central bank is closely involved in the day-to-day operations of private banks. This in-
volvement takes many forms. First, the central bank is a key regulator of private banks, 
particularly the largest private banks. The central bank audits the financial statements, or 
“books,” of large private banks, pressing each bank to accurately report the value of assets 
and liabilities on its balance sheet. The central bank will object if it notices that a private bank 
is holding a portfolio of assets that is too risky. The central bank also monitors the amount of 
shareholders’ equity in private banks, trying to ensure that it is large enough to absorb pos-
sible future losses in the value of the private bank’s assets. Such “stress tests” have become 
an even more important role of central banks since the 2007–2009 financial crisis.
The central bank also oversees interbank payment systems. When one bank transfers 
money to another—for example, when a depositor writes a check and the recipient of that 
check deposits the proceeds at a different bank—the central bank processes this transaction. 
So if a customer at JPMorgan Chase writes a $100 check to a customer at Citibank, then 
the Fed will clear this check by transferring $100 from JPMorgan Chase to Citibank. In this 
way, the Fed acts as a bank for banks.
The Fed also holds the reserves of private banks (with the exception of vault cash). 
The management of bank reserves is one of the most important and complex roles that 
the Fed plays, and this is the focus of the rest of this chapter. As we will see, the Fed’s 
management of bank reserves enables the Fed to do three things:
	
1.	 influence short-term interest rates, especially the federal funds rate,
	
2.	 influence the money supply and the inflation rate,
	
3.	 influence long-term real interest rates.
You may be wondering how employment also comes into this picture. After all, maxi-
mizing sustainable employment is one of the two parts of the Fed’s dual mandate. Interest 
rates affect households’ and firms’ willingness to borrow. Lowering interest rates stimu-
lates borrowing, which stimulates spending, thereby shifting the labor demand curve to 
the right and raising employment. On the other hand, raising interest rates discourages 
borrowing, which reduces spending, thereby shifting the labor demand curve to the left and 
lowering employment. We’ll return to these labor market outcomes in Chapter 27. For now, 
our task is to understand how the Fed controls bank reserves and why the quantity of bank 
reserves affects interest rates, the money supply, and the inflation rate.
To understand these issues, we’ll proceed as follows:
	
1.	 We’ll discuss the role of bank reserves in the economy, revisiting some of the issues 
that we introduced in Chapter 24 when describing the operation of private banks. 
Bank reserves are traded in a market, and we’ll explain the roles of the different 
participants in that market: private banks, which demand bank reserves, and the 
central bank, which supplies bank reserves.
	
2.	 We’ll discuss equilibrium in the market for bank reserves, which pins down a key 
short-term interest rate (at this interest rate the quantity of bank reserves demanded 
equals the quantity of bank reserves supplied).
	
3.	 We’ll then discuss the Fed’s influence on the money supply and inflation, which are 
also affected by the market for bank reserves.
	
4.	 Finally, we’ll discuss how the short-term interest rate influences long-term interest 
rates that are directly relevant for households’ and firms’ investment decisions.
Bank Reserves
As defined in Chapter 24, bank reserves are the combination of deposits that a private bank 
makes at the central bank plus cash that the private bank holds in its vault—referred to 
as vault cash. Note that bank reserves are not part of M2, which is the money supply that 
The Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System 
is nominated by the President 
and confirmed by the Senate.

Janet Yellen’s nomination as 
chair of the Board of Governors.

households and (non-bank) firms can use to buy goods and services, but as we will see 
below, bank reserves can affect the money supply. The quantity of bank reserves plays the 
key role in the operation of the monetary system. Let’s look at how private banks choose 
the quantity of reserves to hold and how they obtain extra reserves when necessary.
During their regular operations, private banks need to find funds to meet their daily 
needs. Bank reserves provide this source of funding.
On any given day, a private bank may have more account holders making withdrawals 
than new deposits coming in. For example, a large corporate account holder at a private 
bank might pay its employees at the end of the month by withdrawing funds from its cor-
porate bank account. Or a large corporate depositor might withdraw $1 billion of funds 
from the private bank so the corporation can use those funds for an acquisition of another 
company.
The private bank may also need funds to make new loans, such as issuing mortgages to 
home buyers, or making a large commercial loan to a firm building a new plant. Finally, 
the private bank may need funds to repay other banks from which it has borrowed money 
in the past.
All of these scenarios imply that the private bank will need liquidity, meaning that it will 
need funds that can be used immediately to conduct transactions. We say that a private bank 
has enough liquidity if it has sufficient funds to conduct its day-to-day business and to meet 
its regulatory reserve requirements. Reserve requirements are set by the central bank. In the 
United States today, the reserve requirement is 10 percent of a private bank’s demand depos-
its, such as checking accounts and other accounts that can be withdrawn by depositors with 
no notice (“on demand”). Summing up, the private bank must hold reserves (as vault cash or 
on deposit at the Fed) that equal 10 percent of the private bank’s demand deposits. Reserves 
in excess of this regulatory minimum are referred to as excess reserves.
When a private bank needs funds—liquidity—to conduct transactions, its first line of de-
fense is the reserves that it holds as vault cash or as deposits at the central bank. If the bank 
has ample reserves, it will use some of these to meet its daily funding needs. However, in 
some cases, the bank won’t have enough reserves to conduct its business. If a bank cannot 
find a way to raise additional funds at very short notice, it may not be able to make new loans 
or, in a dire case, it may not be able to pay depositors who wish to withdraw their funds.
Fortunately, banks have a way of obtaining additional liquidity. They can borrow funds 
from other banks. If some banks face large net withdrawals, then other banks are probably 
experiencing large net deposits. It is possible that all banks suddenly face large net with-
drawals, but most of the time the need for liquidity is not an aggregate phenomenon but 
specific to a limited set of banks.
To illustrate this point, think about the case of a large employer, like General ­Electric 
(GE), on payroll day. GE has 300,000 employees, earning an average salary of about 
$7,000 per month. To keep things simple, let’s assume that GE keeps all of its cash at one 
bank, pays its employees once per month, and makes all these employee payments elec-
tronically. On payroll day, GE’s bank account shrinks by 300,000 × 7,000 = $2.1 billion, 
and the bank accounts of GE’s employees swell by $2.1 billion. If GE and its employ-
ees all have their accounts at the same bank, this common bank will experience no net 
­withdrawals. Withdrawals and deposits will be offsetting.
But if the accounts are at different banks, which is a more realistic approximation, then 
GE’s bank will receive a net withdrawal of $2.1 billion and the employees’ banks will 
receive net deposits of $2.1 billion. At this moment, GE’s bank may be short of reserves, 
and the employees’ banks will be swimming in excess reserves. GE’s bank would like to 
borrow some reserves to address the shortage, and the employees’ banks would like to lend 
out their excess reserves.
Enter the federal funds market. This is where banks borrow and lend reserves to one 
another. In this market banks typically make one-day (24-hour) loans, so the federal funds 
market is referred to as an overnight market. The loan is typically made in the morning and 
is repaid the next morning. The term federal funds refers to the fact that these are loans of 
bank reserves held at the Federal Reserve Bank. The interest rate in this market is referred 
to as the federal funds rate.
An overnight loan might sound strange, but large banks are so efficient at making interbank 
loans that they are happy to make these loans for 24 hours (or less!). You wouldn’t want a  
24-hour mortgage because it would kill you to re-sign all of that paperwork every morning for 
Liquidity refers to funds available 
for immediate payment. To express 
the same concept a slightly different 
way, funds are liquid if they are 
immediately available for payment.
The federal funds market refers 
to the market where banks obtain 
overnight loans of reserves from one 
another.
The federal funds rate is the 
interest rate that banks charge 
each other for overnight loans 
in the federal funds market. The 
funds being lent are reserves at the 
Federal Reserve Bank.

30 years. However, large banks make billions of dollars of loans to one another each morning 
in the blink of an eye. Every morning, the banks assess their liquidity needs for the coming 
business day and borrow or lend accordingly. The following morning, the cycle repeats itself.
The Demand Side of the Federal Funds Market
Exhibit 25.5 graphs the demand curve for reserves. To be precise, these are reserves held 
on deposit by private banks at the Federal Reserve Bank (so we are not including vault cash 
held in private banks). The federal funds rate is plotted on the vertical axis, and the quantity 
of reserves is plotted on the horizontal axis. It is important to emphasize that the demand 
curve for reserves plots the total quantity of reserves held by private banks (not just the bor-
rowed reserves). So if one bank has $10 billion in reserves and loans $1 billion of reserves 
to another bank, the net quantity of reserves demanded is:
Exhibit 25.5 The Demand Curve in the 
Federal Funds Market
The (net) demand curve for reserves is 
downward-sloping: a higher federal funds rate 
increases the cost of holding reserves and 
reduces the quantity of reserves demanded 
by optimizing banks. Conversely, a lower 
federal funds rate increases the quantity of 
reserves demanded by banks. Movements in 
the federal funds rate, holding all else equal, 
correspond to movements along the demand 
curve. Shifts of the entire demand curve arise 
because of economic expansion or contrac-
tion, a changing deposit base, or changing 
liquidity needs.

To avoid double-counting, the $1 billion of loaned reserves is only counted as reserves 
for the borrowing bank. In this example, the total quantity of reserves held by private 
banks is $10 billion.
The demand curve relates the total quantity of reserves demanded by private banks for 
each level of the federal funds rate. The demand curve slopes down because optimizing 
banks choose to hold more reserves as the cost of holding those reserves—the interest rate 
that they pay to borrow reserves—falls. Reserves are a safety net for the banks, and they 
prefer to have a bigger safety net if the cost of that safety net falls.
Hence, a lower interest rate increases the quantity of reserves demanded. Changes in 
the federal funds rate (holding all else equal) generate movements along the demand curve 
for reserves.
On the other hand, if some factor other than the federal funds rate changes, the entire 
demand curve shifts. A shift in the demand curve for reserves corresponds to a change in 
the quantity of reserves demanded at a given federal funds rate. There are five key reasons 
for such shifts in the demand curve for reserves, and the last two of these reasons are under 
the direct control of the Fed:
• Economic expansion or contraction: In a booming economy, private banks need to 
obtain liquidity so they can make new loans to their customers—for instance, a manu-
facturing firm that wishes to expand production by building a new factory. Reserves 
provide liquidity that can be used to fund these loans. Therefore, an expansion in 

25.1
25.2
25.3
	
Section 25.4   |  The Federal Reserve
635
private banks’ loan originations produces a shift to the right in the demand curve for 
reserves. Likewise, a contraction in private banks’ loan originations produces a shift 
to the left in the demand curve for reserves.
• Changing liquidity needs: If banks expect a flood of withdrawals—for instance, a 
bank run—this also increases the demand for reserves. Paying out depositors requires 
liquidity, which is exactly what reserves provide. Hence, an anticipated flood of with-
drawals shifts the demand curve for reserves to the right.
• Changing deposit base: The demand for reserves is proportional to the total value 
of bank account balances. Recall that the reserve requirement compels each bank in 
the United States to hold 10 percent of its customers’ bank accounts in either vault 
cash or in reserves held on deposit at the Fed. So an expansion in the quantity of 
bank account balances produces a shift to the right in the demand curve for reserves. 
Conversely, the demand curve for reserves shifts to the left as a consequence of a 
contraction in bank account balances.
• Changing reserve requirement: The Fed has the authority to change the 10 ­percent 
reserve requirement. Though it rarely uses this authority, the Fed could raise the 
­reserve requirement, thereby shifting the demand curve for reserves to the right. Like-
wise, the Fed could lower the reserve requirement, thereby shifting the demand curve 
for reserves to the left.
• Changing interest rate paid by the Fed for having reserves on deposit at the Fed: 
The Fed pays a modest interest rate when private banks deposit money at the Fed—in 
other words, when private banks hold reserves at the Fed. In 2014, the ­interest rate 
paid by the Fed to private banks with reserves on deposit at the Fed was 1⁄4 of one 
percentage point. When the Fed raises this interest rate, reserves become more ben-
eficial to private banks, shifting the demand curve for reserves to the right. When 
the Fed lowers this interest rate, reserves become less valuable, shifting the demand 
curve for reserves to the left.
Exhibit 25.5 plots right and left shifts of the demand curve.
The Supply Side of the Federal Funds Market  
and Equilibrium in the Federal Funds Market
We’re now ready to talk about the supply side of the federal funds market. To understand 
the day-to-day operations of the Fed, it is useful to model the supply curve of reserves as a 
vertical line that is set every morning by the Fed. However, from day to day, the Fed may 
move this vertical supply curve to the right or to the left—as we will see below. Exhibit 25.6 
starts with the simple case in which the vertical supply curve does not respond to right or 
left shifts in the demand curve.
25.4
Exhibit 25.6 Equilibrium in the Federal 
Funds Market
Because the Fed fixes the supply of reserves 
each day, we represent the supply curve of 
reserves as a vertical line. The intersection 
of the downward-sloping demand curve 
and the supply curve gives the equilibrium 
in the federal funds market. Assuming that 
the Fed does not shift the supply curve in 
response to movements in the demand 
curve, a shift to the left in the demand curve 
lowers the federal funds rate, and a shift 
to the right in the demand curve raises the 
federal funds rate.

Chapter 25  |  The Monetary System
The point where the supply and demand curves cross in the federal funds market is the 
federal funds market equilibrium. Here, the equilibrium quantity of reserves demanded 
is equal to the equilibrium quantity of reserves supplied by the Fed. The equilibrium fed-
eral funds rate is the point at which the demand curve of private banks crosses the vertical 
supply curve of reserves set by the Fed.
In practice, each dollar of reserves (held at the Fed) is an electronic IOU issued by the 
Fed to a private bank. Private banks sell the Fed assets in exchange for these reserves. 
In most cases, the assets that the Fed buys are government bonds, principally bonds issued 
directly by the federal government or entities sponsored by the federal government, like the 
Federal National Mortgage Association (informally called Fannie Mae), which provides 
funding to the mortgage market.
If the Fed wishes to increase the level of reserves that private banks hold, it buys govern-
ment bonds from the private banks, and in return it gives the private banks more electronic 
reserves. If the Fed wishes to decrease the level of reserves, it sells government bonds to the 
private banks and in return the private banks give back some of their reserves. By buying 
or selling government bonds, the Fed shifts the vertical supply curve in the federal funds 
market and thereby controls the level of reserves (at the Fed) held by private banks. These 
transactions are referred to as open market operations, and they are the Fed’s most im-
portant monetary policy tool. The transactions associated with open market operations are 
illustrated in Exhibit 25.7, and discussed again in Chapter 27.
The Fed chooses between two alternative strategies when it implements monetary 
­policy. First, consider again the case in Exhibit 25.6. In this case, the Fed holds reserves 
fixed, even when the demand curve shifts. When this strategy is adopted, shifts in the de-
mand curve translate into changes in the federal funds rate.
The Federal Reserve’s second strategy is to find the level of reserves that achieves a par-
ticular level of the federal funds rate. Exhibit 25.8 shows how to find the level of reserves 
that generates a particular federal funds rate (2 percent in the exhibit). In this case, the 
Fed first chooses the federal funds rate and then finds that point on the demand curve that 
corresponds to that federal funds rate. The Fed makes available the exact level of reserves 
associated with that point on the demand curve. Using a strategy like this, the Fed can hold 
the federal funds rate at a particular fixed value, even as the demand curve shifts from day 
to day. When the demand curve shifts to the right, the Fed increases the supply of reserves 
to keep the federal funds rate from rising. When the demand curve shifts to the left, the Fed 
reduces the supply of reserves to keep the federal funds rate from falling.
Over the last 30 years, the Fed has gradually shifted towards this second strategy rather 
than the first strategy depicted in Exhibit 25.6. In particular, starting in 1995, the Federal 
Open Market Committee began making regular statements about the level (or range) of the 
federal funds rate that it was targeting.
The point where the supply and 
demand curves cross in the federal 
funds market is the federal funds 
market equilibrium.  
If the Fed wishes to increase the 
level of reserves that private banks 
hold, it offers to buy government 
bonds from the private banks, and 
in return it gives the private banks 
more electronic reserves. If the 
Fed wishes to decrease the level of 
reserves, it offers to sell government 
bonds to the private banks and in 
return the private banks give back 
some of their reserves. By buying 
or selling government bonds, the 
Fed shifts the vertical supply curve in 
the federal funds market and thereby 
controls the level of reserves. These 
transactions are referred to as 
open market operations.  
Exhibit 25.7 Open Market 
Operation That Lowers the 
Federal Funds Rate
An open market operation 
is an exchange between the 
central bank and private banks. 
In the example depicted in 
­Exhibit 25.7, the Fed gives a

held on deposit at the Fed. In 
exchange, the Fed receives

of America.

If the blue demand curve for reserves shifts to 
the right (from D to DR), the Fed will need to 
shift the supply curve of reserves to the right 
by exactly the amount that will make the inter-
section between the new supply curve and the 
new demand curve remain at the same federal 
funds rate (S shifts to SR). If the demand curve 
for reserves shifts to the left (from D to DL), 
the Fed will need to shift the supply curve of 
reserves to the left (from S to SL).

Exhibit 25.8 shows how the Fed can maintain a constant federal funds rate even when 
the demand curve for reserves shifts. On almost all days since the late 1980s, that is exactly 
what the Fed has done. But from time to time, the Fed decides to change the federal funds 
rate in an effort to nudge the economy. As we explain in Chapter 27, raising interest rates 
will cause economic growth to slow down, whereas lowering interest rates will cause eco-
nomic growth to speed up. We have a lot to say later in the book about why the Fed raises 
and lowers interest rates, but for now let’s discuss how the Fed makes this happen.
Exhibit 25.9 illustrates how the Fed can raise the federal funds rate by shifting the sup-
ply curve for reserves to the left. As we have seen, the Fed can shift the supply curve to the 
left by selling government bonds to private banks, allowing the private banks to pay for 
these bonds with their reserves, and thereby lowering the quantity of reserves that private 
banks hold at the Fed. The shift in the supply curve leads to a new equilibrium with a higher 
“price” for reserves—a higher equilibrium federal funds rate.
Likewise, Exhibit 25.9 also illustrates how the Fed can lower the federal funds rate by 
shifting the supply curve for reserves to the right. The Fed can shift the supply curve to 
the right by buying government bonds from private banks and giving the private banks

Exhibit 25.9 Shifts in the Federal Funds Rate Induced by a Shift in the Supply 
of Reserves
The Fed can raise the federal funds rate by shifting the supply curve for reserves to the 
left. This shift leads to a new equilibrium with a higher equilibrium federal funds rate. Like-
wise, the Fed can lower the federal funds rate by shifting the supply curve for reserves to 
the right. This shift leads to a new equilibrium with a lower equilibrium federal funds rate.

Chapter 25  |  The Monetary System
“The Fed has three basic policy 
levers for influencing the federal 
funds rate: changing the quantity 
of reserves supplied, changing the 
reserve requirement, and changing 
the interest rate paid on reserves.”
additional reserves in return for these bonds. The shift in the supply curve leads to a new 
equilibrium with a lower “price” for reserves—a lower equilibrium federal funds rate.
Exhibit 25.10 provides historical perspective on the behavior of the federal funds rate. 
It depicts fluctuations in the federal funds rate between July 1954 and January 2014. The 
exhibit shows that the federal funds rate can increase sharply. This volatility arises both 
from shifts in the supply curve of reserves (as shown in Exhibit 25.9), and from shifts in 
the demand curve for reserves (as shown in Exhibit 25.6).
Summary of the Fed’s Control of the Federal Funds Rate  Drawing together 
what we’ve discussed so far, the Fed can influence the federal funds rate either by shifting 
the quantity of reserves supplied (with open market operations) or by shifting the demand 
curve for reserves. Recall that the Fed can shift the demand curve for reserves to the right 
by raising the reserve requirement (which was 10 percent of demand deposits in June 2014) 
or by increasing the interest rate paid on reserves (which was ¼ of one percentage point in 
June 2014). Both of these demand-shifting policies would have the effect of increasing the 
equilibrium federal funds rate.
On the other hand, the Fed can shift the demand curve for reserves to the left by lower-
ing the reserve requirement or by lowering the interest rate paid on reserves. Both of these 
demand-shifting policies would have the effect of lowering the 
equilibrium federal funds rate.
Summing up, the Fed has three basic policy levers for influ-
encing the federal funds rate: changing the quantity of reserves 
supplied, changing the reserve requirement, and changing the 
interest rate paid on reserves. Today the Fed focuses primarily 
on shifting the quantity of reserves (open market operations) to 
influence interest rates. At the other extreme, changes in reserve 
requirements have become very rare. The last U.S. change in 
the reserve requirement occurred in 1992. Changes in the inter-
est rate paid on reserves are also infrequent (in fact, the use of 
such policies was only approved by Congress in 2008) but are 
expected to become more commonplace in the years ahead.
The Fed’s Influence on the Money  
Supply and the Inflation Rate
We’ve now completed our discussion of the determination of the federal funds rate—a key 
short-term interest rate. This was the first of three consequences of the Fed’s management 
of bank reserves. We’re now ready to turn to the second category: the Fed’s influence on 
the money supply and on the inflation rate.

The federal funds rate has varied 
a great deal during the postwar 
period. During recessions—­
indicated by the shaded areas

lates the economy by lowering 
the federal funds rate.

In fact, the Fed cannot directly control either the money supply or the inflation rate. 
Some people mistakenly think that the Fed controls the money supply because the Fed 
controls the quantity of bank reserves. But bank reserves are actually not part of the money 
supply. Instead, the money supply includes deposits by households and firms at private 
banks and currency in circulation. 
Though the Fed doesn’t directly control the money supply or inflation, the Fed does try 
to influence these important macroeconomic variables. Since inflation is part of the Fed’s 
dual mandate (along with employment) and the money supply is not, the Fed cares a great 
deal about inflation and only indirectly cares about the money supply. Accordingly, if the 
annual inflation rate is close to the Fed’s target of 2 percent, the Fed won’t worry about 
short-run variation in the growth rate of the money supply.
In the long run, the inflation rate is approximately equal to the growth rate of the money 
supply minus the growth rate of real GDP as we saw in our empirical analysis of the quan-
tity theory of money. Because of this relationship, the Fed will try to slow down the rate of 
money supply growth if the inflation rate starts to rise above the Fed’s inflation target.
Note that the money supply increases when banks make new loans. Consider a home 
buyer who takes out a $200,000 mortgage from Citibank. The person who is selling the 
home receives these funds from the buyer and deposits them at her bank, which may or 
may not be Citibank. This deposit increases the money supply by $200,000. Hence, the 
origination of this new mortgage increases the money supply by $200,000. Accordingly, 
the origination of many new loans causes the money supply to grow rapidly. When the Fed 
attempts to slow down the growth of the money supply, it does this by slowing down the 
growth of loans from private banks to households and firms.
As we explain in the next subsection, the federal funds rate influences the long-term 
interest rates that affect the quantity of new loans demanded by households and firms. 
By raising the federal funds rate, the Fed raises the interest rate that households and firms 
face, thereby lowering the quantity of loans demanded and lowering the growth rate of the 
money supply.
Summary of the Fed’s Influence on the Money Supply and the Inflation Rate  
The Fed raises the federal funds rate with three tools. First, the Fed can reduce the quantity 
of bank reserves by using open market operations. Second, the Fed can increase the reserve 
requirement. Third, the Fed can increase the interest rate that it pays on reserves. All of 
these policies will increase the federal funds rate and the interest rates that households and 
firms face for borrowing. Consequently, a higher federal funds rate reduces the rate of loan 
growth to households and firms, reducing the rate at which the money supply grows, and 
reducing the rate of inflation. Likewise, a lower federal funds rate increases the rate of loan 
growth to households and firms, increasing the rate at which the money supply grows, and 
increasing the rate of inflation.
During normal times, the federal funds market operates 
without a hitch. Banks that need extra reserves borrow 
them, and banks that have excess reserves lend them out. 
But during extraordinary times, such as during a financial 
panic, the federal funds market can break down because 
banks with excess reserves don’t know whom they can 
trust. They don’t know which banks are solvent—those 
that are able to pay back their lenders—and which banks 
are not. Accordingly, the banks with excess reserves may 
be unwilling to lend these reserves out.
In such a crisis, the banks that need reserves may not 
be able to obtain them. Fortunately, the Fed can step in 
and provide reserves to the banks that need them. The 
Fed does this by allowing banks to borrow reserves at the 
“discount window.” Because loans from the discount win-
dow have a higher interest rate than loans obtained on 
the federal funds market, the discount window is usually 
a private bank’s last resort for borrowing reserves. Some-
times the Fed is referred to as the “lender of last resort.” 
When all else fails, a bank can go directly to the Fed for 
a loan of reserves.

The Relationship Between the Federal Funds Rate  
and the Long-Term Real Interest Rate
We’ve now completed our discussion of the first two consequences of the Fed’s manage-
ment of bank reserves. We’re ready to turn to the third, and final, category. By intervening 
in the market for bank reserves, the Fed influences both the federal funds rate and the long-
term real interest rate. Recall that the real interest rate is defined as the real price of a loan, 
or, in other words, the price of a loan adjusted for inflation. It is defined as
Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate − Inflation rate.
Consider a firm that borrows $100 for a year at a nominal interest rate of 5 percent in an 
economy with a 2 percent inflation rate. One year later, the firm pays back $100 × (1 + 0.05) = 
$105 dollars, but inflation has chipped away at the buying power of this money. If the inflation 
rate is 2 percent, $105 in the payback year has buying power of only $105/(1 + 0.02), or about 
$103 in the year the loan was issued. This is just $3 more than the original loan amount. So 
the real cost to the borrower is only $3 of buying power, which 
is 3 percent of the original $100 loan. In general, the real cost 
of a loan is the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. In 
the current example, the real interest rate can be calculated as 
5% − 2% = 3%.
Investment depends on the long-term real interest rate, 
which is the long-term nominal interest rate minus the long-
term inflation rate. When we talk about the long-term, we 
are referring to horizons that are at least 10 years away. The 
long-term real interest rate is relevant for the economy be-
cause many investments require funding for at least a decade. 
A home loan lasts 30 years. A major corporate research and 
development project—like the development of the double-
decker, ­“superjumbo” Airbus A380—can take 20 years 
­between the initial conceptualization and the roll-out of the 
finished product.
In contrast, the federal funds rate is a short-term nominal 
interest rate. So there is a mismatch between the short-term in-
terest rate that the Fed essentially controls and the long-term real interest rates that matter 
for most investment decisions. To understand the potential impact of the federal funds rate 
on the long-term real interest rate, it is also useful to think about the real interest rate that is 
anticipated when the loan is made. This is potentially different from the real interest rate that 
is realized over the life of the loan. It is therefore useful to distinguish between a realized real 
interest rate and an expected real interest rate.
The realized real interest rate is defined as:
Realized real interest rate = Nominal interest rate − Realized inflation rate.
For example, if a borrower takes out a loan on December 31, 2010 and repays the loan on 
December 31, 2020, the realized real interest rate would be the nominal interest rate that 
the borrower agreed to on December 31, 2010, minus the actual realized inflation rate be-
tween December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2020. Note that realized inflation is the infla-
tion that actually occurred over a particular period of time. When the loan is first issued, the 
borrower doesn’t yet know what the realized inflation rate will be. So the borrower won’t 
be able to calculate the realized real interest rate until the loan ends on December 31, 2020.
But we do have beliefs, or expectations, about the inflation rate between now and then. 
We can use those expectations to motivate a closely related concept called the expected 
real interest rate:
Expected real interest rate = Nominal interest rate − Expected inflation rate.
When making loans, optimizing borrowers and lenders consider the expected real interest 
rate; they do not yet know what the realized inflation rate will be. Because the expected 
real interest rate plays the key role in people’s decisions, its components matter, includ-
ing ­inflation expectations. Economic agents’ inflation expectations are their beliefs about 
future inflation rates.
The long-term real interest rate is 
the long-term nominal interest rate 
minus the long-term inflation rate.
The realized real interest rate is 
the nominal interest rate minus the 
realized rate of inflation.
The expected real interest rate is 
the nominal interest rate minus the 
expected rate of inflation.
Economic agents’ inflation 
expectations are their beliefs about 
future inflation rates.
Development of the A380 was started in 1988. The first air-
craft was sold in 2008. Twenty-year research and development 
projects are not funded by 365 × 20 = 7,300 overnight loans.

We are now ready to ask how a change in the federal funds rate affects the long-term ex-
pected real interest rate. Although there is no universally accepted answer, most economists 
agree that changing the federal funds rate also tends to change—in the same direction—the 
long-term expected real interest rate.
A fall in the federal funds rate implies that private banks are able to borrow reserves 
in the federal funds market at a lower interest rate. Because the private banks, own bor-
rowing costs are falling, they start to offer loans at lower interest 
rates too. This implies that the supply of credit from private banks 
shifts to the right.
Moreover, the long-term nominal interest rate falls because a 
long-term loan is effectively made up of many short-term loans. You 
can think of a 10-year loan as ten 1-year loans lined up one after 
the other—like a freight train made up of box cars that are linked 
together. When the federal funds rate goes down, the first 1-year loan 
becomes less expensive for the private bank to make. In addition, a 
change in the federal funds rate is usually not reversed for at least 
several years, so several of the 1-year loans that are linked together in 
the first few years of the 10-year loan package are affected. Think of 
the nominal interest rate for the long-term loan as the average of these ten 1-year loans. Since 
several of the 1-year loans are affected by a change in the federal funds rate, the long-term nomi-
nal rate moves in the same direction.
How do people actually form inflation expectations? 
Some economists believe that people’s inflation expec-
tations are determined by the level of inflation in the re-
cent past. For example, “my forecast of the inflation rate 
next year is the inflation rate that was realized last year.” 
Such adaptive expectations are a backward-looking 
form of inflation expectations. Such backward-looking 
inflation expectations are plausible, because it is natu-
ral to believe that the future will mirror your recent past 
experiences.
But believing that what will happen in the future is the 
same as what happened in the recent past is not maxi-
mally rational. Many economists believe that people are 
more sophisticated than the adaptive expectations the-
ory assumes. These critics of the adaptive expectations 
model typically endorse the model of rational expec-
tations, which assumes that people have inflation ex-
pectations that incorporate all of the information that 
is available when the inflation expectations are being 
formed and use that information in the most sophisti-
cated way possible. If agents have rational expectations, 
they are masterful forecasters who make the best pos-
sible forecast using a sophisticated understanding of the 
workings of the economy.
Critics of the rational expectations model complain that 
it overestimates the degree of human rationality. For de-
cades, economists have debated which of these ­models—
or yet another model of people’s belief ­formation—best 
describes the actual inflation expectations of consumers 
and workers. The jury is still out.

To make this concrete, suppose that the Federal Reserve lowers the federal funds rate 
from 4 percent to 3 percent, and that this decrease is going to last for 2 years, at which 
point the federal funds rate will revert to its old level. Then, the 10-year nominal interest 
rate, which can be thought of as the average of ten 1-year loans, will fall from 4 percent to 
3.8 percent. To see why, let’s take the average of ten 1-year loans, where the first two loans 
are made at 3 percent and the last eight loans are made at 4 percent:
 3% + 3% + 4% + 4% + 4% + 4% + 4% + 4% + 4% + 4%

= 3.8%.
To complete our analysis, we now need to determine how changes in the long-term 
­nominal interest rate—which we just analyzed—affect the long-term expected real interest

rate. This requires that we study the effect of monetary policy on both the long-term nomi-
nal interest rate and the long-term expected inflation rate.
First, imagine what would happen if inflation expectations don’t change in response to 
a fall in the federal funds rate. If inflation expectations don’t change, and nominal interest 
rates fall, then the expected real interest rate falls. Hence, a fall in the federal funds rate low-
ers the long-term nominal interest rate and lowers the expected long-term real interest rate.
Exhibit 25.11 summarizes these linkages and provides a numerical example. The ­exhibit be-
gins with an increase in the reserves held at the central bank. This change results from open mar-
ket operations conducted by the Fed. Specifically, the Fed buys bonds from banks and gives the 
banks reserves in exchange for the bonds. The rightward shift in the supply of reserves lowers 
the federal funds rate—in this example, from 4 percent to 3 percent. This in turn lowers the long-
term nominal interest rate from 4 percent to 3.8 percent. If the long-term expected inflation rate 
remains at 2 percent, then the long-term expected real interest rate falls from 4 – 2 = 2 percent 
(before the open market operation) to 3.8 – 2 = 1.8 percent (after the open market operation).
If inflation expectations do change, the analysis gets more complicated, but even in this 
case, the long-term expected real interest rate often falls in response to a reduction in the 
federal funds rate.
Summary of the Fed’s Influence on Long-term Expected Real Interest 
Rates  The long-term real interest rate is the long-term nominal interest rate minus the 
long-term expected inflation rate. When the Fed influences short-term interest rates, such 
as the federal funds rate, this affects the long-term nominal interest rate. A long-term loan 
is like a combination of short-term loans. You can think of a 10-year loan as ten 1-year 
loans lined up one after the other. When the federal funds rate goes down, the interest rate 
for the first 1-year loan goes down. In addition, a change in the federal funds rate is usually 
not reversed for several years, so several of the 1-year loans in the 10-year loan package are 
affected. In most cases, when the Fed lowers the federal funds rate this has little impact on 
long-term inflationary expectations. Summing this up, the long-term real interest rate tends 
to fall when the federal funds rate falls because the long-term nominal interest rate falls and 
inflation expectations tend to stay roughly the same.
This completes our overview of the Fed’s activities. We’ve discussed the Fed’s core activi-
ties, but we’ve left some important details out. We’ll fill in the rest of the picture in the next two 
chapters. The current chapter introduced the concept of money and the fundamental “plumb-
ing” of the Fed’s operations, especially the Fed’s influence over the federal funds market. In 
the next two chapters, you’ll see how the Fed trades off competing policy goals and how the 
Fed actually conducted policy during and after the financial crisis and recession of 2007–2009.

Summary
Money plays a vital role in our lives. It makes a range of economic 
transactions possible, simultaneously serving as (1) a medium of exchange that 
can be traded for goods and services, (2) a store of value that enables us to save 
and transfer purchasing power into the future, (3) a common unit of account that 
expresses the price of different goods and services.
The money supply is the quantity of money that individuals can immediately use 
in transactions. The money supply is defined as the sum of currency in circulation 
(which excludes currency in bank vaults) and the balances of most bank accounts at 
private banks. This measure of the money supply is referred to as M2. This measure 
of the money supply excludes all forms of bank reserves.
The quantity theory of money links the money supply to nominal GDP, which 
is the value of total output in the economy measured at current prices. The quantity 
theory of money implies that the long-term inflation rate equals the long-run 
growth rate of the money supply minus the long-run growth rate of real GDP.
At a fixed growth rate in real GDP, faster growth of the money supply leads to 
inflation and, in extreme cases, to hyperinflation. Inflationary growth in the money 
supply generates social costs, which include “menu costs” that firms incur as they 
make frequent price changes, distortions in relative prices, and price controls. 
Moderate growth in the money supply, which produces moderate inflation, also 
generates certain benefits for society, including seignorage and temporarily lower 
real wages and real interest rates, which stimulate growth of real GDP.
Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve Bank (the Fed) in the United
States, attempt to keep inflation at a low and stable level and also try to maximize 
the sustainable level of employment.
The Fed holds the reserves of private banks (with the exception of vault 
cash). The management of these private bank reserves is one of the most 
important roles that the Fed plays. The Fed’s management of private bank 
reserves enables it to do three things: (1) set the federal funds rate, a short-term  
interest rate; (2) influence the money supply and the inflation rate; and 
(3) influence long-term real interest rates.
The Fed has many policy levers that enable it to influence the market for 
bank reserves and, by implication, the federal funds rate, including shifting the 
quantity of reserves supplied (which is referred to as open market operations), 
changing the reserve requirement, and changing the interest rate paid on reserves.

Problems
	 1.	 Barter is a method of exchange whereby goods or ser-
vices are traded directly for other goods or services with-
out the use of money or any other medium of exchange.
	
a.	 Suppose you need to get your house painted. You register 
with a barter Web site and want to offer your car cleaning 
services to someone who will paint your house in return. 
What are the problems you are likely to encounter?
	
b.	 Some barter Web sites allow the use of “barter  
dollars.” The registration fee that you pay to a barter 
Web site gets converted into barter dollars that can be 
exchanged with other users to buy goods and services. 
Would the use of barter dollars resolve the problems 
you listed in part (a)? Explain.
	 2.	 Money makes a variety of economic transactions possible.  
In the following three situations, determine whether money 
is involved in the transaction.
	
	 a.	 In prison camps during World War II, and in some pris-
ons today, cigarettes circulate among prisoners. For 
example, an iPod might cost two cartons of cigarettes, 
whereas a magazine might cost only two cigarettes. Dis-
cuss whether cigarettes are fulfilling all three functions 
of money in this case.
	
	 b.	 Over the last 50 years, credit cards have become an in-
creasingly popular way for people to purchase goods 
and services. Are credit cards money? Explain your 
reasoning.
	
	 c.	 Almost every day, many people sign their names to 
little pieces of paper called checks, which are then ac-
cepted in exchange for goods and services. Do these 
checks constitute money? Why or why not?
	 3.	 Yap is a small island in the Pacific Ocean with a total land 
area of 39 square miles. In the 1900s, there were only three 
commodities that were traded on this isolated island—fish, 
coconuts, and sea cucumber. However, the monetary system 
in Yap was highly sophisticated. The currency that was used 
on Yap was called “Fei.” Fei were large wheels of stone with 
a hole in the center. These stone wheels were not quarried 
in Yap but were brought to the island from elsewhere. The 
value of each wheel as currency depended on its size, which 
ranged from 1 foot in diameter to 12 feet. Each time a trans-
action had to be settled in Fei, the ownership of each stone 
wheel was transferred to the seller, even if the wheel was 
not physically moved to the seller’s house. Explain how Fei 
fulfilled or failed to fulfill the three functions of money.
	 4.	 Bitcoins are defined as a “peer-to-peer decentralized digital 
currency.” The supply of bitcoins is not controlled by the 
government or any other central agency. The value of each 
bitcoin is determined on the basis of supply and demand and 
is defined in terms of dollars. New bitcoins can be gener-
ated through a process called “mining.” However, new bit-
coins will not be created once there are a total of 21 million 
bitcoins in existence. Some commentators feel that bitcoins 
can eventually replace most of the major currencies in the 
world. Would you agree? Explain your answer.

funds rate) is very low, approximately equal to zero, can 
BOJ use open market operations to change the interest 
rate? Illustrate your answer with the aid of graphs for 
demand curve and supply curve for reserves.
	
	 b.	 Why is raising people’s inflation expectations impor-
tant? How would this help increase GDP?
	11.	 Before 2012, the open market operations were not well-
developed in China. Its main tool of monetary policy was 
the reserve requirement. It required private banks to hold 
certain portion of their deposits, thereby reducing the 
amount of loans they could lend.
	
	 a.	 How would an increase in the reserve requirement have 
affected the demand curve for reserves?
	
	 b.	 If inflation was high, what would the Chinese banks 
do to lower the inflation rate—raise or reduce the re-
serve requirement? To answer this question, explain 
how change in the interest rate lowers the inflation rate 
and use the demand and supply of reserves graph to 
show how change in the reserve requirement affects the 
equilibrium overnight call rate (similar to federal funds 
rate). For simplicity, assume that the supply of reserves 
remains unchanged.
	12.	 The chapter discusses different models of how people 
form their expectations regarding inflation. Consider the 
following two investors, who are trying to forecast what 
inflation will be for next year. Sean reasons as follows:  
“Inflation was 2.5 percent last year. Therefore, I think it 
is likely to be 2.5 percent this year.” Carlos, on the other 
hand, thinks this way: “The economy has recovered from 
recession sufficiently that inflationary pressures are likely 
to build. Likewise, a weaker dollar means that imports are 
going to be more expensive. I don’t think the Fed will risk 
slowing the recovery and raising unemployment by rais-
ing interest rates to fight inflation. So, in light of all these 
factors, I expect inflation to increase to 5 percent next 
year.” Using the terminology mentioned in the chapter, 
explain how you would best describe how each investor is 
forming his expectations of inflation. Which description 
better fits your own forecasts of inflation?

What caused 
the recession 
of 2007–2009?
The U.S. economy, like any other, experiences economic 
fluctuations—in other words, the growth rate fluctuates from 
year to year. Between 1982 and 2007, the U.S. economy 
tended to grow quickly and experienced only two mild  
recessions, achieving average growth in real gross domestic 
product (GDP) of 3.4 percent per year. But starting at the 
end of 2007, the economy began a deep contraction. The 
fall in economic activity caused significant hardship for  
hundreds of millions of households worldwide. In the United 
States alone, the number of unemployed ­workers rose by 
7.4 million. Many families also lost a large chunk of their life savings; U.S. housing prices 
fell by a third and stock prices halved. The ­recession that started in December 2007 
lasted until June 2009, when the economy started ­growing again.
What caused the recession of 2007–2009? In this chapter, we examine the various 
factors that contributed to this economic and financial free fall. But first we will explore 
the characteristics of economic fluctuations in general and possible causes for them. 
In the process, we will develop a model that can help us better understand the short-run 
causes and consequences of fluctuations in economic activity.

KEY IDEAS
Recessions are periods (lasting at least two quarters) in which real  
GDP falls.
Economic fluctuations have three key features: co-movement, limited 
predictability, and persistence.
Economic fluctuations occur because of technology shocks, changing 
sentiments, and monetary/financial factors.
Economic shocks are amplified by downward wage rigidity and 
multipliers.
Economic booms are periods of expansion of GDP, associated with 
increasing employment and declining unemployment.
Three key factors contributed to the 2007–2009 recession: a collapsing 
housing bubble, a fall in household wealth, and a financial crisis.
Growth, even for the most 
­developed economies, is never 
­completely steady.
Short-run changes in the growth of 
GDP are referred to as economic 
fluctuations or business cycles.  
Modern market economies have demonstrated a remarkable abil-
ity to generate long-run growth. As we saw in Chapter 21, the U.S. 
economy grew substantially over the last 100 years. But growth, 
even for the most developed economies, is never completely 
steady. Instead, there are periods of good times and bad, of ups 
and downs. These fluctuations tend to be hard to predict. We refer 
to short-run changes in the growth rate of real GDP as economic 
fluctuations or business cycles.
Exhibit 26.1 plots the level of real GDP (in blue) in the United States from 1929 to 
2013, using 2009 as the base year for prices. Recall that real dollars hold the overall price 
level fixed, implying that the effects of inflation are removed from plots of real variables. 
The plot of real GDP starts in 1929 because that is when high-quality data were first 
available.
The exhibit also plots a trend line (in red), which represents the level of real GDP that 
the economy would attain if we could wave a wand and magically maintain a steady rate 
of growth, thereby avoiding fluctuations. The trend line in Exhibit 26.1 is derived by draw-
ing a path that grows smoothly over time. Such a fluctuation-free economy is not actually 
feasible—economic fluctuations are a fact of life. Government policies can only reduce the 
severity—not the very existence—of fluctuations.
In Exhibit 26.1, two major deviations from trend are apparent: the Great Depres-
sion (lasting throughout the 1930s) and the period of U.S. participation in World War II  
(1941–1945). During the Great Depression, the U.S. economy fell far below trend GDP. 
Conversely, during World War II, the U.S. economy surged ahead of trend GDP.
Exhibit 26.2 provides an alternative way of looking at the same data by plotting the per-
cent deviation between real GDP and its trend. This corresponds to the percentage difference 
between the blue and red lines in Exhibit 26.1. Looking at Exhibit 26.2, we can again easily

The most recent recession (2007–2009) is visible at the end of the plot. Even in 2013,  
4 years after the end of the recession, real GDP remains well below its trend level.
In addition to comparing economic activity to its trend as we did in Exhibit 26.1, econo-
mists focus on fluctuations in the annual growth rate of GDP. They refer to periods of 
positive growth in GDP as expansions or booms and to episodes of negative GDP growth 
as downturns, contractions, or recessions.
As we have seen in Chapter 19, recessions are periods (lasting at least two quarters) in 
which real GDP falls. Of course, we also care about periods of economic growth. Economic 
­expansions are the periods between recessions. Accordingly, an economic expansion begins at 
the end of one recession and continues until the start of the next recession. During the last cen-
tury, the average economic expansion has been about 4 times as long as the average recession.

Exhibit 26.3 reports the dates of the 14 U.S. recessions that have occurred since 1929 and 
the decline in real GDP from peak to trough in each recession. The peak is the high point 
of real GDP, just before a recession begins. The trough is the low point of real GDP during 
the recession, which corresponds to the end of the recession. Since 1929, a recession has 
occurred about once every 6 years, and the average recession length has been about 1 year.
Patterns of Economic Fluctuations
Economic fluctuations have three key properties:
	
1.	 Co-movement of many aggregate macroeconomic variables
	
2.	 Limited predictability of fluctuations
	
3.	 Persistence in the rate of economic growth
We now look at each of these properties in turn.
Co-Movement  Many aggregate macroeconomic variables grow or contract together 
during economic booms and recessions. Economists refer to this pattern as co-movement. 
Exhibit 26.4 illustrates co-movement, focusing on two key variables: consumption and 
investment both adjusted for inflation, which are referred to as real consumption and 
real investment. The horizontal axis plots the growth rate of real consumption in a single 
year, and the vertical axis plots the growth rate of real investment in the same year. Each 
plotted point is a single year of historical data, so you can read the growth rates for real 
consumption and real investment by tracing a point to both horizontal (real consumption) 
and vertical (real investment) axes.
The exhibit shows that points tend to cluster around an upward-sloping line. This means 
that consumption and investment co-move. When consumption growth is high, investment 
growth tends to be high as well. When consumption growth is low (or negative), investment 
growth tends to be low (or negative). In other words, consumption and investment tend to 
either grow together or shrink together.
Note also that investment is more volatile than consumption. The vertical axis ranges 
from −100 percent to +150 percent, while the horizontal axis ranges only from −10 ­percent 
to +15 percent. The substantial variation in investment growth occurs ­because firms often 
drastically cut investment in response to a weakening economy and then raise it rapidly 
when the economy is booming. However, it is optimal for households to try to smooth 
consumption over time. For example, unless you actually run out of money, you wouldn’t 
want to postpone replacing your smashed smartphone until the economy recovers from a 
recession.
Employment and GDP also move together with consumption and investment, and 
unemployment moves negatively with GDP. This implies, for example, that during 
Exhibit 26.3 U.S. Recessions from 
1929 to 2013
Since 1929, a recession has occurred 
about once every 6 years and each 
­recession has on average lasted 
about 1 year. The recession trough is 
the low point for real GDP during a 
recession, corresponding to the end 
of the recession. In most ­recessions, 
the ­decline in real GDP from peak 
to trough is less than 3 percent, 
though in the Great Depression of 
1929–1933, the U.S. economy did 
­experience a 26.3 percent drop in 
real GDP from peak to trough.

Exhibit 26.4 Real Consumption Growth Versus Real Investment Growth (1929–2013)
The horizontal axis plots the growth rate of real consumption in a single year, and the 
vertical axis plots the growth rate of real investment in the same year. Each plotted point 
corresponds to a single year of historical data, so you can read the growth rates for real 
consumption and real investment by tracing a point to both horizontal (real consumption) 
and vertical (real investment) axes. For example, on the right-hand side of the exhibit, 
there is a point marked 1950. That year, real consumption grew about 6 percent (read 
this off the horizontal axis), and real investment grew about 39 percent (read this off the 
­vertical axis). When consumption growth is relatively high, investment growth also tends to 
be relatively high. On the left-hand side of the exhibit, there is a point marked 2009. That 
year, real consumption grew about −2 percent (horizontal axis), and real investment grew 
about −22 percent (vertical axis). When consumption growth is relatively low, investment 
growth also tends to be relatively low. Economists say that consumption and investment 
tend to move together—they exhibit co-movement.

contractions real consumption, real investment, employment, and real GDP all fall, while 
unemployment rises.
Limited Predictability  The second important feature of economic fluctuations is 
that of limited predictability. If you look back at Exhibit 26.3, showing the duration of 
recessions in the U.S. economy since 1929, you can see that recessions have been as short 
as 6 months and as long as 43 months. The 2007–2009 recession was 18 months long. 
Economic expansions also have highly variable lengths. Since 1929, the shortest expansion 
was 1 year and the longest was 10 years.
Because recessions and expansions have such variable lengths, it is clear that they do not 
follow a repetitive, easily predictable cycle. In fact, even with the tools of modern econom-
ics, it is impossible to predict far in advance when a recession or an expansion will end. 
We call this property “limited predictability” rather than “no predictability,” because by us-
ing sophisticated statistical techniques we can achieve a small degree of predictive power. 
Given the current state of economic science, we are usually able to accurately predict the 
end of a recession a month or two before the actual end. But it is practically impossible to

forecast the end of a recession at the time the recession begins. Moreover, it is also 
­impossible to forecast when an expansion will end. Limited predictability is important 
to acknowledge because many early theories of business cycles assumed that economic 
­fluctuations had a pendulum-like structure with systematic swings in economic growth. 
Such predictability is very far from the truth.
Persistence in the Rate of Growth  The third noteworthy regularity of economic 
fluctuations is that of persistence. Even though recessions begin and end at somewhat 
unpredictable times, economic growth is not random. When the economy is growing, it will 
probably keep growing the following quarter. Likewise, when the economy is contracting—
in other words, when growth is negative—the economy will probably keep contracting the 
following quarter. So if the economy is in a recession this quarter, our best bet is that it will 
still be in a recession next quarter as well. Thus there is some amount of persistence in the 
rate of economic growth.
The Great Depression
We’ve noted that one event stands out like no other in the history of economic fluctua-
tions. This is the Great Depression, which is far and away the most severe U.S. economic 
contraction since modern methods for measuring GDP were developed about 100 years 
ago. Although there is no consensus on the definition, the term depression is typically 
used to describe a prolonged recession with an unemployment rate of 20 percent or more. 
Although the U.S. economy has experienced dozens of recessions, only the 1929 con-
traction qualifies as a depression. For example, unemployment during the 2007–2009 
recession peaked at 10.0 percent, less than half the level of peak unemployment during 
the Great Depression.
The Great Depression started in 1929, coinciding with a crash in the U.S. stock market. 
From 1929 to 1933, the crisis deepened as stock markets around the world continued to 
fall. At its bottom in 1933, the U.S. stock market was about 80 percent below its peak  
4 years earlier. Millions of U.S. farmers and homeowners went bankrupt. Real GDP fell 
26.3 percent below its 1929 level, and unemployment eventually rose from 3 percent in 
1929 to 25 percent in 1933. From 1929 to 1933, the number of banks in the United States 
fell from 23,679 to 14,207. This decline was driven by failing banks that either went 
out of business altogether or were acquired by stronger competitors. Similar events oc-
curred in almost all developed countries around the world, though the U.S. contraction 
was among the most severe.
The Great Depression illustrates the three key properties 
of economic fluctuations that we just discussed. First, it fea-
tured strong co-movement in economic aggregates. Panel (a) of ­ 
Exhibit 26.5 illustrates this co-movement by plotting real GDP, 
real consumption, and real investment from 1929 to 1939. The 
three series started to fall in 1929 and bottomed out in 1932 
and 1933. Unemployment moved in lockstep in the opposite 
­direction: starting at 3 percent in 1929 and peaking at 25 per-
cent in 1933. The unemployment rate is plotted in panel (b) 
of Exhibit 26.5. Finally, the financial markets reflected these 
movements, also co-moving with real GDP. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an im-
portant stock index, fluctuated with the level of economic activity—see panel (c) of 
Exhibit 26.5.
The Great Depression also featured limited predictability—or in this case, no pre-
dictability. In fact, it came as a complete surprise to most economists, policymakers, 
and business leaders.2 The preeminent economic forecaster of the late 1920s was ­Irving 
Fisher, a Yale professor and newspaper columnist, who repeatedly wrote about the 
strength of the economy and the low likelihood of adverse economic events. Indeed, 
one week before the stock market’s Great Crash of October 24, 1929, Fisher stated that 
“stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.” Even after the 
initial October stock market crash, and after the broader economy had started to contract, 
Fisher maintained his optimism. On May 19, 1930, Fisher wrote, “It seems manifest that 
The Great Depression refers to the 
severe contraction that started in 
1929, reaching a low point for real 
GDP in 1933. The period of below-
trend real GDP did not end until 
the buildup to World War II in the 
late 1930s.
Although there is no consensus on 
the definition, the term depression 
is typically used to describe a 
prolonged recession with an 
unemployment rate of 20 percent 
or more.

thus far the difference between the present comparatively mild business recession and the 
severe depression of 1920–1921 is like that between a thunder-shower and a tornado.” 
Unfortunately, unfolding events would soon prove him completely wrong. The contrac-
tion of 1920–1921 turned out to be minor when compared to the much deeper contraction 
that started in 1929.
Fisher’s misplaced optimism was common. No leading economic or business forecaster 
foresaw the Great Depression. Consider this: on January 18, 1930, a group of eminent 
forecasters at Harvard wrote, “There are indications that the severest phase of the recession 
is over.” In truth, the Great Depression had barely begun.

Finally, the Great Depression featured the third property of economic fluctuations—a 
great deal of persistence. The period of negative growth in real GDP lasted for 4 years, 
starting in 1929 and ending in 1933.
Summary of Shifts in the Labor Demand Curve
In Chapter 23, we discussed the most important sources of shifts in the labor demand curve:
	
1.	 Changing output prices: When the price of the output good goes down, the value 
of the marginal product of labor also declines. This implies that the firm would 
like to hire fewer workers at any given wage, shifting the labor demand curve to 
the left. (When the price of the product the firm produces rises, the value of the 
marginal product of labor goes up, shifting the labor demand curve to the right.)
	
2.	 Changing output demand: When the demand for the product the firm produces 
declines, its price and thus its value of the marginal product of labor goes down, 
shifting the labor demand curve to the left. (When the demand for the product 
the firm produces rises, the value of the marginal product of labor goes up, shift-
ing the labor demand curve to the right.) In addition to the factors emphasized 
in Chapter 23, an expansion in credit (and a decline in the interest rate) can also 
lead to an increase in output demand, as we have seen in Chapter 24.
	
3.	 Changing technology and productivity: When the marginal product of labor 
falls, the labor demand curve shifts to the left. (When the marginal product of 
labor rises, the labor demand curve shifts to the right.)
	
4.	 Changing input prices: Businesses use labor and other factors of production, 
like physical capital and energy, to produce goods and services. When the 
cost of these other factors goes up, firms purchase less of them. This usually 
decreases the marginal product of labor, shifting the labor demand curve to 
the left. (When the cost of these other factors goes down, firms purchase more 
of them, shifting the labor demand curve to the right.) A change in the credit 
market equilibrium can also influence labor demand by affecting the firm’s 
cost of financing the acquisition of physical capital.
Macroeconomic Equilibrium 
and Economic Fluctuations
Why are there economic fluctuations? Given the importance of economic fluctuations and 
the voluminous amount of research on the topic, you might think that we would have a 
convincing answer—one on which we could all agree. Alas, that is not the case. In fact, 
there probably isn’t another topic that incites as much passionate disagreement among 
economists. Although this disagreement, often aired in newspaper editorials and blogs, is 
real, it masks the fact that economists have built up a significant body of shared knowledge 
about the nature of economic fluctuations. This knowledge forms the basis of the model of 
economic fluctuations that we will now describe.
Labor Demand and Fluctuations
We begin our analysis by returning to a discussion of the labor market. Recall from 
­Chapter 23 that the intersection of the labor demand and labor supply curves determines 
the labor market equilibrium. Here we start with a labor market with flexible wages and 
then show how downward wage rigidity amplifies the impact of labor demand shifts—and 
thus amplifies the magnitude of economic fluctuations.
26.2 
Panel (a) of Exhibit 26.6, which focuses on the case of flexible wages, reminds you 
of this relationship by graphing labor demand and labor supply curves and their intersec-
tion. Also recall that labor demand reflects profit maximization by firms, and labor supply 
­reflects how households optimally trade off labor and leisure.

Exhibit 26.6 A shift to the left of the la-
bor demand curve leads to a fall in equi-
librium ­employment and a fall in the wage 
(point “2: ­Recession”). This example as-
sumes that wages are flexible and conse-
quently fall as a result of the leftward shift 
in the labor demand curve.
The decline in employment from the 
­pre-recession equilibrium (point 1) to a 
­recession moves the economy along the 
aggregate ­production function relating 
employment to real GDP, causing a de-
cline in real GDP. The ­decline in employ-
ment is smaller when wages are ­flexible 
(point 2, which appears in panel (a)) than 
when wages are downward rigid (point 3, 
which appears in panel (c)). Consequently, 
the fall in real GDP is also smaller when 
wages are flexible than when wages are 
downward rigid.
When wages are downward rigid, a 
shift to the left of the labor demand 
curve leads to a sharp fall in equilibrium 
employment. In the new ­equilibrium 
(point “3: Deeper recession”), there are 
many workers (denoted by the green line) 
who would like to work at the market 
wage but can’t find a job. These ­workers 
are ­officially classified as unemployed 
­because they would like to work at the 
market wage but can’t find a job.

The labor market equilibrium, which corresponds to the wage and employment levels 
given by the intersection of the labor supply and labor demand curves, is the key building 
block we will use to construct a model of economic fluctuations. Employment fluctuations 
correspond to changes in this labor market equilibrium, and real GDP and employment 
fluctuations are linked. Panel (a) of Exhibit 26.6 illustrates these linkages by depicting a 
leftward shift in the labor demand curve, which reduces the equilibrium quantity of labor

employed. Before a recession begins, the original equilibrium is given by the point labeled 
“1: Pre-recession.” After an economic shock has shifted the labor demand curve to the left, 
the new equilibrium, which features a lower wage and a lower quantity of labor demanded, 
is at the point labeled “2: Recession.”
Panel (b) of Exhibit 26.6 depicts the aggregate production function, which we discussed 
in Chapter 20. Holding physical capital and technology constant, this curve shows the rela-
tionship between employment and GDP (we are holding human capital per worker constant 
here, so the efficiency units of labor are proportional to employment). We can see in the 
panel that as employment declines (due to the leftward shift in 
the demand curve), so does real GDP (because there is less labor 
producing goods and services). Accordingly, employment and 
real GDP rise and fall together, which is another illustration of 
co-movement among economic aggregates.
In practice, the fall in real GDP might exceed what we show in 
panel (b) of the exhibit because the decline in employment gen-
erates other types of economic adjustment. Laying off a worker 
also makes the physical capital that the worker was previously 
using—plant and equipment—less productive, leading firms to 
shutter plants and mothball equipment. The rate of utilization 
of physical capital is called capacity utilization, and recessions 
are usually accompanied by a reduction in capacity utilization. 
For example, during the depths of the 2007–2009 recession, ca-
pacity utilization in the United States fell to 67 percent from a 
normal rate of 80 percent, further depressing real GDP.
As we discussed in Chapter 23, when wages are downward rigid, 
the impact of a shift in labor demand is amplified. This is shown in 
panel (c) of Exhibit 26.6. In the case of downward wage rigidity, 
firms are unable or unwilling to cut wages because of contractual 
restrictions or because of morale problems that would result from 
falling wages. As a result, firms end up laying off more workers 
than they would have if wages were downward flexible. With down-
ward rigid wages, a leftward shift in the labor demand curve causes 
employment to fall by even more than it does in the flexible wage 
case. Accordingly, with downward rigid wages there is an even deeper recession and a bigger 
movement along the aggregate production function than in the flexible wage case (panel (b)).
Downward rigid wages are one source of unemployment. At the market wage, which 
is the downward rigid wage, the number of workers who are willing to work exceeds the 
number of jobs that firms are willing to fill. The number of unemployed ­workers in this 
deeper recession—in other words, workers who would like to work at the market wage but 
can’t find a job—is represented by the green bar at the bottom of panel (c).
Although shifts in the supply of labor can also cause fluctuations in employment and un-
employment, the most important source of fluctuations are shifts in the demand for labor. 
To understand the nature of short-run macroeconomic equilibrium, we need to know why 
the demand for labor fluctuates.
Sources of Fluctuations
Economists have tried to identify the forces that affect the demand curve for labor. These 
forces cause recessions and other aggregate economic fluctuations.
In Chapter 23 we provide one breakdown of the factors that shift the labor demand 
curve: (1) changes in the output price for a firm’s products, (2) changes in the demand for 
a firm’s products, (3) changes in productivity or technology, or (4) changes in the costs 
of a firm’s inputs.
We now offer a different breakdown, by discussing three schools of thought within the 
economics profession. Each school has a different story to tell about the sources of aggre-
gate economic fluctuations.
	
1.	 Real business cycle theory: emphasizes changing productivity and technology
	
2.	 Keynesian theory: emphasizes changing expectations about the future
	
3.	 Financial and monetary theories: emphasize changes in prices and interest rates
When firms shed their workers, utilization of physical 
­capital also falls.
When wages are downward rigid, 
the impact of shifts in labor demand 
is amplified.

Exhibit 26.7 The Relationship Between the Change in the Rate of 
Unemployment and the Growth Rate of Real GDP
This exhibit depicts Okun’s Law, which shows the relationship between the 
change in the rate of unemployment and the growth rate of real GDP (g). 
Okun’s Law (the black line) implies that the year-to-year change in the rate of 
­unemployment is
 - 1
2 * (g - 3%).
In other words, unemployment remains constant when the growth rate of real 
GDP is 3 percent, unemployment declines when the growth rate of real GDP is 
above 3 percent, and unemployment increases when the growth rate of real GDP 
is below 3 percent. The exhibit plots annual data from 1948 to 2013.
Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics (unemployment rate) and Bureau of Economic Analysis, National 
Income and Product Accounts (real GDP).
26.2
Exhibit 26.6 emphasizes that employment and real GDP 
are tightly connected through the aggregate production 
function. This linkage is related to an equation called 
Okun’s Law, which is named after economist Arthur 
Okun, who first noticed in the early 1960s that there is a 
close connection between falling unemployment and the 
growth rate of real GDP.3 Employment tends to increase 
and the unemployment rate tends to decline when the 
growth rate of real GDP is high.
In particular, let g represent the annual growth rate  
of real GDP, in percentage points. Then Okun’s Law  
says that:
 (Year@ to@   year change in the rate of unemployment)
  = - 1
2 * (g - 3%).
This equation implies that the unemployment rate holds 
steady when the growth rate of real GDP is 3 percent. The 
equation also implies that the unemployment rate falls 
when g is above 3 percent; and the unemployment rate 
rises when g is below 3 percent. In other words, the un-
employment rate falls when real economic growth is rela-
tively high; and the unemployment rate rises when real 
economic growth is relatively low. Okun’s Law is plotted 
as a black line in Exhibit 26.7. Although the data don’t 
line up perfectly with the equation, Okun’s Law is roughly 
consistent with the data.
Though the overall relationship between changes in the 
rate of unemployment and the growth rate of real GDP is 
clear in the data, these two variables do not always move 
together. Sometimes, a fall in the unemployment rate is 
delayed by a year or more after the growth rate of real

GDP picks up at the end of a recession. This delay occurs 
for several reasons, but the most important one is labor 
hoarding. Because recruiting workers and training them 
is costly, firms may not want to lay off qualified workers 
during a temporary slowdown. During a recession some 
firms will reduce the hours of their workers or even pay 
those workers to come to jobs at which little gets done, 
rather than laying the workers off. When the economic 
recovery comes and these firms increase production, they 
will not initially need to hire new workers because they 
can start to ramp up production by fully utilizing the work-
ers they hoarded during the contraction.
Each of these three schools of thought draws upon one or more of the four categories of shifts 
in the labor demand curve from Chapter 23. Most economists studying business cycles believe 
each school of thought has generated many key insights, and economists generally don’t be-
lieve that any one school has all of the answers. The model that we use to describe economic 
fluctuations expresses the ideas of all of these different schools in a single general framework.
1. Technology Shocks: Explanations from Real Business Cycle Theory  In 
Chapters 20 and 21, we showed that technology differences across firms and workers in  
different countries help explain differences in cross-country income and growth. Accord-
ingly, one might look for technological reasons to explain economic fluctuations within a 
given country. For example, imagine that research and development (R&D) leads firms to 
invent more valuable products (e.g., smartphones replacing traditional cellular phones). 
This will increase the value of the marginal product of labor, inducing firms to expand their 
operations, most likely leading them to increase their demand for labor. Firms will also 
likely seek to increase their productive capacity, raising the level of investment in the econ-
omy. These changes will lead to higher household income for three reasons: (1) employ-
ment increases, (2) wages rise, and (3) rising corporate earnings make the corporations’ 
stockholders wealthier. For all of these reasons, households will raise their consumption. 
Thus certain types of technological improvements can lead to increases in labor demand 
and increases in aggregate economic activity, including investment and consumption.
A version of this view appears in the work of classical economists, most notably, that of 
Arthur Cecil Pigou.4 It was revived and extended in the 1980s in what came to be known 
as real business cycle theory—a school of thought that emphasizes the role of technology 
in causing economic fluctuations.5
But although we know from Chapters 20 and 21 that the rate of technological progress 
is at the root of long-run variation in economic growth and technological breakthroughs 
could cause a rapid increase in a particular industry’s output, purely technological theories 
have difficulty explaining recessions in which real GDP falls. “Technological regress,” in 
which the technological capabilities of an economy deteriorate, seems an unlikely explana-
tion for recessions. It is unlikely, for example, that a negative technology shock caused the 
Great Depression.
Nevertheless, the rate of technological progress is believed to play a key role in long-
term variation in economic growth. As we saw in Chapter 21, countries that consistently 
develop new technologies, or import cutting-edge technologies from other countries, will 
attain high rates of growth. So technological progress is a very important determinant of 
long-term fluctuations in growth—for instance, over several decades—even though it is not 
the main force driving recessions.
Proponents of real business cycle theory tend to also emphasize the importance of 
changing input prices—especially the price of oil. We can think of an increase in the price 
of oil as a decrease in the productivity of firms that use oil. Because almost all firms use 
oil in one form or another—oil products are a key source of energy—changes in the price 
of oil function like technology changes. As oil price changes can be abrupt, including 
large increases in the price of oil, this factor does help to explain recessions.
2. Sentiments and Multipliers: Explanations from John Maynard Keynes  
Many modern analyses of economic fluctuations build on the insights of the British 
economist John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), who was an academic, stock market trader, 
and a frequent advisor to the British government. (In case you want to talk about him over 
dinner in your dining hall, Keynes is pronounced “cains.”)
Real business cycle theory is the 
school of thought that emphasizes 
the role of changes in technology in 
causing economic fluctuations.

Chapter 26  |  Short-Run Fluctuations
Keynes was 46 years old at the start of the Great Depression. As the Depression took 
hold, Keynes began to develop new theories that attempted to explain its causes. This work 
culminated in his groundbreaking book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and 
Money.6 His ideas also had novel implications for government policy. Keynes was highly 
controversial during his time and remains so today, though few would deny his enormous 
influence on modern macroeconomics.
Keynes believed in a phenomenon that he dubbed animal spirits, which represent psy-
chological factors that lead to changes in the mood of consumers and businesses, thereby 
affecting consumption, investment, and GDP. In Keynes’s view, the animal spirits in an 
economy could fluctuate sharply even as the underlying fundamental features of the econ-
omy changed relatively little. For example, a period of heightened optimism could give 
way to a period of deep pessimism even though the economic fundamentals—technology, 
physical capital, and human capital—hadn’t changed much at all.
Animal spirits are in fact one example of a broader phenomenon: changing sentiments, 
which include changes in expectations and changes in the (actual or perceived) uncertainty 
facing firms and households. Changes in sentiments lead to changes in household con-
sumption and firm investment.
For example, consider what happens when firms expect future demand for their products 
to be low. Such pessimism will have a direct effect on labor demand. When United ­Airlines 
becomes pessimistic about future demand for air travel, it cuts back its hiring of flight 
­attendants and pilots. It also cuts back its orders for new planes. This reduces ­demand for 
planes at manufacturers like Boeing. Consequently, labor demand both at United ­Airlines 
and Boeing shifts to the left.
Consider the effects of this pessimism on GDP. Let’s begin by analyzing the fall in in-
vestment that occurs when United Airlines cuts back its orders for new planes. Recall the 
national income accounting identity from Chapter 19:
Y = C + I + G + X − M.
The change in the behavior of United Airlines causes a decline in investment in the econ-
omy (I) and thus also in GDP (Y). But this decline could be at least partially offset by 
an increase in consumption (C), government expenditure (G), or the difference between 
exports and imports (X − M). With completely offsetting movements in C, G, or X − M, 
it is possible for GDP, Y, to remain unchanged despite a sharp decline in investment. For 
example, if I falls by $5 billion, C could rise by $5 billion, offsetting the reduction in I.
When firms are turning pessimistic and cutting back employment and investment, how-
ever, households are unlikely to increase their consumption. In fact, households face a 
heightened risk of losing their jobs because of the fall in investment. Accordingly, in most 
instances, consumption moves in the same direction as investment (consistent with our 
discussion of co-movement above).
The implications for employment were displayed in Exhibit 26.6. Particularly when 
there is downward wage rigidity, a change in labor demand will have a large effect on em-
ployment. Hence, a fall in investment will tend to produce a leftward shift in firms’ labor 
demand curves, reducing employment and ultimately reducing GDP.
The implications of households becoming more pessimistic are similar: they will cut 
their current spending to build up their “rainy-day” savings and thereby prepare for eco-
nomic problems ahead. This translates into a decline in the current demand for the products 
of many firms, shifting the labor demand curve of those firms to the left.
This discussion hints at another major element of Keynes’s theory: the possibility that a 
modest shock could hit the economy and generate a cascade of follow-on effects that ultimately 
cause a much larger contraction. For example, an increase in pessimism among airline execu-
tives will have a series of immediate effects—for instance, lower hiring at United Airlines—
that might cascade into a series of follow-on effects—lower hiring at aircraft manufacturers, 
like Boeing. The cascade keeps building as the ripples spread to more and more interconnected 
firms, which each start to cut back hiring and shift their own labor demand curves to the left. 
The pessimism might also spread to households, which, sensing fewer opportunities in the 
labor market, start to reduce their demand for goods and services. The economic mechanisms 
that cause an initial shock to be amplified by follow-on effects are called multipliers.
To illustrate the potential power of multipliers, imagine that a stock market decline causes 
a drop in consumer confidence and reduces households’ willingness to spend. Such an event 
Animal spirits are psychological 
factors that lead to changes in the 
mood of consumers or businesses, 
thereby affecting consumption, 
investment, and GDP.
Sentiments include changes in 
expectations about future economic 
activity, changes in uncertainty 
facing firms and households, 
and fluctuations in animal spirits. 
Changes in sentiments lead to 
changes in household consumption 
and firm investment.
Multipliers refer to economic 
mechanisms that amplify the initial 
impact of a shock.

will cause many other dominos to fall. Firms will cut back production and lay off employees. 
Those newly unemployed workers will be unable to buy goods and services, leading firms 
that previously sold goods to these consumers to scale back production even more. According 
to Keynes, such a cycle could have calamitous effects as each round of layoffs further dam-
ages the economy, setting off another wave of layoffs. Such cascades of effects will amplify—
or multiply—the impact of the initial shock whether the initial shock is negative or positive 
news. Hence a bit of good economic news can also produce a cascade of positive effects as 
consumers increase their demand for goods and services and firms respond by shifting the la-
bor demand curve to the right, all of which multiplies the impact of the initial news. Keynes’s 
theory of multipliers plays an important role in many modern economic models.
It is also useful to note that the workings of multipliers involve an element of a self-­
fulfilling prophecy, since the expectation of an event, such as a leftward shift in labor 
demand in the future, induces actions that lead to the realization of that event, that is, 
firms cutting their employment now. This is because sentiments can be powerful catalysts 
of economic change. For example, when a large number of economic actors become pes-
simistic about the future state of the economy, their resulting actions can indeed reduce 
the level of future economic activity, partially or even fully justifying their pessimistic 
beliefs. Consumers might stop buying goods and services. Firms might stop investing 
in plants and equipment. Labor demand will then shift to the left, reducing employment 
and raising unemployment. This notion of a self-fulfilling prophecy also highlights that 
a change in expectations driven by animal spirits might turn out to be “rational”; when 
households and firms become pessimistic about the economy, the economy will contract 
as a result of people’s pessimistic behavior. So the pessimism ends up justifying itself!
3. Monetary and Financial Factors: Explanations from Milton Friedman  
Monetary factors are yet another force that drives business cycles. As we saw in the last 
chapter, money supply affects nominal GDP. Typically, a fall in nominal GDP, driven by 
a sharp decline in the money supply, will not only affect the aggregate price level but also 
real GDP. In this case, changes in the money supply will also drive business cycles. The 
major proponent of this view has been one of the few macroeconomists to rival Keynes in 
terms of genius and influence—Milton Friedman.7
To understand how monetary factors drive fluctuations in real GDP, consider a scenario 
in which contractionary monetary policy causes the money supply (M2) to fall sharply.
The fall in the money supply will cause the price level to fall, as predicted by the quan-
tity theory of money (Chapter 25). A fall in the price level reduces employment because of 
downward wage rigidity. To understand why, note that a drop in the aggregate price level im-
plies that firms have cut their output prices reducing their value of marginal product of labor. 
Consequently, each firm demands a lower quantity of labor at a given wage. In other words, 
a fall in output prices shifts the labor demand curve to the left. If wages were to fall as much 
as output prices, then firms would employ as many workers as they had employed before the 
fall in output prices. However, with a downward rigid wage (recall Chapter 23), wages won’t 
fall and optimizing firms will instead cut back the number of employed workers.
In addition, as we saw in Chapter 25 contractionary monetary policy causes the real inter-
est rate to rise. Recall from Chapter 24 that the real interest rate is the price that a firm pays for 
another one of its inputs—physical capital. A rise in the real interest rate will therefore make 
production more costly. Because physical capital is needed by labor, the rising cost of physi-
cal capital leads firms to hire less labor, implying a leftward shift in the demand for labor.
Disruptions in the operation of the credit market also cause economic fluctuations. 
In Chapter 24 we saw how the supply and demand for credit determine the equilibrium 
interest rate and the amount of credit in the economy. Disruptions in the credit market—
for instance, bank failures or other types of financial crises—will reduce the amount 
of investment and consumption, thereby lowering real GDP and employment. Hence, 
a leftward shift in the supply of credit will shift firms’ labor demand curves to the left.
Multipliers and Economic Fluctuations
Multipliers, which we discussed in the context of changes in sentiment, can amplify the 
effects of any economic shock, ­regardless of whether the shock arises from changes in 
technology, sentiment, or financial markets. Exhibit 26.8 illustrates a simple feedback loop 
that arises in a contracting economy with multipliers. A shock to consumption causes firms 
A self-fulfilling prophecy is a 
situation in which the expectations 
of an event (such as a left shift in 
labor demand in the future) induce 
actions that lead to that event.

to reduce ­labor demand, shifting the labor demand curve to the 
left. The leftward shift in labor demand leads to layoffs, reducing 
household income and further reducing household consumption. 
The cycle continues in this way, increasing the depth of the eco-
nomic contraction with each loop around the circle.
The effects of multipliers on wages and employment are 
graphed in Exhibit 26.9 for the case of flexible wages. Labor 
supply is shown as the red curve and labor demand as blue. The 
economy begins at the equilibrium labeled “1: Pre-recession.”  
A shock causes the ­labor demand curve to shift to the left. The 
economy is now at a new temporary equilibrium, at the point labeled “2: After shock.” We 
­refer to this point as a temporary equilibrium because it does not factor in multiplier ­effects. 
In particular, the first wave of layoffs leads unemployed workers to cut back their ­demand 
for goods and services, leading the businesses that provide those goods and services to 
further reduce their labor demand—another leftward shift in the labor demand curve. 
This moves the economy to the full-blown recession equilibrium labeled “3: Trough.”  
A trough is the low point of real GDP in a recession. This exhibit plots two shifts in the 
labor demand curve: 
	
a.	 The initial shock to labor demand (the first shift to the left).
	
b.	 A second leftward shift of labor demand due to the layoffs resulting from the initial 
shock. This second shift to the left takes into account multiplier effects.
Exhibit 26.8 Multipliers in a Contracting Economy
Start the feedback loop at any point in the circle.  
For example, a shock to consumption causes the firms that 
produce consumption goods to reduce labor demand, 
shifting the labor demand curve to the left. The leftward 
shift in labor demand leads to layoffs, which in turn re-
duces household income and further reduces household 
consumption. The cycle continues in the same way, increas-
ing the depth of the economic contraction with each loop 
around the circle. In this way, the impact of an initial shock 
is multiplied.

unemployment rise.
Household income falls.
Firms’ revenues fall.

­reductions in labor demand—more 
­leftward shifts of the labor demand 
curve—moving the economy to the 
­full-blown recession equilibrium  
“3: Trough.” A trough is the low

In principle, there could be many more leftward shifts in labor demand, each driven by 
the last round of layoffs. In practice, economies eventually stabilize and the downward spi-
ral stops. For instance, new businesses replace old firms that have gone bankrupt. If a firm 
does not have enough demand to remain profitable, the physical and human capital that was 
employed at that firm will eventually be reallocated to other firms, especially firms in other 
types of business. The entry of these new firms causes labor demand to stop shifting to the 
left and eventually start shifting back to the right.
The multiplier loop depicted in Exhibit 26.8 leaves out many of the mechanisms that are 
important in a modern economy. Exhibit 26.10 adds some of these mechanisms, providing 
a more complete picture of the factors that multiply the impact of an initial negative shock. 
These mechanisms include declines in asset prices, such as the value of stocks, bonds, 
and housing; rising rates of mortgage defaults, which weaken banks’ balance sheets; ris-
ing rates of household bankruptcies, generating defaults on numerous types of consumer 
credit including credit card loans; rising rates of firm bankruptcies, causing their lend-
ers to ­absorb large losses; and falling levels of financial intermediation as banks become 
unwilling or unable to extend new loans, even to their existing customers. All of these 
mechanisms create additional multiplier effects and drive down the level of consumption 
and investment, further depressing labor demand. Falling labor demand leads to additional 
declines in employment and GDP, further weakening the economy and generating addi-
tional rounds of multiplier effects.
Equilibrium in the Short Run,  
with Multipliers and Downward Wage Rigidity
A more complete picture of recessionary shocks can be seen by combining downward 
wage rigidity and multipliers. Both of these ingredients amplify the impact of shifts in 
labor demand on employment. Here is how a shock plays out:
	
a.	 An initial shock shifts the labor demand curve to the left.
	
b.	 Downward wage rigidity leads firms to adjust to the initial shock by sharply cutting 
employment rather than reducing both employment and wages by a modest amount.
	
c.	 Multipliers cause the labor demand curve to shift leftward even more.
These three factors are illustrated in Exhibit 26.11. Before any shocks, the economy is at the 
equilibrium labeled “1: Pre-recession.” The initial shock causes the economy to move to the 
new temporary equilibrium labeled “2: After shock.” Because we are assuming that the wage 
is downward rigid, only employment adjusts. When the multipliers kick in, the labor demand 
curve shifts left again and the economy ends up at the equilibrium ­labeled “3: Trough.” Both 
the downward wage rigidity and the multipliers have amplified the ­contractionary impact of 
the initial recessionary shock. Without downward wage rigidity and multipliers, the initial 
leftward shift of the labor demand curve would have moved the economy to the equilibrium 
Exhibit 26.10 Additional Multipliers
Start the multiplier loop at any point in the circle. For 
example, a shock that lowers consumption causes the 
firms that manufacture consumption goods to ­reduce 
­labor demand, shifting the labor demand curve to the 
left. The weak economy leads to layoffs, declining ­asset 
prices, mortgage defaults, household bankruptcies, firm 
­bankruptcies, and declining financial intermediation 
(as banks struggle to survive and some banks fail). All of 
this in turn reduces consumption and investment. The 
cycle ­continues, increasing the depth of the economic 
­contraction with each loop around the circle.
Layoffs and unemployment rise.
Household income falls.
Asset prices fall.
Mortgage defaults rise.
Household bankruptcies rise.
Firm bankruptcies rise.
Financial intermediation falls.

labeled “A.” With downward wage rigidity and multipliers, the economy moves all the way 
to “3: Trough,” which features a much greater fall in employment than point A.
Equilibrium in the Medium Run:  
Partial Recovery and Full Recovery
There are many forces—some market-driven and some policy-driven—that tend to reverse 
the effects of a recession in the course of a few years. We refer to this 2- to 3-year time 
horizon as the medium run to distinguish it from the short run, which corresponds to a few 
quarters, and the long run, which corresponds to periods of a decade or more. In our discus-
sion, we divide the recovery mechanisms into two categories.
	
i.	 The labor demand curve shifts back to the right due to market forces.
	
ii.	 The labor demand curve shifts back to the right due to expansionary government 
policies.
Let’s now explore each of these in more detail.
	
i.	 The labor demand curve shifts back to the right due to market forces. This rebound 
occurs for many reasons, and here are the most important ones:
• Labor demand partially recovers (shifts to the right) when excess inventory has 
been sold off. For example, after an excessive economic boom in housing con-
struction there will be little need for the construction of more new homes, caus-
ing the labor demand curve for construction workers to shift to the left. However, 
the inventory of unsold homes will eventually be sold off, and at that point con-
struction of new homes will start up again, shifting the labor demand curve back 
to the right. This effect applies to any business that holds an inventory of unsold 
goods, like car or computer manufacturers. Inventories won’t last forever. When 
they run out, the firm usually increases production. A rightward shift in the labor 
demand curve is plotted in Exhibit 26.12.
• Labor demand partially recovers (shifts to the right) when technological advanc-
es encourage firms to expand their activities. For example, after the 2007–2009 
recession, new drilling technologies enabled energy companies to profitably ex-
tract natural gas and oil from oil-shale geological deposits. This led to a rapid 
expansion in the U.S. energy industry, including drilling activity, pipeline con-
struction, and the growth of industries that have a comparative advantage in 
regions with ample energy resources.
• Labor demand partially recovers (shifts to the right) as the banking system—and the 
rest of the system of financial intermediation—recuperates and businesses are again 
Exhibit 26.11 Multipliers in an 
Economy with Rigid Wages
A leftward shift in the labor de-
mand curve takes the economy 
from point “1: Pre-recession” to 
point “2: After shock.” Multipliers 
cause the ­labor demand curve to 
shift leftward even more, moving 
the rigid-wage ­equilibrium to point 
“3: Trough.” Without downward 
wage rigidity and multipliers, the 
initial leftward shift of the labor de-
mand curve would have moved the 
economy to the ­equilibrium labeled 
“A.” With ­downward wage rigidity 
and ­multipliers, the economy moves 
all the way to “3: Trough,” which 
­represents a much greater fall in 
­employment than Point A.

able to use credit to finance their activities. During the 2007–2009 financial crisis, 
many small firms had a hard time obtaining loans from their banks. When the banks 
that survived the crisis returned to health, they became more willing to lend to busi-
nesses, enabling those businesses to expand their ­operations and hire more workers. 
The availability of credit shifted the borrowers’ labor demand curve to the right.
	
ii.	 The labor demand curve shifts back to the right due to expansionary government 
policies. The next chapter focuses exclusively on these issues. For now, we sum-
marize the key policy levers:
• The central bank can use monetary policy to shift labor demand to the right. Low-
ering interest rates stimulates both firm investment and household consumption.
• Labor demand also shifts to the right as overall inflation raises firms’ output 
­prices. A rise in output price makes production, and thus increasing employment, 
more profitable at a given wage. This shifts the labor demand curve to the right. 
In panel (a) of Exhibit 26.13, we see the implications of this inflation-driven right-
ward shift of the labor demand curve. With wages pinned down by the downward 
wage rigidity, the rightward shift of the labor demand curve causes a movement 
from point A to point B, which corresponds to a partial recovery in employment.
At this point, you might rightly wonder about the labor supply curve. 
Shouldn’t inflation also impact labor supply? As inflation increases output pric-
es, a given wage will buy a smaller consumption bundle. For example, if all pric-
es were to double, a worker who supplied the same hours of work at the same 
wage would be able to consume only half of what she did before. As a result of 
inflation, this worker—and, with the same reasoning, all workers—will be will-
ing to supply fewer hours to the market at a given wage. The resulting leftward 
shift of the labor supply curve is also shown in panel (a) of Exhibit 26.13. The 
important point, however, is that as long as we stay at the downward rigid wage, 
this shift of labor supply has no impact, and employment is simply given by 
the intersection of the labor demand curve and the horizontal line representing 
the downward rigid wage. This brings us to the important conclusion that when 
wages are pinned down by downward wage rigidity, inflation-driven shifts of the 
labor demand curve will increase employment.
This analysis also tells us when shifts of the labor supply curve will actually 
start to matter. If the shifts in question were large enough, which would result 
from high levels of inflation, then the wage will no longer be pinned down by 
downward wage rigidity. Rather, the market clearing wage would rise above 
the downward rigid wage, as shown in panel (b) of Exhibit 26.13. In this case, 
the equilibrium wage has risen above the downward rigid wage. Once such an

Exhibit 26.13 The Effect of Inflation  
on the Labor Market Equilibrium
In panel (a), a downward rigid wage  
(represented by the horizontal line) pre-
vents the labor market from clearing. 
The “­original labor demand curve” and 
the “original labor supply curve” cross 
at the point labeled C. At this point, the 
­market clearing wage is below the down-
ward rigid wage. Accordingly, the original 
labor market equilibrium is point A, where 
the downward rigid wage intersects the 
­original labor demand curve. Inflation shifts 
the labor demand curve to the right (firms 
can sell their output goods at higher prices) 
and shifts the labor supply curve to the left 
(a given wage has less ­purchasing power). 
Even after these shifts, the market-clearing 
wage (labeled D) is ­still below the down-
ward rigid wage. ­Accordingly, the post-
inflation labor market equilibrium is point B, 
where the downward rigid wage intersects 
the ­labor demand curve after inflation.
In panel (b), the original labor market equi-
librium is point A, so the downward rigid 
wage is above the original market-clearing 
wage (labeled point C). Inflation causes the 
labor demand curve to shift to the right  
and the labor supply curve to shift to the 
left. Now these inflation-induced shifts are 
large enough to move the market-clearing 
wage above the downward rigid wage.  
The final labor market equilibrium is point 
E. Wages have now risen above the down-
ward rigid wage.

equilibrium wage is reached, further increases in inflation will shift the labor

employment unchanged.
• The government also uses fiscal policy (government spending and taxes) to shift 
the labor demand curve to the right. Increasing government spending increases 
the demand for the products that firms produce, shifting the labor demand curve 
to the right. Decreasing taxes gives firms and consumers more after-tax income, 
thereby increasing their purchasing power and increasing demand for the prod-
ucts that firms produce, shifting the labor demand curve to the right.
Exhibit 26.14 puts all of these market-based and policy-driven effects together to 
­illustrate a complete cycle of contraction and recovery. Initially, the economy is at point “1.” 
The combination of downward rigid wages and multipliers creates a rapid contraction in 
labor demand, which moves the economy to point “2.” This is the trough of employment. 
The labor demand curve then starts to shift back toward its pre-recession level due to both 
market mechanisms and government intervention. Inflation plays two roles, shifting the la-
bor demand curve to the right and the labor supply curve to the left. At the beginning of the 
recovery, the equilibrium remains at the rigid wage and the economy shifts from point “2” 
to point “3.”

Exhibit 26.14 Full Recovery
The labor demand curve begins at “Labor demand pre-recession” and then shifts to the 
left: “Labor demand at trough.” Because the wage is downward rigid, it does not fall 
and the economy transitions from point “1” to point “2.” As the labor demand curve 
shifts back to the right (“Labor demand after partial recovery”), the level of employment 
partially rebounds to point “3.” At this point, the downward rigid wage is still preventing 
the labor market from clearing. ­Eventually, the combination of rightward shifts in labor 
demand and leftward (inflation-driven) shifts in labor supply lead the economy to point 
“4.” At this point, downward wage rigidity is no longer a constraint because the market-
clearing wage is above the downward rigid wage.

Nominal Wages versus Real Wages
In this chapter (as in Chapter 23), we’ve conducted the analysis using the actual wages 
that workers are paid. Actual wages are also called nominal wages, which distin-
guishes them from wages adjusted for inflation, or real wages. The distinction between 
nominal and real wages is similar to the distinction between nominal and real GDP. To 
calculate real wages, we divide nominal wages by a measure of overall prices. Real 
wages can be interpreted as the (price-level-adjusted) buying power of nominal wages.
The entire analysis of labor demand and labor supply can be equivalently carried 
out using real wages. The change in variables wouldn’t change the conclusions, but 
it would highlight different elements of the story. If we focus on real wages, we em-
phasize that firms base their hiring decisions on the ratio of how much they pay their 
workers (nominal wages) and how much they charge their customers (their output 
prices). It would also emphasize, as we have noted above, that in their labor supply 
decisions, workers care about the buying power of their wages—in other words, the 
real consumption bundles that they can afford with their wages.
Eventually, the combination of rightward shifts in labor demand and leftward shifts in 
labor supply lead the economy to point “4.” At this point, downward wage rigidity is no 
longer a constraint because the market-clearing wage is above the downward rigid wage.
In this particular example, the economy returns to its original level of employment. This 
won’t be the case if the original level of employment was generated by an unsustainable 
economic boom.
Exhibit 26.14 also shows that the post-recession wage is above the pre-recession wage. 
This results from the accumulation of price inflation during and after the recession. This 
inflation has lifted both output prices and wages.
Actual wages are also called nominal 
wages, which distinguishes them 
from wages adjusted for inflation, or 
real wages. To calculate real wages, 
economists divide nominal wages by a 
measure of overall prices, for example 
the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

We have so far focused on recessions. The framework we presented can also be used for 
studying economic booms. Returning to the same example we used earlier, suppose that 
now United Airlines becomes optimistic about the demand for its products. This will shift 
its labor demand curve to the right. When many firms become optimistic about their future 
demand, the aggregate labor demand curve will shift to the right, as shown in Exhibit 26.15.
One important difference from our analysis of leftward shifts is that there is no issue of 
rigid wages in this case because, as we emphasized in Chapter 23, workers are often un-
willing to accept cuts in their wages, but this has no equivalent for increases in their wages. 
This implies that there is downward, but not upward, wage rigidity. For this reason, in  
Exhibit 26.15, following the rightward shift in the labor demand curve, employment 
changes along a labor supply curve (and not along a horizontal line as in, for example, 
Exhibit 26.11).
Though the impact of the rightward shift in the labor demand curve is not exacerbated 
by wage rigidities, multiplier effects will continue to be present, amplifying the initial shift. 
For example, as United increases its purchases of airplanes and other inputs, this will cause 
the firms that supply United to shift their labor demand curves to the right. Increases in 
labor demand will tend to raise household income, causing households to start consuming 
more, triggering another round of multiplier effects. As a result of these multiplier effects, 
there is a further shift in the labor demand curve, as shown in Exhibit 26.15.
Modeling Expansions
26.3 
Downward rigidity in nominal wages, one of the factors that amplifies negative 
macroeconomic shocks, plays a similar role when we look at the labor market through 
the lens of real wages. In particular, downward nominal wage rigidity implies that, 
because nominal wages cannot fall, real wages do not immediately adjust either. As a 
result, the labor market does not reach the market-clearing real wage.
But in the presence of inflation, real wages can fall even if nominal wages don’t. 
Because real wages are the ratio of nominal wages to a price index, and because in-
flation raises the price index, real wages will fall when (1) the price index rises and 
(2) nominal wages are fixed. This is exactly the scenario we have highlighted in panel 
(a) of Exhibit 26.13. As such, the analysis of real wages provides another way of 
­explaining how modest inflation might help an economy with downward rigid nomi-
nal wages recover from a recession.
Exhibit 26.15 Rightward Shift in 
the Labor Demand Curve
Starting from a normally 
­functioning economy, a ­positive 
economic shock will lead to a 
boom. First, the direct impact of 
the positive economic shock shifts 
the labor demand curve to the 
right. This impact is amplified by 
multipliers. Because wages are 
flexible upward, all of the adjust-
ment to the shifts in the labor 
­demand curve takes place along 
the labor supply curve.

T
he causes of the recession of 2007–2009 can be likened to chains of dominos, 
with one negative shock setting off another in a sequence of events that cascaded 
throughout the American and global economies. Three key factors ­appear to have 
played the central roles in the crisis: (1) a fall in housing prices, which caused a collapse in 
new construction; (2) a sharp drop in consumption; and (3) spiraling mortgage defaults that 
caused many bank failures, leading the entire financial system to freeze up.
Let’s first zoom out to take an aerial snapshot:
1. During the pre-recession years of 2000–2006, a run-up in housing prices caused 
a boom in housing construction, which produced a large stock of newly constructed 
homes. When housing prices fell sharply from 2006 to 2009, homebuilders rapidly re-
duced their rate of new construction because they already held a large inventory of new 
homes and the falling prices made new construction unprofitable. Consequently, their 
labor demand curves shifted sharply to the left.
2. The decline in housing prices in turn reduced many consumers’ wealth and cur-
tailed their ability to borrow more against their homes—a scenario that in turn sharply 
reduced consumption. The firms that produce the goods and services that consumers 
buy were suddenly faced with a substantial drop in demand for their products. Accord-
ingly, they cut back production and their labor demand curves shifted to the left.
3. The decline in housing values led to millions of mortgage defaults (for reasons we 
explain below). These mortgages, which were held on the balance sheets of many large 
banks, pushed those banks to the brink—and in some cases over the brink—of solvency. 
As banks failed, or cut their lending activity to increase their reserves and strengthen their 
balance sheets, credit to the private sector fell, causing borrowing firms to cut their produc-
tion and shifting their labor demand curves to the left. The decline in credit to households 
reduced their consumption and triggered another round of adverse demand shifts.
This was the big picture. We now zoom in on each of these economic events and look 
at the data.
Housing and Construction: A Burst Bubble
Many economists characterize the rapid rise of housing prices between the late 1990s 
and 2006 as a bubble, meaning that the significant increase in asset prices (in this case 
housing assets) did not reflect the true long-run value of the asset. Exhibit 26.16 plots a 
What caused the recession of 2007–2009?
Economic booms also have a dark side. If before the beginning of the boom the econ-
omy is close to full employment and full capacity utilization (meaning that the unemploy-
ment rate is low and firms are employing most of their capacity), there will be relatively 
little room for the economy to grow. If so, the optimism or other factors that might have 
originally triggered the boom are likely to get reversed at some point. But such a rever-
sal involves precisely the sort of leftward shift in labor demand we have analyzed in this 
chapter. These leftward shifts tend to create negative multiplier effects and might take the 
economy into a recession rather than gently back to its pre-boom level.
This dark side of economic booms raises some of the most difficult challenges for poli-
cymakers. Prudent policymaking would involve attempting to control the economic booms 
in order to limit the potential negative effects when the boom is ultimately reversed. How-
ever, the increase in employment and the fall in unemployment accompanying economic 
booms increase the popularity of policymakers, encouraging them to let economic booms 
continue or even to fan their flames (especially during election years).

monthly index of housing prices adjusted for inflation in ten major U.S. cities from 1987 
to 2013. Notice that the index rose sharply from 100 in January 2000 to 190 in May 2006. 
Then everything fell apart—the index collapsed to a value of 120 by April 2009 and con-
tinued falling a bit more after that. The bubble in housing prices had burst.
Falling housing prices had a devastating effect on the home construction industry.

investment in new home construction started falling after peaking in the third quarter of 
2005. The exhibit shows that when the dust had settled in 2009, the rate of home construc-
tion had fallen by nearly 60 percent.
Then the other shoe dropped. As the home construction industry shrank, employment 
in the industry also plummeted. At its peak in April 2006, there were 3.5 million jobs in

the residential construction industry. By 2010, the number of jobs had fallen to 2 million, 
a 43 percent decline. Related industries also got hit as all real estate prices fell, including 
commercial real estate, like office buildings and malls. For example, the non-residential 
construction industry fell from employment of 4.4 million in early 2008—at the start of the 
recession—to 3.4 million in 2010.
Putting all of the pieces together, the sharp drop in real estate prices caused a large left-
ward shift in the labor demand curve for construction jobs, which then led to a sharp drop 
in employment in the construction industry. The key step—a leftward shift in the labor 
demand curve—was plotted in Exhibit 26.6. Panel (a) of that exhibit plots the flexible wage 
case. Panel (c) plots the case of downward wage rigidity, which features an even larger fall 
in employment.
The decline in economic activity in the construction industry also led to multiplier ef-
fects. Many construction workers lost their incomes, and many businesses that served those 
workers—home supply stores like Home Depot—saw demand for their products plummet. 
Falling home construction and home sales also lowered demand for home appliances—like 
washing machines and refrigerators. These multiplier effects magnified the effects of the 
fall in home prices, shifting the aggregate labor demand curve further leftward and deepen-
ing the fall in aggregate employment.
Cuts in Consumption
The housing price declines were also associated with large reductions in overall household 
consumption—the second key factor in the 2007–2009 recession.
During the early 2000s, many households had increased their consumption by using funds 
that they had borrowed from banks. In most cases, this borrowing took the form of mort-
gages—for instance, taking out a second mortgage in addition to a first mortgage. “Cash-out” 
refinancings were also popular—when interest rates fell, homeowners with an existing mort-
gage would lower their interest rate and increase the size of their mortgage, taking the differ-
ence as a cash payout. At the peak of the housing bubble, consumers used second mortgages 
and “cash-out” refinancing to extract $400 billion of wealth per year from their homes. Even 
consumers who did not take our more mortgage debt tended to increase their real consump-
tion during the run-up in housing prices from 2000 to 2006, because home price rises increase 
wealth and consumers’ perceptions of what they can afford to consume.
That wealthy feeling started to vanish in 2007. By March 2009, U.S. households had 
lost about $15 trillion in net worth—both the housing market and the stock market had 
crashed. Most households cut back their consumption, causing aggregate real consump-
tion to decline by 2.7 percent from the start of the recession in the fourth quarter of 2007 
to the end of the recession in the second quarter of 2009. This decline translated into a 
significantly lower demand for the products of firms, creating another multiplier effect that 
shifted the labor demand curve further to the left.
Spiraling Mortgage Defaults and Bank Failures
Falling house prices also led mortgage delinquencies to skyrocket: many borrowers stopped 
making their required mortgage payments. For example, suppose that a family had bought a 
$300,000 home with almost no down payment in 2006. If we assume that the home’s value 
followed the ten-city index, this home would have fallen to a value of $200,000 by 2009. 
However, the mortgage debt would not have been affected by the fall in the home value, 
leaving the borrower owing nearly $300,000 (very little of the initial mortgage would have 
been paid off within the first 3 years of home ownership). Consequently, the family would 
find itself with a debt of almost $300,000 on a house worth only $200,000. Owing more 
on your home than it is worth is referred to as being “upside down” or “underwater.” If a

to repay the mortgage. In many U.S. states, households in this situation have a strong incen-
tive to default on their mortgages—that is, stop making their mortgage payments and walk 
away. This incentive is further strengthened when households face economic hardship (for 
example, because of unemployment or other negative labor income shocks).
And that is exactly what millions of households did, either because they didn’t have a 
job and couldn’t afford to pay their mortgage, or because they recognized that it wasn’t 
optimal to keep paying interest on a mortgage that vastly exceeded the value of the home. 
Previously, when home prices were rising, foreclosure rates stayed around 1.7 percent 
per year. In other words, 1.7 percent of U.S. homes with a mortgage entered foreclosure 
each year. Exhibit 26.18 shows that the foreclosure rate rose to 5.4 percent during the 
financial crisis. To appreciate the significance of that foreclosure rate, consider that there 
are ­approximately 75 million owner-occupied homes in the United States and about two-
thirds, or 50 million, have a mortgage. So a foreclosure rate of 5.4 percent translates into al-
most 3 million foreclosed homes per year at the peak of the crisis. In total, about 10 ­million 
foreclosures took place from 2007 to 2012.
Home foreclosures were terrible news not only for homeowners but also for banks. 
Consider that when a bank seizes a home that is worth $200,000, on which the outstanding 
mortgage is $300,000, the bank has no way of recouping its money. At best, it can sell the 
house for $200,000, realizing a $100,000 loss on its $300,000 loan. In practice, the fore-
closure sale yields a price significantly below $200,000. With so many homes being sold 
simultaneously, and with no homeowner to put flowers in window pots, mow lawns, or 
keep vandals from trashing the empty houses or ripping out copper pipes, it’s easy to end 
up selling the house for far less than $200,000.
Consequently, banks suffered enormous losses on their portfolios of mortgages. In 2005, 
during the run-up in home prices, banks recorded losses in their real estate portfolios equal 
to only 0.2 percent of the value of their real estate loans. In 2009, banks booked real estate 
losses that were 40 times greater —8 percent of the total value of their real estate loans.
Many banks could not withstand the extent of the hit they took on their mortgage hold-
ings. Among the 5,000 banks regulated by the FDIC, about 400 failed from 2007 to 2011.
But the biggest story of the 2007–2009 recession was the failure of Lehman Brothers, a 
bank that was not regulated by the FDIC. Lehman did not originate home mortgages of its 
own, but it did originate commercial mortgages (for businesses) and it did buy mortgages 
that other banks had issued. As those mortgages lost value in 2008, Lehman Brothers lost 
huge sums and perhaps more importantly also lost the confidence of its business partners.

Within a two-week period in September of 2008, many of Lehman’s biggest institu-
tional trading partners and lenders stopped doing business with the bank. Each new defec-
tion bred more uncertainty and a widening loss of confidence in Lehman’s future. Lehman 
experienced an institutional bank run, a special kind of bank run that we discussed in 
Chapter 24. The bank customers running for the exits were large financial institutions like 
other large banks and hedge funds. Soon, no institutions would lend money to Lehman, and 
at that point Lehman was both illiquid and insolvent.
The failure of Lehman Brothers initiated a financial panic that suddenly threatened the 
prosperity of the world economy. Other major bank crises followed in ­Iceland, the United 
Kingdom, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Switzerland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, 
Spain, Italy, and Cyprus. Suddenly, many countries teetered on the precipice of another 
depression.
As financial markets fell, the banking sector cut back on loans to businesses because 
failed banks obviously couldn’t make loans. Even the surviving banks were hesitant to make 
loans, afraid that these new loans—to households and businesses—would soon end up in 
default. The retrenchment of the financial sector created yet another multiplier effect, which 
reduced consumption and investment and shifted the labor demand curve further to the left.

What caused the recession 
of 2007–2009?
Real housing prices rose 
90 percent from 2000 to 
2006 and then fell almost 
completely back to their 
2000 level. Falling house 
prices led to a collapse in 
the home building indus-
try, to a sharp decline in 
real consumption, and to a 
jump in mortgage defaults. 
­Approximately 10 million 
U.S. home foreclosures  
occurred from 2007 through 
2012. The defaulting  
mortgages caused  
400 bank failures, including 
the spectacular failure of the 
investment bank Lehman 
Brothers.

Chapter 26  |  Short-Run Fluctuations
Summary
All economies experience economic fluctuations—in other words, the growth 
rate fluctuates from year to year. During recessions, real GDP contracts and 
unemployment increases. On rare occasions a recession turns into a depression, 
like the Great Depression which started in 1929. From 1929 to 1933 real GDP 
declined by 26 percent, and the rate of unemployment rose from 3 percent to  
25 percent.
Economic fluctuations display three key properties:
1.	 Co-movement: consumption, investment, GDP, and employment gener-
ally fall and rise together. Unemployment moves in the opposite direction.
2.	 Limited predictability: economic fluctuations are not pendulum-like with 
regular up and down cycles. It is difficult to predict in advance when an 
economy will enter a recession and when a recession will end.
3.	 Persistence: when the economy is growing, it will probably keep growing 
the following quarter. Likewise, when the economy is contracting—when 
growth is negative—the economy will probably keep contracting the fol-
lowing quarter.
Many factors explain fluctuations in economic activity, most notably:
1.	 Technology shocks (the theory of real business cycles): changes in firms’ 
productivity translate into shifts in the demand curve for labor, causing 
fluctuations in employment and real GDP. When the labor demand curve 
shifts to the left, employment and real GDP fall. When the labor demand 
curve shifts to the right, employment and real GDP rise.
2.	 Keynesian factors:
• Changes in sentiments, including changes in expectations, uncertainty, 
and animal spirits, influence firm and household behavior. If a firm 
becomes pessimistic, the demand curve for labor shifts to the left. If 
a firm’s customers become pessimistic, they reduce their purchases, 
decreasing demand for the firm’s products and shifting the firm’s labor 
demand curve to the left.
• An initial shift in the labor demand curve creates a cascading chain of 
events, multiplying or amplifying the impact of the initial shock. For 
example, when firms lay off workers in response to a shock, the laid-
off workers cut their own consumption, reducing the demand for the 
products of other firms and leading to shifts in the labor demand curves 
of the other firms. Financial factors create additional multiplier effects. 
Defaults, bankruptcies, and declines in asset prices lead banks to scale 
back their lending to firms and households, generating another round of 
adverse shifts in the labor demand curve.
3.	 Monetary and financial factors: a fall in the price level is contractionary 
because firms face downward wage rigidities—that is, they are either 
unable or unwilling to cut wages. Employment declines by more than it 
would have with flexible wages. In addition, monetary contractions cause 
the real interest rate to rise, reducing investment. Finally, financial crises 
reduce the credit available to firms and households. All of these channels 
will shift the labor demand curve to the left, reducing employment and 
real GDP.

Multiplier effects help us understand the sharp recession of 2007–2009. 
Between the late 1990s and 2006, the U.S. housing market experienced a 
bubble. This bubble burst in 2006 and real housing prices fell by approximately 
40 percent. The construction industry, which had been booming until then, began 
a sharp contraction. Falling housing prices, and by implication falling wealth, led 
households to cut their consumption. Firms, seeing the demand for their products 
decline, reduced their labor demand, starting a spiral of layoffs and further 
reductions in household consumption. The collapse in housing prices also led 
to mortgage defaults and foreclosures. The defaults and foreclosures generated 
huge losses for many banks, which either failed or sharply cut lending, further 
worsening the recession.
Economic booms tend to increase employment and reduce unemployment 
as the labor demand curve of the economy shifts to the right and the multiplier 
effects increase employment further. However, economic booms also have a 
dark side because when they reverse, the economy can sink into a recession. 
For this reason, some policymakers try to control and dampen economic booms, 
though other factors might push policymakers and politicians to fan the flames of 
economic booms rather than follow a prudent course of action.

	 1.	 Consider the data in Exhibit 26.3.
	
a.	 List the recessions since 1929 by duration, with the 
longest recession first and the shortest last.
	
b.	 List the recessions since 1929 according to decline in 
real GDP from peak to trough, with the greatest de-
cline first and the smallest decline last. Note which 
recessions are first and second on your list from part 
(a) and first and third on your list from part (b). Can 
you think of a reason why the fall in real GDP at the 
end of World War II (1945; second recession on your 
list from part (b)) was so deep even though that reces-
sion was very short?
	 2.	 Go to http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE, 
which shows the U.S. unemployment rate since 1948. Every 
recession during this period is shown by the gray bars on 
the graph.
	
a.	 Does the behavior of the unemployment rate illustrate 
the principle of co-movement discussed in the chap-
ter? Why or why not?
	
b.	 Economic variables are sometimes divided into “lead-
ing indicators” and “lagging indicators.” Leading in-
dicators are variables that start to change before an 
economic expansion or contraction. Lagging indica-
tors change only when an expansion or contraction is 
well underway. Based on the graph of the unemploy-
ment rate, is unemployment a leading or lagging indi-
cator of recessions? Explain.
	 3.	 The OECD developed the composite leading indicators 
(CLI) for select Asian countries. A turning-point in the 
business cycle within nine months is generally indicated 
in the CLI. The components of CLI vary among countries. 
Take Singapore as an example. Some of Singapore’s CLI 
components include industrial production index, retail 
sales, and construction contracts awarded. How will these 
variables affect the real GDP? The issue of the Asian Busi-
ness Cycle Indicators, Vol.12, August–September, 2013 
can be found on the OECD’s web site. Referring to the 
issue, what does the latest CLI say about the economic 
growth of Singapore in the second half of 2013?
	 4.	 Suppose that the mythical country Moricana has a down-
ward rigid wage. Moricana is in a recession; capacity uti-
lization in the economy is at an all-time low, and surveys 
show that firms do not expect economic conditions to im-
prove in the coming year.
	
a.	 Firms in the country are cutting back on capital 
spending and investment. Use a graph to show how 
this would affect the labor demand curve (ignore the 
effects of multipliers).
	
b.	 How would the economy move along the aggregate 
production function curve?
	
c.	 Is unemployment in Moricana likely to be classified 
as voluntary or involuntary? Explain your answer.
	 5.	 Assuming flexible wages, in which case would the change 
in total employment be greater during a recession:
Scenario 1: Workers do not increase their labor supply 
very much in response to an increase in the wage;
or
Scenario 2: Workers increase their labor supply substan-
tially in response to an increase in the wage. Explain your 
answer fully with a graph.
	 6.	 Assume that labor supply and labor demand are described 
by the following equations:
Labor Supply:    LS = 5 × w.
Labor Demand:    LD = 110 − 0.5 × w.
	
	 where w = wage expressed in dollars per hour, and LS and 
LD are expressed in millions of workers.
	
a.	 Find the equilibrium wage and the equilibrium level 
of employment.
	
b.	 Assume that there is a shock to the economy, such that 
the labor demand curve is now described by the equation:
LD = 55 − 0.5 × w.
	
	 If wages are flexible, what will be the new equilibrium 
wage and level of employment? Show your work.
	
c.	 Now assume that wages are rigid at the level you 
found in part (a). What will employment be at this 
wage? How many workers will be unemployed?
	 7.	 In 1973, the major oil-producing nations of the world 
­declared an oil embargo. The price of oil, a key source of 
energy, increased. In many countries, this led to a fall in 
real GDP and employment. Which of the three business 
cycle theories explained in the chapter—real ­business 
cycle theory, Keynesian theory, and monetary theory—
would best fit this explanation of the 1973 recession?
	 8.	 The Internet boom of the 1990s has changed all of our 
lives and transformed the way business is conducted. 
During the late 1990s, the economy was described as the 
“best of all possible worlds” with quite high employment 
(and low unemployment). Explain this phenomenon us-
ing the real business cycle approach.

Explain how this could relate to Keynes’s animal spirits 
view of economic fluctuations.
	10.	 Suppose that the central bank uses expansionary mon-
etary policy to increase employment. However, employ-
ment only increases in the short run, and returns to its 
initial level in the long run. Use a graph to explain this 
result. Assume that the wage is flexible.
	11.	 After the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008, foreign de-
mand for Thai goods sharply shrank. Thailand was expe-
riencing political turmoil during this period that affected 
tourism (service exports), domestic consumption, and the 
manufacturing sectors (domestic investment). In the first 
half of 2009, the Thai economy contracted. In the second 
half of the year, the economy showed signs of recovery 
following the expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. 
The GDP for the whole year was still lower than that in 
2008.
	
a.	 Use a labor market graph to explain how Thailand was 
affected by the subprime mortgage crisis in the first 
half of 2009 and the second half of the year.
	
b.	 Based on your answer to part (a), explain how the 
Thai economy, which has flexible labor market, could 
fully recover to the level of real GDP in 2008 without 
any further government intervention. Assume price ri-
gidity and no shift in labor supply curve.
	12.	 The Evidence-Based Economics feature in the chapter 
identifies three key factors that caused the recession of 
2007–2009.
	
a.	 How would Keynes’s concept of animal spirits  
­explain the creation of a housing bubble?
	
b.	 What does the national income identity show? 
­Explain how the recession of 2007–2009 affected 
the ­consumption and investment components of the 
­national income identity.
	13.	 Some economists stress the role of monetary policy in 
the period leading up to the recession of 2007–2009. 
­Between 2001 and 2003, the Federal Reserve lowered 
the target Fed Funds rate from 6.5 percent to 1 percent 
and kept it there through much of 2004. This resulted in 
a substantial decline in real interest rates throughout the 
economy, including mortgage rates.
	
	 Based on the chapter’s discussion of monetary and finan-
cial factors, explain how the Federal Reserve’s policies 
could have contributed to the economic “bubble” of the 
pre-recession years of 2000–2006.

KEY IDEAS
Countercyclical policies attempt to reduce the intensity of economic 
fluctuations and smooth the growth rates of employment, GDP, and prices.
Countercyclical monetary policy reduces economic fluctuations by 
manipulating bank reserves and interest rates.
Expansionary monetary policy increases bank reserves and decreases 
interest rates. Contractionary monetary policy decreases bank reserves and 
increases interest rates.
Countercyclical fiscal policy reduces fluctuations by manipulating 
government expenditures and taxes.
Expansionary fiscal policy increases government expenditure and 
decreases taxes. Contractionary fiscal policy decreases government 
expenditure and increases taxes.
Countercyclical policies attempt 
to reduce the intensity of economic 
fluctuations and smooth the growth 
rates of employment, GDP, and prices.
Countercyclical monetary policy, 
which is conducted by the central 
bank (in the United States, the 
Fed), attempts to reduce economic 
fluctuations by manipulating bank 
reserves and interest rates.
Countercyclical fiscal policy, which 
is passed by the legislative branch 
and signed into law by the executive 
branch, aims to reduce economic 
fluctuations by manipulating 
government expenditures and taxes.
Countercyclical monetary and fiscal 
policies both work by shifting the 
­labor demand curve.
In Chapter 26, we discussed the reasons why economic growth fluctuates. In this chapter, 
we focus on the government and the Fed’s efforts to reduce those fluctuations by using 
what are called countercyclical policies. Countercyclical policies attempt to reduce the 
intensity of economic fluctuations and smooth the growth rates of employment, GDP, and 
prices. (In this chapter, whenever we discuss GDP, we are referring to real GDP.)
During a recession, expansionary policy aims to reduce the severity of the downturn by 
shifting labor demand to the right and “expanding” economic activity (GDP). Similarly, 
contractionary policy is sometimes used to slow down the economy when it grows too fast 
or “overheats.”
Countercyclical policies come in two main categories:
	
1.	 Countercyclical monetary policy, which is conducted by the central bank (in the 
United States, the Fed), attempts to reduce economic fluctuations by manipulating 
bank reserves and interest rates.
	
2.	 Countercyclical fiscal policy, which is passed by the legislative branch and signed 
into law by the executive branch, aims to reduce economic fluctuations by manipu-
lating government expenditures and taxes.
Though countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies work in different ways and are ­effective 
in different circumstances, they also share some common features. Countercyclical monetary 
and fiscal policies both work by shifting the labor demand curve. During a recession, monetary 
and fiscal policies are used to stimulate the economy by shifting the 
labor demand curve to the right. During a runaway boom, monetary 
and fiscal policies are used to slow the economy by shifting the labor 
demand curve to the left.
We plot the case of a recession in panel (a) of Exhibit 27.1 
where we first study a labor market with flexible wages. Starting 
from a pre-recession equilibrium (point 1: Pre-recession), a shock 
shifts the labor demand curve to the left, reducing employment

Exhibit 27.1 The Effect of 
Countercyclical Policy on the 
Labor Market Panel
(a) Flexible Wage Case
During a recession, the labor 
­demand curve has shifted to 
the left and the equilibrium is 
at the point labeled 2: Trough. 
­Countercyclical policy can partially 
reverse this situation by shifting 
the labor demand curve back to 
the right. With flexible wages, 
the equilibrium transitions from 
2: Trough to 3: Partial recovery. 
The rightward shift in the labor 
demand curve translates into an 
increase in wages and an increase 
in ­employment (represented by 
the green arrow).
(b) Rigid Wage Case
During a recession, the labor 
­demand curve has shifted to 
the left and the equilibrium is 
at the point labeled 2: Trough. 
­Countercyclical policy can ­partially 
reverse this low-employment 
equilibrium by pursuing an 
­expansionary policy that will shift 
the labor demand curve back to 
the right. With ­downward rigid 
wages, the equilibrium ­transitions 
from 2: Trough to 3: Partial 
­recovery. Compare the gains in 
­employment (in green) in the “flex-
ible wage” and “rigid wage” panels 
of ­Exhibit 27.1. With ­downward 
rigid wages the gains in employ-
ment are greater, since downward 
wage rigidity ­implies that the 
­rightward shift in the ­labor demand 
curve translates one-­for-one into 
­employment gains.
and GDP. This takes us to the point marked 2: Trough, where employment and wages are 
lower. Successful expansionary policy shields the economy from the full impact of the 
recession by shifting the labor demand curve back to the right, taking the economy to the 
point labeled 3: Partial recovery.
As in Chapter 26, when wages are downward rigid, the recession has more severe em-
ployment consequences. In panel (b) of Exhibit 27.1, the labor demand curve at trough is 
exactly the same as it was in panel (a). But the drop in employment—from 1: Pre-recession 
to 2: Trough—is now larger than it was in panel (a). This is because none of the leftward 
shift of the labor demand curve can be absorbed by a fall in wages.
Downward-rigid wages also imply that countercyclical policy is relatively more effective. 
We can see this in panel (b) of Exhibit 27.1, where the same countercyclical shift in the labor 
demand curve increases employment more than it did in panel (a). The full force of the expan-
sionary policy impacts employment, because there is no wage response in this case. This can be 
seen by comparing the lengths of the green arrows shown underneath the horizontal axis, repre-
senting the employment effects of countercyclical policies in the flexible and rigid wage cases.

27.2
Just as expansionary policy reduces the severity of a recession, policymakers some-
times use contractionary policy that reduces economic growth during a boom. Why would 
policymakers ever intentionally adopt a policy that has the effect of reducing GDP growth 
and reducing the level of employment? In many situations, the negative effects on GDP 
and employment are a by-product of another policy goal. For example, when inflation is 
consistently above the Fed’s target, the Fed will raise interest rates to suppress borrowing, 
thereby slowing growth of the money supply and reducing the rate of inflation. The rise in 
interest rates will shift the labor demand curve to the left, causing employment to fall as a 
by-product of the Fed’s efforts to reduce inflation.
In other cases, countercyclical policy may be directly targeting economic expansion. 
Recall from Chapter 26 that factors such as excessively optimistic sentiments about the 
economy can result in an unsustainable economic expansion. Left alone, such expansions 
may eventually lead to a severe downturn because optimistic sentiments can implode sud-
denly and severely (due to multiplier effects). In some cases, contractionary policy attempts 
to reduce the risks of an extreme contraction by trying to cool off the economy before it 
overheats. Such cooling off is achieved by putting gradual leftward pressure on the labor de-
mand curve. Contractionary policy is sometimes referred to as “leaning against the wind.”
Expansionary monetary policy 
increases the quantity of bank 
reserves and lowers interest rates.
Countercyclical Monetary Policy
We now discuss countercyclical policies in detail. We first focus on countercyclical mon-
etary policy, which, as we explained in Chapter 25, is conducted by the Fed.
The Fed responds to economic contractions by adopting expansionary monetary 
­policy, which increases the quantity of bank reserves and lowers interest rates. Let’s begin 
by getting a big-picture view of the impact of such policies.
The Fed influences short-term interest rates, especially the federal funds rate. Recall 
that the federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks use to make loans to one another, 
using reserves on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank.
When the Fed wants to stimulate the economy, it lowers short-term interest rates. This, 
in turn, usually causes long-term interest rates to fall. Recall from Chapter 25 that the long-
term interest rate is related to the long-term average of short-term interest rates.
A fall in long-term interest rates encourages households to buy more durable goods, 
like cars, because a lower interest rate implies a lower cost of a car loan. To satisfy an in-
crease in household demand for durable goods, firms try to hire more workers, shifting the 
labor demand curve to the right. Likewise, a fall in long-term interest rates causes firms to 
engage in more investment in plants and equipment, like building a new factory, because 
a lower interest rate implies a lower cost of a commercial loan that will fund the construc-
tion project. Firms need workers to build and operate these new factories, shifting the labor 
demand curve to the right. In many different ways, expansionary monetary policy shifts 
firms’ labor demand curve to the right and increases the level of employment, as we saw in 
Exhibit 27.1. Exhibit 27.2 provides a bird’s-eye view of this process.

The primary tool of monetary policy 
is the Fed’s control of the federal 
funds rate.
To better understand monetary policy we need to discuss how the Fed lowers short-term 
interest rates and expands access to credit. In essence, we need to fill in the details of the 
red box in Exhibit 27.2. The Fed’s most powerful tool in this process is its control of bank 
reserves and the federal funds rate, which we review next.
Controlling the Federal Funds Rate
The primary tool of monetary policy is the Fed’s control of the federal funds rate. By chang-
ing the supply of bank reserves available to private banks, which is called open market op-
erations, the Fed influences the federal funds rate. As explained 
in Chapter 25, in an open market operation, the Fed transacts with 
private banks to increase or reduce bank reserves held at the Fed. 
These transactions influence the federal funds rate.
For instance, by increasing the supply of bank reserves avail-
able to private banks, the Fed decreases the federal funds rate. This 
mechanism is shown in Exhibit 27.3. You can see in this exhibit 
that a shift to the right of the supply of reserves held at the Fed 
drives down the federal funds rate (which is the price that a bank pays to borrow another 
dollar of reserves).
It helps to describe how open market operations work with a concrete example. Suppose 
that the Fed wants to raise bank reserves held on deposit at the Fed by $1 billion. To bring this 
about, the Fed finds a bank—let’s say Citibank—that is willing to sell the Fed $1 billion worth 
of bonds in exchange for $1 billion in bank reserves on deposit at the Fed. The Fed doesn’t use 
paper currency in this transaction. Instead, the Fed creates the $1 billion in bank reserves with 
the stroke of a computer key. Poof! The Fed has issued an IOU to the private bank. The IOU 
takes the form of $1 billion of reserves that the private bank holds on deposit at the Fed.
Following these open market operations, Citibank now has $1 billion more in bank re-
serves on deposit at the Fed and owns $1 billion less in bonds: those are the bonds that 
­Citibank sold the Fed in this transaction. On the assets side of its balance sheet, Citibank 
has an extra $1 billion in bank reserves that it received in exchange for the $1 billion in 
bonds that are now owned by the Fed and appear on the Fed’s balance sheet. Total assets at 
Citibank are unchanged, though the composition of assets has tilted away from bonds and to-
ward bank ­reserves. Exhibit 27.4 illustrates this change on Citibank’s balance sheet, showing 
how ­reserves on the assets side of its balance sheet increase from $100 billion to $101 billion.
The Fed’s balance sheet has also changed. The Fed’s assets now include $1 billion 
more in bonds—this amount represents the bonds that the Fed bought from Citibank. The 
Fed’s liabilities also show a corresponding increase. In particular, the Fed’s liabilities now 
include $1 billion more in the form of reserves—these are the reserves that the Fed elec-
tronically created and then exchanged with Citibank. Exhibit 27.5 illustrates this change on

the Fed’s balance sheet. Note that reserves held at the Fed are an asset to Citibank—which 
can draw on the reserves—and a liability to the Fed—which is on the hook to pay out the 
reserves if asked to do so.
Most of the time, the stock of reserves—including both banks’ vault cash and the 
­reserves that banks hold at the Fed—fluctuates between $40 billion and $80 billion. ­ 
During and after the 2007–2009 recession, however, the Fed drastically expanded the 
quantity of reserves banks held on deposit at the Fed.
Exhibit 27.6 plots this expansion. In August 2008, reserves totaled about $40 billion. You 
have to squint to see them, because they are hovering close to the horizontal axis. This quantity 
of reserves was enough to cover banks’ reserve requirements, with little left to spare. In other

Exhibit 27.6 Total Reserves on 
Deposit at the Federal Reserve 
Bank (Monthly Data from January 
1959 through December 2013)
Here we see total reserves of 
private banks held on deposit at 
the Fed. Before 2008, reserves 
fluctuated between $40 billion 
and $80 billion, which was roughly 
the minimum amount of reserves 
that were required to be held—
10 ­percent of demand deposits at 
large banks. In 2008, in response 
to the financial crisis, the Fed 
drastically increased the amount of 
reserves held at the Fed, causing 
total reserves to rise to $2.5 trillion 
by December 2013. This expansion 
was designed to drive down inter-
est rates, thereby stimulating GDP.

words, the quantity of reserves was roughly equal to the amount of reserves that banks were 
required to hold—for large banks, 10 percent of the demand deposits of their customers.
Over the next 5 years, the quantity of reserves exploded, exceeding $2.5 trillion. This 
vast expansion in reserves did not reflect an increase in required reserves, but rather an ex-
pansion of reserves far, far above the quantity that was required to be held. Reserves above 
and beyond the regulatory minimum are referred to as excess reserves. The Fed expanded 
reserves to push the federal funds rate close to 0 and to also lower long-term real interest 
rates. (Recall how Exhibit 27.3 showed us that a rightward shift in the supply of reserves 
drives down the federal funds rate.) And this reduction in interest rates is exactly what this 
policy achieved. In early 2007, before the 2007–2009 recession, the federal funds rate was 
5.25 percent. By early 2009, it was only 0.1 percent. The federal funds rate has been kept 
near 0 from 2009 up to the present day (this textbook went to press in September 2014). 
Most forecasters expect that the Fed will reverse its policy and start to slowly raise the 
federal funds rate beginning in 2015.
Other Tools of the Fed
The Fed uses many tools to manipulate interest rates and affect the demand for goods, 
services, and labor. Like traditional open market operations, which we just discussed, most 
of these additional tools also work through the Fed’s supply of bank reserves. We list these 
other tools here, many of which will be familiar from Chapter 25.
	
1.	 Changing the reserve requirement. For large private banks, the current level of 
required reserves is 10 percent of their customers’ demand deposits. The Fed can 
decrease the quantity of required reserves, which shifts private banks’ demand 
curve for reserves to the left and decreases the federal funds rate. (Likewise, the 
Fed can increase the quantity of required reserves, which shifts the demand curve 
for reserves to the right and increases the federal funds rate.)
	
2.	 Changing the interest rate paid on reserves deposited at the Fed. The Fed cur-
rently pays an interest rate of 0.25 percent on reserves deposited at the Fed. The Fed 
can change this interest rate. A decrease in the interest rate paid on reserves shifts 
the demand curve for reserves to the left and decreases the federal funds rate. (An 
increase in the interest rate paid on reserves shifts the demand curve for reserves to 
the right and increases the federal funds rate.)

3.	 Lending from the discount window. The Fed can lend bank reserves through its 
discount window. For private banks, the discount window is an alternative to the 
federal funds market as a source of reserves. Lending from the discount window 
occurs most frequently during financial crises, when private banks are afraid to lend 
to one another in the federal funds market because they can’t be sure that they will 
be paid back.
	
4.	 Quantitative easing. The Fed can also change the way that it conducts open market 
operations. Rather than buying short-term Treasury bonds, which is the usual way 
that the Fed increases bank reserves in an open market operation, the Fed can buy 
long-term bonds instead. Purchasing long-term bonds in an open market operation 
pushes up the price on the long-term bonds and thereby drives down long-term in-
terest rates. The interest rate is the (fixed) coupon that the bond pays divided by the 
price of the bond, so a higher bond price implies a lower interest rate. Quantitative 
easing occurs when the central bank creates a large quantity of bank reserves to buy 
long-term bonds, simultaneously increasing the quantity of bank reserves and push-
ing down the interest rate on long-term bonds. Quantitative easing played a key role 
in the huge run-up in bank reserves that occurred from 2008 to 2014.
Central banks occasionally invent even more ways of increasing the supply of credit 
during financial crises by creating specialized lending channels that increase lending in 
the credit market and thus indirectly stimulate the demand for goods, services, and labor.
For example, immediately after the investment bank Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in 
September 2008, an even larger financial firm—the American International Group (AIG)—
also suffered a cataclysmic liquidity crisis. AIG desperately needed cash because it had to 
make billions of dollars of immediate payments to hundreds of other financial firms, in-
cluding many of the largest banks in the United States, Europe, and Asia. AIG was having 
trouble raising funds because investors feared that AIG was about to declare bankruptcy. 
The failure of AIG would have triggered a domino effect that could have crippled the global 
financial system. If AIG declared bankruptcy, any institutions that were owed money by 
AIG would not immediately receive the funds they were counting on, and some of these 
other firms would be unable to meet their own financial commitments, creating ripples that 
might cause hundreds of interconnected financial institutions to fail.
The Fed joined forces with the U.S. Treasury Department to prop up AIG by extending 
AIG loans, credit lines, and other guarantees for a total of nearly $200 billion. AIG eventu-
ally recovered, and the Fed and Treasury got back their money. AIG’s original shareholders 
were almost completely wiped out, but AIG was able to pay off its 
debts to other financial institutions, averting an even worse global 
financial meltdown.
We’ve now discussed the key tools that the Fed uses in its con-
duct of countercyclical monetary policy. However, we haven’t 
completed the picture yet. There are several important factors that 
influence the way the Fed uses these tools. We turn to these issues 
in the next three subsections.
Expectations, Inflation, and Monetary Policy
The effectiveness of monetary policy depends on expectations about interest rates and 
inflation. Recall that the federal funds rate, which the Fed directly controls, is the annual-
ized interest rate on overnight loans between banks. In contrast, the interest rate that is 
relevant for consumers’ and firms’ investment decisions—for instance, the real mortgage 
interest rate—is the long-term expected real interest rate:
Long-term expected real interest rate = Long-term nominal interest rate  
− Long-term expected inflation rate.
For the Fed to lower the long-term real interest rate, it has to either lower the long-
term nominal interest rate or raise long-term expectations of the inflation rate (or both).  
To do this, the Fed can communicate that it will maintain an expansionary monetary 
policy, holding down the federal funds rate and propping up the inflation rate, for a long 
period of time.
The effectiveness of monetary policy 
depends on expectations about 
­interest rates and inflation.

Chapter 27  |  Countercyclical Macroeconomic Policy
If households and firms believe that the federal funds rate will remain low for several years, 
then the long-term nominal interest rate will also be low. Intuitively, you can think of the  
10-year nominal interest rate as being close to the market’s expectations of the average interest 
rate for overnight loans over the next 10 years. If the Fed promises to keep the federal funds 
rate low for the next decade, then the 10-year (long-term) nominal interest rate will also be low.
A similar analysis applies to long-term expectations of inflation. To many people, 
­inflation is a four-letter word. But as we already mentioned in Chapter 25, the impact of 
inflationary expectations on the long-term expected real interest rate also implies that the 
Fed might wish to create expectations of ­inflation—if it can. In particular, it might prom-
ise to conduct expansionary monetary policy for several years. If the market believes this 
promise, then inflationary expectations will rise, which will lower the long-term expected 
real interest rate if the nominal interest rate doesn’t rise one-for-one with inflation.
Contractionary Monetary Policy: Control of Inflation
Recall from Chapter 25 that stabilizing inflation is one of the Fed’s two mandates. The Fed 
would like the inflation rate to hover around 2 percent per year, neither deviating far above 
or far below this target.
Expansionary monetary policy can put this inflation target at risk. In normal circumstances, 
increasing the quantity of bank reserves enables banks to make more loans. Those loans circu-
late through the economy and return to the banking system as deposits. Rising bank deposits 
increase the amount of money in the economy, since the stock of money includes customers’ 
bank deposits. The quantity theory of money, which we studied in ­Chapter 25, implies that 
over the long run, the inflation rate will equal the growth rate of M2 minus the growth rate of 
real GDP. Excessively rapid growth in M2 therefore creates a risk of high levels of inflation. 
We summarize these linkages in Exhibit 27.7. Countercyclical policy is useful for controlling 
inflation. In particular, when inflation threatens to rise substantially and persistently above the 
Fed’s target of 2 ­percent, the Fed uses contractionary monetary policy, which slows down 
growth in bank reserves, raises interest rates, reduces borrowing, slows down growth in the 
money supply, and reduces the rate of inflation.
Contractionary monetary policy is like expansionary monetary policy, but now the Fed 
runs everything in reverse. The Fed will shrink bank reserves—or slow their growth—to 
The Fed’s desire to influence long-term expectations 
is apparent in its monthly policy statements. In the fall 
of 2010, the economy was slowly recovering from the 
2007–2009 recession and consequently the Fed wanted 
to maintain a low long-term expected real interest rate. 
In its September 2010 policy announcement, the Federal 
Open Market Committee—the committee that conducts 
the Fed’s open market operations—wrote that the federal 
funds rate would be held between 0 and 0.25 percent for 
“an extended period.”
In its December 2012 announcement, the Fed an-
nounced an even clearer policy rule, by linking changes 
in the federal funds rate to future changes in the unem-
ployment rate and the inflation rate:
“The committee decided to keep the target range for 
the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and cur-
rently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for 
the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as 
long as
• the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent,
• inflation between one and two years ahead is pro-
jected to be no more than a half percentage point 
above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal,
• and longer-term inflation expectations continue to 
be well anchored.”
(Federal Open Market Committee, 12/2012)
In this statement, the Fed announced a specific policy 
rule, which increased the public’s ability to forecast ­future in-
terest rates. In essence, the Fed announced that it planned 
to keep the federal funds rate close to 0 percent as long 
as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent 
and inflation remained close to the Fed’s 2 ­percent target. 
At the time that this announcement was made, the unem-
ployment rate was 7.7 percent and forecasters anticipated 
that it would take years for the unemployment rate to fall 
to the 6.5 percent threshold that the Fed set for itself. As 
this book goes to press (September, 2014), the unemploy-
ment rate has fallen below the 6.5 threshold, and the Fed 
is now actively talking about raising the federal funds rate 
during the next year.
LETTING THE DATA SPEAK
Managing Expectations
Contractionary monetary policy 
slows down growth in bank reserves, 
raises interest rates, reduces 
borrowing, slows down growth in 
the money supply, and reduces the 
rate of inflation.
William McChesney Martin, Jr.,  
a teetotaler in his personal life, 
was the chairman of the Fed 
from 1951 to 1970. He de-
scribed the Fed’s role this way: 
“I’m the fellow who takes away 
the punch bowl just when the 
party is getting good.”

raise the federal funds rate. It might also attempt to change ex-
pectations about future monetary policy, leading households and 
businesses to anticipate more contractionary policies in the future.
In essence, the Fed can run the engine of monetary policy 
­either forward or backwards. During a recession, the Fed employs 
expansionary monetary policies to partially offset the economic 
contraction. During a boom, particularly one that is inflationary, 
the Fed employs contractionary monetary policy to reduce a ­rising rate of inflation. In both 
cases, of course, the Fed is playing a countercyclical role, leaning against the prevailing 
economic winds.
Though it might sound simple to run the engine of monetary policy backwards, controlling 
inflation is not always easy. Once prices begin rising quickly—for instance, an inflation rate of  
5 percent or more—the public starts to expect a high inflation rate in the future and the 
central bank has a hard time regaining its reputation as an inflation fighter. Such a loss in 
reputation occurred during the 1970s—a decade of high and rising U.S. inflation caused 
in part by expansionary monetary policy. By the end of the 1970s, the Fed’s reputation as 
a careful steward of the monetary system was shattered. In 1979, the U.S. public ­expected 
that inflation would remain at a high level for the foreseeable future. This is when a new Fed 
chairman, Paul ­Volcker, stepped in with a sharply con-
tractionary monetary policy. To cut inflation, he dras-
tically slowed the growth rate of the stock of money, 
which raised the federal funds rate to 20 percent. This 
was the beginning of the 1981 recession that turned 
out to be one of the most severe U.S. recessions since 
World War II. Volcker’s recession generated a peak 
unemployment rate of 10.8 percent, even greater than 
the 10 percent peak during the 2007–2009 recession. 
Volcker believed that the benefits of lowering the rate 
of inflation offset the costs of this deep recession. 
Volcker managed to reclaim the Fed’s credibility for 
fighting inflation, and ever since, the Fed has retained 
its reputation for being serious about controlling the 
level of inflation.
With historical episodes like this in mind, cen-
tral banks work hard to protect their reputation for 
keeping inflation at a low level—around 2 percent 
per year. Even the slightest hint that inflation is get-
ting out of control might lead a central bank to end a 
policy of monetary expansion.
Exhibit 27.7 The Path from Reserves  
to Inflation
Increasing the quantity of bank reserves 
deposited at the Fed usually leads banks 
to make more loans. Those loans circulate 
through the economy and return to the 
banking system as deposits. Rising bank 
deposits enable banks to make even more 
loans. The resulting total increase in deposits 
­generates an increase in the stock of money 
(for ­instance, M2). If the stock of money 
grows faster than real GDP, the aggregate 
price level will rise, generating inflation. This 
only poses a problem when inflation persis-
tently rises above the Fed’s 2 percent target.

Paul Volcker sharply reduced the growth rate of the money stock in 
the early 1980s to reclaim the Fed’s reputation as an inflation fighter. 
His actions raised interest rates and started a major recession. ­Despite 
­national protests against his policies, he stayed the course, and 
he is now viewed as one of the greatest Fed chairmen. This is one 
­central banker you shouldn’t mess with. (He also had the odd quirk of 
­testifying before the Senate while puffing on cigars.1)

Zero Lower Bound
Japan has experienced four recessions and a very low level of overall growth in real GDP 
since the early 1990s. Many observers refer to the 1990s and 2000s as “lost decades” for 
the Japanese economy. In response to these economic conditions, Japan’s central bank has 
responded by increasing the supply of bank reserves, thereby lowering Japan’s version of 
the federal funds rate—the interest rate for interbank loans—nearly to zero. ­Exhibit 27.8 
plots this interbank ­interest rate.
When an interest rate hits zero, economists say that it has “hit the zero lower bound.” 
This language implies that zero is a barrier—or a boundary line—that nominal interest 
rates can’t cross.
To understand the zero lower bound, it is helpful to explain how bizarre a negative 
nominal interest rate would be if it arose. A negative interest rate would imply that a 
borrower would eventually repay less money than he borrowed. For example, suppose 
that you go to the bank to borrow $100 ­million for one year at a negative interest rate of 
1 percent. Assuming that you can store this money—for example, under a very big mat-
tress or in a safe deposit box—then borrowing at a −1 ­percent interest rate would present 
a great profit opportunity for you. You borrow $100 million. You store it for a year and 
then repay your loan by giving the bank $99 million back and pocketing the remaining 
$1 million!
Of course, lending money at a negative interest rate is a bad deal for banks; they would 
rather keep the money in their own vaults than lend it to you. At least then they would 
have $100 million at the end of the year rather than just the $99 million they would get 
from you.
On occasion, policymakers fail to recognize what is hap-
pening in the economy. Sometimes they mistakenly 
adopt policies that increase the magnitude of economic 
fluctuations instead of policies that smooth things out.
Some economists believe that the severity of the 2007–
2009 financial crisis and recession was in part caused 
by unduly expansionary monetary policy from 2002 to 
2005. During this period, the Fed, under Chairman Alan 
Greenspan, lowered the federal funds rate to 1 percent, 
even though the economy was growing and the hous-
ing market was gripped by what we now realize was an 
unsustainable speculative bubble. Alan Greenspan’s un-
willingness to increase the federal funds rate was in part 
caused by his belief at the time that unsustainable specu-
lative bubbles are extremely rare. After the collapse in 
housing prices, Greenspan publicly revised his views on 
the frequency of asset bubbles.
Asset bubbles—like the home price bubble that peaked 
in 2006—do occur from time to time and are often fol-
lowed by recessions. In other words, asset bubbles in-
crease, or amplify, economic fluctuations. The Fed’s 
expansionary policies of 2002–2005 greased the wheels 
of the housing bubble and therefore played a partial role 
in causing the recession that followed. Sometimes central 
banks administer the wrong monetary medicine.
Central banks have studied this policy failure and 
many are now attempting to identify asset bubbles as

These arguments explain why banks generally won’t lend money at an interest rate that 
is below zero. Banks will hold onto their money rather than make loans at negative interest 
rates. It therefore follows that central banks can’t push nominal interest rates below zero. 
And that is the zero lower bound.
The zero lower bound is a problem for monetary policy when the rate of inflation is low or 
negative, which has also been the case in Japan since the early 1990s. Remember that house-
holds and firms make investment decisions based on the expected real interest rate. When the 
nominal interest rate is stuck at or just above 0 and the inflation rate is negative (also called 
deflation), the real interest rate will be positive. For example, a nominal interest rate of 0 and 
an expected inflation rate of −1 percent jointly imply an expected real interest rate of
Nominal interest rate − Expected inflation rate = 0% − (−1%) = 1%.
If the inflation rate keeps falling (further below zero), the real interest rate will rise, squelch-
ing investment and shifting the labor demand curve to the left.
When the economy is in recession or growing only slowly, the central bank usually 
wants to lower the real interest rate to stimulate economic growth. But what does it do 
when nominal interest rates can’t be lowered any further because they are already at the 
zero lower bound? As we discussed earlier, the central bank tries to influence expectations 
of future nominal interest rates and future inflation. By promising to keep nominal interest 
rates low for many years and promising to keep inflation at 2 percent in the long run, the 
central bank attempts to influence the long-term expected real rate of interest, even if the 
current federal funds rate is at zero and can’t be lowered any further.
Policy Trade-offs
We hope you have concluded that the job of a central banker is not easy. Monetary policy-
makers face many conflicting considerations. For example, the Fed would like to stimulate 
the economy during a recession, but the Fed does not want to risk runaway inflation. How 
should the Fed make this trade-off?
Many central banks set the federal funds rate in a way that is approximately described by 
this formula, also called a Taylor rule after economist John Taylor who first suggested it3:
Federal funds rate = Long-run federal funds rate target + 1.5(Inflation rate  
− Inflation rate target) + 0.5(Output gap in percentage points).
This equation relates the federal funds rate to its long-run target (about 3.5 percent), the 
inflation rate, the inflation target (2 percent), and the output gap in percentage points. The 
output gap, which was first discussed in Chapter 19, is the difference between GDP and 
trend GDP divided by trend GDP:
 Output gap 5 GDP 2 Trend GDP
Trend GDP

An output gap of −0.05 is expressed in percentage points as −5 percent—in other 
words, the economy is 5 percent below trend. Recall from Chapter 19 that trend GDP 
is a smoothed version of actual GDP. You often will see the output gap expressed with 
trend GDP ­replaced by potential GDP, which represents the level of GDP that would be 
attained if the labor force and the capital stock were fully employed in production.
It is useful to spell out the two parts of the Taylor rule:
	
1.	 It says that the Fed raises the federal funds rate as the inflation rate rises. A greater 
inflation rate leads the Fed to raise the federal funds rate, thereby reducing the de-
gree of stimulus. Specifically, the formula says that every percentage point increase 
in the inflation rate (for a given inflation target) will translate into a 1.5 percentage 
point increase in the federal funds rate.
	
2.	 The Taylor rule also says that the Fed sets a higher federal funds rate the higher the 
output gap. A larger output gap—in other words, a stronger economy—leads the 
Fed to raise the federal funds rate, thereby reducing the degree of stimulus. The 
formula says that every percentage point increase in the output gap will translate 
into a half percentage point increase in the federal funds rate.
To see the Taylor rule in action, consider the state of affairs in early 2014. Inflation was 
running at about 1.5 percent, and the economy was about 5 percent below its trend GDP level. 
Plugging these numbers into the Taylor rule (and assuming a 3.5% long-run federal funds 
rate target and 2% inflation rate target), the recommended level of the federal funds rate was:
Federal funds rate = 3.5% + 1.5(1.5% − 2%) + 0.5(−5%) = 0.25%.
Hence, the Taylor rule predicted a federal funds rate of only 0.25 percent, far below its long-
run target of 3.5 percent. In fact, the actual federal funds rate in early 2014 was 0.1 percent,  
not far from the level predicted by the Taylor rule.
The Taylor “rule” is really just a rule of thumb. Monetary policy is as much an art as a 
science—policymakers need to use their intuition and wisdom, not just a simple formula. 
However, the Taylor rule is a good starting point for their deliberations and a rough-and-
ready summary of the trade-offs that central banks have made in the past.
Expansionary fiscal policy uses 
higher government expenditure and 
lower taxes to increase the growth 
rate of real GDP.
Contractionary fiscal policy uses 
lower government expenditure and 
higher taxes to reduce the growth 
rate of real GDP.
Countercyclical monetary policy, which is conducted by the central bank and aims to reduce 
economic fluctuations by manipulating interest rates, has been our focus so far. Countercycli-
cal fiscal policy is the other major category of countercyclical policy. Countercyclical fiscal 
policy, which is passed by the legislative branch and signed into law by the executive branch, 
reduces economic fluctuations by manipulating government expenditures and taxes.
Expansionary fiscal policy uses higher government expenditure and lower taxes to in-
crease the growth rate of real GDP. Like expansionary monetary policy, expansionary fiscal 
policy shifts the labor demand curve to the right, as Exhibit 27.1 showed. Contractionary 
fiscal policy uses lower government expenditure and higher taxes to reduce the growth rate 
of real GDP. Just like contractionary monetary policy, contractionary fiscal policy shifts the 
labor demand curve to the left.
We now discuss the reasons that macroeconomists view fiscal policy as a useful tool  
for offsetting macroeconomic fluctuations. We’ll also explain some of its limitations.
Fiscal Policy Over the Business Cycle:  
Automatic and Discretionary Components
Fiscal policy can be divided into automatic and discretionary components.
	
1.	 Automatic countercyclical components are aspects of fiscal policy that automati-
cally partially offset economic fluctuations. These automatic countercyclical 
components do not require deliberate action on the part of the government. For 
example, tax collection falls automatically during a recession because unemployed 
workers don’t owe income tax. Moreover, during a recession, government expendi-
ture automatically increases, because government transfer payments rise, including

unemployment insurance and food stamps (otherwise known as the Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP). The less households earn, the more gov-
ernment transfers they receive.
These automatic countercyclical fiscal mechanisms are often referred to as 
­automatic stabilizers because they stimulate the economy during economic con-
tractions. Such transfers help households cope with economic hardship and are 
widely believed to stimulate GDP by enabling millions of households to spend 
more during recessions.
	
2.	 Discretionary countercyclical components are those aspects of the government’s fiscal 
policy that policymakers deliberately enact in response to economic fluctuations. In 
most cases, these new policies introduce a package of specific expenditure increases or 
temporary tax cuts to reduce economic hardship and stimulate GDP. For example, dur-
ing the recession of 2007–2009 the U.S. Congress passed the Economic Stimulus Act of 
2008—signed by President George W. Bush in ­February 2008—and the American Re-
covery and Reinvestment Act of 2009—signed by President Barack Obama in ­February 
2009. The first package contained $152 billion in tax cuts, which were received by 
households in the spring of 2008. The second package cost $787 billion, with a third 
of the funding supporting new tax cuts and two-thirds of the funding supporting new 
government expenditure. The new spending was spread out over several years.
We illustrate the behavior of fiscal policy (combining both the automatic and discre-
tionary components) during the 2007–2009 recession in Exhibit 27.9. The rising budget 
­deficit—government revenue minus government expenditure—provides a summary mea-
sure of fiscal policy, because the deficit reflects rising expenditures and falling tax collec-
tion. In the fourth quarter of 2007, which was the start of the recession, the budget deficit 
was $416 billion (all numbers are in constant 2009 dollars). By the end of the recession in 
the second quarter of 2009, the budget deficit had risen to $1,603 billion. Persistent weak-
ness in the labor market coupled with lags in spending from the 2009 American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act caused the deficit to remain high following the end of the recession.
Such deficits have consequences. When the government ­borrows money to pay its 
bills, future taxpayers are implicitly responsible for paying back the government’s debts. 
Automatic stabilizers are 
components of the government 
budget that automatically adjust to 
smooth out economic fluctuations.

Chapter 27  |  Countercyclical Macroeconomic Policy
The basic idea behind fiscal policy is 
that higher government ­expenditure 
and lower taxation play a useful 
role in recessions by increasing 
spending by households, firms, and 
governments.
Ultimately, the government will have to pay what it owes. Roughly 
speaking, the 2007–2009 recession generated $2 trillion of 
­automatic fiscal adjustments and $1 trillion of ­discretionary fiscal 
adjustments, implying that ­future taxpayers will be on the hook 
for approximately $3 trillion of new government debt. But all of 
this debt was accumulated for a reason—to conduct countercycli-
cal fiscal policy. The basic idea behind fiscal policy is that higher 
government expenditure and lower taxation play a useful role 
in recessions by increasing spending by households, firms, and 
governments. This increased spending ­translates into demand for 
firms’ products, which in turn increases demand for labor, shifting 
labor demand to the right. To the extent that some of this money goes to state and local gov-
ernments, it enables them to avoid laying off state and local employees.
The remainder of the chapter explains why more government expenditure and lower 
taxation increases GDP. We first look at expenditure-based fiscal policy and then at taxa-
tion-based fiscal policy.
Analysis of Expenditure-Based Fiscal Policy
Let’s begin with the national income accounting identity.
Y = C + I + G + X − M.
Here, Y is GDP, C is consumption, I is investment, G is government expenditure, X is ex-
ports, M is imports, and thus X − M is net exports. To start the analysis of fiscal policy, 
assume (for the moment) that changing government expenditure does not change any of 
the other terms on the right-hand side of the equation. Then a $1 increase in government 
expenditure would cause a $1 increase in GDP, Y:
[Y + 1] = C + I + [G + 1] + X − M.
If we take the change in GDP (Y) and divide it by the change in government expenditure 
(G), we have what is known as the government expenditure multiplier. If government expen-
diture rises by $1 and causes GDP to rise by $m, then the government expenditure multiplier 
is $m/$1 = m. For example, if m = 1, then a $1 increase in government expenditure generates 
a $1 increase in GDP (which is the case in the previous equation). In terms of our analysis of 
Exhibit 27.1, if m = 1, then increased government expenditure of $1 raises the demand for 
firms’ goods and services and shifts the labor demand curve to the right, increasing GDP by $1.
Let’s now revisit the assumption that nothing else on the right-hand side changes. 
­Additional government expenditure might lead to higher levels of household consump-
tion. For example, the government’s extra expenditure might encourage additional business 
activity, which would raise employment and take-home pay and thereby increase house-
hold consumption. In this scenario, increased government expenditure levels are creating a 
multiplier effect of the sort we discussed in Chapter 26. The multiplier effect shifts firms’ 
labor demand curves further to the right and translates into a larger impact of government 
expenditure on employment and GDP.
We can illustrate this multiplier effect with the national income accounting identity. 
Assume that the multiplier effect raises household consumption by $1 (in addition to the 
original $1 increase in government expenditure). In particular:
[Y + 2] = [C + 1] + I + [G + 1] + X − M.
In this scenario Y rises by $2—remember that the left- and right-hand sides of this equation 
must be equal. In this case, the government expenditure multiplier would be $2/$1 = 2. 
This means that GDP rises by $2 for every $1 increase in government expenditure.
Advocates of expenditure-based fiscal policy tend to believe that the government expen-
diture multiplier lies between 1 and 2.
Crowding Out  In addition to its useful role of combatting recessions as part of 
countercyclical fiscal policy, there is also a negative side to government expenditure. 
Rising government expenditures leads to more government borrowing, and such borrowing 
can soak up resources that would otherwise have been used by households and firms. Some 
If a $1 change in government 
expenditure causes an $m change 
in GDP, then the government 
expenditure multiplier is m.

economists believe that rising government expenditure “crowds out” private economic 
activity like consumption and investment. Crowding out occurs when rising government 
expenditure partially or even fully displaces expenditures by households and firms. In 
Exhibit 27.1, crowding out results in a smaller effect of countercyclical policy—in other 
words, crowding out implies that the labor demand curve shifts to the right less than it 
otherwise would.
For example, suppose that an extra $1 of government expenditure forces the government 
to borrow an extra $1 to pay its bills, leading $1 of private savings to switch from funding 
private investment to purchasing government debt. The switch occurs because the gov-
ernment is willing to pay whatever interest rate it takes to borrow funds, whereas private 
businesses tend to be more responsive to interest rate changes. As the government borrows 
to pay its bills, the interest rate in the credit market rises, causing a reallocation of savings 
from private borrowers—like households and firms—to the government. If private invest-
ment becomes too expensive for consumers and firms, it might fall by $1 when the govern-
ment increases its spending by $1. In effect, the private investment is “crowded out” by the 
government borrowing. In this scenario, countercyclical government expenditure will not 
shift the firms’ labor demand curve to the right because the expansionary effect of the ad-
ditional government expenditure is offset by the contractionary effect of the fall in private 
investment. Consequently, GDP does not increase, because the $1 increase in government 
expenditure crowds out $1 of private investment:
Y = C + [I − 1] + [G + 1] + X − M.
In this case, the government expenditure multiplier is [−$1 + $1]/$1 = 0. Critics of fiscal 
policy emphasize the importance of crowding out and believe that the government expen-
diture multiplier is well below 1 and might even be close to 0.
At this point you are probably wondering which scenario is “right.” Unfortunately, we 
are not completely sure. Economists hold a wide range of positions on this question, and 
everyone in this debate has some data that partially support his or her position. Taking into 
account both multipliers and crowding out, the government expenditure multiplier prob-
ably lies between 0 and 1.5, depending on the state of the economy.
If the economy is already running at full steam, it is likely that additional government 
expenditure will substantially crowd out other kinds of economic activity. For example, if 
all factories are already operating at full capacity, there may be little the government can do 
in the short run to increase GDP. Consequently, many economists believe that the govern-
ment expenditure multiplier is close to zero when the economy is already booming. But 
that’s not particularly relevant to the fiscal policy debate because economists don’t recom-
mend expansionary fiscal policy when the economy is already growing rapidly.
The interesting question is what we should expect the government expenditure multi-
plier to be when the economy is contracting. For example, envision an economy suffering 
from an extreme contraction, and further assume that monetary policy has been rendered 
less effective because interest rates have already been lowered to zero and can’t be lowered 
any further—the scenario in which monetary policy has hit the zero lower bound.
This was the situation of the U.S. economy in the aftermath of the 2007–2009 recession. 
In a situation like this there will be substantial slack in productive resources, like factories 
running below capacity and significant numbers of unemployed workers. Accordingly, ad-
ditional government expenditure might only weakly crowd out private consumption and 
investment. Additional government expenditures can then encourage the utilization of some 
of the idle capacity and unemployed workers. For instance, President Barack Obama’s ad-
ministration assumed a government-expenditure multiplier of 1.57 when developing the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.4 This number was close to, though 
slightly above, the estimates of other forecasters at that time.
Most economists endorse some additional government expenditures during a deep reces-
sion, but there is substantial debate on this issue. Critics of expansionary government expen-
diture believe that crowding out is strong even during recessions. Accordingly, the appropriate 
scale of countercyclical government expenditure remains an open policy question.
We’ll now show you how to use the government expenditure multiplier to predict the 
impact of expenditure-based countercyclical policy. We’ll assume that the economy is in 
a deep recession and that the multiplier is 1.5, approximately the top of its range. The 
­American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 contained about $500 billion of new 
Crowding out occurs when rising 
government expenditure partially or 
even fully displaces expenditures by 
households and firms.

spending, but this new spending was spread out over many years. Only $120 billion oc-
curred in 2009, implying an impact of
1.5 × $120 billion = $180 billion.
Since GDP was approximately $14 trillion in 2009, a $180 billion increase in GDP 
amounted to an increase of about
  $180 billion
$14 trillion
5 1.3%.
That might not seem like much, but 1.3 percentage points of extra growth does make a 
difference when talking about the growth rate of the entire U.S. economy. For example, 
in 2009 real GDP fell by 2.8 percent. A multiplier of 1.5 implies that the economy would 
have fallen by 4.1 percent without the impact of the new government expenditures in the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
Analysis of Taxation-Based Fiscal Policy
So far, we’ve been discussing the use of government expenditure to partially offset an eco-
nomic contraction. Expansionary fiscal policy can also be implemented by cutting taxes. 
Let’s therefore switch gears and assume that the government gives households a $1 tax 
cut. To illustrate ideas, let’s start with the extreme assumption that consumers spend every 
penny of the tax cut, raising consumption (C) by $1, but nothing else changes on the right-
hand side of the national income accounting identity. Then GDP would rise by $1 and the 
government taxation multiplier would be $1/$1 = 1:
[Y + 1] = [C + 1] + I + G + X − M.
But a $1 tax cut need not increase GDP by $1. If it increases it by $m, the government taxa-
tion multiplier would be $m/$1 = m.
For instance, there are many reasons why a $1 tax cut might have an impact that is even 
greater than $1. The rise in consumption might have multiplier effects, causing a domino 
­effect of rising consumption, rising firm revenues, rising firm hiring, rising household in-
come, and yet more consumption. In addition, a cut in the income tax might lead workers 
to supply more labor because their after-tax wages will have risen (though this effect is 
estimated to be small in magnitude). In Exhibit 27.1, this would shift the labor supply curve 
to the right. With these kinds of mechanisms in mind, suppose that a $1 decrease in taxation 
leads to a $2 increase in households’ incomes and a $2 increase in consumption. Suppose 
that nothing else changes on the right-hand side of the accounting identity. In this case,  
GDP (Y) would rise by $2, so the government taxation multiplier would be $2/$1 = 2.
[Y + 2] = [C + 2] + I + G + X − M.
On the other hand, tax cuts might generate crowding out of the sort that we described before. 
As consumers try to spend more, resources that would have previously gone to investment might 
now be redirected to consumption. For instance, a car company might shift from manufacturing 
rental cars (an investment for Hertz and Avis) toward manufacturing cars that households buy:
[Y + 1] = [C + 2] + [I − 1] + G + X − M.
Likewise, as consumers try to spend more, the extra goods might be provided by an increase 
in imports, lowering net exports. If imports rise by $1, then net exports will fall by $1, so the 
national income accounting identity becomes:
[Y + 1] = [C + 2] + I + G + X − [M + 1].
If crowding-out effects are large, the government taxation multiplier will be significantly 
reduced. In the last two examples that we have discussed, the government taxation multi-
plier would be [$2 − $1]/$1 = 1.
Critics of using tax policy to manage short-run economic contractions point out that 
optimizing consumers might not actually spend much of their tax cut right away. In other 
words, critics worry that consumption might not rise very much as a result of a tax cut. 
Why might households hold back on spending their tax cuts? There are at least two reasons.
	
1.	 If consumption offers diminishing returns—a fifth slice of pizza might not taste 
as good as the fourth slice—consumers might try to smooth their consumption by 
If a $1 reduction in taxation causes 
an $m increase in GDP, then the 
government taxation multiplier is m.

spreading the “extra” spending over the long term rather than consuming the pro-
ceeds of a tax cut all at once.
	
2.	 Consumers might recognize that the government will have to raise taxes in the 
­future to pay for the current tax cut. Because of this anticipated future tax hike, they 
may decide that a current tax cut should be saved so that they will be in a position 
to pay these higher taxes in the future.
The tendency to save the tax cut will be particularly pronounced among wealthy consumers 
who don’t have an urgent reason to consume the tax cut right away. In summary, if some 
consumers save some or even all of a tax cut, cutting taxes will have only a small effect on 
consumption, and the government taxation multiplier will be small.
Economists believe that the government taxation multiplier is between 0 and 2. The ad-
ministration of President Barack Obama assumed a government-taxation multiplier of 0.99 
when developing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.5 The act created 
total tax cuts of about $300 billion, but only $65 billion of those cuts took effect in 2009. 
Assuming a government-taxation multiplier of 1, these tax cuts raised 2009 GDP by about 
$65 billion, representing about 0.5 percent of GDP in 2009.
We can therefore calculate the total impact of the American Recovery and Reinvest-
ment Act of 2009, if the government’s estimates of multipliers were correct. Expenditures 
raised GDP by 1.3 percent (see calculations above) and tax cuts raised GDP by 0.5 percent. 
Hence, the act raised 2009 GDP by
1.3% + 0.5% = 1.8%.
Actual growth in real GDP was −2.8 percent from 2008 to 2009. If the act raised GDP by 
1.8 percent, then without the act, growth in real GDP would have been
−2.8% − 1.8% = −4.6%.
Viewed this way, the act had a considerable impact on GDP growth.
Fiscal Policies that Directly Target the Labor Market
There are a few specific fiscal policies that are directly targeted at the labor market. For 
example, in the midst of recessions, when many workers have lost their jobs and are un-
employed, governments enact policies to lessen the terrible personal toll of joblessness. In 
the United States, the government extends eligibility for unemployment insurance from  
26 to 52 weeks and, in some severe downturns, even to 99 weeks.
More generous eligibility rules have complex effects on the labor market. Lengthening 
eligibility reduces the hardships that unemployed workers suffer and gives them more time 
to find a job that is a good fit for their skills, but lengthened eligibility also partially reduces 
the incentive for unemployed workers to find new jobs. This shifts the labor supply curve 
to the left, which, holding all else equal, reduces employment.
However, by increasing the incomes of unemployed workers, lengthened eligibility sup-
ports household spending and thus limits the negative multiplier effects that result from 
falling employment. Hence, lengthened eligibility increases household consumption and 
this effect shifts the labor demand curve to the right.
Adding up the different considerations, the extension of unemployment benefits proba-
bly is good policy, but this is due to the suffering that it alleviates and not its effect on GDP. 
Because of the multiple effects with opposing implications for employment, lengthening 
eligibility is likely to have only a limited effect on total employment or GDP.
During recessions another type of fiscal policy reduces unemployment by subsidizing 
wages and thereby encouraging job creation. Such subsidies might be justified when unem-
ployment remains high for a long period of time—for instance, this was the case during the 
Great Depression. Wage subsidies might also be justified when traditional monetary and fiscal 
policy have only limited success in combating unemployment. The last three U.S. recessions 
have been followed by “jobless recoveries,” meaning that the rate of employment growth after 
these three recessions, although positive, has been lower than after earlier recessions.
We show the effect of a subsidy on labor demand and job creation in Exhibit 27.10. With 
a $1 subsidy received by employers, a wage of $10 per hour would cost employers only  
$9 per hour. So the subsidy shifts the labor demand curve right by just enough to create a 
$1 vertical gap between the old and new labor demand curves (drop a vertical line from one

curve to the other to see the $1 gap). An employer who is willing to pay $9 for a worker 
without the subsidy is willing to pay $10 for that worker once the $1 government subsidy 
is in effect. Wage subsidies have been used commonly by European governments since the 
1990s when their economies were also beset by jobless recoveries.
Policy Waste and Policy Lags
Though the government typically funds socially valuable projects 
as part of countercyclical fiscal policy, government waste is often 
a problem. The government frequently funds pork barrel spend-
ing, which is the (derogatory) name given to inefficient public 
spending that politicians value because it increases their popular-
ity with their constituents. For ­example, a senator has an incentive 
to obtain federal funding for an infrastructure project in his or her 
home state, even if the project is expensive and unnecessary, such 
as a bridge to nowhere. Since the home state residents only pay 
approximately 1/50th of the cost of the project (through their federal taxes) but get most of 
the benefits, they are happy to see it built, and the project improves the senator’s in-state 
popularity. In this sense, the senator is personally optimizing when obtaining federal fund-
ing for almost any in-state project, even those with total social costs that exceed their total 
social benefits.
The efficiency of public expenditures further deteriorates when hundreds of billions of 
dollars of new government expenditures need to be spent quickly. The urgency makes it 
harder to identify and efficiently implement the projects that are socially beneficial. In ad-
dition, many of the projects with the highest social return have been funded already, raising 
the chance that a new project won’t be socially desirable. Finally, politics and special inter-
ests sometimes get in the way, increasing the chances that wasteful projects with negative 
social value get funded.
Another important determinant of the effectiveness of expenditure-based policies is the 
lag in implementation. Most spending projects are slow out of the starting gate. It takes a 
long time to build a bridge, a highway, or a school. Plans have to be drawn up. The local 
community has to be consulted. The relevant zoning boards need to mull over the propos-
als, request changes, and then evaluate the amended plans. Environmental impact studies 
have to be conducted. Contractors have to be hired. And only then, construction begins.
For example, when the most recent recession officially ended in June 2009, practically 
none of the $230 billion in infrastructure spending legislated in the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act of (February) 2009 had yet been spent. In June 2010—almost a full 
year after the recession was over—only a quarter of the infrastructure budget had been 
Though the government typically 
funds socially valuable projects 
as part of countercyclical fiscal 
­policy, government waste is often a 
problem.
Exhibit 27.10 The Impact of a $1 Wage 
Subsidy
If the government introduces a $1 per hour 
wage subsidy that is paid to firms, the labor 
demand curve shifts rightward by enough 
so that the new labor demand curve and the 
original labor demand curve are separated 
by a vertical distance of exactly $1. If a firm 
was willing to hire a worker at a wage of $w 
per hour without the subsidy, the firm is will-
ing to hire the worker at a wage of $(w + 1) 
per hour with the subsidy. At the new equi-
librium, employment is higher and the wage 
has risen to w*. Notice that the increase from 
the original equilibrium wage, w, to the new 
equilibrium wage, w*, is less than $1. This is 
because the rise in employment causes a fall 
in the (unsubsidized) value of the marginal 
product of labor (point A).

The “Bridge to Nowhere” was a $398 million project to build a road 
to Gravina Island, Alaska, which has 50 residents and is served by a 
ferry. After generating a national protest over pork barrel spending, 
the bridge was cancelled.
spent. Many of the largest infrastructure projects 
hadn’t spent a penny one full year after the end of 
the recession. Lags like these raise the concern that 
by the time many of the projects are implemented, 
the economy might already be past the point where 
these projects would have been most useful.
In contrast, taxation-based fiscal policy can 
sometimes advance more quickly, for example be-
cause it doesn’t take the Treasury Department long 
to mail every household a check. Taxation-based 
policies also have the advantage that the additional 
spending is done by households themselves so that 
the money is spent on goods and services that they 
value. (Government expenditure also ultimately puts 
money in households’ pockets, but in the process it 
may lead to the implementation of projects of nega-
tive social value.)
Despite these concerns, expenditure-based poli-
cies are still a very useful part of countercyclical 
strategies. Several expenditure-based policies are 
not plagued by waste and lags. For example, most 
economists endorse federal transfers that enable state and local governments to reduce 
layoffs of teachers, firefighters, and police during recessions. Such countercyclical trans-
fers from the federal government to the states are particularly useful because many states 
have balanced-budget rules that prevent them from borrowing during a recession. Without 
federal transfers, states would be forced to lay off many public employees, reducing public 
services and deepening the recession.
Likewise, most economists endorse infrastructure projects—like repairs to bridges and 
highways—that have already passed rigorous cost-benefit analysis. Such projects are said 
to be “shovel ready.”
 
Evidence-Based Economics
O
n December 7, 1941, bombers from six Japanese aircraft carriers attacked the 
U.S. Pacific fleet. The bombers destroyed or damaged 8 battleships, ­numerous 
other ships, and 188 aircraft. The attack on Pearl Harbor catapulted the United 
States into World War II.
The attack also initiated an enormous increase in war-related spending, including the re-
building and expansion of the Pacific fleet. A few months before the attack, when the United 
States was not yet a combatant, analysts forecast that ­preparations for a possible war would 
cost the United States about $100 billion (1941 dollars). Immediately after the attack, esti-
mates for war-related spending rose to $200 ­billion. The economic magnitude of these num-
bers is revealed by comparing this war spending to 1941 GDP, which was $129.4 billion.
Though terrible, wars and the expenditures they trigger can be used to identify the eco-
nomic effects of government expenditure, as economist Valerie Ramey has shown.6 She 
studied 63 years of news articles to identify foreign events that caused a change in U.S. 
government expenditure. Ramey’s data includes many war-related events—like the attack 
on Pearl Harbor—as well as other events like the surprise launch in 1957 of the Soviet 
satellite Sputnik, the first Earth-orbiting satellite, that sparked the space race between the 
United States and the Soviet Union. Ramey estimated that the launch of Sputnik led to an 
expansion of $10.3 billion (1957 dollars) in the U.S. government’s space program.

How much does

stimulate GDP?
In this study, the 
­government expenditure 
multiplier is estimated to lie 
between 0.6 and 1.2.
National income and prod-
uct account data from the 
United States (1939–2008) 
and historical news cover-
age in Business Week, the 
New York Times, and the 
Washington Post.
Ramey’s analysis 
­measures the government 
­expenditure multiplier that 
arises from ­expenditures 
that are mostly ­war-related. 
The analysis might 
­underestimate the 
­government expenditure 
multiplier during periods 
of economic slack, like 
recessions.
On December 7, 1941, 
­Japanese bombers attacked 
Pearl Harbor, catapulting the 
United States into World War 
II and drastically raising the 
expected level of future govern-
ment expenditure.
Surprising foreign events that change government expenditure present us with a natural 
experiment—­recall the discussion of natural experiments in Chapter 2. In Ramey’s study, a 
foreign shock causes the government to spend more for reasons unrelated to the state of the 
economy. She then compared the growth of GDP after these large random spending shocks 
to the growth of GDP in periods that did not experience such shocks.
Using such comparisons, Ramey estimated a government expenditure multiplier ­between 
0.6 and 1.2. In other words, when the government raises expenditure by $1 (because of a 
surprising foreign event), GDP increases by an amount between $0.60 and $1.2. The range 
of possible values is large because we don’t have enough historical data to pin down a more 
precise answer.

27.4
Policies That Blur 
the Line Between Fiscal 
and Monetary Policy
Some countercyclical policies represent a mix of fiscal and monetary effects. For example, 
some government expenditures are intended to affect the supply of credit.
The 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) is an example of such a mixed policy. 
At the peak of the 2007–2009 financial crisis, the U.S. Congress passed emergency legisla-
tion authorizing the Treasury Department to spend $700 billion to stabilize the financial 
system. The Treasury Department is a government agency that resides in the executive 
branch and therefore is not part of the Fed. Nevertheless, the TARP legislation was devel-
oped jointly by Fed and Treasury officials and the legislation required that the Fed chair-
man be consulted during TARP’s implementation.
Of the $700 billion in TARP funds, $115 billion was used to increase the capital 
of the eight largest U.S. banks, which were all forced to participate. In essence, the 
banks were required to issue new shares that the government bought. Some of the 
banks didn’t like this plan, since the government became a partial owner. In addition, 
all eight banks were obligated to limit the compensation of their senior executives. An 
additional $135 billion was used to increase the capital of smaller banks that applied 
for TARP support.
These bank capital infusions—totaling $250 billion—gave the participating banks 
breathing room, and the financial system as a whole stabilized. The financial system came 
back from the brink of a devastating financial contagion in which banks were falling like 
dominos, each failure instigating other failures as banks couldn’t repay their debts to one 
another. TARP funding is now viewed as a successful policy, though there remain questions 
about whether it played a causal role in rescuing the economy or simply appeared to be 
successful because of coincidental timing.
The bank capital infusions ended up costing the government little, since the govern-
ment was repaid after the crisis had passed. In fact, the government made a small profit 
from its TARP investments in the banks. However, there were many government pro-
grams other than TARP that benefited banks, so banks were net recipients of government 
support.
You might be wondering about the $450 billion of TARP funding that was not used to 
buy bank shares. Dozens of other programs were funded by TARP, including investments 
in the bankrupt car companies General Motors and Chrysler and the nearly bankrupt insur-
ance company AIG. When the dust settled, the government was able to recoup most of its 
investment, and the government’s support prevented these important companies from shut-
ting down their operations at the peak of the crisis. Such shutdowns would have aggravated 
the crisis, leading to an even deeper recession.
We do not know what would have happened without TARP and the other countercycli-
cal fiscal and monetary policies that were adopted during the financial crisis. It would 
be convenient if we could set up numerous identical economies to study macroeconomic 
policy interventions, just like a laboratory scientist would do. In one economy, we would 
include TARP. In another otherwise identical economy, we would not. We could then see 
which economy had better performance. Because economists can’t run experiments like 
that, we are stuck with making judgments based on less than perfect data and models of 
economic behavior. Though most economists think that TARP was a success, it is impos-
sible to be sure.

Summary
Countercyclical policies attempt to reduce the intensity of economic 
fluctuations and smooth the growth rates of employment, GDP, and prices.
Countercyclical monetary policy, which is conducted by the central bank  
(in the United States, the Fed), attempts to reduce economic fluctuations by 
manipulating bank reserves and interest rates.
Open market operations refer to the Fed’s transactions with private banks 
to increase or reduce bank reserves held on deposit at the Fed. Open market 
operations influence the federal funds rate—an increase in the supply of bank 
reserves lowers the federal funds rate, holding all else equal.
Expansionary monetary policy increases the quantity of bank reserves and 
lowers interest rates, shifting the labor demand curve to the right and increasing 
the growth rate of GDP. 
Contractionary monetary policy slows down the growth in bank reserves and 
increases interest rates, shifting the labor demand curve to the left and reducing 
the growth rate of GDP. Contractionary monetary policy is used when inflation 
is rising above the Fed’s long-run target of 2 percent or when the economy is 
growing excessively quickly.
Countercyclical fiscal policy, which is passed by the legislative branch 
and signed into law by the executive branch, reduces economic fluctuations by 
manipulating government expenditures and taxes.
Countercyclical fiscal policies might be automatic or discretionary. 
Automatic stabilizers are components of the government budget, like taxes owed, 
that automatically adjust to smooth out economic fluctuations.
Expansionary fiscal policy uses higher government expenditure and lower 
taxes to increase GDP, shifting the labor demand curve to the right. Crowding 
out occurs when rising government expenditure partially (or even fully) displaces 
expenditures by households and firms.
Contractionary fiscal policy uses lower government expenditure and higher 
taxes to reduce GDP, shifting the labor demand curve to the left.
Some policies, like the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), blur 
the line between monetary policy and fiscal policy.

	 4.	 You and a friend are debating the merits of using mon-
etary policy during a severe recession. Your friend says 
that the central bank needs to lower interest rates all the 
way down to zero. According to him, zero nominal in-

ers and firms will surely borrow and spend when interest 
rates are zero. Would you agree with his reasoning? How 
does the level of inflation affect your answer? Explain 
your conclusions.

too warm, the thermostat turns off the heater; if it gets too 
cold, the thermostat turns the heater back on. If everything

works as planned, the room temperature in the house 
should roughly be the targeted temperature all the time.
Now suppose the thermostat is not in the same room 
as the heater. In fact, it’s in the last room that is affected 
by the heater. Say, the attic. And the radiators through 
which the heater works are really old, and it takes them 
at least twenty minutes to react. Then, instead of making 
the temperature more stable, the thermostat would make 
the temperature swing wildly. For example, if the house 
is cold, then the thermostat will turn the heater on. But it 
will turn the heater off only when the attic is warm. By 
then, the entire house will be scorching hot. When it turns 
the heater off, it will not turn it back on until the attic is 
cooler. By then, the house will be freezing.”
(In this analogy, the thermostat is the Fed; the house is 
the entire economy.)

say about monetary policy? (Hint: You do not need to 
draw any graphs for this question.)
	
b.	 As in the thermostat analogy, what might be some pos-
sible unintended consequences of monetary policy?  
Might there be a similar effect for fiscal policy? If yes, 
how does it differ from monetary policy?

in which the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) 
had some of the characteristics of monetary policy, and 
some of the characteristics of fiscal policy.
	11.	 Challenge Problem. The chapter mentions that an open 
market operation by the Fed can increase or decrease the 
quantity of deposits in banks and therefore the money 
supply. (See, for example, Exhibit 27.8.)
The expansion in the money supply from a Fed 
open market operation is given by the following equa-
tion ­(under the simplifying assumption that households 
don’t hold cash so the money supply is equal to demand 
deposits):
Change in money supply= (Change in reserves) × 
1
RR + ER ,
where RR = the percentage of deposits that banks are 
required to keep as reserves (expressed as a decimal), and

701
ER = the percentage of deposits that banks voluntarily 
hold as excess reserves (expressed as a decimal).
1/(RR + ER) is called the “money multiplier.”
Suppose the Fed decides to sell $14 billion in Treasury 
bonds. Assume that the reserve requirement is 8 percent 
and banks hold 4 percent in excess reserves, so RR = 0.08 
and ER = 0.04.
What is the total increase or decrease in the money 
supply that would result from the Fed’s action? Explain 
your answer and show your calculations. Verify that the 
quantity of new deposits (which is the change in the 
money supply in this example) is backed up by an ad-
equate quantity of new reserves: 
(RR + ER) × (Change in deposits) = (Change in 
reserves).
	12.	 Challenge Problem. Assume that the public in the small 
country of Sylvania does not hold any cash. Commercial 
banks, however, hold 5 percent of their checking deposits 
as excess reserves, regardless of the interest rate. In the 
questions that follow, use the “money multiplier” equa-
tion from Problem 11.

Are companies like Nike 
harming workers in 
Vietnam?
Consumers love sneakers. Nike alone sells 
­approximately $15 billion of them each year. 
Nike conducts much of its production in places 
like Vietnam, using subcontractors that employ 
workers with little education who are paid around 
$4–$5 per day. Some subcontractors even employ 
children, although it is illegal to do so and Nike officially bans such 
practices. Employees in many of these factories put in 60-hour work weeks with 
working conditions that do not come close to meeting U.S. and European safety 
standards. Critics denounce such sweatshops and student groups have occasion-
ally advocated boycotts of Nike products. Prodded by these protestors, Nike has 
tried to clean up its act. Even though the Nike subcontractors still pay very little, 
the factories have become much safer over the past 20 years.
This situation is just the tip of the iceberg of low wages and poor 
­working conditions throughout parts of the interconnected global economy. 
U.S. ­consumers are some of the beneficiaries of this trade. Are consumers to 
blame for ­buying sneakers manufactured in sweatshops?

KEY IDEAS
International trade enables countries to focus on activities in which they 
have a comparative advantage.
The current account includes international flows from exports, imports, 
factor payments, and transfers.
If a country runs a current account deficit, it pays for this by giving its 
trading partners financial IOUs. If a country runs a current account surplus, it 
receives financial IOUs from its trading partners.  
The world has become more globalized over the past several decades.
Trade, both within and between countries, enhances our quality of life by increasing 
the efficiency of production. In modern economies, goods and services are produced by 
individuals who specialize in their production. For example, your professor spent years 
mastering economics. Similarly, the engineers who work for Apple have extensive train-
ing in their particular line of work.
An Apple engineer can’t produce insightful economics research or teach an economics 
course. Likewise, an economics professor can’t design a miniaturized circuit board and a 
high throughput factory to manufacture it. In a market system, people choose occupations 
that suit their talents and interests. Then they develop specialized skills in their chosen 
industry and trade with others. Trade exploits gains from specialization, which are the 
economic gains that society obtains by having some workers specialize in specific produc-
tive activities.
Specialization won’t work without trade. Economics professors can’t eat economic 
ideas or live in them. Economists teach, and then get paid with money, and then use the 
money to buy food and shelter. Apple engineers love the iPhone, 
but they can’t sleep on it or drive it to work. Engineers get paid so 
they can buy what they want.
Without opportunities for trade, life is bleak. If your econom-
ics professor were stranded on an island, he or she would have no 
students to teach and no policymakers to advise. The professor 
would have little or no way to put economic knowledge to use. 
Despite all of that knowledge, day-to-day life would resemble 
that of a Stone Age hunter-gatherer.
Absolute Advantage and Comparative 
Advantage
To gain a deeper understanding of how trade works, consider the 
late Steve Jobs, the visionary chief ­executive officer (CEO) of 
Apple. Jobs was famous for being a great marketer and a brilliant 
designer.
Because of his knowledge of and love for Apple products, Jobs 
was a much better salesperson than most of Apple’s employees. 
To illustrate this point, let’s assume that Jobs could sell twice as 
many computers (per time period) compared to the typical Apple 
storeclerk. In this sense, Jobs had an absolute advantage at selling

Gains from specialization are the 
economic gains that society can 
obtain by having some individuals, 
regions, or countries specialize in 
the production of certain goods 
and services.

computers. A producer has an absolute advantage in producing a good or service if the 
producer can produce more units per hour than other producers.
Of course, selling computers isn’t the only skill that Jobs had. As CEO, he designed 
revolutionary new products. Relative to a typical salesclerk, Jobs was a superstar designer. 
Let’s assume that if Jobs allocated his time to design, he would generate 1,000 design ideas 
per year. If a typical salesclerk worked on design, he would generate only one design idea 
per year.
Let’s give the typical Apple salesclerk a name: Chuck Chores. Exhibit 28.1 reports the 
estimated productivity of Jobs in the first column of data and the estimated productivity of 
Chores in the final column.
By looking across the rows of Exhibit 28.1, we see that Jobs has an absolute advantage 
in both tasks: Jobs was capable of producing twice as many sales per year (relative to 
Chores) and Jobs was capable of producing 1,000 times as many useful design ideas per 
year (relative to Chores). Which task should Apple have asked him to do?
To answer this question, let’s calculate the opportunity cost per unit of production 
or, more precisely, the opportunity cost of a design idea in terms of forgone sales. This 
calculation will answer the following question: how many sales are given up to produce 
a design idea? A worker has a comparative advantage in design when the opportunity 
cost of the worker’s design idea is lower than the opportunity cost of other workers’ de-
sign ideas. More generally, a worker has a comparative advantage in producing a good 
(or service) when he has a lower opportunity cost per unit produced compared to other 
producers.
Exhibit 28.1 implies that Steve Jobs forgoes 2,000 sales for every 1,000 design ideas 
that he generates, or 2,000/1,000 = 2 forgone sales per design idea. On the other hand, 
Chuck Chores forgoes 1,000 sales for every design idea that he generates.
With that calculation in mind, we can determine how production should be optimally 
organized. Apple can produce design ideas by allocating Jobs to design, with an oppor-
tunity cost of 2 forgone sales per design idea. Or Apple can produce design ideas from 
Chores with an opportunity cost of 1,000 forgone sales per design idea. Since Jobs has a 
lower opportunity cost for each design idea (2 forgone sales for Jobs versus 1,000 forgone 
sales for Chores), Jobs has a comparative advantage in design ideas. Hence, Apple should 
allocate Jobs to work on design and Chores to work on sales (as long as it needs both types 
of activities).
You can verify that the same conclusion would have been reached if we calculated the 
opportunity cost of a sale in terms of forgone design ideas. Using Exhibit 28.1, we find 
that Jobs forgoes 1,000 design ideas for every 2,000 sales. Because 1,000/2,000 = ½, Jobs 
has an opportunity cost of ½ forgone design idea per sale. Chores forgoes 1 design idea 
for every 1,000 sales, so Chores has an opportunity cost of 1/1,000 forgone design idea per 
sale. Because Chores has the lower opportunity cost per sale, he should be the one doing 
sales and Jobs should work on design.
Comparative advantage is the idea that opportunity cost, not absolute advantage, should 
be used to determine which producer is assigned to which task. Just relying on absolute 
advantage would not have been sufficient for Apple to determine whether Jobs should work 
in design or in sales: Jobs has an absolute advantage in working as a salesclerk and he has 
an absolute advantage in working as a designer.
Until now, we have assumed that the work allocation decision is being made by Apple. 
Although such decisions are sometimes made by corporations, in practice they are often 
the result of choices that individuals make for themselves. Jobs himself decided to found 
Apple and work as a designer, while many individuals such as Chores apply to become 
salesclerks, not designers. Why is this?
The career choices that individuals make are also a consequence of comparative ad-
vantage, but, in this case, the key economic signals are market prices. In fact, one of the

powerful implications of comparative advantage is that market prices will induce individu-
als to choose occupations and activities that line up with their comparative advantage.
To see this, suppose that Jobs and Chores sell their skills in a competitive labor market 
in which their wages are equal to their (personal) contribution to value added (recall from 
Chapter 19 that value added is defined as a firm’s sales revenue minus the firm’s purchases 
of intermediate products from other firms). To simplify the analysis, suppose that the econ-
omy consists only of workers like Jobs and Chores and that the economy needs both design 
and sales functions to be performed. We will now see that equilibrium prices must be such 
that workers with productivity similar to Jobs will choose to work in design and those with 
productivity similar to Chores will choose to work in sales.
Let’s start by assuming that the prices in this economy are such that the value added from 
each computer sale is $50 and the value added from each design idea is also $50. If you mul-
tiply output in Exhibit 28.1 by value added per task, you’ll generate the results in panel (a) of 
Exhibit 28.2. These numbers imply that both Jobs and Chores will maximize their own wages 
if they work in sales: $100,000 for Jobs in sales versus $50,000 for Jobs in design; $50,000 
for Chores in sales versus $50 for Chores in design. Hence, workers like Jobs and workers like 
Chores will both work in sales. But this cannot be a market equilibrium because the economy 
needs both functions—design and sales—to be performed. If everyone is working in sales, 
there will be no design ideas in this economy, pushing the value added from design much 
higher than $50 (there would be a shortage of design, raising the relative wages of designers).
What happens if market prices for design become much higher so that value added from 
each design idea now shoots up to $100,000 (holding fixed value added from sales at $50)? 
The resulting wages are shown in panel (b) of Exhibit 28.2. Now we have a situation in 
which both Jobs and Chores have higher wages in design, thus all workers in this economy 
will now choose design careers. But this also cannot be a market equilibrium. Now there 
will be no sales in the economy and a lot of design ideas. Yet again the economy needs 
both functions to be performed, and this will push the relative wages of salespeople higher.
You have probably already guessed that equilibrium prices will need to settle some-
where between these two extremes. Equilibrium prices should induce some people to do 
design and some others to do sales. Take another combination of values: $50 of value added 
per sale and $5,000 of value added per design idea. The resulting wages are shown in panel 
(c) of Exhibit 28.2. At these wages, it is clear that Chores will choose to work in sales while 
Jobs focuses on design. Indeed, at these wages Jobs would be greatly misallocating his time 
if he worked as a salesclerk.
The key insight is that market prices will adjust so that individuals choose occupations 
consistent with their comparative advantages. This is the sense in which trade in the market 
supports and reinforces comparative advantage. In fact, without such trade we could not 
realize the gains from comparative advantage. For example, it is trade that allowed Steve 
Jobs to hire other people to work as salesclerks in Apple stores, enabling him to focus on 
his comparative advantage: designing the next beautiful gizmo that everyone wants to have.
At this point, you might be curious about whether one could have picked a value added 
for each sale and a value added for each design that would make Jobs choose sales while 
Chores would prefer to do design. Comparative advantage ­implies that the answer is no.

If their different opportunity costs lead Jobs and Chores to choose different 
tasks, comparative advantage always implies it will be Jobs who earns more 
in design than in sales, and Chores who earns more in sales than in design.
Comparative Advantage and International Trade
To illustrate how international trade exploits comparative ­advantage—
much like the division of labor between Steve Jobs and Chuck Chores—
consider a particular Apple product, the iPod. In some sense, the iPod is a 
U.S. ­product—designed by engineers in the United States by a company 
headquartered in the United States. However, it is not actually manufactured 
in the United States. Each iPod is composed of hundreds of parts, most of 
which are manufactured and assembled outside the United States.
Let’s consider some of the key components. The iPod has a hard drive 
where the songs and videos and photos are stored. This is produced in Japan. 
It also has a memory card, which is produced in Korea. The central process-
ing unit, on the other hand, is produced in the United States. Specialization 
explains this proliferation of locations. For example, the Japanese company 
Toshiba specializes in hard drive manufacturing and has become a world 
leader in the production of tiny hard drives with very low failure rates. Gains 
from specialization are realized by delegating production of two of these 
three key parts to manufacturers outside the United States. Finally, all of the components 
are combined into the final product on a Chinese assembly line.1
Comparative advantage in international trade explains why Chinese workers assemble 
iPods, even though U.S. workers have an absolute advantage in assembly. Let’s begin by 
considering the hourly productivity of U.S. and Chinese workers in different tasks. For the 
moment, we’ll assume that in terms of their productivity, the U.S. workers are all identical 
to one another and the Chinese workers are also all identical to one another—a simplifying 
assumption that we’ll revisit later in the chapter.
The first row of Exhibit 28.3 shows that a U.S. worker would assemble 20,000 iPods per 
year, which is 15,000 more than a Chinese worker would assemble. The difference between 
U.S. and Chinese workers in their productivity arises for a variety of reasons. Workers in the 
United States currently have relatively more education and thus greater human capital (recall 
from Chapter 20 that human capital is each person’s stock of ability to produce output or eco-
nomic value). This greater human capital makes U.S. workers more productive in a range of 
tasks. In addition, U.S. workers currently have access to more physical capital per worker and 
better technology—for instance, robotic assembly lines—than their Chinese counterparts.
Consider another task, which we refer to as research and development, or R&D. We 
assume that U.S. workers generate 10 R&D innovations per year. We assume that Chinese 
workers, who currently don’t have as much education as U.S. workers, would be much less 
effective at this, and we assume that their productivity in R&D is 1 innovation per year.
Looking across the rows in Exhibit 28.3, we see that U.S. workers have an absolute 
advantage in both assembly and R&D. Considering only absolute advantage, it’s tempting 
to guess that both assembly and R&D should be performed in the United States. But this 
is the wrong conclusion for the same reason that Steve Jobs shouldn’t have been working 
as a salesclerk.
To determine the optimal allocation across industries, we again need to use the con-
cepts of opportunity cost and comparative advantage. We can verify that U.S. workers 
have a comparative advantage in R&D. Their productivity in assembly relative to R&D 
is 20,000/10 = 2,000/1. In other words, U.S. workers forgo the assembly of 2,000 ­iPods 
for every R&D innovation they generate. Chinese workers’ productivity in assembly 
relative to R&D is 5,000/1. Chinese workers forgo the assembly of 5,000 ­iPods for 
Steve Jobs, Apple’s most productive salesclerk.

every R&D innovation they generate. The U.S. workers thus have a lower opportunity 
cost per R&D innovation (2,000 forgone iPod assemblies) compared to Chinese work-
ers (5,000 forgone iPod assemblies). This implies that U.S. workers have a comparative 
advantage in R&D and should focus on R&D, while Chinese workers should (cur-
rently) specialize in assembly.
To further illustrate the allocation of tasks between U.S. and Chinese workers, suppose 
that workers in both economies are paid the value added they generate and that the value 
added from each iPod assembly is $1.50 and the value added from each R&D innovation 
is $5,000. If you multiply output in Exhibit 28.3 by value added per task, you’ll generate 
the results in Exhibit 28.4, which describes annual wages of U.S. and Chinese workers in 
assembly and R&D.
Looking at Exhibit 28.4, you can see that the U.S. worker 
will choose to specialize in R&D and the Chinese worker 
will specialize in assembly. In fact, for the same reasons that 
we highlighted in our discussion of the allocation problem 
of Steve Jobs and Chuck Chores, value added and market 
prices cannot be such that both U.S. and Chinese workers 
all have greater value added in assembly or such that they 
all have greater value added in R&D, because otherwise the 
world economy would not generate both iPod assemblies 
and R&D ideas. Given the current pattern of comparative 
advantage (in R&D for U.S. workers and in iPod assembly 
for Chinese workers), if these workers are choosing differ-
ent tasks, then it must be the case that it is the U.S. workers 
who are specializing in R&D and the Chinese workers who 
are working in assembly.
As in our earlier example, trade is essential to achieve an 
efficient allocation of resources. If there were no interna-
tional trade, then U.S. workers would end up spending less time on R&D and more time on 
assembly, lowering the value of their total output.
Efficiency and Winners and Losers from Trade
By exploiting comparative advantage, international trade increases overall economic effi-
ciency. For example, if Apple could not assemble iPods in foreign countries, it would have 
to do so in the United States, and the cost of making an iPod would rise. As a result, iPods 
would likely cost 10 percent or 20 percent more than they do now. Consumers benefit from 
international trade and the resulting international division of labor.
At this point you might wonder whether foreign iPod production prevents the United States 
from benefiting from its own innovation. How much of the value added from iPod manufac-
turing goes to foreign producers and not to the iPod’s U.S. inventors? Of course, even if all of 
the value added went to foreign workers, U.S. consumers would still benefit from the low cost 
of an iPod. But is a low retail price the only benefit that U.S. residents receive?
A study by economists Greg Linden, Kenneth Kraemer, and Jason Dedrick shows that 
a large part of the retail price of an iPod is ultimately received by U.S. residents.2 For 
­iPods sold in the United States through a retailer other than Apple, 41 percent of the value 
added is generated by U.S. firms other than Apple, including distributors, retailers, and 
component manufacturers with domestic production facilities. Another 45 percent of the 
value added goes to Apple, the company that designed the iPod and owns the intellectual 
property rights. These are not just corporate earnings, since Apple has a large team of in-
house engineers, designers, and executives whose salaries are paid with Apple’s revenues.

Chapter 28  |  Macroeconomics and International Trade
The example of the iPod illustrates that international trade contributes to value added in the 
United States as well as low prices for U.S. consumers.
The iPod story is not unusual. Other products confirm the same pattern of widely shared 
benefits from trade. For example, Hewlett-Packard’s laptop computers are assembled in 
low-wage countries like China and Brazil. Nevertheless, over half of the value added from 
the production of these laptops accrues to residents of the United States.
This doesn’t mean that everybody gains from trade. Though 
international trade achieves a more efficient allocation of re-
sources and creates potential gains for society as a whole, in 
any given instance, trade will produce some winners and some 
­losers. We can see this by going back to the issue of U.S.-China 
trade. When we discussed the gains from exploiting compara-
tive advantage, we talked of the typical U.S. worker. In practice, 
of course, the United States isn’t inhabited by “typical” U.S. 
workers, but by some U.S. workers with high levels of skill, and 
others with low levels of skill and a comparative ­advantage in as-
sembly. International trade causes routine assembly jobs to move 
to developing countries like China, and as a result, there are many fewer assembly jobs 
performed in the United States today than three decades ago. If they can no longer find 
assembly jobs, those U.S. workers with a comparative advantage in assembly are made 
worse off by the outsourcing of assembly jobs to countries like China. This is illustrated 
by our Evidence-Based Economics feature in Chapter 23, which showed how workers in 
areas specializing in products competing with Chinese imports have experienced employ-
ment losses.
When considering the consequences of opening a country to free international trade, it 
is important to recognize that within that country there will be winners and losers. The effi-
ciencies achieved by exploiting comparative advantage and specialization are so great that 
the winners will be far more numerous than the losers. In principle, the winners could com-
pensate the losers so that everyone would be better off as a result of free trade. In practice, 
however, this is usually not possible, because it is hard for the government to identify how 
much each person has gained or lost as a consequence of international trade. Hence, the 
government can’t compensate the losers with targeted individual subsidies. With imperfect 
targeting or no compensating redistribution by the government, many people do end up on 
the losing side of the ledger. Nevertheless, because many more end up on the winning side, 
open international trade still tends to be favored by economists.
How We Trade
To realize the gains from comparative advantage and specialization, the United States and 
China need to trade goods and services. This takes the form of imports and exports. Recall 
from Chapter 19 that imports refer to the goods and services that are produced abroad and 
sold domestically, and exports are the goods and services that are produced domestically 
and sold abroad. Thus exports from the United States to China are China’s imports from 
the United States.
In theory it is possible for a country not to have any exports or imports. Such a country 
that doesn’t trade—that is, does not have any imports or exports—is said to be a closed 
economy. Today, not a single country has an entirely closed economy, but North Korea, a 
totalitarian dictatorship with mostly closed borders, comes the closest.
An open economy allows international trade, and in most countries such trade amounts 
to a significant share of GDP. For example, in 2012, the United Kingdom’s imports equaled 
34 percent of GDP, double the import share in the United States. But neither country could 
compete with Hong Kong and Singapore, which each had 2012 imports equaling about 
200 percent of GDP. Hong Kong and Singapore have such large import shares since many 
of their imports are later re-exported with only modest value added domestically. For ex-
ample, if a country imports $200 of electronic parts and ­assembles them into a $250 smart 
phone, then the value added is just $50. In this illustrative example, imports are 4 times the 
level of GDP (because only value added is counted in GDP). If the assembled phone is later 
exported, then exports ($250) are 5 times the level of value added.
Though international trade achieves 
a more efficient allocation of 
­resources . . . in any given instance, 
trade will produce some winners  
and some losers.
A closed economy does not trade 
with the rest of the world.
An open economy trades freely with 
the rest of the world.

Exhibit 28.5 depicts the evolution of U.S. imports and exports as a share of GDP since 1929. 
In 1950, imports amounted to 4 percent of GDP. In 2013, the import share was 16 percent. 
Economically speaking, the United States is now more closely linked to the rest of the world 
than at any other period in U.S. history.
The increase in imports and exports as a share of GDP is not confined to the United 
States. Most major economies in the world have been trading more over the last 50 years. 
Exhibit 28.6 plots the evolution of imports as a share of GDP for Germany, China, India, 
and the world average, as well as the United States.
Trade Barriers: Tariffs
Because international trade creates winners and losers, there are some opponents to trade. 
As a result, most countries, including the United States, impose a host of trade barriers 
that reduce their imports. The most common restrictions are tariffs, which are special taxes 
levied only on imports.
The average U.S. tariff on all imported products was 2.8 percent in 2011, down from over 
5 percent in 1990. The average 2011 tariff of 2.8 percent masked an enormous amount of 
variation across industries. In recent years, the average U.S. tariff on agricultural products 
has been 62 percent. Tariffs on tobacco have run to approximately 90 percent, while tariffs 
on sugar have been even higher, sometimes exceeding 100 percent. Such tariffs naturally

discourage international trade. Due to tariffs and trade barriers, 
U.S. sugar imports have fallen 80 percent over the last 30 years.
Some developing countries use tariffs to raise revenue, be-
cause they don’t have well-functioning tax systems and can more 
easily tax imports that flow through a few urban ports than they 
can tax domestic economic activity that is widely geographically 
dispersed. On the other hand, developed countries overwhelm-
ingly use tariffs to protect domestic producers. In fact, some tar-
iffs are set at such a high level that they block imports completely 
and therefore raise no revenue since there are no imports to tax. Powerful domestic produc-
ers lobby governments to impose tariffs that will drive out foreign competition and increase 
the domestic industry’s profits. Of course, this benefit to the domestic industry is a cost to 
domestic consumers, because they end up paying higher prices.
In some cases, trade wars create comical inefficiencies. In the 1960s, Germany and 
France restricted imports of U.S. chickens. The U.S. retaliated with a punitive tariff on 
imports of European light trucks. Today, Mercedes-Benz assembles light trucks at a fac-
tory in Dusseldorf, Germany and tests the trucks to verify that they drive properly. Then 
­Mercedes-Benz partially disassembles the trucks by removing the engines, bumpers, drive-
shafts, fuel tanks, and exhaust systems. The trucks are exported to the United States, where 
Mercedes-Benz doesn’t need to pay the U.S. tariff, because the trucks aren’t fully assem-
bled. At a warehouse in South ­Carolina, the disassembled parts are screwed on again.3
Given the importance of specialization and comparative 
advantage, the world is highly interconnected through 
imports and exports. The first and most obvious facet of 
this interconnection is the array of goods and services 
we consume. Look at the shelves of your local Walmart 
and you will find an enormous number of items made in 
China, Mexico, and Brazil. Two-thirds of the goods sold 
in Walmart are imported. For example, Walmart annually 
imports over $30 billion worth of goods from China.
Check out the geography of trade whenever you go 
shopping. You’ll be amazed at the range of countries that 
manufacture the goods you buy. You may think of Pakistan 
only as a hotbed of political and religious unrest on the 
border of Afghanistan. Pakistan also happens to manufac-
ture half of the world’s hand-stitched soccer balls. Pakistan 
is also an important exporter of textiles and clothing. Look 
at the latest fashions on display at Banana Republic or Old 
Navy, and you will see that much of this clothing is pro-
duced in India, Indonesia, Turkey, and Vietnam.
Many people mistakenly believe that international 
trade can only flow in goods. Services, however, are also 
getting into the act. In 2013, the United States imported 
$453 billion in services and exported $682 billion in ser-
vices. The next time you call a computer company for ad-
vice about removing a virus or upgrading software, ask 
the technician where he or she is located. There’s a good 
chance you are speaking to someone in India, where 
service representatives carefully hone American accents 
and adopt American names during working hours. Carol 
Miller might be Bhumika Chaturvedi.
Many of the services that now flow across international 
boundaries are very sophisticated. The United States 
exports entertainment services—music and movies—and 
financial services—financial advice given by a New York 
investment bank to an oil exploration company in Brazil.
Even medical services can be traded internationally. 
An Indian radiologist—a physician specializing in reading 
X-rays—earns one-eighth of a U.S. radiologist’s income. 
So an Indian radiologist has a lower opportunity cost of 
time than a U.S. radiologist. There is a small group of 
­Indian teleradiologists who read X-rays for hospitals in the 
United States, United Kingdom, and Singapore. Here’s 
how it works. A patient who is a resident of the United 
Kingdom has an X-ray taken at a U.K. hospital. The ­images 
are uploaded to a teleradiologist in Bangalore, India. The 
teleradiologist examines the X-ray for abnormalities, like 
tumors, writes a report, and then sends it back to the 
­patient’s U.K. physician.

The Current Account 
and the Financial Account
In 2013, U.S. imports amounted to $2,746 billion. Of this amount, $456 billion was im-
ported from China. In most years, approximately 1/7th of U.S. imports come from China.
In 2013, the United States exported goods and services worth $2,271 billion. That year, 
U.S. exports to China were $157 billion. Approximately 1/20th of U.S. exports go to China.
To some pundits, the fact that the United States imports more from China than it ex-
ports to China is a sign of a serious problem. However, there is no reason to expect that 
U.S. exports to China should equal U.S. imports from China, in the same way that there is 
no reason to expect your own purchases from the grocery store to equal the grocery store 
owner’s purchases from you. If you own a Ford dealership and the grocery store owner 
loves Cadillacs, then you’ll never get a dollar of her business. But that’s OK as long as there 
are other people who are interested in buying your Fords.
That’s generally the way that markets and exchanges work. There is no need to sell our 
goods and services to the same people from whom we buy goods and services. Now apply that 
idea to a national economy. There is nothing necessarily wrong with the fact that the United 
States as a whole sells relatively little to China and still buys a lot from China. There are other 
countries, like Brazil, to which the United States sells lots of stuff and from which the United 
States buys relatively little. These facts lead us to the observation that trade between two 
specific countries—also referred to as bilateral trade—will rarely be balanced. This does not 
imply that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the United States–China trade relationship, 
but these arguments do imply that a bilateral trade imbalance is not necessarily a bad thing.
Trade Surpluses and Trade Deficits
There is another important sense in which trade can be imbalanced. Sometimes a coun-
try imports more or less than it exports to the world as a whole. We’ll see that even this 
imbalance can also be socially desirable, though it depends on the reasons for the trade 
imbalance.
When a country as a whole imports more from abroad than it exports abroad, the coun-
try runs a trade deficit. This is a case of spending on imports more than the country earns 
from exports. Exports minus imports is defined as net exports or the trade balance. When 
the trade balance is positive, it is referred to as a trade surplus. When the trade balance is 
negative, it is called a trade deficit. In 2013, U.S. net exports were negative, so the United 
States ran a trade deficit:
 Net exports = Exports	
−	
Imports
 = $2,271 billion − $2,746 billion = −$475 billion. 
28.2 
In March 2002, President George W. Bush imposed 8 per-
cent to 30 percent tariffs on steel imports. The move was 
widely viewed as a political decision to shore up support 
among industrial states that might switch party allegiance 
in the November midterm election. If you ran for office, 
would you do the same thing, even if you believe in the 
benefits of trade?
The U.S. trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, even 
admitted during a speech in Brazil that political calculations 
had motivated the new tariffs: “We are committed to 
­moving forward with free trade, but, like Brazil, we have to 
manage political support for free trade at home. We have 
to create coalitions.” The administration maintained the 
tariffs despite a flood of world-wide criticism and threats 
among many countries to erect punitive tariffs in response. 
One month after the U.S. election, the administration 
­reversed itself and removed the tariffs.4

Net exports are the value of the 
country’s exports minus the value 
of its imports. Net exports are also 
known as the trade balance.
A trade surplus is an excess of 
exports over imports and is thus the 
name given to the trade balance 
when it is positive.
A trade deficit is an excess of 
imports over exports and is thus the 
name given to the trade balance 
when it is negative.

International Financial Flows
It might appear that knowing the value of the trade balance is sufficient for understanding 
how payments flow from one country to another. However, a complete understanding of 
international financial flows requires more details. We need to study all the sources of pay-
ments from foreign residents to domestic residents, and all the sources of payments from 
domestic residents to foreign residents. Trade flows represent only one source of these 
financial payments.
The international accounting system is built upon the concept of residency, not the con-
cept of citizenship. In this accounting system, domestic residents are people who reside in 
the United States, whether or not they are U.S. citizens. So a Japanese citizen living in the 
United States is defined as a domestic resident of the United States in the official interna-
tional trade accounts. Residents of foreign countries—we’ll call them “foreigners”—are 
people who reside outside the United States (some of whom are U.S. citizens living abroad).
Income-Based Payments from Foreigners  Let’s start with income-based payments 
from foreigners. There are three ways that domestic residents receive income-based 
payments from foreigners:
	
1.	 Receiving payments from the sale of goods and services to foreigners—exports
	
2.	 Receiving income from assets that the domestic resident owns in foreign 
­countries—factor payments from foreigners
	
3.	 Receiving transfers from individuals who reside abroad or from foreign 
­governments—transfers from foreigners
Recall that exports are the goods and services that domestic residents produce and then 
sell in foreign countries. When a foreign resident receives these goods and services, he 
directly or indirectly makes a payment to the domestic resident who produced them.
Factor payments from foreigners represent the payments that domestic residents receive 
from assets owned in foreign countries. For example, if a U.S. resident owns stock in Tata 
Steel, one of the largest companies in India, and Tata Steel pays a dividend, that dividend 
payment would count as a factor payment from abroad. Likewise, if a U.S. company owns 
a plant in China and that plant generates earnings, those earnings would count as a factor 
payment from abroad. Or, if a U.S. engineer who resides in the United States spends a day 
working in Turin, Italy, where she consults for Fiat, the payment that she receives from Fiat 
would count as a factor payment from abroad. In this consulting example, the relevant fac-
tor of production is human capital.
Transfers from foreigners are “gifts” from foreign residents or foreign governments. 
For example, following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, China sent 104 tons of emergency 
supplies to New Orleans, including tents and generators, valued at $5 million. All told, 
foreign governments and citizens of foreign countries sent hundreds of millions of dollars 
of aid to support the victims of Hurricane Katrina; contributions like these are transfers 
from abroad.
Income-Based Payments to Foreigners  There are also similar types of financial 
flows that move in the opposite direction. We now list all of the sources of income-based 
payments to foreigners:
	
1.	 Making payments to foreigners in return for their goods and services—imports
	
2.	 Paying income on assets that foreign residents own in the domestic economy—
factor payments to foreigners
	
3.	 Making transfers to individuals who reside abroad or to foreign governments—
transfers to foreigners
Imports are the goods and services that foreigners produce and then sell to domestic 
­residents. Factor payments to foreigners represent the payments made to foreigners who 
own assets in the domestic economy. Transfers to foreigners are “gifts,” which include 
foreign aid from the U.S. government, donations from U.S. citizens to foreign charitable 
organizations, and remittances from legal and illegal residents of the United States. For

example, a Mexican citizen who permanently resides in the United States and periodi-
cally transfers money back to family members in Mexico is making a transfer to foreign-
ers. In this case, the transfer is just the money that is sent to family members in Mexico, 
and not the total earnings that the Mexican citizen receives for work that she does in the 
United States.
The Workings of the Current Account  
and the Financial Account
The current account adds together these different sources of payments into and out of 
a country. It consists of the sum of net exports, net factor payments from abroad, and net 
transfers from abroad.
Net exports = (Payments from abroad for exports)  
− (Payments to foreigners for imports)
Net factor payments from abroad = (Factor payments from abroad)  
− (Factor payments to foreigners)
Net transfers from abroad = (Transfers from abroad) − (Transfers to foreigners)
The current account is the net flow of payments made to domestic residents from foreign 
residents.
Current Account = (Net exports) + (Net factor payments from abroad)  
+ (Net transfers from abroad).
It is important to bear in mind that any of these net flows could be negative, which 
would correspond to a net flow of payments to foreign residents. In fact, in 2013, the 
United States did run a current account deficit of $379 billion. In other words, U.S. resi-
dents paid foreigners $379 billion more than foreigners paid U.S. residents.
Exhibit 28.7 breaks down the current account deficit for the United States in 2013 into 
its three components. The current account is shown in the top box. We’ll discuss the bottom 
box—the financial account—a bit later. Focusing on the top box, we can see that trade in 
goods and services led to net payments of $475 billion to foreigners. Factor payments led 
to net payments of $229 billion from foreigners to U.S. residents. Finally, net transfer pay-
ments led to net payments to foreigners of $133 billion. Adding these up, and remembering 
to use a negative sign when net payments are made to foreigners, we come up with a total 
current account deficit of $379 billion.

What are the consequences of running a current account deficit? When U.S. residents 
make $379 billion of net payments to foreigners, the payments are made in U.S. dollars. 
These dollars enable the foreign residents to buy U.S. assets, which can be exchanged for 
U.S. goods and services at some point in the future.
To understand what this means in practice, consider a simple current account transaction 
that we illustrate in Exhibit 28.8. Suppose a U.S. consumer decides to buy a Chinese lap-
top that costs $1,000. In effect, the U.S. consumer gives the Chinese laptop manufacturer 
$1,000. In the U.S. current account, this amount would show up as a $1,000 payment to 
foreigners. Exhibit 28.8 illustrates this current account transaction by showing the pur-
chase of the $1,000 laptop.
Now suppose that there is no offsetting transaction in which China buys goods and ser-
vices from the United States, so the $1,000 payment can be thought of as a current account 
deficit. Instead of importing $1,000 of goods and services from the United States, China 
saves the $1,000, thereby preserving that purchasing power for future purchases of goods 
and services. For example, the Chinese company could use the $1,000 to buy a specific 
U.S. asset from U.S. residents, for instance a U.S. Treasury bond. This is the case depicted 
in the circular flow of Exhibit 28.8.
Let’s summarize the flows in Exhibit 28.8. At the end of the international transactions 
depicted here, the United States has one new laptop and owns one less Treasury bond. In the 
current account, the U.S. has imported goods worth $1,000. In the financial account, the 
U.S. has transferred to China a Treasury bond worth $1,000. The financial account is defined 
as the increase in domestic assets held by foreigners minus the increase in foreign assets held 
domestically. The financial account is just the accounting system that records the asset pur-
chases that domestic residents and foreigners make. The financial account is defined so that 
the net flows in the financial account offset the net flows in the current account. (To keep the 
analysis simple, we have omitted a few other details in the accounting rules.)
The following two equations give the definition of the financial account and describe its 
relationship with the current account:
Financial account = (Increase in domestic assets held by foreigners)  
− (Increase in foreign assets held domestically).
(Current account) + (Financial account) = 0.
When foreigners receive net payments in the current account, they can buy any type of 
U.S. asset in the financial account. In the example that we already discussed, they bought 
U.S. Treasury bonds. But they could also just hold the payment in dollars (in a bank ac-
count) as a claim against the United States. In either case, the current account deficit is 
exactly offset by a financial account surplus.
The financial account is the 
increase in domestic assets held 
by foreigners minus the increase in 
foreign assets held domestically.

Now we are ready to reconsider Exhibit 28.7, which shows the current account for the 
United States in 2013. As required by the accounting identities, the financial account per-
fectly offsets the current account. In 2013, foreigners received $379 billion in net payments 
in the current account, corresponding to a current account deficit. In return, the finan-
cial account indicates that U.S. residents gave foreigners $379 billion in assets (including 
­dollar-denominated deposits).
This isn’t necessarily bad news for U.S. residents. It was a trade. Residents of the United 
States got Sony TV sets, Louis Vuitton handbags, BMWs, and hundreds of thousands of 
other imported goods and services. Foreigners obtained bank deposits and other assets 
worth $379 billion from residents of the United States.
When a country runs a current account deficit, it is analogous to what takes place when 
a single household spends more than it earns. To fund this extra spending, the household 
either borrows or spends down assets that had previously been accumulated. For example, 
suppose you spend $1,000 more than you earn from all sources, including labor income, 
asset income, and transfers. If you already have some assets in the bank, say $3,000 in your 
checking account, you could finance the extra $1,000 of consumption by running down 
those assets so that at the end of the year you would have only $2,000 left in your checking 
account. Or if you do not have such assets to spend down, you could borrow. If you start 
without any assets and without any debt, you would borrow $1,000, so your net asset posi-
tion would become −$1,000. Notice that regardless of what your asset position was at the 
beginning, you are financing your $1,000 shortfall by reducing 
your asset position by $1,000—either from $3,000 to $2,000 or 
from zero to −$1,000.
The situation is identical for a country, which must also finance 
its net exports by running down its assets or borrowing. This fact 
highlights a central concept in international accounting: just like 
an individual household, an entire country can only spend more 
than it earns if it finds a way to fund the extra spending. The coun-
try must either sell assets to foreigners or borrow from foreigners. 
Hence, current account deficits must match financial account flows. In other words, when a 
country makes net purchases of goods and services from foreigners, the country must make 
net asset sales to foreigners to pay the bill.
Just like an individual household, an 
entire country can only spend more 
than it earns if it finds a way to fund 
the extra spending.
International Trade, Technology 
Transfer, and Economic Growth
International trade benefits countries not just through specialization and comparative ad-
vantage. It is also a conduit for the transfer of technology from more advanced to less 
advanced economies, thus contributing to an increase in the recipient’s productive capacity 
(recall the discussion in Chapter 20 on the importance of technology for productivity and 
living standards).
The interplay between international trade and technology transfer is illustrated by 
­China’s economic development. When the founding father of Communist China, Mao 
­Zedong, died in 1976, Chinese PPP-adjusted GDP per capita was $882 in 2005 dollars. 
Under Mao, China was organized as a planned economy, so state officials decided how 
to allocate ­almost all economic resources. Free markets were banned, international travel 
was forbidden, international trade was very low by comparison to most other countries, 
and citizens could not own land or businesses. The Chinese state owned all of the im-
portant types of physical capital. From an economic perspective, human capital was also 
controlled by the Chinese government, because people could not choose where to work 
and did not receive wages that were commensurate with their value added. The economic 
consequences of these policies were disastrous, leading to mass starvation under Mao’s 
leadership. Approximately 30 million people died from malnutrition during the Great 
­Famine of 1958–1961.

In 1978, two years after Mao’s death, Deng Xiaoping became the next powerful leader of 
China. Under Deng, China began to liberalize the economy, including opening the country 
to international trade. Exhibit 28.9 plots Chinese imports and exports as shares of GDP since 
1970. Under Mao’s leadership in the early 1970s, exports represented less than 5 percent of 
GDP. Over the last 10 years, the export share of the Chinese economy has averaged over 
30 percent. Chinese growth over the last 20 years has often been described as “export-led 
growth.”
China achieved an average annual growth rate of real GDP per capita of 6.6 percent 
between 1979 and 2012. At this pace, Chinese real GDP per capita has doubled approxi-
mately once every 11 years, implying more than three doublings since 1979. Consequently, 
Chinese real GDP per capita has increased by more than a factor of 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 since 
1979! By comparison, it takes about 40 years for U.S. real GDP per capita to double.
China’s spectacular growth is largely due to the shift from central planning—in 
other words, state control of the economy—towards a market economy. Opening to 
trade in goods and services was just one part of that transition. Farmers and family 
businesses were allowed to make their own decisions, own private property, and keep 
the profits from their economic activity. State-owned industries were privatized and 
China, which previously banned all kinds of foreign capital inflows, became a major 
destination for foreign investment. Along the way, China improved its technology 
greatly, enabling its citizens to work in modern factories, which now export to markets 
around the world.
Foreign direct investment refers to investments by foreign 
individuals and companies in domestic firms and businesses. To 
qualify as foreign direct investment, this capital flow must gen-
erate a large ownership stake in a local firm for the foreign in-
vestors. For example, foreign direct investment in China occurs 
when a foreign company opens a factory in China. It would also 
count as foreign direct investment if the Chinese factory were 
jointly owned by the foreign company and some local Chinese

investors or a local Chinese company. China receives more foreign direct investment than 
any other country in the world.
Foreign direct investment is a major conduit for technology transfer, though in most 
cases this transfer is not the goal of the foreign firm that is making the investment. When 
a UK company becomes part of a joint venture or opens a factory in China, it brings 
its know-how and technology to the country. This type of technology transfer enables 
recipient countries to improve their productivity.
Technology transfer creates one more type of cross-country interdependence. Countries 
are not only trading goods and services and having their firms and banks borrow from and 
lend to each other but they are also technologically interlinked. Innovations and techno-
logical improvements in one country will ultimately improve productivity in all countries. 
Moreover, the more interaction there is between these countries, in particular through for-
eign direct investment, the faster these improvements will migrate from one to the other. 
Such transfers are particularly beneficial for countries that start out technologically less 
advanced, as China did in the late 1970s.
In 1980, almost no families had a computer at home. Per-
sonal computers did exist, but they were expensive, hard 
to use, and were primarily used by technology hobbyists 
and science geeks. The internet did not exist. The kind 
of entertainment one could get from a computer was a 
game like Pong. The game of Tetris wouldn’t even be in-
vented until 1984.
Between 1980 and 1990, the personal computer 
reached the mainstream, thanks to gradually improving 
technology as well as successful marketing. The big bang 
was the introduction of the IBM-PC (model 5150) in 1981. 
This computer was so successful that it quickly became the 
industry standard. By the mid-1990s, no self-respecting 
college student in the developed world still wrote term 
papers on a typewriter.
The first generation of IBM-PCs was manufactured with 
mostly U.S. parts and assembled in a U.S. plant. However, 
even the first IBM-PC had a Japanese monitor. Over time, 
foreign components came to dominate the business. 
Mass production of hard disks began in Japan and Korea 
in the 1980s. Eventually, almost all of the key components 
of the personal computer were manufactured outside 
of the United States. Eventually, the final assembly also 
shifted to foreign factories.
Today, IBM is completely out of the business of man-
ufacturing and selling personal computers. The end of 
IBM’s involvement occurred in 2005, when IBM sold its 
successful laptop business to Lenovo, its Chinese manu-
facturing partner. So what did IBM do after abandoning its 
old line of business? IBM did very well by recognizing that 
its highly skilled U.S. labor force had higher value added—
that is, a comparative advantage—in providing consult-
ing services rather than in manufacturing machines that 
low-wage workers could assemble. Today, IBM remains a 
highly profitable company. Each year it sells proximately 
$100 billion in consulting and technical services to compa-
nies around the world. It has over 400,000 employees, and 
the company is worth approximately $200 billion.

orking on a Vietnamese farm is tough. Wages are very low—­approximately 
$1–$3 per day for unskilled labor.5 And the working conditions are miserable. 
The physical labor on a Vietnamese farm is grueling and injuries are common. 
Benefits like health insurance or pension plans don’t exist in the agricultural sector. If you 
are injured on the job and can’t work the next day, you don’t get paid. Some children work 
in the agricultural sector ­because their families can’t afford to send them to school and need 
the meager income that the children can earn.
Unskilled workers in the factories that manufacture Nike products earn little more than 
the Vietnamese minimum wage, which is $4–$5 per day depending on the location of the 
factory.6 But this is greater than the wage they would earn in the largely unregulated agri-
cultural sector. Some of the factory workers also have free 
access to rudimentary health clinics. But working conditions 
are terrible—cramped, noisy, hot rooms, filled with danger-
ous chemicals. As in the agricultural sector, the factories 
offer no job security. Sick or injured employees lose their 
jobs and do not receive unemployment benefits. Working in 
a factory that makes Nike shoes is a nightmare by the stan-
dards of workers in the developed world.
Defenders of free markets emphasize the gains from 
international trade. At the moment, many Vietnamese 
workers, with limited human capital and limited access to 
modern technology, have a comparative advantage in as-
sembly jobs—like work in sneaker and clothing factories. 
Preventing them from working in these jobs reduces their 
income. Defenders of free trade point to the agricultural 
sector and say that Nike is doing a good thing by giving 
agricultural workers an alternative job that increases their pay. The factory job provides 
reliable income and therefore does not depend on the timing of seasonal rains or whether 
the harvest happens to be good or bad. Famines occur when agricultural production fails, 
often because of a long stretch of bad weather. Famines generally don’t occur in factory 
towns. Finally, when Nike’s subcontractors use foreign direct investment to build new 
sneaker factories, this facilitates the transfer of new technology to Vietnam.
On the other hand, critics of the factory sweatshops point out that the factory jobs don’t 
even measure up to the jobs that the worst-off workers hold in developed countries. A low-
wage worker in the United States earns over $50 per day. An unskilled factory worker in 
Vietnam earns less than a tenth of that wage. The Vietnam factory wouldn’t even come 
close to passing a U.S. safety inspection. Moreover, many of the factory workers are under-
age, just like the workers in the agricultural sector.
Almost everyone agrees with these facts. But there is a great deal of disagreement about 
what should be done. Is it possible for Nike to continue to buy shoes from suppliers in 
Vietnam but require those suppliers to pay higher wages?
Suppose that U.S. consumers boycotted Nike’s products because of the work arrange-
ments at the factories that supply Nike with sneakers. The protestors would like Nike’s 
subcontractors to pay the factory workers more and to improve working conditions in those 
factories. In principle, such improvements could be implemented without necessitating a 
very large increase in Nike’s sneaker prices.
Would there be unintended negative consequences if Nike paid its subcontractors more 
and forced them to pass these extra funds on to the workers? Perhaps Nike would lose

business because of the need to (modestly) raise its sneaker prices. If Nike does lose some 
customers, Nike might end up reducing its sneaker purchases from the Vietnamese subcon-
tractors, leading some of its suppliers to shut down. In this case, some of the workers that 
the U.S. protestors were trying to help might actually be hurt. Perhaps Nike would improve 
conditions at the existing factories in Vietnam, but the subcontractors would stop building 
new factories in Vietnam, thereby preventing other agricultural workers from transitioning 
to the relatively well-paid manufacturing sector. Consumers in the United States would 
like to see the lives of Vietnamese families improve, but it’s not clear what would happen 
if Nike and its subcontractors were forced to raise the wages of workers in ­Vietnamese 
sneaker factories.
Though it is not clear what would happen if Nike were forced to pay its Vietnamese 
workers more, it is clear that globalization in general has been an enormous force for good 
in ­Vietnam. Like Deng Xiaoping, who initiated market and trade reforms in China after 
decades of strict central planning, Nguyen Van Linh pursued a similar policy in Vietnam 
starting in 1988 (two years after he came to power). As a result of these Vietnamese re-
forms, trade rapidly expanded, with exports rising from 10 percent of GDP to 75 percent 
of GDP today. Since the reforms were passed, real GDP per capita has grown at a rate of 
5.5 percent (1988–2013), more than a doubling from the pre-reform growth rate.7 Poverty 
has fallen precipitously if it is measured with the poverty line of one (U.S.) dollar per day. 
In 1993, nearly 60 percent of the Vietnamese population fell below that standard of living, 
but by 2006 (the most recent data available) “only” 16 percent of the population consumed 
less than a dollar-per-day.8
Economists believe that sustained growth is one of the key factors that reduces child 
­labor. Exhibit 28.10 shows that there is a strong negative correlation between child labor 
and GDP per capita: fewer children are forced to, or choose to, work in countries with 
higher GDP per capita. Consistent with Exhibit 28.10, rising levels of income in Vietnam 
have coincided with a sharp fall in child labor, and much of the decline in child labor is 
credited to Vietnam’s opening to trade.9

Relationship Between GDP 
per Capita and Child Labor 
(the Fraction of Children 
Ages 7–14 Who Are 
Working)
There is a strong ­negative re-
lationship between GDP per 
capita and child labor, which is 
measured as the ­percentage 
of children between the ages 
of 7 and 14 who are working.

Caveat
The Vietnamese workers that 
make Nike’s sneakers are 
paid extremely low wages 
and work in conditions that 
are unsafe by the standards 
of ­developed countries. 
­However, the next best 
­alternative for many of the 
workers that produce Nike’s 
sneakers, which is work in the 
­agricultural sector, appears to 
be even worse.
Agricultural and factory wages 
in Vietnam, as well as data on 
trade, growth, poverty, and 
child labor-force participation.
Nike could improve the 
­quality of life of the workers 
who manufacture its products 
if it forced its subcontractors 
to raise the workers’ wages.
Are companies like Nike 
harming workers in the 
­developing world?
Summary
The process of globalization has produced a highly interconnected world.
International trade enables us to exploit specialization and comparative 
advantage. Comparative advantage arises when a person or country has a lower 
opportunity cost of production than another person or country.
Some individuals are made worse off by international trade, especially ­low-
skilled workers in developed countries who lose their jobs to foreign producers. 
However, globalization and international trade improve the well-being of most people.
A country runs a current account deficit when it has a negative sum of net 
exports, net payments from abroad for factor payments, and net transfers from 
abroad. When this happens, the country must have a financial account surplus, as 
there needs to be a corresponding flow of funds that pays for the current account 
deficit. This implies a net increase in domestic assets held by foreigners and/or a 
net decrease in foreign assets held by domestic residents.
A rapid process of globalization has been underway for several decades, increas-
ing the total volume of international trade. Consequently, consumers and workers 
around the world can better take advantage of the gains from international trade.
Globalization also makes the enormous inequities across nations more 
visible. We purchase goods and services produced and assembled by workers, 
sometimes even children, earning a small fraction of the wages of workers in 
developed economies. The conditions in factories in the developing world are 
far worse than the working conditions in developed countries. Nevertheless, 
globalization usually improves the well-being of most of the low-paid factory 
workers in foreign countries. Their alternative opportunities for employment are 
usually worse than these factory jobs in the traded goods sector.

	 5.	 David Ricardo, the British political economist, used 
the example of two commodities—wine and cloth—­
produced by England and Portugal to explain trade. The

	 Portugal can produce both wine and cloth using fewer 
labor hours than England. A group of Mercantilists, 
who believe that nations build their wealth by exporting 
more than they import, suggest that Portugal has noth-

­Explain your answer.
	 6.	 Tire production in the United States has been on the de-
cline, in both absolute and relative terms. Imported tires 
are replacing most of the domestically manufactured 
tires in the market. Trade unions in the United States 
have claimed that over 7,000 jobs have been lost due to 
Chinese tire imports. You read a blog post that uses this 
example to say that this is exactly why countries should 
not engage in free trade; cheaper imports will flood the 
domestic market and unemployment in the country will 
increase. Do you think the blogger’s conclusions are 
­entirely correct? Explain.
	 7.	 Suppose that there are two countries, X and Y, both of 
which have experienced trade deficits for a few years. 
To finance trade deficits, the countries have to borrow 
foreign funds, but their fund uses are quite different 
from each other. Country X spends most of the bor-
rowed funds for consumption while country Y invests 
the borrowed funds. Given this information, suggest 
one possible benefit and cost of trade deficit for the two 
countries.
	 8.	 Suppose the following table shows data on transactions 
between the United States and the rest of the world for 
the month of May 2013. Assuming the list is exhaustive, 
use the information given to fill in the table showing the 
current and financial accounts for May 2013.

	10.	 Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, many poor countries 
pursued a policy called “import-substituting industrializa-
tion,” or ISI for short. India, and many nations in Africa 
and Latin America, closed themselves off to trade in order 
to promote the development of domestic industries.

As noted in the Economist article “Grinding the Poor” 
(September 27, 2001), “[o]n the whole, ISI failed; almost 
everywhere, trade has been good for growth.” The article 
discusses how growth was disappointing in countries that 
pursued ISI. Nations that were open to trade—primarily 
in Asia—grew much more rapidly.
Based on the discussion in the chapter, speculate on 
why ISI was ultimately a failure and why integration 
with the global economy promotes economic growth and 
development.
	11.	 Foreign direct investment (FDI) in several sectors in India 
is still heavily regulated. After much debate, the govern-
ment of India recently relaxed restrictions on FDI in the 
retail sector. For purported reasons like national security 
and possible job losses, many sectors of the economy such 
as defense, nuclear power, and oil refining are not fully 
open to foreign direct investment. Suppose you are hired 
to serve on the government’s Working Group on Foreign 
Direct Investment. What would you suggest to the govern-
ment? Defend your position.
	12.	 The coffee market is one of the most globalized and vola-
tile commodity markets in existence. In terms of the value 
of trade, it is second only to oil. Coffee is produced in 
over seventy countries, primarily lower-income nations 
in Latin American, Africa, and Asia. In recent years, a 
movement has developed supporting “fair trade coffee,” 
which seeks to better the conditions and increase the in-
comes of coffee producers in poor countries.
Read the following online sources and list the main 
arguments for and against the fair trade coffee movement, 
as delineated in the articles. Comment on any similarities

George Soros, one of the world’s most 
renowned investors, challenged the 
central bank of ­England in the summer 
of 1992. In essence, he bet everything 
he had that the British currency, the pound, 
would lose value relative to other currencies. 
Starting in ­September, the pound plummeted in 
value. Soros made approximately $1 billion of profits 
for himself and his investors. How did Soros know that

KEY IDEAS
The nominal exchange rate is the rate at which one country’s currency 
can be exchanged for the currency of another country.
In a flexible exchange rate system, the nominal exchange rate is 
determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market.
Fixed or managed exchange rates are controlled by the government.
The real exchange rate is the ratio of the prices (for example, all 
converted to dollars) of a basket of goods and services in two countries 
and thus influences net exports from one country to the other.
A decline in net exports reduces labor demand and GDP and might 
cause unemployment.
In the previous chapter, we saw that economies around the world are linked through trade 
and investment. For example, the United States imported about $456 billion of goods and 
services from China in 2013. But how does this trade take place? After all, almost all trans-
actions in the United States are in U.S. dollars, while most transactions in China are in the 
Chinese currency, the yuan, also called the renminbi.
Many countries have their own currencies for use in economic transactions: the United 
Kingdom has the pound, Japan the yen, Mexico the peso, and India the rupee, among oth-
ers. An exception to the use of a national currency is the euro, a currency used by twenty-
four European countries (as of January 1, 2015). The euro, first introduced in 1999, is the 
second-most-traded currency after the U.S. dollar.
Nominal Exchange Rates
Walmart sells toys imported from China. How does Walmart decide whether to purchase 
the toys from China rather than purchasing similar toys from some U.S. toy manufacturer?
To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of the nominal exchange 
rate. The nominal exchange rate is the price of one country’s currency in units of another 
country’s currency. Specifically, the nominal exchange rate is the number of units of for-
eign currency that can be purchased with one unit of domestic currency. Sometimes you’ll 
see the nominal exchange rate, referred to simply as the “exchange rate” (which is what we 
did in Chapter 20). In the current chapter, we often use the full name, nominal exchange 
rate, to distinguish the nominal exchange rate from another type of exchange rate that we 
will discuss later in the chapter.
In the following equation, the nominal exchange rate is represented by the symbol e:
 e =
Units of foreign currency
1 Unit of domestic currency.
For instance, if the yuan-dollar exchange rate is 6.05 yuan per dollar, then a person holding 
1 dollar can exchange the dollar for 6.05 yuan.
 e = 6.05 Yuan per dollar = 6.05 Yuan
1 Dollar .

The nominal exchange rate is the 
rate at which one currency can be 
traded for another.

Chapter 29  |  Open Economy Macroeconomics
29.1
The higher the value of e, the more units of foreign 
currency a dollar buys. When a nominal exchange rate 
goes up, we say that the domestic currency is appre-
ciating against the foreign currency. When a nominal 
exchange rate goes down, we say that the domestic 
currency is depreciating against the foreign currency.
We can also use the yuan-dollar exchange rate to 
calculate the value of 1 yuan in terms of dollars. When 
the yuan-dollar exchange rate is e, the number of units 
of dollars that can be purchased with 1 yuan is 1/e. Put 
differently, 1 yuan is worth 1/e = 1/6.05 = 0.17 dollars.
Notice that the appreciation of a currency—a rise in 
e—always has a flip side. When the dollar appreciates 
against the yuan, implying that e is rising, the yuan is de-
preciating against the dollar, implying that 1/e is falling.
Exhibit 29.1 shows e and 1/e for some key curren-
cies on January 2, 2014. The above discussion and 
Exhibit 29.1 clarify that both e (yuan per dollar) and 
1/e (dollars per yuan) convey the same information. In 
newspapers, you will see exchange rates sometimes expressed as yuan per dollar or euros per 
dollar and at other times as dollars per yuan or dollars per euro. In this chapter, to avoid confu-
sion, we will stick to the definition above of the exchange rate, e, expressing it as the number 
of units of foreign currency that can be purchased by one unit of domestic currency, such as 
yuan per dollar or euros per dollar.
Now let’s return to Walmart’s sourcing decision—should Walmart purchase toys from a 
Chinese or a U.S. manufacturer? Walmart needs to decide whether a toy sold by a Chinese 
manufacturer at a unit price of 20 yuan is less expensive than an identical toy sold by a 
competing U.S. manufacturer at a unit price of $5 (we are ignoring transportation costs for 
simplicity). To implement this comparison, Walmart makes the yuan and dollar prices com-
parable by using the nominal exchange rate. For example, on January 2, 2014, the yuan-
dollar exchange rate was 6.05, so the dollar price of the Chinese-manufactured toy was
  Dollar cost = Yuan cost * Dollars
Yuan
  = Yuan cost * 1
e
  = 20 *
1
6.05
  = $3.31.
As you can see, the dollar price of the Chinese-manufactured toy is just over $3, which is 
less than the $5 price of the U.S.-manufactured toy, so it is less expensive to purchase the 
toy from the Chinese manufacturer.
Flexible, Managed, and Fixed Exchange Rates
Exhibit 29.2 shows historical movements in two nominal exchange rates: the yuan-dollar and 
the euro-dollar nominal exchange rates. Both nominal exchange rates vary over time. How-
ever, the yuan-dollar exchange rate has had long periods in which it doesn’t move, followed

by short periods in which it mostly moves down. For example, the yuan-dollar exchange 
rate was constant—8.28 yuan per dollar—from late 1998 to 2005. Likewise, the yuan-dollar 
exchange rate was nearly constant at 6.82 yuan per dollar between mid-2008 and mid-2010.
The euro-dollar exchange rate fluctuates much more than the yuan-dollar exchange rate 
because the euro-dollar exchange rate is determined with little or no government interven-
tion. Each day the exchange rate moves up and down as market forces change. This is 
referred to as a flexible exchange rate, or a floating exchange rate.
On the other hand, a government could fix a value for the exchange rate and intervene to 
maintain that value. In this case, the country has a fixed exchange rate.
There is also a middle case. The yuan-dollar exchange rate is not flexible or fixed but is in-
stead a managed exchange rate: the Chinese government influences its movement. Managed 
exchange rates change, but those movements tend to be relatively smooth. For example, the 
Chinese government has allowed the yuan to slowly appreciate against the dollar since 2005.
We’ll explain why a country might adopt a managed or a fixed exchange rate later in the 
chapter. For now, we only note that there are many reasons, among them the belief that managed 
or fixed exchange rates provide more economic stability and might facilitate international trade.

The Foreign Exchange Market
The foreign exchange market is the global financial market in which currencies are traded 
and nominal exchange rates are determined. To illustrate the role of this market, suppose Air 
China would like to add five Boeing Dreamliners, each costing $200 million, to its aircraft fleet. 
To do this, it needs to pay the Boeing Company in dollars. So Air China will go to the foreign 
exchange market to buy (demand) a total of $1 billion (= 5 × $200 million), offering yuan in 
29.2 
If the government does not 
intervene in the foreign exchange 
market, then the country has a 
flexible exchange rate, which 
is also referred to as a floating 
exchange rate.
If the government fixes a value for 
the exchange rate and intervenes to 
maintain that value, then the country 
has a fixed exchange rate.  
If the government intervenes 
actively to influence the exchange 
rate, then the country has a 
managed exchange rate.
The foreign exchange market is 
the global financial market in which 
currencies are traded and nominal 
exchange rates are determined.

return. Because the yuan-dollar exchange rate is e = 6.05, 
this means Air China will be paying 6.05 billion yuan in 
exchange of dollars.
As with other markets, the supply and demand curves 
determine the equilibrium price, which is the equilib-
rium exchange rate in the foreign exchange market. 
­Exhibit 29.3 illustrates the supply and demand curves in 
the foreign exchange market. The horizontal axis repre-
sents the quantity of dollars available for transactions in 
the foreign exchange market. We’ll use the yuan-dollar 
exchange rate on the vertical axis to represent the value 
or “price” of a dollar: how many yuan a dollar will buy. 
Recall that we are expressing the nominal exchange 
rate as units of foreign currency per U.S. dollar.
In panel (a) of Exhibit 29.3, the dollar demand curve 
represents the relationship between the quantity of dol-
lars demanded and the exchange rate. The demand curve represents traders who are trying to 
buy dollars in the foreign exchange market with yuan. So, Air China’s demand for dollars is 
reflected in this demand curve. Of course, millions of other economic agents will also be trying 
to obtain dollars by selling yuan. All of these agents make up the dollar demand curve.
To understand why the demand curve for dollars in exchange for yuan is downward-­
sloping, consider an appreciation of the dollar—in other words, a depreciation of the yuan. 
A dollar appreciation would move the exchange rate from A to B in panel (a) of Exhibit 29.3. 
The dollar appreciation implies that each dollar buys more yuan, that each yuan buys fewer 
dollars, and that the price of each Boeing aircraft is now greater in yuan. The Chinese air-
line’s revenues are paid (largely) in yuan, so the relevant price for Air China is the price of 
the Boeing Dreamliner in yuan. The higher yuan-denominated price for the Dreamliner leads 
Air China to reduce the quantity of Dreamliners demanded. This implies that the quantity of 
Boeing’s Dreamliner costs $200 million per plane. If a Chinese airline 
tries to buy one, it will need to exchange (e × $200 ­million) on the 
foreign exchange market to obtain $200 million. At an exchange 
rate of e = 6.05 yuan per dollar, that amounts to 1,210 million yuan.
Exhibit 29.3 The Foreign Exchange Market under a Flexible Exchange Rate Regime
The demand for dollars in exchange for yuan in panel (a) is downward-sloping because a 
­dollar ­appreciation (a movement from A to B) increases the price of U.S. goods faced by 
­Chinese firms and consumers, reducing the quantity of goods they demand and thereby 
reducing the quantity of dollars they demand. The supply of dollars in exchange for yuan 
in panel (b) is upward-sloping because a dollar appreciation (a movement from A to B) 
increases the quantity of goods purchased by U.S. buyers from Chinese producers, thus 
raising the dollar earnings of Chinese producers and the quantity of dollars that they sup-
ply to the foreign exchange market. The intersection of the demand and ­supply curves in 
panel (c) gives the equilibrium exchange rate in a flexible exchange rate regime.

dollars demanded will fall—with fewer aircraft demanded, fewer dollars will be demanded. 
We’ve just shown how an appreciation of the dollar leads to a ­reduction in the quantity of 
dollars demanded. Examples like this imply that the demand curve is downward-sloping, as 
shown in the exhibit.
The dollar supply curve, shown in panel (b) of Exhibit 29.3, represents the relationship 
between the quantity of dollars supplied and the exchange rate. Traders who are trying to 
obtain yuan by selling dollars are represented by this dollar supply curve. For example, 
Chinese manufacturers that export their products are often paid in dollars and they need 
to exchange these dollars into yuan so they can pay their workers and suppliers. All of the 
millions of households and firms supplying dollars in exchange for yuan make up the dollar 
supply curve.
The reason that the supply curve (for dollars in exchange for yuan) slopes up is related to 
the reason that the demand curve (for dollars in exchange for yuan) slopes down. When the 
dollar appreciates (yuan depreciates) and we move from exchange rate A to exchange rate 
B, each dollar buys more yuan. This implies that the prices of all Chinese products, such as 
the toys produced by Chinese manufacturers, become less expensive in U.S. dollars—recall 
that when we draw supply (or demand) curves, we are holding constant all other prices, 
such as the yuan-denominated price of toys manufactured in China. Because an apprecia-
tion of the dollar enables U.S. consumers to pay fewer dollars for each good they import 
from China, U.S. consumers and companies increase their purchases of Chinese goods. 
This implies greater dollar revenues for Chinese firms, and thus a greater quantity of dollars 
supplied by them to the foreign exchange market. To sum up, a rising yuan-dollar exchange 
rate leads to a greater quantity of dollars supplied, so the supply curve is upward-sloping.
The equilibrium exchange rate under a flexible exchange rate regime is given by the for-
eign exchange equilibrium, which corresponds to the exchange rate that equates the quan-
tity supplied and the quantity demanded. This intersection of the supply and demand curves 
is shown in panel (c) of Exhibit 29.3 at quantity q* and price (yuan-dollar ­exchange rate) 
e*. As we have already noted, the yuan-dollar exchange rate is not flexible but ­managed, so 
panel (c) shows what the yuan-dollar exchange rate would be if there were no Chinese gov-
ernment intervention. In fact, the Chinese government has been slowly reducing the scope 
of its foreign exchange market interventions, leading the yuan-dollar market to move closer 
to the situation that would arise under a flexible exchange rate regime like that in panel (c).
What happens to the equilibrium exchange rate if Air China unexpectedly faces a higher 
demand for air travel in China? Air China would need more aircraft. For example, its 
­demand curve for aircraft would shift so that, at unchanged prices, it would now demand 
10 Dreamliners instead of 5. In this case, again keeping prices including the exchange rate 
fixed, Air China’s demand for dollars would increase by 5 × $200 million = $1 billion. In 
terms of Exhibit 29.3, this corresponds to a $1 billion rightward shift of the dollar demand 
curve, as illustrated in Exhibit 29.4.

Under a flexible exchange rate, the rightward shift in the dollar demand curve causes 
the equilibrium yuan-dollar exchange rate to increase, implying that a dollar will now buy 
more yuan. Using the terminology we introduced earlier we can see that, with flexible 
exchange rates, in response to the increased demand for Boeing aircraft, the dollar would 
appreciate against the yuan or, equivalently, the yuan would depreciate against the dollar.
How Do Governments Intervene  
in the Foreign Exchange Market?
How does equilibrium work when an exchange rate is not flexible? If a government ­attempts 
to control the value of its exchange rate through a managed or fixed exchange rate system, 
we say that the exchange rate is being “pegged” by the government.
Though this may no longer be the case, Chinese authorities have historically chosen an 
exchange rate that makes the yuan substantially undervalued relative to the dollar. By impli-
cation this means that the dollar is somewhat overvalued relative to the yuan. Exhibit 29.5 
illustrates the yuan-dollar foreign exchange market and reveals what it means for the yuan 
to be undervalued and the dollar to be overvalued. The exchange rate is pegged at the level 
shown by the solid purple line. The dollar is overvalued because the dollar is worth more 
yuan than it would have been under a flexible exchange rate regime. The flexible equilib-
rium is still represented by e*. The pegged exchange rate is above the market-clearing price 
at the intersection of the supply and demand curves.
At the exchange rate corresponding to the peg, the quantity supplied exceeds the quan-
tity demanded. If the Chinese authorities simply announce the peg and do nothing else, 
the forces of supply and demand will lower the yuan-dollar exchange rate below the peg. 
Recall that the supply curve represents the quantity of dollars supplied to the yuan-dollar 
foreign exchange market at a particular yuan-dollar exchange rate. If that quantity sup-
plied exceeds the quantity demanded at a particular yuan-dollar exchange rate, there will 
be an excess supply of dollars, which will drive down the price of dollars. In other words, 
the price of dollars—the exchange rate—will fall, so the dollar will depreciate against 
the yuan. This process will lower the yuan-dollar exchange rate from the peg toward 
the market-clearing price at the intersection of the supply and 
demand curves.
This analysis shows that simply announcing a target exchange 
rate will have little or no effect on the exchange rate that will 
prevail in the foreign exchange market. Because the quantity of 
dollars supplied exceeds the quantity of dollars demanded at the 
pegged yuan-dollar exchange rate, Chinese authorities would 
need to soak up this excess supply by buying dollars and sell-
ing yuan. Exhibit 29.5 shows that to maintain the peg above the 
Simply announcing a target exchange 
rate will have little or no effect on 
the exchange rate that will prevail in 
the foreign exchange market.

That Overvalues the Dollar Relative to

To support an overvalued dollar (or 
equivalently an undervalued yuan), the 
Chinese government would need to soak 
up the excess supply of dollars by ­buying 
dollars in exchange for yuan. The ­quantity 
of dollars that must be purchased is given 
by the difference between the ­quantity 
of dollars supplied and the ­quantity 
of ­dollars demanded at the pegged 
­exchange rate.

market-clearing exchange rate—in other words, to keep the dollar overvalued—Chinese 
authorities would have to continuously purchase dollars and sell yuan.
In fact, this is exactly what they have been doing. Between 1990 and 2013, the Chinese 
central bank increased its holdings of foreign reserves from about $30 billion to more 
than $3,800 billion. Most of these reserves are in dollars, but the Chinese central bank has 
bought other currencies as well. The analysis in Exhibit 29.5 shows why dollar purchases 
were necessary, given the fact that the yuan has been pegged to the dollar at exchange rates 
that overvalued the dollar and therefore undervalued the yuan.
Later in this chapter we’ll explain why the Chinese government has gone to all this 
trouble: an overvalued dollar (undervalued yuan) increase the net exports of China.
Defending an Overvalued Exchange Rate
Exhibit 29.5 makes it look easy to defend a fixed exchange rate. The Chinese authorities 
bought dollars, building up their dollar reserves. In exchange, the Chinese authorities sup-
plied yuan. This was simple to achieve because a country with a national currency, like the 
Chinese yuan, has the right to print or electronically create as many units of that currency 
as it wants. So, at least in the short run, defending an undervalued yuan appears feasible. 
However, it is not as easy to defend an exchange rate when your currency is overvalued. 
In many cases, countries try to peg their exchange rate at a level that overvalues their 
own currency. To see why a country might do so, let’s consider the example of Mexico 
and analyze the peso-dollar exchange rate, with the convention that the exchange rate is 
measured in pesos per dollar. Why would the Mexican government want the peso to be 
overvalued and the dollar to be undervalued?
Most countries regularly borrow from foreign lenders. In developing countries like 
Mexico, these loans are typically denominated in dollars. So the Mexican borrowers re-
ceive dollars when they take out their loans and pay back dollars, not pesos, at the end of 
the loan period. To work through a numerical example, imagine that Mexican borrowers, 
including the Mexican government and Mexican companies, owe $1 billion to U.S. banks. 
If the peso-dollar exchange rate is 10, meaning that 10 pesos purchase one dollar, then 
Mexican borrowers need 10 billion pesos to pay back their dollar-denominated debts.
Now suppose that at the exchange rate of 10 pesos per dollar, the dollar is undervalued 
and that its market-clearing price under a flexible exchange rate regime would be 20 pesos 
per dollar instead. What would happen if the Mexican government allowed the underval-
ued dollar to appreciate, which is equivalent to allowing the overvalued peso to depreciate? 
This situation would have several implications, one of which is that Mexican borrowers 
would now need to give up 20 billion pesos instead of just 10 billion pesos to pay back their 
debts of $1 billion. Allowing the dollar to appreciate, and hence the peso to depreciate, has 
suddenly doubled the number of pesos that are needed to pay back the dollar-denominated 
debts of Mexican borrowers.
Having an overvalued peso also has other benefits for Mexico. An undervalued dollar—
hence, an overvalued peso—lowers the cost that Mexican consumers pay in pesos to import 
goods from the United States. Consequently, the Mexican government can keep prices and 
inflation low by keeping the dollar undervalued and the peso overvalued. For example, 
suppose that an iPhone costs $400 to import into Mexico. If the Mexican exchange rate is 
10 pesos per dollar, then the local cost will be 4,000 pesos. This is a lower iPhone price (in 
pesos) than if the peso-dollar exchange rate rises to 20 pesos per dollar. In that case, the 
local cost of the iPhone doubles to 8,000 pesos. Price increases like this raise the overall 
inflation rate in Mexico.
Another reason that countries maintain an overvalued exchange rate is because a fall 
in the value of a currency is often perceived as a failure of government policies. A cur-
rency that is depreciating (sometimes confusingly called a “weak currency”) is at times 
perceived to be a sign of a weak government or a weak country. This perception can be 
a problem for incumbent politicians in democratic countries. For this reason, officials at 
the U.S. Treasury Department frequently repeat the mantra that they support a “strong 
dollar policy.” The American public doesn’t like to hear politicians associate anything 
“weak” with the United States, including its currency. However, as we have learned, a 
“weak” currency is exactly what the non-democratic Chinese government has pursued 
for decades.

Whatever their motivations, many governments have intervened in the foreign exchange 
market to maintain an overvalued national currency. But overvaluation is also costly, as 
we will discuss below. In addition, overvalued currencies are much harder to defend than 
undervalued ones. Exhibit 29.6 plots the situation for an overvalued peso, which implies 
an ­undervalued dollar. Exhibit 29.6 is very similar to Exhibit 29.5, except that the solid 
purple line corresponding to the peg value is now below the market-clearing price, e*, at 
the intersection of the supply and demand curves (again marked with the dotted line in the 
exhibit). Thus the peso-dollar exchange rate is below what it would have been under a flex-
ible ­exchange rate regime, and in particular, the dollar is worth fewer pesos than it would 
be at the market-clearing price. Hence, the dollar is undervalued and the peso is overvalued.
Exhibit 29.6 illustrates how the Mexican authorities would in principle defend an over-
valued peso (and thus keep the dollar undervalued). This exhibit differs from Exhibit 29.5,  
where the quantity of dollars supplied exceeded the quantity of dollars demanded. In 
­Exhibit 29.6, the quantity of dollars supplied falls short of the quantity of dollars demanded. 
To maintain the peso-dollar exchange rate at the value corresponding to the peg, the Mexican 
authorities have to sell dollars and purchase pesos. The Mexican authorities can certainly 
do this if they have substantial dollar reserves. But how long can they keep up this policy?
In the situation depicted in Exhibit 29.5, the Chinese authorities can print or electroni-
cally create as many yuan as they want, so they could perpetually supply yuan to buy dollars 
if they wished. Likewise, Mexican authorities can create as many pesos as they want, but 
sustaining an overvalued peso relative to the dollar does not rely on the creation of more 
pesos. Instead, the Mexican authorities need to keep selling dollars to sustain an overvalued 
peso. Because they can’t create new dollars, the Mexican authorities have to use their pre-
existing dollar reserves, which are limited. If the quantity of dollars they need to supply 
exceeds their reserves, they won’t be able to sustain an overvalued peso. At the moment it 
becomes clear that their dollar reserves are going to run out, defending the overvalued peso 
becomes impossible. Whatever their public announcements, the ­Mexican authorities will 
then have to give up the peg and allow the peso to depreciate and the dollar to appreciate, 
which implies that the number of pesos per dollar—the peso-dollar exchange rate—will rise.
This discussion highlights the observation that overvalued 
exchange rates can be defended for a while—as long as the 
dollar reserves of the country defending the exchange rate last. 
But this scenario cannot continue indefinitely. If the peso-dollar 
exchange rate is too low relative to what supply and demand 
dictate—meaning that the dollar is undervalued and the peso 
is overvalued—there will continue to be an excess demand for 
­dollars, and this excess demand will keep draining the dollar re-
serves of the Mexican authorities who are trying to defend the 
overvalued peso.

To maintain an undervalued dollar, which

peso, the Mexican government needs 
to supply dollars to purchase pesos. The

the quantity of dollars demanded and

government tries to do.

Market pressure often pushes prices in financial markets, including exchange rates, back 
to their market-clearing levels, no matter what the government tries to do. In some cases, 
this pressure works gradually. In other cases, like the example we discuss in our Evidence-
Based Economics feature, the pressure ends up generating explosive fallout.
Some developing countries with fixed exchange rates 
announce an official exchange rate that overvalues their 
local currency and then ration who gets the privilege of 
exchanging the local currency for dollars at the overval-
ued exchange rate. In particular, the situation has some 
similarities to Exhibit 29.6, which depicts an undervalued 
dollar and, by implication, an overvalued foreign currency. 
As in Exhibit 29.6, at the official pegged exchange rate 
the supply of dollars falls short of the demand for dollars, 
but, with rationing, some of the demand for dollars will 
not be met by the government. The government will pick 
and choose who gets to sell the local currency at the price 
that undervalues dollars and overvalues the local currency. 
In cases like this, a black market—the name for the un-
derground market, in this case for dollars—comes into 
existence. A black market is part of the broader under-
ground economy, which includes all transactions that are 
hidden from the government. The exchange rate on the 
black market, which is determined by supply and demand, 
will be less favorable to sellers of local currency than the 
­official pegged exchange rate.
For instance, in Venezuela in 2009, the official ­exchange 
rate was 2.15 bolivares to the dollar, but the black mar-
ket exchange rate was roughly 5 bolivares to the dollar. 
Hence, a Venezuelan who wanted to sell 1,000 bolivares in 
exchange for dollars would get 1,000/2.15 = $465 at the 
official exchange rate, but only 1,000/5 = $200 at the black 
market exchange rate. As you can see in this case, every-
body with bolivares would have liked to purchase dollars 
at the more advantageous official rate. But the Venezuelan 
government did not allow this and simply refused to sell 
dollars at the official exchange rate to all Venezuelans who 
asked to buy dollars with bolivares. Those who are denied 
dollars have to either make do without the dollars or pay 
the much higher price for dollars on the black market—in 
this case the black market rate was more than twice as high.
To further complicate matters, many people who 
­receive dollars at the official exchange rate are likely to 
turn around and sell them at the much higher black mar-
ket rate. Such black market sales are illegal, but in most 
cases the black market transactions are prosecuted only 
if they are conducted by political enemies of the govern-
ment. Can you see who benefits from the system?
Not surprisingly, many governments maintain over-
valued exchange rates as a way of rewarding friends, 
cronies, and themselves. They can benefit directly from 
having access to the official and artificially cheap dollars. 
The system ultimately collapses, however, because it is 
inefficient. But while it lasts, politicians and their buddies 
make billions in profits.

Fixed Exchange Rates and Corruption
 
Evidence-Based Economics
F
rom 1990 to 1992 the British pound had an exchange rate that was pegged against 
the German mark, the currency that Germany used before its current currency, 
the euro. The mark-pound exchange rate was initially pegged at a value that re-
quired little government intervention. However, in 1992, changing market forces put 
pressure on the British pound to depreciate. During the summer of 1992, the British 
authorities spent about $24 billion of foreign currency reserves to defend the pegged 
value of the pound. The British authorities were running low on foreign currency 
reserves when a new wave of pound sales hit the market on September 16, 1992. At 
the end of that day, the British authorities gave up trying to prop up its currency and 
accepted a sharp depreciation, as shown in Exhibit 29.7. This day came to be known 
as Black Wednesday.

The events leading up to Black Wednesday yielded winners and losers. 
The winners were the currency traders, especially George Soros. He had bet 
against the pound by borrowing about $10 billion worth of pounds and then us-
ing those pounds to purchase German marks. Following Black Wednesday, the 
German mark became more valuable relative to the pound and, consequently, 
the $10 ­billion of pound-denominated debts that Soros owed were cheaper to 
pay off with appreciated marks. Soros is believed to have made over $1 billion 
of profits on these transactions. These trading profits benefited ­Soros and the 
investors in his hedge fund.
In making these investments, Soros was employing basic economic reasoning. 
He understood that the ­British government was running out of foreign currency 
­reserves, like German marks, in the summer of 1992. ­Soros was able to generate 
billions of dollars of ­additional sales of the British government’s foreign cur-
rency reserves—­Soros used pounds to buy $10 billion worth of marks on the for-
eign exchange market—which helped force the British authorities’ hand. Soros’s 
pound sales and mark purchases accelerated the pace of the British government’s 
reserve losses, convincing the government that it couldn’t resist the tide of pound 
selling.
The losers from Black Wednesday included the British government, which 
suffered enormous losses because it spent billions of dollars of foreign currency 
reserves to prop up the pound. By selling foreign currency reserves that would subse-
quently appreciate against the pound, the British government ended up with trading losses 
of approximately $6 billion worth of pounds.

George Soros bet against 
an overvalued British pound 
just before the pound de-
preciated. Soros borrowed 
pounds and then used those 
pounds to buy German 
marks. On September 16, 
1992, a day that came to be 
known as Black Wednesday, 
the British authorities suc-
cumbed to market pressure 
and devalued the pound. At 
this moment, Soros’s invest-
ments in ­German marks be-
came more valuable than his 
pound-­denominated debts. 
Soros was able to forecast the 
pound’s depreciation ­because 
­British foreign currency 
­reserves were rapidly running 
down during the summer 
of 1992.
The Real Exchange Rate 
and Exports
So far we’ve focused on the nominal exchange rate. That’s the exchange rate that you read 
about in the newspaper each day and is also the exchange rate that equates quantity sup-
plied and quantity demanded in the foreign exchange market. However, it is a different 
exchange rate—the so-called real exchange rate—that is actually crucial for the macro-
economy and for trade. We now define the concept of the real exchange rate and explain 
why it plays such an important role in influencing trade flows.
From the Nominal to the Real Exchange Rate
As we have seen, for its sourcing decisions Walmart compares the costs of domestic manu-
facturers and foreign manufacturers, adjusting for the exchange rate. For example, holding 
quality fixed, Walmart compares the implied dollar price of the toy manufactured in China 
to the dollar price of a similar toy manufactured in the United States. In essence, Walmart 
is interested in the following ratio:
 
Dollar price of U.S. toy
Dollar price of Chinese toy.
29.3 

29.1
29.2
29.4
736	
Chapter 29  |  Open Economy Macroeconomics
29.3
If this ratio is greater than 1, U.S. toys are more expensive than Chinese toys and Walmart 
buys from the Chinese supplier. On the other hand, if this ratio is less than 1, a U.S. toy is 
less expensive than a Chinese toy and Walmart buys from the U.S. supplier.
This ratio incorporates two different kinds of information: the prices of the toys in their 
respective domestic currencies and the yuan-dollar exchange rate that enables Walmart 
to convert yuan prices to dollar prices. The numerator is just the price that U.S. suppliers 
quote Walmart. If the U.S. manufacturer will supply toys to Walmart at $5 per toy, then 
$5 is the numerator.
To calculate the dollar price of the Chinese toy, we need to take the Chinese price (in 
yuan) and multiply it by the number of dollars per yuan. Recall that e is the yuan-dollar 
nominal exchange rate, defined as the number of yuan per dollar. The number of dollars per 
yuan is given by 1/e. Thus the dollar price of Chinese toys can be calculated as
  Dollar price of Chinese toy = (Yuan price of Chinese toy) * Dollars
Yuan
  = (Yuan price of Chinese toy) * 1
e.
For example, if a Chinese toy has a price of 20 yuan and the nominal exchange rate is 
6.05 yuan per dollar, then the dollar price of the Chinese toy is 20/6.05 = $3.31 per toy.
Let’s put these pieces together. We can now rewrite our initial ratio this way:
 
Dollar price of U.S. toy
Dollar price of Chinese toy =
Dollar price of U.S. toy
(Yuan price of Chinese toy) * 1
e
  =
Dollar price of U.S. toy * e
Yuan price of Chinese toy .
This ratio represents the relative price, adjusted for the exchange rate, of U.S. and Chinese 
toys. All companies make these calculations when sourcing their products.
Because this ratio is at the heart of every firm’s sourcing decisions, economists have de-
veloped a special name for it. We define this ratio for a general basket of goods and services 
and refer to it as the real exchange rate. The real exchange rate for the United States is 
defined as the ratio of the dollar price of a basket of goods and services in the United States 
divided by the dollar price of the same basket of goods and services in a foreign country, 
for instance, China. Echoing the previous derivation for the toy example, the overall real 
exchange rate for the United States and China is written as:
  Dollar price of U.S. basket
Dollar price of Chinese basket = (Dollar price of U.S. basket) * e
Yuan price of Chinese basket .
The dollar price of a U.S. basket refers to the price of a basket of goods and services 
in the United States. The yuan price of a Chinese basket is the price of the same basket in 
China. By using the nominal exchange rate, we make the U.S. basket, priced in dollars, and 
the Chinese basket, priced in yuan, comparable.
Co-Movement Between the Nominal  
and the Real Exchange Rates
The previous equation makes it clear that the real exchange rate depends partially on the 
nominal exchange rate and partially on the ratio of U.S. prices and Chinese prices. If U.S. 
and Chinese prices don’t respond to a change in the nominal exchange rate, then the real 
exchange rate should move proportionally with the nominal ex-
change rate. This is indeed the case in the short run but not neces-
sarily in the long run.
Let’s first consider the short-run consequences of a change in 
the nominal exchange rate. Exhibit 29.8 plots both the nominal ex-
change rate between British pounds and U.S. dollars (pounds per 
dollar, normalized to 100 in 1950, in blue) and the real exchange 
rate between the two currencies (dollar prices in the United States 
The real exchange rate is defined 
as the ratio of the dollar price of a 
basket of goods and services in the 
United States, divided by the dollar 
price of the same basket of goods 
and services in a foreign country.
In most circumstances the nominal 
and real exchange rates appreciate 
and depreciate together.

divided by dollar prices in the United Kingdom, also normalized to 100 in 1950, in red). 
The exhibit reveals that, in the short run, the nominal pound-dollar exchange rate moves 
almost in lockstep with the real exchange rate. In other words, in most circumstances the 
nominal and real exchange rates appreciate and depreciate together.
However, the exhibit also shows that there are movements in the real exchange rate 
that are not associated with changes in the nominal exchange rate. This is easiest to see 
from 1950 to 1966, when the nominal exchange rate was pegged between the two coun-
tries. With the nominal exchange rate temporarily fixed, movements in the real exchange 
rate derive solely from different amounts of inflation in the United States and the United 
Kingdom. During this period, UK inflation was higher than U.S. inflation, causing the 
ratio of U.S. prices to UK prices to fall. With a fixed nominal exchange rate, a higher 
inflation rate in the United Kingdom relative to the United States implies that the real 
exchange rate fell from 1950 to 1966.
Movements in the real exchange rate arising from differences in the U.S. and UK infla-
tion rates have also occurred after 1966 (when the two currencies started floating against 
one another), but these inflation effects are easy to miss when you look at the exhibit. For 
floating currencies with modest levels of inflation, most of the year-to-year movement in 
the real exchange rate derives from movement in the nominal exchange rate and not from 
cross-country differences in the rate of inflation.

Exhibit 29.8 The Nominal and the Real Pound-Dollar Exchange Rates  
from 1950 to 2010
This exhibit plots the nominal exchange rate between British pounds and U.S. 
dollars (pounds per dollar, in blue) and the real exchange rate between the two 
currencies (dollar prices in the United States divided by dollar prices in the United 
Kingdom, in red). The pound and the dollar were pegged until 1966, so the nom-
inal exchange rate was constant from 1950 to 1966. However, the real ­exchange 
rate fell from 1950 to 1966 because prices were rising faster in the United King-
dom than they were in the United States. After 1967, the nominal and the real 
exchange rates seem to move up and down together: when the nominal pound-
dollar exchange rate rises so that the dollar appreciates, so does the real pound-
dollar exchange rate. Over the entire period, the real exchange rate keeps falling 
further behind the nominal exchange rate because the UK inflation rate has been 
slightly greater on average than the U.S. inflation rate. Note that both exchange 
rates are normalized to equal 100 in 1950 (every observation is divided by the 
value of the same series in 1950 and the result is multiplied by 100).

retailer like Walmart—is stocking its shelves (in China) with U.S. or Chinese products. 
When the yuan-dollar real exchange rate appreciates, U.S. goods become more expensive 
relative to Chinese goods, so more stores in the United States prefer to import from China 
and more stores in China, like Shanghai Bailian, prefer to buy local products rather than to 
import from the United States. Exhibit 29.9 summarizes these optimizing decisions.
Now recall that net exports are defined as exports minus imports:
Net exports = Exports − Imports.
Exhibit 29.10 plots the net exports curve, denoted by NX(E), which shows the relationship 
between net exports and the real exchange rate, denoted as E. This relationship is downward-
sloping because when the yuan-dollar real exchange rate appreciates (implying a higher 
value of E), U.S. exports to China tend to fall and U.S. imports from China tend to increase.

When its real exchange rate ­appreciates, a

exports less to other ­countries, reducing its 
net ­exports. This ­relationship is shown by the 
downward-sloping net ­exports curve, denoted by 
NX(E). For ­instance, when the real ­exchange rate 
rises from E* to E1, net ­exports fall from 0 to NX1 
< 0. ­Conversely, when the real exchange rate falls 
from E* to E2, net exports rise from 0 to NX2 > 0.
GDP in the Open Economy
We now analyze the macroeconomic implications of changes in the real exchange rate. 
Let’s ­focus on an appreciation of the real exchange rate. To understand the consequences of 
this change, let’s return to the national income accounting identity, which was introduced 
in Chapter 19:
Y = C + I + G + X − M.
29.4 
Notice also that there is a particular value of the real exchange rate, marked as E* in 
Exhibit 29.10, where net exports are equal to zero. When the real exchange rate is above 
E*, net exports are negative (a trade deficit), and when the real exchange rate is below 
E*, net exports are positive (a trade surplus). The real exchange rate usually can’t stay far 
above E*, because large permanent trade deficits tend to be unsustainable. A large perma-
nent trade deficit leads to an ever-rising debt to foreign countries. At some point, foreign 
countries will get nervous that this debt won’t be repaid. When that happens, they will start 
selling their U.S. assets, driving down the nominal dollar exchange rate, which causes E 
to fall toward E*.

Our discussion of the yuan-dollar nominal exchange rate, 
which is illustrated in Exhibit 29.5, implies that the yuan has 
been historically undervalued (and the dollar has been over-
valued). To hold down the value of the yuan (and thereby 
prop up the value of the dollar), the Chinese authorities 
have sold yuan and purchased dollars (about $2 trillion).
Why would the Chinese authorities try to keep the 
dollar overvalued? Exhibit 29.10 provides the answer: 
an overvalued real dollar exchange rate implies greater 
net exports from China to the United States. Chinese au-
thorities have been supporting an overvalued dollar in 
order to boost Chinese exports. A consequence of the 
overvalued yuan-dollar real exchange rate—an exchange 
rate above the equivalent of E * in Exhibit 29.10—is the 
large trade deficit that the United States runs with China. 
­Exhibit 29.11 shows that this trade deficit was approxi-
mately $300 billion in 2013. Export growth has been a 
key pillar of China’s growth strategy since the 1980s.
This strategy might boost the rate of Chinese growth, 
but it does come with costs for China, not to mention 
the rest of the world. An undervalued Chinese yuan hurts 
Chinese workers by lowering their buying power because 
it makes their imports from the rest of the world more 
expensive. In addition, an undervalued Chinese yuan 
creates diplomatic problems with China’s trading part-
ners. Higher Chinese exports to the United States dis-
tort economic activity in the United States by crowding 
out industries that compete with Chinese manufacturers. 
This situation creates considerable friction between the 
United States and China.

Here Y represents GDP, I represents investment (in plants, equipment, and residential con-
struction), C represents consumption, G represents government expenditure, and X − M 
represents net exports (all for the U.S. economy).
The appreciation of the real exchange rate reduces net exports and causes a decline in 
GDP—holding all else equal, a decline in X − M on the right-hand side of the national 
income accounting identity reduces Y or GDP. We can trace out these macroeconomic im-
plications using the labor supply and labor demand diagram introduced in Chapter 23 and 
used for the analysis of macroeconomic fluctuations in Chapters 26 and 27. Exhibit 29.12 
presents the model with downward wage rigidity.
To illustrate how GDP responds to the changes in net exports, suppose that the dol-
lar appreciates and net exports decline. In particular, the foreign demand for certain U.S. 
products—let’s say machine tools—declines because the appreciation of the dollar has 
made these goods more expensive for foreigners. This decline in demand for machine tools 
implies that machine-tool producers will shift their labor demand to the left. As shown in 
Exhibit 29.12, the leftward shift of labor demand induced by the appreciation of the dollar 
will translate into lower employment and a new pool of unemployed workers.
We also need to consider multiplier effects, which were introduced in Chapter 26. 
For instance, job losses in an export industry will cause unemployment, and the newly 

29.1
29.2
29.3
740	
Chapter 29  |  Open Economy Macroeconomics
unemployed workers will reduce consumption, thereby affecting other industries. In this 
way, a decline in net exports might have spillover effects, leading to a larger aggregate 
economic contraction than the direct effect of the reduction in net exports.
Interest Rates, Exchange Rates, and Net Exports
We just explained that an appreciation of the real exchange rate will reduce GDP. Now we 
explain how expansionary monetary policy can reverse this contraction by lowering the 
real exchange rate and increasing net exports.
Imagine that we start from the real exchange rate E1, as drawn in Exhibit 29.10. Assume 
that the domestic interest rate falls as the result of expansionary monetary policy. Such a 
decrease will cause foreigners—say, Europeans—to reduce their holdings of U.S. assets 
(because with a lower interest rate, the rate of return on U.S. assets relative to foreign assets 
has declined, making them less attractive). But to do so they need to exchange dollars for 
euros, and thus there will be a greater supply of dollars from Europeans. The greater supply 
of U.S. dollars will shift the dollar supply curve to the right in the foreign exchange market. 
Because the dollar-euro exchange rate is flexible, this greater supply of dollars will lead to 
a depreciation of the dollar relative to the euro.
In Exhibit 29.10, this depreciation means moving toward a lower real exchange rate, 
say from E1 to E*, which increases net exports from NX1 < 0 to NX = 0. In summary, a 
decrease in U.S. interest rates causes a depreciation of the U.S. dollar, a depreciation in the 
dollar real exchange rate, and an increase in U.S. net exports.

A decline in net exports (such as the move from trade balance to

­supplied by certain domestic ­producers, and this reduces labor demand. 
With ­downward rigid wages, the lower labor demand translates into 
unemployment.

The Fed can increase net exports 
by lowering domestic interest rates 
or can lower net exports by raising 
­domestic interest rates.
On the other hand, contractionary monetary policy will have the 
opposite impact. When the Fed raises the domestic interest rate, this 
makes U.S. assets more appealing, which causes foreigners to in-
crease their holdings of U.S. assets. Their increased purchases of 
U.S. assets cause a rightward shift in the demand curve for dollars, 
raising the equilibrium nominal exchange rate. This in turn causes 
the real exchange rate to appreciate, reducing net exports.
Summing up, the Fed can increase net exports by lowering 
­domestic interest rates or can lower net exports by raising domes-
tic interest rates.
Revisiting Black Wednesday
With the help of this discussion, we can revisit the British experience in the early 1990s. 
As we discussed in the Evidence-Based Economics feature, the British pound came to be 
overvalued relative to the German mark and this overvaluation eventually led to the sharp 
depreciation of the pound on Black Wednesday.
The scenario depicted in Exhibits 29.10 and 29.12 reflects the situation of the British 
economy during 1991 and 1992. The overvalued pound was reducing British GDP. The 
British economy was effectively at real exchange rate E1 in Exhibit 29.10 and the corre-
sponding point with employment given by L1 in Exhibit 29.12.
You might be wondering why the British authorities thought that they could defend the 
pound despite its overvaluation. The answer is that they believed that the overvaluation was 
temporary.
The British authorities’ optimistic beliefs were not entirely groundless. We have so far 
explained how a nominal exchange rate depreciation can eliminate overvaluation of a cur-
rency. But there is another solution that can occur whether or not a country has a flexible 
exchange rate. Due to the lower net exports shown in Exhibit 29.10, domestic firms might 
cut their prices to become more competitive, and this would reduce the ratio of domestic 
prices to foreign prices. Recall that the real exchange rate is
 E = (Domestic prices) * e
Foreign prices
.
A falling ratio of domestic to foreign prices (holding e fixed) would correspond to a falling 
real exchange rate, boosting net exports, raising labor demand, and increasing GDP.
In 1992, the British authorities anticipated that British prices would fall relative to the 
prices of their trading partners and that this would eliminate the overvaluation of the pound 
because more foreign countries would choose to import goods from the United Kingdom 
(shifting the demand curve for the pound to the right). However, such domestic price ad-
justments take a long time to occur, something the British authorities didn’t realize at first. 
By the time they learned this lesson the overvalued pound had already depressed British 
net exports and caused a severe recession. As the real exchange rate was showing little sign 
of improvement and British foreign reserves were running out, the stage was set for Black 
Wednesday and the sharp depreciation of the pound’s nominal exchange rate.
Consistent with the models discussed in this chapter, the depreciation of the pound 
on Black Wednesday led to a decline in the pound’s real exchange rate, an expansion of 
­British net exports, and a corresponding increase in the aggregate level of economic activ-
ity. In fact, the British economy did so well after Black Wednesday, growing on average at 
3.6 percent per year during the next 3 years, that some commentators switched to calling 
the day that Soros broke the pound “White Wednesday.” Pegging the pound to the mark had 
been damaging the UK economy. Letting market forces determine the price of the pound 
turned out to be the best policy after all.

Chapter 29  |  Open Economy Macroeconomics
Both Europe and the United States were plunged into re-
cession during the 2007–2009 financial crisis. The economic 
contraction and its aftermath have been worse in Europe, 
as you can see in Exhibit 29.13. In 2013, U.S. real GDP was 
7.6 percent above its 2007 pre-crisis level. In 2013, eurozone 
real GDP was still 0.3 percent below its 2007 pre-crisis level.
Many economists believe that the greater severity and 
duration of the economic crisis in Europe has in part been 
due to the inability of European exchange rates to adjust. 
Since January 1, 1999, major European economies (exclud-
ing the United Kingdom) have been part of the eurozone, 
which means that they use a single currency, the euro. This 
is referred to as a currency union, a form of fixed exchange 
rate, in which, by using the same currency, all of these 
economies are pegging their exchange rates to each other.
As we have seen, when the exchange rate can change, 
countries can devalue their currencies and thus increase 
their net exports, stimulating the economy. This is not 
possible when a country is a member of a currency union 
(unless the common currency itself is devalued).
Compounding this problem, there is the mismatch 
between the needs of different European economies. 
Germany has been doing relatively well compared to the 
rest of Europe. In 2013, German real GDP was 5.9 per-
cent above its 2007 pre-crisis level. Many other eurozone 
economies have done much less well. The aggregate real 
GDP of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, was 
7.2 percent lower in 2013 than it was in 2007.
If these countries had independent monetary authori-
ties, they might have adopted highly expansionary mon-
etary policies, stimulating their economies and reducing 
their real exchange rates. This would have increased their 
net exports and boosted demand for labor. However, the 
eurozone currency union has necessitated a one-size-fits-all 
monetary policy, which has ended up being insufficiently 
expansionary for Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.

Summary
The nominal exchange rate is the number of units of foreign currency per unit 
of domestic currency. The real exchange rate, on the other hand, gives the ratio of 
the dollar price of a basket of goods and services purchased in the United States to 
the dollar price of the same basket purchased in a foreign country.
The nominal exchange rate is determined by the supply and demand for a 
currency in the foreign exchange market. When a Chinese producer sells goods 
to a U.S. firm and receives dollars, the Chinese firm converts the dollars to the 

Chinese currency, the yuan, in the foreign exchange market. This is equivalent to 
demanding yuan and supplying dollars in the foreign exchange market. On the 
other hand, a Chinese firm that imports from the United States would be doing 
the opposite in the foreign exchange market: supplying yuan and demanding 
dollars with which it will pay its U.S. trading partners.
When a country has a flexible exchange rate, changes in the supply and 
demand for a currency lead to fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate. Many 
countries, however, manage or fix exchange rates and therefore peg their 
currencies to another currency, such as the dollar. Under managed or fixed 
exchange rates, fluctuations in the supply and demand for the currency do not 
necessarily lead to fluctuations in the exchange rate.
Though managed or fixed exchange rate systems might appear more stable 
at first, when the exchange rates they generate are out of line with market forces, 
these systems can lead to sudden changes in the exchange rate. In the process, 
they create huge profit opportunities, like the one exploited by the financier 
George Soros when he bet that the British pound would be allowed to depreciate.
The real exchange rate is a key price for the economy in part because it deter-
mines net exports. A real exchange rate greater than 1 implies that U.S. goods and 
services are more expensive than foreign goods and services. Thus a real exchange 
rate above 1 discourages exports and encourages imports, reducing net exports.
A fall in net exports lowers GDP and shifts the labor demand curve to the left.
Domestic interest rates influence the real exchange rate. A fall in domestic 
interest rates reduces the appeal of U.S. assets to foreign investors, lowering both 
the nominal and the real exchange rates. The resulting rise in net exports shifts 
the labor demand curve to the right and increases GDP.

labor market diagram to explain how country Hapa’s ex-
pansionary monetary policy affects Lova’s employment. 
Assume that the real exchange rate usually follows the 
nominal exchange rate, and the nominal prices in each 
country remain the same. 
	 6.	 Econia trades with its neighbors, the countries of Govern-
mentia and Sociologia. In Econia, the currency is called 
the econ; in Governmentia, the currency is called the gov; 
and in Sociologia, the currency is the soc.
Nominal exchange rates follow:
200 econ = 1 gov
1 soc = ¼ gov
100 econ = 1 soc
A good that is produced and consumed in all three 
countries is the Mack Burger. The price of Macks in the 
three countries is as follows: 1 Mack costs 2 govs in Gov-
ernmentia, 16 socs in Sociologia, and 600 econ in Econia.
	
a.	 From the perspective of Governmentia, calculate the 
real exchange rate in Mack Burgers between Govern-
mentia and Sociologia, using the nominal exchange 
rates and prices listed above. Explain in words what 
the number you calculated means.
	
b.	 If these three currencies can be freely traded so that 
their exchange rates are flexible or floating, can the 
nominal exchange rates listed above persist over time? 
Why or why not? [Hint: Show that currency traders

could make unlimited profits if they could trade at 
these exchange rates.]
	
c.	 The economy of Econia enters a period of deflation. 
What will happen as a result of this to the current ac-
count in Governmentia, Econia’s main trading part-
ner, in the short run? Assume nominal exchange rates 
are constant in the short run. Explain fully.
	 7.	 Challenge Problem: The beautiful, mythical country of 
Coloradial uses the teo as its currency, and the gritty, post-
industrial country of Oheo uses the eren. Exactly 1 year ago, 
you could get 100 teos in exchange for 5 erens in the foreign 
exchange market. Since then, though, the real interest rate in 
Coloradial has increased, while staying constant in Oheo.
	
a.	 All other things being equal, would you expect the 
eren to have appreciated or depreciated with respect 
to the teo? Explain your reasoning.
	
b.	 Assume that the change in the value of the eren with re-
spect to the teo (appreciation or depreciation depending 
on your previous answer) was 50 percent. What is the 
current nominal exchange rate expressed in teos/eren?
	
c.	 One year ago, you borrowed 100,000 teos from a Colo-
radial bank at a rate of 3 percent per year. You then traded 
the 100,000 teos for erens at the nominal exchange rate 
that prevailed at the time (100 teos = 5 erens), and 
­invested those erens in Oheo at 5 percent interest.
After the year was over, your intention was to ex-
change the erens back for teos, repay the loan to the 
Coloradial bank, and keep a tidy profit. (This strategy 
is called a “carry trade” and at various times has been 
popular with foreign exchange traders.)
	
i.	 How much would you have made on this strategy if 
the interest rates did not change and if the exchange 
rate had not changed from 100 teos = 5 erens?
	
ii.	 What will be your profit (or loss) on the trade 
given the changes in the exchange rate you found 
in parts (a) and (b)? (Assume the interest rate you 
paid to the Coloradial bank was fixed in your loan 
agreement, and so did not change.)

	 What could explain why the U.S. dollar depreciated 
­vis-à-vis the Japanese yen between 2008 and 2013? Ex-
plain your answer with the help of the information given 
in the table.
	 9.	 Over the last 10 years, the dollar has depreciated vis-à-vis 
the euro.
	
a.	 Suppose that in the short run the Fed wanted both to 
defend the dollar (that is, stop its decline and/or cause it 
to appreciate) and stimulate investment. Based on what 
you have learned in this chapter and in ­Chapter 27, 
­discuss whether the Fed can achieve both of these 
goals simultaneously through monetary policy?
	
b.	 Suppose instead that the European Central Bank 
(ECB) conducts expansionary monetary policy. 
What is the short-run effect, if any, of this policy 
on the euro/dollar nominal exchange rate and on the 
real exchange rate between the United States and the 
European Monetary Union. In your answer about 
what happens to the real exchange rate, state any as-
sumptions you are making.
	10.	 Thailand and Taiwan are both rapidly growing economies 
in East and Southeast Asia that trade actively with other 
countries.
	
a.	 Suppose rice wine is the only good produced in Thai-
land and Taiwan. A bottle of wine costs 100 bhat in 
Thailand and 200 NT (New Taiwan dollars) in ­Taiwan. 
The nominal exchange rate is 0.5 bhat per NT. Calcu-
late the real exchange rate from Thailand’s perspective 
(that is, using Thailand as the “domestic” economy). 
Show your work. Intuitively, what does this number 
represent?
	
b.	 The Taiwanese trade balance (its current account) 
with the rest of the world is initially running neither 
a deficit nor a surplus. Taiwan alone experiences an 
economic boom and its real interest rate rises at the 
same time. Thoroughly explain the mechanisms by 
which the Taiwanese current account is affected by 
its boom and the increase in its real interest rate.
	
c.	 Assume that the change in the value of the bhat/NT 
exchange rate was 50 percent, which, depending on 
your answer in part (b), was either appreciation or de-
preciation. What is the current nominal exchange rate 
expressed in bhat/NT? Show your work.
	11.	 Imagine that there are two economies in the world: 
­Bostonia and New Yorkland. Bostonia’s currency is the 
sock and New Yorkland’s is the yank. Despite the long-
standing rivalry between their citizens, Bostonia and New 
­Yorkland are trading partners.

Chapter 29  |  Open Economy Macroeconomics
The Central Bank of New Yorkland decides to conduct 
contractionary monetary policy. Explain the short-run 
­effect, if any, on the following:
	
a.	 The yank/sock nominal exchange rate
	
b.	 New Yorkland’s net exports
	
c.	 Bostonia’s net exports
	
d.	 GDP in New Yorkland recently plummeted. At first, the 
citizens in Bostonia cheered, happy to see their ­rivals 
taken down a notch. But then an economist (­always a 
killjoy) asserts that the fall in New Yorkland’s GDP is 
likely to hurt Bostonia’s GDP in the short run. Could 
the economist be correct? Why or why not?
	12.	 Purchasing power parity (PPP) implies that the price lev-
els of two baskets of goods in two countries, the U.S. and 
Japan, are equal when expressed in a common currency. If 
PPP holds, what would the real exchange rate be?

1	 Before 1947, U.S. GDP data are only available on an annual 
basis. Because the 1945 recession occurred within a single 
year, we don’t know how much real GDP declined, but we can 
estimate it using the annual data. From 1944 to 1946, real GDP 
fell by 12.7 percent.
