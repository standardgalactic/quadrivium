Industrial Organization: Competition, Strategy and Policy, fifth edition, is a text-
book on industrial organization. It provides coverage of the latest theories of 
industrial organization, and it examines empirical evidence concerning the strate-
gies, behaviour and performance of firms and industries.
In selecting material for inclusion in this edition, we have attempted to provide 
readers with a flavour of the historical development of industrial ­organization. 
The book reflects the development of this subject area from its origins in the 
classical theories of the firm, followed by its emergence as a recognized subdis-
cipline within economics around the mid-twentieth century, right through to the 
present. Today, industrial organization draws on an impressive array of con-
tributions from fields of economic inquiry as diverse as game theory, informa-
tion theory, organization theory, agency theory and transaction cost analysis. At 
various stages throughout the book, we examine the work of researchers in the 
closely related field of strategic management, in order to emphasise the relevance 
of industrial organization to readers who are approaching the subject primar-
ily from a business or a management standpoint, rather than from a traditional 
economics perspective.
Industrial Organization: Competition, Strategy and Policy, fifth edition, 
­contains around 60 case studies, which are used to illustrate ‘real world’ appli-
cations of theoretical and empirical research in industrial organization. Many 
of the case studies have been selected from reports originally published in the 
Financial Times, while others have been compiled from alternative sources. Many 
of the case studies have been chosen not only for their relevance to industrial 
organization, but also because they are lively, newsworthy and topical. The case 
study material certainly bears little or no resemblance to the subject matter of 
a traditional industrial economics research agenda of 20 or 30 years ago, when 
much greater emphasis would have been placed on traditional manufacturing and 
heavy industry. Instead, the case studies focus on key sectors of the modern-day 
economy, such as banking and financial services (commercial banking, the credit 
union movement); sport and leisure (Hollywood movies, English Premier League 
football); and online products and services (social networking, music apps).
This textbook is aimed primarily at undergraduate students. The text is 
intended for use on modules in industrial organization, industrial economics

or business economics, by students studying for degrees in economics, business 
and management studies, and other related disciplines. It can also be used as a 
preparatory, background or reference text by students taking graduate courses 
in the same subjects. The only prior experience of economics that is assumed is 
the completion of an introductory Principles of Economics module, or a part-
year module in Microeconomics.
The style of presentation is non-technical throughout. No knowledge of cal-
culus is required. However, for readers requiring a more rigorous treatment of 
certain topics, a Mathematical Methods appendix provides formal derivations 
(using calculus) of a selection of the most important theories and results pre-
sented in the main text. Empirical research in industrial organization is also 
presented throughout the text in a non-technical style. No knowledge of statistics 
or econometrics is assumed. For readers requiring a primer in the fundamentals 
of regression analysis, an Econometric Methods appendix provides a brief and 
non-technical introduction to some of the basic tools, such as regression coef-
ficients, t-statistics and goodness-of-fit.
	
	
Structure of the book
Industrial Organization: Competition, Strategy and Policy, fifth edition, is divided 
into four parts. In Part I, Theoretical Foundations, Chapter 1 introduces some of 
the key elements of industrial organization, starting with the structure–­conduct–
performance paradigm, which provided the intellectual foundation for the early 
development of industrial organization as a separate subdiscipline within eco-
nomics. Chapters 2 and 3 review the core microeconomic theory from which 
many of the early and modern theories of industrial organization have developed. 
Chapters 4 and 5 examine a number of alternative theories of firm behaviour, 
including the neoclassical, managerial and behavioural theories, as well as per-
spectives drawn from transaction cost analysis, agency, knowledge- and resource-
based theories. Chapter 6 examines issues related to corporate governance.
Part II, Structural Analysis of Industry, discusses the approach within the 
field of industrial organization which emphasises the role of the structural attri-
butes of an industry in explaining the conduct of the industry’s constituent firms. 
Chapters 7, 8 and 9 examine non-collusive and collusive theories of oligopoly, 
a market structure whose most important characteristic is the small number 
of interdependent, competing firms. Chapter 10 examines practical aspects of 
industry definition, and the measurement of the number and size distribution 
of an industry’s constituent firms, summarised by measures of industry or seller 
concentration. Chapter 11 examines the determinants of seller concentration. 
Chapter 12 examines another important structural attribute of industries: barri-
ers to entry. Finally, Chapter 13 provides a link between Parts II and III of the 
book, by describing the evolution of industrial organization beyond the confines 
of the structure–conduct–performance paradigm, and the development of new 
approaches and methods, which are conveniently summarised under the banner 
of the ‘new empirical industrial organization’.

|	 Preface
In Part III, Analysis of Firm Strategy, the focus shifts away from industry 
structure, and towards the newer theories of industrial organization that empha-
sise conduct or strategic decision-making at firm level. Chapter 14 examines a 
number of pricing practices, including price discrimination and transfer pricing. 
In recognition of the growing use of auctions as a method for allocating resources 
and awarding contracts in the commercial and public sectors, Chapter 15 exam-
ines the economic theory of auctions. In the rest of Part III, the emphasis shifts 
towards various non-price strategies that can be adopted by firms, in an attempt 
to improve their profitability or gain a competitive advantage over their rivals. 
Chapters 16 and 17 examine product differentiation and advertising. Chapter 18 
examines research and development and technological progress. Chapter 19 
examines horizontal mergers. Chapters 20 and 21 examine vertical integration 
and vertical restraints. Chapter 22 examines the economics of network goods and 
services. Chapter 23 examines diversification and conglomerate mergers.
Part IV, Analysis of Public Policy, concludes the book by drawing together the 
implications for public policy of many of the key findings of Parts I, II and III. 
Chapter 24 examines competition policy, including government policy towards 
monopolies, restrictive practices and mergers.

third and fourth editions we have received from instructors and students. How-
ever, a new edition provides a welcome opportunity to make improvements and 
to update and extend the material that was covered previously. For the fifth 
edition, the number of chapters has remained at 24. However, some important 
changes to content have been made. The number of chapters in Part II has 
increased to include a chapter on game theory, Chapter 9. In Part III of the 
text, Chapter 23 now includes a new section on the multinational enterprise. In 
addition to this new chapter and new section, we have revised and updated our 
coverage of many theoretical and empirical topics in industrial organization 
throughout the text.
The previous edition’s extensive bibliography has turned out to be a highly 
popular feature with instructors, and with students wishing to read beyond the 
confines of a core textbook, perhaps with a view towards choosing a dissertation 
topic, or towards studying industrial organization at graduate level. Accord-
ingly, in the fifth edition we have taken the opportunity to extend and update 
our previous bibliography.
We have retained or updated the most interesting and relevant case studies 
from the first, second, third and fourth editions, and we have added many more 
completely new case studies to the fifth edition. Most of the new case studies 
describe recent events which have occurred since the publication of the first edi-
tion in 2001. We have revised the end-of-chapter discussion questions, and at 
the end of selected chapters we have added new problem sets comprising math-
ematical or computational questions. A knowledge of calculus at an introductory

level (differentiation, integration, optimization) is required to answer most of 
these problems, and readers without the required mathematical background 
should skip them. Solutions are provided at the end of the book. Finally, we have 
extended our website www.pearsoned.co.uk/lipczynski, which contains supporting 
material for instructors in the form of PowerPoint slides and outline answers to 
discussion questions. The website also contains links to other relevant websites, 
and a glossary of key terms, for instructors and students.

Introduction
This book deals with the economics of industrial organization. Specific topics 
that are covered include theory of the firm, oligopoly, concentration, barriers to 
entry, pricing and auctions, product differentiation and advertising, research and 
development, mergers, vertical integration, diversification, competition policy 
and regulation. The aim of this introductory chapter is to provide an overview of 
some of this subject material, for both the specialist and the non-specialist reader.
The chapter begins in Section 1.2 by examining static and dynamic views of 
competition in economic theory. The view of competition found in the neoclas-
sical theory of the firm (incorporating the textbook models of perfect competi-
tion, monopolistic competition, oligopoly and monopoly) is essentially static. In

contrast, a more dynamic approach can be found in the writings of Schumpeter 
and economists identified with the Austrian school. Section 1.3 describes the 
structure–conduct–performance (SCP) paradigm, which laid the foundation for 
the original development of industrial organization as a separate subdiscipline 
within economics. The key elements of structure, conduct and performance are 
introduced, and some of the main limitations of the SCP paradigm are discussed. 
Finally, Section 1.4 makes a short diversion into the related subdiscipline of 
strategic management and identifies several further themes that will be pursued 
in more depth throughout this book.
	
1.2	
Static and dynamic views of competition
In microeconomics, the neoclassical theory of the firm considers four main the-
oretical market structures: perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oli-
gopoly and monopoly. These underpin much of the subject matter of industrial 
organization. A perfectly competitive industry has six main characteristics: there 
are large numbers of buyers and sellers; producers and consumers have perfect 
knowledge; the products sold by firms are identical; firms act independently of 
each other and aim to maximise profits; firms are free to enter or exit; and firms 
can sell as much output as they wish at the current market price. If these condi-
tions are satisfied, a competitive equilibrium exists in which all firms earn only a 
normal profit. If any particular firm is unable to earn a normal profit, perhaps 
because it is failing to produce at maximum efficiency, this firm is forced to 
withdraw from the market. In this way perfect competition imposes discipline: 
all surviving firms are forced to produce as efficiently as the current state of 
technology will allow.
In reality, however, competition often gives rise to a market or industry struc-
ture comprising a relatively small number of large firms. Each firm has sufficient 
market power to determine its own price, and some or all firms are able to earn 
an abnormal profit in the long run. One reason competition tends to lead to a 
decrease in the number of firms in the long run is that, as firms grow, they realise 
economies of scale and average costs tend to fall. In the most extreme case of 
natural monopoly, a single firm can produce at a lower average cost than any 
number of competing firms. Among others, Marshall (1890) and Sraffa (1926) 
formulated the theory of monopoly. The tendency for average costs to fall as 
the scale of production increases might be a beneficial aspect of monopoly, 
if the cost savings are passed on to consumers in lower prices. However, if a 
monopolist exploits its market power by restricting output and raising price to 
earn an abnormal profit, then monopoly may have damaging implications for 
consumer welfare.
Influenced by Marshall and Sraffa, Chamberlin (1933) and Robinson (1933) 
brought together the previously separate theories of monopoly and perfect com-
petition, to formulate the theory of imperfect competition, which can be sub-
divided into the cases of monopolistic competition and oligopoly. The theory 
of monopolistic competition retains the assumption that the number of firms 
is large, but emphasises non-price as well as price forms of competition. In the

theory of oligopoly it is assumed the number of firms is small (but greater than 
one). The firms recognise their interdependence: changes in price or output by 
one firm will alter the profits of rival firms, causing them to adjust their own 
prices and output levels. Forms of competition under oligopoly vary from vig-
orous price competition, which can often lead to substantial losses, through to 
collusion, whereby the firms take joint decisions concerning their prices and 
output levels.
Essentially, the neoclassical theory of the firm is based on a static conception 
of competition. In all of the models outlined above, the main focus is on long-
run equilibrium.
In the end-state conception of equilibrium, the focus of attention is 
on the nature of the equilibrium state in which the contest between 
transacting agents is finally resolved; if there is recognition of change 
at all, it is change in the sense of a new stationary equilibrium of 
endogenous variables in response to an altered set of exogenous 
variables; but comparative statics is still an end-state conception 
of economics.
(Blaug, 2001, p. 37)
In the twentieth century, some researchers rejected this static view of compe-
tition, and sought to develop a more dynamic approach. According to both 
Schumpeter (1928, 1942) and the Austrian school of economists, the fact that a 
firm earns an abnormal (monopoly) profit does not constitute evidence that the 
firm is guilty of abusing its market (monopoly) power at the expense of consum-
ers. Instead, monopoly profits play an important role in the process of competi-
tion, motivating and guiding entrepreneurs towards taking decisions that will 
produce an improved allocation of scarce resources in the long run. Schumpeter 
and the Austrian school both recognise that knowledge or information is always 
imperfect.
According to Schumpeter, competition is driven by innovation: the introduc-
tion of new products and processes, the conquest of new markets for inputs or 
outputs, or the reorganization of existing productive arrangements (for exam-
ple, through entry or takeover). By initiating change by means of innovation, 
the entrepreneur plays a key role in driving forward technological progress. 
Innovation destroys old products and production processes, and replaces them 
with new and better ones. The successful innovator is rewarded with monopoly 
status and monopoly profits for a time. However, following a brief catching-up 
period, imitators are able to move into the market, eroding the original innova-
tor’s monopoly status and profits. Alternatively, another innovator may eventu-
ally come along with an even better product or production process, rendering 
the previous innovation obsolete. According to this dynamic view of competi-
tion, monopoly status is only a temporary phenomenon, and is not capable of 
sustaining a stable long-run equilibrium, as is assumed in the neoclassical theory 
of the firm.
The Austrian school also views competition as a dynamic process, and sees 
the market as comprising a configuration of decisions made by consumers,

entrepreneurs and resource owners (Kirzner, 1973, 1997a,b). Entrepreneurs play 
a crucial role by noticing missed opportunities for mutually advantageous trade. 
Entrepreneurs discover and act upon new pieces of information. By observing 
the actions of entrepreneurs, other decision-makers are able adjust their trad-
ing plans and arrive at improved outcomes. Disequilibrium reflects imperfect 
information or ignorance on the part of buyers and sellers. The entrepreneurial 
function adds to the flow of information, and helps lubricate the process of 
adjustment towards a new and superior allocation of scarce resources. Whereas 
the Schumpeterian entrepreneur actively initiates change, the role of the entre-
preneur in Austrian thinking is more passive: the Austrian entrepreneur merely 
responds more quickly than other agents to new information that is generated 
exogenously. According to Austrian economists, a monopoly position is attained 
through the originality and foresight of the entrepreneur; and, as Schumpeter 
suggests, monopoly profits are unlikely to be sustained indefinitely. As informa-
tion arrives and new trading opportunities open up, other entrepreneurs appear, 
who by their actions help propel the economy towards a further reallocation of 
resources (Young et al., 1996; Roberts and Eisenhardt, 2003).
	
1.3	
The structure–conduct–performance paradigm
The static and dynamic theories discussed above have found an empirical coun-
terpart in the field that has become known as industrial organization. Early work 
in this area, based predominantly on the structure–conduct–performance (SCP) 
paradigm, concentrates on empirical rather than theoretical analysis (Bain, 1951). 
In the main, the field of industrial organization analyses empirical data and, by a 
process of induction, develops theories to explain the behaviour and performance 
of firms and the industries to which they belong (Schmalensee, 1988; Caves, 2007).
Outline of the structure–conduct–performance paradigm
Seminal early contributions in industrial organization include Mason (1939, 
1949) and Bain (1951, 1956, 1959). Mason and Bain are credited with the devel-
opment of the SCP paradigm. According to this approach, the structure of a 
market influences the conduct of the firms operating in the market, which in turn 
influences the performance of those firms. The field of industrial organization 
is concerned with the investigation of ‘the size structure of firms (one or many, 
“concentrated” or not), the causes (above all the economies of scale) of this size 
structure, the effects of concentration on competition, the effects of competition 
on prices, investment, innovation and so on’ (Stigler, 1968, p. 1).
The SCP paradigm is useful in a number of ways:
■ It allows the researcher to reduce all industry data into meaningful categories 
(Bain, 1956).
■ It is consistent with the neoclassical theory of the firm, which also assumes 
there is a direct link between market structure, and firm conduct and perfor-
mance, without overtly recognizing this link (Mason, 1949).

■ By defining a workable or acceptable standard of performance, it may be 
possible to accept an imperfect market structure, if such a structure produces 
outcomes that are consistent with the acceptable standard (Clark, 1940). By 
implication, market structure can be altered in order to improve conduct and 
performance (Sosnick, 1958).
A schematic representation of the SCP paradigm is presented in Figure 1.1. In accor-
dance with the fundamental logic of SCP, the main linkages are shown as running 
from structure through conduct to performance. However, various feedback effects 
are also possible: from performance back to conduct; from conduct to structure; and 
from performance to structure (Phillips, 1976; Clarke, 1985). These are represented 
in Figure 1.1 by dotted arrows. Several specific types of feedback effect are identified 
in the following discussion of the main components of the structure, conduct and 
performance categories. Figure 1.2 is a schematic representation of the SCP model 
for the analysis of the historical development of the East India Company, the English 
company formed in the seventeenth century to pursue trade with East and South-East 
Asia, which later played a pivotal role in the creation of the British Empire in India.

Structure
Structural characteristics tend to change relatively slowly, and can often be 
regarded as fixed in the short run. Some of the more important structure vari-
ables are as follows:
■ The number and size distribution of buyers and sellers is an important determi-
nant of the market power exercised by the leading firms in the industry and 
the discretion these sellers exercise over their own prices. In consumer goods 
industries it is normally the case that there are large numbers of small, atomistic 
buyers. Accordingly, the main focus is on the number and size distribution of 
sellers. Seller concentration is typically measured using data on the share of 
total industry sales, assets or employment accounted for by the largest firms in 
the industry. In capital goods industries, however, it is possible that the number 
of buyers is also small. If so, there may be market power on the demand side, 
as well as on the supply side: buyers may exercise discretion over the prices they 
pay. In such cases, a full assessment of the distribution of market power might 
require measurement of buyer concentration as well as seller concentration.

■ Entry and exit conditions include barriers to entry, which can be defined loosely 
as anything that places a potential entrant at a competitive disadvantage rela-
tive to an incumbent firm. The important issue is the relative ease or difficulty 
that firms may experience when entering an industry: if entry is difficult, then 
incumbents are sheltered from outside competition (Neven, 1989). Entry barri-
ers may derive from basic characteristics of the product or production technol-
ogy and cost structure, or from deliberate actions taken by incumbent firms 
to discourage or prevent entry. The analysis of entry barriers has shifted from 
the simple classification developed by Bain (1956) to complex models of strate-
gic behaviour which incorporate threats and irreversible commitments (Dixit, 
1982). Irreversible commitments involve an incumbent making sunk cost 
investments that cannot be recovered in the event of subsequent withdrawal 
from the market. By raising barriers to exit in this way, an incumbent can signal 
its intention to stick around and fight to preserve its market share. The signal 
may in itself be sufficient to deter a potential entrant from proceeding.
■ Product differentiation refers to the characteristics of the product. How similar 
is each firm’s product to those of rival firms? To what extent is each firm’s 
product unique? Any change in the characteristics of the product supplied by 
one firm, whether real or imagined, may affect the shares of the total market 
demand that each firm is able to command.
■ Vertical integration and diversification. Vertical integration refers to the extent 
to which a firm is involved in different stages of the same production process. 
Diversified firms produce a variety of goods or services for several distinct 
markets. The extent to which a firm is vertically integrated or diversified is 
likely to have implications for conduct and performance. Vertically integrated 
firms have greater certainty in obtaining supplies of raw materials, or guaran-
teed distribution outlets. They have opportunities to engage in certain types 
of anticompetitive practice (vertical restraints), which may be damaging to 
non-integrated rivals. Diversified firms may benefit from economies of scope, 
and are less exposed to risk than their non-diversified counterparts, because 
losses realised in one market can be offset against profits earned elsewhere. 
In the long run, of course, firms make their own choices concerning vertical 
integration and diversification; therefore, in the long run these can also be 
interpreted as conduct variables.
Conduct
Conduct refers to the behaviour of firms, conditioned, according to the SCP 
paradigm, by the industry’s structural characteristics identified above. Conduct 
variables include the following:
■ Business objectives. The objectives that firms pursue often derive from struc-
tural characteristics of the industry, in particular the firm size distribution. The 
neoclassical theory of the firm assumes profit maximization; while managerial 
theories, developed primarily with large corporations in mind, emphasise the 
maximization of non-profit objectives such as sales revenue, growth or manage-
rial utility (Baumol, 1959; Williamson, 1963; Marris, 1964).

10	
|	 1    ■    Industrial organization: an introduction 
■ Pricing policies. The extent of a firm’s discretion to determine its own price 
depends to a large extent on the industry’s structural characteristics. Possible 
pricing policies include cost plus pricing, marginal cost pricing, entry-deterring 
pricing, predatory pricing, price leadership and price discrimination (Phlips, 
1983). For oligopolists, in particular, it may be imperative to avoid direct price 
competition leading to mutually destructive price wars.
■ Product design, branding, advertising and marketing. Natural or inherent char-
acteristics of the firm’s basic product are likely to influence the scope for 
non-price competition centred on product design, branding, advertising and 
marketing. Although product differentiation is cited above as a structural 
characteristic, to some extent this is an oversimplification: the extent of prod-
uct differentiation is at least partly endogenous, influenced or determined by 
strategies consciously implemented by incumbent firms.
■ Research and development. Together with advertising and marketing, invest-
ment in research and development provides an outlet for non-price com-
petition between rival firms. The extent and effectiveness of research and 
development investment, and the pace of diffusion (the speed at which a new 
idea is adopted by firms other than the original innovator), are critical deter-
minants of the pace of technological progress (Kamien and Schwartz, 1982).
■ Collusion. Another option open to firms wishing to avoid direct forms of price 
or non-price competition is to collude with one another, so as to reach col-
lective decisions concerning prices, output levels, advertising or research and 
development budgets. Collusion may be either explicit (through an arrange-
ment such as a cartel), or implicit or tacit (through a less formal agreement or 
understanding).
■ Merger. Horizontal mergers (between firms producing the same or similar 
products) have direct implications for seller concentration in the industry 
concerned. Vertical mergers (between firms at successive stages of a produc-
tion process) affect the degree of vertical integration. Conglomerate mergers 
(between firms producing different products) affect the degree of diversifica-
tion. Therefore, each type of merger decision provides an example of a con-
duct variable that has a feedback effect on market or industry structure.
Performance
Important indicators of performance, the final component of the SCP trichot-
omy, include the following:
■ Profitability. The neoclassical theory assumes that high or abnormal profits are 
the result of the abuse of market power by incumbent firms. On the other hand, 
it has also been argued by the Chicago school (see further text) that abnor-
mal profit may be the consequence of cost advantages or superior productive 
efficiency on the part of certain firms, which have consequently been able to 
achieve monopoly status by cutting price and driving rivals out of business. If 
this is the case, it is not obvious that market power and abnormal profit should 

	
	
	
1.3  The structure–conduct–performance paradigm	 |	
11
be viewed as detrimental to consumer interests. Similarly, according to the 
Schumpeterian and Austrian views, abnormal profit is a reward for successful 
past innovation, or the exercise of superior foresight or awareness by an entre-
preneur. To the extent that profitability influences firms’ decisions to continue 
or exit from a market, this performance indicator has direct implications for 
future structure (the number and size distribution of sellers).
■ Growth. Profitability is a suitable performance indicator for a profit-­
maximizing firm, but may be less relevant for a firm that pursues other objec-
tives, such as sales, growth or managerial utility. Growth of sales, assets or 
employment might represent a useful alternative performance indicator, by 
which the performance over any period of firms that were unequal in size at 
the start of the period can be compared.
■ Quality of products and service might be considered an important perfor-
mance indicator by individual consumers or consumer groups, regulators or 
governments.
■ Technological progress is a consequence of the level of investment in research 
and development, and the pace of technological progress may be considered 
a relevant performance indicator. In the long run, technological progress 
produces perhaps the most fundamental type of feedback effect shown in 
­Figure 1.1, due to its impact on the basic conditions of demand (consumer 
tastes and preferences change when new products are introduced) and supply 
(technology and cost structures change when new and more efficient produc-
tion processes are developed).
■ Productive and allocative efficiency. Productive efficiency refers to the extent 
to which a firm achieves the maximum technologically feasible output from 
a given combination of inputs, and whether it chooses the most cost-effective 
combination of inputs to produce a given level of output. Allocative efficiency 
refers to whether social welfare is maximised at the market equilibrium. Pro-
ductive and allocative efficiency are both regarded by economists as important 
performance indicators.
The role of government policy
As Figure 1.1 suggests, government policy can operate on structure, conduct and 
performance variables. According to the SCP paradigm, if an industry comprises 
only a few large firms, the abuse of market power is likely to lead to the level of 
output being restricted, and prices being raised. This stifling of competition is 
likely to have damaging implications for consumer welfare. This suggests there 
is a role for government or regulatory intervention to promote competition and 
prevent abuses of market power.
■ Competition might be promoted by preventing a horizontal merger involv-
ing two large firms from taking place, or by requiring the break-up of a large 
incumbent producer into two or more smaller firms. Such measures operate 
directly on market or industry structure.

Box 1.1
Contributors to the development of industrial 
organization
This box gives a brief account of 16 key contributors to the development and shape of 
industrial organization, in chronological order. Their writings cover a wide range of 
topics in economics, and it is impossible to distil all of their ideas into a few sentences. 
This box focuses on their key contributions to industrial organization. In several cases, 
these contributions drew on the ideas of other, lesser-known past or contemporary 
economists.
Adam Smith (1723–90)
Adam Smith is widely regarded as the father of modern economics. Many of his key ideas 
are found in his book The Wealth of Nations (1776). Smith believed that through the exer-
cise of self-interest and competition, the market would produce just the right amount of 
goods to satisfy both consumers and producers. They would be led, as if by an ‘invisible 
hand’, to maximise the welfare of both. Smith lived at a time when new inventions, such 
as the flying shuttle and the spinning jenny, were revolutionising manufacturing; and he 
believed that economic growth could be achieved through mechanization and the division 
of labour. The division of labour is illustrated by means of a description of Smith’s visit 
to a Nottinghamshire pin factory. Ten workers, by dividing the tasks of manufacturing 
a pin, could produce 2,000 times as many pins as one worker performing all of the tasks. 
Smith also advocated control over monopolies and restrictive practices, which he viewed 
as unconducive to good management and free trade, and likely to lead to a misallocation 
of resources.
■ Intervention might instead be targeted directly at influencing conduct. A regu-
lator might impose price controls, preventing a firm with market power from 
setting a profit-maximizing monopoly price. Legal restrictions on permissible 
forms of collusion might be strengthened, or punishments for unlawful collu-
sion might be increased.
■ Finally, a wide range of government policy measures (fiscal policy, employ-
ment policy, environmental policy, macroeconomic policy and so on) may 
have implications for firms’ performance, measured using indicators such as 
profitability, growth, productive or allocative efficiency.
Box 1.1 provides a brief account of some of the important contributors to the 
development of industrial organization. Case Study  1.1 provides an applica-
tion of the structure–conduct–performance paradigm to the European banking 
industry.

Augustin Cournot (1801–77)
Cournot was a French mathematician, who applied his skills to economic ideas and wrote 
a major contribution to economics, Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théo-
rie des richesses (1838) (known as The Researches). He was the first economist to develop 
the concept of the downward-sloping demand curve which, when combined with supply, 
determines a market equilibrium. He was also instrumental in identifying variable and 
fixed costs, and in defining marginal cost, marginal revenue and profit maximization. 
Although he contributed much to the formulation of the theories of perfect competition 
and monopoly, he is best known for the development of the duopoly model, a precursor to 
future developments in oligopoly theory. Cournot argued that the output decision of one 
firm affects the market price, which then leads to the rival reacting with its own output 
decision. This reaction, in turn, causes a further adjustment to the output decision of the 
first firm, and so on. An equilibrium is achieved when neither firm can improve its profit 
through further output adjustments.
Alfred Marshall (1842–1924)
Marshall was highly instrumental in establishing economics as an academic discipline. 
Prior to 1903, when Marshall established a degree in economic science at Cambridge, 
economics had been taught in conjunction with moral philosophy and history. Marshall’s 
Principles of Economics (1890) established many of the methods and concepts still in use 
today. Although not the first to do so, Marshall identified the laws of demand and supply, 
linking them in the now familiar Marshallian Cross diagram. He also developed concepts 
such as price elasticity of demand (noting the important effect of substitute goods), con-
sumer surplus and quasi-rents. In Industry and Trade (1870) he recognised the power of 
monopolies, moderated by competition and the contribution of enthusiastic new manag-
ers. However, Marshall did not provide a formal analysis of perfect competition, other 
than as a driver for the equality of price with unit cost of production. Although a good 
mathematician, having studied maths at Cambridge, he relegated most of his mathemati-
cal analysis to appendices in order to make his books accessible to business managers and 
informed laypersons.
Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950)
Schumpeter is famous for two contributions to economics on macroeconomic cycles, and 
the role of innovation in capitalist economies. In his early years he developed the theory 
that the level of innovation, so important to the growth of an economy, is determined 
from within the firm by risk-taking entrepreneurs. Since consumers are naturally con-
servative, their preferences do not lead directly to the supply of new goods and services; 
instead, the firm attempts to shape and alter consumer tastes so as to create demand for 
new products. These ideas were further refined in his book Capitalism, Socialism and 
Democracy (1942), in which he argued that the process of ‘creative destruction’ provides 
a powerful dynamic underpinning the growth and development of capitalism. Firms 

14	
|	 1    ■    Industrial organization: an introduction 
and the economy grow and prosper not only because of successful innovation, but also 
because weak, inefficient firms are rooted out and destroyed by their innovative com-
petitors. Schumpeter recognised that as successful firms grow, they become increasingly 
reliant on a professional class of technocratic managers charged with running what are 
increasingly complex and bureaucratic organizations. Professional managers tend to be 
risk-averse, and not imbued with the entrepreneurial spirit. Pessimistically, Schumpeter 
believed accordingly that the dynamic of innovation and the development of the capitalist 
economy are destined to stagnate in the long term.
Edward Chamberlin (1899–1967)
Chamberlin taught economics at Harvard (1937–67) and was responsible for important 
contributions to microeconomics, especially areas of competition theory and consumer 
choice. In explaining how a producer in a competitive market can set a price higher than 
perfect competition will allow, he first introduced the term ‘product differentiation’. His 
PhD thesis, The Theory of Monopolistic Competition, was later revised and published in 
1933. Prior to this, mainstream economists had focused on the polar cases of perfect com-
petition and monopoly, ignoring market structures occupying the large middle ground. 
Chamberlin argued that few markets are truly competitive. He identified two intermedi-
ate market structures. The first was the small group case, where firms choose between 
myopic competition and the ability to achieve joint profit maximization. The second was 
the large group case, where firms strive to alter consumers’ perceptions by differentiat-
ing their products from each other, allowing the opportunity to charge a higher price or 
increase market share. Chamberlin’s analysis was influential in the development of the 
structure–conduct–performance paradigm in industrial organization.
Edward Mason (1899–1992)
Mason was a Harvard Economist who founded the Harvard Institute for International 
Development. He served as the Dean of the Littauer School at Harvard 1947 and 1958. 
Mason is often identified as the founder of industrial organization. He advanced under-
standing of modern industries by measuring and explaining the fundamentals of industry 
structures. This he asserted was a much more complex endeavour than the stylised ver-
sions of market structure used in textbook models of perfect competition and monopoly, 
and instead necessitated an in-depth exploration of the underlying characteristics of par-
ticular industry and how these might affect the decisions taken by business owners and 
ultimately the performance of firms. Mason’s case study approach inspired a generation 
of economists including Joseph Bain.
Joan Robinson (1903–83)
Robinson was a Cambridge economist who helped to shape some of Keynes’ (1936) 
ideas in the General Theory. Her principal contribution to industrial organization, The 
Economics of Imperfect Competition, was published in 1933, almost simultaneously 

	
	
	
1.3  The structure–conduct–performance paradigm	 |	
15
with Chamberlin’s The Theory of Monopolistic Competition. Using the concept of mar-
ginal revenue Robinson argued that in imperfect competition, firms faced downward-
sloping marginal revenue functions. If they reduce their prices, they may eventually 
face a fall in total revenue if marginal revenue is zero or negative. The only logical 
response would then be to reduce production. In industries characterised by imper-
fect competition, there may be an underutilization of resources, notably labour. A 
new theory of price determination was required for imperfect markets. Unlike per-
fect competition, oligopolies are able to set markup prices above their variable costs. 
The less intense the competition and the greater the demand for internal funding for 
growth, the greater the markup. Robinson argued that the concept of equilibrium, as 
suggested by supply and demand analysis, is unsuitable for explaining the dynamics 
of imperfect markets.
John Von Neumann (1903–57)
Von Neumann, a Hungarian–American mathematician, was involved in several fields of 
study, including quantum mechanics, computers, geometry and statistics. In economics 
he is primarily identified with the development of game theory. After studying Walrasian 
supply and demand equations based on an interplay of calculus and classical mechanics, 
von Neumann argued that this analysis failed to address the issue of interdependence 
between agents: each agent’s decisions have implications for other agents. Game theory 
addresses this shortcoming in economic theory. In the context of industrial organization, 
game theory is the study of the choices faced by firms in the pursuit of their optimal 
outcomes. In 1944, with the help of his colleague Oskar Morgenstern, von Neumann 
developed a formal analysis based on two players, decision sets and payoff matrices, 
enabling each player to calculate his best course of action or strategy. Von Neumann 
extended the analysis to games involving more than two players, with relevance for the 
theory of oligopoly.
Ronald Coase (1910–2013)
The British economist Coase, resident in the US for 60 years, made a key contribution 
to the field of industrial organization in a seminal article, ‘The nature of the firm’ (1937), 
while still studying as an undergraduate at London University. The article explains why 
organizations known as firms are formed to coordinate resource allocation decisions, 
instead of individuals relying on market transactions coordinated via the price mecha-
nism. Coase argued that when the transactions executed using market mechanisms prove 
costly, producers seek to reduce these costs by allocating resources internally by ‘diktat’, 
rather than by relying on the price mechanism. Firms exist, therefore, to internalise mar-
ket transactions. Examples of transaction costs that arise when using markets to allocate 
resources include search and information costs, bargaining costs that become onerous 
owing to contractual complexity, and the costs of monitoring compliance with the terms 
of market transactions. Coase’s article was the forerunner of a new branch of indus-
trial organization and management strategy known as transaction cost economics. 

16	
|	 1    ■    Industrial organization: an introduction 
Coase’s other major contribution to economics was in the field of social costs resulting 
from externalities. Coase’s seminal article, ‘The problem of social cost’ (1960) described 
externalities as arising from the costs of transacting over rights to undertake actions that 
affect others. High transaction costs inhibit the internalization of social costs, and so 
increase the impact of externalities.
George Stigler (1911–91)
Based at the University of Chicago, Stigler’s main contribution to industrial organiza-
tion was in the areas of the economics of information and oligopoly theory. He also 
contributed much to the analysis of barriers to entry, economies of scale, antitrust 
issues and the measurement of industrial concentration. The economics of informa-
tion focuses on price dispersion found in many markets, though it could be applied to 
almost any other variable present in a market transaction. Economic theory suggests 
that over time, price discrepancies should iron themselves out and if they do not, the 
fault lies with market imperfections. Stigler pointed out that market information is 
costly to collect and disseminate. Buyers may consider that seeking the lowest price 
is not worth their time and effort. Another important contribution, in the area of 
oligopoly theory, was also concerned with the dissemination of price information. 
Firms’ sales are not only affected by their rivals’ price changes but also by changes 
in the market. The time it takes for a firm to unravel these effects and respond has 
important implications for the functioning of markets. Stigler is known for develop-
ing the theory of regulatory capture, which describes the tendency for producers and 
other interest groups to attempt to gain control over regulatory arrangements, so as 
to reshape them in their own interests.
Joseph Bain (1912–91)
Bain was a Harvard economist, and a key figure in the development of industrial organi-
zation as an important subfield within economics. The American Economic Association 
described him as the ‘father of modern Industrial Organization’. His major contribution 
was the development, with Edwin Mason (his PhD supervisor), of the structure, conduct 
and performance (SCP) paradigm, which argues that industry structure indicators such 
as the level of concentration, the degree of product differentiation and entry conditions 
are key determinants of firm or industry performance indicators such as profitability, 
efficiency and technological change. Bain introduced new concepts, such as the classi-
fication of entry barriers, potential competition and limit pricing. He regarded product 
differentiation, notably advertising, as the most potent of entry barriers, enabling firms to 
develop market power and maintain high prices. He also contributed much to the devel-
opment of empirical research methodologies for testing hypotheses derived from the SCP 
paradigm. An important innovation was the examination of cross-country variation in 
structure and performance indicators for the same industry, used as a means of verifying 
SCP relationships.

Herbert Simon (1916–2001)
Simon is best known in economics for his research into decision-making in the modern 
organization, and the introduction of the term ‘bounded rationality’. In his 1947 book, 
Administrative Behavior, he argued that economic optimization was an impossible goal. 
If managers were to make rational decisions they had to identify all possible alternatives, 
determine their consequences and calculate the impact of such consequences. He suggested 
an alternative approach, known as ‘satisficing’, whereby managers search for actions that 
achieve reasonable rather than optimum payoffs. These fresh insights into organizations 
were influential in the development of the behavioural theory of the firm. Simon later sug-
gested that both economics and psychology could contribute to understanding decision-
making in an organization. Simon’s scientific interests extended to several other fields, 
including cognitive psychology, computer science and artificial intelligence.
William Baumol (1922– )
Baumol, a Princeton economist, has written widely on many topics. His articles and 
books cover areas as diverse as the transactions demand for money, the labour market, 
the service industries and the history of economic thought. His contribution to industrial 
organization is focused on the theory of the firm, contestable markets, regulation and 
various industry studies. An early contribution to the theory of the firm was the sales rev-
enue maximization hypothesis, based on his observation and experience as a consultant 
to many US corporations. Baumol argues that because of the divorce of ownership from 
control, managers in control of large corporations are attracted to the maximization of 
total revenue, which determines their remuneration and status. This objective is subject to 
a minimum profit constraint sufficient to placate shareholders. The theory of contestable 
markets, which Baumol developed with his colleagues John Panzar and Robert Willig 
(1982), is based on the idea that firms operating in highly concentrated market structures 
may nevertheless behave competitively if the industry is characterised by low entry and 
exit barriers. Incumbents are, in effect, constrained from exercising their market power 
by the presence of potential rather than actual competitors.
John Nash (1928–2015)
Nash completed a PhD in mathematics at Princeton in 1950. This work contained his 
major contribution to economics in the field of game theory: the derivation of an equi-
librium solution for non-cooperative games. In a Nash equilibrium, taking the other 
players’ current actions as given, no player can improve his own payoff by changing his 
own actions. He demonstrated that a Nash equilibrium exists for a broad class of games, 
provided players are allowed to adopt mixed strategies whereby they choose randomly 
from several actions, with a specific probability assigned to each action. The Nash equi-
librium bears close affinities to the solution to the duopoly model that was proposed 
by Cournot more than a century before. One of the best known examples of a Nash 
equilibrium is the prisoner’s dilemma, where two players recognise the strategies that 

18	
|	 1    ■    Industrial organization: an introduction 
will lead to an optimal outcome for both and yet, rationally, select strategies leading to 
a suboptimal outcome. Another key contribution to economics was Nash’s discussion of 
the bargaining problem, concerning the utility-maximizing division of the gains from a 
bargain between two parties. Nash’s contributions as a mathematician and game theorist 
also found important applications in fields as diverse as computing, evolutionary biology, 
politics and military strategy.
Harold Demsetz (1930–)
Another member of the Chicago school, Demsetz has contributed much to the theory 
of the firm, the theory of property rights and antitrust policy. In developing some of 
the ideas introduced by Coase, Demsetz argued that the act of assigning and enforcing 
a property right bears a cost. Property rights will be assigned if the gains outweigh the 
costs. For example, the Montagne Indians of Quebec established property rights over 
beavers when the fur trade became profitable during the eighteenth century, internalizing 
the externality created by hunting. The hunting of grazing animals with little commercial 
value continued without the creation of property rights, however, because the limited 
gains from internalization would have been outweighed by the high costs of tracking 
the animals. The existence of clearly defined and marketable property rights, whether 
imposed by government or through ‘promises’ made by individuals, leads to efficient 
markets. Another important contribution was Demsetz’s extension of transaction cost 
analysis. Demsetz extended the scope of transaction cost economics by examining market 
frictions that can occur independently of organizational structure.
Oliver Williamson (1932–)
Williamson’s major contribution is the development of transaction cost economics (TCE), 
which he first outlined in 1975. This approach has had a great influence not only in eco-
nomics, but also in organization theory and contract law. Williamson was concerned with 
the problem of market failure in markets that had, traditionally, been assumed always to 
adjust towards equilibrium. This analysis led him to investigate many topics in economics, 
including market structure, monopoly, vertical integration and public utility regulation. 
TCE was constructed on the triad of opportunism, bounded rationality and asset speci-
ficity. Opportunism refers to what happens when certain players in a market, motivated 
by self-interest, are dishonest and willing to exploit other players. Bounded rationality 
refers to decision-makers having only limited information regarding the environment in 
which they operate, most likely concerning the activities closest to their own sphere of 
operations. This situation gives rise to uncertainty and the possibility of taking incorrect 
decisions that may prove costly. Asset specificity refers to the value of a productive asset 
being greater in a certain application than in others. This tends to bind the seller and the 
buyer of the asset together, giving either or both the chance to engage in opportunistic 
behaviour. A solution might be to pursue a strategy of vertical integration, so that the 
integrated firm economises on the transaction costs that otherwise arise when the seller 
and buyer are separate entities.

Case study 1.1
Structure, conduct and performance in  
European banking
The banking system is of central strategic importance for economic growth, capital alloca-
tion, financial stability, and the competitiveness and development of the manufacturing 
and service sectors. The nature of competition in European banking has changed signifi-
cantly since 1990. Following deregulation (via the Second Banking Directive), the cre-
ation of the EU single market in financial services, and the launch of the euro, barriers to 
trade in financial services have been significantly reduced. Banks are able to trade not only 
in their own countries but also elsewhere throughout Europe. Banks have increased the 
range of products and services they offer to customers, leading to the distinction between 
banks, building societies, insurance companies and other financial institutions becoming 
blurred. The arrival of foreign-owned banks in many European banking markets has 
caused competition to intensify. Furthermore, a wide range of non-bank institutions, 
including supermarkets and telecommunications firms, now offer financial products and 
services as well. This has placed additional pressure on established banks to lower costs, 
limit their risk exposures, improve their management and governance structures, and 
find new ways of generating revenues from new forms of banking business (Goddard 
et al., 2007, 2010, 2015).
Since the 2000s, the European banking industry has been subject to major shocks 
including the turmoil following the US sub-prime crisis in 2007–08, and the more recent 
European sovereign debt crisis. The former led to large losses and the failure and closure 
of many banks, and forced large-scale interventions by central banks and governments 
on an unprecedented scale.
Structure
During the period 1990–2011, there was a decline in the number of banks trading in most 
European countries. This trend is similar for mutual savings banks, cooperative banks 
and commercial banks. Table 1.1 shows data on the total number of banks (domestic 
and foreign-owned) trading in selected European countries in various years. Over the 
same period, branch numbers have also declined, as banks have sought to rationalise 
their branch networks.
This is part of an overall trend towards consolidation in financial services, which has 
been accompanied by an increase in seller concentration. Table 1.1 indicates that banking 
industry concentration has increased in the majority of countries. Domestic consolidation 
has been a prominent feature of this trend. In 2011, seller concentration measured by the 
five-firm concentration ratio (the share of the five largest banks in the total assets of the 
banking industry) exceeded 60 per cent in Belgium, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, 
Portugal, Finland and Sweden. Concentration has also increased, but has remained at 
lower levels, in Italy, Germany and the UK.

1.3  The structure–conduct–performance paradigm	 |	
21
However, the number of foreign-owned banks trading in every country included in 
Table 1.1 increased over the period, leading to an intensification of competition. There 
are several ways in which a bank might operate across national borders within an inte-
grated European banking market. The bank might establish either a branch or a sub-
sidiary in another European state; or it might provide banking services directly (without 
establishment) across national borders. The bank might enter into a strategic partnership 
with an institution in another state; or it might locate different functions in different 
states. Recent years have seen the emergence of several large cross-border institutions 
within the EU.
Conduct
In response to competitive pressure (brought about by the entry of foreign banks and 
new financial services providers), many banks have consolidated by means of merger 
and acquisition. This strategy has enabled some banks to achieve the large size (or criti-
cal mass) required to operate effectively throughout the European single market. Recent 
mergers between large banks from different EU member states suggest an increased 
propensity for large cross-border mergers. Examples of significant cross-border mergers 
include Unicredit (Italy) and HVB (Germany); Credit Agricole (France) and Emporiki 
(Greece); BNP Paribas (France) and Banco Nazionale de Lavaro (Italy); and Banco 
Santander (Spain) and Alliance and Leicester (UK). This suggests that barriers to 
cross-border mergers arising from difficulties in selling generic products across borders, 
differences in competition, employment, regulatory and supervisory policy across coun-
tries, political interference, and a lack of consumer trust in foreign banks are diminish-
ing. Major cross-border banking groups have adapted their organizational structures, 
risk management and strategic planning functions to deal with pan-European activity 
in a range of areas, including traditional commercial banking as well as treasury and 
trading activities.
Many banks have also implemented strategies of product diversification and financial 
innovation. Examples include online share dealing, letters of credit, pensions and insur-
ance, and a wide range of investment services. For European banks, revenue from non-
interest-bearing business as a proportion of the total revenue increased from 28 per cent 
in 1992 to over 50 per cent in 2009.
Performance
Commercial banks traditionally depended upon interest margins as the main driver of 
profits. Profitability depended on banks’ ability to maintain a sizeable gap between inter-
est income and interest cost, while attempting to maximise operational efficiency. As 
banking systems were liberalised, competition in loan and deposit markets intensified. 
This was an observable trend from the early 1980s to the early 2000s in many European 

22

countries. Reductions in margins encouraged banks to supplement their income (where 
possible) by diversifying into non-interest income, or non-traditional areas such as insur-
ance and securities underwriting.
While the contribution of non-interest revenue to total revenue has risen, technologi-
cal innovation has substantially reduced the costs associated with the collection, storage, 
processing and transmission of data, and transformed the means whereby customers gain 
access to banking services and products.
As perhaps one might expect, substantial variations in European bank profitability 
exist. Table 1.2, highlights the relatively low profitability of German banks during the 
early and mid-2000s, when banks in Belgium, Sweden and UK enjoyed relatively high 
profits. Differences in profitability between countries have been attributed to a variety 
of factors including: variation in accounting and tax systems; structural factors such as 
the intensity of competition in specific product segments; the extent of product and geo-
graphic diversification; and business cycle effects
Table 1.2 shows that the average profitability (measured by return on equity) of banks 
in most European countries improved between 1990 and 2006, but declined sharply dur-
ing the financial crisis of 2007–9. Overall competition between banks, and between banks 
and other financial service providers, has become more intense. Deregulation and tech-
nological progress have lowered entry barriers, making banking more highly competitive. 
At the same time, as a consequence of continued consolidation the proportion of industry 
assets held by the largest banks has increased.
The global financial crisis and regulation
The failure in 2007 of Northern Rock, a UK retail bank, preceded a serious financial 
crisis that afflicted the banking industry worldwide, but most notably in the US and 
many western European countries. Many banks, both large and small, incurred heavy 
losses and defaults on their loans portfolios, resulting in numerous bank failures and 
rescues through the intervention of central banks and governments. Initial responses 
to the financial crisis of 2007–9 included: government purchase of distressed assets 
(loans made by banks that are unlikely to be repaid, or loans on which the borrower 
has already defaulted); changes to the rules concerning the types of asset accepted as 
collateral; nationalization or part-nationalization of financial institutions considered 
too-big-to-fail; and government guarantees of consumer deposits and bank liabilities. 
Factors widely cited as having contributed to the financial crisis include: global imbal-
ances in trade and capital flows; excessively expansionary monetary policy; misalign-
ment of the incentives facing investors, banks and credit-rating agencies; inadequate 
financial disclosure and the adoption of inappropriate accounting rules; lax lending stan-
dards; loopholes in regulation and supervision; and individual fraud. Signs of recovery 
in the banking industry have been apparent since 2009. However, a series of banking or 
­sovereign debt crises afflicted several European countries (most notably Greece, Ireland, 
Italy, Portugal and Spain).

European governments responded to the 2007–9 financial crisis by: expanding the 
scope of bank regulation based on economic substance rather than legal form; requiring 
banks to hold more capital (to serve as a buffer to absorb future losses); enhancing regu-
lation and supervision of bank liquidity; introducing more prescriptive codes of conduct 
for executive remuneration and benefits; improving arrangements for regulation of the 
activities of cross-border banks; and reforming accounting rules concerning financial 
disclosure. Large European banks are subject to new arrangements for macro- and micro-
prudential supervision, including a new European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) to moni-
tor and assess systemic risks in the EU financial system.
In June 2012 the European Council launched proposals to create a European Bank-
ing Union (EBU), comprising three pillars. The first pillar involves a transfer of 
supervisory responsibilities for 123 banks deemed to be ‘significant’, from national 
supervisors to a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) operated by the European 
Central Bank. The UK, along with Sweden, declined to participate in the SSM, which 
became operational in November 2014. The second pillar of EBU, a pan-European 
resolution mechanism, aims to provide for the orderly shutdown of non-viable banks, 
so minimizing the likelihood of taxpayer-funded bank bailouts. The third pillar is the 
creation of a European deposit insurance scheme that would operate, alongside the 
resolution fund, under a common resolution authority. In 2016, a UK referendum 
led to an unexpected vote to leave the European Union. At the time of writing it is 
unclear what the implications of this vote are for the future configuration of Euro-
pean banking.
In common with the Austrian school, the Chicago school argues vehemently 
against government intervention in markets in order to promote competition 
(Reder, 1982). The Chicago school is a group of prominent academic lawyers 
and economists, whose pro-market, pro-competition and anti-government 
views were perhaps at their most influential during the 1970s and 1980s. The 
Chicago school is identified with the argument that large firms are likely to 
have become large as a result of having operated efficiently, and therefore 
more profitably, than their smaller counterparts. Therefore, punishing the 
largest firms because they are also the most profitable firms is tantamount to 
punishing success. Even if certain abuses of market power do take place in the 
short run, these are likely to be self-correcting in the long run, when competi-
tion will tend to reassert itself. For example, there is little point in passing laws 
against collusive agreements, since such agreements are inherently unstable 
and are liable to break down in the fullness of time (Posner, 1979). Markets 
and industries have a natural tendency to revert towards competition under 
their own steam, without the need for any intervention or assistance from 
government.
The strident views of the Chicago school have not gone unchallenged. Blaug 
(2001), for example, accuses the Chicago school of promoting ideology rather 
than science.

	
	
	
1.3  The structure–conduct–performance paradigm	 |	
25
The Chicago school does not deny that there is a case for antitrust law 
but they doubt that it is a strong case because most markets, even in 
the presence of high concentration ratios, are ‘contestable’. How do we 
know? We know because of the good-approximation assumption: the 
economy is never far away from its perfectly competitive equilibrium 
growth path! Believe it or not, that is all there is to the ‘antitrust 
revolution’ of the Chicago school.
(Blaug, 2001, p. 47)
Beyond structure–conduct–performance
Although the SCP paradigm was highly influential in the early development of 
industrial organization as a subdiscipline within economics, SCP has been subject 
to fierce criticism from a number of different directions. Below, we provide a 
checklist of criticisms of the SCP paradigm. Many of these points recur, and will 
be examined in greater depth, in later chapters of this book.
■ The SCP paradigm draws heavily on microeconomic theory and the neoclassi-
cal theory of the firm. However, the theory does not always specify precise rela-
tionships between structure, conduct and performance variables. For example, 
oligopoly theory is largely indeterminate, and sometimes fails to produce clear 
and unambiguous conclusions.
■ It is often difficult to decide which variables belong to structure, which to 
conduct and which to performance. For example, product differentiation, ver-
tical integration and diversification are structure variables, but they are also 
strategies that firms can consciously choose to adopt, and can therefore also 
be interpreted as conduct variables.
■ What exactly do we mean by performance? Performance is some measure of 
the degree of success in achieving desired goals. Is it possible to have a set of 
uniform performance indicators? Differences between the objectives of dif-
ferent firms may render SCP relationships tenuous. For example, if firms are 
sacrificing potential profits in order to reduce risk by making more secure 
investments, researchers should be more concerned with variability in profit-
ability than with the profit rate as such (Schwartzman, 1963).
■ As indicated above, the definition of market or industry structure has a num-
ber of dimensions. However, many empirical studies based on the SCP para-
digm measure structure solely by seller concentration. This is mainly because 
concentration is easier to measure than other dimensions of structure, such 
as entry barriers and product differentiation. Consequently, there is a danger 
of overemphasizing the role of concentration. More generally, many of the 
variables in all three categories of structure, conduct and performance are 
difficult to measure (Grabowski and Mueller, 1970). How do we quantify the 
degree of vertical integration in an industry? How do we quantify the extent 
of collusion, or how do we even know if collusion is taking place? How do we 
measure the pace of technological progress? How do we determine whether 
firms are achieving maximum productive efficiency?

26	
|	 1    ■    Industrial organization: an introduction 
We have concentration measures for most manufacturing markets in 
many economies for instance, but little comprehensive information is 
available on more subtle aspects of market structure, and essentially no 
systematic data aside from accounting profit rates is available on conduct 
and performance. This leaves a factual vacuum in policy debates that is 
quickly filled by beliefs and assumptions.
(Schmalensee, 1990, p. 138)
■ Empirical research based on the SCP paradigm often finds associations in the 
anticipated direction between structure, conduct and performance variables. 
However, such relationships are often quite weak in terms of their statistical 
significance. Much of the early SCP literature examines the relationship between 
industry structure and performance, taking conduct as given. For example, in 
industries with only a few large firms, collusion was simply assumed to take place.
■ The SCP paradigm has been criticised for overemphasizing static models of 
short-run equilibrium (Sawyer, 1985). No explanation is offered as to the evo-
lution of the structure variables, and the influence of current conduct and 
performance on future structure. This criticism echoes the earlier discussion 
of feedback links within the SCP framework. At best the SCP paradigm is 
capable of providing only a snapshot picture of the industry and its constituent 
firms at one particular point in time.
■ Most early empirical research based on the SCP paradigm focused on the rela-
tionship between seller concentration and profitability. According to the collu-
sion hypothesis, a positive association between concentration and profitability 
was interpreted as evidence of collusion or other abuses of market power 
designed to enhance profits. Later researchers emphasised the possibility that 
high profitability was achieved through the exploitation of economies of scale, 
or other cost savings achieved by the managers of large firms. According to 
the efficiency hypothesis (closely identified with the Chicago school, discussed 
above), a positive relationship between concentration and profitability reflects 
a natural tendency for efficient firms to be successful, and to become domi-
nant in their industries. During the 1970s and 1980s, a large body of literature 
attempted to resolve the collusion-versus-efficiency debate using tests based 
on empirical data.
Several of these criticisms, especially the realization that a number of conduct 
and performance variables have feedback effects on structure, and that causality 
within SCP is a two-way and not just a one-way process, led eventually to a shift 
away from the presumption that structure is the most important determinant 
of the level of competition. Instead, some economists argued that the strategies 
(conduct) of individual firms were equally, if not more, important (Scherer and 
Ross, 1990). Theories that focus primarily on strategy and conduct are subsumed 
under the general heading of the new industrial organization (NIO) (Schmalensee, 
1982). According to this approach, firms are not seen as passive entities, similar 
in every respect except size. Instead they are active decision-makers, capable of 
implementing a wide range of diverse strategies. Game theory, which deals with 

	
	
	
1.4  Strategic management: a short diversion	 |	
27
decision-making in situations of interdependence and uncertainty, is an impor-
tant tool in the armoury of the NIO theorists. Theories have been developed to 
explore situations in which firms choose from a plethora of strategies, with the 
choices repeated over either finite or infinite time horizons. Some economists 
believe game theory has strengthened the theoretical underpinnings of indus-
trial organization (Tirole, 1988). Others, however, are highly critical of the game 
theoretic approach. Schmalensee (1990), for example, complains that just about 
‘anything can happen!’ when game theory is used to analyse competition:
Game theory has proven better at generating internally consistent 
scenarios than at providing plausible and testable restrictions on real 
behaviour . . . Until game-theoretic analysis begins to yield robust, 
unambiguous predictions or is replaced by a mode of theorizing that does 
so, any major substantive advances in industrial organization are likely 
to come from empirical research.
(Schmalensee, 1990, p. 141)
	
1.4	
Strategic management: a short diversion
A number of tools developed in the industrial organization literature have con-
tributed to the growth of the subdiscipline of strategic management. Highly influ-
ential in the early development of this literature is Porter (1979a, 1980, 1985, 
1996), whose five-forces model of the firm’s competitive environment is heavily 
influenced by SCP. Porter’s five forces are: the extent and intensity of competi-
tion; the threat of entrants (new competitors); the threat of substitute products 
and services; the power of buyers; and the power of suppliers. The five forces are 
illustrated schematically in Figure 1.3.

|	 1    ■    Industrial organization: an introduction 
■ Extent and intensity of competition. The intensity of competition depends on 
the number and size distribution of the industry’s incumbent firms. If there 
are large numbers of similarly sized firms, competition is expected to be more 
intense than it is if one or a few firms are dominant. Other influences on the 
extent of competition include the rate of growth of industry sales, incumbent 
firms’ cost structures, and the availability of spare capacity to meet potential 
increases in demand.
■ Threat of entrants. Incumbent firms that are threatened by entry behave differ-
ently to those in industries that are sheltered from competition. The perceived 
threat of entry is likely to be higher in industries where incumbents are highly 
profitable, and incumbents may search for ways of raising entry barriers. Gov-
ernment regulation also plays a part in determining the ease of entry. The size 
of the entry threat depends on the importance of economies of scale, the extent 
of product differentiation and brand loyalty, the level and specificity of capital 
investments, and the availability of access to distribution outlets.
■ Threat of substitute products and services. The availability of substitute prod-
ucts and services naturally tends to increase the intensity of competition. The 
availability of substitutes increases the price elasticity of demand for existing 
products, reducing the market power of incumbent firms. Incumbents may 
respond by seeking to differentiate their products more strongly from those 
of rivals, through branding or advertising. The attractiveness of substitute 
products to consumers depends on the prices and quality of the competing 
products, and the size of any switching costs.
■ Power of buyers. The power of buyers of a firm’s product depends on their 
number and size distribution, and their level of dependence on the firm’s out-
put. If there are only a few buyers, or if close substitutes are available, buyers 
are likely to wield significant market power. To secure their own supplies, 
large buyers may seek to integrate backwards (by taking over an input sup-
plier), reducing their reliance on external suppliers.
■ Power of suppliers. If suppliers of important inputs into a firm’s production process 
are large in size and small in number, these suppliers can exercise market power 
by raising price, reducing quality, or even threatening to withhold supplies.
Porter’s five forces identify the sources of competition that may confront a firm 
at any point in time. The firm’s strategies and conduct are conditioned by the pres-
ence and strength of the five forces. In common with the SCP paradigm, however, 
Porter’s approach is essentially static, and perhaps tends to underemphasise the 
problem of uncertainty caused by change in the competitive environment.
In contrast to many economists, management strategists tend to emphasise the 
distinctive internal characteristics of firms, in order to explain how a competitive 
advantage can be acquired and sustained. In the strategic management literature, 
the focus is on maximizing firm value through the choice of effective manage-
ment strategies, rather than minimizing or eliminating abnormal profit in pursuit 
of wider public policy goals (Spulber, 1992, 1994; Ghemawat, 2002). Competitive 
advantage is measured by the value a firm is able to create in excess of its costs. 
Porter (1980) introduces the concept of the value chain, which disaggregates the

firm into its strategically relevant activities. Primary activities are those associ-
ated with the physical creation of the product or service. Support activities are 
those that support primary activities and each other: for example, activities asso-
ciated with the purchase of inputs, the management of human resources or the 
improvement of technology through research and development. Once the firm’s 
activities are disaggregated in this way, appraisal of their individual contributions 
can begin. Each support activity is linked to each primary activity to a greater or 
lesser extent. This approach examines how these links can be improved in order 
to increase margins on each of the firm’s products.
Porter argues that a firm must select and follow a generic strategy in order to 
add value and gain a competitive advantage over rivals. Generic strategies include 
cost leadership, differentiation and focus. Under a cost leadership strategy, the 
firm attempts to keep its costs lower than those of competitors. The firm must 
be able to identify cost savings at some point in its value chain, or alternatively 
change the structure of the value chain; for example, by striking an exclusive deal 
with a supplier of an essential input. Under a differentiation strategy, the firm’s 
product has some unique characteristic that appeals to its customers, leading to 
higher margins and profits. Finally, focus can apply to both cost leadership and 
differentiation. The firm focuses its efforts on a particular market segment. In 
the case of differentiation, for example, this may involve identifying a particular 
group of customers and gearing the firm’s product towards its tastes or needs.
Kay (1993) argues that each individual firm is inherently different, and there-
fore dismisses the notion of generic strategies. Instead, firms develop distinctive 
capabilities in an attempt to achieve a competitive advantage. This shift of empha-
sis away from analysing the characteristics of the firm’s external environment, and 
towards examining each firm’s unique attributes and strategies, mirrors the shift 
of emphasis away from structure and towards conduct that is implicit in much 
of the NIO (new industrial organization) literature. According to Kay, the main 
sources of distinctive capability include innovation, architecture and reputation.
■ Innovation. Successful innovation provides a firm with advantages over its com-
petitors. However, this advantage only lasts for the time before imitation takes 
place. Even patents lapse eventually, or are vulnerable to being superseded by 
further technological change. Advantages from innovation can only be main-
tained if the firm has other capabilities that make imitation of the technology 
on its own insufficient to erode the firm’s competitive advantage.
■ Architecture. Architecture refers to the firm’s internal organization. For exam-
ple, Liverpool Football Club’s famous boot room, from which several coaches 
were promoted in succession to the position of team manager, ensured long 
periods of continuity and success throughout the 1970s and 1980s. If the mar-
ket changes, however, such advantages can be rapidly eliminated (Kay, 1993, 
2003). Arguably, Liverpool failed to adapt as successfully as rivals such as 
Arsenal and Manchester United to the internationalization of the footballers’ 
labour market that took place during the 1990s.
■ Reputation. If a firm has a reputation for providing good quality and service, 
this helps add value and generate sales. Once having been acquired, a positive 

30

reputation can be sustainable for long periods, making it difficult for entrants 
to compete on equal terms with a reputable incumbent.
According to the strategic management literature, the strategic choices and deci-
sions taken by firms are the main determinants of performance. Firms can only 
maintain a competitive advantage if they can protect their strategies from imita-
tion. The ease of imitation is influenced by institutional and economic factors. For 
example, restrictive employment contracts, which prevent individuals from using 
any firm-specific knowledge if they move to a rival firm, may help impede imita-
tion. An organization’s corporate culture may be important; for example, a firm 
that offers secure employment may obtain a greater level of commitment from its 
workforce than one that relies heavily on temporary workers. Some aspects of cor-
porate culture can be difficult for rivals to imitate. Economic factors affecting the 
speed of imitation include profitability and risk. Rapid imitation is more likely if the 
expected profitability from imitation is high, and if the risk is perceived to be low.
The strategic management literature provides many important insights into 
how firms can obtain and sustain competitive advantages over rivals. Some of 
these insights have been neglected in much of the industrial organization litera-
ture, especially in empirical studies. This is partly due to difficulties in quantifying 
key variables from the strategic management literature. The strategic management 
approach has been criticised for placing insufficient emphasis on the interactions 
between firms at the level of the market or industry. Instead, the focus is mainly 
on the strategic options available to the individual firm. In this sense, many of the 
insights derived from strategic management are complementary to those of the 
more traditional market-oriented microeconomic theory of the firm. This comple-
mentarity is reflected at a number of points throughout the course of this book.

Introduction
This chapter reviews the core elements of production and cost theory and demand 
theory. The chapter begins in Section 2.2 with a review of production and cost 
theory. A key distinction is drawn between the short run (when some inputs are 
variable and others are fixed) and the long run (when all inputs are variable). The 
short-run relationship between inputs, output and production costs is governed 
by the Law of Diminishing Returns, and the long-run relationship is governed by 
economies of scale or diseconomies of scale.
Section 2.3 reviews the essentials of demand theory, including price elastic-
ity of demand, a standard measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded 
to a change in price. Other elasticity measures, including cross-price elasticity 
of demand, advertising elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply, are 
defined. Finally, a very general rule for profit maximization is developed. The 
profit-maximizing firm should produce the output level at which its marginal 
revenue equals its marginal cost.
	
2.2	
Production and costs
Microeconomic theory assumes firms combine factor inputs through an effi-
cient method of production in order to produce output. Economists distinguish 
between factors of production that the firm can vary in the short run, and factors 
of production that cannot be varied in the short run but can vary in the long 
run. For example, by offering overtime to its current workforce or by hiring 
more workers, a firm might easily increase the amount of labour it employs in 
the short run; similarly, by reducing overtime or by laying workers off, a firm 
might easily reduce the amount of labour it employs. However, it is not pos-
sible for the firm to change the amount of capital it employs at short notice. 
New factories or offices take time to construct. New capital equipment has to 
be ordered in advance, and orders take time to be completed. Accordingly, for 
a firm that employs two factors of production, labour and capital, it is usual to 
assume labour is variable in the short run, and capital is fixed in the short run 
but variable in the long run.
A general expression for the long-run production function of a firm that uses a 
labour input and a capital input is as follows:
q = f (L, K)
where L = units of labour employed, K = units of capital employed and 
q = units of output produced.
In the short run, labour is variable and capital fixed. Accordingly, the expres-
sion for the firm’s short-run production function, obtained by rewriting the long-
run production function, is as follows:
q = g(L)

34	
|	 2    ■    Production, costs, demand and profit maximization
For example, if the long-run production function is q = f (L, K), but in the short 
run K is fixed at K = 100, the short-run production function is q = f (L, 100). 
By incorporating ‘K = 100’ into the structure of a newly defined function, the 
short-run production function can be rewritten q = g(L).
Short-run production and costs
Production theory
The short-run relationship between the quantity of labour employed and the 
quantity of output produced is governed by the Law of Diminishing Returns, 
sometimes alternatively known as the Law of Diminishing Marginal Product. 
As increasing quantities of labour are used in conjunction with a fixed quantity 
of capital, eventually the additional contribution that each successive unit of 
labour makes to total output starts to decline. The Law of Diminishing Returns 
is illustrated in Columns 1 to 4 of Table 2.1. According to Column 1, the firm 
can employ between L = 1 and L = 11 workers per week. Column 2 shows 
the total weekly output in each case. Column 3 shows the marginal product 
of labour (MPL). MPL is the quantity of additional output the firm obtains 
by employing each additional worker. If one worker is employed, L = 1 and 
q = 7. But if two workers are employed, L = 2 and q = 26. Effectively, the first 
worker contributes MPL = 7 units of output, but the second worker contributes 
MPL = 26 - 7 = 19 units. Similarly, if three workers are employed, L = 3 
and q = 54, so effectively the third worker contributes MPL = 54 - 26 = 28 
units. One worker can produce relatively little by themselves because the factory 
is severely understaffed. However, two workers combined are more effective 
than one in isolation, and three are more effective than two. This is reflected in 
Column 4, which shows the average product of labour (APL). APL is the ratio 
of total output to quantity of labour employed. As L increases from 1 to 2 to 3, 
APL increases from 7 to 13 to 18.
However, as more and more workers are employed, the point is eventually 
reached when each additional worker’s contribution to total output starts to 
fall. Once the full contingent of workers that the factory can comfortably accom-
modate and occupy has been hired, employing even more workers will not result 
in very much more output being produced. If the factory becomes overstaffed, 
either some of the workforce will be idle for most of the time, or most of the 
workforce will be idle for some of the time. In Table 2.1, diminishing returns 
begin to set in after L = 6 workers are employed. The sixth worker contrib-
utes MPL = 37 units of output, but MPL = 34 for L = 7, and MPL = 28 
for L = 8. Eventually average productivity, measured by APL, also starts to 
fall. Average productivity reaches its peak of APL = 28 for L = 7 or L = 8, 
but APL = 27 for L = 9 and APL = 25 for L = 10. Eventually, the point is 
reached where the factory becomes so overcrowded that output starts to fall if 
more workers are taken on. If a tenth worker is employed, total output increases 
from q = 243 to q = 250, so MPL (= 7) is small but still positive. But if an 
eleventh worker is employed, total output falls from q = 250 to q = 242; so 
MPL (= -8) becomes negative.

Figure 2.1  Short-run relationship between total, marginal and average product 
of labour
Figure 2.1 illustrates the relationship between MPL and APL. It is important 
to notice that APL is increasing whenever MPL 7 APL, and APL is decreasing 
whenever MPL 6 APL. This implies APL reaches its maximum value at the 
point where MPL = APL.
■ If the marginal contribution to total output of the last worker employed is 
higher than the average output per worker (MPL 7 APL), the last worker 
must be pulling the average up (so APL is increasing).
■ If the marginal contribution to total output of the last worker employed is 
lower than the average output per worker (MPL 6 APL), the last worker 
must be pulling the average down (so APL is decreasing).
This relationship between MPL and APL is also visible in the numerical example 
shown in Columns 1 to 4 of Table 2.1.
Cost theory
The short-run relationship between inputs and output, governed by the Law 
of Diminishing Returns, has direct implications for the firm’s cost structure in 
the short run. Before examining the mechanics of cost theory, it is important 
to notice that the economist’s idea of items that should count towards a firm’s 
‘costs’ differs from that of an accountant when preparing a set of company 
accounts. For an economist, costs encompass ‘rewards’ as well as monetary 
payments, since in many cases the supply of an input involves no formal cash 
or monetary transaction. For example, the owners of a business might not pay 
themselves for their own time and effort, or for ploughing their own money into 
the business. Nevertheless, the owners will soon contemplate the closure of the

business if the reward or profit from such a personal investment is insufficient 
to compensate them for their own time and effort and match the opportunity cost 
of the financial investment: the return that the owners could have achieved had 
they invested their financial resources elsewhere. Accordingly, returns that an 
accountant might consider as part of the firm’s ‘profit’ would be considered by 
an economist to be part of the ‘costs’ the firm needs to cover if it is to remain in 
business. An economist would include in the firm’s cost functions an allowance 
for the reward the firm’s owners require to remain in business. This reward is 
known as normal profit. Finally, any additional return over and above the normal 
profit is known as abnormal profit.
Columns 5 to 11 of Table 2.1 illustrate the implications of the Law of Dimin-
ishing Returns for the firm’s cost structure in the short run. The previous dis-
cussion notwithstanding, for the purpose of constructing this simple numerical 
example, the firm owner’s reward or normal profit is not included explicitly 
within the cost function (although this could be considered as part of the firm’s 
fixed costs). In addition to the short-run production function data contained in 
Columns 1 to 4 of Table 2.1, two further pieces of information about costs are 
used to construct Columns 5 to 11:
■ The firm’s weekly cost of employing each worker is £200;
■ The firm also incurs a fixed cost of £1,000 per week. This is the cost associated 
with the fixed (capital) factor of production. This fixed cost does not vary with 
the number of workers employed.
Accordingly, columns 5, 6 and 7 of Table 2.1 show the firm’s variable cost, fixed 
cost and short-run total cost, VC, FC and TC, respectively. Column 8 shows the 
firm’s short-run marginal cost, SRMC. Marginal cost is the additional cost the 
firm incurs in order to produce one additional unit of output. For the purposes 
of Table 2.1, marginal cost is calculated by dividing £200 (the cost of employing 
each additional worker) by MPL (the additional output contributed by each 
additional worker). For example, by spending £200 to employ the first worker, 
the firm obtains MPL = 7 units of output. Therefore at q = 7 the firm’s mar-
ginal cost (per additional unit of output) is SRMC = 200/7 = 28.6. By spend-
ing another £200 to employ the second worker, the firm obtains MPL = 19 
additional units of output. Therefore at q = 26 the firm’s marginal cost (per 
additional unit of output) is SRMC = 200/19 = 10.5. It is important to notice 
that when MPL is rising SRMC is falling, but once diminishing returns set in and 
MPL starts falling (beyond q = 162), SRMC starts rising. The increase in SRMC 
beyond this point is a direct consequence of the Law of Diminishing Returns. As 
each additional worker employed becomes less productive, the cost to the firm 
of producing each additional unit of output inevitably increases.
Columns 9 and 10 of Table 2.1 show the firm’s average variable cost and aver-
age fixed cost, AVC and AFC, respectively. These are calculated by dividing 
the total variable and fixed costs (columns 5 and 6) by total output (column 2). 
Comparing Columns 4 and 9, it is important to notice that when APL is rising 
AVC is falling, but once APL starts falling (beyond L = 8 and q = 244) AVC 
starts rising. Therefore AVC is ‘U-shaped’. If the average productivity of labour 

38	
|	 2    ■    Production, costs, demand and profit maximization
is rising, the average labour cost incurred per unit of output produced must be 
falling. Likewise, if the average productivity of labour is falling, the average 
labour cost incurred per unit of output produced must be rising. Meanwhile, 
AFC is decreasing over all values of L and q that are shown in Table 2.1. Reading 
down Column 10, the total fixed cost is spread over larger and larger volumes of 
output in order to calculate AFC. Therefore AFC falls as q increases. Finally, 
Column 11 of Table 2.1 shows the firm’s short-run average cost, SRAC, calcu-
lated by summing AVC and AFC. The ‘U-shaped’ appearance of AVC ensures 
SRAC is also ‘U-shaped’. As q increases, a point is eventually reached at which 
the downward pull of AFC on SRAC is exceeded by the upward pull of AVC 
on SRAC. Before this point SRAC is decreasing as q increases, but beyond this 
point SRAC is increasing as q increases.
Figure 2.2 illustrates the relationship between the firm’s marginal and average 
cost functions, SRMC, AVC, AFC and SRAC. It is important to notice that 
while the MPL and APL functions shown in Figure 2.1 are drawn with labour 
on the horizontal axis, the SRMC, AVC, AFC and SRAC functions shown in 
Figure 2.2 are drawn with output on the horizontal axis. It is also important to 
notice that AVC is decreasing whenever SRMC 6 AVC, and AVC is increasing 
whenever SRMC 7 AVC. This implies AVC reaches its minimum value at the 
point where SRMC = AVC.
■ If the marginal cost of producing the last unit of output is lower than the aver-
age labour cost per unit of output (SRMC 6 AVC), the cost of producing the 
last unit must be bringing the average down (so AVC is decreasing).

■ If the marginal cost of producing the last unit of output is higher than the 
average labour cost per unit of output (SRMC 7 AVC), the cost of producing 
the last unit must be pulling the average up (so AVC is increasing).
This relationship between SRMC and AVC is also visible in Columns 8 to 9 of 
Table 2.1, and is very similar to the relationship between MPL and APL shown 
in Figure 2.1. In fact, the SRMC and AVC functions in Figure 2.2 can be inter-
preted as a ‘mirror image’ of the corresponding MPL and APL functions in 
Figure 2.1.
Long-run production and costs
In the long run, the firm has the opportunity to overcome the short-run con-
straint on production that is imposed by the Law of Diminishing Returns, by 
increasing its usage of all inputs. In addition to employing more workers, it can 
acquire more plant and machinery and move into a larger building. In other 
words, it can alter the scale of production.
The long-run relationship between the firm’s inputs and output is governed 
by returns to scale. This refers to the proportionate increase in output that is 
achieved from any given proportionate increase in all inputs. Three types of 
returns to scale are identified schematically in Figure 2.3. Although the three 
cases are shown separately, firms can pass through all three phases as they 
expand the scale of their operations.
■ Increasing returns to scale occurs when output increases more than proportion-
ately to the increase in inputs. For example, a doubling of all inputs leads to 
more than a doubling of output. In this case there are economies of scale.
■ Constant returns to scale occurs when output increases proportionately with 
an increase in inputs. A doubling of all inputs leads to a doubling of output.

■ Decreasing returns to scale occurs when output increases less than propor-
tionately to the increase in inputs. A doubling of all inputs leads to less than 
a doubling of output. In this case there are diseconomies of scale.
The sources of economies of scale and diseconomies of scale are considered 
in some detail below.
In order to derive the firm’s long-run cost functions, it is assumed initially that 
the firm faces a choice between four possible values for the capital input, denoted 
K1 to K4. Therefore, the firm can choose between four different scales of pro-
duction. For each of the four values of K, the appropriate short-run production 
function (treating K as fixed in each case and allowing L to vary) is used to derive 
the firm’s short-run cost function. Figure 2.4 shows the four short-run average 
cost functions, SRAC1 to SRAC4, and the corresponding short-run marginal cost 
functions, SRMC1 to SRMC4.
Reading Figure 2.4 from left to right, each successive short-run average cost 
curve refers to a larger scale of production.
■ Initially, by moving from K1 to K2 and SRAC1 to SRAC2, a larger scale of 
production generates lower average costs. This is due to increasing returns to 
scale, or economies of scale. Output increases more than proportionately to the 
increase in inputs, so the average cost (per unit of output produced) decreases.
■ At some point, however, the opportunities for reducing average costs by 
increasing the scale of production are exhausted. By moving from K2 to K3 
and SRAC2 to SRAC3, a larger scale of production has no effect on average 
costs. This is the case of constant returns to scale. Output increases in the same 
proportion as the increase in inputs, so the average cost (per unit of output 
produced) remains unchanged.

■ If the scale of production is increased still further, average costs may eventu-
ally start to increase. By moving from K3 to K4 and SRAC3 to SRAC4, a larger 
scale of production generates higher average costs. This is due to decreasing 
returns to scale, or diseconomies of scale. Output increases less than pro-
portionately to the increase in inputs, so the average cost (per unit of output 
produced) increases.
In the long run, the firm can choose from a continuous range of possible 
values for the capital input. Therefore SRAC1 to SRAC4 in Figure 2.4 can be 
interpreted as representative of an infinite number of possible short-run average 
cost functions. The smooth ‘envelope’ that enfolds these curves from below is 
the firm’s long-run average cost function, denoted LRAC. LRAC represents the 
lowest cost of producing any given output level when the firm can vary both the 
capital and labour inputs in the long run.
It is important to notice that to produce any given level of output at the lowest 
long-run average cost, the firm does not usually operate at the lowest point on the 
short-run average cost function. For example, in Figure 2.5 the minimum aver-
age cost of producing q1 units of output is C1, obtained by operating on SARC1. 
If the firm were to increase its output from q1 to q2, enabling it to adjust to the 
minimum point on SARC1, it could produce at a lower average cost of C2. How-
ever, if the firm really wants to produce q2 rather than q1, it can do better still by 
increasing its scale of production, and shifting onto a new short-run average cost 
function, SRAC2. By doing so, it produces q2 at an average cost of C3, which is 
lower than C2 at the minimum point on SARC1. However, the same argument 
applies here as well, and the firm does not operate at the minimum point on 
SRAC2. Only if the firm selects the output level at the lowest point on LRAC 
does it also operate at the minimum point on the corresponding SRAC function.
The firm’s total cost and LRAC functions can also be derived more directly 
from the production function, using the apparatus of isoquants and isocost func-
tions. This apparatus emphasizes the fact that in order to produce any given 
Figure 2.5  Short-run and long-run average cost functions

|	 2    ■    Production, costs, demand and profit maximization
quantity of output at the lowest possible cost, the firm needs to select the most 
cost-effective combination of inputs. This decision will depend not only on the 
technological conditions embodied in the production function but also on the 
prices of the inputs. In other words, there is both a technological dimension and 
an economic dimension to the firm’s decision as to its choice of inputs.
Suppose a firm that employs two inputs, labour and capital, wishes to identify 
the combination of these inputs that will produce a given quantity of output, 
say q, as cheaply as possible. By substituting q into the production function 
q = f(K, L) and rearranging, a relationship is identified between all the combina-
tions of L and K that could be combined to produce q units of output. This rela-
tionship is represented by the function K = h(L, q), known as the isoquant for q 
units of output. h() is a new function, obtained by rearranging f(). In ­Figure 2.6, 
which has L and K on the axes, this isoquant is depicted as a downward slop-
ing and curved function. Assuming L and K are substitutable in production to 
some extent, the downward sloping isoquant implies q units of output could 
be produced either in a capital-intensive manner (large K and small L), or in 
a labour-intensive manner (small K and large L), or using some intermediate 
combination of K and L.
The set of three downward sloping lines shown in Figure 2.6 are the firm’s 
isocost functions. Each isocost function shows all combinations of L and K the 
firm can hire which incur an identical total cost. The further away from the 
origin, the higher the total cost represented by each successive isocost function. 
The positions and slope of the isocost functions depend on the prices per unit of 
L and K, which can be denoted w (the wage rate per unit of labour) and r (the 
rental per unit of capital), respectively. Finally, Figure 2.6 shows that the most

2.2  Production and costs	 |	
43
cost-effective method of producing q units of output is to hire L1 units of labour 
and K1 units of capital, at a total cost of C1 = wL1 + rK1. At any other point on 
the isoquant for q, the firm would be located on a higher isocost function than at 
this point of tangency. This analysis establishes that the lowest possible total cost 
of producing q units of output is C1. The corresponding LRAC (long-run average 
cost) is C1/q. A complete description of the firm’s cost structure is obtained by 
repeating a similar analysis for all other possible output levels.
The LRAC function can be used to derive the firm’s long-run marginal cost 
function, denoted LRMC in Figure 2.4. The relationship between LRMC and 
LRAC is rather similar to the relationship that exists between the firm’s short-
run marginal cost and average variable cost functions.
■ LRAC is decreasing when LRMC 6 LRAC. If the marginal cost of produc-
ing the last unit of output is lower than the average cost per unit of output, the 
cost of producing the last unit must be pulling the average down, so LRAC is 
decreasing. In this case there are economies of scale.
■ LRAC reaches its minimum value at the point where LRMC = LRAC. At 
this point there are constant returns to scale.
■ LRAC is increasing when LRMC 7 LRAC. If the marginal cost of produc-
ing the last unit of output is higher than the average cost per unit of output, 
the cost of producing the last unit must be pulling the average up, so LRAC 
is increasing. In this case there are diseconomies of scale.
Economies of scale
This sub-section examines in some detail why long-run average costs should either 
decrease or increase as the firm alters its scale of production in the long run. In 
other words, the sources of economies of scale and diseconomies of scale are 
examined.
Economies of scale can be classified as either real or pecuniary. Real econo-
mies of scale are associated with savings in average costs due to changes in the 
quantities of physical inputs. Pecuniary economies of scale are associated with 
savings in average costs due to changes in the prices paid by the firm for its inputs 
or factors of production. These categories can be further subdivided according 
to the specific element of the firm’s operations from which the cost savings arise 
(for example, from labour, technology, marketing, transport or the managerial 
function). Economies of scale can be realised at the level of the plant, or (in the 
case of a multi-plant firm) at the level of the firm. Some of the principal sources 
of economies of scale are described below.
As a firm increases its scale of production, it can benefit from specialization 
through a greater division of labour. Individual workers can be assigned to spe-
cialised tasks. As workers become more specialised, their knowledge and skills 
increase and they become more productive. Furthermore, less time is wasted 
through workers having to switch from one task to another. Accordingly, the 
firm’s average costs are reduced. Similar benefits are also derived from specializa-
tion in management. A manager of a small firm may have to perform many tasks 
(financial planning and control, bookkeeping, marketing, personnel management 

44	
|	 2    ■    Production, costs, demand and profit maximization
and so on). The manager may well lack the necessary expertise to perform some 
or all of these functions effectively. In contrast, a large firm benefits by employing 
specialist managers to perform each separate function.
Real economies of scale arise from various technological relationships between 
inputs and output that underlie the firm’s long-run production function. Some 
examples are as follows:
■ Large-scale production may simply be more cost-effective than small-scale pro-
duction. By producing at large volume, the firm can make use of large machines 
that would not be feasible for a small-scale producer. One large machine may 
produce more output from any given quantity of inputs than two smaller 
machines combined.
■ Indivisibilities of capital and labour inputs are also an important source of 
economies for the large firm. Some types of capital equipment are ‘lumpy’ or 
indivisible. The firm either purchases a whole machine or it does not do so; it 
cannot acquire 10 per cent or 50 per cent of the machine. A combine harvester 
is a highly productive input in agriculture, but only a large farm operates at a 
sufficient scale to justify the purchase of such equipment. The usage of some 
inputs does not necessarily increase at all as the scale of production increases. 
A factory perhaps requires one receptionist and one photocopying machine, 
regardless of whether it produces 5,000 or 10,000 units of output per week. 
The same might apply to functions such as accounting, finance or health and 
safety. As the scale of production increases, the total cost of each indivisible 
input is spread over a larger volume of output, causing average costs to fall.
■ Learning economies are another important source of cost savings (Spence, 
1981). Over time, workers and managers become more skilled as they repeat 
the same tasks. The length of the production run is therefore an important 
determinant of the extent to which the firm may benefit from learning econo-
mies. For example, Alchian (1963) identifies a learning curve in aircraft pro-
duction: labour productivity in the manufacture of frames was a function of 
the cumulative number of frames already assembled.
■ Geometric relationships between inputs and outputs can result in cost savings as 
the scale of production increases. In some cases, costs may be proportional to 
surface area while outputs are proportional to volume. In Figure 2.7, a square 
tank of dimensions 1 m * 1 m * 1 m has a surface area of 6 m2 (square 
metres) and a storage capacity of 1 m3 (cubic metres). A tank of dimensions 
2 m * 2 m * 2 m has a surface area of 24 m2 and a capacity of 8 m3. A four-
fold increase in surface area is associated with an eightfold increase in volume. 
Accordingly, the capacity of an oil tanker increases more than proportionately 
with an increase in its surface area. Similarly, doubling an oil or gas pipeline’s 
circumference more than doubles its capacity. Some costs (for example, the 
costs of materials) might be proportional to surface area, while output is pro-
portional to volume. In the oil industry, a ‘0.6 rule of thumb’ is sometimes 
used by engineers to indicate that a 100 per cent increase in capacity should 
require only a 60 per cent increase in costs.

Pecuniary economies of scale arise if large firms find it easier than small firms 
to raise finance. A large firm may be able to offer lenders stronger security guar-
antees than a small firm. A large firm may have access to sources of finance 
unavailable to a small firm, such as the stock market or its own bond issues. 
Lenders may believe a large firm poses a lower risk, perhaps because a large firm 
can spread its risks through multi-plant operations or diversification, or because 
a large firm benefits from a reputation effect.
Large firms can buy and sell in bulk, benefiting from purchasing and market-
ing economies. Suppliers of raw materials or other inputs may be willing to offer 
discounts for large-scale orders. Retailers or distributors may be willing to offer 
more favourable terms or service to a large-scale producer. A large firm may 
be able to benefit from using large-scale forms of advertising, such as televi-
sion advertising, which would be beyond the means of a smaller firm. A large 
firm that services a national market may be able to realise transport economies, 
by operating separate plants that produce and sell in different regions. A small 
firm that services a national market from a single plant may incur significant 
transport costs.
All of the economies of scale described above (both real and pecuniary) are 
internal economies of scale. In every case, cost savings are generated directly 
by the firm, through its own decision to increase its scale of production. In 
contrast, external economies of scale refer to cost savings that are gener-
ated not through expansion on the part of any one firm individually, but 
through the expansion of all of the industry’s member firms collectively. As 
the size of an industry increases, all firms may realise benefits including: 
increased specialization of labour; the availability of industry-specific edu-
cation and training programmes; the availability of specialist facilities, sup-
port services or physical infrastructure; the growth of publicly or privately 
funded research centres; the development of expertise and knowledge of the 
industry’s requirements within banks and other financial institutions; and 
so on. As the scale of the industry’s aggregate production increases, external 
economies of scale tend to reduce average costs for all of the industry’s mem-
ber firms, large and small.

Diseconomies of scale
Diseconomies of scale arise when long-run average costs tend to increase as out-
put increases for plants or firms operating beyond a certain scale. Managerial 
diseconomies, arising from difficulties encountered in managing large organiza-
tions effectively, are perhaps the most widely cited explanation for diseconomies 
of scale. Sources of managerial diseconomies include the following:
■ Strained communications between different tiers of management, or between 
different parts of the organization generally.
■ Long chains of command and complex organizational structures.
■ Low morale among the workforce, who may sense a lack of personal involve-
ment or interest in the performance of the organization.
■ Poor industrial relations, due to the complexity of relationships between the 
workforce and management, or between different groups of workers.

Samsung gets smarter with phones strategy
FT
Just when smartphones were starting to look like dumb, commoditised devices in the tech 
industry’s search for a new growth star, Samsung Electronics has forecast its best quar-
terly results in more than two years, defying the sector’s slowing sales. The South Korean 
company has estimated its operating profit for the June quarter at $7bn, the highest since 
the first quarter of 2014. It is the only smartphone maker still enjoying high margins, 
while Apple, LG Electronics and Chinese rivals struggle to cope with slowing demand.
Its strong guidance indicates the world’s largest smartphone maker has found a way to 
reverse its fortunes, after seeing profits and market share squeezed over the past two years 
by competition from Apple and Chinese players. Analysts estimate Samsung’s operating 
profit from the mobile division topped Won4tn ($3.5bn) in the second quarter, accounting 
for more than half of Samsung’s total operating profit.
‘At the beginning of this year, no one expected this kind of reversal, as Samsung’s 
mobile business seemed to be losing steam just like other Android phonemakers,’ says 
Peter Yu at BNP Paribas. ‘But Samsung has made a surprising comeback, defying the 
consensus that smartphones were getting commoditised.’ Samsung’s latest flagship Gal-
axy S7 has led the turnround, as a simpler product line-up helps the company cut costs 
at a time when global smartphone sales growth is forecast to halve to about 7 per cent 
this year, according to research firm Gartner. Samsung is believed to have shipped 16m 
Galaxy S7 phones in the second quarter, following on from 10m units in March when the 
model debuted, with its pricier curved-screen version outselling its flat screen counter-
part. ‘Obviously, they learned a lesson from two years of struggle. They have seen a big 
improvement on the cost side and product mix,’ says Daniel Kim at Macquarie.

Samsung used to roll out as many models as possible to see what would work. However, 
the company is now pursuing a different Apple-like smartphone strategy, streamlining 
its product offerings, just as Apple is grappling with slowing sales and widening its range 
of products in search of growth. ‘Samsung and Apple are copying each other’s successful 
strategy while they compete head on,’ says Mr Yu. ‘Samsung’s efforts to simplify its line-
up are bearing fruit as it makes the most of economies of scale, while Apple is looking for 
opportunities in the mid-end market given the high-end market saturation.’

Williamson (1967) elaborates on the causes of managerial diseconomies of 
scale. The firm can be viewed as a coalition of various teams or groups who are 
responsible for specialist activities such as production, marketing and finance. 
Since much of the firm’s activity requires teamwork, as in any team there are 
incentives for opportunistic behaviour such as shirking or freeriding on the part 
of individuals. This creates a need to monitor the performance of team members. 
Traditionally, monitoring has been the role of the entrepreneur, but in the mod-
ern corporation the entrepreneur has been replaced by salaried managers. Each 
layer of management is monitored by a higher tier of managers, who in turn are 
monitored by another tier, and so on. At the apex of the hierarchical structure is 
the final control exercised by the firm’s owners.
An essential function of the hierarchy is to handle, transmit and process or 
interpret information as it flows between different levels of the organization. This 
information is subject to two distortions. First, deliberate distortion (information 
impactedness) occurs when managers, supervisors and team members at lower 
levels misrepresent their efforts or abilities, so as to appear in the best possible 
light. Second, accidental distortion (serial reproduction) occurs whenever infor-
mation has to flow through many channels. Williamson draws an analogy with 
the children’s party game of ‘Chinese whispers’:
Bartlett (1932) illustrates this (serial reproduction) graphically with a 
line drawing of an owl which, when redrawn successively by eighteen 
individuals, each sketch based on its immediate predecessor, ended up as 
a recognizable cat; and the further from the initial drawing one moved, 
the greater the distortion experienced. The reliance of hierarchical 
organizations on serial reproduction for their functioning thus exposes 
them to what may become serious distortions in transmission.
(Williamson, 1967, p. 127)
If decision-makers do not have access to accurate information, errors tend to 
occur, and the firm’s average cost tends to increase.
The managerial function is not necessarily the only source of diseconomies of 
scale. As the firm or plant expands, transport costs may tend to increase. As the 

48	
|	 2    ■    Production, costs, demand and profit maximization
firm’s demand for raw materials or other inputs increases, these may have to be 
shipped in from further afield. Similarly, in order to find sufficient customers, the 
firm’s end product may need to be transported over longer geographic distances. 
External diseconomies of scale might also arise, if the expansion of all of the indus-
try’s member firms causes all firms’ average costs to increase. This could happen 
if growth of the industry leads to shortages of raw materials or specialised labour, 
putting upward pressure on the costs of these essential factors of production.
Some economists have questioned whether diseconomies of scale are inevita-
bly encountered beyond a certain scale of production (Sargent, 1933). At plant 
level, there may be a natural tendency for average costs to increase as the plant 
size becomes large and unwieldy. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume the 
plant’s LRAC function is U-shaped. However, a multi-plant firm might be able to 
circumvent the tendency for LRAC to increase at plant level, simply by opening 
more plants and allowing each one to operate at the minimum point on its own 
LRAC function. In this case, the firm’s LRAC function might be L-shaped rather 
than U-shaped (see Figure 2.8). Eventually, of course, managerial diseconomies at 
firm level may prevent what might otherwise be potentially limitless expansion of 
the firm through proliferation of plants. However, even in this case the inevitabil-
ity of diseconomies of scale has been questioned. The development of decentral-
ised organizational structures, with managers of separate divisions within the firm 
given considerable individual responsibility and decision-making autonomy, can 
be interpreted as an attempt to avoid managerial diseconomies that might other-
wise arise under a structure of excessive centralised control (see also Section 5.3).
Economies of scope
Economies of scope are cost savings that arise when a firm produces two or more 
outputs using the same set of resources. Diversification causes average costs 
to fall if the total cost of producing several goods or services together is less

49
than the sum of the costs of producing them separately. Economies of scope 
can be realised by bulk-purchasing inputs that are used in the production of 
several different products. For example, the same microchips may be used in the 
manufacture of several different consumer electronics products. Economies of 
scope can also be realised by spreading the costs of specialist functions, such as 
finance, marketing and distribution, over a range of products or services. Com-
puting and telecommunications may provide an important source of economies 
of scope. Data on the characteristics of customers who have already purchased 
one product can be stored electronically, and analysed in order to devise targeted 
marketing strategies for the promotion of other products or services.
Minimum efficient scale
The minimum efficient scale (MES) is defined as the output level beyond which 
the firm can make no further savings in LRAC (long-run average cost) through 
further expansion. In other words, the MES is achieved when all economies 
of scale are exhausted. Textbook microeconomic theory suggests a U-shaped 
long-run average cost function: as soon as economies of scale are exhausted, the 
firm immediately experiences diseconomies of scale. In practice, however, once 
MES has been achieved, it is possible that a firm may be able to produce at the 
minimum attainable LRAC over a wide range of output levels. For any range 
of output levels over which the LRAC function is flat, the firm experiences con-
stant returns to scale. Accordingly, a more realistic LRAC function might have 
an elongated U-shape, or (as suggested by our earlier discussion of the possible 
avoidance of diseconomies of scale) an L-shape. These possibilities are shown in 
the left-hand and middle diagrams in Figure 2.8.
In some of the theoretical models that are widely used in industrial organiza-
tion, a convenient simplifying assumption is that firms encounter constant returns 
to scale over all possible output levels they can choose. In other words, it is some-
times convenient to simplify the assumed cost structure by ignoring economies of 
scale and diseconomies of scale altogether. In this case, the LRAC and LRMC 
functions are both horizontal and identical to each other, over all possible val-
ues of q. For example, suppose the total cost of producing 10 units of output is 
£100, the cost of producing 20 units is £200, and the cost of producing 30 units is 
£300. In this case LRAC = £10 (= £100/10 or £200/20 or £300/30) for any value 
of q. Similarly, LRMC = £10 for any value of q, because each additional unit of 
output always adds exactly £10 to the firm’s total cost. This case is shown in the 
right-hand diagram in Figure 2.8.
For any firm seeking to minimise its costs over the long term, it is important 
to be able to identify the shape of the LRAC function, or at least identify the 
output level at which MES is achieved and all possible cost savings arising from 
economies of scale have been realised. With reference to a textbook LRAC func-
tion, identifying the MES is a trivial task. However, in practice a firm’s managers 
may have little or no idea of the true shape of the LRAC function, and may have 
to rely on estimates.

Demand, revenue, elasticity and profit maximization
Demand, average revenue and marginal revenue
The market demand function for a product or service shows the relationship 
between market price and the number of units of the product or service con-
sumers wish to buy at that price. In many of the models that are presented in 
this book, a linear market demand function is assumed. Table 2.2 presents a 
numerical illustration of a linear market demand function. Columns 1 and 2 
show that the maximum price any consumer would be prepared to pay is £2. 
When P = £2, Q = 1 unit is sold. However, if the market price is reduced below 
P = £2, more buyers are attracted: when P = £1.8, Q = 2 units are sold; when 
P = £1.6, Q = 3 units are sold; and so on. If the market price is reduced as 
low as P = £0.2, Q = 10 units are sold; and if (hypothetically) the product or 
service were being given away for free, Q = 11 would be the quantity demanded 
when P = 0.

Suppose the product or service is being supplied by one firm only, so the 
industry structure is monopoly. The theory of monopoly is developed in full 
in Section 3.3. At this stage, however, there is sufficient information to evalu-
ate the monopolist’s total revenue function, TR. By definition, total revenue 
equals price * quantity, so each entry in Column 3 of Table 2.2 is obtained 
by multiplying the corresponding entries in Columns 1 and 2. Notice that the 
monopolist’s TR function has an inverted U-shaped appearance: TR = 0 for 
Q = 0 and Q = 11, and TR attains its maximum value of TR = 6 for Q = 5 
and Q = 6.
Columns 4 and 5 of Table  2.2 show the monopolist’s average revenue 
and marginal revenue functions. The average revenue function, AR, shows 
the average revenue per unit of output sold, and is calculated by divid-
ing total revenue (Column 3) by quantity demanded (Column 2). Since 
TR = PQ, AR = TR/Q = PQ/Q = P. In other words, average revenue is 
identical to price. Therefore Column 4 of Table 2.2 is the same as Column 1. 
The marginal revenue function, MR, shows the additional revenue generated 
by the last unit of output sold, and is calculated as the change in total revenue 
achieved as a result of each one-unit increase in quantity demanded. For Q … 5, 
TR increases as Q increases, so MR 7 0. Between Q = 5 and Q = 6, TR does 
not change as Q increases, so MR = 0. For Q Ú 7, TR decreases as Q increases, 
so MR 6 0. Figure 2.9 illustrates the monopolist’s TR, AR and MR functions.
Elasticity
Price elasticity of demand
What is the effect of a reduction in price on a monopolist’s total revenue? 
Table 2.2 and Figure 2.9 demonstrate that the monopolist could experience 
either an increase, or no change, or a decrease in its total revenue, depending 
on the point on the market demand function from which the price reduction is 
introduced. By definition, TR = PQ. As P falls, Q rises, so the overall effect of 
a reduction in P on TR could be positive, zero or negative. More specifically:
■ If the (positive) quantity effect dominates the (negative) price effect, TR 
increases as P falls.
■ If the quantity effect just balances the price effect, TR remains unchanged as 
P falls.
■ If the quantity effect is dominated by the price effect, TR decreases as P falls.
The effect of a reduction in P on TR therefore depends upon the responsive-
ness of quantity demanded to a change in price. Price elasticity of demand, PED, 
provides a convenient measure of this responsiveness. The formula for calculat-
ing PED is as follows:
PED = Proportionate change in quantity demanded
Proportionate change in price

Figure 2.9  Total, average and marginal revenue
Let ∆P denote the change in price between any two points on the market 
demand function, and let ∆Q denote the corresponding change in quantity 
demanded. The proportionate change in quantity demanded is ∆Q/Q, and 
the proportionate change in price is ∆P/P. The values of P and Q used in 
the denominators of these expressions are usually taken as the values midway 
between the two points on the market demand function over which PED is 
being calculated.
PED =
¢ ∆Q
Q ≤
¢ ∆P
P ≤
= ¢ ∆Q
∆P ba P
Qb
Because the changes in P and Q are in opposite directions (∆Q 7 0 if ∆P 6 0, 
and ∆Q 6 0 if ∆P 7 0), the formula for PED produces a negative value. How-
ever, when economists discuss price elasticity of demand, it is quite common to 
ignore the minus sign and refer to the corresponding positive value. Therefore a 
‘price elasticity of demand of 2’ refers to the case PED = -2. The mathematical 
notation used to convert a negative value into its corresponding positive value is the 
absolute value function, written as  PED =  -2 = 2. Column 6 of Table 2.2 
shows the values of  PED  calculated over each successive pair of values for  
(P, Q) shown in Columns 1 and 2.

The previous discussion of the effect of a reduction in P on TR has the fol-
lowing implications:
■ If  PED 7 1, TR increases as P falls. The quantity effect dominates the price 
effect. The demand function is price elastic. Quantity demanded is sensitive to 
the change in price.
■ If  PED = 1, TR remains unchanged as P falls. The quantity effect just bal-
ances the price effect. The demand function exhibits unit price elasticity.
■ If  PED 6 1, TR decreases as P falls. The quantity effect is dominated by 
the price effect. The demand function is price inelastic. Quantity demanded is 
insensitive to the change in price.
Another useful interpretation of price elasticity of demand is obtained by 
demonstrating the relationship between PED and MR. By definition:
MR = ∆TR
∆Q
where ∆TR denotes the change in total revenue achieved as a result of a change 
in quantity demanded, denoted ∆Q. Using the definition TR = PQ and a math-
ematical rule known as the Product Rule, an expression for MR in terms of P, 
Q, ∆P and ∆Q is as follows:
MR = ∆TR
∆Q
= ∆(PQ)
∆Q
= P * ∆Q
∆Q + ∆P
∆Q * Q
 Since ∆Q/∆Q = 1:
 MR = P + ∆P
∆Q * Q = P + P * a ∆P
∆Q * Q
P b = P + P *

¢ ∆Q
∆P * P

PED b = P a1 -

 PED b
See Appendix 1 for a more formal mathematical derivation of this result. The 
interpretation of the expression MR = P a1 -
1
 PED b is as follows:
■ If  PED 7 1, 1/ PED 6 1 and MR 7 0. When the demand function is 
price elastic, MR 7 0.
■ If  PED = 1, 1/ PED = 1 and MR = 0. When the demand function 
exhibits unit elasticity, MR = 0.
■ If  PED 6 1, 1/ PED  7 1 and MR 6 0. When the demand function is 
price inelastic, MR 7 0.
It is possible to define price elasticity of demand either at market level or at firm 
level. This distinction was irrelevant in the preceding discussion, which referred to a 
monopolist. However, in a competitive market in which an identical product is sold 

54	
|	 2    ■    Production, costs, demand and profit maximization
by many firms, there might be a big difference between the sensitivity of the total 
quantity demanded to a change in the market price (assuming all firms make the same 
price adjustment), and the sensitivity of one individual firm’s quantity demanded to 
a change in its own price (assuming other firms keep their prices unchanged).
Price elasticity of demand is only one of several elasticities used by econo-
mists to measure the sensitivity of one variable (in the case of PED, quantity 
demanded) to changes in another variable (in the case of PED, market price). 
Other elasticities, defined in a similar manner to PED, will be encountered at 
various points throughout this book. At this stage, however, three examples will 
illustrate the wide range of applications of the concept of elasticity. In each case, 
the symbol ‘∆’ in front of a variable denotes the change in this variable.
Cross-price elasticity of demand
Cross-price elasticity of demand, CED, measures the sensitivity of the quantity 
demanded of Good 1 to a change in the price of Good 2.
 CED = Proportionate change in the quantity demanded of Good 1
Proportionate change in the price of Good 2
 CED = ∆Q1
∆P1
* P2
Q1
where Q1 denotes the demand for Good 1, and P2 denotes the price of Good 2. 
CED provides an indication of whether Goods 1 and 2 are substitutes or comple-
ments in consumption, or whether the demand for Good 1 is unrelated to the 
price of Good 2:
■ If CED 7 0, an increase in P2 leads to an increase in Q1. This suggests Goods 
1 and 2 are substitutes: as the price of Good 2 increases (and the demand for 
Good 2 decreases), consumers tend to switch from Good 2 to Good 1, causing 
the demand for Good 1 to increase.
■ If CED 6 0, an increase in P2 leads to a decrease in Q1. This suggests Goods 
1 and 2 are complements: as the price of Good 2 increases (and the demand 
for Good 2 decreases), consumers also reduce their consumption of Good 1, 
causing the demand for Good 1 to decrease.
■ If CED = 0, an increase in P2 has no effect on Q1. This suggests Goods 1 and 
2 are neither substitutes nor complements: the demand for Good 1 is indepen-
dent of the price of good 2.
Advertising elasticity of demand
Advertising elasticity of demand, AED, measures the sensitivity of quantity 
demanded to a change in advertising expenditure.
 AED =
Proportionate change in quantity demanded
Proportionate change in advertising expenditure
 AED = ∆Q
∆A * A

where Q denotes quantity demanded, and A denotes advertising expenditure.

	
	
	
2.3  Demand, revenue, elasticity and profit maximization	 |	
55
AED is a measure of the effectiveness of advertising. Normally AED should 
be positive: an increase in advertising leads to an increase in quantity demanded. 
Calculated or estimated at the level of the individual firm, AED might be an 
important indicator of the level of resources the firm should allocate to its adver-
tising budget. If AED is large, the firm might decide to advertise heavily, but if 
AED is small it might be more cost-effective to look for alternative methods of 
increasing the demand for its product.
Price elasticity of supply
Price elasticity of supply, PES, measures the sensitivity of quantity supplied to 
market price.
 PES = Proportionate change in quantity supplied
Proportionate change in price
 PES = ∆QS
∆P * P
QS
where QS denotes quantity supplied, and P denotes price. The s-subscript on 
QS distinguishes the formula for PES from the (otherwise identical) formula for 
PED. While an increase in price should be associated with a decrease in quantity 
demanded, an increase in price should be associated with an increase in quantity 
supplied. Therefore, PED should be negative and PES should be positive.
This section has focused on the relationship between price and quantity 
demanded. For most products, however, price is not the only determinant of the 
level of demand. Case Study  2.2 examines a wide range of factors that influence 
the level of demand for spectator attendance at professional football matches.
Case study 2.2
The demand for spectator attendance at 
professional football
The determinants of the level of demand for spectator attendance at professional team 
sports matches have been the subject of attention from economists since the 1970s. Some of 
the earliest contributions to this literature include Demmert (1973), Hart et al. (1975) and 
Noll (1974). The literature is reviewed by Dobson and Goddard (2011) and Sandy et al. 
(2004). This case study examines some of the main factors that influence spectator demand.
Price
Economic theory suggests a professional sports club should price its tickets in order to 
maximise its revenue or profit. In practice, however, there is some empirical evidence to 
suggest that many clubs fail to achieve this.

56	
|	 2    ■    Production, costs, demand and profit maximization
Suppose initially the club’s marginal cost (the direct cost incurred by attracting one 
additional spectator into the stadium) is zero. Figure 1 shows the club’s demand function 
for spectator attendance at one match: the number of spectators it would attract at each 
(uniform) ticket price. In this case, the club maximises its revenue by charging £20 per 
ticket and attracting 30,000 spectators: this is equivalent to maximizing the area of the 
rectangle beneath the market demand function.
■ At prices above £20, price elasticity of demand  PED  is greater than one.
■ At prices below £20,  PED  is less than one.
■ At a price of £20, at the very centre of the demand function,  PED  equals one.
Suppose, instead, the club’s marginal cost (cost of stewarding or policing) is £2 per 
spectator. Figure 2 shows the club’s marginal cost and the same demand function. In this 
case profit maximization requires charging £21 per ticket and attracting 28,500 spectators: 
this is equivalent to maximizing the area of the rectangle between the market demand and 
marginal cost functions.
Therefore, a profit-maximizing club should always operate on a section of the demand 
function where  PED Ú 1. However, several econometric studies have found that 
the actual  PED  for football attendance is less than one. There are several possible 
explanations:
■ Football clubs may not be profit maximisers, as the theory assumes.
■ The econometric studies could be wrong. It is difficult to estimate price elasticities 
accurately, because football clubs do not change their prices very often. In recent 
Figure 1  Uniform ticket pricing for profit maximization – zero marginal cost Maximum 
revenue/profit = 20 * 30,000 = £600k

years, many stadia have regularly sold out, so it is difficult to obtain good data on the 
sensitivity of spectator demand to variations in price.
■ Alternatively, the clubs may be operating more sophisticated pricing policies, for which 
operating with  PED 6 1 may be consistent with profit maximization. (This is the 
subject of Case Study 14.1.)
■ Finally, interrelationships between the demand for match tickets and the demand for 
related products or services such as live television broadcasts, merchandise or cater-
ing could explain why it is profitable for clubs to price their match tickets so that 
 PED 6 1.
City population and per capita income
There is a natural tendency for the strongest teams to be located in the cities with the 
largest population and/or largest per capita incomes. Teams with the largest potential or 
actual markets tend to generate the most income. In the long term this usually translates 
into playing success.
In the North American major league sports (baseball, American football, basketball 
and hockey), membership of the major leagues is closed: there is a fixed number of fran-
chise-holding teams. In the longer term, franchises tend to gravitate towards the largest 
cities that can afford to pay the highest subsidies. In Europe, membership of the top divi-
sions is regulated through the promotion and relegation system:
■ If a small market team is promoted to the top division, its lack of spending power often 
ensures speedy relegation.

profit = 21 * 28,500 - 2 * 28,500 = £541.5k

58	
|	 2    ■    Production, costs, demand and profit maximization
■ If a big market team is relegated to a lower division, its high spending power will usu-
ally guarantee promotion back to the top division sooner or later.
Uncertainty of outcome and competitive balance
It is widely assumed by sports economists that spectator interest in sport depends on 
uncertainty of outcome. There are three (related) types of uncertainty of outcome:
■ Degree of uncertainty concerning the result of an individual match.
■ Degree of uncertainty concerning the end-of-season outcome of a championship race 
or a battle to avoid relegation.
■ Degree to which championship success is concentrated in the hands of a few teams, or 
spread among many teams, over a number of years.
In today’s English Premiership, there is less of all three types of uncertainty of outcome 
than in the equivalent competition (the Football League) 30, 40 or 50 years ago. There has 
been extensive debate concerning the usefulness of policy measures designed to promote 
competitive balance and increase uncertainty of outcome:
■ Capping of teams’ total expenditure on players’ wages or salaries.
■ Sharing or pooling of gate or television revenues.
■ The US draft pick system, whereby the weakest teams from the previous season get 
first choice of new players turning professional for the first time.
Television and newspaper publicity
In most countries, professional sports such as football probably could not survive without 
the free publicity they receive through newspaper, television and radio coverage. Equally, 
sports coverage is essential for the ability of the print and broadcasting media to attract 
readers, viewers, listeners and, thereby, advertising revenue.
For a long time, it has been assumed by sports administrators and academics that if a 
sports fixture is the subject of live television coverage, spectator attendance may be adversely 
affected. However, the statistical evidence for a negative impact of television coverage on 
attendance is rather mixed: some studies find such an effect, while others find no effect.
Other relevant factors include the following:
■ Even if attendance is affected, the loss of gate revenue might be compensated by direct 
income from the broadcaster, or indirect income from advertising or sponsorship 
within the stadium.
■ The broadcasting rights might be more valuable if the stadium is full, due to the 
improved atmosphere created by a capacity crowd. Consequently, there might be a 
case for offering cheaper ticket prices to spectators attending televised matches.

Geographic market segmentation
Fifty years ago, the markets served by each English football club were local: most spec-
tators lived within walking distance or a short bus or train journey from the stadium. 
Today, the most successful clubs attract a national audience. Factors that have contrib-
uted to reduced geographic market segmentation include the following:
■ growth in private car ownership;
■ improvements in the road transport system;
■ demographic change (population is more mobile geographically);
■ increased media coverage of star players and leading teams.
Stadium facilities and hooliganism
In England, anecdotal evidence suggests that hooliganism and the antiquated, dilapidated 
physical condition of many football stadia made a major contribution to the long-term 
decline in football attendances between the late 1940s and mid-1980s. Aggregate atten-
dances for English league football fell from 41.0m in the 1948–9 season to 16.5m in the 
1985–6 season, before recovering to reach 29.5m in the 2010–11 season.
Since the mid-1980s, incidents of hooliganism affecting English football at club level 
have become much less frequent. Over the same period, the stadia of most leading clubs 
have been significantly upgraded or completely rebuilt. Since the mid-1990s, Premiership 
clubs have been required to provide seated viewing accommodation only; many lower-
division clubs have done so as well.
Profit maximization
Returning to Table 2.2, Columns 7 and 8 summarise the monopolist’s short-run 
cost structure. In accordance with the discussion in Section 2.2, the monopolist’s 
short-run production function is subject to the Law of Diminishing Returns, 
and SRMC eventually increases as output (Q) increases. As before, total cost is 
the sum of the firm’s variable cost (which can be inferred from the SRMC func-
tion) and fixed cost (assumed to be £1 per week). Column 9 shows the monop-
olist’s profit function. Profit, denoted p, is total revenue minus total cost, or 
p = TR - TC.
In order to maximise its profit in the short run, the monopolist should 
select its output level so that marginal revenue equals short-run marginal cost, 
MR = SRMC. It is worthwhile to increase output as long as the additional rev-
enue gained by doing so exceeds the additional cost incurred. Once the point is 
reached at which the additional revenue equals the additional cost (and beyond 
which the additional cost would exceed the additional revenue) the firm should 
not increase its output any further. In Table 2.2, this can be demonstrated by 

60	
|	 2    ■    Production, costs, demand and profit maximization
starting from the lowest possible output level of Q = 0 and increasing Q in steps 
of one:
■ Increasing from Q = 0 to Q = 1 increases revenue by MR = £2, and increases 
costs by SRMC = £0.5. Therefore profit increases by £1.5, from p = -1.0 to 
p = 0.5.
■ Similarly, increasing from Q = 1 to Q = 2 increases profit by £1.4, from 
p = 0.5 to p = 1.9; and increasing from Q = 2 to Q = 3 increases profit by 
£0.7, from p = 1.9 to p = 2.6.
■ Increasing from Q = 3 to Q = 4 increases revenue by MR = £0.8, and 
increases costs by SRMC = £0.8. Therefore profit remains unchanged, at 
p = 2.6. Between Q = 3 and Q = 4 MR = SRMC, and p = 2.6 is the maxi-
mum profit the monopolist can earn.
■ Increasing from Q = 4 to Q = 5 increases revenue by MR = £0.4, and 
increases costs by SRMC = £1.1. Therefore profit falls by £0.7, from p = 2.6 
to p = 1.9. Any further increase beyond Q = 5 also causes profit to fall.
The profit-maximizing rule ‘marginal revenue equals marginal cost’ is quite 
general, and applies not only to monopolists, but also to firms operating in other 
market structures such as perfect competition and monopolistic competition. 
Furthermore, this rule is valid not only for profit maximization in the short run 
(MR = SRMC, as in Table 2.2), but also for profit maximization in the long 
run (MR = LRMC).
	
2.4	
Summary
This chapter has reviewed the core elements of microeconomic theory that are 
required for an understanding of the economic models of firms and industries 
that are developed throughout the rest of this book.
In production and cost theory, an important distinction is drawn between the 
short run and the long run. For a firm that uses two factors of production, labour 
and capital, labour is assumed to be variable and capital fixed in the short run. 
In the long run, both labour and capital are assumed to be variable. The short-
run relationship between inputs, outputs and costs of production is governed by 
the Law of Diminishing Returns. As increasing quantities of labour are used in 
conjunction with a fixed quantity of capital, eventually the additional contribu-
tion made by each successive unit of labour to total output starts to decline. 
Consequently, as the quantity of output increases, the marginal cost of producing 
any further output starts to increase.
The long-run relationship between inputs, outputs and costs of production 
is governed by economies of scale and diseconomies of scale. Returns to scale 
describes the proportionate increase in output achieved from any given pro-
portionate increase in all inputs. Returns to scale are increasing, giving rise to 
economies of scale, if output increases more than proportionately to the increase 
in inputs. Returns to scale are decreasing, giving rise to diseconomies of scale,

if output increases less than proportionately to the increase in inputs. A firm 
attains its minimum efficient scale by producing an output level beyond which 
no further savings in long-run average costs are possible; or, in other words, at 
which all possible opportunities for cost savings through economies of scale have 
been exhausted.
The market demand function for a product or service shows the relationship 
between market price and the number of units consumers wish to buy at that 
price. Price elasticity of demand is a measure of the responsiveness of quantity 
demanded to a change in market price. It is possible to define price elasticity of 
demand either at the market level, or at the firm level. Other useful elasticity mea-
sures include cross-price elasticity of demand, advertising elasticity of demand 
and price elasticity of supply.
A profit-maximizing firm should produce the output level at which its mar-
ginal revenue equals its marginal cost. It is worthwhile to increase output as long 
as the additional revenue gained by producing one additional unit of output 
exceeds the additional cost incurred. Once the point is reached at which the 
additional revenue equals the additional cost, the firm should not increase its 
output any further.

Introduction
This chapter reviews the body of microeconomic theory known as the neoclas-
sical theory of the firm, including the models of perfect competition, monopoly 
and monopolistic competition. Section 3.2 begins by providing a brief description 
of the early historical development of the neoclassical theory.
The models of perfect competition, monopoly and monopolistic competition 
describe how firms should set their output levels and prices in order to maximise 
their profits, under various sets of assumptions concerning market structure. The

most important characteristics of market structure are the number of firms, the 
extent of barriers to entry and the degree of product differentiation.
The two most extreme cases considered by the neoclassical theory of the firm are 
perfect competition (the most competitive model) and monopoly (the least competi-
tive). These models are developed in Section 3.3, and their efficiency and welfare 
properties are compared in Section 3.4. Finally, Section 3.5 develops the model of 
monopolistic competition. This model describes an industry with large numbers of 
sellers and no entry barriers (as in perfect competition), but some product differ-
entiation affording the firms some discretion over their own prices (as in the case 
of monopoly). Accordingly, monopolistic competition represents an intermediate 
case, falling between the two polar cases of perfect competition and monopoly.

The neoclassical theory of the firm: historical 
development
It is difficult to decide precisely when the first theory of the firm emerged which 
was judged to be sufficiently coherent to be acceptable as the ‘general’ theory. 
Some people would claim that the credit should go to Edward Chamberlin and 
Joan Robinson in the 1930s. Others tend to look back further, to the contribu-
tions of Alfred Marshall in the 1890s, or perhaps even Augustin Cournot in 
the 1830s or Adam Smith in the 1770s. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify a 
coherent body of theory that claims to explain the determination of price and 
output, for both the industry and the individual firm, based on assumptions of 
profit maximization on the part of each individual firm. This body of theory is 
known as the neoclassical theory of the firm.
In An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Adam 
Smith (1776) argues that the value of the firm’s output is related to its costs of 
production (a notion which constituted the orthodox view at that time). Costs 
include an allowance for profit, interpreted as a reward to the firm’s owner. 
Owners maximise profit by attempting to minimise the other costs incurred by 
the firm. One of the most widely quoted passages is a description of Smith’s visit 
to a Nottingham pin factory, where he observed the potential for the division of 
labour to increase labour productivity and generate large cost savings.
To take an example, from . . . the trade of a pin maker; a workman not 
educated to this business . . . nor acquainted with the use of the machinery 
employed in it . . . could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry, make 
one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way 
in which this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a 
peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the 
greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire, 
another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the 
top for receiving the head . . . ten persons, therefore, could make among 
them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day.
(Smith, 1776, pp. 4–5)

Augustin Cournot (1838) was one of the first economists to attempt a formal 
mathematical analysis of the behaviour of monopolists and duopolists. Although 
Cournot was a mathematician by background, he was the first to apply calculus 
to an analysis of the pricing decisions of firms. Cournot’s analysis is considered 
in detail later on (see Chapter 7).
The idea that the value of a firm’s output is dependent on production costs sur-
vived until the late nineteenth century, when this notion was seriously challenged 
for the first time. According to the new view, the value of the product determines 
the rewards paid to the factors of production. Firms earning high profits by 
selling products that are in demand for a high price can pay higher rents, wages 
and interest. The price and therefore the value of the product depends ultimately 
on the level of demand. Stanley Jevons (1871) argued that the value a consumer 
places on a product depends on utility at the margin, which implies value is 
judged against all other past units of the product consumed. If marginal utility 
declines as consumption increases, price reductions are required to induce an 
increase in the quantity demanded. This relationship provides an explanation 
for the downward sloping demand function.
Alfred Marshall (1890, 1892) is considered to have been the first economist 
to draw the link between costs of production and market demand. Accordingly, 
value is determined by interactions between the conditions surrounding both sup-
ply and demand. Marshall developed the tools of economic analysis that are still 
familiar to first-year undergraduates: the upward sloping supply function and 
downward sloping demand function which combine, scissor-like, to determine an 
equilibrium price and quantity demanded and supplied. If price is set above or 
below this equilibrium, then firms are faced with excess supply or excess demand. 
In the case of excess supply or a glut of goods, price tends to fall, encouraging 
more buyers into the market. Some firms that are no longer able to cover their 
costs of production are forced to reduce their supply or leave the market. In the 
case of excess demand or a shortage of goods, price tends to rise, discouraging 
some buyers who withdraw from the market. Some incumbent firms respond to 
the price signal by increasing their production, and some entrants are attracted 
into the market for the first time.
Marshall also introduced the concept of price elasticity of demand, and 
drew the distinction between the short run and the long run. Like Smith, 
Marshall recognised that in the long-run firms benefit from economies of 
large-scale production. However, this does not necessarily lead to the emer-
gence of monopoly, because other producers may still be able to compete with 
a large incumbent, by exploiting distinctive entrepreneurial skills or external 
economies of scale. Marshall recognised the importance of rivalry, and that 
this creates the potential for collusion. However, Marshall viewed oligopoly 
as a form of quasi-monopoly, and therefore as an exception to the normal 
competitive market structure.
The theory of perfect competition was developed by John Bates Clark 
(1899), who believed that competition is fundamentally a force for good in 
the economy. In competitive markets, everyone receives a reward equivalent to 
their marginal contribution to production. Accordingly, Clark analysed those 
forces that have the potential to frustrate competition, especially monopoly

67
and associated restrictive practices. The theory was refined by Frank Knight 
(1921), who lists a number of conditions required for a market to conform to 
the model of perfect competition. Most importantly, no one buyer or seller is 
sufficiently powerful to influence prices; entry barriers do not impede the flow 
of resources into the market; and all agents have perfect knowledge. Knight 
explains why perfect competition does not necessarily eliminate abnormal 
profit in situations of uncertainty. According to Knight, uncertainty implies 
that the probabilities that should be assigned to possible future events are 
unknown. Risk, on the other hand, describes the case where the probabilities 
are known and future events can be insured against. Knight argues that, even 
in long-run equilibrium, firms might earn an abnormal profit as a payoff for 
dealing with uncertainty.
In the 1930s, Joan Robinson and Edward Chamberlin coined the term imper-
fect competition to describe the middle ground between perfect competition and 
monopoly (see Box 1.1). Robinson (1933) introduced the concept of marginal 
revenue and showed that in perfect competition marginal revenue equals price. 
For a firm in imperfect competition, the marginal revenue function is downward 
sloping. At some levels of production (where marginal revenue is negative), it 
may be possible to increase total revenue by producing and selling less output. 
Robinson argues that the tendency for imperfectly competitive firms to restrict 
production and operate below full capacity helps explain the high unemploy-
ment experienced in the UK in the 1930s. In contrast, high unemployment is 
inconsistent with the theory of perfect competition. Robinson’s analysis of price 
discrimination represents another important contribution to the theory of the 
firm. Chamberlin (1933) developed the theory of monopolistic competition to 
describe a market in which many firms produce goods that are similar but not 
identical. Accordingly, the firms have some discretion in setting their prices. 
Chamberlin also contributed to the theory of oligopoly. Oligopolists recognise 
that their actions are interdependent: a change in output by one firm alters 
the profits of rival firms, perhaps causing them to adjust their output as well. 
Forms of competition under oligopoly vary from vigorous price competition 
to collusion.
	
3.3	
Theories of perfect competition and monopoly
Within the neoclassical theory, different models describe price and output 
determination for different market structures. The most important character-
istics of market structure are the number of firms, the extent of barriers to 
entry, and the degree of product differentiation. Table 3.1 shows a standard 
typology of market structures. The two most extreme cases are perfect com-
petition (the most competitive model) and monopoly (the least competitive). 
Section 3.3 examines these two cases, and Section 3.4 draws some compari-
sons between their efficiency and welfare properties. Occupying a large swathe 
of territory between perfect competition and monopoly is imperfect competi-
tion, which subdivides into two cases: monopolistic competition (the more com-
petitive variant of imperfect competition) and oligopoly (the less competitive 

68	
|	 3    ■    The neoclassical theory of the firm 
variant). This chapter concludes in Section 3.5 by examining the first of these 
two cases: monopolistic competition. Oligopoly theory forms a much larger 
sub-field within microeconomics and industrial economics, and requires its 
own separate and more extensive treatment. Accordingly, oligopoly theory is 
covered in detail later (see Chapters 7, 8 and 9).
Perfect competition
In the neoclassical theory of perfect competition, the industry is assumed to have 
the following characteristics:
■ There are large numbers of buyers and sellers. It is sometimes said that buyers 
and sellers are atomistic. An important implication is that the actions of any 
individual buyer or seller have a negligible influence on the market price.
■ Firms are free to enter into or exit from the industry, and a decision to enter 
or exit does not impose any additional costs on the firm concerned. There are 
no barriers to entry and exit.
■ The goods or services produced and sold are identical or homogeneous. There 
is no product differentiation.
■ All buyers and sellers have perfect information. There are no transaction costs, 
such as costs incurred in searching for information or in negotiating or moni-
toring contracts between buyers and sellers.
■ There are no transport costs. Therefore, the geographical locations of buyers 
and sellers do not influence their decisions on where to buy or sell.
■ Firms act independently of each other, with each firm seeking to maximise its 
own profit.
These assumptions ensure each individual buyer and seller is a price taker. 
Price-taking behaviour implies each buyer and seller operates under the 
assumption that the current market price is beyond his or her personal control. 
Each firm recognises its market share is sufficiently small that any decision 
to raise or lower its output would have a negligible impact on the industry’s 
total output and, therefore, a negligible impact on the market price. Therefore, 
each firm believes it can sell whatever quantity of output it wishes to sell at 
the current market price. An important implication of price-taking behaviour

is that any attempt on the part of an individual firm to increase or decrease 
its own price directly would be ineffective. If the firm set a higher price than 
its competitors, all of the firm’s customers would immediately switch to its 
competitors and the quantity of output sold by the firm would fall to zero. 
On the other hand, it would be pointless for the firm to set a lower price than 
its competitors because the firm can already sell as much output as it wishes 
at the current market price.
With price-taking behaviour, each firm faces a horizontal firm-level demand 
function, located at the current market price. A very small proportionate 
reduction in price would induce a very large proportionate increase in quan-
tity demanded. This implies the perfectly competitive firm’s price elasticity of 
demand (PED) is infinite. Recall  PED = -PED = - ∆Q
∆P * P
Q. Accordingly, 
if ∆P is infinitely small (and negative) and ∆Q is infinitely large (and positive), 
PED = - ∞ or  PED = ∞. The firm’s demand function is also its average 
revenue (AR) function (see Section 2.3). Finally, given that the firm’s demand 
or AR function is horizontal, the same function is also the firm’s marginal rev-
enue (MR) function. The equivalence between marginal revenue and price when 
 PED = ∞ can be demonstrated as follows:
MR = P a1 -
1
 PED b = P a1 - 1
∞b = P(1 - 0) = P
The analysis of the perfectly competitive firm’s short-run and long-run cost 
structure was described earlier (see Section 2.2). The firm’s profit-maximizing 
output decision can be analysed, both in the short-run case, and in the long run. 
In order to keep the analysis as simple as possible, in the short run it is assumed 
that each firm is already using the quantity of the fixed factor of production 
(capital) that will eventually be consistent with the minimization of long-run 
average costs, or production at the minimum efficient scale (MES), in the long 
run. For simplicity, it is assumed that fixed costs are zero, so the firm’s AVC 
and SRAC functions are the same. Figure 3.1 shows the determination of the 
pre- and post-entry market price and the output levels for one representative 
firm and for the industry as a whole. To understand Figure 3.1, it is important 
to follow the construction of the firm- and industry-level diagrams in the correct 
sequence, as follows:
■ The upper left-hand diagram shows the firm’s SRAC and SRMC functions. 
The firm’s MR function is horizontal and equivalent to the market price (P). 
Profit maximization requires MR = SRMC, so the firm’s profit-maximizing 
output level for any given value of P will be found by reading from the SRMC 
function. To produce any output at all, the firm must at least cover its SRAC. 
Therefore, the minimum price the firm is willing to accept is determined by the 
intersection of SRMC and SRAC. The section of SRMC above this intersec-
tion is the representative firm’s supply function.
■ The upper right-hand diagram shows the market demand function and the 
industry supply function. The industry supply function is constructed by 

70	
|	 3    ■    The neoclassical theory of the firm 
Figure 3.1  Short-run pre-entry and post-entry equilibria in perfect competition
summing horizontally the SRMC functions over all N1 firms in the industry. 
(Each individual SRMC function is a supply function for one firm, therefore 
the horizontal sum of the SRMC functions is the supply function for the entire 
industry.) The pre-entry market price of P1 is determined by the intersection of 
the market demand and industry supply functions. Pre-entry industry output 
is Q1.
■ Returning to the upper left-hand diagram, the representative firm’s demand, AR 
and MR functions are shown by the horizontal line at P1. The firm maximises 
profit by producing q1 units of output, at which MR = SRMC. By construction 
q1 = Q1/N1, or Q1 = N1q1. At the pre-entry profit-maximizing equilibrium rep-
resented by P1 and q1, the representative firm earns an abnormal profit shown 
by the shaded area between P1 and C1, the firm’s average cost.
■ The availability of abnormal profits attracts entrants, so (P1, Q1) cannot repre-
sent a final or stable equilibrium. Entry increases the number of firms from N1 
to N2, and in the lower right-hand diagram shifts the industry supply function 
to the right from S1 to S2. Consequently, price falls from P1 to P2, and industry 
output increases from Q1 to Q2.

	
	
	
3.3  Theories of perfect competition and monopoly	 |	
71
Figure 3.2  Long-run post-entry equilibrium in perfect competition
■ In the lower left-hand diagram, the representative firm’s post-entry demand, 
AR and MR functions are shown by the horizontal line at P2. The firm maxi-
mises profit by producing q2 units of output, at which MR = SRMC. By 
construction q2 = Q2/N2, or Q2 = N2q2. At the post-entry profit-maximizing 
equilibrium represented by P2 and q2, the representative firm earns a normal 
profit only, because P2 coincides with C2, the firm’s average cost. The fall in 
market price caused by entry and the increase in industry supply eliminates 
the pre-entry abnormal profit. Post-entry, each individual firm produces less 
output than it did pre-entry, but total post-entry industry output increases due 
to the increase in the number of firms.
Figure 3.2 shows the equivalent long-run analysis and, for simplicity, 
shows only the final (post-entry) equilibrium, corresponding to (P2, Q2) in 
Figure 3.1. In Figure 3.2, all short-run functions are identical to those in 
Figure 3.1. In addition, the left-hand diagram shows the representative firm’s 
long-run marginal cost (LRMC) and long-run average cost (LRAC) func-
tions. Notice that SRAC is nested within LRAC, as in Figure 2.4. In the 
right-hand diagram of Figure 3.2, the long-run industry supply function is 
constructed by summing LRMC horizontally over all N2 firms, in the same 
way as before. The equilibrium market price of P2 is located by the intersec-
tion of both the short-run and long-run supply functions with the market 
demand function.
Monopoly
In the neoclassical theory of monopoly, the industry is assumed to have the fol-
lowing characteristics:
■ There are large numbers of atomistic buyers, but there is only one seller. There-
fore the selling firm’s demand function is the market demand function, and the 
firm’s output decision determines the market price.

72	
|	 3    ■    The neoclassical theory of the firm 
Figure 3.3  Long-run equilibrium in monopoly
■ Barriers to entry are insurmountable. If the monopolist earns an abnormal 
profit, there is no threat that entrants will be attracted into the industry.
■ The good or service produced and sold is unique, and there are no substitutes. 
There is complete product differentiation.
■ The buyers and the seller may have perfect or imperfect information.
■ Geographical location could be the defining characteristic which gives the 
selling firm its monopoly position. In a spatial monopoly, transport costs are 
sufficiently high to prevent buyers from switching to alternative sellers located 
in other regions or countries.
■ The selling firm seeks to maximise its own profit.
As before, the analysis of the monopolist’s short-run and long-run cost structure 
is as described earlier (see Section 2.2). Figure 3.3 shows the determination of price 
and output. To understand Figure 3.3, it is important to note the following points:
■ Since there is only one firm, Figure 3.3 does not distinguish between the firm 
and the industry. By definition, the monopolist’s private price and output deci-
sions immediately establish the market price and the industry output. This 
means that for a monopoly, there is no industry supply function. Industry 
output depends on the monopolist’s private profit-maximizing output decision, 
which in turn depends on the shape of the monopolist’s cost and revenue func-
tions. In contrast to the case of perfect competition, it is not possible to express 
this decision in the form of a direct supply relationship between market price 
and industry output.
■ Since there is no entry, Figure 3.3 does not distinguish between the pre-entry 
and post-entry equilibria.

73
■ For simplicity the analysis in Figure 3.3 is limited to the long-run case: the 
monopolist’s short-run average and marginal cost functions are not shown.
The monopolist’s profit-maximizing output level of Q1 is located at the inter-
section of the marginal revenue (MR) and the SRMC and LRMC functions. 
The market price of P1 is established by reading from the market demand or 
average revenue (AR) function at Q1, and the monopolist’s average cost of C1 
is established by reading from the average cost functions at Q1. In this case, the 
monopolist earns an abnormal profit represented by the shaded area between P1 
and C1. See Appendix 1 for a mathematical derivation of the monopolist’s profit-
maximizing equilibrium for the case where LRAC and LRMC are horizontal.
	
3.4	
Efficiency and welfare properties of perfect competition 
and monopoly
In much of the academic, political and media discussion about the role of market 
forces and competition in allocating resources in a free-market economy, there 
is a strong presumption that competition is a desirable ideal, and monopoly is a 
state of affairs to be avoided if possible. Figure 3.4 presents a comparison of the 
long-run industry equilibrium under perfect competition and monopoly for the 
special case of constant returns to scale, in which the LRAC and LRMC func-
tions are horizontal and identical (see Section 2.2).
Under perfect competition, the industry supply function is a horizontal sum-
mation of the firms’ horizontal LRMC functions, and is also horizontal. Industry 
price and output is (PC, QC), at which P = LRAC and abnormal profit is zero. 
Under monopoly, the profit-maximizing price and output is (P1, Q1), at which 
MR = LRMC and abnormal profit is positive.
Figure 3.4  Allocative inefficiency in monopoly

74	
|	 3    ■    The neoclassical theory of the firm 
Figure 3.4 indicates that, under monopoly, market price is higher and output 
is lower than under perfect competition. The monopolist earns an abnormal 
profit in the long run, while the perfectly competitive firm earns only a nor-
mal profit. In the more general case of an L- or U-shaped LRAC function, the 
monopolist fails to produce at the minimum efficient scale (MES), and therefore 
fails to produce at the minimum attainable LRAC (see Figure 3.3). In contrast, 
the perfectly competitive firm produces at the minimum attainable LRAC (see 
Figure 3.2).
In perfect competition, price equals (short-run or long-run) marginal cost. This 
suggests that the degree to which price exceeds marginal cost provides a useful 
indicator or measure of market power. Accordingly, Lerner (1934) proposes the 
following measure of market power, known as the Lerner index:
L = P - MC
P
The Lerner index is subject to a minimum value of zero, and a maximum value 
of one. In perfect competition, P = MC so L = 0. In monopoly P 7 MC, and 
if MC 7 0, 0 6 L 6 1. After some simple manipulations, the Lerner index can 
also be expressed in terms of price elasticity of demand:
MR = P a1 -
1
 PED b = P -
P
 PED 1 P - MR =
P
 PED
1 P - MR
P
=
1
 PED
For a profit-maximizing firm, MR = MC. Therefore:
P - MC
P
=
1
 PED , or L =
1
 PED
The Lerner index is the reciprocal of the firm’s price elasticity of demand. In per-
fect competition,  PED = ∞ for each firm, so L = 0 (as above). In monopoly, 
if MC 7 0 then MR 7 0 and  PED 7 1, so 0 6 L 6 1 (as above).
The Lerner index provides a convenient measure of a firm’s market power 
based on the relationship between its price and marginal cost. However, does 
it actually matter that market price and profit are higher under monopoly than 
under perfect competition? This might be bad news for consumers, but it is also 
good news for producers. In practice, a slightly more sophisticated comparison 
is usually required, taking account of both the efficiency and welfare properties 
of the two models. On the basis of this kind of comparison, it can be shown 
that perfect competition is usually preferable to monopoly, because the long-run 
competitive equilibrium has several desirable properties that are not satisfied by 
the corresponding long-run monopoly equilibrium. However, the first task is to 
define the relevant notions of efficiency.
Allocative efficiency is achieved when there is no possible reallocation of 
resources that could make one agent (producer or consumer) better off without 

	
	
	
3.4  Efficiency and welfare properties of perfect competition and monopoly	 |	
75
making at least one other agent worse off. A necessary condition for allocative 
efficiency is that the marginal benefit (to society as a whole) of an additional unit 
of output being produced equals the marginal cost of producing the additional 
unit of output. The market price (the price at which the most marginal consumer 
is prepared to buy) is interpreted as a measure of the value society as a whole 
places on the most marginal unit of output produced. Accordingly, allocative 
efficiency requires that the total quantity of output produced should be such that 
price equals marginal cost.
■ If price exceeds marginal cost, the value that society would place on an addi-
tional unit of output (measured by the price the most marginal consumer is 
prepared to pay) exceeds the cost of producing that unit. Therefore, the indus-
try’s output is currently too low. Welfare could be increased by producing more 
output.
■ If price is below marginal cost, the value that society places on the last unit of 
output produced (again measured by the price the most marginal consumer 
is prepared to pay) is less than the cost of producing that unit. Therefore, the 
industry’s output is currently too high. Welfare could be increased by produc-
ing less output.
Quite distinct from allocative efficiency is the notion of productive efficiency, 
which consists of two components. First, a firm is technically efficient, also 
known as x-efficient, if it is producing the maximum quantity of output that is 
technologically feasible, given the quantities of the factor inputs it is currently 
employing. In other words, a technically efficient firm operates on (and not 
within) its own production function (Leibenstein, 1966). Second, a firm is economi-
cally efficient if it has selected the combination of factor inputs that enable it to 
produce its current output level at the lowest possible cost, given the prevailing 
prices of the factor inputs available to the firm (Leibenstein, 1966; Comanor and 
Figure 3.5  Monopoly and perfect competition compared

76	
|	 3    ■    The neoclassical theory of the firm 
Leibenstein, 1969). A firm might be technically efficient but economically inef-
ficient, if it uses its selected inputs to produce as much output as is technologi-
cally feasible, but it could produce the same quantity of output more cheaply by 
selecting a different combination of inputs.
Figures 3.5 and 3.6 draw a comparison between the efficiency properties of the 
perfectly competitive equilibrium and the profit-maximizing equilibrium under 
monopoly. In common with Figures 3.3 and 3.4, Figures 3.5 and 3.6 are based 
on an assumption of constant returns to scale, and horizontal long-run average 
cost (LRAC) and long-run marginal cost (LRMC) functions. Figure 3.5 com-
pares perfect competition and monopoly on allocative efficiency criteria, while 
Figure 3.6 also incorporates productive efficiency criteria.
In Figure 3.5, the horizontal LRMC function is also the industry supply func-
tion under perfect competition, and the equilibrium market price and output are 
PC and QC, located at the intersection of the industry supply and market demand 
functions. Since PC = LRMC, the condition for allocative efficiency is satisfied. 
The profit-maximizing monopolist chooses a price and output level of P1 and Q1, 
located at the intersection of the MR and LRMC functions. Since P1 7 LRMC, 
the condition for allocative efficiency is not satisfied. Welfare would be increased 
by producing more output than Q1. The superior welfare properties of the per-
fectly competitive equilibrium can also be demonstrated with reference to the 
welfare economics concepts of consumer surplus and producer surplus.
Consumer surplus is the sum over all consumers of the difference between the 
maximum amount each consumer would be prepared to pay and the price each 
consumer actually does pay. Imagine consumers arrayed along the horizontal 
axis of Figure 3.5 in descending order of their willingness to pay (reading from 
left to right).
■ At the perfectly competitive equilibrium (PC, QC) consumer surplus is repre-
sented by the triangle A + B + C. The first consumer is willing to pay PMAX 
but actually pays PC. The second consumer is willing to pay slightly less than 
PMAX but actually pays PC. The last consumer (at QC) is willing to pay PC and 
actually pays PC.
■ At the monopoly equilibrium (P1, Q1) consumer surplus is represented by the 
triangle A. As before, the first consumer is willing to pay PMAX but actually 
pays P1, and so on. The last consumer (at Q1) is willing to pay P1 and actually 
pays P1.
Producer surplus is the total reward producers receive beyond the reward they 
require to cover their costs of production, including their normal profit. In the 
present case, producer surplus is equivalent to abnormal profit.
■ At the perfectly competitive equilibrium (PC, QC), producer surplus is zero 
because there is no abnormal profit.
■ At the monopoly equilibrium (P1, Q1), producer surplus is represented by the 
rectangle B, equivalent to the monopolist’s abnormal profit.
Under perfect competition, consumer surplus is A + B + C and producer sur-
plus is nil. The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is A + B + C.

Figure 3.6  Allocative inefficiency and productive inefficiency in monopoly
Under monopoly, consumer surplus is A and producer surplus is B. The sum of 
consumer surplus and producer surplus is A + B. The triangle C is known as 
the deadweight loss associated with monopoly. It represents the total welfare loss 
resulting from the fact that less output is produced under monopoly than under 
perfect competition. It is important to notice that the transfer of surplus of B 
from consumers to the producer does not form part of the critique of monopoly 
from a welfare economics perspective, because welfare economics does not make 
distributional judgements as to whose welfare should be maximised. However, 
the existence of a deadweight loss does form part of this critique, since it implies 
the welfare of at least one agent could be increased without reducing the welfare 
of any other agent or agents. For example, if the market structure were changed 
from monopoly to perfect competition, and the consumers gave the monopolist a 
compensating side payment of B, the consumers would be better off (their surplus 
net of the side payment having risen from A to A + C) and the producer would 
be no worse off (the loss of producer surplus of B having been compensated by 
the side payment).
Figure 3.5 makes the case that monopoly is less desirable than perfect competi-
tion using an allocative efficiency criterion. The possibility that monopoly might 
also be less desirable based on a productive efficiency criterion rests on the sug-
gestion that a monopolist shielded from competitive pressure (emanating either 
from rival firms or from actual or potential entrants) may tend to become com-
placent or lazy, and therefore inefficient in production. A complacent monopo-
list may not strive to make the most efficient use of its factor inputs (technical 
inefficiency), or it may not identify its most cost-effective combination of factor 
inputs (economic inefficiency). Consequently the monopolist may operate on 
a higher LRAC and LRMC function than it would attain if the full rigours of 
competition forced it to produce as efficiently as possible.
Figure 3.6 identifies the further welfare loss resulting from productive inef-
ficiency on the part of the complacent monopolist. LRAC1 = LRMC1 is the 
same as LRAC = LRMC in Figure 3.5, and (P1, Q1) is also the same in both

diagrams. LRAC2 = LRMC2 represents the complacent monopolist’s cost func-
tions. The complacent monopolist’s profit-maximizing price and output are P2 
and Q2. Examining the welfare implications of shifting from (P1, Q1) to (P2, Q2), 
the following conclusions emerge:
■ Consumer surplus falls from D + E + F ( = A in Figure 3.5) to D.
■ Producer surplus falls from G + H + J + K ( = B in Figure 3.5) to E + G.
■ Therefore (consumer surplus plus producer surplus) falls by F + H + J + K.
■ J represents the increase in the cost of producing Q2 units of output resulting 
from productive inefficiency.
■ F + H + K represents the increase in the deadweight loss resulting from the 
reduction in output from Q1 to Q2.
Is monopoly always inferior to perfect competition on efficiency and wel-
fare criteria? This section concludes by examining one special case for which the 
comparison is not clear-cut. A natural monopoly is a market in which LRAC is 
decreasing as output increases over the entire range of outputs that could con-
ceivably be produced, given the position of the market demand function. In other 
words, there is insufficient demand for any firm to produce the output level at 
which all opportunities for further savings in average costs through economies of 
scale are exhausted, or at which the minimum efficient scale (MES) is attained. In 
a natural monopoly, monopoly is always a more cost-effective market structure 
than competition. LRAC is lower if one firm services the entire market than if 
two (or more) firms share the market between them. Industries where the costs 
of indivisibilities represent a large proportion of total costs, and where total costs 
do not increase much as output increases, are most likely to exhibit the character-
istics of natural monopoly. Perhaps the most widely cited examples are the utili-
ties, such as gas, electricity and water. A vast and costly physical infrastructure 
is required in order to distribute these products but, once this infrastructure is in 
place, fluctuations in the quantities traded cause only relatively minor variations 
in total costs.
The case of natural monopoly is illustrated in Figure 3.7.
■ To maximise profit, the monopolist produces Q1 units of output, and charges 
a price of P1. Average cost is C1, and the monopolist earns an abnormal profit, 
represented by area A.
■ If the monopolist were forced to produce Q2 units of output, then price would 
fall to P2 = C2 (6 C1) and the monopolist would earn only a normal profit.
■ To achieve allocative efficiency (price equals marginal cost), the monopo-
list would have to produce Q3 units of output. Average cost would fall to 
C3 (6 C2 6 C1), but price would fall to P3 and the monopolist would realise 
a loss, represented by area B.
In the case of natural monopoly, allocative efficiency might not be attainable 
because the monopolist would rather go out of business altogether than operate 
at (P3, Q3). However, on efficiency and welfare criteria, it would be preferable for 
the monopolist to operate at (P2, Q2) rather than at the monopolist’s preferred

3.5	
Theory of monopolistic competition
The theory of imperfect competition attempts to draw together the polar cases 
of perfect competition and monopoly. Imperfect competition encompasses both 
oligopoly (see Chapters 7, 8 and 9) and monopolistic competition, described 
here in this final section of Chapter 3. In the neoclassical theory of monopolistic 
competition, the industry is assumed to have the following characteristics:
■ There are large numbers of atomistic buyers and sellers.
■ Firms are free to enter into or exit from the industry, and a decision to enter 
or exit does not impose any additional costs on the firm concerned. In other 
words, there are no barriers to entry and exit.
■ The goods or services produced and sold by each firm are perceived by con-
sumers to be similar but not identical. In other words, there is some product 
differentiation. There could be real differences between the goods or services 
produced by each firm, or the differences could be imagined, with consumers’ 
perceptions of differences reinforced by branding or advertising.
■ The buyers and the sellers may have perfect or imperfect information. If the 
product differentiation is perceived rather than real, this suggests that the 
buyers’ information is in some sense imperfect.
■ Geographic location could be the characteristic that differentiates the product 
or service produced by one firm from those of its competitors. In this case, 
transport costs may to some extent deter buyers from switching to alterna-
tive sellers located elsewhere. However, each firm’s market is not completely 

80	
|	 3    ■    The neoclassical theory of the firm 
segmented geographically. Any firm that raises its price too far will find that 
its customers start switching to other sellers.
■ Each selling firm seeks to maximise its own profit.
These assumptions ensure each individual firm has some discretion over its own 
price. Due to product differentiation, each firm can exercise some market power. 
In contrast to the perfectly competitive firm, a firm in monopolistic competition 
that raises its price does not immediately lose all of its customers, and a firm that 
lowers its price does not immediately acquire all of its competitors’ customers. 
Therefore, non-price-taking behaviour is assumed on the part of each firm. Each 
firm faces a demand function that is downward sloping (not horizontal as in 
perfect competition). However, the firm’s discretion over its own price is limited 
by the fact that its product is quite similar to its competitors’ products. If the 
firm does increase its price, it tends to lose customers to its competitors rapidly; 
similarly, by cutting its price the firm can attract customers rapidly. Therefore, 
the firm’s demand function is relatively price elastic, more so than the market 
demand function faced by the monopolist.
The assumption that buyers and sellers are atomistic under monopolistic 
competition has implications for the way in which equilibrium is determined. 
Under atomistic competition, each firm believes its market share is sufficiently 
small that any decision to raise or lower its own price or output has a negligible 
impact on its competitors’ individual demand functions, and therefore a negli-
gible impact on their price and output decisions. The firms are sufficiently small 
and plentiful that the issue of interdependence can be ignored: the possibility that 
any one firm’s profit-maximizing price and output decisions carries implications 
for all of the other firms’ decisions.
Figure 3.8 shows the determination of the pre- and post-entry market price and 
output levels for one representative firm in monopolistic competition. Because 
each firm sells a differentiated product, there is no market demand function 
and no industry-level analysis. The upper diagram shows the firm’s SRAC and 
SRMC functions. In accordance with the previous discussion, the firm’s AR and 
MR functions are downward sloping. The firm maximises profit by producing 
q1 units of output, at which MR = SRMC. At the pre-entry profit-maximizing 
equilibrium represented by P1 and q1, the representative firm earns an abnormal 
profit shown by the shaded area between P1 and C1.
As in perfect competition, the availability of abnormal profits attracts 
entrants, so (P1, q1) cannot be a final or a stable equilibrium. Entry increases the 
number of firms, and in the lower diagram causes the representative firm’s AR 
and MR functions to shift to the left. The firm maximises profit by producing q2 
units of output, at which MR2 = SRMC. At the post-entry profit-maximizing 
equilibrium represented by P2 and q2, the representative firm earns a normal 
profit only. The fall in market price caused by entry has eliminated the pre-entry 
abnormal profit. Post-entry, each individual firm produces less output than it did 
pre-entry. (P2, q2) represents the tangency solution to the model of monopolistic 
competition, so called because the firm’s AR function is tangential to its SRAC 
function. There is a similar tangency solution to the long-run model (not shown 
in Figure 3.8).

Figure 3.8  Short-run pre-entry and post-entry equilibria in monopolistic competition
Using the criteria developed in Section 3.4, the efficiency and welfare proper-
ties of the long-run equilibrium under monopolistic competition are as follows:
■ The representative firm under monopolistic competition fails to produce at the 
minimum efficient scale (as is usually the case in monopoly), and therefore fails 
to produce at the minimum attainable long-run average cost.
■ The representative monopolistic competitor earns only a normal profit in the 
long run (as in the case of perfect competition).
■ The representative monopolistic competitor sells at a price that exceeds its 
marginal cost. Accordingly, there is allocative inefficiency (as in the case of 
monopoly). Each firm’s output, and the total industry output, is lower than 
is required for the maximization of welfare. There is a deadweight loss.
■ The market power enjoyed by the representative monopolistic competitor, 
thanks to its differentiated product, might enable the firm to operate without 
achieving full efficiency in production (as in the case of monopoly). Monop-
olistic competition might be compatible with either technical inefficiency 

82	
|	 3    ■    The neoclassical theory of the firm 
(x-inefficiency) or economic inefficiency, or both. However, in contrast to 
the monopolist, the monopolistic competitor is not fully shielded from the 
rigours of competition. A monopolistic competitor that is producing ineffi-
ciently is vulnerable to the threat of competition from incumbents or entrants. 
An efficient incumbent or entrant might imitate the inefficient firm’s product 
characteristics, and be capable of undercutting the inefficient firm on price, 
because its costs are lower. Therefore, the degree to which the monopolistic 
competitor can operate at less than full efficiency is severely constrained by 
the lack of entry barriers and the threat of actual or potential competition.
	
3.6	
Summary
Chapter 3 has traced the historical development of the neoclassical theory of the 
firm, and has reviewed several important neoclassical models of the firm, includ-
ing perfect competition, monopoly and monopolistic competition.
In the model of perfect competition, there are large numbers of atomistic buy-
ers and sellers, firms are free to enter into or exit from the industry, and there 
is no product differentiation. All buyers and sellers are assumed to have perfect 
information, and there are no transaction or transport costs that could otherwise 
protect individual firms from the full rigours of competition. At the long-run 
equilibrium, each firm produces at the minimum point on its long-run aver-
age cost function, and earns only a normal profit. There is allocative efficiency 
because the market price equals each firm’s marginal cost. Competitive discipline 
ensures that all firms must either achieve full efficiency in production, or fail to 
realise a normal profit at the long-run equilibrium market price and face being 
forced out of business.
In the model of monopoly there is only one seller, there are insurmountable 
barriers to entry, and there is complete product differentiation in the sense that 
no other firm produces a substitute product that could undermine the monopo-
list’s market power. At the long-run equilibrium, the monopolist charges a higher 
price and produces less output than would occur if the monopolist were replaced 
by (or broken down into) a large number of small, perfectly competitive firms. 
The monopolist typically fails to produce at the minimum point on its long-run 
average cost function, but it can earn an abnormal profit in the long run. The 
monopolist charges a price higher than its marginal cost, so there is allocative 
inefficiency. The lack of competitive discipline suggests that the monopolist may 
be able to operate without achieving full efficiency in production.
The model of monopolistic competition falls between the polar cases of perfect 
competition and monopoly. The industry comprises many firms and entry is 
possible, but product differentiation affords the firms a degree of market power 
that is not available to their perfectly competitive counterparts. The absence of 
barriers to entry ensures the firms are only able to earn a normal profit in the 
long run. The firms also fail to produce at the minimum efficient scale and fail 
to achieve allocative efficiency, because price exceeds marginal cost at the long-
run equilibrium. It is possible that the firms’ market power may permit them

to operate without achieving full productive efficiency. However, the degree of 
inefficiency that is sustainable is constrained by the threat of competition from 
incumbents and entrants.

Introduction
Previously, we examined the neoclassical theory of the firm, and the models of 
perfect competition, monopoly and monopolistic competition (see Chapter 3). 
In the neoclassical theory, the role of the firm is to allocate resources and orga-
nise production in such a way as to satisfy consumer wants, driven by the desire 
to maximise profits. Chapter 4 describes the development of several alternative 
theories of the firm. The objective of introducing more realism into the theory of 
the firm motivates the development of most, if not all, of the alternative theories 
described in this and the next chapter.

Section 4.2 motivates the development of alternatives to the neoclassical the-
ory of the firm by discussing some of the main limitations and criticisms of the 
neoclassical theory. Some of the earliest challenges to the neoclassical theory 
developed in the light of growing evidence of the increasing complexity of firms 
and the separation of the ownership of large corporations (in the hands of share-
holders) from control (in the hands of salaried managers). While the neoclassical 
theory assumes that firms operate so as to maximise the interests of their owners, 
some economists started to acknowledge that managers’ objectives may differ 
from those of the shareholders. Section 4.3 examines the managerial theories of 
sales revenue maximization, growth maximization and managerial utility maxi-
mization. Section 4.4 examines a behavioural theory of the firm that has its roots 
in both economics and organizational science.
	
4.2	
Critique of the neoclassical theory of the firm
A common criticism levelled at the neoclassical theory of the firm is that it is 
insufficiently realistic. The theory is largely based on outdated views of competi-
tion and entrepreneurial activity. In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centu-
ries, the rise of the textile industry and the growing international trade in staples 
provided early economists with concepts which dominated economic thought. 
During this era, price competition was both intense and instantaneous, goods 
produced by competing suppliers were usually similar or identical, there were few 
trade secrets, and markets were populated by large numbers of buyers and sellers. 
In later periods, however, the theoretical model of the firm that was developed 
against this background became subject to several forms of criticism:
■ Organizational goals. The neoclassical theory assumes that firms seek to max-
imise profit. In reality, however, the managers of a firm may pursue other 
objectives, such as the maximization of sales, growth or market share, or goals 
related to their own status or job security, or perhaps the enjoyment of a quiet 
life. Simon (1959) argues that the firm’s managers may aim for a satisfactory 
profit, or a profit that is sufficient to allow them to pursue other objectives.
■ Uncertainty and imperfect information. In practice, all economic decisions are 
based on assumptions or predictions about near or future events. Implicit in the 
neoclassical theory is an assumption that the firm’s decision-makers can make 
accurate predictions, or at least be able to assign probabilities to various pos-
sible future events. Decision-makers must be able to anticipate changes in con-
sumer tastes, changes in technology, changes in factor markets and the likely 
reactions of rivals. In practice, such events are extremely difficult to foresee.
■ Organizational complexity. Modern firms are complex hierarchical organiza-
tions, bound together by complex communications networks. In practice, 
breakdowns in communications occur frequently. The larger the size of the 
organization, the greater the likelihood that information is distorted, either 
deliberately or accidentally. Misinformation reduces the ability of the firm’s 
decision-makers to reach correct decisions.

	
	
	
4.2  Critique of the neoclassical theory of the firm	 |	
87
■ Decision-making. According to the neoclassical theory, the firm’s decision-
makers decide which inputs to purchase and how much output to produce 
by applying rules such as marginal revenue equals marginal cost. However, 
empirical evidence suggests that many businessmen and women do not employ 
such methods. Instead, they often rely on simpler decision-making conven-
tions or rules-of-thumb. In a seminal article, Hall and Hitch (1939) report 
the outcomes of interviews with decision-makers at 38 firms. Very few had 
even heard of the concepts of marginal cost and revenue, or price elasticity 
of demand. Instead, many set their prices by calculating their average cost, 
and adding a markup that included a margin for profit. This pricing method, 
known as cost plus pricing, is examined in Chapter 14. Neoclassical profit 
maximization requires that both demand and costs are taken into account in 
determining price and quantity, while cost plus focuses on average cost.
In defence of the neoclassical theory, Friedman (1953) argues that some critics 
miss the point by attacking the validity of the assumptions on which the theory 
is constructed. The objective of any science is to develop theories or hypotheses 
which lead to valid and accurate predictions about future outcomes. The only 
relevant test of the validity of a theory is whether its predictions are close to the 
eventual outcome. Friedman argues that the proper test of an assumption such as 
profit maximization is not whether it is realistic, but whether it enables accurate 
predictions to be generated from the theory on which it is based (Rotwein, 1962; 
Melitz, 1965).
Machlup (1946, 1967) argues for the essential validity of the profit maximiza-
tion assumption, even if it does not provide a literal description of reality. Most 
decision-makers have an intuitive feel for what is required to come close to a 
profit-maximizing outcome, even if they are unable to articulate their practices 
using the same terminology or with the same precision as economists. The practi-
cal implementation of marginal analysis should not require anything more dif-
ficult than an ability to formulate subjective estimates, hunches and guesses. By 
analogy, motorists execute complex manoeuvres such as overtaking intuitively, 
rather than by using precise and complex mathematical formulae to judge the 
speeds and distances needed to overtake successfully. Using similar reasoning 
but adding a Darwinian slant, Alchian (1965) argues that firms that survive in 
the long run are those that have come close to long-run profit maximization, 
either deliberately or intuitively or perhaps even inadvertently. Accordingly, the 
neoclassical theory accurately describes the behaviour of surviving firms.
An essentially static conception of competition is emphasised in the neoclassi-
cal models of perfect competition, monopolistic competition and monopoly. In 
the neoclassical theory, the entrepreneur is the personification of the firm, but 
otherwise plays a rather unimportant role. Price competition is the only form of 
rivalry. In contrast, Schumpeter (1942) and the Austrian school give the entrepre-
neur a central role within a more dynamic model of competition. By initiating 
technological change by means of innovation, the Schumpeterian entrepreneur 
is the main driving force behind economic progress. Innovation revolutionises 
economic conditions by replacing old production methods with new and superior 
ones. Successful innovation is the fundamental source of monopoly status and 

88	
|	 4    ■    Managerial and behavioural theories of the firm
abnormal profit. Abnormal or monopoly profit is only a temporary phenom-
enon, however, because eventually the market for a new product will be flooded 
by imitators, or the original innovation will be superseded by further techno-
logical progress. The Schumpeterian view of the entrepreneur as innovator is 
examined in more detail in Chapter 18.
The Austrian school also emphasises the role of the entrepreneur. Here the 
entrepreneur plays a crucial role in facilitating the spread of information among 
consumers and resource owners. The entrepreneur spots missed opportunities for 
trade or investment, by acquiring and processing new information more quickly 
than other decision-makers. Through their actions, entrepreneurs contribute to 
the spread of information, enabling other market participants to adjust their 
trading plans accordingly.
The overambitious plans of one period will be replaced by more realistic 
ones; market opportunities overlooked in one period will be exploited in 
the next. In other words, even without changes in the basic data of the 
market (i.e. in consumer tastes, technological possibilities, and resource 
availabilities), the decisions made in one period of time generate systematic 
alterations in the corresponding decisions for the succeeding period. Taken 
over time, this series of systematic changes in the interconnected network 
of market decisions constitutes the market process.
(Kirzner, 1973, p. 10)
The entrepreneur is constantly alert to new and unexploited opportunities to 
earn a profit, and initiates the changes that propel the economy towards a new 
equilibrium. ‘The entrepreneur . . . brings into mutual adjustment those dis-
cordant elements which resulted from prior market ignorance’ (Kirzner, 1973, 
p. 73). Essentially, disequilibrium results from the ignorance of buyers and 
sellers. Potential buyers are unaware of potential sellers and vice versa. Scarce 
resources are sometimes used to produce goods for which there is no market, 
and resources that could be used to produce goods for which a market exists are 
sometimes left idle. The alert entrepreneur intervenes and remedies the situation 
by bringing the potential buyers and sellers together.
Casson (1982) develops a synthesis of several of these theories of entrepre-
neurship. The entrepreneur’s main function is the management, coordination 
and allocation of other scarce resources, using key or privileged information. 
If this is done efficiently, and the key information remains secret, the entrepre-
neur is rewarded with profit or income. However, as in the Schumpeterian and 
­Austrian views, in the long run there is a tendency for the entrepreneurial reward 
to be dissipated. Casson models the entrepreneurial function using a neoclassical-
style demand and supply framework. The demand for entrepreneurs depends 
most crucially on the pace of technological change, which determines the level of 
opportunity for entrepreneurial initiative. The supply of entrepreneurs depends 
on the educational system and qualifications, social networks, institutions and 
the general culture of the society, all of which influence the propensity for entre-
preneurial behaviour and the availability of capital to finance new ventures.

Entrepreneurial rewards tend to be higher when the demand for entrepreneurs 
is high (due to a high level of technological opportunity) and when the supply of 
active entrepreneurs is scarce.
	
4.3	
Separation of ownership from control: managerial 
theories of the firm
As shown earlier (see Section 3.2), by the first half of the twentieth century, 
the foundations for an economic theory of the firm were well established. The 
theory referred to firms that were managed by their owners, and which special-
ised in clearly defined activities. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries, however, reality was already changing. The largest and most suc-
cessful firms were evolving into increasingly complex organizations, buying 
their inputs and selling their products in many different markets. Some econo-
mists became increasingly conscious that these evolving institutions bore little 
resemblance to the simple conception of the firm according to the neoclassical 
theory. There were two important implications. First, increasing organiza-
tional complexity made it impossible for the largest firms to be managed solely 
by a single entrepreneur or owner. Instead, there was a tendency for firms 
to employ large teams of managers, including specialists in functions such 
as marketing, finance and human resource management. Second, it became 
impractical for the individual entrepreneur or owner to finance the growth 
of the largest firms from personal financial resources. Large firms in need of 
finance looked increasingly to the capital markets. Consequently, ownership 
became more widely dispersed, among large numbers of individual or institu-
tional shareholders. Not only did the number of shareholders grow, but the 
nature of share ownership was also changing and becoming more complex. 
Many large individual shareholdings were effectively broken up by progressive 
taxation; there were new demands for share ownership from individuals who 
became newly affluent as patterns of income and wealth distribution evolved 
throughout the course of the twentieth century.
As share ownership became increasingly dispersed, the control of firms, vested 
in the ownership of shares, became increasingly diluted. In many cases, a type of 
power vacuum was created, which was filled by an increasingly dominant cadre 
of managers. This so-called separation or divorce of ownership from control 
provided ammunition for the critics of the neoclassical theory of the firm, who 
argued that there was no reason to suppose that the theory’s assumed objec-
tive of profit maximization would necessarily coincide with the objectives of the 
managers of large firms, the individuals actually taking the decisions. Managers 
might well be tempted to pursue objectives other than profit maximization, such 
as maximizing their own income, status or job security. Furthermore, given that 
shareholders are large in number, widely dispersed and perhaps poorly informed 
and poorly organised, the shareholders’ ability in theory to hire and fire their 
own managers might not be sufficient to force the latter to act in accordance with 
the shareholders’ interests.

|	 4    ■    Managerial and behavioural theories of the firm
Berle and Means (1932) are widely credited with having first identified and 
measured the extent of this separation of ownership from control, although the 
same issue is discussed by Veblen (1923). Classifying a shareholding of between 
20 per cent and 50 per cent held by any individual or group as effective control, 
Berle and Means found that 88 out of 200 large US non-financial corporations 
surveyed in 1929 were management controlled. No one individual owned more 
than 5 per cent of the total stock of any of these 88 firms. Some 30 years later, 
Larner (1966) replicated the Berle and Means study, but adjusted the owner-
ship threshold from 5 per cent to 10 per cent of shares in the hands of a single 
owner. Of the 200 top firms, 84 per cent could be regarded as management 
controlled. The managerial revolution, already in progress in 1929, was close 
to completion by the mid-1960s. Applying similar methodology (but with a 
different definition of an owner-controlled firm) to a UK dataset, Florence 
Sargent (1961) reports that only 30 of a sample of 98 of the largest UK firms 
could be classed as owner controlled. In another sample of smaller firms, only 
89 of 268 firms were owner controlled.
Prais (1976) and Nyman and Silbertson (1978) question the results, as well as 
the research methodology, of these studies. First, the presence of interest groups 
or individuals owning large proportions of shares does not necessarily imply 
there are no effective constraints on management. Second, Berle and Means 
ignore interlocking directorships: an important means of representing the inter-
ests of other firms at board level. Third, Berle and Means classify firms according 
to their ultimate control. If firm A has majority control over firm B and A is man-
agement controlled, B is also regarded as management controlled. This method 
of classification is contentious. Finally, statistical criteria alone are insufficient 
to determine the extent of ownership or managerial control. It is important to 
examine the nature of the shareholdings and their interrelationships including, 
for example, similar or near-similar interest groups such as kinship. Nyman and 
Silbertson advocate studying the nature of control on a case by case basis. This 
approach suggests owner control was much stronger than had previously been 
realised: 55 per cent of the top 250 UK firms had some degree of owner con-
trol, using a 5 per cent threshold for a firm to be classed as owner controlled. 
Using the same ownership threshold, Leech and Leahy (1991) find 91 per cent of 
470 large UK industrial firms were owner controlled using 1983–5 data. Using a 
20 per cent threshold, only 34 per cent were classified as owner controlled.
Although some of the early research concerning the separation of ownership 
from control has been qualified, the original hypothesis that share ownership in 
many large corporations is widely dispersed remains essentially valid, even at 
the start of the twenty-first century. Does this imply that the managers of these 
organizations enjoy the freedom to pursue goals and objectives different from 
those of the owners? In practice, there are several reasons why the managers 
might not wish to depart too far from the owners’ objectives:
■ If the managers are perceived to be running the organization badly, in prin-
ciple the shareholders can mobilise themselves to dismiss the managers at a 
shareholders’ general meeting. In practice, however, this may be difficult to 
organise. First, some shareholders might not wish to disrupt continuity by

91
voting for wholesale dismissals. Second, shareholders might not necessarily be 
able to assess the degree to which the managers are failing in their duties. Third, 
even knowledgeable shareholders may be unable to disseminate the relevant 
information, due to the costs incurred in printing leaflets, arranging meetings, 
dealing with the press and so on. Finally, disaffected shareholders can often 
be outvoted at a general meeting by proxy votes held by the chair. Sharehold-
ers not wishing to attend a meeting, normally the majority, can nominate a 
proxy to vote on their behalf, but proxy votes are often assigned to the firm’s 
managers. Ultimately, disaffected shareholders may only be able to influence 
the management by selling their shareholdings, depressing the firm’s market 
valuation. Case studies 4.1 and 4.2 discuss two contrasting examples of the 
exercise of shareholder power.
■ Although shareholders may lack clear information concerning the per-
formance of management, managers of other firms may not be subject to 
the same constraints. Rival management teams, who perhaps face similar 
demand and cost conditions, may be in a good position to detect underper-
formance. If the market valuation of a firm’s shares is relatively low but its 
financial structure is sound, the firm may be vulnerable to a takeover bid. 
Recognition of this danger reduces the managers’ incentives to pursue non-
profit-maximizing objectives.
■ If the firm relies on external sources of finance, its managers may face addi-
tional constraints in the form of scrutiny by lending institutions such as mer-
chant banks or investment companies. On the whole, UK firms tend not to rely 
heavily on external sources of finance. Nevertheless, investment banks often 
arrange new issues, secure external finance and provide advice; and a number 
of large UK companies have investment bank representation on their boards.

Shareholder rebellion brews over Old Mutual 
CEO pay proposal
FT
A shareholder rebellion was brewing on Wednesday at Old Mutual after the financial 
services group proposed a payout of 1,000 per cent of base salary for its chief execu-
tive. Some of the group’s biggest investors said they were considering a vote against the 
planned maximum payout for Bruce Hemphill because of the ‘unusual nature and size’ 
of the offer. Mr Hemphill is proposing to split the dual listed Anglo-South African group 
into four separate companies by the end of 2018, making his own role as overall chief 
executive redundant. Mr Hemphill’s 2016 base salary is proposed at £900,000, which 
means he could earn £9m as part of the long-term incentive plan over the three years the 
company aims to complete the break-up.

92	
|	 4    ■    Managerial and behavioural theories of the firm
One top 20 shareholder said: ‘The pay framework proposed is unusual and large. 
A ­figure of 1,000 per cent of base salary is very generous, particularly if the company is 
split up earlier than the 2018 deadline.’ Another top 20 investor commented: ‘We need 
to look closely at the performance targets as the maximum payout is a lot. However, 
breaking up a company is a complicated thing to do and the CEO is out of a job at the 
end of it.’ Both shareholders said they were still considering whether they would support 
the proposals in a vote on June 28.
However, Leonard Kruger, portfolio manager at Allan Gray, one of Old Mutual’s 
biggest shareholders, is backing the proposal, saying he thinks it best aligns pay with 
performance. ‘It is better to have one long-term incentive, regardless of how long the 
separation takes as it provides an incentive to finish it quickly and a disincentive to stall 
the process.’ Significantly, it is a binding vote on remuneration policy, which means the 
company will be forced to reconsider the plans should more than 50 per cent of sharehold-
ers line up against them.
The maximum payout of 1,000 per cent will depend on a number of performance tar-
gets at the completion of the managed separation or in March 2020, depending on which 
comes first. The targets include performance on shareholder returns, profits and return 
on equity.

In the 1960s, several new theoretical models were developed to examine 
the contribution of managers to decision-making within the firm. The rest of 
­Section 4.3 describes the best known of the managerial theories of the firm.
Baumol (1959) suggests that the managers of a large firm are primarily inter-
ested in maximizing their organization’s sales revenue, subject to satisfying a 
minimum profit constraint. There are three reasons why the managers might pur-
sue a sales revenue maximization objective. First, sales are widely regarded as a 
good general indicator of organizational performance.
[S]urely it is a common experience that when one asks an executive, 
‘How’s business?’, he will answer that his sales have been increasing (or 
decreasing), and talk about profit only as an afterthought, if at all.
(Baumol, 1959, p. 46)
Second, executive remuneration, as well as the power, influence and status execu-
tives can command, tend to be closely linked to their organization’s sales per-
formance. Third, assuming lenders tend to rely on sales data as a reasonably 
simple and visible indicator of organizational performance, a reduction in sales 
gives cause for concern because it gives rise to difficulties in raising finance from 
capital markets. The need to satisfy a minimum profit constraint is included in 
the managers’ objective function, because sufficient profit is required to provide

On management: Losing their grip
FT
The epicentre of the seizure that has put western capitalism on life support is a crisis of 
corporate ownership. As former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan lamented, 
shareholders not only failed to restrain the vaulting ambition of the bankers in the crunch 
of 2008, even though it was in their interest, they egged them on. They have been no 
more effective in braking managerial pay. Overall, sums up Will Hutton, chairman of the 
Ownership Commission, the UK has done a poor job of stewarding its assets, harming 
the performance of the economy as a whole.
But the central plank of today’s corporate governance, that shareholders own com-
panies and should therefore dictate the behaviour of managers, was never as robust as 
presented. It can no longer bear the weight of reality, which is why attempts at reform, 
from regulating the banks to reining in executive pay, fall through.
Shareholders in UK companies are overwhelmingly foreign based or short term. Just 
30 per cent are British and in it for the long haul. Average holding periods, down to seven 
months from seven years in the 1970s, are still heading south: high-frequency trading 
accounts for 70 per cent of equity order volume in the US and 40 per cent in Europe, 
according to the Bank of England. Where ownership and interests are so divergent, 
expecting shareholders (what shareholders?) to exert control is hopeless. Ownership has 
been emptied of meaning.
In any case, theory on the subject is as rickety as the practice. According to two law 
professors writing in that fiery leftwing organ Harvard Business Review, ‘the law provides 
a surprisingly clear answer: shareholders do not own the corporation, which is an autono-
mous legal person’. As the late London Business School professor Sumantra Ghoshal 
pointed out, shareholder ownership is simply incompatible with limited liability: it’s one 
or the other, not both. Legally, directors must take account of shareholders’ interests, 
but their fiduciary duty is to the company. Shareholders own shares, which give them 
finance for future expansion, and to satisfy current shareholders and the capital 
markets. If shareholders are dissatisfied, they might vote to dismiss the managers 
at a general meeting; or they might sell their shares, causing the company’s mar-
ket valuation to fall and rendering the company vulnerable to takeover. A new 
group of owners might wish to bring in its own management team. Therefore, if 
profit falls too low, the managers’ job security is jeopardised.
In practice minimum acceptable profit is a rough attempt to provide 
completely acceptable earnings to stockholders while leaving enough 
over for investment in future expansion at the maximum rate which 
management considers to be reasonably marketable.
(Baumol, 1959, p. 53)

voting and other rights, but not ownership of the company’s assets. In short, says Charles 
Handy, the eminent UK business philosopher, shareholders no more own companies than 
a punter on the 2.30 at Epsom owns the nag he is betting on.
Shareholders should have few qualms surrendering their claim. A final accounting for 
the era of shareholder capitalism – broadly from the late 1970s to today – still awaits, but 
it is already clear the balance sheet is ugly.

Baumol’s sales revenue maximization model is illustrated in Figure 4.1. The 
analysis uses short-run cost functions and, for simplicity, it is assumed that 
the fixed cost is zero. The profit function, denoted p, is the difference between 
total revenue (TR) and total cost (TC). Therefore p = 0 at the points where 
TR = TC. Profit maximization is achieved by producing the output level q1, at 
which the vertical distance between TR and TC is maximised. In the absence of 
any effective shareholder control, the firm’s managers might attempt to maximise 
sales revenue. Sales revenue maximisation is achieved by producing the output 
level q3, at which the TR function is maximised. However, the need to satisfy 
the minimum profit constraint shown by the horizontal line pMIN, prevents the 
managers from increasing output as far as q3. Sales revenue maximisation subject 
to a profit constraint of pMIN is achieved by producing q2, the highest output 
level that is consistent with p Ú pMIN.

Needham (1978) develops a long-run or multi-period version of the same model. 
The long-run analysis is motivated by the observation that current profit is a key 
source of finance for a firm seeking to expand. And, by definition, growth is required 
for the firm to increase its sales revenue in the future. Therefore, if managers have 
long-time horizons, it is not obvious that in the short run they should produce a 
level of output greater than that which would maximise current (short-run) profit.
For a firm with a planning horizon of n years, the present value of future sales 
revenue, denoted PV, depends on current sales revenue, denoted TR0; the annual 
rate of growth of sales revenue, denoted g; and the discount rate employed to 
convert future sales revenue flows into present values, denoted r:
PV = TR0(1 + g)
1 + r
+ TR0(1 + g)2
(1 + r)2
+ g + TR0(1 + g)n
(1 + r)n
The growth rate g depends on current profit, which is used to finance future 
growth. By maximising profit in the short run, the firm also maximises g. 
However, as shown in Figure 4.1, short-run profit maximisation implies sales 
revenue is lower than it could be. By increasing output beyond its short-run 
profit-­maximising level, the firm achieves an increase in current sales revenue 
TR0 at the expense of a reduction in g. Accordingly, to maximise PV, the firm’s 
managers must decide on an optimal trade-off between current sales revenue and 
future growth in sales revenue.
The short-run profit that is required to deliver the chosen long-run growth 
rate might be interpreted as the short-run profit constraint. If so, the main differ-
ence between the short-run model and the long-run model is that, in the former, 
the profit constraint is determined exogenously (by the managers’ job security 
requirement), while in the latter it is determined by the trade-off between cur-
rent sales revenue and future growth. This in turn is determined by the short-run 
trade-off between current sales revenue and current profit.
Not all economists accept Baumol’s sales revenue maximization hypothesis. 
Peston (1959) suggests that the hypothesis might be applied to cases where firms 
are uncertain about their revenue or demand functions. In an uncertain world, 
rather than risk producing too little output, firms prefer to produce too much, 
and overproduction may at least enable the firm to realise economies of scale.
Marris’s theory of growth maximization
In view of the separation between ownership and control, Baumol (1962), Marris 
(1964) and Williamson (1963) suggest managers may wish to pursue a strategy of 
maximizing the growth of the firm. Growth maximization might be achieved at 
the expense of maximizing the present value of the firm’s future profit streams, 
reflected in the firm’s current stock market valuation.
In Marris’s model, the managers’ salaries and status depend on the size of 
their departments. Managers are judged by their peers, subordinates and supe-
riors for professional competence. Since each manager’s individual contribution 
to profit is difficult to assess, some other method of evaluation has to be deter-
mined. A manager’s ability to get on with other people and run their department 

96

smoothly is often used as a performance indicator. However, managers need to 
do more than this to increase their esteem, especially in the eyes of superiors and 
peers. Expanding the activities under their own command, and the activities of 
the firm in general, is a natural way for managers to enhance their reputation. 
By so doing, the manager also enhances his or her own job security, and that 
of subordinates. The firm naturally tends to reward those who contribute most 
toward its own growth and security.
Therefore, managers tend to strive for growth rather than profit maximiza-
tion. Successful pursuit of a growth maximization objective necessitates achiev-
ing balance between the rate of growth of demand for the firm’s products and 
the rate of growth of the firm’s capital.
In the short run, growth of demand for the firm’s existing product range 
might be achieved through measures such as price adjustments, new marketing 
campaigns, or small changes in product design. However, for any given range 
of products, there are limits to the effectiveness of such measures in increas-
ing demand; or at the very least, continued reliance on these measures may 
have damaging and unacceptable consequences for profitability. Eventually, 
further price reductions become counterproductive as the firm moves onto 
the price inelastic section of its demand function; or diminishing returns to 
further advertising or research and development expenditure are encountered. 
Therefore, in order to grow continually over the long run, the firm cannot rely 
solely on existing products: it must diversify. By adopting a strategy of diversi-
fication, the firm can overcome the inevitable constraint on growth of demand 
imposed by exclusive reliance on any one product or on a fixed product range.
However, even for a firm that is willing to exploit opportunities for diversi-
fication into new markets, there are limits to the rate of growth of demand that 
can be achieved without causing profitability to decline. This is because there are 
limits to the number of diversification opportunities the firm’s management team 
can successfully handle at any one time. If too many new projects are taken on, 
the firm’s managerial resources become too thinly spread. The decision-making 
and organizational capabilities of the firm’s management team become over-
stretched, mistakes are made, some projects fail and the firm’s capacity to pro-
duce begins to exceed the demand for its products. Consequently, profitability 
starts to decline. Attempts to overcome this problem by recruiting more manag-
ers may not succeed. It takes time for new recruits to become familiar with the 
organization’s practices and methods of operation and, in the short run, the need 
to provide training for the newcomers may make matters worse by diverting the 
attention of the firm’s existing managers. In summary, there is a managerial con-
straint on growth: if a firm attempts to grow too quickly through diversification, 
profitability will eventually tend to decline.
Firms have available three means of financing growth of capital: borrowing; 
the issue of new share capital; and the use of retained profits. However, there 
are limits to the use of all three sources, which give rise to a financial constraint 
on growth:
■ If the firm borrows too heavily, its balance sheet debit–equity ratio or gearing 
ratio (the ratio of long-term debt to share capital) increases. The level of risk 

	
	
	
4.3  Separation of ownership from control: managerial theories of the firm	 |	
97
faced by lenders and shareholders also increases: earnings may be insufficient 
to meet the interest payments on the debt, and the higher the fixed charge on 
earnings required to cover interest, the more volatile (proportionately) is the 
residual component of earnings that accrues to shareholders.
■ Issuing new share capital is effective as a means of financing expansion only 
if the financial markets are willing to invest. In order to sell new shares, 
the firm needs to be able to demonstrate an acceptable rate of current and 
future profitability.
■ Finally, growth can be financed from retained profit. However, this creates 
a dilemma for the firm’s managers, who must consider the trade-off between 
using retained profit to finance growth on the one hand, and paying dividends 
to shareholders on the other. If the shareholders believe that the new invest-
ments funded from retained profit will be profitable, they may be content to 
sacrifice dividends. But if the shareholders are dissatisfied, they may vote to 
dismiss the managers or sell their shares. In both cases the managers’ job secu-
rity is jeopardised, for the reasons discussed earlier with reference to Baumol’s 
minimum profit constraint.
As a measure of shareholder contentment, Marris suggests using the valuation 
ratio, defined as the ratio of the firm’s stock market value to the book value 
of its assets. The stock market value represents the market’s assessment and 
expectations of present and future performance, while the book value represents 
the value of assets employed by the firm. If investors are dissatisfied with the 
managers’ performance, and feel that the firm is not producing an adequate 
return on the assets it employs, the stock market value will be low relative to 
the book value of assets, and the valuation ratio will be depressed. The firm is 
vulnerable to takeover when the valuation ratio falls so low that potential bid-
ders believe they could acquire the firm’s assets and then earn a higher return, 
producing a capital gain through an increase in the share price, market value 
and valuation ratio.
Marris’s model of growth maximization is illustrated in Figure 4.2. The growth 
of demand function reflects the relationship between the firm’s chosen rate of 
growth of demand (shown along the horizontal axis) and its profitability (shown 
on the vertical axis). This function is read in an anticlockwise direction (from 
the horizontal to the vertical axis). As the rate of growth of demand is increased, 
at first profitability increases, because it is possible for the firm’s managers to 
identify and successfully exploit profitable diversification opportunities. If the 
rate of growth increases beyond a certain point, however, profitability starts to 
fall as the managerial profit constraint on growth begins to bite.
The maximum growth of capital function shows the relationship between the 
firm’s rate of profit (shown along the vertical axis) and the maximum rate at 
which the firm is able to increase its capital (shown on the horizontal axis). This 
function is read in a clockwise direction (from the vertical to the horizontal axis). 
Marris assumes there is a linear relationship between the rate of profit and the 
maximum growth rate that can be sustained. Implicitly, the retention ratio (the 
ratio of retained profit to total profit) is assumed to be constant. In accordance 
with the preceding discussion of the financial constraint on growth, the higher 

98	
|	 4    ■    Managerial and behavioural theories of the firm
the profit rate, the higher the maximum rate of growth of capital the firm can 
sustain. The feasible combinations of profit and growth open to the firm are 
represented by the shaded area between the growth of demand and maximum 
growth of capital functions. The shareholders, whose objective is profit maximi-
zation, would prefer the firm to operate at A. But the managers, whose objec-
tive is growth maximization, choose instead to operate at the highest attainable 
balanced growth rate (at which growth of demand equals growth of capital), 
located at B.
Figure 4.2 and the preceding discussion capture the essential features of the 
Marris growth maximization model. As with the Baumol sales revenue maximi-
zation model, a few refinements have been suggested, which tend to narrow the 
distinction between the profit-maximizing and growth-maximizing outcomes. 
For example, shareholders might be willing to sacrifice some current profit to 
achieve faster growth, if the growth is expected to deliver higher profits in the 
future. Similarly, managers might be willing to sacrifice some growth to achieve 
higher current profit, if this produces an increase in the firm’s valuation ratio, 
reducing the likelihood of takeover and enhancing the managers’ job security. 
In both cases there is a trade-off between current profitability and growth, sug-
gesting that an equilibrium might be established somewhere along the section of 
the growth of demand function between the polar cases of profit maximization 
at A and growth maximization at B.
The Marris model suggests a few testable hypotheses. First, owner-controlled 
firms achieve lower growth and higher profits than management-controlled firms. 
Radice (1971) finds that despite differences in average profitability between the 
two types of firm, owner-controlled firms enjoy faster growth. Second, a low 
valuation ratio increases the likelihood of the firm being taken over. Using data 
for 3,500 UK firms between 1957 and 1969, Kuehn (1975) finds evidence to sup-
port this hypothesis. However, Singh (1971) and Levine and Aaronovitch (1981) 
do not find any such evidence.

Williamson’s theory of managerial utility maximization
In Baumol’s model, the managers’ interests are tied to a single variable, namely, 
sales revenue, the growth of which the managers seek to maximise, subject to 
a minimum profit constraint. Williamson (1963) incorporates several variables 
into the managers’ objective or utility function. Managers are assumed to adopt 
expense preference behaviour, by undertaking large amounts of discretionary 
spending. This yields satisfaction or utility to the managers, which they seek 
to maximise. Effectively, expense preference behaviour implies managers divert 
some of the firm’s productive resources for their own uses.
The managerial utility function can be represented as follows:
U = f(S, M, pD)
U denotes managerial utility. S denotes expenditure on staff. It is assumed the 
manager derives utility from the prestige or power obtained by empire-building 
(increasing the number of staff who report to the manager). M denotes expendi-
ture on managerial emoluments (fringe benefits or perks), such as large offices, 
expense accounts and company cars. pD denotes discretionary profit, defined as 
net profit (after tax and expenditure on managerial emoluments) over and above 
the minimum level of profit that is required to pay an acceptable level of dividend 
to shareholders. Again, it is assumed the managers derive utility from discretion-
ary profit: the higher the value of pD, the greater the managers’ job security.
Let p denote operating profit (before expenditure on managerial emoluments), 
T denote tax, and p0 denote the shareholders’ minimum acceptable profit level:
pD = p - M - T - p0
Operating profit, p, is a function of staff expenditure, S. As the level of staff 
expenditure increases, operating profit initially increases as well. However, even-
tually diminishing returns set in, and staffing costs start to rise faster than the 
extra revenue additional staff are capable of generating. As the level of staff 
expenditure continues to increase, operating profit eventually starts to decrease:
p = p(S) 1 pD = p(S) - M - T - p0
The problem of managerial utility maximization involves selecting the values of 
S, M and pD that maximise the utility function U = f(S, M, pD), subject to the 
constraint pD = p(S) - M - T - p0. A diagrammatic representation of this 
constrained optimization problem can be obtained by assuming, for simplicity, 
M is constant, and examining the trade-off between S and pD. This is shown in 
Figure 4.3. The relationship between S and pD implied by diminishing returns 
to additional staff expenditure is represented by the inverted U-shaped function 
pD = p(S) - M - T - p0. The indifference curves U1, U2 and U3 represent 
the trade-off between pD and S that is implied by the managerial utility function.
In Figure 4.3, a profit-maximizing firm selects staff expenditure S1, and earns 
discretionary profit pD1. This produces managerial utility of U1. A managerial 

100	
|	 4    ■    Managerial and behavioural theories of the firm
firm, whose managers seek to maximise their own utility function, selects a higher 
staff expenditure S2 and earns a lower discretionary profit pD2. This produces 
higher managerial utility of U2.
Williamson concludes that a managerial firm tends to overspend on its staff in 
comparison with a profit-maximizing firm. This result demonstrates the prefer-
ence of managers for staff expenditure. If M is also made variable rather than 
fixed (as assumed in Figure 4.3), a similar conclusion emerges in respect of mana-
gerial emoluments. At the respective equilibria, M = 0 for a profit-maximizing 
firm and M 7 0 for a managerial utility-maximizing firm.
	
4.4	
The behavioural theory of the firm
The behavioural theory of the firm is most closely associated with Cyert and 
March (1964). This theory defines the firm in terms of its organizational structure 
and decision-making processes. The boundaries of the firm are defined quite 
loosely, to include all individuals or groups with influence or interests in the orga-
nization’s activities. Relevant groups include the firm’s managers, shareholders, 
employees, customers and suppliers of inputs, as well as other parties such as 
trade unions, consumer organizations, local residents (whose living environment 
may be affected by the firm’s operations), government departments (with inter-
ests in the implications of the firm’s activities for tax revenues, employment or 
the balance of payments) and so on. In more recent terminology, these interest 
groups have been referred to as stakeholders. Group definitions can be formu-
lated at several different levels; for example, the firm’s management team might 
be subdivided into its constituent parts with responsibilities for marketing, sales, 
production, stock-keeping, finance, human resources and so on, with each group 
tending to emphasise its own priorities and objectives.
Figure 4.3  Williamson’s managerial utility maximization model

	
	
	
4.4  The behavioural theory of the firm	 |	
101
The behavioural theory recognises that all decision-making takes place in an 
environment of uncertainty, or bounded rationality (Simon, 1959). No individual 
or group has complete information about every aspect of the firm’s activities and 
operating environment. But all groups and individuals have some information, 
and the information they have tends to be most complete in the immediate vicin-
ity of their own activities. Accordingly, decision-making is based on bounded 
rationality rather than global rationality. All decisions are influenced by the 
beliefs, perceptions and aspirations of the individuals and groups involved. Dif-
ferences in beliefs, perceptions and aspirations create the potential for conflict 
within the organization. Conflicts are resolved through a bargaining process 
from which corporate goals or objectives emerge. Organizations themselves 
do not have goals or objectives: corporate goals are the outcome of bargaining 
within the organization. Agreements between groups or individuals bond the 
interested parties into coalitions. Corporate goals or objectives are always subject 
to change, as aspirations change over time. Periodically, the parties compare the 
performance of the firm in the areas in which they are interested with their own 
aspirations. If performance is consistently above or below aspirations, then aspi-
ration levels may be revised, and new goals or objectives may emerge. Therefore, 
corporate goals and objectives are themselves dependent on past performance.
Corporate goals cannot be reduced to a simple formula, such as profit maxi-
mization. In an environment of complexity, imperfect information and uncer-
tainty, it is impossible to identify the precise set of actions required to maximise 
profit. Instead, the firm’s managers may settle for a satisfactory profit, following 
rule-of-thumb and decision-making conventions that depend on past experience. 
Simon (1959) used the term satisficing to refer to the idea that the firm aims for a 
satisfactory profit, instead of seeking to maximise profit. Rules-of-thumb might 
include conventions such as ‘we must spend 5 per cent of revenue on advertising’ 
or ‘we must capture 50 per cent of the market’ or ‘we must play a lead role in 
research and development’.
The resolution of conflict through bargaining between groups of stakeholders 
is achieved using side-payments. For example, managers may be keen to adopt a 
new technology, while individual employees, or the trade union that represents 
them, may be reluctant. The adoption of new technology might be achieved by 
increasing wages or bonuses. Side-payments need not necessarily be in monetary 
form. For example, it might be sufficient to allow the workforce some representa-
tion at board level. Managers can also bargain over side-payments. For example, 
more resources might be allocated to the department of a key manager who is 
threatening to leave in order to join a competitor, in an attempt to retain the 
manager within the firm.
The successful firm holds together by making side-payments that are sufficient 
to prevent essential individuals or groups from withdrawing. If the side-payments 
are insufficient, workers may go on strike, key personnel may leave, shareholders 
may sell their shareholdings, suppliers may cease to supply the firm, banks may 
refuse to grant loans, or local residents may take legal action to force the closure 
of a plant or factory. Side-payments, which exceed what is strictly necessary to 
hold the firm together, are possible when there is organizational slack. Normally, 
most parties benefit from organizational slack. For example, shareholders receive 

102	
|	 4    ■    Managerial and behavioural theories of the firm
dividends above those strictly necessary to prevent them from selling their shares; 
products are priced at a level some distance below the point at which most cus-
tomers would switch to a rival firm’s product; wages are above the level at which 
most employees would resign; and executives receive remuneration or fringe ben-
efits that are more than sufficient for their services to be retained. When the firm 
is enjoying increasing sales and profitability, organizational slack expands and 
side-payments increase. In times of falling demand and low profitability, organi-
zational slack provides a cushion, enabling cuts or economies to be made without 
prompting key parties to withdraw from the organization.
The behavioural theory of the firm recognises the complexity of organizational 
decision-making. There is no definitive behavioural theory, since the organiza-
tional structure of every firm is different. Accordingly, behavioural theory is 
strong on explanation, but weak on prediction. In an environment of complexity, 
imperfect information and uncertainty, it is unlikely that the goals or objectives 
of the organization can be reduced to simple formulae such as profit maximiza-
tion. Instead, decisions emerge from bargaining between numerous individuals 
and groups, pursuing multiple and often conflicting objectives. The emphasis 
on bargaining over side-payments and the resolution of conflict implies that the 
behavioural theory is primarily concerned with decision-making in the short 
run. Accordingly, the theory can be criticised for offering little more than broad 
generalizations as to how firms tend to develop and grow in the long run.

Summary
Chapter 4 has shown how, over the years, economists have attempted to develop 
alternatives to the neoclassical theory of the firm that may be more realistic in 
describing and explaining the essential or fundamental characteristics of firms. 
Paradoxically, it has been argued that the neoclassical theory of the firm is not 
really an analysis of the firm at all, but rather a theory of resource allocation at 
the level of the market. The neoclassical theory devotes little attention to internal 
decision-making within the firm; instead, the firm is viewed almost as a ‘black 
box’. The firm pursues its goal of profit maximization by converting inputs into 
outputs in highly mechanical fashion.
Some of the earliest challenges to the neoclassical theory of the firm were 
developed in the 1950s and 1960s, in the light of growing evidence of the increas-
ing complexity of firms, and the separation of the ownership of large corpo-
rations (in the hands of shareholders) from control (in the hands of salaried 
managers). Where previously it had been assumed that firms were run so as to 
maximise the interests of their owners, economists began to acknowledge that 
managers’ objectives may differ from those of the shareholders.
In Baumol’s theory of sales revenue maximization, managers are assumed to 
maximise the size of the firm measured by its sales revenue, since managers’ com-
pensation and prestige are assumed to depend more on firm size than on profitabil-
ity. Profit cannot be ignored altogether, however, because the managers’ job security 
depends upon their ability to earn a satisfactory rate of return for the firm’s share-
holders. Marris develops a more dynamic model of long-run growth maximization,

all individuals or groups with influence or interests in the organization’s activi-
ties. Decision-making takes place in an environment of uncertainty or bounded 
rationality, as individuals and groups bargain in an attempt to secure rewards 
that meet their own aspirations. The resolution of conflict is facilitated by the 
existence of organizational slack which, in normal conditions, allows parties to 
receive rewards over and above the level necessary to prevent them from with-
drawing their participation and support from the organization.

Introduction
Over time, increasing awareness of the limitations of both the neoclassical theory 
of the firm that is described in Chapter 3, and the managerial and behavioural 
alternatives that are described in Chapter 4, have motivated further efforts to 
develop yet more realistic economic and organizational theories of the firm. 
These approaches are examined in Chapter 5.

5.2  The Coasian firm	 |	
105
An early paper by Coase (1937) provides a natural point of departure for the 
transaction costs approach to the theory of the firm, described in Sections 5.2 
and 5.3. Coase questions why centrally planned institutions called ‘firms’ exist 
in market-based economies. Coase’s answer is that by implementing certain 
transactions or taking certain resource allocation decisions consciously (within 
the domain of the firm) rather than unconsciously (through the medium of the 
market), a saving in transaction costs can be realised. Transaction costs can be 
defined loosely as costs incurred when using market mechanisms to allocate 
resources in a world of imperfect information. The firm is viewed as an institution 
which economises on transaction costs, or the costs of processing information. 
Resources are allocated in response to the firm’s interpretation of information 
flows. The firm organises governance structures that provide protection from the 
threat of opportunistic behaviour made possible by informational asymmetries.
Coase’s insights have also influenced a number of approaches to the theory 
of the firm based on agency theory, which are reviewed in Section 5.4. Echoing 
the earlier managerial approach, agency theory emphasises the conflicts that 
can arise between principals (owners or shareholders) and agents (managers). 
Under conditions of incomplete contracts and uncertainty, opportunities may 
arise for agents to act against the best interests of principals, unless the incentive 
structures confronting principals and agents are properly aligned. In the prop-
erty rights approach, reviewed in Section 5.5, a key distinction is drawn between 
specific rights defined explicitly in the terms of contracts, and residual rights 
which accrue to the owner once all specific rights have been assigned. In a world 
of incomplete contracts, the ownership of the residual rights is of paramount 
importance. The ownership of residual rights gives control over access to physical 
assets, or less tangible assets such as brands or reputation.
Dissatisfaction within the fields of management science and strategic manage-
ment with both the neoclassical theory of the firm and its more modern alter-
natives has led to the development of resource-based theories of the firm. This 
approach, which characterises the firm in terms of the resources or knowledge 
it embodies and commands, is examined in Section 5.6. Resources include both 
physical inputs and intangible resources such as technical expertise, knowledge 
and organizational structure. A number of insights are borrowed from the trans-
action costs literature, relating to the boundaries of the firm and decision making 
under bounded rationality. Some writers emphasise knowledge as perhaps the 
most important of a firm’s intangible resources. Firms exist in order to coordi-
nate and protect the unique knowledge that is the firm’s key strategic asset.
	
5.2	
The Coasian firm
Although the transaction costs approach to the theory of the firm has developed 
mainly since the 1970s, a natural starting point is the much earlier paper by Coase 
(1937). Coase observes that in a market economy, many resource allocation deci-
sions are taken unconsciously, through the operation of the price mechanism. 
Resources tend to flow to wherever they command the highest price. Excluding 

106

the possibility of market imperfections, if the price of a factor of production is 
higher in industry X than in industry Y, the factor moves from Y towards X, 
until the price differential disappears. However, there is another large class of 
resource allocation decisions that are not decided in this manner. For resource 
allocation decisions that are taken internally within firms, the price mechanism 
is suspended. When workers move from one department to another, for example, 
they do so not because there has been a price signal, but because they have been 
told to do so. Within the firm, something similar to centralised economic plan-
ning is observed: the conscious coordination of the firm’s resources by the entre-
preneur or manager. Accordingly, Robertson likens the position of firms within 
markets to ‘islands of conscious power in this ocean of unconscious cooperation’ 
(Robertson, 1930, p. 85).
Why do these ‘islands’ of conscious power exist? In other words, why should 
the task of coordination or resource allocation be assigned to the market in some 
cases, and to the firm in other cases? Coase points out that transaction costs are 
incurred when using markets to allocate resources. Transaction costs include 
the following:
■ the search costs associated with gathering information about relative prices;
■ the costs incurred in negotiating the contract that specifies the terms of the 
transaction; and
■ costs that are created artificially by the government, through the levy of sales 
taxes or the imposition of quotas.
Coase’s explanation as to why some transactions are removed from the 
domain of the market, and are instead decided consciously within firms, is that 
this method of coordination creates a saving in transaction costs:
■ It is not necessary for a factor of production to search for a price signal in order 
to transfer from one department to another within the firm. The transfer is 
decided consciously by the entrepreneur or manager.
■ The costs associated with negotiating contracts with suppliers of factors of 
production may be greatly reduced. For example, instead of hiring labour on 
a daily basis in a spot market, the firm can hire workers on long-term employ-
ment contracts. The precise details of the worker’s contractual obligations 
over the entire duration of the contract are not specified; instead, the employee 
is expected to comply (within certain limits) with instructions issued by the 
entrepreneur or manager. The contract needs to specify only the limits to the 
obligations of the contracting parties.
■ Sales tax liabilities or other restrictions on economic activity imposed by the 
government may be circumvented if transactions take place internally within 
the organization, rather than externally through the market.
According to the Coasian analysis, a firm expands when additional transac-
tions are removed from the sphere of the market and are decided instead within 
the boundaries of the firm. A firm declines when it ceases to organise some trans-
actions, which are returned to the sphere of the market. Naturally, a critical ques-
tion is: what determines the boundaries that separate the firm from the market?

Case study 5.1
The hobbit approach to the sharing economy
FT
If only the hobbits of the Shire, in JRR Tolkien’s Middle-earth, had invented the inter-
net. Surely if Frodo Baggins and friends had been online, some hairy-footed entrepre-
neur would have launched mathom.com as a platform to circulate more efficiently the 
unwanted presents, or mathoms, stashed in hobbit holes for regifting on another occasion.
The Christmas experience, with that sinking of the heart on unwrapping a second box 
set of Parks and Recreation, always brings to mind this hobbit tradition of the polite 
circulation of unwanted gifts. Many people salt away, with mild guilt, the soaps or socks 
they find under the tree to give to someone else another time. An online exchange to cir-
culate presents from where they are not wanted to where they are would, without doubt, 
If the removal of transactions from the market and their incorporation within 
the firm reduces or eliminates transaction costs, why does the market survive 
at all as a medium for coordination or resource allocation? Why is there not 
just one very large firm? Fundamentally, the answer is that there are also costs 
associated with the supply of the entrepreneurial or organizing function. The 
entrepreneur may be more skilled in organizing some types of transaction than 
others, and for some transactions it may be better to rely on the market and bear 
the associated transaction costs. Furthermore, the marginal cost of incorporating 
additional transactions within the firm increases as the number of transactions 
already incorporated increases. Due to diminishing returns to the entrepreneurial 
or organizing function, a point is reached at which it would be counter-produc-
tive to extend the boundaries of the firm any further. Case Study  5.1 discusses 
the policy of outsourcing: using the market to supply essential resources, rather 
than producing them internally.
Cowling and Sugden (1998) challenge the Coasian view that the analysis of 
the firm should rest exclusively on identifying the boundaries between market 
and non-market transactions. Coase (1991) himself draws attention to the fact 
that within some large organizations, internal markets or quasi-markets are cre-
ated deliberately in order to settle certain resource allocation decisions, and to 
introduce an element of competitive pressure or discipline. Coase suggests that, 
in such cases, the firm’s competing departments might be viewed as if they were 
effectively separate firms. However, Cowling and Sugden argue that the market 
versus non-market (or some intermediate combination) characterization of trans-
actions and resource allocation decisions is largely a superficial construct. The 
analysis of the firm should concentrate on the nature of the productive activity 
itself, rather than the method of coordinating this activity. Nevertheless, Coase’s 
interpretation of firms as ‘islands of conscious planning’ is highly insightful, 
especially in view of the modern emphasis on strategic decision-making within 
the firm (see Section 5.4).

increase consumer welfare. Users could also save money by sending in presents they have 
received (a scarf that will never be worn) and selecting others more suited to their intended 
recipients (a photo frame for grandma’s birthday).
In short, mathom.com is an exemplary sharing-economy platform. The term describes 
many different kinds of business, from hobbit-worthy community exchanges to profit-
seeking global businesses such as Uber. The thing they have in common is matching 
supply and demand more efficiently, using technology to reduce the transaction costs 
involved in acquiring goods or services from the people able to provide them.
Ronald Coase, the economics Nobel laureate, explained in a 1937 article that the lower 
the transaction costs, the more likely exchanges are to occur in a more open “market-
place” than within a “firm”. The sharing economy is Coasean economics brought to 
life: lower search costs mean more transactions are likely to occur in a marketplace, and 
markets will reach areas where they were not feasible before.
Such platforms fall into two categories: community-focused and monetary mar-
ketplaces. Critics of the latter object that there is no “sharing”, just selling — also 
known as old-fashioned capitalism. Some argue that such businesses even get away 
with exploitation disguised in hippy clothing; hence the debate about the implications 
of the “gig economy”.
The strength of feeling in this debate is perhaps related to some early non-monetary 
uses of matching platforms. Two other economists, Al Roth and Lloyd Shapley, shared a 
Nobel Prize for their work in the area of “market design”. This paved the way for online 
platforms and the algorithms they use to match suppliers and consumers.
Prof Roth put his work into practice by devising ways to use the processes of a market 
without prices or money. The best known example is the kidney exchange that matches 
donors and recipients, increasing the number of feasible life-saving operations. Another 
is the matching of young doctors to their first residency, taking into account the pref-
erences of hospitals for the most able applicants they can attract and applicants for 
the best locations they can aspire to. We do not want people buying kidneys or jobs 
since we believe financial incentives would have undesirable effects; Prof Roth described 
such cases as “repugnant markets”. Nevertheless, the efficiency gains from a matching 
exchange can be large.
Economics has always insisted that markets are the best means to allocate resources 
because they effectively co-ordinate information about consumer preferences and infor-
mation about the costs of supply. Matching platforms take advantage of faster, cheaper 
information to make markets work even better. This does not mean they will always 
work well. Markets need to sit in a framework of law, competition policy and employ-
ment and consumer regulation to balance individual incentives and collective outcomes. 
Although it extends the scope of markets, the for-profit sharing economy is not unique 
in any way other than increasing economic efficiency, with the potential for everyone 
to share the benefits.

Transaction costs and the theory of the firm
Coase’s ideas regarding the nature of the firm spawned a number of further 
contributions to the theory of the firm, which can be grouped under the heading 
of transaction costs economics. Some of the key ideas are advanced by Cheung 
(1983), Klein et al. (1978) and most notably Williamson (1975, 1985). Coase’s 
original emphasis was on transaction costs incurred before contracts are con-
cluded. These include costs associated with searching for information and nego-
tiating contracts. In contrast, the later transaction costs literature focuses on 
costs incurred after contracts are concluded. These costs arise from difficulties 
in monitoring and enforcing compliance, and punishing non-compliance. This 
section focuses on Williamson’s approach.
Agency theory (see also Section 5.4) examines the principal–agent problem, 
which is central to the transaction costs approach to the theory of the firm. The 
principal–agent problem refers to the difficulties that arise when a principal hires 
an agent, due to imperfect information. The principal–agent problem affects 
most employer–employee contracts, including the relationship between a firm’s 
shareholders (principal) and its managers (agent), and the relationship between 
the firm as employer (principal) and its employees or workers (agent).
Most contracts between a principal and an agent are incomplete contracts, in 
the sense that the parties to the contract cannot identify in advance every contin-
gency that might affect their contractual relationship. There is bounded rational-
ity, rather than global rationality. The parties to a contract may find it impossible 
to foresee all events that could possibly occur in an uncertain world. Even if the 
range of possible future events can be foreseen, the parties may disagree over 
the probabilities that should be assigned to different events. And even if events 
can be foreseen and probabilities assigned, this information may be difficult to 
translate into a meaningful and enforceable contract. Such a contract would have 
to be exhaustively specified, so as to eliminate all possible ambiguities that could 
otherwise give rise to expensive litigation.
Contracts that have already been agreed can give rise to unforeseen conse-
quences. The parties may incur renegotiation or switching costs if alternative 
partners or production technologies are discovered. An important issue, which 
may create a need for the renegotiation of contracts, is asset specificity. A con-
tract between two parties may involve the creation of an asset that is specific to 
that relationship, and which has little or no value outside that relationship. This 
gives rise to the creation of a quasi-rent (Klein et al., 1978), reflecting the differ-
ence between the asset’s value in its present use and its value in its next best use 
(or its salvage value). After the contract has been concluded, the parties can act 
opportunistically by asking to renegotiate the incomplete contract, in an effort 
to appropriate the quasi-rent.
For example, a principal–agent relationship might involve extensive sunk cost 
investment in the agent’s human capital by both parties, with neither party able 
to recoup the sunk costs if the relationship breaks down. This situation can 
arise if the principal incurs substantial training costs, and the agent also invests 
effort in the acquisition of skills that are specific to this particular relationship. 

110	
|	 5    ■    Transaction costs, agency and resource-based theories of the firm
Once the specific human capital embodied in the agent has accumulated, on 
each occasion the contract is renegotiated both parties have an incentive to seek 
to appropriate a larger share of the return that the principal–agent relationship 
generates. In a spot market for agents’ services, recontracting might take place 
on a daily or weekly basis. In each renegotiation, the agent can threaten non-
renewal, causing the principal to incur the training costs all over again with a 
new agent. But, equally, the principal can threaten non-renewal, forcing the agent 
to sell his services to a new principal with whom the agent’s productivity, and 
therefore his remuneration, might be much lower. As each party issues threats 
and counter-threats, the costs of renegotiating tend to become prohibitively high. 
If either party can foresee the possibility that the other party might behave in this 
manner, the party with foresight might be reluctant to enter into such a relation-
ship in the first place.
The alternative is for the contract between the principal and agent to be inte-
grated or internalised within the sphere of a firm. As discussed by Coase, the 
employee becomes bound by a long-term employment contract, which does not 
specify every detail of both parties’ obligations over the entire duration of the 
contract, but which does impose some limits on permissible behaviour. The need 
for recontracting on a daily or weekly basis is eliminated, and the scope for 
opportunistic behaviour in an attempt to appropriate quasi-rents is reduced but 
perhaps not eliminated altogether: threatened strike action or resignation by 
employees, or threatened dismissal of employees by the employer, are still pow-
erful bargaining instruments once the sunk cost investment in specific human 
capital has been incurred by both parties. The internalization of market transac-
tions proceeds up to the point where the marginal governance cost associated 
with running the transaction internally (within the firm) equals the marginal 
transaction cost associated with contracting (via the market).
Although the internalization of transactions is a common remedy according 
to much of the transaction costs literature, there are some exceptions. Milgrom 
and Roberts (1988) suggest that under some conditions a series of short-term 
contracts may be preferable to the internalization of transactions, especially in 
situations where market conditions and production technologies are subject to 
change. The empirical transaction costs literature is surveyed by Shelanski and 
Klein (1995) and Boerner and Macher (2001). Some of this literature explores 
the relationship between the degree of asset specificity within firms and gover-
nance structures, vertical integration and the types and duration of contracts. In 
a study of subcontracting in the UK engineering industry, for example, Lyons 
(1996) finds that the degree of asset specificity influences not only the duration of 
contracts, but also the decision whether a firm should subcontract or not. Where 
firms are more vulnerable to opportunistic behaviour on the part of subcontrac-
tors, formal contracts are more likely to be adopted in preference to flexible and 
informal agreements.
The transaction costs approach has been used to explore the question of the 
most effective organizational structure. Figure 5.1 illustrates the unitary or 
U-form organizational structure, in which the firm’s key activities are subdivided 
into functional areas, such as marketing, finance, production, personnel and so

on. Each department is run by a middle manager, who reports to the firm’s chief 
executive. An advantage of the U-form is that by specializing, the departmental 
managers develop functional expertise, allowing the clustering of particular skills 
or talents within departments. This is particularly useful when a firm produces 
a single product. Consequently, this organizational structure is common among 
small and medium-sized firms. The U-form is less suited to large organizations 
that supply a diversified range of goods and services because, in this case, each 
department has to deal with a more diverse range of tasks and functions. Effec-
tive coordination of resource allocation decisions and the transmission of infor-
mation between departments become more difficult as the organization increases 
in size, and transaction costs increase. The departmental managers’ workloads 
become more demanding, and conflict between departments tends to increase.
Figure 5.2 illustrates the multidivisional or M-form organizational structure, 
in which the firm is divided into a number of quasi-independent operating divi-
sions. The M-form was first developed in the US in the 1920s and 1930s, as the 
scale and scope of large firms such as General Motors grew to such an extent 
that management structures based on the U-form became overloaded and unable 
to operate effectively (Chandler, 1977). Within an M-form organizational struc-
ture, the operating divisions can be organised geographically (within regional,

national or international boundaries), or by product type. Each division is a 
quasi-firm, comprising all of the key functional areas required to deliver the 
product or service. Divisional managers exercise considerable decision-making 
autonomy. The head office is responsible for the longer-term strategic direction 
of the organization, and plays a supervisory role with respect to the activities of 
the divisions: the head office monitors performance, allocates finance and sets 
the parameters within which the divisional managers are permitted to operate.
A closely related variant is the holding company or H-form organizational 
structure, in which a holding or parent company has a significant ownership 
stake (normally a controlling interest) in other companies or subsidiaries. Again, 
the managers of the subsidiaries may be granted considerable decision-making 
autonomy with respect to operational matters. The H-form is especially common 
among multinational companies.
Synthesizing a number of insights drawn from his earlier work, Williamson 
(2002) proposes a theory of the firm as governance structure. The orthodox 
approach to economics, popularised by Robbins (1932), can be interpreted as 
the science of choice on the part of rational utility or profit-maximizing agents. 
However, this approach is not the only source of insight into economic relation-
ships: there is also the science of contract. Figure 5.3 shows schematically this 
division between the two sciences. The science of contract branch subdivides 
into: public ordering, covering collective action to secure goods and services 
which the market fails to deliver; and private ordering, covering issues associ-
ated with the alignment of incentives and governance. The alignment of incen-
tives is addressed by agency theory and the economics of property rights (see 
Sections 5.4 and 5.5). Governance addresses the ways in which organizations can 
best manage their contractual relationships. Williamson draws the following 
lessons from organization theory:
■ Bounded rationality is a fact of organizational life, and complex contracts 
are always incomplete. Parties to a contract have to be ready to adapt to

unexpected events, not only because of their lack of information or foresight, 
but also because of the potential for opportunistic behaviour that may take 
place due to unanticipated events. The potential for breakdown in contractual 
relationships encourages the organization to search for the most appropriate 
governance structures.
■ Governance structures should be designed in the light of all possible outcomes 
or significant behavioural regularities, both intended and unintended.
■ The most pertinent unit of analysis in the firm is the transaction. The three 
essential characteristics of transactions which affect the nature of governance 
are: first, the degree of asset specificity; second, the potential disturbances to 
which the transaction may be subject; and, third, the frequency with which the 
transaction recurs.
■ Organizational structures are adaptable in the light of changing conditions. 
With market transactions, agents modify their behaviour in response to price 
signals. In contrast, organizations rely on skilled or specialised managers to 
take decisions as to how the organizational structure should adapt and evolve.
	
5.4	
Agency theory
Agency theory is the body of theory that analyzes the conflicts that may arise 
between principals and agents (see also Section 5.3). The relevance of agency 
theory to the understanding of the modern firm or corporation derives partly 
from the separation of ownership from control in modern corporations (see 
­Section 4.3), and the observation that managers as agents may not always act 
in the best interests of shareholders as principals (Jensen and Meckling, 1976).
Adverse selection and moral hazard
With reference to conditions of incomplete contracts and uncertainty, adverse 
selection and moral hazard are two of the key issues that are addressed by agency 
theory. The possibility of adverse selection arises when a principal is unable to 
verify an agent’s claims concerning the agent’s own ability or productivity. There 
is moral hazard when the possibility exists for the agent to act opportunistically in 
the agent’s own private interests, but against the principal’s interests as stipulated 
in the contract that binds the agent to the principal.
The terms adverse selection and moral hazard both originate in the insurance 
industry. Suppose an insurer wishes to sell health insurance policies to individu-
als, some of whom are at high risk of sickness while some are at low risk. Suppose 
the insurer cannot easily distinguish between high-risk and low-risk applicants 
when the policy is taken out, and therefore decides to charge a premium based on 
the average sickness rate. This practice is likely to be disastrous for the company, 
because low-risk applicants will realise it is not worthwhile for them to take out 
insurance (priced at an average rate that is higher than their own sickness rate). 
In contrast, high-risk applicants will realise that insurance priced at the average 
rate (below their own sickness rate) is a bargain, and will buy a lot of insurance. 

114	
|	 5    ■    Transaction costs, agency and resource-based theories of the firm
The company suffers an adverse selection effect, because it finishes up with a 
loss-making portfolio of high-risk policyholders.
The term moral hazard refers to the tendency for policyholders to become less 
careful about protecting an interest once it has been insured. If one’s house is 
insured against burglary, when leaving the house one might not bother to lock 
the doors and windows. If one’s car is insured against theft and vandalism, one 
might not worry about parking in an unsafe part of town. Once insured, the 
policyholder has little incentive to act in the best interests of the insurer, since it is 
the insurer who pays the price for the policyholder’s carelessness or recklessness.
The implication for the theory of the firm is that a fixed wage contract may not 
be the best way of organizing the relationship between a principal and an agent. At 
the point of hiring, a fixed wage offer may result in the principal hiring a group of 
agents whose actual productivity is lower than the remuneration on offer, because 
high-productivity agents are unwilling to work for less than their actual productiv-
ity (an adverse selection problem). Having been hired, an agent may lack sufficient 
incentive to work to the full limit of their capabilities, since the remuneration is the 
same regardless of the intensity of effort (a moral hazard problem).
A remuneration structure that is performance-related might offer a solution to 
both types of problem. Establishing a link between effort and reward reduces or 
eliminates adverse selection if agents know at the point of hiring that they will be 
rewarded in proportion to their productivity. The same link reduces or eliminates 
moral hazard if agents know they will pay a price for shirking, in the form of lower 
remuneration. However, a number of problems still remain. Difficulties involved in 
monitoring individual contributions to team performance may prevent the design 
of a remuneration structure that fully reflects individual ability and effort. Further-
more, principals and agents may have different attitudes concerning the trade-off 
between risk and return. In pursuit of a higher short-run return, managers (agents) 
may impose higher risks on shareholders (principals) than the latter would prefer. 
For example, part of the managers’ remuneration package might take the form of 
stock options, allowing the holder the right to buy equity in the company for a set 
price at a future date. Options provide an incentive for managers to act in a way 
that increases the firm’s market value, helping to align the agent’s incentives with 
the principal’s interests. However, in order to maximise the value of their options, 
managers might be tempted to pursue exceptionally risky ventures in the short run, 
to the possible detriment of the firm’s long-run profitability and stability.
The firm as team-based production
The development of theories of the firm focusing on contractual relationships 
between the parties who comprise the organization can be traced back to Alchian 
and Demsetz (1972). Two important issues are addressed. First, why should the 
gains from specialization and the coordination of activities be greater if activi-
ties are organised within the firm rather than through the market? Second, how 
can the internal organisational structure of the firm be explained? Alchian and 
Demsetz challenge the Coasian notion that firms possess the ability to resolve 
coordination issues by diktat. An employer has no more power over an employee 
than a customer has over their shopkeeper. All the employer can do is assign 

	
	
	
5.4  Agency theory	 |	
115
various tasks to the employee on terms that are acceptable to both parties. As in 
the case of the shopkeeper and the customer, there is no contractual requirement 
for the employer and the employee to maintain their relationship permanently. 
The contract between the parties is renegotiated continually, and can be termi-
nated by either party at any time.
However, the employer–employee relationship within the firm is different from 
the shopkeeper–customer relationship in one crucial aspect. The firm is charac-
terised by teamwork, which requires coordination and cooperation between large 
numbers of suppliers of inputs. A central contracting agent, employer or owner 
carries out this essential coordinating function. To ensure the various inputs 
are combined effectively, it must be possible for the coordinator to measure 
and monitor the contribution made by each input, and reward each supplier 
appropriately. This is known as the metering problem. In many cases, metering 
works effectively through the medium of decentralised, competitive markets. 
A consumer who wishes to buy apples can easily establish which supermarket, 
grocer or fruit seller offers the best deal. For some transactions, however, effec-
tive metering may be more difficult to achieve. When hiring a plumber, it is 
not always straightforward to establish whether the work has been completed 
properly or whether the price being charged is fair. In cases where the metering 
of productivity and rewards is weak, effective coordination through the medium 
of markets may be more difficult to achieve, since one or more of the parties 
may lack the necessary incentives to comply with their contractual obligations.
With respect to the metering problem, team production poses a number of 
challenges for the firm. Technically, team production within the domain of the 
firm may be more efficient than contracting between independent suppliers. With 
team production, however, it may be difficult to measure accurately each team 
member’s individual contribution to the firm’s total output. If individuals are 
self-employed, any increase in productivity is rewarded directly by an increase in 
the relevant factor payment. For a team of n members among whom the rewards 
are divided equally, any increase in effort produces a reward to the individual of 
only 1/n times the extra effort. Consequently, there is temptation for individual 
members of a team to shirk or freeride. Shirking by team members is dealt with 
by the central contracting agent, employer or owner, who monitors performance 
and disciplines non-performing team members. The employer’s incentive to carry 
out the monitoring function effectively is provided by his or her claim on the 
organization’s residual return. Essentially, the Alchian and Demsetz argument is 
as follows. If the total output that can be achieved by organizing team production 
within a firm exceeds the output that can be produced by contracting between 
independent suppliers through the market, and if the additional output exceeds 
the costs of monitoring the team members’ individual efforts, team production 
within the firm supersedes production coordinated through market mechanisms.
The firm as a nexus of contracts
Jensen and Meckling (1976) argue that Alchian and Demsetz’s emphasis on team 
production and monitoring is too narrow, and perhaps even misleading. Instead, 
the essence of the firm is the entire set of contractual relationships which bind 

116	
|	 5    ■    Transaction costs, agency and resource-based theories of the firm
together the firm’s owners, employees, material suppliers, creditors, customers 
and other parties with contractual involvement in the firm’s activities. The con-
tractual relationships that bind the parties together raise the issues of agency, 
incentives and monitoring discussed by Alchian and Demsetz. Therefore, the 
firm encompasses a much wider set of relationships than those defined purely 
in terms of team production. Jensen and Meckling claim most firms are simply 
legal fictions, which possess an artificial identity created by law, and serve as a 
nexus (or link) for the contractual relationships between the individual parties. 
This wider definition of the firm encompasses non-profit, mutual and public 
sector organizations.
Jensen and Meckling seek to understand why different sets of contractual 
relationships develop for different firms, and how these relationships change in 
response to exogenous changes to the firm’s external environment. This approach 
makes redundant the attempt to distinguish between contractual relationships 
within the firm on the one hand, and those within the market on the other. 
Viewing the firm simply as a nexus of contractual relationships renders the per-
sonification of the firm analytically misleading. The firm is not like an individual 
that pursues its own distinct set of objectives. Rather, the firm acts like a clearing 
house for the multitude of (often conflicting) objectives pursued by the parties 
linked together by the nexus of contracts.
	
5.5	
Property rights and the theory of the firm
Transactions can be viewed as an exchange of rights over various assets such 
as labour, capital and the use of land. The rights that are exchanged may 
include the right to use, modify, transfer or extract an income from the asset 
concerned. Transactions are normally effected through contractual agree-
ments. A distinction is drawn between specific rights defined explicitly in the 
terms of a contract, and residual rights that accrue to the owner once all spe-
cific rights have been assigned. The property rights approach to the theory 
of the firm is based on this distinction (Hart and Moore, 1990; Hart, 1995a). 
In a world of incomplete contracts, where there is insufficient information or 
foresight to define a complete contract covering all specific rights, the owner-
ship of the residual rights is of paramount importance. The owner of the asset 
has the final or default control over the asset, and the right to dispose of a 
good or asset as they see fit.
In contrast to the Alchian and Demsetz (1972) approach, which suggests firms 
have relatively little control over their employees, the property rights approach 
emphasises the control that is vested in the firm as holder of the residual rights. 
In cases where an asset such as a group of skilled employees are in their most 
valued use in an organization, they may be willing to follow orders or directions, 
since the firm, as owner of the residual rights, can appropriate their quasi-rent or 
even deny them access to the firm’s physical assets by dismissing them. It is the 
ownership of the residual rights that gives the firm control over access to physical 
assets, or less tangible assets such as brands or reputation.

	
	
	
5.6  The resource-based theory of the firm	 |	
117
Suppose two firms, a textbook publisher A and a printing firm B, have a 
long-term contractual agreement. An unforeseen change to the terms of the 
original contract is now required: A wishes to switch from two-colour to four-
colour ink production. If both firms hold the property rights to their own 
assets, and both have sufficient leverage to damage the other party, it is likely 
that a mutually acceptable renegotiated contract can be agreed, enabling B 
to obtain a higher price for its printing services and A to sell more books. 
However, ownership of the residual rights affects the rewards accruing to the 
two parties, which may in turn affect the willingness of the parties to commit 
themselves to specific investments. Firm A may be reluctant to invest in the 
expensive, specialised software required for the new printing process, as this 
investment will increase B’s bargaining power over A in future contract nego-
tiations. However, if A and B are fully integrated, the change to four-colour ink 
production is organised by the owner of the integrated firm, who instructs the 
manager of the print division to implement the change. The integrated firm has 
to neither negotiate a new contract, nor increase the manager’s remuneration. 
Furthermore, in the integrated firm the owner has no fear that the benefits of 
the specific investment will be diluted by opportunistic behaviour. Therefore, 
integrated ownership may encourage specific investment (Grossman and Hart, 
1986; Bolton and Scharfstein, 1998).
	
5.6	
The resource-based theory of the firm
As shown earlier (see Section 3.2), critics have suggested that the neoclassical 
theory of the firm is not really an analysis of the firm as such, but rather a theory 
of resource allocation in the market. The neoclassical theory pays little attention 
to internal decision-making within the firm. The firm is like ‘a black box oper-
ated so as to meet the relevant marginal conditions with respect to inputs and 
outputs, thereby maximizing profits, or more accurately, present value’ (Jensen 
and Meckling, 1976, p. 307). In contrast, Sections 5.2 to 5.4 of this chapter have 
described the transaction cost and agency theory approaches, which view the firm 
as an institution that minimises or economises on transaction costs, or the costs 
of processing information. Resources are allocated in response to the firm’s inter-
pretation of information flows. The firm organises governance structures that 
create incentives and protect the organisation from the threat of opportunistic 
behaviour arising from informational asymmetries.
However, dissatisfaction with the neoclassical approach and the transaction 
cost and agency approaches has led researchers in the field of management sci-
ence and organization theory to develop alternative theories of the firm which 
emphasise the strategic choices facing the firm’s decision-makers. The firm is 
characterised primarily in terms of the resources or knowledge it embodies or 
commands. ‘It appears obvious that the study of business strategy must rest on 
the bedrock foundations of the economists’ model of the firm . . . [the] economic 
concepts [of Coase and Williamson] can model and describe strategic phenom-
ena’ (Rumelt, 1984, p. 557). Therefore development of a completely new body of 
theory is not required. The resource-based theory is best seen as a complement 

118	
|	 5    ■    Transaction costs, agency and resource-based theories of the firm
rather than as a substitute for the economic theories of the firm, adding further 
detail and texture to an understanding of the modern organization (Penrose, 
1959; Wernerfelt, 1984; Phelan and Lewis, 2000).
The resource-based view of the firm extends further than the technological 
relationship between physical inputs and outputs embodied in the neoclassical 
production function. For example, Grant (1991) distinguishes between tan-
gible and intangible resources, and Barney (1991) distinguishes between physi-
cal capital, human capital and organizational capital resources. Miller and 
Shamsie (1996) argue that each firm’s uniqueness derives from the resources 
it controls, which are unavailable to other firms. More generally, resources 
are either property based or knowledge based. Property-based resources are 
legally defined property rights held by the firm, such as the right to use labour, 
finance, raw material inputs and new knowledge. Other firms are unable to 
appropriate these rights unless they obtain the owner’s permission. Property-
based resources are protected by contracts, patents or deeds of ownership. 
In contrast, knowledge-based resources such as technical expertise or good 
relationships with trade unions are not protected by law, but they may still be 
difficult for other firms to access.
‘A firm’s competitive position is defined by a bundle of unique resources and 
relationships’ (Rumelt, 1984, p. 557). These resources and relationships gener-
ate rents, and the more unique a resource, the more valuable it is to the firm. 
In a competitive market, rents arise because the initial owner and the firm have 
different expectations as to the value of the resource. To the owner, the value of 
a resource is its opportunity cost, or its value in its next best use. To the firm, 
however, value is added by combining and coordinating the resource with other 
firm-specific resources. The fact that the firm can use the resource in ways the 
owner cannot envisage creates a differential between the initial owner’s valuation 
and the firm’s valuation of the resource.
The term ‘capability’ defines the specific, unique outcomes when a set of 
resources are combined and coordinated in complex ways. Foss and Eriksen 
(1995) and Langlois and Foss (1997) suggest that resources can be distinguished 
from capabilities in two ways. Resources are tradeable and uniquely tied to 
individuals within the organization. Capabilities are not tradeable, and are not 
necessarily embodied in any particular individual. Capabilities might include 
a good track-record in research and development, a reputation for using only 
high-quality inputs, a reputation for good customer service, or other aspects 
of the firm’s culture and traditions. Through continued use, these capabilities 
become stronger, more profitable and more difficult for competitors to imitate. 
The firm acts as a repository for the skills, knowledge and experience that have 
accumulated over time.
Conner and Prahalad (1996), Grant (1996), Kogut and Zander (1992) and 
Liebeskind (1996) elaborate on the idea that firms apply knowledge to the pro-
duction of goods and services, and that knowledge is strategically the most 
important of a firm’s resources. An important distinction is drawn between tacit 
and explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge cannot be conveyed sufficiently quickly 
to be appropriated immediately by the learner. For example, learning to ride 
a bicycle involves observation and practice, and cannot be done immediately 

	
	
	
5.6  The resource-based theory of the firm	 |

simply by reading a manual. Tacit knowledge is held by individuals and not by 
the organization as such (Grant, 1996). To be useful, this knowledge must be 
coordinated. The firm exists because its management is better able to perform 
this coordinating function than the market.
Explicit knowledge, in contrast, is easily absorbed, and can be transferred to 
various uses immediately. A trade secret might be regarded as explicit knowledge: 
as soon as the secret is revealed, anyone can make use of the relevant knowledge. 
Liebeskind (1996) suggests that firms exist in order to protect explicit knowl-
edge. Employment contracts may specify exclusivity and confidentiality clauses, 
preventing the transfer of economically advantageous knowledge to rival orga-
nizations. Firms can protect their explicit knowledge by threats of dismissal of 
staff who pass on information, making their departure costly through the loss 
of bonuses, pensions, stock options and promotion opportunities. The firm may 
try to ensure that its staff have access to no more information than is strictly 
necessary for them to perform their functions.
As suggested above, the boundaries of the firm can be defined by the ownership 
of resources. The boundaries of the firm define which activities or transactions 
are organised within firms, which are organised by intermediate organisations 
such as joint ventures, and which remain within the sphere of the market. Strate-
gies of vertical or horizontal integration, franchising, forming strategic alliances 
and so on, all involve redefining the boundaries of the firm.
Due to the indivisibility of certain inputs, the firm may find itself with spare 
capacity, which offers the potential for the development of new activities. How-
ever, growth is constrained by the limits to the ability of managers to conceive 
and control movements into new products and markets. In other words, there 
are cognitive limits to growth. Similar productive activities require similar capa-
bilities, so economies of scale and scope can be realized when firms expand into 
similar activities. Complementary activities require different capabilities but, as 
the degree of complementarity increases, the need for greater cooperation and 
coordination becomes more important. Joint ventures, strategic alliances or full-
scale integration may assist towards achieving sufficient cooperation and coor-
dination. If managers are rent seekers, growth is constrained by their ability to 
transfer the firm’s resources and capabilities into these new areas.
The neoclassical theory assumes firms have complete information. In reality, 
firms are neither fully informed about the best use of resources, nor do they know 
if they are properly equipped to face future contingencies. It is difficult to predict 
future changes in market demand, how best to respond to these changes, and 
what the payoffs are likely to be. Consequently, there is no point in attempting 
to estimate with any precision a production function of the type associated with 
neoclassical theory. Instead, the resource-based theory focuses on how firms can 
develop and improve their capabilities in order to adapt to a changing market 
environment. Success depends on the extent to which the firm’s managers can 
nurture adaptive capabilities. Firms whose managers are slow to innovate will 
eventually tend to decline. Managers’ decisions depend on their technical skills, 
knowledge, interpersonal and leadership skills. Different managers use similar 
resources in different ways. Accordingly, over time the capability of different 
firms tends to diverge, as does their performance.

Case study 5.2
The Buffett model is widely worshipped but 
little copied
FT
Omaha, Nebraska: a place of pilgrimage, where 35,000 shareholders of Berkshire Hatha-
way have come to pay homage. This is a global event but quintessentially American. On 
Friday, the conglomerate’s products are on sale; See’s Candies and Fruit of the Loom 
T-shirts are the most popular. Precision Castparts, the maker of specialist components 
for aircraft engines, puts on a bewildering display.
The business model is as simple as it is effective: a closed-end fund, whose shares can 
be redeemed only by selling to another investor, with a strategy of long-term commit-
ment and close engagement with the companies invested in. What is surprising is that 
Berkshire’s success produced so little imitation. Where other conglomerates use financial 
engineering and impose “transferable” management skills, Mr Buffett eschews creative 
accounting and has no illusions that he will manage Precision Castparts better than the 
incumbents. His method is to find well-run companies and give them more freedom than 
they would enjoy on public markets.
The control mechanisms in the group are tight but informal. Exchanges with analysts 
at the shareholder meeting demonstrate that the tiny staff at the headquarters in Omaha 
is familiar with what is happening in the operating businesses. Mr Buffett, however, is 
at pains to emphasise the absence of formal reporting lines and control systems, central 
budgets and targets, and complex incentive schemes. In a revealing moment, he was asked 
about the absence of conventional due diligence in his acquisition process; Berkshire had 
made bad acquisitions, he acknowledged, but never one that could have been avoided by 
the kind of information that due diligence might have revealed.
Berkshire’s success is based on the trust between the group, its operating companies 
and its investors. It is a world apart from the notion of the company as nexus of con-
tracts among people who find it mutually advantageous, for the moment, to do business 
together; a world apart from the place to which financial innovation has led us.
Mr Buffett’s particular genius is not that he is a great stock picker. His genius lies in 
the relentless clarity of his appreciation of the nature of business: focus on competitive 
advantage, find good management, give that management freedom with accountability 
only for results. And in his creation of a business model that follows those insights.

natural point of departure for many of the more recent, alternative theories of the 
firm, by asking why institutions known as firms exist at all. Why should the task 
of coordination or resource allocation be left within the sphere of the market in 
the case of some transactions, but handled within the domain of the firm for oth-
ers? Coase’s answer is that the firm’s conscious method of coordination creates a 
saving in transaction costs: the costs incurred when using market mechanisms to 
allocate resources in a world of imperfect information. Coase’s original emphasis 
was on transaction costs incurred before contracts are concluded, such as the 
costs of negotiation. The later transaction costs literature, to which Williamson is 
perhaps the most influential contributor, focuses on costs incurred after contracts 
are concluded, arising from bounded rationality, asset specificity and difficulties 
in monitoring and enforcing compliance. The transaction costs approach has 
been used to explore the question of what constitutes the most effective organiza-
tional structure. With a U-form structure, the firm’s activities are subdivided into 
functional areas (marketing, finance, production, personnel), each of which is 
run by a specialist manager. However, effective coordination becomes more diffi-
cult as the U-form firm increases in size. In the twentieth century, such problems 
were addressed by the development of the M-form structure, in which the firm is 
divided into a number of quasi-independent operating divisions. Organizational 
structures are adaptable in the light of changing conditions. With market trans-
actions, agents modify their behaviour in response to price signals. In contrast, 
organizations rely on skilled or specialised managers to take decisions as to how 
the organizational structure should adapt and evolve.
Coase’s original insights have also influenced approaches to the theory of 
the firm based on agency theory. Echoing the earlier managerial approach, 
agency theory emphasises the conflicts that can arise between principals (own-
ers or shareholders) and agents (managers). Under conditions of incomplete 
contracts and uncertainty, opportunities may arise for agents to act against the 
best interests of principals, unless the incentive structures confronting principals 
and agents are properly aligned. Alchian and Demsetz view the firm as an effi-
cient structure within which to organise team production. A central contracting 
agent (the employer or owner) carries out essential coordinating and monitor-
ing functions, which cannot be performed effectively through the medium of 
markets. Jensen and Meckling’s nexus of contracts approach focuses attention 
on the entire set of contractual relationships which bind together the firm’s 
owners, employees, material suppliers, creditors, customers and so on. The firm 
encompasses a wider set of relationships than those defined purely in terms of 
team production.
In the property rights approach, a key distinction is drawn between specific 
rights defined explicitly in the terms of contracts, and residual rights which accrue 
to the owner once all specific rights have been assigned. In a world of incomplete 
contracts, ownership of the residual rights is of paramount importance. Own-
ership of the residual rights gives control over access to physical assets, or less 
tangible assets such as brands or reputation.
Recently, resource-based theories of the firm have been developed in the 
fields of management science and strategic management. The resource-based 
approach defines firms in terms of the resources and knowledge they embody

and command. Resources include both physical inputs and intangible resources 
including technical expertise and organizational structure. The firm’s resources 
combine to produce distinctive capabilities, and the firm acts as a repository 
for all of the skills, knowledge and experience that have accumulated over time. 
Some writers emphasise knowledge as perhaps the most distinctive and impor-
tant of all the firm’s resources.
Many of these theories have provided new insights and superior analytical 
tools with which to understand the modern organization. What seems clear is 
that no single theory can, by itself, adequately capture the essence of what a firm 
is, how it acts and how it evolves. Therefore, it would be wrong to select one 
single characteristic and expect a general theory to emerge from a partial analy-
sis. A more productive approach is to draw insights from each of the theories, so 
as to develop as broad an understanding as possible.

and the mechanisms that deal with conflicts of interest between various stake-
holder groups. Agency theory, and its treatment of the possible conflicts that may 
arise between the owners or shareholders acting as principal, and its management 
acting as agent, is central to any discussion of corporate governance. A key issue 
concerns whether the maximization of shareholder value is the only legitimate 
objective of a privately owned enterprise, or whether the firm should accept a 
wider range of responsibilities towards a broader constituency of stakeholders 
including some or all of the following: employees, customers, suppliers, retailers, 
taxpayers, and society in general. Public awareness of the importance of corpo-
rate governance has risen to new heights during the early twenty-first century, 
after fraudulent accounting and various other forms of corporate malpractice 
contributed to several high-profile bankruptcies at the start of the 2000s. Various 
shortcomings in procedures for the management of risk, and compensation pack-
ages that created perverse incentives for short-termism or excessive risk-taking 
on the part of executives, are widely acknowledged as significant contributory 
factors towards the financial crisis of 2007–9.
The first four sections of this chapter examine a number of aspects of cor-
porate governance. Section 6.2 describes several agency problems that arise 
through conflicts of interest between key investors, which create a need for 
governance mechanisms to mitigate conflict. Section 6.3 details the principal 
instruments of corporate governance, by outlining the roles and responsibilities 
of the board of directors, shareholders and bondholders, chief executive officer 
and other senior management. The constraints on discretionary behaviour on 
the part of the firm’s management that are imposed by non-executive direc-
tors, various shareholder types (institutional, large and small), the dividend 
policy, the market for corporate control, and product market competition are 
examined. The role of executive compensation in shaping behaviour is also 
considered. Section 6.4 outlines the international code of practice for good cor-
porate governance that has been developed by the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD), and describes the evolution of the 
UK’s code of conduct that is currently articulated in the Financial Reporting 
Council’s (FRC) Corporate Governance Code. Section 6.5 provides a brief his-
torical overview of the implementation of corporate governance, and a selective 
review of academic research on the relationship between corporate governance 
and financial performance.
Adopting the broadest possible stakeholder definition, interest and aware-
ness of the social responsibilities of firms has grown dramatically over the past 
40 years, stimulated in part by high-profile cases of corporate misbehaviour such 
as the explosion at Union Carbide’s chemical plant at Bhopal in 1984, the oil 
spillage from the Exxon-Valdez tanker in 1989, and BP’s Deep Horizon oil rig 
explosion in 2010. These events led to an increase in the activities of pressure 
groups, and aroused the interest and indignation of households, governments 
and the media. Section 6.6 provides a brief introduction to the topic of busi-
ness ethics, centred on the contrasting views of three famous historical think-
ers from the fields of economics and philosophy: David Hume, Adam Smith 
and Milton Friedman. Section 6.7 examines the corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) movement, which has gathered momentum as increasing numbers of firms

have embraced the challenge of formulating and implementing explicit policies 
designed to satisfy stakeholder expectations and fulfil social responsibilities 
beyond the narrow pursuit of shareholder value.

Agency problems and the need for corporate governance
A narrow definition of the corporate governance of a firm might refer to the 
instruments or mechanisms available to the providers of finance that their invest-
ments are either safe or that they will yield the maximum possible return. This 
definition assumes, implicitly, that the objective of the firm is the maximiza-
tion of shareholder value. A broader definition refers to mechanisms that ensure 
management runs the firm in accordance with the objectives of several relevant 
groups of stakeholders. Relevant stakeholders might include shareholders as well 
as other groups such as employees, customers, suppliers, retailers, and so on. 
The most general definition might cover all specific legal obligations, as well as 
general responsibilities to society as a whole.
In the US and the UK, there exists a presumption in company law that the 
firm’s net assets are the private property of its shareholders, and that shareholder 
interests of profit or shareholder value maximization should define the firm’s 
objective function. In some continental European countries, including Germany, 
there is explicit provision in company law for legitimate pursuit of the objectives 
of other stakeholders. In recent years, however, there has been a tendency in con-
tinental Europe for convergence towards the shareholder-oriented Anglo-Saxon 
model. Compliance with company law is obligatory, while organizations such as 
the OECD have developed various codes of conduct for corporate governance, 
to which adherence is voluntary. Apart from compliance with company law, a 
fundamental reason why firms pay attention to governance issues is that by doing 
so they develop and strengthen the trust of their investors.
The economics of governance . . . [is] that the immediate parties to 
an exchange are actively involved in the provision of good order and 
workable arrangements.
(Williamson, 2005, p. 1)
Figure 6.1 shows at its core the ‘internal’ governance of the firm where the 
firm’s management, acting on behalf of its shareholders, decides how best to raise 
funds for investment. This function is overseen by the board of directors, who 
are responsible for the general oversight of the managers, and setting their terms 
of employment and remuneration. In the UK the Cadbury Report (1992), one of 
the earliest codes of practice for corporate governance, placed heavy emphasis 
on the responsibilities of the board of directors for ensuring good governance. 
Adopting a broader perspective, Figure 6.1 shows the core ‘internal’ governance 
of the firm surrounded by an ‘external’ governance based on a nexus of contracts 
definition of the firm (see Section 5.4). The most important element in this sphere 
is the shareholders, who elect the board of directors. Shareholders are joined by

127
employees, suppliers, customers and creditors who have contractual relationships 
with the core. This nexus of contracts is positioned within a larger environment 
encompassing markets, law, regulation, and the culture of the society in which 
the firm is located.
Agency theory, introduced in Section 5.4, is integral to any discussion of cor-
porate governance issues. An agency problem arises when there is a separation 
within the firm of ownership from control (see also Section 4.3). Managers apply 
the funds contributed by investors to productive activities that are expected to 
generate returns, and investors rely upon the managers’ specialist skills to gen-
erate a return on their investments. In the terminology of agency theory, the 
management is the agent, contracted by the shareholders or principal to generate 
a return on the shareholders’ investment. In a world of imperfect or asymmetric 
information, however, the managers cannot always be relied upon to act in the 
shareholders’ best interests, and the shareholders might not always be able to 
monitor the managers’ actions effectively, owing to a lack of information. In 
other words, an agency problem arises from the potential conflict of interest that 
characterises the relationship between principal and agent.
The two most common sources of agency problem that arise from the 
­principal–agent relationship between shareholder and manager are first, perqui-
sites, also known as discretionary or expense-preference behaviour; and second, 
empire-building. Perquisites refers to diversion of the resources of the firm to 
support on-the-job consumption by the managers, through means such as luxury 
offices, expense accounts, foreign travel, and so on. Empire-building consists 
of the pursuit of growth for its own sake, rather than growth that is targeted at 
increasing shareholder value. A merger and acquisition deal that fails to gener-
ate efficiency savings or synergy (see also Chapter 19), but which enhances the

status or reputation of the management team that brokered the deal, is a typical 
example of empire-building behaviour on the part of management that fails to 
advance, or might be damaging to, shareholder interests.
One solution to the separation of ownership and control might be for the 
parties to enter into a legally binding complete contract, which specifies what 
actions the managers must take, and the rewards they will receive, under every 
possible contingency or state of the world (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). In a world 
of uncertainty and asymmetric information, however, it is difficult to draw up 
complete contracts that are capable of anticipating every possible future contin-
gency. Accordingly, agreements are required on the allocation of residual rights 
to control under the contingency that the firm goes into liquidation. At one 
extreme one could imagine a contract that assigns the residual rights to control to 
the shareholders who supplied the finance, and who enjoy the residual property 
rights in the assets that remain after all other prior obligations and debts have 
been settled. However, shareholders are not necessarily best placed to make deci-
sions on how to make best use of their own funds when unexpected events occur. 
After all, they hired the managers to do just that! Consequently, the managers 
are typically assigned most of the residual rights to control, and are therefore 
afforded a large amount of discretion. Corporate governance attempts to impose 
limits on this discretionary behaviour.
Other agency problems within the firm may arise from conflicts of interest 
between large (majority) and small (minority) shareholders, or between bond-
holders (holders of debt) and shareholders (holders of equity). The potential 
conflict of interest between majority and minority shareholders arises from the 
possibility that the former use their controlling interest to expropriate the value 
of the latter’s shareholding. For example, a shareholder with a majority interest 
in Company A and a 100 per cent interest in Company B faces an incentive to 
transfer assets from Company A to Company B, or to overcharge Company A 
for services provided by Company B.
In the event of bankruptcy, bondholders have the prior claim to recovery of 
the debt by realizing the remaining value of the firm’s assets. In conditions of 
uncertainty, the maximum payoff to bondholders is recovery of the full value 
of the debt, while the downside risk to bondholders is the loss of the debt. By 
contrast, the maximum payoff to shareholders is unbounded, while the downside 
risk is the loss of the value of the equity. The current value of the equity is 
the difference between the value of the firm’s assets and the value of its debt. If 
the current value of the equity is small, there is a risk-shifting incentive for the 
shareholders to sanction investments in high-risk projects, because the upside 
benefit is unlimited while the downside risk to shareholders (loss of the value of 
the equity) is small. On the contrary, bondholders prefer low-risk investments, 
because the upside benefit is the same regardless of the level of risk while the 
downside risk to bondholders (loss of the value of the debt) is large.
Jensen and Meckling (1976) point out that in a firm part-financed by equity 
and part by debt, the equity has characteristics similar to those of a call option 
on the ownership of the firm. A call option on any asset gives the holder the 
right, but not the obligation, to purchase the asset at a predetermined price on 
a specified future date. Suppose a firm has a bond issue outstanding, calling for 

	
	
	
6.3  Instruments of corporate governance	 |	
129
a single payment to redeem the bond (repay the debt) on maturity. At matu-
rity the shareholders have the following choice: either repay the debt and retain 
ownership of the firm; or fail to repay the debt, file for bankruptcy and sacrifice 
ownership. The equity is like a call option: when the debt matures the sharehold-
ers can either pay a fixed sum to retain the ownership of the firm (exercise the 
option), or do nothing and sacrifice ownership (allow the option to lapse). The 
distinction between the original shares, and options on those shares, becomes 
somewhat blurred. The fact that the value of any option is a positive function of 
the volatility of the underlying asset explains shareholders’ risk-shifting incentive 
for investment in high-risk projects. The bondholders, who are effectively the 
counterparty to the call option, prefer low-risk investments.
Myers (1977) identifies a second type of debt agency problem, known as the 
underinvestment incentive. Shareholders bear all of the cost of investment in 
positive net present value (NPV) projects, but only realise part of the benefit. 
The rest accrues to bondholders in the form of a reduced probability of failing 
to recover their investments. Therefore shareholders face an incentive to under-
invest. Recognizing both the risk-shifting incentive and the underinvestment 
incentive, investors in bonds will demand a higher return on their investments, 
imposing an agency cost on the firm.
	
6.3	
Instruments of corporate governance
Corporate governance comprises a number of instruments or mechanisms that 
mitigate the conflicts of interest that may arise between the shareholders acting 
as principal and the managers acting as agent, or between different groups of 
investor (large versus small shareholders, or bondholders versus shareholders), or 
more generally between various other stakeholder groups. The principal instru-
ments of corporate governance, described in full by Goergen (2012), are identi-
fied in this section.
Boards of directors
Boards of directors may be either one-tier or two-tier. Membership of a one-
tier board comprises both executive and non-executive directors. Executive 
directors include the chief executive officer (CEO) and other senior members 
of the management team. Non-executive directors are appointed to represent 
the interests of all of the shareholders collectively, and (sometimes) other inves-
tors or other stakeholders. In firms that operate under a board structure of 
­chairman–CEO duality, the CEO is also the chairman of the board. In other 
cases, chairman of the board and CEO are separate roles. Duality may bring 
advantages of decisive leadership, with the leadership of the firm clearly vested 
in one individual. However, duality may tend to give rise to a lack of indepen-
dence of the board from senior management. Separation of these two roles 
might allow for more robust, independent oversight of management perfor-
mance by the board, but separation might also lead to situations of conflict 
between the chairman and the CEO.

130	
|	 6    ■    Corporate governance
Firms in the US, UK and several other countries operate with one-tier boards 
of directors. In some other countries, including Germany, a two-tier board 
structure operates. A supervisory board comprising non-executive directors is 
constituted separately from the management board, comprising the CEO and 
other senior members of the management team. In a two-tier system, individual 
members of the supervisory board might represent the interests of particular 
shareholders or other stakeholders such as employees, customers or suppli-
ers. A two-tier board structure might strengthen the supervisory capability 
of the non-executive directors, by affording them greater independence from 
the CEO or the firm’s senior management in general. In some cases, however, 
lack of information, expertise, and incompetence might limit the effectiveness 
of non-executive directors’ supervisory contribution. The Work and Pensions 
and Business, Innovations and Skills Parliamentary Select Committees (2016) 
investigating the financial problems facing British Home Stores, a British retail 
chain, concluded that:
The complacent performance of Lord Grabiner as the non-executive 
Chairman of the Taveta group boards represented the apogee of weak 
corporate governance. It was his responsibility to provide independent 
challenge and oversight. Instead he was content to provide a veneer of 
establishment credibility to the group while happily disengaging from the 
key decisions he had a responsibility to scrutinise. For this deplorable 
performance he received a considerable salary. (p. 48)
Shareholders
Significant shareholdings in many firms are in the hands of institutional inves-
tors, such as banks, insurance companies and pension funds. It is difficult 
to generalise as to whether share ownership by institutional investors tends to 
create a more or a less effective supervisory regime for monitoring manage-
rial performance and constraining discretionary behaviour. Some studies report 
that institutional investors are relatively passive, perhaps lacking the expertise, 
resources or motivation to become closely involved in monitoring the perfor-
mance of the firms in which they hold shares. Institutional investors may prefer 
to sell their shares, rather than attempt to intervene in the running of the firm, 
in the event of perceived underperformance on the part of management. There 
are some recorded instances, however, of institutional investors having adopted 
a more hands-on approach. Clear evidence is scarce, since any intervention on 
the part of the institutional investors is likely to take place in private, beyond 
the glare of publicity.
Shareholder activism, or mobilization of small shareholders to attend annual 
general meetings or extraordinary general meetings, in order to use their voting 
rights to create pressure or achieve policy changes, has been advocated by some 
as a promising tool for improving corporate governance. It has also been sug-
gested, however, that intervention by small shareholders only tends to gather 
sufficient momentum to enforce change in extreme adverse circumstances. If so, 
small shareholder activism is more likely to operate as a vehicle for punishing 

	
	
	
6.3  Instruments of corporate governance	 |	
131
management that has already failed, rather than as a means for promoting good 
management performance.
Firms whose share ownership is widely dispersed might experience a form of 
freerider problem. No single shareholder has sufficient incentive to devote effort 
to monitoring, because most of the benefit would accrue to other shareholders, 
who gain by freeriding. By contrast, firms with large individual sharehold-
ers might benefit from superior corporate governance, since a large shareholder 
gains more of the benefit from their own monitoring effort. It has been suggested, 
however, that large shareholders might be drawn to intervene excessively in tasks 
that are best left in the hands of professional managers. Collectively, empirical 
studies that examine the relationship between the concentration of ownership 
and performance fail to identify any consistent empirical pattern.
Dividend policy and debt finance
The regular payment of a relatively high dividend to shareholders serves as a 
disciplining device that mitigates the conflict of interest between shareholders 
and managers. By paying dividends, managers reduce the free resources within 
the firm that are available to fund their own discretionary behaviour. A high divi-
dend policy may help support the firm’s share price and enhance either the man-
agers’ job security, or managerial compensation that may be linked to the share 
price. Accordingly, managers may face a trade-off between using free resources to 
either pay dividends or finance their own perquisites or empire-building activities. 
A reputation for paying a high dividend creates pressure to maintain the flow of 
dividend payments, even during periods when profits are temporarily reduced. 
Managers may seek to avoid large fluctuations in dividend payments from year 
to year, which may send negative signals to current and potential shareholders.
In Germany, debt finance accounts for a larger share of the total financing of 
firms than in the UK and US, where equity finance is more important. Firms whose 
debt is in the hands of a small number of individual bondholders might enjoy ben-
efits similar to those with large individual shareholders. Regardless of the disper-
sion of the bondholders, a high ratio of debt to equity finance imposes constraints 
on managerial discretion, owing to the legal obligation to pay interest on the debt.
Executive compensation and share ownership
The design and structure of executive compensation packages is likely to be a 
key determinant of the extent to which the incentives of top managers are either 
aligned or misaligned with shareholder interests (Edmans and Gabaix, 2016). In 
addition to the basic salary and any employee benefits and perquisites, executive 
compensation packages may include cash bonuses related to firm performance, 
share ownership, and call options.
Cash bonuses typically depend on some aspect of firm performance that reflects 
the role of the executive. Cash bonuses are usually discretionary rather than con-
tractual. Some firms reward their executives by allocating shares as part of the 
compensation package. Often a minimum time period must elapse before the exec-
utive is permitted to sell the shares: restrictions of up to five years are common. 

132	
|	 6    ■    Corporate governance
Executive share ownership might be seen as a promising instrument for promoting 
good governance, by means of a natural alignment of shareholder and managerial 
interests. However, managers whose personal finances become overly dependent 
on the performance of one firm might become excessively risk-averse, avoiding 
risky projects that are expected to enhance shareholder value owing to concern 
over the downside risk. A manager with a substantial shareholding might be in 
a position to block attempts by other shareholders or non-executive directors to 
monitor their actions or impose sanctions in the event of underperformance.
Call options were used extensively in executive compensation packages in the 
US during the 1990s and early 2000s, when they were not treated as an expense 
in financial statements. This exemption was withdrawn in 2005. As noted above, 
a call option on a firm’s shares gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, 
to purchase shares in the company at a predetermined price, known as the strike 
price, on a specified future date known as the expiration date. If the market 
price of the share exceeds the strike price on the expiration date, the exercise 
of the option yields an instant profit to the option-holder. If the share price is 
below the strike price on the expiration date, the option simply expires without 
being exercised, and is valueless. It has been argued that awarding call options 
to CEOs as part of their compensation helps align shareholder and manage-
rial interests, since shareholders and option-holders have a common interest in 
maintaining a high share price. In contrast to executive share ownership, options 
may encourage risk-taking behaviour on the part of executives, perhaps exces-
sively, because the value of an option is positively related to the volatility of the 
share price. Put differently, the upside benefit for option-holders is potentially 
infinite, while the downside risk is constrained by the fact that the value of an 
option cannot fall below zero. However, an excessive focus on the share price 
might create perverse incentives for executives to manipulate financial report-
ing, or to use corporate resources to inflate the share price artificially during the 
run-up to the expiration date.
The market for corporate control
In a liquid stock market with high trading volumes, the share price of an under-
performing firm tends to fall, leaving the firm vulnerable to the prospect of a 
hostile takeover by a new owner or ownership group who expect to be able put 
the firm’s assets into more productive use, and therefore view the acquisition as 
a means of acquiring these assets cheaply. New owners would be expected 
to replace the firm’s existing managers with their own appointees. This threat to 
the job security of existing managers acts as a disciplining device, by imposing 
limits on the extent to which they can risk indulging in discretionary behaviour 
that may cause the share price to fall. However, the threat of a hostile takeover 
is a rather costly and extreme instrument for correcting managerial failure. This 
threat is only credible if there is a liquid market in the firm’s shares; otherwise, 
poor managerial performance might not be reflected in a reduced share price. 
For this reason the market for corporate control is often seen as a more effective 
instrument of corporate governance in the US and the UK, with their large and 
highly liquid stock markets, than in most other countries.

Competition in the market for products or services
Competition in the market for the firm’s products or services imposes limits on 
the scope for discretionary behaviour on the part of management under any 
corporate governance system. Accordingly, competitive discipline may be viewed 
as an indirect instrument of corporate governance. Intense competition reduces 
the extent to which any inefficiencies in the firm’s production that raise average 
or marginal costs may be offset by charging a higher price for the firm’s product 
or service. Intense competition may also assist the monitoring of the managers’ 
performance, enabling direct comparisons to be drawn with the performance of 
similar firms in close competition.
	
6.4	
Corporate governance codes of practice
Since corporate governance is essential for the development and success of private 
business activity, most countries around the world have introduced and developed 
guidelines or recommendations for good corporate governance (Hart, 1995b). An 
OECD (1998) report identified four key principles: fairness, transparency, account-
ability and responsibility. Fairness refers to the protection of shareholders’ rights. 
Shareholders hold property rights in the corporation, and participatory rights 
which involve them in the employment of managers and making their views known 
over a range of general business strategies. Transparency refers to the need to make 
all relevant information available to shareholders and other investors, who are 
then able to make informed decisions. Company accounts should be accurate and 
competently audited, and information regarding ownership, voting rights, board 
composition and the remuneration of managers should be disclosed. Accountabil-
ity refers to the responsibility of boards to monitor the performance of managers, 
and generally be accountable to shareholders for their actions. The board has 
a duty to the firm’s owners, and should try to avoid conflicts of interest. The 
board should not be too close to the managers, so as not to hinder its monitoring 
function. The recruitment of non-executive and independent directors can further 
strengthen accountability. Responsibility refers to corporations not only abiding by 
a country’s laws, but also meeting culture-driven expectations of ethical behaviour 
towards stakeholders. Corporations should avoid socially harmful actions, even 
when there is no legal obligation to do so. Such responsibilities may vary from 
country to country, and corporate governance should reflect societal culture.
Revised subsequently, the OECD (2004) Principles of Corporate Governance 
have become internationally accepted as a benchmark for good corporate gov-
ernance. The Principles are organised under six headings:
1.	 Ensuring a basis for an effective corporate governance framework. The frame-
work should promote transparent and efficient markets and compliance with 
the rule of law, and should define the responsibilities of supervisory, regula-
tory and enforcement agencies.
2.	 The rights of shareholders and key ownership functions. The framework should 
protect and facilitate the exercise of shareholder rights.

134	
|	 6    ■    Corporate governance
3.	 The equitable treatment of shareholders. All shareholders, including minor-
ity and foreign shareholders, should be treated equitably and should have 
redress if their rights are violated.
4.	 The role of stakeholders in corporate governance. The framework should rec-
ognise the rights of stakeholders established by law or mutual covenant, and 
encourage cooperation between firms and stakeholders in creating wealth 
and jobs and promoting financially stable enterprise.
5.	 Disclosure and transparency. The framework should promote timely and 
accurate disclosure on relevant matters including financial situation, per-
formance, ownership and governance.
6.	 Responsibilities of the board. The framework should ensure effective strategic 
leadership, monitoring and accountability to shareholders.
The OECD has acknowledged that the financial crisis of 2007–9 exposed some 
serious weaknesses in corporate governance in many countries. OECD (2009) 
identifies several areas of concern. In the field of executive compensation, manag-
ers typically have too much influence over performance-related pay. The gover-
nance process for compensation should be more clearly defined, and the role of 
non-executive directors should be strengthened. The link between performance 
and compensation is often weak, and hard to identify. Compensation schemes 
are opaque, impose limited downside risk, and thereby encourage excessive risk-
taking by managers. Greater transparency in compensation structures is needed, 
and compensation should be linked more closely to long-term performance.
The financial crisis raised further concerns over the quality of risk manage-
ment. The latter requires an enterprise-wide approach, and should not be con-
fined to individual business units within the firm. The reporting of risks to the 
business, and risk management strategies, to the board of directors should be 
strengthened. The board should understand the nature of risk, and take respon-
sibility for the integration of risk management into the overall corporate strategy. 
The firm’s attitudes to risk, and its risk management processes, should be made 
explicit, and adequately disclosed to the market.
Finally, the financial crisis exposed several weaknesses in the areas of board 
composition and shareholder engagement. Competence, as well as independence, 
should be a key criterion in the selection of non-executive directors. Board mem-
ber responsibilities should be specified and disclosed. Chairman–CEO duality 
is generally discouraged, but exceptions are possible depending upon circum-
stances. The shareholders’ role in nominating and appointing board members 
should be strengthened, and companies should do more to engage their own 
shareholders. Institutional investors in particular should play a more active role 
in corporate governance.
In the UK the Cadbury Report (1992) was the first published code of practice 
for corporate governance, targeted primarily at companies with a London Stock 
Exchange listing. Its main recommendations were: the roles of chairman of the 
board of directors and CEO should be separate (no duality); board membership 
should include a significant number of independent, non-executive directors; 
a nomination committee, composed mainly of non-executives, should oversee 

	
	
	
6.4  Corporate governance codes of practice	 |	
135
nominations of executives and non-executives to the board; a remuneration 
committee, also composed mainly of non-executives, should scrutinise executive 
compensation; an audit committee should oversee financial reporting and disclo-
sure; and institutional investors should disclose their voting policy.
Subsequently, the Greenbury Report (1995) contained recommendations that 
strengthened the independence and reporting responsibilities of the remunera-
tion committee, introduced provisions for the disclosure of executive compen-
sation on an individual basis, and requirements for the alignment of executive 
compensation with company performance. The Hampel Report (1998), which 
consolidated the recommendations of the earlier reports into a Combined Code, 
further emphasised the responsibility of institutional investors to use their voting 
power constructively, and recommended a strengthening of systems for internal 
control to protect shareholder interests. A revised Combined Code was published 
in 2006, consolidating a number of additional recommendations on matters such 
as the composition of the audit, nomination and remuneration committees, and 
the frequency and content of reporting and disclosure, which appeared in the 
Turnbull Report in 1999, the Myners Report in 2001, and the Higgs Report and 
Smith Report, both in 2003.
The current UK Corporate Governance Code was published by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC, 2010). The FRC identifies five main principles: leader-
ship, effectiveness, accountability, remuneration and relations with shareholders. 
These cover territory similar to the OECD Principles described above. The FRC 
states that the Code should not be interpreted too rigidly or mechanistically, and 
any departures should not automatically be seen as breaches of the Code. The 
ethos is to encourage dialogue, rather than confrontation. An important prin-
ciple is the ‘Comply or Explain’ approach, whereby a firm is required to either 
follow the Code or explain to shareholders why it has not done so. A key feature 
is that the Code should not be over-prescriptive, and should not burden every 
firm with regulations that might not be applicable to some. Alternatives to the 
Code may be implemented, subject to the proviso that they are explained and 
justified. Exceptions might apply to smaller listed and unlisted firms, as well as 
firms with different board structures.

Women on boards of largest companies reaches 
all-time high

More women than ever before are on the boards of the UK’s largest companies. As of this 
month, they have 23 per cent of boardroom positions, not far short of the government’s 
target of 25 per cent by 2015. However, Vince Cable, business secretary, urged companies 
to keep up the momentum, adding those that had not met the target ‘need to take firm

action now’. Mr Cable and Lord Davies, who wrote a report on the subject in 2011, have 
also written to the chairmen of smaller companies, warning that ‘doing nothing is not 
an option any more’ and that ‘we will continue to shine the spotlight on the remaining 
companies’ that have not met the 25 per cent target.
Between March and October, the percentage of women on boards of FTSE100 companies 
rose from 20.7 to 22.8 per cent, or 249 of 1,094 board positions, according to the Depart-
ment for Business, Innovation & Skills. At smaller FTSE250 companies, the percentage, 
although significantly lower, rose from 15.6 to 17.4 per cent. Thirty-nine companies have 
now met the 25 per cent target, up from 36 in March. ‘From a low start at 12.5 per cent 
in 2011 . . . progress of this order is by any standards an amazing achievement,’ said Lord 
Davies. ‘Our goal is clearly in sight, albeit 25 per cent is not gender parity.’
In July 2014, the last bastion of all-male boards in the FTSE100 fell when Glencore 
appointed its first female non-executive director, Patrice Merrin. It had been the only UK 
blue-chip without a woman on its board this year after Antofagasta, the copper miner, 
hired a former Chilean minister. Also in July, however, Mr Cable’s hopes of using all-
female shortlists to get more women on to boards were dashed when the Equality and 
Human Rights Commission said it would be unlawful. Although 19 more boards in the 
FTSE250 had appointed at least one woman since March, 28 all-male boards remain. 
‘This is not about political correctness. This is about good governance and good business,’ 
Mr Cable and Lord Davies wrote in their letter to FTSE250 chairmen. ‘The international 
evidence supports this: diverse boards are better boards benefiting from fresh perspec-
tives, opinions and new ideas which ultimately serve the company’s long term interests.’
FTSE250 companies with no women on their board include 3i Infrastructure, Centa-
min, City of London Investment Trust, Enterprise Inns, Ferrexpo, JD Sports Fashion, 
Perpetual Income & Growth Investment Trust, and Petra Diamonds. ‘Having reached 
a position where it is unacceptable for the voice of women to be absent from the board-
room, it is disappointing to see there are still 29 all-male boards in the FTSE 250,’ Lord 
Davies said.
Although female representation on boards increased, they still account for only 8.4 per 
cent of executive directorships at FTSE100 companies. And the number of new appoint-
ments going to women also fell – to 31.8 per cent of all new appointments, down from 
35.5 per cent in the previous six months.

of 1929. Not long afterwards, Coase’s (1937) article ‘The nature of the firm’ 
introduced the concept of transaction costs as a framework for understanding 
the reasons for the formation of firms, and the ways in which they operate (see 
Sections 4.3, 5.2 and 5.3).
During the three decades following the end of the Second World War, the 
large multinational corporation appeared to have established an unassailable 
position for itself as the predominant form of privately owned productive orga-
nization, staffed by a technocratic layer of professional management. Accord-
ingly, much of the academic literature of the 1950s and 1960s was concerned with 
analysing the decisions and actions of large corporations governed by an autono-
mous managerial class (see Section 4.3). Plender (2003) discusses reasons for the 
failure of past corporate governance to constrain the activities of managers and 
boards of directors. Prior to the 1980s, a cadre of strong and entrenched manag-
ers exercising considerable autonomy, together with weak accounting practices, 
led to empire-building and the pursuit of growth to the detriment of shareholder 
profits. However, a range of unacceptable practices, such as hostile takeovers fol-
lowed by asset-stripping, excessive executive compensation, and the issue of junk 
bonds, led eventually to the growth of a ‘shareholder value movement’, which 
succeeded, temporarily, in constraining managerial discretion.
By the 1990s and early 2000s, the pendulum had swung gently but inexorably 
back in the direction of management. As noted above, the issue of call options to 
provide incentives for managers to target growth in the firm’s share price, offer-
ing prolific rewards for those who succeeded by the time their options expired, 
was not treated in the US as an accounting expense. Consequently, options 
became an attractive boardroom currency, because their use allowed managers 
to be remunerated in a manner that left profit-and-loss accounts undisturbed. 
This led to an increase in option-leveraged ownership, providing managers with 
rewards far in excess of their true productivity. To mitigate the consequent dilu-
tion of existing equity, firms would borrow in order to buy back their own shares. 
The net effect was a transfer of wealth from shareholders to managers. Another 
factor was a tendency to interpret the share price as the only valid measure of a 
firm’s performance, leading to excessive ‘short-termism’ on the part of manag-
ers. Some were tempted to adopt ‘creative’ accounting techniques allowing, for 
example, the maintenance of high earnings to mask underlying weaknesses in 
the business. When the danger increased that the bubble might burst, a hast-
ily arranged merger and acquisition deal might further inflate the firm’s share 
price in the short term. In some instances, creative accounting would shade into 
illegal practice. CEOs with their large executive compensation packages and sta-
tus to match operated increasingly in a self-contained world of hubris or ‘self-­
attribution’ (Monbiot, 2011) or ‘wilful blindness’ (Heffernan, 2011).
The collapse of Enron Corporation in 2001 is widely regarded as a defining 
moment in the history of corporate governance (Asad and Hoje, 2010). Enron 
was a US conglomerate that traded in electricity, natural gas, water, communi-
cations, and pulp and paper, with 20,000 employees and revenue of over $100 
billion in 2000. Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2001, when it was 
revealed that its financial position had been sustained by fraudulent accounting

practices over a period of years during which the firm had pursued an aggres-
sive growth strategy. Enron had created a number of offshore entities known as 
special-purpose units, which enabled the firm to maintain the illusion that it was 
highly profitable, when it was actually realizing large losses that were transferred 
to the offshore entities and not reported. Anticipated future profits were system-
atically reported as if they had already been realised, while the firm’s executives 
focused obsessively on maintaining a high share price. Investors were unaware of 
the existence of the offshore units that were hiding the firm’s losses, while several 
executives who were aware of the true situation were trading illegally in the firm’s 
stock on the basis of insider information. The firm’s auditors Arthur Andersen, 
at the time one of the world’s ‘big five’ accounting firms, were heavily implicated 
in the Enron scandal. The reputational damage was terminal, and in 2002, Arthur 
Andersen voluntarily surrendered its licence to practise in the US. The Enron 
case was quickly followed by several other accounting and corporate governance 
scandals, the largest of which involved the collapse of the telecommunications 
firm WorldCom in 2002 where, once again, revenues had been inflated and losses 
disguised through fraudulent accounting practice.
Enron, WorldCom and several other US corporate scandals of the early 2000s 
strengthened the motivation for the passage of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 
which contained a range of provisions to strengthen corporate governance and 
address the weaknesses revealed by the previous scandals. The Act defines stan-
dards for auditor independence, and strengthens the independent oversight of 
public accounting firms providing auditing services. Stricter reporting require-
ments for financial transactions, including off-balance-sheet transactions, are 
imposed. Senior executives are held directly accountable for the accuracy of 
financial statements, and the management and auditors are required to pro-
duce an internal control report and comment on the soundness of the financial 
reporting. Criminal penalties for white-collar crime are strengthened, and some 
incentives are provided for whistle-blowers. Responsibilities are imposed on 
lawyers acting on behalf of the firm to report any irregularities to the CEO in 
the first instance, or to the audit committee and board of directors if the situ-
ation persists. There are provisions for the regulation of financial analysts by 
stock exchanges, and for disclosure of conflicts of interest that may arise from 
the dual role of financial analysts as advisors and traders. While there have been 
complaints from the corporate sector concerning the costs of compliance with 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, there is also evidence that firms that have improved 
their internal controls and financial reporting have benefited from an improve-
ment in investor confidence, through reduced borrowing costs or an increase in 
shareholder value.
There exists an extensive academic literature on the relationship between cor-
porate governance and financial performance (Bebchuk and Weisenbach, 2010; 
Agrawal and Knoeber, 2012). This section concludes by reviewing a few selected 
studies. A dilution of shareholder rights would enable the firm’s managers to 
pursue policies designed to protect and entrench their own positions. Gompers, 
Ishii and Metrick (GIM, 2003) investigate the relationship between a measure 
of shareholder rights known as the G-Index, and long-term stock returns and 
market value of the firm. The G-index is based on 24 corporate governance

provisions for 1,500 US firms. A point is awarded for each provision that restricts 
shareholder rights. For example, ‘classified boards’ which stagger elections to 
the board, calling special meetings, altering by-laws, or suing directors can, if 
used injudiciously, afford increased powers to managers. The highest decile of 
the index, comprising firms with the most powerful management, is referred 
to as the ‘dictatorship portfolio’; the lowest decile is the ‘democracy portfolio’. 
Between 1990 and 1999, the democracy portfolio outperformed the dictatorship 
portfolio by a statistically significant 8.5 per cent per year. In 1999, a one-point 
difference in the index was associated with an 11.4 per cent difference in Tobin’s 
q, a measure of market value of the company compared to the replacement value 
of the firm’s assets. Weak shareholder rights were associated with lower profit-
ability and lower sales growth.
Since the choice of corporate governance arrangements is not random, GIM 
consider three hypotheses that might explain the difference in performance 
between the two groups. Hypothesis 1 is that, at the start of the period, share-
holders failed to recognise that a reduction in their rights would lead to higher 
agency costs and the inability to replace poor managers. Hypothesis 2 is that 
there is no relationship between governance and performance, and the observed 
differences arise from managers fearing poor performance at the start of the 
period, and introducing provisions to weaken shareholder rights, affording 
the managers enhanced protection. This hypothesis recognises the possibility 
of reverse causality between performance and governance. Hypothesis 3 is that 
the differences are explained by omitted variables such as the size of firm or the 
level of institutional ownership. GIM find some evidence to support hypothesis 
1, but none for hypothesis 2. In accordance with hypothesis 3, up to one-third of 
the variation in performance can be attributed to other factors.
The G-Index is used by Malmendier and Tate (2009) to examine the perfor-
mance of award-winning CEOs featured in US magazines including Forbes, For-
tune and Time. Performance typically fell after an award was conferred, and was 
weaker on average than in similar firms with non-award-winning CEOs. Award-
winning CEOs tend to secure increased remuneration, and spend more time on 
public and private diversions. Underperformance and rent extraction by award-
winning CEOs is strongest in firms characterised by weak governance accord-
ing to the G-Index. Award winners in firms with strong governance achieve 
performance that was marginally stronger than the performance of firms with 
non-award winning CEOs.
Pissaris et al. (2010) ask whether the relationship between pay disparity, the 
difference in the remuneration of CEOs and managers at a lower level in the cor-
porate hierarchy, and financial performance is best explained by agency theory 
(corporate governance) or tournament theory. The latter interprets high CEO 
remuneration as a ‘prize’, which provides incentives for junior executives to com-
pete against each other in an effort to emerge as the top performer and become 
eligible for future promotion to the rank of CEO. The prize can also mean an 
increase in the value of executives to other firms in the industry (Waldman, 2013). 
The larger the firm, the greater is the pay disparity. Tournament theory suggests 
a positive relationship between pay disparity and financial performance. By con-
trast, agency theory suggests that in firms with weak governance, shareholders 

140	
|	 6    ■    Corporate governance
are less effective in monitoring management. Accordingly, agency theory points 
to a negative association between pay disparity and financial performance.
. . .  (T)he results suggest that firms characterised by weaker monitoring 
and transparency suffer from lower performance in the presence of high 
pay disparity than strongly governed firms. In other words, while pay 
disparity can provide incentives for better performance, consistent with 
tournament theory, it can become destructive in the absence of other 
governance measures and exacerbate agency conflict.
(Pissaris et al., 2010, p. 307)
The corporate governance of banks and other financial institutions has been 
subject to intense scrutiny by politicians, the media and the general public since 
the onset of the financial crisis of the late 2000s (Mehran et al., 2011, Hagendorff, 
2015). Box 6.1 provides an overview of academic research on the corporate gov-
ernance of banks before and during the financial crisis.
Box 6.1
The corporate governance of banks
Financial institutions, and particularly banks, are subject to control mechanisms which 
differ from those of non-financial firms, owing to the unique role played by banks in the 
wider economy (Adams and Mehran, 2003). Depositors, shareholders and regulators 
maintain a shared interest in the corporate governance mechanisms of banks. The added 
regulatory dimension makes the analysis of corporate governance more complex than in 
the case of non-financial firms (Hagendorff, 2015).
Board size and composition, executive compensation, bank ownership and crosshold-
ings, and the market for corporate control are key elements of the system of bank corpo-
rate governance (Allen and Gale, 2000). Executives’ personal and professional attitudes 
towards power, entrenchment and ethics, play a role in determining the degree of align-
ment between executive and shareholder interests, and the extent to which executives pur-
sue the maximization of shareholders’ value. Governance is further shaped by prudential 
regulation and mechanisms of market discipline, which can give rise to further difficulties. 
Prudential regulation relies heavily on accounting data, which may be opaque and mis-
leading. Errors or even fraud in financial reporting could prevent regulators from carry-
ing out effective supervision. Market discipline varies widely across countries, depending 
on factors such as the legal framework, the level of stock market development, and the 
market for corporate control (Flannery, 2012).
The incentive for shareholders to monitor banks depends on how effectively their rights 
are protected (Levine, 2004; Adams and Mehran, 2008; Adams et al., 2010). This perhaps 
explains why banks with dispersed (unconcentrated) ownership structures tend to be more 
prevalent in countries with stronger laws for shareholder protection.

Corporate governance and financial performance
A number of studies of corporate governance in banking examine how risk and per-
formance are affected by factors such as laws concerning investor protection, bank 
regulation, and the extent of ownership concentration. Much of the evidence refers to 
the US. Elyasiani and Jia (2008) find that stable institutional ownership improves the 
performance of US bank holding companies. Vyas (2011) finds banks with strong cor-
porate governance (measured as an index of attributes including board structure and 
composition and executive compensation practices) tend to recognise and write off 
delinquent loans in a timelier fashion. Panthan (2009) finds that US bank holding com-
panies whose CEOs exercise greater influence over board decisions tend to be riskier. 
Cornett et al. (2010) examine corporate governance mechanisms and the performance 
of publicly traded US banks before and during the financial crisis of the late 2000s. The 
linkage between CEO pay and financial performance, and the extent of insider owner-
ship, weakened significantly around the financial crisis. Stronger corporate governance 
was associated with stronger financial performance. Berger et al. (2014) examine the 
relationship between board composition (age, gender and education) and risk-taking 
behaviour on the part of German banks. Boards with higher proportions of younger 
and female executives tend to accept more risk, while boards with a higher proportion of 
members with PhD qualifications accept less risk. Ellul and Yerramilli (2013) find that 
internal risk control systems play an important role in bank behaviour and performance. 
Using a dataset comprising the 75 largest US bank holding companies, the authors find 
that those banks with more robust internal control systems exhibited higher operating 
performance and lower risk during the financial crisis. Minton et al. (2014) investigate 
whether there is a relationship between the financial expertise of independent directors 
and risk of US commercial holding companies prior to and during the 2007–8 financial 
crisis. The authors find that an increase in the proportion of independents with financial 
expertise is positively related to bank risk. In the period prior to the financial crisis, such 
financial expertise and increased risk led to higher levels of performance relative to coun-
terparts with boards with less financial expertise. However, during the financial crisis 
the opposite was the case. The authors contend that these results challenge the view that 
greater financial expertise among independent directors reduces the risk-taking activities 
of financial institutions.
Several cross-country studies present comparative evidence on the corporate gover-
nance of banks. In a study of 244 banks in 44 countries, Caprio et al. (2007) find that 
concentrated ownership, often in the hands of families, foundations or the state, tends 
to increase shareholder value. Weak shareholder protection law has the opposite effect. 
Laeven and Levine (2009) find that risk is higher in banks with concentrated ownership. 
This effect is weaker, however, in countries with strong shareholder protection. Con-
centrated ownership is therefore helpful in mitigating the negative effect on shareholder 
value of weak shareholder protection. Beltratti and Stulz (2012) find that banks with more 
shareholder-friendly boards performed worse during the financial crisis of the late 2000s. 
Banks in countries with stricter capital regulation, and with more independent supervi-
sion, typically performed better.

Executive compensation and financial performance
The structure of executive remuneration is likely to be a key determinant of corporate 
strategy and performance (Houston and James, 1995; Bolton et al., 2010; Frydman and 
Jenter, 2010; Edmans and Gabaix, 2016).
Managerial ownership of equity and options in the firm, as well as other incentive 
features in managers’ compensation structures (such as performance-related 
bonuses and performance- contingent promotions and dismissals), serves to align 
managerial incentives with shareholder interests.
(John and Qian, 2003, p. 109)
Several studies examine whether there is any empirical relationship between executive 
remuneration and bank conduct or performance, focusing especially on measures of the 
value of executive share options, or the ratio of share options to total executive compensa-
tion. Chen et al. (2006) find that a higher proportion of share options in total compensation 
is associated with increased risk-taking. Mehran and Rosenberg (2008) and DeYoung et al. 
(2013) find share options encourage CEOs to undertake riskier investments. Fahlenbrach 
and Stulz (2011) find that banks with CEO incentives more closely aligned with share-
holder interests typically performed poorly during the financial crisis of the late 2000s.
Cheng et al. (2009) investigate the relationship between compensation and risk-taking 
among financial institutions during the period 1992–2008. Payouts to top executives were 
positively related to risk. Balachandran et al. (2011) find equity-based compensation 
(in the form of stock options) increased the probability of default during the period 
1995–2008, while non-equity compensation (cash bonuses) reduced the default probabil-
ity. With reference to bank holding companies during the period 1993–2007, John et al. 
(2010) find the sensitivity of bank CEO compensation to financial performance decreases 
with leverage (the ratio of debt to equity). Further, this sensitivity increases with outside 
monitoring by subordinated debt holders and regulators.
A few studies examine the link between financial performance and executive turnover. 
Erkens et al. (2012) find CEOs of banks with boards comprising high proportions of 
independent directors and institutional investors are more likely to be replaced follow-
ing financial losses, than their counterparts in banks with boards dominated by insiders. 
Schaeck et al. (2012) examine the determinants of executive turnover in US banks. Execu-
tives of banks that are risky or have incurred losses are more likely to be dismissed, but 
dismissals often fail to deliver improved performance.

Business ethics
Business ethics can be defined as a philosophical analysis of moral issues seen 
from the perspective of companies and other forms of business organization 
(Brenkert and Beauchamp, 2010). It is a practical application of ethics in the

business domain. Some firms attempt to train their employees in ethical behav-
iour such as integrity and responsible practice. Ethics are not necessarily the same 
in different countries and cultures. Philosophers view ethics as having three com-
ponents: metaethics, normative ethics and applied ethics. Metaethics describes 
how ethical standards or moral behaviour come into existence, through indi-
vidual emotions and social interaction. Normative ethics defines moral standards 
that classify conduct as either good or bad, identify what constitutes duty, and 
examine the consequences of actions for other individuals and groups. Applied 
ethics concerns specific issues, such as war, abortion, euthanasia or the environ-
ment. It is clear that the application of ethics to business involves elements of 
both normative and applied ethics.
David Hume, Adam Smith and Milton Friedman
The foundations of business and corporate ethics are built on the ideas of several 
philosophers and economists. The eighteenth-century philosopher David Hume 
(1711–76) provides a useful starting point. Hume was primarily concerned with 
issues of justice. Justice is a set of rules that define and bind society together, and a 
virtue in its own right. Without the rules of justice, it is impossible to have the virtue 
of justice. The rules of justice define the stability of possession, its transference by 
consent, and the performance of promises. These rules provide the foundations for 
all social interaction, including commerce and business, making people better off 
than if acting as individuals. Society enables people to cooperate, achieving out-
comes that would be beyond their capabilities as individuals, through the division 
of labour. Society also allows people to develop formal and informal insurance 
arrangements, whereby the risks of individual misfortune are shared or pooled. 
The benefits of such a society rest on the rules of property, trade and contract, and 
the underpinnings of society are largely economic. Hume recognises, however, that 
self-interest may dissuade everyone from obeying all of these rules all of the time.
The potential contradiction between ethical behaviour and the pursuit of self-
interest is integral to the writings of Hume’s close contemporary, the economist 
and philosopher Adam Smith (1723–90) (see Box 1.1). Smith is most famously 
credited for introducing the notion of the ‘invisible hand’, whereby society is 
best served by the pursuit of self-interest by consumers and producers, and the 
absence of state coercion.
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker, 
that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We 
address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never 
talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.
(Smith, 1776, p. 19)
Prior to his contributions to economics, Smith (1759) discusses the idea that 
morality is largely based on the ability to sympathise with others and to garner 
social respectability. This can be achieved through benevolent actions aimed at 
various groups: first, family and other relatives; second, friends whom we respect 

144	
|	 6    ■    Corporate governance
and who may have helped us previously (a form of reciprocal altruism); and third, 
others on whom we bestow benevolence without any expectation of reciprocity. 
Through acts of kindness and compassion we earn respectability. Does this extend 
to business life? Although business people interact with others from outside their 
circle of benevolent concern, they do not do so soullessly, but instead they collab-
orate with each other (Bragues, 2009). This collaboration is obvious within a firm, 
but also extends to business relationships with suppliers and customers, fostering 
networks that may draw on the managers’ benevolence. According to Smith, 
individuals, and by extension business managers, have just one moral duty: to 
follow the system of natural liberty and to obey the rules of justice. Justice differs 
from benevolence, in that the latter is a choice for which individuals may receive 
plaudits or a loss of esteem. Justice, on the other hand, is a moral compunction 
as it is concerned with an avoidance of harm. Without benevolence markets can 
still function; but without justice, business is severely threatened.
By contrast, the University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman (1912–
2006) expresses the seminal case for the incompatibility of free-market economics 
with social responsibility.
When I hear businessmen speak eloquently about the ‘social 
responsibilities of business in a free-enterprise system . . . ’ [they] believe 
that they are defending free enterprise when they declaim that business 
is not concerned ‘merely’ with profit but also with promoting desirable 
‘social’ ends; that business has a ‘social conscience’ and takes seriously 
its responsibilities for providing employment, eliminating discrimination, 
avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the 
contemporary crop of reformers. . . . Businessmen who talk this way are 
unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining 
the basis of a free society these past decades.
(Friedman, 1970, p. 33)
To Friedman, the only moral responsibility within the law is the maximization 
of shareholder returns. In a personal capacity a manager might wish to pursue 
worthy causes, but in such cases he acts as a principal and not as an agent. Any 
money spent or effort exerted should be his own, and not the property of share-
holders or the effort the manager has been contracted to supply. For a manager 
to be socially responsible in his professional capacity as an agent would mean 
that he is acting to the detriment of the principal. Friedman argues further that 
‘socially responsible’ managers are no experts at how best to invest funds in ethi-
cal projects. Their expertise is limited to their function as corporate managers. 
From a different perspective, Baumol (1991) argues that firms in perfect com-
petition or in imperfect markets which, because of low entry barriers, are ‘con-
testable’ (see Section 12.5) suffer a loss of market share if they invest in socially 
responsible activities. Such actions are only possible when firms enjoy market 
power. Furthermore, some Marxist philosophers would agree with Friedman’s 
position that the linking of capitalist business and ethical behaviour is inherently 
contradictory (Shaw, 2009).

The ethics versus business objectives debate: further 
considerations
A resolution of the potential conflict between business and ethical objectives 
is proposed by several writers who examine the relationship between business 
objectives and concepts of duty and obligations to stakeholders and the wider 
society. For example, Frederiksen (2010) discusses the ethical basis for corporate 
behaviour. Four possible ethical approaches are egoism, libertarianism, utilitari-
anism and commonsense morality.
■ Moral egoists take actions that maximise the good for themselves. A firm 
should act in its own best interest, which would normally be understood 
as profit maximization. Socially responsible behaviour is not because the 
firm feels socially obligated to do so, but because such policies are in the 
firm’s self-interest. For example, it is in the firm’s self-interest to enter into 
some form of social contract that will guarantee the safety and success of the 
organization.
■ Libertarianism as a moral theory emphasises ‘negative’ rights such as free 
speech. People have an obligation not to impinge on the rights of others, 
by doing physical harm or preventing others from expressing their opinions. 
There is no duty, however, to act in a proactive way, such as giving support 
to the arts or charity.
■ Utilitarians argue that a moral action is one that attempts to determine the 
best outcome from an impartial point of view: the maximization of total util-
ity. Firms have a moral duty to implement policies that maximise overall 
happiness. Firms should not, for example, discriminate in favour of their 
own employees over others. In practice it may be difficult to identify which 
actions promote the greater good, or to define the relevant constituency of 
beneficiaries.
■ Commonsense morality, located somewhere between the extremes of liber-
tarianism and utilitarianism, accommodates both negative rights and posi-
tive duties. A firm has a moral obligation not to interfere with the rights of 
others, and a duty to help others proactively. Beneficiaries may be defined 
more narrowly than under a utilitarian approach, and perhaps limited to 
employees, shareholders, customers and the local community. Van de Ven 
(2005) questions whether some stakeholders’ appeal to ‘human rights’ can 
override the claim of corporate self-interest, as well as the claims of other 
stakeholders. Human rights are seen as universally valid, imposing universal 
moral obligations on firms. According to Van de Ven, the size of the stake-
holder constituency influences which groups should be prioritised. Those 
stakeholders with most influence over self-interest of the firm have the stron-
gest claim for priority.
Sen (1993) develops a critique of Smith’s arguments. The famous quota-
tion concerning the ‘benevolence of the butcher . . . ’ focuses on the motiva-
tion for the exchange of products, where there is no ethical dimension. Smith, 
however, would almost certainly consider certain issues that arise in production 

146	
|	 6    ■    Corporate governance
and distribution as subject to ethical concerns. If the producer, motivated by 
self-interest, attempts to defraud consumers and suppliers, then ethical issues 
do arise. Sen argues that self-interest is an insufficient condition for exchange 
to operate efficiently. What is needed is some form of institutional structure, 
which fosters implicit trust and mutual confidence in the ethics of all parties. 
Where there are no such institutions, or where they function inefficiently as in 
some developing countries, people are less likely to engage in market exchange 
transactions. In some cultures ‘motivational structures’ are very different from 
those that characterise the free market. In Japan, for example, a particular code 
of business ethics, influenced by the Samurai tradition and Confucianism, is 
prevalent. This differs greatly from the neoliberal promotion of self-interest as 
the foundation for a successful capitalist economy.
Contrary to Friedman’s view that managers are bound solely by their contrac-
tual obligations to shareholders, Kolstad (2007) points out that an agreement 
between two parties does not necessarily invalidate their responsibilities to other 
human beings. In addressing Friedman’s argument that the pursuit of goals 
other than profit maximization imposes a ‘tax’ on shareholders, ­Kolstad argues 
that the key question is not whether managers should redistribute wealth from 
shareholders to society, but whether shareholders should sacrifice some of their 
returns for socially desirable ends. Friedman’s view that managers become less 
efficient by focusing on activities beyond their core areas of expertise is deemed 
to be less than universally applicable: some firms do have the skills and capabil-
ity to marshal resources in the provision of social goods. The argument that by 
incurring additional costs the firm may jeopardise its own survival prospects 
does not find strong empirical support: few, if any, firms have been bankrupted 
solely by their commitment to social investments. Friedman’s position is also 
challenged by the widely held belief that good ethics are good for business. Firms 
may be rewarded when their managers make ethical decisions. For example, if 
employees, suppliers, customers and investors are treated well, then improved 
productivity, favourable contracts, customer loyalty and further investments 
may ensue. ‘Reputational capital’ leads to higher revenues or lower costs.
The argument that good ethics is good business has been criticised from a 
­philosophical and economic perspective (Burton and Goldsby, 2009). Any defi-
nition of ethical standards is conditioned by societal or cultural norms. For 
example, discrimination in an organization’s hiring policy might, in some cases, 
be viewed as permissible or morally neutral. If individuals differ in their interpre-
tations of the same actions, then the rewards to the organization may also differ. 
It would be contentious to assume that the general public rewards managers’ 
moral decisions with any precision. Disapproval of unethical behaviour may 
be stronger than approval of ethical behaviour. Unethical behaviour might be 
construed as those actions that lie below a ‘moral floor’, and some individuals 
might refrain from entering into business relations with managers who fall below 
this floor. Managers’ actions that lie on or above the floor may elicit different 
responses from different stakeholder groups. Some investors may punish manag-
ers who rise above the floor for their pursuit of ethical deeds, while others may 
reward such actions. Others may take a morally neutral view, and focus solely 
on the firm’s financial performance.

And still the revelations come. Leading banks pay yet more record fines for egregious 
behaviour ranging from sanctions-busting to facilitating tax evasion. Their involvement in 
rigging markets now extends beyond Libor, the rate at which banks lend to each other, to 
foreign exchange and the gold market. It appears to be a pervasive rather than occasional 
phenomenon. Even when they have been shopped, they do not give up. UK banks, we dis-
cover, have been underpaying compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance.
All this corporate wrongdoing is combined with immense personal enrichment and a 
paucity of prosecutions of people at the top. How are we to make sense of this bizarre 
concatenation of events, in which the financial system appears to have become an ethics-
free zone?
One fruitful way to look at it is to think of the financial system as having, at any given 
moment, a stock of moral capital. This complements an insight of economist John Ken-
neth Galbraith. In his book on the 1929 crash he argued that there is always an inventory 
of undiscovered embezzlement, which he called the ‘bezzle’ – in other words, negative 
moral capital. When markets ride high the bezzle increases. Come the recession people 
become more suspicious, audits become more penetrating and the bezzle shrinks.
Galbraith described a cyclical phenomenon. Yet events since the latest financial crisis 
suggest that there is also a structural component to changes in the moral capital stock. In 
the corporate sector, and especially in banking, there has been an adverse step change in 
ethical values. One reason is the ineptly named ‘shareholder value revolution’, whereby a 
paternalistic corporate capitalism was replaced by a capital market pressure cooker in which 
senior executives were required to deliver progressive rises in short-term earnings. A second 
change was the move to performance-related pay and incentives tied to equity values.
In banking this bred a more transactional culture in which profits and personal rewards 
came increasingly from gaming the system. The globalisation of capital flows in the absence 
of an international regulator provided banks with ample opportunity for regulatory arbi-
trage, whereby questionable business could always be diverted to weaker jurisdictions.
At domestic level banks have shaped their business to minimise regulatory capital 
requirements. The great boom in securitised mortgages – the focal point of systemic risk 
and fraud in the crisis – reflected the lower capital requirements on mortgage-backed 
securities relative to those on conventional mortgage lending. At a personal level bonuses 
took precedence over virtually everything, including the customer.
As long as incentives are at odds with ethical requirements, common decency will be a 
minority pursuit. Scandals are inevitable. And as the gap between bankers’ pay and that 
of executives outside the financial system grows ever wider, business leaders lose moral 
authority, and the case for enlightened capitalism is devalued. There are honest people 
in banking. But it has become a less comfortable place for those with a strong moral

conscience. If the fines are big enough to do material damage, the resulting hit to bank 
capital may be a systemic trigger.
If this notion of a secular depletion in the moral capital stock in finance is right, 
attempts to instil ethics by refining incentives – however necessary and well meaning – will 
not be enough. In a mature industry in which the return on assets has been stagnant for 
years and higher equity returns have been achieved only through leverage and excessive 
risk-taking, heavy reliance on bonuses and equity-related rewards is an absurdity. Any 
significant rebuilding of the moral capital stock will have to come largely as the byproduct 
of structural change to make banking more like a utility.
Equally necessary is a retreat from the obsession with punishing corporations rather 
than senior executives. The supposed justification is that companies can be made to trans-
form their culture and prevent future crimes. Much window-dressing results. Slapping 
huge fines on banks is potentially a more dangerous game. If the fines are big enough to 
do material damage, the resulting hit to bank capital may be a systemic trigger. Many 
innocent shareholders and employees will be the victims. If the fines are immaterial, they 
are pointless.
Jed Rakoff, the US district judge, argues that going after the company is technically 
suspect because you should not indict a company unless you can prove that some mana-
gerial agent of the company committed the alleged crime; and if you can prove that, why 
not indict the manager? He also sees it as morally suspect because punishing innocent 
employees and shareholders for crimes committed by unprosecuted individuals seems 
contrary to elementary notions of moral responsibility.
Modestly refining the carrots and using the wrong sticks is a poor formula for rebuild-
ing the moral capital stock. There has to be a more radical way.

Corporate social responsibility
By adopting a corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy, a firm embraces a 
range of economic, social and environmental responsibilities over and above its 
duty to shareholders to maximise profit or shareholder value. The firm also mon-
itors its own compliance with ethical standards, on matters such as fairness and 
justice. Much of the discussion of CSR refers to stakeholder theory (­Freeman, 
1984; Freeman et al., 2004). The broadest stakeholder definition includes any 
group that has the capability to influence or exert pressure on the firm’s man-
agement. The implementation of a CSR policy requires management to strike 
a balance between its responsibilities towards non-investing stakeholders, and 
its agency duties to shareholders. The stakeholder theory has been criticised by

Orts and Strudler (2009), who claim that the connection between the theory and 
ethical considerations is weak. The main practical application of stakeholder 
theory is to identify groups that have an interest in the organization. Precise 
identification of who qualifies as a stakeholder is ambiguous. Even if the rel-
evant stakeholders can be identified, the theory offers little guidance on how 
to balance their interests. How, for example, does a firm balance the needs of 
a shareholder’s investment to provide a pension with the needs of a low-paid 
employee to feed their children?
Several forces have shaped the growth of the CSR movement since the 1980s 
(Azer, 2002). Growing affluence has heightened interest and awareness of ethical 
issues: poor societies are less likely to penalise businesses for unethical behaviour. 
Globalization and improvements in communications technology have increased 
the speed of dissemination of information concerning ethical misconduct around 
the globe. Groups of consumers, employees, community activists and sharehold-
ers have discovered that challenging the corporate status quo can often deliver 
change. A firm’s reputation is built, in part, on the foundation of stakeholder 
views and the firm’s responses to their concerns. CSR has increased in impor-
tance as governments have reduced their role in the regulation of business by 
liberalizing markets and trade. This trend has resulted in some loss of public 
accountability, creating impetus for pressure groups to bypass government and 
engage directly with firms. Equally, firms are less likely to rely entirely on gov-
ernment codes of practice, and more likely to develop their own CSR policies. 
A demand for greater accountability throughout the supply chain has led to 
firms being held increasingly accountable for their suppliers’ practices on issues 
such as child employment, payment of low wages or operation in countries with 
corrupt governments. The ethical investment movement, especially in Europe, 
has strengthened scrutiny of firms’ ethical standards and behaviour. Finally, the 
growth of the CSR movement reflects, in part, an increased public awareness and 
concern over environmental issues.
More specifically, a sequence of high-profile cases of corporate misconduct 
with devastating environmental consequences has served as a focus of atten-
tion for pressure groups, the media, households and governments. In December 
1984, a leakage of poisonous gases from the Union Carbide pesticide plant in 
Bhopal, India, resulted in 3,787 deaths among the population in the immedi-
ate vicinity of the plant, according to official figures released by the Madhya 
Pradesh state government. The total number of deaths since 1984 that were 
related to the incident exceeds 10,000 according to some estimates, and between 
100,000 and 200,000 people are believed to have suffered permanent injury. 
In the aftermath, numerous deficiencies were uncovered in the firm’s manage-
ment and operational procedures, including poor working conditions, inad-
equate training, poor maintenance of equipment, inadequate safety policies, 
inadequate emergency procedures and processing of dangerous chemicals in a 
densely populated area.
In March 1989, a spillage of crude oil from the Exxon-Valdez oil tanker off 
the coastline of Alaska resulted in a spillage of between 11 million and 32 million 

150	
|	 6    ■    Corporate governance
gallons of crude oil, contaminating a stretch of coastline and ocean that was a 
prolific habitat for marine wildlife. Exxon was adjudged responsible for pro-
viding insufficient supervision and rest periods for the captain and crew, and 
for failings in the maintenance of a radar system that could have averted the 
disaster. Exxon-Valdez was the largest oil spillage in US waters until the Deep-
water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which continued for three months 
between April and July 2010 following an explosion at a BP oil rig that killed 
11 employees and injured 17 others. Over 200 million gallons of crude oil were 
released into the ocean, with devastating consequences for marine habitats and 
the local fishing and tourism industries. Once again, a catalogue of manage-
ment failures on the part of BP and its contractors Halliburton and Transocean 
were found to have contributed to the disaster. These included the prioritization 
of cost-cutting measures over health and safety, technical failure in the testing 
of equipment, inadequate risk management policy, and inadequate safety and 
emergency procedures.
One of the most influential early contributions to the academic literature on 
CSR was provided by Carroll (1979), who classifies the constituents of a CSR 
policy into a four-level pyramid: economic, legal, ethical and discretionary or 
philanthropic responsibilities.
■ The lowest level is the firm’s economic responsibility in meeting the needs of its 
customers. Everything else is predicated on the firm’s success in fulfilling this 
basic responsibility. Aspects of economic responsibility include the maximiza-
tion of the value of the firm, the development and maintenance of competitive 
advantage, and efficiency.
■ The second level is the responsibility for compliance with the law of the coun-
tries in which the firm operates. The law reflects society’s ethical view as to the 
minimum standards of behaviour expected of firms and other organizations, as 
well as efforts to ensure fair competition or a ‘level playing field’ in the market.
■ The third level is the ethical responsibility, over and above a strict interpreta-
tion of economic and legal responsibilities, to act in a manner that is consid-
ered fair by society, even though not codified in law. The firm’s treatment of 
shareholders, employees, suppliers and customers is scrutinised with reference 
to society’s ethical norms as to what constitutes moral behaviour.
■ The highest level is the philanthropic responsibility that defines the firm as 
a good ‘corporate citizen’, covering discretionary acts and behaviour that 
actively promote society’s well-being. Philanthropic responsibilities extend 
beyond society’s expectations regarding ethical behaviour. Whether activities 
such as charitable donation and sponsorship of artistic events are truly altru-
istic, or motivated by the prospect of an economic return by strengthening the 
firm’s brand, is often ambiguous.
Having identified the various levels at which a CSR policy may operate, Carroll 
emphasises the practical importance for management of identifying the issues 
for which a social responsibility existed, and of articulating a specific strategy 
for responding to these issues. Four generic motives for the adoption of a CSR 
policy that are widely cited in the literature are moral obligation, sustainability, 

	
	
	
6.7  Corporate social responsibility	 |	
151
licence to operate and reputation. Moral obligation concerns the need for firms 
to be ‘good citizens’, and follow moral imperatives. Many moral decisions are 
straightforward and pose no conflicts of interest, such as the filing of correct 
tax returns. Some decisions, however, involve conflicts that, in the absence of a 
‘moral calculus’, are difficult to resolve. Sustainability refers to actions in pursuit 
of long-term economic, social and environmental objectives, rather than short-
term goals. Licence to operate refers to a more pragmatic approach to CSR, 
whereby firms attempt to avoid interference in their affairs from regulators or 
governments, by taking voluntary steps that pre-empt intervention in areas such 
as health and safety, environmental protection or equal opportunities. Finally, 
reputation covers actions that aim to placate third parties in ‘stigmatised’ indus-
tries such as petrochemicals. Such actions provide insurance against possible 
disasters, but it is difficult to measure accurately the benefit to the firm. Porter 
and Kramer (2006) suggest, however, that the four generic motives are framed at 
a level that is too general to provide guidance for action in specific cases.
In what ways might the adoption of a CSR policy be value-enhancing for 
the firm, rather than detrimental to the narrowly focused corporate objective of 
shareholder value maximization? Kurucz et al. (2008) identify four aspects of the 
business case for CSR: cost and risk reduction; competitive advantage; reputa-
tion and legitimacy; and synergistic value creation.
■ A firm might invest in CSR as a means of reducing costs or risk, thereby 
enhancing its economic value. According to Friedman (1970), spending on 
CSR dilutes the firm’s ability to work in the best interests of shareholders. If 
the firm earns more than a normal profit, there might be a trade-off between 
the maximization of shareholder value, and the direction of some resources 
towards CSR. By contrast, an ‘enlightened value maximization’ hypothesis 
suggests that the demands of all stakeholders need to be managed so as to 
reduce the risk of conflict, so investment in CSR is not necessarily incompatible 
with shareholder value maximization.
■ Investment in CSR for competitive advantage involves viewing stakeholder 
demands for socially responsible policies less as a constraint and more as a 
positive opportunity for the firm to create value by orienting and directing 
resources towards the perceived demands of stakeholders.
■ Investment in CSR might increase shareholder value by improving the firm’s 
reputation and legitimacy. This is achieved by aligning the interests of stake-
holders with those of the firm by incorporating a commitment to social invest-
ment into the marketing strategy.
■ Synergistic value creation through CSR refers to a deliberately created market 
where the interests of stakeholders are aligned by developing new percep-
tions of value. The linking of communities, social networks and organizational 
stakeholders with new thinking and new paradigms can lead to a united con-
cept of what is valuable. Once achieved, a virtuous circle is created leading to 
further CSR investment.
According to Aguilera and Jackson (2003), institutional theory is better 
than agency theory in explaining national differences in corporate governance. 

152	
|	 6    ■    Corporate governance
Institutions are characterised by norms, incentives, rules, stability and patterns 
of behaviour. Agency theory fails to recognise cross-national differences between 
stakeholders and their interests. By contrast, institutional theory considers the 
motives of managers and stakeholders in determining governance arrange-
ments, which should be analysed within different national, cultural and institu-
tional contexts. Different national approaches to CSR depend on institutional 
arrangements. Some commentators have identified differences between the typi-
cal approaches towards CSR of US and European firms. For example, Matten 
and Moon (2008) characterise the US approach as explicit, and the European 
approach as implicit. Firms that adopt an explicit approach view CSR as delib-
erate, voluntary and strategic, and use CSR terminology to communicate their 
policies to stakeholders. Firms that adopt an implicit approach view CSR as 
an involuntary policy that adjusts to prevailing societal norms, and tend not to 
communicate their policies using CSR terminology explicitly.
The volume of empirical research into the relationship between CSR and 
financial performance has grown explosively in recent years. On the EBSCO 
database there are 135 references to CSR between 1945 and 1980, 122 between 
1981 and 1990, 232 between 1991 and 2000, and 5,463 between 2001 and 2010. 
Research in this field faces the challenge of devising a meaningful metric for 
CSR (Turker, 2009). The Kinder, Lydenberg and Domini (KLD) database scores 
3,000 US firms on a range of criteria including community relations, employee 
relations, treatment of women, treatment of minorities, and military contracts. 
Other databases include the FTSE4Good, covering 1,000 European firms; and 
SIRIS covering 300 firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. A drawback 
of this approach is that the choice of criteria may lack objectivity, and may be 
relevant for a particular country or region only. An alternative approach is to 
focus on single-issue indicators such as pollution control or treatment of women. 
One interesting approach is suggested by Dowling (2014), that the degree of 
corporation tax avoidance can be used as a measure of CSR. He argues that a 
reason for pushing government as stakeholder to the background is that scholars 
mainly focus on investors, employees and customers. Some studies use textual 
analysis to examine the CSR content in a firm’s publications. A difficulty is that 
the CSR content in a firm’s publications might not accurately reflect the reality 
of CSR activity. Another approach is to investigate the perceptions of individuals 
to a firm’s CSR policies. Several studies adopt Carroll’s (1979, 1991) four-level 
pyramid as a framework. Difficulties may arise, however, from a tendency for 
questionnaires with limited choices to impose the investigator’s preconceptions 
on an individual’s responses.
Chih et al. (2010) investigate the conditions under which a corporation is 
likely to behave in a socially responsible manner, with reference to financial per-
formance, competition, state regulation, private regulation, existence of power 
groups, business education, trade associations and employee relations. Testable 
hypotheses include the following. First, financially weak firms are less likely to 
adopt responsible policies. Second, where competition is intense, firms may seek 
to reduce costs by acting in a socially irresponsible manner, within or even out-
side the law. Where competition is weak and profit margins are high, firms may 
seek to enhance their reputations by adopting responsible policies. A monopolist

153
facing little or no competitive threat might not be fearful of a loss of reputation, 
and there might be limited incentive to behave responsibly. Chih et al. examine 
a sample of 520 financial firms from 34 countries between 2002 and 2005, drawn 
from the Compustat Global Vantage database. Firm size is used to control for 
any tendency for larger firms to be subject to greater scrutiny than smaller ones. 
Macroeconomic controls include the inflation rate, and indices of industrial 
production and consumer confidence. There is support for the hypothesis of a 
positive relationship between financial performance and social responsibility. 
Large firms are more likely to implement CSR policies. However, Bauman-Pauly 
et al. (2013), when examining Swiss MNEs and SMEs, found that smaller firms 
possess better organizational characteristics with regard to CSR strategies than 
the larger ones. Finally, Chih et al. found that there is also some support for the 
proposition that firms are less likely to invest resources in socially responsible 
projects if there is either too much or too little competition.
Dowell et al. (1999) use a sample of MNEs in manufacturing and mining, 
drawn from the Investor Responsibility Research Centre’s corporate environ-
mental profiles, to examine whether shareholder value is linked to environmental 
policy. There is no support for the notion that the adoption of global environ-
mental standards depresses shareholder value. King and Lennox (2001) find evi-
dence of a negative relationship between TRI (Toxic Release Inventory) emissions 
and shareholder value, for 652 firms in 1997 and 1998. Brammer and Millington 
(2005) examine factors that encourage charitable donations, as well as the size of 
donations. For 550 firms quoted on the London Stock Exchange in 1999, firm size 
and advertising intensity positively influence the probability of making donations, 
whilst strict governance and managers’ remuneration have a negative association. 
The size of donations is positively related to R&D expenditure, managers’ remu-
neration and profitability, and negatively related to the firm’s debt.
For a range of CSR policies implemented by a sample of firms drawn from 
the KLD database, Bird et al. (2007) attempt to identify policies with a negative 
impact on financial performance, and those with a positive impact that do not 
conflict with the objective of shareholder value maximization. CSR policies in 
the areas of employee relations, diversity, community, environment and product 
are examined. Employee relations covers policies such as profit-sharing schemes, 
pensions and health and safety; diversity refers to the firm’s activities in recruiting 
minorities; community refers to discretionary actions such as charitable dona-
tion; environment refers to pollution control and recycling; and product refers 
to the production of high-quality goods, and innovation. The empirical analysis 
reveals few policies that produce conflicts between the interests of shareholders 
and other stakeholders; it is suggested, however, that the stock market punishes 
firms that spend above legally required environmental standards.
Simpson and Kohers (2002) analyse the Community Reinvestment Act rat-
ings of 385 US banks for the period 1993–4. A higher rating is associated with 
higher profitability and lower loan losses. Scholtens and Dam (2007) examine 
whether the adoption by banks of a set of principles for managing environmental 
and social risk in project finance transactions, known as the Equator principles, 
had any immediate effect on the share prices of the banks concerned. There is 
no evidence of any significant effect. Shen and Chang (2012) find no relationship 

154	
|	 6    ■    Corporate governance
between the adoption of CSR policies and financial performance for Taiwanese 
banks during the period 2002–6.
The results from much of the empirical research into the relationship between 
CSR and financial performance are varied, and sometimes contradictory. A key 
methodological issue concerns the correct identification of the direction of cau-
sation. It seems just as plausible to argue that it is the most successful firms that 
can afford to adopt socially responsible policies, as it is to argue that firms reap 
financial rewards from being socially responsible. For example, better industrial 
relations may not necessarily lead to greater shareholder value; rather, profitable 
firms can afford to reward their employees in a way that reduces the likelihood of 
industrial conflict. Any observed relationship between the adoption of CSR poli-
cies and financial performance may simply reflect the quality of the firm’s man-
agement, which impacts upon both. In the empirical literature, conflicting results 
and weak relationships derive partly from definitional and measurement issues. 
In 95 CSR studies reviewed by Vogel (2005), financial performance was measured 
in 70 different ways using 27 different data sources. KLD, the most popular CSR 
database (see above), includes measures of community relations, industrial rela-
tions, environment, diversity and product safety; but the weightings attached to 
different variables are undisclosed and probably subjective. Studies that examine 
narrower aspects of CSR may have greater focus and clarity, but the results are 
not directly comparable with those of other studies that adopt a different focus.
Finally, in recognition of the importance of consumer attitudes to socially 
responsible behaviour on the part of business, some research examines directly 
the impact of CSR policies on consumer purchasing decisions. For example, 
Öberseder et al. (2011) use interviews to examine how consumers respond to 
CSR initiatives. The key factor in determining consumer purchasing decisions 
is price, and a perception that ethical goods are more expensive might have a 
negative impact. Smith et al. (2010) investigate consumers’ knowledge of CSR, 
and the extent to which they act on this knowledge. Awareness of a firm’s 
CSR policies influences the perception of the firm in its other activities through 
‘halo effects’. For example, consumers aware of a firm’s environmentally friendly 
policy might assume the firm also supports diversity and local communities. Halo 
effects might be used strategically to make unsubstantiated claims about the ben-
eficial social attributes of unrelated products. The term greenwashing describes 
the misleading promotion of ethical or environmental actions. In the 1980s the 
American environmentalist Jay Westervelt characterised the practice on the part 
of some hotels of asking customers to reuse their towels, while doing nothing else 
to promote recycling, as a cynical ploy to economise on laundry bills. Another 
example is the decision of McDonald’s to alter the theme colour of its European 
outlets from the traditional red and yellow to green.
Now that the interiors of most restaurants have been modernized and 
redesigned, it’s time to take on the exteriors, with green instead of red. 
The colour was chosen because it invokes respect for the environment.
(Holger Beek, vice-president of McDonald’s German operation, 
quoted in Deutsche Welle, 2009)

Case study 6.3
Opportunist shareholders must embrace 
commitment
FT
Limited-liability, privately owned joint-stock companies are the core institutions of mod-
ern capitalism. These entities are largely responsible for organising the production and 
distribution of goods and services across the globe. Their role is both cause and conse-
quence of the revolution in the scale and diversity of economic activity that has taken 
place over the past two centuries.
Almost nothing in economics is more important than thinking through how companies 
should be managed and for what ends. Unfortunately, we have made a mess of this. That 
mess has a name: it is ‘shareholder value maximization’. Operating companies in line with 
this belief not only leads to misbehaviour but may also militate against their true social 
aim, which is to generate greater prosperity.
I am not the first person to worry about the joint-stock company. Adam Smith, founder 
of modern economics, argued: ‘Negligence and profusion . . . must always prevail, more or 
less, in the management of the affairs of such a company.’ His concern is over what we call 
the ‘agency problem’ – the difficulty of monitoring management. Others complain that 
companies behave like psychopaths: a company aiming at maximising shareholder value 
might conclude it would be profitable – and so perhaps even its duty – to pollute the air 
and water if allowed to do so. It might also use its resources to obstruct an appropriate 
regulatory response to such (mis)behaviour.
The economic argument for shareholder value maximization and control is that, while 
all other stakeholders are protected by contract, shareholders are not. They therefore 
bear the residual risk. This being so, they need to control the company in order to align 
the interests of management with their own. Only then would they be prepared to make 
risky investments.
Yet, while shareholders do indeed bear risks in their role as the insurers of solvency, 
they are not the only stakeholders to do so. A host of others are also exposed to risks 
against which they cannot be fully protected by contract: long-term workers; long-
term suppliers; and, not least, the jurisdictions in which companies operate. Moreover, 
shareholders, unlike others and particularly employees, can hedge their risks by diver-
sifying their portfolios. A worker cannot normally work for many companies at the 
same time and nobody can hedge employee income by owning shares in other people, 
except via taxation.
The doctrine of shareholder value maximization has allowed us to believe that the exis-
tence of these long-lived, hierarchical and powerful entities has not changed the market 
economy fundamentally. But, as Colin Mayer of Oxford’s Saïd Business School argues in 
his splendid book, Firm Commitment, this approach also misses the true purpose of the 
company. A company whose goal is whatever seems profitable today can be trusted only 
to renege on implicit contracts. It is sure to act opportunistically.

156	
|	 6    ■    Corporate governance
Companies, argues Professor Mayer, are a mechanism for sustaining long-term com-
mitments. But such commitments will only work if it is costly for the parties to act oppor-
tunistically. Moreover, it is often in the interests of all parties to bind themselves not to 
behave in such a way. But, with an active market in corporate control, such commitments 
cannot be made. Those who make the promises may disappear before they can deliver.
These commitments take the form of implicit – or not fully specified – contracts. Why 
do we have to rely on implicit contracts? Long-term commitments could in theory be 
managed instead by trying to specify every eventuality. About a second’s thought makes 
it clear that this is impossible. It would not just be inconceivably complex and costly. It 
would come up against the deeper problem of uncertainty. We have little idea of what 
might happen in the next few months, let alone the next few decades. If people are to 
make long-term commitments, trust is the only alternative. But a company whose goal 
is whatever seems profitable today can be trusted only to renege on implicit contracts. 
It is sure to act opportunistically. If its managers did not want to do so, they would be 
replaced. This is because, as Prof Mayer argues: ‘The corporation is a rent extraction 
vehicle for the shortest-term shareholders.’ Aligning managerial rewards to shareholder 
returns reinforces the opportunism.
In practice, many capitalist economies do mitigate the risks of shareholder value maxi-
mization and the market in corporate control. This is true of continental Europe, notably 
German companies. But it is also, notes Prof Mayer, true in the US, where the idea that 
management should be protected against shareholders is widely accepted in practice, if 
not so much in theory. The country that has taken the idea furthest is the UK.
Prof Mayer argues rightly: ‘The defect of existing economic models of the corporation is 
in not recognising its distinguishing feature – the fact that it is a separate legal entity. The 
significance of this stems from the fact that it is thereby capable of sustaining arrange-
ments that are distinct from those that its owners, its shareholders, are able to achieve.’ 
It is, in other words, in the shareholders’ interests not to control companies completely. 
They need to be able to tie their hands.
Prof Mayer’s suggested solution is what he calls a ‘trust company’, one with explicit 
values and a board designed to oversee them. He justifies such a radical switch with his 
scepticism about the feasibility and effectiveness of regulation. Less radical would be to 
encourage companies to consider divergent structures of control. One might be to vest 
voting rights in shares whose ownership can be transferred only after a holding period 
of years, not hours. In that way, control would be married to commitment. One could 
also vest limited control rights in some groups of workers. Yet this is not to argue that 
committed long-term ownership is always preferable. Family control, for example, has 
both weaknesses and strengths.
The right way to approach governance is to recognise the big trade-offs in managing 
and governing these complex, vital and long-lived institutions. We should let 100 gov-
ernance flowers bloom. But the canonical academic model of the past few decades will 
rarely be the best.

Summary
Corporate governance describes the arrangements put in place to ensure that a 
firm operates in accordance with the objectives of its own stakeholders, together 
with the mechanisms that deal with conflicts of interest between various stake-
holder groups. Agency theory is central to any discussion of corporate gover-
nance issues. The separation within the firm of ownership from control creates 
an agency problem and a potential conflict of interest between the firm’s share-
holders acting as principal, and its management acting as agent. In a world of 
imperfect or asymmetric information, management cannot always be relied upon 
to act in the shareholders’ best interests, and shareholders might not always be 
able to monitor management’s actions effectively. Another crucial issue in the 
design of corporate governance mechanisms concerns whether the maximization 
of shareholder value should be the firm’s sole legitimate objective, or whether the 
firm recognises a wider set of responsibilities towards a broader constituency of 
stakeholders, including some or all of employees, customers, suppliers, retailers, 
taxpayers and society in general.
Corporate governance comprises a number of instruments or mechanisms 
that mitigate the various conflicts of interest that may arise between stake-
holder groups.
■ Boards of directors. A one-tier board comprises both executive and non-­
executive directors. Chairman–CEO duality, where the CEO is also the chair-
man of the board, is practised by some firms that operate a one-tier structure, 
but is not recommended in official corporate governance codes of conduct. A 
two-tier structure comprises a supervisory (non-executive) board and a man-
agement (executive board).
■ Shareholders. It is unclear whether institutional share ownership creates a 
more or a less effective monitoring regime. In recent years, mobilization of 
small shareholders to use their voting rights to sanction poorly performing 
management has been advocated as a tool for improving corporate gover-
nance. Firms with widely dispersed share ownership might find that no single 
shareholder perceives sufficient incentive to devote effort to monitoring. On 
the other hand, large shareholders might be tempted to intervene excessively.
■ Dividend policy and debt finance. By paying dividends, managers reduce the 
resources available to fund their own discretionary behaviour. Similarly, a 
high ratio of debt to equity finance imposes constraints on managerial discre-
tion, owing to the legal obligation to pay interest on the debt.
■ Executive compensation and share ownership. The design and structure of 
executive compensation packages is a key determinant of the alignment or 
misalignment of the incentives of top managers with shareholder interests. 
Relevant constituents of executive compensation packages include cash 
bonuses related to financial performance, share ownership and call options.
■ The market for corporate control. The share price of an underperforming com-
pany is likely to fall, leaving the firm vulnerable to hostile takeover by new

owners who expect to be able put the firm’s assets into more productive use, 
and are likely to replace the firm’s existing management. This threat acts as a 
disciplining device.
■ Competition in the market for products or services may also impose limits on the 
scope for discretionary behaviour on the part of management.
The OECD’s Principles of Corporate Governance have become internation-
ally accepted as a benchmark for good corporate governance. The Principles 
specify provisions for the promotion of transparent and efficient markets and 
compliance with the rule of law, protection of the rights and equitable treat-
ment of shareholders, protection of the rights of other stakeholders, timely and 
accurate disclosure and transparency, and detail the responsibilities of the board 
of directors. In the UK, the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) (2010) Cor-
porate Governance Code identifies five main principles for good governance: 
leadership, effectiveness, accountability, remuneration and relations with 
shareholders.
Public awareness of corporate governance issues attained new heights fol-
lowing several high-profile scandals associated with corporate bankruptcies in 
the early 2000s, including Enron in 2001 and WorldCom in 2002. In the US 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 aimed to strengthen corporate governance in 
several key respects. Shortcomings in procedures for the management of risk, 
and executive compensation packages that were excessive or created perverse 
incentives, are widely cited among the causes of the financial crisis of 2007–9. 
This suggests that the development of robust systems for corporate governance 
remains work-in-progress in the aftermath of the crisis.
Business ethics is defined as a philosophical analysis of moral issues from the 
perspective of companies and other forms of business organization. David Hume 
and Adam Smith, key thinkers in eighteenth-century philosophy and econom-
ics, provide key insights concerning the application of the concepts of ethics and 
justice to corporate behaviour. This historical discussion is contrasted with the 
views of Milton Friedman on the primacy of shareholder value maximization 
as the sole legitimate corporate objective. A resolution of the potential conflict 
between business and ethical objectives is proposed by several writers who exam-
ine the relationship between business objectives and concepts of duty and obliga-
tions to stakeholders and the wider society.
Adopting a broad stakeholder definition that encompasses societal interests in 
the activities of privately owned firms, public awareness of the social responsibili-
ties of firms has grown dramatically, leading to the adoption by many compa-
nies of explicit corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies. Carroll provides a 
widely recognised typology of the constituents of a CSR policy, encompassing 
the firm’s economic, legal, ethical and discretionary/philanthropic responsibili-
ties. Forces that have shaped the emergence of the CSR movement include a 
greater willingness on the part of consumers, employees, community activists 
and shareholders to challenge the corporate status quo, and a simultaneous 
retreat of governments from their role in the regulation of business. Academic 
research into the relationship between the adoption of CSR policies and financial 
performance has proliferated as the CSR movement has gathered momentum.

Empirical research in this field has produced mixed findings, which partly reflect 
confusion over definitional and measurement issues, and difficulties in disentan-
gling the direction of causality between a firm’s financial performance and its 
adoption of socially responsible policies.

Introduction
Oligopoly theory rests on recognition of the importance of the number of firms 
in the industry, and the nature of the product. These two characteristics are 
closely related. An industry is defined by the nature of the product it supplies. 
Firms producing highly differentiated products may not even see themselves as 
being in direct competition with others. The more similar or homogeneous the 
products of different firms, however, the greater the awareness of competitors. 
In all oligopolistic markets, a few sellers account for a substantial proportion 
of total sales. The fewness of the firms is the chief identifying characteristic of 
an oligopoly.
As a result of the fewness of firms within a clearly defined industry, produc-
ing a similar product or service, the central problem of oligopoly focuses on the 
recognition of the firms’ mutual dependence or interdependence. Interdependence 
means a firm is aware that its own actions affect the actions of its rivals and vice 
versa. Profit maximization and survival in an oligopoly depend on how effec-
tively each firm operates in this situation of interdependence.
This chapter begins in Section 7.2 with a general discussion of the key issues 
of interdependence, conjectural variation, independent action and collusion in 
oligopoly. Subsequently, the structure of the chapter reflects the development 
of theories of independent action in oligopoly, as they have tackled the cen-
tral issue of interdependence. Section 7.3 examines Cournot’s original model 
of output determination in a duopoly, based on a simple assumption that two 
firms take their output decisions sequentially, each in the expectation that its 
rival will not subsequently react. Other models that recognise the importance 
of interdependence include Chamberlin’s model of joint profit maximization, in 
which ‘mutual dependence was recognised’. Although this recognition involved 
some broad theorizing, the process was invaluable in the sense that it asked the 
right questions concerning short- and long-run reactions, time-lags, imperfect 
knowledge, irrational conduct and so on. Stackelberg’s leader–follower model 
builds in an assumption that one firm learns to anticipate its rivals’ reactions 
to its own decisions, and exploits this foresight to increase its own profit at its 
rivals’ expense.
The Cournot, Chamberlin and Stackelberg models focus mainly on the firms’ 
output decisions in duopoly or oligopoly. Section 7.4 examines the complemen-
tary models developed by Bertrand and Edgeworth, which focus on price-setting. 
The Bertrand model provides a theoretical justification for the idea that intense 
price competition might occur in markets with few firms producing a similar or 
identical product. The Edgeworth model focuses on the possibility that oligopo-
listic markets might be permanently unstable, with no long-run equilibrium price 
or output level ever being achieved.
Another attempt to introduce a greater degree of reality into oligopoly theory 
is Sweezy’s kinked demand curve model, examined in Section 7.5. Although chal-
lenged on empirical grounds, this model rests on the core assumption that firms’ 
behaviour is determined by expectations as to what actions rivals are most likely 
to take. In this respect, it represents a major contribution to the development

of more realistic models of oligopoly. This section also considers models of price 
leadership in oligopoly, in which one firm takes decisions on price and the others 
simply follow the lead of the price-setting firm.
	
7.2	
Interdependence, conjectural variation, independent 
action and collusion
At the beginning of the twentieth century, classical microeconomic analy-
sis focused on the models of perfect competition and pure monopoly in its 
attempt to describe the behaviour of firms. While no one pretended what was 
being presented was an exact copy of real business behaviour, it was felt the 
two extremes sufficiently defined a spectrum on which reality could be con-
veniently located. It almost seemed what was being argued was that defining 
the colours white and black would somehow enable other colours, such as 
yellow and purple, to be described simply by mixing white and black together 
in the correct proportions. It soon became apparent, however, that these two 
models were unable to explain many aspects of business conduct in the real 
world, such as product differentiation, advertising, price wars, parallel pricing 
and collusion. An additional theory was required to deal with the vast area of 
industry structure that lies between the two polar cases of perfect competition 
and monopoly. This middle ground, known as imperfect competition, can be 
subdivided into two: monopolistic competition, occupying the analytical space 
closest to perfect competition; and ­oligopoly, taking up the remaining large 
portion of the spectrum.
Interdependence provides the main challenge for the analysis of oligopoly. 
Each firm’s behaviour depends on its assumptions about its rivals’ likely 
reactions.
‘I’ (an oligopolist) cannot define my best policies unless I know what 
‘You’ (my rival) are going to do; by the same token, however, you cannot 
define your best move unless you know what I will do.
(Asch, 1969, p. 54)
Faced with this situation of interdependence, the firms must make some guesses 
or conjectures as to the likely actions of rivals. Each firm must determine its 
price or output, while making assumptions about its rivals’ likely reactions 
to its own actions. The term conjectural variation refers to the assumptions 
a firm makes about the reactions it expects from its rivals in response to its 
own actions.
It is sometimes suggested that the solution to the oligopoly problem is one 
of two extremes: either pure independent action or pure collusion. Under pure 
independent action, each firm reaches a unilateral decision on a course of action, 
without any prior contact with its rivals. Under collusion, two or more rival 
firms recognise their interdependence, creating the potential for bargaining to 
take place with a view to formulating some plan of joint action. In some ways, 

166	
|	 7    ■    Oligopoly: non-collusive models
however, the dichotomy between pure independent action and pure collusion is 
artificial. Independent action could produce outcomes similar to those achieved 
through collusion, if the firms were subsequently to revise their initial deci-
sions in the light of their rivals’ reactions. Furthermore, collusion could take the 
form of a careful sequence of recognised moves and countermoves, in which the 
firms effectively reveal their own positions and react to their rivals’ positions, 
without entering into any explicit discussions or negotiations. In reality, both 
independent action and collusion are usually a matter of degree. While examples 
may be found that conform to these two polar cases, most cases fall somewhere 
between the two extremes. Nevertheless, despite this ambiguity, the structure 
of Chapters 7, 8 and 9 of this book adheres to the dichotomy between indepen-
dent action and collusion. The remaining sections of Chapter 7 discuss theories 
of oligopoly that focus primarily on independent decision-making. Chapter 8 
examines theories of collusion. Chapter 9 provides an analysis of these issues 
with a game theoretic framework.
	
7.3	
Models of output determination in duopoly
Cournot’s duopoly model
Cournot’s (1838) model of output determination in oligopoly was the first suc-
cessful attempt to describe an oligopoly equilibrium. The type of solution that 
Cournot proposed almost two centuries ago still plays a central role in many 
present-day models of oligopoly.
Cournot’s original formulation assumes a two-firm oligopoly, known as a 
duopoly, operating at zero marginal cost. Cournot analysed a market comprising 
two proprietors or firms, A and B, both selling mineral spring water. To ensure 
both firms operate at zero marginal cost, it is assumed the two firms are located 
side by side next to the spring and customers arrive at the spring with their own 
bottles. The firms are assumed to make their trading plans in turn or sequentially. 
It is also assumed, when making its own trading plans, that each firm expects the 
other firm to maintain its output at its current level. In other words, each firm 
assumes the other firm’s reaction (in terms of adjustment to output) is always 
zero. In the terminology introduced in Section 7.2, this is tantamount to an 
assumption of zero conjectural variation.
It is assumed the market demand or AR function is linear. For simplicity, the 
units of measurement for price and quantity are both chosen so that both axes 
are drawn on a scale of 0 to 1. The market demand or AR function is illustrated 
in Figure 7.1. To understand the derivation of the Cournot model, it is important 
to note that if the AR function is linear, the marginal revenue (MR) function is 
also linear, and intersects the horizontal axis at the mid-point between the origin 
and the intersection of the AR function. In Figure 7.1, this implies if the AR 
function intersects the horizontal axis at a value of Q = 1, the MR function must 
intersect at a value of Q = 1/2. Finally, in accordance with the assumption of 
zero marginal cost, in Figure 7.1 the MC function is shown running horizontally 
along the quantity axis.

Cournot’s duopoly model
In the Cournot model, the market equilibrium is reached through a sequence of 
actions and reactions on the part of the two firms. This is illustrated in Figure 7.2. 
Assume firm A is the first to open for business. In Round 1, firm A fixes its out-
put and price at the point where MR = MC = 0. Firm A’s output in Round 1 
is q1
A = 1/2, and the corresponding price is 1/2. Before firm B starts producing, 
firm A operates as if it were a monopolist.
Now firm B enters the market. B sees A is supplying q1
A = 1/2. According to 
the zero conjectural variation assumption, B assumes that whatever B does, A 
will continue to produce q1
A = 1/2. Therefore B’s effective or residual demand 
function is the segment of the market demand function that is not currently 

168	
|	 7    ■    Oligopoly: non-collusive models
serviced by A. This is the segment of the market demand function that lies to 
the right of q1
A = 1/2. If B charges a price of 1/2, B sells zero output. However, 
if B were prepared to allow the price to fall to 0, B could sell an output of 1/2. 
In Round 1, therefore, B’s AR function runs from P = 1/2 to q = 1/2, and 
B’s MR function intersects the horizontal axis at q1
B = 1/4. This is B’s profit-­
maximizing output in Round 1, because at this output MR = MC for B. At the 
end of Round 1, total industry output is q1
A + q1
B = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4. Accord-
ingly, using the market demand function, price is P = 1/4.
Before B entered, A was maximizing profit at q1
A = 1/2 and P = 1/2. How-
ever, B’s intervention causes price to fall to P = 1/4, which means A is no lon-
ger maximizing profit. According to the zero conjectural variation assumption, 
A assumes whatever A does, B will continue to produce at q1
B = 1/4. There-
fore A’s residual demand function is the segment of the market demand func-
tion that lies to the right of q1
B = 1/4. In Round 2, A’s AR function runs from 
P = 3/4 to q = 3/4. A’s MR function intersects the horizontal axis at q2
A = 3/8,  
A’s new profit-maximizing output in Round 2.
At the end of Round 1, B was maximizing profit at q1
B = 1/4 and P = 1/4.  
However, A’s adjustment causes price to rise to P = 3/8, so B is no longer maxi-
mizing profit at qB
 1 = 1/4. According to the zero conjectural variation assump-
tion, B assumes whatever B does, A will continue to produce at q2
A = 3/8.  
Therefore, B’s new residual demand function is the segment of the market 
demand function that lies to the right of q2
A = 3/8. In Round 2, B’s AR function 
runs from P = 5/8 to q = 5/8. B’s MR function intersects the horizontal axis at 
q2
B = 5/16, B’s new profit-maximizing output in Round 2. At the end of Round 2, 
total industry output is q2
A + q2
B = 3/8 + 5/16 = 11/16, and using the market 
demand function, price is P = 5/16.
By this stage, the mechanics of the sequence of actions and reactions 
should be clear. The Round 3 adjustments are shown in Figure 7.2, but they 
are not described in full here. At the end of Round 3, total industry output 
is q3
A + q3
B = 11/32 + 21/64 = 43/64, and price is P = 21/64. Of more impor-
tance is the equilibrium towards which the industry is converging as each round 
of actions and reactions takes place. This is shown on the right-hand side of 
­Figure 7.2, where both firms produce identical outputs of q*
A + q*
B = 1/3. Total 
industry output is q*
A + q*
B = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3, and price is P = 1/3.
With this set of outputs, neither firm has an incentive to make any further 
change to its trading plans. For example, A assumes B’s output is fixed at 
q*
B = 1/3. Therefore A’s residual demand function runs from P = 2/3 to q = 2/3,  
so A maximises profit at q*
B = 1/3. The same is true for firm B. Both firms maxi-
mise their own profit subject to the constraint that the other firm’s output is fixed 
at its current level; or equivalently, both firms maximise profit subject to the zero 
conjectural variation assumption.
Isoprofit curves and reaction functions
The zero marginal cost assumption is an obvious limitation of the version 
of the Cournot model that is described above. As shown in this subsection, 
however, it is straightforward to rework the Cournot model so that it can be 

	
	
	
7.3  Models of output determination in duopoly	 |	
169
applied to the case where marginal costs are non-zero. Therefore, the zero 
marginal cost assumption is not a fundamental limitation. In order to rework 
the Cournot model, a new diagrammatic representation of the model, known 
as an isoprofit diagram, is developed. To do so, the assumptions of identical 
firms and a linear industry demand function are retained. In the following 
discussion non-zero marginal costs are assumed, although the derivation is 
similar if marginal costs are zero.
In Figure 7.3, the output levels of firms A and B are shown on the horizontal 
and vertical axes, respectively. Begin by selecting a certain combination of out-
puts represented by point F, located somewhere towards the bottom-left-hand 
corner of Figure 7.3. At F, both qA and qB are relatively small. Total industry 
output is also relatively small. Let p1
A denote A’s profit at F, and consider what 
happens to A’s profit if A increases its output by a small amount, while B holds 
its output constant. This adjustment is represented by a horizontal shift from 
F to G. It can be inferred that A’s profit at G increases to p2
A, for two reasons:
■ Total industry output at F is small. The industry is operating on a relatively 
price-elastic section of the market demand function. Therefore an increase in 
qA (and the corresponding fall in market price) produces a large increase in A’s 
revenue.
■ qA at F is small, and A’s marginal cost is relatively low. Therefore, an increase 
in qA produces only a small increase in A’s costs.
Now consider what happens to A’s profit if B increases its output by a small 
amount, while A holds its output constant. This adjustment is represented by the 
upward vertical shift from G to H. It can be inferred that A’s profit decreases, 
back to p1
A. The fall in market price caused by B’s increase in output produces a 
decrease in A’s revenue, while A’s output and costs are unchanged.
Firm A’s isoprofit curves show all combinations of qA and qB which produce 
identical profit for firm A. Comparing the values of A’s profit at points F, G and 
H, it is evident that firm A’s isoprofit curves are upward-sloping in this region 
of Figure 7.3.
Figure 7.3  Derivation of firm A’s isoprofit curves

170	
|	 7    ■    Oligopoly: non-collusive models
The exercise can be repeated by selecting a new combination of outputs repre-
sented by the point X, located somewhere towards the bottom-right-hand corner 
of Figure 7.3. At X, qA is relatively large, but qB is relatively small. Because qA 
is large, total industry output is also relatively large. Assume A’s profit at X is 
p2
A, and consider what happens to A’s profit if A increases its output by a small 
amount, while B holds its output constant. This adjustment is represented by a 
horizontal shift from X to Y. It can be inferred that A’s profit at Y decreases to 
p1
A, for two reasons:
■ Total industry output at X is large. The industry is operating on a relatively 
price-inelastic section of the market demand function. Therefore an increase in 
qA (and the corresponding fall in market price) produces only a small increase, 
or perhaps even a decrease, in A’s revenue.
■ qA at X is large, and A’s marginal cost is relatively high. Therefore an increase 
in qA produces a large increase in A’s costs.
Consider what happens to A’s profit if B decreases its output by a small 
amount, while A holds its output constant. This adjustment is represented by the 
downward vertical shift from Y to Z. It can be inferred that A’s profit increases, 
back to p2
A. The increase in market price caused by B’s decrease in output pro-
duces an increase in A’s revenue, while A’s output and costs remain unchanged. 
Comparing the values of A’s profit at points X, Y and Z, it is evident that firm 
A’s isoprofit curves are downward-sloping in this region of Figure 7.3.
The concave curves shown in Figure 7.4 represent firm A’s complete set 
of isoprofit curves. In accordance with the preceding discussion, successive 
isoprofit curves represent higher levels of profit for A as they approach the 
horizontal axis. Furthermore, for any given value of qB, the profit-maximizing 
Figure 7.4  Firm A’s isoprofit curves and reaction function

	
	
	
7.3  Models of output determination in duopoly	 |	
171
value of qA can be found by identifying the isoprofit curve that attains a 
peak at that value of qB. For example, if qB = qB in Figure 7.4, A’s profit-
maximizing output level is q*
A, where the horizontal line at qB is tangential to 
the isoprofit curve for p2
A, the highest isoprofit curve that is attainable by A 
anywhere along this horizontal line. At any other point on the line, A’s profit 
is less than p2
A.
Reading Figure 7.4 from top to bottom, as firm A’s profit increases, the peaks 
of successive isoprofit curves lie further to the right. The lower the value of qB,  
the more of the market there is available for A to exploit, and so the higher 
the profit-maximizing value of qA. Firm A’s reaction function, denoted RFA, 
shows, for each value of qB (assumed fixed), the profit-maximizing value of qA. 
In ­Figure 7.4, RFA is the line connecting the peaks of successive isoprofit curves.
The next stage in the analysis involves the construction of isoprofit curves and 
a reaction function for B. Firm B’s isoprofit curves show all combinations of 
qA and qB which produce identical profit for firm B. Firm B’s reaction func-
tion shows, for each value of qA (assumed fixed) the profit-maximizing value 
of qB. Based on the earlier assumption that the firms are identical, this task 
is straightforward. B’s isoprofit curves and reaction function have exactly the 
same appearance relative to the vertical axis as A’s isoprofit curves and reaction 
function relative to the horizontal axis. Figure 7.5 shows one (representative) 
isoprofit curve for each firm, together with the two firms’ reaction functions, on 
the same diagram.
Cournot–Nash equilibrium
Using the apparatus of isoprofit curves and reaction functions, the outputs 
qA and qB, which represent an equilibrium solution to the duopoly model, can 
be located. Using the same reasoning as in the derivation of Cournot’s model, 
Figure 7.5  Cournot–Nash equilibrium

172	
|	 7    ■    Oligopoly: non-collusive models
assume both firms seek to maximise their own profit, subject to the constraint 
that the other firm’s output is fixed at its current level. In other words, both firms 
maximise profit subject to the zero conjectural variation assumption. In the ter-
minology of this subsection, this is equivalent to assuming that both firms seek 
to operate on their own reaction functions (recall, each firm’s reaction function 
shows its profit-maximizing output treating the other firm’s output as given). The 
point in Figure 7.5 at which both firms are simultaneously located on their own 
reaction functions is the point where RFA and RFB intersect, denoted C–N. In 
the Cournot model with downward-sloping reaction functions, the outputs qA 
and qB are said to be strategic substitutes: if one firm alters its output, the other 
firm reacts by adjusting its output in the opposite direction.
C–N denotes a Cournot–Nash equilibrium, named after Cournot and the 
American mathematician John Nash. The centrepiece of Nash’s PhD thesis, pre-
pared in 1950, was a solution to the problem of determining an equilibrium in a 
non-cooperative game (see Chapter 9), based on similar principles to the solu-
tion to the two-firm duopoly model proposed by Cournot more than a century 
before. Nash was eventually awarded the Nobel Prize in economics in 1994 for 
his contributions to game theory (see Box 1.1).
It is interesting to note that the previous description of the Cournot model 
can also be represented (more concisely) using reaction functions. Figure 7.6 
shows a pair of reaction functions derived under the zero marginal cost assump-
tion, as noted above, assuming MC = 0 does not change the general shape of 
the isoprofit curves and reaction functions, although it does affect their precise 
locations. Figure 7.6 represents the process of convergence towards the market 
equilibrium at C–N as a process of ‘zigzagging’ between points located on RFA 
and RFB.

■ In Round 1 before B has entered, A’s profit-maximizing output is q1
A = 1/2,  
at the very bottom of RFA (where qB = 0). When B does enter, B’s profit-
maximizing output subject to q1
A = 1/2 is q1
B = 1/4, at the point on RFB corre-
sponding to qA = 1/2. Therefore at the end of Round 1, (q1
A = 1/2, q1
B = 1/4,) 
is attained, as before.
■ In Round 2, A’s profit-maximizing output subject to q1
B = 1/4 is q2
A = 3/8 (the 
point on RFA corresponding to q1
B = 1/4). Similarly, B’s profit-maximizing 
output subject to q2
A = 3/8 is q2
B = 5/16 (the point on RFB corresponding to 
q2
A = 3/8). At the end of Round 2, (3/8, 5/16) is attained.
■ At the end of Round 3, (11/32, 21/64) is attained (not shown in Figure 7.6).
■ Equilibrium is attained at (q*
A = 1/3, q*
B = 1/3), represented by the point C–N 
in Figure 7.6 located at the intersection of RFA and RFB.
The Cournot–Nash solution can also be derived for cases in which an oligopoly 
consists of more than two firms. Under the zero conjectural variation assumption 
in an N-firm model, each firm sets its output so as to maximise its own profit, 
treating the outputs of the other N - 1 firms as fixed at their current levels. 
A general formula for the market equilibrium is:
Qn = Qc
N
N + 1
where Qn represents total industry output at the Cournot–Nash equilibrium 
and QC represents total industry output if the industry structure was perfectly 
competitive.
In Figure 7.1, the maximum value of market demand (when price equals zero) 
is one, and marginal cost is zero. The perfectly competitive industry output level 
is QC = 1, because P = MC implies price is driven down to zero. The formula 
for Qn (above) implies the following:
■ N = 1 corresponds to the case of monopoly. In Round 1 before B enters, 
A maximises profit by producing the monopolist’s output, Qn = q1
A = 1/2.
■ N = 2 corresponds to the case of duopoly. Qn = q*
A + q*
B = 2/3 is consistent 
with (q*
A = 1/3, q*
B = 1/3) at the Cournot–Nash equilibrium.
■ As N increases and approaches infinity, Qn increases and approaches QC = 1.
What conclusions can be drawn from the Cournot model? The model can be 
criticised in several ways. First, it is based on a naive and unrealistic assumption 
that each firm believes its rival will not change its output (the zero conjectural 
variation assumption), in spite of each firm continually observing behaviour that 
contradicts this assumption. Each time either firm adjusts its own output, it does 
so on the basis of the zero conjectural variation assumption. But on each occa-
sion this assumption turns out to be false, because the other firm does react and 
does also change its output. It is natural to wonder why the firms fail to learn 
from experience to anticipate each other’s reactions.
In defence of the Cournot model, it can be argued that the solution to 
the problem of oligopoly is more important than the story about how this 

174	
|	 7    ■    Oligopoly: non-collusive models
equilibrium is attained. This story does not need to be taken too literally: in 
practice there are many ways for the two firms to arrive at C–N, where both 
are maximizing their own profits subject to the constraint that the other firm’s 
output is treated as fixed.
Cournot can be criticised for ignoring the possibility that firms may seek coop-
erative or collusive solutions, in order to maximise their joint profits. This is, and 
almost certainly was in Cournot’s time, a fact of economic life in oligopolistic 
markets. Cournot has also been criticised for focusing on output-setting, and 
ignoring price-setting decisions. Price adjustments in the Cournot model are the 
consequence of output decisions, rather than being primary courses of action.
Nevertheless, the theory does make several important positive contributions. 
It introduced the use of mathematical techniques for the solution of economic 
problems, and it subsequently provided economists with important tools of 
analysis, such as conjectural variation, isoprofit curves and reaction functions. 
It identifies an oligopoly equilibrium that is located reassuringly between the 
extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. It can be used as a benchmark 
for all further discussion of decision-making under oligopoly, including decisions 
concerning intellectual property, research and development, mergers, interna-
tional trade and the financial structure of the firm (Daughety, 2008).
Chamberlin’s solution: joint profit maximization
The apparatus of isoprofit curves and reaction functions developed in the previous 
subsection can be used to identify several solutions to the duopoly model other 
than the one proposed by Cournot. Chamberlin (1933) suggests an alternative solu-
tion, in which the firms recognise their interdependence when making their output 
decisions. Accordingly, Chamberlin departs from the zero conjectural variation 
assumption. No longer does each firm set its output so as to maximise its own 
profit, while treating the other firm’s output as fixed. Instead, the firms recognise 
it is in their mutual interest to produce and share equally among themselves the 
output that would be delivered if the market was serviced by a single monopolist. 
In this way, the firms also share equally among themselves the monopoly profit.
Starting from the Cournot–Nash equilibrium C–N in Figure 7.7, it is apparent 
that if both firms were to simultaneously reduce their output, both firms could 
simultaneously achieve an increase in profit. In other words, moving ‘south-west’ 
from C–N, it is possible for both firms to simultaneously move onto isoprofit 
curves representing higher levels of profit than at C–N. In fact, starting from any 
point above and to the right of the line QMQM, it is always possible for both firms 
to simultaneously increase their profits by moving ‘south-west’ in Figure 7.7. 
QMQM is the line identifying all points of tangency between the isoprofit curves 
of firms A and B.
The points at which QMQM cuts the horizontal and vertical axes of Figure 7.7 
are labelled QM because these points represent the profit-maximizing outputs if 
either firm were operating as a monopolist. For example, along the horizontal 
axis qB = 0, firm A operates as a monopolist with a profit-maximizing output 
of QM. Similarly, along the vertical axis qA = 0 firm B’s profit-maximizing out-
put is also QM. QMQM is simply a 45-degree line linking these two points. At 

	
	
	
7.3  Models of output determination in duopoly	 |	
175
any intermediate point on QMQM, total output is QM, and this output is shared 
between firms A and B. At point J, at the middle of this line, the monopoly out-
put of QM is shared equally between firms A and B. Point J represents Chamber-
lin’s joint profit maximization solution to the duopoly model.
In Chamberlin’s formulation, both firms recognise their interdependence and 
realise that sharing the monopoly profit is the best they can do. It is important to 
note that Chamberlin does not suggest firms achieve this solution through collusion. 
The outcome rests on the assumption that each firm recognises that the monopoly 
ideal can be achieved through independent action; and this view is shared by its 
rival. In this way, both firms achieve a higher payoff than in Cournot’s formulation.
Chamberlin’s solution allows for no unilateral aggression, cheating or back-
sliding on the part of the two firms. Starting from point J, A may be aware that 
if it were to unilaterally increase its output (moving ‘east’ in Figure 7.7 towards 
RFA) it could achieve an increase in profit, provided B does not react by also 
increasing its output. However, moving ‘east’ from J causes B’s profit to fall, so 
it seems unlikely B would fail to react. Similarly at J, B is aware that if it were 
to increase its output (moving ‘north’ towards RFB) it could increase its profit 
provided A does not do the same. But, again, moving ‘north’ from J causes A’s 
profit to fall and it seems unlikely A would fail to react. Therefore, Chamberlin’s 
solution is always liable to break down, if either or both firms succumb to the 
temptation to act unilaterally and ignore their interdependence.
Stackelberg’s solution: the leader–follower model
Stackelberg (1934) suggests yet another solution to the Cournot duopoly model. 
The Cournot model assigns equal status to both firms as they progress towards 
the final equilibrium. Both firms operate according to the zero conjectural 
Figure 7.7  Cournot–Nash equilibrium and joint profit maximization

176	
|	 7    ■    Oligopoly: non-collusive models
variation assumption, and each firm fails to anticipate the other’s reaction on 
each occasion it adjusts its own output. Suppose, however, the zero conjectural 
variation assumption is dropped for firm A, but retained for firm B. B continues 
to select its profit-maximizing output by treating A’s output as fixed at its current 
level. But A learns to recognise that B behaves in this manner. A therefore learns 
to take B’s behaviour into account whenever A makes its own output decisions.
How should firm A select its own output, given that it has this insight into 
firm B’s behaviour? A’s awareness of B’s behaviour is tantamount to A’s rec-
ognition that whatever output A selects, B always reacts by selecting an output 
that returns the two firms to an output combination that lies on B’s reaction 
function, RFB. A should therefore select the output that maximises A’s profit, 
subject to B’s expected reaction. Accordingly, A should select qL
A and aim for SA 
in Figure 7.8: the point on RFB where A’s profit is maximised. A anticipates, 
correctly, that B will react by producing qF
B. SA is the point of tangency between 
RFB and the highest isoprofit curve A can attain, given that the final equilibrium 
must lie on RFB. At any other point on RFB, A’s profit is lower than it is at SA.
By learning to anticipate and take account of firm B’s behaviour, firm A earns 
a higher profit than at C–N, while B earns a lower profit. A is rewarded, and B 
is punished, for the fact that A has insight into B’s behaviour, while B does not 
have corresponding insight into A’s behaviour. An alternative (but only slightly 
different) interpretation of Stackelberg’s solution is as a model of first-mover 
advantage. Returning to Cournot’s original story of sequential decision-making, 
if A recognises that B always follows the zero conjectural variation assumption, 
in Round 1 A should produce qL
A, in the knowledge that B will react by producing 
Figure 7.8  Cournot–Nash equilibrium and Stackelberg equilibria

	
	
	
7.3  Models of output determination in duopoly	 |	
177
qF
B. Accordingly, the two firms arrive directly at the Stackelberg equilibrium at 
the end of Round 1, with A producing the higher output and earning the higher 
profit. In this interpretation, A is the leader and B is the follower, and A is 
rewarded for its first-mover advantage.
Generalizing the preceding discussion, four possible outcomes are identified 
in Figure 7.8:
■ At SA, firm A is the leader and firm B is the follower, as discussed above.
■ SB represents the opposite case, where B is the leader and A is the follower. A 
follows the zero conjectural variation assumption. B recognises A behaves in 
this way, and aims for SB, the point on A’s reaction function RFA that maxi-
mises B’s profit.
■ If both firms are followers, C–N, the Cournot–Nash equilibrium, is achieved 
as before.
■ Finally, and quite realistically in many oligopolistic markets, both firms might 
simultaneously attempt to be leaders. If both simultaneously produce the 
higher level of output qL
A = qL
B, the result is a Stackelberg disequilibrium or 
price war at P–W. At this conflict point there is overproduction, and the firms 
are forced to cut their prices in order to sell the additional output. Accord-
ingly, both firms earn less profit than at C–N. A costly price war might eventu-
ally determine a winner and a loser, but it is also possible the firms may realise 
the futility of conflict and search for a more cooperative solution.
Section 7.3 identifies a number of possible solutions to the problem of out-
put determination in duopoly. A mathematical derivation of these results can 
be found in Appendix 1. To conclude this section, it is useful to return to the 
numerical example that was used to introduce the Cournot model at the start 
of this section, and compare the numerical values of price and quantity for each 
of the solutions to the model. Consider a duopoly in which the market demand 
function is linear and the units of measurement for price and quantity are scaled 
from 0 to 1; and both firms produce at zero marginal cost. Figure 7.9 shows 
the numerical values of qA and qB at the Cournot, Chamberlin and Stackelberg 
equilibria. Table 7.1 contains the same numerical data, and also compares the 
equilibrium prices and profits of the two firms.
The Chamberlin joint profit maximization equilibrium corresponds to 
the monopoly price and output, with the firms sharing the monopoly profit 
equally between them, with pA = pB = 1/8. Both are better off than at the 
Cournot–Nash equilibrium, where price is lower, total output is higher, and 
pA = pB = 1/9. At the Stackelberg equilibrium with A as leader, price is lower 
still and total output is higher. A does better (pA = 1/8) and B does worse 
(pB = 1/16) than at the Cournot–Nash equilibrium. At the Stackelberg equi-
librium with B as leader, these positions are reversed. Finally, the Stackelberg 
disequilibrium (price war) corresponds to the perfectly competitive price and 
output, with price driven down to zero (equal to marginal cost), output raised 
to one, and both firms earning zero profit.

Models of price determination in duopoly
The Bertrand model: price competition
In another famous and influential contribution to duopoly theory, Bertrand 
(1883) criticises Cournot’s emphasis on output-setting. Bertrand argues that 
price, rather than output, is the key decision variable for most firms. In Cournot’s 
model, the firms decide their output levels and then allow the market price to 
adjust accordingly. In the Bertrand model each firm sets its own price, and then 
sells as much output as it can at the chosen price. Bertrand uses a zero conjec-
tural variation assumption concerning prices: each firm assumes its rival will 
stick to the rival’s current price. The model rests on implicit assumptions that 
the output of the two firms is identical and there are no transaction or search 
costs. Therefore, customers flow effortlessly to the firm that is currently offering 
the lowest price.

179
To locate the equilibrium in the Bertrand model, assume, as in the Cournot 
model, that the firms take their price decisions sequentially and that both firms 
face a horizontal marginal cost function MCA = MCB. In Round 1, firm A sets 
its price initially at the monopoly level, PM, and earns the monopoly profit. Then 
firm B arrives. How should B react to A’s initial price decision? By setting its 
price fractionally below PM, say at PM - « where « is a very small amount, B 
undercuts A and gains all of A’s customers. By doing so, B earns a profit frac-
tionally below the monopoly profit.
In Round 2, how should A react to B’s intervention in Round 1? Using the 
same reasoning, by setting its price fractionally below PM - «, say at PM - 2«, 
A undercuts B and gains all of B’s customers. Firm A earns a profit a little further 
below the monopoly profit. Then, by setting its price at PM - 3«, B undercuts 
A again and regains all of A’s customers. B’s profit is now a little further still 
below the monopoly profit.
Similar reasoning also applies in Round 3 and in subsequent rounds, when fur-
ther price-cutting takes place. Is there ever an end to the price-cutting sequence? 
The answer to this question is yes. When price has fallen to the perfectly competi-
tive level PC = MC, there is no incentive for either firm to cut price any further. 
Although by so doing, either firm could still gain all of the other’s customers, 
this would not be worthwhile if it required setting a price below marginal cost, at 
which normal profit would not be earned. If firm A is the first to reach PC, at the 
next decision point firm B simply follows firm A, and also charges PC. Because 
consumers are indifferent between the two firms at this price, it is assumed each 
firm captures a 50 per cent share of the market at PC. The solution is illustrated 
in Figure 7.10. At the equilibrium price PC = MC, both firms produce output 
levels of qA = qB = 1/2QC.
Previous criticism of the zero conjectural variation assumption applies to the 
Bertrand model, as it does to the Cournot model. Each firm might be expected to 
learn from experience to anticipate its rival’s reactions to its own price-­cutting deci-
sions. Furthermore, Bertrand’s conclusion that, in equilibrium, the two duopolists

180	
|	 7    ■    Oligopoly: non-collusive models
finish up charging the perfectly competitive price may seem surprising. In contrast 
to the Cournot model, the Bertrand model appears to suggest there is no interme-
diate case lying between the polar cases of monopoly and perfect competition. In 
fact, this conclusion is due to Bertrand’s assumption that the two firms produce 
an identical product. Chapter 16 develops a model of Bertrand competition with 
product differentiation, in which a price cut by one firm allows it to gain some, but 
not all, of its rival’s customers.
However, in the case described above, with identical products there is no 
option other than to compete on price. Equilibrium is only achieved when price 
is driven down to the perfectly competitive level. It has been suggested that price 
competition in the airline industry, especially since the arrival of low-cost airlines, 
may approximate to Bertrand competition. Although the number of airlines is 
small, from the customer’s perspective they offer essentially an identical product. 
Intense price competition on many routes has driven down fares to levels close 
to marginal cost, which (in an industry with high fixed costs and low variable 
costs) is quite close to zero.
The original Bertrand model of price competition, as described above, was 
based on the key assumption that products are identical, and market demand 
flows freely, and in its entirety, to the firm currently offering the lowest price. The 
models of output determination in duopoly described in Section 7.3 are based on 
a different assumption: if one firm raises its price while the other holds its price 
constant, then the firm that sets the higher price loses some, but not all, of its 
market. This describes the case where there is some product differentiation: the 
products produced by the two firms are similar, but not identical. As a conse-
quence, demand still flows in the direction of the firm currently offering the lower 
price; but this firm does not capture all of the market because some consumers 
remain loyal to the other firm now offering the higher price.
It is possible to examine the implications of Bertrand price competition in a 
duopoly model based on the assumptions of Section 7.3. An important feature 
of this model, which was implicit in Section 7.3 but is now made explicit, is that 
in absolute terms, the (negative) elasticity of Firm A’s demand with respect to 
a change in Firm A’s price, or own-price elasticity, is larger than the (positive) 
elasticity of Firm A’s demand with respect to a change in Firm B’s price, or cross-
price elasticity. In other words, Firm A’s demand is more sensitive to a change in 
Firm A’s price than to an equivalent change in Firm B’s price. Likewise, Firm B’s 
demand is more sensitive to a change in Firm B’s price than to an equivalent 
change in Firm A’s price. Figure 7.11 illustrates the reaction functions of Firms A 
and B, expressed in terms of the prices set by A (on the horizontal axis) and B 
(on the vertical axis).
To understand why the reaction functions are upward sloping, and A’s reac-
tion function is more steeply sloped than B’s reaction function, consider first the 
implications for A of a small departure from any point on A’s reaction function 
that is caused by an increase in PB. By increasing PB while PA is initially held 
constant, B experiences a relatively large reduction in demand (reflecting the rela-
tively high own-price elasticity), while A experiences a relatively small increase in 
demand (reflecting the relatively low cross-price elasticity). A reacts by increas-
ing PA, but by a smaller amount than the original increase in PB. Therefore A’s 

	
	
	
7.4  Models of price determination in duopoly	 |	
181
reaction function is sloped more steeply than the 45-degree line. For the same 
reasons, B’s reaction function is also upward-sloping, but is sloped less steeply 
than the 45-degree line.
The point at which the two firms’ reaction functions intersect corresponds to 
the point at which both firms maximise their own profits subject to a zero con-
jectural variation assumption, that the other firm will maintain its price at the 
current level. In the Bertrand duopoly model, PA and PB are said to be strategic 
complements. If one firm alters its price, the other firm reacts by adjusting its price 
in the same direction. This is in contrast to the Cournot–Nash duopoly model of 
output competition, in which qA and qB are strategic substitutes: if one firm alters 
its output, the other firm reacts by adjusting its output in the opposite direction. 
The fact that prices are strategic complements, while outputs are strategic substi-
tutes, reflects the intuition that competition on price in duopoly or oligopoly is 
likely to be more intense than competition based on outputs or quantities.
The Edgeworth model: price competition with a production 
capacity constraint
Edgeworth (1897) modifies Bertrand’s original model of price competition in 
duopoly to allow for the possibility that the firms are subject to a production 
capacity constraint. At relatively low prices this constraint precludes each firm 
from gaining all of the other firm’s customers by implementing a further small 
price cut. Edgeworth retains Bertrand’s zero conjectural variation assumption as 
regards prices: each firm assumes its rival will stick to the rival’s current price. In 
this capacity-constrained case, the conclusions are very different from those of 
Bertrand. In fact, Edgeworth shows that there is no stable equilibrium solution 
to the capacity-constrained duopoly model.
Figure 7.12 illustrates Edgeworth’s model. The horizontal marginal cost func-
tion of Figure 7.10 is replaced with a vertical section located at 1/2QC, which is

Figure 7.12  Price-setting in the Edgeworth duopoly model
assumed to represent each firm’s full-capacity output level. Suppose, through 
a process of Bertrand competition, the two firms have arrived at the Bertrand 
equilibrium, with each firm producing an output of 1/2QC and selling at a price 
of PC. Why is this no longer a stable equilibrium if the firms are capacity con-
strained? The answer is that either firm can now consider raising its price with-
out the fear it will lose all its customers to the other firm. For example, if A is 
incapable of producing more than 1/2QC, B can set a price anywhere between 
PC and M, and still sell some output to those customers whom A is incapable 
of servicing. These customers are forced to pay the higher price charged by 
B. In Figure 7.11, MN represents B’s residual demand function. The triangle 
PCMN is the segment of the market demand function that cannot be serviced 
by A (equivalent to the triangle NRS). To maximise profit using B’s residual 
demand function, B should charge a price of P1, at which B produces and sells 
an output of 1/4QC.
However, a situation where A produces 1/2QC and charges PC, and B pro-
duces 1/4QC and charges P1, is also not a stable equilibrium. Firm A now has 
an incentive also to raise its price to P1. By doing so, A can still produce and sell 
its full-capacity output of 1/2QC. However, A now sells twice as much output 
and earns twice as much profit as B. But B then realises that, by reducing its price 
slightly, say to P1 - «, B can undercut A, increasing its own output to B’s full-
capacity level of 1/2QC, and reducing A’s output to (slightly more than) ­1/4QC.  
A then realises that if A reduces its price further, it can once again increase its 
own output and profit, at B’s expense. The sequence of price-cutting continues 
until the price returns to PC and both firms produce their full-capacity output 
levels of 1/2QC. At this point, however, one of the firms realises it can do bet-
ter by raising its price, and the entire cycle begins all over again! And so it goes 
on, prices fluctuating continually between P1 and PC. The model is inherently 
unstable and the solution is indeterminate.

183
As before, Edgeworth’s model can be criticised for its reliance on the zero con-
jectural variation assumption. The model seems to be built on the idea that firms’ 
conjectures are always wrong. The model can also be criticised for the assump-
tion that firms can continually and effortlessly adjust their prices and outputs. 
A charitable assessment of the model is to see it as an improvement on some of 
the previous models discussed, because it identifies the possibility of instability 
in oligopoly. Some economists believe that oligopolies are inherently unstable. 
Although prices may at times appear stable, often the stability is imposed, either 
by tacit or explicit collusion. Perhaps the temptation to collude is irresistible, 
if the alternative is perpetual instability as Edgeworth suggests. Solberg (1992) 
suggests that Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola, both subject to capacity limits in local 
markets, have frequently resorted to aggressive price-cutting strategies, as sug-
gested by the Edgeworth model.
The Bertrand and Edgeworth models are among the earliest attempts to 
­theorise about the behaviour of oligopolists. The one major drawback these 
models have in common with the Cournot model, but not with the Chamberlin 
and Stackelberg models, is the zero conjectural variation assumption: the belief 
that rivals will not respond to any price or output change by altering their own 
prices or outputs, despite continually observing behaviour that contradicts this 
assumption. Section 7.5 examines some other models in which this assumption 
is relaxed, and the firms are aware their actions will prompt rivals to reconsider 
their own decisions.
Case study 7.1
Divide opens between German discounters  
as Aldi juggernaut slows
FT
A 39p bag of parsnips sparked a mini-price war that defined the weeks leading up 
to Christmas for Britain’s grocers. Aldi’s decision to cut the price of vegetables as it 
approached the festive season started a domino effect that resulted in WM Morrison 
selling 4kg of potatoes, carrots, swedes, onions or parsnips for just £1 in an effort to woo 
cost-conscious shoppers. The gamble—just 10 days before Christmas and requiring an 
overhaul of the Bradford-based supermarket’s entire packaging operation overnight—
paid off, with Morrisons this week reporting a 0.2 per cent rise in like-for-like sales. Tesco 
and J Sainsbury also beat expectations, in an indication that the fight back against the 
discounters is beginning to produce results.
But while Lidl—which undercut Aldi with packs of vegetables priced at 
29p—­continued to gain ground over Christmas, with double digit like-for-like sales 
growth, Aldi’s juggernaut appears to have slowed. Lidl, which last year reported record 

184	
|	 7    ■    Oligopoly: non-collusive models
UK revenues of £4bn, told the Financial Times that like-for-like sales rose 18.4 per 
cent over Christmas, down from 20.5 per cent a year earlier. But there are indications 
that sales in Aldi’s existing stores failed to rise at all. The German company, however, 
refuses to disclose like-for-like sales, deeming them an irrelevance. John Neale, joint 
managing director at Aldi, says: ‘The majority of our growth will come from new 
stores because the huge popularity of Aldi means our existing stores mature quickly 
from the day they open.’
The discount chain last year opened 65 stores, taking its total to 627 in the UK, with 
plans to open another 83 this year. It too reported record UK sales last year, of £7bn 
for 2014, but analysts suggest its existing stores have not seen sales growth over the past 
year. Figures from Kantar Worldpanel, the research group, showed that Aldi’s sales rose 
11.5 per cent in the four weeks to January 3. This is half the rate at which they increased 
a year earlier, when they climbed 25.8 per cent. Analysts point out that the growth rate is 
the same at which Aldi opened stores over the past 12 months—suggesting that its like-
for-like sales were flat. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein, says: ‘Aldi’s four-week 
growth of 11 per cent is in line with its space growth, implying its existing stores are now 
flat on like for like.’
In contrast, Kantar recorded that Lidl’s four-week sales were up 21 per cent over 
Christmas, far outstripping the rate at which it opened stores and nearly double the 
12.6 per cent growth recorded by Kantar a year before. In the past 12 months, Lidl cut 
the ribbon on 20 new outlets, taking its total portfolio to 630—an expansion rate of 3 per 
cent. Walmart-owned Asda is the only major grocer yet to announce Christmas trading 
figures—but Kantar data show its total sales contracted 2.9 per cent. Data from research 
group Nielsen also suggest that Aldi’s margins have fallen. While the size of the average 
Aldi basket rose 1.5 per cent in the final 12 weeks of 2015, the average price of its items 
fell 3.2 per cent. In contrast, Lidl’s average basket size grew 4.7 per cent, outstripping its 
average price decline of 2.3 per cent.
Mike Watkins, head of UK retail at Nielsen, says cut-price competitors are ‘not immune 
to a fightback from the Big Four’. The contrast between Aldi and Lidl’s performance is 
not just down to Lidl’s greater exposure to the south-east, or the fact it has expanded at a 
faster pace. Aldi also failed to include key Christmas favourites, such as smoked salmon 
or red cabbage, in its offerings. Lidl, by contrast, ramped up its deluxe range ahead of 
the festive period.
‘Lidl is spending much more effort focusing on quality,’ says Mr Monteyne. ‘If you go 
round their stores it doesn’t feel like a discounter—all of the hanging imagery is beautiful 
farmers and healthy cows. They are trying to impress.’ He adds that Aldi’s margins have 
come down from 5.3 per cent a year ago to 3 per cent in the second half of this year—and 
are expected to drop to as low as 1-2 per cent within the next nine months. ‘At that point 
they will stop cutting prices,’ he says. ‘It’s not over yet, but there’s plenty of evidence that 
the tide is turning.’

The kinked demand curve and models of price leadership
The kinked demand curve
This famous model was developed almost simultaneously by Sweezy (1939) and 
Hall and Hitch (1939). The model seeks to explain an observed tendency for price 
to be rather inflexible or ‘rigid’ in many oligopolistic markets. The idea behind 
the kinked demand curve model is that each firm in an oligopoly may be reluctant 
to initiate either a price increase or price cut, for the following reasons:
■ The firm believes if it increases its price, its rivals will not follow, but will seek 
instead to take advantage by encouraging the firm’s customers to switch to 
them. Consequently, the firm stands to lose a sizeable portion of its market 
share if it increases its price.
■ The firm also believes, if it cuts its price, its rivals will follow in order to protect 
their own market shares. Consequently, the firm does not stand to gain market 
share if it cuts its price.
In other words, the firm tends to take a rather cautious or pessimistic view of its 
rivals’ likely reaction to any decision to either increase or reduce its own price. 
If all firms think in this way, prices throughout the industry tend to be inflexible 
or rigid, because no firm wishes to be the first to implement a price change in 
either direction.
Sweezy’s model is shown in Figure 7.13. P1 is the firm’s current price. dd is 
the firm’s demand function, drawn on the assumption that if it raises or lowers 
its price from P1, its rivals do not follow. dd is relatively price elastic, because if

186	
|	 7    ■    Oligopoly: non-collusive models
the firm is the only one raising its price, it loses most of its customers; and, if it 
is the only one cutting its price, it gains customers rapidly from its rivals. DD is 
the firm’s demand function, drawn on the assumption that if it raises or lowers its 
price from P1, its rivals follow and do the same. DD is less price elastic because, 
if all firms simultaneously raise or lower their prices, they only gain or lose sales 
to the extent that total industry sales rise or fall; the firms do not tend to gain or 
lose customers from one another.
In Figure 7.13, the firm faces two possible demand functions, drawn on differing 
assumptions about rivals’ reactions to any price change. What is the firm’s perceived 
demand function? On the pessimistic assumptions described above, dd is considered 
to be the demand function applicable for a price rise above P1 (or for quantities 
less than q1). DD is the demand function applicable for a price cut below P1 (or for 
quantities greater than q1). Therefore, dAD is the firm’s perceived demand function. 
There is a kink at point A, which identifies the current price and quantity, P1 and q1.
What is the shape of the firm’s perceived marginal revenue (MR) function? 
Applying similar logic, mm is the MR function associated with the demand func-
tion dd, applicable for quantities less than q1. MM is the MR function associ-
ated with the demand function DD, applicable for quantities greater than q1. 
Therefore, mBCM is the firm’s perceived MR function. There is a discontinuity 
between points B and C located at the current quantity q1, at which point a switch 
between the two MR functions takes place.
Profit is maximised where MR = MC. MR 7 MC to the left of q1, and 
MR 6 MC to the right of q1. Therefore profit is maximised at P1 and q1, because 
MC intersects the discontinuous section of the perceived MR function at q1. Even 
if MC rises or falls slightly, as long as the point of intersection remains within 
the discontinuity BC, the profit-maximizing price and quantity are unchanged. 
This provides a more formal demonstration of the property of price rigidity or 
‘sticky prices’.
The degree of price rigidity depends on the length of the discontinuity in the 
MR function, BC. This in turn depends on the angle of the kink (l), which has 
been called the barometer of price rigidity. Stigler (1947) identifies several factors 
that might affect the angle of the kink:
■ If there are very few rivals, both price increases and price cuts are more likely 
to be followed, since the firms are highly conscious of their interdependence. 
The perceived demand function may approach DD. If there are many rivals, 
price increases and price cuts are less likely to be followed, as competition 
approaches the atomistic case in which each firm’s actions have a negligible 
effect on its rivals. Stigler thought an intermediate number of firms would 
generate the most acute l, and the longest discontinuity in the MR function.
■ The size of the rivals may also affect the size of the kink. If there is one large 
firm, or a clique of firms, it may act as a price leader, with others following its 
price decisions. In this extreme case there may be no kink. The same applies 
if there is collusion.
■ Product homogeneity (or a large and positive cross-elasticity of demand) pro-
duces an acute l and a long discontinuity, as customers are more likely to shift 
when facing a price differential.

	
	
	
7.5  The kinked demand curve and models of price leadership	 |	
187
This list is extended by Cohen and Cyert (1965, p. 251):
■ If entrants are unsure about the market structure, or incumbent firms are 
unsure about the intentions of entrants, firms may adopt a wait-and-see atti-
tude and be reluctant to initiate price rises.
■ The same may also be true in a new industry, where firms are learning to 
understand each other’s behaviour.
■ If there is substantial shareholder control, risk-averse managers may decide 
to play safe by avoiding actions that could provoke damaging reactions 
from rivals.
The kinked demand curve model can be criticised for not explaining how 
price is formed at the kink. The model begins with the price as given; it does 
not explain how price is determined. It explains the existence of the kink but 
not its location. Furthermore, price rigidity might be explained in other ways. 
Firms may be reluctant to raise price for fear of alienating their customers. 
Firms may wait for a convenient time to introduce one large price rise, rather 
than revise prices continuously, the latter being a strategy that might annoy 
customers. Levy et al. (1997) suggest that changing price is itself a costly and 
complex operation. Accordingly, in businesses where menu costs are high, price 
changes are less frequent.
Stigler (1947) finds little empirical evidence of price rigidity. Having examined 
the evidence in seven oligopolistic markets (cigarettes, cars, anthracite, steel, 
dynamite, refining and potash) he claims price changes were quite frequent, 
although there is some evidence to suggest that the smaller the number of firms, 
the less frequent are the changes in price.
But is this adverse conclusion really surprising? The kink is a barrier to 
changes in prices that will increase profits, and business is the collection 
of devices for circumventing barriers to profits. That this barrier 
should thwart businessmen – especially when it is wholly of their own 
fabrication – is unbelievable.
(Stigler, 1947, p. 435)
In a later article, Stigler commented that he was amazed at the continuing popu-
larity of the model. ‘The theory has received no systematic empirical support 
and virtually no theoretical elaboration in these decades, but these lacks have 
been no handicap in maintaining its currency’ (Stigler, 1978, p. 186). Freedman 
(1995) argues that Stigler was instinctively hostile to the kinked demand curve 
model because it adopts a methodological approach different from that of the 
neoclassical theory of the firm.
For some years, macroeconomists have used aggregate data to identify the 
implications of price rigidity for the behaviour of output and inflation over 
time (Blinder et al., 1998). More recently, microlevel datasets have become 
available that allow detailed analysis of price-setting behaviour. For example, 
Kashyap (1995) examines price changes for 12 retail goods over 35 years, and 
finds that prices were typically fixed for more than a year. In a study based on 80 

188	
|	 7    ■    Oligopoly: non-collusive models
industries, Domberger and Fiebig (1993) find that price cuts were more readily 
followed than price increases in tight oligopolies. Some recent research focuses 
on the way in which prices respond to changes in costs and demand. Overall, 
there is evidence of asymmetric price adjustment, with quicker adjustment to 
increases in cost and reductions in demand than to changes in the opposite 
directions (Peltzman, 2000; Genovese, 2003; Bils and Klenow, 2004; Álvarez and 
Hernando, 2005; Davis, 2007). There is also evidence of a positive relationship 
between industry concentration and price rigidity (Carlton, 1986; Eucaouna 
and Geroski, 1986).
Sweezy’s basic assumption that price increases will not be followed and that 
price cuts will, has been challenged. A price cut need not send signals to rivals 
that a firm is aggressively seeking to capture a larger market share. Rivals may 
reason that the firm’s product is of lower quality, or the firm has financial prob-
lems. Rivals react according to how they interpret the price cut. Likewise, price 
increases may be followed if firms believe market conditions warrant such an 
increase, or if they face temporary capacity shortages and are unable to meet 
increases in demand. In times of increasing demand and possible price infla-
tion, producing any additional output increases costs substantially for a firm 
approaching capacity (Bronfenbrenner, 1940; Efroymson, 1955). Accordingly, a 
capacity-constrained firm may be eager to follow a rival’s price rise and reluctant 
to follow a price cut, which would only increase demand further.
Price leadership
Models of price leadership or parallel pricing are yet another type of oligop-
oly model, in which the firms recognise their interdependence. It is frequently 
observed that firms in oligopolistic markets change prices in parallel. One firm 
announces a price change, and the other firms rapidly follow.
Dominant price leadership
In one class of price leadership model, dominant price leadership, it is assumed 
that the industry is dominated by one firm, owing to its superior efficiency (lower 
costs), or perhaps its aggressive behaviour. The firm sets the price and other firms 
follow passively, whether through convenience, ignorance or fear. In fact, there 
is no oligopoly problem as such, since interdependence is absent.
In Figure 7.14, it is assumed that there is one large dominant firm, and a com-
petitive ‘fringe’ comprising a large number of small firms. The dominant firm is 
the price leader, and sets the market price. The competitive fringe are the follow-
ers. These firms are price-takers and each firm faces a perfectly elastic demand 
function at the price set by the dominant firm. It is assumed that the dominant 
firm has complete information regarding its own demand and cost functions, as 
well as those of its smaller competitors.
In Figure 7.14, DTOTAL is the market demand function. SFRING is the total 
supply function of the competitive fringe, obtained by summing the marginal 
cost functions of each firm in the competitive fringe horizontally. Each firm in 
the competitive fringe maximises profit by producing the quantity at which price 

	
	
	
7.5  The kinked demand curve and models of price leadership	 |	
189
Figure 7.14  Dominant firm price leadership
equals marginal cost. Therefore the horizontal sum of all of the marginal cost func-
tions represents the total quantity supplied by the competitive fringe at any price. 
To obtain DLEADER, the residual demand function of the dominant firm, subtract 
the quantity supplied by the competitive fringe at any price from the total mar-
ket demand function at that price. Therefore DLEADER = DTOTAL - SFRINGE.  
Notice at A, SFRINGE = DTOTAL, so DLEADER = 0. At B, SFRINGE = 0, so 
DLEADER = DTOTAL. Beyond B, the leader operates along DTOTAL, so over the 
entire range of output levels the leader’s demand function is ABC. The kink 
in this demand function at B implies the leader’s marginal revenue function 
(MRLEADER above B) has a discontinuity at B.
The dominant firm maximises profit by choosing the output at which 
MRLEADER equals MCLEADER, the dominant firm’s marginal cost function. The 
dominant firm’s price and output are (P1, q1). At a price of P1, the output of 
the competitive fringe is q2. Total industry output equals Q = q1 + q2. By con-
struction, q2 = Q - q1, because the horizontal distance between DTOTAL and 
DLEADER equals SFRINGE.
Barometric price leadership
Barometric price leadership exists where a firm announces a price change that 
would, in time, be set by the forces of competition. It is simply the first to 
announce the price change. The leader is not necessarily the dominant firm, and 
the leader does not necessarily have any market power with which it could impose 
its will on others, as in the dominant firm price leadership model. Indeed, one 
would expect the identity of the leader to change from time to time. The leader 
acts as a barometer for the market and, if it fails to interpret market signals cor-
rectly, leadership will soon pass to some other firm.

190	
|	 7    ■    Oligopoly: non-collusive models
Markham (1951) suggests barometric price leadership is of two types: the com-
petitive type and the (more dangerous) monopolistic type, known as effective or 
collusive price leadership. The more benign, competitive type is characterised by:
■ frequent changes in the identity of the leader;
■ no immediate, uniform response to price changes: followers take their time to 
consider the suitability of a price change implemented by the leader;
■ variations in market share.
Effective or collusive price leadership is characterised by:
■ a small number of firms, all relatively large;
■ substantial entry barriers;
■ limited product differentiation, reinforcing the firms’ awareness of their 
interdependence;
■ low price elasticity of demand, deterring price-cutting;
■ similar cost functions.
These characteristics are not too dissimilar to the characteristics of successful 
cartels (see Chapter 8). When the agreed price leader changes its price, the other 
firms immediately follow. There is no overt or explicit collusion: all firms act 
independently. However, they realise it is better to cooperate tacitly in an orderly 
market than to slide into the anarchy of a price war. Nevertheless, the effect is 
similar to explicit price fixing. ‘The monopolistically barometric form of price 
leadership is dire, and it may serve all the ends of a strong trade association or a 
closely knit domestic cartel’ (Bain, 1960, p. 198).
Seaton and Waterson (2013), observing the duopoly behaviour of UK super-
markets suggest a further subdivision of price leadership. There is the upward 
price leadership, characterised by regular price increases which are then followed 
about two weeks later by the other firm. Downward price leadership is the oppo-
site. They find that the larger firm tends to lead upward whilst the smaller rival 
has a tendency for downward price leadership.

Summary
The fewness of the firms is the chief defining characteristic of oligopoly. The cen-
tral problem of oligopoly focuses on the recognition of the firms’ interdependence 
when they are few in number. Interdependence implies each firm is aware its actions 
affect the actions of its rivals. There are as many different models of oligopoly as 
there are assumptions about how firms behave when faced with this situation of 
interdependence. It is often suggested that the solution to the oligopoly problem 
is one of two extremes: either pure independent action, or pure collusion where all 
scope for independent action is extinguished. In reality both independent action 
and collusion are matters of degree and the great majority of cases fall somewhere 
between these two extremes. However, Chapters 7 and 8 are structured in accor-
dance with this traditional dichotomy. Chapter 7 dealt mainly with models of 
independent action; in Chapter 8 the emphasis shifts towards collusion.

	
	
	
7.6  Summary	 |	
191
The Cournot duopoly model is the earliest theory of output determination in 
oligopoly. Cournot assumes the firms maximise their own profit subject to the 
constraint that the other firm’s output is fixed at its current level; or, equiva-
lently, both firms select their outputs so as to maximise profit subject to a zero 
conjectural variation assumption. Zero conjectural variation is equivalent to the 
behavioural assumption that leads to what is known in game theory terminology 
as a Nash equilibrium. Under this assumption, the Cournot duopolists achieve 
a market equilibrium that lies somewhere between the polar cases of monopoly 
and perfect competition. Other possible solutions to the model of output deter-
mination under duopoly include: Chamberlin’s model of joint profit maximiza-
tion; Stackelberg’s leader–follower model; and Stackelberg disequilibrium, in 
which both firms simultaneously behave aggressively, leading to overproduction 
and a price war.
In the Bertrand and Edgeworth models of price determination under duo-
poly, there is a zero conjectural variation assumption with respect to price. Both 
firms maximise their own profit subject to the constraint that the other firm’s 
price is fixed at its current level. In Bertrand’s model, the firms’ output levels are 
unconstrained. Edgeworth considers the implications of a production capac-
ity constraint. These models recognise the possibility that oligopolistic markets 
may deliver outcomes such as intense price competition (Bertrand) or perpetual 
instability with no determinate market equilibrium (Edgeworth). In contrast, the 
kinked demand curve model suggests price under oligopoly may become ‘sticky’; 
while models of price leadership suggest that one way for oligopolists to deal with 
their situation of interdependence is to delegate responsibility for price-setting to 
a single dominant firm or price leader.
It should be apparent from Chapter 7 that oligopoly can generate many pos-
sible outcomes. It seems that almost anything can happen in oligopoly, from 
outright collusion to bitter price wars. As a result, some economists (for example, 
Rothschild, 1947) have suggested that oligopoly theory is indeterminate. The 
consensus, however, is still largely in favour of developing better theory and 
better models.
But it would be misleading to conclude that we cannot develop theories 
which predict oligopolistic conduct and performance with tolerable 
precision. A more constructive interpretation is this: to make workable 
predictions we need a theory much richer than the received theories of 
pure competition and pure monopoly, including variables irrelevant 
to those polar cases. In our quest for a realistic oligopoly theory we 
must acquire Professor Mason’s ‘ticket of admission to institutional 
economics’, at the same time retaining the more sharply honed tools with 
which economic theorists have traditionally worked.
(Scherer, 1980, p. 152)
Nevertheless, it is still the case that there is no clear and unambiguous solution 
to the central issue of interdependence. Firms and individuals may react in many 
different ways, and this is reflected in the large number of models examined in 
this chapter.

Introduction
Collusion between firms attracts much attention from the public, the press and 
government. One manifestation of collusion is price-fixing. An example of the 
power a cartel has on increasing prices is the International Coffee Agreement 
between 1965 and 1989. Igami (2015) estimated that prices of coffee beans were 
75 per cent above a Cournot-competitive level and there was a $12 billion transfer

from consumers to producer countries. The ‘coffee crisis’ of the early 1990s was 
80 per cent due to the collapse of the cartel agreement. Price-fixing is easily rec-
ognised as having adverse consequences for consumer welfare.
[P]eople of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment  
and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the 
public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.
(Smith, 1776, p. 128)
However, price-fixing in order to boost profitability is not the only reason for 
firms to collude. For a group of oligopolists, collusion may represent a way of 
dealing with the uncertainties that would otherwise arise due to their situation of 
interdependence. Collusion may be simply a means of easing competitive pres-
sure and creating a manageable operating environment through unified action, 
rather than necessarily a strategy for maximizing joint profits. A central theme 
of this chapter is that many collusive agreements are highly unstable. History is 
littered with examples of cartels that have eventually broken down, often because 
individual members have succumbed to the temptation to act selfishly in pursuit 
of private interests, rather than adhere to arrangements aimed at furthering the 
collective interest of group members.
The chapter begins in Section 8.2 with a discussion of the principal forms 
that collusion may take. Section 8.3 focuses on the institutions that help shape 
and determine collusion. To assume that all collusion is organised through 
the medium of cartels is an oversimplification. Alternative vehicles, including 
trade associations, joint ventures and state-sponsored collusion, are considered. 
­Section 8.4 examines economic models of cartel behaviour. Some models are 
based on assumptions of joint profit maximization. Others focus on issues aris-
ing when cartel members bargain over the allocation of production quotas or the 
distribution of joint cartel profits. Section 8.5 considers factors other than joint 
profit maximization that may motivate firms to explore avenues for cooperation. 
Section 8.6 discusses aspects of market structure that are conducive to collusion 
and the formation of cartels. Finally, Section 8.7 examines factors that affect 
cartel stability or instability. As well as standard market structure variables, 
these include the effectiveness of mechanisms for monitoring compliance and 
punishing non-compliance on the part of cartel members, and some sociological 
and psychological factors that are sometimes ignored in the economics literature.

Collusive action and collusive forms
In the idealised free market, all firms are assumed to act independently in their 
desire to seek the highest economic return. However, as we saw previously (see 
Chapter 7), in oligopolies characterised by interdependence and uncertainty, 
firms may seek to avoid taking independent action. The uncertainties and risks 
associated with independent action provide a spur for the firms to participate in 
some form of collusive arrangement.

197
Unlimited competition may be a fine thing from the point of view of the 
political philosopher speculating about the welfare of people, but surely it 
is a nuisance from the point of view of most businessmen. There may be 
a few hardy individualists among them who enjoy vigorous competition 
as long as they are stronger than their opponents, can take pride in their 
success, and make enough money for comfort. But those that are losing 
ground and those that are losing money, or fear that they may lose, and 
all those who prefer an easy life to one of strain and strife – the majority, 
I dare say – regard unrestrained competition as an uncivilized way of 
doing business, unnecessarily costly of nervous energy and money, and 
disruptive of friendly relations with their fellow men.
(Machlup, 1952a, p. 434)
Collusion is best seen as a way of easing competitive pressure through unified 
action, rather than purely as a strategy to maximise joint profits. It has been 
claimed that the collusive solution to the oligopoly problem is often the most 
obvious solution.
Collusion eliminates the uncertainties of independent action and reduces 
the complexities of interdependence: firms no longer need to speculate about 
the likely reactions of rivals. Throughout the world, competition authorities are 
never short of work in investigating the sharper end of collusive practices. It 
therefore seems probable that the weaker forms of collusion are widespread. 
Tacit collusion is a term often used to describe a collusive outcome that requires 
no formal agreement and no direct communication between firms. Tacit col-
lusion may develop through personal contacts, a group ethos, or live-and-let-
live attitudes. Personal and social contacts among competitors lessen rivalrous 
attitudes: perhaps one does not undercut or poach customers from people with 
whom one socialises. Social groupings, whether by social class, ethnic origin 
or even religion, may help stabilise an otherwise potentially unstable collusive 
arrangement. This feeling of belonging can be strengthened by the existence 
of trade associations, trade journals, conferences, social activities and passive 
investments in rival firms (Gilo et al., 2006). Tacit collusion may also develop 
through deliberate pricing strategies such as price leadership models discussed 
in Section 7.5, and low-price guarantees. Arbatskaya et al. (2006), by examining 
the retail price of tyres, test whether tacit collusion is facilitated by the existence 
of low-price guarantees as a way of discouraging rivals from cutting their prices. 
Where ‘price-matching’ guarantees exist, prices tend to be higher than where 
an alternative ‘price-beating’ guarantee is used. The former is interpreted as 
conducive to tacit collusion to keep prices relatively high.
Forms of collusion based on explicit agreements include verbal and written 
agreements. A widely quoted example of the former is the so-called Gary Dinners, 
hosted by Judge Gary, president of US Steel, between 1907 and 1911. Leaders of 
the steel industry met socially, but also used the opportunity to negotiate verbal 
agreements concerning pricing and production strategies. The colluders believed 
that they were operating within the law, as long as no formal agreement existed. 
Written agreements can be regarded as forms of explicit collusion. These may

be characterised as formal contracts, stipulating rights and obligations, sanc-
tions, fines, deposition of collateral and so on. Case studies 8.1 and 8.2 describe 
examples of cartels.

EU fines truckmakers a record €2.93bn for 
running 14-year cartel
FT
Europe’s largest truckmakers are facing lawsuits from haulage groups across the conti-
nent after admitting to involvement in a 14-year price-fixing cartel as a result of which 
they were fined a record total of €2.93bn. Five companies—Iveco, DAF, Volvo/Renault, 
Daimler and MAN—fixed prices for their vehicles and worked together to delay the 
introduction of emissions technology, according to Margrethe Vestager, EU competition 
commissioner.
As a result, on Tuesday, four of them were handed the largest cartel fine in EU 
­history—more than double the previous record—following a five-year investigation that 
began in 2011. MAN, as the whistleblower in the case, avoided a penalty that would 
have been €1.2bn. ‘It pays off to denounce a cartel,’ noted Mrs Vestager. Volvo, Iveco 
and Daimler had their fines reduced by co-operating with the investigation. Following 
the announcement of the fines, the companies have three months to pay. Scania, owned 
by VW Group, faces the same charges but has decided not to settle with the EU and is 
still being investigated. Now, the companies face the prospect of expensive lawsuits from 
their customers, who overpaid for their trucks for more than a decade. In total, Europe 
has 600,000 haulage companies, many of them small businesses.
Earlier, Ms Vestager had said: ‘It is not acceptable that MAN, Volvo/Renault, Daimler, 
Iveco and DAF, which together account for around 9 out of every 10 medium and heavy 
trucks produced in Europe, were part of a cartel instead of competing with each other.’ 
They formed the cartel in 1997 when ‘senior managers’ from the groups met in a ‘cosy 
hotel’ in Brussels to discuss working together, according to the EU. Senior managers then 
met frequently ‘at the fringes of trade fairs and other events’ until 2004, when the opera-
tions of the cartel became more ‘official’. ‘The contacts between competitors became more 
formalised; they exchanged information over email,’ the EU said. Their co-ordination 
‘lasted for a very long time’, only ceasing when EU investigators began a probe in 2011.
They colluded in three areas, the EU found. First, the ‘gross list’ price of the trucks—
which is the price when the trucks leave the factory, and the benchmark for negotiations 
with haulage operators. Second, they delayed introducing new technology in the vehicles 
‘to comply with the increasingly strict European emissions standards’. Third, when the 
trucks did contain the new emissions features, the companies fixed the price premium that 
was added to the cost of the trucks when selling to customers.
Volvo/Renault face a fine of €670.4m after gaining a 40 per cent reduction for co-
operation, and a further 10 per cent for agreeing to settle. Daimler faces the steepest fine 
of €1bn, although this has been reduced by 30 per cent for co-operation and 10 per cent

for settlement. Iveco will pay €494.6m, which has been cut 20 per cent for co-operating 
and settling. DAF, which is owned by Paccar and did not co-operate with the investi-
gation, faces a €752.7m fine. This also includes a 10 per cent reduction for agreeing to 
settle. Before the EU announcement, four of the companies—Iveco, DAF, Volvo and 
Daimler—had between them set aside €2.85bn to cover the costs of penalties.

Top UK model agencies accused of price fixing by watchdog
FT
It is better known for investigating cartels and mergers among airlines, banks and energy 
companies. But the UK’s competition watchdog is now taking on the agencies behind 
some of the world’s most famous catwalk models.
Five of London’s top model agencies—FM Models, Models One, Premier, Storm and 
Viva—have been named in an inquiry into price collusion by the Competition and Markets 
Authority. The watchdog said on Wednesday that in a two-year period to March 2015, the 
agencies ‘agreed to exchange confidential, competitively sensitive information, including 
future pricing information, and in some instances agreed a common approach to pricing’.
Models One is the biggest modelling agency in Europe and has represented everyone 
from Twiggy, the 1960s model, to Yasmin Le Bon. Storm, set up with backing from Sir 
Richard Branson, has acted for Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne. The Association of 
Model Agents, also named as a party to the alleged infringement, was used as a ‘vehicle 
for price co-ordination’, the CMA said. The industry body is accused of ‘regularly and 
systematically circulating to its members emails, known as “AMA Alerts”, encouraging 
model agencies to reject the fees being offered by specific customers and to negotiate a 
higher fee’. The watchdog conducted morning raids at several of the agencies to collect 
evidence, according to people familiar with the situation. It can impose significant penal-
ties of up to 10 per cent of turnover, depending on the seriousness and duration of any 
infringement, and any decision could also lead to damages claims from clients.
Stephen Blake, senior director of the CMA’s cartels and criminal group, said: ‘The 
allegations concern prices charged to a range of customers, including high street chains, 
online fashion retailers and consumer goods brands. The CMA alleges that these five 
model agencies sought to achieve higher prices in negotiations with their customers by 
colluding instead of competing.’
The trust buster described the AMA as ‘a vehicle for price co-ordination’. That is con-
sistent with the famous comment of Adam Smith: ‘People of the same trade seldom meet 
together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy

Collusive institutions
This section examines various institutions that have been set up to promote and 
organise cooperation between producers. These include cartels, trade associa-
tions, joint ventures, semi-collusion and state-sponsored collusion.
Cartels
The term cartel derives from the German word Kartelle meaning a producers’ 
association. Perhaps the simplest and most concise definition is suggested by 
Liefmann (1932), who views cartels as associations with monopolistic aims. The 
notion of monopolistic intent has caused much controversy. The term monopoly 
has emotional connotations, which may blur a reasonable description of collec-
tive action. The monopolistic intent of cartels may be seen simply as a corollary 
of any restrictions imposed upon unfettered competition (Piotrowski, 1932).
Cartels are associations of independent firms in the same industry that impose 
restraint upon competition. Cartels are often associated with actions taken by 
small groups of firms determined to exploit their market power to the full; 
alternatively, firms join cartels mainly for reasons of self-defence or protection 
(Hunter, 1954). Agreements tend, on the whole, to impede entry or the develop-
ment of new products that might threaten the profitability or survival of incum-
bent firms. Price-fixing seems only to be of secondary importance, usually as a 
means to support the less efficient members (Fog, 1956; Asch and Seneca, 1976). 
Nevertheless, evidence suggests that overcharges arising from cartel agreements 
are substantial (Connor, 2014; Boyer and Kotchoni, 2015).
Some observers have tried to classify types of cartel. For example, OECD 
(1965) identifies no fewer than seven types: price cartel, quota cartel, allocation 
cartel, standardization agreement, specialization agreement, costing agreement 
against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.’ A spokesman for the CMA 
declined to say whether the inquiry had been triggered by an industry whistleblower. 
A lawyer who has acted for one of the companies named said he believed a tip-off had 
come from an online fashion store. Neither the CMA or the store would comment on 
the claim. The lawyer said the agencies were trying to protect the pay and conditions of 
young models, who were often exploited by the big brands, sometimes did not speak good 
English, and had no trade union to represent their interests.
Fashion is one industry where women are often paid more than men, with a top model 
earning as much as £30,000 for a single appearance on the catwalk. But the big money is 
earned from fronting an advertising campaign for one of the big global brands. According 
to Forbes magazine, in 2014 Cara Delevingne earned $9m.

and rebate agreement. Wilcox (1960) identifies four main categories according 
to the methods employed: cartels that control the conditions surrounding a sale; 
cartels that control costs, prices and profit margins; cartels that allocate territories 
or customers; and cartels that award members fixed shares in the industry’s total 
productive capacity. Many cartels fall under more than one of these headings.
Trade associations
A cartel is an organization formed by firms in an oligopoly in an attempt to 
foster cooperation. Many cartels seek to enhance the market power of a group 
of producers through combined action. There is a fine dividing line between a 
cartel and a trade association. Trade associations that attempt to improve the 
economic situation of their members do not necessarily require market power in 
order to achieve their aims.
Trade associations can be enormously helpful to their memberships. 
They can expand and upgrade education and consumer information 
programs, launch new research and development programs, encourage 
ethical business practices and communicate the viewpoint of business 
in the political forum.
(Clanton, 1977, p. 307)
One of the chief functions of a trade association is to provide members with 
industry data on sales, productive capacity, employment, creditworthiness of 
customers, quality of products and innovation. They also promote activities 
intended to reduce inefficiency and promote better relations with customers, 
trade unions and government. To achieve this goal they publish trade journals, 
stimulate cooperative research programmes, instigate market research surveys, 
define trade terms and recruit lobbyists.
The dividing line between legitimate and collusive action is open to interpre-
tation. For example, moves to standardise output could be interpreted either 
as a legitimate policy to improve product quality, or an illegitimate vehicle for 
price-fixing by reducing the ability of firms to price differentially. The popularity 
of price reporting systems or open price associations, through which members 
inform each other, as well as outsiders, of current and future product prices, 
reached a peak in the US in the early years of the twentieth century through the 
formation of open price associations, defined as follows:
an organization which provides a medium for the exchange of business 
information among members of a given industry whereby they may 
arrive at an intimate acquaintance with competitive conditions as they 
exist among themselves and in the whole industry.
(Nelson, 1922, p. 9)
Nelson (1922) sees these organizations as distinct from other trade associations, 
characterised by fairly loose structures and more general aims. Nelson quotes the 
case of the American Hardwood Manufacturers’ Association, which was quite

open in its price deliberations, inviting customers, the press and any other inter-
ested parties to its meetings. Price-reporting schemes or open price associations 
might be justified on the grounds that they promote fair competition: informa-
tion is an essential lubricant for competitive markets. But on the other hand, a 
price-reporting agreement could simply provide a form of cover for price-fixing.
If a price-reporting scheme is intended to promote competition, it should 
be neither doctored nor prevented from being disclosed to all parties including 
buyers. Comments or suggestions as to likely future pricing policy should not 
accompany such reports, which should be neutral and informative. In practice, it 
is doubtful whether trade associations can always divorce themselves from self-
interest in this manner. Mund and Wolf (1971) suggest agreements can be toler-
ated if they are limited to closed transactions. Reported prices should be actual 
prices. To report quoted prices could increase pressure from the more dominant 
or militant members to standardise all prices. If waiting periods are stipulated 
(so each member undertakes to maintain the price for a given period), open price 
agreements are tantamount to price-fixing (Machlup, 1952b). A waiting period 
allows firms to set a price, confident in the knowledge that rivals will not imme-
diately reduce their prices. Marshall et al. (2007) examine price announcement 
effects in the vitamin industry during periods when a cartel operated and at other 
times when there was no cartel. When the cartel operated there was typically a 
time-lag between the public announcement and the implementation of a price 
change, but in the absence of the cartel there was typically no delay.
In general, the impact of trade associations on competition is uncertain. If a 
trade association does not itself help foster collusion, it might provide a conve-
nient stepping-stone towards full-blown collusion, perhaps by gathering, process-
ing and disseminating the information that subsequently forms the basis of an 
agreement. However, any advantages stemming from the circulation of informa-
tion on prices may be undermined by the use of price data to reinforce and police 
collusion. It is difficult to generalise, and a case-by-case approach is required to 
establish the direction taken by any particular trade association.
Joint ventures, semi-collusion and state-sponsored collusion
A joint venture is an association between two or more otherwise competing firms. 
Joint ventures might take the form of a consortium or a syndicate, although the 
latter is generally limited to the fields of banking and insurance. Consortia are 
usually established when firms undertake speculative activities, for which the risk 
is sufficiently high to discourage individual involvement. In so far as joint ven-
tures prevent or distort competition by coalescing the interests of several firms, 
they are similar to cartels. In some cases, however, joint ventures may stimulate 
innovation by enabling projects to proceed that would not otherwise be feasible. 
Alternatively, joint ventures may enable a group of new firms to band together 
and overcome entry barriers.
Joint ventures have often been sponsored by governments and international 
bodies. ‘[European] Community action must . . . create an environment or con-
ditions likely to favour the development of cooperation between undertakings’ 
(European Commission, 1985, p. 34). In a later report, however, the European

203
Commission (1997a) is concerned that this type of cooperation could inhibit 
competition. It identifies three main reasons why firms are keen to form joint 
ventures: to combine their resources in such a way as to increase efficiency; to 
enter a new market; and to develop joint research and development programmes. 
Only the latter motive appears justified on efficiency grounds. Not all joint ven-
tures result in cooperation. Partnerships such as joint ventures and strategic alli-
ances may encounter difficulties when managers behave non-cooperatively, so as 
to advance the private interests of their own firms (Minehart and Neeman, 1999). 
The issue is how best to design contracts that encourage managers to maximise 
joint (partnership) profits.
Semi-collusion occurs in cases where it is difficult to formulate specific agree-
ments covering all aspects of the firms’ behaviour. For example, agreements 
covering research and development, advertising and capital investment strategies 
may not be possible, because it is too difficult to monitor compliance. Accord-
ingly, it has been suggested that firms may opt to collude in some activities and 
compete in others. Matsui (1989) argues that if collusion takes place in the prod-
uct market, but there is competition in other areas of activity, firms may be worse 
off and consumers better off. In a study of Japanese cartels in the 1960s, Matsui 
argues that firms accumulated excess capacity in the belief that cartel quotas 
would be based on capacity. The combination of cartelization and excess capac-
ity led to increased output and reduced profits. Similar conclusions are reached 
by Steen and Sørgard (1999) and Roller and Steen (2006), with reference to the 
Norwegian cement industry. However, Brod and Shivakumar (1999) show that 
where the non-production (competitive) activity is research and development, 
the welfare effects might be either positive or negative.
The discussion of cartels has concentrated on private, voluntary organizations 
that are free of government control or intervention. State-sponsored collusion is 
a further variation. Governments may either meet the demands of a group of 
producers, or they may impose cartelization on reluctant firms. The justification 
might be to promote rationalization, as in Britain and Germany in the 1930s, 
or to encourage ‘orderly marketing’: the objective behind the UK’s Agricultural 
Marketing Acts of 1931 and 1933.

Profit-maximizing models of price and output 
determination for a cartel
Suppose all of the firms in an industry are members of a centralised cartel, which 
has complete control over price and output decisions. It is assumed that each 
firm produces an identical product. However, the firms’ cost functions need not 
necessarily be identical. Finally, it is assumed that entry is successfully deterred. 
The maximization of the cartel members’ combined profit is essentially a problem 
of joint profit maximization, with the cartel firms seeking to act collectively as if 
they were a single monopolist.
Figure 8.1 shows a three-firm model. The cost functions of firms A, B and D 
are shown in the first three diagrams, reading from left to right. The industry 

204	
|	 8    ■    Oligopoly: collusive models
marginal cost function shown in the right-hand-side diagram is obtained by sum-
ming the three firms’ marginal cost functions horizontally. Joint profit maximi-
zation is achieved by choosing the industry output at which marginal revenue 
derived from the industry average revenue function equals the industry’s marginal 
cost. This output level is QM, and the corresponding price is PM. The individual 
production quotas of firms A, B and D are qA, qB and qD, and by construction 
QM = qA + qB + qD. The total cost of producing QM is minimised by allocating 
quotas in such a way that the marginal costs of each firm, when producing its 
own quota, are the same (Patinkin, 1947). Suppose the quotas were such that the 
cost to firm D of producing its last unit of output was higher than the cost to firm 
A of producing its last unit of output. Then it would be profitable to reallocate 
some of firm D’s quota to firm A. This would be true until the marginal costs 
are brought into equality. It can be seen from Figure 8.1 that the least efficient 
producer with the steepest marginal cost function, firm D, is assigned a smaller 
quota than the more efficient producers, firms A and B.
A second joint profit-maximizing model examines the case where an industry 
consists of two groups of firms: a group that forms a cartel, and a group of non-
cartel firms. The total number of firms is N, and the number of firms that form 
the cartel is K; therefore there are N – K non-cartel firms. There are assumed to 
be large numbers of small firms in both groups. In this model, it is assumed that 
all firms produce an identical product, all firms have identical cost functions 
and entry is successfully deterred. Finally, price-taking behaviour on the part of 
the non-cartel firms is assumed. The model is similar to the dominant firm price 
leadership model that was introduced in Section 7.5.
The diagram on the right-hand-side of Figure 8.2 shows the non-cartel firms’ 
collective marginal cost function, obtained by summing the non-cartel firms’ 
individual marginal cost functions horizontally. Because the non-cartel 
firms are price-takers, their collective marginal cost function can be interpreted 
as their supply function. The middle diagram shows the cartel firms’ collec-
tive marginal cost function, also obtained by summing their individual mar-
ginal cost functions horizontally. The middle diagram also shows the residual 
demand function for the cartel firms, obtained by subtracting the non-cartel 
firms’ total supply at each price from the industry demand function. The cartel 
Figure 8.1  Joint profit maximization in a three-firm cartel

	
	
	
8.4  Profit-maximizing models of price and output determination for a cartel	 |	
205
firms maximise their joint profit by choosing the output level Q1, at which the 
residual marginal revenue equals the cartel firms’ collective marginal cost. The 
cartel firms’ output decision also determines the industry price, P1, obtained 
from the cartel firms’ residual demand function at Q1. Returning to the right-
hand-side diagram, the non-cartel firms’ total output when the price is P1 is Q2. 
Total industry output is Q1 + Q2, which by construction equals the industry 
demand when the price is P1.
Finally, the diagram on the left-hand-side of Figure 8.2 compares the out-
puts and profits of an individual cartel firm and a non-cartel firm. These can be 
drawn on the same diagram because it is assumed that both firms have identical 
cost functions. As shown in the middle diagram, for the cartel firm the joint 
profit-maximizing price of P1 exceeds marginal cost. Each individual cartel firm 
produces q1 = Q1/K units of output. Each non-cartel firm is a price-taker, and 
produces q2 = Q2/(N - K) units of output, at which price equals marginal cost. 
This means the non-cartel firm produces more output than the cartel firm. The 
non-cartel firm also earns a higher profit than the cartel firm. In the diagram 
on the left-hand-side of Figure 8.2, the difference in profit is represented by the 
shaded area between P1 and MCi over the output range q1 to q2.
This comparison between the profits of the cartel and non-cartel firms has 
important implications for the theory of cartels. In Figure 8.2, the cartel firm 
deliberately reduces its output to raise price and earn a higher profit. However, 
the non-cartel firm also benefits from the increased price, but without bearing 
any burden in the form of profit foregone as a result of producing a reduced 
output. Essentially, there is a freerider problem. The freeriding non-cartel firms 
earn higher profits than the cartel firms, thanks entirely to the sacrifices made 
by the latter.
This situation may have serious implications for the viability or the stability 
of the cartel. Why should any firm agree to join the cartel if, by doing so, it earns 
a lower profit than it would earn by remaining outside? Clearly, it is better to 
let others bear the burden of reducing their outputs and, meanwhile, sit back

and enjoy the benefit of the increased price. Of course, the difficulty is that if 
all potential cartel members think in this way, the cartel may never be formed. 
Moreover, even if the cartel has already been formed, its stability is threatened 
by the possibility of defection or cheating. In Figure 8.2, each cartel member 
knows that by increasing its output from q1 to q2, it can increase its profit by an 
amount represented by the shaded area. If the number of cartel members is large 
and only one firm defects, the effect of this additional output on the profits of 
the remaining loyal cartel members might be quite small. The remaining cartel 
members may be prepared to tolerate the situation, since the costs of disciplining 
the recalcitrant firm might exceed the profits that would be recouped. However, 
it is possible that more than one firm could defect, in which case the cartel could 
quickly disintegrate. If all cartel members simultaneously increase their outputs, 
the market ends up at the competitive price and output, with all firms earning 
only a normal profit.
And this is the first difficulty of forming a cartel. Every firm would prefer 
to be the outsider, and yet if enough stay outside, the cartel becomes futile: 
a large group of free riders will find that the streetcar won’t run.
(Stigler, 1966, p. 233)
D’Aspremont et al. (1983) discuss an important qualification to these conclusions 
concerning the freerider problem and cartel instability. In the model shown in 
Figure 8.2, suppose N, the number of firms, is small rather than large (see also 
Donsimoni et al., 1986). In this case, any decision by a cartel firm to break the 
cartel agreement has a non-negligible effect on the profits of both the cartel firms 
that remain loyal and the non-cartel firms. In the model shown in Figure 8.2, a 
decision by one cartel firm to withdraw from the cartel and produce q2 rather 
than q1 would shift the non-cartel supply function to the right and the cartel 
residual demand and marginal revenue functions to the left. This would reduce 
the equilibrium price, and reduce the profits of both the cartel and the non-cartel 
firms. Before any defection takes place, the profit of a non-cartel firm always 
exceeds the profit of a cartel firm. However, this does not rule out the possibility 
that the post-defection profit of the cartel firm that defects is less than its pre-
defection profit when it was still part of the cartel.
Accordingly, for a firm considering leaving the cartel or defecting, the relevant 
comparison is not between the current profits of a cartel firm and a non-cartel 
firm. Instead, the relevant comparison is between the current profit of a cartel 
firm and the adjusted (post-defection) profit of a non-cartel firm. There are two 
conditions for the stability of the cartel. First, there is internal stability if no 
cartel member can increase its profit by leaving the cartel; and second, there is 
external stability if no non-cartel firm can increase its profit by joining the cartel. 
D’Aspremont et al. (1983) show that a cartel that is both internally and externally 
stable can always be achieved if the number of firms is finite. A corollary is that 
the greater the number of firms in the industry, the smaller the effect of any one 
firm’s actions on price and profits, and the greater the likelihood that any cartel 
agreement will turn out to be unstable.

Apart from the freerider problem and cartel instability, two remaining dif-
ficulties may be encountered in forming a cartel (Stigler, 1966). The first, which 
also derives from the freerider problem, is that of potential or actual entry. If 
entry is not successfully deterred, and outside firms are attracted by the relatively 
high cartel price, industry output increases and price falls, destroying the cartel. 
The cartel may have to modify its pricing policy in order to exclude potential 
entrants; or alternatively, seek some form of accommodation with actual entrants 
(Patinkin, 1947).
The other difficulty is administrative: how should the output quotas be deter-
mined and profits divided? In theory, and as shown in Figure 8.1, the quotas 
should be determined so as to ensure the marginal costs of all cartel firms are 
equal. However, this implies that each firm earns a different profit. Low-profit 
firms might not be willing to accept such an outcome. One solution might be to 
introduce a system of side-payments to compensate low-profit earners. This solu-
tion implies complex negotiations, monitoring and sanctions for non-­compliance. 
The administrative costs might outweigh the benefits. Alternatively, quotas could 
be set at suboptimal levels (different from those necessary to maximise joint 
profits) to make mutual compliance more likely. For example, quotas might 
be fixed as a percentage of each firm’s capacity, or quotas might be fixed as a 
percentage of pre-cartel output levels. This type of arrangement might also lead 
to instability. Firms might invest unnecessarily in spare capacity, or they might 
increase their outputs unnecessarily shortly before the agreement takes effect, to 
obtain a larger quota.

Other motives for collusion
Section 8.4 shows that the higher profits resulting from the exercise of near-
monopoly power by a cartel can be described by traditional microeconomic mod-
els of the firm. This section examines a number of other motives for collusion in 
general, and for the formation of cartels specifically.
Risk management and the enhancement of security
In some cases, the reduction of risk may be the principal motive for collusion. 
Some of the earliest writers emphasise this point. ‘[I]t is the pressure of risk which 
first arouses producers to the possibilities of another method of organization’ 
(MacGregor, 1906, p. 46). The nature of risk is twofold. First, risk arises from 
changes in consumer tastes.
No method of industrial organization will standardize the consumer. His 
demand for even such routine goods as food and clothing changes both 
quantitatively and qualitatively by accidents of time, place and value 
of money. Even a whole industry must face these changes, and provide 
whatever defences may lessen their influence.
(MacGregor, 1906, p. 51)

Second, risk results directly from competition between producers. In the absence 
of any central control, firms may tend to overproduce, driving price below aver-
age cost.
The market may be able to bear the increment of supply caused by 
himself [the firm]; but not an equivalent increment from all his rivals, if 
they retaliate by his own means, or if even they communicate panic to 
each other. This is the road which leads to crises.
(MacGregor, 1906, p. 52)
The firm might attempt to escape from these risks by developing market power 
independently through product differentiation, product innovation or vertical 
integration (strategies that are explored in subsequent chapters of the book). 
However, all such strategies are costly and uncertain. Collusion represents an 
alternative method for reducing risk.
Liefmann (1932) sees the development of collusion as resulting from the 
increased divergence between what he calls the ‘risk of capital’ and the ‘profit of 
capital’. Mass-production technology raises the risk to entrepreneurs’ fixed capi-
tal, if they are unable to keep their plants in continuous operation. Entrepreneurs 
also risk their working capital if they are unable to find sufficient customers for 
their finished goods. Due to these pressures, entrepreneurs had experienced a 
steady erosion of profit. This divergence reached a critical point when the capital 
risks could no longer be offset by profit. However, neither the pre-war nor the 
more recent evidence necessarily supports this view. Industries prone to rigorous 
competition are not always made up of sickly firms, limping their way towards 
collusive agreements. ‘[C]laims that competition has cut-throat and destructive 
propensities, and hence that cartelization [collusion] is warranted, deserve to be 
taken with several grains of salt’ (Scherer and Ross, 1990, p. 305).
Another possible source of risk and uncertainty is a firm’s reliance on large 
orders that are placed infrequently (Scherer and Ross, 1990). Such orders may 
make tacit collusion more difficult, and force firms to consider explicit collusion. 
Any price reduction from some tacitly agreed norm involves a cost in the form 
of lower future profits, owing to retaliation from rival firms. This cost is inde-
pendent of the size of the order, but the short-term gain depends on the order 
size. Undercutting is more likely if orders are large and irregular than if they are 
small and regular. Furthermore, firms that operate with short time horizons are 
likely to accept the immediate gain from a price reduction and be unconcerned 
about future retaliation. Firms with large overheads or excess capacity may also 
be tempted to break ranks and breach a tacit price agreement. In the US cast-iron 
pipe, electrical equipment and antibiotics industries, large and infrequent orders 
led to the formation of ‘bidding cartels to restrain industry members’ competitive 
zeal’ (Scherer and Ross, 1990, p. 307). Kumar et al. (2015) argue that when firms 
are contemplating a merger they also have to consider the likely impact on the 
procurement policies of their buyers. Buyers may be unsettled by such a change 
and turn to other competing suppliers. In this case the benefits of organizing a 
cartel outweigh those from a merger.

The degree of collusion attributable to risk in an industry is difficult to mea-
sure. High risk may bring about collusion, but the intended result of collusion 
is the reduction of risk. Ambiguity as to the direction of causation is inevitable. 
Asch and Seneca (1975) measure risk as the standard deviation of the residuals 
from a time trend fitted to each firm’s time-series profit data, but find little evi-
dence of causation in either direction.
An alternative view is that the firm attaches importance to its relative posi-
tion when all producers in the industry are ranked in descending order of their 
market shares. Any move towards the guarantee of position through collusion is 
attractive. Perfect competition and monopoly, as polar cases, are not concerned 
with positioning. In contrast, an oligopolist may be acutely aware of its own 
market share, which may define its status within the industry. The oligopolist 
may wish to increase its market share, or at least ensure that its market share is 
not eroded. Maintaining or improving position is therefore a central objective in 
the oligopolist’s strategic decision-making.
Exchange of information
Many of the factors that motivate collusion are associated with uncertainty. 
Accordingly, such concerns might be reduced by the provision of useful market 
information, which may itself be a powerful motive for collusion. O’Brien and 
Swann (1969) develop a theory of information exchange. All firms require infor-
mation on which to base their decisions. The importance of information depends 
on the degree of interdependence, or on the extent to which firms are vulnerable 
to damage by the actions of rivals. Firms are most vulnerable when undertaking 
investment, which involves long-term, and possibly irreversible, financial com-
mitments. It may be in the interests of all firms that each firm invests wisely, since 
miscalculations that create excess capacity may lead to price-cutting or other 
panic measures, threatening industry stability.
The type of information required, its timing (pre- or post-notification) and 
the means of communication (oral or written; trade gossip or more formal, 
detailed memoranda) depend on the required degree of stability. Regular, strict 
pre-­notification agreements, identifying individual parties and their terms of 
sale, produce greater uniformity and stability than information that is supplied 
informally or intermittently. Information exchange reduces firms’ vulnerability 
and increases industry cohesion, enabling firms to react more consistently and 
efficiently when some potentially destabilizing event occurs. Firms become more 
sensitive to one another and more aware of their positioning in terms of market 
share. By itself, sharing information may drive firms towards more coopera-
tive forms of behaviour. Firms that cooperate in this manner may not wish to 
threaten industry stability with overtly competitive behaviour.
Unsatisfactory performance
Firms are naturally concerned with profitability. Years of poor profitability, per-
haps caused by intense competition and frequent price-cutting, may eventually 
prompt firms to explore the possibility of establishing an accommodation with 

210	
|	 8    ■    Oligopoly: collusive models
rivals. This type of pressure forced the American Plumbing Fixtures Manufac-
turers to develop price-fixing agreements in the 1960s. The price conspiracy was 
rationalised by the executives of the 15 companies involved as not “‘gouging” 
the public, just seeking an adequate profit’ (Fortune, 1969, p. 96). Profits may 
also be low as a result of depressed demand conditions for a particular product 
or industry. The frequently quoted price agreements in the American bleachers, 
electrical equipment and pipe industries all followed periods of decline and poor 
performance at industry level. ‘Certain economic conditions – depressions, reces-
sions, or downward movements in industry demand – provide both a favourable 
climate and a powerful incentive for conspiracy’ (Erickson, 1969, p. 83).
Asch and Seneca (1976) estimate the effect of collusion on the profitability of 
US manufacturing corporations between 1958 and 1967. They also reverse the 
causation to examine the effect of profitability on the level of collusion. They 
find an inverse relationship between the level of collusion and profitability. This 
is consistent with the hypothesis that unsatisfactory profits encourage collusion. 
However, an alternative explanation is that their sample was largely made up of 
collusion-prone firms. Since the data were based on unsuccessful examples of 
collusion, poor collusive performance was likely to be discovered. The bleacher 
manufacturers earned low profits during the Second World War, owing to their 
inability to obtain steel and other materials. Collusive price and tendering agree-
ments could not resolve the underlying problem of supply shortages. Conse-
quently, these agreements were unstable.
A firm’s growth record can also reflect its profitability. Asch and Seneca (1975) 
suggest that growth and profits can be correlated, and growth might be included 
among the factors encouraging firms to collude. Firms in a declining industry 
are perhaps more likely to collude in an attempt to restore profitability to some 
historical level. Declining industries may also see the breakdown of orderly mar-
keting, or other forms of tacit collusion, as firms attempt to undercut rivals in a 
desperate bid to maintain their own profitability. This sudden indiscipline may 
encourage firms to search for more explicit or specific forms of collusion.
	
8.6	
Factors conducive to cartel formation
This section identifies factors that influence whether the firms in an industry are 
likely to be able to succeed in forming a cartel. These include the degree of seller 
concentration and the number of firms in the industry, the degree of similarity 
in the firms’ cost structures, product characteristics and market shares, and the 
extent to which firms are vertically integrated. Finally, under a transaction costs 
approach to the theory of the firm, the ease with which firms are able to collude 
depends primarily on the nature of the transaction costs incurred in negotiating 
and policing a collusive agreement.
Seller concentration and the number of firms
A common hypothesis is that firms find it easier to collude in industries with 
small numbers of firms, or high levels of concentration. This hypothesis is 
based on theories of group and coalition behaviour which suggest that, as 

	
	
	
8.6  Factors conducive to cartel formation	 |	
211
numbers increase, the unanimity of goals diminishes. With a dilution of una-
nimity, the group incurs heavier bargaining, monitoring and enforcement (or 
transaction) costs.
Phillips (1962) and Scherer and Ross (1990) provide a theory of the effect 
of numbers on the extent of collusion. First, as the number of firms increases, 
the contribution of each firm to total output decreases, and the firms become 
more likely to ignore their interdependence. Second, as the number of firms 
increases, there is more temptation for a rogue firm to undercut the agreed 
price, as it perceives a low risk of detection. Finally, since firms often have 
different views as to the optimal cartel policy, communication and negotia-
tion between firms is required to reconcile differences. Coordination becomes 
more difficult as numbers increase. In the absence of a central agency or trade 
association, the number of channels of communication is N(N 9 1)/2. One 
channel will suffice for two firms, but six are required for four firms, and 15 
for six firms. A breakdown in any one channel may precipitate retaliation, 
and the resulting disruption may extend far beyond the two parties originally 
responsible.
The importance of concentration and the number of firms seems to be con-
firmed by the empirical evidence. Levenstein and Suslow’s (2006) survey indi-
cates that there is widespread empirical evidence of an association between 
high concentration and the extent of collusion. However, a difficulty that arises 
with any empirical study is that the instances of collusion that are identified 
may be the ‘inefficient’ ones, which are caught and prosecuted. Other cases 
may remain undetected, either by the antitrust authorities or by researchers. 
High concentration indicates that the fringe of non-colluding firms is relatively 
small, and may be tolerated. If the non-colluding fringe makes serious inroads 
into the cartel members’ market shares, however, defensive strategies such as 
price-cutting may be instigated. In the case of Laker Airways, an early low-
cost airline which failed in 1982, the liquidator alleged (and for the most part 
was subsequently vindicated by the US courts) that the major airlines (British 
Airways, Lufthansa, Swissair, Pan Am and TWA) had conspired to drive Laker 
out of business by cutting fares.
If a sizeable fringe of firms cannot be induced to join a cartel, there is little 
chance of success in maximizing joint profits. Armentano (1975) finds that price-
fixing conspiracies in the electrical equipment industry were always threatened 
by a fringe of low-quality producers, which regularly undercut the nationally 
agreed price. There are many cases in which high seller concentration did not 
lead to collusion, or there was no significant relationship between the number of 
firms and the level of collusion (Asch and Seneca, 1975; Dick, 1996; Symeonides, 
2003). Although very high concentration might lead to tacit collusion, at slightly 
lower levels of concentration a more explicit form of collusion is required as 
numbers increase. An industry comprising only three or four firms may be able 
to organise itself informally, but if new firms enter, tacit collusion may no longer 
suffice. Fraas and Greer (1977) suggest that in the polar case of two firms with 
an identical product, explicit collusion is possible but hardly necessary. At the 
opposite extreme, with many firms selling differentiated products, explicit col-
lusion is desirable (for joint profit maximization) but hard to achieve. Explicit 
collusion is most likely in intermediate cases.

Similar cost functions
Firms with similar cost structures find it easier to collude than those with pro-
nounced differences in costs. A firm faced with an average cost function that 
decreases as output increases may be reluctant to restrict its output as a condition 
of cartel membership. In the absence of side-payments to offset the opportunity 
cost incurred by membership, the firm may be reluctant to join the cartel in the 
first place. Furthermore, a requirement to restrict output might run counter to a 
smaller firm’s ambition to eventually overtake the larger producers. Obviously 
this can only be achieved by growth in sales, and not by moves to restrict sales 
(Rothschild, 1999). If quotas are determined by the cartel on the basis of equal 
percentage reductions from prior competitive output levels, unequal shares of 
cartel profits will accrue to firms with different marginal cost functions. The 
formation of the uranium cartel in 1980 rested on recognition that there was a 
wide variety of deposits, of different depths and thicknesses, and consequently 
widely differing marginal costs (Rothwell, 1980). Quotas, devised to ensure an 
equitable distribution of cartel profits, were an important precondition for the 
formation of a cartel.
Similar market shares
MacGregor (1906) suggests that if most of the firms in an industry are similar 
in size, the likelihood of successful collusion is enhanced. Other symmetries 
conducive to collusion might include similar patterns of firm evolution, simi-
lar technologies, similar product ranges and similar productive capacities. If 
market shares are symmetric, it is possible that the large firms have already 
eliminated the smaller firms through competition. Asymmetric market shares, 
on the other hand, are likely to be associated with a divergence of views 
between the large and the small firms (Schmalensee, 1987; Harrington, 1989, 
1991). Small firms may be reluctant to adopt quotas based on existing mar-
ket shares, while large firms may collude with each other to enhance their 
(collective) dominance. Compte et al. (2002) consider a situation in which 
colluding firms have similar costs and produce similar goods, but have dif-
ferent capacities. Firms with spare capacity are tempted to defect from a 
price-fixing agreement, while firms with limited capacity are unable to issue 
credible threats to punish defectors.
However, asymmetry in market shares could enhance the ability of a few large 
firms to initiate and enforce a profitable agreement by means of price leader-
ship (see also Section 7.5). Davies and De (2013) state that ringleaders play an 
important role in ensuring cartel stability in agreements involving larger numbers 
of different-sized firms. Phillips (1962) suggests that unequal market shares can 
help create a degree of stability and order. Price leaders have the authority to 
enforce cooperative behaviour, while followers are aware that as higher-cost 
producers, they can easily be punished by the leaders through price cuts. Verti-
cally integrated leaders can also punish the followers by impeding their access 
to inputs or markets.

	
	
	
8.6  Factors conducive to cartel formation	 |	
213
Similar products
Similar products (or a lack of product differentiation) may be another factor 
conducive to successful collusion. Firms selling similar goods need only focus on 
a narrow range of pricing decisions. If many characteristics contribute to (either 
real or perceived) product differences, it becomes difficult to achieve agreement 
over price.
Switching costs are costs incurred when a buyer switches between suppliers, 
but not incurred when remaining with the original supplier. Effectively, switch-
ing costs make similar products more heterogeneous, as a buyer is no longer 
indifferent between the two suppliers. Switching costs include: transaction 
costs incurred when changing a bank or internet service provider; compatibility 
costs incurred when changing products that are linked to one another, such as 
­Microsoft ­Windows and Office; and the learning costs incurred in using a new 
product or service (Klemperer, 1995). Switching costs reduce the incentive for 
producers to join or adhere to cartel agreements (NERA, 2003).
Even similar products may be supplied under varied conditions and specifica-
tions. For example, while a product such as steel springs for upholstery seems to 
be fairly homogeneous, the price list used by the Spring and Interior Springing 
Association (Office of Fair Trading Register, Agreement 1132) records over 400 
separate prices, according to height, thickness of spring, alloys used, status of buyer 
and so on (Lipczynski, 1994). Negotiating, monitoring and renewing such an array 
of prices is inevitably a complex task. Furthermore, if product characteristics are 
subject to change over time, perhaps due to technological progress or evolving 
consumer tastes, a price agreement is more difficult to negotiate and sustain.
Measuring the relationship between the degree of product differentiation 
and the level of collusion is a difficult task. Asch and Seneca (1975) distinguish 
between producer and consumer goods industries on the grounds that the former 
are more homogeneous than the latter. The expectation is that collusion is more 
likely in producer goods industries. Symeonides (1999) suggests product differen-
tiation achieved through investment in advertising or research and development 
tends to frustrate collusion, since low-quality producers are less likely to collude 
with high-quality producers.
Kantzenbach et al. (1995) modify the general conclusion that product dif-
ferentiation inhibits successful collusion. High product differentiation may have 
implications primarily for the form of collusion, rather than the ability to con-
clude an agreement at all. Firms might abandon price-fixing, but still segment 
the market by product type or geography. In this case successful collusion is 
possible, because in segmented markets price elasticity of demand tends to be 
low, and punishment is not costly if price cuts are required in only a few market 
segments (Davidson, 1983; Ross, 1992). Petrikaite˙ (2016) argues that search costs 
are lower for homogeneous goods than for differentiated ones. The greater the 
transparency, the greater the chance that consumers are less ignorant, which 
makes a cartel less stable. When faced with differentiated goods, consumers incur 
search costs, which lead to less transparency and more ignorance. This leads to 
greater cartel stability.

Vertical integration
A successful cartel requires member firms to be reassured that fellow members 
are abiding by the terms of the agreement. Effective monitoring is important. 
If one member is vertically integrated downstream, perhaps with ownership of 
retail outlets, it may be able to undercut the cartel price by reducing its transfer 
price to its own retailers. Unless other cartel members are fully aware of the true 
cost structure of the retail business, they may be unaware that the cartel agree-
ment is being undermined.
Transaction costs and collusion
Under Williamson’s (1975) transaction costs approach to the theory of the firm 
(see also Box 1.1 and Section 5.3), collusion is viewed primarily as a problem 
of contracting. Collusive agreements may or may not be lawful, but in either 
case participants cannot rely on the courts to enforce agreements. Therefore 
firms must develop their own armoury to ensure compliance and punish non-­
compliant behaviour. The ease with which collusion can be established and sus-
tained through contractual arrangements depends on a number of factors:
■ The ability to specify contractual relations correctly. It is difficult to formulate 
a comprehensive statement of obligations and responsibilities. Any such state-
ment requires information on the production costs of each firm, the nature of 
the product, the permitted levels of expenditure on research and development 
or innovation, as well as the ‘interaction effects between the decision variables 
within and between firms’ (Williamson, 1975, p. 244). Not only is this informa-
tion expensive to gather, interpret and transform into specific policies for each 
firm, but also it is necessary to formulate these policies for an unknown future 
context. If the contract is to be comprehensive, all future contingencies must 
be anticipated.
■ The extent to which agreement can be reached over joint gains. Even if joint profit 
maximization can be specified contractually, a number of problems imme-
diately arise. Joint profit maximization might require the reduction of some 
firms’ output and the expansion of others. Those firms faced with demands to 
reduce their output may be reluctant to agree to, or tolerate, any reduction in 
their market share. These firms may fear that if the agreement were to break 
down, they would be left in a less powerful position than the position they 
occupied before the agreement.
■ Uncertainty. The agreement is also subject to uncertainty. Firms must agree 
on how to adapt to changes in the economic environment. This may require 
costly renegotiation if the firms subsequently discover new opportunities to 
profit from such changes.
■ Monitoring. Individual firms may not be able to detect fellow conspirators’ 
price cuts. In Williamson’s terminology, information is impacted, giving rise 
to opportunistic behaviour. Monitoring is necessary to detect and deter non-
compliance with the cartel agreement. Monitoring and policing an agreement 
are more complex in cases where there are non-price forms of competition.

	
	
	
8.7  Influences on cartel stability	 |	
215
■ Penalties. Successful collusion must eventually rest on the availability of effec-
tive sanctions against firms that fail to comply with the terms of the agreement. 
In the absence of legal protection, the cartel must impose its own penalties 
through the market. For example, cartel members might retaliate by reducing 
their own prices to the level set by the non-compliant firm; or by ceasing inter-
firm cooperation; or by head-hunting the non-compliant firm’s key employees. 
The success of such penalties depends on the effectiveness of the deterrent as 
well as the willingness of the loyal firms to impose penalties. The enforcers 
(the loyal cartel members) also incur costs by introducing sanctions. Indeed, 
some of these firms might also defect and secretly assist the non-compliant 
firm, if they feel the benefits of so doing outweigh the costs they incur through 
enforcement.
Some theorists view collusion as an attempt to increase market power, and 
to treat successful cartels as effective monopolies. In contrast, Williamson’s 
approach clearly emphasises a key distinction between monopoly and oligopoly, 
with the former avoiding but the latter incurring transaction costs of contracting 
to achieve market power.
The monopolist . . . enjoys an advantage over oligopolists in 
adaptational respects since he does not have to write a contract in which 
future contingencies are identified and appropriate adaptation thereto 
devised. Rather, he can face the contingencies when they arise; each 
bridge can be crossed when it is reached, rather than having to decide 
ex ante how to cross all bridges that one may conceivably face.
(Williamson, 1975, p. 245)
	
8.7	
Influences on cartel stability
Impermanence appears to be a characteristic of most, if not all, cartels. Ironi-
cally, those agreements that have lasted for longer durations may have been 
among the least effective in promoting joint profit maximization. The funda-
mental reason so many cartels fail to live up to expectations is that what appears 
optimal for the group as a whole may not be optimal for each member individu-
ally. Therefore, bargaining is required to find a form of agreement that reconciles 
this divergence of interests.
Fellner (1965) believes the fundamental reason for the instability of coor-
dinated action is that the bargaining strengths of members tend to change in 
unpredictable ways. For an agreement to remain effective, the group must create 
outlets for these changes. Individual firms might be permitted some freedom to 
introduce new product lines or experiment with new cost-saving technologies, but 
mutually damaging competition might still break out from time to time. Since 
firms are aware of this possibility, they might decide to maintain some spare 
productive capacity. However, this might directly contravene one of the require-
ments for joint profit maximization, namely, the elimination of spare capacity. 
This section examines factors that tend to frustrate long-term cooperation.

216	
|	 8    ■    Oligopoly: collusive models
Seller concentration and the number of firms
Section 8.6 argued that high seller concentration and small numbers of firms 
are factors conducive to cartel formation. The same factors may also affect the 
stability of a cartel after it has been formed, particularly if effective communica-
tion and monitoring are easier when numbers are small. With small numbers, in 
the event that non-compliance is detected, retaliation is likely to be quicker and 
more effective. If there are long timelags prior to retaliation, the short-term gains 
from non-compliance may outweigh the long-term costs; if timelags are short, the 
opposite applies. Experimental research suggests that cartel stability is affected 
by the number of firms (Huck et al., 2001).
It is widely assumed that cartels are threatened by competition from outside 
firms. Non-cartel firms earning profits higher than those of cartel members may 
tempt members to desert the cartel, undermining its existence (Posner, 1976; Kleit 
and Palsson, 1999). In an analysis of agreements at the Office of Fair Trading 
(OFT), however, Lipczynski (1994) finds that some cartels are able to tolerate 
sizeable portions of the industry remaining outside the cartel.
Different goals of members
If a cartel comprises a heterogeneous collection of firms, it is probable that 
individual members have differing goals. Conflicting objectives might remain 
lightly buried in the interests of group solidarity but might resurface at any time. 
Members may disagree over issues such as the balance between short-run and 
long-run profit maximization, the regard that should be paid to potential com-
petition, or how best to respond to changes in government policy. Tensions may 
also arise due to expectations that market shares, at the inception of a cartel 
agreement, remain fixed. Some firms however may be growth-focused and thus 
there is an inherent conflict with those who prefer a quiet life. This was the 
conclusion Harrington et al. (2015) reached when analysing the collapse of the 
German cement cartel in 2002. The literature on cartels contains numerous 
other examples of conflict among members.
Fog (1956) suggests that larger firms often tend to seek stable, long-run poli-
cies, while smaller firms are more interested in exploiting short-run opportunities. 
Pindyck (1977) finds that some members of the International Bauxite Association 
in Australia, faced with high transport costs and excess capacity, were tempted to 
sell bauxite outside the cartel. In US Major League Baseball, some team owners 
appear to be less concerned with profit maximization than others:
Agreement within the cartel is also hampered by the fact that not all 
members are profit maximizers. Some owners view baseball as largely a 
sporting activity, with profitability at most a secondary concern. Even 
today, teams like the Red Sox and the Cubs behave quite differently 
from teams like the Dodgers. Given the relatively small size of the cartel 
and the protected positions of its members, this divergence of goals 
tends to produce instability.
(Davis, 1974, p. 356)

The process of cartel formation and the assignment of quotas
It is possible that the process of cartel formation might have implications for sta-
bility. Prokop (1999) develops several game-theoretic models of cartel formation, 
in which firms decide whether to join the cartel or remain on the non-cartel fringe 
either sequentially or simultaneously. Cartel stability is shown to be more likely 
if decision-making is sequential rather than simultaneous. A similar conclusion 
was reached in the discussion of the likelihood of players behaving cooperatively 
in a sequential game in Section 7.6.
Osborne (1976) argues that the assignment of production quotas when the 
cartel is established can have important implications subsequently for its stabil-
ity. This argument is illustrated in Figure 8.3, based on the isoprofit curves and 
reaction functions diagrams that were developed previously (see Section 7.3). 
At any point on the line QMQM, the combined output of firms A and B equals 
the profit-maximis\ing output for a monopolist, QM. At all points on QMQM, 
the firms maximize their joint profits, but the quotas assigned to each firm vary 
between different points on QMQM. At F, firm A takes the larger share of output; 
at H, B takes the larger share; while G is an intermediate case. If the two firms 
are identical and the model is symmetric, at G both firms are assigned an equal 
quota of 1/2QM.
Starting from any of points F, G and H, there is an incentive for either firm to 
cheat by raising its output, if it believes the other firm will not retaliate. If firm 
A increases its output while firm B’s output is unchanged (moving ‘east’ from F, 
G or H), A increases its profit; or if B increases its output while A’s output stays 
unchanged (moving ‘north’ from F, G or H), B increases its profit.

Suppose, however, the rules or established practices of the cartel are such 
that if one firm cheats by increasing its output, the other firm punishes it by also 
increasing its output, until the market shares implied by the quota agreement are 
restored. In this case, a decision by either firm to cheat would invite retaliation, 
resulting in a diagonal shift up the rays OX, OY or OZ, along which the market 
shares of both firms are the same as at points F, G and H, respectively.
An examination of the implications of diagonal shifts up the rays OX, OY and 
OZ demonstrates the importance for cartel stability of the initial quota assignment. 
Beginning from G and moving up OY, both firms experience a decrease in profits. 
Therefore, if retaliation of the kind described above is anticipated, neither firm has 
an incentive to cheat. If the quotas are assigned such that the firms locate at G, 
the cartel is stable. However, beginning from either F or H, the cartel is unstable. 
Beginning from F and moving up OX, A’s profit increases while B’s decreases, so 
A has an incentive to cheat. Similarly, beginning from H and moving up OZ, B’s 
profit increases while A’s profit decreases, so B has an incentive to cheat.
Notice that at F and H, it is the firm with the larger initial quota (firm A at F, 
and firm B at H) that has the incentive to cheat. This is because the retaliation 
always restores the original quotas. For example, beginning from F, at which A 
has the larger market share, a large increase in output by A only provokes a small 
increase by B, so overall A gains and B loses. Diagrammatically, the condition 
for cartel stability is that the ray from the origin should be tangential to the two 
isoprofit curves at their point of tangency on the line QMQM. This condition is 
satisfied at G, but it is not satisfied at either F or H.
In a comment on Osborne’s study, Holahan (1978) demonstrates that when 
there are differences between the firms’ profit functions, retaliation along the lines 
suggested by Osborne to restore the original quotas may leave the retaliating firm 
worse off. Rothschild (1981) examines further the conditions under which retali-
ation is damaging to the retaliating firm. Retaliation may be damaging even in 
the case where the firms have identical profit functions. Osborne’s prescription of 
retaliation to restore the original quotas in the event of cheating is effective only 
under certain conditions, which depend on the number of firms, their initial out-
put levels, and the size of the increase in output by the firm that decides to cheat.
Non-price competition
A cartel is likely to be unstable if there are significant opportunities for non-price 
competition. Little purpose is served by agreeing to fix prices if, soon afterwards, 
intense non-price competition between cartel members breaks out in the form of 
expensive rival advertising campaigns, or the simultaneous launch of new and 
competing brands. Symeonides (2003) reports evidence for the UK of a negative 
relationship between the level of advertising and the degree of collusion.
Monitoring and detection of cheating
Stigler (1964) argues that collusion is successful when it is accompanied by effi-
cient mechanisms for monitoring compliance with the agreement. The most 
effective method for detecting secret price-cutting might be to check transaction

219
prices in the market. Stigler argues that evidence of cheating can be inferred 
by observing unexpected changes in the market shares of individual firms. If a 
firm discovers that it is systematically losing business it would normally expect 
to secure, it might infer that another cartel member is guilty of price-cutting. 
The greater the degree of regular variation in the cartel firms’ market shares, 
the greater the potential for secret price-cuts, since it is more difficult for loyal 
firms to detect suspicious changes in their market shares. Collusion is more effec-
tive where actual transaction prices are correctly reported, as in government 
contracts. Collusion is less effective where the identity of the buyers changes 
frequently. Effectiveness varies inversely with buyer and seller numbers.
Stigler’s approach can be criticised in several respects. Implicitly, Stigler 
assumes the threat of detection is a sufficient deterrent. The non-compliant firm 
incurs no penalty other than that of having to discontinue its non-compliance 
(Yamey, 1970). By concentrating on the detection of non-compliance, many 
other aspects of collusion are ignored.
[Stigler] takes as given that the collusive agreement has already been 
reached. Attention is focused instead on cheating and on statistical 
inference techniques for detecting cheaters. While this last is very useful 
and calls attention in an interesting way to aspects of the oligopoly 
problem that others have neglected, it is also incomplete . . . monitoring 
is only one of a series of contracting steps, and not plainly the one that 
warrants priority attention.
(Williamson, 1975, p. 244)
Levenstein and Suslow (2006) suggest that the existence of a joint sales agency 
plays an important role in determining the success of a cartel. An agency reduces 
the discretionary powers of individual firms with respect to pricing, output and 
distribution.
Sanctions
The ability of a cartel to impose effective sanctions if cheating occurs is another 
important determinant of cartel stability. If additional profits can be realised 
through non-compliance, then non-compliance probably will occur unless some 
policy of deterrence is adopted. ‘It is surely one of the axioms of human behaviour 
that all agreements whose violation would be profitable to the violator must be 
enforced’ (Stigler, 1968, p. 42). The ability of a cartel to discipline its own members 
for breaches of agreement is essential, as the courts cannot be used to enforce an 
illegal contract. Punishment can be effected either by taking action that reduces 
the demand for the non-compliant firm’s product, or by increasing its costs (Ayres, 
1987). Increasing costs may be difficult, but reducing demand is often straightfor-
ward. Accordingly, a common sanction is the matching of price cuts.
Rees (1993a) finds that in a British salt-producers’ duopoly, any gain from 
cheating was outweighed by losses from credible short-term price cuts. ­Levenstein 
(1996, 1997) also observes the effective use of short-term price-cutting in the 
bromine cartel prior to the First World War. However, in some cases the cartel 

220	
|	 8    ■    Oligopoly: collusive models
members may not wish to disturb the market by instigating a retaliatory price 
war, and would instead prefer to accommodate cheats and absorb any loss of 
rent (Bergenstock et al., 2006).
Sealed bidding provides a useful mechanism for ensuring detection if a 
firm breaks a cartel agreement. Sealed bid competition occurs when a buyer 
(frequently the government) requests bids for a contract, and subsequently 
announces the result publicly. The firms submit their bids secretly. The bidding 
firms might decide to meet to consider their bids, and perhaps decide which firm 
will win the contract. If a firm should cheat by submitting a lower bid than has 
been agreed, it will be detected when the winning bid is announced.
In a study of restrictive practices in the food trade, Cuthbert and Black (1959) 
document the use of fines and expulsion as direct sanctions for firms in breach of 
a cartel agreement. Fines were sometimes heavy, while expulsion implies the loss 
of any advantage from cartel membership. This might be serious if, for example, 
raw material suppliers cooperate with the cartel and agree not to supply non-
members. A cartel might use the services of third parties to deter cheating. A joint 
sales agency through which all output is channelled should prevent price-cutting, 
although problems of allocating the proceeds between the cartel members might 
surface. Finally, the threat or use of physical force might be an effective means 
of encouraging compliance (Kuhlman, 1969).
Buyer concentration
It seems plausible that cartel stability should be enhanced if buyers lack market 
power or if buyer concentration is low. Buyers with market power may threaten 
agreed prices by switching to alternative suppliers, or by suggesting reciprocal trans-
actions with individual producers. ‘[T]he better organised and more efficient are the 
other groups with which an interfirm organization has conflict relations, the greater 
the tendency for rivalry within the interfirm organization’ (Phillips, 1962, p. 35).
Snyder (1996) and Dick (1996) find evidence that large buyers encourage 
suppliers to deviate from cartel agreements. When an industry supplies a small 
number of large buyers, orders are often large and infrequent. Under these con-
ditions, it is tempting for parties to a collusive agreement to defect by offering 
secret price reductions, in an effort to secure these valuable contracts. In such 
cases it may be difficult for other cartel members to detect and punish defection.
The relevance of big buyers to coordinated interaction does not stem from 
their sophistication or self-proclaimed ability to protect themselves. Instead, 
the issue is whether sellers will have the incentive to deviate from terms of 
coordination because the gains from securing a large long-term contract 
outweigh any losses from being caught after the fact.
(Dennis, 1992, p. 9)
On the other hand, if buyers are atomistic, defection becomes more difficult: the 
more buyers there are, the greater the chance of being found out. ‘No one has yet 
invented a way to advertise price reductions which brings them to the attention 
of numerous customers but not to that of any rival’ (Stigler, 1968, p. 44).

Fluctuations in demand
A reduction in total demand may place strains on a cartel agreement (Haltwanger 
and Harrington, 1991; Briggs, 1996; Fabra, 2006). As demand falls, firms are 
tempted to undercut the cartel price in a bid to protect their sales volumes. This 
temptation need not affect all firms equally. Some may regard the drop in sales as 
temporary and may urge others to keep their nerve; others may view the decline 
as a real threat to their futures and will consider any strategy for survival. A 
climate of mutual suspicion and uncertainty may eventually cause the cartel to 
break apart. In the sense that they must adapt to fluctuating demand, cartels are 
no different from individual firms. If they fix prices, they have to make accom-
modating changes in production and employment. If they fix output quotas, they 
have to accept the burden of fluctuating prices. No cartel has complete control 
over demand, and history is full of instances of cartels and agreements that col-
lapsed in the face of fluctuating demand.
If cartel members have spare capacity or if fixed costs are a large proportion of 
total costs, the cartel is likely to be unstable. If demand is falling, the temptation to 
cut price in an attempt to increase output and cover the fixed costs is strong. The 
existence of spare capacity might allow for greater stability, so long as the capacity 
is under the control of loyal cartel members. By adjusting production and price as 
demand conditions fluctuate, a dominant cartel member can use spare capacity to 
maintain order and discipline in the market. The behaviour of Saudi Arabian crude 
oil producers has been quoted as evidence for this hypothesis (Youssef, 1986). For 
such a strategy to be effective, however, the costs of maintaining spare capacity must 
not be excessive. It is questionable whether such a strategy is often applied in practice.
Posner (1976) argues collusion may be more difficult to enforce in times of 
increasing demand. In an expanding market, a firm being undercut by rivals 
may not immediately detect that cheating is occurring, since its own sales are 
rising (Ellison, 1994; Bagwell and Staiger, 1997; Rotemberg and Saloner, 1986). 
Rey (2002) suggests collusion is easier in times of expanding demand, as current 
profits are lower than future profits. In this case, the long-term costs imposed 
by rivals’ retaliation should exceed the short-term benefits gained from non-
compliance with the agreement.
Porter (1983) and Green and Porter (1984) argue cartel breakdowns occur 
when there is an unanticipated change in demand, evidenced by unusually low 
market shares for at least one firm, rather than a general long-term decline in 
demand. Demand can vary for a number of predictable reasons. However, at 
some critical level, when no rational explanation can be deduced for the falling 
sales, firms will take action. If the price drops below a certain level (a trigger 
price), firms that have previously been maximizing joint profits may revert, for 
a time, to Cournot-type competition (see Section 7.3).
Entry
In the long run, the stability and profitability of collusion depends on the 
ease or difficulty of entry. If a cartel shelters behind effective entry barriers, it 
may enjoy the necessary time and space to prosper and resolve the conflicting 
demands of its members. If entry barriers are low, the cartel faces competitive 

222	
|	 8    ■    Oligopoly: collusive models
pressure from potential entrants. If a cartel has agreed to fix the price above the 
competitive level, there is an incentive for an entrant to move in and set a price 
just below the cartel price, encroaching on the profits of group members. In the 
most extreme case, unrestricted entry will lead to the destruction of the cartel. 
The survival of the cartel may therefore require implementation of measures to 
raise entry barriers, or policies that increase the time required to achieve suc-
cessful entry. Entry barriers are examined in Chapter 12. Entry-type threats to 
cartel stability need not emanate only from rival firms, and the development 
of new products could have similar destabilizing implications.
Competition law
In most countries, competition law threatens the stability of cartels (see also 
­Chapter 24). Since price-fixing is illegal, an effective cartel pricing strategy should 
not create suspicions on the part of customers and the authorities that coordinated 
action is taking place (Harrington, 2004). Detection of anti-competitive practices 
can result in heavy fines and possible loss of public goodwill. Aubert et al. (2006) 
discuss the deterrent effects of leniency programmes, which offer reduced fines for 
firms that present evidence of cartel activities and cooperate with the authorities.
However, analysing 500 American cartels between 1961 and 2013, Levenstein 
and Suslow (2016) find no evidence that the amnesty policy had any impact 
on cartel break-ups. Chen et al. (2015) consider the alternative policy of deny-
ing leniency to the instigators of a cartel. By removing the offer of leniency the 
instigator-firms will be less likely to cooperate with the competition agencies. 
Thus the policy results in greater cartel stability. On the other hand, this effect is 
mitigated by the fact that ringleaders know that their punishment is more severe 
as there is no plea-bargaining option. In this case firms may be reluctant to initi-
ate cartel agreements.
Rewards may also be offered to individuals for providing information. In 
the US, the reward is a share of the fines collected, sufficient to compensate an 
employee for any loss of future earnings. A system of rewards might be struc-
tured so that the cost to the cartel of inducing employees to remain loyal becomes 
greater than the benefit of collusion. It has been argued that the prohibition of 
cartels could result in a market being dominated by an incumbent monopolist. 
Prohibition reduces the threat of entry, as potential entrants will not expect to 
be able to participate in profitable collusive action (Haan, 2007).
Case study 8.3
Predicting cartels
In March 2005, the UK’s Office of Fair Trading published a report which identifies fac-
tors that are conducive to the formation of cartels. The objective of the report is to direct 
regulatory scrutiny towards those markets in which cartels are most likely to exist. The 

	
	
	
8.7  Influences on cartel stability	 |	
223
report’s case studies focus primarily on two industries, shipping and basic chemicals, 
which are examined under a number of themes.
Theme 1: Demand, capacity and intensity of competition. Although demand affects the 
formation and success of cartels, it is often difficult to determine whether demand oper-
ates directly, or through related factors such as excess capacity and falling market prices. 
For example, cross-Channel ferry operators colluded on price after a sterling devaluation 
in 1992 had reduced revenues for the five operators. Although the impact on revenues 
was different, all five responded with an identical ‘currency surcharge’. In petrochemicals 
in 1994, as a result of persistent falling demand, a cartel was organised to tackle excess 
capacity and the exit of vulnerable firms. Products for which cartels were formed as a 
response to intense competition include citric acid in 2002, methionine in 2003, soda ash 
in 2003, and vitamins in 2003.
Theme 2: Barriers to entry. Although the report does not provide any direct evidence 
concerning the relationship between entry barriers and successful collusion, it does sug-
gest that entry may have a disruptive effect on a cartel. The cartel of vitamins producers 
was terminated as a result of strong competition from Chinese importers, who disrupted 
the cartel with low pricing and high volumes. In shipping, the emphasis had always been 
on preventing entry. The ‘liner service’, which transports goods at regular times and on 
specified routes, faces competition from the irregular and non-advertised ‘tramp vessel 
service’. In 1993 the Cewal, Cowac and Ukwal (Shipping Conferences), representing liners 
serving France and West Africa, set up a ‘Fighting Committee’ to determine who should 
sail close to the dates offered by the tramp vessels, at reduced, ‘fighting’ rates. Members 
of the Conferences met the costs of these ‘fighting ships’.
Theme 3: Transparency and communication. A cartel might be considered as a driver for 
greater transparency and enhanced communication concerning sales and prices. In the 
organic peroxide case, frequent meetings were organised by the Swiss consultancy Treu-
hand. They produced ‘pink’ and ‘red’ papers detailing market shares, which were not to be 
removed from Treuhand offices, and the travel expenses of the attendees were reimbursed 
to cover the tracks of the conspiracy.
Theme 4: Size. The case studies confirm the notion that the smaller the number of firms 
in the industry and the higher the level of seller concentration, the easier it becomes to 
set up and sustain a cartel. A cartel is more likely to form if output is homogeneous; if 
turnover is stable over time; and if the leading firms in the industry are relatively large and 
membership of the leading group is stable. For a successful cartel, at least two of these 
three conditions should score highly.
Theme 5: Asymmetry. It is often assumed that differences in the sizes and other char-
acteristics of cartel members tend to create instability; however, the opposite turned 
out to be the case. In citric acid, methionine and the ferry operators’ cartels, for 
example, cartel participants were drawn from a wide variety of social and commercial 
backgrounds.

Non-economic influences on cartel stability
In a classification of influences on cartel stability, non-economic factors such 
as leadership, trust and social background may be relevant (Yamey, 1973). 
Many economists are reluctant to recognise the importance of leadership, which 
perhaps sits more comfortably in the domain of disciplines like organizational 
behaviour or sociology. However, the formation of a cartel requires that some-
one takes the lead and organises discussions and negotiations. People need to be 
persuaded, coaxed or even threatened to join the cartel, and leadership qualities 
are necessary to create and sustain a successful agreement. Likewise, a strong 
personality hostile to the notion of cooperation might prevent the formation 
of a cartel. Trust between cartel members is another important requirement for 
successful collusion. Through the medium of his famous dinners, Judge Gary, 
president of US Steel in the early 1890s, attempted to develop a spirit of coopera-
tion. A firm considering a significant change of strategy would feel duty-bound 
to inform the other firms.
If the participants to an agreement share the same social background, group 
stability is likely to be enhanced. Consider the following account of an American 
electrical equipment conspiracy:
The industry is tightly-knit with many friendships among the executives of 
competing firms; indeed, officials of smaller firms sometimes are former 
General Electric or Westinghouse Electric executives. The men involved 
oftentimes had similar educational backgrounds – college graduates in 
engineering with a rise through technical ranks into the world of sales. 
And the friendships were not only professional but often quite personal. 
Trade association meetings fostered these. It was perhaps easy in the 
camaraderie of these meetings at upper bracket hotels, amid speeches 
typical of any association lauding the industry’s members and ‘mission’, 
to draw even closer than business and background indicated.
(Wall Street Journal, 10 January 1962)
If most owners and managers come from a similar and preferably closely knit 
social background, stability is likely to be enhanced. To cheat on one’s peers is to 
run the risk of suffering not only economic retaliation but also social stigmatiza-
tion. The cheat is branded as an outsider, and denied the support and comfort 
of the social group.
Even where collusion would seem to be unenforceable, a common social back-
ground can help establish effective joint action. Common value systems are also 
built on efficient communications, so that potential or actual conflict can be 
quickly resolved through the auspices of trade association meetings, clubs, lodges 
and so on. However, Phillips (1972) suggests the importance of class and social 
background may tend to diminish over time. Eventually competing firms’ value 
systems tend to converge because they are producing similar products, attract-
ing similar customers or encountering similar technical problems. Consequently, 
rivalry decreases and cooperation increases.

Summary
This chapter has discussed the various methods used by groups of firms to 
facilitate cooperative or collusive actions in pursuit of their collective interests. 
Collusion is best seen as a means of easing competitive pressure and reducing 
the uncertainty that stems from oligopolistic interdependence by taking unified 
action, rather than solely as a strategy for maximizing joint profits. Collusion 
might be effected though the medium of a cartel, but might alternatively take 
place through mechanisms such as trade associations, joint ventures or state-
sponsored agreements.
The prescription in terms of output quotas and pricing policy for cartel mem-
bers to maximise their joint profits is easy to define in theory but often harder to 
implement in practice. For example, the less efficient firms might be required to 
accept relatively low production quotas, and may demand a share of the prof-
its emanating from elsewhere in the cartel as the price that must be paid for 
their compliance. This raises numerous questions about the bargaining process 
between the prospective cartel members, the outcome of which may be theo-
retically indeterminate. Furthermore, if the cartel does succeed in reducing total 
industry output, this creates a freerider problem in the sense that non-cartel firms 
reap the benefits of a higher price, without bearing any of the costs of having to 
produce a lower output. If it is obviously more profitable for an individual firm 
to remain outside the cartel, this misalignment of private and collective interests 
might prevent agreement from ever being reached, or might cause the cartel to 
break down.
The success or failure of collusive arrangements depends on many factors, 
some of which are beyond the direct control of the group of colluding firms. In 
the absence of legal sanctions, what are the factors most likely to determine the 
success or failure of collusion?
■ Fewness of numbers helps in the handling and evaluation of information.
■ Similarity of cost conditions reduces a potential source of conflict.
■ Demand that is relatively inelastic at the pre-cartel price ensures that revenues 
can be increased significantly by reducing output levels and raising price.
■ An equitable and fair mechanism for determining the allocation of production 
quotas and distribution of profits helps make an agreement possible.
■ The smaller the number of decisions required to conclude an effective agree-
ment, the greater is the likelihood of success.
■ Members must perceive that the gains from cooperative action outweigh the 
benefits of private action.
■ Mechanisms for detecting and punishing non-compliance with the terms of 
the agreement should be effective.
■ Higher prices and improved profitability should not attract non-cartel entrants 
into the industry.

226

■ The cartel must guard against other external threats to its stability, including 
significant changes in demand or technology.
■ The quality of leadership and the degree of mutual trust and social cohesion 
among cartel members may be important influences on stability.

9.1	
Introduction
Game theory is an approach to decision-making under conditions of uncertainty 
or situations of conflict, developed by the mathematicians John von Neumann 
and Oskar Morgenstern (1944). Game theory has many applications throughout 
the social, behavioural and physical sciences; and accordingly, its remit is much 
wider than just economics. Nevertheless, its focus on uncertainty, interdepen-
dence, conflict and strategy makes it ideally suited to the analysis of decision-
making in oligopoly. Game theory shows how situations can arise in which firms 
take decisions that may appear rational from each firm’s individual perspective, 
but lead to outcomes that are suboptimal when assessed according to criteria 
reflecting the collective interest of all the firms combined.
A game is a situation in which two or more decision-makers, or players, face 
choices between a number of possible actions at any stage of the game. A game 
that is played only once is a single-period game. A player’s strategy is a set of 
rules telling him which action to choose under each possible set of circumstances 
that might exist at any stage in the game. Each player aims to select the strategy 
(or mix of strategies) that will maximise his own payoff. The players face a situ-
ation of interdependence. Each player is aware that the actions of other players 
can affect his payoff, but at the time the player chooses his own action he may 
not know which actions are being chosen by the other players. In a constant-sum 
game, the sum of the payoffs to all players is always the same, whatever strategies 
are chosen. In a non-constant-sum game, the sum of the payoffs depends on the 
strategies chosen. A zero-sum game is a constant-sum game in which the sum of 
the gains and losses of all players is always zero. A game of poker is a zero-sum 
game: one player’s winnings are exactly matched by the losses of rival players. 
The outcome of a game is the set of strategies and actions that are actually cho-
sen, and the resulting payoffs. An equilibrium is a combination of strategies, 
actions and payoffs that is optimal (in some sense) for all players.
A game in which all players choose their actions simultaneously, before 
knowing the actions chosen by other players, is called a simultaneous game, and 
explored in the first three sections of this chapter. Section 9.2 introduces the con-
cepts of dominance and Nash equilibrium. Dominant strategies are those that are 
either unambiguously superior to, or at least as good as, all other strategies, no 
matter which strategy the other player selects. Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium 
(sometimes known simply as Nash equilibrium) is the game theory equivalent 
of the Cournot–Nash equilibrium in the model of duopoly, in which the two 
firms compete on quantities produced and sold, and both assume that the other 
will stick to its current production plans. In the terminology of game theory, no 
player wishes to depart from his current strategy if the other players continue to 
pursue their current strategies. Section 9.3 examines an important type of game, 
known as prisoner’s dilemma, in which the pursuit of dominant strategies pro-
duces an outcome that is inferior (from the players’ perspective) to the outcome 
that could be achieved if the players were to depart from their dominant strate-
gies. Section 9.4 shows that in some games there is no dominant strategy for any 
player, and no Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium. The concept of a mixed strategy 

230

is introduced, in which players choose their actions randomly in accordance with 
specific probabilities assigned to each action.
A game in which the players choose their actions in turn, so that a player who 
moves later knows the actions that were chosen by players who moved earlier, 
is called a sequential game, discussed in Section 9.5. In a sequential game, some-
times the player who moves first is able to gain an advantage by influencing the 
future direction of the game in their favour. In other cases, the player who moves 
second gains an advantage through observing their opponent’s actions before 
making a decision. In arriving at a solution to a sequential game, a key con-
sideration is the credibility of any retaliatory threats by one player to react in a 
particular manner to a hostile action on the part of another player. A retaliatory 
threat is credible only if the player concerned will still wish to execute the threat, 
if and when the time comes to do so. Players wishing to boost the credibility of 
a retaliatory threat may sometimes take steps that will alter the payoff structure 
in a way that closes off the option of backing down. Other players, recognizing 
that the threat is credible, may decide to hold off from taking the action that 
would trigger execution of the threat. In other words, a retaliatory threat that is 
credible might never be executed.
Finally, a game that is played more than once is called a multiple-period or 
repeated game. A multiple-period game can be repeated either indefinitely, or 
a finite number of times. Section 9.6 shows that in a repeated game with a pris-
oner’s dilemma structure, the players may be able to learn from their experience 
to cooperate by departing from their dominant strategies, with adherence to 
cooperative behaviour reinforced by the threat of punishment in the event that 
cooperation breaks down.
In many ways, the property of interdependence is the key defining character-
istic of a game, and it is this property that makes game theory relevant to an 
understanding of decision-making for firms in oligopoly. However, game theory 
has many applications other than decision-making under oligopoly, including 
strategy and tactics in sports, military strategy and nuclear deterrence. Although 
Chapter 9 discusses some non-economics applications, in most of the game the-
ory examples discussed in this chapter and elsewhere, the players are two or more 
oligopolistic firms. Payoffs are usually defined in terms of the implications for 
the firms’ profitability of the chosen strategies; and strategies are the decisions 
taken by the firms about matters such as price, output, advertising, product dif-
ferentiation, research and development, entry or location.

Dominance and Nash equilibrium
Production game with strictly dominant strategies
As an initial game theory example, Figure 9.1 shows the payoff matrix for two 
firms, A and B, that have to decide simultaneously whether to produce low or 
high levels of output. Firm A’s strategies are denoted Low and High and, simi-
larly, firm B’s strategies are denoted Low and High. The elements in the matrix 
represent the payoffs (for example profit) to the two firms. Both firms’ payoffs 

	
	
	
9.2  Dominance and Nash equilibrium	 |	
231
depend on their own output level and on the output level of the other firm, since 
market price is a function of the combined output levels of both firms. Within 
each cell of Figure 9.1, the first figure is A’s payoff and the second figure is B’s 
payoff. For example, if A selects High and B selects Low, A’s payoff (profit) is 
3 and B’s payoff is 2.
First, consider the choice between strategies Low and High from firm A’s 
perspective. One method A could use to make this choice would be to examine 
which of Low and High is best for A if B selects Low, and which of Low and High 
is best for A if B selects High:
■ If B selects Low, Low yields a payoff of 4 for A, while High yields a payoff of 
3. Therefore if B selects Low, A’s best response is Low.
■ If B selects High, Low yields a payoff of 2 for A, while High yields a payoff of 
1. Therefore if B selects High, A’s best response is Low.
In this game, no matter what strategy B selects, it is best for A to choose Low 
rather than High. Low is said to be a strictly dominant strategy, because it is a 
superior strategy for A no matter what strategy B selects.
Second, consider the choice between strategies Low and High from B’s per-
spective, using a similar approach:
■ If A selects Low, Low yields a payoff of 4 for B, while High yields a payoff of 
3. Therefore, if A selects Low, B’s best response is Low.
■ If A selects High, Low yields a payoff of 2 for B, while High yields a payoff of 
1. Therefore, if A selects High, B’s best response is Low.
Accordingly, no matter what strategy A selects, it is best for B to select Low 
rather than High. Therefore Low is B’s strictly dominant strategy. Strict domi-
nance refers to the case where a player can identify a strategy that is the best 
response for all strategies the other player may choose. Following this approach, 
it appears A should select Low and B should select Low, so that both firms earn a 
payoff of 4. This outcome, denoted (Low, Low), is known as a Dominant Strategy 
Equilibrium. In fact, the game shown in Figure 9.1 is rather trivial, in the sense 
that 4 is the best payoff achievable by either player under any circumstances. It 
seems natural that the players should choose the combination of strategies that 
produces this payoff for both of them. Below, it is shown that not all games are 
structured in a way that always produces such a pleasing outcome for the players!
Figure 9.1  Production game with strictly dominant strategies

Entry game with a weakly dominant strategy
Another dominance concept is weak dominance, which refers to the case where a 
player can identify a strategy that is at least as good as any other strategy, for all 
strategies the other player may choose, and better than any other strategy for at 
least one strategy the other player may choose. Figure 9.2 illustrates a game in 
which firm A has a weakly dominant strategy, while firm B has neither a strictly 
dominant strategy nor a weakly dominant strategy. Firm A is an incumbent and 
firm B is a potential entrant. In the simultaneous version of the entry game, Firm 
B chooses whether or not to enter, and Firm A plans whether to accommodate 
B’s arrival in the event that B does enter, or initiate a price war. To create the 
capability to fight a price war, A will have to take certain steps that will be irre-
versible, before A knows B’s decision. However, these steps will not impose any 
additional costs upon A in the event that B decides not to enter and A keeps the 
entire market to itself.
Consider A’s choice between the strategies Accommodate and Fight:
■ If B selects No entry, A does not need to execute the threatened price war. A’s 
payoff of 3 is the same, regardless whether A had decided to Accommodate or 
Fight.
■ If B selects Entry, Accommodate yields a payoff of 2 for A, while Fight yields 
a payoff of 1. If B selects Entry, A’s best response is Accommodate.
Firm A has no strictly dominant strategy, but Accommodate is weakly dominant: 
A prefers Accommodate if B selects Entry, but if B selects No entry A is indifferent 
between Accommodate and Fight.
Then, from B’s perspective:
■ If A selects Accommodate, Entry yields a payoff of 4 for B, while No entry yields 
a payoff of 3. If A selects Accommodate, B’s best response is Entry.
■ If A decides to Fight, Entry yields a payoff of 1 for B, while No entry yields a 
payoff of 3. If A selects Fight, B’s best response is No entry.
Firm B therefore has neither any strictly dominant strategy, nor any weakly 
dominant strategy. In comparison to the game with strictly dominant strate-
gies shown in Figure 9.1, the outcome of the game shown in Figure 9.2 is more 
difficult to predict. Firm A might opt for the weakly dominant strategy of 
Accommodate, in which case B prefers Entry. Alternatively, A might decide 
to Fight, in which case B prefers No entry. It is hard to be certain which way 
this game will turn out. We will return to this example several times during 
this chapter.

233
Nash Equilibrium
There is one further desirable and key property of the game shown in Figure 9.1. 
At the dominant strategy equilibrium (Low, Low), neither firm can improve its 
payoff given the current strategy of the other firm. Given that B selects Low, if A 
switches from Low to High, A’s payoff falls from 4 to 3. And given that A selects 
Low, if B switches from Low to High, B’s payoff also falls from 4 to 3. Therefore, 
if A selects Low and B selects Low, both firms perceive that they are maximizing 
their own profit, based on the assumption that the other firm’s output is fixed at 
its current level. Both firms maximise profit subject to a zero conjectural varia-
tion assumption.
An equilibrium of this kind has been identified previously, in the discussion 
of the Cournot duopoly model. In Section 7.3, it is known as a Cournot–Nash 
equilibrium. In game theory, it is known as a Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium 
(sometimes known simply as a Nash Equilibrium). In a Nash Equilibrium, nei-
ther firm can improve its payoff by switching to a different strategy, assuming 
the strategy chosen by the other firm does not change.
While there is no Dominant Strategy Equilibrium for the game shown in 
­Figure 9.2, this game has two Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria. First (Accommo-
date, Entry) is a Nash Equilibrium:
■ If B selects Entry, A’s payoff would drop from 2 to 1 if A switches to Fight;
■ If A selects Accommodate, B’s payoff would drop from 4 to 3 if B switches to 
No entry.
Likewise (Fight, No entry) is a Nash Equilibrium:
■ If B selects No entry, A’s payoff would remain at 3 if A switches to Accommodate;
■ If A selects Fight, B’s payoff would drop from 3 to 1 if B switches to Entry.
Both of the solutions (Accommodate, Entry) and (Fight, No entry) satisfy the 
requirement for a Nash Equilbrium; that is, neither firm can improve its payoff, 
assuming the current strategy of the other firm is fixed.
Relationship between Dominant Strategy Equilibrium and 
Nash Equilibrium
In the game shown in Figure 9.1, there is an exact correspondence between the 
Dominant Strategy Equilibrium and the (Pure Strategy) Nash Equilibrium. 
It can be shown that a Dominant Strategy Equilibrium in any game is always 
a Nash Equilibrium. If both players select their strictly dominant strategies, 
it is impossible for either to improve its own payoff by changing its strat-
egy, given the current strategy of the other player. In games such as the one 
shown in ­Figure 9.2, however, there may exist one or more Nash Equilibria, 
although there are no strictly dominant strategies and no Dominant Strategy 
Equilibrium.
In the game shown in Figure 9.3, firms A and B must decide simultane-
ously their advertising expenditures. They have a choice between three levels 

234	
|	 9    ■    Game theory
of expenditure: low, medium or high. Both firms’ payoffs from the advertis-
ing campaign depend on their own expenditure and on the expenditure of the 
other firm.
As before, consider firm A’s choices:
■ If B chooses Low, A’s best response is Low.
■ If B chooses Medium, A’s best response is Medium.
■ If B chooses High, A’s best response is High.
Similarly, consider firm B’s choices:
■ If A chooses Low, B’s best response is Medium.
■ If A chooses Medium, B’s best response is Low.
■ If A chooses High, B’s best response is High.
There are no strictly dominant strategies, and no weakly dominant strategies, 
for either firm A or firm B. By inspection, however, it can be confirmed that 
(High, High) is a Nash Equilibrium. If B chooses High, then High is also A’s best 
response; and if A chooses High, then High is also B’s best response. Unfortu-
nately, in the absence of strictly dominant strategies, there is no simple decision-
making procedure that will enable the two firms to reach the Nash Equilibrium 
easily. If this solution is achieved by some means, however, it is stable in the 
sense that there is no incentive for either firm to depart from it, given the zero 
conjectural variation assumption.
It is important to notice that firms A and B could both be better off by coop-
erating or agreeing to choose (Low, Low) in Figure 9.3, rather than remaining 
at the Nash Equilibrium of (High, High). In contrast to the Nash Equilibrium, 
however, this cooperative solution is unstable. If A chooses Low, B has an incen-
tive to ‘cheat’ and choose Medium instead of Low. But if B chooses Medium, A 
would also prefer Medium; and then if A chooses Medium, B would prefer Low; 
and so on. The cooperative solution is vulnerable to defection by one or both of 
the firms, and is likely to break down.

The prisoner’s dilemma game
Production game with prisoner’s dilemma structure
Figure 9.4 presents another simultaneous game, with a structure similar to 
­Figure 9.1, but a different set of payoffs. Applying the same reasoning as before, 
from A’s perspective:
■ If B selects Low, Low yields a payoff of 3 for A, while High yields a payoff of 
4. If B selects Low, A’s best response is High.
■ If B selects High, Low yields a payoff of 1 for A, while High yields a payoff of 
2. If B selects High, A’s best response is High.
And from B’s perspective:
■ If A selects Low, Low yields a payoff of 3 for B, while High yields a payoff of 
4. If A selects Low, B’s best response is High.
■ If A selects High, Low yields a payoff of 1 for B, while High yields a payoff of 
2. If A selects High, B’s best response is High.
High is a strictly dominant strategy for A and High is a strictly dominant 
strategy for B. Accordingly, it seems that A should select High and B should 
select High, in which case both firms earn a payoff of 2. As before, the Domi-
nant Strategy Equilibrium (High, High) is also a Nash Equilibrium. Given that 
B selects High, if A switches from High to Low, A’s payoff falls from 2 to 1; and 
given that A selects High, if B switches from High to Low, B’s payoff also falls 
from 2 to 1. However, this time something appears to be wrong. If both firms 
had selected the other strategy (Low, Low), either by cooperating or perhaps by 
acting independently, both firms would have earned a superior payoff of 3 each, 
rather than their actual payoff of 2 each.
Figure 9.5 is an example of a special class of single period non-constant-sum 
game, known as the prisoner’s dilemma. In a prisoner’s dilemma game, there are 
strictly dominant strategies for both players that produce a combined payoff that 
is worse than the combined payoff the players could achieve if they cooperate, 
with each player agreeing to choose a strategy other than his strictly dominant

strategy. In other words, in a prisoner’s dilemma, gains can be made by both 
players if they cooperate or collude.
The original prisoner’s dilemma
To see why this type of game is called prisoner’s dilemma, consider a situation 
where the police hold two prisoners, Alan and Brian, who are suspected of hav-
ing committed a serious crime together. The police have insufficient evidence 
to secure a conviction unless one or both prisoners confesses. The prisoners are 
separated physically and there is no communication between them. Each is told 
the following:
■ If you both confess to the serious crime, you both receive a reduced punishment 
of five years in prison.
■ If neither of you confesses to the serious crime, you are both convicted of a 
minor crime and you both receive the full sentence for the minor crime of two 
years in prison.
■ If you confess to the serious crime and your fellow prisoner does not confess, 
you receive a reduced sentence of one year in prison for the minor crime (and 
your punishment for the serious crime is cancelled).
■ If you do not confess to the serious crime and your fellow prisoner confesses, 
you receive the full sentence for the serious crime of ten years in prison.
The payoff matrix is shown in Figure 9.5, with all payoffs shown as negative 
numbers, because in this case a large payoff (prison sentence) is bad, not good. 
Alan’s reasoning might be as follows: if Brian confesses, I should confess because 
five years is better than ten years; and if Brian does not confess, I should confess 
because one year is better than two years. Therefore I will confess. Brian’s rea-
soning is the same, because the payoffs are symmetric between the two prisoners. 
Therefore both confess, and both receive sentences of five years. But if they had 
been able to cooperate, they could have agreed not to confess and both would 
have received sentences of two years. Even acting independently, they might be 
able to reach the cooperative solution. Alan knows that if he does not confess, 
he receives a two-year sentence as long as Brian does the same. However, Alan 
is worried because he knows there is a big incentive for Brian to ‘cheat’ on Alan

237
by confessing. By doing so, Brian can earn the one-year sentence and leave Alan 
with a ten-year sentence!
Brian is in a similar position: if he does not confess, he receives the two-year 
sentence as long as Alan also does not confess. However, Brian also knows there 
is a big incentive for Alan to cheat. The cooperative solution might be achiev-
able, especially if Alan and Brian can trust one another not to cheat, but it is also 
unstable and liable to break down.
The prisoner’s dilemma and the Cournot duopoly model
Section 7.3 analysed the choices of output levels by two duopolists. Comparing 
the Cournot–Nash and the Chamberlin solutions to the duopoly model shown 
in Figure 7.9, it is apparent that if the two firms operate independently according 
to the zero conjectural variation assumption, and each firm produces a relatively 
high output level of 1/3, the Cournot–Nash equilibrium is attained. In the termi-
nology of the present section, this is a non-cooperative outcome. If, on the other 
hand, the two firms recognise their interdependence and aim for joint profit max-
imization, and each firm produces the lower output level of 1/4, the Chamberlin 
equilibrium is attained. In present terminology, this is the cooperative outcome.
Figures 9.6 and 9.7 show that if the two duopolists have to make their output 
decisions simultaneously, without knowing the other firm’s decision, effectively 
Figure 9.6  Isoprofit curves for firms A and B: Cournot–Nash versus Chamberlin’s prisoner’s dilemma

238	
|	 9    ■    Game theory
they play a prisoner’s dilemma game. The assumptions underlying Figures 9.6 
and 9.7 are the same as in the original Cournot model developed in Section 7.3, 
with one exception. The two duopolists are assumed to produce an identical 
product and incur zero marginal costs. The one change involves a rescaling 
of the quantity axis for the market demand function, so that the maximum 
quantity that could be sold if the price falls to zero is 144 units (rather than 
one unit). As before, the price axis for market demand function is on a scale of 
P = 0 to P = 1, so when P = 0, Q = 144 and when P = 1, Q = 0. (Rescal-
ing the quantity axis avoids the occurrence of fractional prices, quantities and 
profits.) You can verify that the prices, quantities and profits or payoffs shown 
in Figures 9.6 and 9.7 are equivalent to their counterparts in Figure 7.9 multi-
plied by a factor of 144.
In Figure 9.6, it is assumed that each firm has to choose between producing 
a high output of 48 units, or a low output of 36 units. If both firms select high, 
the Cournot–Nash equilibrium is attained, and both firms’ profits are 16. If both 
firms select low, the Chamberlin joint profit-maximization equilibrium is attained, 
and both firms’ profits are 18. If one firm selects low while the other selects high, 
the low-producing firm suffers and earns 15, while the high-­producing firm pros-
pers and earns 20. Figure 9.7 represents these outcomes in the form of a payoff 
matrix. Applying the same reasoning as before, from A’s perspective:
■ If B selects Low, Low yields a payoff of 18 for A, while High yields a payoff of 
20. If B selects Low, A’s best response is High.
■ If B selects High, Low yields a payoff of 15 for A, while High yields a payoff 
of 16. If B selects High, A’s best response is High.
Accordingly, it is best for A to select High, no matter what strategy B selects. 
The same is also true for B, because the two firms are identical. (High, High) is 
the Dominant Strategy Equilibrium, and is also a suboptimal non-cooperative 
Cournot–Nash outcome. As before, the cooperative or collusive outcome (Low, 
Low) might be achievable if the firms can trust each other to stick to the low out-
put strategy and not defect and produce high output. This outcome is unstable, 
however, and is liable to break down. For the cooperative solution to hold in an 
oligopoly, any agreement between the firms might have to be accompanied by 
an enforceable contract (legal or otherwise).

dilemma

239
Conflict versus cooperation
Not all prisoner’s dilemma games generate suboptimal outcomes, especially when 
the assumptions are relaxed. First, the optimal (cooperative) outcome might be 
achieved if there is good communication between the players. If firms meet fre-
quently, they can exchange information and monitor each other’s actions. If the 
two prisoners, Alan and Brian, were not segregated, they could determine their 
best strategies by a continual examination of their options. The nuclear deter-
rence ‘game’ played by the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 
1970s was likened to a prisoner’s dilemma game. The choices were whether to 
attack the rival with a pre-emptive strike, or abide by the ‘non-first use’ agree-
ment. Perhaps one reason why the optimal outcome (sticking to the agreement) 
was achieved was that the installation of a telephone hotline between Washington 
and Moscow permitted rapid communication and exchange of information at 
the highest levels of government. Alternatively, it might be possible to achieve a 
cooperative outcome if the players are able to recognise trustworthiness in other 
players through visual signals (Janssen, 2008).
Second, in practice an important characteristic of any game is the length of 
the reaction lag: the time it takes for a player who has been deceived to retali-
ate. The longer the reaction lags, the greater the temptation for either player to 
act as an aggressor. If Brian cheats on Alan, Alan may have to wait ten years 
to take revenge, unless he has friends outside the prison who are prepared to 
act more quickly. In cartels, the main deterrent to cheating is immediate dis-
covery and punishment. In the nuclear deterrence game, short reaction lags 
were crucial to ensuring both sides kept to the agreement. Each side boasted 
that it could retaliate within minutes if attacked by the other, ensuring there 
was no first-mover advantage. This policy became known as mutually assured 
destruction (MAD).
Third, the dynamics of rivalry may also be relevant. Is the rivalry continuous, 
or ‘one-off’? If rivalry is continuous in a repeated game, players learn over time 
that cooperation is preferable to aggression. Professional criminals have no prob-
lem with the prisoner’s dilemma: experience has taught them that silence is the 
best option. In an oligopoly, firms change prices, alter product lines and deter-
mine advertising strategies, continuously. The firms may learn over time that 
aggressive behaviour leads to hostile (tit-for-tat) reactions from rivals, which tend 
to cancel out any short-term gains (see Case Study 9.1). Repeated or multiple-
period games are examined in more detail below.
	
9.4	
Mixed strategies
In some games, there is neither any Dominant Strategy Equilibrium nor any 
Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium. In others there may be no Dominant Strategy 
Equilibrium, but more than one Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium. In such cases, 
it may be beneficial for the firms (or other players) to adopt what are known as 
mixed strategies. A mixed strategy involves randomizing the choice between two 
or more options, with probabilities defined for each option.

Prison breakthrough
Economist, 20th August 2016
JOHN NASH arrived at Princeton University in 1948 to start his PhD with a one-sen-
tence recommendation: “He is a mathematical genius”. He did not disappoint. Aged 19 
and with just one undergraduate economics course to his name, in his first 14 months as 
a graduate he produced the work that would end up, in 1994, winning him a Nobel prize 
in economics for his contribution to game theory.
On November 16th 1949, Nash sent a note barely longer than a page to the Proceed-
ings of the National Academy of Sciences, in which he laid out the concept that has since 
become known as the “Nash equilibrium”. This concept describes a stable outcome that 
results from people or institutions making rational choices based on what they think 
others will do. In a Nash equilibrium, no one is able to improve their own situation by 
changing strategy: each person is doing as well as they possibly can, even if that does not 
mean the optimal outcome for society. With a flourish of elegant mathematics, Nash 
showed that every “game” with a finite number of players, each with a finite number of 
options to choose from, would have at least one such equilibrium.
His insights expanded the scope of economics. In perfectly competitive markets, where 
there are no barriers to entry and everyone’s products are identical, no individual buyer 
or seller can influence the market: none need pay close attention to what the others are up 
to. But most markets are not like this: the decisions of rivals and customers matter. From 
auctions to labour markets, the Nash equilibrium gave the dismal science a way to make 
real-world predictions based on information about each person’s incentives.
One example in particular has come to symbolise the equilibrium: the prisoner’s dilemma. 
Nash used algebra and numbers to set out this situation in an expanded paper published in 
1951, but the version familiar to economics students is altogether more gripping. (Nash’s 
thesis adviser, Albert Tucker, came up with it for a talk he gave to a group of psychologists.)
It involves two mobsters sweating in separate prison cells, each contemplating the same 
deal offered by the district attorney. If they both confess to a bloody murder, they each face 
ten years in jail. If one stays quiet while the other snitches, then the snitch will get a reward, 
while the other will face a lifetime in jail. And if both hold their tongue, then they each face 
a minor charge, and only a year in the clink. There is only one Nash-equilibrium solution to 
the prisoner’s dilemma: both confess. Each is a best response to the other’s strategy; since the 
other might have spilled the beans, snitching avoids a lifetime in jail. The tragedy is that if only 
they could work out some way of co-ordinating, they could both make themselves better off.
The example illustrates that crowds can be foolish as well as wise; what is best for the 
individual can be disastrous for the group. This tragic outcome is all too common in the 
real world. Left freely to plunder the sea, individuals will fish more than is best for the 
group, depleting fish stocks. Employees competing to impress their boss by staying lon-
gest in the office will encourage workforce exhaustion. Banks have an incentive to lend 
more rather than sit things out when house prices shoot up.
The Nash equilibrium would not have attained its current status without some refine-
ments on the original idea. First, in plenty of situations, there is more than one possible 
Nash equilibrium. Drivers choose which side of the road to drive on as a best response 

	
	
	
9.4  Mixed strategies	 |	
241
to the behaviour of other drivers—with very different outcomes, depending on where 
they live; they stick to the left-hand side of the road in Britain, but to the right in Amer-
ica. Much to the disappointment of algebra-toting economists, understanding strategy 
requires knowledge of social norms and habits. Nash’s theorem alone was not enough.
A second refinement involved accounting properly for non-credible threats. If a teenager 
threatens to run away from home if his mother separates him from his mobile phone, then there 
is a Nash equilibrium where she gives him the phone to retain peace of mind. But Reinhard 
Selten, a German economist who shared the 1994 Nobel prize with Nash and John Harsanyi, 
argued that this is not a plausible outcome. The mother should know that her child’s threat is 
empty—no matter how tragic the loss of a phone would be, a night out on the streets would 
be worse. She should just confiscate the phone, forcing her son to focus on his homework.
Mr Selten’s work let economists whittle down the number of possible Nash equilibria. 
Harsanyi addressed the fact that in many real-life games, people are unsure of what their 
opponent wants. Economists would struggle to analyse the best strategies for two lovebirds 
trying to pick a mutually acceptable location for a date with no idea of what the other prefers. 
By embedding each person’s beliefs into the game (for example that they correctly think the 
other likes pizza just as much as sushi), Harsanyi made the problem solvable. A different 
problem continued to lurk. The predictive power of the Nash equilibrium relies on rational 
behaviour. Yet humans often fall short of this ideal. In experiments replicating the set-up of 
the prisoner’s dilemma, only around half of people chose to confess. For the economists who 
had been busy embedding rationality (and Nash) into their models, this was problematic. 
What is the use of setting up good incentives, if people do not follow their own best interests?
All was not lost. The experiments also showed that experience made players wiser; by the 
tenth round only around 10% of players were refusing to confess. That taught economists 
to be more cautious about applying Nash’s equilibrium. With complicated games, or ones 
where they do not have a chance to learn from mistakes, his insights may not work as well.
The Nash equilibrium nonetheless boasts a central role in modern microeconomics. 
Nash died in a car crash in 2015; by then his mental health had recovered, he had resumed 
teaching at Princeton and he had received that joint Nobel—in recognition that the inter-
actions of the group contributed more than any individual.

Advertising game with no Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium
Consider first the case of two firms that need to decide simultaneously their adver-
tising budgets (low or high). As before, both firms’ payoffs from the advertising 
campaign depend both on their own expenditure and on the other firm’s expendi-
ture. The payoff matrix is shown in Figure 9.8. This is a constant-sum game. What-
ever combination of strategies is chosen, the sum of the payoffs to both firms is 5. 
There is no strictly dominant strategy for either firm. From firm A’s perspective:
■ If B chooses Low, A’s best response is High.
■ If B chooses High, A’s best response is Low.

|	 9    ■    Game theory
And from B’s perspective:
■ If A chooses Low, B’s best response is Low.
■ If A chooses High, B’s best response is High.
There is also no Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium, because there is no pair of 
strategies from which neither firm would wish to defect if the other firm continues 
to follow the same strategy. A is in a difficult position. If A selects Low, B might 
select Low and A only earns a profit of 1. But, on the other hand, if A selects High 
and B selects High, A earns a profit of 0. Of course, B also faces a similar dilemma.
A possible solution lies in the concept of a mixed strategy, developed by von 
Neumann and Morgenstern (1944). A player follows a mixed strategy by choosing 
his action randomly, assigning fixed probabilities to the selection of each action. In 
contrast, previous examples have resulted in the choice of a pure strategy by both 
players. According to the non-cooperative solution to the prisoner’s dilemma game 
shown in Figure 9.4, for example, A should only ever select High and B should only 
ever select High, because High and High are strictly dominant strategies.
At the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, each player has the same expected 
payoff from either action and from a mixed strategy that assigns specific prob-
abilities to both actions; and this expected payoff is unaffected by the mixed 
strategy selected by the other player. Therefore neither player has any incentive 
to depart from his current mixed strategy, assuming the other player continues 
with his current mixed strategy.
Returning to Figure 9.8, suppose firm A assigns a probability of x to the 
choice of Low, and a probability of (1 - x) to the choice of High. B’s expected 
payoffs (in terms of x) are as follows:
■ If B chooses Low, B’s possible payoffs are 4 (if A chooses Low, with a prob-
ability of x) and 1 (if A chooses High, with a probability of 1 - x). B’s expected 
payoff is 4x + 1(1 - x) = 1 + 3x.
■ If B chooses High, B’s possible payoffs are 2 (if A chooses Low, with a proba-
bility of x) and 5 (if A chooses High, with a probability of 1 - x). B’s expected 
payoff is 2x + 5(1 - x) = 5 - 3x.
The right-hand diagram in Figure 9.9 plots firm B’s expected payoffs against all 
possible values of x, for each of the two possible choices open to B. Setting x = 0 
is equivalent to ‘A always chooses High’. In this case, the best B can achieve is a 
payoff of 5 (if B chooses High). Similarly, setting x = 1 is equivalent to ‘A always

chooses Low’. In this case, the best B can achieve is a payoff of 4 (if B chooses 
Low). A should choose x to ensure B is indifferent between choosing Low or 
High. A does so by selecting a mixed strategy of x = 2/3, with the consequence 
that B’s expected payoff of 3 is the same, regardless whether B selects Low or 
High, or any mixed strategy that combines Low and High.
In this case, A earns an expected profit of 2, whichever of Low and High is 
chosen by B. In fact, it can be shown that A still earns an expected profit of 2 if 
B selects any mixed strategy which involves choosing randomly between Low and 
High, no matter what probabilities B assigns to these two choices.
B’s optimal mixed strategy can also be evaluated with reference to ­Figure 9.9. 
Let B assign a probability of y to the choice of Low, and a probability of (1 - y) 
to the choice of High. A’s expected payoffs (in terms of y) are as follows:
■ If A chooses Low, A’s possible payoffs are 1 (if B chooses Low, with a prob-
ability of y) and 3 (if B chooses High, with a probability of 1 - y). A’s expected 
payoff is 1y + 3(1 - y) = 3 - 2y.
■ If A chooses High, A’s possible payoffs are 4 (if B chooses Low, with a proba-
bility of y) and 0 (if B chooses High, with a probability of 1 - y). A’s expected 
payoff is 4y.
The left-hand diagram in Figure 9.9 plots A’s expected payoffs against all pos-
sible values of y, for each of the two possible choices available to A. Setting 
y = 1 is equivalent to ‘B always chooses Low’. In this case, the best A can achieve 
is a payoff of 4 (if A chooses High). Similarly, setting y = 0 is equivalent to ‘B 
always chooses High’. In this case, the best A can achieve is a payoff of 3 (if A 
chooses Low). B should choose y to ensure A is indifferent between choosing Low 
or High. B does so by selecting a mixed strategy of y = 1/2, with the consequence

that A’s expected payoff of 2 is the same, regardless whether A selects Low or 
High, or any mixed strategy that combines Low and High.
If A sets x = 2/3 and B sets y = 1/2, the game shown in Figure 9.8 achieves a 
Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium. Each firm selects the probabilities that maxi-
mise its own expected payoff, given the mixed strategy that is being employed 
by the other firm. In fact, by selecting the probabilities in this way, each firm 
guarantees its own expected payoff, whatever the probabilities selected by the 
other firm. Selecting x = 2/3 guarantees A an expected payoff of 2 for any value 
of y selected by B; selecting x = 2/3 makes A indifferent to B’s selection of prob-
abilities. Likewise, selecting y = 1/2 guarantees B an expected payoff of 3 for any 
value of x selected by A; selecting y = 1/2 makes B indifferent to A’s selection 
of probabilities. Although the mathematics is beyond the scope of this text, it 
has been shown that for any game with a fixed number of players, each of whom 
chooses between a fixed number of possible actions, a Nash equilibrium involv-
ing either pure strategies or mixed strategies always exists.
Entry game with a weakly dominant strategy
The concept of Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium is also relevant to the entry 
game with a weakly dominant strategy for firm A, discussed in Section 9.2 and 
summarised in Figure 9.2. We can search for a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium 
using the same reasoning as above. Suppose firm A assigns a probability of x to 
the choice of Accommodate, and a probability of (1 - x) to the choice of Fight. 
B’s expected payoffs (in terms of x) are as follows:
■ If B selects Entry, B’s possible payoffs are 4 (if A chooses Accommodate, with 
a probability of x) and 1 (if A chooses Fight, with a probability of 1 - x). B’s 
expected payoff is 4x + 1(1 - x) = 1 + 3x.
■ If B chooses No entry, B’s possible payoffs are 3 (if A chooses Accommodate) 
and 3 (if A chooses Fight). B’s expected payoff is 3x + 3(1 - x) = 3.
Since Accommodate and Fight are both best responses for A if B selects No entry, A 
is indifferent between any mixed strategy for any (feasible) value of x between 0 and 
1 in the event that B selects No entry. To identify the Mixed Strategy Nash Equi-
librium, we need to find the range of mixed strategies for A, or the range of values 
for x, that make No entry the best response for B. In other words, we need to find 
x such that 3 Ú 1 + 3x. Accordingly, No entry is the best response for B for any 
x … 2/3. Any outcome in which A follows a mixed strategy with x … 2/3 and B fol-
lows a pure strategy of No entry is a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium. The require-
ment x … 2/3 incorporates the Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium (Fight, No entry), 
at which x = 0. The entry game with a weakly dominant strategy for firm A turns 
out to have not only two Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria, (Accommodate, Entry) and 
(Fight, No entry), but also an infinite number of Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibria.
Battle of the sexes game
Consider next the game represented by the payoff matrix shown in Figure 9.10, 
known as the battle of the sexes game. Arthur and Barbara are a couple with widely 
divergent preferences for an evening’s live entertainment: Arthur prefers to watch

football, and Barbara prefers ballet. However, despite their differences in taste they 
both prefer each other’s company to attending either event alone, and both will go 
straight home if the other does not show up. Owing to a temporary mobile phone 
outage, they are unable to communicate with each other prior to the start of either 
event. Both must decide which event to attend, without knowing the other’s decision.
By inspection of Figure 9.10, it is clear that there are no strictly dominant 
strategies, but both (Football, Football) and (Ballet, Ballet) are Pure Strategy 
Nash Equilibria. In respect of (Football, Football), if Barbara selects Football, 
Arthur would not wish to switch from Football (because his payoff would drop 
from 4 to 1); and if Arthur selects Football, Barbara would not wish to switch 
from Football (because her payoff would drop from 2 to 1). The same reasoning 
applies to (Ballet, Ballet). But without communication, how can the couple be 
sure of achieving either of these two solutions?
The selection of mixed strategies by both partners might resolve the dilemma, 
but as we shall see, the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium in this game is some-
what flawed. Let Arthur assign a probability of x to the choice of Football, and 
a probability of (1 - x) to the choice of Ballet. Barbara’s expected payoffs (in 
terms of x) are as follows:
■ If Barbara chooses Football, Barbara’s possible payoffs are 2 (with a prob-
ability of x) and 1 (with a probability of 1 - x). Barbara’s expected payoff is 
2x + 1(1 - x) = 1 + x.
■ If Barbara chooses Ballet, Barbara’s possible payoffs are 1 (with a probabil-
ity of x) and 4 (if with a probability of 1 - x). Barbara’s expected payoff is 
1x + 4(1 - x) = 4 - 3x.
Let Barbara assign a probability of y to the choice of Football, and a probability of 
(1 - y) to the choice of Ballet. Arthur’s expected payoffs (in terms of y) are as follows:
■ If Arthur chooses Football, Arthur’s possible payoffs are 4 (with a prob-
ability of y) and 1 (with a probability of 1 - y). Arthur’s expected payoff is 
4y + 1(1 - y) = 1 + 3y.
■ If Arthur chooses Ballet, Arthur’s possible payoffs are 1 (with a probabil-
ity of y) and 2 (with a probability of 1 - y). Arthur’s expected payoff is 
1y + 2(1 - y) = 2 - y.
Proceeding in the same way as before, Arthur should choose x so as to 
minimise Barbara’s expected payoff. Arthur does so by selecting x such that 
Barbara’s expected payoff is the same regardless whether Barbara selects Foot-
ball or Ballet, or any mixed strategy that combines Football and Ballet. Solving 
1 + x = 4 - 3x yields x = 3>4: Arthur should select Football with a prob-
ability of x = 3>4, and Ballet with a probability of (1 - x) = 1>4. Since the 
payoff matrix is symmetric, it is straightforward to verify that Barbara should

246	
|	 9    ■    Game theory
select Football with a probability of y = 1>4 and Ballet with a probability of 
(1 - y) = 3>4.
A troublesome feature of the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium in the Battle 
of the sexes game is that the expected payoffs to both players are lower than the 
payoffs at either of the two Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria. Arthur’s expected 
payoff is calculated as follows:
   P(Arthur chooses Football) * P(Barbara chooses Football) * 4
+  P(Arthur chooses Football) * P(Barbara chooses Ballet) * 1
+  P(Arthur chooses Ballet) * P(Barbara chooses Football) * 1
+  P(Arthur chooses Ballet) * P(Barbara chooses Ballet) * 2
= 4xy + x(1 - y) + (1 - x)y + 2(1 - x)(1 - y)
= 1.75 when x = 34 and y = 14.
Likewise Barbara’s expected payoff is 1.75; so the expected payoffs at the Mixed 
Strategy Nash Equilibrium are (1.75, 1.75). Both players would be better off at 
either of the two Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria, with payoffs of (4, 2) at (­Football, 
Football) or (2, 4) at (Ballet, Ballet). As we have seen, however, the players encoun-
ter what is known as a coordination problem in reaching either of these solutions.
It has been suggested that the battle of the sexes game is relevant in describing the 
situation faced by two firms in deciding which of two alternative technological stan-
dards to adopt. Each firm has a competitive advantage with a different standard; 
but if the two firms fail to adopt the same standard, customers refuse to buy from 
either firm, and both firms are worse off than they would be if they made either stan-
dard the common standard. Substituting firms A and B for Arthur and Barbara, 
and standards 1 and 2 for Football and Ballet, the two firms face payoffs with the 
same relative magnitudes as those shown in Figure 9.9. The firms also face the same 
coordination problem: how do they achieve a consensus as to which standard to 
adopt? Some form of regulatory intervention, to enforce a common standard, might 
be justified, and even welcomed by the firms affected, under these circumstances.

Sequential games
In the games examined so far in Sections 9.2 to 9.4, the players act simultaneously 
and decide their strategies and actions before they know which strategies and 
actions have been chosen by their rivals. However, there are other games in which 
the players’ decisions follow a sequence. One player makes a decision, and the 
other player observes this decision before making a response. For example, firm 
A decides to launch a new brand and firm B then decides how best to respond. 
Should B imitate A and launch a brand with identical characteristics, or should 
B aim for a segment in the market that is not serviced by A and launch a brand 
with different characteristics? For a sequential game, it is convenient to map the 
choices facing the players in the form of a game tree.

Breakfast cereals game with first-mover advantage
Suppose two breakfast cereal producers are both considering a new product 
launch. They each have a choice of launching one of two products: one product’s 
appeal is ‘crunchiness’ and the other’s appeal is ‘fruitiness’. Assume the crunchy 
cereal is more popular with consumers than the fruity cereal. Figure 9.11 shows 
the payoff matrix in the same form as before, assuming both firms move simul-
taneously, ignorant of what their rival is planning. The payoff structure is similar 
to the battle of the sexes game, with the exception that making different choices, 
rather than the same choices, is preferred by both firms. There are no strictly 
dominant strategies: if B produces Crunchy it is better for A to produce Fruity, 
but if B produces Fruity it is better for A to produce Crunchy. However, (Fruity, 
Crunchy) and (Crunchy, Fruity) are both Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria. Using 
the methods discussed in Section 9.4, you can verify that the Mixed Strategy 
Nash Equilibrium requires both firms to choose their actions randomly, with 
probabilities of 3/4 assigned to crunchy and 1/4 assigned to fruity.
In a sequential game, however, if A is the first to launch its new product 
and B then responds after having observed A’s action, the outcome is different. 
­Figure 9.12 shows the game tree representation of the payoffs of the breakfast 
cereal game, also known as the extensive form representation. (The equivalent

terminology for the payoff matrix used previously is the strategic form represen-
tation.) Consider A’s decision:
■ If A produces Crunchy, B’s Fruity payoff of 4 exceeds B’s Crunchy payoff of 3, 
so B will produce Fruity and A earns a payoff of 5.
■ If A produces Fruity, B’s Crunchy payoff of 5 exceeds B’s Fruity payoff of 2, 
so B will produce Crunchy and A earns a payoff of 4.
A realises that whatever product A launches, the rational response of B is to 
launch the alternative product. A’s best action is to produce Crunchy, and A 
earns the higher payoff of 5. B produces Fruity and earns the lower payoff of 
4. At (Crunchy, Fruity), A ends up with the higher payoff, because A benefits 
from a first-mover advantage. In many sequential games, the player who moves 
first gains an advantage, by influencing the shape of the game and forcing the 
other player to react to the first-mover’s decision, rather than act in a way that 
is independent of the first-mover’s presence. In the breakfast cereals game, from 
the symmetry of the payoff matrix it is obvious that if B were the first mover, the 
solution would be (Fruity, Crunchy), A would end up with the lower payoff of 4, 
and B would end up with the higher payoff of 5.
Assuming the first mover is A, can B take any steps that might deliver the 
other outcome, in which the firms produce different products (Fruity, Crunchy) 
yielding payoffs of 4 to A and 5 to B? Perhaps, prior to A’s action, B could 
threaten to produce Crunchy regardless of A’s decision. If A views B’s threat 
as credible, A will calculate that by producing Crunchy, A will end up with a 
payoff of 3, but by producing Fruity A will achieve a payoff of 4. According to 
this calculation, B’s threat should steer A towards the (Fruity, Crunchy) out-
come that B prefers. However, is B’s threat to produce Crunchy truly credible? 
A might calculate that if A produces Crunchy regardless, then B has no incentive 
to execute the threat. Once A has taken the decision to produce Crunchy, the 
only payoffs relevant to B are those at the top of the game tree: 3 if B executes 
the threat and produces Crunchy, and 4 if B reneges on the threat and produces 
Fruity. Faced with these alternatives, B reneges on the threat, and A’s favoured 
outcome, (Crunchy, Fruity), is achieved.
In the breakfast cereals game with A as first mover, (Crunchy, Fruity) is a Sub-
game Perfect Equilibrium (SPE). Any SPE is a Nash Equilibrium in the strategic 
form representation, but not all Nash Equilibria are SPEs in the extensive form 
representation. SPEs exclude any Nash Equilibrium, such as (Fruity, Crunchy), 
whose attainment would require either player to make non-credible threats that 
they would not execute if/when the time comes to do so. In a sequential game the 
classification of an SPE depends upon the order of play: it is obvious that if B 
held the first-mover advantage and the payoffs were the same, (Fruity, Crunchy) 
would be an SPE, but (Crunchy, Fruity) would not be an SPE.
Technological standards game with second-mover advantage
Suppose two suppliers of consumer IT products are considering whether to stick 
with an old technological standard, or introduce a new standard, for a particular 
item of IT gadgetry. Firm A has produced using the old standard for a number

249
of years and has a reputation for reliability, while Firm B is a recent entrant 
with no established reputation. If both suppliers produce using the old standard, 
A’s existing customers, aware of A’s reputation, will see no reason to purchase 
from B rather than A. A earns a payoff of 5 and B earns 0. If A switches to the 
new standard while B remains with the old, a minority of A’s existing custom-
ers will, out of loyalty, switch as well, but a majority, content to remain with 
the old standard if they have the option of doing so, will purchase from B. A 
earns a payoff of 2, and B earns 3. If A produces using the old standard while 
B produces using the new, the majority of A’s existing customers will purchase 
from A, while a minority, willing to switch to the new standard out of curiosity, 
will purchase from B. Finally, if A and B both produce using the new standard, 
forcing all customers to switch, a large majority will purchase from A out of 
loyalty, but a small minority, viewing B as a more credible producer for the 
new standard, will purchase from B. Figure 9.13 shows the payoff matrix in the 
same format as before, assuming both firms move simultaneously. Figure 9.14 
shows the extensive form representation of the sequential game, drawn under 
alternative assumptions that A is first mover (left-hand panel) and B is first 
mover (right-hand panel).
Suppose first that A is first mover, and consider A’s decision:
■ If A selects the Old standard, B’s payoff of 2 for New exceeds B’s payoff of 0 
for Old, so B selects New and A earns a payoff of 3.
■ If A selects the New standard, B’s payoff of 3 for Old exceeds B’s payoff of 1 
for New, so B selects Old and A earns a payoff of 2.
Figure 9.13  Technological standards game: strategic form representation

|	 9    ■    Game theory
Therefore A selects Old, the outcome is (Old, New), and the payoffs are (3, 2).
Suppose instead that B is first mover, and consider B’s decision:
■ If B selects the Old standard, A’s payoff of 5 for Old exceeds A’s payoff of 2 
for New, so A selects Old and B earns a payoff of 0.
■ If B selects the New standard, A’s payoff of 4 for New exceeds A’s payoff of 3 
for Old, so A selects New and B earns a payoff of 1.
Therefore B selects New, the outcome is (New, New), and the payoffs are (4, 1).
Note that A does better when B is first mover; and B does better when A is 
first mover. In each case there is a second-mover advantage: the second mover 
gains from being able to observe the first mover’s decision before making his 
own decision.
Entry game with a weakly dominant strategy
Next we return to the entry game with a weakly dominant strategy for firm A, 
described in Sections 9.2 and 9.4, and presented in strategic form representation 
in Figure 9.2. On our previous encounter with this game, we established that 
there were multiple feasible outcomes, based on the criterion of Nash Equilib-
rium. Suppose, however, this game is played as a sequential game, in which either 
firm A or firm B moves first, and the other firm observes the first move before 
taking its decision. It turns out to be far easier to predict an outcome for the 
sequential game than for the equivalent simultaneous game.
Suppose firm A is the first mover: A must decide whether to prepare for a 
price war in the event that firm B enters, or accommodate by allowing B a share 
of the market. The left-hand panel of Figure 9.15 shows the extensive form 
representation.
■ If A selects Accommodate, B’s payoff of 4 for Entry exceeds B’s payoff of 3 for 
No entry, so B selects Entry and A earns a payoff of 2.
■ If A selects Fight, B’s payoff of 3 for No entry exceeds B’s payoff of 1 for Entry, 
so B selects No entry and A earns a payoff of 3.
Figure 9.15  Entry game: extensive form representation

	
	
	
9.5  Sequential games	 |	
251
Therefore A selects Fight, the outcome is (Fight, No entry), and the payoffs are 
(3, 3).
Suppose instead B is first mover: A can hold off from taking the decision as 
to whether to invest in new capacity until A has observed B’s decision whether 
to enter or not. The right-hand panel of Figure 9.15 shows the extensive form 
representation.
■ If B selects Entry, A’s payoff of 2 for Accommodate exceeds A’s payoff of 1 for 
Fight, so A selects Accommodate and B earns a payoff of 4.
■ If B selects No entry, A’s payoff of 3 is the same for Accommodate and Fight, 
and B earns a payoff of 3 regardless which strategy A selects.
Therefore B selects Entry, the outcome is (Accommodate, Entry), and the payoffs 
are (2, 4). This outcome is an SPE for the sequential game with B as first mover. 
By comparing the payoffs when either A or B is the first mover, it is clear that 
the entry game confers a first-mover advantage.
In the sequential game with B as first mover, could A have steered B towards 
a different outcome by threatening to fight, even in the event that B decides to 
enter? Clearly if B believes A will fight regardless of B’s decision, B will prefer not 
to enter, rather than enter and fight a price war. From A’s perspective, however, 
the problem with the threatened price war is that if B does choose to enter, A’s 
threat to fight is no longer credible. If A executes the threat after B has already 
entered, a price war breaks out and A’s payoff is 1; but if A does not execute the 
threat, A’s payoff is 2. Recognizing that A’s threat to fight is not credible once 
B has entered, B goes ahead and does so, and B’s preferred outcome of (Accom-
modate, Entry) is achieved. Since this outcome is a Nash Equilibrium reliant only 
on credible threats, (Accommodate, Entry) is an SPE. Using similar reasoning, 
you can easily verify that in the sequential game with A as first mover, (Fight, 
No entry) is an SPE.
The structure of the entry game shown in Figures 9.2 and 9.15 is equivalent to 
what has become known as Selten’s game, named after the Nobel Prize-winning 
game theorist Reinhard Selten (1975). Selten’s contribution to game theory was 
the development of the concept of Subgame Perfect Equilibrium, and its applica-
tion in demonstrating that some Nash Equilibria are more likely to occur than 
others, namely, those that are reinforced by credible retaliatory threats.
Burning bridges and building credibility
Thomas Schelling (1960), another Nobel Prize winner, focused on social inter-
actions that contained elements of both conflict and common interest. One of 
Schelling’s best known contributions is his description of the game known as 
burning bridges. Two warring countries are separated by a small island, and 
each country has one bridge providing the only means of access. The first coun-
try crosses its bridge and occupies the island, and must then decide whether to 
burn its bridge behind it. Subsequently the second country decides whether or 
not to invade. If the second country invades and the bridge has not been burnt, 
the first country must choose whether to fight or retreat. If the bridge has been 

252	
|	 9    ■    Game theory
Figure 9.16  Burning bridges
burnt, the first country has no choice other than to fight if the second country 
invades. Figure 9.16 shows the game tree.
Suppose the first country does not burn its bridge, and retains the option to 
retreat. If the second country does not invade, the first country keeps the island 
and the payoffs are (1, 0). If the second country invades, the first country has the 
option to either fight, which is damaging to both countries, reflected in payoffs of 
(−1, -1); or retreat and allow the second country to retain the island, with pay-
offs of (0, 1). Faced with this choice, the first country prefers to retreat. Aware 
that the first country’s threat to fight in the event of invasion is not credible, the 
second country invades and gains the island with payoffs of (0, 1).
It is interesting to discover that the first country achieves a better outcome by 
limiting its options in the event that the second country invades. This may seem 
counter-intuitive, or contrary to the received wisdom that ‘keeping your options 
open’ is better than limiting options. If the first country burns its bridge, how-
ever, forfeiting the option of retreat, the second country knows that if it invades 
the first country will fight, with payoffs of (−1, -1); In this case the second 
country decides not to invade, and the outcome is that the first country retains 
the island with payoffs of (1, 0). By burning its bridge, the first country demon-
strates its commitment to remaining on the island, and establishes the credibility 
of the retaliatory threat if the second country invades. The second country, rec-
ognizing that the retaliatory threat is credible, abstains from invasion.
A similar approach for building credibility may assist firm A in achieving 
a better outcome in the entry game described previously, in the case where 
firm B enjoys first-mover advantage. The top-right section of the game tree 
shown in Figure 9.17 replicates the right-hand panel of Figure 9.15, in which 
B chooses between Entry and No entry, and then A decides whether to Accom-
modate or Fight.
Now suppose A has the opportunity, before B takes any decision, to undertake 
an investment that will reduce A’s payoff in the event that B enters and A accom-
modates, but leave all other payoffs unchanged. The investment might entail 
switching to an alternative larger-scale technology, which is equally cost-effective

if A produces at high volume (if A has the market to itself, or if A engages in 
a price war), but more expensive if A produces at low volume (if A shares the 
market with B).
The availability of this investment opportunity extends the game tree, and 
changes the final outcome. If A does not invest, the rest of the game plays out 
in the same way as before, and the final outcome is (Accommodate, Entry) with 
payoffs of (2, 4). If A undertakes the investment, however, B recognises that if 
B enters, A’s preference will now be to Fight rather than Accommodate, leading 
to a price war and a payoff for B of 1. If B does not enter, B achieves a superior 
payoff of 3. B prefers to select No entry, and the final payoffs are (3, 3). As in the 
burning bridges game, by (effectively) eliminating the option of accommodating 
B in the event that B enters, A demonstrates commitment and establishes the 
credibility of the threat to fight, and deters B from entering. The final outcome 
leaves A with a superior payoff of 3 having undertaken the investment, by com-
parison with the original payoff of 2 if A does not invest. The notion that game 
theory players can themselves take steps to enhance the credibility of threatened 
retaliatory action was further developed by Spence (1977) and Dixit (1980).

Repeated games
In the previous discussion of single-period prisoner’s dilemma and other games, 
it is assumed that the game is played only once. However, some games may be 
played repeatedly by the same players. Suppose firms A and B are hotdog sellers 
located outside a sports stadium. If the occasion is a one-off event such as the 
Olympics, and the two hotdog sellers are unlikely to ever see each other again, the 
game between them is a single-period game. In this case, the two hotdog sellers 
are less likely to cooperate. Suppose, however, the event is one that is repeated 
at regular intervals. Suppose the stadium is Old Trafford, the event is Man-
chester United home matches and the hotdog sellers see one another at regular, 
fortnightly intervals. In this case, it is more likely that cooperative behaviour

|	 9    ■    Game theory
will evolve as the two sellers observe and learn from each other’s behaviour. In 
a repeated or multiple-period game, each firm may attempt to influence its rival’s 
behaviour by sending signals that promise to reward cooperative behaviour and 
threaten to punish non-cooperative behaviour.
With reference to the production game with prisoner’s dilemma structure 
shown in Figure 9.4, (High, High) is the (suboptimal) non-cooperative solution, 
which produces payoffs of 2 for firms A and B; and (Low, Low) is the (optimal) 
cooperative choice, which produces payoffs of 3 for both firms. In a single-period 
game, in which the firms act independently, High and High are the dominant 
strategies, and the non-cooperative outcome is likely to occur. However, suppose 
the game is to be repeated over an indefinite number of periods. Firm A could 
adopt the following strategy, known as tit-for-tat, in an attempt to encourage 
firm B to always select the cooperative choice:
■ In period 1 A chooses Low.
■ If B chose Low in period t - 1, in period t (for t 7 1) A chooses Low.
■ If B chose High in period t - 1, in period t (for t 7 1) A chooses High.
In each period after the first, provided B chose the cooperative strategy last 
time, A rewards B by choosing the cooperative strategy this time. But if B chose 
the non-cooperative strategy last time, A punishes B by choosing the non-­
cooperative strategy this time. For as long as B cooperates, A also cooperates 
and the (optimal) cooperative solution is achieved. But if B attempts to exploit 
A’s cooperation for short-term gain by defecting from Low to High, A punishes 
B in the following period by also switching from Low to High. However, B’s 
punishment does not necessarily have to be long-lasting. Provided B learns from 
his error and switches back from High to Low, A also switches back from High 
to Low and cooperation is restored.
Since it is difficult to observe situations which replicate the structure of many 
theoretical games in practice, a subfield of economics known as experimental 
economics has been developed to test the predictions of game theory. Labora-
tory experimentation allows economists to determine the structure of games and 
test relevant hypotheses. Some economists are particularly optimistic about the 
future of this development:
[A] hundred years from now, game theory will have become the 
backbone of a kind of microeconomics engineering that will 
have roughly the relation to the economic theory and laboratory 
experimentation of the time that chemical engineering has to chemical 
theory and bench chemistry.
(Roth, 1991, p. 107)
In the present context, experiments have shown the adoption of a tit-for-tat strat-
egy by one or both players is a highly effective method for ensuring adherence 
to cooperative behaviour in repeated games with a prisoner’s dilemma structure. 
Usually, both players rapidly learn it is best for them to adhere to the cooperative 
strategy on each occasion the game is repeated.

	
	
	
9.7  Summary	 |	
255
However, there is one important caveat. Tit-for-tat is effective in infinitely 
repeated games in which there is no period when the game is played for the last 
time. Tit-for-tat may also be effective in games that are repeated only a finite 
number of times, but on each occasion neither player knows whether or not this 
is the last time the game will be played. However, tit-for-tat is likely to be inef-
fective in games that are repeated only a finite number of times, and on the final 
occasion the players know they will not play the game again.
Suppose the game is played for the last time in period T. In period T, B knows 
‘defecting’ from Low to High will go unpunished, because the game will not be 
played again in T + 1. Therefore there is no deterrence and B defects. Realizing 
that B will behave in this way, A may as well abandon tit-for-tat in T, and also 
defect from Low to High. Therefore the non-cooperative outcome occurs in T.
From this reasoning, it might be supposed that the usefulness of the tit-for-
tat strategy now finishes in period T - 1. In fact, the situation is actually worse 
than this, because in period T - 1 the same difficulty occurs. In T - 1, B knows 
‘defecting’ from Low to High will go unpunished, because non-cooperation is 
going to happen anyway in T. Therefore there is no deterrence in T - 1 either, 
and B defects. Realizing that B will behave in this way, A may as well abandon 
tit-for-tat in T - 1, and also defect. Therefore the non-cooperative outcome also 
occurs in T - 1.
Similar reasoning will also apply in periods T - 2, T - 3 and so on, all the 
way back to the start of the game. In other words, the usefulness of tit-for-tat as 
a means for ensuring adherence to cooperative behaviour unravels completely 
due to the finite lifetime of the repeated game. A has no means of punishing B for 
non-cooperative behaviour in period T, so the tit-for-tat strategy fails in period 
T. But if tit-for-tat fails in period T, it also fails in T - 1; and if it fails in T - 1, 
it also fails in T - 2; and so on.

Summary
Game theory is an approach to decision-making in which two or more decision-
makers or players face choices between a number of possible courses of action 
or actions at any stage of the game. The property of interdependence is the key 
defining characteristic of a game. Although game theory has many applications 
throughout the social and physical sciences, it is the treatment of interdepen-
dence that makes game theory relevant to an understanding of decision-making 
in oligopoly.
A game in which all players choose their actions simultaneously, before know-
ing the actions chosen by other players, is called a simultaneous game. In a two-
person simultaneous game, when both players adopt a strictly dominant strategy, 
which is their best response no matter what strategy the other player chooses, 
a Dominant Strategy Equilibrium is achieved. Nash Equilibrium describes a 
broader range of game theory solutions, which satisfy the criterion that neither 
player wishes to depart from his current strategy if the other player continues to 
pursue his current strategy. A Dominant Strategy Equilibrium is always a Nash 
Equilibrium; but games in which one or both players have weakly dominant 

256	
|	 9    ■    Game theory
strategies, at least as good as any other strategy for all strategies the other player 
may choose, and a best response for at least one of the other player’s strategies, 
may also exhibit one or more Nash Equilibria. In such cases, it may be difficult 
or impossible to identify any unambiguous solution to the game.
Analysis of prisoner’s dilemma games shows that situations can arise in which 
players take decisions that appear rational from an individual perspective, but 
lead to outcomes that are suboptimal when assessed according to criteria reflect-
ing the players’ collective interest. Good communication between the players 
might assist in fostering cooperation, or rapid and effective punishment may be 
an effective deterrent against defection from cooperative behaviour.
For games with no Dominant Strategy Equilibrium, and games with either no 
Nash Equilibrium or multiple Nash Equilibria, players might decide to adopt mixed 
strategies, involving randomization of the choice between two or more actions, with 
specific probabilities defined for each action. In a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilib-
rium, each player selects the probabilities that maximise his own expected payoff, 
given the mixed strategy that is being employed by the other player.
In a sequential game, the players’ decisions follow a sequence. One player 
makes his decision, and the other player observes this decision before making 
his response. Threats of a retaliatory nature, issued by the second player in an 
attempt to deter the first player from acting in a manner detrimental to the sec-
ond player’s interests, are only credible if the second player would still be willing 
to execute the threat in the event that the first player took the action the threat 
was intended to deter. Nash Equilibria that rely only on credible threats are 
known as Subgame Perfect Equilibria (SPE). In games with multiple Nash Equi-
libria, some of which rely on non-credible threats, the concept of SPE is helpful 
in identifying which of the Nash Equilibria is most likely to occur. In some cases 
it may be possible for a player to strengthen the credibility of threatened retalia-
tory action by taking steps to alter the payoffs in a manner that effectively shuts 
down the option of backing away from execution of the threat.
A game played more than once, known as a multiple-period or repeated game, 
can be repeated either indefinitely or a finite number of times. In a repeated game 
with a prisoner’s dilemma structure, the players may be able to learn from their 
experience to cooperate by departing from their dominant strategies. Adherence 
to cooperative behaviour may be reinforced by the threat of punishment the next 
time the game is repeated, in the event that cooperation breaks down.
Discussion questions
	 1.	 Explain the relationship between Cournot’s solution to the problem of output determination in 
duopoly and the game theory concept of the Nash equilibrium.
	 2.	 In repeated games, it is often assumed that rivals are more likely to cooperate with one 
another than to compete. Under what conditions might competition be likely to break out in a 
repeated game?

Computational questions
	 1.	 The following payoff matrix shows the profits to two firms, A and B, that need to decide whether 
to set a high or a low price for identical products produced by both firms:
B’s campaign focused on:
Low
High
A’s price:
Low

50, 20
High
10, 60
40, 50
	 (a)	
Identify the Dominant Strategy Equilibrium for this game, and justify your answer.
	 (b)	
Is there an alternative cooperative solution that could offer both firms a higher return than 
they achieve at the Dominant Strategy Equilibrium?
	
(c)	
What factors might be helpful in allowing the firms to adhere to the cooperative solution?
	 2.	 Firm A is an established monopoly supplier of a particular product. Firm B is a supplier to a 
different market, and is considering a diversification strategy that involves entry into A’s 
market. Faced with the threat of entry from B, A must decide whether to accommodate B’s 
presence by cutting back its own output in the event that B does enter, or plan to fight a price 
war with B. If B does not enter, A earns a profit of 500 and B earns a profit of 300. If B enters and 
A decides to accommodate, A earns 200 and B earns 600. If A decides to fight B in a price war, 
both firms earn a profit of 100.
	 3.	 According to game theory, why might a player sometimes decide to randomise his strategies? 
Explain with reference to the concept of Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium.
	 4.	 In a technological standards game, two firms each have a competitive advantage with a different 
standard, but both will earn higher profits if they adopt a common standard, rather than 
each firm adopt the standard that each one prefers. Explain why the firms face a coordination 
problem in determining which standard to adopt, and suggest how this coordination problem 
might be resolved.
	 5.	 With reference to the relative magnitudes of the payoffs in the strategic form representation, 
examine the circumstances in which a sequential game would confer either a first-mover 
advantage, or a second-mover advantage.
	 6.	 In what ways might a firm that is threatened by an aggressive expansion strategy on the part 
of a competitor establish the credibility of its own threatened retaliatory action?
	 7.	 Explain the distinction between the concepts of Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium and Subgame 
Perfect Equilibrium.
	 8.	 With reference to Case Study 9.1, outline the contribution of the model of the prisoner’s 
dilemma to our understanding of strategic behaviour.

enter, A is presented with an opportunity to invest in an expansion of capacity. If A subsequently 
keeps the market to itself, or if A fights a price war with B, the investment will break even and 
A’s payoffs will be unaffected. If B enters and A accommodates by sharing the market with B, 
however, the investment will be loss-making, and A’s payoff will be reduced from 200 to 0.

	 4.	 You are given the following information, based on past observation of penalty kicks in football. 
60% of penalties where a right-footed penalty-taker shot towards the left-hand side of the goal 
(his stronger side), and the goalkeeper dived to the same side, were successfully converted. 
90% of penalties where a right-footed penalty-taker shot towards the left-hand side and the 
goalkeeper dived in the opposite direction were successfully converted. Where a right-footed 
penalty taker shot towards the right-hand side of the goal (his weaker side), 30% of penalties 
were successfully converted when the goalkeeper dived in the correct direction, and 80% were 
converted when the goalkeeper dived in the wrong direction.
	 (a)	
By applying the concept of Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, show that the optimal mixed 
strategy for the penalty-taker is to randomise his choice of direction, by shooting to the 
left-hand side with probability 0.625 and to the right-hand side with probability 0.375.
	 (b)	
Show that the goalkeeper’s optimal mixed strategy is also to randomise, diving towards the 
left-hand side of the goal (from the kicker’s perspective) with probability 0.75, and towards 
the right-hand side with probability 0.25.
	
(c)	
Why should the goalkeeper dive to the left-hand side of the goal (from the kicker’s 
perspective) more frequently than the penalty-taker kicks towards the left-hand side?

product that will have similar characteristics when produced by either firm. Firm A is an

entrant. Both firms have to decide whether to focus their advertising campaigns primarily on

Introduction
Any analysis of a firm’s competitive environment involves identifying the key 
elements of industry structure. Usually, the most important characteristics of 
industry structure include the number and size distribution of firms, the existence 
and height of barriers to entry and exit, and the degree of product differentia-
tion. Seller concentration refers to the first of these elements: the number and

size distribution of firms. In empirical research in industrial organization, seller 
concentration is probably the most widely used indicator of industry structure. 
Any specific seller concentration measure aims to reflect the implications of the 
number and size distribution of firms in the industry for the nature of competi-
tion, using a relatively simple numerical indicator. Both the number of firms and 
their size distribution (in other words, the degree of inequality in the firm sizes) 
are important. For example, the nature of competition in an industry compris-
ing ten equal-sized firms might be very different from the nature of competition 
in an industry comprising one dominant firm and nine smaller firms. A useful 
concentration measure should be capable of capturing the implications of both 
the number of firms and their relative sizes, for the nature of competition.
In view of the importance of concentration in empirical studies of competition, 
two chapters are devoted to this topic. Chapter 10 focuses on the measurement of 
concentration, while Chapter 11 focuses on the factors that determine the levels 
and trends in concentration in particular industries.
Before producing concentration measures for specific markets or industries, 
it is necessary to take decisions concerning the boundaries of the markets or 
industries that are being measured. Section 10.2 discusses the issues involved in 
market and industry definition, from both a theoretical and a practical perspec-
tive. Section 10.3 describes the schemes that are used to classify industries for 
the purposes of compiling the official UK and EU production and employment 
statistics. Section 10.4 describes the calculation of a number of alternative con-
centration or inequality measures, assuming individual size data are available 
for the firms that are members of the industry. The concentration or inequal-
ity measures include the n-firm concentration ratio, the Herfindahl–Hirschman 
index, the entropy coefficient and the Gini coefficient. Worked examples are 
used to illustrate the method of calculation for each measure, and to compare the 
properties and limitations of the various measures. Finally, Section 10.5 discusses 
some of the issues that should be considered when interpreting seller concentra-
tion measures.
	
10.2	
Market and industry definition
Markets and industries
In the calculation of any specific concentration measure, the definition of the 
relevant market is likely to be a crucial decision. The definition of a market 
is straightforward in theory, but often more problematic in practice. Service-
able theoretical definitions can be found in the works of the earliest nineteenth-­
century economists. For example, Cournot defined a market as:
the entire territory of which parts are so united by the relations of 
unrestricted commerce that prices there take the same level throughout, 
with ease and rapidity.
(Cournot, 1838, pp. 51–2Fn)

262	
|	 10    ■    Concentration: measurement and trends
Similarly, Marshall defined a market as an area in which:
prices of the same goods tend to equality with due allowance for 
transportation costs.
(Marshall, 1920, p. 270)
For practical purposes, the definition of any market contains both a product 
dimension and a geographic dimension. The product market definition should 
include all products that are close substitutes for one another, both in consump-
tion and in production. Goods 1 and 2 are substitutes in consumption if an 
increase in the price of Good 2 causes consumers to switch from Good 2 to 
Good 1. The degree of consumer substitution between Goods 1 and 2 is measured 
using the cross-price elasticity of demand. Good 1’s elasticity of demand with 
respect to a change in the price of Good 2 is:
 CED = Proportionate change in quantity demanded for Good 1
Proportionate change in price of Good 2
 CED = ¢ ∆Q1
∆P1
≤* ¢ P2
Q1
≤
A large and positive cross-price elasticity of demand indicates that the two goods 
are close substitutes in consumption (for example, butter and margarine). If the 
price of Good 2 rises, the demand for Good 1 also rises. Goods 1 and 2 should 
therefore be considered part of the same industry. But how large does the cross-
elasticity have to be; or, in other words, how close is ‘close’? Presumably Coca-
Cola and Pepsi are very close substitutes, and Coca-Cola and Tango are quite 
close substitutes. But what about Coca-Cola and mineral water, or Coca-Cola 
and coffee?
In contrast, a large and negative cross-price elasticity of demand indicates 
that the two goods are close complements (for example, personal computer and 
printer). However, this could also imply that they should be considered part of 
the same industry. Compact disc players and speakers might be grouped together 
as part of the consumer electronics industry. But what about cars and petrol? 
These goods are also complementary, but would it be sensible to include motor 
manufacturers and oil companies in the same industry group?
Good 1 produced by firm A, and Good 2 produced with similar technology by 
firm B are substitutes in production if an increase in the price of Good 1 causes 
firm B to switch production from Good 2 to Good 1. In this case, firms A and B 
are close competitors, even if from a consumer’s perspective Goods 1 and 2 are 
not close substitutes. For example, Good 1 might be cars and Good 2 might be 
military tanks. No consumer would decide to buy a tank simply because there 
has been an increase in the price of cars. But on receiving the same price signal, 
a tank producer might decide to switch to car production. The degree of pro-
ducer substitution between Goods 1 and 2 can be measured using the cross-price

elasticity of supply. Good 1’s elasticity of supply with respect to a change in the 
price of Good 2 is:
 CES = Proportionate change in quantity supplied of Good 1
Proportionate change in price of Good 2
 CES = ¢ ∆Q1
S
∆P2
≤* ¢ P2
Q1
S≤
A negative value for CES would suggest that Goods 1 and 2 are substitutes in 
production: if the price of Good 2 rises, the supply of Good 1 falls, as producers 
switch from Good 1 to Good 2. In this case, as well, there can be difficulties in 
implementation. For example, if ‘engineering’ is defined as ‘a process using lathes’, 
aerospace and bicycle manufacturers might be classified as direct competitors.
The geographic market definition involves determining whether an increase in 
the price of a product in one geographic location significantly affects either the 
demand or supply, and therefore the price, in another geographic location. If so, 
then both locations should be considered part of the same geographic market. 
In principle, a similar analysis involving spatial cross-price elasticities could be 
used to determine the geographic limits of market boundaries.
In practice, however, the problems are similar to those that arise in defining 
product markets. Should any specific market be defined at the local, regional, 
national, continental or global level? Substitution in consumption or production 
is always a matter of degree, but any operational market definition requires spe-
cific boundaries to be drawn, not only in ‘product space’, but also in geographic 
space. Elzinga and Hogarty (1973, 1978) suggest a practical procedure for defin-
ing geographic boundaries. This requires data on the extent to which consum-
ers in a regionally defined market purchase from regional producers (internal 
transactions) and from producers outside the region (external transactions). A 
regional market exists if the ratio of internal to total transactions is high; Elzinga 
and Hogarty suggest a critical value of 75 per cent.
National Economic Research Associates (NERA, 1992) and Bishop and 
Walker (2002) describe the methodology used to determine market definitions 
in the application of UK and EU competition policy (see also Chapter 24). The 
SSNIP (small but significant non-transitory increase in price) test is widely used. 
For product markets, this test assesses whether a (hypothetical) monopolist pro-
ducing Good 1 would find it profitable to increase price by between 5 per cent 
and 10 per cent. If so, Good 1 occupies a market by itself. If not, this suggests 
the producers of other goods constrain the monopolist’s pricing policy. There-
fore the market definition should include Good 1 and related Goods 2 and 3. A 
similar procedure is used to define a geographic market: would a (hypothetical) 
monopolist located in geographic area X find it profitable to increase price by 
between 5 per cent and 10 per cent? If so, X is a geographic market; if not, a wider 
geographic market definition is required. To implement the SSNIP test, various 
price and cross-price demand elasticity measures are used (Stigler and Sherwin, 
1985; Werden and Froeb, 1993; OFT, 1999).

Throughout much of microeconomics and industrial organization, the terms 
market and industry tend to be used rather loosely and, sometimes, interchange-
ably. Although the distinction is not rigid, it seems natural to use the term indus-
try to refer specifically to a market’s supply side or productive activities, while 
the term market encompasses both supply/production and demand/consumption. 
This book will usually adhere to this terminological convention. However, this 
convention is not universal. Kay (1990a) sees markets as representing demand 
conditions, while industries represent supply conditions. In Kay’s terminology, 
the strategic market, defined as the smallest geographic or product area in which 
a firm can successfully compete, brings the industry and market together.
The characteristics of the strategic market are influenced both by those 
demand factors which determine the economic market which the firm 
serves, and by those supply factors which determine the boundaries of 
the industry within which the firm operates.
(Kay, 1990a, p. 3)
Nevertheless, in this book the term ‘industry’ will usually refer to a group of firms 
producing and selling a similar product, using similar technology and perhaps 
obtaining factors of production from the same factor markets. A focus on factor 
markets might provide a yardstick for grouping firms into industries that differs 
from the criteria for market definition discussed above. However, once again 
there are practical difficulties. This type of classification might suggest that soap 
and margarine belong to the same industry, while woollen gloves and leather 
gloves belong to different industries. Finally, to emphasise the degree of over-
lap between markets and industries, it is interesting to note that Stigler’s (1955) 
industry definition provides a succinct summary of the criteria for identifying 
the boundaries of markets:
An industry should embrace the maximum geographical area and the 
maximum variety of productive activities in which there is strong long-
run substitution. If buyers can shift on a large scale from product or 
area B to area A, then the two should be combined. If producers can 
shift on a large scale from B to A, again they should be combined. 
Economists usually state this in an alternative form: All products or 
enterprises with large long-run cross elasticities of either supply or 
demand should be combined into a single industry.
(Stigler, 1955, p. 4)

Official schemes for industry classification
Although in principle the definition of markets and industries may raise a num-
ber of difficult issues, for the practical purpose of compiling official production 
and employment statistics, some specific scheme for defining and classifying 
industries is required. In 1992, the European Commission introduced the current 
classification system that is used throughout the European Union (EU), known

as Nomenclature générale des activités économiques dans les communautés Euro-
péennes (NACE). At the same time, the UK’s Standard Industrial Classification 
(SIC), originally introduced in 1948 and revised in 1980, was revised to achieve 
consistency with NACE. The objective was to standardise industry definitions 
across member states, making inter-country comparisons easier and providing 
a statistical basis for the harmonization of competition and industrial policy 
within the EU. The UK’s 1992 SIC (SIC 1992) is based on a four-digit number-
ing system, while NACE adds a fifth digit in some cases. There are 17 sections, 
labelled alphabetically from A to Q. These are reproduced in Table 10.1, which 
provides a comparison with the earlier SIC 1980.
Although there is consistency between the industry definitions used in the 
UK’s SIC 1992 system and the EU’s NACE system, there are minor differences 
in the numerical presentation of the various levels of both systems. For example, 
NACE contains more levels in total than SIC 1992. Most of the NACE sections 
are subdivided into subsections by the addition of a second letter. Not all sec-
tions are subdivided: for example, section B, Fishing, has no subsections. In 
contrast, section D, Manufacturing, has 14 subsections. Subsections are then 
subdivided into divisions, which correspond to a two-digit classification. The 
full list of NACE divisions is reproduced in Table 10.2. Divisions are further 
subdivided into three-digit groups, four-digit classes and, in some cases, five-digit 
subclasses. For example, Table 10.3 shows all layers of classification between the 
most general ‘Manufacturing’ section D, and the most specific ‘Bacon and ham’ 
subclass 15.13/1.

Measures of seller concentration
Seller concentration, an indicator of the number and size distribution of firms, 
can be measured at two levels:
1.	 For all firms that form part of an economy, located within some specific 
geographical boundary.
2.	 For all firms classified as members of some industry or market, again located 
within some specific geographical boundary.
The first type of seller concentration, known as aggregate concentration, reflects 
the importance of the largest firms in the economy as a whole. Although in 
practice data are relatively hard to come by, in principle aggregate concentration 
is relatively straightforward to measure. Typically, aggregate concentration is 
Table 10.2  (continued)

268	
|	 10    ■    Concentration: measurement and trends
measured as the share of the n largest firms in the total sales, assets or employ-
ment (or other appropriate size measure) for the economy as a whole. The num-
ber of firms included might be n = 50, 100, 200 or 500. Aggregate concentration 
might be important for several reasons:
■ If aggregate concentration is high, this might have implications for levels of 
seller concentration in particular industries.
■ Aggregate concentration data might reveal information about the economic 
importance of large diversified firms, which is not adequately reflected in indi-
cators of seller concentration for particular industries.
■ If aggregate concentration is high, this might indicate that the economy’s larg-
est firms have opportunities to exert a disproportionate degree of influence 
over politicians or regulators, which might render the political system vulner-
able to abuse, or the regulation system vulnerable to regulatory capture.
The second type of seller concentration, known as industry concentration or mar-
ket concentration, reflects the importance of the largest firms in some particular 
industry or market. In some cases, it may also be relevant to measure buyer 
concentration, in order to assess the importance of the largest buyers. This might 
arise in the case of an industry which supplies a specialised producer good, for 
which the market includes only a very small number of buyers.
The rest of Section 10.4 focuses on the measurement of seller concentration 
at industry level. Clearly, the number and size distribution of the firms is a key 
element of industry structure. Any specific measure of seller concentration at 
industry level aims to provide a convenient numerical measure reflecting the 
implications of the number and size distribution of firms for the nature of compe-
tition in the industry concerned. In empirical research in industrial organization, 
concentration is probably the most widely used indicator of industry structure.
Economists have employed a number of alternative concentration measures at 
industry level. To assist users in making an informed choice between the alterna-
tives that are available, Hannah and Kay (1977) suggest a number of general cri-
teria that any specific concentration measure should satisfy if it is to adequately 
reflect the most important characteristics of the firm size distribution:
■ Suppose industries A and B have equal numbers of firms. Industry A should 
be rated as more highly concentrated than industry B if the firms’ cumulative 
market share (when the firms are ranked in descending order of size) is greater 
for industry A than for industry B at all points in the size distribution.
■ A transfer of market share from a smaller to a larger firm should always 
increase concentration.
■ There should be a market share threshold such that if a new firm enters the 
industry with a market share below the threshold, concentration is reduced. 
Similarly, if an incumbent firm with a market share below the threshold exits 
from the industry, concentration is increased.
■ Any merger between two incumbent firms should always increase concentration.
As shown below, not all of the seller concentration measures that are in use satisfy 
all of the Hannah and Kay criteria. This section examines the construction and

interpretation of the most common measures of seller concentration. These are 
the n-firm concentration ratio, the Herfindahl–Hirschman index, the ­Hannah–
Kay index, the entropy coefficient, the variance of the logarithms of firm sizes 
and the Gini coefficient.
To demonstrate the calculation of the various concentration measures that are 
described below, Table 10.4 shows sales data for six hypothetical industries, I1 
to I6, all of which have the same total sales.
■ The nine firms in I1 have a typically skewed distribution of sales figures.
■ The nine equal-sized firms in I2 all have the same sales figures.
■ In I3, the number of equal-sized firms is six (rather than nine).
■ I4 is similar to I1, except the size distribution is more heavily skewed (with the 
largest firm in I4 taking a larger market share than its counterpart in I1, and 
the smallest firm in I4 taking a smaller market share than its counterpart in I1).
■ I5 is the same as I1 except for the three largest firms, which are equal-sized in I5.
■ Finally, the six largest firms in I1 are the same as their counterparts in I6, but 
the three smallest firms in I1 have been merged to form a single firm in I6.
For each of I1 to I6, Table 10.5 shows the numerical values of the concentration 
measures that are presented below. For I1, Tables 10.6 to 10.10 show the calcula-
tions for each concentration measure in full.
n-firm concentration ratio
The n-firm concentration ratio, usually denoted CRn, measures the share of the 
industry’s n largest firms in some measure of total industry size. The most widely 
used size measures are based on sales, assets or employment data. The formula 
for the n-firm concentration ratio is as follows:
CRn = a

where si is the share of the i-th largest firm in total industry sales, assets or 
employment.
In other words, si = xi/ a
N
i=1
xi, where xi is the size of firm i, and N is the 
number of firms in the industry. There are no set rules for the choice of n, the 
number of large firms to be included in the calculation of CRn. However, CRn for 
n = 3, 4, 5 or 8 are among the most widely quoted n-firm concentration ratios.
For most practical purposes, both the choice of n and the choice of size mea-
sure may not be too crucial. For example, Bailey and Boyle (1971) find that 
n-firm concentration ratios for several values of n are highly correlated. In prac-
tice, an attractive property of the n-firm concentration ratio is that it requires 
size data on the top n firms only, together with the corresponding aggregate size 
measure for the entire industry. In other words, the data requirements are less 
demanding than for the other concentration measures that are described below, 
each of which requires individual size data for all of the industry’s member firms. 
However, the use of data for the top n firms only is also a limitation, in the sense 
that no account is taken of the number and size distribution of firms that are 
outside the top n. Furthermore, no account is taken of the size distribution within 
the top n firms.
These points are illustrated in Tables 10.4 and 10.5 by I5 and I6, both of which 
have the same CR3 as I1, and in Table 10.6 by I1. However, I5 might well be 
regarded as less highly concentrated than I1, and I6 as more highly concentrated:
■ The top three firms in I5 are equal-sized, while the size distribution of the top 
three in I1 is skewed, making I5 more competitive than I1.
■ The three smallest firms in I1 have been merged to form one larger firm in I6, 
making I6 less competitive than I1.
These comparisons show that the n-firm concentration ratio fails to meet several 
of the Hannah and Kay criteria for a satisfactory concentration measure. For 
example, a transfer of sales from a smaller to a larger firm does not necessarily 
cause CRn to increase; and a merger between two or more industry member firms 
does not necessarily cause CRn to increase.
Herfindahl–Hirschman (HH) index
Working independently, both Hirschman (1945) and Herfindahl (1950) suggested a 
concentration measure based on the sum of the squared market shares of all firms 
in the industry. The Herfindahl–Hirschman (HH) index is calculated as follows:
HH = a
N
i=1
si
2
where si is the market share of firm i, and N is the total number of firms in the 
industry. For an industry that consists of a single monopoly producer, HH = 1. 
A monopolist has a market share of s1 = 1. Therefore s2
1 = 1, ensuring HH = 1. 
For an industry with N firms, the maximum possible value of the Herfindahl–
Hirschman index is HH = 1, and the minimum possible value is HH = 1/N.

272	
|	 10    ■    Concentration: measurement and trends
■ The maximum value of HH = 1 occurs when the size distribution of the N 
firms is highly skewed. In the most extreme case, one dominant firm has a 
market share only fractionally smaller than 1, and N - 1 small firms each has 
a market share only fractionally larger than zero. Essentially, this is the same 
as the case of monopoly, for which HH = 1 as shown above.
■ The minimum value of HH = 1/N occurs when the industry consists of N 
equal-sized firms. In this case, each firm has a market share of si = 1/N. 
Therefore,
si
2 = (1/N)2 fo i = 1 c N, and HH = a
N
i=1
 (1/N)2 = N(1/N)2 = 1/N
In Tables 10.4 and 10.5, I2, I1 and I4 each have N = 9 firms, and the respective 
size distributions are equal sized, skewed and highly skewed. HH = 0.1111 (or 
1/9) for I2, HH = 0.2108 for I1 and HH = 0.3346 for I4. This confirms that HH 
increases as the size distribution becomes more unequal. It is important to notice 
also that HH succeeds where CR3 fails in identifying I5 as less concentrated 
than I1, and I6 as more concentrated than I1. For I5, I1 and I6, the values of 
HH shown in Table 10.5 are 0.1924, 0.2108 and 0.2133, respectively. Of all the 
concentration measures considered in this section, the HH index and the closely 
related Hannah and Kay index (see below) are generally the most satisfactory in 
respect of their ability to satisfy the Hannah and Kay criteria.
A practical difficulty with the HH index is its requirement for individual size 
data on all of the industry’s member firms. In contrast, CRn only requires indi-
vidual data on the top n firms, and an industry total. However, it can be shown 
that even if individual data are not available for the smaller firms, a reasonable 
approximation to HH is obtained using data on the larger firms only. For I1, 
suppose individual sales data are available for firms 1 to 6 only, and an industry 
total sales figure is also available. Suppose also that the total number of firms 
in I1 is unknown. Then the maximum value HH could take (if one other firm 
accounted for all of the remaining sales) is HH = 0.2133. The minimum value 
HH could take (if a large number of very small firms accounted for the remaining 
sales, each with a very small share) is HH = 0.2093. The actual value of HH for 
I1 is 0.2108. Therefore, the range of values that HH could conceivably take is 
small. No matter what assumptions are made about the missing individual firm 
size data, a reasonably close approximation to the true value of HH is obtained.
A reciprocal measure, known as the numbers equivalent of the HH index, is 
defined as (1/HH). The numbers equivalent is an inverse measure of concentra-
tion. For an industry with N firms, the minimum possible value of the numbers 
equivalent is (1/HH) = 1, and the maximum possible value is (1/HH) = N.
■ The minimum value of (1/HH) = 1 occurs when HH = 1, and corresponds to 
the case of one dominant firm and N - 1 small firms.
■ The maximum value of (1/HH) = N occurs when HH = 1/N, and corre-
sponds to the case of N equal-sized firms.
Accordingly, the numbers equivalent is useful as a measure of inequality in the 
firm size distribution. For an industry with N firms, the minimum possible value, 

	
	
	
10.4  Measures of seller concentration	 |	
273
(1/HH) = 1, corresponds to the most unequal size distribution; and the maxi-
mum possible value, (1/HH) = N, corresponds to the most equal size distribu-
tion. In Tables 10.4 and 10.5, I2 with N = 9 equal-sized firms has (1/HH) = 9, 
and I3 with N = 6 equal-sized firms has (1/HH) = 6. I1 with N = 9 firms and 
a skewed size distribution has (1/HH) = 4.74, and I4 with N = 9 and a highly 
skewed distribution has (1/HH) = 2.99. However, even I4 falls some way short 
of the maximum inequality case of (1/HH) = 1.
Hannah and Kay index
It is possible to interpret the Herfindahl–Hirschman index as a weighted sum of 
the market shares of all firms in the industry, with the market shares themselves 
used as weights. A general expression for a weighted sum of market shares is 
a
N
i=1
wisi, where wi denotes the weight attached to firm i. Setting wi = si reproduces 
the Herfindahl–Hirschman index:
HH = a
N
i=1
wisi = a
N
i=1
si
2.
Therefore HH is a weighted sum of market shares, with larger weights attached 
to the larger firms and vice versa.
Hannah and Kay (1977) suggest the following generalization of the HH index:
HK(a) = a
N
i=1
s1
a
where a is a parameter to be selected. a should be greater than zero, but not 
equal to one, because HK(1) = 1 for any firm size distribution. In terms of the 
‘weighted sum’ interpretation of the HH index, the choice of a in the HK(a) 
index enables the relative weights attached to the larger and small firms to vary 
from the proportions used in the HH index. For the HK(a) index, the weights 
can be defined wi = si
a-1.
Accordingly, HK(a) = a
N
i=1
wisi = a
N
i=1
si
a-1si = a
N
i=1
s1
a.
■ If a = 2, the Hannah–Kay index is the same as the Herfindahl–Hirschman 
index, or HK(2) = HH.
■ If a 6 2, HK (a) attaches relatively more weight to the smaller firms and 
relatively less weight to the larger firms than HH.
■ Conversely, if a 7 2, HK (a) attaches relatively more weight to the larger 
firms and relatively less weight to the smaller firms than HH.
The last two points are illustrated in Table 10.7. For I1 the contribution to 
the HK(1.5) index of firm 1 (the largest firm) is 45.8 per cent (0.2003 out of 
0.4376). But firm 1’s contribution to the HK(2.5) index is 63.8 per cent (0.0686 
out of 0.1076). Previous comments about the favourable properties of the HH 
index apply in equal measure to the HK(a) index. Furthermore, the larger the

value of a, the smaller the degree of inaccuracy if the HK(a) index is calculated 
using accurate individual data for the largest firms, but estimated data for the 
smaller firms.
The expression for the corresponding inverse concentration measure, the num-
bers equivalent of the Hannah–Kay index, is as follows:

as before.
The numbers equivalent can be defined for any value of a that is greater than 
zero apart from a = 1. The properties and interpretation of the numbers equiva-
lent are the same as before. For an industry with N firms, the minimum value is 
1 (one dominant firm and N - 1 small firms); and the maximum value is N (all 
N firms are equal-sized). In Tables 10.4 and 10.5, n(a) = 9 for I2 (with N = 9 
equal-sized firms) and n(a) = 6 for I3 (with N = 6 equal-sized firms), no matter 
what value is chosen for a.
Entropy coefficient
The entropy coefficient, E, is another ‘weighted sum’ concentration measure. In 
this case, however, the weights are inversely related to the firms’ market shares. 
The weights are the natural logarithms of the reciprocals of the firms’ market 
shares (see Table 10.8). E is defined as follows:

E = 1.7855
Relative entropy:   RE = E/loge(N) = 1.7855/loge(9) = 1.7855/2.1972 = 0.8126
Numbers equivalent:   n(1) = exp(E) = exp(1.7855) = 5.96
E is an inverse concentration measure: E is small for a highly concentrated indus-
try, and E is large for an industry with low concentration. In Tables 10.4 and 10.5, 
E is 1.3721 (for I4), 1.7855 (I1) and 1.8236 (I5). Therefore E correctly identifies I4 
as more concentrated than I1, and I1 as more concentrated than I5. The minimum 
possible value is E = 0, for an industry comprising a single monopoly producer. 
The maximum possible value is E = loge(N), for an industry comprising N equal-
sized firms. Because the maximum value of E depends on the number of firms, it 
may be inconvenient to use entropy coefficients to compare concentration for two 
different-sized industries. However, it is straightforward to define a standardised 
entropy coefficient, whose maximum value does not depend on the number of 
firms. This is known as the relative entropy coefficient, RE, defined as follows:
RE = E/loge(N) = [1/loge(N)]a
N
i=1
loge(1/si)
The minimum possible value is RE = 0 for a monopoly, and the maximum pos-
sible value is RE = 1 for an industry comprising N equal-sized firms.
Finally, as noted above, both E and the numbers equivalent of the HK index 
are inverse concentration measures. Hannah and Kay (1977, pp. 56–7) dem-
onstrate the mathematical relationship between them. The numbers equivalent 
of the HK index, n(a) = ¢ a
N
i=1
si
a≤

 is not defined for a = 1. However, it 
can be shown that as a approaches one, the limiting value of n(a) is exp(E) or 
eE = q

i=1
(1/si)si. Therefore exp(E) can be interpreted as a number equivalent-
type measure that corresponds to the case a = 1.
Variance of the logarithms of firm sizes
In statistics, a variance provides a measure of dispersion or inequality within 
any dataset. In the case of data on the sizes of firms in an industry, the statistical 
property of dispersion or inequality is closely related (but not identical) to the 

276	
|	 10    ■    Concentration: measurement and trends
economic property of seller concentration. In Table 10.4, dispersion in I2 is zero 
(because all firm sizes are the same), but dispersion in I4 is much higher (due to 
the inequality in the firm size distribution). Clearly, seller concentration is higher 
in I4 than in I2. Accordingly, the variance of the logarithms of firm sizes, VL, 
can be included among the list of concentration measures (Aitchison and Brown, 
1966) (see Table 10.9). 
VL is defined as follows:
VL = (1/N)a
N
i=1
[loge(xi) - x]2 where x = (1/N)a
N
i=1
loge(xi)
and xi is the size of firm i (as before, measured using sales, assets, employment 
or some other appropriate size indicator).
For the purposes of calculating VL, the firm size data are expressed in loga-
rithmic form for the following reasons:
■ Most industries have a highly skewed firm size distribution, with large numbers 
of small firms, fewer medium-sized firms and very few large firms. The variance 
of the (untransformed) firm size data would tend to be unduly influenced by 
the data for the largest firms. The log-transformation reduces or eliminates the 
skewness in the original distribution, enabling VL to provide a more reasonable 
measure of inequality across the entire firm size distribution.
■ The variance of the (untransformed) firm size data would be influenced by the 
scaling or units of measurement of the data. VL, in contrast, is unaffected by 
scaling. For example, if inflation caused the reported sales data of all firms 
to increase by 10 per cent, the variance of the (untransformed) sales data 
would increase, but VL would be unaffected. In this case, there is no change

in concentration or dispersion because the sales of all firms are increased in 
the same proportions. VL reflects this situation accurately.
Although VL has occasionally been used as a measure of seller concentration, 
it is more accurate to interpret VL as a measure of dispersion or inequality in 
the firm size distribution. The distinction can be illustrated using the following 
examples taken from Tables 10.4 and 10.5:
■ Both I2 and I3 have VL = 0 because in both cases all firms are equal-sized, so 
there is no inequality. From an industrial organization perspective, however, 
it seems clear that I3 is more highly concentrated than I2. I3 has fewer firms 
than I2, making it more likely that a cooperative or collusive outcome will be 
achieved.
■ An economist would regard I6 as more concentrated than I1. However, the 
merger between the three smallest firms in I1 to form I6 implies I6 has a 
lower degree of inequality in its firm size distribution than I1. Accordingly 
VL is smaller for I6 than for I1. Switching from I1 to I6, VL moves in the 
opposite direction to HH and HK(a), and in the wrong direction from the 
economist’s perspective.
Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient
A Lorenz curve (Lorenz, 1905) shows the variation in the cumulative size of the n 
largest firms in an industry, as n varies from 1 to N (where N is the total number 
of firms). Figure 9.1 shows a typical Lorenz curve. The firms are represented in 
a horizontal array, from the largest to the smallest (reading from left to right) 
along the horizontal axis. The vertical axis shows the cumulative size (the sum 
of the sizes of all firms from firm 1 to firm n, as a function of n).
■ If all of the firms are equal-sized, the Lorenz curve is the 45-degree line OCA. 
At point C, for example, exactly half of the industry’s member firms account 
for exactly half of the total industry size, represented by the distance OD.
■ If the firm size distribution is skewed, the Lorenz curve is the concave curve 
OBA. At point B, exactly half of the industry’s member firms account for 
three-quarters of the total industry size, represented by OD.
The Lorenz curve can be used to define a concentration measure due to Gini 
(1912), known as the Gini coefficient. With reference to Figure 10.1, the Gini 
coefficient is defined as follows:
G = area of the crescent between OBA and OCA
area of the triangle ODA
■ The maximum possible value of G = 1 corresponds to the case of one domi-
nant firm with a market share approaching one, and N - 1 very small firms 
each with a negligible market share. In this case the Lorenz curve approaches 
the line ODA, so the numerator and denominator in the formula for G are 
the same.

278	
|	 10    ■    Concentration: measurement and trends
■ The minimum value of G = 0 corresponds to the case of N equal-sized firms. 
In this case the Lorenz curve is the 45-degree line OCA, so the numerator in 
the formula for G is zero.
The formula definition for the Gini coefficient is as follows:
G = d
a
N
n=1 a
n
i=1
xi
0.5(N + 1) a
N
i=1
xi
t - 1
where xi is the size of firm i (as before, measured using sales, assets, employment 
or some other appropriate size indicator) when the firms are ranked in descend-
ing order of size.
Like the variance of logarithmic firm sizes measure, the Gini coefficient is 
most accurately interpreted as a measure of inequality in the firm size distri-
bution. In fact, elsewhere in economics one of the best known applications of 
the Gini coefficient is for the measurement of inequality in household incomes. 
Tables 10.4 and 10.5 show that both I2 and I3 have G = 0, because in both 
cases all of the firms are equal-sized. As before, however, an industrial econo-
mist might regard I3 as more highly concentrated than I2. Furthermore, I6 has 
G = 0.3129, smaller than G = 0.4482 for I1, but an industrial economist would 
regard I6 as more concentrated than I1.
Section 10.4 concludes with three case studies that focus on the relevance of 
seller concentration for policy debates concerning competition. Case Study  10.1 
examines UK banking, Case Study  10.2 examines US newspapers and broad-
casting, and Case Study  10.3 examines the pricing of auditing services.

GE pulls $3.3bn deal with Electrolux  
after regulatory opposition
FT
Electrolux’s attempts to grab a big slice of the North American market by buying GE’s 
domestic appliances business have failed after the US conglomerate abandoned the deal 
because of opposition from regulators. The Swedish manufacturer of cookers, fridges and 
washing machines announced in September last year it had agreed to buy GE’s unit for 
$3.3bn as part of efforts to reduce Electrolux’s dependence on Europe. The deal would 
have combined the number two and three suppliers of domestic appliances in the US and 
given Electrolux about 34 per cent of the market, according to data from Ibis World, a 
consultancy. It was set to be the biggest acquisition in Electrolux’s history, and would 
enable the company to go head to head with Whirlpool in the US.
But GE on Monday announced it had terminated the agreement with Electrolux fol-
lowing opposition from the US Department of Justice, which launched a lawsuit to block 
the deal in July. The DoJ argued the transaction would reduce competition in the supply 
of kitchen appliances, with consumers likely to pay 5 per cent more for cookers, including 
ranges and wall ovens, as a result. ‘This deal was bad for the millions of consumers who 
buy cooking appliances every year,’ said deputy assistant attorney-general David Gelfand 
at the DoJ’s antitrust division. Combined volume sales of cooking appliances by GE and 

280	
|	 10    ■    Concentration: measurement and trends
Electrolux amounted to 32 per cent of the US market in 2014, according to research by 
Euromonitor, a research firm. Whirlpool had a 21 per cent share. The principal objec-
tion raised by the DoJ was that the deal would create a duopoly in sales of cookers to US 
builders and property managers. Electrolux, GE and Whirlpool already control 90 per 
cent of this market, said the DoJ in a court filing, because they are the companies most 
able to meet the needs of those buyers in terms of choice of appliances, delivery schedules 
and servicing.
The DoJ cited Herfindahl–Hirschman indices, measures of concentration in a market, 
which it said showed that already weak competition would be undermined even further 
by the deal. In range cookers sold through the ‘contract channel’ to builders and prop-
erty managers, the deal would increase the HHI by 1,750 points to 5,100, said the DoJ. 
Any market with an index above 2,500 is considered by the US government to be ‘highly 
concentrated’. Any deal that raises the index by more than 200 points is seen as likely to 
increase market power, and hence create a risk of higher prices. Electrolux’s argument 
that authorities had approved a similar appliances deal between Whirlpool and Maytag 
in 2006 without triggering higher prices appeared to cut no ice with the regulators.
Shares in Electrolux closed down 13 per cent on Monday to SKr207, the steepest one-
day fall in more than four years. Keith McLoughlin, chief executive of Electrolux, said: 
‘Although we are disappointed that the acquisition will not be completed, Electrolux 
is confident that the group has strong capabilities to continue to grow and develop its 
position as a global appliances manufacturer.’ However, questions are now expected 
to be raised over Electrolux’s efforts to pursue the transaction with GE in spite of the 
DoJ’s lawsuit.

Champions League: Does money  
help or hinder competition in football? 
FT
Economists sometimes measure how likely a market is to be an oligopoly using the four-
firm concentration ratio. It measures how much of the market goes to the four biggest 
companies. Apply that concept to European football and it looks increasingly like the 
leagues are becoming their own oligopolies. Back in the 1995–96 season the top four teams 
in the Bundesliga, English Premier League and the Spanish La Liga won about 25 per cent 
of the total leagues points; in the past season it was a third of all points.

	
	
	
10.4  Measures of seller concentration	 |	
281
But there’s one crucial difference compared with a normal oligopoly. Most of these 
teams aren’t making much of a profit. Instead money is being ploughed into them. Finish 
in the top four in one of these leagues and a team qualifies for the Champions League. 
That brings in more revenue, which can then be used to construct a better team, attracting 
more fans and better sponsorship deals continuing the cycle.
Nowhere is the value of investment more in evidence than the English Premier League. 
Until Roman Abramovich invested in Chelsea, the club hovered just [below] the top five. 
For the five years after the Russian took ownership, it finished first or second – which 
meant Arsenal, who had been perennial title contenders, found themselves displaced to 
third or fourth.
Foreign money in the Premier League has made it more competitive at the top, changing 
the top four of Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea into a top six with Tot-
tenham and Manchester City added. And the recent sporting successes of German champi-
ons Bayern Munich show what can happen when one team establishes financial dominance. 
In the 2012–13 season Bayern’s revenues were 70 per cent higher than their nearest rivals, 
Borussia Dortmund. And in that and the subsequent campaign, they strolled to the league 
title, winning a greater share of the Bundesliga’s points – adjusted for its smaller number of 
teams – than any top flight German, Spanish or English side in the modern era.

Case study 10.3
Zombie hordes thrive, await further hedge  
fund corpses
FT
Close to a tenth of all hedge funds tracked by HFR succumbed to the inevitable last year 
as 904 hedge funds liquidated. Their historic performance will live on in the databases 
of hedge fund returns, but like more than two-thirds of all hedge funds that have ever 
existed, they are dead, defunct and arguing with their investors over valuations for those 
lingering illiquid assets.
To put that in perspective, half of all individual hedge funds have closed in the last five 
years. It is exactly what should be expected, given that the average life of a hedge fund 
which makes it past the 12 month mark is just over five years, but it is a salient fact that 
seems to escape the promotion of hedge funds as an asset class, a diversifier or a handy 
set of uncorrelated investment returns.
The overall number of hedge funds reporting to HFR has grown, to 8,190 last year 
from 6,895 at the end of 2008, but only because new funds constantly spring into life. In 

282	
|	 10    ■    Concentration: measurement and trends
the last five years 4,318 hedge funds have closed. If we add on the 1,471 zombies added 
to the hoard in 2008, that is 5,789 dead funds, set against the 7,634 live hedge funds and 
2,462 fund of funds that existed at the end of 2007.
That total of closures includes fund of fund numbers that have shrunk by 686 over the 
same period, very slim times for fund of fund launches, so the number for individual fund 
closures looks to be in the 4,000 to 5,000 range.
All of which surely makes the selection problem insurmountable for any pension fund 
of size. To invest in hedge funds given such turnover means selecting a fresh portfolio of 
funds every single year. There is a small window after a fund has proven itself (say two 
or three years) and grown to sufficient size, but before the five-year mark at which the 
average fund becomes a zombie.
Remember also that there is no persistence in returns – good investment performance in 
one year really has no bearing on investment performance in following years. Oh, and the 
hedge fund industry as a whole hasn’t produced alpha/added value to simple portfolios 
for years, since its assets under management ballooned. But let’s say you are an invest-
ment consultant paid to advise pension funds on manager selection. One solution would 
be to focus on the quality of a hedge funds infrastructure as big solid asset gathering funds 
are less likely to become zombies.
Hence, perhaps, what the Financial Conduct Authority reports in its latest survey of 
the UK hedge fund industry, capturing 49 firms offering 106 individual funds:
‘Over time, the industry has become more concentrated. The survey shows 
that the 20 largest firms control 82% of the sample’s NAV (net AUM). The 
concentration ratio rises significantly when considering gross notional exposure 
(GNE) at the fund level. The 20 largest funds account for 94% of the sample 
GNE. These 20 funds are managed by 12 different firms’.

10.5	
Interpretation of concentration measures
Subject to the availability of data, the calculation of any of the concentration 
indicators detailed above is straightforward. Some of the technical limitations of 
individual measures have already been identified and discussed. However, even if 
the technical issues are disregarded, the broader interpretation of concentration 
indicators can still be problematic, due to inherent difficulties in defining the 
boundaries of the relevant industry or market (Curry and George, 1983). Some 
of the key issues are as follows:
■ Choice of appropriate industry definition.  A concentration measure is specific 
to an industry, but any industry definition is arbitrary to some extent. Indus-
try definitions should allow the calculation of concentration measures that 

	
	
	
10.5  Interpretation of concentration measures	 |	
283
sensibly reflect market power. Therefore a properly defined industry should 
include producers of all substitute products. But how close does an alternative 
product have to be in order to count as a substitute? Substitution is a matter of 
degree, and the difficulty lies in knowing where to draw the line. By defining 
the limits very tightly, almost any firm could be considered as a monopolist. In 
one case in the US, the relevant market was described as ‘the industry supply-
ing paint to General Motors’. Since DuPont was at the time the only supplier 
of paint to General Motors, DuPont immediately achieved monopoly status. 
In general, the more refined the industry definition (the greater the number of 
digits), the higher measured concentration is likely to be. The choice of suit-
able industry or market definitions for decision-making in competition policy 
is discussed in Chapter 24.
■ Defining the boundaries of the market.  The selection of the cohort of firms 
whose size data are to be used to measure concentration also includes a geo-
graphical dimension. The relevant market for one firm might be local; another 
firm might service an international market. Naturally, concentration measures 
calculated from international or national data tend to suggest lower levels of 
concentration than regional or local measures. For example, public transport 
services by bus are provided by small numbers of carriers in each city. There-
fore, locally, seller concentration tends to be high. Measured at national level, 
however, concentration tends to be much lower.
■ Treatment of imports and exports.  If (as is likely) producers of imported goods 
are excluded from the calculation of a concentration measure for an industry 
in the national economy, measured concentration might either overstate or 
understate the true importance of the largest firms. For example, if a single 
foreign firm imported goods that accounted for 40 per cent of the market, 
making it the largest single producer, CRn calculated using data on domestic 
firms only would seriously understate the true degree of concentration. If on 
the other hand the imported goods’ 40 per cent market share was accounted 
for by a large number of small foreign producers, CRn would overstate true 
concentration. Similar issues arise if (as is likely) the reported sales of domes-
tic firms include sales in export markets. One firm might have extremely high 
sales relative to all the rest, but if these sales are dispersed across several highly 
competitive export markets, the firm does not have much market power. But 
a high concentration ratio might easily be misinterpreted to suggest the oppo-
site. These and other similar issues are discussed by Utton (1982).
■ Multi-product operations.  Concentration measures based on a firm’s reported 
company accounts data might not take account of diversification: many larger 
firms sell goods or services across a wide range of separate markets. Typically, 
a plant or firm is classified as part of the census industry to which its main 
product belongs. If 60 per cent of a firm’s sales revenues are derived from an 
industry A product, and 40 per cent from an industry B product, then all of 
that firm’s sales (or other firm size data) may be attributed to industry A. Con-
centration measures calculated from data of this kind might tend to overstate 
or understate concentration in both industries. Only by pure chance (if all 
of these ‘diversified firm’ effects cancel each other out) will concentration be 
measured accurately.

|	 10    ■    Concentration: measurement and trends
Although at first sight the choice between the various concentration measures 
might seem almost bewildering, this decision often turns out not to be too crucial 
in practice. Most of the measures described above tend to be highly correlated 
with each other (Davies, 1979; Kwoka, 1981). However, in the final analysis it 
may be impossible to quantify all relevant aspects of an industry’s competitive 
nature in a single numerical measure. For example, the number of firms in an 
industry might be small, but if their objectives and modes of operation differ 
fundamentally, they may disregard their interdependence and behave like atom-
istic competitors. Even the narrower and purely ‘economic’ characteristics may 
be hard to pin down. ‘[N]o single concentration measure effectively considers the 
three underlying determinants of competition: sector size, inequality of market 
shares and coalition potential’ (Vanlommel et al., 1977, p. 15).

Summary
Seller concentration, the number and size distribution of firms in an industry, 
is one of the key characteristics of industry structure. Chapter 10 has examined 
the measurement of seller concentration. Any specific measure aims to reflect the 
implications of the number of firms and their size distribution for competition 
in the industry concerned.
In measuring seller concentration for any industry or market, it is necessary 
to take decisions concerning industry or market definition. The definition of 
any market contains both a product dimension and a geographic dimension. 
The product market definition should include all products that are close substi-
tutes for one another, both in consumption and in production. The geographic 
market definition involves determining whether an increase in the price of a 
product in one location significantly affects demand or supply elsewhere. Price 
and cross-price elasticities can be used to determine the limits of product and 
geographic market boundaries. In practice, however, substitution is always a 
matter of degree, and decisions concerning boundaries are always arbitrary to 
some extent. The UK’s Standard Industrial Classification and NACE, its EU 
counterpart, are currently the official standard used in the compilation of gov-
ernment statistics.
The most widely used seller concentration measures include the n-firm con-
centration ratio, the Herfindahl–Hirschman index, the Hannah–Kay index, the 
entropy coefficient, the variance of the logarithms of firm sizes, and the Gini coef-
ficient. The method of calculation for all of these measures has been described in 
detail, and their strengths and limitations have been assessed.

287
	
11.1	
Introduction
Chapter 11 examines some of the important determinants of seller concentra-
tion, and identifies patterns and trends in the data on seller concentration across 
regions and countries, and over time. Why do some industries tend to become 
more highly concentrated than others? What factors cause seller concentration 
to vary over time?
Section 11.2 identifies the principal theoretical determinants of seller concen-
tration, and the role that these factors play in influencing the historical evolution 
of industry structure. Relevant factors include economies of scale, entry and 
exit barriers, regulation, the scope for discretionary sunk cost investment on 
items such as advertising and research and development, the stage reached in the 
industry’s life cycle, and the firm’s distinctive capabilities and core competences.
Section 11.3 describes an alternative approach towards explaining the evolu-
tion of industry structure, based on the notion that the growth of individual firms 
is inherently unpredictable. According to the random growth hypothesis, there 
is a natural tendency for concentration to increase gradually over the long term, 
even if the growth patterns of individual firms are completely random.
Finally, Section 11.4 presents some facts and figures concerning patterns and 
trends in seller concentration in the UK and EU. Patterns of specialization and 
geographic concentration, reflected in spatial patterns of firm and industry loca-
tion within the EU, are also considered.
	
11.2	
Seller concentration: systematic determinants
This section examines the main systematic determinants of seller concentration. 
These factors include economies of scale, entry and exit barriers, regulation, the 
scope for discretionary sunk cost expenditure on items such as advertising and 
research and development, the stage reached in the industry’s life cycle, and the 
firm’s distinctive capabilities and core competences.
Economies of scale
The structure of costs may have important implications for industry structure 
and the behaviour of firms. Economies of scale result from savings in the long-
run average cost (LRAC) achieved as a firm operates at a larger scale. The output 
level at which the firm’s LRAC attains its minimum value is the firm’s minimum 
efficient scale (MES) of production. The comparison between the total output 
that would be produced if each incumbent firm operates at its MES, and the 
total demand for the industry’s product at the price required in order for at least 
normal profit to be earned, has important implications for the number of firms 
that the industry can accommodate. This in turn has implications for seller con-
centration and industry structure.
If the total demand for the product equals the MES, the most cost-efficient 
arrangement is for the industry to be serviced by a single firm, and industry 

288

structure is most likely to be monopolistic. If the total demand for the product 
is 1,000 times as large as the MES, then the industry can accommodate 1,000 
firms all producing at the MES, and the industry structure might approximate 
perfect competition. However, if average costs are approximately constant over 
a range of output levels beyond the MES, the actual number of firms might be 
less than the number that could be accommodated if all were operating at (but 
not beyond) the MES.
Barriers to entry
Microeconomic theory views entry (and exit) as an important driver in the pro-
cess by which markets adjust towards equilibrium. The more dynamic Schum-
peterian and Austrian schools emphasise the innovative role of entry in driving 
industry evolution. There is plentiful empirical evidence to show that entry is 
higher in profitable or fast-growing industries (Baldwin and Gorecki, 1987; 
Geroski, 1991a,b), and exit is higher from low-profit industries (Dunne et al., 
1988). Other things being equal, entry is likely to reduce concentration, assuming 
the average size of entrants is smaller than that of incumbent firms. However, 
the effect could be the opposite if entry takes place on a large scale, perhaps as 
a result of a diversification strategy on the part of a large established firm from 
some other industry or geographic area. Meanwhile, by reducing the numbers of 
incumbent firms, exit is likely to increase concentration. In practice, entry and 
exit rates themselves tend to be correlated (Caves, 1998). For example, Dunne 
et al. (1988) report evidence of a negative relationship between annual entry and 
exit rates for US manufacturing industries over the period 1963–82. Barriers to 
entry are examined in detail in Chapter 12.
Scope for discretionary, sunk cost expenditures
Sutton (1991, 1998) examines the implications of a long-run increase in market 
size for the market shares of individual firms and for seller concentration. Sutton 
identifies two basic industry types, classified according to the nature of their sunk 
costs. In a Type 1 industry, also known as an exogenous sunk cost industry, each 
firm incurs a fixed sunk cost in order to enter the industry. This expenditure might 
include the cost of establishing a plant, or the cost of achieving some threshold 
level of advertising expenditure. Sunk costs are exogenous in the sense that the 
firm has limited discretion in choosing the levels of such expenditures. There 
are no other entry barriers. In a Type 2 industry, also known as an endogenous 
sunk cost industry, the amount of sunk cost expenditure allocated to items such 
as advertising and research and development is discretionary. Some sunk cost 
expenditure may be required in order to enter, but further substantial sunk cost 
expenditures are incurred subsequently, as incumbents compete to maintain or 
increase their own market shares. Advertising and research and development are 
important vehicles for discretionary sunk cost investment in Type 2 industries.
The following summary of Sutton’s argument draws on Bagwell’s (2007) survey. 
Consider first a Type 1 industry with a homogeneous product. For any given level 
of total industry sales, the profit earned by each individual firm is assumed to be

289
inversely related to N, the number of firms, and influenced by u, an industry-level 
parameter reflecting the intensity of price competition. The polar cases for u are: 
joint profit maximization, in which the firms operate a cartel, setting their prices as 
if they were a single monopolist; and Bertrand competition, in which price is driven 
down to the perfectly competitive level. Costs comprise a variable component that 
is linear in output, and a fixed component s, the exogenous sunk cost.
In this model, N adjusts so that each firm earns only a normal profit in the 
long run. The equilibrium condition can be written S * p(N, u) = s, where S 
denotes total consumer expenditure in the market, and S * p(N, u) is each firm’s 
operating profit (revenue minus variable costs). Each firm must earn sufficient 
operating profit to cover its fixed costs. This analysis has two implications. First, 
for any given N, an increase in S increases S * p(N, u), enabling each incum-
bent firm to earn an abnormal profit. This tends to encourage entry. Therefore 
an increase in S leads to an increase in N. As S increases, seller concentration, 
measured by 1/N, tends towards zero. Therefore there is a tendency towards the 
fragmentation of industry structure as the size of the market increases.
The second implication follows from the assumption that p(N, u) is depen-
dent on u. This implies a relationship between u and the equilibrium value of 
N. With joint profit maximization, the operating profit per unit of output is at 
its maximum. Many firms can earn a normal profit, so N is large and industry 
concentration is relatively low. With Bertrand competition, the operating profit 
per unit of output is at its minimum. Fewer firms can earn a normal profit, so N 
is small and concentration is high. Within any Type 1 industry, the performance 
of all firms is similar, but when comparisons are drawn between firms in differ-
ent Type 1 industries, variations in the industry-level parameter u are the main 
drivers of differences in firm performance.
Then consider a Type 2 industry with vertical product differentiation. This 
means the products of different producers are differentiated by product qual-
ity: some producers concentrate on the high-quality end of the product range, 
while others produce lower-quality lines for a mass market. Each firm’s product 
is defined by a vertical attribute u, which reflects product quality. Suppose by 
advertising, each firm can increase consumers’ perceptions of u. In a Type 2 
industry, the tendency towards fragmentation as the market expands is offset by 
a competitive escalation in advertising expenditures. By advertising sufficiently 
heavily relative to its competitors, a firm can always induce a certain propor-
tion of consumers to buy its product at a price that exceeds its variable cost. 
Therefore, as the market expands, at some point a firm that deviates from the 
established equilibrium by incurring an increased advertising outlay can earn 
sufficient operating profit to cover its (increased) sunk costs. At that point, it 
becomes profitable for a firm to deviate, resulting in the creation of a new equi-
librium. Each time there is an escalation in sunk cost expenditure, the deviating 
firm’s market share attains at least some minimum value (which does not change 
over time). Therefore concentration does not tend towards zero, and industry 
structure does not fragment, as the size of the market increases. Over time, the 
industry’s member firms become increasingly dispersed in size, with each firm’s 
relative position dependent on its historical record of achievement in ratcheting 
up its sunk cost expenditures.

|	 11    ■    Determinants of seller concentration
Several attempts have been made to classify Type 1 and Type 2 industries. 
Type 1 industries include household textiles, leather products, footwear, cloth-
ing, printing and publishing. Type 2 industries include motor vehicles, tobacco, 
soaps and detergents, pharmaceuticals and man-made fibres (Bresnahan, 1992; 
Schmalensee, 1992; Davies and Lyons, 1996; Lyons et al., 1997). Lyons et al. 
(1997), Robinson and Chiang (1996) and Dick (2007) test Sutton’s hypothesis 
empirically, and report some supporting evidence. The European Commission 
(1997b) examines the evolution of concentration in 71 industries between 1987 
and 1993. Average concentration was found to be significantly higher in Type 2 
than in Type 1 industries, in accordance with Sutton’s hypotheses.
Regulation
Government policy can also influence levels of concentration. Competition pol-
icy and regulation are primarily aimed at correcting market failure, increasing 
competition and giving consumers a wider choice of products and services. Poli-
cies aimed at increasing competition by discouraging restrictive practices or dis-
allowing mergers on grounds of public interest tend to reduce concentration, or 
at least prevent concentration from increasing. Conversely, policies that restrict 
the number of firms permitted to operate in certain industries, or grant exclusive 
property rights to selected firms, tend to increase concentration. Competition 
policy and the regulation of industry are examined in Chapter 24.
The industry life cycle
The stage that has been reached in the industry life cycle may have implica-
tions for seller concentration (Dosi et al., 1997; Klepper, 1997; McGahan, 2000). 
­Figure 11.1 illustrates the four stages of a typical industry life cycle: the introduc-
tion, growth, maturity and decline stages. Case Study 11.1 provides an applica-
tion to the credit union sector.

Case study 11.1
Industry life cycle for the credit union sector
Credit unions are cooperative, member owned, not-for-profit financial institutions, which 
are based on the underlying principle of self-help. Credit unions offer loans to their mem-
bers out of a pool of savings that is built up by the members themselves. Credit unions are 
constituted according to provisions set out in their common bond statutes, which define 
(and restrict) their target membership. Consequently, credit unions in different categories 
may exhibit differences in the membership characteristics, operational structure and the 
subsidies that are available. Common bond categories include the following: community; 
associational; educational; military; federal, state and local government; manufacturing; 
service; and low income.
The interwoven relationship that exists between a credit union’s members, who are 
the customers for its financial products, the suppliers of its funds, and in some cases its 
managers and shareholders, has led to credit unions being described by Croteau (1963) as 
the purest form of cooperative institution. In many countries, credit unions are viewed as 
playing a crucial role in tackling financial exclusion by providing low-cost financial ser-
vices to groups often excluded from obtaining credit from banks, or access to other bank-
ing services. It is estimated that more than 177 million people in 92 countries belong to a 
credit union. The total assets of credit unions worldwide are estimated at US $1,181bn. 
However, the pace of development of the credit union movement differs widely between 
different countries. Ferguson and McKillop (1997) detail four discrete stages in the devel-
opment of a credit union sector:
■ Nascent stage.  In this stage, credit unions are run by volunteer workers, and receive 
financial aid and other forms of assistance from local government agencies and chari-
table organizations. This model still characterises the relatively underdeveloped credit 
union sector in many African and Asian countries.
■ Transition stage.  Once a particular critical mass has been achieved, the industry moves 
into the second, transition stage of development. At this stage, the objectives of saving 
costs by achieving economies of scale are largely forgone in favour of maintaining small-
ness as a defining credit union attribute. However, in the transition stage credit unions 
tend to hire paid employees (full-time or part-time) rather than rely solely on volunteers. 
They have professional management, but retain volunteer directors. They may offer 
a range of financial services, rather than just one or two basic products. Membership 
becomes more socially diverse, including some middle-class income earners. This model 
characterises the credit union sector in the UK, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.
■ Mature stage.  At the mature stage, a more business-like philosophy tends to prevail. 
Mature credit union sectors are characterised by much larger asset and member-
ship sizes. Concentration within the sector tends to increase as dominant institutions 
begin to emerge. This trend is strengthened by means of consolidation in the form of 
horizontal mergers between some individual institutions. Professional staff operate 

292	
|	 11    ■    Determinants of seller concentration
multi-product services, and state-of-the-art information technology is employed in 
marketing and administration. Mature credit union sectors include those in Ireland, 
Canada and Australia.
■ Post-mature stage.  During the post-mature stage, the distinctiveness of the credit 
union movement tends to be eroded or lost, as the largest and most successful institu-
tions become increasingly similar to market-oriented financial services competitors. In 
the US, a small number of credit unions have recently been converted into banks.
While the industry life cycle approach is a useful tool to analyse the development of the 
credit union sector, there are some limitations:
■ Not all credit union sectors pass through the four stages identified above. Changes in 
general economic conditions or technology might significantly influence the develop-
ment of a particular credit union sector.
■ The importance of strategic decisions taken by the managers of individual credit unions 
may influence the path taken by a credit union sector. As a sector reaches maturity, 
credit unions are unlikely to remain passive spectators while the demand for their prod-
ucts and services stagnates or declines. Instead, they may decide to invest in financial 
innovation, or diversify into new product or geographic areas, or acquire others.
■ A credit union sector might comprise several distinct strategic groups (see ­Section 13.3). 
These may reach each stage in the life cycle at different times. In the case of credit unions, 
the common bond may be an important determinant of strategic group formation.
During the introduction phase, firms invest heavily in research and develop-
ment in order to develop a completely new product. The firms that are initially 
successful in bringing the product to market benefit from a first-mover advan-
tage. Although they are able to charge high prices, sales volumes may be rela-
tively small, and there is no guarantee that revenues will be sufficient to recoup 
the initial research and development expenditures. Competing producers may 
offer similar products with incompatible technological specifications. At this 
stage, there may be lack of awareness or confusion on the part of consumers as 
to the usefulness of the product. Seller concentration is likely to be relatively low.
During the growth phase, a particular technological specification becomes 
established as the industry standard. The market starts to expand and, by pro-
ducing at higher volumes, successful producers whose brands become established 
start to realise cost savings through economies of scale. Prices fall rapidly, stimu-
lating further growth in consumer demand. Success may also attract entry, with 
new firms seeking to imitate the successful specification, perhaps by introducing 
brands embodying only minor or superficial variations in product characteris-
tics. The consequent increase in industry supply and competition places further 
downward pressure on prices. However, because consumer demand is expanding 
rapidly, incumbent firms can tolerate the presence of entrants, and seller concen-
tration remains relatively low.

	
	
	
11.2  Seller concentration: systematic determinants	 |	
293
During the maturity phase, growth of sales and profitability level off as 
consumer demand for the industry’s product approaches the saturation level. 
Opportunities for additional growth in demand, through further price-cutting or 
further introduction of minor variations in product characteristics, are eventu-
ally exhausted. Incumbent firms may respond more defensively to threatened or 
actual competition from entrants by seeking to raise entry barriers, perhaps by 
undertaking large-scale advertising campaigns or through brand proliferation. 
Merger and takeover is likely to be the principal means by which incumbents 
can achieve further economies of scale or further growth. At this stage, seller 
concentration increases to levels higher than those seen during the introduction 
and growth stages, as production at high volume becomes essential if firms are 
to maintain acceptable levels of profitability.
Finally, during the decline stage, the sales and profits of incumbent firms 
begin to fall. Collusion or mergers between incumbent firms may well take place, 
primarily for defensive purposes: to eliminate competition and strengthen the 
parties’ market power, thereby providing some compensation for the decline 
in consumer demand. Some firms may decide to withdraw from the industry 
altogether, perhaps having identified new opportunities in alternative markets. 
Incumbents that are unable to implement effective defensive strategies may be 
faced with a loss of investor confidence, a falling share price and eventual bank-
ruptcy. With the market only capable of sustaining a declining number of pro-
ducers, seller concentration remains relatively high.
Stigler (1951) examines the interaction between the industry life cycle and the 
extent of vertical integration, and considers the implications for concentration in 
vertically linked industries. Before the market has achieved sufficient volume to 
sustain specialist suppliers of raw materials and specialist distribution channels, 
producers may seek to ensure their own input supplies and provide their own sales 
service, through backward and forward integration. Accordingly, concentration in 
the supply of raw materials and in distribution may be relatively high during the 
introduction stage. As the market starts to expand, however, specialist suppliers of 
raw materials and specialist distribution services begin to appear, and concentration 
in these adjacent sectors tends to decline. In the later maturity and decline stages of 
the industry life cycle, vertical integration may form part of the incumbents’ defen-
sive strategies. Accordingly, concentration in the raw materials and distribution 
sectors may tend to revert back towards higher levels. Klimenko (2004) elaborates 
on the nature of vertical integration towards the end of the industry life cycle:
[A]t mature stages of industry evolution, firms rarely introduce new 
products and most of the time routinely produce standardized goods and 
services. The existence of stable interface standards between segments 
of the industry’s value chain implies that upstream firms can mass-
produce intermediate products to satisfy standardized downstream 
demands instead of customizing them to individual specification of 
downstream firms. At the same time, the downstream firms are able to 
pick standardized inputs ‘off the shelf’ without worrying how well they fit 
in the assembly of the final product.
(Klimenko, 2004, p. 178)

294	
|	 11    ■    Determinants of seller concentration
The mobile phone industry provides a recent example. At the birth of the 
industry, mobile phone manufacturers were required to have expertise in 
designing radio chips, batteries, software, the assembly of electronic compo-
nents, and the design of cases. Incumbent firms such as Nokia, Motorola and 
Ericsson integrated vertically in order to produce base stations to provide 
mobile phone coverage. However, as the industry has evolved and matured, 
specialist producers have entered the market, producing radio chips, soft-
ware and handsets. Consequently, a process of vertical disintegration is taking 
place as incumbent firms outsource the manufacturing of component parts 
(The Economist, 2004a).
Distinctive capabilities and core competences
According to Kay (1993), the performance of firms depends on distinctive capa-
bilities. Distinctive capabilities include architecture, innovation and reputation. 
Architecture refers to the firm’s internal organization, its relationships with sup-
pliers, distributors and retailers, and its specialised industry knowledge, all of 
which may allow the firm opportunities to maintain a competitive edge over 
rivals or entrants. Innovation, combined with mechanisms to protect intellec-
tual property, provides some firms with assets that can be used to maintain 
high levels of performance. A firm that has established a name, and reputation 
of brand associated with high quality and service, may also enjoy a decisive 
advantage over competitors. Accordingly, firms that can draw on distinctive 
capabilities may be able to grow and sustain a large or dominant market share 
over long periods.
In the terminology of Prahalad and Hamel (1990), a firm’s core competences 
are the key to its performance. Core competences derive from the firm’s special-
ised knowledge and the ways in which this knowledge is used to establish and 
maintain an edge over competitors. The key to staying ahead of the competition 
is being able to protect the firm’s specialised resources and competences from 
imitation. Especially in industries where technological change occurs at a rapid 
pace, incumbent firms must be capable of adapting quickly and initiating change 
themselves. Only firms with sufficient ambition (‘strategic intent’) and sufficient 
flexibility or adaptability (‘strategic stretch’) are likely to succeed (Hamel and 
Prahalad, 1994).
This approach emphasises the firm itself, rather than industry characteris-
tics, as the ultimate source of a competitive advantage that may eventually have 
major ramifications for industry structure indicators such as seller concentration 
or barriers to entry. Singh et al. (1998) attempt to identify the types of strategy 
that were most frequently used by UK firms in the food, electrical engineer-
ing, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Questionnaire data obtained from 
marketing executives suggest that research and development and advertising are 
among the most common instruments employed with long-term strategic objec-
tives in view. There was little indication of reliance on price-based strategies or 
the patenting of new products.

11.3	
The random growth hypothesis
Section 11.2 emphasises the importance of a number of systematic factors in 
determining the structure of an industry. All of these explanations assume 
that the observable characteristics of an industry or its incumbent firms are 
the ultimate source of the competitive advantages that will determine the per-
formance of the industry’s most successful firms. In turn, the most successful 
firms’ performance has major implications for the number and size distribu-
tion of firms the industry is ultimately capable of sustaining. In Section 11.2, 
the emphasis on observable characteristics of the industry and its constituent 
firms is crucial.
An alternative school of thought within industrial organization emphasises 
the role of chance or random factors in determining the growth of individual 
firms and their eventual size distribution (Cabral and Mata, 2003). According 
to the random growth hypothesis, individual firms’ growth over any period is 
essentially random, as if determined by means of a draw in a lottery. Some firms 
do well and some do badly, but the distribution of strong and weak growth 
performance between firms is essentially a matter of chance. Furthermore, past 
growth is no reliable indicator of the rate at which a firm will grow or decline in 
the future. The growth of individual firms cannot be foreseen, any more than the 
winners of next Saturday’s lottery can be predicted from the characteristics of 
last week’s winners and losers, the strategies they employed when selecting their 
numbers, or their past records of success or failure.
It is important to note that the random growth hypothesis does not rule out 
the possibility that ex post (with the benefit of hindsight), strong growth per-
formance can be attributed to ‘systematic’ factors such as managerial talent, 
successful innovation, efficient organizational structure or favourable shifts in 
consumer demand. Rather, it implies that growth originating from these factors 
cannot be predicted ex ante (before the event). ‘Systematic’ factors of this kind 
may determine growth, but these factors are themselves distributed randomly 
across firms. As before, their effects cannot be foreseen or predicted in advance 
using data on the firms’ observable characteristics.
If successful growth performance is essentially a matter of luck or chance, 
is the tendency to hero-worship successful entrepreneurs (Bill Gates, Mark 
­Zuckerberg) in certain quarters of society (some sections of the business press, 
for example) fundamentally misconceived? In support of this view, Schwed’s 
(1955) analogy of the ‘great coin flipping contest’ is worth quoting at length:
The referee gives a signal for the first time and 400,000 coins flash in the 
sun as they are tossed. The scorers make their tabulations, and discover 
that 200,000 people are winners and 200,000 are losers. Then the second 
game is played. Of the original 200,000 winners, about half of them win 
again. The third game is played, and of the 100,000 who have won both 
games half of them are again successful. These 50,000, in the fourth 
game are reduced to 25,000, and in the fifth to 12,500. These 12,500

have now won five straight without loss and are no doubt beginning to 
fancy themselves as coin flippers. They feel they have an ‘instinct’ for it. 
However, in the sixth game, 6,250 are disappointed and amazed they have 
finally lost, and perhaps some of them start a Congressional investigation. 
But the victorious 6,250 play on and are successively reduced in number 
until less than a thousand are left. This little band have won nine straight 
without a loss, and by this time most of them have at least a local 
reputation for their ability. People come from some distance to consult 
them about their method of calling heads and tails, and they modestly give 
explanations of how they have achieved their success. Eventually there 
are about a dozen men who have won every single time for about fifteen 
games. These are regarded as the experts, the greatest coin flippers in 
history, the men who never lose, and they have their biographies written.
(Schwed, 1955, pp. 160–1, quoted in Sherman, 1977, p. 9)
Kay (2004) makes a similar observation:
When you buy a lottery ticket, you make a mistake – you almost 
certainly should not bet at such poor odds. But if the winning ticket 
is yours, chance redeems your mistake. When people succeed in risky 
situations, the outcome is a mixture of good judgment and good luck, 
and it is impossible to disentangle the elements of the two. This is of 
central importance to considering successful businesses and successful 
business people. To what extent were Henry Ford, William Morris and 
Bill Gates people who had the judgment to choose the right number, or 
lucky people whose number came up?
(Kay, 2004, p. 402)
What are the implications of random growth for the long-run trend in seller 
concentration? The fact that the growth or decline of individual firms cannot be 
predicted using data on the firms’ observable characteristics does not imply the 
trend in seller concentration is also purely a matter of chance. Proponents of the 
random growth hypothesis have developed simulation models to show that there 
is a natural tendency for industry structure to become increasingly concentrated 
over time, even if the growth of the industry’s individual member firms is random. 
These models involve tracing the effects on seller concentration of the imposition 
of a sequence of random ‘growth shocks’ upon simulated (hypothetical) firm size 
data. This random growth hypothesis is embodied in the Law of Proportionate 
Effect (LPE). The LPE is also known as Gibrat’s law after the French statistician 
Gibrat (1931), who is credited with the first discussion on the implications of the 
random growth hypothesis for seller concentration (Mata, 2008).
A simple and highly stylized illustration of the implications of a random 
growth process for the trend in seller concentration is shown in Table 11.1. Sup-
pose in year 1 an industry comprises eight equal-sized firms, each with sales 
of 100. The assumed random growth process is as follows: in any subsequent 
year, each firm has an equal chance of either doubling or halving its sales. For

simplicity, it is assumed that no other outcome is possible. It is important to 
emphasise that this is only one of many possible ways in which a random growth 
process could be specified. A more realistic formulation might select the individ-
ual firm’s growth rates randomly from some continuous range of values, rather 
than allowing only two (extreme) outcomes. However, the binary formulation 
keeps the arithmetic as simple as possible.
In Table 11.1 it is assumed that, every year, half of the firms in each size cat-
egory grow and the other half decline. Therefore, four of the eight equal-sized 
firms in year 1 double in size in year 2, and four halve in size. From each group 
of four equal-sized firms in year 2, two double in size and two halve in size in year 
3, and so on. The CR3 and HH seller concentration measures (see Section 11.4) 
are reported at the bottom of Table 11.1. These reflect a progressive increase 
in concentration, with the firm size distribution becoming increasingly skewed 
in successive years. By year 4, only one firm has experienced the good fortune 
of three consecutive years of positive growth. Accordingly, this firm (firm 1) 
achieves a market share of more than 50 per cent in year 4.
Hannah and Kay (1977) use a gambling analogy to illustrate the same point:
[I]f a group of rich men and a group of poor men visit Monte Carlo, it 
is likely that some of the rich will become poor and some of the poor 
become rich: but it is also probable that some of the rich will get richer 
and some of the poor will get poorer, so that the extent of inequality 
within each group and over the two groups taken together is likely to 
increase. The process works to increase industrial concentration in much 
the same way.
(Hannah and Kay, 1977, p. 103)
Therefore if firms’ growth rates are determined randomly, the firm size distri-
bution tends to become skewed, with the industry comprising a few very large 
firms and a much larger number of smaller firms. This pattern is illustrated in 
Figure 11.2. Furthermore, the degree of skewness tends to increase progressively 
over time.

The long-run implications of the random growth hypothesis for seller concen-
tration have been analysed using more realistic and less highly stylized simulation 
models. For example, Scherer (1980) traces the evolution of a firm size distribu-
tion for a hypothetical industry initially comprising 50 equal-sized firms. Each 
firm’s growth rate in each year was drawn from a normal probability distribu-
tion, whose parameters (mean and variance) were calibrated using data on a 
sample of 369 of the 500 largest US firms over the period 1954–60. The evolution 
of industry structure over a 140-year time period was simulated 16 times, and 
the average four-firm concentration ratio calculated. The results showed that the 
concentration ratio increased from 8 per cent in period 1 to approximately 58 
per cent in period 140. McCloughan (1995) develops a more elaborate stochastic 
growth model that also incorporates entry and exit.
Table 11.2 reports the average results across 20 replications of a simulation 
over 50 time periods of an industry comprising 20 firms. The firms are equal-
sized (each with a size value of 1 unit) at period 0. In each subsequent period, 
their logarithmic growth rate is drawn randomly from a normal distribution with 
zero mean and a standard deviation of 0.1. Over 50 periods, the average market 
share of the largest firm increases from 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent, and the aver-
age market share of the top five firms increases from 25 per cent to 49 per cent. 
Table 11.2 also shows the corresponding adjustments in the HH index and the 
numbers equivalent of the HH index.
Some of the earliest empirical research on the random growth hypothesis 
examines whether the actual size distribution of firms is consistent with the size 
distribution that would be expected if firm growth is truly random. Quandt 
(1966), Silberman (1967), Clarke (1979), Stanley et al. (1995) and Growiec et al. 
(2008) all report tests which assess how accurately certain theoretically skewed 
statistical probability distributions describe observed firm size distributions. 
Although these studies are unable to identify any specific theoretical distribution 
that always provides the best description of reality, the tendency for observed 
firm size distributions to be highly skewed, and therefore amenable to representa-
tion using these types of distribution, is almost universal.
An alternative approach to testing the LPE is based on the idea that if growth 
is random, there should be no relationship between the size of a firm at the start

of any period and its growth over that period. In other words, firm size should 
have no predictive capability for future growth. Furthermore, past growth should 
also have no predictive capability for future growth. Regression analysis can be 
used to test for these non-relationships. A typical specification is as follows:
(xi,t+T - xi,t) = a + b1xi,t + b2(xi,t - xi,t-T) + ui
where xi,t represents the natural logarithm of the size of firm i in year t. Growth is 
observed over the T-year period between years t and t + T, and (xi,t+T - xi,t) rep-
resents firm i’s logarithmic growth rate over this period. Similarly (xi,t - xi,t-T) 
represents firm i’s logarithmic growth over the previous T-year period between 
years t - T and t. The disturbance term ui represents the random component 
of firm i’s growth for the period t to t + T. According to the random growth 
hypothesis, the regression coefficients b1 and b2 should both be zero. b1 = 0 
implies there is no relationship between firm size in year t and growth over the 
period t to t + T; and b2 = 0 implies there is no relationship between growth 
over the period t - T to t, and growth over the period t to t + T. Using firm 
size data for a sample of firms observed at points t - T, t and t + T, the model 
can be estimated as a cross-sectional regression. The hypotheses b1 = 0 and 
b2 = 0 can be tested to determine whether the data support the random growth 
hypothesis.
In the event that the random growth hypothesis is not supported by the data, 
two of the most likely alternatives are as follows:
■ If b1 6 0, there is a negative relationship between initial size and subsequent 
growth. In other words, b1 6 0 implies the smaller firms tend to grow faster 
than the larger firms. Over the long run, there is a tendency for convergence in 

300

firm sizes. In this case, there would be some eventual limit to the tendency for 
concentration to increase over time. Accordingly, the long-run implications for 
the trend in seller concentration of b1 6 0 are very different from the implica-
tions of b1 = 0.
■ If b2 7 0, there is a positive relationship between growth in consecutive T-year 
periods. In other words, a firm that grew relatively fast over the period t - T 
to t is likely to do so again over the period t to t + T. Such a pattern could 
reflect distinctive capabilities on the part of the firm, enabling it to deliver 
above-average growth consistently. In this case, the tendency for concentra-
tion to increase over time would be strengthened relative to the case in which 
growth is completely random.
Empirical research that tests the LPE has produced mixed results. Several 
early studies, based on data up to and including the 1970s, report either no rela-
tionship or a positive relationship between firm size and growth. A number of 
more recent studies find a consistent tendency for small firms to grow faster than 
large firms. As we have seen, a growth pattern that is in accordance with the LPE 
(b1 = 0)  implies seller concentration tends to increase over time. A tendency 
for small firms to grow faster than large firms (b1 6 0)  implies no long-term 
increase in seller concentration. Broadly speaking, the results of the empirical 
literature are consistent with what is known about trends in seller concentration 
(see Section 11.4). Until the 1970s, concentration tended to increase consistently, 
but since the 1970s there has been no consistent trend.
Table 11.3 summarises a number of empirical studies of the LPE. This sec-
tion concludes with some comments on the general features of this literature. As 
noted above, much of the recent LPE literature reports a tendency for small firms 
or plants to grow faster than their larger counterparts (Evans, 1987a,b; Dunne 
and Hughes, 1994; Hart and Oulton, 1996, 1999; Blonigen and Tomlin, 2001). 
While this might reflect genuine growth patterns, it has also been suggested that 
a negative size–growth relationship might, at least in part, be an artefact of the 
way in which many empirical tests are constructed. Specifically, their reliance on 
data for firms that survived over the sample period raises the possibility that a 
type of sample selection bias or survivorship bias might be responsible for a nega-
tive reported size–growth relationship. Some of the earliest literature recognised 
that the validity of the LPE might be limited to firms operating above a certain 
size threshold, or minimum efficient scale (MES) (Simon and Bonini, 1958). 
The long-term survival of small firms depends upon their ability to achieve at 
least the MES, so that they can realise the full benefits of economies of scale. 
For example, constraints on access to external finance may create difficulties for 
small firms in achieving the MES (Beck et al., 2005). Firms that fail to achieve 
the MES reasonably quickly are likely to exit. Therefore an empirical study 
based on a sample of firms that were in existence both at the start and at the end 
of a certain period might observe rapid average growth at the lower end of the 
firm size distribution. However, this observation does not imply that all small 
firms achieve rapid growth. Rather, the study is subject to a form of survivor-
ship bias, because growth data are observed and recorded only for those firms 
that survived from the start to the end of the observation period. Data for those

small firms that failed to achieve rapid growth and exited would not have been 
recorded.
In most instances, empirical tests of the LPE are based on a cross-sectional 
regression of logarithmic growth rates over a given period on initial log sizes. 
However, Gibrat’s original formulation and many subsequent interpretations of 
the LPE emphasise the implications for trends in the size distribution of firms 
and seller concentration over the long run. In view of recent improvements in 
the time coverage of firm-level databases, and advances in econometric methods 
for analysing time-series datasets and panel datasets (containing both a cross-
sectional dimension and a time dimension), it is unsurprising that empirical tests 
of the LPE based on time-series or panel models, rather than on cross-sectional 
regression, have recently started to appear. For example, Goddard et al. (2002a) 
test the validity of the LPE for a Japanese manufacturing sample with 15 years 
of annual size and growth data for more than 300 firms. Some evidence of a 
negative size–growth relationship is reported. For the majority of the 147 large, 
quoted UK firms in Geroski et al.’s (2003) 30-year study, there is little or no 
evidence of any relationship between size and growth. Accordingly, the study 
comes down strongly in favour of the random growth hypothesis.
Our results suggest that the growth rates of firms who survive long 
enough to record 30 years of history are random. . . . Among other 
things, this means that there is no obvious upper bound on levels of 
concentration in individual industries or across the economy as a whole. 
A metaphor for convergence might tell a story of ships all reaching 
the same harbour despite coming from different directions. In fact, the 
metaphor that describes our data is ships passing in the night.
(Geroski et al., 2003, p. 55)
Several researchers develop models in which growth is part-random, but partly 
influenced by systematic factors. For example, Davies and Lyons (1982) include 
firm numbers, economies of scale and barriers to entry among the systematic 
determinants of growth. Small firms need to grow rapidly to achieve the MES. 
The systematic influences are most important in determining growth, and (implic-
itly) concentration, up to the point at which economies of scale are exhausted. 
Once the MES has been attained, however, growth is mainly random. Geroski 
and Mazzucato (2001) examine the extent to which corporate learning (which 
can be either systematic, arising from technological innovation and spillovers, 
internal resources and learning economies of scale; or random) is evident in the 
growth patterns of large US car manufacturers over an 85-year period. There 
is only limited evidence of any systematic learning effect on observed growth. 
Learning effects appear to be mainly random.
Davies and Geroski (1997) apply a variant of the random growth model to 
firm-level market share data on 200 large UK firms within 54 manufacturing 
industries. The empirical model is as follows:
∆MSi,j = aj + bjMSi,j + g1x1,i + g2x2,i + c + gkxk,i + ui,j

304	
|	 11    ■    Determinants of seller concentration
MSi,j represents the market share of firm i in industry j at the start of the obser-
vation period, and ∆MSi,j the change in firm i’s market share in industry j over 
the course of the observation period. ui,j is a disturbance term that incorporates 
the random element in variations in the firms’ market shares. The regression 
coefficients aj and bj play a similar role in this model to their counterparts in 
the random growth model (as specified previously in this section). However, the 
j-subscripts indicate that the values of these coefficients are permitted to vary 
between industries. Davies and Geroski use a number of industry characteristics 
to model the variation in aj and bj. These include estimates of the MES, growth 
in industry sales, the advertising-to-sales ratio, the research and development 
expenditure-to-sales ratio and the initial level of concentration. The additional 
covariates x1,i, x2,i, c , xk,i represent a number of firm-specific determinants of 
growth. g1,g2, c , gk are the regression coefficients on these covariates. Indica-
tors of expenditure on advertising and research and development that are specific 
to the firm itself and its nearest rivals are found to be significant determinants of 
changes in market share. The model suggests that relative stability in an indus-
try’s concentration ratios can conceal significant ‘turbulence’, or turnover, in the 
identities and rankings of the firms with the largest market shares.

Trends in concentration and the location of industry
Section 11.4 describes patterns and trends in seller concentration at the aggregate 
level and for particular industries, and examines influences on the geographical 
location of industry.
Trends in aggregate concentration
Hart and Prais (1956) examine trends in aggregate concentration for the UK (by 
examining the distribution of firm sizes of all quoted companies, measured by 
stock exchange valuation) for the period 1895–1950. Aggregate concentration 
increased throughout most of the pre-Second World War period up to 1939. 
Subsequently, aggregate concentration appears to have declined between 1940 
and 1950. Evely and Little (1960) report similar findings. Hannah and Kay (1977) 
examine trends in aggregate concentration (measured by the proportion of assets 
accounted for by the top 100 firms) between 1919 and 1969. Aggregate con-
centration appears to have increased over the period 1919–30, declined during 
1930–48, but then increased again during the 1950s and 1960s. Merger activity 
appears to have contributed significantly to the rise in concentration both during 
the 1920s, and during the 1950s and 1960s. The fall in concentration during the 
period 1930–48 is attributed to the faster growth of medium-sized firms, relative 
to their larger counterparts.
Large-scale mergers and an improvement in the competitiveness of large man-
ufacturing firms appear to have contributed to a further increase in aggregate 
concentration in the UK during the 1970s (Hart and Clarke, 1980; Clarke, 1985). 
During the 1980s, however, the long-term trend was reversed, and aggregate con-
centration began to decrease (Clarke, 1993). At the start of the 1980s, the UK’s

manufacturing sector was subjected to an unprecedented squeeze from a com-
bination of high interest rates and a high exchange rate. Faced with a sharp fall 
in demand in both the domestic market (as the UK economy became mired in 
recession) and in export markets (as the high exchange rate damaged competitive-
ness), many manufacturing firms were forced out of business altogether. Many of 
those that survived did so only by shedding labour and downsizing. This led to a 
reduction in average firm size, and a fall in aggregate concentration.
Davies et al. (2001) examine changes in aggregate concentration at the Euro-
pean level (measured by the aggregate market shares of the 100 largest Euro-
pean manufacturing firms) over the period 1987–93. Aggregate concentration 
fell slightly from 29.6 per cent to 28.6 per cent. While concentration remained 
relatively stable, there was a substantial turnover (entry and exit) among the top 
100 firms. Between 1987 and 1993 there were 22 exits from the top 100. In nine 
cases, this was caused by slow internal growth, bankruptcy or takeover by firms 
from outside the top 100. In four cases, it was caused by takeover by other top 
100 firms. In the remaining nine cases, it was caused by a relative decline in sales, 
resulting in these firms slipping from the top 100. Of the 22 entrants, two were 
created by divestment of assets by existing top 100 firms, and 13 achieved top 100 
status through relative sales growth. The remaining seven firms were classified 
as completely ‘new’ entrants.
Pryor (2001a,b, 2002) examines the trend in aggregate concentration in the 
US, over the period 1960–97. Aggregate concentration appears to have declined 
over the period 1962–85. However, this trend was reversed and aggregate con-
centration began to increase from the late 1980s onwards. Deconcentration dur-
ing the 1980s is attributed to factors such as an increase in import penetration, 
deregulation, stronger competition policy and technological change which tended 
to lower the MES. During the 1990s, phenomena such as globalization, improve-
ments in information technology and e-commerce appear to have pushed in the 
direction of further deconcentration. However, this tendency has been more than 
offset by an increase in merger activity, which caused aggregate concentration to 
increase during the 1990s.
Trends in industry concentration
Naturally, seller concentration varies considerably from industry to industry. 
Economists have often been most concerned with concentration in manufac-
turing, in which large-scale production techniques became prevalent during the 
1920s and 1930s (Chandler, 1990). For example, Shepherd (1972) reports that 
average four-digit, five-firm industry concentration ratios were lower for UK 
(52.1 per cent) than for US manufacturing (80.3 per cent) for the period 1958–83. 
This pattern is attributed to differences in technologies, more intense competition 
and a more rigorous competition policy regime in the UK. Table 11.4 shows CR5 
(five-firm concentration ratios) for selected UK industries in 2004, calculated on 
a total output basis and on a value-added basis.
All EU member countries experienced a pronounced shift in the distribution 
of economic activity away from manufacturing and towards services towards 
the end of the twentieth century. Over the period 1991–2004, GDP in services

(distribution, hotels and restaurants, transport, financial intermediation, prop-
erty and public administration) grew at an average rate of around 3 per cent per 
annum, while GDP in industry (mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electric-
ity, gas and water supply) grew at around 1.5 per cent per annum (European 
Commission, 2003a). By 2005, industry accounted for 18 per cent of GDP in 
the EU, services accounted for 71 per cent, agriculture accounted for 2 per cent

and utilities and construction accounted for 8 per cent. In all EU member coun-
tries, with the exception of Portugal, more than 80 per cent of the labour force 
was employed in services (European Commission, 2007a). Table 11.5 provides 
a snapshot of the industrial structure of the EU-27 countries as a whole in 2008, 
excluding the financial sector. 
A study by the European Commission (2000) compares patterns of specialisa-
tion in Europe, the US and Japan. While Europe tends to specialise in traditional 
industries such as building materials, tiles, footwear and textiles, Japan and the 
US specialise in technology-oriented industries such as electronic components 
and motor vehicles. Cockerill and Johnson (2003) suggest this is due to the higher 
absolute and relative expenditures on research and development in the US and 
Japan. For example, in 2001 private sector research and development expendi-
ture as a percentage of GDP was 1.28 per cent for the 15 states that were EU 
members at the time (the EU-15), 2.11 per cent for Japan, and 2.04 per cent for 
the US. Within Europe, Sweden and Finland had the highest percentages (2.84 
per cent and 2.68 per cent, respectively), and Portugal and Greece had the lowest 
(0.17 per cent and 0.19 per cent, respectively). The UK figure was 1.21 per cent 
(European Commission, 2003a).
According to the European Commission (2007), there is an inverse relation-
ship between country size and sectoral specialization. Large countries such as 
France, Germany, Italy and the UK tend to have a highly diversified sectoral 
distribution of economic activity, while small countries such as Malta, Luxem-
bourg and Finland tend to be more specialised. Table 11.7 presents, by member 
state, the most specialised activity within the non-financial business economy. 
Table 11.8 reports the EU-27 member countries with the largest and second-
largest absolute levels of value added for selected industrial sectors in 2010, and 
the countries in which each sector’s share in total economy-wide value added 
(excluding the financial sector) was the largest and the second largest.
Observed patterns of specialization and geographic concentration in European 
industry are rather complex, and often dependent on definitions and methods of 
measurement. Consequently, different studies have drawn different conclusions 
as to the existence or direction of any long-term trends in these patterns. Amiti 
(1997, 1998) examines changes in specialization and geographic concentration for 
27 European manufacturing industries over the period 1968–90. Specialization 
increased for Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy and the Netherlands, 
but decreased for France, Spain and the UK. A similar exercise for selected 
countries using a more disaggregated industry classification finds that Belgium, 
France, Germany, Italy and the UK all became more specialised. Geographic 
concentration increased in 17 out of 27 industries, predominantly those in which 
producers were heavily reliant on intermediate inputs from suppliers, and where 
there were significant economies of scale. Brulhart (1998) reports geographic 
concentration increased throughout Europe during the 1980s. However, Aigin-
ger and Davies (2000) report that while specialization in European manufactur-
ing increased during the period 1985–98, geographic concentration decreased. 
A number of smaller countries overcame historical disadvantages and increased 
their shares of production in specific industries.

11.4  Trends in concentration and the location of industry	 |	
311
The trend towards increasing seller concentration was repeated in many 
service sector industries towards the end of the twentieth century. Table 11.6 
summarises the size distribution of firms by industry classification across all 
EU member countries in 1997. Table 11.6 suggests there is considerable variation 
in patterns of concentration between industries, with the largest employers (firms 
of 250 employees or more) accounting for the largest shares of sales in motor 
manufacturing and financial services, and the smallest shares of sales in hotels 
and restaurants, construction and property.
The location of European industry
Specialization reflects whether a country’s production is composed mainly of 
a small number of products or services, or whether the country’s production is

total output is produced in a small number of countries or regions, or whether 
the industry is widely dispersed geographically (Aiginger, 1999).
Hallett (2000) measures specialization and geographic concentration in order 
to examine changes in the spatial distribution of 17 economic activities within 
Europe for the period 1980–95. Southern (peripheral) regions were more highly 
specialised than their northern counterparts. Specialization tended to increase in 
poorer regions, and in regions that underwent major change in industrial struc-
ture. Geographic concentration is captured using four measures:
■ The extent to which production is spatially dispersed.
■ The extent to which production is concentrated at the EU’s core or periphery.
■ The degree of ‘clustering’, reflected by the geographic distance between 
branches of similar activity.
■ The extent to which production is concentrated in high- or low-income regions.

Manufacturing industries with significant economies of scale tend to be geo-
graphically concentrated. Production in sectors such as agriculture, textiles and 
clothing takes place predominantly at the EU’s periphery, while sectors such as 
banking and financial services are concentrated at the centre. Production of a 
number of products, including ores and metals, chemicals and transport equip-
ment, is clustered around specific locations, perhaps due to historical links to 
raw material suppliers. Finally, labour-intensive sectors tend to be located in 
low-income regions, while capital-intensive or technology-oriented sectors are 
concentrated in the higher-income regions.
Clusters are groups of interdependent firms that are linked through close 
vertical or horizontal relationships, located within a well-defined geographic 
area (European Commission, 2002). Porter (1998a) provides a more detailed 
definition:
a geographically proximate group of inter-connected companies and 
associated institutions in a particular field, linked by commonalities and 
complementarities. The geographic scope of a cluster can range from 
a single entity or state to a country or even a group of neighbouring 
countries. Clusters take varying forms depending on their depth and 
sophistication, but most include end-product or service companies; 
suppliers of specialized inputs, components, machinery and services; 
financial institutions; and firms in related industries. Clusters also 
often involve a number of institutions, governmental and otherwise, 
that provide specialized training, education, information and technical 
support (such as universities, think tanks, vocational training providers); 
and standard setting agencies. Government departments and regulatory 
agencies that significantly influence a cluster can be considered part of 
it. Finally, many clusters include trade associations and other collective 
private sector bodies that support cluster members.
(Porter, 1998a, p. 254)
Some researchers use the term industrial district to refer to a production sys-
tem ‘characterised by a myriad of firms specialised in various stages of produc-
tion of a homogeneous product, often using flexible production technology and 
connected by local inter-firm linkages’ (Jacobson and Andréosso-O’Callaghan, 
1996, p. 116). For example, several well-known clusters or industrial districts 
are located in northern Italy and southern Germany. A tendency for many firm 
owners to originate from similar social backgrounds facilitates communication, 
and tends to blur the boundaries between individual firms and the communities 
in which they are based. This phenomenon has been documented in Italy, where 
there are several clusters or industrial districts comprising networks of small, 
specialised firms that are internationally competitive in the production of goods 
such as furniture, ceramic tiles and textiles (Markusen, 1996; Becattini et al., 
2003). Case Study 11.2 examines the importance of industrial clusters.
Clusters typically include distributors and retailers, suppliers, banks and 
firms producing related products and services. They can also include public or

Case study 11.2
Clusters flustered: Global competition seems  
to be weakening the benefits of being in a cluster
OPENED in 1845, the Cantoni cotton mill in Castellanza went on to become the coun-
try’s biggest but, burdened by debt, it closed in 1985. A large cluster of producers centred 
on the town, once called the Manchester of Italy, also perished. In Como, about 20 miles 
(32km) to the north-east, a cluster of silk firms is ailing, and so is a woollens cluster 
around Biella, 50 miles to the west, victims like Castellanza of low-cost competition.
Michael Porter, a guru on clusters at Harvard Business School, has said they help pro-
ductivity, boost innovation and encourage new firms. For Mr Porter, firms’ geographical 
proximity, their close competition with each other and the growth of specialised suppliers 
and production networks around them make a winning combination. Globalisation has, 
however, made this far less certain. More open trade and improved transport links may 
mean that bunching together in a cluster no longer offers such a strong defence against 
cheaper foreign rivals. Indeed, as Italy’s medium-sized industrial firms adapt to the threat 
from China, the benefit they get from being bunched together in a cluster seems to be 
weakening.
More than 100 such clusters speckle the boot of Italy: tiles in Sassuolo, food machinery 
in Parma, sofas in Matera, footwear in Fermo and clothing in Treviso, to name just some. 
A few owe their existence to local natural assets – marble is quarried in the mountains 
behind Carrara, for example. But mostly they are the result of skills built up over suc-
cessive generations. The packaging-machinery firms around Bologna grew out of the 
region’s tradition of precision engineering, and the area around Belluno, where the first 
ever spectacles factory was built in 1878, is still home to a cluster of eyewear makers.
San Maurizio d’Opaglio, midway between Castellanza and Biella, is the world’s larg-
est centre for working brass. Workers there once made bells; now the cluster has around 
380 firms that together employ about 10,000 people making valves and taps, businesses 
that took off with reconstruction after the second world war and the building boom that 
followed. About 19,000 are employed in small satellite firms involved in parts of the 
production process.
Founded in 1951, now employing 850 people who make brass valves, connectors and 
manifolds and turning over €165m ($218m) last year, Giacomini is a giant of the cluster. 
However, quality certification, precision production and a catalogue of 6,000 products 
will not safeguard its future. ‘Germans saw us in the 1950s and 1960s as we now see 
Chinese products – low quality, low cost. Long-term, brass fittings are not enough. We 
cannot expect to survive on these,’ admits Corrado Giacomini, the chairman. The firm 
began diversifying into electronic controls and heating and air conditioning systems ten 
years ago, and this move away from its traditional business means that its links to the 
cluster look increasingly less relevant to its future.
Zucchetti, a tapmaker in the nearby town of Gozzano, has also changed strategy. As 
well as being a maker of luxury baths and basins, it has shifted production upmarket, 

316	
|	 11    ■    Determinants of seller concentration
with smaller production runs and a larger product range. How Zucchetti performs in the 
future depends less on being in the cluster than designing smart products and defending 
its brand. A recent report from Intesa Sanpaolo, a bank, notes how competition is forcing 
firms to innovate, improve quality and build brands.
Firms in a jewellery cluster in Valenza, in southern Piedmont, hope to protect their 
businesses with help from the regional authorities, the creation of a group trade mark 
and peer pressure to keep skills in the cluster. Bruno Guarona, chairman of the jewel-
lers’ association, moans about unfair competition from China, where labour regulations 
are lax and firms enjoy tariffs and duties that undercut those his members face. But he 
reserves special bitterness for jewellers from Valenza who have moved production abroad, 
‘traitors who have committed a crime’.
Indeed, fragmentation of production and outsourcing abroad, clear signs that firms 
have become less competitive, weaken the networks on which clusters are built and may 
even destroy their competitive advantage, warns Rodolfo Helg, an economics professor at 
the university in Castellanza, which occupies the buildings that were once the town’s large 
cotton mill. He believes successful clusters in the future will be very different from those 
of the past. Britain’s large manufacturing clusters withered and died. The risk for Italy 
is that the decline of its clusters will prove as terminal elsewhere as it was in Castellanza.

semi-public bodies such as universities, voluntary organizations and trade asso-
ciations. Relationships are most effective if the firms are in close geographical 
proximity to one another, and if there is effective communication. Firms within 
a cluster do not always compete, but sometimes cooperate by serving different 
niches of the same industry. However, they face the same competitive threats 
and opportunities. Because clusters are made up of what often seem to be a col-
lection of disparate firms, standard industry classifications may not be useful in 
identifying them (Porter, 1998b). Instead, sophisticated algorithms are required 
which capture inter-industry linkages based on location patterns and input and 
output linkages (Delgado et al., 2016).
The European Commission (2002) surveys 34 clusters located in the EU-15 
plus Norway. The clusters are characterised as traditional (transactions are based 
on long-term market relationships; collaboration is between service suppliers 
and government bodies; innovation takes place through product development 
and distribution), and science-based (transactions are based on temporary and 
long-term relationships; collaboration is between research and development insti-
tutions and government bodies; innovation takes place through new product 
and process development, and new organizational forms). Table 11.9 reports the 
locations of some of these clusters.
Enright (1998) discusses the importance of clusters for firm-level strategic 
decision-making and performance. Many regions contain vital resources and

capabilities that can be exploited by individual firms to gain a competitive 
advantage. However, firm-level strategy and performance are affected by inter-
dependence, cooperation and competition between firms within the same cluster 
(Gilbert et al., 2008). Efficiency or productivity gains are realised if firms can 
access resources and inputs (skilled personnel, raw materials, access to customers, 
training facilities for staff) from elsewhere within the cluster, or take advantage 
of complementarities such as joint marketing and promotion, or accumulate 
specialised information and knowledge (Porter and Sovall, 1998). The formation 
of new firms may be encouraged and entry barriers kept low. If firms diversify 
within a cluster they not only take advantage of firm-specific economies of scope, 
but can also draw on the human capital or other resources that already exist 
elsewhere within the cluster. Clusters foster a sense of trust (or ‘social glue’) that 
helps bind participants together (Morosini, 2004). Delgado et al. (2014) present 
evidence to suggest that firms and industries located in a strong cluster have 
higher levels of employment and innovative activity.

Porter (1990) identifies clusters as key to the interactions between loca-
tion, competition and national competitiveness. The competitive environ-
ment influences the way in which firms use their endowments of resources to 
formulate their strategies, which in turn determine performance. Innovation 
and technological spillovers are crucial to the development of firms. Porter’s 
Diamond Model (1990) illustrates the determinants and dynamics of national 
competitive advantage. Competitive rivalry, factor and demand conditions, 
and the existence of related and supporting industries are the key determinants 
of the extent to which firms can develop and maintain a competitive advantage 
over rivals.
Porter’s Diamond is illustrated in Figure 11.3. Domestic competitive interac-
tion and rivalry stimulates firms to innovate and improve efficiency. For exam-
ple, the Japanese car manufacturing and consumer electronics industries were 
intensely competitive within Japan, before the most successful firms also became 
dominant players at the international level. Changes in demand conditions pro-
vide an important stimulus for innovation and quality improvement. German 
firms are the dominant producers of high-speed cars, partly because there are 
no speed limits on the autobahns. Belgian and Swiss chocolate makers service 
discerning, up-market customers. The varied preferences of consumers allow 
firms and industries to transfer locally accrued advantages to a global arena. Fac-
tor conditions comprise natural, human and capital resources, and the quality 
of the physical, administrative and technological infrastructures. Some of these 
resources are natural, but others, such as concentrations of specialised labour or 
capital, have developed in tandem with the historical growth of specific indus-
tries in particular locations. The quality and quantity of specialised high-quality 
inputs influence national competitiveness. Clusters of related and supporting 
industries, which engage in complementary or support activities, often strengthen 
successful industries. Examples of mutually supporting clusters include semi-
conductors, computers and software in the US, and chemicals, dyes, textiles and 
textile machinery in Germany.

Porter’s Diamond has stimulated academic and policymaker interest in 
regional clusters of small and medium-sized firms. A number of schools attempt 
to explain the emergence of clusters. Many of the ideas date back to the work of 
Marshall (1890), who identifies a number of positive externalities that arise when 
firms are located in close proximity. These include benefits from the exchange of 
knowledge, sharing of labour and access to suppliers. Locational advantages or 
agglomeration economies accumulate through the growth of related industries 
and the development of specialised labour markets. The availability of agglom-
eration economies means that, over time, specialization is likely to increase.
According to organization theory, during the last two decades of the twentieth 
century technological change and the changing nature of production tended to 
push in the direction of smaller-scale production. Another common theme has 
been the fostering of long-term relationships between buyers and suppliers, and 
the development of cooperative networks of firms. Specialised knowledge is a 
crucial determinant of firm performance. Consequently, firms tend to cluster in 
specific geographic areas to take advantage of learning opportunities and the 
sharing of knowledge (Lundvall and Johnson, 1994).
Industrial organization and strategic management literature views clusters as 
a consequence of specialised firms coming together to reduce transaction costs 
(see Chapters 5 and 20). In accordance with this approach, an industry is most 
accurately defined by identifying commonalities across firms situated at differ-
ent stages of the production process or value chain. This might involve grouping 
together raw material, intermediate input suppliers, end-user manufacturers and 
retailers into a single cluster (Porter, 1998a,b, 2001; Porter and Sovall, 1998; 
Enright, 1998, 2000).
The economic geography literature emphasises the effect of agglomeration 
economies on the dynamics of growth and trade (Harrison et al., 1996; Martin 
and Sunley, 1997). In seeking to explain geographic concentration, Krugman 
(1991, 2000) observes that much trade that takes place is intra-industry (between 
firms within the same industry). Trade theory based on notions of comparative 
advantage has little to say about this phenomenon. The geographic location of 
industry is driven primarily by regions seeking to exploit agglomeration econo-
mies. The initial location of trade is partly a product of historical accident but, 
as the gains from trade are realised, spatial patterns of location, specialization 
and trade become entrenched. Transport costs are an important influence on 
the location of industry but, even if transport costs are low, early patterns in the 
location of production (which may initially have been partly accidental) tend 
to persist. The role of forward and backward linkages is also important, and 
can lead to the appearance of vertically integrated clusters of firms. However, 
increased specialization can leave non-diversified regions highly exposed to busi-
ness cycle fluctuations.
Kay (2004) notes that the location of industry and clusters is the result of his-
torical accident and the co-evolution of capabilities and specialization.
Since mutually reinforcing capabilities and specialisms depend on past 
choices, forgotten or now irrelevant historical events still influence the 
location of production today. Film producers in the 1920s sought the 

320

light of southern California. Films are rarely made in California anymore, 
but Hollywood remains the centre of the world film industry. London 
is still a marketplace for shipbroking and marine insurance because of 
Britain’s historical past. Similar accidents of history – the site of Leland 
Stanford’s University and Xerox Corporation’s research facility – made 
Silicon Valley the centre of the international software industry.
(Kay, 2004, p. 73)
Porter (1998a) argues that the advantages of locating within a cluster might 
represent a countervailing factor that helps check the widespread tendency for 
the international relocation of production, a pervasive feature of the globaliza-
tion phenomenon. Globalization has resulted in improvements in communica-
tion, transport and distribution networks, enabling firms to switch productive 
activities between countries in order to reduce labour costs or tax liabilities. 
However, many low-cost locations are unable to offer adequate supplies of 
essential factor inputs or business support facilities; such locations may also 
fail to provide a suitable environment for innovation. Therefore, savings in 
labour costs or tax liabilities can be more than offset by losses in productivity. 
By locating within a cluster, firms can attract and retain key factor inputs and 
exploit opportunities for innovation. Steiner (2002) argues that current and 
future improvements in information technology and telecommunications may 
eventually permit the development of clusters that are not confined to specific 
geographic locations.
Clusters are a system of production which is more than just a territorial 
concentration of specific firms working in the same sector, but one which 
involves complex organizations with tight trans-sectorial relationships 
implying a change from ‘industrial district’ to ‘network’ forms of 
organization at the interregional and international level. Instead of 
interpreting the globalization process as an external constraint and 
a risk to their survival, the increasing regional production systems is 
viewed as the gradual extension to the international level of tight inter-
firm relationships, which have traditionally existed at the local and 
interregional level.
(Steiner, 2002, p. 208)

Summary
Chapter 11 has examined some of the main theoretical determinants of seller 
concentration. Why do some industries tend to become more highly concen-
trated than others, and what are the factors driving trends in seller concen-
tration over time? Theoretical determinants of seller concentration include the 
following:

	
	
	
11.5  Summary	 |	
321
■ Economies of scale.  The comparison between the total output that would be 
produced if each incumbent firm operates at minimum efficient scale, and the 
total demand for the industry’s product, has major implications for the number 
of firms the industry can profitably sustain.
■ Entry and exit.  Entry tends to reduce concentration if the average size of 
entrants is smaller than that of incumbents. However, the effect could be the 
opposite if entry takes place on a large scale, perhaps as a result of a diversifi-
cation strategy on the part of a large established firm from some other indus-
try. By reducing the numbers of incumbents, exit usually tends to increase 
concentration.
■ Scope for discretionary, sunk cost expenditure.  Advertising, product differen-
tiation and research and development are more important vehicles for dis-
cretionary investment in some industries than others. In industries which 
provide scope for these forms of sunk cost expenditure, incumbent firms 
tend to respond to an increase in demand by increasing their discretionary 
expenditures, leading to raised entry barriers, a larger minimum efficient scale 
and increased seller concentration. In industries without scope for significant 
sunk cost expenditures, any increase in demand may create opportunities for 
entrants, and seller concentration may tend to decrease.
■ Regulation.  Government competition policy directed towards monopolies, 
mergers or restrictive practices may have direct implications for seller concen-
tration. Policies that restrict the number of firms permitted to operate may 
tend to increase concentration.
■ The industry life cycle.  New and rapidly expanding industries may be capa-
ble of sustaining large numbers of firms, with small firms able to prosper 
by innovating or finding niches. Mature and declining industries are likely 
to accommodate smaller numbers of firms, as incumbents attempt to offset 
the effects on profitability of slow growth in demand by realizing econo-
mies of scale, and eventually by eliminating competition through collusion 
or merger.
■ Distinctive capabilities and core competences.  According to the resource-based 
theory of the firm, the successful firm itself, rather than the industry structure, 
is the ultimate source of the strategies and capabilities that will eventually 
determine structural indicators such as seller concentration.
According to the random growth hypothesis that is expressed by the Law 
of Proportionate Effect (Gibrat’s law), strong or weak growth performance is 
distributed randomly across firms. In any given period some firms may perform 
well and others perform badly, but the distribution of strong and weak growth 
performance between firms is essentially a matter of chance. Furthermore, past 
growth is no reliable indicator of the rate at which a firm will grow or decline 
in the future. According to this view, the growth performance of individual 
firms can neither be explained by specific identifiable characteristics of the firms

themselves, nor foreseen or predicted in advance. If individual firms’ growth is 
random, there is a natural tendency for industry structure to become increasingly 
concentrated over time.
Inspection of empirical data on trends in seller concentration suggests that 
the trend towards increased seller concentration in manufacturing, which was 
evident throughout much of the twentieth century, was repeated in many service 
industries towards the end of the century. Complex patterns of specialization and 
geographic concentration influence the spatial distribution of production within 
the EU and elsewhere. In particular, the phenomenon of clustering, whereby 
groups of interdependent firms located within a specific geographic area realise 
economies by establishing close vertical or horizontal relationships, is a loca-
tional pattern that receives much attention in the industrial organization, strate-
gic management and economic geography literatures.

Introduction
Barriers to entry are defined by Bain (1956) as conditions that allow established 
firms or incumbents to earn abnormal profits without attracting entry (see 
Box 1.1). Stigler (1968, p. 67) defines entry barriers as ‘a cost of producing (at 
some or every rate of output) which must be borne by a firm which seeks to enter

an industry but is not borne by firms already in the industry’. Spulber (2003, 
p. 55) defines an entry barrier as ‘any competitive advantage that established 
firms have over potential entrants’.
Section 12.2 identifies the principal types of barrier to entry. These include 
barriers that arise from economies of scale, or from an absolute cost advantage 
held by an incumbent over an entrant, or from product differentiation. Other 
barriers to entry include legal barriers and geographic barriers, which create dif-
ficulties for foreign firms attempting to trade in the domestic market. Many of 
the factors that give rise to the barriers to entry may be beyond the direct control 
of the incumbent firms. However, sometimes incumbents are able to take steps 
that increase the difficulties that new entrants will have to overcome if they are to 
establish themselves on a profitable basis. In other words, incumbents can imple-
ment entry-deterring strategies in an attempt to increase the size or height of 
barriers to entry. The entry-deterring strategies discussed in Section 12.3 include 
limit pricing, predatory pricing, and brand proliferation.
Paradoxically, the extent of barriers to exit may be an important factor deter-
mining the incentive for new firms to enter. It is costly to exit if production 
requires sunk cost investment expenditures. Sunk costs are costs that cannot be 
recovered if the firm subsequently decides to close down or exit. For example, 
expenditure on capital equipment that can only be used to manufacture the 
product in question and will be scrapped if the firm exits is an example of a 
sunk cost expenditure. Entry is therefore riskier in cases where the entrant is 
unable to recover its costs if its decision to enter subsequently turns out to be 
unsuccessful.
Even if the entrant is confident it can succeed, perhaps because it knows it 
can produce at a lower average cost than an incumbent, barriers to exit facing 
the incumbent may still be an important consideration for the entrant. If the 
incumbent has already incurred significant levels of sunk cost expenditure (for 
example, by building excess capacity), so its exit barriers are high, the incumbent 
is likely to resist attempts by the entrant to capture part or all of its market share, 
perhaps by initiating a price war. If there has been no sunk cost expenditure and 
exit barriers are low, the incumbent threatened by competition from a low-cost 
entrant might simply prefer to withdraw quietly. If entrants take account of the 
probable reaction of incumbents before deciding whether or not to enter, the 
extent of exit barriers facing incumbents may be an important factor influencing 
the entry decision. Section 12.4 examines ways in which incumbents can signal 
commitment to defend an established position of market dominance by deliber-
ately increasing their sunk cost expenditure.
Contestable markets theory is examined in Section 12.5. In industries where 
barriers to entry are surmountable, the threat of entry may keep prices close to 
the competitive level, even if there are few firms and the industry appears to be 
highly concentrated. Contestable markets theory breaks the direct link between 
the number and size distribution of sellers and the extent of market power or the 
discretion incumbents have in setting their own prices. Section 12.6 examines a 
more dynamic view of entry and market evolution over the long run. Entry is 
seen as a disequilibrating force that plays a central role in shaping the evolu-
tion of market or industry structure in the long run. The chapter concludes in

minants of entry and the main sources of barriers to entry.
	
12.2	
Types of barrier to entry
The types of barrier to entry examined in this section are economies of scale, abso-
lute cost advantage, product differentiation, switching costs, network externali-
ties, and legal and geographic barriers to entry. Carlton (2004) and McAfee et al. 
(2004) provide further discussion on classifying and measuring entry barriers.
Economies of scale
Economies of scale can act as a barrier to entry in two ways. First, there is an 
entry barrier if the MES is large relative to the total size of the market. As shown 
earlier, MES is the output level at which all potential economies of scale have 
been exploited, and the firm is operating at the lowest point on the LRAC func-
tion (see Section 2.2). The nature of the technology may be such that firms must 
claim a large market share in order to produce at the MES. A natural monop-
oly, in which long-run average costs decrease as output increases over all pos-
sible output levels the market can absorb, is the most extreme case. In a natural 
monopoly average costs are minimised if one firm occupies the entire market (see 
Section 3.4). This situation tends to arise in industries where fixed costs are high 
relative to variable costs.
The second way in which economies of scale can act as an entry barrier is when 
average costs associated with a production level below the MES are substantially 
greater than average costs at the MES. This is illustrated in Figure 12.1. In both 
industry A and industry B, the penalty for producing at 50 per cent of the MES 
is C1 - C2. This penalty is much greater in industry B than in industry A, due to 
the difference in slope between the two LRAC functions.

Economies of scale present the potential entrant with a dilemma. Either 
the entrant accepts the risk associated with large-scale entry in order to avoid 
the average cost penalty, or the entrant enters at a smaller scale and absorbs the 
average cost penalty. Large-scale entry is risky because the expansion in industry 
capacity might disrupt an established industry equilibrium, depressing prices and 
inviting retaliatory action from incumbents. On the other hand, small-scale entry 
may not be viable, because the average cost penalty may make it impossible for 
the entrant to operate profitably alongside incumbents already producing at (or 
beyond) the MES.
Pratten (1988) provides some empirical estimates of the extent to which econo-
mies of scale acted as a barrier to entry for a number of European industries in 
1986. Table 12.1 shows estimates of the additional average cost that would be 
incurred by operating at 50 per cent of the MES, in comparison with the average 
cost incurred when operating at the MES expressed as a percentage of the latter.
Absolute cost advantage
An incumbent has an absolute cost advantage entry barrier over an entrant if the 
LRAC function of the entrant lies above that of the incumbent, and the entrant 
therefore faces a higher average cost at every level of output. This situation is 
illustrated in Figure 12.2.
There are several reasons why an entrant may operate on a higher LRAC func-
tion. First, an incumbent may have access to a superior production process, hold 
patents, or be party to trade secrets. For example, the Monopolies and Mergers 
Commission (1968) estimated that it would take an entrant to the cellulose fibre 
industry between five and seven years to catch up with state-of-the-art produc-
tion technology. Patenting involves the deliberate creation of a property right for

new knowledge, intended to protect an innovator from imitation by rivals. From 
a public policy perspective, the motive for allowing patents may be to increase 
consumer welfare. Patents encourage firms to invest in research and develop-
ment, with the promise of monopoly profits for successful innovators, as well as 
increased choice and utility for consumers.
However, patenting can also be used by an incumbent strategically, in an 
attempt to deter entry. For example, a firm in possession of a new technology 
may apply for multiple patents to cover all possible spin-offs, so as to deny 
rivals the opportunity to invent around the new technology. In chemicals, for 
example, minor variations in molecular structure can easily lead to the creation 
of new product spin-offs (Needham, 1976). In the defence industry, new firms 
incur substantial entry costs related to technology and research and develop-
ment expenditure in order to produce sophisticated defence equipment (Hartley, 
2003). Langinier (2004) presents a theoretical model that assesses the extent 
to which patents and patent renewals act as a barrier to entry. In cases of low 
demand and asymmetric information regarding market demand, patent renewal 
is shown to deter entry. However, if market demand is high, patent renewals do 
not discourage entry. The economics of patenting is examined in more detail in 
Section 18.5.
Second, incumbent firms may have exclusive ownership of factor inputs. They 
may control the best raw materials, or have recruited the most qualified or expe-
rienced labour or management personnel. Consequently, entrants are forced to 
rely on more expensive, less-efficient or lower-quality alternatives. For example, 
British Airways exercises influence over landing slots at London’s Heathrow 
Airport, forcing competitors to use less-attractive airports. However, through 
a variety of innovative strategies low-cost entrants have been able to overcome 
this entry barrier and operate profitably. For example, low-cost airlines have: 
unbundled their core product by charging separate prices for the flight itself and 
extras such as meals; reduced costs by using cheaper airports; simplified ticket 
purchase and check-in arrangements; reduced airport turnaround times; and 
made more intensive use of their aircraft (Johnson, 2003).

Third, incumbents may have access to cheaper sources of finance, if they are 
viewed by capital markets as less risky than new firms. For example, in phar-
maceuticals, large incumbents with well-established research and development 
programmes are deemed less likely than their smaller counterparts to develop 
products that subsequently go on to fail drug trials. Lower risk means that 
preferential financial backing is easier to attain (Nightingale, 2003). If the new 
firm’s management is previously unknown, any funds loaned are likely to carry 
a risk premium.
Finally, the presence of vertically integrated incumbents in industries such as 
biotechnology, brewing, iron, mobile telephones, steel or chemicals may force an 
entrant to operate at more than one stage of production if it wishes to overcome 
the incumbents’ absolute cost advantage. In European brewing, for example, 
any new firm would not only manufacture beer, but also be able to source sup-
plies, promote the finished product and establish an efficient network of distribu-
tion outlets (Lawler and Lee, 2003). Denying rivals access to inputs or markets 
through various forms of vertical exclusion may be subject to legal challenge 
under competition law (see Chapter 24), but this is not to say that such practices 
never take place.
It is worth noting that an absolute cost differential need not always work in 
favour of the incumbent. It is possible that an incumbent has overpaid for its 
assets, in which case the entrant may be favoured. This might be true in industries 
reliant on rapidly changing technologies, such as computer hardware or software, 
whose costs fall rapidly over time. In some cases the entrant may be spared the 
costs of persuading consumers to accept a new idea or a new product, such costs 
having already been incurred by incumbents.
Demsetz (1982) argues that Bain’s (1956) absolute cost advantage does not 
reflect the abuse of market power by incumbents, but simply reflects the scarcity 
of resources and the associated rents. However, this comment does not invali-
date the preceding discussion, in so far as it concerns structural barriers to entry. 
These additional costs are real enough to potential entrants, and they do not 
necessarily derive from the exploitation of market power.
Product differentiation
A barrier to entry exists if customers are loyal to the established brands and 
reputations of incumbents. A successful entrant will need to persuade customers 
to switch from their existing suppliers. This might be achieved either by selling 
the same product at a lower price, or launching advertising, marketing or other 
promotional campaigns (Comanor and Wilson, 1967). Due to price-cutting or 
increased costs (or both) the entrant is faced with a squeeze on profit, at least 
during the initial start-up phase. Product differentiation entry barriers include 
the following:
■ High advertising imposes additional costs upon entrants. To overcome existing 
brand loyalties or customer inertia, the entrant must spend proportionately 
more on advertising for each prospective customer. This is an absolute cost 
advantage barrier. For example, in the brewing industry it is estimated that the 

330	
|	 12    ■    Barriers to entry
establishment of a leading European brand through advertising takes around 
20 years (Competition Commission, 2001; Lawler and Lee, 2003).
■ If entry takes place on a small scale, the entrant will not benefit from econ-
omies of scale in advertising. Large-scale advertisers may benefit from an 
increasingly effective message, and decreasing average advertising costs.
■ The funds needed to finance an advertising campaign may incur a risk pre-
mium, as this type of investment is high risk. Furthermore, it creates no tan-
gible assets that can be sold in the event of failure.
In some cases, incumbents may deliberately seek to increase the degree of product 
differentiation through brand proliferation, in order to raise barriers to entry. 
Product differentiation or brand proliferation as a form of entry-deterring strat-
egy is examined in Section 12.3.
Switching costs
Switching costs are incurred when customers face additional costs if they 
decide to change the supplier of a product or service. Switching costs may 
include: search costs incurred in acquiring information about alternative 
products or services; the costs of learning how to use a different product or 
service; and installation or disconnection charges. Switching costs raise bar-
riers to entry into markets for a wide range of products such as credit cards, 
computer software, utilities (supplies of gas, electricity and water), telephones 
and banking services.
For example, consumers wishing to change a mobile telephone may have to 
purchase a new handset, master a new interface, pay a disconnection charge, 
and set up new billing arrangements. Further switching costs may be incurred 
when a good or service is tied to an aftermarket, through servicing or the need 
to purchase refills or replacement components. Tying makes it difficult for 
users to switch to alternative suppliers. Users become locked in to an existing 
supplier, which acquires ex post market power. Bargain-then-ripoff pricing, a 
policy of offering new customers a low price to attract their custom and then 
charging existing customers a high price in order to extract increased revenue 
or profit, works best when locked in customers can be separated from new 
ones; for example, in markets where users are tied into buying complementary 
products, such as ink refills or spare parts for cars; or in markets where prices 
are individually negotiated. If there is only one price, the supplier must com-
promise between a low price to attract new users and a high price to exploit 
locked-in users.
To what extent do switching costs distort competition? Barriers to entry aris-
ing from switching costs due to incompatibility of technological standards can 
result in the segmentation of a market into submarkets or segments, such that 
an incumbent within a particular segment concentrates on charging high prices 
to its existing customers, and does not even attempt to attract customers from 
rival producers. Klemperer (2008) suggests that in view of the anticompetitive 
and entry-deterring effects of switching costs, regulatory attention should focus 

	
	
	
12.2  Types of barrier to entry	 |	
331
on situations where incompatibility is a matter of strategic choice rather than 
governed by the nature of the technology.
Network externalities
Network externalities arise when the value of a product or service to a con-
sumer depends upon the number of other consumers using the same product 
or service (Katz and Shapiro, 1985; Economides, 1996; Farrell and Klemperer, 
2007; Klemperer, 2008). Each consumer purchases the product or service for 
their own benefit, but by doing so they (unintentionally) create a benefit for 
other users who gain extra value as the size or coverage of the network of 
users increases. Network externalities make it difficult for new firms to enter 
when an incumbent has already established a large or comprehensive user 
network. As more users buy into the network, an effective monopoly might 
be created, raising formidable barriers to entry for any entrant wishing to 
challenge the dominance of the established product, service or technological 
standard. Chapter 22 examines the economics of markets that are subject to 
network externalities.
Markets subject to network externalities include those in which users are 
linked through communication systems such as telephones or the internet. Com-
puter operating systems and widely used applications, such as Microsoft Win-
dows and Microsoft Office, are subject to network externalities. For example, 
the value to a jobseeker of acquiring the skills required to use Microsoft products 
increases with the number of employers that use the same products. The ability 
to share files that are specific to Microsoft products depends on the number 
of other users of the same products. Stock and derivatives exchanges are also 
subject to network externalities. As the number of traders in an established 
exchange increases, liquidity increases and transaction costs decrease. A new 
exchange might face a formidable barrier to entry in attempting to overcome 
these advantages.
Direct network externalities exist when the network becomes more attractive 
to new users as the level of adoption increases. Indirect network externalities 
arise when increased adoption affects a related market. Bandwagon effects are 
characteristic of successful networks. Success in establishing a network depends 
on users’ expectations as to which network will achieve dominance, and on the 
coordination of users’ choices. In the early stages of the commercial development 
of a new technological standard, producers tend to compete aggressively, know-
ing that success depends not only on the tastes of individual consumers, but also 
on their expectations as to the most likely winner.
With compatible technological standards, consumers may be able to enjoy 
full network benefits without having to buy from a single producer. If consum-
ers are willing to pay a higher price for this benefit, then firms might be encour-
aged to supply compatible products. However, an incumbent might still prefer 
incompatibility, because this serves as a barrier to entry. Incompatibility might 
damage consumers in several ways. Competing standards may result in market 
fragmentation, in which case the benefits of network externalities fail to materi-
alise. On the other hand, if the market ‘tips’ towards one technological standard, 

332	
|	 12    ■    Barriers to entry
it is possible that a later and technologically superior standard fails to become 
established. Competition between producers seeking to become the established 
standard might encourage bargain-then-ripoff pricing. Producers may initially 
compete aggressively in order to become the standard, but the winner may sub-
sequently abuse its market power so as to earn abnormal profits (Salop and 
Stiglitz, 1977).
Legal barriers to entry
Legal barriers to entry are erected by governments and enforced by law. Both the 
Chicago and Austrian schools view legal barriers as highly damaging to competi-
tion. Examples of legal barriers include the following:
■ Registration, certification and licensing of businesses and products.  Some 
industries are characterised by the need to seek official permission to trade, 
for example pubs, taxis, airlines and defence equipment (Hartley, 2003). For 
pharmaceuticals, legal barriers to entry facing new firms or products are high, 
arising from the framework of safety rules and regulations requiring products 
to satisfy a myriad of standards and tests (Nightingale, 2003). In some cases, 
incumbents may press for more stringent regulation, in an attempt to keep out 
firms that do not meet industry standards. Under this guise of maintaining 
standards, low-cost entrants may be denied access to the market.
■ Monopoly rights.  Monopoly rights may be granted by legislation. The govern-
ment might allow certain firms exclusive rights to produce certain goods and 
services for a limited or unlimited period. An example is franchised monopo-
lies in industries such as the railways, mobile telephones and television broad-
casting. Franchised monopolies are often awarded in situations of natural 
monopoly, where average costs are minimised when one firm occupies the 
entire market, or in cases where firms require the guarantee of a relatively large 
market share in order to invest in technology and product development.
■ Patents.  As noted above, patenting involves the deliberate creation of a prop-
erty right, enforced by law. Ownership of a patent confers monopoly rights and 
the potential to earn an abnormal profit, usually for a fixed period. The inten-
tion is to encourage research and development and innovation, by enabling suc-
cessful innovators to appropriate the returns from their original investment. The 
disadvantage, from a public policy perspective, is that by granting an incumbent 
exclusive rights to use a piece of technology or produce a particular product, 
competition is impeded and the pace of diffusion of a technology is inhibited.
■ Government policies.  Government policies can also create legal barriers to 
entry directly. Friedman (1962) suggests tariffs, tax policies and employment 
laws may all impede entry, either directly or indirectly. For example, in several 
European countries car tax is related to engine capacity. This has the effect of 
increasing the price of cars imported from the US, which have greater engine 
capacity on average.
Klapper et al. (2004) examine ways in which regulation hampers entry, espe-
cially in industries where start-up costs are low and high rates of entry would

333
normally be expected. Value added in naturally ‘high-entry’ industries tends to 
grow more slowly in countries with high entry barriers.
Geographic barriers to entry
Geographic barriers to entry include restrictions faced by foreign firms attempting 
to trade in the domestic market. Geographic barriers affect the extent and type of 
entry (for example, greenfield investments, acquisitions or joint ventures) under-
taken by foreign firms (Elango and Sambharya, 2004). Examples of geographic 
entry barriers include the following:
■ Physical barriers.  Frontier controls and customs formalities create administra-
tive and storage costs, and lead to delays in transactions being completed.
■ Technical barriers.  Technical barriers include requirements to meet specific 
technical standards, employment regulations, health and safety regulations 
and transport regulations.
■ Fiscal barriers.  Aspects of a country’s fiscal regime may disadvantage foreign 
firms. Exchange controls may impose costs on foreign firms that need to convert 
currencies in order to trade. Tariffs, quotas or subsidies to domestic producers 
may place foreign producers at a disadvantage relative to domestic producers.
■ Preferential public procurement policies.  Purchasing policies practised by 
national governments may give preferential treatment to domestic firms, plac-
ing foreign competitors at a disadvantage.
■ Language and cultural barriers.  Language or other cultural differences 
between countries may also be considered as a geographic barrier to entry 
(Ghemawat, 2003).
Case study 12.1
Barriers to entry in retail banking
New entrants to the retail banking sector face significant challenges in attracting custom-
ers and expanding their market shares, an OFT review has found. The review of barriers 
to entry, expansion and exit in retail banking was launched in May 2010 to identify any 
obstacles blocking firms from entering the sector or from successfully competing against 
existing firms, as well as factors preventing inefficient firms from exiting the market and 
being replaced by more efficient ones.
The OFT has established a body of evidence relating to the size and significance of 
potential barriers, based on extensive consultation with the industry, including established 
incumbent banks and building societies, new and prospective entrants and consumer and 
industry groups. A copy of the review will be submitted to the Independent Commission 
on Banking which is examining issues of competition and stability in the banking market.

334	
|	 12    ■    Barriers to entry
The OFT examined four aspects of personal and small and medium-sized enterprise 
(SME) banking to identify possible barriers: 1. the regulatory process; 2. access to essential 
inputs necessary to offer retail banking products such as IT systems, payment schemes, 
information and finance; 3. the ability of new entrants to grow by attracting new custom-
ers; 4. issues around exiting the market.
While the review found that most prospective entrants are able to meet regulatory 
requirements, and source the necessary inputs to offer retail banking services, new provid-
ers face difficulties in attracting customers and expanding market share. This is because 
of the reluctance of personal and small business customers to switch providers, their loy-
alty to established brands, and preference for banks with a local branch. This was most 
marked for personal and business current account customers, whereas personal customers 
were more likely to shop around for loan products.
The other major findings were that:
■ Some firms reported problems around the process of becoming authorised by the FSA 
to accept deposits, with a lack of transparency and uncertainty causing delays and dif-
ficulties in raising funds. The FSA has recently revised its authorisation process and 
this should lead to greater transparency and certainty.
■ Existing capital requirements may disproportionately affect new entrants and smaller 
banks by requiring them to hold proportionally more capital than incumbents. As 
capital and liquidity requirements are updated, it may be appropriate for the prudential 
regulators to consider and monitor their impact on competition.
■ Entering the market involves significant IT investment, often in the form of sunk costs, 
which can account for up to two-thirds of start-up costs. This makes it all the more 
important for firms to be able to grow quickly, to spread those costs over a larger 
customer base.
■ New entrants are able to access industry-wide payment schemes such as CHAPS and 
BACS, and information on personal and SME customer risk profiles is widely avail-
able. However, credit risk information about micro-enterprises is limited, which may 
make it harder for new banks to lend to the smallest firms.
■ Following the financial crisis, the ability of some firms to expand could be constrained 
by the current lack of interbank lending.
■ There is no evidence to suggest that the regulatory framework dealing with how a 
failing bank exits the sector prevents inefficient firms leaving the market, but the OFT 
encourages the authorities to give due consideration to competition issues when these 
arrangements are operated.
The review also explored whether there are specific issues around barriers to entry, 
expansion and exit in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. While the review 
did not find significant differences in relation to most of the themes covered, it did find 
that brand loyalty to incumbent national brands in Scotland and Northern Ireland may

be greater than elsewhere in the UK and that new entrants’ choice of location is largely 
driven by the size of the potential customer base, with highly populated urban areas seen 
as more attractive than rural areas.
Clive Maxwell, OFT Executive Director for Goods, Services and Mergers said:
Vigorous competition in retail banking is vital for personal and small business 
customers and helps support growth and productivity in the economy. If firms 
face significant difficulties in entering and competing in the market, incumbents 
have less incentive to reduce costs, innovate and price competitively.
A number of firms have recently entered the market, and more are expected to follow. 
While we found few barriers to setting up, new firms trying to grow in this market face 
difficulties due to customers’ low levels of switching, loyalty to incumbent providers, and 
attachment to a local branch.
We hope that this review will be of value to the Independent Commission on Banking, 
and contribute to the wider debate on the future of banking.
As a result of the above OFT report, the FSA (Financial Services Authority) was given 
the task of examining whether its regulatory framework was too ‘burdensome’ for new 
entrants. In 2013 FSA issued a review of its processes and rules, and described changes 
that would facilitate easier market entry in future covering ‘both the specific prudential, 
conduct and organizational requirements that must be put in place for authorisation, and the 
process through which these rules are applied’.

Case study 12.2
Competition watchdog focuses on bank  
account switching
FT
Halfway through its investigation of retail banking, the UK competition watchdog has 
said barriers to entry are not a big problem and it is focusing on why customers are not 
switching current accounts. The Competition and Markets Authority has been formally 
reviewing personal current accounts and small business lending since November, looking 
at whether a few big banks have too large a share of the market, at barriers for new lend-
ers and at the ability of customers to switch accounts. It said on Thursday it will consider 

336	
|	 12    ■    Barriers to entry
whether the fact that customers may have a number of services from the same bank—such 
as loans, credit cards and overdrafts—‘might make switching more difficult, and whether 
activities such as cross-selling of products and tying or bundling of banking products 
occurs and may increase switching costs and act as a barrier to entry and expansion’.
Its initial findings indicate there is not a significant problem with barriers to entering 
the market. Banks have been opening or expanding in the UK: Santander and Metro 
Bank have seen the biggest increase in market share for current accounts since 2011, 
while Nationwide and TSB have seen small increases, the CMA said. The combined 
market share of the four largest banks—Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scot-
land, Barclays and HSBC—has been decreasing, though they still account for more than 
70 per cent.
The CMA research indicates a bigger problem may be that retail customers tend not 
to switch banks. In a survey by the watchdog, about 3 per cent of customers said they 
switched their main current account in the past year but 81 per cent did not even look at 
different options. While about half said they did not look for another account because 
they were ‘very satisfied’ with their provider, the regulator expressed worry that this is 
because they have low expectations.
The CMA said it had not reached any conclusions on the subject and would continue 
to focus on customer perceptions of switching, and whether having multiple products 
from the same bank makes it harder to move. Paul Pester, chief executive of TSB, said the 
UK banking market was not working ‘for the real benefit of UK consumers’. ‘Creating 
a more dynamic switching market, addressing the scale advantages of the big banks and 
tackling barriers to entry can help consumers get a better deal and ultimately rebuild trust 
in the industry,’ he said. The CMA has also hired Deloitte, a consultancy, to research 
new products and services in retail banking and what they mean for competition. The 
review also found a shortage of customer information about the quality of bank service 
and the cost of overdrafts.
Alex Chisholm, chief executive of the CMA, told the Financial Times in November that 
it was also investigating free banking for customers whose current accounts are in credit. 
The regulator has the power to demand that companies divest parts of their business or 
change the prices of their products. It can also demand changes to the way banks provide 
information to customers and impose price changes.

Bain (1956) argues that barriers to entry arising from economies of scale, 
absolute cost advantage and product differentiation are generally stable in the 
long run. However, this does not imply these barriers should be regarded as per-
manent. The same comment applies to entry barriers arising from switching costs 
and network externalities, and legal and geographic barriers. Market structures 
can and do change eventually, and the importance of any entry barrier can vary

over time. For example, new technology may reshape the LRAC functions of 
both incumbents and entrants, transforming the nature of economies of scale. 
New deposits of a raw material may be discovered, reducing the absolute cost 
advantage enjoyed by an incumbent. One highly innovative marketing campaign 
might completely wipe out long-established brand loyalties or other product dif-
ferentiation advantages of incumbents.
The Chicago school regards Bain’s definition of barriers to entry, which 
includes any obstacle a new firm must overcome to enter a market, as too gen-
eral to be useful. Stigler’s preferred definition is limited to factors that impose 
a higher long-run production cost on the entrant than on the incumbent. The 
Chicago school argues that it is rare for such a cost differential to endure in the 
long run. Therefore the most important issue is not the existence of barriers to 
entry, but rather the speed with which entry barriers can be surmounted (Stigler, 
1968; Demsetz, 1982).
	
12.3	
Entry-deterring strategies
The barriers to entry examined in Section 12.2 stem from underlying product or 
technological characteristics, and cannot be changed easily by incumbent firms. 
In contrast, entry-deterring strategies are barriers to entry that are created or 
raised deliberately by incumbents through their own actions. Relevant actions 
might include changes in price or production levels, or in some cases merely the 
threat that such changes will be implemented if entry takes place. A credible 
threat of this kind may be sufficient to deter potential entrants from proceed-
ing. The extent to which it is possible for an incumbent to adopt entry-deterring 
strategies depends on the degree of market power exercised by the incumbent 
(Cabral, 2008).
This section examines three types of entry-deterring strategy. The first two 
are pricing strategies: limit pricing and predatory pricing. The third is strate-
gic product differentiation or brand proliferation, whereby incumbents employ 
advertising or other forms of marketing activity to strengthen brand loyalties.
Limit pricing
Suppose a market is currently serviced by a single producer but entry barriers are 
not insurmountable. The incumbent therefore faces a threat of potential entry. 
According to the theory of limit pricing, the incumbent might attempt to prevent 
entry by charging a price, known as the limit price, defined as the highest price 
the incumbent believes it can charge without inviting entry. The limit price is 
below the monopoly price, but above the incumbent’s average cost. Therefore 
the incumbent earns an abnormal profit, but this abnormal profit is lower than 
the monopoly profit (Martin, 2008).
To pursue a limit-pricing strategy, the incumbent must enjoy some form of 
cost advantage over the potential entrants. In the limit pricing models developed 
below, this is assumed to take the form of either an absolute cost advantage or an 
economies of scale entry barrier. It is therefore assumed that a structural barrier 

338	
|	 12    ■    Barriers to entry
to entry exists, but this barrier may be surmountable unless the incumbent adopts 
a pricing strategy that makes it unattractive for entrants to proceed.
A critical assumption underlying models of limit pricing concerns the nature of 
the reaction the entrants expect from the incumbent, if the entrants proceed with 
their entry decision. A key assumption of these models is that entrants assume the 
incumbent would maintain its output at the pre-entry level in the event that entry 
takes place. Therefore the incumbent is prepared to allow price to fall to a level 
determined by the location of the combined post-entry output (of the incumbent 
and entrants) on the market demand function (Sylos-Labini, 1962). Notice that 
this assumption (which has been termed the Sylos Postulate in the barriers to 
entry literature) is equivalent to the zero conjectural variation assumption that we 
have encountered previously in the development of the Cournot duopoly model 
(see Section 7.3).
Figure 12.3 shows the limit pricing model in the case of an absolute cost 
advantage entry barrier. It is assumed there is a single incumbent and a fringe 
comprising a large number of small competitive potential entrants. LRAC1 is 
the incumbent’s average cost function, and LRAC2 is the entrants’ average cost 
function. In order to concentrate solely on the effects of absolute cost advantage 
(and exclude economies of scale), it is assumed both LRAC functions are hori-
zontal, and therefore equivalent to the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) func-
tions. The incumbent’s monopoly price and output are (PM, QM). At all output 
levels, the entrants’ average cost is below PM. Therefore, if the incumbent oper-
ates at (PM, QM) initially, entry takes place subsequently. The entrants produce 
Q* - QM, reducing the price to P*, and reducing the incumbent’s abnormal 
profit from BPMEG (­pre-entry) to BP*FG (post-entry).
Suppose instead the incumbent pursues a limit-pricing strategy in the short 
run. This involves operating at (P*, Q*) initially. If entry takes place, industry

339
output is increased above Q*, causing price to fall below P*(= LRAC2). The 
entrants’ residual demand function shows the relationship between industry 
price and the entrants’ output, assuming (in accordance with the zero conjectural 
variation assumption) the incumbent maintains its output at Q*. The residual 
demand function is equivalent to the segment of the market demand function 
that lies to the right of Q*. Since the residual demand function lies below LRAC2 
at all output levels, the entrants conclude they cannot earn a normal profit and 
abstain from entry. The incumbent’s position at (P*, Q*), and its abnormal profit 
of BP*HJ, are sustainable in both the pre-entry and post-entry periods. BP*HJ 
exceeds BP*FG, the long-run abnormal profit in the previous case where the 
incumbent starts at (PM, QM) and allows entry to take place.
Figure 12.4 shows the limit pricing model in the case of an economies of scale 
entry barrier. In this case, it is more natural to consider the case of a single incum-
bent and a single entrant (rather than a fringe of small competitive entrants), 
because both firms would need to operate at a reasonably large scale in order to 
benefit from economies of scale. For simplicity, only the limit pricing solution 
(and not the comparison with the monopoly pricing solution) is shown. LRAC is 
the average cost function of both the incumbent and the entrant. The incumbent 
can prevent entry by operating at (P*, Q*). As before, the residual demand func-
tion is the entrant’s effective demand function when the incumbent is producing 
Q*, equivalent to the section of the market demand function to the right of Q*. 
The residual demand function lies below LRAC at all output levels. If the entrant 
produces a low output, it fails to benefit from economies of scale. If the entrant 
produces a high output, it benefits from economies of scale, but the extra output 
causes price to drop to a level that is unprofitable. Therefore the entrant con-
cludes it cannot earn a normal profit at any output level, and abstains from entry.
There is limited empirical evidence concerning the use or effectiveness of 
limit pricing strategies. Much of the evidence that is available is anecdotal. For

example, Scherer and Ross (1990) observe that the pricing policy of the Reynolds 
Pen Corporation, manufacturers of the first ballpoint pens, invited entry on a 
large scale. In 1945 the price was between US$12 and US$20, but by 1948 the 
price had fallen to 50 cents and Reynolds’ market share was close to zero. In 
the 1960s Xerox implemented a strategy of charging low prices to low-volume 
users (less than 5,000 copies per month). An alternative technology (wet copying) 
was available, and Xerox’s pricing strategy was designed to deter low-volume 
users from switching to this alternative product. Yamawaki (2002) examines 
how incumbent firms in the US luxury car market responded to threatened or 
actual entry from Japanese manufacturers during the period 1986–97. There was 
a tendency for incumbent firms to reduce prices and markups. However, surveys 
by Smiley (1988) and Singh et al. (1998) find limited evidence of the use of limit 
pricing as an entry-deterring strategy.
Stigler (1968) and Yamey (1972) criticise the theory of limit pricing on the 
following grounds:
■ Why is it more profitable to attempt to restrict all entry rather than retard the 
rate of entry?
■ Why should the entrant believe the incumbent would not alter its pricing and 
output policies if entry takes place?
■ If an industry is growing, it may be difficult to persuade a potential entrant 
that there is no market available if entry takes place.
■ Market structure is ignored. Applied to the case of oligopoly, the theory 
assumes all incumbent firms would implement a limit-pricing strategy. For 
this strategy to succeed, a high level of coordination or collusion would be 
required.
■ Limit pricing implies perfect information regarding the market demand func-
tion, the incumbent’s own costs, the entrants’ costs and so on. These would 
be impossible to estimate with any degree of precision. Predatory pricing (see 
below) might offer an easier alternative: the incumbent would simply set a 
price below that of the entrant until the entrant withdraws.
■ The status of the entrant is all-important. An incumbent may wish to seek an 
accommodation with a large potential entrant.
Predatory pricing
A strategy of predatory pricing on the part of an incumbent firm involves cutting 
price in an attempt to force a rival firm out of business. When the rival has with-
drawn, the incumbent raises its price. The incumbent adopts the role of predator, 
sacrificing profit and perhaps sustaining losses in the short run, in order to pro-
tect its market power and maintain its ability to earn abnormal profit in the long 
run. For example, Bresnahan and Reiss (1991), Joskow et al. (1994) and Marion 
(1998) report evidence of price-cutting by incumbents, following entry into the 
tyre, airline and grocery industries, respectively. Strictly speaking, predatory pric-
ing is a post-entry strategy. However, an incumbent faced with threatened entry 
might attempt to ward off the threat by convincing the potential entrant it would 

	
	
	
12.3  Entry-deterring strategies	 |	
341
implement a predatory pricing policy in the event that entry takes place (Myers, 
1994; Ordover, 2008).
Faced with the threat or the actuality of price-cutting on the part of a preda-
tor, how might an entrant or another rival firm respond? The rival might be able 
to convince the predator it is in their mutual interest to merge, or find some other 
way of sharing the market between them. Alternatively, the rival might be able to 
convince customers it is not in their interest to accept price cuts from the preda-
tor in the short run, if the consequence is that the predator achieves monopoly 
status in the long run.
Another possible response would be for the rival firm to reduce its output, 
forcing the predator to produce at an even higher volume than it might have 
planned, in order to maintain the reduced price. If the reduced price is below 
the predator’s average variable cost, the predator’s losses are increased, and 
the length of time over which it can sustain the price-cutting strategy might be 
reduced. If the rival firm does not have large sunk costs, it might be able to rede-
ploy its assets to some other industry and (temporarily) withdraw altogether, in 
the expectation that it will return when the predator raises its price.
The (anti-interventionist) Chicago school is rather sceptical about the reality 
of predatory pricing. First, the predator’s gain in profit in the long run must 
exceed the loss resulting from price-cutting in the short run. It may be difficult 
for a predator to be certain this condition will be met. Second, for a predatory 
pricing strategy to succeed in deterring entry, the predator has to convince the 
entrant it is prepared to maintain the reduced price and sustain losses for as 
long as the entrant remains in business. It may be difficult or impossible for the 
predator to signal this degree of commitment to the entrant. Third, as suggested 
above, for a predatory pricing strategy to be worthwhile, the predator has to 
be sure that having forced its rival out of business and raised its price, the entry 
threat will not return, either in the form of the same rival or some other firm. To 
prevent this from happening, the predator might attempt to acquire the rival’s 
assets. Finally, if an incumbent and an entrant have identical cost functions, a 
predatory pricing strategy could just as easily be used by the entrant against the 
incumbent as the other way round. Therefore, predatory pricing is not necessarily 
or solely an entry-deterring strategy.
For regulators, it is often difficult to determine whether a specific price-cutting 
campaign constitutes predatory pricing, which is likely to be unlawful under 
competition legislation, or whether it constitutes a legitimate strategy to acquire 
market share that will also benefit consumers. From 26 proven cases of predatory 
competition in the US, in only six was there clear economic evidence of predatory 
pricing (Koller, 1975).
Brand proliferation
For many product types, a certain amount of product differentiation is quite 
natural, in view of basic product characteristics and consumer tastes (see 
­Section 12.2). In some imperfectly competitive markets, however, incumbents 
may employ advertising or other types of marketing campaign to create or 
strengthen brand loyalties beyond what is natural, in order to raise the start-up 

342	
|	 12    ■    Barriers to entry
costs faced by entrants. A firm wishing to establish a new brand would incur sig-
nificant sunk costs in the form of advertising and other promotional expenditure.
Brand proliferation, or spurious product differentiation, refers to efforts by 
an incumbent firm to crowd the market with similar brands, denying an entrant 
the opportunity to establish a distinctive identity for its own brand. This form of 
entry-deterring strategy is common in markets for products such as detergents and 
processed foods. From the incumbent’s perspective, however, a strategy of brand 
proliferation could simply cannibalise existing brands. The incumbent firm might 
also raise its own average costs relative to those of an entrant (Spulber, 2003).
Advertising can help raise barriers to entry. An incumbent firm may ben-
efit from an absolute cost advantage in advertising if its past advertising invest-
ment has helped establish name recognition or brand loyalty among consumers. 
Consumer familiarity makes current advertising more effective than it is for an 
entrant attempting to establish a presence in the market for the first time. Econo-
mies of scale in advertising may also make it difficult for small-scale entrants to 
compete effectively with incumbents who are already producing and advertising 
on a large scale.
Using a sample of 800 advertising managers, Paton (2008) investigates the 
extent to which managers perceive actual or potential entry in determining the 
level of advertising. Nearly 25 per cent of the firms in the sample stated that they 
attributed importance to entry deterrence as an aim of their advertising. In addi-
tion, over 20 per cent of firms responded that they would increase advertising 
expenditure in response to the entry of a rival product or service.
Existing brand loyalties, and therefore entry barriers, are strengthened in 
cases where consumers incur significant switching costs associated with switch-
ing to another supplier. Customers with high switching costs are committed to 
remaining with their existing suppliers, and cannot easily be lured elsewhere (see 
Section 12.2).
Loyalty discounts, exclusive dealing and refusal to supply are all strategies 
intended to deny entrants access to supplies of inputs or access to customers. For 
example, the London radio station Capital Radio’s practice of offering exclusiv-
ity deals to advertisers was investigated by the UK’s Office of Fair Trading in 
1994. In return for agreeing to advertise exclusively on Capital Radio, the adver-
tiser received a discount. The effect of these agreements was to exclude Capital’s 
competitors from a significant segment of the radio advertising market (OFT, 
1994). A similar case involved petrol retailing in the UK in the 1960s, when many 
independent retailers signed long-term contracts to receive petrol supplies from 
a sole supplier. Vertical relationships of this kind are examined in Chapter 21.
	
12.4	
Signalling commitment
Dixit (1982) uses a game-theoretic model to describe a situation in which an 
incumbent firm attempts to deter entry by deliberately increasing its sunk cost 
expenditure before entry takes place. The incumbent creates and signals a com-
mitment to fight entry by engaging the entrant in a price war, in the event that 
entry subsequently occurs.

	
	
	
12.4  Signalling commitment	 |	
343
A passive incumbent does not pre-commit to fighting the entrant, in the event 
that entry subsequently takes place. In other words, a passive incumbent waits 
to see if entry occurs, before investing in the additional productive capacity or 
the aggressive marketing campaign that will be required to fight a price war. In 
contrast, a committed incumbent does pre-commit, by incurring the sunk cost 
expenditure that will be required to fight in advance, before it knows whether 
or not entry will actually take place. Figure 12.5 shows the array of possible 
outcomes in a sequential game (see also Section 9.5) played by an incumbent 
and an entrant, in the form of realised final profits or losses for each firm. These 
depend upon whether the incumbent is passive or committed, and upon whether 
entry actually does occur.
Passive incumbent
Suppose the incumbent is passive. If the entrant stays out, the incumbent earns 
the monopoly profit and the entrant earns zero. In Figure 12.5, this outcome is 
denoted (Pm, 0). If entry does occur, the incumbent can either fight a price war or 
accommodate the entrant by sharing the market. In the event of a price war, both 
firms earn a loss of Pw. This outcome is denoted (Pw, Pw). In the event that the 
firms share the market, both earn duopoly profit and the outcome is (Pd, Pd). It is 
assumed Pd 7 0, Pd … 12 Pm and Pw 6 0.
In this case, the incumbent might attempt to threaten the entrant with the 
prospect of a price war in the event that entry occurs. However, if the entrant 
has perfect knowledge of the array of outcomes shown in Figure 12.5, the entrant 
will realise this threat is not credible. Suppose entry actually does occur. At that 
point, the incumbent is faced with the choice of either fighting, in which case it 
Figure 12.5  Sequential entry game

344	
|	 12    ■    Barriers to entry
suffers a loss of Pw, or accommodating, in which it earns a profit of Pd. In other 
words, if entry actually does take place, it makes no sense for the incumbent to 
carry out the threat to fight. Realizing this and attracted by the prospect of a 
profit of Pd, the entrant proceeds, and (Pd, Pd) is the final outcome.
Committed incumbent
Suppose the incumbent is committed rather than passive, and incurs sunk cost 
investment expenditure of C. In this case, if the entrant stays out, the incumbent’s 
monopoly profit is reduced as a result of having incurred the sunk cost expendi-
ture. As before, the entrant earns zero. In Figure 12.5, this outcome is denoted 
(Pm - C, 0). If entry does occur, as before, the incumbent can either fight a 
price war or accommodate and share the market. In the event of a price war, the 
outcome is (Pw, Pw). Crucially, the fact that the sunk cost expenditure needed to 
fight was incurred in advance does not affect the incumbent’s realised losses if 
the price war occurs. In the event that the firms share the market, the outcome is 
(Pd - C, Pd). It is assumed C 7 0, Pm 7 C 7 Pd and Pd - C 6 Pw.
In this case, the incumbent’s threat to launch a price war is credible. Suppose 
entry actually does occur. At that point, the incumbent is faced with the choice 
of either fighting, in which case it earns a loss of Pw, or accommodating, in which 
it earns an even greater loss of Pd - C. This time, if entry actually takes place, 
it makes sense for the incumbent to carry out the threat to fight. Faced with 
the prospect of suffering a loss of Pw if it proceeds, the entrant is deterred, and 
(Pm - C, 0) is the final outcome.
For a numerical illustration of this model, let Pm = 100, Pd = 20, Pw = -20 
and C = 60. Summarizing the logic of the previous paragraphs, if the incumbent 
is passive and entry takes place, the incumbent realises -20 by fighting and 20 
by accommodating. Therefore, post-entry, it is in the incumbent’s interests to 
accommodate. Faced with the prospect of realizing a profit, the entrant proceeds 
and the final outcome is (20, 20). If the incumbent is committed and entry takes 
place, the incumbent realises -20 by fighting and -40 by accommodating. There-
fore, post-entry, it is in the incumbent’s interests to fight. Faced with the prospect 
of realizing a loss, the entrant does not proceed and the final outcome is (40, 0).
Are there any circumstances in which the incumbent could remain passive 
(avoiding incurring the sunk cost expenditure), but still be successful in deterring 
entry? Dixit (1982) discusses the case in which the game described in Figure 12.5 
is repeated an infinite number of times. In this case, it might be in the interests of 
an incumbent who is passive in each period (as defined above) to fight whenever 
entry actually occurs, in order to establish a reputation for fighting. Observing 
that the incumbent always reacts by fighting, the entrant learns from experience 
that there is nothing to be gained by entering, and abstains from doing so. As 
shown in Section 7.6, however, this type of model unravels if there is a limit to 
the number of times the game is repeated. Reputation then becomes unimportant 
in the final period, when there is no incentive for the incumbent to fight. Know-
ing this, the entrant proceeds in the final period. But this implies reputation also 
becomes unimportant in the penultimate period, so the entrant proceeds then as 
well, and so on.

	
	
	
12.5  Potential entry and contestability	 |	
345
In the setting of a repeated entry game, another case in which a passive incum-
bent might succeed in deterring entry (without incurring sunk cost expenditure) 
occurs if there is imperfect knowledge, and the entrant does not know whether 
the incumbent is passive or committed. An incumbent who is actually passive 
might attempt to deceive the entrant into believing the incumbent is committed, 
by launching a price war in the event that entry takes place. After observing 
a fighting response in one period, and knowing that a committed incumbent 
always fights, the entrant’s subjective probability that the incumbent is com-
mitted increases, making it less likely that the entrant will decide to proceed in 
subsequent periods.
Alternatively, incumbent firms can attempt to deter potential entrants by 
announcing new versions of existing products well in advance of their actual 
launch. This deters potential entrants from developing similar products, as 
they may anticipate it will be unprofitable to do so. Haan (2003) cites a num-
ber of instances of so-called vaporware (excessively early announcement of 
a new version of a product) in the information technology industry. These 
include Microsoft’s Windows 2000 (promised in 1997 but not launched until 
2000) and Intel’s 64-bit Itanium chip (promised in early 2000 but not launched 
until 2001).
	
12.5	
Potential entry and contestability
The theory of contestable markets, originally developed by Baumol et al. (1982), 
considers an industry comprising a small number of incumbent firms or a single 
incumbent, whose market power is constrained by the threat of potential entry. 
Despite the fact that the incumbents are few in number, the entry threat forces 
them to keep their prices at a relatively low level, and constrains their ability to 
earn abnormal profits. Accordingly, even in highly concentrated industries, it is 
possible that incumbent firms can earn only a normal profit, because of threat-
ened competition from potential entrants. The presence of a large number of 
competing firms is not a necessary condition for industry price and output to be 
set at a level consistent with perfect competition; threatened competition from 
potential entrants may be sufficient to produce the same effect.
For a market to be perfectly contestable, there must be no significant entry 
or exit barriers. The theory of contestable markets therefore excludes structural 
entry barriers, entry-deterring strategies on the part of incumbent firms, and 
sunk costs. Baumol et al. introduce the idea of hit-and-run entry, based on the 
following assumptions:
■ A potential entrant can identify consumers who will purchase its output at or 
below the current market price.
■ The entrant has sufficient time to sell to these consumers before the incumbent 
has time to react.
■ At the prices quoted, the entrant earns sufficient revenue to cover its fixed and 
variable costs.

For unrecoverable investments, the length of time for which the asset is employed 
is important. If the asset can be used solely in the current period, the sunk costs 
are essentially a current fixed cost. The ability to recover all costs quickly is a 
defining characteristic of a contestable market, because if sunk costs cannot be 
recovered quickly, the incumbent has the opportunity to respond to the entrant’s 
presence strategically. By cutting price aggressively, the incumbent might be able 
to make the entrant’s continuing operation unprofitable. If hit-and-run entry 
is profitable, however, the entrant can move in and realise its profit before the 
incumbent has time to react.
Goolsbee and Syberson (2008) use data from the US Department of Trans-
portation to assess how established firms respond to the threat of entry of com-
petitors in the US Airline Industry. The evolution of Southwest Airlines’ route 
network is examined to identify routes where the probability of future entry rises 
abruptly. Incumbents on threatened routes cut prices significantly when threat-
ened by Southwest’s incursion into their markets.
Graham et al. (1983), Call and Keeler (1985), Moore (1986) and Morrison 
and Winston (1987) discuss some of the limitations of the theory of contestable 
markets.
■ The exclusion of sunk costs is generally unrealistic, as entry into most markets 
requires a significant amount of sunk cost investment. There are some possible 
exceptions (see below), but in most industries ‘sunk costs are found to weaken 
the support for “strong” interpretations of the contestable market hypothesis 
and thus yield a wide diversity of dynamic patterns of market performance’ 
(Coursey et al., 1984, p. 69).
■ By restricting the analysis to the short-run period within which the incum-
bent does not have sufficient time to respond, the reaction of the incumbent 
to attempted hit-and-run entry is excluded by assumption. Schwartz and 
­Reynolds (1983) argue that an analysis of entry should focus not on the exist-
ing price charged by incumbents before entry, but on the post-entry price. ‘The 
theory is naïve and static, with only one price. It ignores possible strategic 
price discrimination by the incumbent, which would decisively defeat entry 
while permitting excess profits’ (Shepherd, 1997, p. 220).
■ The assumption that the potential entrant faces no cost disadvantage relative 
to the incumbent is unrealistic. The latter may have acquired technical exper-
tise and built up goodwill in the past.
Commercial airline services and bus services on specific routes have been viewed 
as promising testing grounds for contestable markets theory. While the construc-
tion of an airport or a bus station represents a form of sunk cost investment 
(since these assets cannot be moved geographically), the purchase of a fleet of 
aircraft or buses by a service provider does not entail sunk costs. Such assets can 
easily be transferred from one route to another, making hit-and-run entry (on 
the part of service providers) a realistic possibility.
Several researchers have subjected contestable markets theory to empirical scru-
tiny using data on commercial airlines. Hurdle et al. (1989) test for contestability 
in 867 airline routes in 1985. Regression analysis is used to examine the effects of 
potential entry and industry concentration on the level of fares charged on any

347
specific route. Industry concentration, and not potential entry, is found to be the 
most important determinant of fares. Similarly, Strassmann (1990) tests for con-
testability using data on 92 US airline routes in 1980. If contestable markets theory 
is relevant, there should be no relationship between industry concentration and 
fares, or between entry barriers and fares. In a regression analysis, structural vari-
ables such as concentration and entry barriers are found to be the most significant 
determinants of fares. Therefore, both of these studies find that factors other than 
potential entry have the greatest influence on price. Neither study provides much 
support for the contestable markets theory. More recent evidence suggests estab-
lished airlines benefit from learning economies of scale and brand loyalty advan-
tages, which result in barriers to entry (Button and Stough, 2000; Johnson, 2003).
Accordingly, the practical relevance of contestable markets theory is ques-
tionable. Although the theory provides some insights concerning the possible 
behaviour of incumbents threatened by potential entry, early predictions that 
the notion of contestability might revolutionise the theory of the firm were wide 
of the mark.
As often happens, a bright idea has been exaggeratedly oversold by its 
enthusiastic authors. The ensuing debate trims the concept and claims to 
their proper niche, taking their place among all the other ideas. In this 
instance, contestability offers insights, but it does not affect the central 
role of market structure.
(Shepherd, 1997, p. 220)
	
12.6	
Entry and industry evolution
Most of the models of entry and exit that have been examined in this chapter are 
static, in the sense that they are based on direct comparisons between a pre-entry 
and a post-entry market equilibrium. Essentially, entry is modelled either as a 
once-and-for-all game, or an equilibrating mechanism whose principal economic 
function is the elimination of abnormal profit. This approach is criticised by 
Carlton (2005), on the grounds that the abnormal profits that are earned in the 
short run (before entry takes place) may be of greater practical relevance than 
the long-run (post-entry) equilibrium in which only normal profits are realised.
The usual discussions of barriers to entry typically focus on the long run 
and ignore adjustment costs. In the short run, the concept of an entry 
barrier is not meaningful (since, by assumption, entry is not possible). But 
why is the long run of interest? Only because economists often slip into 
ignoring dynamics and go back to our simple models of short and long run. 
But as a practical matter, the long run may be of no interest whatsoever. 
It may take so long to get there that the persistence of supracompetitive 
profits until then turns out to be the fact of practical importance, not that 
these excess profits are eliminated in some far-off future year.
(Carlton, 2005, p. 10)

|	 12    ■    Barriers to entry
In an attempt to address this kind of critique, and echoing some of the insights 
of Schumpeter (1928, 1942) and Geroski’s (1991a) positions entry within a 
dynamic model of competition; in this context, entry and exit play a central role 
in shaping the evolution of industry structure in the long run. Geroski discusses 
two types of entry:
■ Imitative entry, which occurs when the entrant can earn a profit by copying 
an incumbent’s product or method of production. Imitative entry is primarily 
an equilibrating force, in the sense that it helps propel the industry towards an 
equilibrium whose location and characteristics remain fundamentally unal-
tered. The incumbent’s abnormal profit is reduced or eliminated as part of the 
adjustment process.
■ Innovative entry, which occurs when an entrant introduces a product with 
new characteristics, or finds a new method of producing an existing prod-
uct more cheaply than before. Innovative entry is primarily a disruptive or 
disequilibrating force, in the sense that it changes the location and charac-
teristics of an existing market equilibrium, and propels the industry in a new 
direction.
Innovative entry in particular makes a crucial contribution to the formation and 
growth of new industries and the decline of old ones. Entry by more innovative or 
more efficient outsiders encourages incumbent firms to improve or replace their 
existing product lines, or reduce their costs. Competition will eventually force 
the withdrawal of incumbents that fail to innovate.
Entry can also play a more creative role in markets, serving as a vehicle 
for the introduction and diffusion of innovations which embody new 
products or processes that fundamentally alter conditions of supply 
and demand. Further, the mere threat of entry of this type may induce 
incumbents to generate new innovations or to adopt existing ones 
more rapidly.
(Geroski, 1991a, p. 210)
The turnover of firms due to entry and exit is likely to be higher in technology-
oriented industries such as electronics and pharmaceuticals, in which non-price 
competition tends to prevail. In these industries, variation in firm-level profit 
rates may be extreme, due to the uncertainties associated with the outcomes of 
innovation. Successful entrants may benefit significantly from first-mover advan-
tages, which arise in several ways:
The first springs from its headstart in travelling down learning functions 
and exploiting economies of scale . . . The second comes from the 
fact that first movers have an opportunity to monopolize scarce 
inputs . . . Third, the purchase decisions of early consumers are effectively 
investments in learning about the product – what it does and how to use 
it – and when consumers have made such investments and are content 
with how the product works for them, they will be reluctant to try

alternatives . . . . Fourth and finally, first movers who bring a winning 
product to the market often enjoy an enhanced brand identity and status.
(Geroski, 2003, pp. 194–5)
For example, Berger and Dick (2007) examine first-mover advantages for 
entrants into localised US banking markets during the period 1972–2002. The 
earlier a bank entered, the larger was its eventual market share relative to other 
banks. Long-lasting first-mover advantages were secured by building capacity 
through investment in branch networks.
	
12.7	
Empirical evidence on entry
There is a substantial empirical literature on the determinants of entry in manu-
facturing (Siegfried and Evans, 1994). Typical findings are that rates of entry 
are relatively high in profitable industries and fast-growing industries (Baldwin 
and Gorecki, 1987; Geroski, 1991a,b). Rates of entry are relatively low in indus-
tries where incumbents have absolute cost advantages over potential entrants, 
or where entrants’ capital requirements are substantial (Orr, 1974). However, 
evidence concerning the relationship between rates of entry and factors such as 
scale economies, excess capacity and incumbents’ pricing practices (such as limit 
and predatory pricing) is both limited and inconclusive.
As discussed above, the size of barriers to exit depends on the level of sunk 
costs. A complete absence of sunk costs is unusual, given that many assets are 
specific, and cannot easily be transferred to other uses (Harbord and Hoehn, 
1994). There is some manufacturing evidence to suggest that exit is higher when 
profits are low and sunk costs are insignificant (Dunne et al., 1988), although 
Schary (1991) finds no relationship between profitability and exit. Other charac-
teristics of the firm’s financial and operational structure may have more influence 
on the decision to exit. Deutsch (1984) suggests conflicts of objectives between 
owners and managers may make it difficult to achieve a decision to exit. It is 
also possible that there is a direct association between entry and exit rates, if 
there is a tendency for entrants to displace some incumbents. However, using US 
manufacturing data for the period 1963–82, Dunne et al. (1988) find a negative 
correlation between annual entry and exit rates.
In a well-known study, Orr (1974) examines the determinants of entry into 71 
Canadian manufacturing industries for the period 1963–7. The regression model 
is as follows:
E = b1 + b2pp + b3Q + b4X + b5K + b6A + b7R + b8r + b9C + b10S
E is the average number of entrants in the sample period; pp is the average indus-
try profit rate; Q is past industry growth; X is the ratio of MES to industry 
sales (representing an economies of scale barrier to entry); K is an estimated 
fixed capital entry requirement; A is advertising intensity (ratio of advertising 

350	
|	 12    ■    Barriers to entry
expenditure to industry sales); R is research and development intensity (ratio 
of research and development expenditure to industry sales); r is the standard 
deviation of industry profit rates (representing business risk); C is the level of 
industry concentration (measured on an ordinal scale: low = 1, high = 5); and 
S is total industry sales.
Orr finds a positive relationship between each of pp, Q and S, and E. There-
fore, high values of profitability, growth and industry size are all associated with 
high rates of entry. Orr finds a negative relationship between each of X, K, A, R, 
r and C, and E. This constitutes evidence of entry barriers resulting from econo-
mies of scale, capital requirements, high advertising or research and development 
intensities, business risk and high industry concentration.
Smiley (1988) and Bunch and Smiley (1992) examine entry-deterring strate-
gies adopted by incumbents in new and established product markets. A total 
of 293 completed questionnaires were obtained from product managers, brand 
managers, directors of product management, division managers and marketing 
managers. Respondents were asked to identify the types of entry-deterring strat-
egy they employed, and how frequently. In new product markets, entry-deterring 
strategies include:
■ Charging low prices and spending heavily on advertising and promotion.
■ Building excess capacity as a signal that incumbents are able to meet future 
demand.
■ Pre-emptive patenting to prevent entrants from producing identical or similar 
products.
■ Using the media to signal that entry would provoke retaliation.
■ Engaging in limit pricing to make entry unprofitable.
Additional strategies used in established product markets include:
■ Brand proliferation, intended to occupy product space, so that entrants cannot 
establish their own differentiated products or brands.
■ Masking the profitability of any single product line through the use of appro-
priate reporting practices in company accounts.
For new products, advertising (78 per cent of firms) and pre-emptive patenting 
(71 per cent) were the most widely used entry-deterring strategies. Limit pricing 
was rarely used. There was little systematic difference between manufacturing 
and services, except that manufacturers were significantly more likely to use 
pre-emptive patenting.
For existing products, brand proliferation (79 per cent of firms), advertising 
(79 per cent) and masking the profitability of individual product lines (78 per 
cent) were the most widely used entry-deterring strategies. Building excess capac-
ity was rarely used. Manufacturers were more likely than service firms to mask 
the profitability of product lines and to use pre-emptive patenting. Service firms

typically concentrated on advertising and promotions and product differentia-
tion to create brand loyalties.
Khemani and Shapiro (1990) argue that entry is expected if an incumbent’s 
current profit, denoted p0, exceeds the expected long-run profit, denoted pnp. Exit 
is expected if current profit is below the expected long-run profit. Expressions 
for entry and exit are as follows:
 ENT = a1 + g1(p0 - pnp)R + b1 loge(N) + «1
 EXT = a2 + g2(p0 - pnp)R + b2 loge(N) + «2
ENT and EXT are the logarithms of the numbers of firms entering or exiting an 
industry; N is the number of firms in the industry; and R is an indicator variable 
for positive or negative values of (p0 - pnp). Observed patterns of entry and exit 
are found to correspond to this model specification.
Geroski (1991b) examines the extent of entry by domestic and foreign firms in 
95 UK manufacturing industries for the period 1983–4. The number of entrants 
per industry was similar in both years, but the market share of entrants was 
relatively small (the average across industries was between 7 per cent and 8 per 
cent of total industry sales). On average, domestic entrants succeeded in captur-
ing a higher market share than foreign entrants. Exit rates were relatively stable 
over time, but entry and exit rates were positively correlated, suggesting a dis-
placement effect. High profitability and large industry size are reported to have 
encouraged entry, but (surprisingly) there was a negative relationship between 
industry growth and entry. The significance of these effects is greater for domes-
tic entrants than for foreign entrants.
Sleuwaegen and Dehandschutter (1991) examine the determinants of entry 
for 109 Belgian manufacturing industries for the period 1980–4. Schwalbach 
(1991) does the same for 183 German manufacturing industries for the period 
1983–5. In these studies, entry rates are positively related to expected profits and 
industry growth, but negatively related to barriers in the form of initial capital 
requirements, and product differentiation advantages accruing to incumbents. 
For the early 1980s, Cable and Schwalbach (1991) report entry and exit rates for 
Belgium, Canada, Germany, Korea, Norway, Portugal, UK and US averaging 
at around 6.5 per cent of the relevant population of firms. Entry and exit rates 
also tend to be positively correlated with each other.
Rudholm (2001) assesses the determinants of entry to 22 Swedish pharmaceu-
tical markets between 1972 and 1996. Entry is higher in markets where incumbent 
firms earn high profits. Entry is lower in markets where incumbent firms enjoy 
long periods of patent protection. Overall, entrants tend to enjoy a high prob-
ability of survival.
Roberts and Thompson (2003) examine the population of Polish manufac-
turing firms drawn from 152 three-digit industries over the period 1991–3 to 
assess the determinants of entry and exit. Concentration, profitability, capital 
requirements and state ownership all tend to reduce entry. There is a positive 

352	
|	 12    ■    Barriers to entry
association between the rate of entry and industry size, and the rate of previous 
exit of incumbent firms. Exit is less likely when concentration, industry growth 
and profitability are high, but more likely in large industries or in those with a 
past history of high entry and exit.
Disney et al. (2003) examine the Annual Business Inquiry Respondents Data-
base (ARD) for evidence on entry, exit and survival for UK manufacturing estab-
lishments over the period 1986–91. The results suggest small entrants are more 
likely to fail than their larger counterparts, but this danger recedes if fast growth 
is achieved. The rate of exit is higher for single establishments than for those that 
form part of a larger group.
Using data on the market for tourist accommodation in Texas, Conlin and 
Kadiyali (2006) examine whether firms use excess capacity to deter entry. There 
is evidence of higher investment in capacity relative to demand in markets with 
higher concentration, and by firms with a larger market share. These findings are 
consistent with the hypothesis that firms with the most incentive to deter entry 
do so through the creation of spare capacity.
Jeon and Miller (2007) examine the evolution of the population of US banks 
over the period 1978–2004. Entry of small banks occurred frequently, but only a 
small minority of these banks survived. Furthermore, exit of established banks 
(typically by merger) exceeded entry.
McGowan (2014) investigates whether the removal of entry barriers affects 
productivity. As a laboratory he uses the collapse of a sugar cartel in the US 
in the mid-1970s, which resulted in increased competition in the sugar beet 
industry. Following the demise of the cartel, the productivity of sugar beet 
producers improved markedly relative to a control group of other agricultural 
producers.
Geroski (1995) presents a series of stylized facts on entry, based on accumu-
lated past theoretical and empirical research:
■ Rates of entry by new firms are often high (relative to the numbers of incum-
bents), but new entrants rarely capture large market shares.
■ Entry often leads to the displacement and exit of some incumbent firms.
■ Small entrants are less likely to survive than large entrants.
■ Entry by new firms is more common than entry by existing firms by means of 
diversification. However, diversified entrants are more likely to succeed.
■ Entry rates tend to be high during the early stages of an industry’s develop-
ment, when consumer preferences are unsettled, and core brands, products 
and processes are not yet established.
■ Entry by new firms leads to increased competition, stimulates innovation and 
encourages incumbents to make efficiency savings.
■ Incumbents tend to prefer non-price strategies to price strategies in order to 
deter entry.
■ Large or mature entrants are more likely to succeed than small or young 
entrants.

Technology will hurt the banks, not kill them
FT
Technology has its eyes on banking. Apple is expected this week to launch Apple Pay, 
its touchless payment system for iPhones; venture capital funds are pouring money into 
‘fintech’ start-ups; and Marc Andreessen, the technology entrepreneur, talks of ‘a chance 
to rebuild the system. Financial transactions are just numbers; it’s just information’. 
Mr Andreessen, a partner of the venture fund Andreessen Horowitz, added in an inter-
view with Bloomberg Markets magazine last week: ‘To me, it’s all about unbundling the 
banks. There are regulatory arbitrage opportunities every step of the way. If the regula-
tors are going to regulate banks, then you’ll have non-bank entities that spring up to do 
the things that banks can’t do.’
This raises plenty of questions, not least about the last time non-bank entities (also 
known as the shadow banking system) took over financial intermediation below the 
radar, stoking the 2008 financial crisis. But my question is: does Silicon Valley really 
want to blow up retail banking and create an entirely new financial system, or would it 
prefer to ride on the existing one?
Aside from Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related companies, in which Andreessen 
Horowitz invests, the evidence points firmly to the latter. Apple Pay sounds radical but 
is essentially a way to turn a phone into a contactless credit or debit card, with the sup-
port of US banks. Other start-ups are nibbling away at banks’ more profitable services, 
not competing head-on.
There is no doubt that the infrastructure of retail banks is antiquated, and is built in a 
way that invites competition from peer-to-peer networks. Nor is there a doubt that banks 
make themselves vulnerable by how they price – offering core deposit services cheaply 
or free while squeezing customers on ancillary products such as overdrafts and currency 
exchange. But what is the best way to compete with an industry that makes little from a 
capital-intensive, regulated service with formidable barriers to entry, and a lot from less 
protected add-ons? The question answers itself, which is why Silicon Valley focuses on 
payments while talking about disrupting lending.
Consider Occupy Wall Street, the protest movement that rightly focused attention on 
the unfairness of the banking industry’s entrenchment and reliance on public finance. In 
the wake of the protests, a group of Occupiers tried and failed to set up a national credit 
union or bank in the US, and to launch a low-cost, prepaid debit card. ‘It became clear 
that the immense amount of regulation that any new entity faces is a massive barrier to 
entry which protects the existing banks,’ says Carne Ross, a diplomat and member of the 
Occupy group. US laws made it impossible to establish a national credit union open to 
any customer.
Mr Andreessen believes non-banks will manage to work around regulations. There may 
be something to this – it is striking that my energy supplier offers a higher rate of interest 
on deposits than my bank – but neither regulators nor the public will tolerate shadow 
retail banking for long if something goes wrong, as it tends to do.

354	
|	 12    ■    Barriers to entry
The biggest barrier to competition is that the core business of taking in deposits and 
keeping them safe is not very profitable in a low-interest world. Deloitte, the consultancy, 
estimates that UK banks make a 1.1 per cent loss on current account deposits at existing 
interest rates because they earn less on the cash while still bearing the costs of technology 
and branches.
A start-up bank that has no branches and spends less on patching up legacy software 
might do this more efficiently – and good luck to those that penetrate the regulatory 
thicket and try. But it is much less risky to attach a new service to the existing banking 
infrastructure, and it absorbs less capital. This is what most start-ups – and companies 
such as Apple and Google – are doing. They are not lending money, except through a 
banking partner. They offer services on top of the banking network – PhotoPay and 
WorldRemit, for example – or aggregate financial products provided by others, for exam-
ple, Moneysupermarket.
Technology may eventually change the infrastructure of banking but it will not happen 
soon. Sean Park, founder of the advisory firm Anthemis, estimates that this ‘is a long-term 
threat that will play out over decades, not months or years’. I will not hold my breath for 
Bitcoin to replace the central ledger of bank settlement, which dates from 17th-century 
goldsmith banks. Until then, Silicon Valley will compete at the edges, where banks make 
their best profits. It is not a bad compromise for them, or for customers.

Global players’ union urges football overhaul
FT
The union representing professional footballers has turned to Brussels to overhaul the 
way the sport is run, arguing that the transfer window system hinders competition and 
cements the dominance of the game’s richest clubs. FIFPro, which represents more than 
65,000 professional footballers worldwide, said on Friday that it had filed a formal com-
plaint against Fifa, world football’s governing body, which is already reeling from a string 
of arrests in a bribery investigation launched by US authorities.
The union’s complaint argues that only the wealthiest clubs have the financial fire-
power to pay the huge transfer fees required to sign the best players and to prevail in 
often frenzied negotiations within restricted transfer windows. By lodging the complaint, 
FIFPro is accusing the national governing bodies that operate through Fifa of being anti-
competitive. English Premier League clubs alone spent £460m in the recent window, with 
Manchester United paying £36m for Anthony Martial, a relatively untested 19-year-old 
French striker.

	
	
	
12.8  Summary	 |	
355
The European Commission confirmed it had received the complaint and would assess 
whether to issue charges. Privately, an EU official said Brussels had been exploring 
whether there were grounds for action against Fifa for several months. FIFPro’s com-
plaint was filed after talks with commission officials. FIFPro said it had sought to illus-
trate to the commission how a distorted market for players had ramifications for the 
wider economy.
Jonas Baer-Hoffman, FIFPro policy director, said that by keeping some teams weak, 
the transfer system affected ‘clubs’ ability to be successful in other markets including 
broadcasting rights, merchandise and sponsorship’. He added that ‘transfer fees represent 
a very, very high barrier to entry for clubs who are outside the dominant groupings’.
A study for the commission in 2013 found the total value of transfers in the EU swelled 
to €3bn in the 2010–2011 season from €403m in 1994–1995. Transfer fees represent a very, 
very high barrier to entry for clubs who are outside the dominant groupings. The transfer 
window system is outlined in a 2001 agreement between the commission, Fifa and Uefa, 
European football’s governing body. FIFPro argues this was based on the understanding 
there would be a ‘solidarity mechanism’ to ensure money trickled down to smaller clubs. 
But it also says this has not happened, meaning it is time to change the entire system.
As its complaint against Fifa has been levelled as an ‘association of undertakings’, by 
extension it relates to the national associations that make up Fifa and their constituent 
clubs. A formal complaint escalates a competition issue to a level where the commission 
is expected to draw a conclusion on whether it believes the market is being distorted. Big 
fines are possible in competition cases but FIFPro is mainly targeting an overhaul of 
football’s commercial structure through a revision of the 2001 agreement.

Summary
There are some barriers to entry over which neither incumbents nor entrants have 
direct control. Economies of scale can act as an entry barrier in two ways. First, 
there is an entry barrier if the minimum efficient scale (MES) of production is 
large relative to the total size of the market. Second, economies of scale can act 
as an entry barrier when average costs associated with a production level below 
the MES are substantially greater than average costs at the MES. Economies of 
scale present the potential entrant with a dilemma. Either the entrant accepts the 
risks associated with large-scale entry to avoid the average cost penalty, or the 
entrant enters at a smaller scale and absorbs the average cost penalty.
An incumbent has an absolute cost advantage over an entrant if the long-
run average cost function of the entrant lies above that of the incumbent, and 
the entrant therefore faces a higher average cost at every level of output. An 
absolute cost advantage might arise in several ways. The incumbent might have 
access to a superior production process, hold patents or be party to trade secrets. 

356	
|	 12    ■    Barriers to entry
The incumbent might have exclusive ownership or control over factor inputs, or 
access to cheaper sources of finance. Finally, the entrant might incur costs in the 
form of expensive advertising or marketing campaigns, in an effort to create a 
reputation or establish its own brand identities and brand loyalties.
Other barriers to entry include: product differentiation in the form of customer 
loyalties to established brands and reputations of incumbents; switching costs; 
network externalities; legal barriers to entry; and geographic barriers, which cre-
ate difficulties for foreign firms attempting to trade in the domestic market.
Entry-deterring strategies are barriers to entry created or raised by incumbents 
through their own actions. The extent to which it is possible for incumbents to 
adopt entry-deterring strategies is likely to depend on the degree of market power 
in the hands of the incumbent. Under a limit-pricing strategy, the incumbent 
seeks to prevent entry by charging the highest price possible without inviting 
entry. To do so, it exploits either an absolute cost advantage or an economies of 
scale advantage, in order to set a price such that if entry takes place, the entrant 
is unable to earn a normal profit.
A strategy of predatory pricing on the part of an incumbent involves cutting 
price in an attempt to force an entrant to withdraw from the market. When the 
entrant has withdrawn, the incumbent raises its price. The incumbent sacrifices 
profit and perhaps sustains losses in the short run to protect its market power 
in the long run. An incumbent faced with threatened entry might attempt to 
ward off the threat by convincing the potential entrant that it would implement 
a predatory pricing policy in the event that entry takes place.
For many product types, a certain amount of product differentiation is quite 
natural, in view of basic product characteristics and consumer tastes. In some 
imperfectly competitive markets, however, incumbent firms may employ advertis-
ing or other types of marketing campaign to create or strengthen brand loyalties 
beyond what is natural to the market, raising the initial costs entrants will incur 
in order to establish a presence. In this case, product differentiation becomes a 
strategic entry barrier. Finally, it is suggested that incumbents may attempt to 
deter entry by deliberately increasing their sunk cost investment expenditure 
before entry takes place. The incumbent signals a commitment to fight entry by 
engaging the entrant in a price war.
Contestable markets theory considers an industry comprising a small number 
of incumbent firms or a single incumbent, whose market power is constrained 
by the threat of potential entry. Even though the incumbents are few in number, 
and the industry appears to be highly concentrated, the threat of hit-and-run 
entry keeps prices close to the competitive level. A large number of competing 
firms is not a necessary condition for industry price and output to be set at the 
perfectly competitive level. Threatened competition from potential entrants may 
be sufficient to produce the same effect. Contestable markets theory breaks the 
direct link between the number and size distribution of sellers and the amount of 
discretion exercised by incumbents in determining their own prices.
A more dynamic view of entry and market evolution over the long run regards 
entry as not an equilibrating mechanism, as assumed in the neoclassical theories 
of perfect and monopolistic competition, but rather as a disequilibrating force 
which, by changing and disrupting established market equilibria, plays a central 
role in shaping the evolution of industry structure in the long run.

Most of the empirical evidence on the determinants of entry in manufacturing 
confirms that high industry profitability and growth are effective stimulants to 
entry. There is also some empirical evidence that, in accordance with the theory, 
entry barriers resulting from economies of scale, heavy capital requirements, 
high advertising or research and development intensities, high levels of business 
risk and high levels of industry concentration are effective in slowing the rate at 
which entry takes place.

Introduction
This chapter discusses empirical research in industrial organization that has 
examined the links between market structure and the conduct and performance 
of firms and industries. The SCP (structure–conduct–performance) paradigm 
(which was introduced in Chapter 1) represents a natural starting point for 
empirical research in this area. However, the SCP approach has been subject to 

360	
|	 13    ■    Market structure, firm strategy and performance
intense criticism, and later empirical research in both industrial organization and 
strategic management has sought to shift the focus of attention away from indus-
try structure and towards conduct or strategic decision-making at firm level.
This chapter begins in Section  13.2 by reviewing some early empirical 
research based on the SCP paradigm, which sought to identify the impact of 
structural industry-level variables such as concentration, economies of scale, 
and entry and exit conditions on firm performance, usually measured by profit-
ability indicators. A powerful critique of the SCP paradigm was developed in 
the 1970s by the Chicago school, which suggested that a positive association 
between concentration and profitability might reflect not an abuse of market 
power, but an association between firm size and efficiency: the most efficient 
firms are the most profitable, and also tend to grow and achieve large mar-
ket shares. This suggests the analysis of performance should be based less on 
industry structure, and more on the conduct and strategic decision-making of 
the individual firm.
The strategic management literature on strategic groups is reviewed in 
­Section 13.3. A strategic group is a group of firms whose conduct is similar, and 
which tend to view other members of the same group as their main competitors. 
The members of a strategic group recognise their interdependence, and this rec-
ognition conditions their behaviour. Mobility barriers impede the rate at which 
non-members can join a strategic group. In some respects, strategic groups the-
ory represents a middle way between the competing industry- and firm-oriented 
approaches of the industrial organisation literature.
Section 13.4 reviews variance decomposition studies of firm-level profitabil-
ity data, which involve the decomposition of the variation in profit rates into 
components specific to the industry, the parent corporation and the line of busi-
ness. This approach is capable of providing further insights into the debate as 
to whether the industry or the firm is the most appropriate unit of observation 
in industrial organization. Section 13.5 reviews a body of research known as the 
new empirical industrial organization, which attempts to draw inferences about 
market structure and competitive conditions from direct observation of conduct 
at firm level. Finally, Section 13.6 examines the persistence of profit literature, 
which analyses the process of adjustment towards equilibrium by observing pat-
terns of persistence and convergence in firm-level profit rate data. In this litera-
ture, the degree of persistence of profit is interpreted as another indicator of the 
nature of competitive conditions.
	
13.2	
Empirical tests of the SCP paradigm
The performance of firms is one of the central research themes in industrial 
organization. There is a substantial body of empirical research that seeks to 
explain variations in performance between firms, most commonly measured by 
profitability. Early research within the SCP tradition developed and extended 
frameworks to analyse competitive conditions in industries. According to much 
of the earliest empirical literature, based on the SCP paradigm, industry-level

variables such as concentration, economies of scale, and entry and exit condi-
tions are the main determinants of firm performance. Caves provides a useful 
summary of this early research.
Most research in this line proceeded without any formal theoretical 
model of imperfect competition. It rested on the proposition, following 
from nearly every model of oligopoly, that the fewer the sellers 
in a market, the higher is the equilibrium price and the smaller is 
industry output. For this reason, and because measures of fewness or 
concentration were not wholly exogenous to patterns of conduct and 
levels of performance, no unbiased estimates of theoretically founded 
parameters resulted. What did emerge, however, was a large body of 
stylized facts – relationships found with some regularity in numerous 
cross-sections of markets.
(Caves, 2007, p. 2)
The literature has subsequently been criticised for providing (at best) limited 
explanation as to why profitability varies between firms. For example, the Chi-
cago school argues that market power deriving from monopolization is only tem-
porary, except perhaps in the case of monopolies that are created and maintained 
by government. A positive association between concentration and profitability 
may reflect a positive association between productive efficiency and firm size: 
the most efficient firms earn the highest rates of profit, and their success enables 
them to grow and achieve a relatively large market share. Consequently, the rela-
tionship between market structure and profitability has nothing to do with the 
exploitation of market power by large firms; instead, it is due to the association 
between efficiency, profitability and firm size. If differences in efficiency between 
firms are important in determining the performance of individual firms, the firm 
rather than the industry is the most appropriate unit of analysis. This view, which 
is in contrast to the SCP paradigm, has been termed revisionist by Schmalensee 
(1985) and Amato and Wilder (1990).
The debate between the revisionist and traditional schools can be 
summarized in terms of their differences regarding the appropriate 
unit of observation in industrial economics. The revisionist view is a 
story of industries consisting of both successful and unsuccessful firms, 
implying that there are important inter-firm differences in profitability. 
The traditional view focuses on industry effects which are assumed to 
be measured by concentration. The revisionist view thus focuses on the 
firm and firm-level efficiencies, while the traditional view focuses on the 
market and industry-specific sources of market power.
(Amato and Wilder, 1990, p. 93)
These opposing views have motivated an extensive empirical debate. Many of the 
earlier studies suggest concentration and other industry-level variables are impor-
tant in determining performance, the collusion hypothesis. Many later studies 

362	
|	 13    ■    Market structure, firm strategy and performance
emphasise the importance of efficiency differences between firms, the efficiency 
hypothesis. Naturally, for all of these studies the measurement of profitability is 
an important methodological issue. This topic is examined in Box 13.1.
Box 13.1
Measurement of profitability
Profitability is perhaps the most relevant and certainly the most widely used performance 
measure in empirical studies based both on the SCP paradigm and on most of the other 
empirical methodologies that are reviewed in Chapter 13. However, the measurement 
of profitability is not always a straightforward task. For example, measures of profit-
ability based either on company accounts data or on stock market data do not always 
correspond precisely or even closely to the theoretical concepts used by economists in the 
neoclassical theory of the firm, such as normal profit or abnormal profit.
Measure 1: Tobin’s q
Tobin’s q is the ratio of the firm’s stock market value to the replacement cost of its capital:
q =
Mc + Mp + Md
Ar
Mc and Mp are the market values of the firm’s ordinary and preference share capital, 
respectively; Md is the firm’s outstanding loan capital; and Ar is the firm’s total assets 
valued at replacement cost.
q = 1 implies the market value of the firm is equal to the book value of the assets 
owned by the firm, while q ≠1 indicates the market value diverges from the book value 
of the firm’s assets.
If q 7 1, the firm’s market value exceeds its book value. This situation exists when a 
firm has resources or advantages that contribute positively to its market value (in other 
words, from which it can expect to earn a positive return in the future), but which do 
not feature among the assets valued in the firm’s balance sheet. Such advantages might 
stem from intangible assets that rival firms are unable to replicate, or from the exercise 
of market power that enables the firm to earn a return in excess of the normal profit the 
assets deployed by the firm would ordinarily be expected to yield.
If q 6 1, the firm’s market value is below its book value. This situation exists when the 
firm fails to earn a return equivalent to the normal profit the firm’s assets would ordinar-
ily be expected to yield. This might be due to lazy or incompetent management. A firm 
whose stock market value is significantly lower than its book value is usually considered 
to be vulnerable to being taken over. Outside investors (other than the firm’s current 
shareholders) might believe they can make more profitable use of the firm’s assets, and 
might therefore bid for the firm in the hope of acquiring it at a price from which they can 
subsequently realise a capital gain by increasing the firm’s profitability.

A stock market–based profitability measure might be attractive for several reasons. 
Under assumptions of capital market efficiency, a firm’s current market value should 
reflect all currently known information about its future profitability. An allowance for 
the level of risk is automatically incorporated, eliminating distortions arising from the 
fact that company accounts–based measures of returns or profits are not risk-adjusted. 
Stock market valuations should be unaffected by distortions to company accounts aris-
ing from the treatment of items such as tax and depreciation. One obvious limitation, 
however, is that stock market valuation data are, by definition, only available for listed 
firms. Furthermore, the firm’s stock market valuation depends on expected future profit-
ability. This tends to be subjective, and likely to fluctuate with investor sentiment, making 
stock market performance measures rather volatile. Finally, the denominator of Tobin’s 
q is based on company accounts data, and is therefore subject to all of the limitations 
associated with the use of such data. In particular, the replacement cost of assets can be 
difficult to assess or measure.
Measure 2: price–cost margin
The price–cost margin is the ratio of profit to sales revenue:
PCM = TR - TC
TR
= P * Q - AC * Q
P * Q
= P - AC
P
where TR = total revenue, TC = total cost, P = price, Q = quantity and AC = average 
cost. If AC is constant so AC = MC, PCM is equivalent to the Lerner index, 
L = (P - MC)/P (see Section 3.4). In perfectly competitive equilibrium, PCM = 0. If the 
firm exercises some market power, and can elevate price above average cost, PCM 7 0.
The price–cost margin is not an accurate proxy for the Lerner index in the absence of 
constant returns to scale. Consequently, the greater the positive or negative difference 
between average cost and marginal cost, the greater the tendency for the price–cost mar-
gin to overstate or understate the Lerner index.
Measure 3: accounting rate of profit
An accounting rate of profit (ARP) is usually defined as the ratio of profit (before or 
after tax) to capital, equity or sales. Discretionary expenditure, depreciation, debt, tax, 
inflation and mergers can all cause difficulties for the calculation and interpretation of 
company accounts–based profitability measures.
Bain (1951) tests the relationship between concentration and profitability, 
using data for 42 US manufacturing industries between 1936 and 1940. Profit-
ability is measured using return on equity, and concentration is measured using 
the eight-firm concentration ratio CR8. Average profitability is significantly 
higher in industries with CR8 above 70 per cent (at 9.2 per cent) than in those

Notes:
CR4 is the four-firm concentration ratio measured on industry sales in 1963.
R1 is average rate of return for firms with assets 6 US$500,000.
R2 is average rate of return for firms with US$500,000 6 assets 6 US$5 million.
R3 is average rate of return for firms with US$5 million 6 assets 6 US$50 million.
R4 is average rate of return for firms with assets 7 US$50 million.

with CR8 below 70 per cent (at 7.7 per cent). These results are interpreted as 
indicating that exploitation of market power leads to enhanced profitability. 
Numerous other studies from the 1950s and 1960s report similar results. This 
literature, reviewed by Weiss (1974, 1989), was influential in shaping the direction 
of competition policy in many countries.
In a representative study based on the SCP paradigm from the 1960s, Collins 
and Preston (1966) examine the relationship between concentration (measured 
using CR4) and a price–cost margin profitability measure, for a sample compris-
ing 32 US four-digit (SIC) food manufacturing industries observed in 1958. There 
is evidence of a quadratic relationship between concentration and profit. There 
are no systematic increases in the price–cost margins accompanying increases in 
concentration when concentration is low (CR4 6 0.3). For 0.3 6 CR4 6 0.5, 
concentration and profitability appear to increase in similar proportions. For 
CR4 7 0.5, profitability increased at an accelerating rate.
Demsetz (1973, 1974) points out that if the positive relationship between 
market concentration and profitability reflects the exercise of market power, 
then it should affect all firms equally. However, if the profitability of large 
firms in concentrated industries is higher than the profitability of small firms 
in concentrated industries, then the correlation between profitability and 
­concentration is due to a relationship between efficiency and profitability. 
­Demsetz’s ­empirical results, based on 1963 US Internal Revenue Service data 
for 95 manufacturing industries, are summarised in Table 13.1. The profitability 
of firms in size classes R1, R2 and R3 does not appear to be related to concen-
tration. However, in the largest size class, R4, profitability and concentration

are positively related, lending support to the efficiency hypothesis. Demsetz 
argues against Bain’s view that highly concentrated industries are uncompeti-
tive. An implication is that specific government policies intended to promote 
competition directed at highly concentrated industries are not required. Over-
all, the empirical evidence does not adjudicate definitively between the collu-
sion and efficiency hypotheses (Weiss, 1989). Below, a representative selection 
of ­studies is reviewed.
Using US data, Ravenscraft (1983) finds price–cost margins are positively 
associated with lines-of-business market shares, but negatively associated with 
seller concentration. However, Ravenscraft’s regression only explains about 20 
per cent of the variation in profits. Scott and Pascoe (1986) test for the impor-
tance of firm and industry effects by allowing for firm- and industry-specific 
coefficients on variables such as concentration, market growth and market 
share. Both firm and industry effects are important determinants of profitability, 
although much of the variation in profitability remains unexplained.
Smirlock et al. (1984) use Tobin’s q (see Box 13.1) to test the collusion and effi-
ciency hypotheses, using US data. The independent variables are market share, 
CR4, indicators of the height of entry barriers (classed as high, medium or low), 
and the growth of the firm’s market share. If the efficiency hypothesis is valid, 
there should be a positive relationship between profitability and market share, 
and no relationship between profitability and concentration. Conversely, if the 
collusion hypothesis is valid, there should be a positive relationship between 
profitability and concentration, and no relationship between profitability and 
market share. The results support the efficiency hypothesis. There is a positive 
relationship between profitability and growth, perhaps because growth influ-
ences investors’ expectations of future profitability reflected in the firm’s valua-
tion ratio; but entry barriers appear unrelated to profitability.
Clarke et al. (1984) test the validity of the collusion and efficiency hypotheses, 
using UK data. Little difference is found between the average profitability of 
large and small firms within highly concentrated industries. This finding lends 
support to the collusion hypothesis. Eckard (1995) uses US data for five cohorts 
of firms (based on size) to examine the relationship between changes in profit-
ability (measured by the price–cost margin) and changes in market share. Under 
the efficiency hypothesis, there should be a positive relationship between changes 
in profitability and changes in market share, assuming the more efficient firms 
are more profitable and grow faster. The empirical results are consistent with 
this hypothesis.
The collusion and efficiency hypotheses have been investigated extensively 
in the banking literature. Berger (1995) compares the validity of two variants of 
the collusion hypothesis and two variants of the efficiency hypothesis, using US 
banking data. According to the collusion hypothesis, banks exploit their market 
power either by charging higher prices for differentiated banking products, or 
by colluding in order to raise prices. Large banks produce at lower average cost 
either by becoming more efficient through superior management or by being 
innovative; or by realizing economies of scale. In both cases, according to the effi-
ciency hypothesis, the most efficient banks are likely to have the largest market 
shares. In the empirical model, the dependent variable, profitability, is measured 

366	
|	 13    ■    Market structure, firm strategy and performance
using both return on assets and return on equity. Independent variables include: 
concentration, measured using the HH index (see Section 10.4); measures of 
the effect on average cost of economies of scale; and measures of the efficiency 
implications of managerial talent. The efficiency measures were significant deter-
minants of profitability, but there was little association between economies of 
scale and profitability. Profitability was positively related to market share, but 
not to concentration. These results suggest product differentiation contributes 
positively to profitability, but collusion does not do so.
Berger and Hannan (1998) examine the relationship between operational effi-
ciency and concentration. According to the quiet life hypothesis, market power 
may enable banks to operate without achieving full efficiency in production; in 
other words, there may be x-inefficiency. The relationship between concentra-
tion and efficiency is examined using data on a sample of 5,263 US banks, with 
controls included for differences in ownership structure and geographic location. 
Banks in more highly concentrated markets are found to be less efficient. This 
finding lends some support to the quiet life hypothesis.
Slade (2004) examines the relationship between concentration, market share 
and profitability from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective. Concen-
tration in the metal, mining and refining industries is positively related to profit-
ability, but there is no relationship between market share and profitability. The 
results are consistent with the collusion hypothesis. Yoon (2004) finds a negative 
relationship between market growth and profitability in Korean manufactur-
ing, and between concentration and profitability. There is a positive relationship 
between expenditures on advertising, research and development, and profitability.
	
13.3	
Strategic groups
The strategic groups approach steers a middle way between the original industry-
level and the later firm-level approaches discussed in Section 13.2. A strategic 
group can be defined as a group of firms whose conduct is similar, and which 
tend to view other firms from the same group as their main competitors (Oster, 
1999). The members of a strategic group recognise their interdependence, and 
this recognition conditions their behaviour. For strategic groups, mobility bar-
riers play a role similar to entry barriers, by preventing non-members from join-
ing the group. For example, entry barriers to the UK pharmaceutical industry 
depend on whether an entrant wishes to compete with branded or generic prod-
ucts; and an existing generic producer would face mobility barriers if it were 
to attempt to move into branded products. Mobility barriers can account for 
a tendency for some groups of firms consistently to earn higher rates of profit 
than others within the same industry (Caves and Porter, 1977; Newman, 1978). 
More specifically, the amount of variation in average profitability between firms 
in different strategic groups depends on the following factors:
■ The number and size of groups.  If the strategic groups are numerous and similar 
in size, competition is likely to be more intense than if there is a small number 
of strategic groups that are heterogeneous in size.

	
13.4  Sources of variation in profitability: industry, corporate and business unit effects	 |	
367
■ The extent to which groups follow different strategies.  If strategic groups differ 
in respect of their propensities to invest in discretionary expenditures such as 
advertising and research and development, differences in average profitability 
are likely to be magnified.
■ The extent to which groups are interdependent.  If the markets served by different 
strategic groups tend to be segmented, differences in profitability are likely to 
be larger than in the case where the groups tend to compete to attract the same 
customers.
According to McGee and Thomas (1986), strategic groups can be delineated on 
the basis of similarities in market-related strategies (similarities in product quality 
or design, pricing, extent of product differentiation, branding and advertising); 
firm-specific characteristics (firm size, ownership structure, the extent of vertical 
integration or diversification); or industry characteristics (reliance on economies 
of scale or scope, production technologies used, types of distribution methods 
and networks).
If the strategic group is a meaningful or useful concept, there should be greater 
variation in profitability between groups than within groups. Porter (1979b) aims 
to identify strategic groups using US data for 38 consumer good industries. Lead-
ers are defined as firms accounting for at least 30 per cent of industry sales rev-
enue. For the leader group, profitability is positively related to concentration, 
economies of scale, advertising-to-sales ratio, capital requirements and industry 
growth. For the follower group, profitability is inversely related to concentra-
tion, but there is a positive association between industry growth and capital 
requirements and profitability. The differences between the two groups is cited 
as evidence for the existence of strategic groups.
An obvious difficulty with the strategic groups approach is the subjective ele-
ment involved in the definition of a strategic group. Barney and Hoskisson (1990) 
argue there is no theoretical basis for choosing a set of variables that could be 
used to identify strategic groups, or for determining the weightings to be attached 
to any given set of variables. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the strategic group 
is a meaningful concept in many industries, even though it is impossible to define 
a list of objective criteria that can be used to identify strategic groups. The strate-
gic groups approach has received relatively little attention from economists, but 
this approach is popular in the field of management science.
	
13.4	
Sources of variation in profitability: industry, corporate 
and business unit effects
In the literature reviewed in Sections 13.2 and 13.3, it is assumed various indus-
try-level and firm-level variables can be used to explain the variation in firms’ 
performance measured using profitability data. However, in many studies only 
a relatively low proportion of the total variation in profitability is explained by 
the independent variables. In a seminal paper, Schmalensee (1985) suggests an 
alternative approach, known as variance decomposition analysis, which involves 

368	
|	 13    ■    Market structure, firm strategy and performance
the decomposition of the variation in profitability data into a component that 
is specific to the industry, a component specific to the corporation, and a com-
ponent specific to each line of business of a diversified corporation. A statistical 
technique known as analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine the pro-
portions of the total variation in profitability that can be explained by industry 
effects, corporate effects and business unit effects, and the proportion that is left 
unexplained by each type of effect.
Schmalensee’s sample contains 1975 data on 456 diversified US corporations, 
with lines of business that are classified into 261 different industry groups. A 
diversified corporation reports separate accounts data for each of its lines of busi-
ness, and a separate accounting rate of profit is available for each line of business. 
The following equation is estimated:
pi,k = m + ai + bk + hSi,k + «i,k
The dependent variable, pi,k, is the accounting rate of profit reported for cor-
poration k’s line of business in industry i. m is the overall mean profit rate, 
across all firms and all industries (or lines of business). ai is the component of 
pi,k that is specific to industry i. ai is the same for all lines of business (across 
all corporations) that are classified under industry i. In other words, ai is the 
average deviation of the profit belonging to industry i from the overall mean 
profit rate, m. ai can therefore be interpreted as the effect that is specific to 
industry i. bk is the component of pi,k that is specific to corporation k. bk is 
the same for all of corporation k’s lines of business. In other words, bk is the 
average deviation of the profit rates belonging to corporation k from the over-
all mean profit rate, m. Si,k is corporation k’s share of total sales in industry i. 
This market share variable is included in order to obtain an approximation to 
the effect that is specific to corporation k’s line of business in industry i; or, in 
other words, to obtain an effect that corresponds to the interaction between 
the industry effect ai and the corporate effect bk. h is the coefficient on Si,k. 
Finally, «i,k is a disturbance term that captures any variation in pi,k that is not 
attributed to any of the other effects.
Although the variance decomposition approach is mainly descriptive, it is 
capable of providing powerful insight into the fundamental debate as to whether 
the industry or the firm is the most appropriate unit of observation in industrial 
organization. If the industry effects account for a larger proportion of the varia-
tion in profitability than the firm (corporate or line of business) effects, this sug-
gests the industry is more important. Conversely, if the firm effects dominate the 
industry effects, this suggests the firm is more important. Schmalensee’s empirical 
results suggest industry effects are more important than firm effects; however, 
a number of later studies based on a similar empirical methodology came to the 
opposite conclusion.
Schmalensee’s analysis, based on data for a single year, is exclusively cross-
sectional. However, a number of subsequent contributions draw on panel datas-
ets comprising several annual profitability observations on each line of business 
within each firm. If the dataset includes both a cross-sectional and a time-series 
dimension, an analysis of the sources of variation in profitability richer than the

one developed by Schmalensee becomes possible. Specifically, it is possible to 
identify the following effects:
■ Industry effects that are common to all corporations operating a line of busi-
ness in any particular industry. There is a unique effect pertaining to each 
industry. These effects derive from industry characteristics such as seller con-
centration, the extent of entry and exit barriers, and product differentiation.
■ Corporate effects (or firm effects in Schmalensee’s original terminology) com-
mon to all lines of business operated by any particular corporation. There is a 
unique effect pertaining to each corporation. These effects reflect the impact 
of strategic decisions taken at head office level, concerning matters such as the 
firm’s scale and scope, horizontal and vertical integration and other forms of 
long-run investment or divestment.
■ Line of business or business unit effects that are specific to each line of busi-
ness operated by each corporation. These effects capture the impact of oper-
ational decisions on performance within each of the corporation’s lines of 
business, concerning matters such as production levels, resource allocation 
across departments, research and development and marketing.
■ Year effects capture the effects of macroeconomic fluctuations and changes 
in government policy or taxation that impact equally on the profitability of 
all lines of business for all corporations. In addition, it is possible to include 
interactions between year effects and industry effects, and between year effects 
and corporate effects. These allow for the presence of a transitory component 
within each of these effects. For example, macroeconomic fluctuations or gov-
ernment policy changes might have a different impact on different industries, 
therefore the industry effects should be time-varying. Alternatively, it might be 
that strategic decisions confer only a temporary rather than a permanent com-
petitive advantage, therefore the corporate effects should also be time-varying.
One of the first panel studies was published by Rumelt (1991), who takes 
Schmalensee’s sample of 1975 data on 1,775 business units, and appends 1974, 
1976 and 1977 data for the same business units, thereby obtaining a panel data-
set. The following equation is estimated:
pi,k,t = m + ai + bk + gt + di,t + wi,k + «i,k,t
Time-subscripts are added to the dependent variable and the disturbance term, 
pi,k,t and «i,k,t respectively, to identify the year to which each observation belongs. 
m, ai and bk are interpreted in the same way as before. The year effect gt allows 
for year-to-year variation in the overall mean rate of profitability. The ­industry–
year interaction term di,t allows for these year-to-year variations to differ by 
industry. Finally, the industry–corporate interaction term wi,k incorporates a 
business unit effect: an effect that is specific to corporation k’s line of business 
in industry i. This term replaces the market share variable Si,k in Schmalensee’s 
formulation. The panel structure of Rumelt’s dataset enables a separate effect to 
be estimated for every business unit, without the need for any assumption that 
the business unit effects are proportional to market share. By fitting this model, 

370	
|	 13    ■    Market structure, firm strategy and performance
Rumelt obtains an industry effect that explains 17.9 per cent of the variation in 
profitability; the industry–year interactions explain a further 9.8 per cent; the 
corporate effects explain 14.8 per cent; and the business unit effects explain a 
further 33.9 per cent. Accordingly, Rumelt infers the business unit effect is actu-
ally very much larger than the one reported by Schmalensee.
A number of later contributions have reported similar models estimated 
using more recent or more extensive datasets; similar models for alternative 
performance indicators, or models with extended specifications that incorpo-
rate various refinements. As alternative performance indicators, Wernerfelt and 
Montgomery (1988) use Tobin’s q, Chang and Singh (2000) use business unit 
market share data, and Hawawini et al. (2003) use residual income. McGahan 
(1999) reports analyses of accounting profitability and Tobin’s q, observed at 
corporate rather than at business unit level. This study includes an analysis of 
the effect of corporate focus (the extent to which a corporation is diversified) on 
performance. Corporate focus is found to be unimportant in explaining varia-
tions in profitability at corporate level.
Several contributors, starting with Roquebert et al. (1996), have suggested that 
Schmalensee and Rumelt may have understated the importance of the corporate 
effect. In a simulation study, Brush and Bromiley (1997) show that even if the 
corporate effect is of a similar magnitude to the one reported in the earliest stud-
ies, it still has a non-negligible influence on the averages of their simulated busi-
ness unit profit rates. The simulations suggest the statistical techniques used in 
most variance decomposition studies lack sufficient power to identify the smaller 
effects on performance accurately. It may be possible to improve the power of the 
tests by estimating non-linear transformations of the effects. Bowman and Helfat 
(2001) argue that the inclusion of single business units in many samples deflates 
the estimated corporate effect for corporations comprising multiple business 
units. If corporate strategy exerts a varying effect on different businesses within 
the corporation, the effect may be incorrectly attributed to business rather than 
corporate level. According to Ruefli and Wiggins (2003), a small estimated cor-
porate effect may be due to the importance of corporate strategy, rather than the 
opposite: if the performance of management improves in all corporations, com-
petitive forces may tend to erode the magnitude of the corporate effect. Adner 
and Helfat (2003) estimate a time-varying corporate effect, using press reports to 
identify the timings of major strategic decisions by US petroleum corporations.
Using accounting profitability data, McGahan and Porter’s (2002) reported 
industry, corporate and business unit effects turn out to be smaller when esti-
mated over a 14-year period than when estimated over a seven-year period. This 
suggests these effects may contain a temporary component, which may be present 
for several successive years, but which may disappear in the long run. Therefore 
the industry, corporate and business unit effects appear bigger when estimated 
using short-duration datasets (where any temporary effect is more prominent) 
than when they are estimated using longer-duration datasets (where tempo-
rary effects are likely to have disappeared). Accordingly, McGahan and Porter 
(1997) and Chang and Singh (2000) incorporate an adjustment for persistence, 
or first-order autocorrelation, in the disturbance term of their profitability mod-
els. Persistence or first-order autocorrelation is present when there is non-zero 

correlation between successive values of the disturbance term for the same firm: 
a likely feature if the industry, corporate or business unit effects contain a tem-
porary component, as described above.
McGahan and Porter (1999) develop a more general analysis of the persis-
tence or sustainability over time of the industry, corporate and business unit 
effects. Estimates of these effects are split into a fixed component, and a time-
varying, incremental component. The empirical analysis allows for different 
degrees of persistence in each of the incremental components. This approach 
appears more informative than modelling persistence solely through the distur-
bance term, because persistence can be directly related to questions concerning 
the sustainability of competitive advantage at different levels (industry, corpo-
ration and business).
According to the view that the industry is the most appropriate unit of obser-
vation in industrial organization, an industry’s structural characteristics are more 
stable than the fortunes of individual firms. Greater persistence should be found 
in incremental industry effects than in incremental corporate or business unit 
effects. According to the view that the firm is the most relevant unit of observa-
tion, entry and exit to and from industries should eliminate inter-industry dif-
ferences rapidly; but the incremental corporate or business unit effects should be 
more persistent. McGahan and Porter’s empirical results generally tend to favour 
the industry view: the incremental industry effects turn out to be more persistent 
than the incremental corporate and business unit effects. McGahan and Porter 
(2003) test for the presence of asymmetries in these results. For example, they 
find both the magnitude and the persistence of industry effects are greater for 
above-average performers than for below-average performers; conversely, busi-
ness unit effects are more important for low-performers.
The empirical studies reviewed above draw exclusively on US data, and the 
profitability variance decomposition literature includes relatively limited evi-
dence from outside the US. Furman (2000) reports comparisons between four 
countries using 1992–8 data: Australia, Canada, the UK and the US. Khanna 
and Rivkin (2001) examine the effects of business group membership on prof-
itability for a sample of firms drawn from 14 developing countries. Business 
group and industry membership are important determinants of the variation 
in profitability. In a study using 1994–8 data on Spanish manufacturing firms, 
Claver et al. (2002) report a business unit effect of around 40 per cent, together 
with very small industry and year effects. Spanos et al. (2004) analyse Greek 
data for 1995–6, and find business unit and industry effects account for 15 per 
cent and 6.5 per cent of the variance in profitability, respectively. Goddard et al. 
(2009) use a variance decomposition analysis to examine the importance of the 
country, industry, corporate group and firm effects on profitability and growth 
for European manufacturing firms. They find differences between industries in 
the comparative advantage offered by different countries, reflecting a tendency 
for specialization and geographic concentration. However, as in several previous 
studies, the firm-level effects are found to be the most important class of effect 
in explaining the variation in performance.
More recently, researchers have attempted to measure directly the importance 
of management practices in explaining performance differences across firms

(Bloom and Van Reenen, 2007; Dowdy and Van Reenen, 2014). On average the 
results from these studies suggest that differences in management practices can 
explain as much as 25 per cent of performance differences among firms across 
industries and across countries (Bloom et al., 2014).

The new empirical industrial organization (NEIO)
Empirical research based on the SCP paradigm has been widely criticised for 
placing too much emphasis on industry structure, while the analysis of firm 
conduct is often underemphasised. However, the observed relationship between 
commonly used SCP structure and performance indicators, such as concentra-
tion and profitability, is often quite weak. These considerations have motivated a 
number of attempts to collect direct empirical evidence on the nature of competi-
tion, by observing conduct directly (Lau, 1982; Panzar and Rosse, 1982, 1987; 
Bresnahan, 1982, 1989). This approach has become known as the new empirical 
industrial organization (NEIO). One of the major strengths of NEIO is that it is 
grounded firmly in microeconomic (oligopoly) theory. SCP measures ­structure–
performance relationships across a number of industries, and draws inferences 
about what these relationships might mean for conduct. In contrast, NEIO 
makes direct observations of conduct in specific industries, and draws infer-
ences about what these observed patterns of conduct might mean for structure.
Empirical research in the NEIO strand attempts to estimate the behavioural 
equations that specify how firms set their prices and quantities. However, a 
behavioural relationship such as marginal revenue equals marginal cost cannot 
be estimated directly, because data on marginal revenue and marginal cost are 
not observed. Such a relationship might be estimated indirectly, by specifying 
a model in which the application of a pricing rule such as marginal revenue 
equals marginal cost has implications for the observed patterns of variation in 
other variables. For example, one of the approaches described below compares 
variations in the prices of the firms’ factor inputs with variations in their total 
revenues. If the firms are profit maximisers, this comparison produces different 
results under market conditions of perfect competition, monopolistic competition 
and monopoly. One of the main methodological challenges for NEIO research 
is to find ways of transforming behavioural relationships that are unobservable 
in their original theoretical form into relationships involving variables that can 
be observed, so that tests are available that can be implemented in practice. Two 
such approaches, the revenue test and the markup test, are reviewed in the next 
two subsections.
The Rosse–Panzar revenue test
Rosse and Panzar (1977) develop a test that examines whether firm conduct is in 
accordance with the models of perfect competition, imperfect or monopolistic 
competition, or monopoly. The Rosse–Panzar test is also known as the revenue 
test. This test is based on empirical observation of the impact on firm-level reve-
nues of variations in the prices of the factors of production that are used as inputs 

	
	
	
13.5  The new empirical industrial organization (NEIO)	 |	
373
in the production processes of a group of competing firms. Built into the test is 
an explicit assumption of profit-maximizing behaviour on the part of the firms.
Rosse and Panzar show that the H-statistic, defined as the sum of the elastici-
ties of a firm’s total revenue with respect to each of its factor input prices, differs 
under perfectly competitive, imperfectly competitive and monopolistic market 
conditions. The intuition is straightforward in the polar cases of perfect competi-
tion and monopoly, but more complex in the intermediate case of imperfect or 
monopolistic competition. The following discussion focuses on the two polar 
cases. In each of these, the impact of a simultaneous equiproportionate increase 
in all of the firm’s factor input prices is considered. This implies an equipropor-
tionate increase in the total cost of producing any given level of output, and an 
upward shift in the positions of the LRAC (long-run average cost) and LRMC 
(long-run marginal cost) functions.
Figure 13.1 illustrates the adjustment under perfect competition. As each 
firm’s LRAC and LRMC functions shift upwards (LRAC1 to LRAC2; LRMC1 
to LRMC2), the market price must increase in exactly the same proportion, so 
that each firm continues to earn only a normal profit when long-run equilib-
rium is restored. The increase in market price implies a reduction in the level 
of demand. The required adjustment in the total quantity of output (from Q1 
to Q2) is achieved by a reduction in the number of firms (from N1 to N2). How-
ever, for those firms that survive, total revenue increases in the same proportion 
as total cost, and in the same proportion as the original increase in factor prices. 
Therefore in perfect competition, the H-statistic (the sum of the elasticities of 
revenue with respect to each factor price) is one.
Figure 13.2 illustrates the adjustment under monopoly. For simplicity, in 
this case horizontal LRAC and LRMC functions are assumed. As these func-
tions shift upwards, the monopolist’s profit-maximizing price and output adjust 
from (P1, Q1) to (P2, Q2). Note that a monopolist with non-zero costs always 
operates on the price-elastic portion of the market demand function. This must

be so, because for profit maximization, marginal revenue equals marginal cost, 
so if LRMC 7 0, then MR 7 0. And if MR 7 0, price elasticity of demand, 
 PED 7 1. This implies the shift from (P1, Q1) to (P2, Q2) causes a reduction 
in the monopolist’s total revenue (if  PED 7 1, an increase in price causes total 
revenue to fall). Therefore, in monopoly, the H-statistic (the sum of the elastici-
ties of revenue with respect to each factor price) is negative.
The Rosse–Panzar revenue test is implemented by estimating the following 
linear regression using firm-level data:
loge(TRi,t) = b0 + b1loge(w1,i,t) + b2loge(w2,i,t) + b3loge(w3,i,t)
where TRi,t = total revenue of firm i in year t; wj,i,t = price of factor input j 
paid by firm i in year t. In this formulation, it is assumed there are three factors 
of production (for example, labour, capital and land). If the prices of the factor 
inputs cannot be observed directly, they are usually imputed, using the ratio of 
the quantity of each factor employed (number of employees, for example) to 
the level of expenditure on the same factor (expenditure on wages and salaries).
An advantage of specifying this revenue equation in log-linear form is that the 
coefficients can be interpreted as elasticities. Therefore, with three factor inputs, 
the Rosse–Panzar H-statistic is defined as:
H = b1 + b2 + b3
The estimated version of the revenue equation can be used to obtain an estimated 
value of H, and the numerical value of H leads to inferences about the firms’ 
conduct. The interpretation is as follows:
■ If H = 1, conduct is in accordance with the model of perfect competition.
■ If H 6 0, conduct is in accordance with the model of monopoly.

■ 0 6 H 6 1 represents the intermediate case of conduct in accordance with 
imperfectly competitive market conditions.
Bresnahan and Lau’s markup test
Another method for examining the nature of firm conduct, known as the markup 
test, is suggested by Bresnahan (1982, 1989) and Lau (1982). This test involves 
estimating a structural model incorporating demand and cost equations, together 
with the profit-maximizing condition marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The 
parameters of the model can be estimated using data either at industry level or 
at firm level.
This subsection provides a detailed description of the construction of one 
such model, which is employed by Shaffer and DiSalvo (1994) to test for the 
nature of competitive conduct in a banking market in south central Pennsylvania. 
Although this model is implemented using banking data, the model specification 
is quite general, and the same model can be used for other industries. To describe 
the markup test, the style of presentation is more technical than in the previous 
subsection.
Shaffer and DiSalvo begin by specifying a market demand function in log-
linear form, to be estimated using industry time series data:
loge(P) = a0 + a1loge(Q) + a2loge(Y) + a3loge(Z) + a4t
where P = market price; Q = total industry output; Y = aggregate income; 
Z = price of a substitute product; t = linear time trend. This market demand 
function is specified in inverse form (with price on the left-hand side and quantity 
demanded on the right-hand side). However, the expression can easily be rear-
ranged to provide an expression for quantity demanded in terms of price:
loge(Q) = -a0/a1 + (1/a1)loge(P) - (a2/a1)loge(Y)
- (a3/a1)loge(Z) - (a4/a1)t
As before, by specifying the market demand function in log-linear form, the coeffi-
cients can be interpreted as elasticities. Therefore, PED (price elasticity of demand) 
equals (1/a1). The income elasticity of demand equals - (a2/a1), and the cross-price 
elasticity of demand equals - (a3/a1). If a1 6 0, a2 6 0 and a3 6 0, PED is nega-
tive, and the income and cross-price elasticities are both positive, as the relevant 
theory suggests. Furthermore, since PED = 1
a1
, it follows that 
1
PED = a1.
Having specified the market demand function, Shaffer and DiSalvo also spec-
ify a marginal revenue and a marginal cost function for each firm. An expression 
for the total revenue of firm i is:
TRi = Pqi
where qi = output of firm i, such that a
i
qi = Q.

376	
|	 13    ■    Market structure, firm strategy and performance
Therefore firm i’s marginal revenue can be written as follows:
MRi = P + qi ∆P
∆qi
This expression says that if firm i increases its output by one unit, the effect on 
firm i’s total revenue consists of two components. First, firm i obtains the current 
market price, P, for the additional unit of output produced and sold. Second, if 
the extra output causes the market price to fall, firm i loses some revenue over 
each unit of output it is already producing. Firm i’s current output level is qi, 
and the rate at which price falls as firm i’s output increases is ∆P/∆qi. In perfect 
competition, firm i does not expect price to change when it increases its output, 
so ∆P/∆qi = 0. In imperfect competition or monopoly, however, firm i expects 
price to fall as it increases its output, so ∆P/∆qi 6 0. Some simple algebraic 
manipulation of the previous expression yields:
MRi = P + qi ∆P
∆qi
= P¢1 + qi
P * ∆P
∆qi
≤= P¢1 +
1
PEDi

where PEDi is firm i’s price elasticity of demand.
What is the relationship between PED and PEDi? The answer depends on 
firm i’s conjectural variation: how does firm i expect its competitors to react if 
firm i implements a small increase in output? Shaffer and DiSalvo introduce a 
parameter li to represent firm i’s conjectural variation.
PEDi =
PED
1 + li
1
1
PEDi
= 1 + li
PED
= a1(1 + li) 
1 MRi = P[1 + ai(1 + li)]
The numerical value of the parameter li provides important information about 
the nature of competition that is perceived by firm i:
■ Under perfect competition, when firm i increases its output level, it assumes 
there will be no impact on the market price. To represent this in the model, 
li = -1 is required. This ensures PEDi = ∞, and MRi = P.
■ Under joint profit maximization, the firms set their prices as if they were a 
single monopolist. When firm i increases its output level, it assumes the market 
price will adjust in accordance with the market demand function. To represent 
this case in the model, li = 0 is required. This ensures PEDi = PED, and
MRi = P a1 +
1
PED b
■ Finally, intermediate values of the parameter li such that -1 6 li 6 0 cor-
respond to various forms of imperfect competition, including Cournot com-
petition (each firm chooses its profit-maximizing output level, treating other 
firms’ output levels as fixed at their current levels).

377
Next, Shaffer and DiSalvo specify firm i’s marginal cost function:
MCi = ACi[b0 + b1loge(qi) + b2loge(w1,i) + b3loge(w2,i) + b4loge(w3,i)]
where ACi = firm i’s average cost; wj,i = price of the j’th factor input used by 
firm i (as before, firm i is assumed to use three factors of production). This type 
of specification is commonly used to estimate cost functions. The numerical val-
ues of the parameters of the total cost function from which this marginal cost 
function is derived can be chosen to allow for diminishing returns to each factor 
input; and either increasing, constant or decreasing returns to scale. For present 
purposes, the following features of the marginal cost function are important:
■ Marginal cost, which cannot be measured or observed directly, is expressed as 
a function of average cost, which can be measured and observed.
■ If b1 7 0, b2 7 0, b3 7 0 and b4 7 0, marginal cost increases as output 
increases, and marginal cost increases as each factor input price increases.
Firm i’s condition for profit maximization is MRi = MCi:
MRi = P[1 + a1(1 + li)] = MCi 1 P = MCi - Pa1(1 + li)
Unfortunately, this expression contains MCi, which cannot be observed. Some 
further algebraic manipulation is therefore required, in order to express firm i’s 
profit-maximizing condition in terms of variables that are observed and mea-
sured. Divide all three terms in the second expression (above) by ACi; multiply 
top and bottom of the first term by Q; and multiply top and bottom of the third 
term by qi, to obtain:
 
PQ
Q * ACi
= MCi

- Pqiai(1 + li)

Q * ACi
= [b0 + b1loge(qi) + b2loge(w1,i) + b3loge(w2,i)
+ b4loge(w3,i)] - TRiai(1 + li)
qiACi
where TR = industry total revenue = PQ = a
i
TRi. This final expression is 
a rearranged statement of firm i’s profit-maximizing condition MRi = MCi, 
expressed entirely in terms of variables that can be observed and measured. In 
order to implement the markup test, the following linear regressions are esti-
mated using time-series data at industry and firm level. For clarity, all firm and 
time-subscripts are included.
Market demand function (one equation, based on industry-level time-series 
data):
loge(Pt) = a0 + a1loge(Qt) + a2loge(Yt) + a3loge(Zt) + a4t

378	
|	 13    ■    Market structure, firm strategy and performance
Profit-maximizing condition (one equation for each firm, based on firm-level 
time series data):
yi,t = b0,i + b1, i loge(qi,t) + b2,i loge(w1,i,t) + b3,i loge(w2,i,t)
+ b4,i loge(w3,i,t) + bixi,t
where yi,t =
TRt
Qt ACi,t
; xi,t =
TRi,t
qi,t ACi,t
; bi = -ai (1 + li).
The estimated versions of these equations can be used to obtain an estimated 
value of li for each firm. The value of li (within the range -1 … li … 0) provides 
an indication of the nature of firm i’s conjectural variation. This in turn indicates 
whether price-setting conduct by each firm is based on perfectly competitive, 
imperfectly competitive or monopolistic (joint profit-maximization) assumptions.
Empirical evidence
The revenue and markup tests have been applied extensively using banking data. 
Using the revenue test for a sample of New York banks, Shaffer (1982) finds 
0 6 H 6 1, and infers competition is in accordance with the model of monopo-
listic competition. Although the New York banking sector is highly concentrated, 
entry and exit conditions are relatively free. Nathan and Neave (1989) run similar 
tests for Canadian banks, trust companies and mortgage companies with data for 
the period 1982–4. In each case the results indicate 0 6 H 6 1. Using European 
banking data for the period 1986–9, Molyneux et al. (1994) obtain 0 6 H 6 1 
for France, Germany, Spain and the UK, and H 6 0 for Italy. In a later study 
using 1992–6 data, De Bandt and Davis (1999) obtain 0 6 H 6 1 for France, 
Germany, Italy and the US. Competition appears to be most intense in the US, 
while French and German small banks have a certain degree of market power.
The results of many of these empirical studies tend to be consistent: com-
monly, price-setting behaviour in accordance with the intermediate competitive 
models (imperfect or monopolistic competition) is detected. Accordingly, some 
critics have argued that while NEIO models are ‘potentially useful if there is con-
cern over the specification of the structural model, or if data required to estimate 
the structural model are not available’, they are also limited in the sense that they 
offer ‘a determination of only what the market structure of degree of monopoly 
is not, and do not suggest what it is’ (Church and Ware, 2000, p. 450).
Furthermore, the revenue test in particular is based on assumptions that mar-
kets are observed in a state of long-run equilibrium.
Where available data are sufficient to implement it, the Bresnahan–
Lau technique is superior to the Rosse–Panzar approach in terms 
of econometric identification and ability of the estimated conduct 
parameter to map into specific oligopoly solution concepts. Moreover, 
the Rosse–Panzar statistic is not reliable for samples that are not in long 
run equilibrium, but may exhibit a downward bias in that case.
(Shaffer, 2001, p. 82)

Goddard and Wilson (2009) identify the implications for the H-statistic of mis-
specification bias in the revenue equation, arising when adjustment towards mar-
ket equilibrium is partial and not instantaneous. Using simulation techniques, 
it is shown that fixed effects estimation produces a measured H-statistic that is 
severely biased towards zero. A dynamic formulation of the revenue equation is 
required for accurate identification of the H-statistic and the level of competition.

The persistence of profit
The SCP and NEIO approaches are based on microeconomic theory in which 
optimizing behaviour is assumed. The main focus is on equilibrium, and little is 
said about the process by which equilibrium is reached. Problems such as imper-
fect information and uncertainty are ignored. Another strand in the empirical 
literature, known as the persistence of profit (POP) approach, examines the time-
series behaviour of firm-level profit data.
POP constitutes a departure from the static, cross-sectional methodology 
that is prevalent in most of the literature based on the SCP paradigm. It can 
be argued that the SCP view of competition is typically based on a snapshot, 
taken at one particular moment in time, and does little to explain the dynam-
ics of competition (Geroski, 1990). There is no certainty that a profit rate, or 
any alternative performance measure observed at some specific moment in time, 
represents a long-run equilibrium value of the variable in question. An empirical 
association between concentration and high profitability may simply appear by 
chance, from observation during a period when the relevant market is in a state 
of disequilibrium. If so, cross-sectional data do not capture (unless by luck) the 
long-run equilibrium relationship. Furthermore, cross-sectional data usually do 
not contain enough information on which to base reliable policy decisions. For 
example, an abnormal or monopoly profit realised in one period could disappear 
in the next, rendering intervention by government or other regulatory organisa-
tions unnecessary.
Brozen (1971) criticises Bain’s (1951) study, suggesting that a disequilibrium 
phenomenon was being observed (in the data used). If high profitability is the 
result of the exercise of market power by a monopolist in long-run equilibrium, 
then similarly high returns should be realised over a number of years. Brozen 
replicates Bain’s empirical analysis over a later period (1953–7), and finds that 
in highly concentrated industries, average profitability was only 0.6 per cent 
above the average; and in unconcentrated industries, average profitability was 
0.5 per cent below the average. This suggests that over time, profitability in the 
more profitable industries tends to fall, and profitability in the less profitable 
industries tends to rise. In other words, there is a tendency for profit rates to 
converge towards a common long-run average value. This finding lends support 
to the disequilibrium hypothesis.
Brozen’s findings motivated a body of empirical research that has examined 
patterns of industry and firm performance over an extended period. Research at 
industry level suggests industry profits tend to converge quite slowly, over peri-
ods of several years’ duration. Significant correlations between past and present

profit rates are therefore observed. Firm-level studies suggest there are significant 
differences between firms in long-run equilibrium profit rates, and differences 
in the speed of convergence. The remainder of this section provides a selective 
review of this literature.
Industry-level studies
Using US data, Levy (1987) develops a model in which expectations of future 
profitability are formed with reference to market structure variables such as 
entry barriers, concentration, advertising intensity and industry growth; and 
anticipated changes in these variables. If current profitability is higher than 
expected, entry should take place, causing profitability to fall. The same process 
should happen in reverse if current profitability is lower than expected. The 
results suggest the process of adjustment towards long-run equilibrium takes 
about four years. Industry-level variables such as entry barriers, concentration 
and growth in demand are important in determining the speed of adjustment. 
These results provide support for Brozen’s critique. Coate (1989) reports a ten-
dency for profits above or below the long-run equilibrium to converge towards 
a long-run equilibrium within ten years. These results provide partial support 
for Brozen’s critique. Keating (1991) finds that profitability in highly concen-
trated US industries was less persistent than profitability in unconcentrated 
industries. There is no evidence of long-run persistence in industry-level average 
profitability.
Droucopoulos and Lianos (1993) investigate convergence in industry-level 
average profit rates using Greek manufacturing data. In most cases, the speed 
of adjustment towards long-run equilibrium is slow: 90 per cent of any abnor-
mal return earned in year t persists into year t + 1. High concentration or high 
advertising intensity tend to slow the speed of adjustment. Similarly, Bourlakis 
(1997) reports evidence of a tendency for profitability to persist, especially in 
highly concentrated Greek industries.
Firm-level studies
At the firm level, the POP literature focuses on the persistence of a firm’s stan-
dardised profit rate, defined as the difference between the firm’s actual profit 
rate and the average profit rate across all firms in each year. If firm i’s stan-
dardised profit rate in year t is denoted ps
i,t, then ps
i,t = pi,t - pt, where pi,t is 
firm i’s actual profit rate in year t and pt is the average profit rate in year t. The 
standardisation eliminates from the analysis the effects of any macroeconomic 
fluctuations, which tend to impact equally on all firms’ profit rates, causing pt 
to vary from year to year.
Firm-level POP studies investigate two forms of persistence in ps
i,t. First, short-
run persistence refers to the degree of correlation between consecutive values of 
ps
i,t for the same firm: in other words, the correlation between ps
i,t-1 and ps
i,t.
■ In perfectly competitive markets with no barriers to entry, abnormal profit is 
only a very temporary (short-run) phenomenon, which is rapidly eliminated by 

	
	
	
13.6  The persistence of profit	 |	
381
the forces of competition. Therefore any abnormal profit (positive or negative) 
should disappear quickly. This implies there should be little or no correlation 
between consecutive values of any firm’s standardised profit rate, or between 
ps
i,t-1 and ps
i,t.
■ If competition is anything less than perfect, and there are barriers to entry 
(which may or may not be surmountable in the long run), it may take some 
time for any abnormal profit to be eroded by the forces of competition. This 
means if an abnormal profit (positive or negative) is realised by a firm in one 
year, it is more than likely the same firm will earn a similar abnormal profit 
the following year. There should be a positive correlation between consecutive 
values of the standardised profit rate, or between ps
i,t-1 and ps
i,t.
The second type of persistence of profit, long-run persistence, refers to the 
degree of variation in the long-run average standardised profit rates between firms.
■ In competitive markets with no barriers to entry, or with entry barriers that 
are surmountable in the long run, short-run abnormal profits are eventually 
competed away. Each firm’s profit rate should eventually converge towards a 
common value that is the same for all firms. In other words, all firms should 
earn only a normal profit in the long run.
■ In markets where barriers to entry are permanent and insurmountable, there is 
no convergence of firm-level profit rates towards a common long-run average 
value. Differences in firm-level average profit rates may persist permanently 
or indefinitely.
The POP model can be formulated using a first-order autoregressive model for 
each firm’s standardised profit rate:
ps
i,t = ai + lips
i,t-1 + «i,t.
The parameters ai and li have i-subscripts to denote that it is usual to estimate a 
separate version of this model for each firm. li represents the strength of short-
run persistence in firm i’s standardised profit rate. li = 0 implies there is no 
association between ps
i,t-1 and ps
i,t, and therefore corresponds to the case of 
perfect competition. 0 6 li 6 1 implies there is a positive association between 
ps
i,t-1 and ps
i,t, or positive short-run persistence of profit.
In the first-order autoregressive model with 0 … li 6 1, there is a tendency 
for firm i’s standardised profit rate to converge towards an average or equi-
librium value of mi = ai/(1 - li) in the long run. The sign of the parameter ai 
determines whether firm i’s long-run average standardised profit rate is positive 
or negative; in other words, whether firm i’s actual long-run average profit rate 
is above or below the average for all firms. If mi = 0 for all firms, then all firms’ 
profit rates converge to the same long-run average value. In this case there is no 
long-run persistence of profit. If mi 7 0 for some firms and mi 6 0 for others, 
there is long-run persistence: there is variation between the long-run average 
profit rates of different firms.
The implications of different patterns of short-run and long-run persistence 
for some typical time series plots of firm-level profit rates are illustrated in 

382

Figure 13.3. The graphs show stylized plots of standardised profit rates for two 
firms (1 and 2) when short-run persistence is either zero or positive; and when 
long-run persistence is either zero or non-zero. Figure 13.3 illustrates the follow-
ing features:
■ When short-run persistence is zero (li = 0), the time-series plots of the stan-
dardised profit rates are jagged. The value of ps
i,t-1 (above or below zero) con-
veys no information about whether ps
i,t will be above or below zero, because the 
year-to-year variation in ps
i,t is essentially random. In contrast, when short-run 
persistence is positive (li 7 0), the time-series plots of the standardised profit 
rates are smoother. If ps
i,t-1 is above zero, it is likely ps
i,t will also be above zero 
(and vice versa), because sequences of positive or negative standardised profit 
rates tend to persist over several consecutive time periods.
■ When long-run persistence is zero (mi = 0 for all i), the standardised profit 
rates of all firms tend to fluctuate around the same long-run average value 
of zero (Figure 13.3(a)). When long-run persistence is non-zero (mi ≠0 for 
all i), the standardised profit rates tend to fluctuate around different long-run 
average values (m1 7 0 and m2 6 0 in Figure 13.3(b)).
The idea that by observing patterns in the time-series variation of firm-level profit 
rate data, inferences can be drawn about the nature of competition (whether bar-
riers to entry exist and, if so, whether they are temporary or permanent), has 
motivated a body of research that was first pioneered by Mueller (1977, 1986). 
The hypothesis tested in these studies is that (potential and actual) entry into and 
exit from any market are sufficiently free to bring any abnormal profits quickly 
into line with the competitive rate of return. In other words, competitive forces

are sufficiently powerful to ensure no firm persistently earns profits above or 
below the norm. Firms never achieve a stable equilibrium in the conventional 
sense, however, because each period brings new random shocks. If the market 
is responsive to excess profits and losses, returns tend to gravitate towards the 
competitive level. But if some firms possess and are able to retain specialised 
knowledge or other advantages, these firms may be able to earn profits that 
remain above the norm persistently, in the long run.
In the empirical POP literature, the average value (over a number of sample 
firms) of the estimated short-run persistence parameter li provides a useful indi-
cator of the strength of persistence, which has been reported on a consistent basis 
in most studies. Most researchers have obtained a value of this statistic in the 
range 0.4–0.5. Most studies have also reported evidence of significant differences 
between firms in long-run average profit rates. In other words, it appears all 
firms’ profit rates do not tend to converge towards the same equilibrium or aver-
age value in the long run. Cuaresma and Gschwandtner (2008) use a threshold 
autoregression applied to US profitability data. There is statistical evidence of 
non-linear adjustment for many firms in the sample. Goddard et al. (2006) apply 
three panel unit root tests to UK firm size, growth and profit rate data. There is 
strong and consistent evidence of mean-reversion in profit rates. A summary of 
empirical POP studies is shown in Table 13.2.

Summary
The performance of firms is one of the central research themes in industrial 
organization. There is now a substantial body of empirical research that seeks 
to explain variations in performance between firms, most commonly measured 
by profitability. Early research, based mainly on the SCP (structure–conduct–
performance) paradigm, identified structural industry-level variables such as 
concentration, economies of scale, and entry and exit conditions as the most 
important determinants of firm performance. However, this approach has 
been subject to intense criticism. Many of the structure–performance relation-
ships identified in SCP-based empirical research are weak. Some economists, 
including those associated with the Chicago school, argue that market power 
deriving from monopolization is only a temporary phenomenon. A positive 
association between concentration and profitability may reflect an association 
between productive efficiency and firm size: the most efficient firms earn the 
largest profits, enabling them to grow at the expense of their competitors. If 
efficiency differences between firms are more important than industry struc-
ture in determining performance, attention should presumably be directed 
less towards the industry and more towards the individual firm. Accordingly, 
later empirical research in both industrial organization and strategic manage-
ment has sought to shift the focus of attention towards conduct or strategic 
decision-making at firm level.
The strategic management literature on strategic groups perhaps offers a mid-
dle way between the industry-level and firm-level approaches discussed above. 
A strategic group is a group of firms whose conduct is similar, and which tend 
to view other members of the same group as their main competitors. The mem-
bers of a strategic group recognise their interdependence, and this recognition 
conditions their behaviour. For strategic groups, mobility barriers play a role 
similar to entry barriers, by preventing non-members from joining the group. 
The variation in average profitability between firms in different groups depends 
on the number and size of groups, the extent to which groups follow different 
strategies, and the degree of interdependence between groups. Cluster analysis 
is often used to identify groups of firms with similar characteristics, but the stra-
tegic groups approach can be criticised for failing to provide a clear theoretical 
basis for deciding group membership. The strategic groups approach has been 
more influential in the strategic management literature than in the industrial 
economics literature.
A variance decomposition analysis of firm-level profitability data involves 
the decomposition of the variation in profit rates into components specific to 
the industry, the parent corporation and each line of business within a diversi-
fied corporation. It is possible to identify the proportions of the total variance 
in profitability that are explained by each type of effect. The variance decom-
position approach is mainly descriptive. However, it is capable of providing 
powerful insights into the debate as to whether the industry or the firm is the

most appropriate unit of observation in industrial organization, by compar-
ing the relative contributions made by the industry effects or the corporate 
and business unit effects in explaining the variation in profitability. Some of 
the earliest studies of this kind found industry effects to be more important 
than firm-level effects; however, this finding has been challenged by several 
later researchers. Recently, several researchers have explored the persistence 
or sustainability over time of the industry, corporate and business unit effects. 
Estimates of these effects are split into a fixed component and a time-varying, 
incremental component. The notion of persistence can be directly related to 
questions concerning the sustainability of competitive advantage at different 
levels (industry, corporation or business).
In industrial organization, empirical research based on the SCP paradigm 
has been widely criticised for placing too much emphasis on industry struc-
ture, while the analysis of conduct is underemphasised. This critique has 
motivated several attempts to assess the nature of competition by observing 
conduct directly. This approach is known as the new empirical industrial 
organization (NEIO). NEIO makes direct observations of conduct and draws 
inferences about market structure. The revenue test of Rosse and Panzar 
involves estimating the sum of the elasticities of revenue with respect to each 
of the firm’s factor input prices. The sign and magnitude of this statistic indi-
cate whether firms’ price-setting behaviour is consistent with the theoretical 
models of perfect competition, monopolistic competition or monopoly. The 
markup test of Bresnahan and Lau involves estimating a structural model 
incorporating demand and cost equations, linked by the profit-maximizing 
condition marginal revenue equals marginal cost. An estimate of the firm’s 
price elasticity of demand again provides evidence about the nature of com-
petition the firm perceives.
Both the SCP and NEIO methodologies are based on assumptions of profit 
maximization and long-run equilibrium. In contrast, the persistence of the 
profit strand in the empirical industrial organization literature focuses on 
the process of adjustment towards equilibrium, by analysing time-series data 
on firm-level profit rates. Short-run persistence refers to the degree of cor-
relation between consecutive values of a firm’s standardised profit rate (in 
successive years). In perfectly competitive markets with no barriers to entry, 
abnormal profit is rapidly eliminated by competition, so there is little corre-
lation between consecutive profit rates. In imperfectly competitive markets, 
with high barriers to entry, abnormal profits may tend to persist for several 
years. Therefore, consecutive profit rates tend to be more highly correlated. 
Long-run persistence refers to the degree of variation between firms in the 
long-run average (standardised) profit rates. Empirical studies at industry 
and firm level consistently report evidence of significant short-run and long-
run persistence of profit. Explaining such differences has proved a difficult 
task. However, recent evidence suggests that management practices play an 
important role in generating performance differences among firms across 
industries and countries.

Introduction
Price determination is an essential component of most of the theories of deci-
sion-making and resource allocation at firm and industry level that have been 
developed in the previous chapters of this book. For example, price formation in 
perfectly competitive, imperfectly competitive and monopolistic market condi-
tions is one of the central themes of Chapters 3, 7 and 8. Chapter 14 examines 
a number of further aspects of pricing behaviour, from both a theoretical and a 
practical perspective.

392	
|	 14    ■    Pricing
The neoclassical theory of the firm can be criticised by questioning whether 
firms have sufficient information in practice to determine their prices by 
applying the profit-maximizing rule marginal revenue equals marginal cost. 
Section 14.2 examines an alternative pricing rule known as cost plus pricing, 
whereby price is determined by adding a percentage markup to average variable 
cost. The markup includes a contribution towards the firm’s fixed costs, and 
a profit margin. The relationship between profit-maximizing pricing and cost 
plus pricing is considered, and the conditions are identified under which both 
methods produce similar outcomes.
The pricing models developed earlier in this book are based on an assumption 
that firms set uniform prices that are identical for all consumers, and are identical 
no matter what quantity each consumer buys. Section 14.3 examines a pricing 
policy known as price discrimination, under which a firm either sells at different 
prices to different consumers, or makes the price per unit each consumer pays 
dependent on the number of units purchased. For such a policy to be possible, the 
firm must enjoy some degree of market power, and the market must be divisible 
into submarkets between which secondary trade or resale is not possible. Three 
types of price discrimination, known as first-, second- and third-degree price dis-
crimination, are considered. Several examples of price discrimination commonly 
encountered in practice are identified. Section 14.4 examines the related (but 
conceptually distinct) practice of peak-load pricing, in which a supplier facing a 
level of demand that varies at different times of the day or on different days of 
the year can vary its prices accordingly, but must also decide on a fixed capacity 
level that is the same for all periods.
In multidivisional organizations, the choice of transfer prices at which inter-
mediate products are traded internally between divisions affects the imputed 
divisional profitability. Decisions taken at divisional level with a view to the 
maximization of divisional profits do not necessarily ensure the maximization 
of the firm’s aggregate profits. Section 14.5 develops several profit-maximizing 
models of transfer pricing. The analysis suggests that incentives for divisional 
managers, and decisions concerning the viability of loss-making divisions, should 
not be based solely on imputed divisional profitability, but should reflect the 
implications for the profitability of the firm as a whole.
The growth of online retailing has stimulated interest in the topic of price dis-
persion. Given that online consumers can shop around and compare the prices of 
similar or identical products at the click of a mouse, how much scope remains for 
different retailers to charge different prices for the same product or service? This 
chapter concludes in Section 14.6 with a review of a number of recent empirical 
studies of price dispersion in traditional and online retailing.
	
14.2	
Cost plus pricing
According to the neoclassical theory of the firm, under the assumption of profit 
maximization price is determined through the application of the behavioural rule 
marginal revenue equals marginal cost (MR = MC). As shown in Section 4.2,

from an early stage in the development of the neoclassical theory, some econo-
mists questioned whether firms have sufficient information to apply this rule in 
practice. In a highly influential study, Hall and Hitch (1939) report the results 
of interviews with the managers of 38 businesses, 30 of whom reported the use 
of some form of cost plus pricing formula. Under cost plus pricing, the firm cal-
culates or estimates its AVC (average variable cost), and then sets its price by 
adding a percentage markup that includes a contribution towards the firm’s fixed 
costs, and a profit margin:
Price = AVC + % markup
or P = (1 + m)AVC
where P denotes price, and the markup (expressed as a percentage) is 100 * m 
per cent. A number of advantages are claimed for cost plus pricing over pricing 
using the profit-maximizing rule MR = MC.
■ The cost plus pricing formula is simple to understand, and can be implemented 
using less information than is required for profit-maximizing pricing. For 
the latter, the firm requires detailed information about its MC, MR and AR 
(demand) functions. For cost plus pricing, the firm only requires an estimate 
of its AVC, and a decision concerning the size of the markup.
■ Cost plus pricing may produce greater price stability than profit-maximizing 
pricing. The latter implies price should change every time there is a minor 
variation in demand. In contrast, with cost plus pricing, provided AVC is 
relatively flat over the relevant range of output levels, minor variations in the 
level of demand need not lead to changes in price. Price stability may be valued 
by consumers, as it reduces their search costs, and by producers, as it reduces 
the likelihood that destructive price competition may break out.
■ Cost plus pricing appeals to a sense of fairness: in determining its markup, 
the firm can claim to allow for a reasonable profit margin, rather than the 
maximum profit. Price changes can be attributed solely to changes in costs, 
rather than fluctuations in market demand.
However, in some cases these claimed advantages might be open to question. 
Fluctuations in demand can only be ignored safely when setting price if AVC 
is constant over the relevant range of output levels. If AVC varies with output, 
the firm needs to know its output level before it can determine its price. This 
means it needs to estimate its demand function. Cost plus pricing does not imply 
price stability if costs are changing, or if there are fluctuations in demand and 
AVC varies with output. Cost plus pricing may not be simple to implement for a 
multi-product firm, since it may be difficult to apportion fixed and variable costs 
accurately between a number of product lines (Hanson, 1992).
Finally, the question arises as to what profit margin to include in the markup. 
If the size of the profit margin varies with market conditions, the difference 
between cost plus pricing and pricing for profit maximization using the rule 
MR = MC might not be as large as it first appears. Suppose the cost plus pricing 
firm always selects approximately the same profit margin as a profit-maximizing 

394	
|	 14    ■    Pricing
firm would achieve by applying the rule MR = MC. Naturally, this profit mar-
gin tends to be higher when demand conditions are strong, and lower when 
demand is weak. In this case, cost plus pricing and profit-maximizing pricing 
would both yield approximately the same outcome. The widespread reported use 
of cost plus pricing might suggest that it serves as a convenient rule-of-thumb for 
firms that are really profit maximisers, even if they do not themselves explicitly 
recognise this form of behaviour.
Under what conditions do cost plus pricing and profit-maximizing pricing 
using the rule MR = MC produce identical results? In Section 2.3, it is shown 
that MR can be written as follows:
MR = P a1 -
1
 PED b
where  PED  is the absolute value of the firm’s price elasticity of demand. A 
necessary condition for MR 7 0 is  PED 7 1, or PED 6 - 1. Rearranging 
the previous expression:
MR = P a  PED - 1
 PED
b
Under the profit-maximizing rule MR = MC:
MR = P a  PED - 1
 PED
b 1 P = a
 PED
 PED - 1b MC
If it is assumed that AVC is approximately constant over the range of output 
levels within which production takes place, then MC ≅AVC. Under this 
assumption:
P = a
 PED
 PED - 1b AVC
Using the cost plus pricing formula P = (1 + m)AVC:
1 + m =
 PED
 PED - 1 1 m =
1
 PED - 1
Therefore, cost plus pricing is equivalent to profit-maximizing pricing if AVC 
is approximately constant, and the markup is set to a value of 1/( PED - 1). 
Note that this formula for the markup only produces a positive (and therefore 
meaningful) value for the markup in the case  PED 7 1, the same condition 
that is required for MR 7 0. The more price inelastic the firm’s demand, the 
larger the markup required for profit maximization. When economic conditions 
are depressed,  PED  is likely to be high, in which case the markup consistent 
with profit maximization is small. When economic conditions are more buoy-
ant, the markup consistent with profit maximization is larger. Similarly, when 
competition is intense,  PED  is likely to be high, in which case the markup 
consistent with profit maximization is small. When competition is weaker, the 
markup consistent with profit maximization is larger.

Since Hall and Hitch’s (1939) original paper on cost plus pricing, several 
researchers have investigated firms’ pricing practices, mostly using survey meth-
ods. In a survey of 728 UK manufacturing firms, Shipley (1981) asked respon-
dents to assess the importance of various objectives that might be considered 
when formulating prices. These included: target profitability; target sales rev-
enue; target market share; price stability; stability of sales volume; comparability 
of own prices with those of competitors; and prices perceived as fair by custom-
ers. Many firms reported considering multiple objectives when pricing their prod-
ucts. While profitability was important, it was not the only consideration. Firms 
were more likely to be profit-oriented in industries where competition (measured 
by the number of competing firms) was more intense. Large firms (measured by 
the number of employees) were more likely than small firms to admit to profit-
maximizing behaviour. However, only 16 per cent of all firms considered profit 
maximization to be an overriding objective.
Hall et al. (1996, 2000) report a survey of 654 UK firms, which were asked to 
assess the most important factors they consider when setting prices. The results 
are summarised in Table 14.1. Market conditions were the most important fac-
tor, especially in the case of firms in the construction industry. Competitors’ 
pricing policies were also important, especially in retailing. Around 40 per cent of 
the firms surveyed reported the use of a cost plus pricing method. Smaller firms 
in particular were unlikely to have collected sufficient data on demand conditions 
to be able to use a profit-maximizing (MR = MC) pricing rule.
Álvarez and Hernando (2006) classify pricing practices as either: (i) cost plus 
pricing; (ii) prices set according to competitors’ prices; and (iii) other, where 
the pricing decision is taken by a third-party stakeholder such as a government 
department or quango, a corporate parent company, the main customers, or the 
suppliers. Table 14.2 summarises the results of a survey of euro area firms. Fifty-
four per cent of respondents used cost plus pricing, setting their prices by applying 
a markup to average cost; 27 per cent based their prices on those of competitors; 
while 19 per cent claimed they had no autonomy in determining their prices.

Pricing practice often depends upon whether a firm operates in a highly competi-
tive market, or in an uncompetitive market. Where competition is less intense, cost 
plus pricing tends to be prevalent, and firms are less likely to take competitors’ 
prices into account. These results are consistent across most euro area countries.

firms when reviewing their pricing policies, in response to changes in cost and

demand conditions. For example, is the decision to review prices state-dependent 
(in response to a large shock to demand or costs) or time-dependent (with reviews 
held at regular intervals)? Around two-thirds of the firms surveyed held state-
dependent reviews, while the remainder held time-dependent reviews. Around 
half of the firms surveyed stated that past and expected future economic develop-
ments were taken into account when reviewing prices, but only one-third used 
past data to inform current decisions. Prices were reviewed rather infrequently 
(between one and three times per year), with more frequent reviews being typical 
where competitive pressure was most intense and in service industries. Cost plus 
pricing was the dominant pricing method, followed by pricing with reference to 
competitors’ prices.
	
14.3	
Price discrimination
In most of the theoretical models of firms’ production and pricing decisions 
that have been considered previously in this book, it is assumed the firm sets 
a uniform price which is the same for all consumers, and the same no matter 
how many units of the product each consumer buys. In practice, however, a 
firm that enjoys some degree of market power might consider adopting a more 
complex pricing policy. Consider a product that is produced under uniform 
cost conditions. It might be in the firm’s interest to sell at different prices to 
different consumers, or to make the price per unit that any consumer pays 
dependent on the number of units purchased. The policy of selling different 
units of output at different prices is known as price discrimination (Pigou, 
1920; Phlips, 1983).
Price discrimination is possible only in cases where there are variations in the 
prices charged for a product that is supplied under an identical cost structure no 
matter who the buyer is, or how many units are produced and sold. For example, 
a petrol retailer who charges different prices at an inner-city petrol station and 
at a remote rural petrol station does not adopt a policy of price discrimination 
if the price differential is proportional to the difference in costs (transport costs 
perhaps being higher in the rural location). Conversely (and perhaps paradoxi-
cally), a petrol retailer who charges the same price in two locations where there 
is a cost difference does practice price discrimination, favouring consumers in the 
high-cost location who under a uniform pricing policy would pay a higher price 
to reflect the cost difference. This pricing practice is known as free-on-board 
pricing (see below).
There are three types of price discrimination:
■ First-degree price discrimination, also sometimes known as perfect price dis-
crimination, involves making the price per unit of output depend on the identity 
of the purchaser and on the number of units purchased. First-degree price dis-
crimination is a theoretical construct that is encountered only rarely in practice. 
A possible example would be a private doctor in a small village who does not 
operate a fixed price structure, but instead simply charges their patients on the 
basis of an assessment of their ability to pay.

398	
|	 14    ■    Pricing
■ Second-degree price discrimination involves making the price per unit of output 
depend on the number of units purchased. However, the price does not depend 
on the identity of the purchaser: all consumers who buy a particular number 
of units pay the same price per unit. Discounts for bulk purchases are a com-
mon form of second-degree price discrimination. Other examples of industries 
that adopt this type of pricing structure include the utilities (water, gas and 
electricity) and some high technology industries such as mobile telephones and 
internet services.
■ Third-degree price discrimination involves making the price per unit depend 
on the identity of the purchaser. However, the price does not depend on the 
number of units purchased: any consumer can buy as few or as many units as 
they wish at the same price per unit (Schmalensee, 1981). Common examples 
of third-degree price discrimination include the practice of offering discounts 
to children, students or senior citizens for products such as transport or enter-
tainment. Firms that trade internationally sometimes adopt this type of price 
structure. The term dumping describes the practice of charging a lower price 
to consumers in poorer countries than to those in richer ones.
For a policy of price discrimination to be possible, two conditions must be sat-
isfied. First, the price discriminating firm must enjoy some degree of market 
power, so that it has the discretion to choose its own price structure. For a per-
fectly competitive firm, a policy of price discrimination is not possible. If the firm 
attempts to charge a price in excess of its marginal cost to any segment of the 
market, entry takes place and the increase in supply forces price down until price 
equals marginal cost at the perfectly competitive equilibrium. The successful exer-
cise of price discrimination is sometimes interpreted as proof of market power.
The second necessary condition for successful price discrimination is that the 
market for the product must be divisible into submarkets, within which there 
are different demand conditions (or different price elasticities of demand). These 
submarkets must be physically separate either through space or time, so that sec-
ondary trade or resale between consumers in different submarkets is not possible. 
A firm cannot force Jack to pay more than Jill if it is possible for Jill to purchase 
at the lower price on Jack’s behalf. For example, in the markets for accounting, 
legal and medical services, there is often simultaneity between production and 
consumption, making it difficult or impossible for consumers to resell the service 
between themselves. Similarly, simultaneity between production and consump-
tion enables a cinema to offer discounted admission to children, because it is 
not possible for a child to purchase the right to watch the film at the cheaper 
price and then pass on or resell this right to an adult. But, on the other hand, the 
cinema does not allow children to buy ice cream at a discounted price, because it 
would be easy for children to buy ice cream on their parents’ behalf.
Simultaneity between production and consumption is not the only way in 
which effective separation of submarkets can be achieved. Some newspapers 
are made available to students at a discounted price, despite the fact that resale 
would be possible in theory. However, in practice it would not be worthwhile 
incurring the transaction costs involved in organizing the resale of a newspaper 
for which a cover price discount of (say) 50 per cent represents a saving of only a

few pence. Significant transport costs can also help achieve an effective physical 
separation of submarkets. For example, the practice of dumping surplus agri-
cultural produce in poorer countries relies on transport costs being prohibitive 
if the consumers in poorer countries attempted to resell to their counterparts in 
the richer countries.
First-degree price discrimination
Figure 14.1 illustrates a policy of first-degree price discrimination, exercised by 
a monopoly supplier. First, consider the polar case where the market demand 
function represents a large number of consumers. Depending on the price, each 
consumer either buys one unit of the good, or abstains from buying altogether. 
Each consumer’s reservation price is the maximum price the consumer is willing 
to pay. It is helpful to imagine the consumers arrayed along the horizontal axis 
of Figure 14.1, in descending order of their reservation prices or willingness to 
pay. Therefore the first consumer has a reservation price of P1; the second con-
sumer has a reservation price of P2; and so on. In the standard case where the 
monopolist charges the same price to each consumer, the profit-maximizing price 
and quantity is (PM, QM). Notice that if the monopolist did not have to offer 
the same price to all consumers, it would be worthwhile to supply the consumer 
located just to the right of QM, whose reservation price or willingness to pay is 
slightly lower than PM but still higher than the monopolist’s marginal cost. But, 
in the standard case, the monopolist would have to offer the same price cut to 
all of its existing QM consumers who are located to the left of this point. The loss 
of revenue this would entail exceeds the benefit the monopolist would gain by 
attracting the additional customer. By implementing a policy of first-degree price 
discrimination, however, the monopolist can exploit the differences in willingness 
to pay, by charging each consumer their own reservation price. Therefore the first 
consumer pays a price of P1, the second consumer pays a price of P2 and so on. 
Figure 14.1  First-degree price discrimination

|	 14    ■    Pricing
It is worthwhile for the monopolist to supply all consumers whose reservation 
prices exceed the monopolist’s marginal cost. Therefore total output is QC and 
the most marginal consumer pays a price of PC.
It is also possible to implement a policy of first-degree price discrimination in 
a second polar case, where the market demand function represents one consumer 
who is prepared to buy any number of units of the good, but whose willingness 
to pay decreases as the number of units purchased increases. If the monopolist 
offers a price of P1, the consumer buys only one unit. But if the monopolist offers 
to sell a second unit at a reduced price of P2, the consumer buys two units. If 
reductions in the prices of further units are offered, the consumer is induced to 
buy three, four or five units, and so on. The monopolist could continue in this 
way until the price of the last unit sold equals the monopolist’s marginal cost. 
As before, the monopolist’s total output is QC, and the selling price is PC. At 
(PC, QC) the monopolist obtains a surplus of PCAE.
An alternative way in which the monopolist could obtain the same surplus is 
by charging a two-part tariff. The monopolist offers the consumer a price struc-
ture requiring the payment of a fixed fee (which is mandatory if the consumer 
wishes to make any purchases at all) and an additional uniform price for each 
unit that is purchased. In Figure 14.1, the monopolist’s optimal two-part tariff 
is to charge a fixed fee of PCAE, and a uniform price per unit of PC = MC. 
As before, the total quantity of output produced and sold is QC, and the most 
marginal unit is sold at a price of PC. A two-part tariff price structure is often 
used by golf, tennis or bowling clubs, which charge a fixed annual membership 
fee, and make an additional charge for use of the facilities on each occasion. 
Two-part tariffs are also used by amusement parks and theme parks, such as 
Disneyland, where there is a fixed entry fee and an additional price charged for 
each ride (Oi, 1971).
Figure 14.1 can be used to compare the efficiency and welfare properties of the 
monopolist’s standard profit-maximizing equilibrium at (PM, QM), and the equi-
librium that is achieved with first-degree price discrimination. With first-degree 
price discrimination, the total output of QC is higher than QM in the standard 
case of monopoly. In fact, QC is the total output that would be produced if the 
monopolist were replaced by a large number of perfectly competitive produc-
ers. Furthermore, the equilibrium achieved with first-degree price discrimination 
satisfies the necessary condition for allocative efficiency (see Section 3.4), that 
the price of the most marginal unit of output produced equals the marginal cost 
of producing the last unit.
For a non-discriminating monopolist operating at (PM, QM) consumer surplus 
is represented by the triangle PMAB (triangle in Figure 3.4); producer surplus is 
the monopolist’s abnormal profit of PCPMBD; and the deadweight loss is DBE. 
With first-degree price discrimination there is no consumer surplus, because each 
consumer pays a price equivalent to their maximum willingness to pay for each 
unit. There is a producer surplus of PCAE, which represents the total abnormal 
profit earned by the monopolist by selling each unit at a varying price. Finally, 
the deadweight loss that exists in the non-discriminating case is eliminated.
This analysis leads to what might at first sight seem a rather paradoxical con-
clusion. The monopolist who adopts a policy of first-degree price discrimination 

	
	
	
14.3  Price discrimination	 |	
401
earns an even higher abnormal profit than the monopolist who charges a uniform 
price; but, on allocative efficiency criteria, the outcome under first-degree price 
discrimination is preferable to the outcome in the case of monopoly with uniform 
pricing. The policy of first-degree price discrimination allows the monopolist to 
convert all of the consumer surplus that exists in the non-discriminating case 
into producer surplus and to eliminate the deadweight loss. In other words, the 
monopolist extracts all of the available surplus and earns an even higher abnor-
mal profit. However, this outcome is superior on allocative efficiency criteria, 
for the following reasons:
■ In the non-discriminating case, it is possible to make someone better off with-
out making anyone else worse off, because there is a consumer who is willing 
to pay a price for an extra unit that would exceed the cost of producing this 
extra unit.
■ With first-degree price discrimination it is not possible to make someone better 
off without making anyone else worse off, because price equals marginal cost 
for the most marginal unit produced and sold.
The paradox is resolved by noting that, for allocative efficiency, it does not mat-
ter whether the surplus accrues to consumers or to producers. Welfare econo-
mists do not make value judgements as to whether monopoly profits are good 
or bad. All that matters is that there should be no unexploited opportunities 
for welfare gains that could be achieved without causing losses elsewhere. As 
shown above, such opportunities do exist at the non-discriminating monopoly 
equilibrium (which is therefore allocatively inefficient), but no such opportunities 
exist at the equilibrium under first-degree price discrimination. First-degree price 
discrimination is sometimes known as perfect price discrimination, because all of 
the available surplus is extracted by the monopolist. As shown below, this is not 
the case with either second-degree or third-degree price discrimination.
Second-degree price discrimination
In the case where the market contains a number of consumers with different 
demand functions (or differences in willingness to pay), first-degree price dis-
crimination requires the monopolist to be able to sell to different consumers 
on different terms. However, while the monopolist may be aware that differ-
ent consumers have different demand functions, the monopolist may have no 
practical method for distinguishing between individual consumers. How is the 
monopolist to tell which consumer has which demand function? The consumers 
themselves are not likely to be willing to reveal this information, since doing so 
enables the monopolist to extract all of their consumer surplus. In the case where 
the monopolist cannot distinguish between consumers, the best policy is to offer 
the same menu of prices and quantities to all consumers, and allow the consum-
ers to self-select. In other words, the monopolist designs a menu of prices and 
quantities such that each consumer chooses a price–quantity combination that is 
optimal for the consumer, but which also allows the monopolist to discriminate 
profitably between consumers.

402	
|	 14    ■    Pricing
The two-part tariff that was discussed above can be used to implement a policy 
of second-degree price discrimination. Suppose there are two groups of consum-
ers with different demand functions and different price elasticities of demand. In 
­Figure 14.2, Consumers 1 and 2 are representative consumers from each group 
(and for simplicity it is assumed that there are equal numbers of consumers in 
each group). Consumer 2 buys more units than Consumer 1 at any price, and at 
any given price Consumer 2 has a higher price elasticity of demand than Con-
sumer 1. For simplicity, it is assumed that the maximum price any consumer is 
prepared to pay is the same for both groups; in other words, the demand func-
tions of Consumers 1 and 2 touch the vertical axis at the same point. With a 
policy of first-degree price discrimination, the monopolist would set a fixed fee 
of PCAF for Consumer 1; a fixed fee of PCAG for Consumer 2; and a uniform 
price of PC per unit purchased for both consumers. For second-degree price 
discrimination, however, the monopolist must offer both consumers the same 
menu of prices. Suppose the monopolist continues with the uniform price of PC 
per unit. Which fixed fee should the monopolist set?
■ If the fixed fee is set at the larger value of PCAG, the monopolist extracts all 
of Consumer 2’s surplus, but Consumer 1 drops out of the market altogether, 
and the monopolist fails to extract any surplus from Consumer 1.
■ On the other hand, if the fixed fee is set at the smaller value of PCAF, the 
monopolist extracts all of Consumer 1’s surplus and extracts the same amount 
of surplus from Consumer 2, but fails to extract FAG of Consumer 2’s surplus.
In fact, it can be shown that in some cases neither of these two options is optimal 
for the monopolist. Suppose the second of the two options is preferred to the 
first and the monopolist chooses to supply to both consumers (in which case 
2PCAF 7 PCAG). Using Figure 14.2, it can be shown that the monopolist can 
earn a producer surplus higher than 2PCAF by setting a fixed fee slightly lower 
than PCAF, and charging a uniform price per unit slightly higher than PC. Sup-
pose the monopolist increases the price per unit from PC to PC + ∆P. In order 
for Consumer 1 to remain in the market, the fixed fee must be reduced from 
area W + X + Y(= PCAF) to area W. Consumer 1 purchases Q1 units, and the 
Figure 14.2  Second-degree price discrimination (two-part tariff)

	
	
	
14.3  Price discrimination	 |	
403
producer surplus earned from Consumer 1 is W + X. Previously, the producer 
surplus earned from Consumer 1 was W + X + Y. Therefore the producer loses 
Y from Consumer 1. However, Consumer 2 purchases Q2 units, and the producer 
surplus earned from Consumer 2 is W + X + Y + Z. Previously the producer 
surplus earned from Consumer 2 was W + X + Y. Therefore the producer gains 
Z from Consumer 2. By construction, area Z exceeds area Y. This ensures that 
the monopolist gains overall by increasing the price per unit from PC to PC + ∆P 
and by reducing the fixed fee from W + X + Y to W.
The analysis illustrated in Figure 14.2 establishes that in the case where it is 
profitable for the monopolist to supply both consumers, the optimal two-part 
tariff includes a uniform price that is set at a level higher than the monopolist’s 
marginal cost. The precise determination of the optimal two-part tariff is a rather 
complex mathematical problem and beyond the scope of this book. The complex-
ity is even greater in the more realistic case in which there is a large number of 
consumer types, each with their own demand functions. However, one important 
result is that with second-degree price discrimination, the monopolist cannot 
extract as much surplus as is possible with a policy of first-degree price discrimi-
nation. In Figure 14.2, if the monopolist sets a uniform menu of prices which 
does not vary between the two consumers, no uniform two-part tariff will enable 
the monopolist to extract a surplus as large as PCAF + PCAG. It is natural to 
expect that a policy of first-degree price discrimination, which is based on perfect 
information about consumers’ preferences, is more profitable than second-degree 
price discrimination, which is based on imperfect information.
Third-degree price discrimination
In the case of second-degree price discrimination, the monopolist cannot seg-
ment the market by distinguishing between consumers, and must offer the same 
menu of prices to each consumer. However, the menu of prices is constructed 
in such a way that the price per unit that each consumer pays depends on the 
number of units purchased. This is true even in the case of the two-part tariff: 
if a larger quantity is purchased, the average price per unit is lower because the 
fixed fee is spread over a larger number of units. In contrast, with a policy of 
third-degree price discrimination, the price per unit that each consumer pays is 
constant, but the monopolist can segment the market by offering different prices 
to different consumers.
In practice, the monopolist is unlikely to have sufficient information to 
achieve complete market segmentation, since this would require perfect infor-
mation about each consumer’s individual demand function. However, partial 
market segmentation may be achieved quite easily in cases where consumers can 
be divided into groups based on easily identifiable characteristics, such as age 
or membership of particular groups such as students or pensioners. For partial 
market segmentation to be effective, the nature of the individual’s demand func-
tion must be correlated with the identifying characteristic. This condition is often 
satisfied. A child’s demand for admission to a cinema is likely to be more price 
elastic than that of an adult. A pensioner’s demand for bus travel, or a student’s 
demand for a newspaper, is more price elastic than that of other adults.

Therefore, with third-degree price discrimination, the monopolist segments 
the market into groups, charges the same price per unit sold within each group, 
but charges different prices to members of different groups. Figure 14.3 illus-
trates the case where there are two groups of consumers. As before, Consumers 
1 and 2, shown in the two left-hand diagrams, are representative consumers from 
each group. It is assumed that Consumer 2’s demand is more price elastic than 
that of Consumer 1. Since the price must be uniform within each submarket but 
the submarkets are perfectly segmented, it turns out that the monopolist’s opti-
mal pricing policy is to operate as a monopoly supplier to each submarket. The 
monopolist should select the price–quantity combination for each submarket 
at which the submarket’s marginal revenue equals the monopolist’s marginal 
cost. Therefore, in Figure 14.3, the monopolist charges a relatively high price of 
P1 to Consumer 1 whose demand is price inelastic, and a relatively low price of 
P2 to Consumer 2 whose demand is price elastic. For reference, in Figure 14.3 
the right-hand diagram shows the market demand function (obtained by sum-
ming the consumers’ individual demand functions horizontally), and the profit-
maximizing price–quantity combination (PM, QM) in the standard case, where 
the monopolist charges a uniform price to all consumers.
It is not possible to draw many general conclusions about the welfare effects 
of third-degree price discrimination. In comparison with the non-discriminating 
case (where the monopolist charges a uniform price to all consumers regardless of 
subgroup membership) the sum of producer surplus and consumer surplus may 
be higher, lower or the same, depending on the exact positions of the submarket 
demand functions. However, two unequivocal conclusions are possible. First, 
the monopolist’s abnormal profit (producer surplus) is always higher in the case 
of third-degree price discrimination than in the non-discriminating case. The 
monopolist does not segment the market and charge different prices to different 
submarkets unless it is profitable to do so. Second, in the case where there are 
two submarkets, one price will always be higher and the other price lower than 
the uniform monopoly price in the non-discriminating case. Consumers in the 
submarket with the higher price have less consumer surplus and are always worse 
off than in the non-discriminating case; conversely, consumers in the submarket

with the lower price have more consumer surplus and are always better off than 
in the non-discriminating case (Yamey, 1974; Layson, 1994). Appendix 1 con-
tains a mathematical derivation of profit maximization under third-degree price 
discrimination.
Examples of price discrimination
Section 14.3 concludes by identifying a number of examples of price discrimina-
tion other than those that have been discussed previously in this section, and 
Case Study 14.1 identifies some practical applications to ticket pricing in foot-
ball’s Premier League.
Case study 14.1
Price discrimination in ticket price structures  
for English Premier League football
In Case Study 2.2, it was shown that understanding the determinants of spectator demand 
is important to clubs when making decisions about stadium capacity and ticket pricing. In 
a survey of English Premier League football clubs carried out during the 1998–9 season, 
Clowes and Clements (2003) find clubs use a wide range of sophisticated ticket-pricing 
structures.
In accordance with the economic theory of price discrimination, several of these price 
structures are designed to extract more value from spectators with differing degrees of 
willingness-to-pay than would be possible with a uniform ticket price structure. Several 
examples can be found of both second-degree price discrimination (charging different 
prices depending on the number of matches attended) and third-degree price discrimina-
tion (charging different prices to different spectators or groups of spectators).
Season tickets
Buying an annual season ticket normally offers three benefits:
■ A guaranteed seat for every home match.
■ Priority allocation of tickets for away matches, cup finals, and so on.
■ An effective discount on the price of buying tickets for each match individually (sec-
ond-degree price discrimination).
In the 1998–9 survey, the size of the discount varied from zero to about 35 per cent. Two 
clubs charged season ticket premiums: a policy that might be justified in economic terms 
if the stadium is regularly filled to capacity.

406	
|	 14    ■    Pricing
Membership schemes
Membership schemes that require payment of a fixed membership fee, but then allow 
members to purchase match tickets at a discounted price, are a form of two-part tariff 
(second-degree price discrimination).
Some clubs run separate membership schemes for juniors, with separate prices. Some 
junior membership schemes give members the right to receive a package of ‘free’ merchandise.
Personal seat licence (PSL)
In the US, some major league teams charge a fee that guarantees the right to purchase a 
season ticket for a particular seat over the long term (20 or 30 years). PSLs typically lapse 
if the holder dies or fails to renew the season ticket (Sandy et al., 2004). A PSL is also a 
form of two-part tariff (second-degree price discrimination).
In the US, PSLs are common among new (expansion) teams or teams that have relo-
cated to a new city. Unsurprisingly, the idea has been more difficult to sell to the existing 
season ticket holders of established teams. Several attempts to introduce similar schemes 
by English football clubs in the early 1990s were unpopular with spectators, and the idea 
failed to take off.
Price concessions
Price concessions to specific groups are a form of third-degree price discrimination. The 
1998–9 survey found that all Premier League clubs that responded offered discounts on 
season tickets or match-day tickets (or both) to juniors, pensioners and people with dis-
abilities. Some (but not all) clubs offered discounts to students and the unemployed. How-
ever, perhaps surprisingly only a small number of clubs offered discounts to family groups.
Price banding
In the 1998–9 survey, seven English Premier League clubs indicated that ticket prices were 
dependent on the attractiveness of the opposition, with home fixtures classified into two 
or three price bands.
This practice is consistent with profit maximization. If the PED (price elasticity of 
demand) is lower for a fixture against Manchester United than for a fixture against aver-
age Premier League opposition, the profit-maximizing club should charge a higher price 
for the more attractive fixture. This policy is not price discrimination, since different 
prices are charged for different matches with different characteristics.
Good and bad seats
Most English football clubs charge different prices for seats in different locations within 
the stadium. This policy is not price discrimination, since different prices are charged for 
what are essentially different products.

	
	
	
14.3  Price discrimination	 |	
407
The demand functions for seats in different locations are likely to be interdependent:
■ If the club sets too large a price differential, there is likely to be excess demand for the 
cheaper seats.
■ If the price differential is too small, demand will tend to switch towards the dearer 
seats.
Most clubs tend to rely on experience or trial-and-error in order to determine the most 
appropriate price differential.
Price bundling
In the 1998–9 survey, eight English Premier League clubs operated a policy of bundling. 
Either tickets for two or more matches must be bought simultaneously, or proof of pur-
chase of a ticket for one match is required to purchase a ticket for another match.
A common practice is to bundle a sell-out match together with a match that is unlikely 
to sell out. Bundling is also justified as an attempt to reduce the possibility of away sup-
porters of popular teams purchasing tickets in the home sections of the stadium.

Intertemporal price discrimination
With intertemporal price discrimination, the supplier segments the market by 
the point in time at which the product is purchased by different groups of con-
sumers. Video games, mobile telephone handsets, books, CDs and DVDs are 
examples of goods that are often more expensive if they are purchased earlier, 
but cheaper for consumers who are prepared to delay purchase. In the case of 
books, there is a physical difference between the expensive hardback edition that 
is available when the book is first published, and the cheaper paperback edition 
that appears several months later. However, the retail price differential is usu-
ally much larger than the difference in production costs between hardbacks and 
paperbacks. Therefore despite the physical difference, this case conforms to the 
model of intertemporal price discrimination. Case study 14.2 which examines 
cinema ticket pricing is an example of intertemporal price discrimination.
Figure 14.4 shows the market demand function in the case where there is a 
large number of consumers, each of whom either buys one unit of the good or 
abstains from buying altogether (as in Figure 14.1). Each consumer’s reservation 
price is the maximum price the consumer is willing to pay, and as before it is help-
ful to imagine the consumers arrayed along the horizontal axis of Figure 14.4 in 
descending order of their reservation prices or willingness to pay. For the model

Case study 14.2
Flexible cinema seat pricing may be a force  
to be reckoned with
FT
After a fallow 2014, Hollywood last year released a plethora of blockbuster movies: 
between them, the new James Bond, Marvel Avengers and The Hunger Games films, 
Jurassic World and the Pixar smash Inside Out took £274m at the UK box office. Then 
there was Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Released at the end of the year, it made £108m 
in its first month, a new record in the UK.
The challenge for cinemas is to make hay while the sun shines — and that involves being 
more sophisticated about how they price tickets and sell out their theatres. ‘The seats you 
do not sell today do not make you any money tomorrow,’ says Ian Shepherd, the chief 
commercial officer of Odeon, the UK’s largest cinema chain by the number of venues. 
‘From our company’s point of view, you want as many people filling as many seats as 
possible.’ Until now, he says, the cinema industry has solved its problem in a simple way. 
Prices have varied a little bit depending on time or day of the week and whether the cus-
tomer is a student, a child or a pensioner. Other than that, pricing has been pretty static, 
he says, adding: ‘What we have been doing for the past year is to say that this simple 
solution is suboptimal for everyone.’
The Odeon group is experimenting with a flexible ticketing model, pioneered by air-
lines and hotels. This will see prices change in real time depending on demand. ‘We 
are experimenting in a small way in one or two cinemas that are not in the UK,’ says 
Mr Shepherd. ‘The early results have been very positive.’ But while he suggests the chain 
would eventually move to a fully dynamic pricing system, this is still some way off. Until 
then, Odeon and other cinema companies have started to price their tickets to reflect the 
value to customers of being one of the first to see a newly released blockbuster. ‘In the 
opening couple of weeks of a very large film, when you know you are going to be sold 
out, we are adding £1 on a ticket, sometimes a tiny bit more. The logic that says tickets 
are more expensive when there is lots of demand is something that people get,’ he says. 
Some seats may become more expensive than others. Mr Shepherd points out that it is 
normal in Germany for every seat to be individually priced.
The chain is also being cleverer about selling tickets to less popular films. ‘We are doing 
Groupon deals, online flash sales and time-banded promotions. We use social media or email 
to put out a flash sale. As a result, our market share has increased,’ he says. The logic that 
says tickets are more expensive when there is lots of demand is something that people get.

of intertemporal price discrimination, it is assumed that each consumer is will-
ing to make their purchase in one of two time periods. Consumers who make a 
purchase in period 1 do not make a repeat purchase in period 2, but consumers 

	
	
	
14.3  Price discrimination	 |	
409
Figure 14.4  Intertemporal price discrimination
who abstain from purchasing in period 1 (because the period 1 price exceeds 
their reservation price) still have the same reservation price in period 2. It is also 
assumed that consumers who purchased in period 1 do not subsequently resell 
to consumers who abstained from purchasing in period 1.
For simplicity, in Figure 14.4 it is assumed that a monopoly supplier has a 
constant marginal cost function. In period 1, the monopolist’s profit-maximizing 
price and output combination is (P1, Q1). However, under the conditions out-
lined above, in period 2 the monopolist effectively faces a residual demand func-
tion comprising all consumers whose reservation price is below P1, equivalent 
to the triangle Q1AB. MR2 is the marginal revenue function associated with 
the residual demand function, and in period 2 the profit-maximizing price and 
output combination is (P2, Q2 - Q1). The Q2 - Q1 consumers who purchase in 
period 2 pay a lower price than the Q1 consumers who purchase in period 1. If 
the model were extended over further periods with similar assumptions, more 
consumers (to the right of Q2) could be induced to make purchases by means of 
further price cuts.
Coase (1972) points out that the ability of a monopolist to practise intertem-
poral price discrimination may be limited by strategic behaviour on the part of 
consumers. If the monopolist acquires a reputation for price-cutting, even those 
consumers with a high willingness to pay may decide to delay their consumption, 
so as to obtain an increased surplus by purchasing at the reduced price at a later 
date. The extent to which consumers are prepared to do so depends on the dura-
bility of the good (is it worth the same tomorrow as it is worth today?) and the 
discount rate consumers use to evaluate the present value of future consumption. 
In an extreme case in which the good is perfectly durable and the discount rate 
is zero (consumers are indifferent between present and future consumption), the 
monopolist is forced to charge the competitive price in all periods. Anticipating 
that the monopolist will eventually reduce the price to the perfectly competitive 

410	
|	 14    ■    Pricing
level, all consumers decide to delay purchase rather than pay more than the 
perfectly competitive price. This forces the monopolist to charge the perfectly 
competitive price from the outset.
Brand labels
The practice of charging different prices for similar or identical goods differenti-
ated solely by a brand label can be interpreted as a form of price discrimination. 
In supermarkets, value brands sell at a substantial discount relative to the brands 
of recognised manufacturers, even though in some cases the difference in quality 
is small or non-existent. In the clothing market, some consumers are willing to 
pay £20 or £30 more for a small badge or emblem sewn onto an otherwise identi-
cal T-shirt or pair of jeans. But it can be argued that branding does not conform 
to the model of price discrimination, because the status or prestige conferred 
by the purchase or ownership of the branded product should be recognised as 
a genuine product characteristic, for which suppliers of branded products are 
entitled to charge if consumers are willing to pay.
Loyalty discounts
Major airlines offering air miles schemes that can be used by frequent travel-
lers to earn free tickets, practise a form of second-degree price discrimina-
tion. Consumers who travel frequently pay a lower average price per journey 
than consumers who make only single or occasional journeys. Many airlines 
allow air miles to be earned from purchases of other products, making it pos-
sible to travel without ever paying directly for a ticket. Supermarkets, such as 
Tesco, which operate loyalty or bonus points schemes providing coupons or 
rebates to regular customers, operate a similar form of second-degree price 
discrimination.
Coupons
Some retailers supply coupons that provide price discounts, perhaps through 
advertisements printed in the newspapers or through leaflets delivered directly to 
people’s homes. In principle, the price discount is available to any consumer but, 
in practice, only those consumers willing to spend the time and make the effort 
required to cut out, retain and present the coupon will obtain the discount. This 
practice can be interpreted as a form of price discrimination, favouring those 
consumers with more time or lower opportunity costs, who are prepared to make 
the effort to collect and present the coupon.
Stock clearance
A department store that conducts a sale in which the price of merchandise is 
successively reduced until all sale items have been purchased exercises a form 
of price discrimination, if this practice results in different consumers paying dif-
ferent prices on different days for identical goods. This pricing practice can be 

	
	
	
14.3  Price discrimination	 |	
411
interpreted as a form of intertemporal price discrimination. For a single item 
that is successively reduced in price until it is eventually sold, this procedure for 
finding a buyer is known as a Dutch auction. The theory and practice of auctions 
is discussed in Chapter 15.
Metering
Metering price discrimination is the practice of charging consumers a rela-
tively low price for a primary product, and a relatively high price for a sec-
ondary product that is tied to the primary product (Oi, 1971; Schmalensee, 
1981; Rosen and Rosenfield, 1997; Ellison, 2005; Gil and Hartmann, 2008). 
Consumers who are highly price-sensitive, and who would not be willing to 
pay for the primary product if it were priced at a higher level, can purchase the 
primary product but abstain from purchase of the secondary product. Con-
sumers who are less price-sensitive, and who would be willing to pay a higher 
price for the primary product, may be willing to purchase both products. The 
seller is compensated for the low profit margin on the primary product by real-
izing a high margin on the tied secondary product. Effectively, the two groups 
of consumers are charged at different levels for the package that each chooses 
to purchase: either the primary product alone, or the primary and secondary 
products in combination.
Examples of metering price discrimination include tickets for concerts or 
sporting events (the primary product) that might be priced competitively so that 
the stadium is filled, while food and drinks concessions located inside the stadium 
charge prices much higher than the local supermarket that is located outside. 
Retailers of white goods (electronic domestic appliances such as refrigerators and 
washing machines) might offer the basic product at a highly competitive price 
to attract consumers into the store, but then attempt to persuade customers to 
purchase an extended warranty or guarantee that provides the retailer with a 
large profit margin.
Free-on-board pricing
In some markets, producers or distributors absorb transport costs, so that all 
buyers within a specific geographic area (country or region) pay a uniform price, 
despite the variation in transport costs within this area. This pricing system is 
known as free-on-board pricing. As noted above, even though all prices are the 
same, free-on-board pricing is a form of price discrimination which favours buy-
ers in the more remote locations where transport costs are higher. The difference 
in costs means these buyers should pay more. Therefore the policy of charging 
the same price is a form of price discrimination. From the point of view of sup-
pliers, a uniform pricing policy may be attractive because, by eliminating price 
discrepancies, it reduces the risk that price competition may break out among 
suppliers. Free-on-board pricing removes any temptation for an individual sup-
plier to implement a price cut, which might be justified to competitors on grounds 
of reduced transport costs, but might actually be motivated by an attempt to 
capture an increased market share.

The price of being female
FT
Does a dollar in my pocket buy more than a dollar in my wife’s? It seems so, according 
to a report released just before Christmas by New York City’s Department of Consumer 
Affairs, which was much covered in the US media. The DCA report found that men 
often paid less for clothes and items such as razor blades and shampoo. Even boys’ toys 
are cheaper than those aimed at girls. The report led with a striking example from a 
department store website: while a red ‘My 1st Scooter Sport’ costs $24.99, a pink ‘My 
1st Scooter Girls Sparkle’ is twice as much. Beneath the paint job, the products appear 
to be identical — surely glitter cannot be that expensive? The sparkly scooter was sold at 
an astonishing mark-up but it’s not a typical case. The DCA report looked at 22 bikes 
and scooters, finding that on average the product aimed at girls or women cost 6 per cent 
more. Across 800 products, the DCA found that while men sometimes paid more than 
women, on average women faced prices that were 7 per cent higher. Relative to profit 
margins this is still a large price difference but it’s a long way shy of 100 per cent.
What should we make of this? One response is that perhaps the price gap isn’t really 
there or at least not in any systematic way. Perhaps the DCA unwittingly cherry-picked 
examples. (Sports cars and hi-fi systems were not included.) Whether or not systematic 
gender-based pricing is widespread, it will always be easy to find examples that look sex-
ist. Still, other research has reached similar conclusions. For example, a study published 
in Gender Issues in 2011 by Megan Duesterhaus and others found that ‘gendered price 
disparities are not as widespread as . . . journalists have previously reported but it does 
appear that women pay more for certain goods (deodorant), services in hair salons (hair-
cuts), and dry-cleaning of shirts’. Why? No single theory will suffice. Car insurers and 
nightclub owners both want to charge more to men, but not for the same reason.
Broadly, there are two types of explanation. One is that higher prices reflect higher 
costs. Maybe men’s haircuts typically require less time and skill than women’s haircuts. 
It’s said that women’s blouses cost more to clean and iron at a dry-cleaner’s because they 
are delicate and need to be pressed by hand. Still: why not charge by the hour to provide 
a haircut? Or charge for hand-pressed clothes, regardless of gender? Restaurants do not 
charge men more on the grounds that they usually eat more; instead, they charge by the 
dish. I can only speculate as to why hairdressers act differently.
The alternative explanation is that companies are making fatter margins on women’s 
products and services. Economists call this ‘price discrimination’, and it would suggest 
that women pay more than men if and when they are less sensitive to prices. Perhaps 
manufacturers and retailers have found that if they try to raise the price of razor blades 
or shampoo, men will shop elsewhere or skimp on the product, while women will will-
ingly pay the higher price. This female insensitivity to price — if it really exists — might 
be driven by all kinds of things. Perhaps women tend to be busier and have less time to 
shop around. Or perhaps they care more about quality when it comes to deodorant or 
shampoo, whereas men just want something cheap.

	
	
	
14.4  Peak-load pricing	 |	
413
But even if women are potentially willing to pay extortionate rates for certain kinds of 
goods, it doesn’t mean that companies can exploit that willingness. A lot of the businesses 
most regularly accused of sexist pricing — hairdressers, dry cleaners and nail salons — 
operate in the face of almost unlimited potential competition. If all of them are operating 
on razor-thin margins for men and fat margins for women, shouldn’t they be desperately 
trying to win female customers away from each other? This competitive pressure will con-
strain attempts to discriminate on price. It is the big brands — such as Ferrari, Hermès and 
perhaps Gillette — who have the power to charge different mark-ups to different customers.
As soon as a company acquires some market power, it will try to give spendthrift cus-
tomers an opportunity to display their spendthriftiness by offering costly variants on basic 
products. Publishers ask double for a book with hard covers; coffee chains charge a lot 
for squirting flavoured syrup in your latte. We can hardly be surprised if some of these 
special variants look pink and sparkly. And as consumers, male or female, our only resort 
is to keep searching for the products without those frills, literal or otherwise.

Peak-load pricing
In some markets, demand varies at different times of the day or on different 
days of the year. Examples of products or services for which demand is vari-
able include: gas and electricity; public transport services; roads, tunnels and 
bridges; gyms and fitness clubs; and package holidays and amusement parks. 
In each of these cases, it is unlikely that the supplier can adjust capacity to meet 
the higher level of demand in peak periods, or reduce capacity in response to the 
lower level of demand in off-peak periods. Furthermore, none of these products 
or services is storable. It is not possible for consumers to build up stocks during 
off-peak periods, and then run down these stocks during peak periods. Under 
such conditions, the supplier faces a peak-load pricing problem. Specifically, two 
issues need to be addressed: first, what level of capacity should be installed; and 
second, for any given capacity what are the optimal peak period and off-peak 
period prices.
In order to develop a model to address these questions, it is assumed there are 
separate peak period and off-peak period market demand functions, denoted D1 
and D2 respectively. In Figure 14.5, it is assumed these two demand functions 
are completely independent of one another: purchases made in one period do 
not in any way affect demand in the other period. Capacity can be installed and 
maintained at a constant marginal cost per unit of capacity of b, which allows the 
industry to operate in both the peak period and the off-peak period. Production 
costs in each period are directly proportional to output, so there is also a constant 
marginal production cost of c per unit of output.

414	
|	 14    ■    Pricing
Figure 14.5  Peak-load pricing: full capacity production in both periods
In many countries, some (although not all) of the industries that are subject to 
the peak-load problem are either in state ownership, or in private ownership but 
heavily regulated. Accordingly, much of the theoretical literature on peak-load 
pricing is based on an assumption of social welfare maximization, rather than 
profit maximization. As shown in Section 3.4, the standard condition for social 
welfare maximization is price equals marginal cost. In the present case, this con-
dition needs to be amended, because for each additional unit of capacity that is 
installed, one additional unit of output can be produced and sold in each of the 
two periods, at different prices. If the industry operates at full capacity in both 
periods, the equivalent condition for social welfare maximization is:
 
P1 + P2 = b + 2c
or
P1 + P2 - 2c = b
or
P1 = b + 2c - P2 and P2 = b + 2c - P1
In these expressions, P1 and P2 are the prices charged per unit of output in 
the peak period and off-peak period, respectively. The first of the three expres-
sions says the total proceeds obtained by creating an additional unit of capacity 
enabling the industry to produce and sell one additional unit of output in both 
periods, P1 + P2, equals the marginal cost of installing the additional capacity, 
b, plus the marginal production cost for the two additional units of output, 2c. 
The second expression is a rearrangement of the first, used to identify the optimal 
prices and capacity in Figure 14.5. The third expression says the optimal price 
for each period is the total marginal cost incurred through the installation of

415
Figure 14.6  Peak-load pricing: spare capacity in off-peak period
additional capacity and the additional production in both periods, b + 2c, minus 
the price charged in the other period.
In Figure 14.5, the broken line shows, for each per-period output level shown 
on the horizontal axis, the value of P1 + P2 - 2c implied by the two market 
demand functions. Over the range of output levels where P1 7 c and P2 7 c, 
the broken line is constructed by summing the two demand functions vertically, 
and subtracting 2c. Over the range of outputs where P1 7 c 7 P2, the broken 
line is P1 - c. According to the expressions for social welfare maximization, 
in Figure 14.5 the optimal capacity is Q1 = Q2, and the optimal values of P1 
and P2 are obtained from the peak and off-peak demand functions (D1 and D2 
respectively) at this point. The peak-period consumers, whose demand or will-
ingness to pay is stronger, are charged a higher price than the off-peak consum-
ers. However, the willingness to pay of consumers in both periods is taken into 
account in determining the optimal capacity, because the system operates at full 
capacity in both periods.
It need not always be the case that the industry operates at full capacity in 
both periods. If the marginal cost of installing additional capacity were lower 
than is shown in Figure 14.5, it might be optimal (again in terms of social welfare 
maximization) to operate at full capacity during the peak period, but to maintain 
some spare capacity in the off-peak period. This case is shown in Figure 14.6, in 
which the marginal cost of installing additional capacity is lowered from b to b′. 
For the peak period, it is now worthwhile to install capacity of Q1′, and sell Q1′ 
units of output for a price of P1′ = b′ + c. For the off-peak period, however,

Brussels is targeting Disneyland Paris for allegedly overcharging British and German cus-
tomers on the basis of where they live, in the opening salvo of a broader campaign against 
price discrimination in Europe. The European Commission on Tuesday told France to 
investigate whether the theme park is unfairly rigging prices, pointing out that in some 
cases, for the same premium package, French consumers will pay €1,346 while British 
visitors are charged €1,870 and Germans €2,447. Unless companies meet strictly defined 
criteria, the EU services directive in principle bans forcing consumers to pay more simply 
because of their nationality or country of residence.
The Brussels clampdown has broader implications for the retail and services sector: the 
commission is weighing complaints against Amazon, Spanish hoteliers, Austrian ski-lift 
operators — even Venice’s public lavatory system. Consumers have accused Disneyland 
Paris of illegally blocking their access to cheap deals available to residents of France or 
Belgium. This is mostly achieved through residence-based payment and delivery rules, 
selective offers, or by redirecting consumers to more expensive prices on their national 
websites. Elzbieta Bienkowska, the EU commissioner for the single market, said a spate 
of complaints ‘were very significant, particularly in one or two instances’. ‘It is time to 
get to the bottom of this,’ she said. ‘I am interested in answers and explanations. On the 
face of it, I struggle to see what objective justification there could be for these practices.’
A spokesperson for BEUC, the European consumers’ group, welcomed the Com-
mission taking steps to enforce its rulebook and ‘clarify what constitutes an unjustified 
discrimination’. ‘Geoblocking can lead to price discrimination, is against single mar-
ket principles and restricts consumer choice,’ the spokesperson said. The initial findings 
found British consumers paying around 15 per cent more for one-day tickets, according to 
the preliminary EU assessment. French consumers also benefit from other perks, includ-
ing large family discounts, special rates, annual packages, monthly payment options and 
offers to buy tickets at one Disneyland park rather than two.
Under EU rules prices can be varied according to nationality if there are objective rea-
sons, such as different market conditions, seasonal fluctuations in demand or different 
holiday periods. Disneyland Paris says that its promotions in local markets are based on 
booking patterns and school holidays. However a Commission ‘sweep’ of Disneyland Paris’ 
if Q1′ units of output were produced, the price would fall below the marginal 
production cost of c. In the off-peak period, the industry should operate below 
full capacity, and sell Q2′ units of output for a price of P2′ = c. In this case, the 
willingness to pay of the off-peak consumers becomes irrelevant in determining 
the optimal capacity, because the system only operates at capacity during the 
peak period.

rivals in Europe — including Denmark’s Legoland and Tivoli Gardens and ­Germany’s 
Europapark — found that other operators did not vary prices to the same extent.
Ms Bienkowska’s assault on price discrimination is part of a broader Commission push 
to eradicate so-called geo-blocking in Europe, where consumer IP addresses or payment 
cards are used to bar them from certain services. A separate Commission competition 
case, launched last week, accused top Hollywood studios and Sky UK of entering illegal 
agreements to stop EU consumers from accessing pay-TV services available in the UK 
and Ireland. All the companies are contesting the charges.
If no action is taken by France against Disneyland, the Commission can ultimately take 
France to court. When faced with similar regulatory objections last year, car rental com-
panies in Europe agreed to stop rerouting consumers to their national websites. Critics of 
the ‘price discrimination’ clampdown argue the practice is a legitimate pricing model that 
allows companies to be responsive to differences in local markets in Europe and avoid 
one-size-fits all prices.
Disneyland Paris defended its pricing policy, saying it ran well-justified discounts 
and promotions in local markets. ‘When purchased directly with Disneyland Paris, the 
cost of a basic resort package — without promotional offers — is identical across all 
markets, give or take exchange rates,’ the company said. ‘Throughout the year we try to 
attract guests from different markets by offering market-specific “book-by” promotions 
that can include discounts. Those promotions take into consideration factors specific to 
people in the local market, such as their school holiday calendar and booking patterns.’ 
It added that consumers can contact the central reservations office if they see a promo-
tion outside their local market ‘and request to make that specific booking’.

Transfer pricing
The multi-divisional or M-form organizational structure, and the holding com-
pany or H-form structure (see Section 5.3) can raise particularly difficult issues 
for managers when taking pricing and production decisions. It is often the case 
that one division will use the output of another division as one of its inputs. 
In the simplest case, an M-form or H-form organization might include quasi-
independent production and distribution divisions. The distribution division 
buys the output of the production division, and sells the product to the final 
consumer. The question immediately arises, at what price should the trade take 
place between the production division and the distribution division? In general, 
the M-form or H-form organization requires a system of transfer pricing to deter-
mine the prices of intermediate products that are produced by one division and 
sold to another division, when both divisions form part of the same organization 
(Hirschleifer, 1956).

418	
|	 14    ■    Pricing
In M-form or H-form organizations where the individual divisions are quasi-
independent, the choice of transfer price can be a crucial decision, because it 
affects the imputed revenues of the selling division, the imputed costs of the buying 
division, and therefore the imputed profitability of both divisions. For example, 
if the transfer price is set too low, the imputed profits of the distribution division 
are artificially inflated, and the profits of the production division are artificially 
depressed. This may have implications for head office’s perceptions of managerial 
performance or labour productivity in both divisions, which in turn may affect 
future investment or other internal resource allocation decisions (Eccles, 1985). 
Moreover, suppose the divisional managers are encouraged to operate in such a 
way as to minimise costs or maximise profits at divisional level. Through its effect 
on the divisional revenue and cost functions, the transfer price affects the divi-
sional managers’ production decisions, the volume of internal trade, the quantity 
of inputs purchased from outside the firm or the quantity of intermediate out-
puts sold outside the firm and, therefore, the profitability of the firm as a whole. 
As shown below, when there is internal trade within the organization, decisions 
taken at divisional level with a view to the maximization of divisional profits do 
not necessarily ensure the maximization of the total profit of the firm as a whole.
Below, profit-maximizing models of transfer pricing between the production 
and distribution divisions of an M-form organization are developed, for the fol-
lowing three cases:
■ In the first case, it is assumed all of the production division’s output is passed 
on to the distribution division to be sold to final consumers. There is no alterna-
tive, external market in which the production division can sell its intermediate 
output. Similarly, the distribution division obtains its supplies only from the 
production division and has no alternative external sources.
■ In the second case, it is assumed there is a perfectly competitive external mar-
ket, in which the production division can sell any surplus intermediate output 
that is not taken up by the distribution division. Similarly, the distribution 
division has the option of obtaining additional supplies (over and above those 
it obtains from the production division) through the external market.
■ In the third case, it is assumed the external market for the intermediate prod-
uct is imperfectly competitive rather than perfectly competitive.
Transfer pricing with no external market for the intermediate 
product
Figure 14.7 presents a model of transfer pricing for trade between a production 
division (producer) and a distribution division (distributor) in the simplest case 
where there is no external market for the internally transferred product. In the 
left-hand diagram, MC1 represents the producer’s marginal cost function, and 
in the right-hand diagram D2 and MR2 represent the distributor’s demand and 
marginal revenue functions. MC2 is the marginal cost function associated with 
the distributor’s own activities (excluding the cost of the units of output the dis-
tributor must purchase from the producer).

	
	
	
14.5  Transfer pricing	 |	
419
Suppose, initially, the distributor sets the transfer price and the producer fol-
lows price-taking behaviour in respect of this price. The distributor knows the 
chosen transfer price will be treated by the producer as the latter’s marginal 
revenue function, and the producer will choose the output level at which the 
transfer price equals the producer’s marginal cost, MC1. To maximise the profit 
of the firm as a whole, the distributor should operate as if its total marginal cost 
function is MC2 + MC1, obtained by adding the value of MC1 at each output 
level vertically onto MC2. The distributor chooses the output level Q1 at which 
MC2 + MC1 = MR2. This determines the transfer price P1, which induces the 
producer to produce Q1 units of output. The distributor sells the product to the 
final consumers at a price of PF.
Suppose, instead, the producer sets the transfer price, and the distributor 
follows price-taking behaviour. In this case, the same result is obtained. The 
distributor’s total marginal cost function is MC2 + P, where P is the transfer 
price chosen by the producer. The producer knows that for any value of P the 
producer chooses, the distributor is willing to purchase the output level at which 
MC2 + P = MR2. To maximise the profit of the firm as a whole, the producer 
should set a transfer price of P1, as before.
In both cases, P1 is the transfer price that maximises the firm’s total profit. In 
Figure 14.7, the area OBC represents the firm’s total profit; OAC represents the 
profit imputed to the producer; and ABC represents the profit imputed to the 
distributor. However, it is interesting to note that a transfer price of P1 does not 
maximise the profits of either the producer or the distributor individually. In the 
case where the distributor sets the transfer price, the distributor maximises its 
own profit by choosing the output level at which the distributor’s marginal outlay 
function equals MR2 (see Figure 14.8). The distributor’s marginal outlay func-
tion is steeper than MC2 + MC1, because it takes into account the fact that for 
each extra unit the distributor buys from the producer, the distributor pays not 
only the producer’s marginal cost of producing that unit, but also an increased 
transfer price over all the other units the distributor was already buying. It would 
be in the distributor’s private interest to buy a smaller quantity Q1′ at a lower 
Figure 14.7  Transfer pricing: no external market for intermediate product

|	 14    ■    Pricing
transfer price of P2, increasing the distributor’s imputed profit from ABC to 
A′BDE in Figure 14.8. The producer’s imputed profit falls from OAC to OA′E, 
and the firm’s total profit falls from OBC to OBDE.
Similarly, in the case where the producer sets the transfer price, the producer 
maximises its own profit by choosing the output level at which the producer’s 
marginal revenue function equals MC2 + MC1. The producer’s marginal revenue 
function takes account of the fact that at very low output levels the distributor 
would be willing to pay a high transfer price, but as output increases, the transfer 
price is reduced not only on the most marginal unit bought, but also over all the 
other units the distributor was already buying (see Figure 14.9). It would be in the 
producer’s private interest to supply a smaller quantity Q1″ at a higher transfer 
price of P3, increasing the producer’s imputed profit from OAC to OA″FG in 
Figure 14.9. The distributor’s imputed profit falls from ABC to A″BF, and the 
firm’s total profit falls from OBC to OBFG.
Transfer pricing with a perfectly competitive external market 
for the intermediate product
Some intermediate products may be traded between the divisions of an M-form 
or H-form firm, but may also be traded between the production divisions and 
external buyers from outside the firm. For example, a car manufacturer might 
be one division of an M-form organization, which includes a separate tyre manu-
facturing division. The latter sells tyres not only to the car manufacturing divi-
sion, but also externally to garages and car repair shops, or direct to consumers. 
There are many other tyre manufacturers, so the external market for tyres is 
highly competitive. Returning to the previous case of the production division and

distribution division, if the external market is perfectly competitive the produc-
tion division has the option to sell as much of the intermediate commodity as 
it likes on the external market at the perfectly competitive price. Similarly, the 
distribution division has the option to buy as much of the intermediate commod-
ity as it likes, again at the perfectly competitive price.
Under these circumstances, the transfer price is effectively constrained to be 
equal to the perfectly competitive price. If the transfer price were higher than 
the competitive price, the distributor would prefer to make all of its purchases 
of the intermediate commodity on the external market; and if the transfer price 
were lower than the competitive price, the producer would prefer to sell all of 
its output on the external market. However, it is also likely that the quantity of 
internal trade and the quantity of production will diverge, with external trade 
accounting for the difference between the two. Figures 14.10 and 14.11 illustrate 
two possible cases.
First, in Figure 14.10 the perfectly competitive price PC is lower than P1 in 
Figure 14.7. The distributor’s total marginal cost function is MC2 + PC and the 
distributor selects the quantity Q3 at which MC2 + PC = MR2. At a price of 
PC, the producer is willing to supply only Q2 units. The distributor purchases 
the additional Q3 - Q2 units on the external market. In comparison with the 
case where the transfer price is P1 and Q1 units are traded, the triangle HJL 
represents the cost saving to the firm resulting from buying Q1 - Q2 units of 
the intermediate commodity on the external market rather than producing these 
units internally, and LJK represents the additional profit earned because the 
distributor’s total output increases from Q1 to Q3 (with the extra Q3 - Q1 units 
also purchased on the external market).
Second, in Figure 14.11 the perfectly competitive price P′C is higher than P1 
in Figure 14.7. The distributor’s total marginal cost function is MC2 + P′C, and 
Figure 14.9  Transfer pricing: profit maximization for the producer

|	 14    ■    Pricing
Figure 14.10  Transfer pricing: perfectly competitive external market (price below P1)
Figure 14.11  Transfer pricing: perfectly competitive external market (price above P1)
the distributor selects the quantity Q3′ at which MC2 + P′C = MR2. At a price 
of P′C, the producer wishes to supply Q2′ units. The producer sells the additional 
Q2′ - Q3′ units on the external market. In comparison with the case where the 
transfer price is P1 and Q1 units are traded, the triangle NRM represents the extra 
profit to the firm resulting from selling Q1 - Q3′ units of the intermediate com-
modity on the external market rather than internally, and MRS represents the 
additional profit earned because the producer’s output increases from Q1 to Q2′.
The analysis shown in Figures 14.10 and 14.11 suggests that if a competitive 
external market exists, the firm should participate in this market. It is damaging 
to the firm’s interests to insist that all units of the intermediate commodity used 
by the distributor are produced internally, if the commodity can be purchased 
more cheaply on the external market. And it is equally damaging to insist that 
the producer can only sell the intermediate commodity to the distributor, if the 
commodity can be produced and sold more profitably on the external market. By 
participating in the external market, in both cases the firm achieves an increase 
in its total profit. Of course, these conclusions could change if the firm had some 
other strategic motive for non-participation in the external market. For example, 

	
	
	
14.5  Transfer pricing	 |	
423
the firm might not wish to purchase externally because it seeks to prevent a 
competitor from selling its output, hoping to force the competitor to exit from 
the production industry; or similarly, the firm might not wish to sell externally 
because it seeks to prevent a competitor from gaining access to supplies of the 
intermediate commodity, hoping to force the competitor to exit from the distri-
bution industry.
Transfer pricing with an imperfectly competitive external 
market for the intermediate product
A further possibility is that the intermediate product may be traded not only 
between the divisions of an M-form or H-form firm, but also between the pro-
duction division and one or more external buyers in an imperfectly competitive 
market. A car manufacturer might be one division of an M-form organization, 
which buys inputs from a separate division which manufactures specialised elec-
trical components. There are very few other manufacturers of similar compo-
nents, so the external market for components is imperfectly competitive.
Returning to the theoretical model, with an imperfectly competitive external 
market, the transfer price for internal trade between the production and distri-
bution divisions differs from the price paid by buyers in the external market. 
In ­Figure 14.12, the analysis is restricted to the case where the transfer price, 
denoted P4, turns out to be higher than P1 in Figure 14.7. This means the pro-
ducer’s output of Q5 is larger than the distributor’s output of Q4, and the pro-
ducer sells the surplus output of Q5 - Q4 in the imperfectly competitive external 
market for the intermediate product. The two left-hand diagrams in Figure 14.12 
are constructed in the same way as before. The right-hand diagram shows the 
producer’s demand function and marginal revenue function in the external mar-
ket, denoted D3 and MR3 respectively. The optimal transfer price of P4 is the 
only value that satisfies the following conditions:
■ At the producer’s total output level of Q5, the producer’s marginal cost equals 
the transfer price, or MC1 = P4.
Figure 14.12  Transfer pricing: imperfectly competitive external market (price above P1)

424	
|	 14    ■    Pricing
■ At the transfer price of P4, the distributor’s total marginal cost equals the dis-
tributor’s marginal revenue, or MC2 + P4 = MR2, yielding an output level 
for the distributor of Q4.
■ When the surplus intermediate output of Q5 - Q4 is sold in the external mar-
ket, the producer’s marginal revenue in the external market equals the transfer 
price, or MR3 = P4. The producer’s selling price in the external market is PE, 
which is higher than the transfer price of P4. Effectively, the producer practises 
third-degree price discrimination (see Section 14.3) by charging different prices 
in the segmented internal and external markets for the intermediate output.
Transfer pricing: some implications
The analysis in Section 14.5 has shown that the imputed profitability of each 
division is not the same as the contribution of each division to the profitability 
of the firm as a whole. There are several implications:
■ The rewards and incentives for divisional managers should not be based solely 
on the imputed profitability of their own divisions, but should reflect the impli-
cations of their decisions for the profitability of the firm as a whole. If divisional 
managers seek to maximise the imputed profitability of their own divisions, 
in the case where there is no external market for the intermediate product a 
situation of bilateral monopoly exists. The distributor would prefer to use its 
monopsony power (as sole buyer) to reduce output and reduce the transfer 
price (see Figure 14.8), while the producer would prefer to use its monopoly 
power (as sole producer) to reduce output and increase the transfer price (see 
Figure 14.9). However, both of these outcomes reduce the profitability of the 
firm as a whole.
■ Strategic decisions concerning the closure of (imputed) loss-making divisions 
or the expansion of profitable divisions should take account of the implica-
tions for the profitability of the firm as a whole. For example, the firm as a 
whole does not benefit from the closure of a loss-making production division 
if this decision reduces the profitability of the distribution division by more 
than the direct saving achieved by not producing the intermediate product 
in-house. If there are significant transaction costs associated with buying or 
selling on the external market, these should also be taken into account when 
assessing the viability of (imputed) loss-making divisions.
■ Transfer pricing is a particularly controversial topic in the case of multina-
tional firms. The fact that decisions concerning transfer prices have implica-
tions for the profits imputed to each division within the firm provides strong 
incentives for firms to set their transfer prices in such a way as to shift profits 
towards divisions located in countries with low rates of corporation tax (tax 
on company profits). A multinational firm may therefore declare artificially 
high or low transfer prices, so that its profits are declared in a way that mini-
mises its overall corporation tax liability. The tax authorities may attempt 
to impose rules or controls on transfer pricing; for example, by insisting that 
transfer prices are comparable with prices at which the intermediate product 

	
	
	
14.5  Transfer pricing	 |	
425
can be traded on the external market. However, often such controls are easily 
circumvented, especially in developing countries where the influence of the tax 
authorities over the accounting practices of large, foreign-owned multination-
als may be weak.
Case study 14.5
Light falls on Apple’s tax deal with Ireland
FT
Corporate tax avoidance is usually portrayed as a game of cat and mouse, with leaden-
footed governments chasing slippery companies for their missing taxes. In its forthright 
criticism of the dealings between Apple and the Irish government, the European Commis-
sion may have uncovered a new variation, in which the tax-avoiding mouse is receiving 
unfair help from the governmental cat.
This complicated affair shows where justifiable competitive behaviour may have 
strayed into closet protectionism. Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister, this year 
denied that Ireland ever cut any special deals with individual companies. It is hard to read 
the commission’s evidence, released yesterday, and draw the same conclusion.
At the heart of the matter is the murky business of transfer pricing, which can be used 
to shift profits between corporate subsidiaries. In Apple’s case it has operations in Ireland 
that buy and sell gadgets around the world, using prices that cannot be confirmed in a 
market. Interview notes show representatives of Apple setting out in advance what profit 
it would be prepared to recognise in Ireland. What follows appears to be carefully engi-
neered to achieve this agreed-upon profit. No strong reason is supplied for the cost-plus 
method that Apple is allowed to use, which included a change in the mark-up seemingly 
designed to encourage Apple to expand operations and employment in Ireland. The deal 
was allowed to stand for the unusually long period of 15 years. Taken together, the com-
mission sees this as cause to believe that Ireland conferred a specific, negotiated advantage 
on Apple, which may well have undermined the single market.
It will be some time before the commission reaches its final verdict, and in the meantime 
both Apple and the Irish government appear likely to contest vigorously any implications 
of wrongdoing. But they should recognise that the tide is turning in the battle against 
corporate tax avoidance. Politicians everywhere are swapping their starry-eyed obsession 
with high-tech glamour for an unromantic lust for tax revenues. They are increasingly 
willing to co-operate to claw back some money. In this climate neither Apple nor Ireland 
should risk being caught out. They do not need to resort to questionable practices. Since 
1990 when these tax affairs were first discussed Apple has transformed itself, becoming 
one of the most valuable companies on earth. From such a position it should care more 
for its reputation and resist the temptation to bully national treasuries into conceding 
lower tax rates.
Even without the red carpet treatment Ireland stands accused of rolling out for Apple, 
it has a highly competitive corporate tax rate. This has become as much a symbol of 
Irish identity as the Blarney Stone. Within an economic model based on free trade and

Price dispersion
In a competitive market in which an identical product or service is sold by many 
firms, and consumers have perfect information, firms should act as price-takers 
with the same price charged by all producers and retailers. If different prices are 
charged for the same product or service, this suggests some form of departure 
from the assumptions underlying the theoretical model of perfect competition. 
Therefore studying the extent of price dispersion across producers and retailers, 
and studying the degree to which price dispersion persists over time, may be 
informative as an indicator as to whether markets are competitive or uncompeti-
tive (Pratt et al., 1979; Lach, 2002).
Theory suggests that price dispersion may arise due to heterogeneity between 
buyers in respect of search costs, brand loyalty, frequency of repeat purchases and 
access to information; or heterogeneity between sellers in respect of production 
costs, product quality and technology (Stigler, 1961; Rothschild, 1973; Reinganum, 
1979; Rosenthal, 1980; Varian, 1980; Narasimhan, 1988; Stahl, 1989; Spulber, 
1995; Sorenson, 2000; Gerardi and Shapiro, 2009). If individual sellers pitch their 
prices at permanently low or high levels relative to their competitors, then con-
sumer learning should lead to the elimination of high-price sellers from the market, 
and to the elimination of price dispersion. On the other hand, if sellers frequently 
vary their relative positions, then search costs may make it prohibitive for consum-
ers to identify the lowest prices available at any particular time. It is likely that the 
advent of the internet had implications for the extent and persistence of price dis-
persion by reducing search costs. However, some evidence suggests that consumers 
often fail to choose the best price because they search too little, become confused 
comparing prices, are over-confident and/or show excessive inertia through too 
little switching away from past choices or default options (Grubb, 2015a,b,c).
In recent years, the development and rapid growth of online markets has made 
it easier for researchers to collect information on the prices charged by different 
competitiveness, it helped to kick-start a long period of expansion and lure to Irish shores 
a constellation of multinational corporations. But it also inspires hostility in other Euro-
pean countries, notably France. Ireland has every right to craft its economic strategy, 
which includes setting its own tax rates. Its leaders will find it easier to defend this stance 
if they remove any impression of the sort of shady dealing suggested by the commission. 
The European Commission has shown why it was right to shine a light on these tax deals. 
Ireland claims to want to be part of the solution not the problem. If this is to mean any-
thing, the government should demarcate the line between luring companies to Ireland and 
letting them craft bespoke tax policies.

retailers, either by collecting data from the websites of individual producers or 
retailers or by using specialised price comparison websites. Price comparison 
websites enable retailers to display price information, information about the 
attributes of the products they supply, and information about the service the 
retailers themselves provide, in a format that can be easily accessed by consum-
ers (Baye and Morgan, 2001). Price comparison websites may drastically reduce 
the search costs that consumers would otherwise incur. Therefore it might be 
expected that, in markets where price comparison websites are available, the level 
of price dispersion should be less than in markets where such tools are unavail-
able. Gorodnichenko and Talavera (2016) report empirical evidence to suggest 
that relative to prices in traditional outlets, prices in online markets are more 
flexible and adjust rapidly to changes in external economic conditions such as 
exchange rates and the degree of competition.
In the academic literature on price dispersion, it is often assumed that there are 
two types of consumers: the informed (sometimes known as shoppers) and the 
uninformed (sometimes known as loyals). Informed consumers search intensively 
to obtain the lowest available prices, while uninformed consumers either do not 
access price data, or have preferences for particular retailers that override price 
considerations. This suggests price dispersion is possible, even in equilibrium. 
This price dispersion is likely to be persistent, with the identity of firms offering 
the highest and lowest prices changing over time.
In an early empirical study, Brynjolsson and Smith (2000) compare the prices 
of books and CDs at 41 online and traditional retailers between 1998 and 1999. 
Contrary to expectations, prices and price dispersion were found to be higher in 
online markets than in traditional markets. Subsequent US and Italian studies 
for books and CDs by Clay et al. (2002) and Ancarani and Shankar (2004) report 
similar findings. These studies attribute their findings to a lack of maturity in 
the online market.
Early studies for other products also suggest price dispersion is higher in 
online markets. Using US data, Erevelles et al. (2001) find the price of vita-
mins is higher online than in drug stores, supermarkets and warehouse suppliers. 
Scholten and Smith (2002) compare price dispersion in traditional retail markets 
for products such as deodorants, hairspray, aspirin and cameras in 1976, with 
dispersion for the same products in 2000. Price dispersion was higher in 2000 
than in 1976. However, Brown and Goolsbee (2002) find the price dispersion 
of life insurance policies declined over the period 1992–7 as customer use of the 
internet increased. A hedonic regression model is used to control for differences 
in the terms, conditions and coverage of the policies that are compared. Cavallo 
(2016) compares online with offline prices for 56 retailers across 10 countries. In 
72 per cent of cases the prices of offline and online products are identical. Most 
similarity between online and offline prices are found for electronic products, 
while least similarity is found for pharmaceutical and office products.
Another facet of recent work is to examine whether price dispersion differs 
between pure play (specialist online retailers) and multi-channel retailers (bricks 
and mortar and non-specialist online retailers). Tang and Ting (2001) compare 
the levels and dispersion of prices between six online retailers and four multi-
channel retailers for 51 DVD titles in Singapore. The online retailers tended to 

428	
|	 14    ■    Pricing
charge lower prices, and there was less price dispersion, than the multichannel 
retailers. Using Italian data on the prices of books and CDs, Ancarani and Shan-
kar (2004) find multichannel retailers charged higher prices and had greater price 
dispersion than pure play retailers.
Several price dispersion studies use data from internet price comparison sites, 
where information may be updated on a weekly, daily or even hourly basis (Baye 
and Morgan, 2001; Baye et al., 2007). For example, Baye et al. (2004) examine 4 
million daily price observations for 1,000 consumer electronic products posted 
on the shopper.com website between August 2000 and March 2001, in order to 
determine whether price dispersion decreased as consumer usage of this website 
increased over the eight-month period of the study. A reduction in price disper-
sion over time would suggest that dispersion is a temporary, disequilibrium phe-
nomenon. Alternatively, if there was no reduction, this would suggest that price 
dispersion is an equilibrium phenomenon, reflecting structural characteristics of 
the markets concerned. Three measures of price dispersion are used: the average 
percentage difference in price; the average difference between the two lowest 
prices; and the average coefficient of variation. There is little evidence to sup-
port the view that price dispersion was a temporary phenomenon; instead, price 
dispersion was persistent over time, and was dependent on structural indicators 
such as the number of firms listing prices for a given product. The degree of price 
dispersion was greater when there were fewer firms.
Pan et al. (2004) examine the determinants of price dispersion in online retail-
ing, using 2000 and 2001 US data from a price comparison website on several 
hundred identical products. The factors that may be relevant in explaining the 
degree of price dispersion in the online markets for different products and services 
include shopping, retailer, market and product characteristics. Shopping charac-
teristics include shopping convenience (ease of finding and evaluating products 
through search tools), reliability of delivery and customer service, depth of online 
product information, quality of shipping service and returns policy. Retailer char-
acteristics include the timing of the retailer’s market entry, degree of consumer 
trust and retailer branding, and consumer awareness. Market and product char-
acteristics include the number of competing sellers, whether the product is cheap 
or expensive, homogeneity or heterogeneity of product characteristics and the 
popularity of the product among consumers. In general, variability of shopping 
characteristics is found to be important in explaining price dispersion, but retailer 
characteristics are found to be less important. Liu (2016) uses price information 
for a large sample of identical products sold by a large clothing company (Zara) 
across 74 countries in one week in 2013. There is evidence of price dispersion, par-
ticularly for lower-priced products. Income differences between countries account 
for much of the variation in prices.

Summary
One of the earliest challenges to the neoclassical theory of the firm questioned 
whether in practice firms have sufficient information to apply the profit-­
maximizing rule marginal revenue equals marginal cost when setting their prices. 

	
	
	
14.7  Summary	 |	
429
Cost plus pricing is an alternative pricing rule, whereby price is determined by 
adding a percentage markup to average variable cost. The markup includes a 
contribution towards fixed costs, and a profit margin. Under some conditions, 
cost plus pricing may be simpler and less demanding in terms of its informational 
requirements than profit-maximizing pricing. However, the advantages of cost 
plus pricing are only likely to materialise if the firm’s costs are stable, and if 
average variable cost is constant over the relevant range of output levels. If the 
cost plus pricing firm always selects approximately the same profit margin as a 
profit-maximizing firm would achieve, cost plus pricing and profit maximisation 
are equivalent. If so, the margin must be an inverse function of the firm’s price 
elasticity of demand. Although the use of cost plus pricing is widely reported, 
cost plus could just be a convenient rule-of-thumb for firms that are really profit 
maximisers, even if profit maximization is not explicitly acknowledged.
Firms with a degree of market power need not always set uniform prices that 
are identical for all consumers, and identical no matter how many units of the 
product each consumer buys. With a policy of price discrimination, the firm 
might sell at different prices to different consumers, or make the price per unit 
each consumer pays dependent on the number of units purchased. For price 
discrimination to be possible, the firm must have market power, and the market 
must be divisible into submarkets with different demand conditions, so that sec-
ondary trade or resale between consumers in different submarkets is not possible.
There are three types of price discrimination:
■ First-degree price discrimination makes the price per unit of output dependent 
on the identity of the purchaser and on the number of units purchased. The 
monopolist exploits differences in consumers’ willingness to pay, by charging 
each consumer his or her own reservation price for each individual unit pur-
chased. First-degree price discrimination yields a higher abnormal profit than 
the standard case of profit maximization with a uniform price in monopoly, 
because the consumer surplus in the standard case is converted into producer 
surplus, and deadweight loss is eliminated. The outcome under first-degree 
price discrimination is allocatively efficient, because price equals marginal cost 
for the most marginal unit produced and sold.
■ Second-degree price discrimination makes the price per unit of output depen-
dent on the number of units purchased. The price does not depend on the iden-
tity of the purchaser. The monopolist designs a menu of prices and quantities 
such that each consumer chooses a price–quantity combination that allows the 
monopolist to discriminate profitably between consumers. A two-part tariff, 
requiring the payment of a fixed fee if the consumer wishes to make any pur-
chases at all, plus an additional uniform price per unit purchased, is a form of 
second-degree price discrimination.
■ Third-degree price discrimination involves making the price per unit depend 
on the identity of the purchaser. The price does not depend on the number 
of units purchased. However, the monopolist is able to segment the market 
by offering different prices to different consumers. The monopolist charges 
a relatively high price to consumers whose demand is price inelastic, and a 
relatively low price to consumers whose demand is price elastic.

|	 14    ■    Pricing
Forms of price discrimination used in practice include the following:
■ Intertemporal price discrimination, whereby the supplier segments the market 
by the point in time at which the product is purchased.
■ Branding, whereby different prices are charged for similar or identical goods 
differentiated solely by a brand label.
■ Loyalty discounts for regular customers, operated by airlines, supermarkets 
and other retailers.
■ Coupons providing price discounts that discriminate between consumers on 
the basis of willingness to make the effort to claim the discount.
■ Stock clearance sales involving successive price reductions which are a form 
of intertemporal price discrimination.
■ Metering, involving pricing for a low profit margin on a primary product 
(such as film tickets) and a high profit margin on a tied secondary product 
(such as popcorn).
■ Free-on-board pricing, involving the producer or distributor absorbing trans-
port costs, and representing a form of price discrimination favouring buyers 
in locations where transport costs are higher.
In markets where demand varies at different times of the day or on different 
days of the year, but the supplier is unable to adjust capacity to meet the higher 
level of demand in peak periods (or reduce capacity in off-peak periods) the 
supplier faces a peak-load problem. If the levels of demand and costs are such 
that it is efficient to operate at full capacity in both periods, the social welfare 
maximizing price for each period is the marginal cost of installing an extra unit 
of capacity plus the marginal production cost in both periods minus the price 
charged in the other period. If it is efficient to operate at full capacity during the 
peak period, the willingness of the off-peak consumers to pay becomes irrelevant 
in determining the optimal capacity, because the system only operates at capacity 
during the peak period.
In multidivisional organizations, the choice of transfer prices at which inter-
mediate products are traded internally between divisions affects the imputed 
profitability of the divisions involved. Decisions taken at divisional level with 
a view to the maximization of divisional profits do not necessarily ensure the 
maximization of the total profit of the firm as a whole. In this chapter, profit-
maximizing models of transfer pricing have been developed for the cases where 
there is no external market for the intermediate product, and where the inter-
mediate product can be traded on an external market that is either perfectly 
competitive or imperfectly competitive. The analysis suggests that incentives for 
divisional managers should not be based solely on imputed divisional profit-
ability, but should reflect the profitability of the entire organization. Strategic 
decisions concerning the closure of (imputed) loss-making divisions should also 
take account of the implications for the profitability of the firm as a whole, 
including any additional transaction costs associated with trade on the external 
market that are not considered when calculating imputed divisional profits. The

transfer pricing practices of multinational firms can raise particularly difficult 
policy issues in cases where firms use transfer pricing to minimise their corpora-
tion tax liabilities.
In a competitive market with perfect information and product homogeneity, 
economists would expect all producers or retailers to charge the same price. 
If there is price dispersion, this suggests some form of failure of the assump-
tions underlying the theoretical model of perfect competition. In recent years, 
the growth of online markets has allowed consumers to compare prices more 
easily, either from the websites of individual producers or retailers, or by using 
specialised price comparison websites. Product characteristics, and structural 
characteristics of online markets including the number of retailers, their reputa-
tion and the quality of service they offer, appear to be influential in determining 
the extent of price dispersion. Advances in the collection, handling and storage 
of price data offer significant opportunities for new and innovative research on 
price dispersion (Cavallo and Rigobon, 2016).

Introduction
Goods have been bought and sold through auctions throughout history. The 
Romans, for example, auctioned slaves and property looted from their foreign 
conquests. Auctions are still used today for a wide variety of transactions in the 
modern-day economy. Houses, cars, paintings and antiques are commonly sold

by auction, while farmers often use auctions to trade livestock and other agri-
cultural produce. Governments commonly sell the rights to drill for oil or gas 
within a particular tract of land or sea by auction. In many countries, large sums 
have been raised in recent years from the auction of licences to operate mobile 
telephone services. Governments also use auctions to sell treasury bills and other 
government securities. Government procurement contracts require contractors 
to submit tenders, with the lowest tender winning the right to become the sup-
plier. The expansion of the internet has created new opportunities for trading by 
auction. For example, a huge variety and volume of goods are now traded on a 
daily basis through the eBay website. Even your local department store conducts 
a certain type of auction each time it announces a sale, in which the prices of sale 
items are successively reduced until all such items have been sold.
An auction is a market mechanism for converting bids from market partici-
pants into decisions concerning the allocation of resources and prices, through 
a specific set of rules. In general terms, auction theory raises several issues that 
have already been encountered in previous chapters. Specifically, auction theory 
is concerned with price formation under conditions of uncertainty, asymmetric 
information and interdependence. Auctions can be characterised by the rules 
for the submission of bids, for determining the identity of the winning bidder, 
and for determining the price the winning bidder pays. Section 15.2 describes 
the four basic auction formats, which provide the cornerstone for the economic 
theory of auctions, and which (subject to certain possible variations or embel-
lishments) describe most auctions in practice. In auction theory, the assump-
tions concerning the way in which bidders assess the value of the item under 
auction turns out to be a crucial ingredient. Two polar cases, known as the pure 
common value model and the independent private values model, are introduced 
in this section.
Section 15.3 develops the pure common value model, in which bidders form 
individual estimates of the value of an item that has the same intrinsic value to 
all of them. This section introduces the phenomenon of the winner’s curse: an 
apparent tendency for winning bidders in auctions requiring the submission of 
sealed bids to systematically overvalue the item in question and consequently to 
overbid.
Section 15.4 considers optimal bidding strategies for all four basic auction for-
mats, in the case where bidders form independent private valuations of the item 
under auction. A central result in auction theory, known as revenue equivalence, 
suggests that with the independent private values model, all four basic auction 
formats yield the same expected price to the seller.
Section 15.5 discusses a number of extensions to the basic theory covered in 
the two previous sections. These include the theory governing the seller’s optimal 
choice of reserve price; risk aversion, which raises the possibility that in certain 
auctions bidders may bid more aggressively to improve their chances of winning; 
asymmetric bidders, who can be divided into different subgroups with different 
average valuations of the item under auction; and the affiliated valuations model, 
in which bidders’ valuations of the item under auction contain elements of both 
the pure common value and the independent private values models. Finally, 
­Section 15.6 reviews some of the empirical evidence on buyer and seller behaviour

in auctions. This review is subdivided into studies based on experimental evidence 
and those based on field evidence.
	
15.2	
Auction formats and models of bidders’ valuations
Section 15.2 introduces the four basic auction formats which provide the corner-
stone for the economic theory of auctions. Also considered in this section are the 
assumptions that can be used to model the way in which bidders value the item 
under auction. Two polar cases, known as the pure common value model and the 
independent private values model, are considered. This section begins, however, 
with a brief description of the four basic auction formats.
■ The English auction, also known as the ascending bid auction, involves the price 
being set initially at a very low level which many bidders would be prepared to 
pay, and then raised successively until a level is reached which only one bidder 
is willing to pay. The last remaining bidder secures the item at the final price 
and the auction stops. This type of auction can be conducted by having the 
seller call out the prices continuously, with individual bidders withdrawing 
when the price reaches a level they are unwilling to pay, until only one bidder 
remains. Alternatively, the bidders themselves might be required to call out 
their bids, or the bids might be submitted electronically with the highest current 
bid posted. The English auction is widely used to sell items such as paintings, 
antiques and (sometimes) houses and cars. Over the years, its dramatic poten-
tial has also made it the favourite auction format of numerous film directors.
■ The Dutch auction, also known as the descending bid auction, works in the oppo-
site way. The price is set initially at a very high level which no bidder would be 
prepared to pay, and is then lowered successively until a level is reached which 
one bidder is prepared to pay. The first bidder who is prepared to match the 
current price secures the item at that price and the auction stops. The Dutch 
auction is used in a number of countries to sell agricultural produce, including 
tulips in the Netherlands (the source of the name Dutch auction).
■ In the first price sealed bid auction, each bidder independently submits a single 
bid, without seeing the bids submitted by other bidders. The highest bidder 
secures the item and pays a price equal to their winning bid. The first price 
sealed bid auction has been used by governments to sell drilling rights for oil 
and gas, and the rights to extract minerals from state-owned land. Another 
example of this type of auction is the English Premier League’s regular auc-
tions of the live television broadcasting rights for Premier League football.
■ The second price sealed bid auction is also sometimes known as a Vickrey auc-
tion, after the author of a seminal paper on auction theory (Vickrey, 1961). 
The bidding process works in the same manner as a first price sealed bid auc-
tion: each bidder independently and privately submits a single bid. Again, the 
highest bidder secures the item, but pays a price equal to the second-highest 
submitted bid. This format has a number of interesting theoretical properties, 
but it has only occasionally been used in practice.

438	
|	 15    ■    Auctions
Asymmetric information is a key element of most theoretical models of auc-
tions. First, the seller typically does not have perfect information concerning 
the distribution of bidders’ valuations of the item being auctioned. Second, the 
bidders themselves do not have perfect information about each other’s valua-
tions. The simplest theoretical models of auctions are based on two alternative 
assumptions concerning the distribution of bidders’ valuations:
■ In the pure common value model, the item has a single, intrinsic value that 
is the same for all bidders. However, no single bidder knows what this true 
value is. On the basis of private information or signals that differ between 
bidders, each bidder makes an independent assessment or estimate of the 
item’s true value. For example, in an auction for the drilling rights to an 
oilfield, there is a certain amount of oil under the ground which determines 
the intrinsic value of the rights, and this value might be considered identical 
by all oil firms. At the time the drilling rights are auctioned, no firm knows 
exactly how much oil is present, although each firm has made its own private 
assessment based on its own survey work. In this case, one bidder’s private 
estimate of the value would be influenced by knowledge of the estimates of 
other bidders. For example, if firm A initially valued the rights at £100m, but 
subsequently discovered that nine other firms had each carried out a similar 
survey that valued the rights at less than £100m, firm A would probably con-
clude that its own survey was overoptimistic or inaccurate and would revise 
its estimate downwards.
■ In the independent private values model, each bidder knows the true value of 
the item to themselves personally. However, personal valuations of the item 
differ between bidders and there is no single, intrinsic value that all bidders 
can agree on. For example, my valuation of a painting might depend solely 
upon my personal appreciation of the item, and anyone else’s opinion might 
be completely irrelevant to me in forming my personal valuation.
The pure common values model and the independent private values model can 
usefully be interpreted as theoretical, polar extremes. In practice, elements of 
both models may be required to represent the actual distribution of bidders’ pref-
erences. In the first example cited above, the value of the drilling rights might not 
be the same for all oil firms. Firm A might possess some specific assets (physical 
assets, or specialised or experienced labour) that are productive only in certain 
geological conditions, and which make these particular drilling rights of greater 
value to firm A than to any other oil firm. In the second example, your per-
sonal valuation of a painting might depend partly on your own personal tastes, 
but it might also depend partly on other people’s tastes, which determine how 
much prestige you gain by becoming the painting’s owner, or how much cash 
you expect to realise if you subsequently decide to sell. In such cases, it may be 
necessary to use a third model known as the affiliated valuations model, which 
includes elements of both the pure common value model and the independent 
private values model (Milgrom and Weber, 1982). Although the full details of 
the affiliated valuations model are beyond the scope of this text, this model is 
considered briefly in Section 15.5.

15.3	
The pure common value model and the winner’s curse
This section examines some of the properties of auctions when there is a single, 
intrinsic value of the item being auctioned that is the same for all bidders, but 
unknown precisely to any individual bidder. As shown in Section 15.2, the auc-
tion of the drilling rights to a particular tract of land or sea provides a classic 
example of an auction that may conform to the pure common values model. A 
second example, which has been widely used in classroom or laboratory experi-
ments, is as follows. Your lecturer brings a jar filled with penny coins into the 
classroom and allows each student to take a quick look at the jar, which is suf-
ficient for the student to form an estimate of the number of coins but insufficient 
to count the number of coins precisely. The lecturer then auctions the jar. In this 
case, the jar has an intrinsic value (determined by the actual number of coins) 
which is unknown to any of the students but is the same for every student; and 
each student forms an imperfect estimate of this intrinsic value, which may turn 
out to be either too high or too low.
In a classic paper on auctions of oilfield drilling rights, Capen et al. (1971) 
identify a phenomenon known as the winner’s curse, which appears to be a rather 
common feature of many auctions in which bidders’ valuations conform to the 
pure common value model. In order to describe the winner’s curse, the following 
assumptions are made:
■ The auction format is first price sealed bid. Only this auction format is con-
sidered in the current section. Detailed consideration is given to all four basic 
auction formats in the discussion of the independent private values model in 
Section 15.4, and in Section 15.5 some consideration is given to the other three 
auction formats in the case where bidders’ valuations conform to the pure com-
mon value model.
■ Each bidder forms an unbiased private estimate of the true value of the item 
being auctioned. In other words, in any particular auction each bidder is 
equally likely to undervalue or overvalue the item, but if there were a large 
number of auctions no bidder would systematically overvalue or undervalue 
the items on average.
■ Each bidder submits a sealed bid that is strictly increasing relative to their own 
private estimate of the intrinsic value. This implies the bidder with the highest 
private estimate always submits the highest bid and this bidder always wins 
the auction.
Suppose, initially, all bidders submit bids equivalent to their own private esti-
mates. Since these private estimates are equally likely to be above or below the 
true value, it is very likely that the winning bidder, with the highest private esti-
mate, has overestimated the true value of the item. Therefore, the bidder with the 
highest private estimate wins the auction, having submitted a bid that is very likely 
to turn out to be higher than the true value of the item! Paradoxically, the winning 
bidder is very likely to turn out to be a loser, in the sense of having overpaid for 
the item. The winning bidder falls victim to the winner’s curse. In their analysis 

440	
|	 15    ■    Auctions
of auctions for oil and gas drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico during the 1950s 
and 1960s, Capen et al. note a consistent tendency for the winning oil firms to 
have overestimated the true values of the rights they were successful in securing.
In recent years, several major companies have taken a rather careful 
look at their record and those of the industry in areas where sealed 
competitive bidding is the method of acquiring leases. The most notable 
of these areas, and perhaps the most interesting, is the Gulf of Mexico. 
Most analysts turn up with the rather shocking result that, while there 
seems to be a lot of oil and gas in the region, the industry is not making 
as much return on its investment as it intended.
(Capen et al., 1971, p. 641)
In experiments replicating the second example cited above, in which a jar con-
taining an (unknown) number of penny coins is auctioned and sold to the high-
est bidder, a similar tendency is observed very frequently: the winning bid often 
exceeds the true value of the jar and the winning bidder consequently experi-
ences the winner’s curse. Experimental and field evidence on the winner’s curse 
is reviewed in greater detail in Section 15.6.
The paradox of the winner’s curse can also be described in the following terms. 
In the oil firms’ example, if firm A’s own private valuation of the drilling rights 
is the only information available to A, this private valuation represents A’s best 
estimate of the true value of the rights. However, if A also has information con-
cerning the private valuations of other firms, this information might well cause 
A to revise its estimate of the true value. For example, if A’s private survey 
produces a valuation of £100 m, but A subsequently discovers that nine other 
firms have all (independently) valued the rights at less than £100m, A might well 
infer that its own valuation of £100m is likely to be an overestimate. A’s best 
estimate of the true value, conditional on the news that its own private valuation 
of £100m is the highest of 10 similar private valuations, is now considerably less 
than £100m. If A also discovers that the other nine valuations are all within the 
range £50m to £95m, A might perhaps revise its estimate downwards towards 
the middle of this range: this would produce a revised estimate of around £75m.
Therefore, firm A has two possible estimates of the true value of the rights on 
which it could base its sealed bid:
■ A’s original private estimate of the true value of the rights, unconditional on 
any information about the private estimates of the other bidders.
■ A’s revised estimate of the true value of the rights, conditional on A’s private 
estimate being the highest private estimate of any bidder, and A’s bid therefore 
being the winning bid.
At the time it submits its bid, firm A has only its own original estimate to go on, 
but if A bases its bid on this estimate, A is very likely to experience the winner’s 
curse if A wins. To avoid the winner’s curse, A’s sealed bid should be based on 
a revised estimate, conditional on A’s original estimate being the highest esti-
mate. Since A only wins if A’s bid does turn out to be the highest, and A’s bid is

irrelevant to A if some other bidder submits a higher bid, A’s revised estimate of 
the true value should be made conditional on the assumption that A’s original 
estimate will turn out to be the highest, and that A’s bid will therefore turn out 
to be the winning bid.
Using mathematical notation, the situation can be described as follows. Let 
V represent the true value of the item that is being auctioned. V is unknown to 
any of the bidders, but each bidder obtains a signal, denoted Si for bidder i. For 
simplicity it is assumed that Si is drawn randomly from a uniform distribution 
with a minimum value of zero and a maximum value of 2V. In other words, if 
a bidder is selected at random, this bidder’s private signal is equally likely to 
take any value between zero and 2V, and is therefore equally likely to provide 
an underestimate or an overestimate of V. Therefore, each bidder’s signal is an 
unbiased estimate of V. This implies E(V Si) = Si, where E(V Si) denotes the 
expected value of V, conditional on i’s signal but unconditional on any informa-
tion about the signals obtained by other bidders.
To write bidder i’s estimate of the true value of the item conditional on Si 
being the highest signal obtained by any bidder, and i’s bid therefore being the 
winning bid, the following result is useful:
E[S(1)] = v + [N/(N + 1)](v - v)
where S(1) denotes the highest signal obtained by any bidder, E[S(1)] is the expected 
value of S(1), v and v are the minimum and maximum values (respectively) that 
any bidder’s signal can take, and N is the number of bidders. The result is derived 
in Appendix 1. In this case, v = 0 and v = 2V, so E[S(1)] = 2VN/(N + 1).
Let E[V Si = S(1)] denote the expected value of V, conditional on Si being 
the highest signal obtained by any bidder. If the true value of the item is V, 
on average Si (if it is known to be the highest signal) should be 2VN/(N + 1). 
Rearranging:
E[V Si = S(1)] = (N + 1)Si/(2N)
Alternatively, E[V Si = S(1)] = d(N)Si, where d(N) = (N + 1)/(2N) is the dis-
count factor that should be applied to Si to obtain an expected value for V con-
ditional on i’s signal being the highest signal, or Si = S(1). As Table 15.1 shows, 
as N (the number of bidders) increases, d(N) decreases. Therefore as N increases 
the size of the discount increases.
Note that if bidder i is the only bidder (N = 1), by definition bidder i has 
the highest signal, so d(N) = 1 (there is no discount). The larger the value of 
N, the greater is the likelihood that by being the highest signal, Si represents an

overestimate of V. Therefore, as N increases, d(N) decreases and the size of the 
discount increases. When the number of bidders is very large, bidder i should 
apply a 50 per cent discount; in other words, i’s valuation conditional on Si being 
the highest signal obtained by any bidder is only 50 per cent of Si.
The preceding analysis suggests that in the pure common value model, to avoid 
the winner’s curse bidder i’s submitted bid should be based on E[V Si = S(1)]. 
This is not quite the same as saying that bidder i’s submitted bid should actually 
be E[V Si = S(1)]. In fact, in a first price sealed bid auction it pays to submit a bid 
some distance below the bidder’s opinion as to the true value of the item. There-
fore, when formulating their submitted bid, bidder i should apply a further dis-
count to E[V Si = S(1)]. The reasons for doing so are examined in Section 15.4, 
in which the formulation of optimal bidding strategies for all four basic auction 
formats is examined, in the context of the independent private values model.
	
15.4	
Optimal bidding strategies and revenue equivalence in 
the independent private values model
This section examines some of the properties of auctions when bidders form inde-
pendent private valuations of the item being auctioned. Each bidder privately 
and independently forms an opinion of the value of the item and, even if one 
bidder’s opinion as to the value of the item were to be revealed, this information 
would be completely irrelevant to other bidders when formulating their own pri-
vate valuations. This section analyses the optimal bidding strategies for an indi-
vidual bidder in each of the four basic auction formats that were introduced in 
Section 15.2, in an independent private values setting. The discussion of optimal 
bidding strategies also illustrates an important result in auction theory, known 
as the revenue equivalence theorem.
Optimal bidding strategies
In order to determine a bidder’s optimal bidding strategy in each of the four basic 
auction formats, it is assumed for simplicity that all bidders’ private values of 
the item under auction are drawn randomly from a uniform distribution, with a 
minimum value of zero and a maximum value of one. In other words, if a bidder 
is selected at random, this bidder’s private value is equally likely to take any value 
between the lowest possible value of any bidder (equal to zero) and the highest 
possible value (equal to one). This choice of minimum and maximum values of 
zero and one is purely a scaling decision and does not affect the generality of the 
results derived further. The assumption that the values are distributed uniformly 
is a simplifying assumption, introduced to keep the mathematics as simple as 
possible. In fact, this assumption is not required for the treatment of the first 
two auction formats (English and second price sealed bid) examined next, but it 
is required for the treatment of the other two formats (first price sealed bid and 
Dutch). For these two formats a more general treatment would require the use 
of an arbitrary probability distribution for the bidders’ private values; however, 
the mathematics involved is beyond the scope of this text.

One other assumption introduced at this stage is that the bidders are risk 
neutral. The meaning of risk neutrality, and the implications of relaxing this 
assumption, are discussed in Section 15.5. Under these assumptions, it is a simple 
task to determine the optimal bidding strategies for an individual bidder in two 
of the four auction formats: the English (ascending bid) auction and the second 
price sealed bid auction. The discussion begins by considering these two cases.
The English (ascending bid) auction
In an English auction, a bidder’s optimal bidding strategy is to continue bidding 
for as long as the price is below their private value, and to withdraw as soon as 
the price equals or exceeds this private value. If another bidder is currently offer-
ing a price that is below your own private value, it is certainly worthwhile for you 
to enter a revised and higher bid (as long as this bid is also below your private 
value) for the following reasons:
■ If your revised bid is successful, you gain a rent equal to the difference between 
your private value and your winning bid.
■ If your revised bid is unsuccessful, you gain and lose nothing through having 
entered the revised bid.
Therefore, if another bidder is currently offering a price that is below your pri-
vate value, you might possibly gain something, and you certainly cannot lose 
anything, by entering a revised bid. It is a trivial matter to show that if another 
bidder is currently offering a price that is above your private value, you can only 
lose and you cannot possibly gain by entering a revised bid.
The second price sealed bid auction
As shown in Section 15.2, according to the rules of a second price sealed bid 
auction, the bidder who submits the highest bid pays a price equivalent to the 
second-highest entered bid. In this case, a bidder’s optimal bidding strategy is to 
enter a bid equivalent to his or her own private value. To see why this is neces-
sarily the optimal strategy, consider the implications of raising or lowering the 
submitted bid slightly, in the region of this optimal bid:
■ Suppose you raise your submitted bid so it is now slightly above your private 
value. This only affects the outcome of the auction if your original bid (equal 
to your private value) was not the highest bid but your raised bid is the highest 
bid. In this case, by raising your bid you must have overtaken some other bid, 
which now becomes the second-highest. This bid determines the price you will 
now pay. But this price must be higher than your private value! Therefore, you 
would not wish to be the winner under these circumstances. By raising your 
bid, you can only lose, you cannot possibly gain.
■ Suppose you lower your submitted bid so that it is now slightly below your 
private value. This only affects the outcome of the auction if your original bid 
(equal to your private value) was the highest bid, but your lower bid is not the 
highest bid. In this case, by lowering your bid you must have dropped below 

444	
|	 15    ■    Auctions
some other bid, which now becomes the highest. This rival bid determines the 
price you would have paid if you had bid your private value (because the rival 
bid would then have been the second highest). But this price must be lower 
than your private value! Therefore by lowering your bid you have forfeited 
an opportunity to buy the item for less than your private value. As before, by 
lowering your bid you can only lose, you cannot possibly gain.
In both an English auction and a second price sealed bid auction, it pays to tell 
the truth. In an English auction each bidder’s best bidding strategy is to continue 
bidding up to his or her private value; and in a second price sealed bid auction 
the best strategy is to submit a bid equivalent to this private value. This strategy 
is optimal no matter what other bidders decide to do. In the terminology of game 
theory, it is a dominant strategy (see Section 7.6). When all bidders implement 
this dominant strategy, a dominant strategy equilibrium is achieved.
Furthermore, at the dominant strategy equilibrium, the outcomes of the Eng-
lish auction and the second price sealed bid auction are the same. The bidder with 
the highest private value of the item always wins, and always pays a price equal 
to the second-highest bidder’s private value. At first sight this result may seem 
surprising: the rules of these two auction formats appear very different, so one 
might expect the outcomes to differ as well. However, if bidders behave rationally 
there is no difference between the outcomes of these two auction formats, which 
can be described as strategically equivalent.
The first price sealed bid auction
Does the conclusion, for the two auction formats analysed so far, that truth-
telling (bidding in accordance with your private value) pays, extend to the first 
price sealed bid auction? The answer is no. In a first price sealed bid auction, it 
pays to submit a bid that is below your own private value. Figure 15.1 illustrates 
Figure 15.1  Bidding strategies: first price sealed bid auction (independent private 
values model)

why this is so. For the purposes of constructing this diagram, bidder i has a 
private value of Vi, and in accordance with the assumptions made at the start of 
this section, it is assumed 0 … Vi … 1. Assume bidder i is considering submitting 
a bid of B, where 0 … B … Vi. It is never worthwhile to submit a bid of B 7 Vi 
because, if this turns out to be the winning bid, the price exceeds bidder i’s private 
value. Assume that for each bid in the range 0 … B … Vi, a probability that B 
will turn out to be the winning bid, denoted P(B), can be calculated. The factors 
that determine P(B) are considered below. At this stage, however, P(B) is taken 
as given. The following assumptions about P(B) are uncontroversial:
■ P(0) = 0: a submitted bid of zero will always be beaten by at least one other 
bidder, so the probability that a bid of zero wins the auction is zero.
■ P(B) is an increasing function of B: the higher the submitted bid, the higher 
the probability that the bid wins the auction.
■ P(B) is a decreasing function of N, the number of bidders. On the assump-
tions made so far, all bids lie somewhere in the range zero to one. Assume for 
example you intend to submit a bid of 0.8. If there is only one other bidder, the 
probability that this rival bid is below 0.8 and you win the auction is perhaps 
quite high. If there are two other bidders, the probability that both rival bids 
are below 0.8 is somewhat lower, but still reasonably high. But if there are 100 
or 1,000 other bidders, the probability that these rival bids are all below 0.8 is 
extremely small.
In Figure 15.1, the curve OA represents the relationship between B and P(B), 
drawn on the assumption that N, the number of bidders, is fixed. Three possible 
bids are shown on the horizontal axis: BH = Vi (high), BM (medium) and BL (low).
■ Suppose bidder i submits the high bid of BH, equal to their private value. The 
probability that BH turns out to be the winning bid is P(BH). The expected value 
of the payment is BH * P(BH) = OPHABH in Figure 15.1, and the expected 
value of the acquisition is Vi * P(BH) = OPHABH. Therefore, if bidder i sub-
mits the high bid of BH, the expected rent is zero, because the expected values 
of the payment and the acquisition are the same.
■ Suppose bidder i submits the medium bid of BM. The probability that BM turns 
out to be the winning bid is P(BM) 6 P(BH). The expected value of the pay-
ment is BM * P(BM) = OPMCBM, and the expected value of the acquisition 
is Vi * P(BM) = OPMDBH. Therefore, if bidder i submits the medium bid of 
BM, the expected rent is positive and equal to the area BMCDBH.
■ Finally, suppose bidder i submits the low bid of BL. The probability that BL 
turns out to be the winning bid is P(BL) 6 P(BM) 6 P(BH). The expected 
value of the payment is BL * P(BL) = OPLEBL, and the expected value of 
the acquisition is Vi * P(BL) = OPLFBH. Therefore, if bidder i submits the 
low bid of BL, the expected rent is positive and equal to the area BLEFBH.
By visual inspection of Figure 15.1, it is apparent that BMCDBH 7 BLEFBH. 
Therefore, in this case, it is better to submit the medium bid of BM than the low 
bid of BL. However, both BM and BL are better options than submitting the high 

446	
|	 15    ■    Auctions
bid BH = Vi (although as BL approaches zero, the expected rent also approaches 
zero). By reducing the submitted bid below BH = Vi, bidder i gains by com-
mitting to pay a lower price, but also loses by accepting a lower probability of 
winning the auction. Choosing the optimal bid involves selecting the optimal 
trade-off between these two effects.
The analysis in Figure 15.1 is only partial, because as yet the determination of 
the curve OA has not been explained. In fact, the position of this curve depends 
on the bidding strategies of the other bidders. Clearly, the probability that any 
given bid submitted by bidder i turns out to be the winning bid depends not only 
on the number of other bidders, but also on whether the others are bidding high 
(close to their own private values) or low (well below their own private values). In 
other words, each bidder faces a situation of interdependence. In such a situation, 
there is a Nash equilibrium solution to the auction. Each bidder should submit 
the bid that maximises their expected rent, based on the conjectural variation 
assumption (which turns out to be correct at the equilibrium) that all other bid-
ders also submit the bids that maximise their expected rents.
Under the assumptions used to develop the model to this point (uniformly 
distributed independent private values, and risk neutrality), it can be shown that 
at the Nash equilibrium the optimal bidding strategy for each bidder is to submit 
a bid equal to (N - 1)/N times the bidder’s own private value, where N is the 
number of bidders. In other words, the optimal bid of bidder i is:
Bi* = b*Vi
where b* = (N - 1)/N and Vi = bidder i’s private value. Accordingly, when 
there are N = 2 bidders, b* = (N - 1)/N = 1/2, so each bidder submits a bid 
equivalent to one-half of their private value. When there are N = 3 bidders, 
b* = (N - 1)/N = 2/3, so each bidder submits a bid equivalent to two-thirds of 
their private value. When there are N = 100 bidders, b* = (N - 1)/N = 99/100, 
so each bidder submits a bid equivalent to 99 per cent of their private value. As 
the number of bidders increases, the optimal bid approaches the bidder’s private 
value. The mathematical derivation of this result is examined in Appendix 1.
The Dutch (descending bid) auction
In a Dutch auction, a bidder’s optimal bidding strategy is to wait until the price 
has fallen a certain amount below their private value, and then (assuming no 
other bidder has already done so) to call out what will instantly become the 
winning bid.
Why is this the optimum bidding strategy? In a Dutch auction, there is clearly 
no point in bidding while the price is higher than your private value, because if 
you do so you pay more than the item is worth to you. There is also no point in 
bidding when the price equals your private value, because if you do so you pay 
exactly what the item is worth to you, so you gain nothing. But if you allow the 
price to drop a little further: either another bidder will enter a bid before you, 
in which case you have not lost anything; or you will still be the first to bid, in 
which case you obtain the item for a price that is lower than your private value 

	
	
	
15.4  Optimal bidding strategies and revenue equivalence	 |	
447
and you gain a positive rent. So, by allowing the price to drop, you can only gain 
and you cannot possibly lose.
How far below your private value should you allow the price to drop before 
entering your bid? The answer turns out to be the same as in the case of the 
first price sealed bid auction. Your bidding strategy should maximise your 
expected rent, based on the conjectural variation assumption that all other bid-
ders’ strategies also maximise their expected rents. And it turns out that the 
bidding strategy which satisfies this condition, and produces a Nash equilib-
rium, is exactly the same as in the case of the first price sealed bid auction. 
Under the previous assumptions (uniformly distributed independent pri-
vate values and risk neutrality), bidder i should bid when the price reaches 
Bi* = b*Vi, where b* = (N - 1)/N, and Vi = bidder i’s private value, as before.
At the Nash equilibrium, the outcomes of the first price sealed bid auction and 
the Dutch auction are always the same. The bidder with the highest private value 
of the item always wins and always pays a price equal to (N - 1)/N times their 
own private value. Again, this result may seem quite surprising, because the rules 
of these two auction formats appear to be very different. However, in both cases 
the information available to bidders when they submit their bids is identical: no 
bidder learns anything about other bidders’ willingness to pay before submitting 
his or her own bid. If bidders behave rationally, there is no difference between 
the outcomes of these two auction formats. Therefore, the first price sealed bid 
auction and the Dutch auction are said to be strategically equivalent.
The revenue equivalence theorem
The final stage in the analysis of the four basic auction formats (based on assump-
tions of uniformly distributed independent private values and risk neutrality) 
involves a comparison of the seller’s expected proceeds in each case. This answers 
a very important question for the seller: which auction format is expected to yield 
the highest price; or, in other words, which auction format should the seller select? 
And the answer based on the preceding analysis, which again may seem surpris-
ing, is that it does not matter! All four auction formats are expected to yield 
exactly the same price to the seller on average. This powerful result in auction 
theory is known as the revenue equivalence theorem. The intuition is as follows:
■ In an English auction, bidders continue to participate until the price reaches 
their own private values. The auction stops when the bidder with the second-
highest value drops out and, at this point, the price payable by the winning 
bidder is determined. Therefore, the seller’s expected price is the expected value 
or expectation of the second-highest private value.
■ In a second price sealed bid auction, each bidder submits a bid equivalent to 
their own private value. Under the second price principle, the winning bidder 
therefore pays a price equivalent to the second-highest private value.
■ In a first price sealed bid auction, each bidder submits a bid some distance 
below their private value. The seller’s expected price is the expected value of 
the highest private value minus the amount by which this bidder shades their 
bid. If all bidders behave rationally when deciding how far to shade their bids,

the seller’s expected price turns out to be the expectation of the second-highest 
private value.
■ In a Dutch auction, each bidder plans to call out when the price has fallen some 
distance below his private value. The seller’s expected price is the expected 
value of the highest private value minus the further amount by which this 
bidder allows the price to drop before calling out. Again, the seller’s expected 
price turns out to be the expectation of the second-highest private value.
When the bidders’ private values are distributed randomly in the range zero 
to one, a general formula for the average price each of the four auction formats 
is expected to yield to the seller is (N - 1)/(N + 1), where N is the number of 
bidders, as before. The mathematical derivation of this result is examined in 
Appendix 1. When there are N = 2 bidders, on average the seller expects to 
receive a price of 1/3 = 0.33. When there are N = 3 bidders, the expected price 
is 2/4 = 0.5. With N = 4 bidders the expected price is 0.6; with N = 10 the 
expected price is 0.82; and with N = 100 the expected price is 0.98. As the num-
ber of bidders increases, two factors tend to work in the seller’s favour. First, in 
a second price sealed bid auction and in a Dutch auction, increased competition 
between bidders results in higher bids being entered. Second, in all four auction 
formats, the probability increases that some bidders will have private values very 
close to the maximum value of one. The higher the bidder’s private value, the 
higher the submitted bid in all four auction cases.
Table 15.2 summarises the results of the analysis of optimal bidding strategies 
and revenue equivalence for the independent private values model. It is important 
to remember that the revenue equivalence theorem relies heavily on the indepen-
dent private values assumption. As will be shown in Section 15.5, for example,

if the pure common value model applies, an English auction produces a higher 
expected price than a first price sealed bid auction (Milgrom and Weber, 1982).
Evidence concerning the empirical validity of the revenue equivalence theorem 
is rather limited. However, Lucking-Reiley (1999) describes an analysis of the 
secondary market for collectable cards. Cards were traded over the internet using 
all four basic auction formats (English, first price sealed bid, second price sealed 
bid and Dutch). The revenues obtained using the Dutch auction format were 
significantly higher than those obtained using the first price sealed bid format, 
even though these two formats are strategically equivalent. However, revenues 
obtained using the English auction format were not significantly higher than 
those obtained in second price sealed bid auctions.

Extensions and additional topics in auction theory
The seller’s optimal auction design, and the reserve price
The revenue equivalence theorem demonstrates that under the assumptions 
adopted in Section 15.4, all four of the basic auction formats yield the same 
expected price to the seller in the independent private values model. Therefore the 
choice between the four formats should be a matter of indifference to the seller. 
However, this does not mean that any (or all) of these four formats are optimal 
from the seller’s perspective, in the sense of producing the highest expected pro-
ceeds under any possible set of rules the seller could devise.
In fact, there is one very obvious reason why these auction rules might be sub-
optimal from the seller’s perspective. If the item being sold has a positive private 
value to the seller, all four basic auction formats (as described so far) leave open 
the possibility that the seller ends up selling the item at a price below the seller’s 
own private value. If the seller’s private value is V0 (assuming 0 … V0 … 1, as 
before) and V0 7 V(1) (where V(1) is the private value of the bidder with the high-
est private value, as before), the seller’s proceeds are certainly below V0 in all four 
auction formats, because no bidder ever bids more than his own private value. 
Even if V(1) 7 V0 but V0 7 V(2), in an English auction the seller’s proceeds are 
below V0, because the bidder with the second-highest private value drops out 
when the bidding reaches V(2). In a second price sealed bid auction, the seller’s 
proceeds are below V0, because the bidder with V(1) pays a price of V(2). In a 
first price sealed bid auction or a Dutch auction, if V(1) 7 V0 7 V(2) the seller’s 
proceeds are below V0 if the submitted bid of the bidder with V(1) is below V0.
This discussion suggests the seller can always increase his expected proceeds 
by specifying a reserve price, and introducing a rule that the item is not sold if 
the price payable by the winning bidder does not at least match (or exceed) the 
reserve price. Suppose, initially, the seller sets a reserve price, denoted r, equiva-
lent to their own private value, so r = V0. (In fact, as will be shown below, the 
seller can do better than this by setting r 7 V0.) In comparison with the case 
where there is no reserve price at all, setting r = V0 can sometimes increase and 
can never reduce the seller’s proceeds. Suppose the price paid by the winning 
bidder in the absence of the reserve price would have been below r = V0. With 

450	
|	 15    ■    Auctions
the reserve price imposed, either the winning bidder pays a higher price of r, or 
the seller retains the item which is worth V0 to the seller. Either way the seller is 
better off. Suppose instead the price paid by the winning bidder in the absence 
of the reserve price would have been above r = V0. In this case the existence of 
the reserve price becomes irrelevant and the outcome is unchanged. Therefore in 
this case the seller is no worse off.
It can be shown mathematically that it is optimal for the seller to set a reserve 
price that is higher than their own private value, so r 7 V0. It is interesting to 
note that this leaves open the possibility of an inefficient allocation of resources: 
if r 7 V(1) 7 V0 the seller retains the item even though there is a bidder who 
values the item more highly than the seller. However, as in the standard case of 
monopoly, an inefficient allocation of resources can be consistent with the maxi-
mization of the seller’s (or monopolist’s) private proceeds (or profit).
What reserve price is optimal from the seller’s perspective? As the seller 
increases the reserve price slightly within the region r 7 V0, there is a trade-off, 
which can be illustrated simply in the case of an English auction. Suppose r is 
already above V0, and the seller is considering a small increase in the reserve 
price from r to r + ∆r.
■ If V(1) 7 r + ∆r 7 r 7 V0, the price paid by the winning bidder increases by 
∆r. The item is still sold and seller’s rent increases from r - V0 to r + ∆r - V0.
■ If r + ∆r 7 V(1) 7 r 7 V0, the bidder with the highest value, who would 
have paid the old reserve price of r, drops out of the bidding before the new 
reserve price of r + ∆r is reached. The item is no longer sold and the seller 
loses out on a rent of r - V0.
The optimal reserve price is the one that maximises this trade-off from the seller’s 
perspective. In the case where all private values are distributed uniformly within 
the range zero to one, the formula for the optimal reserve price is simple: the 
seller should set r = (1 + V0)/2. The mathematical derivation of this result for 
the case of N = 2 bidders is shown in Appendix 1. Accordingly, even if the 
item has no value to the seller, the reserve price should be set at r = 1/2; if the 
seller’s private value is V0 = 1/2, the reserve price should be set at r = 3/4; if 
V0 = 0.8, r = 0.9; if V0 = 0.9, r = 0.95; and so on. It is interesting to note, and 
perhaps counter-intuitive, that under these conditions the optimal reserve price 
does not depend at all on the number of bidders.
Risk-averse bidders
The analysis in Section 15.4 is based on an assumption that the bidders in the 
auction are indifferent to risk or are risk neutral. From the bidder’s perspective, 
the outcomes of all of the auctions examined in this chapter are binary: either the 
bidder wins the auction and gains some rent; or the bidder fails to win the auction 
and gains and loses nothing. Consider the following three auctions:
■ Auction A1, in which the bidder is certain to win the auction and by doing so 
gains a rent of +5.

	
	
	
15.5  Extensions and additional topics in auction theory	 |	
451
■ Auction A2, in which the bidder has a probability of 0.5 of winning the auction 
and gains a rent of +10 if they do win.
■ Auction A3, in which the bidder has a probability of 0.25 of winning the auc-
tion and gains a rent of +20 if they do win.
In A2 and A3, if the bidder fails to win the auction, they gain zero rent. The 
expected rent (calculated by multiplying the rent by the probability of winning) is 
the same in all three cases: 5 * 1 = 10 * 0.5 = 20 * 0.25 = +5. A risk-neutral 
bidder is indifferent between these three auctions, but a risk-averse bidder prefers 
A1 to A2 and A2 to A3. With A1 there is zero risk, because the bidder is certain 
to gain a rent of +5. A2 is more risky than A1, because the certain rent of +5 is 
replaced by possible rents of either +10 or 0. And A3 is riskier still, because the 
variance or spread in the distribution of possible outcomes is even larger: in A2 
the possible outcomes are +10 or 0, but in A3 the possible outcomes are +20 or 
0. This implies a risk-averse bidder would be prepared to trade a reduction in the 
rent gained from winning the auction for an increase in the probability of win-
ning. If a risk-averse bidder prefers A2 to A3, for example, the same bidder might 
perhaps be indifferent between A2′ and A3, where A2′ also offers a probability 
of 0.5 of winning, but a rent of only +8 rather than +10 if the bidder does win. 
The expected rent is lower in A2′ than in A3, but the probability of winning is 
higher, which implies there is less risk.
How does risk aversion affect the optimal bidding strategies considered in 
Section 15.4? The answer to this question is straightforward in the cases of the 
English and Dutch auctions:
■ In an English auction, risk aversion makes no difference to the optimal bidding 
strategy. The only decision the bidder has to make at each stage of the bidding 
is whether to remain in the bidding or drop out. By remaining, the bidder 
retains a chance of gaining a rent for as long as the price is below their private 
value but, by dropping out, the bidder is immediately certain that the rent will 
be zero. Therefore, as before, the bidder remains in the bidding until the price 
reaches their private value and then withdraws.
■ In a Dutch auction, in contrast, risk aversion does affect the optimal bidding 
strategy. As soon as the price has fallen below the bidder’s private value, and 
as it continues to fall further, the bidder has to trade the risk that someone else 
will call out first (so the opportunity of obtaining the item at a price below the 
bidder’s private value is lost) against the possible benefit of allowing the price 
to fall a little further (the possibility of obtaining the item even more cheaply). 
From the previous discussion, it follows that a risk-averse bidder will adopt 
a more cautious attitude to this trade-off than a risk-neutral bidder. In other 
words, in a Dutch auction a risk averse bidder will call out earlier. The risk-
averse bidder is prepared to trade a reduction in the rent he gains by winning 
the auction for a higher probability of winning.
Summarizing, risk aversion makes no difference to bidders’ behaviour in an 
English auction, but it causes bidders to bid more aggressively (in other words, 
higher) in a Dutch auction. Therefore, the revenue equivalence theorem breaks 

452	
|	 15    ■    Auctions
down if bidders are risk averse: a Dutch auction yields a higher expected price to 
the seller than an English auction.
For sealed bid auctions the logic is similar:
■ In a second price sealed bid auction (strategically equivalent to an English 
auction), risk-averse bidders submit bids equivalent to their private values. 
Therefore, a second price sealed bid auction yields the same expected price to 
the seller, regardless of whether bidders are risk neutral or risk averse.
■ In a first price sealed bid auction (strategically equivalent to a Dutch auction), 
risk-averse bidders tend to bid closer to their private values than risk-neutral 
bidders. In other words, risk-averse bidders bid more aggressively (higher) 
than risk-neutral bidders.
Therefore, with risk-averse bidders, a first price sealed bid auction yields a higher 
expected price to the seller than a second price sealed bid auction; and, again, 
revenue equivalence breaks down. This means the seller is no longer indiffer-
ent between the four basic auction formats. With risk-averse bidders, the seller 
should select a Dutch auction or a first price sealed bid auction in preference to 
an English auction or a second price sealed bid auction.
Asymmetric bidders
In some auctions where bidders have independent private values, it may be neces-
sary to relax the assumption that all bidders’ private values are drawn from an 
identical probability distribution. It might be the case that bidders can be split 
into two (or more) groups, with members of one group systematically tending 
to value the item more highly than members of the other group. For example, 
bidders for a work of art might divide into dealers and private collectors. All 
dealers’ valuations might be drawn from one specific probability distribution, 
and all collectors’ valuations might be drawn from another distribution.
With asymmetric bidders, the English auction (and the second price sealed 
bid auction) operates in the same way as in Section 15.4. In the English auc-
tion, the second-last bidder withdraws when the bidding reaches the second-
highest private value across both groups. However, the existence of asymmetric 
bidders complicates the analysis of the first price sealed bid auction (and the 
Dutch auction). In a first price sealed bid auction the bidder submits a bid below 
their private value. How far below depends on the optimal trade-off between the 
increased rent if the submitted bid still wins and the reduced probability of win-
ning. With asymmetric bidders, however, bidders from the two groups will tend 
to form different assessments of this trade-off. Suppose, for example, there are 
four bidders in total: two dealers and two collectors. Suppose also that dealers 
tend to value the item more highly on average than collectors and all bidders are 
aware of this fact.
■ Each collector knows he is competing against two dealers and one other collec-
tor. The collector perceives the competition he faces to be quite fierce: to win 
the auction, he needs to outbid two dealers (who are both likely to value the 
item more highly than he does) and one other collector. To have any realistic 

	
	
	
15.5  Extensions and additional topics in auction theory	 |	
453
chance of winning, the collector feels he must bid aggressively; in other words, 
he submits a bid close to his own private value.
■ Each dealer knows he is competing against one other dealer and two collec-
tors. The dealer does not perceive the competition to be very fierce: to win the 
auction, he only needs to outbid one other dealer and the two collectors (who 
are both likely to value the item less highly than he does). The dealer feels he 
can afford to bid conservatively; in other words, he submits a bid that is some 
considerable amount below his own private value.
In this situation, it is possible that the winning bidder turns out not to be the bid-
der with the highest private value. Suppose dealer 1 has a higher private value than 
collector A, but collector A ends up submitting a higher bid than dealer 1 for the 
reasons outlined above. Then collector A wins the auction, despite not having the 
highest private value. The fact that this outcome has a non-zero probability invali-
dates the revenue equivalence theorem in the case of asymmetric bidders: the first 
price sealed bid auction (or the Dutch auction) generally yields an expected price 
different from that of the English auction (or the second price sealed bid auction). 
Which auction format yields the higher expected price depends on the precise 
nature of the two distributions of private values. Furthermore, the fact that the 
bidder with the highest private value may not always win the auction implies the 
first price sealed bid auction with asymmetric bidders is allocatively inefficient.
McAfee and McMillan (1987) show that the theory of optimal auction design 
in the case of asymmetric bidders can, in some cases, explain or justify (on strictly 
economic criteria) the practice whereby local government departments give pref-
erential treatment to local suppliers for the award of procurement contracts. 
Suppose non-local suppliers have a cost advantage over local suppliers. Then 
the department might find it optimal to allow a local price preference of (say) 5 
per cent; in other words, the lowest local tender wins the contract provided it is 
not more than 5 per cent higher than the lowest non-local tender. At any given 
price, the contract is worth more to a non-local supplier than it is to a local sup-
plier, due to the former’s cost advantage. The price preference policy increases 
the degree of competition perceived by the non-local supplier, encouraging the 
latter to bid more aggressively (tender more cheaply) in the hope that it might 
still win the contract. This tends to operate in the local government department’s 
interest, by lowering the price it expects to pay.
Affiliated valuations and the winner’s curse revisited
In the independent private values model, the individual bidders’ private values of 
the item are completely unrelated: one bidder’s opinion of the value of the item is 
completely irrelevant to other bidders in forming their valuations. In contrast, in 
the pure common value model, in which bidders independently estimate a single 
true value of the item that is the same for all of them, each bidder’s opinion is 
highly relevant to other bidders. If a bidder could collect information about other 
bidders’ valuations, he could assess the true value of the item more accurately.
As shown in Section 15.2, the independent private values model and the pure 
common value model are theoretical extremes, and in many cases bidders’ actual 

454	
|	 15    ■    Auctions
valuations of an item may contain elements of both models. Section 15.2 cited 
the example of a painting, for which a bidder’s personal valuation depends partly 
on their personal tastes, and partly on other people’s tastes, which influence the 
resale value or the prestige the bidder obtains by becoming the owner. Broadly 
speaking, bidders are said to have affiliated valuations if the revelation that one 
bidder perceives the value of the item to be high would cause other bidders to 
increase their assessments of the value of the same item.
When bidders’ valuations are affiliated, bidders tend to bid more aggressively 
in an English auction than they do in the other three basic auction formats. This 
statement is true both in the special case of the pure common value model and in 
the more general case of affiliated valuations. Therefore the English auction yields 
a higher expected price to the seller than the other three basic auction formats. This 
is because the bidders who remain in the bidding as an English auction progresses 
can observe the fact that other bidders have also remained in the bidding and can, 
therefore, infer that these other bidders’ valuations of the item are at least as high 
as the current price. The acquisition of this information lessens the effect of the 
winner’s curse. The bidder who can observe that other bidders are still interested 
at the current price does not have to form such a cautious estimate of the item’s 
true value (conditional on being the winning bidder) as the bidder in the first price 
sealed bid auction, whose bid effectively is submitted in a ‘blind’ condition.
When bidders’ valuations are affiliated (including the special case of the pure 
common value model), revenue equivalence breaks down. The seller should 
use an English auction in preference to any of the other three auction formats, 
because an English auction yields the highest expected price. It can also be shown 
that with affiliated valuations, a second price sealed bid auction yields the seller 
a higher expected price than either a first price sealed bid auction or a Dutch 
auction, both of which yield the same expected price (Milgrom and Weber, 1982; 
McAfee and McMillan, 1987).
Finally, when bidders’ valuations are affiliated (including the pure common 
value model), the seller’s optimal reserve price depends on the auction format and 
on the number of bidders. This also follows from the fact that in the affiliated val-
uations case, any bidder’s valuation of the item conditional on being the winning 
bidder depends on the auction format and on the number of bidders. This result 
is in contrast to the equivalent result for the independent private values model 
(see Section 15.2), in which the optimal reserve price is the same for all four auc-
tion formats, and is independent of the number of bidders (Klemperer, 2002a,b).

Empirical evidence
Much of the empirical research into auctions examines cases that approximate 
to the pure common value model, where the true value of the item is the same 
for all bidders, but this value is not known to any bidder with certainty. Several 
studies have considered how auctions should be designed to maximise the price 
received by the seller. From the seller’s perspective, it is important to design the 
auction in such a way as to maximise competition among bidders; minimise the 
possibility of collusion among bidders; and minimise the tendency for bidders

to reduce their submitted bids in an effort to avoid falling victim to the winner’s 
curse. Case Study  15.1 describes the auction of licences to operate third genera-
tion (3G) mobile telephone services in the UK in 2000. This section provides a 
selective review of empirical studies of auctions. Extended reviews can be found 
in McAfee and McMillan (1987), Smith (1989), Klemperer (1999, 2004), Kagel 
and Levin (2002) and Milgrom (2004).
Experimental evidence
Auction theory lends itself to empirical scrutiny using experimental methods, which 
allow the researcher the opportunity to observe buyer and seller behaviour under 
controlled conditions (Plott, 1989). This subsection describes some representative 
examples. Bazerman and Samuelson (1983) report tests for the existence of a win-
ner’s curse that were conducted using 12 classes of postgraduate students at Boston 
University. Students were asked to submit sealed bids for four jars of objects con-
taining either coins or paperclips. The true value of each jar (based on retail prices 
in the case of jars containing paperclips) was $8. Across 48 auctions, the average 
submitted bid was $5.13, but the average winning bid was $10.01. Therefore, the 
winning bidders fell victim to the winner’s curse, realizing an average loss of $2.01.
Kagel and Levin (1986) conduct experiments in which students participate 
in a sequence of first price sealed bid auctions. The students are each given $10 
accounts, with winning bidders’ balances adjusted for their expenditure and 
the values of any items acquired. Losing bidders’ balances remain unchanged, 
with no monies added or subtracted. Before submitting bids, the students were 
informed of a minimum and maximum possible value of each item for sale. Par-
ticipants were allowed to bid until the balance in their account reached zero. 
Outcomes are compared with the predictions of a theoretical model that assumes 
risk neutrality and rational bidding. In auctions with small numbers of bidders, 
there was a tendency for profits to be realised on average: in auctions with three 
or four bidders, for example, the average profit was just over $4 per auction. 
Losses were realised on average in auctions with more than about six bidders. In 
contrast, the theoretical model predicts average profits of $7.48 and $4.82 at the 
Nash equilibrium, for small and large groups of bidders, respectively.
Case study 15.1
The auction of the UK 3G mobile telephone 
spectrum licences
The sale by auction of spectrum licences to operate third generation (3G) mobile tele-
phone services in the UK, completed in April 2000, raised more than £22.4bn, equiva-
lent to around 2.5 per cent of GNP. 3G technology provides mobile phone users with 

456	
|	 15    ■    Auctions
high-speed internet access. When the earlier second generation (2G) licences were sold, 
telecom firms were required to submit business plans detailing costs and timescales for the 
roll-out of services. Each licence was sold for as little as £40,000, plus an annual licence 
fee. By 2000–1 the total annual 2G licence fee had risen to about 1 per cent of the rental 
value implied by the 3G auction prices. Objectives which informed the design of the 3G 
auctions, both in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, included achieving an efficient allo-
cation of the spectrum, promoting competition, realizing the full economic value of the 
licences, and enabling UK or European operators to play a leading role in the develop-
ment of new technology in telecommunications (Binmore and Klemperer, 2002).
Auction design features
There is extensive evidence that incumbents are more likely to win auctions for licences 
in cases where incumbents have incurred sunk cost investment expenditure in the past. 
This was likely in the case of incumbent 2G licence holders, who had more to lose in the 
3G auction than entrants (Klemperer, 2004). Furthermore, the incumbents were likely to 
enjoy absolute cost advantages over entrants, derived from their existing 2G infrastruc-
ture (Binmore and Klemperer, 2002). Therefore the UK government anticipated (cor-
rectly, as it turned out) that the four existing 2G licence holders would submit winning 
bids for 3G licences. To encourage competition from new bidders, it was decided to grant 
a fifth licence, guaranteeing there would be at least one successful bid from an entrant.
The five 3G licences that were auctioned (labelled A to E) were variable in size: licences 
A and B were both significantly larger than licences C, D and E. To give maximum 
opportunity to entrants, none of the four incumbents was permitted to bid for the largest 
licence A. The auction design involved multiple ascending bids, with full disclosure of the 
present state of the bidding between each bidding round. In the first round, each bidder 
submits a bid for one of the five licences. In subsequent rounds, any bidder who is not 
currently the top bidder for one of the five licences must raise one of the current top bids 
by at least the minimum bid increment, or withdraw. The process continues until only 
five bidders remain. These bidders obtain the licence for which they are the current top 
bidder, at their current bid price.
The design of the 3G bidding process offered several advantages from the UK gov-
ernment’s perspective. Its simultaneous nature ensured that bidding competition would 
spill over from one licence to another. As in an English auction, each bidder’s optimal 
bidding strategy was relatively simple to determine: bidders should stay in the bidding 
until the current prices of all licences exceed the bidder’s own private valuations. And 
as in an English auction, publication of current bids while bidding was underway would 
tend to mitigate the effect of the winner’s curse, enabling each bidder to see that other 
bidders are still involved in the bidding at the current price. The outcome of the auc-
tion should be efficient, in the sense that at the final prices no reallocation of licences 
among bidders could increase the rent of any bidder. Finally, because this was the first 
auction of its kind, the designers were confident that bidders lacked the experience to 
collude effectively.

Participants in the auction were TIW, Vodafone, BT, Deutsche Telecom, Orange, 
NTL, France Telecom, Telefonica, Worldcom, Nomura, Sonera, Global Crossing and 
Eircom. The bidding process took place over a six-week period from March to April 
2000, and lasted for 150 rounds. The entrant TIW took licence A at a price of £4.4bn. 
The incumbent Vodafone secured licence B for £6bn. The other successful incumbent 
bidders were BT, Deutsche Telecom and Orange, who each paid just over £4bn for the 
other three licences.
Other European 3G auctions
Perhaps surprisingly, the successful design of the UK auction appears to have been 
ignored when similar auctions were held in several other European countries (Klemperer, 
2002a,b). For example, in the Netherlands five licences were auctioned to an industry 
comprising five dominant incumbent firms. This design feature appears to have discour-
aged firms other than the five incumbents from bidding, and consequently the revenue 
raised from the auction was disappointing. The Italian government threatened to post-
pone the auction and withdraw licences if no new bidders were forthcoming. In the event, 
only one nominal bid was received from a non-incumbent, and this firm withdrew from 
the bidding at an early stage, raising suspicions of collusion. Eventually five licences 
were awarded to five incumbents, and the revenues raised were lower than expected. In 
Switzerland, joint bids were invited for four licences. Four relatively modest joint bids 
were duly submitted, with the revenues only slightly higher than the government’s reserve 
prices. Denmark had a more successful experience. A sealed bid design was adopted, so 
as to minimise opportunities for collusion between bidders, and encourage bids from 
entrants. A new entrant displaced an incumbent to secure one of the five licences, and the 
total revenue was higher than expected (Klemperer, 2002b).
Was there a winner’s curse?
Cable et al. (2002) use share price data for the successful and unsuccessful bidders in the 
UK 3G licence auction to assess the effect of the announcement of the outcome of the auc-
tion on the share prices or market values of the companies involved. Event-study method-
ology examines movements in company share prices immediately before and after some 
event that is expected to influence the stock market valuation of the companies involved, 
controlling for the company’s typical response to any general stock market movement 
that may have occurred on the day of the event. This methodology is applied to the share 
price data of the winning and losing bidders, around the time of the announcement of the 
outcome of the auction in April 2000. One winning bidder, Orange, was excluded from 
the analysis due to several changes of ownership during the estimation and event periods. 
By the time of the auction Orange was owned by Vodafone, which submitted a separate 
winning bid, thereby contravening a rule preventing ownership of more than one licence. 
Vodafone was subsequently required to divest itself of Orange.

458	
|	 15    ■    Auctions
On the first trading day following the announcement, the shares of three of the success-
ful bidders (BT, TIW, Vodafone) increased in value, while Deutsche Telekom (One2One) 
declined in value. Several of the losing bidders (NTL, Worldcom, Nomura and Sonera) 
increased in value but a number of others (France Telecom, Telefonica, Global Crossing 
and Eircom) declined in value. Overall, the pattern was rather inconsistent. Over a 30-day 
period following the announcement, of the winning bidders only Vodafone increased in 
value. Among the losing firms, there was again little consistent pattern in the change in 
the share price over the same 30-day period.
To assess whether the successful bidders were subject to the winner’s curse, cumulative 
returns on the combined values of portfolios of winning and losing bidders are calculated 
over the rest of the calendar year following the announcement of the auction result. Over a 
30-day period following the announcement, the portfolio of losing firms recorded a 1 per 
cent loss, while the portfolio of winning firms recorded a 7 per cent loss. Subsequently, 
however, the performance of the two portfolios converged, and there was no lasting dif-
ference in performance. Overall, there is little systematic evidence of any winner’s curse.
There is no evidence that the outcome of the auction was anything but efficient 
and, further, no case for easing the regulatory stance in the industry on the 
grounds that the successful licence bidders paid too much.
(Cable et al., 2002, p. 459)
Between 2000 and 2003 most telecom firms experienced large share-price reductions. This 
was a global phenomenon, which affected the winners and losers in the UK’s 3G auction 
in equal measure. With the benefit of hindsight, it seems clear that winning bidders paid 
far more for the licences in 2000 than they would have paid two or three years later. The 
auction appears to have distributed wealth from the shareholders of the winning bidders 
to the UK government (Klemperer, 2002c). However, it has been suggested that the win-
ning bidders have subsequently used their ownership of the licences to impede entry and 
retard the rate of take-up of 3G technology, while at the same time seeking to renegotiate 
terms and conditions. Delaying the take-up of 3G technology has enabled these firms to 
extend the profitable lifetime of the older 2G technology (Ozanich et al., 2004).

Premier League rights auction likely heading  
to second round
FT
Premier League executives spent Friday assessing first-round bids for its UK live TV 
rights but reached no conclusion, suggesting that the auction process will go to a second

round of bidding next week. Premier League broadcasters Sky and BT are locked in battle 
for the 2016–19 rights, but may have to factor in the entry of other contenders for the 
seven sought-after packages of matches. Discovery Communications has been pondering 
a first-time bid and Al Jazeera may also be in the frame. There are 168 matches available, 
and no bidder can be awarded more than five packages.
The Premier League declined to comment on the process, but insiders said there was 
no prospect of any formal announcement at this stage and that the process was ongoing. 
That is likely to mean that bids have been competitive and too close to each other to 
determine a clear winner, requiring at least another round of bidding. The Premier League 
will not make an official announcement until bidding for all seven packages is concluded. 
Three years ago, it took six days to decide the outcome of the 2013–16 rights.
Premier League auctions do not have a set number of rounds. When the contest goes 
to a second round, bidders are not told whether they are in the lead, or what rivals have 
bid. ‘It has more intrigue and shenanigans than other’ rights auctions, said one former 
participant. The stakes are particularly high for Sky, which has built the UK’s largest 
pay-TV business over the past two decades through its dominance of Premier League 
coverage. Losing key matches—including the 4pm kick-offs on Sunday—could cut the 
company’s profits by up to one-fifth, analysts estimated.
Virgin Media, the cable group that is a rival to BT and Sky, has complained to com-
munications regulator Ofcom about the auction process, saying that it has led to English 
football fans paying the highest price in Europe for a relatively small number of televised 
games. Ofcom last week rejected Virgin’s request to pause the auction, but it could yet 
order the contest to be re-run or the results altered, in its final decision on the complaint, 
expected next month.

Laboratory experiments of this kind have been subject to criticism from sev-
eral directions. Kagel et al. (1989) and Kagel and Richard (2001) demonstrate 
that learning and experience gained by bidders over a series of auctions tends to 
reduce the impact of the winner’s curse. However, even with experienced bidders, 
outcomes are not always fully consistent with the theoretical model’s prescrip-
tions for rational bidding behaviour. Hansen and Lott (1991) attribute the aver-
age losses realised by bidders in the Kagel and Levin (1986) study to a tendency 
for aggressive bidding, in a rather artificial case in which participants can lose 
no more than their initial balances.
Reliance upon inexperienced student volunteers might represent a significant 
shortcoming of many experimental studies, if there are systematic differences 
between the behaviour of volunteers and that of experienced professional deci-
sion-makers. Dyer et al. (1989) report an experiment in which the behaviour of 
construction industry executives was compared with that of student volunteers, 
in a common value auction in which participants submitted tenders to become 

460	
|	 15    ■    Auctions
the lowest-cost supplier. Perhaps surprisingly, there was little difference in the 
behaviour or performance of students and executives, with both falling victim 
to the winner’s curse.
Cox and Hayne (1998) investigate possible differences in behaviour between 
experiments in which bidders are organised into teams and experiments with indi-
vidual bidders. The hypothesis is that team decision-making may help reduce the 
impact of individual judgemental errors on bidding behaviour. In experiments 
where individuals and teams receive one signal each, there is little difference in 
performance, and susceptibility to the winner’s curse is mainly a function of the 
experience of the participants. However, in experiments with multiple signals 
(for example, each member of a team of five receives a separate signal, while an 
individual bidder receives all five signals), teams appear to handle the multiple 
signal data significantly less effectively than individuals.
Field evidence
Capen et al. (1971) are widely credited for providing the first field evidence relat-
ing to the phenomenon of the winner’s curse. As noted in Section 15.3, this study 
examined the bidding for oil and gas drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico during 
the 1950s and 1960s. In a number of auctions the winning bids were many times 
higher than the next-highest bids, suggesting that some form of winner’s curse 
was operative. For example, in Alaska in 1969 the winning bids were at least 
twice as large as the next-highest bids in 77 per cent of all cases. In follow-up 
studies, Mead et al. (1983) found after-tax rates of return to have been below 
the average return on equity for US manufacturing corporations, and expressed 
qualified support for the existence of a winner’s curse. Hendricks et al. (1987) 
report that firms granted leases between 1954 and 1969 in auctions involving 
more than six bidders earned low or negative returns. The bids submitted by 
around two-thirds of the firms investigated were significantly higher than those 
that would produce a Nash equilibrium in the theoretical model.
The results of the experiments indicate that a few firms did not behave 
optimally, and that, in at least one case, a firm [Texaco] consistently 
overestimated the value of the tracts. Most firms seemed aware that their 
valuations of tracts they win are biased upward, although a subset of the 
firms may have underestimated the extent of this bias.
(Hendricks et al., 1987, p. 518)
Drawing on the results of an earlier study by Cassing and Douglas (1980), Ble-
cherman and Camerer (1998) test for the winner’s curse in wage offers made to 
players in US major league baseball in 1990. Two groups of players were exam-
ined: players who were free agents at the time of signing (and who were eligible to 
sell their services to the highest bidder); and players who were already on unex-
pired contracts and therefore ineligible for free agent status. In the absence of a 
winner’s curse, players’ salaries should be equivalent to their marginal revenue 
products (MRP). MRPs are estimated for both groups of players and compared

with actual salaries. The average salary of free agents was $934,000, and the 
average estimated MRP was $605,000. For players without free agent status, 
the equivalent figures were $712,000 and $704,000. This suggests a tendency 
for teams that signed free agents to have overpaid and experienced the winner’s 
curse. The contract system can be interpreted as a form of collusion between team 
owners who seek to avoid becoming involved in competitive bidding wars and 
overpaying for the services of star players.
Lee and Malmendier (2011) use a large dataset of prices paid for goods avail-
able immediately for purchase at a fixed price or via auction. They find that in 
the majority of auctions, the final price paid by the winning bidder is higher than 
the price at which an identical product could be purchased on the same website. 
Overbidding is more likely in auctions with a long bidding period and a large 
number of participants. Interestingly the evidence suggests experienced bidders 
are most likely to suffer from the winner’s curse.
The market for corporate takeover is another in which the possibility of a win-
ner’s curse arises. In cases where a number of bidders are competing to take over a 
firm and the highest offer wins, it seems likely there may be a systematic tendency 
for winning bidders to overbid. Assessing the evidence presented in a number of 
empirical studies, Roll (1986) finds acquiring firms do tend to pay a substantial 
premium over and above the market value of the firms they acquire. This premium 
cannot be explained by subsequent increases in post-acquisition performance (see 
Section 19.3). Many merger decisions may be driven by either peer pressure or 
hubris and may not be explicable in terms of rational economic calculus.
Case study 15.3
What determines the prices of goods traded in 
online auctions?
The growth of the internet has created new opportunities for trading by auction. A huge 
volume of goods is now traded daily through the eBay websites around the world. Online 
auctions provide a convenient low-cost environment for buyers and sellers to trade. The 
search engine technology underlying online auctions allows buyers and sellers to trade 
specialised products in liquid markets.
Founded in 1995 by Pierre Omidyar, eBay created an electronic platform for the sale of 
goods and services. eBay is not a traditional firm, even by the standards of the internet, 
because it does not hold any stock. Instead it acts as a broker to facilitate trade between 
buyers and sellers, by bringing them into contact with one another. In any transaction, 
the seller can set the opening price, a (secret) reserve price (if they wish), and the duration 
of the auction (between three and ten days). Bidders submit bids, which can be raised at 
any time within the auction period. Because the duration is fixed, many bidders post their 
bids during the last few hours or minutes of the auction period. When the auction closes 

462	
|	 15    ■    Auctions
and a winning bid is selected, the buyer and seller make contact. At this point the buyer 
pays for the goods via a PayPal account (an online payments system purchased by eBay 
in 2002), and the seller ships the goods to the buyer.
Information concerning the reliability of buyers and sellers can be obtained from pub-
lished data concerning their previous trading history. Under this system, buyers and 
sellers rate the experience of trading with each other (following a transaction) as positive 
(+1), negative (-1), or neutral (0). Cumulative ratings are displayed for each trader. 
A rating exceeding +10 receives a star, while a rating below -4 leads to a trader being 
banned from further use of eBay. For the use of its services, eBay charges sellers a listing 
fee and a commission based on the value of the transaction.
Several academic economists have investigated the behaviour of buyers and sellers in 
auctions. Particular interest has focused on the impact of asymmetric information, repu-
tation effects and the degree of trust between buyers and sellers on traders’ behaviour. 
This literature is surveyed by Bajari and Hortacsu (2004). For example, Lucking-Reiley 
et al. (2007) analyse the determinants of the prices of 461 collectable coins (Indian Head 
pennies) that were traded on eBay during July and August 1999. Data were collected on 
the age and grade of the coin; the minimum submitted bid; the final submitted bid; the 
number of bids; the reserve price (if any); the seller’s rating; the duration of the auction; 
and whether or not the auction period included a weekend. Results from the analysis 
included the following:
■ Positive (negative) seller ratings lead to higher (lower) prices. Negative ratings have 
more impact on price than positive ratings.
■ Longer auctions fetch higher prices.
■ Reserve prices fetch higher prices (especially when only one bidder participates).

Summary
An auction is a market mechanism for converting bids from market participants 
into decisions concerning the allocation of resources and prices. Auctions can be 
characterised by the rules for the submission of bids, for determining the identity 
of the winning bidder, and for determining the price the winning bidder pays. 
There are four basic auction formats:
■ The English auction or ascending bid auction requires bids to be raised succes-
sively until a price is reached which only one bidder is willing to pay.
■ The Dutch auction or descending bid auction requires the offer price to be 
lowered successively until a price is reached which a bidder is prepared to pay.
■ The first price sealed bid auction requires bidders to submit sealed bids inde-
pendently. The highest bidder pays a price equivalent to the winning bid.

	
	
	
15.7  Summary	 |	
463
■ The second price sealed bid auction also requires bidders to submit indepen-
dent sealed bids. The highest bidder pays a price equivalent to the second-
highest submitted bid.
The simplest theoretical models of auctions are based on two alternative 
assumptions concerning the distribution of bidders’ valuations of the item under 
auction.
■ In the pure common value model, there is a single, intrinsic value of the item 
that is the same for all bidders. No single bidder knows what this true value is. 
Each bidder estimates the item’s true value independently.
■ In the independent private values model, each bidder knows the true value of 
the item to him or herself personally. Personal valuations of the item differ 
between bidders.
The winner’s curse is a common feature of auctions where the pure common 
value model applies, especially those conducted using the first price sealed bid 
format. If all bidders submit bids equivalent to their private estimates of the 
item’s intrinsic value, it is likely the winning bidder will have overestimated the 
intrinsic value. To avoid the winner’s curse, each bidder’s sealed bid should be 
based on a revised estimate of this value, conditional on the original estimate 
being the highest estimate made by any bidder.
In the independent private values model, if risk-neutral bidders pursue optimal 
bidding strategies which maximise their own private rents, all four basic auction 
formats are expected to yield the same expected price to the seller. This result is 
known as the revenue equivalence theorem.
In all four basic auction formats, the seller increases their expected proceeds 
by specifying a reserve price, such that the item is not sold if the selling price does 
not at least match (or exceed) the reserve price. The optimal reserve price is usu-
ally some distance above the seller’s private valuation of the item. If bidders are 
risk averse, the optimal bidding strategy in an English auction or a second price 
sealed bid auction is unaffected. Risk-averse bidders tend to bid more aggres-
sively in a Dutch auction or a first price sealed bid auction, in an effort to reduce 
the risk of not winning the auction. If bidders are asymmetric (split into two 
groups with private values drawn from different distributions), revenue equiva-
lence breaks down. In this situation, it is possible that the winning bidder is not 
the bidder with the highest private value.
The pure common values model and the independent private values model are 
theoretical extremes. An affiliated valuations model allows bidders’ valuations to 
be partly dependent on the intrinsic value of the item, but also partly subjective. 
When bidders’ valuations are affiliated, revenue equivalence breaks down. An 
English auction yields the highest expected price to the seller, because the bidders’ 
ability to observe each other’s behaviour while bidding is underway mitigates 
the effects of the winner’s curse. In the UK, this result helped inform the design 
of the government’s successful auction of licences to operate mobile telephone 
services using 3G technology, which took place in April 2000.

Introduction
Most markets are typified by some degree of product differentiation. There is 
no single homogeneous brand of car, soap powder, hotel, T-shirt or breakfast 
cereal. Product differentiation can be viewed as the ability of producers to cre-
ate distinctions (in a physical or in a psychological sense) between goods that 
are close substitutes, so that consumers no longer regard them as identical or 
near-identical.

	
	
	
16.1  Introduction	 |	
467
Chapter 16 deals with product differentiation as a topic in industrial organi-
zation in its own right for the first time. However, product differentiation has 
already had an important role to play in several earlier chapters, and it will do 
so again later in this book. For example, in Chapter 3 the degree of product dif-
ferentiation was cited as one of the defining characteristics of market structure. 
The theoretical model of monopolistic competition refers to an industry in which 
a large number of firms compete to produce and sell similar but slightly differ-
entiated products or services. In Chapters 7, 8 and 9 product differentiation is 
one of the principal forms of non-price competition open to oligopolists seeking 
to avoid becoming embroiled in damaging price competition. In Chapter 10, the 
issue of market definition was seen to depend on decisions as to where to draw 
the dividing line between groups of products that, on the basis of degree of simi-
larity, might be considered either as part of the same market, or as comprising 
separate markets. In Chapter 12, product differentiation (or brand proliferation) 
was cited as one of the strategies an incumbent firm can adopt in order to raise 
barriers to entry.
Section 16.2 begins by drawing a distinction between vertical and horizon-
tal product differentiation, and identifying a number of natural and strategic 
sources of product differentiation. This section also draws a distinction between 
two types of economic model of product differentiation. In representative con-
sumer models, consumers have tastes or preferences for goods or services, and 
firms compete to attract consumers by differentiating the products they offer. 
In spatial or location models, consumers’ tastes or preferences are defined in 
terms of the individual characteristics that are embodied in the goods or ser-
vices. Section 16.3 develops an analysis of the implications of product differen-
tiation for social welfare in the representative consumer model of monopolistic 
competition. This analysis suggests that, in this model, only by accident does 
the degree of product differentiation at the post-entry equilibrium maximise 
social welfare.
The next three sections present a series of spatial or location models of 
product differentiation. Section 16.4 develops Lancaster’s product charac-
teristics model, in which goods are viewed as bundles of characteristics, and 
differentiated goods or brands contain the same characteristics in varying 
proportions. Section 16.5 develops Hotelling’s model of spatial competition. 
In the original version of this model, geographic location is the characteristic 
that differentiates one supplier’s product from another. However, the same 
approach has been widely used to model competition in product characteristic 
space. In one variant of the model, two firms choose locations on a straight 
line, with prices assumed fixed. An alternative variant allows for price deter-
mination with fixed locations. Finally, Section 16.6 examines Salop’s adapta-
tion of the Hotelling model, in which both firms and consumers are located 
around the circumference of a circle. In this case, both locations and prices are 
endogenous, and there is free entry. The model’s solution is analogous to the 
post-entry equilibrium in the neoclassical (representative consumer) model of 
monopolistic competition.

Types of product differentiation
In the economics literature, it is customary to distinguish between vertical and 
horizontal product differentiation (Beath and Katsoulacos, 1991). First, vertical 
product differentiation means one product or service differs in overall quality 
from another. For example, one brand of fruit juice may have higher fruit con-
tent and lower sugar content than another brand, and as such is recognised as a 
higher-quality brand by all consumers. If the prices of the high-fruit brand and 
the high-sugar brand were the same, most or all consumers would purchase the 
high-fruit brand. Second, horizontal product differentiation means products or 
services are of the same or similar overall quality, but offer different combina-
tions of characteristics. For example, Ford Focus, Vauxhall Astra, Honda Civic, 
Volkswagen Golf and Toyota Corolla are all similar brands or models of car, but 
each one offers a slightly different package of attributes. Most drivers of cars in 
the relevant class would be able to express a preference in favour of one of these 
brands or models, but different drivers might well express different preferences.
It may be useful to classify the distinguishing characteristics of differentiated 
products and services as either natural or strategic. With natural product dif-
ferentiation, the distinguishing characteristics arise from natural attributes or 
characteristics, rather than having been created through the deliberate actions of 
suppliers. With strategic product differentiation, the distinguishing characteristics 
are consciously created by suppliers; for example, through a decision to create 
a new brand and promote it by means of advertising or other types of market-
ing activity. Sometimes, however, the distinction between natural and strategic 
product differentiation is not clear-cut. For example, suppliers might attempt to 
reinforce or strengthen consumers’ perceptions of natural product differences 
through strategies such as advertising or branding.
Sources of natural product differentiation include the following:
■ Geographic variation. In this case, the location of a seller automatically differen-
tiates a product or service in the minds of consumers. Clearly the corner shop 
and the out-of-town superstore offer competing services that are differentiated 
in the minds of consumers on the basis of location (as well as other character-
istics such as choice and price). In the residential property market, houses that 
are identical in every other respect might be highly differentiated in terms of 
the town, city or region in which they are located.
■ New technology. New technology can be used to differentiate a product; for 
example, through the addition of internet and email features to a mobile tele-
phone. Procter & Gamble has been successful in differentiating many of its 
products through the introduction of new technological features. Examples 
include the Swiffer mop that captures dust, and the Nutri-Delight orange 
drink, which has a special formula allowing iodine to coexist with certain 
vitamins and minerals, and which it is claimed permits children to gain weight.
■ Brands and trademarks. Trademarks are words or symbols used to identify 
particular brands. Brands and trademarks have been used throughout the

history of commerce to differentiate similar products (Moore and Reid, 
2008). In many cases, a firm that has developed a trademark will also hold 
exclusive property rights to use the trademark. Examples include a croco-
dile, an eagle or a polo player on horseback (Lacoste, Armani or Ralph 
Lauren clothing). In some cases, the brand or trademark eventually becomes 
synonymous with the product. For example, the brand name Hoover has 
become widely used as a generic term for any vacuum cleaner. For many, 
the company name Google has become synonymous with internet search. In 
such cases the brand owner may eventually lose its exclusive property rights 
(Bryson, 1994).
■ Community or national differences. The country or community of origin might 
be the defining attribute that differentiates goods and services. In other words, 
products and services from certain parts of the world are deemed to be differ-
ent and of higher quality. Examples include Devon custard, Russian vodka, 
Scottish whisky, Swiss watches, curry from the Indian subcontinent, Italian 
designer clothes and Hollywood movies.
■ Consumer tastes and preferences. Consumers themselves have different attri-
butes, tastes and preferences. Consequently, the product characteristics that 
are most desired vary from one consumer to another. Product differentiation 
targeted at meeting these varied wants is often horizontal. Examples include 
the colour of cars and the style of clothes.
Sources of strategic product differentiation include the following:
■ Additional services. Additional services can often be used to differentiate 
products. Even if the same product is available from two suppliers, the con-
ditions surrounding the sale might be different. Suppliers might differentiate 
their products by offering cheaper credit, faster delivery times or a more 
comprehensive after-sales service. By offering after-sales guarantees or war-
ranties, the supplier sends signals to consumers that it has confidence in the 
quality of its product.
■ Rate of change of product differentiation. Products with a short natural lifespan 
can be subjected to planned obsolescence, especially in cases where the prod-
uct accounts for a relatively small proportion of most consumers’ budgets. 
Consumers might be urged to purchase new styles or models with superficial 
changes in characteristics. Products such as clothing and video games are 
often subject to this form of strategic product differentiation. The Monopo-
lies and Mergers Commission (1966) and Schmalensee (1978) present evi-
dence of such behaviour in the UK detergents and US ready-to-eat cereals 
markets, respectively.
■ Factor variations. Factor inputs such as labour and capital are rarely homo-
geneous. This creates opportunities for final outputs produced using differ-
entiated factors of production to be marketed as distinct from those of other 
firms. For example, a supplier might claim its employees are more highly 
skilled, better trained or less prone to make errors; or that its components or 
raw material inputs are superior to those used by rival suppliers.

470	
|	 16    ■    Product differentiation
■ Consumer ignorance. Ignorance on the part of consumers can allow firms to 
exaggerate the extent of differentiation of their products and services. Sup-
pliers sometimes exploit consumer ignorance through misleading advertis-
ing. Sometimes suppliers attempt to convince consumers that higher prices 
reflect higher quality (Scitovsky, 1950, 1971). If such attempts are successful, 
the level of consumer demand might even increase as price increases. Chawla 
(2002) discusses the role of consumer ignorance in determining prices for 
health treatment in private practice. In the Egyptian private health sector in 
the late 1990s, patients were poorly informed and prices were relatively high 
as a consequence.
In the economics literature, there are two basic approaches to the specifica-
tion of consumer preferences and the modelling of firm behaviour in the case 
of horizontal product differentiation (Waterson, 1994). First, in representative 
consumer models consumers have tastes or preferences for goods or services, and 
firms compete to attract consumers by differentiating the goods or services 
they offer. Each firm’s demand is a continuous function of its own price and the 
prices set by competing firms. This is true even in models where competition is 
atomistic. In the neoclassical model of monopolistic competition, developed in 
Section 3.5, each firm assumes its own individual pricing decision provokes a 
negligible response from its rivals.
Second, in spatial or location models consumers have tastes or preferences for 
the characteristics embodied in goods or services. In this case, consumer demand 
for a particular firm’s product might be highly dependent on small changes in 
the price set by another firm whose product embodies a very similar bundle of 
characteristics, but be independent of small changes in the price set by a third 
firm, whose product characteristics are further removed. Consider the high-
street food chains McDonald’s, Burger King and Pizza Hut. If Burger King 
implements a small price cut, this might have a significant effect on demand 
at McDonald’s, but if Pizza Hut does the same, this might have no effect on 
demand at ­McDonald’s (or at Burger King). Only if Pizza Hut implements a 
large price cut would consumers who normally buy burgers consider switching 
to pizzas. This suggests that McDonald’s’ demand might be a smooth function 
of Burger King’s price because the product characteristics are so similar, but is a 
discontinuous function of Pizza Hut’s price because the product characteristics 
are further removed.
	
16.3	
Monopolistic competition revisited: the socially optimal 
amount of product differentiation
This section develops an analysis of the implications of product differentiation 
for social welfare in the model of monopolistic competition that was developed 
earlier (see Section 3.5). Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) provide an extended treatment 
of some of the issues that are raised, next.
The discussion begins by recalling the pre-entry and post-entry equilibria 
for a representative firm in monopolistic competition (see Figure 3.8). At the 

	
	
	 16.3  Monopolistic competition revisited: the socially optimal amount of product	 |	
471
pre-entry equilibrium, the firm earns an abnormal profit equivalent to the 
area C1P1BD. This abnormal profit attracts entrants, whose presence reduces 
the quantity the representative firm can sell at any price, and shifts the firm’s 
demand or average revenue function to the left. At the post-entry equilibrium, 
the tangency solution is attained and the representative firm’s abnormal profit 
has disappeared.
For the purposes of examining the welfare implications of product differen-
tiation, the pre-entry equilibrium shown earlier (see Figure 3.8) is interpreted 
as depicting the situation when the representative firm is the only firm in the 
industry. This interpretation was not used earlier (see Section 3.5), where it was 
simply assumed that there are fewer firms present at the pre-entry stage than at 
the post-entry stage. Logically, however, there is no difficulty in carrying out 
the pre-entry analysis for the extreme case where only one firm is present. This 
implies that the shift from the pre-entry to the post-entry equilibrium illustrated 
earlier (see Figure 3.8) can be interpreted as depicting a change in the number of 
firms from N1 = 1 to N2, the number of firms at the post-entry equilibrium at 
which each firm earns only a normal profit.
In order to establish the welfare implications of increasing product differentia-
tion, it is necessary to determine the implications for total producer surplus or 
abnormal profit, and for total consumer surplus as the number of firms increases 
from N1 = 1 to N2. This relationship is derived in Figure 16.1. The construction 
is as follows:
■ The function p (N) shows the relationship between N, the number of firms, and 
the abnormal profit earned by the representative firm (represented by the area 
C1P1BD in Figure 3.8 for the case N = 1). It is assumed that as N increases 
and the average revenue functions of incumbent firms start shifting to the left, 
their abnormal profits decrease smoothly. p(N2) = 0 because at the post-entry

■ The function PS(N) = N * p(N) shows the relationship between the number 
of firms and the total producer surplus or abnormal profit earned by all firms 
collectively. Starting from N = 1, a second firm can enter and earn an abnor-
mal profit that exceeds the reduction in the first firm’s abnormal profit result-
ing from this entry decision. Therefore, total abnormal profit increases as the 
number of firms increases from N = 1 to N = 2. Similarly, for other small 
values of N, further entry causes the total abnormal profit to increase, since 
each entrant’s abnormal profit exceeds the total loss of abnormal profit to the 
incumbents. Eventually, however, as N continues to increase, total abnormal 
profit must start to decrease. PS(N) = N * p(N) must attain a value of zero 
when the number of firms reaches N2, since p(N2) = 0.
■ The function CS(N) shows the relationship between the number of firms and 
the total consumer surplus. In the case N1 = 1, consumer surplus was repre-
sented previously by the area P1AB (see Figure 3.8). As the number of firms 
increases and each incumbent firm’s average revenue function starts shifting 
to the left, total consumer surplus increases for two reasons: first, entry causes 
total industry output to increase and prices to fall; and second, as more variety 
is introduced, each consumer is more likely to find a brand that matches their 
tastes more closely.
■ Finally, the function TS(N) = PS(N) + CS(N) shows the relationship between 
the number of firms and the total surplus, calculated as the vertical summa-
tion of PS(N) and CS(N). In Figure 16.1, TS(N) attains its maximum value at 
N = N*, below N2. Therefore, in this case, there is too much product differen-
tiation at the post-entry equilibrium. However, the opposite case is also possible.

In Figure 16.2, TS(N) attains its maximum value at N = N**, above N2. In this 
case there is too little product differentiation at the post-entry equilibrium.
The main conclusion that emerges from this analysis is that only by coincidence is 
social welfare maximised at the post-entry equilibrium in monopolistic competi-
tion. The number of firms at the post-entry equilibrium is determined by entrants 
examining whether or not they obtain a positive private benefit (abnormal profit) 
if they enter. However, each entry decision also imposes costs and benefits on 
other parties, which are not considered by the entrant. By increasing industry 
output and reducing prices, entry tends to reduce the producer surplus (abnor-
mal profits) of incumbent firms, but it also tends to increase consumer surplus. 
Whether the number of firms, and therefore the amount of product differentia-
tion, at the post-entry equilibrium is too high or too low (from a social welfare 
maximization perspective) depends on which of these two effects dominates. If 
the negative producer surplus effect dominates, there is too much product dif-
ferentiation; but if the positive consumer surplus effect dominates, there is too 
little product differentiation. Only by coincidence, if these two effects are evenly 
balanced, is the degree of product differentiation optimal.

Lancaster’s product characteristics model
In Sections 16.4 to 16.6, the discussion switches away from the representative 
consumer model of monopolistic competition, towards a number of spatial or 
location models of product differentiation. The first model to be examined is 
Lancaster’s (1966) product characteristics model. In this model, consumers 
derive utility not from the goods they consume but from the characteristics 
that are embodied in those goods. Goods are viewed as bundles of charac-
teristics, and differentiated goods or brands are goods that contain the same 
characteristics in different proportions. For example, when you decide which 
car to buy, you consider an array of characteristics. Car manufacturers produce 
glossy brochures listing characteristics such as safety features, performance, 
comfort, seating, security, styling, in-car entertainment and so on. Similarly, 
mobile telephones are marketed by product characteristics: does the phone have 
a camera, personal organiser, polyphonic ring tones, predictive text, vibrating 
alert, video capture, voice-activated dialling, FM radio and so on? The average 
car or mobile telephone purchaser is not interested in every available model. He 
or she narrows the choice down to those models that come close to delivering the 
desired bundle or mix of characteristics. Many product markets are saturated 
with huge numbers of models and product types. During a visit to his local 
store, Schwartz (2004) counted 85 varieties of crackers, 285 varieties of cookies, 
85 brands of juices, 75 iced teas, 15 flavours of bottled water, 61 varieties of sun 
protection products, 80 pain relievers, 40 toothpastes, 150 lipsticks, 75 eyeliners, 
90 nail polishes, 116 skin creams and 360 brands of shampoo and other hair care 
products. Case Study 16.1 offers other examples.

Cut and pastiche
FT
‘There are simply too many notes, that’s all. Just cut a few and it will be perfect.’ 
Joseph II’s friendly advice to Mozart – as presented in Peter Shaffer’s screenplay for the 
film Amadeus – provokes harsh laughter from any writer who has dealt with the editor’s 
pen. Mozart is said to have replied, ‘Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?’ Mozart’s 
urbane response made the emperor look absurd. But Tyler Cowen, an economics profes-
sor at George Mason University, seems to have a similar perspective in his new book 
about arts funding, Good and Plenty: ‘Mozart’s Don Giovanni has musical beauty, terror, 
comedy and a sense of the sublime, making it a favourite of opera connoisseurs. But what 
if consumers draw their comedy from one work, their terror from another, their beautiful 
music from yet another, and so on?’ Cowen knows that the idea is outrageous for Don 
Giovanni, but not so for lesser works.
Move away from the peaks of artistic creation and there lie many albums, books, 
television shows and films whose artistic qualities are unbundled, tweaked and repack-
aged to suit the demands of the petty emperor in all of us. Music is remixed in ‘mash-
ups’ combining vocals from one source and instrumentation from another. Favourite 
sitcom characters gain independent life in their own shows. Films are released and 
re-released offering director’s cuts and a choice of endings. What is more, these lesser 
packages of comedy and terror, not Don Giovanni, are the artistic products that most 
of us consume in quantity. Products are bundles of characteristics. Sometimes the char-
acteristics are easy to spot and interchangeable, such as your MP3 player’s memory, 
battery life and styling. Sometimes, as with Don Giovanni, part of the product’s appeal 
is that the characteristics are perfectly balanced. But more often than we might think, 
we gain real satisfaction from being able to choose from products with a different 
range of attributes.
The man who first thought of products as bundles of valuable characteristics was the 
Australian economist, Kelvin Lancaster. He realised that customers do not much like 
‘one size fits all’ and would prefer to have products that exactly matched their needs. 
The reason we do not all enjoy perfectly tailored products is not that the idea is absurd 
– although it is easy to mock ‘the ultimate chill-out album’ – but because of increas-
ing returns to scale. I would like to hear U2 produce more tracks such as ‘Acrobat’ 
and ‘Exit’, but Bono and company do not find it profitable to write them just for me. 
Lancaster showed that producers can do a better job of satisfying individual customers 
when the market is bigger. In London I can find something close to my ideal restaurant 
experience because there are enough people like me to keep the restaurant afloat. In a 
small town a restaurant cannot survive on the passing trade of one person per decade 
with Tim Harford’s tastes, so I have to enjoy what is there, even if it is not quite what I 
would have chosen myself.
The same should be true of the arts, and that is one reason why fears of global 
homogenisation are overstated. Given that there are more customers out there than

ever before, and given that it is easier to move around goods and services too, it is 
now much more likely that there will be kindred spirits who share my tastes enough 
to encourage some entrepreneurial artist to produce exactly the products I want. 
I can find them too. I searched the internet for ‘Don Giovanni abridged’. It turns 
out, incredibly, that such a work exists and was performed in New York this month.

Figure 16.3  Lancaster’s product characteristics model
In Figure 16.3, a consumer obtains utility from the consumption of two char-
acteristics. The quantities of each characteristic are shown along the axes of the 
diagram and IC is the consumer’s indifference curve. Indifference curves for 
characteristics have the usual properties: more of each characteristic is always 
preferred to less of the same characteristic, and the indifference curves are con-
vex to the origin. The four rays represent the proportions of characteristics 1 
and 2 that are available from brands A, B, C and D. For example, brand A 
offers lots of characteristic 1 but very little of characteristic 2. Brand D offers 
the opposite combination. Brands B and C offer more balanced combinations

of characteristics 1 and 2. Table 16.1 shows some examples of products and the 
characteristics they might embody.
The consumer with indifference curve IC normally prefers the characteristics 
to be combined in proportions similar to those provided by Brand C. Initially, 
the prices of the four brands are such that for a given level of expenditure, the 
consumer can afford to locate at b1 if he or she allocates all of the budget to 
brand B, c1 if he or she purchases brand C, or likewise, a1 or d1. Faced with this 
set of choices, the consumer chooses brand C and locates at c1. Utility at c1 is 
higher than at b1 or d1, both of which are located on the same indifference curve, 
IC. Utility at c1 is also higher than at a1, which is located on a lower indifference 
curve than IC.
Consider the implications of an increase in the price of Brand C. Let P1 denote 
the price of C that enables the consumer to locate at c1. Suppose the price of C 
increases to P2, so that, if the same budget is allocated to good C, the consumer 
can only attain c2. If it is possible to achieve a desired mix of characteristics by 
consuming combinations of brands in varying proportions, there is another way 
of attaining c2. If the quantities of brands B and D can be mixed in this way, any 
combination of characteristics along the arc b1d1 is attainable. The consumer 
could also achieve c2 by splitting the budget between purchases of brands B and 
D. If the price of C increases beyond P2, the consumer prefers combined con-
sumption of brands B and D to sole consumption of brand C. At prices beyond 
P2, this consumer is eliminated from the market for brand C.
In practice, can a desired mix of characteristics actually be achieved by 
consuming different brands in varying combinations? For products such as 
breakfast cereals or curry sauces, it is easy to imagine purchasing two differ-
ent brands and mixing them together. For musical acts or cars, it is harder to 
imagine consuming different brands in combination, unless perhaps alterna-
tive combinations of characteristics are required at different times of the day 
or week. If manoeuvrability is required for town driving during the week, but 
spaciousness is more important for long trips at weekends, a family might 
decide to run two cars.
If it is not possible to consume combinations of alternative brands in varying 
proportions in order to achieve a desired mix of characteristics, in Figure 16.3 
the consumer would stick with brand C unless the price increases beyond P3 (at 
which the point c3 is attainable). Beyond P3, the consumer would derive higher 
utility by switching altogether to either brand B or brand D.

	
	
	
16.4  Lancaster’s product characteristics model	 |	
477
In the case where brands can be consumed in combination, in Figure 16.3 the 
purchase of brand C is not ruled out altogether at prices above P2. Consider a 
second consumer with a different set of indifference curves, who normally prefers 
the characteristics to be combined in proportions similar to those provided by 
brand B. If the points attainable by allocating the entire budget to one brand are 
a1, b1, c2 and d1, it is better to purchase a combination of brands A and C than 
to allocate the entire budget to brand B. In this way, a point on OB beyond b1 is 
attainable. However, if the price of brand C increases beyond P3, combined con-
sumption of A and C is no longer preferable. In this case, the second consumer 
is also eliminated from the market for brand C.
This analysis suggests there are sharp discontinuities in the demand curve for 
brand C, illustrated in Figure 16.4. Above P3, neither consumer purchases brand 
C. At P3, however, C captures the second consumer (who normally prefers B) 
and there is a sudden jump in the demand for C. Similarly, at P2, C captures 
the first consumer (who normally prefers C) and there is a further jump in the 
demand for C. Variation in the price of C also produces sharp discontinuities in 
the demand for C’s near-neighbour brands, in this case brands B and D.
Discontinuous demand functions, and the interdependence between them, are 
likely to have major implications for competition and pricing strategy. Archibald 
and Rosenbluth (1975) consider the implications of variations in the number of 
characteristics and the number of competing brands:
■ When there are many competing brands and there are many rays in Figure 16.3, 
small price changes cause smoother and more continuous switching between 
brands. The effect of a change in the price of brand C on the total demand 
for brand D is negligible from the viewpoint of the producers of brand D, 
because brand C is only one of a very large number of competitors in brand 
D’s near-neighbourhood. In this case the Lancaster model approximates to the 
neoclassical model of monopolistic competition described in Section 3.5.
■ In Figure 16.3, strong product differentiation produces rays that are fur-
ther apart, while weak product differentiation produces rays that are closer 
together. If the rays are far apart, large price variations are needed to trigger

A route to profit in the middle market
FT
Michael Porter was the first economist to become a business guru. He used economic 
concepts to illustrate issues of corporate strategy. One of his most cited conclusions was 
the need to avoid being ‘stuck in the middle’. Companies, he said, must either gain a cost 
advantage or emphasise product differentiation. It was fatal to fall between the two stools 
of cost leadership and superior quality.
switching between brands. If the rays are close together, only small price varia-
tions are needed for the same effect.
■ In Figure 16.3, non-substitutable characteristics make the indifference curves 
more L-shaped, while easily substitutable characteristics make the indifference 
curves flatter. If the indifference curves are L-shaped, large price variations 
are needed to trigger switching between brands. If the indifference curves are 
flat, only small price variations are needed for the same effect.
The Lancaster product characteristics model also provides insights into the 
decision to introduce a new brand. The market depicted in Figure 16.5 is cur-
rently occupied by Brands A and C. As before, A and C can be combined in 
varying proportions to produce a preferred combination of characteristics. A 
consumer with the indifference curve IC maximises utility by consuming a com-
bination of A and C at point b2. However, the gap that exists in the product 
characteristic space between brands A and C represents an opportunity for the 
creation of a new brand B. If brand B can be priced so that the consumer can 
attain a position such as b1, the consumer will switch from the combined pur-
chase of brands A and C at b2 to the sole purchase of brand B at b1.

This claim struck me as nonsense. Middle market positions were not only viable but 
the preferred stance of many successful companies. In debate with Prof Porter, the epony-
mous chairman of Sainsbury’s supermarket defiantly displayed a model truck carrying 
the slogan ‘Good food costs less at Sainsbury’s’ — a celebration of being stuck in the 
middle. And, when Tesco overtook Sainsbury’s in the UK market, it was not by following 
Prof Porter’s advice but by beating Sainsbury’s at its own game.
Yet if we look at the UK supermarket sector today, the consensus view is that Prof ­Porter 
was right after all. The most successful competitors are Waitrose, firmly at the top of the 
market, and German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have placed themselves at the bot-
tom. Tesco, the market leader, along with traditional rivals Asda and Morrisons are under 
pressure, apparently stuck in the middle. The transformation of fortunes is not confined 
to the food sector; a remarkable phenomenon in UK high street retailing is the rise of 
Primark, which sells clothes for less than a hotel charges to launder them. And the most 
valuable company in the world, Apple, charges premium prices for premium products.
Like many business gurus, Prof Porter wriggled out of the challenge of ‘good food costs 
less’ by adopting a slippery definition of his proposition. ‘Don’t be stuck in the middle’ 
can be interpreted as meaning that unless you have some cost advantage or product dif-
ferentiation, you are unlikely to be very successful. That is a proposition so banal as to 
be almost tautological. A different proposition altogether says that you must emphasise 
either cost advantage or product differentiation, and if you aim at both you will not be 
successful. This may be either true or false. It is disingenuous to use the self-evident truth 
of the first proposition as support for the empirical validity of the second. And that, I 
argued back in the 1990s, was exactly what Prof Porter was doing.
Business conferences typically proceed by competitive anecdote. But these debates can 
never be resolved by repeating slogans and telling stories; you can usually find a narrative 
to support all but the most outlandish assertions. The only way to find answers is to use 
more comprehensive data sets, and the combination of market research and company 
financial statements made such analysis possible here.
My empirical research drew on a database that enabled us to relate perceived market 
position to return on capital employed. We discovered, to no one’s surprise, that high 
cost with low quality was not often a successful strategy. And low cost with high quality 
yielded the highest profits. Of course it did. But were you better off with low cost, low 
quality, or high cost and high quality, or being stuck in the middle with medium quality 
and medium cost? All produced similar returns.
A product offering is very rarely a sustainable source of competitive advantage because 
it can readily be imitated. What really matters is enjoying a competitive advantage in the 
market position you choose — and that typically involves matching your market posi-
tion to the distinctive underlying resources and capabilities of your business. Waitrose, 
Aldi and Lidl are not the beneficiaries, and Tesco and Sainsbury’s not the victims, of any 
verity of business strategy other than the eternal one; the best strategy is to be good at 
whatever it is you do.

Hotelling’s location model
In an early and highly influential contribution to the literature on spatial compe-
tition and product differentiation, Hotelling (1929) develops a model of competi-
tion in which geographical location is the characteristic that differentiates one 
supplier’s product from another. The products themselves are identical, but if 
all firms were charging the same price, all consumers would prefer to purchase 
from their nearest supplier. This means each firm has a certain amount of market 
power. A firm that raises its price does not automatically lose all its customers to 
its competitors. Some customers (those located nearest to the firm concerned) are 
willing to pay a slightly higher price in order to continue buying locally, rather 
than incur the costs of travelling further afield to buy more cheaply.
Although the original version of the Hotelling model describes competition in 
‘geographic space’, the same model can easily be adapted to describe competi-
tion in ‘product characteristic space’, where the relevant attributes of different 
suppliers are the characteristics of their products, rather than their geographic 
locations. In the case of breakfast cereals, it is possible to imagine different 
brands as being situated at different locations on a two-dimensional plane such 
as Figure 16.6, in which the horizontal dimension measures one characteristic 
such as degree of crunchiness, and the vertical dimension measures another char-
acteristic, degree of fruitiness. Each consumer has a preferred location on the 
two-dimensional plane, reflecting the consumer’s ideal brand which, if it existed, 
would embody the consumer’s preferred combination of these two characteris-
tics. The consumer can either buy a brand that is situated close to his or her own 
location (which provides the highest utility), or a brand that is situated further 
away (which provides less utility). As before, if all firms were charging the same 
price, all consumers would prefer to purchase from their nearest supplier (in

characteristics space). If there are significant price disparities, however, it might 
be worthwhile to purchase from a more distant supplier, provided the saving in 
price is at least sufficient to compensate for the loss of utility.
In order to develop the Hotelling location model, the examples cited below 
refer to competition in geographic space and competition in product charac-
teristic space interchangeably. Initially, however, the model is developed using 
the geographic interpretation. Consider a town comprising one street running 
from west to east. The street is perfectly straight and consumers live at addresses 
distributed evenly (or uniformly) along the street. For simplicity, distances are 
standardised so that the total length of the street is 1. Each consumer’s address 
is represented by a number between 0 and 1, with 0 denoting the address at the 
far west end of the street, and 1 denoting the address at the far east end. For 
simplicity, the model of competition in geographic space is one-dimensional: all 
consumers are located on a single east–west dimension. For the model of com-
petition in product characteristic space, the equivalent condition is that there is 
only one relevant product characteristic: degree of crunchiness, for example, in 
the breakfast cereals’ case. Each consumer’s location, or ideal brand (in terms 
of degree of crunchiness), can be represented by an address number between 0 
(soft) and 1 (crunchy), in the same way as before.
In the case where suppliers are differentiated by geographic location, it is 
assumed that every day, each consumer wishes to make a single purchase from 
one of two firms, both of which supply an identical product. The utility obtained by 
consuming a unit of the product can be standardised to a value of one. When mak-
ing their daily purchase, each consumer incurs a transport cost dependent on the 
distance travelled. Transport cost is quadratic in distance so, as distance increases, 
transport cost increases at an increasing rate. Suppose initially the two firms are 
located at opposite ends of town: firm A at address 0 and firm B at address 1. For 
a consumer located at address d between 0 and 1, the utility gained and total cost 
incurred (purchase price plus transport cost) are as shown in Table 16.2.
Table 16.2  Example of utility gained and total cost incurred
Utility
Purchase price plus transport cost
Purchase from firm A

PA + kd2

PB + k(1 - d)2
In the case where suppliers are differentiated by the characteristics of their 
brands, again it is assumed that, every day, each consumer wishes to make a 
single purchase from one of two firms. The utility that would be obtained by 
consuming a brand corresponding precisely to the consumer’s ideal brand (if 
such a brand existed) is standardised to a value of one. When making their daily 
purchase of one of the two available brands, each consumer incurs a utility loss 
dependent on the distance between the location of the brand purchased, and the 
location of the consumer’s ideal brand. The utility loss is quadratic in distance, 
so as distance increases, the utility loss increases at an increasing rate. Again, 

482	
|	 16    ■    Product differentiation
suppose initially firms A and B are located at addresses 0 and 1, respectively. For 
a consumer located at address d between 0 and 1, the (net) utility gained and cost 
incurred (just the purchase price in this case) are as shown in Table 16.3.
Table 16.3  Example of utility gained and purchase price incurred
Utility (net)
Purchase price
Purchase from firm A
1 - kd2
PA
Purchase from firm B
1 - k(1 - d)2
PB
The parameter k plays a vital role in the model. In the model of competition 
in geographic space, a higher value of k implies a higher transport cost. In the 
model of competition in product characteristic space, a higher value of k implies 
a higher degree of consumer brand loyalty: as k increases, it costs consumers 
more (in terms of utility foregone) to switch from a brand situated close to the 
ideal brand to a brand situated further away. In both models, as k increases, 
consumers become less likely to switch between firms A and B in response to 
small changes in PA and PB. Therefore k is a measure of the consumers’ rate of 
substitution between firms A and B. The higher the value of k, the lower the rate 
of substitution and the lower the intensity of competition between firms A and B.
In both models, the consumer buys from the firm from which he or she receives 
the highest surplus, defined as the difference between the utility gained and the 
cost incurred, provided this surplus is positive:
■ If PA + kd2 6 PB + k(1 - d)2 and PA + kd2 … 1, the consumer buys from 
firm A.
■ If PA + kd2 7 PB + k(1 - d)2 and PB + k(1 - d)2 … 1, the consumer buys 
from firm B.
Hotelling considers the case where the price is determined exogenously and is the 
same for both firms (PA = PB = P), but the firms are free to choose where (in 
geographic space or product characteristic space) to locate. However, the model 
can be extended to cover a second case where the two firms’ locations are fixed, 
but prices are endogenous and each firm is free to set its own price. A third case, 
in which both locations and prices are endogenous and chosen by the firms, is 
more complex. In fact, this third case turns out not to have a stable equilibrium 
solution at all. Accordingly, Section 16.5 examines only the first two cases. In 
both cases, for simplicity it is assumed that production costs are zero. A modified 
version of the Hotelling model, in which there is an equilibrium in the third case 
(endogenous locations and prices) is examined in Section 16.6.
Case 1: locations endogenous, price exogenous (fixed)
In this case, each firm chooses its location so as to maximise its own profit. Under 
the fixed price and zero cost assumptions, each firm’s profit is a linear function 
of the number of consumers it serves. At which addresses (on the scale 0 to 1)

should the two firms locate? Intuitively, it might be expected that firm A should 
locate at the address 0.25, and firm B should locate at the address 0.75. In this 
case, firm A would serve all consumers living at addresses between 0 and 0.5, 
and firm B would serve all consumers living at addresses between 0.5 and 1. This 
situation is shown in the upper section of Figure 16.7.
But is this choice of locations a Nash equilibrium? The answer is no. If firm 
A assumes B’s location is fixed at its current address of 0.75, A can increase its 
market share by relocating to a point just fractionally to the west of B, say 0.749. 
By doing so, A now serves all consumers at addresses between 0 and 0.7495, and 
B’s market share is reduced to consumers at addresses between 0.7495 and 1. 
However, this position is also unstable, and is also not a Nash equilibrium. If B 
now assumes A’s location is fixed at its current address of 0.749, B can increase its 
market share by relocating to a point just fractionally to the west of A, say 0.748. 
By doing so, B now serves all consumers at addresses between 0 and 0.7485, and 
A’s market share is reduced to consumers at addresses between 0.7485 and 1.
According to this reasoning, the two firms are engaged in a leap-frogging 
process, as each seeks to acquire more market share at the expense of its com-
petitor. Is there ever an end to this process? The answer is yes. Notice that as 
leap-frogging takes place, both firms are moving in the direction of the centre 
of town. And when both firms are located at the very centre, at addresses just 
fractionally on either side of 0.5, neither is able to increase its market share (or 
profit) by changing its location any further. Therefore a stable Nash equilibrium 
is achieved when both firms locate in the same position, in the very centre of 
town, as shown in the lower section of Figure 16.7. All firms locating in the cen-
tral position is not a property of the Nash equilibrium, in the general case with 
more than two firms. However, even in this case there is a tendency for bunching, 
whereby several firms locate together in the same position.
Is this solution simply a feature of a highly stylized and unrealistic theoretical 
model, or does it have any relevance in the real world? Perhaps it does. In the 
case of competition in geographic space, a tendency for several petrol stations to 
cluster together at important traffic intersections or other busy locations is often 
noticeable when driving around towns and cities. In the case of competition in 
product characteristic space, the perception that all brands of soap powder are

the same has long been something of a cliché in public discussion of the role of 
branding and advertising in modern society. Hotelling’s location model provides 
a plausible explanation as to why it might make sense for more than one brand 
of soap powder to have similar or identical characteristics. As a contribution 
to an analysis of spatially differentiated markets, Firgo et al. (2015) note that 
firms characterised by a more centralised position in the market have a stronger 
impact on their rivals’ prices and on price equilibria. The theoretical model is 
investigated empirically by considering the locations of petrol stations in Vienna, 
Austria. Tests show that prices at petrol stations are more strongly correlated 
with prices set by the central firms. In an investigation of the location of Austra-
lian general practitioners (GPs), Gravelle et al. (2016) find that GPs with more 
distant competitors would charge higher prices.
Case 2: locations fixed (exogenous), prices endogenous
In this case, the locations of the two firms are assumed to be fixed and each firm 
sets its price so as to maximise its own profit. It is assumed that the two firms are 
located at the opposite ends of the spectrum of addresses, with firm A at address 
0 and firm B at address 1. Two models of price determination are examined:
■ A collusive model, in which the two firms behave as if they were a single 
monopolist, and charge the price that maximises their joint profit.
■ A non-collusive model, in which the two firms set their prices independently. 
At the Bertrand (or Nash) equilibrium, each firm sets its price so as to maxi-
mise its own profit, treating the other firm’s price as fixed at its current level.
The mathematical details of both models can be found in Appendix 1.
Collusive model: joint profit maximization
In the collusive model, the monopoly (joint profit-maximizing) price is always the 
same for both firms. Whenever PA = PB, the consumer located at address 0.5 is 
indifferent between buying from either firm. The price at which this consumer is 
indifferent between buying (from either firm) and withdrawing from the market 
is denoted P∼, and defined as follows:
P∼+ kd2 = P∼+ k(1 - d)2 = 1
Substituting d = 1/2 into this expression, it is easily shown:
P∼= 1 - k/4
When k is small, transport costs or brand loyalties are low, and the rate of substi-
tution or the propensity for consumers to switch between suppliers is high. When 
k is small, P∼ turns out to be the joint profit-maximizing or monopoly price. The 
two firms’ common price should be set so that the most marginal consumer is 
just willing to stay in the market.

485
However, when k is large, transport costs or brand loyalties are high, and the 
rate of substitution or propensity for consumers to switch between suppliers is 
low. When k is large, it is profitable for the two firms to set their common price 
higher than P∼. Although some consumers withdraw from the market, the firms 
increase their joint profit by raising the common price, and exploiting the mar-
ket power that arises from the reluctance of those consumers who remain in the 
market to switch.
Figure 16.8 shows the determination of the monopoly (joint profit-­maximizing) 
price for k = 1.00, 1.33 and 1.67. In each case, the left-hand diagram shows the 
total cost of buying from either firm as a function of location, represented on the

horizontal axis. The right-hand diagram shows marginal revenue as a function 
of price: the effect on revenue (or profit in a model with zero costs) of a small 
increase in price. At prices below P∼, marginal revenue (in terms of price) is always 
positive and constant. The monopoly (joint profit-maximizing) price is never less 
than P∼, because in this range price can always be increased without causing any 
consumer to withdraw. Above P∼, however, marginal revenue (in terms of price) 
tends to be negative when k is low, but positive when k is high.
Let PM denote the monopoly (joint profit-maximizing) price.
■ When k = 1.00, PM = P∼= 0.75. The marginal effect on revenue or profit of 
a further increase in price is negative, so a further increase in price would not 
be profitable.
■ When k = 1.33, PM = P∼= 0.67. The marginal effect on revenue or profit 
of a further increase in price is just equal to zero. Again, a further increase in 
price would not be profitable.
■ When k = 1.67, P∼= 0.6. In this case, the marginal effect on revenue or profit 
of a further increase in price is positive, so price should be increased beyond 
P∼. Joint profit maximization occurs at PM = 0.67, where this marginal effect 
is equal to zero.
In fact, it can be shown that for any value of k 7 1.33, PM = 0.67 is the joint 
profit-maximizing price. When transport costs or brand loyalties are suffi-
ciently high, each firm operates like a monopolist within its own market seg-
ment (addresses 0 to 0.5 for firm A and 0.5 to 1 for firm B). For k 7 1.33 it is 
worthwhile to raise price beyond the level at which all consumers remain in the 
market, exploiting fully the reluctance to switch (brand loyalties) of those con-
sumers who do remain.
Non-collusive model: Bertrand (or Nash) equilibrium
The apparatus of isoprofit curves and reaction functions for firms A and B 
(see Chapter 7) can be used to locate the Bertrand (or Nash) equilibrium in 
the non-collusive model. In Section 7.3, isoprofit curves and reaction functions 
were derived for a quantity-adjustment duopoly model (in which two firms take 
profit-maximizing decisions about their output levels), with quantities shown on 
the horizontal and vertical axes. In the present case, isoprofit curves and reac-
tion functions are required for a price-adjustment model, with prices rather than 
quantities shown on the horizontal and vertical axes.
It is assumed initially that both firms are operating at prices sufficiently low 
that no consumer is priced out of the market. All consumers are willing to buy 
from at least one of the two firms. Figure 16.9 examines the following shifts:
(i)	 Both firms initially charge the same price and are located at point F in 
­Figure 16.9. A decides to increase its price, represented by a shift from F to G.
(ii)	 A initially charges a higher price than B, and the firms are located at point 
X in Figure 16.9. A decides to increase its price, represented by a shift from 
X to Y.

	
	
	
16.5  Hotelling’s location model	 |	
487
In both (i) and (ii), there are two effects on firm A’s profit, which operate in 
opposite directions:
■ By charging a higher price to each consumer it retains, A tends to earn more 
profit than before.
■ However, A also loses some business, because A’s price increase causes A’s 
most marginal consumers to switch to B. A loses the profit it was earning 
previously from those consumers who switch.
In (i), A’s most marginal consumers who switch to B are those located at addresses 
close to 0.5, at the centre of town. These consumers incur relatively high trans-
port costs in order to buy from A. For any given price increase by A, the rate 
at which these marginal consumers switch from A to B is low (if transport costs 
are a large proportion of the total cost of buying from A, a small increase in PA 
makes only a small difference). The first of the two effects identified above tends 
to dominate, and A’s profit increases due to the move from F to G.
In (ii), A’s most marginal consumers who switch to B are located at addresses 
closer to firm A than before. These consumers incur lower transport costs than 
before in order to buy from A. For any further price increase by A, the rate at 
which these marginal consumers switch from A to B is high (if transport costs are 
only a small proportion of the total cost of buying from A, a small increase in PA 
makes a big difference). The second of the two effects identified above tends to 
dominate, and A’s profit decreases due to the move from X to Y.
To complete the derivation of A’s isoprofit curves, suppose B now implements 
a small price increase, while A holds its price constant. This is represented by 
the shift from G to H, or from Y to Z in Figure 16.9. In both cases, some con-
sumers switch from B to A, causing A’s profit to increase. Similarly, if B cuts its 
price while A holds its price constant, consumers switch from A to B, causing 
A’s profit to decrease. This establishes that A’s isoprofit curves are convex to 
Figure 16.9  Derivation of firm A’s isoprofit curves

|	 16    ■    Product differentiation
the horizontal axis, or U-shaped. Reading Figure 16.9 from the bottom to the 
top, each successive isoprofit curve represents a higher level of profit to firm A. 
Similarly, B’s isoprofit curves are convex to the vertical axis.
For each value of PB, firm A’s reaction function, denoted RFA, shows the 
profit-maximizing value of PA. Accordingly, RFA runs through the minimum 
points of each of A’s isoprofit curves. But what is the shape of RFA? In fact, 
the precise shape and location depend on the value of the parameter k. As dis-
cussed previously, this parameter determines the rate of substitution, or the rate 
at which consumers switch between A and B in response to a small price change 
by either firm.
Figure 16.10 shows a sketch of the typical shape of RFA. RFA is upward-
sloping between points M and N; backward-bending between points N and R; 
and vertical between points R and S. The logic is based on an analysis of the 
effect of a small increase in PB on the profit-maximizing values of PA in different 
regions of Figure 16.10.
■ Between M and N, PB is relatively low and B captures most of the market. As PB 
increases from point M, the most marginal consumers lost by B are located close 
to A. These consumers prefer to switch to A rather than drop out of the market 
altogether, so A’s demand increases. To maximise profit, A should respond by 
increasing PA, until the marginal profit gained from those consumers A retains 
(despite the increase in PA) equals the marginal profit lost from those consum-
ers who switch back to B (due to the increase in PA). RFA is upward sloping 
between M and N because A reacts to an increase in PB by increasing PA.
■ Between N and R, PB is higher than before. As PB increases from point N, the 
marginal consumers lost by B are located further away from A than before. 
Also, PA is higher than before. Accordingly, the consumers lost by B prefer 
to drop out of the market altogether, rather than switch to A. However, this 
decision is sufficiently borderline that they could be enticed back if A were to 
reduce PA. A does so until the marginal profit A gains from the extra consum-
ers enticed back matches the marginal profit lost from A’s existing consumers 
Figure 16.10  Firm A’s reaction function

489
(due to the cut in PA). RFA is backward bending between N and R because A 
reacts to an increase in PB by reducing PA.
■ Finally, between R and S, PB is higher still. As PB increases from point R, the 
marginal consumers lost by B are located close to B and far away from A. 
They prefer to drop out of the market altogether rather than switch to A. This 
decision is not borderline and these consumers would not be enticed back by 
a small reduction in PA. They might be enticed back by a large reduction in 
PA, but it is not profitable for A to implement a sufficiently large price cut: the 
loss of revenue from A’s existing customers would be too great. A’s demand is 
unaffected by the increase in PB, and the profit-maximizing value of PA is also 
unaffected. RFA is vertical between R and S because A reacts to an increase 
in PB by leaving PA unchanged.
Figure 16.11 shows the determination of the Bertrand (or Nash) equilibrium 
price for k = 0.33, 0.67, 1.00, 1.33 and 1.67. In each case, the left-hand diagram 
shows the intersection of the two firms’ reaction functions, and compares the 
Bertrand (or Nash) equilibrium price, denoted PN, with the monopoly (joint 
profit-maximizing) price, PM. The right-hand diagram shows the total cost of 
buying from either firm as a function of location on the horizontal axis, when the 
selling price is either PN or PM. As before, the precise solutions depend heavily 
on k, or the consumers’ rate of substitution between firms A and B.
Small k; high rate of substitution; intense competition
Small values of k (k = 0.33, 0.67) represent high rates of substitution between 
firms A and B. Price competition between A and B tends to be intense. The Ber-
trand (or Nash) equilibrium prices are located on the upward-sloping sections of 
RFA and RFB. These turn out to be PN = 0.33 and PN = 0.67, respectively. In 
fact, when the model is parameterised as assumed here, it can be shown PN = k 
for all k … 0.67 (see Appendix 1). In the most extreme case of price competition, 
when k = 0 and the rate of substitution between firms A and B in response to small 
changes in PA and PB is infinite, the present model becomes equivalent to one of 
Bertrand price competition between two duopolists selling an identical product. 
As shown earlier (see Section 7.4), equilibrium in the Bertrand model is reached 
when the prices set by the two duopolists have been driven down to the perfectly 
competitive level (price equals marginal cost). In the present case, marginal cost is 
zero, so when k = 0 the Bertrand (or Nash) equilibrium price is PN = 0.
Medium k; medium rate of substitution; medium competition
Higher values of k (k = 1.00, 1.33) represent medium rates of substitution and 
less intense price competition between firms A and B. The Bertrand (or Nash) 
equilibrium prices are located on the backward-bending sections of RFA and 
RFB. Each firm acts as a monopolist within its own market segment, and PN 
and PM coincide, at PM = PN = 0.75 for k = 1.00, and at PM = PN = 0.67 
for k = 1.33. In both cases, however, the rate of substitution is still sufficiently 
high that it is profitable to set prices in such a way that all consumers are served.

Large k; low rate of substitution; weak competition
Finally, the highest value of k considered in Figure 16.11 (k = 1.67) represents 
the lowest rate of substitution and the least intense price competition between 
firms A and B. The Bertrand (or Nash) equilibrium prices are located on the 
vertical sections of RFA and RFB. Each firm acts as a monopolist within its 
own market segment. For all values of k Ú 1.33, PN and PM always coincide 
at PM = PN = 0.67. But for k Ú 1.33, the rate of substitution is so low that it 
is profitable to set prices in such a way that some consumers are excluded from 
the market.
The results of the analysis of the collusive and non-collusive versions of the 
Hotelling model with fixed locations and endogenous prices are summarised in 
Figure 16.12, which shows the relationship between the parameter k and PM, 
the joint profit-maximizing (monopoly) price and PN, the Bertrand (or Nash) 
equilibrium (competitive) price. The findings can be summarised as follows:
■ Over small and medium values of k, PM is decreasing in k. As k increases, it is 
worthwhile for the firms to reduce PM to retain those consumers who would 
otherwise withdraw from the market. However, if k becomes sufficiently large, 
Figure 16.12  Hotelling’s location model with fixed locations and endogenous prices: 
summary of results

492	
|	 16    ■    Product differentiation
it ceases to be profitable to continue cutting PM to retain the consumers from 
the more distant locations. Instead, it becomes more profitable to hold PM 
constant and allow the most marginal consumers to withdraw.
■ In perfect competition (k = 0), PN = 0. Any increase in k beyond k = 0 
confers some market power on the two firms so, initially, PN is increasing 
in k. Over medium values of k, the firms acquire sufficient market power to 
begin to act like monopolists within their own submarkets. Consequently, 
PN approaches PM, and eventually PN and PM become equivalent. Over high 
values of k, PN (like PM) is unaffected by further increases in k. It is interesting 
to note that over some values of k (1.00 … k … 1.33), PN is decreasing in k: 
as the market becomes less competitive, the Nash equilibrium price decreases. 
This is because within this range, the two duopolists are already operating 
effectively as if they were local monopolists.
	
16.6	
Salop’s location model
Salop (1979) develops a modified version of the Hotelling model, in which the 
firms and consumers are located around the circumference of a circle. In con-
trast to the Hotelling model (where the firms and consumers are located on a 
straight line with two end points), an equilibrium exists in the Salop model in the 
case where both locations and prices are endogenous. The presence of the two 
end points accounts for the non-existence of an equilibrium solution in Hotell-
ing’s model; and, conversely, the fact that a circle does not have any end points 
explains the existence of an equilibrium in Salop’s model. In order to develop 
the Salop model, one further modification to the specification of the Hotelling 
model is required: non-zero production costs, including both a fixed cost and a 
variable cost component, are assumed.
The theoretical properties of Salop’s model are quite interesting but, with refer-
ence to competition in product characteristics space, it is difficult to think of many 
real-world examples where the characteristics of a group of differentiated products 
might realistically be represented in the form of a circular array. One case that 
might correspond to this formulation, however, is a group of rival airlines offer-
ing flights on a particular route at different hours of the day and night, around a 
24-hour clock. Each airline offers a flight at a particular time, and each passenger 
has a preferred departure time, which varies between passengers (and which might 
be anytime, day or night). A passenger whose preferred departure time is 1100 
might be indifferent between a 0900 and a 1300 departure (but with lower utility 
than at 1100), and indifferent between a 0700 and a 1500 departure (but with still 
lower utility). This passenger’s least favoured departure time might be 23:00.
Assuming consumers are located uniformly around the circumference of the 
circle, in the Salop model each firm wishes to locate as far as possible from its 
nearest competitors. This means it is always optimal for the firms to spread out 
as much as possible, locating at equidistant points around the circumference. If 
the length of the circumference is standardised to one, and the number of firms 
is N, the optimal distance between each firm is 1/N. Figure 16.13 illustrates a

Figure 16.13  Salop’s location model with three firms
three-firm version of the Salop model, in which the optimal distances between 
the firms are 1/3.
The formulation of each consumer’s transport cost in the model of competi-
tion in geographic space, or the consumer’s utility cost of consuming a product 
with characteristics different from the consumer’s ideal characteristics, is the 
same as in the Hotelling model. The transport or utility cost is kd2, where d 
represents distance, and the parameter k determines the consumer’s rate of sub-
stitution between suppliers. The utility gained from consuming one unit of the 
product (the product with the ideal characteristics in the product differentiation 
model) is one, as before. If the firms are equidistant, the maximum distance of 
any consumer from their nearest supplier is 1/(2N). Let P = 1 - k/(2N)2 denote 
the price at which the most distant consumer is indifferent between buying and 
withdrawing from the market. If all three firms charge a price of P, all three firms 
achieve a quantity demanded of 1/3.
Figures 16.14 and 16.15 examine the relationship between firm A’s pricing 
decision and demand, on the assumption that firms B and C both charge a price 
of P. In Figure 16.14, the circle has been redrawn as a straight line (but without 
end points). Suppose initially firm A also charges P1 = P, but A is considering 
either reducing its price to P2, or increasing its price to P3.
■ With a price reduction below P1 = P, A acquires some consumers from B and 
C, so A’s quantity demanded increases, from 1/3 to 2d2. Because consumers 
switch between suppliers at prices such as P2 (below P), P2 lies within what 
Salop terms the competitive region.
■ With a price increase above P1 = P, A loses some consumers, who prefer to 
withdraw from the market altogether rather than switch to either B or C. A’s 
quantity demanded decreases, from 1/3 to 2d3. Because A’s former consum-
ers either continue to buy from A or withdraw from the market altogether at 
prices such as P3 (above P), P3 lies within the monopoly region.
Figures 16.14 and 16.15 show that the rate at which firm A loses consumers by 
increasing its price in the monopoly region exceeds the rate at which A gains

Figure 16.15  Salop’s location model: firm A’s demand function
Figure 16.14  Salop’s location model: effect of changes in firm A’s price with three firms
consumers by reducing its price in the competitive region. Consequently, A’s 
demand function has a kink located at price P1 = P.
What happens if a new firm is allowed to enter the market, increasing the num-
ber of firms from three to four? Assuming the three incumbent firms can relocate 
costlessly, the four firms will choose to arrange themselves at equal distances of 
1/4 from one another. The maximum distance of any consumer from their near-
est supplier is now less than before. Therefore P′, the new price at which the 
consumer who is most distant from any firm is indifferent between buying and 
withdrawing, is higher than P. If all four firms charge a price of P′, all four firms 
achieve a quantity demanded of 1/4. Therefore the position of the kink in firm 
A’s demand function shifts up and to the left, as shown in Figure 16.15.
Suppose all firms face a constant marginal cost, denoted c, per unit of output 
plus a non-zero fixed cost, denoted f. Salop shows that entry will take place until 
a Nash equilibrium is reached, at which no incumbent firm wishes to change its 

	
	
	
16.6  Salop’s location model	 |	
495
price and no outside firm wishes to enter. This equilibrium is analogous to the 
post-entry equilibrium in the (representative consumer) monopolistic competi-
tion model (see Section 3.5 and Figure 3.8). At the equilibrium in the Salop 
model, each incumbent firm earns a normal profit, and if another firm were to 
enter, this would cause all firms (including the entrant) to earn negative profits. 
The equilibrium number of firms is established using the following relationships:
 Each firm>s quantity demanded = 1/N
 Each firm>s price = P = 1 - k/(4N2)
 Each firm>s total revenue = (1/N)[1 - k/(4N2)]
 Each firm>s total cost = (1/N)c + f
Each firm earns zero abnormal profit when total revenue equals total cost. There-
fore the equilibrium value of N is determined by the following condition:
(1/N)[1 - k/(4N2)] = (1/N)c + f
This condition can be rearranged to obtain a cubic equation in N, which can be 
solved to determine the equilibrium value of N, which in turn determines the 
equilibrium value of P.
According to Figure 16.15, the Nash equilibrium price in the Salop model 
rises as the number of firms increases from three to four. This result may seem 
surprising: usually price is expected to fall as competition increases. But, in fact, 
the tendency for price to rise as the number of firms increases (due to entry) is 
a feature of this model throughout the entire process of adjustment towards the 
Nash equilibrium. As the number of firms increases, each individual firm services 
a smaller segment of the market, but obtains some compensation by raising its 
price. It is possible for the firms to do so, because as each firm’s market segment 
becomes narrower, the preferences of the consumers the firm retains become 
more closely aligned with the characteristics of its own product. Although con-
sumers pay a higher price, they obtain a product with characteristics that are 
closer on average to their own ideal product specification.

Dear Economist,
My favourite table at the local pub is getting too crowded. A few of us sit down for a few 
drinks, then, as the stragglers come and join us one by one, there’s hardly room to bend your 
elbow. Why does this happen, and what can we do about it?
Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Pollitt,
How fortunate for your landlord, but I can see why you are irritated. It is easy enough to 
diagnose the cause of your problem with the help of Steven Salop’s ‘circular city’ model 
of differentiated competition under free entry. His analysis is a classic of 1970s indus-
trial economics. In Salop’s model, firms compete in a circular space – think of ice-cream 
vendors located around the edge of a boating lake. Salop shows that each of these firms 
imposes costs on the others (by poaching customers), so you reach a point where there 
is too much entry.
What better explanation of your own plight? You sit around a pub table, and each new 
drinker decides whether or not to squeeze in and join you. Yet of course they do not con-
sider the impact on everybody else’s comfort. The final person to join you (before others 
decide they would rather stand) only just prefers sitting down to standing up. He might 
as well stand. Of course, everyone who must make space for him is far from indifferent.
The solution is simplicity itself – and it is also a tradition that I am surprised you are 
not upholding. Each new companion should pay an entry fee in compensation to the 
others – traditionally, one pint per person. This elegant solution ensures that incumbent 
drinkers are compensated for giving up space. It also ensures that the more crowded the 
table is, the less tempting it is to join it.

Summary
There are two forms of product differentiation. Vertical product differentia-
tion means one product or service differs in overall quality from another. If the 
prices of both products were the same, most or all consumers would purchase 
the higher-quality product. Horizontal product differentiation means products 
or services are of the same or similar overall quality but have different attributes. 
Different consumers would express different preferences favouring one or other 
of the products. It may also be useful to classify the distinguishing characteristics 
of differentiated products and services as either natural or strategic. Natural 
product differentiation exists when the distinguishing characteristics of products 
or services are natural attributes. Strategic product differentiation involves the 
deliberate creation of real or perceived distinguishing characteristics by suppliers.
Sources of natural product differentiation include location, which might auto-
matically differentiate a product or service in the minds of consumers; technol-
ogy, which can be used to add new features to an existing product; brands and 
trademarks, which help differentiate products that are physically similar; associa-
tions in consumers’ minds between particular products and particular countries; 
and consumers’ own preferences for attributes such as colour or style. Sources 
of strategic product differentiation include: the quality of factor inputs used by 
a supplier; variations in the conditions of sale; guarantees or after-sales service;

planned obsolescence and frequent changes in design or style; and misleading 
advertising which exploits consumer ignorance.
In the economics literature, the two basic approaches to modelling horizontal 
product differentiation are: representative consumer models, in which consumers 
have tastes or preferences for goods or services, and firms compete to attract con-
sumers by differentiating the goods or services they offer; and spatial or location 
models, in which consumers have tastes or preferences for the characteristics that 
are embodied in goods or services. The neoclassical model of monopolistic com-
petition and several of the standard models of duopoly or oligopoly with product 
differentiation are representative consumer models. Several of the models that 
are introduced in Chapter 16 fall into the category of spatial or location models.
An analysis of the implications of product differentiation for social welfare 
in the representative consumer model of monopolistic competition suggests that 
only by coincidence is social welfare maximised at the post-entry equilibrium in 
monopolistic competition. The number of firms at the post-entry equilibrium is 
determined by entrants examining whether or not they obtain a positive private 
benefit if they enter. By increasing industry output and reducing prices, entry 
tends to reduce the producer surplus (abnormal profits) of incumbent firms, but 
it also tends to increase consumer surplus. Whether the number of firms, and 
therefore the amount of product differentiation, at the post-entry equilibrium is 
too high or too low depends upon which of these two effects dominates.
In Lancaster’s product characteristics model, goods are viewed as bundles of 
characteristics, and differentiated goods or brands are goods that contain the 
same characteristics in varying proportions. The quantities of each characteristic 
are shown along the axes of an indifference curve diagram, and rays reflect the 
proportions in which the characteristics are available from competing brands. 
The demand functions for each brand are discontinuous functions of the brand’s 
own price and the prices of adjacent brands. Consumers sometimes respond to 
small price changes by making small adjustments to the quantities of the brands 
they are currently consuming. However, sometimes small changes in price trigger 
switches between brands, in which case there are large, discrete changes in the 
quantities purchased.
Hotelling’s model of spatial competition, in which geographic location is the 
characteristic that differentiates one supplier’s product from another, has been 
widely used to model competition in product characteristic space. In the duopoly 
model in which price is exogenous and the firms choose where to locate along a 
straight line drawn in geographic or product characteristic space, an equilibrium 
is achieved when the firms locate in the same position, at the very centre of the 
straight line. In the case where locations are exogenous and the firms are free to 
select their own prices, it is possible to develop collusive and non-collusive ver-
sions of the model of price determination. The main conclusions are as follows:
■ When transport costs or brand loyalties are low, the collusive or joint profit-
maximizing price is higher than in the case where transport costs or brand 
loyalties are high. In the latter case, it pays the duopolists to lower the price 
to some extent to prevent some consumers from withdrawing from the market 
altogether. If transport costs increase beyond a certain point, however, it is

better to allow some withdrawals, rather than cut the price any further. In this 
case, both duopolists effectively operate as local monopolists within their own 
submarkets.
■ The equilibrium price in the non-collusive model tends to be low when trans-
port costs or brand loyalties are low. In this case the non-collusive model tends 
towards one of perfect competition. When transport costs or brand loyalties 
are high, it becomes profitable for the duopolists to operate as local monopo-
lists within their own submarkets. In this case the non-collusive and collusive 
models yield identical outcomes.
Finally, in Salop’s adaptation of the Hotelling model, the firms and consumers 
are located around the circumference of a circle. In this case, it is possible to derive 
an equilibrium for the case where both locations and prices are endogenous, and 
there is free entry. The solution to the Salop model is analogous to the post-entry 
equilibrium in the neoclassical model of monopolistic competition. A feature of 
this model is that the equilibrium price rises as the number of firms increases. Each 
firm’s market segment becomes narrower, and the preferences of the consumers 
each firm retains become more closely aligned with the characteristics of that 
firm’s product. Although consumers pay a higher price, they obtain a product 
with characteristics closer on average to their ideal product specification.

	 9.	 In the Hotelling model with fixed locations and endogenous prices, a decrease in the consumers’ 
rate of substitution between competing brands might result in a decrease in the equilibrium

Introduction
Advertising is a method used by producers to communicate information to con-
sumers about the goods or services they have to sell. Advertising is perhaps the 
most widely used method for informing or persuading consumers of the benefits 
of choosing a particular product or service, or a particular brand. Advertising

can involve a number of practices including direct mail, in-store promotion, 
telemarketing, product placements, sponsorship and exhibitions.
[E]xpenditure on advertisement is expenditure (over and above the costs 
of producing and transferring the commodity to the consumer) which is 
increased by the seller with a view to increasing sales of his commodity. 
Thus in addition to the costs of the printed advertisement, it includes 
expenditure on travelling salesmen, ‘free offers’, competitions, coupons, 
and on displays and other services for attracting buyers.
(Braithwaite, 1928, p. 18)
Producers often use advertising to persuade consumers that there are genuine dif-
ferences between competing brands of a product or service. Over longer periods 
of time, advertising can be used to construct an attractive image for a brand, 
and strengthen the loyalties of the brand’s consumers. In the days before there 
was meaningful regulation of advertising, firms often made outrageous claims in 
promoting their products. In the US in the 1930s, for example, many products 
were portrayed as having miraculous properties (Bryson, 1994). One company 
boasted that its brand of cigarettes could cure a smoker’s cough.
Coca-Cola advertising a century ago told you that the beverage was 
healthful, refreshing, the preferred drink of ladies, available at any drug 
store. Today, the same company tells you only that ‘Coke is it’.
(Kay, 2004, pp. 215–16)
According to Tedlow (1993), large-scale marketing in the US began as long ago 
as the 1880s, when large industrial firms started to appear for the first time sell-
ing mass-produced and highly standardised products to the newly emerging mass 
market. Typical examples include Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & 
Gamble and Heinz, all of which are still prominent in their respective industries 
today. The reliance upon mass-production technologies to achieve economies of 
scale meant marketing, like production, had to be carried out on a large scale, 
and tended to treat consumers as homogeneous agents.
From the 1950s onwards, the introduction and wide-scale penetration of 
commercial television and radio created new advertising and marketing oppor-
tunities. Advertising messages could be transmitted directly into the homes of 
consumers. By choosing the time of day and the type of programme within 
which advertisements were embedded, advertisers could segment audiences 
according to key demographic or socio-economic categories, such as age, sex, 
income, education and so on. Tedlow (1993) notes that, since the 1990s, there 
has been a trend toward micromarketing, where each consumer represents a 
potential segment. These changes are driven by changes in production and 
information technologies that have given firms more flexible systems to deliver 
goods, services and advertising messages to consumers. For example, Dell 
allows consumers to order tailor-made versions of personal computer products 
online. However, Tedlow (1993, p. 31) acknowledges that such trends may not

necessarily continue if ‘confused consumers are confronted in the marketplace 
with scores of distinctions without differences’, or if constraints in distribution 
networks are met. Producers can now more easily measure the effectiveness of 
any given advertising strategy. The increasing sophistication of advertising links 
on the internet means firms only have to pay each time a consumer accesses the 
advertisement. ‘This is the equivalent of paying for junk mail only to households 
that read it’ (The Economist, 2004b, p. 84). American Airlines are reported as 
using ‘behavioural targeting’, by monitoring the interest shown by readers of 
the online version of the Wall Street Journal in travel stories. It then targets the 
selected readers with flight offers (The Economist, 2004b). Evans (2009) surveys 
the online advertising industry.
Advertising is one of the main weapons of competition between firms. From a 
theoretical perspective, the importance of advertising might be expected to vary 
according to market structure:
■ In the theoretical model of perfect competition, there appears to be no role for 
advertising, because each firm faces a perfectly elastic demand function and 
can sell as much output as it wants at the current price, which is determined 
through the interaction between supply and demand across the entire market. 
In any case, all market participants are assumed to have perfect information, 
which seems to eliminate the need for firms to advertise.
■ At the other extreme, in the case of monopoly, there appears to be some scope 
for advertising, although the scope is perhaps limited. The monopolist faces an 
inelastic demand function and is insulated from competition by entry barriers. 
The monopolist can therefore choose the price it charges. There may be some 
incentive to advertise if advertising is effective in increasing total industry 
demand. But there is no incentive to advertise in order to tempt consumers 
away from competitors, since, by definition, a monopolist has no competitors.
■ Finally, in the intermediate case of oligopoly, oligopolists who recognise their 
interdependence may prefer to avoid price competition, and instead engage 
in non-price forms of competition such as advertising or research and devel-
opment. There may be strong incentives to advertise, both to increase total 
industry demand, and to attract customers at the expense of competitors.
Chapter 17 discusses theoretical ideas and empirical evidence concerning 
the role of advertising. Section 17.2 presents some facts and figures about the 
economic importance of advertising in modern societies, and about patterns of 
advertising expenditure across different types of product and service. ­Section 17.3 
examines the relationship between certain key attributes of products, services and 
brands, and the likely effectiveness of advertising. The distinction between search 
goods and experience goods is introduced. Section 17.4 develops an optimizing 
model of advertising behaviour. The relationship between market structure 
and the optimal level of advertising is developed more formally, under profit-­
maximizing assumptions.
Section 17.5 examines ways in which advertising acts as a barrier to entry. 
Thanks to past advertising expenditure, an incumbent firm may achieve 
more sales for any given level of current advertising than an entrant, leading 

	
	
	
17.2  Determinants of advertising expenditure	 |	
503
to an absolute cost advantage. Alternatively, economies of scale in advertis-
ing may make it difficult for small-scale entrants to compete with incumbents. 
­Section 17.6 examines the role of advertising in situations where consumers have 
limited information, and an informational asymmetry exists between produc-
ers and consumers. The role of informative advertising in reducing consumers’ 
search costs is considered. A signalling model is developed in which the actual 
content of advertising messages is unimportant, but consumers receive useful 
signals about product quality from the fact that some brands are advertised more 
heavily than others.
Section 17.7 considers whether there is too much advertising in modern 
societies. Some economists have argued that advertising leads to a misalloca-
tion of resources, because advertising distorts consumer preferences. Others 
believe advertising improves the flow of information concerning product and 
service attributes, and therefore improves the allocation of resources. Finally, 
­Section 17.8 provides a selective review of empirical evidence concerning several 
of the issues raised in Chapter 17.
	
17.2	
Determinants of advertising expenditure
Advertising is a huge global business. In the UK, total expenditure on advertising 
increased from £121 million in 1948 to £17.3 billion in 2008 As Table 17.1 shows, 
the contribution of advertising to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) varies widely 
across countries. In 2008 advertising accounted for 1.09 per cent of GDP in the 
US and 1.00 per cent in the UK, while in France, Germany, Italy and Japan the 
corresponding percentage figures were only 0.57 per cent, 0.78 per cent, 0.58 per 
cent and 0.85 per cent, respectively (Advertising Association, 2009).
Many economists draw a distinction between informative and persuasive 
advertising. Informative advertising provides consumers with factual information 
about the existence of a product, service or brand, or about attributes such as its 
price, features or uses. Informative advertising aims to give consumers informa-
tion with which to make informed choices that will help them maximise their 
(exogenously determined) utility functions, subject to their budget constraints. 
An example of such informative advertising in the drug industry is an analysis of 
encouragement of the undiagnosed to seek medical check-ups with direct-
to-consumer advertising. Hosken and Wendling (2013) test this claimed benefit 
by considering data for 30,000 individuals seeking medical advice. They find 
that advertising played a significant role in making such decisions. Persuasive 
advertising, on the other hand, makes claims which may not be objectively veri-
fiable, aiming to change consumers’ perceptions of a product, service or brand 
with a view to stimulating sales. Drinking a sophisticated brand of coffee will 
make you sexually attractive; driving a sporty car will help you become rich, 
glamorous or powerful; wearing a certain brand of trainers will turn you into a 
world champion. One interpretation of persuasive advertising is that it seeks to 
shift consumers’ tastes and thereby change the shape of their utility functions (no 
longer exogenous) in a direction favouring the advertising firm.

Economists often take a positive view of informative advertising, and a more 
critical view of persuasive advertising. Informative advertising is ‘good’ because 
reliable information is a powerful lubricant, needed to ensure the smooth func-
tioning of competitive markets. But persuasive advertising is ‘bad’ because it 
(perhaps deliberately) sets out to mislead or confuse, and may even tend to 
distort competition. In practice, however, it is often difficult to make a clear dis-
tinction between informative and persuasive advertising. Though some research 
(Anderson et al., 2013) has attempted to identify and analyse the informative 
ingredient of an advertising campaign, many advertisements seek to inform and 
persuade at the same time.
[T]o interpret advertising effort as primarily designed to persuade 
consumers to buy what they really do not want, raises an obvious 
difficulty. It assumes that producers find it more profitable to produce 
what consumers do not want, and then to persuade them to buy it, with 
expensive selling campaigns, rather than to produce what consumers do 
already in fact want (without need for selling effort).
(Kirzner, 1997b, p. 57)

How the Mad Men* lost the plot
FT
How Brands Grow (OUP, 2010), is by Professor Byron Sharp, of the Ehrenberg-Bass 
Institute at the University of South Australia. Most marketing books are long on airy 
assertion and short on rigour. How Brands Grow is the opposite. It is empirical, closely 
argued and, in its sober way, incendiary. Sharp marshals a vast array of evidence from 
many different categories — soft drinks, motorbikes, concrete mixers — and identifies 
universal laws of brand purchasing. To date, nobody has seriously challenged his findings, 
though plenty have ignored them.
Sharp’s first law is that brands can’t get bigger on the back of loyal customers. Apply-
ing a statistical analysis to sales data, he demonstrates that the majority of any successful 
brand’s sales comes from ‘light buyers’: people who buy it relatively infrequently. Coca-
Cola’s business is not built on a hardcore of Coke lovers who drink it daily, but on the 
millions of people who buy it once or twice a year. You, for instance, may not think of 
yourself as a Coke buyer, but if you’ve bought it once in the last 12 months, you’re actu-
ally a typical Coke consumer. This pattern recurs across brands, categories, countries 
and time. Whether it’s toothpaste or computers, French cars or Australian banks, brands 
depend on large numbers of people — that’s to say, the masses — who buy them only 
occasionally, leave long gaps between purchases and buy competing brands in between.
If you work for a brand owner, the implications are profound. First, you will never 
increase your brand’s market share by targeting existing users — the task that digital media 
performs so efficiently. The effort and expense marketers put into targeting their own cus-
tomers with emails and web banners is largely wasted; loyalty programmes, says Sharp, ‘do 
practically nothing to drive growth’. What seems like a prudent use of funds — focusing 
on people who have already proved they like the brand — is actually just spinning wheels.
Second, and paradoxically, a successful brand needs to find a way of reaching people 
who are not in its target market, in the sense of people who are predisposed to buy it. The 
brand’s advertising must somehow gain the attention of people who are not interested 
in it, have never bought it, or who bought it so long ago they can’t remember — so that 
when they are ready to buy, it automatically springs to mind. In the wastage is the value.
Advertising, says Sharp, works best when it doesn’t try and persuade, but merely makes 
us remember the brand at the point of purchase. He calls this ‘mental availability’. Human 
beings have powerful spam filters: we screen out nearly all of the 30,000 or so brands in 
a supermarket. Advertising opens people’s eyes; you are simply more likely to notice a 
product in a store, or on a webpage, if you already know it. Gordon Brown, founder of 
market research company Millward Brown, suggested that advertising’s role is to make 
a brand ‘interesting’ as it sits on the shelf. The most effective ads don’t sell, but they do 
make people buy. By keeping the brand alive in your mind, Coke ads change the prob-
ability of you buying it in the next year by a minuscule proportion, a nudge so small that 
you almost certainly won’t notice it, which is why people often say that advertising doesn’t 
affect them. But that tiny effect adds up to millions of cans.

Brands are not the rich sources of differentiation marketers like to think of them as, but 
short cuts through the complexity of decision-making. Most consumers aren’t aware of, 
or interested in, the difference between Nescafé and Kenco and don’t want to spend lon-
ger than they need to thinking about which they prefer. They just want to get coffee and 
get home. Marketers are usually surprised to hear this and find it hard to accept — they 
like to imagine that people who buy their brand are deeply attached to it. But the data 
show that even people who regularly favour one brand over others will pick a competi-
tor if it happens to be more easily available or cheaper that day. In the words of Sharp’s 
mentor, Professor Andrew Ehrenberg: ‘Your customers are customers of other brands 
who occasionally buy you’. Brand advertising, at best, does something very different to 
a search result, an email or a Facebook update.
All of this makes ‘engagement’ largely pointless. Light buyers aren’t fans of your brand. 
They don’t think of it as special or even unique. They aren’t much interested in whether 
your vodka is from Russia or Sweden, or how many times it has been distilled. No sur-
prise, then, that they almost certainly don’t follow your brand on Twitter or visit its 
Facebook page, or that they can think of a thousand things they’d rather do than share 
a ‘digital experience’, let alone sign up to a ‘project’.
Even the people who do join brand pages on Facebook hardly ever click on them. 
The US company Forrester Research has found that the rate of engagement among a 
brand’s Facebook fans is seven in 10,000; for Twitter it is three in 10,000. People might 
watch ads on Facebook or YouTube, but that’s about all the interaction they want (Face-
book itself recently conceded this point). A senior marketer at the drinks company Dia-
geo, where Sharp’s book has been influential, put it to me bluntly. ‘After 10 or 15 years 
of f***ing around with digital we’ve realised that people don’t want to “engage” with 
brands, because they don’t care about them.’
What if you were to invent a way of getting light buyers to recall your brand just as 
they are about to choose? Ideally, it would reach millions of people who aren’t particu-
larly thinking about your product. You’d want them to see the same thing at around the 
same time, so that they can talk to each other about what they’ve seen, reinforcing each 
other’s memories of it. You would need to sneak up on them, since they have near-zero 
interest in hearing from you, indeed don’t want to. You’d need a form of content requir-
ing negligible mental effort to process: one which comes in bite-sized chunks, but which 
is still capable of moving and delighting. It turns out there is an app for that: the TV ad.
TV is in healthier condition than anyone predicted 10 years ago. The average viewer 
watches nearly as much TV, on TV sets, as he or she always did, and now they watch 
programmes on mobiles and tablets too. We aren’t skipping ads any more than we used 
to: 87 per cent of viewing in the UK is ‘live’. A recent US study found that ad-skipping is 
declining; people are too distracted by their phones to bother. The passive nature of TV 
turns out to be its hidden weapon: it facilitates a détente between viewer and advertiser. 
The best ads make us pay attention and look up from our phones.

In general, therefore, advertising seeks to either inform or persuade or do both. 
However, there are specific reasons why firms invest in advertising campaigns:
■ To launch a product or service. Advertising can be used to provide potential 
consumers with information concerning a new product or service. Such adver-
tising may be primarily informative rather than persuasive. For example, the 
UK government and firms in the financial services sector advertised heavily 
in order to provide the public with detailed information before and after the 
launch of Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) in 1999.
■ To provide information on price and quality. Advertising can be used to pro-
vide consumers with information concerning price and quality attributes of 
products and services. This is particularly important if these attributes tend to 
change rapidly over time, as a result of competition or technological change. 
Advertising may be used to provide consumers with information on the loca-
tion of the firm’s sales outlets. One estimate suggests consumers in the US 
were exposed to an average of 3,000 advertising messages each day (The Econ-
omist, 2004b).
■ To increase or protect market share. Advertising campaigns may be designed to 
persuade consumers that a firm’s products and services are superior to those 
of its competitors. In a rapidly expanding market, there may be less need for 
advertising of this kind, as there is a large pool of potential customers avail-
able for all firms. Where consumer demand is stagnant or decreasing, firms 
may tend to advertise more heavily, in an effort to protect their individual 
shares of a dwindling market.
■ To establish a brand’s image or strengthen consumers’ brand loyalties. Advertising 
can be considered as a type of investment expenditure, whereby a firm seeks 
to create positive associations in consumers’ minds with its own brand, which 
may yield benefits to the firm in the form of lasting consumer brand loyalty. 
Goodwill and positive reputation effects can act as significant entry barriers, 
making it difficult for outside firms to establish a presence in a market domi-
nated by an established brand that has been heavily advertised in the past. In 
2006, the furniture retailer DFS spent over £106 million in the UK promoting 
its brand image (Advertising Association, 2007).
■ Change in the marginal cost of advertising. A cause for an increase in the level 
of adverting is the possibility of a change in the marginal costs of advertis-
ing. Rauch (2013) examines the effect of changes in government taxation of 
advertising in various parts of Austria. Some taxation was increased whilst 
other areas saw a decrease in taxation. The consequence is that advertising 
expenditure moves away from more heavily taxed areas, and the level of taxa-
tion is correlated with the amount of informative advertising.
Theoretical models of oligopoly suggest firms may prefer to engage in non-price 
rather than price competition. Industry advertising expenditure as a proportion 
of industry sales, known as advertising intensity or the industry’s advertising-to-
sales ratio provides an indication of the importance of advertising as a form of 
non-price competition. As shown in Table 17.2, the advertising-to-sales ratio

Court stubs out fight against plain packaging 
for cigarettes
FT
It is more than 50 years since Marlboro Man disappeared from British television screens, 
and 13 since he vanished from billboards and newspapers. But Friday brought the final 
blow. After a last-ditch high court challenge failed, all cigarettes manufactured for sale in 
the UK must now be boxed in a dull olive packet with large graphics warning of the dan-
gers of smoking. The muddy hue of the box is the least appealing colour that researchers 
could find and was copied from Australia, which already has plain packaging. In addi-
tion to banning all branding, the law also forbids ‘lipstick’ packs and other innovative 
ways of opening the box. The name of the brand and type of cigarette must be printed in 
the same, small white font. From a distance, it will be impossible to tell the packs apart.
This poses a problem for big tobacco companies and small independent retailers alike. 
Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and Japan 
Tobacco International, who brought the challenge, all argue that they are being deprived 
of their intellectual property without compensation. They also fear a hit to profits as 
customers turn to cheaper brands. ‘A lot of the premium of a pack is in the brand,’ said 
Martin Deboo, consumer goods analyst at Jefferies. ‘If a pack of cigarettes is only dis-
tinguished by taste or price, people may downtrade, and in a market like the UK, with 
fixed taxes per pack, that risks shrinking the profit pool.’ The Department of Health itself 
acknowledged in its final impact assessment that ‘standardised packaging reduces the 
ability of tobacco manufacturing firms to sustain sales of higher-priced products relying 
on brand characteristics’.
Retailers of tobacco, such as supermarkets and convenience stores, are also wor-
ried. Downtrading will cost UK retailers £90m over the next 10 years, according to the 
National Federation of Retail Newsagents, with a further £500,000 loss coming from 
increased waiting times and slower sales as shopkeepers try to locate the cigarettes, no 
longer able to distinguish a Camel from a Silk Cut purely by pack design. ‘Of course it 
will hit sales,’ says Kamal Patel, owner of News Studio, a convenience store in Borough, 
London. ‘At the moment, it takes me about five seconds at most to serve someone a 
packet of cigarettes. Once plain packets arrive, that will be nearer 30, and people at the 
back of the queue will start getting restless and leave.’ Shopkeepers have 12 months to sell 
off all remaining stock but, as of this week, all new cigarettes produced must be boxed in 
the plain packaging. The standardised packets are set to arrive in stores over the coming 
months; from May 2017, retailers will not be allowed to sell tobacco in the old branded 
packets. The tobacco companies will be fine — they’ve got a massive market in Africa 
where there are no laws against packaging, and here they’ve got huge margins on eliquids. 
But no one cares about the retailers.
The court ruling comes as big tobacco companies battle swaths of new regulation 
designed to curb smoking rates. This month, a new EU law that will ban the sales of packs 
of 10 cigarettes and outlaw flavourings such as menthol was upheld. Another law that

bans the advertising of ecigarettes and limits the size of the liquid tanks in the devices was 
also upheld, targeting a revenue stream that tobacco companies are banking on.
Before this week, Australia was the only country to have introduced plain packaging. 
It claims that it is having the desired effect, with a ‘statistically significant’ fall in smoking 
prevalence of 0.55 percentage points since being introduced. Big tobacco groups counter 
that the decline is in line with a general downward trend. But while tobacco companies 
and retailers bemoan the decision, it has been celebrated by health campaigners. ‘The 
tobacco industry put up every excuse to stop the introduction of plain packaging,’ said 
Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation. ‘But not one was more 
powerful than the fact their glitzy packaging lures children to smoke an addictive product 
that kills half of its long-term users.’

varies considerably between product groups (Advertising Association, 2009). In 
the UK in 2008, babycare products, internet service providers and hair colou-
rants all had relatively high advertising-to-sales ratios, 39.70 per cent, 21.84 per 
cent and 16.48 per cent, respectively. In contrast, sportswear, DVD players, and 
televisions all had much lower advertising-to-sales ratios, 0.26 per cent, 0.68 per 
cent and 0.58 per cent, respectively. However, these percentages can sometimes 
be misleading. In some cases, absolute expenditure on advertising is huge, but 
sales are so large that advertising intensity turns out to be quite low. The motor 
industry, with an advertising-to-sales ratio of only 0.03 per cent in Table 17.2, 
is an obvious example. Table 17.3 identifies the UK firms that spent most on 
advertising in 2008, and the most heavily advertised brands.

Case study 17.3
The serial painkiller
FT
As Marijn Dekkers, chief executive of Bayer, presents the latest quarterly results of the 
German life sciences and chemicals group today, he will outline plenty of changes. But 
there will be one constant: a product that has remained a mainstay of the company for 
decades. Aspirin, the painkiller the company launched more than a century ago, was still 
generating €766m in sales in 2010. That made it one of just a handful of Bayer’s $1bn-plus 
a year ‘blockbuster’ drugs, led by Betaferon for multiple sclerosis and the birth control 
pill Yaz, but it is the only one long unprotected by patents. ‘It’s hard to imagine Bayer 
without aspirin, or the other way round,’ says Flemming Ornskov, head of strategic mar-
keting at Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals. ‘It is an integral part of our history. I wish

I could say the company set out 100 years ago to have this as a sustainable success.’ Yet 
the story of this medicine, and Bayer’s continued market dominance for aspirin – which 
has become the generic term for the painkiller that Bayer originally named – is the antith-
esis of the conventional story of a modern drug, in which a company invests substantial 
sums in research and development to make, patent and sell a product for a limited life 
before losing control to generic rivals.
Despite being based on an ancient remedy, and suffering weak intellectual property 
protection and intense competition, Bayer’s Aspirin has survived expropriation of its 
name, tough regulatory action and periodic health scares to remain one of the top-selling 
drugs of all time. Last year a fresh, targeted marketing effort yielded double-digit sales 
increases. ‘We had done such a good job communicating [generally] around aspirin that 
consumers had forgotten about its excellent efficacy for a broader range of pain,’ says 
Jay Kolpon, vice-president of Bayer’s consumer care division.
The remedy has undergone regular evolutions that were designed to keep Bayer in 
control. The medicinal value of the willow bark from which it derives was described by 
­Hippocrates in 400BC, and an 18th-century English doctor used it to treat rheumatic 
pain. Acetylsalicylic acid, the active ingredient, was developed in 1853, and it was only 
in 1897 that Bayer’s involvement began when its chemist Felix Hoffmann synthesised a 
stable form. Within two years – just as it was also commercialising heroin as a branded 
cough remedy – Bayer launched its branded painkiller Aspirin, which rapidly became the 
world’s top-selling drug. The name is derived from ‘a’ for acetyl, ‘spir’ from the spiraea 
plant (a source of the ingredient salicin) and ‘in’, a common suffix for medicines at the time.
A key to its success was Bayer’s consistent investment in the brand. In the UK and 
the US, Bayer received patents, but in many countries, including Germany, it won only 
registration as a trademark for Aspirin. During the first world war, the company’s trade-
marks – Bayer and Aspirin – were expropriated in the US, France, the UK and much of 
the British Commonwealth, who were allies against Germany. It fought hard to retain 
its exclusive use of the trademark Aspirin in the rest of the world, and to regain rights 
where it could. It could never win back trademark protection for aspirin in the US, but 
it ultimately reacquired the Bayer name there in 1994. That allowed it to market ‘Bayer 
Aspirin’, and signalled the start of reinvigorated efforts to market the brand globally.
A second factor has been the regular expansion of aspirin’s medical uses. Originally 
sold to treat rheumatism, and then lumbago and neuralgia, the drug’s value has grown 
significantly. In the 1980s, regulators approved it to protect against repeat heart attacks 
and strokes. Many new applications for aspirin came through ‘retrospective’ analyses of 
widespread existing uses of the drug rather than specific ‘prospective’ clinical trials. Mr 
Ornskov says Bayer still spends more than €1m a year on testing, although one senior 
former executive says: ‘A lot of the drive for aspirin marketing came from our consumer 
business. The [innovative] pharma guys are reluctant owners of the franchise.’
A third reason for Bayer’s success with aspirin has been periodic reformulations – all 
brand-protected – to renew its appeal. Early in the 20th century, it switched aspirin’s 
format from powder to tablets. A chewable version for children came in the 1950s. In 
the 1970s, Aspirin Plus C combined it with Vitamin C in effervescent form. In the 1990s, 

512	
|	 17    ■    Advertising
Bayer added the coated Aspirin Protect, which dissolves in the intestines to reduce the 
risk of stomach problems, which have become a cause for concern among physicians in 
recent years. Bayer’s multiple formats for the drug continue to evolve, with the latest 
including low-dose Aspirin Cardio to protect against repeat strokes and heart attacks 
and Cafiaspirina, which is mixed with caffeine.
Bayer has also benefited from its persistent intensive marketing of Aspirin. Originally 
targeted at physicians, the drug was sold over the counter without prescription from 
1915. In addition, in some countries, including the UK, it continues to be prescribed and 
sometimes reimbursed by health services, which adds to its medical credibility and helps 
justify premium prices.
Bayer’s Aspirin remains widely advertised, with an emphasis on the company’s high 
quality and the product’s breadth of use. Some of Bayer’s campaigns have triggered rep-
rimands, including from the US Federal Trade Commission and Food and Drug Admin-
istration, over claimed medical uses that were not authorised by regulators.
The company has boosted its credibility by sponsoring Aspirin scientific prizes and 
funding bodies such as the Aspirin Foundation in the UK, which advocates for the drug’s 
wider use. Set up in the 1970s to counter rivals’ campaigns for paracetamol that warned of 
the dangers of Reyes syndrome, a rare but lethal condition linked to children taking aspi-
rin, the foundation today also disseminates research suggesting the drug’s potential for 
new applications. Even this Friday, a new academic study will analyse aspirin’s potential 
to prevent cancer. Bayer may long ago have lost the patent and reduced its own invest-
ments in development, but as the pharmaceutical industry seeks to diversify into new, less 
risky products and emerging markets, it remains an anchor brand to envy.

Advertising and product characteristics
Several economists have suggested that product characteristics may be an impor-
tant determinant of advertising intensity. For example, it has been suggested 
that goods whose attributes consumers can assess accurately before they are 
purchased and consumed are unlikely to be the subject of large-scale advertising 
campaigns. In contrast, goods whose attributes are difficult to assess may be 
more heavily advertised. For products that are purchased regularly, consum-
ers are unlikely to search for detailed information prior to purchase, and are 
unlikely to be persuaded by advertising that the brands they consume have quali-
ties other than those consumers can discern for themselves. For products that are 
purchased less frequently, consumers may be more open to persuasion through 
advertising prior to purchase. Consumers are more likely to search for detailed 
information prior to purchase of products whose price accounts for a signifi-
cant proportion of a typical consumer’s budget. For such products, persuasive

advertising may be ineffective in swaying the consumer’s eventual purchase deci-
sion. For inexpensive products or services, on the other hand, mistakes tend to 
matter less, and consumers may be content to be swayed by advertising messages.
Nelson (1974a,b) defines search goods as those whose attributes can easily be 
determined by inspection, either by touch or by sight, prior to purchase. Com-
mon examples include clothes, carpets, household and office furniture. Experience 
goods are those whose attributes can only be determined when they are consumed, 
after they have been purchased. Common examples include foods, toothpaste, 
washing-up liquid, cars and hi-fi systems. Nelson argues that the probable effec-
tiveness of persuasive advertising differs systematically between search goods and 
experience goods. There may be a role for informative advertising of search goods, 
to ensure consumers are aware of the product’s price, capabilities or existence. But 
persuasive advertising of search goods is unlikely to be effective, because it is easy 
for consumers to assess the quality of the product for themselves before deciding 
whether or not to purchase. The truth (or otherwise) of advertising claims about 
the qualities of search goods is in any case transparent.
For experience goods, in contrast, there is likely to be a role for both infor-
mative and persuasive advertising. If consumers cannot assess the quality of the 
product for themselves prior to purchase, the purchase decision may be swayed 
by persuasive advertising. The truth (or otherwise) of advertising claims about 
the qualities of experience goods only becomes apparent after the consumer is 
already committed and purchase has already taken place. Accordingly, Nelson 
concludes that advertising intensity is likely to be higher for experience goods 
than for search goods.
Darby and Karni (1973) extend this classification to include credence goods; 
see also Mixon (1994). A credence good is one whose quality cannot easily be 
assessed before or after consumption, because a judgement about quality requires 
the consumer to have specialised knowledge of the product or service. Common 
examples are dental services, medical care, car repair services and (perhaps) uni-
versity courses. Applying similar reasoning, both informative and persuasive 
advertising may be effective in the case of credence goods.
Frequency of purchase may also have implications for the effectiveness of 
persuasive advertising, especially in the case of experience goods. Arterburn 
and Woodbury (1981) use the term convenience goods to describe goods that are 
relatively cheap and that are purchased frequently. In contrast, shopping goods 
are expensive and purchased infrequently. For example, washing-up liquid and 
hi-fi equipment are both experience goods, because their qualities cannot eas-
ily be identified prior to purchase and consumption; but washing-up liquid is 
a convenience good, while hi-fi equipment is a shopping good. Bin-liners and 
furniture are both search goods, because their qualities can easily be assessed 
prior to purchase and consumption, but bin-liners are a convenience good, while 
furniture is a shopping good.
Suppose there are two new brands of washing-up liquid, one of which is of 
high quality and the other low quality. In both cases, persuasive advertising might 
be effective in persuading consumers to try either brand for the first time. Once 
consumers have had the opportunity to assess the qualities of the brands for them-
selves, however, only the high-quality brand is likely to attract repeat purchases. 

514	
|	 17    ■    Advertising
The advertising expenditure devoted to the low-quality brand is mostly wasted if 
this brand turns out to be incapable of attracting repeat purchases. This discussion 
suggests advertising might sometimes have a role to play in signalling quality to 
consumers. The content of the advertising message itself may be irrelevant, but the 
very fact that a brand is advertised heavily suggests the producer is confident that 
consumers who try the brand will be satisfied, and will make repeat purchases. A 
model of quality signalling through advertising is described in Section 17.6.
Many consumer durables, such as cars, washing machines, and audio-visual 
equipment, can be classified as experience goods and as shopping goods. Other 
things being equal, the infrequency of purchase might suggest advertising intensi-
ties for shopping goods should be higher than for convenience goods. But there 
is a countervailing factor. Shopping goods are expensive, and their purchase 
accounts for a large proportion of a typical consumer’s budget. When purchas-
ing shopping goods that are also experience goods, consumers are likely to make 
efforts to gather reliable information about the attributes of competing brands.
	
17.4	
Advertising and profit maximization
Whether informative or persuasive advertising is employed, firms spend money 
on advertising campaigns to increase the demand for their products or services, 
in the hope that increased consumer demand will yield a higher profit. This sec-
tion analyses the firm’s advertising decision within a traditional framework of 
profit maximization. In order to select the level of advertising expenditure that 
maximises its profit, the firm advertises until the marginal benefit (in terms of 
increased revenue) gained from the last unit of advertising equals the marginal 
cost. Next, the problem of selecting the profit-maximizing level of advertising 
is considered separately for the market structures of monopoly, oligopoly and 
perfect competition.
Monopoly
In the case of a monopoly, only a simple extension of the neoclassical model 
of profit maximization is needed to identify the optimal level of advertising. In 
­Figure 17.1, it is assumed that the position of a monopolist’s average revenue 
function, which is the same as the market demand function, depends on the 
level of advertising expenditure. Advertising expenditures of a1, a2, a3 and a4 are 
shown in Figure 17.1, and it is assumed the difference between each successive 
level of advertising expenditure (a2 - a1, a3 - a2 and so on) is the same, and 
equal to ∆a. It is assumed there are diminishing returns to advertising, so on each 
successive occasion advertising expenditure is increased by ∆a, the outward shift 
in the average revenue function becomes smaller. For simplicity, production cost 
is assumed to be linear in output. The firm’s total cost is the sum of its production 
cost and its advertising expenditure.
■ When advertising expenditure is a1, the firm’s optimal output is Q1, where 
MR1 = MC.

	
	
	
17.4  Advertising and profit maximization	 |	
515
■ By increasing advertising expenditure from a1 to a2, the firm increases its 
optimal output to Q2, where MR2 = MC. The increase in operating profit 
(revenue minus production cost) of ∆p2 exceeds the advertising expenditure 
of ∆a. The decision to advertise is beneficial and the shift from Q1 to Q2 is 
profitable. The firm should continue to increase its advertising expenditure 
until the marginal increase in operating profit is just equal to the marginal 
increase in advertising expenditure.
■ By increasing advertising expenditure from a2 to a3, the firm increases its opti-
mal output to Q3, where MR3 = MC. The increase in operating profit of ∆p3 
is just equal to the additional advertising expenditure of ∆a. The effect of the 
extra advertising is neutral, and the firm is indifferent between operating at 
Q3 and Q2. If advertising is continuous (∆a S 0) rather than discrete, there is 
a unique profit-maximizing level of advertising expenditure.
■ Finally, by increasing advertising expenditure from a3 to a4, the optimal out-
put increases to Q4, where MR4 = MC. The increase in operating profit of 
∆p4 is less than the additional advertising expenditure of ∆a. The extra adver-
tising is not worthwhile, and the firm should not seek to operate at Q4.
In a seminal article, Dorfman and Steiner (1954) develop an analysis of the 
monopolist’s optimal advertising decision using an algebraic model. Their results 
are insightful, and working through the formal algebraic derivation is worthwhile. 
The Dorfman–Steiner framework is essentially the same as in Figure 17.1, except 
it is assumed that advertising expenditure is continuous rather than discrete, and 
Figure 17.1  Advertising and profit maximization in monopoly

516	
|	 17    ■    Advertising
it is no longer assumed that the firm’s demand (or average revenue) function and 
production costs are necessarily linear in output. The monopolist’s demand (or 
average revenue) function is:
Q = Q(P, a)
where Q denotes quantity demanded, P denotes price and a denotes advertising 
expenditure. The monopolist’s cost function is:
c = c(Q) + a
where Q denotes quantity produced, and c denotes cost. The monopolist’s profit is:
p = TR - c(Q) - a = P * Q(P, a) - c(Q) - a
For profit maximization, the additional profit gained from a marginal increase 
in advertising expenditure should be zero. For simplicity, Dorfman and Steiner 
assume that when the firm changes its advertising expenditure it adjusts its quan-
tity produced but does not alter its price. Let ∆Q, ∆c and ∆a denote the changes 
in output, cost and advertising expenditure, respectively. For profit maximiza-
tion, the following relationship must hold between these quantities:
Pa ∆Q
∆a b - a ∆c
∆Qba ∆Q
∆a b - 1 = 0 or bP - a ∆c
∆Qb r e ∆Q

PQ and note 
that (∆c/∆Q) = MC:

From Chapter 2, (P - MC)/P = 1/ PED , where  PED  is the price elasticity 
of demand. Furthermore, (P - MC)/P is the Lerner index, widely used as an 
indicator of market power (see Section 3.4).
Applying the general definition for any elasticity, a ∆Q

Q = AED, AED 
is the advertising elasticity of demand (defined as the ratio of the proportionate 
change in quantity demanded to the proportionate change in advertising expen-
diture). By substitution and re-ordering the previous expression:

bAED or a

This expression is known as the Dorfman–Steiner condition. It implies that for 
profit maximization the ratio of advertising expenditure to total revenue, or the 
advertising-to-sales ratio, should be proportional to the ratio of advertising elas-
ticity of demand to price elasticity of demand. The intuition underlying this result 
is as follows. When the advertising elasticity is high relative to the price elasticity, 

	
	
	
17.4  Advertising and profit maximization	 |	
517
it is efficient for the monopolist to advertise (rather than cut price) in order to 
achieve any given increase in quantity demanded. Accordingly, the monopolist 
spends a relatively high proportion of its sales revenue on advertising. On the 
other hand, when the price elasticity is high relative to the advertising elasticity, 
it is efficient to cut price (rather than advertise) in order to achieve any given 
increase in quantity demanded. Accordingly, the monopolist spends a relatively 
low proportion of its sales revenue on advertising.
Oligopoly
The preceding analysis refers to a monopolist, and the reactions of competing 
firms are therefore irrelevant. To apply the same kind of analysis to the case 
of oligopoly, the analysis needs to be extended to take account of the interde-
pendence between the oligopolistic firms. Consider a market in which there are 
two duopolists: firms A and B. Assume initially, for simplicity, that firm B’s 
advertising expenditure is fixed, and consider the profit-maximizing advertising 
decision of firm A. Adapting previous notation, let qA denote firm A’s quantity 
demanded and aA denote firm A’s advertising expenditure. Q denotes total indus-
try demand, equal to the combined demand for firms A and B, qA + qB;  mA 
denotes firm A’s share of industry demand, or qA/Q; and AEDA denotes firm 
A’s advertising elasticity of demand.
The revised expression for AEDA is as follows:
AEDA = aA
Q
 a ∆Q
∆aA
b + aA
mA
 a ∆mA
∆aA
b
The two terms on the right-hand-side of this expression represent the following 
effects of a small change in aA on qA. First, there is an increase in total industry 
demand, ∆Q, part of which goes to firm A. Second, there is an increase in firm 
A’s share of total industry demand, mA. The expression for AEDA justifies the 
idea that the advertising elasticity of demand under oligopoly should be higher 
than it is under monopoly. When firm A increases its advertising expenditure, it 
benefits not only from an increase in total industry demand (as does the monopo-
list) but also from an increase in its own market share. This ‘market share’ effect 
does not apply in the case of the monopolist. In other words, for a monopolist, 
mA = 1 and ∆mA = 0, so the second term on the right-hand-side of the expres-
sion for AEDA is zero. For an oligopolist, mA 6 1 and ∆mA 7 0, so the second 
term on the right-hand side of the expression for AEDA is positive.

518	
|	 17    ■    Advertising
advertise: not only does advertising increase total industry demand, but it also 
increases the advertising firm’s share of industry demand.
The final extension to the analysis of firm A’s profit-maximizing advertis-
ing decision under duopoly builds into the formula for AEDA an allowance for 
the effects of firm B’s reaction to firm A’s decision to increase its advertising 
expenditure. Firm B’s advertising expenditure is denoted aB, and the change in 
advertising expenditure implemented by firm B is ∆aB. The revised expression 
for AEDA is as follows:
AEDA = aA
Q
 ba ∆Q
∆aA
b + a ∆Q
∆aB
ba ∆aB
∆aA
b r
+ aA
mA
 ba ∆mA
∆aA
b + a ∆mA
∆aB
ba ∆aB
∆aA
b r
The two terms of the right-hand side of this expression represent the same two 
effects of a small change in aA on qA as before. But as well as the direct effect of 
∆aA on Q and on mA, there are also indirect effects resulting from ∆aB, the change 
in firm B’s advertising expenditure implemented in response to the change in firm 
A’s advertising expenditure. Assuming (∆aB/∆aA) is positive, firm B responds to 
an increase in firm A’s advertising by increasing its own advertising. Firm A gains 
to the extent that firm B’s action increases total industry demand, but firm A also 
loses to the extent that firm B’s action reduces firm A’s market share.

Because (∆Q/∆aB) 7 0 and (∆mA/∆aB) 6 0, firm A’s advertising-to-sales ratio 
in the case where firm B reacts to firm A’s actions could be either higher or lower 
than in the case where firm B’s behaviour is fixed.
However, suppose the effect of advertising on each firm’s market share gener-
ally tends to dominate the effect on total industry demand. In the most extreme 
case, it could be assumed (∆Q/∆aA) = (∆Q/∆aB) = 0. Suppose also each firm 
tends to ignore or underestimate its rival’s reaction to its own advertising deci-
sions. In the most extreme case, suppose firm A assumes (∆aB/∆aA) = 0, when 
in fact (∆aB/∆aA) 7 0. Then, according to the previous expression, firm A will 
tend to set its advertising-to-sales ratio at a level too high for profit maximization. 
Firm A’s advertising-to-sales ratio under the (false) assumption (∆aB/∆aA) = 0 is:

The second of these expressions is smaller than the first, because (∆mA/∆aB) 6 0 
and (∆aB/∆aA) 7 0. Accordingly, in this case firm A tends to overspend on 
advertising. If firm B has a similar tendency to underestimate the size of firm 
A’s reactions, there will be a general tendency for the firms collectively to 
advertise more heavily than they would if they took proper account of their 
interdependence.
Perfect competition
The Dorfman–Steiner condition, which states that the profit-maximizing 
advertising-to-sales ratio equals the ratio of the firm’s advertising elasticity of 
demand to its price elasticity of demand, provides a straightforward justifica-
tion for the assertion made in Section 17.1 that there is no role for advertising 
in perfect competition. The demand function of the perfectly competitive firm 
is horizontal, and the firm’s price elasticity of demand is infinite. Accordingly, 
the ratio of the firm’s advertising elasticity of demand to its price elasticity of 
demand is zero. The profit-maximizing advertising-to-sales ratio is also zero. If 
the firm can sell as much output as it likes at the current market price, there is 
no point in advertising.
The alternative formulation of the Dorfman–Steiner condition, which states 
that the profit-maximizing advertising-to-sales ratio equals the product of the 
Lerner index and the advertising elasticity of demand, produces the same conclu-
sion. For the perfectly competitive firm, the Lerner index is zero because price 
equals marginal cost. Therefore the profit-maximizing advertising-to-sales ratio 
is also zero.
Figure 17.2 summarises the conclusions of Section 17.4 concerning the rela-
tionship between market structure and the profit-maximizing advertising-
to-sales ratio. The latter should be zero under perfect competition, positive under

oligopoly and also under monopoly, but larger under oligopoly than under 
monopoly. Section 17.8 includes a review of a number of empirical studies of this 
relationship between advertising intensity and market structure or concentration, 
as summarised in Figure 17.2.

Advertising as a barrier to entry
Advertising can act as a barrier to entry in several ways:
■ The need to advertise increases start-up costs. Entrants may need to spend heav-
ily on advertising in order to establish name recognition and a presence in the 
market. This raises entrants’ initial costs. It may be difficult for an entrant to 
raise the required finance because the returns to advertising outlays are usually 
uncertain (Weiss, 1963).
■ High levels of advertising build up reputation effects. Past advertising by incum-
bents creates goodwill and strengthens consumer brand loyalties. These advan-
tages may be difficult for entrants to overcome. Reputation effects may be 
particularly strong for first-movers: firms that have in the past pioneered a 
particular product or brand. Pioneering firms are often able to shape consumer 
tastes in favour of their own products or brands (Glazer, 1985). Robinson 
et al. (1994) survey the sources of first-mover advantages, while Bar-Isaac and 
Tadelis (2008) provide an extensive analysis of the models of seller reputation.
■ Economies of scale in advertising. According to Scherer and Ross (1990), there 
are two sources of economies of scale in advertising. First, firms must advertise 
a large number of times before advertising messages permeate the minds of 
consumers, and produce increased sales. Second, large-scale advertisers may 
pay less per unit of advertising than small-scale advertisers. Furthermore, an 
indirect ‘distribution effect’ arises when retailers increase stocks of products 
in response to a manufacturer’s advertising campaign, in the expectation that 
demand will increase (The Economist, 2004b).
Figure 17.3 shows the possible advertising response functions of an incumbent 
firm and an entrant. These functions reflect the responsiveness of sales to the 
volume of advertising expenditure. For the entrant, assumed to be advertising its 
product or brand for the first time, a threshold level of advertising expenditure 
of a1 must be achieved before its advertising begins to have any positive effect on 
sales. The entrant must spend at least a1, in order for its brand to achieve name 
recognition among potential purchasers. Further advertising beyond a1 increases 
the entrant’s sales, although diminishing returns eventually set in. Saturation 
point is reached at an advertising expenditure level of a2. Any further advertising 
beyond a2 has a harmful effect on sales: consumers become fed up with receiving 
the firm’s advertising messages, and stop buying the product or brand.
The incumbent is assumed to have advertised its product or brand in the past. 
Past advertising is assumed to have been effective in building up name recogni-
tion and consumer brand loyalty. In contrast to the entrant, the incumbent does 
not have to overcome an advertising threshold before it reaps any benefits from 

	
	
	
17.5  Advertising as a barrier to entry	 |	
521
advertising: any advertising expenditure in the current period produces some 
increase in sales. Like the entrant, however, the incumbent is subject to dimin-
ishing returns to advertising, and may reach a saturation point beyond which 
further advertising has a harmful effect on sales.
Advertising response functions such as those shown in Figure 17.3 may con-
tribute to entry barriers due to both an absolute cost advantage favouring the 
incumbent, and economies of scale (see Section 12.2). Thanks to its past adver-
tising investment, the incumbent achieves more sales for any given amount of 
current advertising expenditure. This implies the incumbent has an absolute cost 
advantage over the entrant.
Furthermore, because the gradient of the advertising response function is 
increasing over the lower end of the range of values for a, and because the thresh-
old level of advertising expenditure is effectively a fixed cost from the entrant’s 
perspective, there are economies of scale in advertising. Within the relevant range 
of values for a, the effectiveness of each unit of advertising expenditure increases 
as the volume of advertising expenditure increases. If advertising costs are incor-
porated into the firms’ total cost functions, economies of scale in advertising may 
change the location of the minimum efficient scale of production. This in turn 
may alter the extent to which the cost structure, and in particular the need to be 
producing on a scale sufficiently large to be cost-efficient, acts as a barrier to entry.
Scott Morton (2000) examines the extent to which the advertising of patented 
branded pharmaceutical products in the US immediately prior to the loss of pat-
ent protection deterred the entry of generic drugs. The sample comprises drugs 
that lost patent protection over the period 1986–91, while the advertising data 
are monthly from three years before to one year after patent expiration. There 
is little evidence that advertising deterred entry. Advertising response may vary 
not only between incumbent firms and entrants but also among incumbent firms. 
Fare et al. (2004) examine the cost-efficiency of advertising by media (television, 
radio, print) for a sample of six large US brewers over the period 1983–93. Only 
one of the six firms (Anheuser Buesch) is found to use advertising efficiently. 
Advertising efficiency estimates are found to be positively linked to profitability.

Advertising, information search and quality signalling
Information plays a crucial role in competition. In the perfectly competitive 
model, all buyers and sellers have perfect knowledge. Consequently, one price 
prevails, and all firms earn normal profit. However, if information is imperfect 
or if there is an informational asymmetry between producers and consumers, 
consumers may not be capable of making an informed choice about the products 
and services they purchase. This may have serious implications for the effective-
ness of competition and the nature of market equilibrium.
Some economists have suggested that advertising improves the speed and effi-
ciency with which consumers search for information. Consumers gather infor-
mation through a search process, which imposes costs in the form of wages or 
leisure time foregone. From the consumer’s perspective, advertising reduces the 
cost of obtaining this information. Equivalently, if products are heavily adver-
tised, the consumer can obtain a given amount of information more cheaply, 
since the information obtained from advertisements reduces the need for inde-
pendent search.
In Figure 17.4, the marginal cost function MC represents the cost of each 
additional hour of search and is assumed to be constant. The benefit to the 
consumer from each additional hour of search is represented by the downward-
sloping marginal benefit function MB1. The benefit gained from spending addi-
tional time searching declines as the time already spent increases. The search 
process continues until the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost, with S1 
hours devoted to search.
The provision of information through advertising reduces the marginal benefit 
gained from each additional hour of information search, shifting the marginal 
benefit function to the left from MB1 to MB2. The optimal search time decreases 
from S1 to S2. If, as seems likely, information is disseminated more efficiently 
through advertising than it is through having large numbers of consumers search-
ing for information independently, the sum of the product price and the search 
cost is likely to be lower due to advertising.

Advertising is among other things, a method of providing potential 
buyers with knowledge of the identity of sellers. It is clearly an 
immensely powerful instrument for the elimination of ignorance – 
comparable in force to the use of the book instead of the oral discourse 
to communicate knowledge.
(Stigler, 1961, p. 220)
Advertising also plays an important role in some signalling models, which 
deal with situations of asymmetric information between producers and con-
sumers. In a classic analysis of the market for secondhand cars, Akerlof (1970) 
argues that sellers tend to have more information than potential buyers about 
the true quality of each car on the market, and a potential buyer may not be 
able to tell which cars that are for sale are of good quality and which ones 
should be avoided. In the terminology of the advertising literature, secondhand 
cars are an experience good. Faced with this uncertainty, the maximum price 
a rational buyer is willing to pay falls somewhere between the true value of a 
high-quality car and the true value of a low-quality car. However, if sellers of high-
quality cars are unwilling to sell at a price below the true value of a high-quality 
car, they withdraw from the market. The market for high-­quality cars col-
lapses, and only low-quality cars are traded. The title of Akerlof’s article, ‘The 
market for lemons’, refers to American slang terminology for a low-­quality 
secondhand car.
A similar situation might exist in the market for a product with competing 
high-quality and low-quality brands. If the product is an experience good and 
potential buyers cannot distinguish between the low- and high-quality brands 
before purchase, there may be a tendency for high-quality brands to be driven 
out of the market by low-quality brands, for the reasons discussed by Akerlof. 
However, Kihlstrom and Riordan (1984) and Milgrom and Roberts (1986) show 
that if there are repeat purchases of the product, the producer of a high-quality 
brand may be able to use advertising as a signal of quality. The idea is that for 
advertising to be worthwhile it has to persuade consumers to buy the product 
more than once. It is not worthwhile for a low-quality producer to advertise its 
brand as high quality, because consumers who are initially misled into purchas-
ing the inferior brand discover from experience that the brand is low quality, 
and will not make the same mistake again. However, it is worthwhile for a high- 
quality producer to advertise, because consumers who purchase this brand and 
confirm from experience that it is high quality will make repeat purchases.
To demonstrate the signalling model, it is assumed that each brand of a certain 
product has a two-period lifetime. A low-quality brand that is known by con-
sumers to be low-quality earns a profit of 10 per period. However, a low-quality 
brand can earn a profit of 30 per period, if it is mistakenly perceived by consum-
ers to be high quality. A high-quality brand can earn a profit of 25 per period, 
provided consumers can distinguish between the high-quality brand and its low-
quality imitators. If consumers cannot make this distinction, in each period the 
high-quality brand is driven out of the market by a flood of low-quality imitators, 
and the high-quality brand earns zero profit.

524	
|	 17    ■    Advertising
Suppose initially there is no advertising, and the low-quality producer can 
pretend its brand is high-quality at zero cost.
■ A low-quality brand that is known to be low-quality earns a combined profit 
in periods 1 and 2 of 10 + 10 = 20.
■ A low-quality brand that pretends to be high-quality earns a profit of 30 in 
period 1. However, in period 2 consumers know from experience the brand 
is actually low quality, so the period 2 profit is 10. The combined profit in 
periods 1 and 2 is 30 + 10 = 40.
Accordingly, it is profitable for low-quality producers to pretend their brands are 
high quality in period 1. The high-quality brand is driven out of the market and 
earns zero profit. In period 2, the same thing happens again. Although the low-
quality brands that existed in period 1 are now perceived by consumers to be low 
quality, new brands appear that are actually low quality but pretend to be high qual-
ity. Again, the high-quality brand is driven out of the market and earns zero profit.
Now suppose producers of either brand can convince consumers their brand 
is high quality in period 1 only by advertising, at a cost of 25. No advertising is 
necessary in period 2 because by then consumers have established for themselves 
the true quality of the brand they purchased in period 1.
■ The producer of a low-quality brand that is not advertised and is known to be 
low quality earns a combined profit in periods 1 and 2 of 10 + 10 = 20, as 
before.
■ The producer of a low-quality brand that is advertised and pretends to be high 
quality earns a profit of 30 - 25 = 5 in period 1. Despite the advertising, in 
period 2 consumers know the brand is actually low quality, so the period 2 
profit is 10. The combined profit in periods 1 and 2 is 5 + 10 = 15.
Accordingly, it is not profitable for producers of low-quality brands to advertise 
and pretend to be high quality in period 1. The producer of the high-quality 
brand, on the other hand, does advertise, and is not driven out of the market. 
The period 1 profit is 25 - 25 = 0. In period 2, however, this producer earns a 
profit of 25. The combined profit in periods 1 and 2 is 0 + 25 = 25.
In the signalling model, it is not the advertising message itself that is effective 
in convincing consumers that the advertised brand is high quality. Rather, the 
simple fact that this brand is being advertised provides the necessary signal of 
high quality. Consumers realise the producer only advertises if it is confident of 
attracting repeat purchases. Similarly, the fact that the low-quality brand is not 
advertised provides a signal of low quality. Consumers realise that if the brand was 
high quality the producer would advertise, therefore the fact that the brand is 
not advertised signals that it is low quality.
[If] the consumer believes that the more a brand advertises, the more likely 
it is to be a better buy . . . in consequence, the more advertisements of a 
brand the consumer encounters, the more likely he is to try the brand.
(Nelson, 1974b, p. 732)

525
It is clear that if high-quality brands advertise more and if advertising 
expenditures are observable (even if not perfectly so), then rational, 
informed consumers will respond positively to advertising even if the ads 
cannot and do not have much direct informational content.
(Milgrom and Roberts, 1986, p. 797)
Costly and wasteful advertisement demonstrates that the advertiser is 
also investing in the quality of the product and a continued relationship 
with customers, because otherwise the costly and wasteful advertising 
would serve no purpose.
(Kay, 2004, p. 217)
Advertising is not necessarily the only method by which producers can send 
signals of quality. Hertzendorf (1993) argues that if price signalling is effective, 
advertising is unnecessary. Advertising is only useful if price does not provide 
consumers with enough information to assess quality. Fluent and Garella (2002) 
develop a theoretical model to examine whether firms use advertising or price to 
signal quality to consumers. They find that advertising is an appropriate signal-
ling device in differentiating products when quality differences are small, but 
price is preferred when quality differences are large. Horstmann and MacDonald 
(2003) suggest advertising is an important tool in informing consumers about 
product quality and characteristics, but as consumer awareness increases, the 
need for advertising should decline. However, data from the US market for com-
pact disc players over the period 1983–92 suggests a tendency for prices to fall 
and advertising intensity to increase over time.
Siegel and Vitaliano (2007) investigate whether producers of experience and 
credence goods spend more on corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies (see 
Section 6.7) than producers of search goods. For experience and credence goods, 
consumers rely on information supplied by the producer regarding product attri-
butes. The hypothesis is that CSR policies are seen by consumers primarily as a 
signal of quality, honesty and reliability. Siegel and Vitaliano identify producers 
of search goods, and producers of experience or credence goods, using the KLD 
database. Firms selling credence services, such as financial services, are 23 per 
cent more likely to be involved in CSR activity than firms selling search goods. 
Firms selling durable experience goods such as electronic equipment are 15 per 
cent more likely to be involved in CSR. Firms selling experience services or non-
durable experience goods are not significantly more likely to be involved in CSR 
activity than producers of search goods.
	
17.7	
Is there too much advertising?
As shown above, advertising is often categorised as either informative or per-
suasive. Informative advertising is widely regarded as useful because it provides 
consumers with information with which they can make more informed choices. 
Persuasive advertising, in contrast, distorts the information consumers receive, 

526	
|	 17    ■    Advertising
making it more difficult for them to make informed choices on the basis of objec-
tive information. Reliable information is a prerequisite for effective competition, 
which ensures resources are used efficiently to produce the goods and services 
that consumers actually want. Persuasive advertising changes the preferences of 
consumers and might even damage competition, if firms that have invested in 
building up brand loyalties exploit their market power by charging higher prices 
and earning abnormal profit.
The traditional view of advertising, expressed by Kaldor (1950), Bain (1956), 
Galbraith (1958, 1967) and Comanor and Wilson (1974), takes a critical view. 
Advertising tends to distort consumer preferences by persuading consumers to 
buy products and services that are heavily promoted.
Most advertising is not informative. The typical Marlboro ad, with 
a cowboy smoking a cigarette, or a Virginia slims ad, or a Budweiser 
beer ad, conveys no credible information concerning the nature of the 
product being sold, the price at which the product is sold, or where 
the product may be obtained. Firms spend money on ads such as these 
because they believe it increases their profit, because such ads have an 
effect on demand curves.
(Stiglitz, 1991, p. 842)
The goal of persuasive advertising is to change customers’ perceptions 
of a product. If persuasive advertising works, it means that a branded 
product is considered in some non-tangible way to be ‘different’ to its 
rivals. If successful, therefore, persuasive advertising may generate 
brand loyalty – customers may be unwilling to switch to competitors’ 
products if they are convinced that their preferred brand offers 
something that no other product would be able to provide.
(Nawaz, 1997, p. 3)
Persuasive advertising interferes with the exercise of innate preferences, 
it alters choices away from the efficient lines that ‘consumer sovereignty’ 
would yield. Thus persuasive image instilling advertising is largely a form 
of economic waste.
(Shepherd, 1997, p. 111)
In one of the most famous critiques of advertising, Kaldor (1950) argues that 
because advertising is supplied jointly with goods and services, consumers are 
forced to pay for advertising they do not want, and are unwilling accomplices in 
a waste of resources. The amount of advertising supplied exceeds that demanded 
because it is provided as a ‘free’ service not only to purchasers, but also to con-
sumers who will never buy the good or service under consideration. Advertisers 
do not charge a positive price for advertising, since to do so would result in less 
advertising being demanded than is required for advertisers to maximise profit. 
Consequently, there is an oversupply of advertising, and a waste of resources that 

	
	
	
17.7  Is there too much advertising?	 |	
527
is financed by consumers who have no choice other than to pay a higher price 
for the advertised goods.
The main criticisms of Kaldor’s argument are as follows:
■ Consumers have a choice between advertised and non-advertised goods. If 
consumers did not buy advertised products, there would be no market for 
advertising (Telser, 1966b).
■ By supplying advertising jointly with goods and services, savings may be 
realised. Collecting separate fees for the provision of information might be 
more expensive than incorporating advertising costs into the price of the prod-
uct or service.
Kaldor’s view is consistent with the underlying assumptions of microeconomic 
theory, in which a consumer with fixed tastes possesses perfect information 
(­Koutsoyannis, 1982). In reality, however, consumers inhabit societies that are 
dynamic by nature. Tastes are socially and culturally conditioned, and are not exog-
enous. Consumers continuously acquire new information from their own experi-
ences and through the media. The static equilibrium methodology used in consumer 
theory, based on assumptions of fixed tastes and perfect information, is therefore 
misleading (Nichols, 1985; Hoschman and Luski, 1988). This view is reinforced by 
the introduction of internet online advertising as opposed to offline advertising and 
thus substantially decreasing the costs of targeting (Goldfarb, 2014).
An alternative view, articulated by Stigler (1961), Telser (1964, 1966a), 
­Littlechild (1982) and Nelson (1974a,b, 1975, 1978), is that advertising provides 
consumers with valuable information, allowing them to make rational choices. 
Under this view, advertising plays a positive role in ensuring the efficient allo-
cation of resources. The extent to which consumers are able to make informed 
choices depends on the knowledge and certainty they have about the attributes 
of products and services. Informed consumers are unlikely to pay higher prices 
for any particular product or service unless ‘real’ differences exist. Becker and 
­Murphy (1993) argue that advertisements should be treated as valuable comple-
ments to the goods they promote, and not as products that distort consumer 
tastes and preferences. In cases where advertisements appear on television and 
radio, these tend to lower consumer utility. However, consumers are compen-
sated for exposure to advertising by the provision of free television and radio pro-
grammes. Advertising does not necessarily reduce utility in all forms of media. 
In media where consumers can easily ignore advertising, such as the print media, 
advertising is more likely to be informative and utility-increasing to consumers.
Evaluation of the welfare effects of advertising is made difficult by the fact 
that persuasive advertising changes consumer tastes and preferences. This means 
there is no consistent standard for making welfare comparisons before and after 
advertising takes place. It may be difficult to determine whether a consumer is 
better or worse off as a result of advertising, if the consumer has a different utility 
function in each case. However, Dixit and Norman (1978) suggest a method for 
avoiding this difficulty. If it can be shown that welfare is increased by advertis-
ing if the assessment is made using pre-advertising consumer preferences, and 
if it can also be shown that welfare is increased if the assessment is made using 

528	
|	 17    ■    Advertising
post-advertising consumer preferences, then it is unambiguous that welfare is 
increased, no matter how the comparison is made.
Dixit and Norman’s analysis for the case of a monopolist is shown in 
­Figure 17.5, drawn on the same assumptions as Figure 17.1. As before, follow-
ing an advertising campaign costing ∆a = a2 - a1, the monopolist’s average 
revenue function shifts from AR(a1) to AR(a2), and the profit-maximizing price 
and quantity shift from P1Q1 to P2Q2. What are the welfare implications of this 
shift? As argued above, there are two possible answers, depending on whether 
pre-advertising or post-advertising preferences are used to make the comparison.
■ Using the pre-advertising demand function AR(a1), the welfare gain from the 
extra production is the area between AR(a1) and MC over the range Q1 to Q2, 
minus the advertising expenditure. The welfare gain is B -∆a. This expression 
could be positive or negative.
■ Using the post-advertising demand function AR(a2), the welfare gain from 
the extra production is the area between AR(a2) and MC over the range Q1 to 
Q2, minus the advertising expenditure. The welfare gain is B + C + D - ∆a. 
This expression could also be positive or negative.
To ascertain whether advertising is always welfare-enhancing if it is also profit-
able, one further assumption concerning Figure 17.5 is introduced at this point: 
it is assumed area D 6 area E. From the construction of Figure 17.5 it is clear 
that for sufficiently small changes in a, the condition D 6 E is very likely to be 
satisfied, and next it is assumed that this is the case.
Figure 17.5  Welfare analysis of an increase in advertising expenditure in monopoly

	
	
	
17.8  Empirical evidence	 |	
529
The gain in monopoly profit resulting from the shift from P1Q1 to P2Q2 is 
B + C + E - ∆a. The monopolist only advertises if B + C + E - ∆a Ú 0, 
which is a necessary (but not a sufficient) condition for B - ∆a 7 0 and (assum-
ing D 6 E) for B + C + D - ∆a 7 0. This means advertising can only be 
­welfare-enhancing if it is also profitable. There cannot be a case in which wel-
fare could be improved by advertising more, but the monopolist fails to increase 
advertising because it is not profitable to do so.
The profit-maximizing monopolist increases its advertising until 
B + C + E - ∆a = 0. Consider the welfare effects of the last unit of advertis-
ing expenditure at the profit-maximizing equilibrium:
■ Using pre-advertising preferences, the welfare effect of the last unit of advertis-
ing expenditure is B - ∆a. If B + C + E - ∆a = 0, B - ∆a must be nega-
tive, because C and E are both positive.
■ Using post-advertising preferences, the welfare effect of the last unit of 
advertising expenditure is B + C + D - ∆a. If B + C + E - ∆a = 0, 
B + C + D - ∆a must be negative, because it is assumed D 6 E.
Therefore, at the profit-maximizing equilibrium, the welfare effect of the last 
unit of advertising expenditure is negative. From a welfare perspective the profit-
maximizing monopolist tends to overspend on advertising, and a small reduction 
in advertising would be welfare-improving. Dixit and Norman show that similar 
results also hold in oligopoly and monopolistic competition.
	
17.8	
Empirical evidence
This section provides a selective review of empirical evidence relating to issues 
raised in this chapter.
Information content and effectiveness of advertising
Based on data from 60 previous studies and over 90,000 advertisements, Aber-
nethy and Franke (1996) report an average number of ‘cues’ of 2.04 per adver-
tisement. Advertising ‘cues’ include information on price, quality, performance, 
component parts or contents, availability, special offers, taste, packaging or 
shape, guarantees or warranties, safety, nutrition, independent research, com-
pany sponsored research and new ideas. Advertisements for durable goods 
provided 35 per cent more cues on average than those for non-durable goods. 
Outdoor advertising and television advertising contain less information than 
magazine and radio advertising. Paton (1998) uses survey data on UK manufac-
turing, service and distribution firms to assess the extent to which advertisements 
incorporate price information. Seventy per cent of the sample included no price 
information in their advertisements. Price information tends to be included in 
advertising more commonly in distribution than in manufacturing and services, 
and when consumers are the end-users of a product or service.

530	
|	 17    ■    Advertising
Advertising and concentration
Most empirical studies of the link between advertising and concentration test for 
the existence of a relationship similar to the one summarised in Figure 17.2. The 
methodology used to test this hypothesis is SCP-based, and accordingly most 
of these studies were published during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Taken as a 
whole, the empirical evidence favouring the hypothesis that advertising inten-
sity should be higher under oligopoly than under either perfect competition or 
monopoly appears to be reasonably strong and convincing (Leahy, 1997).
Some of the earliest studies test for a linear relationship between concentration 
and advertising intensity (Telser, 1964). Many later studies test for a non-linear 
relationship between concentration and advertising intensity (Leahy, 1997). If a 
quadratic functional form is assumed, the specification of the regression equa-
tion is as follows:
aAi
Si
b = a + b1 + b2CRi + b3CRi
2 + ui
where the dependent variable is (Ai/Si), the advertising-to-sales ratio of industry i; 
and the independent variables are linear and quadratic terms in CRi, the industry 
i concentration ratio, or some other suitable industry concentration measure. A 
necessary (but not always sufficient) condition for an inverted U-shaped rela-
tionship between concentration and advertising intensity is b2 7 0 and b3 6 0.
The UK and US evidence from the 1970s and 1980s on the association between 
concentration and advertising intensity is somewhat ambiguous (Cable, 1972; 
Sutton, 1974; Reekie, 1975; Weiss et al., 1983; Buxton et al., 1984). In an interna-
tional study, Lambin (1976) examines the relationship between several variables, 
including price elasticity of demand and concentration, and advertising intensity. 
There is no systematic association between market concentration and advertising 
intensity. Lee (2002) uses a sample of 426 (five-digit) manufacturing industries 
to examine the relationship between advertising and concentration. An inverted 
U-shaped relationship is found for consumer goods industries, but a J-shaped 
relationship is observed in the case of producer goods.
Advertising and profitability
Paton and Vaughan Williams (1999) report a positive relationship between 
advertising expenditures and current and future profitability for a large sample 
of UK firms. Greuner et al. (2000) examine the long-run relationship between 
advertising and profitability for three dominant US car manufacturers (GM, 
Ford and Chrysler). There is little evidence that advertising influenced profit-
ability. Notta and Oustapassidis (2001) examine the relationship between four 
advertising media (television, radio, newspapers and magazines) and profitability 
for a sample of 350 Greek food manufacturing firms. Only television advertising 
appears to increase profitability.
Advertising-to-sales ratios, widely used in many empirical studies, are prone

tions other than advertising, the estimated correlation between concentration,

profitability and advertising may be biased (Lambin, 1976). For diversified firms, 
it can be difficult to assess from company accounts which product lines are being 
heavily advertised. This problem can be tackled using data at the line-of-business 
level. Using US lines-of-business data for 258 industry categories, Ravenscraft 
(1983) finds no relationship between advertising expenditure and profitability.
A few methodological problems arise in empirical studies of the relationship 
between advertising and profitability. First, it is often difficult to determine the 
direction of causation between advertising and profit. Does advertising lead to 
increased profit, or do profitable firms advertise more? Second, size measures 
such as sales, assets and employment are often highly correlated. These measures 
are used in the denominators of both the advertising and profitability measures, 
leading to the possibility that spurious relationships may be identified. Third, 
advertising may be a useful instrument for firms wishing to adjust their reported 
profit for tax reasons. A high profit in any particular year, and the tax liability this 
would create, might be massaged and reduced by spending heavily on advertising. 
Finally, Bloch (1974) argues that advertising expenditures should be treated as 
a capital expenditure and depreciated accordingly, and not as a current expense.
Advertising and market share
In studies of the link between advertising and market share, the main hypothesis 
is that, if advertising promotes competition, the market shares of the top firms 
should be unstable; but if advertising restricts competition the opposite applies 
(Willis and Rogers, 1998). Eckard (1987) reports that as advertising intensity 
increased, the ranking of the largest firms in each industry by market share tended 
to change more frequently and market shares became less stable. This implies sup-
port for the view that advertising promotes competition. Vakratsas (2008) reports 
a positive relationship between advertising expenditures and the variability of the 
market shares of US Sports Utility Vehicle and Minivan producers in the US.
Advertising and product quality
Tellis and Fornell (1988) test for an empirical relationship between advertising 
intensity and product quality. Products are grouped into those at early stages 
(introductory and growth) and those at advanced stages (maturity, decline) of 
the product life cycle. There are strong positive relationships between product 
quality and each of advertising expenditure, market share and profitability for 
products at advanced stages of the product life cycle. Caves and Greene (1996) 
report a positive association between product quality and advertising intensity 
for experience goods and new products, and Thomas et al. (1998) report evidence 
that car producers use advertising expenditures to signal quality.
Advertising and price
One view of the effect of advertising on price is that the prices of advertised goods 
tend to be higher than those of non-advertised goods, due to the higher selling 
costs, and because advertising reduces the price elasticity of demand by inducing 

532	
|	 17    ■    Advertising
brand loyalty (Chioveanu, 2008). Furthermore, producers or retailers that mar-
ket generic or own-brand products at a lower price may attempt to freeride by 
exploiting the information spread by the advertised goods (Porter, 1976). An 
alternative view, implicit in the notion of informative advertising (Stigler, 1961), 
suggests that an informed consumer is better able to select products at a lower 
price for given level of quality. Therefore advertising reduces consumer ignorance 
and increases the price elasticity of demand, resulting in lower prices.
On balance, much of the available empirical evidence suggests advertising 
appears to reduce both the level and the variability of prices. Empirical evidence for 
several professional service industries suggests advertising aids consumer search, 
and enables consumers to make more informed choices (Love and Stephen, 1996). 
However, the price information contained in advertisements produced by service 
sector firms is often low (Paton, 1998; Paton and Vaughan Williams, 1999).

Summary
This chapter has examined the role of advertising in the modern economy. Some 
advertising messages provide useful information about the attributes of the 
products, services or brands they promote, enabling consumers to make more 
informed choices. However, advertising which seeks to persuade consumers of 
the superiority of particular goods by transmitting messages whose truth (or 
otherwise) may be unreliable, or at least not objectively verifiable, may represent 
a waste of resources or may damage competition or reduce welfare. It has been 
shown that the effectiveness of advertising may depend on whether the product’s 
attributes are easily identifiable prior to purchase and consumption (search and 
experience goods), and upon cost and frequency of purchase (convenience and 
shopping goods).
There are good theoretical reasons to expect that the relationship between 
market structure and advertising intensity should have an inverted U-shaped 
appearance. Advertising intensity should be zero under perfect competition, posi-
tive under both oligopoly and monopoly, but larger under oligopoly than under 
monopoly. A monopolist’s only incentive to advertise is to try to increase total 
industry demand, whereas oligopolists have the additional incentive of trying to 
capture market share from one another. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, a 
number of empirical studies based on the structure–conduct–performance para-
digm identified evidence of a relationship of this kind between industry concen-
tration and advertising-to-sales ratios.
Advertising can help raise barriers to entry. An incumbent firm may ben-
efit from an absolute cost advantage in advertising if its past advertising invest-
ment has helped establish name recognition or brand loyalty among consumers. 
Consumer familiarity makes current advertising more effective than it is for an 
entrant attempting to establish a presence in the market for the first time. Econo-
mies of scale in advertising may also make it difficult for small-scale entrants to 
compete effectively with incumbents who are already producing and advertising 
on a large scale.

	
	
	
Discussion questions	 |	
533
The competitive model relies on an assumption of perfect information, but in 
situations where consumers have limited information advertising may play an 
important role in signalling information about product quality. The content of 
advertising messages may be unimportant, but the fact that a producer is pre-
pared to invest in advertising suggests the producer is confident that consumers, 
having made an initial purchase, will return and make repeat purchases.
Some economists believe advertising tends to mislead or distort the truth, and 
is usually wasteful or even damaging. Others argue advertising contributes posi-
tively to the circulation of information through society, and in any event consum-
ers have choices and are not forced to purchase advertised goods if they do not 
wish to do so. Perhaps this debate will never be resolved conclusively. However, 
some of the empirical evidence, at least, seems to suggest that advertising has 
beneficial effects for competition and for consumers. For example: increased 
advertising appears to be associated with rapid turnover in firm-level market 
shares, which suggests competition is effective; advertising seems to increase price 
elasticity of demand as consumers become better informed; and prices appear 
to be lower in markets where advertising is deregulated than in those where 
restrictions exist. All of this is supportive of the view that some, if perhaps not 
all, advertising does play a positive role in transmitting useful information and 
stimulating competition.

Introduction
Technological change can be defined as the introduction of superior qualities to 
products or methods of production, which eventually render existing products or 
production processes obsolete. Invention means the development of new ideas, 
while innovation means the successful application of new ideas. In most stud-
ies of industrial organization, research and development (R&D) undertaken by 
firms is assigned a high level of importance. Technological change affects output, 

536	
|	 18    ■    Research and development
product quality, employment, wages and profits, and is a major driving force 
behind the growth of any economy and the improvement in social welfare.
This chapter begins in Section 18.2 with an examination of the relationship 
between market structure, firm size and the pace of technological change. A 
five-stage classification of the components of a successful R&D programme 
is introduced. Several of the key ideas of Joseph Schumpeter, perhaps still 
the most influential thinker in this area, are examined (see Box 1.1). The 
Schumpeterian hypothesis, that there is an association between innovation 
and monopoly, has provided the motivation for an extensive body of theo-
retical and empirical research. In a well-known contribution, Arrow shows 
that the incentive to innovate is greater under perfectly competitive condi-
tions than it is under a monopoly. Several economists have suggested that 
oligopoly might be the market structure most conducive to a fast pace of 
technological change. The attractions for oligopolists of collusion, coopera-
tive joint ventures and open source technology are examined. Finally, the 
case for a positive association between firm size and the pace of technological 
change is assessed.
Section 18.3 examines the decision to invest in R&D. A distinction is drawn 
between offensive, defensive, imitative and dependent R&D strategies. Like 
any other investment decision, the decision to commit resources to a R&D 
programme can be subjected to investment appraisal analysis. Relevant con-
siderations include the anticipated levels of demand and costs, the marketing 
strategy (in the case of a new product), and the means of financing the research 
programme.
The rate of diffusion measures the pace at which a piece of new technology 
spreads from the original innovating firm to other firms for which the tech-
nology is applicable. Section 18.4 describes the Mansfield model of diffusion, 
which provides a benchmark for measuring and modelling the factors that influ-
ence the pace of diffusion. One such factor is the patenting system, discussed in 
­Section 18.5. Granting a patent to the inventor of a new product, process, sub-
stance or design confers a property right over the knowledge that is embodied 
in the invention. In designing a patenting system, a balance needs to be struck 
between providing sufficient incentives to encourage R&D on the one hand, 
and avoiding excessive monopolization and possible abuses of market power 
on the other.
Finally, Section 18.6 reviews some of the empirical literature on the econom-
ics of R&D, including studies which present evidence on a number of the issues 
covered in this chapter.

Market structure, firm size and the pace  
of technological change
As a process, R&D can be subdivided into several stages. Different economists 
and management scientists have developed their own taxonomies. Probably the 
best known of these, described by Stoneman (1995), is the trichotomy which 

	
	
	
18.2  Market structure, firm size and the pace of technological change 	 |	
537
identifies three stages: invention, innovation and diffusion. This three-stage clas-
sification was first developed by Joseph Schumpeter (1928, 1942). A more exten-
sive five-stage classification is as follows:
■ Basic research. An invention is the creation of an idea and its initial implemen-
tation. Basic research corresponds to the invention stage in the Schumpeterian 
trichotomy. At its extreme, basic research may be carried out without any 
practical application in view. For example, early research in molecular physics 
was carried out without any foreknowledge of the use of the valve in broadcast-
ing and communications. Industrial firms may be reluctant to undertake basic 
research, due to the uncertainty of outcome. Consequently, basic research is 
often the province of government agencies and universities.
■ Applied research. Unlike basic research, applied research has a stated objec-
tive. Following an investigation of the potential economic returns, research 
is undertaken to determine the technological feasibility of the proposed 
application.
■ Development. Generally this can be considered as bringing an idea or invention 
to the stage of commercial production. At this stage, resources are heavily 
committed and pilot plants or prototypes may have to be built. Although it is 
clear that at every stage of R&D the firm must review its progress, it is at the 
development stage that the selection process for the next (commercial produc-
tion) stage is most important. The failure of a new product that has already 
entered into commercial production would be very costly to the organization.
■ Commercial production. This stage refers to the full-scale production of a new 
product or application of a new process. Regardless of the amount of R&D 
already undertaken, there is still a large element of risk and uncertainty. A 
major difference between invention and innovation arises from the level of 
risk: the main interest of the inventor is in the generation of ideas and not the 
production of goods and services on a commercial basis. Together, the applied 
research, development and commercial production stages correspond to the 
innovation stage in the Schumpeterian trichotomy.
■ Diffusion. The final stage refers to the spread of the new idea through the 
firm, as well as the imitation and adoption of the innovation by other firms 
in the same industry, or in other industries where the innovation may be 
applicable. There is also a spatial element to the diffusion process, as ideas 
spread geographically through foreign direct investment, licensing agree-
ments or joint ventures.
A distinction is often drawn between product and process innovation. A prod-
uct innovation involves the introduction of a new product. A process innovation 
involves the introduction of a new piece of cost-saving technology. However, 
the distinction between product and process innovation is not always clear cut. 
New products often require new methods of production, and new production 
processes often alter the characteristics of the final product. Furthermore, one 
firm’s product innovation may be another firm’s process innovation. For exam-
ple, a new piece of capital equipment might be classed as product innovation by 

538

the producing firm, but, from the point of view of the user, the machine would 
represent a process innovation.
Schumpeter and the gale of creative destruction
At several points in this book, it is suggested that monopoly may be associated 
with inefficiency in production. Shielded from the full rigours of competition, the 
monopoly producer may tend to become complacent and fail to produce at the 
lowest attainable average cost. A similar case can be made to suggest that among 
all possible market structures, monopoly may not be the most conducive to a 
rapid pace of technological progress. A complacent monopoly producer that is 
already earning an abnormal profit may feel reasonably content with its existing 
production technology, even if it might be possible for the firm to realise cost 
savings and increase its abnormal profit by investing in R&D.
However, it has also been argued that high levels of seller concentration and 
market power may be associated with a fast pace of technological change. Much 
of the theoretical and empirical analysis of the economics of R&D and innovation 
is based on ideas developed by Schumpeter (1928, 1942), who saw technological 
change as the fundamental driving force behind the growth and development 
of the capitalist economy. Schumpeter coined the term creative destruction to 
describe the economic impact of technological change. The creative aspect of tech-
nological change results in new and improved goods and services being brought to 
market, and more cost-effective technologies being used in production.
The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine 
in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods 
of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of 
industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.
(Schumpeter, 1942, p. 83)
But there is also a destructive aspect to technological change. The introduction 
of new technologies challenges the market power of incumbent firms that remain 
wedded to the older, less effective technologies. The process of creative destruc-
tion simultaneously rewards successful innovators, and punishes those firms 
whose technologies are superseded and become obsolete. The process of creative 
destruction ‘incessantly revolutionises the economic structure from within, inces-
santly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of cre-
ative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism’ (Schumpeter, 1942, p. 83).
Successful innovators are rewarded with market power. For a time, the firm 
becomes a monopoly supplier of the new product; or its mastery of a new process 
enables it to produce at a lower cost than its rivals, and perhaps capture some or 
all of their market share by setting a reduced price that they are unable to match. 
However, the market power conferred by successful innovation is always tempo-
rary, and never permanent. The firm must continually guard against the possibil-
ity that others will encroach into its market by introducing further improvements 
in technology, new sources of supply, or new forms of organization.

Schumpeter claims the textbook neoclassical models of oligopoly and monop-
oly cannot convincingly account for the huge increases in production and con-
sumption that took place during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 
The popular view of large quasi-monopolistic concerns, reducing output in order 
to maximise profit and thereby denying society a higher standard of living, was 
not a credible representation of the reality of modern capitalist economies.
As soon as we go into details and inquire into the individual items 
in which progress was most conspicuous, the trail leads not to the 
doors of those firms that work under conditions of comparatively free 
competition but precisely to the doors of the large concerns which, 
as in the case of agricultural machinery, also account for much of the 
progress in the competitive sector and a shocking suspicion dawns 
upon us that big business may have had more to do with creating that 
standard of life than with keeping it down.
(Schumpeter, 1942, p. 82)
The Schumpeterian analysis has several important implications. Perfect competi-
tion is not the ideal market structure. Large corporations that have acquired mar-
ket power as a result of having been successful innovators in the past are the main 
drivers of technological change and economic growth. Economists should focus 
less on price competition and more on other forms of competition, especially 
product and process innovation. In one remarkable passage, Schumpeter even 
comes close to anticipating the theory of contestable markets by about 40 years:
It is hardly necessary to point out that competition of the kind we now 
have in mind acts not only when in being but also when it is merely an 
ever present threat. It disciplines before it attacks. The businessman 
feels himself to be in a competitive situation even if he is alone in his 
field or if, though not alone, he holds a position such that investigating 
government experts fail to see any effective competition between 
him and any other firms in the same or a neighboring field and in 
consequence conclude that his talk, under examination, about his 
competitive sorrows is all make believe.
(Schumpeter, 1942, p. 85)
The Schumpeterian hypothesis, that there is an association between innova-
tion and monopoly, has provided the motivation for much further theoretical 
and empirical research. Schumpeter’s approach lies beyond the confines of the 
neoclassical theory of the firm and the SCP paradigm, which concentrate on deci-
sions concerning price, output or other conduct variables within a predetermined 
market structure. For Schumpeter, causation lies in the opposite direction. The 
conduct of a successful innovator is rewarded with the creation of a (temporary) 
monopoly based on sole ownership of the intellectual property rights embodied 
in the new technology. Nevertheless, certain theoretical contributions attempt 
to reposition the Schumpeterian hypothesis within a neoclassical framework, by 

540

examining the relationship between market structure and the incentive to invent 
or innovate. Other contributions examine the closely related (but conceptually 
distinct) question of the relationship between firm size and the pace of techno-
logical change.
Case study 18.1
Uber is certainly slick, but it’s not ‘disruptive’
Disruption, says the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, is ‘a disrupted condition, disorder; a 
disrupted part; a rent; a tear’ or ‘the action or an act of disrupting something’. In other 
words, bad news. Over in Silicon Valley, however (and perhaps also in the hipster waste-
lands of Shoreditch), disruption is the holy grail of the tech industry. If you want a venture 
capitalist to get past the second slide in your PowerPoint deck, the word has to appear 
somewhere in the elevator pitch.
Why this obsession with disorder? It all goes back to a book, The Innovator’s Dilemma, 
by Harvard scholar Clayton Christensen, which was published in 1997, just as the first 
internet boom was beginning to build. The subtitle summarises the book’s theme: ‘When 
New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail’. It was a study of how profitable and suc-
cessful companies can sometimes be unhorsed by scrappy upstarts that enter the market 
with novel (or different) technologies that are initially inferior to anything offered by the 
successful incumbents. (Think Kodak and digital photography; Blockbuster and Netflix; 
minicomputers and PCs; BlackBerry and the iPhone.)
These upsets happen, in Christensen’s view, not because successful companies do not 
innovate, but because they only engage in a particular kind of incremental improvement 
that he calls ‘sustaining innovation’, whereas insurgents specialise in ‘disruptive’ innova-
tion, ie technologies with the potential to enable new products and services or to enable 
existing products and services to be delivered in radically new ways. And these insurgents 
often start by attacking a low-rent segment of an incumbent’s market (i.e. one offering 
margins so low as to be beneath an incumbent’s dignity), or a new market that the incum-
bent had failed to notice.
Over the decades, ‘disruptive innovation’ evolved into Silicon Valley’s highest aspira-
tion. (It also fitted nicely with the valley’s attachment to Joseph Schumpeter’s idea about 
capitalism renewing itself in waves of ‘creative destruction’.) And, as often happens with 
soi-disant Big Ideas, Christensen’s insight has been debased by overuse. This, of course, 
does not please the Master, who is offended by ignorant jerks miming profundity by 
plagiarising his ideas.
Which brings us to an interesting article by Christensen and two of his academic col-
leagues in the current issue of the Harvard Business Review. It’s entitled ‘What Is Disruptive 
Innovation?’ and in it the authors explain, in the soothing tones used by great minds when 
dealing with those of inferior intelligence, the essence of Christensen’s original concept. The 
article is eminently readable and cogent, but contains nothing new, so one begins to wonder 
what could be the peg for going over this particular piece of ground. And why now?

And then comes the answer: Uber. Christensen & co are obviously irritated by the val-
ley’s conviction that the car-hailing service is a paradigm of disruptive innovation and so 
they devote a chunk of their article to arguing that while Uber might be disruptive – in the 
sense of being intensely annoying to the incumbents of the traditional taxi-cab industry 
– it is not a disruptive innovation in the Christensen sense, for two reasons.
The first is that disruptive innovations originate in low-rent segments of existing mar-
kets or in entirely new segments. Uber, they point out, did not originate in either of these. 
‘It is difficult to claim that the company found a low-end opportunity: that would have 
meant taxi service providers had overshot the needs of a material number of customers 
by making cabs too plentiful, too easy to use and too clean.’ ‘Neither did Uber primarily 
target non-consumers – people who found the existing alternatives so expensive or incon-
venient that they took public transit or drove themselves instead: Uber was launched in 
San Francisco (a well-served taxi market), and Uber’s customers were generally people 
already in the habit of hiring rides.’
They’re right. Uber is having a big impact on its market and looks like becoming a 
dominant company, but really it’s just a slick implementation of an idea that’s as old as 
eBay – providing a technological platform for putting buyers and sellers in touch with 
one another and taking a cut of the resulting proceeds.
If Uber is not an example of disruptive innovation, what is? Two come immediately 
to mind. One is peer-to-peer lending, an example of an innovation in a market segment 
that up to now has been beneath the dignity of traditional banks. The other is the ‘block-
chain’ technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin; this is an example of 
innovation in a space that didn’t really exist before, but which even the Bank of England 
is beginning to notice. Stay tuned, Professor Christensen.

The pace of technological change: monopoly versus perfect 
competition
Is monopoly more conducive than perfect competition to a high level of effort 
being committed to R&D, or a high level of innovative activity? As suggested 
above, arguments pointing in either direction can be developed. In favour of 
monopoly, firms in highly concentrated industries may earn abnormal profits, 
which can be invested in risky R&D programmes. Firms in highly competitive 
industries may earn only a normal profit, leaving no uncommitted resources 
available to finance speculative investment in R&D. Furthermore, the lack of 
competitive pressure in a monopoly creates an environment of security, within 
which it is possible for the firm to undertake high-risk investment in projects 
whose returns may be uncertain. If the investment succeeds, there is less risk 
of imitation; and if the project fails, there are no rivals waiting to step in and 
take advantage of the firm’s temporary financial difficulties (for example, by 

542	
|	 18    ■    Research and development
initiating a price war at a time when the firm’s ability to sustain losses might be 
diminished). The lack of competitive pressure gives the firm the time and space 
it needs to develop and grow.
On the other hand, and as noted above, in the absence of competitive pressure, 
the managers of a monopoly might become complacent or lazy, or excessive inter-
nal bureaucracy within the firm’s organizational structures might lead to a loss 
of managerial control, or other forms of technical inefficiency (x-inefficiency). 
Another line of reasoning suggests that the probability that a successful product 
or process invention emerges depends upon the number of research teams simul-
taneously working on a similar challenge. In a competitive market, there may be 
more teams competing to be the first to find a solution, and a higher probability 
that at least one team will succeed. Finally, a monopolist that owes its market 
power to a successful past innovation might be tied to its existing technology. 
To switch resources to a new product or process might be considered too costly.
A slightly more subtle variant of this final argument in favour of competition 
points out that if a new piece of technology displaces a monopoly firm’s current 
technology, the monopolist’s incentive to innovate is governed by the net effect 
on its profit. Under a competitive market structure, the incentive to innovate is 
governed by the gross return from the innovation. Accordingly, the incentive to 
innovate may be greater under competition than it is for a monopolist.
This argument is formalised by Arrow (1962) in a widely cited theoretical 
contribution to the debate surrounding the relationship between market structure 
and the pace of technological change. Arrow compares the impact of a cost-
saving process innovation under market structures of perfect competition and 
monopoly. In both cases, constant returns to scale and horizontal LRAC and 
LRMC (long-run average and marginal cost) functions are assumed. The innova-
tion causes a downward shift in the position of the LRAC (= LRMC) function. 
Under perfect competition, it is assumed that the inventor charges each competi-
tive firm a royalty per unit of output for use of the cost-saving technology. The 
inventor’s return is the total value of the royalty payments. Under monopoly, it 
is assumed that the monopoly firm itself is the inventor. The inventor’s return 
is the increase in abnormal (or monopoly) profit realised due to the adoption 
of the cost saving technology. There are two alternative versions of Arrow’s 
analysis, covering the cases where the innovation produces a small reduction and 
a large reduction in the LRAC function. However, both analyses produce the 
same conclusion: that the incentive to invent or innovate is greater under perfect 
competition than it is under monopoly.
Figure 18.1 shows Arrow’s analysis for the case of a small reduction in the 
LRAC function, from LRAC1 to LRAC2.
■ Before the innovation, the monopolist maximises profit by operating at 
(P1, Q1). The monopolist’s abnormal profit is A + B.
■ After the innovation, the monopolist maximises profit by operating at 
(P2, Q2). The monopolist’s abnormal profit is B + C + D + E. Therefore the 
monopolist’s reward for the innovation is (B + C + D + E) - (A + B) =  
C + D + E - A.

■ Before the innovation, the perfectly competitive industry reaches equilibrium 
by operating at (PC, QC). At PC, price equals average cost and normal profits 
are earned. QC represents the combined output of all of the perfectly competi-
tive firms.
■ The maximum royalty per unit of output the inventor can charge for use of 
the technology is given by the amount of the cost saving, LRAC1 - LRAC2. 
Therefore, from the viewpoint of the perfectly competitive firms, nothing 
changes. Before the invention they incur a production cost of LRAC1 per 
unit of output. After the invention they incur a production cost (per unit) 
of LRAC2, and a royalty payment of LRAC1 - LRAC2, so effectively their 
average cost is LRAC1. The industry equilibrium remains at (PC, QC) and the 
inventor’s total royalty payment is D + E + F.
■ To show that the reward for the innovation is greater under perfect competition 
than it is under monopoly, the condition D + E + F 7 C + D + E - A, or 
F + A - C 7 0, is required. To demonstrate this condition it is sufficient 
to show A - C 7 0. Note that A + B is the largest rectangle that can be 
constructed within the triangle formed by the market demand function and 
LRAC1 (A + B being constructed by setting MR = LRAC1). 
Therefore 
A + B 7 B + C 1 A 7 C 1 F + A - C 7 0 1 D + E + F 7 C + D +
E - A.
Figure 18.2 shows Arrow’s analysis for the case where the shift from LRAC1 to 
LRAC2 represents a large saving in average costs.

■ Before the innovation, the monopolist maximises profit by operating at 
(P1, Q1). The monopolist’s abnormal profit is A.
■ After the innovation, the monopolist maximises profit by operating at (P2, Q2). 
The monopolist’s abnormal profit is B. Therefore the monopolist’s reward for 
the innovation is B - A.
■ Before the innovation, the perfectly competitive industry reaches equilibrium 
by operating at (P3, Q3). At P3, price equals average cost and normal profits 
are earned. Q3 is the combined industry output.
■ The inventor maximises the royalty payment by setting the charge for use of 
the technology in such a way as to force the perfectly competitive industry to 
operate as if it were a monopolist. This implies the royalty per unit of output 
should be set at P2 - LRAC2 (so that MR = LRMC2). After the innovation, 
the perfectly competitive firms incur a production cost (per unit) of LRAC2, 
and a royalty payment of P2 - LRAC2, so effectively their average cost is P2. 
The industry equilibrium shifts to (P2, Q2), the firms continue to earn normal 
profits, and the inventor’s total royalty payment is B.
■ In this case, it is obvious that the reward for the invention under perfect com-
petition is greater than the reward under monopoly, because B 7 B - A.
Arrow’s analysis is criticised by Demsetz (1969). Because the pre-innovation 
output levels of the perfectly competitive industry and the monopoly are differ-
ent, Arrow fails to compare like with like. Arrow’s comparison tends to favour 
the perfectly competitive industry because the benefits of the cost-saving tech-
nology are spread over a larger volume of output than in the monopoly case. In 
order to make a fair comparison, the usual tendency for a monopolist to produce

less output than a perfectly competitive industry should be set aside. Instead, the 
comparison should be based on an assumption that the pre-innovation output 
levels are the same under both market structures. To achieve this effect, it is nec-
essary to assume that the market demand function differs between the two cases. 
Kamien and Schwartz (1970) argue that a fair comparison between the incen-
tives for innovation under perfect competition and monopoly should be based 
on a starting position at which not only the industry output levels, but also the 
price elasticities of demand, are the same. In the cases examined by Demsetz and 
Kamien and Schwartz, the incentive for innovation is stronger under monopoly 
than under perfect competition.
The pace of technological change: oligopoly
So far it is clear that there is no unequivocal answer to the question as to which 
of the two extreme market structures (monopoly or perfect competition) most 
favours high levels of R&D activity, high levels of innovation, and a fast pace of 
technological change. Some economists have suggested that the correct answer to 
this question is ‘neither’, and that oligopoly is the market structure most condu-
cive to rapid technological change. Accordingly, an inverted U-shaped relation-
ship between seller concentration and the level of inventive or innovative activity 
might be expected.
■ In perfect competition, abnormal profit is zero. Competitive firms may not 
have the means to invest in risky or speculative programmes. Furthermore, 
they might not have much incentive, unless competition dictates that such 
investment is a necessary condition for minimizing costs and remaining in 
business.
■ In monopoly, abnormal profit is positive, so a monopolist has the means to 
invest in research if it chooses. But a lack of competition may create little 
incentive to do so.
■ In oligopoly, abnormal profit may be positive (depending on the precise form 
of competition that develops, given the firms’ situation of rivalry and interde-
pendence). There is also competitive pressure: the firms’ recognition of their 
interdependence suggests that they perceive competition as being especially 
keen. Therefore, oligopolists have both the means and the incentive to invest 
in R&D. R&D is one discretionary channel (advertising being another) for the 
firms’ competitive rivalry, which does not entail potentially destructive price 
competition.
The arguments for an inverted U-shaped relationship between concentration 
and the levels of inventive or innovative activity are of course very similar to 
those that suggest a similar relationship between concentration and advertising 
intensity (see Section 17.4).
It is important to note that the pace of technological progress may depend 
not only on firms’ decisions on whether to embark on R&D, but also on the 
speed at which these programmes are implemented. In an oligopoly in which 
interdependence is recognised, speed may have a critical influence on the success 

546	
|	 18    ■    Research and development
or failure of a research project. If the research proceeds too slowly, a rival firm 
might develop a similar idea sooner and take out a patent. If the firm moves too 
fast and takes insufficient care to protect itself from imitation, it might fail to 
appropriate the benefits from its own investment.
Scherer (1967) develops a model which makes explicit the speed or time dimen-
sion involved in the firm’s R&D decision. The model is illustrated in Figure 18.3. 
The curved function C represents the trade-off between development time (shown 
on the horizontal axis) and cost (vertical axis). A research programme can be 
implemented at a slow and leisurely pace, or at a fast pace, or at various speeds 
in-between. By increasing the pace and aiming for a shorter development period, 
the firm incurs costs for the following reasons:
■ Over a short development period, research activity may be subject to the Law 
of Diminishing Returns. Hiring more scientists may produce diminishing mar-
ginal returns if the quantity of equipment or the size of the laboratory is fixed 
in the short run. Diminishing returns may set in if the firm is obliged to recruit 
from a finite pool of properly qualified or fully trained research staff.
■ Errors are likely to occur if researchers move from one stage of the research 
to the next without waiting for detailed results from tests or experiments at 
earlier stages.
■ In order to generate results quickly, researchers may pursue several alterna-
tive research paths simultaneously, in the hope that one or more will deliver 
results. Costly effort is devoted to ideas that eventually fail to materialise.
■ A slower pace of development implies a smaller up-front cost, as the total 
cost of the research is spread over a longer development period. Accordingly, 
due to the effects of discounting future values to calculate a present value, the 
longer the development period, the smaller the present value of the total cost.
In Figure 18.3, the function B represents the relationship between the develop-
ment time and the benefit the firm receives from the innovation. B is negatively 
Figure 18.3  The optimal development time

	
	
	
18.2  Market structure, firm size and the pace of technological change 	 |	
547
sloped for two reasons. First, early completion of the project maximises the 
firm’s first-mover advantage, and maximises the period before rivals catch up 
by developing their own alternative technologies. The benefit function B attains 
a value of zero at development time TMAX because, if the firm delays for too 
long, allowing all its rivals to precede it in introducing comparable innovations, 
it may receive no benefit from the research. (In contrast, the cost function C is 
tapered, because the present value of the future costs is non-zero and positive, 
however far ahead in the future the costs are incurred.) Second, earlier comple-
tion implies the benefits are less heavily discounted. As with costs, the present 
value of the benefits varies inversely with the duration of the development period, 
due to the discounting effect. The profit-maximizing firm selects the optimum 
development time, at which the slope of the benefits function equals the slope of 
the cost function, maximizing vertical distance between B and C in Figure 18.3. 
A development time of T1 is chosen.
The shape of the cost function C is determined by the nature of technology, 
but the slope of the benefit function B is determined by market structure. In 
­Figure 18.4, the benefit functions B1, B2 and B3 represent monopoly, oligopoly 
and perfect competition, respectively. The relative slopes of B1, B2 and B3 are deter-
mined by the competition the innovating firm faces under each market structure:
■ Under monopoly there are no competitors, so the innovating firm reaps the full 
benefit regardless of the development time. The discounting of future benefits 
to obtain a present value creates a negative relationship between the develop-
ment time and the present value of the benefit. This value is not affected by 
the risk that rivals will introduce comparable innovations if the development 
is delayed.
■ Under oligopoly the innovating firm worries about the actions of its rivals. The 
number of competitors is small and entry barriers are significant, although not 
insurmountable. Delay will not necessarily reduce the benefit to the innovating 
firm to zero: with only a small number of competitors, it is unlikely that any of 
Figure 18.4  Market structure and the optimal development time

548	
|	 18    ■    Research and development
the firm’s rivals will produce a similar innovation immediately. But the longer 
the delay, the more likely it is that one or more of them will do so.
■ Finally, under perfect competition there are many competitors and no entry 
barriers. In this case, speed is crucial. It is very likely that one or more competi-
tor firms is already working on a similar idea. The first firm to bring the idea 
to fruition captures most of the benefit, so there is a steep negative relationship 
between development time and the present value of the benefit.
Figure 18.4 has been constructed so as to produce an inverted U-shaped rela-
tionship between seller concentration and the pace of technological change. Under 
monopoly, the benefit curve B1 produces a relatively long profit-­maximizing 
development time of T1. Under oligopoly, the steeper benefit curve B2 produces 
a shorter development time of T2. Finally, under perfect competition, the ben-
efit curve B3 is so steep that it fails to exceed the cost curve C at any value of T. 
In this case, there is no investment at all in R&D. Accordingly, technological 
change proceeds at the fastest pace under oligopoly, at an intermediate pace 
under monopoly, and at the slowest pace under perfect competition.
This analysis can be criticised on the grounds that the theorizing underlying 
Figure 18.4 is intuitive, and is not based on any explicit model of conduct under 
alternative market structures. ‘[T]he results of this theoretical research are sensi-
tive to the assumptions made, and with the appropriate constellation of assump-
tions, virtually anything can be shown to happen’ (Scherer, 1992, p. 1419). For 
example, in a market containing one dominant firm and one small firm, the 
dominant firm faces a benefit curve similar to B1, provided the small firm does 
not attempt to innovate. If the small firm does innovate, the dominant firm risks 
losing its position unless it quickly follows. Therefore the dominant firm’s benefit 
curve shifts to something similar to B2, and the dominant firm responds quickly 
by imitating the small firm’s innovation. Netscape’s initial success in developing 
the first internet browser proved to be short-lived once Microsoft, the dominant 
firm, launched its own rival product.
The pace of technological change: firm size
The Schumpeterian hypothesis is often interpreted in terms of an association 
between market structure and the pace of technological change. However, this 
hypothesis is also consistent with the idea that only large firms have the resources 
to implement the large-scale R&D that is required to generate ideas for new prod-
ucts and processes, and to develop these ideas so that they can be implemented 
commercially. In a series of books and articles published during the 1950s and 
1960s, Galbraith (1958, 1967) argued more explicitly that large firms were mainly 
responsible for driving the process of technological change.
Thus mention has been made of machines and sophisticated technology. 
These require in turn, heavy investment of capital. They are designed 
and guided by technically sophisticated men. They involve, also, a 
greatly increased elapse of time between any decision to produce and the 
emergence of a saleable product. From these changes come the need and 

	
	
	
18.2  Market structure, firm size and the pace of technological change 	 |	
549
the opportunity for the large business organization. It alone can deploy 
the requisite capital; it alone can mobilise the requisite skills. It can also 
do more. The large commitment of capital and organization well in 
advance of result requires that there be foresight and also that all feasible 
steps be taken to insure that what is foreseen will transpire. It can hardly 
be doubted that General Motors will be better able to influence the world 
around it – the prices and wages at which it buys and the prices at which 
it sells – than a man in suits and cloaks.
(Galbraith, 1967, p. 4)
The argument that technological change is most likely to be driven by large firms 
rather than small firms or independent inventors is based mainly on economies 
of scale or scope in R&D, or in adjacent functions such as finance.
■ Modern research and laboratories are expensive to build, equip and staff. A 
large firm operates at the scale required to justify the purchase of sufficiently 
specialised equipment, or the hiring of specialist staff. If there is a minimum 
efficient scale (MES) for cost-effective R&D, the small firm might be unable 
to attain the required threshold.
■ A large firm can spread risk over several projects, reducing the damage to the 
firm that the failure of any one project might cause. In contrast, a small firm 
might be forced to place all its eggs in one basket, and bear the risk that the 
failure of the project could cause the firm’s closure.
■ For a large diversified firm, knowledge acquired from research in one area 
might have applications in other areas. For a small specialised firm, such 
economies of scope might not be available.
■ Because investment in R&D is highly risky, it might be necessary to rely heav-
ily on internally generated finance, rather than finance raised from capital 
markets. A large firm might have larger internal cash flows than a small firm. 
If capital markets are efficient, external finance might provide a solution for 
a small firm lacking the financial resources to develop a promising idea. How-
ever, in practice the small firm might still face a disadvantage: the large firm 
might be able to borrow more cheaply because it is perceived to be less risky, 
or due to its reputation. Alternatively, a group of small firms might attempt 
to collaborate in a joint research venture. But in this case transaction costs 
might arise in negotiating an agreement or monitoring compliance.
The counter-argument that technological progress is more likely to originate 
from outside the confines of large corporations is based on the idea that large 
organizations discourage creative or original thinking. An employee with a bright 
idea might find it difficult to appropriate the commercial rewards; or the bureau-
cratic nature of large organizations tends to reward behaviour that conforms 
with institutional norms, discouraging creativity, originality or non-conformity.
The empirical evidence for a positive association between firm size and the 
level of inventive or innovative activity is not particularly strong, and in some 
cases it may point in the opposite direction. In a widely cited study covering 

550	
|	 18    ■    Research and development
61 major inventions from the period 1900–56, Jewkes et al. (1969) find that the 
majority emanated from small private inventors, rather than the research depart-
ments of large firms. However, this finding is not necessarily inconsistent with 
the Schumpeterian view. Examining EU data, the EU Innobarometer (2015) 
finds that the larger the company the more likely it is to have introduced new 
technology. Forty-one per cent of companies with 1-9 employees introduced 
new ­products, whereas 72 per cent of those employing 250 plus employees did 
so. While private inventors might be successful as originators of new and origi-
nal ideas, the resources of large firms might still be required to carry out the 
­development work to bring these ideas to commercial fruition.
Collusion and cooperation
Price competition tends to reduce the profits of all of the firms in an oligopolistic 
market, and oligopolists may attempt to avoid direct competition on price. To 
the extent that discretionary expenditure on advertising and R&D represents a 
form of non-price competition, it is natural to ask whether there is a tendency for 
oligopolists to collude, either tacitly or explicitly, to avoid wasteful and mutually 
damaging competition in these areas as well.
Firms may choose to cooperate over R&D projects for several reasons. First, 
cooperation may help reduce spillover effects. Spillovers arise because some firms 
find it difficult to appropriate all of the benefits of their R&D investments. There 
is always a possibility that the new technology will also benefit rival firms. Second, 
economies of scale might be realised through cooperation, such as the joint financ-
ing of projects. Third, cooperation may generate various synergies when firms are 
working along similar lines of research. Finally, firms in a technologically driven 
environment face greater uncertainty and complexity, which may require a greater 
range of capabilities beyond the core competences of a single firm. Rather than 
attempting the internalization of more capabilities, firms may seek to pool their 
capabilities through cooperative ventures (Caloghirou et al., 2003; Sena, 2004).
In an oligopoly comprising a small number of firms, it may be quite simple to 
agree a common price, but more difficult to determine an optimal level of R&D 
activity. The implications of a price agreement for sales and profitability may be 
simple to predict; in contrast, the consequences of R&D cannot easily be fore-
seen in advance. Prices are visible and transparent, so monitoring and punishing 
non-compliance is relatively straightforward. R&D is complex and opaque, so 
monitoring and enforcement may be more difficult.
If a price agreement breaks down, the long-run consequences may be relatively 
minor. If a R&D agreement breaks down, those firms that have already invested 
heavily tend to suffer more than those that have made a smaller commitment. If 
one firm is selected to carry out the research on the others’ behalf, the others run 
the risk of subsequently being excluded from ownership of the property rights. If 
the research turns out to have more far-reaching applications than were originally 
envisaged, the firm that undertook the original research might attempt to capture 
all of the unanticipated benefits for itself. If the research effort is shared, it may be 
difficult to achieve coordination; and, given the numbers of firms involved, some 
firms may attempt to freeride, allowing others to do most of the work.

	
	
	
18.2  Market structure, firm size and the pace of technological change 	 |	
551
Nevertheless, despite the difficulties, cooperative R&D ventures do happen. 
Some agreements cover the pre-competitive stage, where firms share basic sci-
entific or technical knowledge, but continue to compete as suppliers of products 
based on this knowledge. In other agreements, cooperation is extended to cover 
the firms’ activities as suppliers to the product’s ultimate buyers (Hagedoorn, 
2002). Different institutional and social environments lead to different levels of 
commitment. For example, it has been suggested that the less heavily regulated 
UK labour market is more conducive than the more heavily regulated German 
labour market to initiating joint ventures (Love and Roper, 2004; Malerba, 2007).
D’Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988) find little evidence to suggest that coop-
eration over R&D that aims to eliminate wasteful duplication has any adverse 
consequences in the form of lost output through the creation of quasi-monopolies. 
Therefore, the liberal attitudes of most governments to joint R&D ventures appear 
to be justified. Baumol (2001) takes a similar view, suggesting that with a few 
exceptions the wider social benefits of joint research usually outweigh the costs.
Open source technology
The open source movement is based on principles that are in marked contrast to 
the usual business practice of guarding intellectual property by means of copy-
right and patents. Open source technology is made freely available to anyone who 
wishes to use it, under the condition that any further improvements or refine-
ments developed by users are also made freely available to all other users. Well- 
known open source products include the Linux operating system for computers, 
and the Wikipedia online encyclopaedia. The core principle is that cooperation 
should lead to continual improvement and refinement. Despite the absence of 
copyright and patenting, open source appears to be capable of generating inno-
vative, reliable and low-cost technological progress. In the debate surrounding 
the relationship between firm size and the pace of technological change, open 
source represents an extreme challenge to the view that only the research depart-
ments of large firms have the capability to generate viable new ideas for com-
mercial implementation.
The open source movement raises several interesting questions for economists 
(Lerner and Tirole, 2002, 2005; Lerner et al., 2006). In the case of computer pro-
gramming, why should programmers devote effort to the production of public 
goods, for which they receive no direct monetary remuneration? One possibility 
is that programmers obtain direct benefits (bug fixing or customization) for their 
own organizations from solving a problem that has arisen with an open source 
program. Another possibility is that programmers derive enjoyment or satisfac-
tion from tackling and solving open source problems, which may be more inter-
esting or challenging than their routine work. In the long run, a contribution to 
the development of open source projects may benefit a programmer profession-
ally, by signalling talent to prospective employers or venture capital financiers. 
Alternatively, some programmers might be motivated by the desire for peer rec-
ognition from other programmers, rather than by prospective monetary reward.
Open source offers several other advantages. Open source projects benefit by 
obtaining free programmer training from schools and universities. In contrast,

Case study 18.2
Four-seat DIY car aims to speed up industry 
disruption
FT
The car industry is tormented by how new rivals are coming in and upending the exist-
ing ways of doing business — whether that’s Tesla, Google or Apple. OSVehicle will on 
Tuesday launch its latest ‘do-it-yourself car’ — an electric four-seater that it says can be 
built in little over an hour from parts shipped in flatpacks from Italy and China. The kit 
is aimed at companies that want to sell electric vehicles or run car sharing schemes, with 
would-be carmakers buying a platform from OSVehicle rather than a complete product. 
They order the chassis, electric power-train, suspension, steering system and wheels from 
OSVehicle. Customers then create the bodywork to their own design. ‘It lowers the bar-
riers to entry for start-ups and entrepreneurs who want to create vehicles in a whole new 
segment of the industry,’ said Carlo De Micheli, head of innovation at OSVehicle. The kit 
car platform is based on another by OSVehicle that is a two-seater called Tabby.
The company has yet to decide on the price of the four-seater platform. The two-seater 
iteration of its Tabby platform retailed at $4,000, excluding the lithium-based battery 
pack. The ‘OS’ in OSVehicle stands for open source and the company is part of a growing 
trend of transparent innovation in the industry. Tesla, for instance, made all its patents 
public a year ago, partly in an attempt to fuel the creation of electric vehicles and create a 
bigger market for its premium zero-emission saloons. Other, mainstream carmakers such 
as Ford and Toyota have followed.
‘Companies that are entering this market are focusing on specific technologies, such as 
self-driving or high power electric vehicles,’ said Mr De Micheli. June 2014: Tesla Motors 
owners of proprietary code have to train their own programmers in-house. Sup-
pliers of proprietary software cannot easily allow users to modify and customise 
their code for the user’s own purposes. Because of the tendency for commercial 
firms to hide the visibility of their key employees from the outside world, it may 
be difficult for these staff to signal their talents to the outside labour market. This 
may create disincentive effects.
Although there have been attempts to develop open source projects in other 
fields, such as medical research and online publishing, there may be limits to the 
application of the open source model. Manufactured products require less intel-
lectual or knowledge-based inputs and more physical capital and labour inputs 
than software programming. Therefore, the open source model may not be appli-
cable. The altruistic tendencies of contributors to open source software might 
derive partly from a personal or sociopolitical stance against the dominant soft-
ware firms, which may not exist in other fields. Finally, the open source model 
works best in the field of incremental research, and is less capable of generating 
revolutionary or first generation innovations.

has said it will not sue rivals who use its patents to develop mass-market electric cars. The 
FT discusses whether its chief executive Elon Musk has made the right move. ‘We are 
eager to see all the open source components that come out of their research . . . adopted 
by other companies worldwide.’
OSVehicle launched its first model in 2013 and has partners in Modena, the Italian 
home of sports carmakers Ferrari and Maserati. Current projects based on OSVehicle’s 
Tabby platform include city cars, a luxury electric vehicle, and a concept car made of 
engineered wood. OSVehicle’s platform seeks to address several failings of the industry — 
namely, the slow proliferation of electric vehicles — while capitalising on some of the 
other mega-trends shaping transport, such as the growth of car sharing.
The concept of a DIY car is not new, having been around since the early days of the 
car. But these tend to be one-offs made by sports car enthusiasts, while OSVehicle is aim-
ing for the mass market. One of the earliest applications of the four-seater version from 
OSVehicle will be in Bordeaux, where the Aquitaine region is working on a rental vehicle 
aimed at tourists.

Investment in research and development
Research and development strategies
In many cases, the decision to invest in R&D is strategic and is not determined 
exclusively by considerations of short-run profit maximization. Freeman and 
Soete (1997) discuss a number of strategic issues that may inform or influence 
this investment decision.
Offensive strategy
An offensive strategy seeks to enable a firm to dominate its market through the 
introduction of new technology. The main focus is to generate new ideas and 
protect these ideas and associated spin-offs by acquiring patents. The firm typi-
cally invests heavily in capital equipment and in developing the human capital of 
its research workers. Major twentieth-century innovations that were originally 
developed in this manner include DuPont’s development of nylon (in 1928) and 
lycra (in 1959), IG Farben’s development of PVC (in 1929), and RCA’s devel-
opment of colour television (in 1954). The firm might invest in basic research 
but not of the purest type. To stay ahead of actual or potential competitors, 
the firm undertakes some developmental work, and it requires a capability to 
design, build and test prototypes and pilot plants. Furthermore, a key element of 
Microsoft’s innovation strategy is to ensure that new products are accompanied 
by investment in customer education.

554	
|	 18    ■    Research and development
Defensive strategy
For some firms, investment in R&D may be necessary for survival, to keep pace 
with product improvements or technical change in production processes initiated 
by competitors. If it does nothing, the firm’s market share could collapse if rivals 
are offering more advanced products or are able to sell at a lower price because 
their costs are lower. A firm that adopts a defensive strategy follows the lead set 
by a rival whose strategy is offensive. The defensive firm may lack the technical 
resources needed to pursue an offensive strategy, or it may be risk averse, preferring 
to invest only in proven products or processes. A defensive strategy may include 
efforts to introduce small improvements to existing technologies, permissible 
within the constraints of patents. Defensive firms must have sufficient technical 
resources to be able to respond quickly to new ideas generated by offensive firms.
Imitative strategy
Unlike the defensive firm, the imitator does not attempt to improve on the inno-
vations of the offensive firm. Instead it is content to copy, by acquiring a licence 
in the short run or exploiting free knowledge in the long run. Investment in tech-
nical resources is relatively low, but for an imitative strategy to be profitable the 
imitator must have some advantage that it can exploit, such as cheap labour or a 
captive market. As well as increased competition from alternative products, such 
as Orlon, Dacron and nylon, a major reason for DuPont’s withdrawal from the 
US rayon market in 1960 was its inability to compete with low-cost producers. 
Imitators might have access to captive markets, such as their own subsidiaries or 
other markets that are protected by political patronage or tariff barriers. In some 
countries, governments actively seek to encourage imitation, in order to exploit 
technologies that have been developed elsewhere.
Dependent strategy
A firm that adopts a dependent strategy adopts a subservient role in relation to 
stronger offensive or defensive firms, perhaps as a supplier or subcontractor. 
Dependent firms do not themselves initiate R&D. They adopt technologies that 
are handed to them, often as a condition for preserving the relationship. A new 
technology might be accompanied by technical assistance, the loaning of skilled 
labour, or other forms of assistance or support. This type of relationship is com-
mon in the Japanese electronics and car industries. A dependent relationship may 
sometimes be a precursor towards full vertical integration, especially if the domi-
nant firm sees this as necessary to protect its investment in the relevant technology.
Investment appraisal of research and development projects
Often, it is clear how a firm should apportion its R&D budget. In small firms, 
the direction of research often reflects the aspirations of the owner or technical 
director. In industries where the direction of technological change is clear, it 
may be straightforward for individual firms to decide the direction their research 
expenditures should take. However, for firms with large R&D budgets and no

555
obvious technological priorities, there may be an element of discretion. Perhaps 
the main difference between investment in the replacement of capital goods and 
investment in R&D lies in the level of uncertainty attached to the latter. The risk 
attached to research effort is neither repetitive nor measurable and is therefore 
unlikely to be insurable. The risk tends to be less for research into the application 
and modification of established technology than for basic research and radical 
product or process development. This sub-section examines the main factors that 
need to be considered in the investment appraisal decision.
Demand
Perhaps the most important issue is whether the new idea meets an unsatisfied 
market demand. ‘Demanding and adventurous consumers drive innovation by 
providing firms with incentives to enter new markets and creating pressures on 
firms to improve their products and services’ (Department for Innovation, Uni-
versities and Skills, 2008, p. 16). A large proportion of R&D is stimulated by 
requests for product or process improvement from users (Saha, 2007). Advances 
in mobile telephone technology have been driven by consumer demand for a 
wide variety of handset types and styles. The strength of competition from other 
incumbents or potential entrants might be another important factor.
Assessment of the growth potential of the relevant market might involve long-
range forecasting, which can be highly speculative. Alternatively, the Delphi 
technique, developed by the RAND Corporation in the late 1960s, is based on 
the assessments of a number of experts or specialists. Individuals drawn from 
various fields of expertise are asked to present opinions as to the future of a 
market. Each opinion is circulated to all members of the group, who are then 
asked to reconsider their original opinions. Through a process of iteration, an 
expert consensus is eventually reached. For example, the Taiwanese informa-
tion technology sector is said to have reorganised itself using this method. The 
Delphi technique assumes that a collective consensus is better than the views 
of one individual. This may not always be the case. An alternative approach to 
technological forecasting is trend extrapolation, using historical sales data to 
forecast future developments. This method is based on an assumption that the 
parameters remain the same in the future as they were in the past. Over a 10- or 
20-year forecast period this may be a dangerous assumption.
Almost every major innovation in [electronics and synthetic materials] 
was hopelessly underestimated in its early stages, including polyethylene, 
PVC and synthetic rubber in the material field, and the computer, the 
transistor, the robot and numerical control in electronics.
(Freeman and Soete, 1997, p. 249)
Costs
Since the full costs of development projects are often uncertain and spread over 
relatively long durations, it is difficult to produce reliable cost estimates. The 
uncertainty can be reduced by concentrating on less speculative projects, but the 
likelihood of error remains high.

556	
|	 18    ■    Research and development
Those firms who speak of keeping development cost estimating errors 
within a band of plus or minus 20 per cent are usually referring to a 
type of project in which technical uncertainty is minimal, for example, 
adapting electronic circuit designs to novel applications, but well within 
the boundaries of existing technology.
(Freeman and Soete, 1997, p. 246)
Accordingly, there is a high variance attached to cost estimates for innovations 
involving anything more than a straightforward application of existing technol-
ogy. Furthermore, there is a common tendency to underestimate costs, perhaps 
to a greater extent than with other types of investment. Particular interest groups 
within an organization might deliberately underestimate (or overestimate) costs 
in an attempt to influence the likelihood of a project being adopted, or at least 
allow their assessment to be clouded by their own interests.
Under the general heading of costs, a firm needs to evaluate the demands 
placed on its production capabilities when considering investment in the devel-
opment of a new product or process. Does the firm have the capacity, capital, 
trained staff and technical expertise required to see the project through? Does 
a new technology require new inputs, involving the firm in new and unfamiliar 
supply relationships? Will the production of a new product be hindered by a 
capacity constraint, or is the idea of developing the product motivated by a need 
to exploit spare capacity that already exists?
Marketing
Several issues should be considered when devising a marketing strategy for a new 
product. Can the firm exploit its own reputation to promote a new product? Conser-
vatism or suspicion on the part of consumers may disadvantage a new firm attempt-
ing to market a new product. Does the new product have distinctive marketable 
features? If the idea is too complex for consumers to understand, the market may 
never develop. Does the firm have well-developed distribution channels or dealer 
networks, through which the new product can be promoted? The alternative is to 
rely on independent distributors, who may need to be persuaded or prised away 
from existing suppliers. Finally, what pricing strategy might be required to overcome 
consumer inertia or resistance? Leibenstein (1950) discusses a taboo effect, such that 
consumers are reluctant to buy a product until a large number of other consumers 
have already done so. In this case it might be necessary to charge a loss-making 
price, or perhaps even give the product away, in order to break the taboo. During 
the early days of satellite TV in the UK, BSkyB gave away satellite dishes to encour-
age take-up of its subscription TV services. If there are switching costs, the task for 
a competitor seeking to break into the market subsequently becomes much harder.
Financing research and development projects
The returns from investment in R&D are uncertain and difficult to estimate. The 
manager initiating the research may have more information as to the likely suc-
cess of the project than the financier. Therefore it may be difficult to raise finance 

	
	
	
18.3  Investment in research and development	 |	
557
externally, and internally generated funds may be required. Consequently, 
research is often underfunded (Bougheas et al., 2003). For larger firms the ven-
ture capital market exists to fill this gap, providing external finance for risky 
projects. Since innovation generates public benefits such as economic growth, 
employment, consumption and infrastructure, government may become active in 
supplying funds, training, and access to expertise to the private sector. It has been 
argued that government support is often essential for the successful commercial-
ization of innovation, though this is controversial (Mazzucato, 2013; Mingardi, 
2015). Venture capital plays an important role in supporting innovation, and in 
risk management, for many large firms; and is a significant driver of performance 
(Gompers and Lerner 2001). In comparisons of the performance of UK and US 
venture funds, Nesta (2013) finds a significant gap in favour of the US, attributed 
to differences in the start-up environment, regulation, business culture, the talent 
pool and access to information. The rest of this section examines the private and 
public sources of R&D funding for SMEs and large firms.
Own sources and local banks
Initially, many SMEs rely on the owner’s savings, as well as those of family 
and friends. Personal funding is typically used for the initial start-up, rather 
than project development. Owners may also draw on external funding from 
banks, in the form of overdrafts or loans specifically tailored for small R&D 
projects. In the UK the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS, 
2015a) reports that nearly 70 per cent of SMEs applied for either bank loans or 
overdrafts. Grants accounted for 12 per cent, and leasing and hire purchase a 
further 9 per cent.
Private equity investors and ‘crowdfunding’
Once the project has commenced and the business is sufficiently well established 
to be perceived as less risky than a start-up, the owner might wish to attract third-
party investment in return for shares in the company. Alternatively ­crowdfunding, 
organised online, involves the creation of a parallel equity market, which attracts 
many investors who invest small sums in return for a stake in the project, which 
may increase or decrease in line with the success of the business. Different crowd-
funding models reflect the underlying risk. When risk is high, funding might rely 
on non-equity rewards. Under an ‘all-or nothing’ model, the project is cancelled 
if an insufficient number of investors is attracted, and the money is returned. 
This model can be subject to a bandwagon effect, whereby the ability to attract 
new investors depends on the number of committed investors. Under a ‘keep-
it-all’ model, the owners do not return the money if the project is cancelled. 
Other crowdfunding models include ‘donation funding’, where the donor expects 
no tangible reward, to debt crowdfunding or peer-to-peer lending, where inves-
tors receive interest on their loans. For less risky projects, equity crowdfunding 
enables stakeholders to enjoy equity returns. According to the Department for 
Business Innovation and Skills, only 1 per cent of SMEs use crowdfunding as a 
source of finance (BIS, 2015a).

Venture capital and business angels
Business angels are typically individual investors or syndicates who search out 
opportunities to fund attractive technology start-ups, and perhaps offer addi-
tional support such as mentoring and certification services to suppliers, banks 
and government agencies. For example, some universities develop relationships 
with local businesses to provide technical and business support or ‘seedcorn’ 
financing. Kerr et al. (2014) report evidence that business angel financing leads 
to ‘improved survival, exits, employment, patenting, web traffic, and financ-
ing’; although it is difficult to determine whether the success is due to the 
activities of investors, or whether investors chose firms that are more likely 
to succeed. The market for venture capital is supplied by financial companies 
offering loans and risk management advice to established firms seeking support 
for innovation. To protect their investment, venture capital suppliers frequently 
require a presence on the board of directors. Although venture capital makes 
a relatively small contribution to the financing of business, in comparison to 
other sources, it is a significant driver of sustainable performance (Gompers 
and Lerner 2001).
Government support to SMEs
Government support to SMEs can take several forms:
■ In the UK, the regional growth fund (RGF) is administered through national 
or local organizations and can authorise grants or loans of moderate amounts 
(rarely over £1m) to small businesses; £800 million of RGF support was 
awarded to companies in 2014–15 (BIS, 2015b).
■ Start-up loans and mentoring services are aimed primarily at new businesses 
that are typically unable to attract bank loans.
■ Central and local government grants such as New Enterprise Allowance, 
Community Development Finance Institutions and local enterprise agencies 
all offer help and financial support.
Innovate UK is an independent organization sponsored by the Department 
for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (which replaced BIS in July 
2016). Its objective is to support research which, in their opinion, will drive 
economic growth. There is a focus on emerging technologies, such as quan-
tum technologies, synthetic biology, graphene and new imaging technology; 
and enabling technologies, which improve productivity and efficiency, such 
as cyber security, satellite systems and robotics. Innovate UK has developed 
a network of ‘catapults’, intended to bridge the gap between universities and 
business.
Tax relief
Many governments offer R&D tax relief, either for projects that achieve an 
advance in technical knowledge, or where the research confers benefits for a 
company’s business. R&D tax relief can be claimed for the costs of employees,

559
materials, utilities, software and capital expenditure directly relevant to the com-
pany’s research programme.
European funding
According to the League of European Research Universities (2011), 15 per cent 
of publicly funded research conducted in the EU comes from, or is coordinated 
by, the EU. The main source of such funding is ‘Horizon 2020’, a financial facil-
ity aimed towards driving growth and employment in EU member states, with a 
budget of €74.8 billion for 2014–20. Funding applications can be submitted by 
universities, research organizations, large businesses, SMEs and individuals. The 
scheme is divided into three main sections:
■ Excellent science: which promotes European Research Council support for 
future and emerging technologies and support for individual researchers.
■ Industrial Leadership: research into enabling and industrial technologies such 
as nanotechnology and advanced materials science.
■ Societal Challenges: projects in areas such as sustainable agriculture, climate 
action and energy technologies.
Collaboration with universities
It is often difficult for universities to realise the full commercial potential of their 
research. In recent years, many universities have found it necessary to add new 
outreach skills teams to access and support companies. Some UK universities 
have strong commercial relationships, such as Loughborough and Cranfield, 
whilst others work through centres of excellence, such as Cambridge and Impe-
rial. Communities of companies, both start-ups and established small businesses 
inhabiting various ‘Innovation Centres’, are a new phenomenon, starting to 
attract interest and funding from larger companies. Entrepreneurial companies 
may occasionally be the recipients of the research output of a university depart-
ment, but often act proactively by employing the skills of university graduates 
and parent departments to determine the direction of research for commercial 
exploitation. This new interface for universities has been extended to early-stage 
companies. Similar relationships may even work to support start-ups, as student 
project work may be carried out within an academic structure and incur no costs.
In 2013 the UK government set up ‘catapult’ centres at several universities and 
research facilities to bridge the gap between universities and business. These cen-
tres raise funds from a mix of competitively earned commercial funding and core 
investment from Innovate UK. In 2016 innovative activity focused on several key 
areas, including cell and gene therapy at Guys hospital in London, developing 
5G networks in Wales, and the Digital Catapult Centre in Kings Cross, London. 
These centres provide SMEs, larger corporate organizations and researchers with 
space to meet and collaborate on project development.
Collaborative activities may be motivated by the need to protect intellectual 
property. Since few university departments have the resources to defend pat-
ent infringements, patents are capable of offering only short-term protection. 
Instead, some universities prefer licensing; but the assessment of risks and costs 

560	
|	 18    ■    Research and development
may be difficult for licensors (Reslinski and Wu, 2016). For this reason, many 
universities place their intellectual property into spin-off companies and seek 
venture capital funding.

Diffusion
The pace at which new technologies filter through into common use varies enor-
mously from one case to another. The rate at which technological change spreads 
throughout the economy is known as the rate of diffusion. Some new technologies 
are adopted rapidly, and spread like wildfire among firms or consumers. Others 
seem to languish in oblivion for several years and then suddenly take off. Oth-
ers, despite seeming to be brilliantly conceived from a scientific or technological 
point of view, may never succeed in challenging or superseding an established 
product or process.
A model of diffusion
In a seminal study, Mansfield (1961) develops a mathematical framework that 
provides the basis for many subsequent attempts to measure the pace of diffusion 
and investigate its determinants. This framework underpins both the microeco-
nomics of technology adoption and the macroeconomic impact of technology 
on competitiveness and growth (Diamond, 2003). Suppose the diffusion of an 
innovation that is eventually adopted by all firms in an industry is observed, and 
the number of firms that have adopted is counted at regular time intervals. Let 
Ni denote the number of firms that will eventually adopt innovation i and let ni,t 
denote the number of firms that have adopted by time t. The proportion of firms 
that has adopted by time t is ni,t/Ni. Figure 18.5 shows the expected pattern if this 
Figure 18.5  Growth over time in the proportion of firms that have adopted an innovation

	
	
	
18.4  Diffusion	 |	
561
proportion is plotted against time. The positively sloped and elongated S-shaped 
curve is interpreted as follows:
■ When the innovation first appears, there are very few adopters, and the pace of 
diffusion is slow. At this stage the costs may be high and the benefits uncertain. 
Only the most innovative or far-sighted firms are willing to take the decision 
to adopt.
■ As time passes, the benefits of the innovation become clearer, and the costs of 
adoption start to fall. The pace of diffusion increases, as more firms take the 
decision to adopt.
■ Eventually, however, a point is reached at which most firms have already 
adopted. The pace of diffusion slows down. Only the most cautious firms, or 
those most resistant to change, have not yet taken the decision to adopt.
How can this logic be represented in mathematical form? A suitable mathemati-
cal expression for the pace of diffusion, measured by the number of firms adopt-
ing between time t and time t + 1, is as follows:
ni,t+1 - ni,t = ki¢
ni,t
Ni
≤¢1 -
ni,t
Ni
≤
where ki is a positive constant. This expression captures the logic of the previous 
discussion as follows:
■ At the start of the diffusion process when ni,t/Ni ≅0, the pace of diffusion is 
close to zero.
■ Midway through the diffusion process when ni,t/Ni ≅0.5 and 1 - ni,t/Ni ≅0.5, 
the pace of diffusion is non-zero and positive.
■ At the end of the diffusion process when ni,t/Ni ≅1 and 1 - ni,t/Ni ≅0, the 
pace of diffusion again approaches zero.
Similar models are used in the natural or biological sciences, for tasks such as 
modelling the spread of contagious diseases among a human or animal popula-
tion. By analogy, a successful innovation can be likened to a contagious disease; 
or even a meme, defined as ‘good ideas, good tunes, good poems . . . Anything 
that spreads by imitation’ (Dawkins, 1998, p. 304).
Returning to the mathematics, some manipulations can be applied to the 
above expression for ni,t+1 - ni,t, in order to obtain expressions for the propor-
tions of firms that have adopted and have not adopted by time t. The derivations 
of the following expressions are shown in Appendix 1:
ni,t
Ni
=
1
1 + e-(ai+bit) and 1 -
ni,t
Ni
=
Ni - ni,t
Ni
=
e-(ai+bit)
1 + e-(ai+bit)
where ai and bi are constants, and e is the exponential function. It is also useful 
to consider the ratio of these two expressions, ni,t/(Ni - ni,t), equivalent to the 
ratio of adopters at time t to non-adopters at time t. Taking the natural logarithm 
of this ratio:
loge[ni,t/(Ni - ni,t)] = ai + bit

562	
|	 18    ■    Research and development
According to this expression, the natural logarithm of the ratio of adopters to 
non-adopters follows a linear time trend. Using data on ni,t for each time period, 
it is possible to obtain numerical estimates of the parameters ai and bi. This is 
done quite simply, by running a regression with loge[ni,t/(Ni - ni,t)] as the depen-
dent variable and a linear time trend as the independent variable. The estimate 
of the parameter bi is of particular interest, because this parameter provides a 
direct measure of the pace of diffusion.
Using data on 12 innovations in the US coal mining, brewing, iron and steel, 
and railroads industries, in the first stage of his empirical analysis Mansfield 
(1961) obtains estimates of bi for each of the 12 cases. He then estimates a sec-
ond-stage cross-sectional regression, using data on all 12 innovations, to identify 
factors that influence the pace of diffusion measured by bi. The pace of diffusion 
is positively related to average profitability, and negatively related to the size of 
the initial investment. In a follow-up study, Mansfield (1969) examines the adop-
tion of numerical control (a process of operating machine tools via numerical 
instructions on cards or tape) in the US tool and die industry in the 1960s. Highly 
educated managers were better informed about the potential of a new technol-
ogy, and younger managers were less resistant to change. Many chief executives 
of adopting firms were college graduates. Many chief executives of non-adopting 
firms were educated to high school level only, and were older. ‘Judging by the 
interviews and other evidence, the diffusion process seems to have been slowed 
perceptibly by misunderstanding of the innovation and resistance to change’ 
(Mansfield, 1969, p. 71).
Although Mansfield’s methodology for measuring and modelling the pace of 
diffusion has been employed widely, it has been subject to criticism.
■ One objection concerns the implicit assumptions that all imitators are homoge-
neous, and that their number, the profitability of the investment and the tech-
nology itself are all constant over time. Adopters are seen as passive recipients, 
rather than active seekers, of technological change. More sophisticated models 
include controls for adopters’ search costs, and the effects of networking on the 
dissemination of information (Midgley et al., 1992).
■ A second objection is that the Mansfield model is fundamentally demand-
oriented, and ignores the role of supply-side factors. The pace of diffusion 
is influenced, however, by cost structures, the market structures in which 
suppliers operate, and supply-side technological change (Stoneman, 1989). 
Battisti and Stoneman (2005) find that the diffusion of Computer Numeri-
cally Controlled machine tools technology in UK engineering can be better 
explained by the profitability of individual firms, rather than by employing 
the Mansfield model.
■ A final objection is that the adopting firms’ costs are not properly analysed. 
Adoption costs include more than just the cost of acquiring new capital equip-
ment. The technology may require adaptation of the firm’s training practices 
or organizational structures. ‘In the limit, technology may be purpose built 
for a firm, in which case the study of diffusion becomes a study of customer 
supplier relationships’ (Karshenas and Stoneman, 1995, p. 279).

The pace of diffusion
Mansfield’s pioneering research in the 1960s identifies several factors that may 
either help or hinder the diffusion of new technologies. This subsection details 
some further industry- and firm-level factors.
Communication
An important barrier to rapid diffusion is poor communication between inven-
tors, innovators and the business community. The development of science parks 
and other initiatives is motivated by the wish to bring universities (the produc-
ers of new knowledge) and the immediate users closer together. According to 
the definition provided by the UK Science Parks Association (1999), a science 
park is a business support and technology transfer initiative with the following 
objectives:
■ To encourage and support the start-up and incubation of innovation-led, high-
growth, knowledge-based businesses.
■ To provide an environment in which larger and international businesses can 
develop specific close interactions with a particular centre of knowledge cre-
ation, for the mutual benefit of all parties concerned.
Science parks are a channel which distributes academic ideas and discovery 
to industry and commerce. Science parks are more likely to grow and thrive 
where there is an abundance of new knowledge and specific types of infra-
structure. Most commentators agree that universities are influential in foster-
ing new ideas that will eventually contribute towards technological progress 
(Salter and Martin, 2001; Jacobsson, 2002). This suggests that close proximity 
of science parks to universities increases the cross-fertilization of ideas, though 
this notion has been challenged by Fukugawa (2006). It is difficult to measure 
universities’ contribution to technological progress. Pavitt (2001) suggests that 
only a small proportion of the scientific research carried out within universi-
ties transfers seamlessly into commercial application. Laurensen and Salter 
(2003) find that R&D intensity, firm size, and factors relating to the industrial 
environment are important in explaining the propensity of firms to develop 
links with universities.
The quality of communication between firms in the same industry also 
influences the pace of diffusion. If the firms are clustered geographically, the 
pace of diffusion tends to be faster (Baptista, 2000). In Aharonson et al.’s 
(2004) study of the Canadian biotechnology industry, firms that are clustered 
geographically are eight times more likely to innovate than firms in remote 
locations. In a study of the car industry in eastern Europe, Lorentzen et al. 
(2003) find the existence of networks and the presence of multinational com-
panies are key determinants of the pace of diffusion. By contrast, Beaudry and 
Breschi (2003) find clustering does not guarantee a rapid pace of diffusion, 
because firms within clusters can be negatively influenced by the presence of 
non-innovating firms.

Case study 18.3
Truckmakers accused of putting brakes on 
technological change
FT
EU parliamentarians and environmental campaigners have long had suspicions about 
Europe’s truckmakers. For 20 years, lorries seemed strangely impervious to market forces 
that were supposed to make them more fuel efficient and reduce hazardous emissions. Six 
groups set aside €2.6bn over charges they fixed prices and delayed emission technologies. 
Some clues to the mystery emerged in November 2014, when Brussels levelled formal 
cartel charges against the continent’s biggest truck manufacturers: DAF, Daimler, Iveco, 
MAN, Volvo/Renault and Scania.
Accused of widespread price-fixing between 1997 and 2011 and delaying the introduc-
tion of new emissions technologies, the companies are expected to receive the highest 
cartel fine in EU history in the coming months — running to several billion euros. But 
the cartel investigation is only one strand of a far broader pattern of alleged collusive 
behaviour by lorry makers and the governments that lobby for them. Environmental cam-
paigners argue that the cartel relates to the pricing and timing of technologies intended to 
reduce toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx), which exacerbate lung and heart ailments.
However, beyond the scope of the cartel inquiry, they also allege that the truck indus-
try has strongly resisted attempts to improve fuel consumption and slash emissions of 
carbon dioxide, the most significant greenhouse gas. Emissions from lorries are a subject 
of intense concern because they produce about 25 per cent of the CO2 from road trans-
port, while representing fewer than 5 per cent of vehicles on the roads. Despite new, 
greener technologies being available, the European Commission reported in 2014 that 
heavy vehicles’ fuel efficiency had stagnated since the mid-1990s and estimated that their 
CO2 emissions increased 36 per cent between 1990 and 2010.
One of the most conspicuous cases of lorry makers flexing their muscles to resist tech-
nological change came in December 2014. The commission and European Parliament 
had pushed to introduce rules by 2017 that would enable truckmakers to replace their 
brick-shaped cabs with more aerodynamic and fuel efficient designs. Countries such as 
France and Sweden lobbied hard to push the start-date to 2025 to protect their domestic 
producers. Finally, the parties struck a compromise of 2022.
Michael Cramer, chairman of the European Parliament’s transport committee, com-
plained that member states’ protection of their truck manufacturers lay in stark contrast 
to Europe’s other main industries, which had cleaned up their businesses dramatically 
since 1990. ‘Transport is nullifying efforts in other sectors,’ he told the Financial Times.
William Todts from the Transport and Environment campaign group accused the 
truckmakers of squandering a ‘unique opportunity’ to produce a new generation of 
smooth-nosed, fuel efficient vehicles. ‘Instead of making the most of it, truckmakers got 
together and made a deal among themselves to block new designs for another decade. 
It’s this attitude that helps explaining 20 years of very little progress on truck fuel effi-
ciency,’ he said.

The motor industry says that its performance in CO2 emissions should be rated over 
a longer timeframe, noting big improvements since the mid-1960s. Lorry manufacturers 
have also argued that they have made very significant steps to slice NOx emissions after 
the introduction of the so-called Euro 6 standards in 2014. Scania launched a Euro 6 truck 
as early as 2011 and Iveco insists it is embracing the ‘challenge of sustainability’. Daimler 
invested €2.8bn into improving environmental standards in vehicles of all types last year.

Management inertia
The education, experience and attitudes of managers may influence the adop-
tion of new technology at firm level. Managers who are scientifically educated 
to a high level, and conversant with the characteristics of current scientific and 
technological developments, are likely to be more imaginative, more flexible and 
more open to persuasion as to the commercial potential of new products or 
processes. Managers with a weak technical background may be reluctant to rec-
ognise the superiority of a new technology, may adopt only when their existing 
equipment needs replacement, and may be slow, cautious or unimaginative in 
seizing technical opportunities. In 1959, Pilkington, a UK glass manufacturer, 
developed a new process that revolutionised the production of flat glass. When 
attempting to patent the process in the US, the firm’s management was aston-
ished to discover that an identical patent had been in existence in the US since 
1907, but no US or foreign firm had previously attempted to exploit the idea.
The most charitable explanations are ignorance of the US patents, which 
would hardly be a tribute to their technical awareness, or satisfaction 
with the existing technology and a consequent disinclination to embark 
on the development work ultimately and successfully pursued by a 
smaller British firm.
(Blair, 1972, p. 236)
Protecting an older technology
Reluctance to innovate need not be solely due to stubbornness, inertia or resis-
tance to change on the part of managers. In some cases a dominant firm or cartel 
might wish to protect its existing market share or preserve the current market 
structure, either by keeping new ideas secret or by denying entry to firms with 
new ideas or newer technologies, see Case study 18.3. The speed at which new 
technology replaces old is partly dependent on the age profile of the existing capi-
tal stock. Firms with a high proportion of older equipment are likely to adopt a

new technology at a faster rate than those that have recently installed equipment 
using the old technology.
Employee or trades union resistance
Organised labour might attempt to resist the adoption of new technology, if 
they view it as a threat to employment. For example, in the 1970s, print unions 
in the UK were reluctant to accept technology which allowed journalists to elec-
tronically transfer their copy direct to the photosetting department, bypassing 
the composing rooms. The newspaper industry was slow in adopting technologies 
that were already in widespread use elsewhere.
Regulation
If an industry is subject to a cumbersome regulatory framework, perhaps requir-
ing standards for materials, design and safety, the adoption of new technology 
may be sluggish. However, Hannan and McDowell (1984) find that regulation 
may have encouraged the rapid diffusion of automated telling machines (ATMs) 
by US banks. The adoption of ATMs provided a means for circumventing state-
level restrictions on the number of branches a bank could operate. Giaccotto 
et al. (2005) suggest that an absence of price regulation in the US pharmaceutical 
industry encouraged higher R&D spending.
Risk and liquidity
A new technology may be adopted slowly or reluctantly if its introduction 
involves significant risk. The use of capital intensive production methods can 
increase a firm’s vulnerability to fluctuations in demand. It might be argued that 
the more profitable the firm, the more able it is to generate internal funds for 
the development and application of new technology. It is implicit in this view 
that investment in new technology is risky, and it is difficult for firms to raise 
external finance.

Patents
The granting of a patent to the inventor of a new product, process, substance 
or design confers a property right over the knowledge that is embodied in the 
invention. The relevant knowledge is legally recognised as an economic asset, 
which can either be exploited by the patent holder, or licensed or sold by the pat-
ent holder for exploitation by others. In exchange for this legal recognition, the 
inventor discloses information about the existence of the invention to the public. 
In most countries patents are awarded for a finite period. In the UK, the lifetime 
of patents was increased from 16 to 20 years (the current figure at the time of

writing) by the 1977 Patents Act. In most countries, to be patented an invention 
must meet the following criteria:
■ The invention must be new, in the sense that it has not been previously used, 
published or demonstrated in the public domain. There are certain ideas that 
cannot be patented, including pure scientific discoveries, mathematical formu-
lae, mental processes and artistic creations.
■ The invention must be non-obvious, in the sense that it does not represent a 
trivial modification of something that is already known to specialists in the rel-
evant scientific field. It must embody a genuine advance in knowledge, which 
would not have been obvious to a reasonably informed specialist.
■ The invention must be capable of commercial application. It is not possible to 
patent pure scientific knowledge that has no practical application.
In the UK in 2016, the application fee for a patent was in the range £230 to 
£280 and the annual renewal fee (payable from the fourth year onwards) was £70, 
rising to £600 in the twentieth year. Other expenses may be incurred in making 
an application. The services of consultants (patent agents) might be required to 
ensure the application is drafted so as to avoid imitation around the patent and 
minimise the risk of litigation. It might also be necessary to take out patents in 
foreign countries, to prevent imitation by foreign competitors. The total cost of 
a patent application might run to tens of thousands of pounds. The costs and 
effort can act as a deterrent, especially for small and medium-sized firms or 
independent inventors.
Patents exist to provide incentives for investment in R&D and for innova-
tion. Granting a property right over the knowledge creates a monopoly, confer-
ring market power upon the patent holder. Moser (2005) shows that patenting 
encourages innovation, and influences the direction of innovation towards coun-
tries and industries that have strong protection. Expressing this argument in 
other terminology, the knowledge created through successful R&D possesses the 
characteristics of public goods known as non-excludability and non-rivalness. In 
the absence of a patenting system, these characteristics reduce the incentive for 
investment in the acquisition of new knowledge.
■ Non-excludability implies that, once new knowledge has been created, it is 
not possible to exclude others from gaining access to the knowledge. In other 
words, it is difficult to establish property rights on the knowledge. This means 
that, without a patenting system, inventors encounter difficulties in appropriat-
ing the rewards from their investment in acquiring the knowledge.
■ Non-rivalness implies that making knowledge available to one person does not 
diminish the quantity of the same knowledge available to others. In other words, 
the marginal cost of disseminating knowledge to each additional person is either 
very small or zero. This creates a conflict between the inventor’s private interest 
in restricting access to the knowledge, and the social objective of welfare maxi-
mization, which requires the knowledge to be disseminated as widely as possible.

Intellectual property can also be protected by copyrights. Patents are primar-
ily viewed as protecting ideas, while copyrights protect the expression of ideas. 
For example, a patent can protect a new machine, and a copyright can protect 
the author of a book. However, some creations, such as computer software, can 
be seen as both ideas and the expression of ideas. Watt (2005) suggests that one 
solution might be to allow innovators to choose, at a price, the type of protection 
they prefer. Absolute secrecy might sometimes be more attractive than patent-
ing. When a firm discloses knowledge as part of a patent application it runs the 
risk of imitation, and in some cases patenting may be interpreted as a means for 
spreading rather than withholding information (Kultti et al., 2007).
In designing a patent system, policymakers need to strike a balance between 
providing sufficient incentives to encourage R&D on the one hand, and avoid-
ing monopolization and the abuse of market power on the other. The dilemma is 
illustrated in Figure 18.6. Consider the incentive to invest in the development of a 
new process that has the potential to produce a large average cost saving for the 
firms in a perfectly competitive industry (as in Figure 18.2). The inventor’s initial 
development cost is X. The benefits from using the process accrue over two periods:
■ In Period 1 (the short run), the inventor has exclusive knowledge of the process, 
and can licence it to the perfectly competitive firms. Imitation is not possible in 
the short run, so paying for the right to use the process is the only way for the 
firms to gain access.
■ In Period 2 (the long run), if the invention is not patented imitation is possible, 
and any firm can use the process (without incurring the development cost). If the 
invention is patented, the inventor can continue to charge the licence fee or royalty.
In Figure 18.6, LRAC1 represents the average cost under the old technology, 
and LRAC2 represents the average cost using the new process. Q1 is the indus-
try output before the invention, and P1 is the market price. While it is possible 
to control access to the process, the profit-maximizing royalty is P2 - LRAC2 
Figure 18.6  Welfare implications of patenting

	
	
	
18.5  Patents	 |

per unit of output. Q2 is the industry output, P2 is the market price, and D + E 
is the total royalty payment. If it is not possible to control access (because the 
inventor’s property rights are not protected by patent), Q3 is the industry output 
and P3 is the market price.
Does the option for the inventor to take out a patent increase welfare by 
improving the inventor’s incentive to proceed? Or does this option reduce welfare 
by conferring market power upon the inventor, which can be used to restrict 
output and raise the market price? In fact, either outcome is possible. Suppose 
initially X 6 D + E.
■ Even if there is no patenting, it is worthwhile for the inventor to proceed with 
the invention. The inventor’s Period 1 (short run) reward of D + E exceeds 
the development cost of X. In Period 1 industry output adjusts to Q2. In 
Period 2, however, imitation takes place. The inventor receives no further 
return in Period 2, and industry output adjusts to Q3. In Period 2 there is 
allocative efficiency, because price equals marginal cost. Consumer surplus is 
A + B + C + D + E + F.
■ If there is patenting, the same analysis applies in Period 1. In Period 2, how-
ever, the inventor continues to charge for the use of the process, and in Period 
2 again earns a return of (D + E). The inventor’s total return is 2(D + E). 
Industry output remains at Q2. In Period 2 there is allocative inefficiency 
because price exceeds marginal cost. Consumer surplus is A + B + C, and 
producer surplus (in the form of the royalty payment) is D + E.
Now suppose D + E 6 X 6 2(D + E).
■ If there is no patenting, it is not worthwhile for the inventor to proceed with the 
invention. The inventor’s Period 1 (short run) return of D + E does not repay 
the development cost of X, and in Period 2 the inventor receives no further 
reward. The invention does not take place, and industry output remains at Q1 
in Periods 1 and 2. There is allocative efficiency only in the narrow sense that 
price equals marginal cost (at the higher level). Consumer surplus is A and there 
is no producer surplus.
■ If there is patenting, it is worthwhile for the inventor to proceed. In Periods 
1 and 2, the inventor charges for use of the process, and earns a total royalty 
of 2(D + E), which exceeds the development cost of X. Industry output is 
Q2 in Periods 1 and 2. There is allocative inefficiency, because price exceeds 
marginal cost (at the lower level). However, consumer surplus is A + B + C 
and producer surplus is D + E.
Therefore, in the case X 6 D + E, combined consumer and producer 
surplus in Period 2 is higher if there is no patent system. But in the case 
D + E 6 X 6 2(D + E), the opposite is true. In this latter case, the equilibrium 
of (P2, Q2) with patenting is a second best solution. The best outcome would be 
(P3, Q3), but this outcome is not feasible because of the problem of inappro-
priability. Without a patent, the inventor cannot recoup the development cost 
due to imitation. However, the second best outcome of (P2, Q2) is preferable to 
(P1, Q1), the actual outcome in the absence of patenting.

This analysis raises practical questions about the duration and coverage of 
patents. Clearly the duration should be long enough to enable the inventor to 
earn a sufficient return on the R&D investment for this investment to take place. 
Since every invention has a different time profile of costs and proceeds, it is 
difficult or impossible for policymakers to determine a patent duration that is 
suitable for every case. Yang and Tsou (2002) examine the propensity to patent 
following a change in the Taiwanese patenting system in 1994, which increased 
the duration of patents. Although the number of patents increased after the 
change, this may have been due to factors other than the change in duration.
Determining the optimal coverage or breadth of a patent is even more dif-
ficult, since the concept of breadth is difficult to measure or generalise, unlike 
duration which is straightforward. A new idea should differ sufficiently from 
any existing idea to prevent other firms inventing around the existing idea. Too 
broad a protection encourages firms to invest in fundamental technologies, but 
discourages further investment in second- and third- generation applications or 
smaller improvements (Scotchmer, 1991). Taken together, the issues of duration 
and breadth are complex, and it is difficult to make general recommendations 
(Denicolò, 1996; Takalo, 2001). O’Donoghue et al. (1998) define the effective life 
of a patent as the duration at which the idea either reaches the end of its useful-
ness, or is superseded by something new. The effective life of a patent is heavily 
dependent on the breadth of the patent.
To this point, the discussion has focused on the possibility that insufficient 
research may be undertaken if the patent system provides either insufficient incen-
tive for the original inventor, or too much incentive in the form of excessive mar-
ket power once the innovation has taken place, inhibiting diffusion. It is also 
possible to envisage situations in which too much research, or the wrong kind 
of research, is produced, either with or without a patenting system (Hirschleifer, 
1971; Cockburn and Henderson, 1994; Hall and Ziedonis, 2001). This could arise 
if firms launch competitive R&D or patent races, in an effort to be the first to 
acquire a patent and the market power that this confers. Not only is much of the 
research effort duplicated, but also excessive haste may lead to errors and a further 
waste of resources. A patenting system may produce distortions in the alloca-
tion of resources to research activity, favouring activities for which patenting is 
feasible. There is no reason to assume that patented work necessarily produces 
the greatest economic benefit. By granting monopoly status, patents might offer 
greater protection to innovators than to genuine inventors. Some firms might pat-
ent pre-emptively, in an effort to limit competition. Patents might tend to provide 
protection at the wrong stage in the process. Inventors require protection, but at 
the innovation stage competition is preferable, to maximise the pace of diffusion.
Several of these points are investigated in empirical research into the effects 
of patents on the incentives for inventive or innovative activity. Schankerman 
(1998) investigates patent renewals in France for four technology fields: pharma-
ceuticals, chemicals, mechanical engineering and electronics.
The finding that patent rights are surprisingly less valuable in 
pharmaceuticals, where there is stringent price regulation in France, 
highlights the important point that R&D incentives are shaped not only

by patent law but also other institutional constraints that affect the 
appropriability environment.
(Schankerman, 1998, p. 104)
In a more recent paper Schankerman (2013) discusses the idea that patents are 
themselves becoming an obstruction to innovation.
The proliferation of patents, and the fragmentation of ownership rights 
among firms (‘patent thickets’), are believed to raise transaction costs 
and constrain the freedom of action to conduct R&D, particularly in 
‘complex’ technology sectors like information technology.
(Schankerman, 2013, p. 471)
Greenhalgh and Longland (2005) examine the size and durability of protection 
offered by patents and trademarks to a sample of UK manufacturing firms. 
There is evidence of productivity gains to firms that invested in R&D, but the 
protection offered by patents and trademarks was relatively short-lived. Firms 
in the most dynamic sectors need to maintain high levels of R&D investment in 
order to maintain their advantages over competitors.
Bronzini and Piselli (2016) evaluate the impact of an R&D subsidy pro-
gramme implemented in Italy. The subsidies provided to encourage R&D led to 
an increase in the number of patents applied for by smaller firms.
	
18.6	
Empirical evidence
The Schumpeterian hypothesis
As shown in Section 18.2, the Schumpeterian analysis suggests two distinct 
hypotheses: first, that market structure affects the quantity of inventive or 
innovative activity or the pace of technological change; and, second, that large 
firms are more likely to invest in R&D than small firms owing to economies of 
scale. This section examines some of the empirical evidence concerning these 
two hypotheses. At the outset, it is important to draw attention to some of the 
difficulties that confront researchers in this field.
Typically, three types of measure of the level of R&D activity are used:
■ Input-based measures, usually based on levels of R&D expenditure (hiring 
scientific personnel and spending on research equipment) reported in company 
accounts.
■ Output-based measures, usually based on the numbers of patents issued.
■ Lists of inventions or innovations.
Input-based measures are of limited value, for several reasons. First, all of 
a firm’s R&D expenditure may be attributed to the firm’s principal activity, 
whereas in fact the effort may be directed towards subsidiary activities. Second, 

572	
|	 18    ■    Research and development
some research activity may be located outside the firm’s R&D department, for 
example, in a design office. Third, official statistics may not reflect research 
undertaken by small and medium-sized firms, if these firms do not identify their 
research expenditures specifically in their accounts. Finally, an input-based 
measure is by definition a measure of effort, but not necessarily a measure of 
achievement.
The use of data on patent applications or patents granted offers the advantage 
that most patent applications are made with a view to commercial application. 
Nevertheless, patents are not homogeneous, and outcomes range from the com-
mercially successful to the completely useless. A patent count of two should 
reflect twice as much technical output as a count of one, but clearly this is not 
always so. Cross-sectional comparisons (between industries) are distorted by 
variation in the propensity to patent from one industry to another. For example, 
defence contractors seldom patent their inventions, since governments are the 
main or sole purchasers of their products. In organic chemicals and petrochemi-
cals, small changes to the molecular structure of compounds can have major 
implications for product characteristics. This creates a tendency for prolifera-
tion of manipulated molecule patenting. International studies face the further 
difficulty that the institutional barriers that need to be surmounted to secure a 
patent vary widely between countries.
Patel and Pavitt (1995) recommend using lists of inventions and innovations, 
as an alternative to patents data. With hindsight, the economic contribution 
of each technological advance can be assessed. However, decisions as to which 
innovations to include and exclude are to some degree subjective. One possibility 
is to identify technological innovations that are ‘important enough to warrant 
annotation in the vast array of trade journals covering particular industries’ 
(Scherer, 1992, p. 1423). Fortunately, input- and output-based measures of R&D 
activity appear to be highly correlated.
A simple test of the relationship between market structure and the level of 
inventive or innovative activity is based on a cross-sectional regression of a suit-
able input- or output-based measure against an industry seller concentration 
measure. However, the causation between concentration and the quantity of 
R&D is not necessarily all one-way. As a result of technological change, oppor-
tunities for new innovations arise. Some firms take advantage while others are 
slow to adapt. Over time, the more innovative firms increase their market shares, 
and seller concentration increases.
According to Geroski (1994), factors such as increased product differentia-
tion, economies of scale and the tendency for seller concentration to increase 
over time even if growth is essentially random (see Section 11.3) made a larger 
contribution than innovation to the rise in seller concentration in most developed 
countries during the twentieth century. Geroski reports evidence in support of 
Blair’s (1972) hypothesis that, over the long run, technological change (specifi-
cally the advent of new materials and electronics) reduced the MES (minimum 
efficient scale) at plant level and was a force for deconcentration.
Tests of the Schumpeterian hypothesis based on cross-sectional regressions 
of industry research activity indicators against industry concentration can

573
be criticised on the grounds that different industries offer different techno-
logical opportunities. Technological opportunity may be an inherent product 
characteristic, or it may depend partly upon whether a vigorous scientific cul-
ture forms part of industry tradition. Levin et al. (1987) define technological 
opportunity on the basis of interviews which seek to measure receptiveness to 
scientific advance based on information flows from government, universities, 
suppliers and clients.
Much empirical research on innovation focuses on the twin hypotheses that 
firms in highly concentrated industries and large firms are most likely to invest 
heavily in R&D (Scherer, 1965, 1992; Kamien and Schwartz, 1982; Cohen and 
Levin, 1989; Cohen, 1995). Using UK data for the period 1945–83, Geroski 
(1994) examines whether monopoly or competition is the market structure 
most conducive to innovation. There is only a limited relationship between 
market power and the pace of technological change. Industries that are highly 
concentrated and becoming more so tend to produce a slower pace of tech-
nological change than competitive industries. There is a positive relationship 
between expectations of abnormal profit and the pace of technological change. 
Industry size, export intensity and unionization are unrelated to innovative 
activity, and there is little or no support for a Schumpeterian association 
between monopoly and innovation. Alexander et al. (1995) report evidence of 
a positive relationship between firm size and the pace of technological change. 
R&D activity was lower in non-US-owned firms. Although there is a positive 
relationship between R&D expenditure and output, this relationship is subject 
to diminishing returns.
Geroski et al. (1993) examine the empirical relationship between innovation 
and profitability, using UK manufacturing data. There is a positive relation-
ship between the number of innovations produced by a firm and its profit-
ability, although this relationship is weak. Spillover effects are less important 
than in similar US-based research. An effort is made to distinguish between 
the contributions of R&D inputs and outputs to profitability, and to determine 
whether the correlation between innovative output and profitability reflects 
transitory or permanent performance differences between innovating and non-
innovating firms. Permanent effects are more apparent during recessions, sug-
gesting that innovating firms are better able to withstand cyclical downturns 
than non-innovating firms.
In a survey of empirical literature on the relationship between firm size and 
innovation, Scherer (1992) draws several conclusions. Large firms are more 
likely to invest in R&D and to obtain patents. However, most manufactur-
ing firms, even those of a modest size, appear to be involved in some form of 
innovative activity. Traditional measures of innovation based on R&D expendi-
ture ignore a large amount of informal activity, especially within smaller firms. 
There is some evidence that R&D activity and patenting tend to increase lin-
early with firm size. The ratio of R&D expenditure to sales at firm level varies 
more between industries than within industries. Large size achieved through 
diversification typically does not result in a higher R&D expenditure-to-sales 
ratio, unless diversification is pursued specifically to develop R&D synergies. 

574

Dubois et al. (2015) using improved and newer data examine the relationship 
between market size and innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. They find 
that $2.5 billion is required in additional revenue to support the development 
of a new chemical entity. They also note that the accounting cost of introducing 
one new drug is between $800 million  and $1 billion. Size in the pharmaceutical 
industry clearly matters.
Although there is some empirical evidence suggesting a positive relationship 
between seller concentration and the level of R&D activity, this relationship 
appears to be weak, and becomes even more fragile if factors such as technologi-
cal opportunity and appropriability are considered. Even if a positive relation-
ship between concentration and innovation does exist, its interpretation can be 
problematic. Causation between market structure and innovation can run in 
either direction. Furthermore, and contrary to the Schumpeterian hypothesis, it 
is possible that the small or medium-sized firms in highly concentrated industries 
are primarily responsible for the positive association between concentration and 
R&D activity.
Using data from Korean manufacturing, Lee (2005) attempts to explain why 
there are so many diverse and conflicting empirical results in studies of the rela-
tionship between industry R&D intensity and market structure. Lee defines 
market structure using an index based on each firm’s technological competence 
weighted by its market share, to reflect the appropriability of R&D. A negative 
relationship is found in those industries where market share is related to tech-
nological competence and a positive relationship is found where market share is 
less dependent on technological competence.
Using data on patent counts and patent citations for 220 4-digit industries 
over the period 1989–2001, Correa and Ornaghi (2014) examine the relation-
ship between competition and innovation, and find a positive association. Pat-
ent counts and citations are larger in industries characterised by higher levels of 
competition.
Overall, empirical research on the relationships between firm size, market 
structure and innovation has failed to produce unambiguous conclusions. Many 
studies are based on small datasets, and many face serious problems in defin-
ing and quantifying key variables. One general conclusion that does emerge, 
however, is that a simplistic or mechanistic interpretation of the Schumpeterian 
hypothesis is not supported by the empirical evidence.
The pace of diffusion
Canepa and Stoneman (2004) examine factors that explain differences between 
countries in the pace of diffusion, using survey data on the take-up of new manu-
facturing technologies. The pace of diffusion is heavily dependent on the nature 
of the technology, and no country achieved a faster pace of diffusion consis-
tently across all technologies. Adoption costs, information and learning effects, 
and firm or industry characteristics including size, location and competition are 
major influences on the pace of diffusion.

Box 18.1
The pace of technological change: some 
international comparisons
In response to a request from the House of Commons Science and Technology Commit-
tee, the National Audit Office was asked to provide an overview of R&D spending in the 
UK since 1995. The following points are the key findings:
1.	 According to ONS data, between 1995 and 2011, overall annual spending on R&D in 
the UK increased in real terms by 37 per cent, from just under £20 billion to just over 
£27 billion. Most of this increase resulted from a growth in UK businesses’ spend on 
undertaking R&D. However, spending declined between 2007 and 2010, around the 
onset of the economic crisis, as well as from 2004 to 2005 and 1995 to 1997
2.	 The government has progressively reduced the amount it spends on undertaking 
R&D itself, but at the same time, has increased the funding it provides to UK busi-
ness. Between 1995 and 2011, R&D undertaken by Public Research Institutions 
(defined here as research bodies associated with government departments and the 
Research Councils) fell by £559 million (19 per cent) in real terms, but government 
funding of UK business increased by £255 million (19 per cent).
3.	 Higher Education Institutions have played an increasingly significant role in under-
taking R&D within the UK, with activity in the sector increasing in value by £3.3 
billion (86 per cent) in real terms between 1995 and 2011. OECD data show that in 
2011, Higher Education contributed around 27 per cent of the total R&D undertaken 
in the UK, compared to an average of 19 per cent across the OECD area as a whole.
4.	 Regional analysis shows that R&D activity is concentrated in England, which 
accounted for 89 per cent of the UK’s total expenditure on R&D in 2011 (compared 
to England’s 84 per cent share of the UK population). Within England, R&D activity 
is concentrated in three regions – London, the South East and the East of England 
which together accounted for £14 billion of activity in 2011 (52 per cent of the total 
R&D carried out in the UK). These distributions should be considered in the context 
of population distributions and Gross Value Added (a measure of the economic value 
of goods produced in an area). In 2011, the three regions with the highest concentra-
tion of R&D activity also had a higher than average proportion of the UK population 
living there and had the highest Gross Value Added.
5.	 The total annual cost to government of providing R&D tax relief to companies has 
increased since the relief was first introduced in April 2000, from £89 million in 2000-
01 to £1.1 billion in 2010-11, in real terms. This growth has been driven by an increase 
in the number of claims made by companies, as well as the size of individual claims by 

576	
|	 18    ■    Research and development
large companies. In 2010–11, large companies made up 69 per cent of the total cost 
to government of providing relief.
6.	 The UK receives a significant amount of European Commission grant to support 
research and innovation, although it is difficult to quantify how much of this funds 
activity that would meet the definition of R&D activity used by the ONS. Between 
2007 and 2013, the UK will have received €4.9 billion (around £4 billion) from the 
Seventh Framework Programme, the European Commission’s main funding mecha-
nism to support R&D activities. This represents around 9 per cent of the total funding 
available under the programme.
7.	 UK business spending on R&D is concentrated in a small number of very large firms. 
For example, in 2011, the top ten UK businesses, in terms of spending on performing 
R&D, spent £7.7 billion undertaking R&D (44 per cent of UK business spending). 
R&D undertaken by the UK’s small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs – entities 
with fewer than 250 employees) accounted for 23 per cent of the overall spending on 
R&D by UK business in 2011. However, most of this spending is by the subsidiaries 
of larger enterprise groups, rather than independent SMEs, which in 2011 accounted 
for just 4 per cent of the R&D undertaken by UK business.
8.	 The UK pharmaceuticals sector, which accounted for 28 per cent of total UK busi-
ness spending on undertaking R&D in 2011, is a key driver of innovation in the UK, 
but the UK’s reliance on the sector is also a risk. The sector attracts much of the UK’s 
overseas funding for R&D: in 2011, 40 per cent of the total overseas funding for UK 
business R&D was for the pharmaceuticals sector.
9.	 UK spending on R&D relative to Gross Domestic Product (‘R&D intensity’) is 
ranked around the middle compared to other countries in the OECD area. In 2011, 
the UK’s R&D intensity was around 1.8 per cent, which was below the European 
Union average (currently estimated to be 1.9 per cent) and a long way off the Euro-
pean Union’s target of 3 per cent by 2020. Moreover, between 1995 and 2001, the 
UK’s R&D intensity weakened, and since 2001 it has remained broadly unchanged, 
while for most other countries it has increased over both periods.

real incomes were important. Sundqvist et al. (2005) examine the diffusion 
of wireless communications across 64 countries. Wealthy countries adopted 
earlier than poorer ones; the pattern of adoption was similar across countries 
deemed to have similar cultures; and the pace of diffusion was faster in coun-
tries that adopted later (lag markets) than in those that adopted early (lead 
markets). According to Beise (2004), lead markets that have a competitive 
advantage related to low-cost production, buoyant demand, intense rivalry 
between existing producers, and a strong export orientation are best suited 
to produce innovations that are later adopted globally. The mobile telephone 
industry conforms to the lead market hypothesis. In this case, Scandinavia 
took the lead in production and adoption. Eventually cellular telephony and 
the associated cellular mobile telephone standard achieved global acceptance, 
displacing rival technologies such as pagers. Battisti et al. (2007) compare the 
intra- and inter-firm diffusion rates of various information and communication 
technologies in the UK and Switzerland. Organizational forms and managerial 
practices were important determinants of the pace of diffusion. Andrés et al. 
(2010) examine the process of internet diffusion using a sample of 199 devel-
oped and developing countries during the period 1990–2004. The authors find 
that network effects (measured by the number of users previously using the 
technology) are the most important factor in determining internet usage across 
both developed and developing countries.
Several studies examine the pace of diffusion of new technologies in banking 
and financial services. Jagtiani et al. (1995) examine the diffusion of stand-by 
letters of credit, loan sales, swaps, options, futures and forwards among US 
banks. Regulatory changes in bank capital requirements had little effect on the 
rate of adoption in four of these five cases, but the rate of adoption increased 
for stand-by letters of credit, as banks substituted these for more traditional 
forms of lending. The adoption decision was not explained by the size or other 
measurable characteristics of the banks. For many banks, the timing of adoption 
appeared to be influenced by a bandwagon effect. Molyneux and Shamroukh 
(1996) examine the diffusion of junk bonds and note issuance facilities among 
European, Japanese and US banks. Adoption of junk bonds appears to have 
been driven by assessments of future profitability, based on market conditions. 
Adoption of note issuance facilities appears to have been a defensive strategy, in 
response to a perceived threat to traditional lending business. Fung and Cheng 
(2004) examine the diffusion of contingent liabilities, exchange rate contracts and 
interest rate contracts among Hong Kong banks. Information complementarity 
(using customer information to market several financial products) and individual 
bank creditworthiness were drivers of diffusion.

Summary
Much of the theoretical and empirical analysis of the economics of R&D and 
innovation is based on ideas developed by Schumpeter, who saw technological 
change as the main driving force for economic growth. The process of cre-
ative destruction rewards successful innovators, and punishes firms whose 

578	
|	 18    ■    Research and development
technologies are superseded and become obsolete. Large firms that became 
monopolies through successful innovation in the past are the main drivers of 
technological progress.
The Schumpeterian hypothesis, that there is an association between successful 
innovation and monopoly, has provided the motivation for an extensive body of 
research, including several attempts to reposition Schumpeter’s approach within 
a neoclassical economics framework. In a well-known contribution, Arrow shows 
that the incentive to innovate may be greater under competitive conditions than 
it is under a monopoly. However, Arrow’s analysis has been subject to criticism 
for failing to present a fair comparison, based on equivalent output levels or price 
elasticities before the innovation takes place, in the cases of both perfect competi-
tion and monopoly. Several economists have argued for an inverted U-shaped 
relationship between seller concentration and the amount of R&D effort, with 
oligopoly being the market structure most conducive to a fast pace of techno-
logical change. An oligopolist has both the means to devote resources to R&D 
(being capable of earning an abnormal profit, unlike the perfect competitor), and 
the incentive (being subject to intense competitive pressure from rivals, unlike 
the monopolist).
Although the Schumpeterian hypothesis is often interpreted in terms of an 
association between market structure and the pace of technological change, 
this hypothesis is consistent with the notion of a relationship between firm size 
and the amount of R&D. It might be that only large firms have the resources 
to implement large-scale research programmes, or bear the risk. On the 
other hand, large organizations may fail to provide their managers or other 
employees with incentives for creative or original thinking. The bureaucratic 
nature of many large organizations might actively discourage originality and 
non-conformity.
In many cases, the decision to invest in R&D is strategic. A key strategic issue 
is the choice between an offensive strategy, whereby the firm pioneers new ideas; 
a defensive strategy, whereby the firm undertakes sufficient research to keep pace 
with competitors; an imitative strategy, copying ideas that have been developed 
elsewhere; or a dependent strategy, which involves borrowing or acquiring a 
licence to use technology that has been developed elsewhere. Like any other 
investment decision, the decision to commit resources to R&D can be subjected 
to investment appraisal analysis. Relevant considerations include the anticipated 
levels of demand and costs, the marketing strategy (in the case of a product inno-
vation), and the means of financing the research.
The pace of diffusion refers to the speed at which new technology spreads 
from the original innovating firm to others that can also use the technology. The 
Mansfield model provides a benchmark for investigating factors that influence 
the pace of diffusion, including the following:
■ Quality of communications: effective channels of communication between 
firms that are members of the same industry, and between firms and university 
researchers, are likely to produce a faster pace of diffusion.
■ The education, experience and attitudes of a firm’s managers may influence 
or determine their receptiveness to new ideas.

	
	
	
Discussion questions	 |	
579
■ A dominant firm that hopes to maintain an entrenched position as market 
leader might be reluctant to experiment with new technology; so too might 
a firm that has only recently upgraded its capital stock based on an older 
technology.
■ Organised labour might have an interest in resisting the adoption of new tech-
nology, if a threat to employment is perceived.
■ A cumbersome regulatory framework may slow down the pace of adoption of 
new technology.
■ A new technology may be adopted slowly or reluctantly if its introduction 
involves high risk.
■ The design of a country’s patenting system can affect the pace of diffusion in 
either direction.
The award of a patent to the inventor of a new product, process, substance 
or design confers a property right over the knowledge embodied in the inven-
tion. In most countries patents are awarded for a finite period; the current UK 
duration is 20 years. In order to be patented, an invention must be new, non-
obvious, and capable of commercial application. Patents exist to provide incen-
tives for investment in R&D and for innovation. Granting a property right 
over the knowledge creates a monopoly, conferring market power upon the 
patent holder. The opportunity to earn an abnormal profit through the exploi-
tation of this market power may represent the main incentive for the original 
investment. In designing a patent system, policymakers need to strike a balance 
between providing sufficient incentives to encourage R&D on the one hand, and 
avoiding excessive monopolization and abuses of market power on the other. 
Determining how long patents should be issued for, and how narrow or wide 
their coverage should be, are difficult issues, which may have implications for 
the pace of technological change.
Although there is some empirical evidence to suggest a positive association 
between seller concentration and the amount of R&D, the relationship appears 
weak. If factors such as technological opportunity and appropriability are taken 
into account, the evidence for such a relationship becomes even more fragile. 
Causation between market structure and innovation can run in either direction. 
Overall, research on the relationships between market structure, firm size and 
innovation has failed to deliver unambiguous empirical results.

Introduction
A merger takes place when two independent companies join together to form a 
single company. Often, there is a clear distinction between the acquiring com-
pany and the acquired company. Accordingly, many mergers may be viewed as 
acquisitions or takeovers. In practice, however, the terms merger, acquisition and 
takeover are often used interchangeably, because it can be difficult to interpret 
the strategic intent of managers. Integration and consolidation are alternative 
terms used to describe the formation of a combined entity by bringing together 
two separate entities. A merger may involve the exchange of shares in the two 

	
	
	
19.1  Introduction	 |	
583
independent companies for shares in the new company. This exchange does not 
necessarily involve any financial transactions. Alternatively, the acquiring com-
pany may decide to purchase some or all of the shares of the acquired company. 
In order to do so, it is likely that the acquiring company would need to offer to 
purchase the shares at a price in excess of the current market price of the shares 
of the acquired company.
There are three types of merger: horizontal, vertical and conglomerate. 
­Horizontal integration or horizontal merger involves firms producing the same 
products and services. The large majority of mergers are of this type. Recent 
examples of horizontal mergers include Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller 
(brewing) in 2016, and Microsoft and LinkedIn (hi-tech) in 2016. Horizontal 
mergers often attract the scrutiny of the competition authorities, because any 
reduction in the number of firms servicing a market, and in the availability of 
substitute products or services, may confer enhanced market power upon any of 
the survivors, and upon the merged company in particular. Therefore, vigilance 
is required to ensure that there are no negative effects on consumer welfare after 
the merger takes place, due to abuses of market power. Even if market power 
is increased, however, the detrimental effects on consumer welfare might be 
offset by improvements in the efficiency of the merged company, which might 
allow lower prices and consequent gains in consumer welfare. In such cases, the 
merger might be viewed as part of an evolutionary process whereby efficient 
firms prosper and inefficient firms disappear. Horizontal merger is the principal 
subject of this chapter.
Vertical integration or vertical merger involves firms operating at different 
stages of the same production process. Since a vertical merger does not necessar-
ily result in any reduction in the number of suppliers servicing a market, or in the 
availability of substitute products or services, any damage to consumer welfare 
is more complicated to assess. A vertical merger might increase market power at 
various stages of the supply chain, although this might follow on from associated 
actions such as foreclosure, rather than from the merger itself. Such actions are 
known as vertical restraints. Vertical integration and vertical restraints are the 
subjects of Chapters 20 and 21, respectively.
Conglomerate merger involves firms that produce different goods or services. 
A possible motive for a conglomerate merger is the exploitation of some element 
of commonality, such as sharing raw materials, technology or retail outlets. An 
example is the razor manufacturer Gillette, which acquired the battery manu-
facturer Duracell in order to exploit its retail operations in emerging markets. 
Economies of scope might give a producer a crucial cost advantage, enabling it 
to cut prices and force its competitors out of business. Conglomerate merger is 
examined in Chapter 23.
This chapter proceeds as follows. Section 19.2 examines profit-maximizing 
motives for horizontal mergers. Horizontal mergers might increase profitability 
through either or both of two channels: through the enhanced market power 
of the merged firm; or through efficiency gains or reductions in average costs 
achieved as a result of increases in scale or internal restructuring and rationaliza-
tion following the merger. Section 19.3 examines several alternative non-profit-
maximizing motives for horizontal mergers, some of which refer back to the 

584	
|	 19    ■    Horizontal mergers and strategic alliances
alternative (managerial and behavioural) theories of the firm that were examined 
in Chapter 4. It has long been observed that the level of merger activity tends to 
follow an irregular cyclical pattern, and that merger activity might be correlated 
to macroeconomic conditions. Section 19.4 examines merger waves, or cyclical 
variation in the pattern of merger activity. Section 19.5 considers the advantages 
and disadvantages of strategic alliances between two or more companies that 
operate in the same market. Strategic alliances, which may take the form of 
licensing arrangements or joint ventures, are interpreted as an alternative method 
for achieving cooperation between producers, which stop some distance short of 
a full-scale merger. Finally, Section 19.6 reviews some of the empirical literature 
related to the topic of horizontal mergers.
	
19.2	
Profit-maximizing motives for horizontal mergers
This section examines profit-maximizing motives for horizontal mergers. 
­Synergy, the most common justification given by senior management for hori-
zontal merger proposals, refers to the increased market power of the merged 
entity, and to the potential for cost savings through the realization of average 
cost savings due to economies of scale. Naturally, the managers of institutions 
involved in mergers prefer to emphasise cost savings rather than market power 
in their public statements. Case studies 19.1 and 19.2 provide illustrations of a 
merger apparently motivated by synergy considerations, and a merger proposal 
in which synergy may also have played a part.
Market power
Oligopoly as a market structure is characterised by interdependence (as shown 
in Chapters 7, 8 and 9). A firm’s success (or lack of success) depends on how 
its rivals act and react to its strategies. Interdependence creates uncertainty in 
strategic planning. One way of reducing uncertainty is for the firms to collude, 
either explicitly or tacitly, over prices, output levels, the extent of product dif-
ferentiation and so on. In cases where collusion is difficult to organise or control, 
horizontal integration might be seen as a viable alternative strategy. This is espe-
cially true when legislation on cartels and collusion is tightened.
A horizontal merger may leave the newly integrated firm with a larger mar-
ket share, or it may eliminate a close rival from the market. Either or both of 
these outcomes increases the ability of the merged firm to raise its price, with-
out having to worry about its rivals’ reactions. Furthermore, the merger may 
make collusion easier to achieve. With fewer firms operating in the industry, 
there is a better chance of being able to reach agreements and monitor compli-
ance. These outcomes may create concerns for the competition authorities. A 
merger is more likely to be regarded as anticompetitive if it not only increases 
the degree of seller concentration, but also makes the entry of new firms more 
difficult. The treatment of mergers as part of competition policy is discussed 
in Chapter 24.

	
	
	
19.2  Profit-maximizing motives for horizontal mergers	 |	
585
As well as increasing market power, a horizontal merger might be motivated 
by a desire to protect the dominance of an incumbent firm. For example, should 
a dominant incumbent be threatened by an entrant with a new product, it might 
attempt to acquire the entrant as a way of preserving the status quo. The alter-
native strategy might be to invest in the development of a rival product. To do 
so might take time and might carry a high financial risk. Acquisition of the rival 
firm might be a cheaper and less risky strategy, even if relatively generous terms 
are required for the takeover bid to be accepted. Equally, if international com-
petition threatens the dominance of a group of domestic firms, it is possible that 
a process of consolidation involving mergers between the domestic firms might 
be pursued to fight off the challenge.
Motta (2004) identifies several factors that influence the degree of market 
power following a merger:
■ Degree of seller concentration. If the industry is fragmented, then a merger 
between two small firms may have little effect on the level of competi-
tion. However, if a merger were to create an effective monopoly, then there 
would be issues of concern. A merger might increase the potential for col-
lusion and/or the formation of a cartel. As the number of firms decreases, 
it becomes administratively easier to organise common prices and guard 
against cheating. The US competition authorities provide guidelines based 
on the Herfindahl–Hirschman (HH) index concentration measure (see Sec-
tion 10.4). The US guidelines not only focus on the level of concentration 
but also on the changes in concentration brought about by the proposed 
merger.
■ Productive capacity of rivals. The ability of the merged firm to sustain a higher 
price is dependent on the capacity of its rivals to respond to the probable 
increase in their demand that follows from the higher price set by the merged 
firm. If they are unable to respond because they lack spare productive capac-
ity, the market power of the merged firm is enhanced.
■ The ease of entry. Market power is higher where entry is more difficult. How-
ever, the merger may encourage potential entrants if they believe that industry 
prices may rise.
■ Market demand. If the price elasticity of demand is low, there is more oppor-
tunity for an increase in price, and the merged firm has more market power.
■ The level of buyer concentration can act as a constraint on market power. If 
the merged firm were to increase its price, this may encourage large buyers to 
bargain more aggressively for a discount, or alternatively to set up their own 
upstream operations.
■ Acquisition of a failing firm. Any merger should be assessed by drawing com-
parisons with the situation if the merger had not taken place. If the merger 
involves the acquisition of a firm that would otherwise fail, the ­relevant 
comparison for the market power of the merged firm is with the mar-
ket power of the acquirer had the acquired firm exited, rather than been 
acquired.

|	 19    ■    Horizontal mergers and strategic alliances
Cost savings
One of the most common arguments in favour of horizontal mergers is that the 
combined size of two firms allows cost savings to be realised, to a greater extent 
than would be possible through internal expansion. The following classification 
of the sources of cost savings is based on Roller et al. (2001):
■ Rationalization. Suppose two firms own a number of plants, each operating 
at a different marginal cost. The differences in marginal cost might be due 
to differences in the quantities of the fixed (capital) input, differences in the 
technologies employed, or differences in the scale of production. Following a 
merger, the firm can shift production from the high marginal cost plants to the 
low marginal cost plants. This process should continue until marginal costs in 
all plants are the same. It may even be possible that rationalization requires 
some plants to close down altogether.
■ Economies of scale are realised when long-run average cost decreases as the 
scale of operation increases (see Section 2.2). To achieve economies of scale, it 
is important that the productive assets of the two firms are integrated. Accord-
ing to Parsons (2003), horizontal mergers in the US cable television industry 
during the 1990s allowed many firms to benefit from economies of scale in 
areas such as personnel, marketing, advertising and, importantly, the ability 
to exploit new fibre-optic and digital-server technologies. The trend towards 
merger and clustering led to many large cities being dominated by single cable 
companies. In the short run, however, integration involving dismantling exist-
ing capacity might be temporarily disruptive.
■ Research and development. The integration of research and development activ-
ity might allow cost savings, by eliminating unnecessary duplication of effort. 
Diffusion of new technology may be achieved more efficiently by an integrated 
organization. One firm may be technologically superior in all aspects of pro-
duction and marketing, and this advantage can be transferred to the merger 
partner. In this case, the superior firm does not benefit technologically from 
the merger. Alternatively, the two firms may have complementary skills and 
knowledge. Diffusion may take place in both directions, such that both part-
ners realise benefits. Since a horizontal merger reduces the number of com-
petitors, the merged firm may feel more confident in undertaking speculative 
R&D investment, since there is less risk of imitation by rivals. A merger could 
also protect a firm’s technology if there is a danger that it might be appropri-
ated by a rival. Accordingly, mergers internalise the benefits of research and 
development. Cassiman and Colombo (2006) examine 31 mergers since 1987, 
and find that the most important factors contributing to innovation are the 
extent of market relatedness, prior relationships and geographical location.
■ Purchasing economies. A horizontal merger increases the bargaining power of 
the integrated firm, which may be able to extract lower prices from its suppli-
ers. A merged firm may be able to secure a discount, even in the absence of 
bargaining power. A supplier may offer a non-linear price, such as a two-part 
tariff made up of a fixed fee and a price per unit (see Section 14.3). The second 
part of the tariff allows the firm to exercise price discrimination between high 

	
	
	
19.2  Profit-maximizing motives for horizontal mergers	 |	
587
and low users. The merger increases the purchasing requirement, allowing 
the integrated firm to spread the fixed fee over a larger volume. In addition, 
the integrated firm may be able to raise finance from the capital markets at a 
lower cost than its constituent parts.
■ Productive inefficiency and organizational slack. In the absence of competi-
tive pressure, a monopolist may fail to achieve efficiency in production (see 
Section 3.4). Technical inefficiency (x-inefficiency) is said to occur when a 
firm fails to achieve the maximum output that is technically feasible given 
the set of inputs it employs. Economic inefficiency occurs when a firm fails to 
employ the most cost-effective combination of inputs, given the current levels 
of factor prices. Closely related to the notion of productive inefficiency in the 
microeconomics literature is the idea of organizational slack in the organiza-
tional behaviour literature. By increasing the size and market power of the 
merged entity, a horizontal merger may reduce competitive pressure. This 
may increase the likelihood that the firm fails to achieve efficiency in produc-
tion, or that it operates with organizational slack. On the other hand, a highly 
active market for corporate ownership can help impose discipline by reducing 
the number of inefficient firms. A firm that fails to achieve efficiency in pro-
duction (or operates with too much slack) may find its share price reduced, 
making it an acquisition target. Potential new owners believe they can operate 
the business more efficiently, increasing profits and the firm’s share price (see 
Section 19.3).
Farrell and Shapiro (2000) suggest horizontal mergers which produce cost sav-
ings through economies of scale are relatively few in number. Where the poten-
tial exists for economies of scale, these can often be realised through internal 
expansion and do not require a merger. In assessing the benefits and costs of 
any specific merger, only merger-specific gains, which cannot be achieved in any 
other way, should be considered. Merger-specific gains, also known as synergies, 
include gains arising from the integration of specific, hard-to-trade assets owned 
by the merger partners. Some examples are as follows:
■ Coordinating joint operations. When two firms are linked by the joint manage-
ment of a resource, such as an oilfield, frequent contractual disputes might tend 
to increase costs. By reducing or eliminating disputes of this kind, a merger 
might result in cost savings.
■ Sharing complementary skills. Consider a situation where one firm is more 
skilled in manufacturing than a rival, while the rival is more skilled in distri-
bution. In time it might be possible for both firms to become skilled in their 
areas of current weakness, but a merger might enable this to happen sooner 
or more effectively. Similarly, one firm might own a patent that could be more 
fully or quickly exploited using another firm’s resources.
■ Improved interoperability. Two firms might develop what they consider to 
be separate products; for example, two pieces of software that can be used 
interchangeably by end-users. However, because the two pieces of software 
were developed separately, they may be incompatible when used jointly. 
Moves to develop compatible software may be thwarted if there is a culture 

588	
|	 19    ■    Horizontal mergers and strategic alliances
of competition between the two firms. By eliminating rivalry of this type, a 
horizontal merger may enable the benefits of compatibility or interoperability 
to be achieved more easily.
■ Network configuration. Suppose two firms operate a rail service between two 
cities, with each firm owning a single track. If each firm offers a return service, 
‘down’ trains meet ‘up’ trains, so passing points have to be built, making route 
planning more complex and creating the potential for delays. However, if the 
two firms merge, the two tracks can each be used to serve traffic in one direc-
tion, resulting in a cost saving through a synergy effect.
Case study 19.1
Investors grow more sceptical of extravagant 
healthcare deals
FT
Investors have become increasingly sceptical of high premiums being paid for blockbuster 
acquisitions in the healthcare sector, according to an analysis of market reaction to deals.
More than half the deals greater than $1bn proposed since the end of June have 
prompted a drop in the share price of the acquirer company in the next day’s trading — 
compared with only 31 per cent of such deals announced during the first half of the year. 
The souring in sentiment has been especially pronounced towards acquisitions in the 
biotech sector, with Shire’s $30bn approach for Baxalta and Actelion’s interest in ZS 
Pharma both failing to impress investors.
Industry executives and bankers said the fall in share prices reflected increasing caution 
about valuations after a 148 per cent increase in the Nasdaq biotech index over the past 
three years. Severin Schwan, chief executive of Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, 
told the Financial Times: ‘This bubble will burst . . . and people will look back and they 
will say, like with the internet crisis, what happened? Why didn’t we recognise this?’
Mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare sector have reached a record level over the 
past 18 months as drugmakers, medical device companies and, more recently, insurers 
have seized on ultra-low borrowing costs to hunt growth-boosting deals. During the 
recent boom in M&A, shareholders have broadly cheered acquiring companies on — a 
stark reversal of long-term dealmaking trends that has further encouraged executives 
to pursue transactions. Almost two-thirds of the 71 healthcare transactions proposed 
between the start of 2014 and the end of June this year prompted a rise in the acquirer’s 
share price.
But sentiment began to change in July, since when nine of 16 proposed deals have led to 
a fall in the acquirer’s share price, according to data from Dealogic. That shift coincided 
with a downturn in the Nasdaq biotech index, which has dropped 10 per cent from July’s 
record peak, although it remains 17.5 per cent higher than it was at the start of the year. 
One banker said the hefty premiums being demanded by target companies had become 
harder to justify after the long biotech bull run. ‘The premiums are still the same but on

a higher valuation,’ he said. ‘So investors are seeing higher risk in some of these M&A 
choices — not because the deals are riskier but because the prices may be.’
However, bankers say there is little sign of deal activity slowing and one large health-
care fund manager argued that the recent market correction would ease concern over 
valuations. ‘I don’t think we’re done [with M&A]. Gilead raising $10bn in debt means 
they are probably looking to make a move.’ Some healthcare deals are still being well 
received by investors, especially those in the generic drugs market where economies of 
scale are easier to achieve than in innovative pharmaceuticals. Shares in Teva rose 12 per 
cent after its $41bn acquisition of Allergan’s generic drugs unit in July, for example.

Case study 19.2
AB InBev to sell Peroni and Grolsch
FT
Anheuser-Busch InBev is aiming to head off European regulatory concerns over its pro-
posed £71bn acquisition of SABMiller by putting the Peroni and Grolsch brands that it 
would gain up for sale. AB InBev, which owns Stella Artois and Corona, is planning to 
put the two SABMiller brands up for sale, in attempt to head off concerns that the com-
bined entity will have too much dominance over Europe’s premium beer market, accord-
ing to a person familiar with the matter. Another person familiar with the deliberations 
said that while a sale was being considered, no formal process had been agreed and the 
plans were subject to change.
Earlier this month, Brussels-based AB InBev launched its formal takeover of London-
listed SABMiller in a deal to create a unified company that would earn half of the entire 
brewing industry’s profits. No price for the Peroni and Grolsch brands has been indicated 
but, according to the Sunday Times, which first reported the potential sale, they are 
expect[ing] to fetch billions. Potential buyers include Dutch group Heineken, US-based 
Molson Coors and Ireland’s C & C Group, makers of Bulmers and Magners ciders. AB 
InBev and SABMiller declined to comment. AB InBev has taken some other pre-emptive 
steps to convince global competition watchdogs to allow the world’s biggest brewing 
takeover to go through.
An agreement has been reached for Molson Coors to buy out SABMiller’s stake in 
their US joint venture MillerCoors, in a $12bn deal that is critical to gaining US regu-
latory approval for the larger combination. AB InBev’s takeover of SABMiller is also 
expected to come under scrutiny in China, where SAB produces Snow, the world biggest 
beer brand by volume, in a joint venture with China Resources Enterprise. In Europe, 
it is not clear whether the Brussels competition watchdogs will demand disposals by the

combined group — although AB InBev is likely to proceed with the Peroni and Grolsch 
sales regardless. Regulators generally get involved when a combined company would have 
market share of more than 40 per cent. In western Europe there is only one market that 
crosses this threshold — Belgium — where AB InBev has a 53.1 per cent market share.
Discarding SABMiller’s Belgian business, which has a 0.2 per cent market share, is not 
expected to [be] a major stumbling block. Analysts add that similarly small disposals in 
the Czech Republic might also be necessary. But if the European Commission decides to 
look at certain product lines, such as premium lager served in bottles, the takeover probe 
is likely to be more complicated. SABMiller’s Grolsch and Peroni compete with others in 
the category, such as AB InBev’s Stella Artois and Corona, particularly in key European 
markets such as the UK.
AB InBev’s takeover of SABMiller, dubbed ‘megabrew’ by the drinks industry, will 
give it a significant foothold in Africa, where it barely has a presence, and in parts of Latin 
America where it previously was not competitive It comes at a time when both brewers 
face a rising challenge in western markets from fast-growing small, craft brewers that are 
swallowing up sales. AB InBev expects to extract $1.4bn annually in synergies from the 
combination after four years. AB InBev has also secured a $75bn loan package to fund 
the acquisition, a move that appears designed to save million of dollars in fees.

Non-profit-maximizing motives for horizontal mergers
As shown in Section 4.3, non-profit-maximizing theories of the firm distin-
guish between the motives of shareholders and managers, and emphasise the 
strategic role of control and governance issues in the economic analysis of 
the firm. In accordance with this approach, a merger decision might be taken 
with a view to the maximization of the utility functions of a team of managers. 
A merger might be implemented in order to remove a team of weak or non-
profit-maximizing managers, or to produce greater leverage in competitive situ-
ations. This section examines what are termed non-profit-maximizing motives 
for horizontal merger.
Managerial discretion
Given the assumption of a divorce of ownership from control, and the existence 
of a principal–agent relationship between managers and shareholders, it has been 
argued that managers, rather than aiming to maximise profits, have discretion in 
the pursuit of alternative goals. One of these goals, suggested by Marris (1964), 
is the growth of the firm (see Section 4.3). Growth, rather than profit, serves as a 
performance indicator, and the status, power, survival and remuneration of the 
managers depend on achieving growth subject to a minimum profit requirement

591
to support the market valuation of the company. Rather than focus on internally 
generated growth, which might take time and involve risk, managers might aim 
for external growth through merger and acquisition.
Market for corporate control
Closely related to the managerial discretion hypothesis, Manne (1965) argues 
that, in an efficient capital market, incompetent managers and managers who 
act against the interests of shareholders, should be removed. If the market per-
ceives that the firm is underperforming, its market value declines, attracting the 
attentions of potential acquirers who believe they can use the firm’s productive 
assets more efficiently. The threat of merger or acquisition imposes discipline on 
the firm’s managers.
In reality, however, the importance of this constraint on the managers’ actions 
is debatable. First, a raider would need to access information about the tar-
get firm in order to identify possible sources of slack. Second, for the raider to 
make a profit, the offer price for shares would have to be less than the post-
merger share price. Existing shareholders might be reluctant to sell if they expect 
the share price to increase in the future. Third, the managers of the target firm 
may have developed poison pill strategies to frustrate a takeover raid. Examples 
include a deliberate increase in debt to make the firm less financially attrac-
tive; generous stock options to key employees that are cancelled in the event of 
acquisition; extended guarantees to customers in the event of acquisition; and 
staggered elections to the Board of Directors ensuring that, for a few years after 
the merger, the new managers face a hostile Board. This is also an important 
issue for the competition authorities. If competition policy is designed to make 
mergers difficult, the ability of the threat of acquisition to constrain the actions 
of underperforming or incompetent managers becomes diluted.
The threat of takeover is not the only factor that acts as a constraint on 
underperforming managers. First, regular market competition imposes a need 
for managerial efficiency to avoid bankruptcy. Second, large institutional share-
holders may be able to exercise control over the managers, if they have access to 
information and sufficient voting power. Finally, the managers themselves may 
hold shares in the firm, which would help align their interests more closely with 
those of the owners.
The failing firm hypothesis
Dewey (1961) claims that mergers are a ‘civilised alternative’ to bankruptcy, 
providing a mechanism for the transfer of the assets of a failing firm to a suc-
cessful firm. The successful firm might wish to acquire the failing firm for pos-
sible short-term financial advantage, such as using the losses of the failing firm 
to offset its own tax exposure (Mead, 1969). This depends on the relevant tax 
law. Alternatively, the merger might entail rationalization sufficient to ensure 
the future profitability of the industry. A few testable hypotheses are associ-
ated with the failing firm hypothesis. For example, acquiring firms should 
have higher profit rates than target firms. More mergers should occur during

recessions, when there are more failing firms. Tremblay and Tremblay (1988) 
report evidence of significant differences in the performance of acquiring and 
acquired firms in the US brewing industry. The average growth rate over a 
two-year period prior to a merger was 17.6 per cent for the acquiring firms 
and 11.1 per cent for the acquired firms. Other studies suggest little or no dif-
ference between the average performance of acquirers and acquired. In results 
summarised in Table 19.1, Gugler et al. (2003) report that the average profit 
rates of firms acquired in the US, the UK and continental Europe were lower 
than those of their acquirers, but the pattern was reversed in Japan, Australia, 
New Zealand and Canada. Buehler et al. (2006) find no evidence to support the 
failing firm hypothesis using Swiss data. Merger rates were particularly low in 
industries where bankruptcies were high, and merger rates tended to increase 
with macroeconomic growth.
The capital redeployment hypothesis
A motive for horizontal merger might exist if the owners or managers of a merged 
organization are able to perform the task of capital allocation within the organi-
zation more efficiently than the capital markets can when the two merger part-
ners are separate. Under an internal system of rewards and penalties, divisional 
managers might be provided with incentives to reveal information that helps 
central management to direct funding into the most effective uses. Such incen-
tives might be lacking in the case of an independent company raising finance 
from an external provider such as a bank. A provider of finance that holds the 
property rights in the residual value of the organization’s assets has more incen-
tive to monitor the performance of the divisions than an external provider. If one 
division of a merged organization performs badly, its assets can be reassigned to 
the other divisions. An external provider of finance to an independent company 
that fails might be forced to attempt to sell the assets, and might not be able to 
realise their full market value (Gertner et al., 1994).

593
The hubris hypothesis
Roll (1986) suggests that the valuation of target firms in takeover bids is often 
subject to hubris on the part of managers of the successful bidder. In other words, 
successful bidders tend to overestimate the value of their targets. Suppose there 
are several bidders for a target firm. The winner is the firm (the managers) whose 
valuation of the target firm is the highest and who lodge the highest bid. As 
shown in the discussion of the winner’s curse in Section 15.3, under rational 
expectations and randomly distributed bidding the average bid should be close 
to the true value of the firm, but the highest bid is likely to exceed the true value. 
Why then does anyone bid? Roll suggests most managers have few opportuni-
ties throughout their careers to be involved in the takeover of another firm. 
Therefore, most managers have little or no experience to draw on when attempt-
ing to judge whether their valuations of target firms are correct. Some of the 
empirical research is broadly supportive of the hubris hypothesis. For example, 
Dodd (1980) reports that acquirers suffered negative returns, while Bradley et al. 
(1983) report significant gains for target firms. Billett and Qian (2008) attributes 
a tendency for some managers to be over-confident in their own judgement to 
a ‘self-attribution bias’, whereby managers tend to award themselves credit for 
their past successes, but attribute their past failures to bad luck.
Case study 19.3
Empire builders fall prey to their vanity
FT
Just as confidence is vital to success, so overconfidence typically leads to downfall. And 
nowhere is such hubris more prevalent than when boardrooms suffer from acquisition mania.
A stunning recent example was the purchase by Cisco of Pure Digital, the parent com-
pany for the best-selling camcorder, Flip, in 2009 for $590m. Having owned the business 
for less than two years, Cisco announced last month that it was shutting it down – in 
spite of Flip’s enduring popularity. Now John Chambers, Cisco’s chief executive, might 
argue that he has grown the group from revenue of $1.2bn in 1995 to $40bn this year, 
and hence a write-off on the scale of the Flip debacle makes little difference to his overall 
achievements. Nevertheless, such an extraordinarily rapid and absolute destruction of 
value takes some doing – especially since Cisco has delivered much of its expansion via 
acquisitions. Yet the stock market appeared to approve of Cisco’s high-profile exit from 
consumer products. All public companies must dance to the whims of institutional inves-
tors, and these gyrations distort their M&A behaviour, because too often they are bullied 
to buy at the top and sell at the bottom.
However, there have been many, very much bigger mistakes than Flip. Recall the 
catastrophic purchase by Daimler of Chrysler for $38bn, or indeed the series of terrible 
deals done by Ford Motor in the 1990s, including Volvo for $6.5bn, Jaguar for $2.4bn, 
and Kwik-Fit for $1.6bn. At the time, Ford was embracing the idea of diversifying into 

594	
|	 19    ■    Horizontal mergers and strategic alliances
a services organization. Their stagnant core business was still throwing off lots of cash, 
which enabled the group to squander many billions in ill-advised purchases. Kwik-Fit was 
subsequently almost given away to private equity house CVC for a third of its original cost, 
just three years after its purchase. Typically, the architect of the strategy, Jacques Nasser, 
then departed and new management felt less shame in taking the loss and moving on. Ford 
refocused, and has just delivered record first-quarter net income of $2.6bn.
I was on the other side in a similar situation. We sold a restaurant business called My 
Kinda Town for about £56m in cash to Capital Radio in the 1990s. As a seller, I was 
baffled as to why a radio company was interested in our casual dining chain but I had 
not led the negotiations and assumed they knew what they were doing. Shockingly, the 
cheerleader for this curious diversification left the broadcaster within months. It soon 
became apparent that the acquirer could not manage its new division. Within a few years, 
it had broken the business up and sold off the pieces for a fraction of the purchase price. 
The rationale for the merger was flawed – the compelling synergy between entertainment 
and eating was an illusion.
Another disaster story was the acquisition of Snapple drinks by Quaker. In 1994, it 
paid $1.7bn, or almost 30 times earnings, for the beverage company. The objective was 
to integrate the business with its Gatorade soft drink operation. But the two businesses 
never gelled, and Snapple fell into a $75m loss. By 1997, it had been offloaded to Triarc 
for just $300m. It was yet another example of a huge mistake by a corporate behemoth.
One assumes rich public companies do exhaustive research into targets, and that they 
use the full extent of their industry expertise to analyse the risks and opportunities. But 
so often all that diligence appears to be a waste of money. Empire builders rarely know 
when to stop. When Stagecoach bought Coach USA in 1999 for £1.2bn, did it know what 
it was doing? The deal almost broke Stagecoach, and most of the US business was sold 
off at a substantial loss.
It is scary how often deals are done for reasons of ego or narcissism. Making attractive 
returns from acquisitions is extremely difficult, yet momentum, vanity and impatience too 
often play a big part in the process, especially in bidding wars and contested takeovers. 
And even veteran buyers can get carried away when the desire to possess an asset becomes 
overwhelming.

Merger waves
The UK’s economic history is peppered with ‘waves’ of merger activity. The 
twentieth-century decades of peak merger activity were: the 1920s, when mergers 
were motivated primarily by a desire to achieve economies of scale associated 
with the new mass-production techniques; the late 1960s and early 1970s, when 
mergers were actively encouraged by the UK government; and the 1980s and 
2000s, when renewed high levels of merger activity were prompted by increased

globalization and changes in corporate governance. This section examines the 
factors that have driven past merger waves, and reviews the UK experience since 
the 1950s.
Many empirical studies identify cyclical patterns in the level of merger activ-
ity, and claim there is a weak correlation with macroeconomic activity and stock 
market prices. Gort’s (1969) disturbance theory represents a natural starting 
point. Profit-maximizing explanations for merger (the pursuit of market power 
or cost savings through economies of scale) cannot adequately explain fluctua-
tions in the rate of merger activity. Gort argues that the number of mergers tends 
to increase when individuals form differing expectations of future income streams 
and the associated risks. Bidders will appear, whose estimates of the value of a 
firm’s assets exceed that of the firm’s owners. Differences between individual 
valuations are likely to emerge when economic disturbances alter investors’ 
expectations and make the future less predictable. Technology shocks, which 
render historical costs and prices redundant, thereby making future costs and 
prices hard to estimate, are a particularly potent source of disturbances of this 
kind. Other potential sources of disturbance include changes in the regulatory 
regime and a rising stock market. The latter creates uncertainty as to whether the 
increase in stock prices indicates that there has been a change in fundamentals, 
or whether it reflects a bubble, being driven primarily by speculation. When the 
stock market is rising, it becomes easier for acquirers to raise new capital with 
which to acquire other firms. Horizontal mergers may also be stimulated by 
increasing demand at the industry or sectoral level, as firms seek to acquire new 
capacity through mergers as an alternative to relying upon internally generated 
growth. Industry or sector-specific merger activity can then reinforce aggregate 
merger activity (Andrade et al., 2001; Harford, 2005).
Several real factors can be identified as potential drivers of increases in the 
level of merger activity. The growth of international markets, coupled with 
reductions in tariffs, has encouraged industries, often with government assis-
tance, to rationalise their production. Improvements in information and telecom-
munications technologies and networks have allowed the efficient development 
of multidivisional corporate structures.
The growth of financial intermediation has generated greater liquidity in the 
market for takeovers. Investment companies, insurance companies and pension 
funds have been attracted to invest directly in the corporate sector, including 
the purchase of debt or shares issued by firms in support of a merger strategy. 
Consequently, behavioural factors arising from the psychology of stock markets 
may contribute to merger waves. Gugler et al. (2012) examine whether real or 
behavioural factors drive merger waves. If real factors are to explain merger 
waves, then listed and unlisted firms should have similar levels of merger activ-
ity. Mergers involving listed US, UK and European firms occurred mostly in 
periods where stock valuations were high, suggesting that behavioural factors 
matter more than real factors in driving merger activity.
Prior to the 1980s, external mechanisms for corporate governance were weak 
and rarely used. The influence of institutional investors was limited, and inter-
nal corporate governance was bureaucratic and inefficient. During the 1980s, 
firms turned increasingly to debt as a source of finance, which required greater 

596	
|	 19    ■    Horizontal mergers and strategic alliances
financial discipline. Debt may be particularly attractive as a source of finance 
for mergers because interest payments are deducted from profits before taxa-
tion, reducing corporate tax exposure. In leveraged buyouts, where a substantial 
part of the price is paid with borrowed funds, financial sponsors will closely 
monitor and govern the firms they acquire. At the start of the twenty-first cen-
tury, voluntary and compulsory codes of practice for corporate governance were 
strengthened to ensure decisions were taken in the light of full information and 
the absence of conflicts of interest. Rossi and Volpin (2004) find the volume of 
merger activity is much higher in countries enjoying higher accounting standards 
and shareholder protection.
Figure 19.1 presents data on aggregate merger activity in the UK for the period 
1963–2007. The peaks come in the late 1960s, 1972–3, the late 1980s and 2003–7. 
Owen (2006) identifies three causes of the merger waves of the late 1960s and 
early 1970s. First, the internationalization of the world economy meant UK 
firms needed to achieve increases in scale in order to compete effectively with 
larger foreign firms, and to service larger international markets. Second, the UK 
government actively promoted mergers through the Industrial Reorganization 
Corporation, a quango with powers to exempt mergers from reference to the 
Monopolies and Mergers Commission (a forerunner of the present-day Compe-
tition and Markets Authority). Third, the 1956 Restrictive Trade Practices Act 
made cartel formation more difficult to achieve, forcing some firms to search for 
means of achieving rationalization other than through collusion. In contrast, the 
merger wave of the late 1980s had little to do with increasing the size of organiza-
tions. It was driven primarily by the perception that value could be extracted from

companies by means of merger deals that entailed corporate restructuring through 
leverage and buyouts, drawing heavily on techniques imported from the US and 
fuelled by financial deregulation and a buoyant stock market. The merger wave 
of the mid-2000s was driven primarily by mergers in specific industries, such as 
utilities, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals, aimed at realizing economies 
of scale and improving competitiveness in global markets. After 2008 the number 
of mergers and acquisitions per year fell dramatically, as the economy recovered 
slowly from the global financial crisis of 2007–09. Major factors identified by the 
ONS (2016) are the difficulty in securing credit, low company profits, difficulty 
in raising loans and generally low levels of confidence in the economic outlook.
	
19.5	
Strategic alliances
Inter-firm alliances are commonly seen as a viable alternative to mergers. An alli-
ance is defined as an ‘organizational structure to govern an incomplete contract 
between separate firms and in which each firm has limited control’ (Gomes-
Casseres, 2001). An incomplete contract is one that does not specify every duty 
and every responsibility of the parties under every conceivable circumstance. A 
strategic alliance is an incomplete contract, involving an agreement to cooperate, 
that is brokered without the parties being able to foresee at the outset every detail 
of how their relationship will subsequently evolve. According to the transaction 
costs literature, incomplete contracts tend to leave both parties vulnerable to the 
possibility of opportunistic behaviour from the other party. Internalization of the 
transaction through merger represents one possible solution to this problem. In 
the case of a strategic alliance, however, the partners anticipate that the long-run 
gains of a loose and flexible arrangement outweigh the costs arising from possible 
opportunistic behaviour in the short run.
Gomes-Casseres (2001) argues that an efficient alliance must be less costly to 
implement than a merger, and must generate positive synergies. Clearly, a full-
scale merger eliminates the potential transaction costs arising from the incom-
plete nature of the contract between the alliance partners. For an alliance to be 
the preferred solution, therefore, it must be less costly than a merger. In some 
cases a merger might be unfeasible due to regulatory or political opposition (for 
example, in the case of the takeover of a domestic firm by a foreign firm in cer-
tain countries). Alternatively, the costs of full integration may be prohibitive. 
A successful takeover might require the bidder to pay more than the current 
market value of the target firm in order to persuade enough shareholders of 
the latter to sell. The costs of post-merger rationalization might be prohibitive, 
as all resources and capabilities have to be integrated, rather than just selected 
capabilities in the case of the alliance.
Positive synergies arise when the total value of the capabilities of the part-
ners within the alliance is greater than when these capabilities were employed 
independently. According to Dyer et al. (2004), modular synergies arise from 
resources that are managed independently but whose results are pooled. For 

598	
|	 19    ■    Horizontal mergers and strategic alliances
example, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft pool their systems and their software 
respectively to offer customers a seamless solution to their computing needs. 
Sequential synergies are tasks which, when completed, are forwarded to partners 
to add further value. For example, a pharmaceutical firm might develop a new 
drug, but pass the responsibility for seeking government approval for its mar-
keting campaign to a partner with more experience in dealing with government 
departments. Reciprocal synergies deliver value through an iterative process of 
continual customization of resources, to ensure an optimal fit.
A fundamental difference between mergers and alliances is that mergers driven 
by market prices are competitive, and risky in the sense that once a merger has 
been completed it may be either irreversible or at least difficult and expensive 
for the two entities to subsequently decouple. Alliances are typically negotiated, 
cooperative in nature, and less risky because it is straightforward to terminate the 
agreement and for the parties to go their separate ways. Alliances can be formed 
in many different guises, determined by the objectives of the agreement, the con-
trol of assets and the managerial structure. For example, firms might enter into 
a joint research and development initiative, a joint marketing programme, a 
licensing agreement or a jointly owned venture such as the construction of a large 
infrastructure project. An alliance might be formed between firms with similar 
capabilities, or it might seek to combine the technological skills of one firm with 
the marketing skills of another. Alliances can be either horizontal or vertical 
(discussed further in Chapter 20).
Figure 19.2 illustrates one approach to classifying alliances in terms of the 
level of integration (Pekar and Margulis, 2003). Outsourcing is located on the 
left-hand side of the diagram and merger on the right-hand side. Alliances occupy 
the middle ground. Moving from left to right implies an increase in integra-
tion and a decreasing reliance on contractual market transactions. The weak-
est form of alliance is the licensing agreement, which is governed by contract,

requiring limited cooperation between the two parties. A licence is a contractual 
right which gives permission for one party to use an activity or property owned 
by another. With intellectual property rights such as software, the owner or 
‘licensor’ charges a fee to the user or ‘licensee’. Collaborative alliances include 
agreements over projects such as research and development programmes. Equity 
alliances involve some degree of common or cross-ownership of resources. Under 
partial acquisition, one partner holds a minority stake in the equity of another; 
and under partial cross-ownership each partner holds equity in the other. Joint 
ventures include agreements between partners to create a new entity to exploit 
a business opportunity, or to form a consortium to buy a company that will 
fill a gap in their joint competences. For example, in 2007 Sony Ericsson and 
Motorola formed a joint venture to develop software for mobile telephones. 
Motorola agreed to take a 50 per cent interest in UI Holdings, which had been 
acquired by Sony Ericsson a few months earlier.
	
19.6	
Horizontal mergers: some empirical evidence
The empirical evidence as to whether horizontal mergers lead to increased profit-
ability through the synergy effects of increased market power or cost savings is, 
on the whole, inconclusive. For example, Cosh et al. (1980) compare profitability 
during a five-year period before a number of UK mergers with profitability dur-
ing the five years following the merger. The merged firms experienced an increase 
in average profitability. By contrast, Meeks (1977) finds that profitability fell on 
average during a seven-year period following a merger. Rydén and Edberg (1980) 
find merged Swedish firms experienced lower profitability than a control group.
Ravenscraft and Scherer (1987) examine the pre-merger profitability of 634 
US target firms in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The target firms’ profitability 
(ratio of operating income to assets) was 20 per cent, much higher than the aver-
age profitability of all firms of 11 per cent. Using a different sample, Ravenscraft 
and Scherer report a negative effect of merger on post-merger profitability. In 
contrast, Healy et al. (1992) report that while performance declined on aver-
age following the largest 50 US mergers between 1979 and 1984, it fell by less 
than the industry averages for the firms involved. Pesendorfer (2003) examines 
the effect of mergers in the US paper industry during the mid-1980s. Post-1984 
(when merger guidelines were revised to allow a more liberal interpretation by 
the competition authorities) 31 mergers occurred. The analysis suggests that cost 
savings were typically realised post-merger. One way of testing the effects of 
merger on market power is to compare pre- and post-merger prices. In a sur-
vey of nine such studies, Weinberg (2007) finds that only a minority of mergers 
resulted in higher prices. Kwoka (2013) uses a sample of 46 mergers investigated 
by antitrust authorities in the US to assess the effects of mergers. He finds that 
Prices increased following the merger in 38 of the 46 cases analysed. Ashenfelter 
et al. (2014) conduct a meta-analysis of 49 mergers in 21 industries spanning a 
30-year period, including the airline, banking, hospital and petroleum industries 
are most frequently covered by these retrospectives. In the majority of cases, 
prices increased following the merger.

Gugler et al. (2003) report a large-scale study of around 15,000 mergers world-
wide, over the period 1981–99. The aim is to examine whether mergers are moti-
vated by an objective of increasing market power, reducing costs or furthering 
managerial aims such as growth maximization. The test for market power is 
based on sales and profit data. A merged firm with increased market power 
should increase price, moving onto a more inelastic portion of its demand func-
tion. While profits increase, sales tend to fall. The test for cost savings is based 
on the notion that a reduced marginal cost leads to a reduction in price and an 
increase in both profit and sales. If managerial objectives are dominant, neither 
costs nor profit need be affected in the long run although, in the short run, costs 
are incurred in integrating the two organizations. Therefore both profit and sales 
may tend to fall. A broad conclusion is that just over half of the mergers resulted 
in profits greater than would have been expected had the merger not occurred. 
A similar proportion resulted in a fall in sales. The combination of rising profit 
and falling sales is consistent with the market power hypothesis. Gugler and 
Szücs (2016) use a dataset of 241 mergers over the period 1990–2007 to assess the 
effects of mergers on rival firms. The econometric techniques disentangle market 
power and efficiency effects. On average, market power effects (evidenced by the 
increase in profits of rival firms following a merger) outweighed any efficiency 
gains following the mergers.
An alternative approach to analysing the performance of merged firms is to 
study the effect of merger announcements on the stock market prices of the 
firms involved, using an event study. An event study compares a company’s share 
price immediately before and after the occurrence of an event that is expected 
to influence the firm’s market valuation. Share prices reflect the present value 
of investors’ estimates of potential future profits. If investors expect a merger 
to result in greater market power or future cost savings, the share prices of the 
merger partners should increase. Empirical studies focus on the share prices of 
the target firms, the bidding firms, or a combination of both. For example, Brad-
ley et al. (1988) examine 236 US merger bids between 1963 and 1984, and find 
that the mean increase in share prices was 32 per cent. Schwert (1996) examines 
1,814 US target firms in both successful and unsuccessful merger bids between 
1975 and 1991, and calculates an average share price increase of 17 per cent. 
However, Jarrell et al. (1988) find evidence of share price reductions for bidding 
firms during the 1980s. Roller et al. (2001) report that, across a large number of 
studies, the average gains of target firms are around 30 per cent, while bidding 
firms tended to break even on average. Noting the wide divergence of results 
from a large number of event studies, Mueller and Sirower (2003) examine 168 
mergers during the period 1978–90. They find evidence to support the manage-
rial discretion hypothesis and the hubris hypothesis (see Section 19.3), but little 
evidence of synergies resulting from mergers producing increased profitability 
for shareholders.
Hannah and Kay (1981) find mergers played an important role in increasing 
seller concentration in the UK over the period 1919–69. Furthermore, if growth 
attributable to merger was excluded, small firms would have grown by more than 
large firms. Accordingly, ‘[m]erger has been the dominant force in increasing con-
centration in the UK since 1919 . . . Its role has been growing and it now accounts

for essentially all of currently observed net concentration increase’ (Hannah and 
Kay, 1981, p. 312). However, Hart (1981) suggests Hannah and Kay may have 
overstated the impact of mergers on concentration: ‘even if all the 122 large 
mergers [involving over £5 million] had been prohibited, aggregate concentration 
would have continued to increase’ (Hart, 1981, p. 318). As a cause of increasing 
concentration, mergers are less important than internal growth. Pautler (2003) 
surveys the empirical literature based on event studies, accounting data studies, 
structure–conduct–performance studies which examine the impact of mergers 
upon competition, and case studies. The latter includes not only survey-based 
(interview) methods, but also studies based on the analysis of pre-merger and 
post-merger financial performance.
Overall, the empirical literature suggests many mergers have not succeeded in 
increasing the profitability of the merged organization. Perhaps there is a system-
atic tendency to underestimate the practical difficulties involved in linking dif-
ferent product and distribution systems. Merged information systems may prove 
to be inefficient, and senior managers may face distorted information flows for 
a significant period after the merger. Finally, if the two parties to a merger have 
separate and incompatible corporate cultures, staff from the two firms may find 
it difficult to integrate. The empirical evidence on the importance of horizontal 
merger as a factor driving trends in seller concentration also appears to be rather 
mixed and inconclusive.

Summary
A merger takes place when two independent companies join together to form 
a single company. There are three types of merger: horizontal, vertical and 
conglomerate. Horizontal integration or horizontal merger, the subject of this 
chapter, involves the combination of two (or more) firms producing the same 
products and services. Vertical and conglomerate merger are examined separately 
in Chapters 20 and 23, respectively.
The motives for horizontal merger are examined under the headings of profit-
maximizing and non-profit-maximizing motives. Profit-maximizing motives for 
horizontal merger involve the pursuit of synergies, either through an enhance-
ment of the market power of the merged entity, or through the pursuit of sav-
ings in average costs through rationalization or economies of scale. Enhanced 
market power may derive from the ability of the merged firm to eliminate threats 
from substitute producers, securing an effective monopoly position or produc-
ing suitable conditions for collusion. Cost savings are realised when a merger 
results in the rationalization of production, acting as a driver towards the use of 
more efficient technology or the exploitation of financial or purchasing econo-
mies. Mergers may also produce synergies through the integration of hard-to-
trade assets, such as joint operations, sharing complementary skills and network 
configurations.
Non-profit-maximizing motives focus on the interaction of principals and 
agents, and the set of rules which govern their institutions. Horizontal merger 
might be a vehicle for the exercise of managerial discretion, for example in the 

602	
|	 19    ■    Horizontal mergers and strategic alliances
case of a team of managers intent on the pursuit of growth rather than profit-
ability. The threat of acquisition might be seen as an instrument for imposing 
discipline on underperforming managers in an efficiently functioning market for 
corporate control. Similarly, according to the failing firm hypothesis, merger 
might be seen as a means of transferring the assets of failing firms into more 
effective corporate ownership and control. The capital redeployment hypothesis 
emphasises the benefits of integration for information flows within the merged 
organization, and the possibility that this might lead to a more efficient allo-
cation of capital resources than capital markets themselves can achieve in the 
absence of perfect information. Finally, the hubris hypothesis emphasises the 
tendency for successful bidders in the market for corporate control to be overly 
optimistic in their assessment of the potential benefits of a merger. Historically, 
the level of merger activity has been highly cyclical, suggesting that macroeco-
nomic, institutional, technological and regulatory changes may all play a role in 
influencing the demand for integration.
Horizontal merger is only one of several ways in which strategic relationships 
can be developed between two or more firms. It is useful to think of a continuum 
of relationships, stretching from outsourcing at one extreme, via various forms 
of strategic alliance such as licensing, shared resources and competences, shared 
equity and joint ventures in the middle of the continuum, through to full-scale 
merger or acquisition at the opposite extreme.
On the whole, the empirical literature suggests that many mergers have not 
succeeded in increasing the profitability of the merged organization. A wide 
range of methodologies has been used to examine the impact of mergers on 
financial performance and on pricing and competition. These include: event stud-
ies based on stock market (share price) data; accounting data studies based on 
financial statement analysis; structure–conduct–performance studies which seek 
to measure the impact on pricing, concentration, competition and consumer 
welfare; and case studies based on surveys or the analysis of the pre-merger and 
post-merger performance in individual cases. In the absence of compelling evi-
dence of synergy effects from a large number of studies based on several comple-
mentary methodologies, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that many mergers 
have been motivated by non-profit considerations, or simple hubris on the part 
of decision-takers.

Introduction
The topic of vertical relationships covers a wide range of issues involving firms 
operating at different stages of the same production process. Vertical integra-
tion refers to a situation where a single firm has ownership and control over 
production at successive stages of a production process. Activities located at the 
initial stages of a production process are known as upstream activities, and those 
located closer to the market for the final product are known as downstream activi-
ties. Therefore upstream (or backward) vertical integration refers to a situation 
where a firm gains control over the production of inputs necessary for its own 
operation; and downstream (or forward) vertical integration refers to a situation 
where a firm gains control over an activity that utilises its outputs. Since capacity

may differ at different stages of production, even a vertically integrated firm may 
have to rely on external market transactions to achieve its required capacity. 
Balanced vertical integration occurs if capacities at successive stages are equal.
The earliest explanations for vertical integration tended to focus on issues 
such as the desire to secure enhanced market power; the technological benefits 
of linking successive stages of production; the reduction in risk and uncertainty 
associated with the supply of inputs or the distribution of a firm’s finished 
product; and the avoidance of taxes or price controls. Section 20.2 describes 
motives for vertical integration associated with the enhancement of market 
power. ­Section 20.3 describes motives associated with cost savings. This discus-
sion starts by interpreting vertical integration as a strategy for reducing trans-
action costs (see also Section 5.3), and interprets the various opportunities for 
cost savings using a transaction costs framework. Section 20.4 discusses reasons 
why firms may consider a strategy of vertical disintegration, disengaging from 
involvement at some stages of the production process. Section 20.5 reviews 
some of the empirical evidence on the motivations for and consequences of 
vertical integration.
As an alternative to vertical integration, some firms may decide to develop ver-
tical relationships of a looser nature than full-scale vertical integration. Advan-
tages include the preservation of some (or all) of both parties’ independence, 
and the avoidance of costs that might be associated with vertical integration. 
Examples of agency or vertical relationships that stop short of full-scale integra-
tion include franchising, involving a specific contractual agreement between a 
franchisor and franchisee; and networks of independent firms that are linked 
vertically, and establish non-exclusive contracts or other relationships with one 
another. Franchising and networks are examined in Section 20.6.
	
20.2	
Motives for vertical integration: enhancement  
of market power
A major debate in industrial organization concerns the implications of verti-
cal integration for market power. This section examines a number of incentives 
for vertical integration that raise issues concerning possible uses and abuses of 
market power.
Double marginalization
One of the strongest arguments in favour of vertical integration derives from an 
analysis of the problem of double marginalization or double markup (Spengler, 
1950; Machlup and Taber, 1960; Tirole, 1988). Consider an industry in which 
there are two vertical stages: an upstream production stage and a downstream 
retail stage. The problem of double marginalization arises when the produc-
tion stage is under the monopoly control of a single producer, the retail stage is 
under the monopoly control of a single retailer, and both the producer and the 
retailer add their own markups to the price. The outcome is that price is higher 

606	
|	 20    ■    Vertical integration
and output is lower than in the case where the two stages are vertically integrated 
with a single monopoly producer–retailer.
Although the problem of double marginalization arises only in the case where 
both the production and retail stages are monopolised, in theory it is possible 
for both of these stages to be either competitive or monopolised. In order to 
develop the analysis of double marginalization, it is useful to analyse the four 
possible combinations of competition and monopoly that could arise. These are 
illustrated in Figures 20.1 to 20.4.
In Figure 20.1, D2 is the market demand function faced by the competitive 
retailers and MC1 is the marginal cost function of the competitive producers. The 
producers sell to the retailers at a price of P1, equal to the producers’ marginal 
cost, MC1. Therefore, P1 = MC1 = MC2 becomes the retailers’ marginal cost 
function. The retailers sell an output of Q1 to consumers at a price of P1, equal 
to the retailers’ marginal cost; therefore the market price is P1. Producer surplus 
(abnormal profit) is zero, and consumer surplus is P1AB.
In Figure 20.2, D2 and MC1 represent the monopoly retailer’s market demand 
function and the competitive producers’ marginal cost function, as before. MR2 
represents the retailer’s marginal revenue function. The producers are competi-
tive, so they sell to the retailer at a price of P1, equal to the producers’ marginal 
cost, MC1. As before P1 = MC1 = MC2 is the retailer’s marginal cost function. 
In this case, however, the monopoly retailer sets MR2 = MC2, and sells an out-
put of Q2 to consumers at a market price of P2. The competitive producers earn 
zero abnormal profits, but the monopoly retailer earns an abnormal profit of 
P1P2CD. The combined producer surplus is P1P2CD, and consumer surplus is 
P2AC. The usual deadweight loss associated with monopoly is DCB.
In Figure 20.3, the monopoly producer knows the price it sets will become the 
competitive retailers’ marginal cost function. The retailers will trade at a price 
equal to their marginal cost, and will sell whatever quantity the market will bear 
at this price. Therefore, D2, the market demand function facing the retailers, is

also the producer’s demand function, D1. Accordingly, MR1 is the producer’s 
marginal revenue function. MC1 is the producer’s marginal cost function, as 
before. The producer sets MR1 = MC1 and sells an output of Q2 at a price of 
P2. P2 becomes the competitive retailers’ marginal cost function, MC2, so they 
sell the output of Q2 to consumers at a market price of P2. The monopoly pro-
ducer earns an abnormal profit of P1P2CD, but the competitive retailers earn 
zero abnormal profit. As before, the combined producer surplus is P1P2CD, 
and consumer surplus is P2AC. The only difference between this case and the 
previous one is that in Figure 20.2 the abnormal profit of P1P2CD accrues to 
the monopoly retailer, while in Figure 20.3 the same abnormal profit accrues to 
the monopoly producer.

|	 20    ■    Vertical integration
Finally, Figure 20.4 shows the case of double marginalization. The monop-
oly producer knows the price it sets will become the monopoly retailer’s mar-
ginal cost function, and it also knows the retailer will sell a quantity such that 
the retailer’s marginal revenue and marginal cost are equal. In other words, 
the quantity that is sold to consumers (also the quantity the producer can sell 
to the retailer) is located using the retailer’s marginal revenue function MR2. 
Effectively, MR2 represents the producer’s demand function, D1. The producer 
maximises profit by setting the marginal revenue associated with this demand 
function, MR1, equal to the producer’s marginal cost, MC1 (as before). The 
producer sells an output of Q3 at a price of P2, which becomes the retailer’s mar-
ginal cost function, MC2. The retailer maximises profit by setting the marginal 
revenue associated with the market demand function, MR2, equal to MC2. The 
retailer sells the output of Q3 to consumers at a market price of P3. The monop-
oly producer earns an abnormal profit of P1P2FG and the monopoly retailer 
earns an abnormal profit of P2P3EF. The combined producer surplus is P1P3EG, 
and consumer surplus is P3AE. However, P1P3EG 6 P1P2CD, because P1P2CD 
is the maximum profit that can be earned from a market demand function of 
D2 when the marginal cost function is MC1. Moreover P3AE 6 P2AC, and the 
deadweight loss of GEB is larger in Figure 20.4 than the equivalent deadweight 
loss of DCB in Figures 20.2 and 20.3.
Figure 20.2 can be used again to illustrate the profit-maximizing price and 
output in the case where the producer and retailer are vertically integrated. In this 
case, MC1 is the integrated producer–retailer’s marginal cost function, and D2 is 
its market demand function. The integrated firm sells an output of Q2 to consum-
ers at a market price of P2. The integrated firm earns an abnormal profit (pro-
ducer surplus) of P1P2CD, and consumer surplus is P2AC. Both consumers and 
the integrated producer–retailer are better off than in the double marginalization 
case (Figure 20.4), and the deadweight loss is reduced from GEB (­Figure 20.4) to 
DCB. In the double marginalization case, the problem facing the non-integrated

producer is that the retailer’s additional markup operates against the producer’s 
interests, by reducing the output that is sold to a level below the producer’s profit-
maximizing output. However, there are some other possible solutions to this prob-
lem for the producer, short of full-scale vertical integration. One solution might 
be to impose a maximum resale price. Another might be to require the retailer to 
stock an output of Q2, the alternative being that the retailer receives no supplies 
at all. These practices are examined in further detail in Chapter 21.
Forward vertical integration
If a monopolist supplies input A to a competitive downstream industry which 
produces output X, by entering the downstream industry the monopolist could 
use its control over the supply of inputs to become the dominant firm. But is this 
worthwhile? The traditional answer is that the monopolist has no incentive to 
integrate forward if industry X is already competitive. The monopolist cannot 
produce X any more cheaply. However, if industry X is not competitive and 
efficient in production, cost savings could be achieved through vertical integra-
tion. For example, expenditure on marketing could be reduced, or lower stock 
levels could be maintained.
This argument, known as the Adelman–Spengler hypothesis (Adelman, 1949; 
Spengler, 1950), is based on an assumption of fixed factor proportions. Suppose, 
however, firms in industry X can vary the proportions used of the input A and a 
substitute input B that is produced under competitive conditions; in other words, 
suppose input substitution is possible. The supplier of A might have an incen-
tive to integrate vertically with firms in industry X (Vernon and Graham, 1971; 
Scherer and Ross, 1990) for the following reasons. In Figure 20.5, the isoquant 
x1 shows combinations of A and B that can be used to produce x1 units of the 

610	
|	 20    ■    Vertical integration
output X. Prior to vertical integration, the isocost line is C1C1. The relatively 
steep slope of C1C1 reflects the ratio of the monopoly price charged for A and 
the competitive price (equal to the marginal cost) of B. The economically efficient 
(lowest-cost) method of producing x1 is represented by point D. If input A were 
supplied at marginal cost, the isocost line passing through D would be C2C2. The 
shallower slope of C2C2 reflects the ratio of the marginal cost of A to the competi-
tive price (marginal cost) of B. The abnormal profit of the monopoly supplier of 
A (measured in units of B) is represented by the vertical distance C1C2.
If the monopoly supplier of A integrates into industry X, however, the relevant 
cost per unit of A is not the monopoly price, but the marginal cost of producing 
A. With the new relative factor prices, it is no longer economically efficient to 
produce x1 units of X at point D. Instead, to produce x1, the vertically integrated 
firm should switch to point E on the lower isocost line C3C3. By doing so, a fur-
ther cost saving (again measured in units of B) of C2C3 is achieved. Furthermore, 
since the cost of producing X has fallen, it might be profitable to increase produc-
tion of X to a higher level than x1 (not shown in Figure 20.5). C2C3 is therefore 
a lower bound for the increase in the profit of the vertically integrated firm. If 
it is optimal to produce more than x1, profit must increase by more than C2C3.
Backward vertical integration
Suppose an industry is monopolised by firm A. Effectively, firm A imposes a ‘tax’ 
on the users of A’s output in industry B, in the form of a monopoly price. As 
shown in Figure 20.6, industry B firms have an incentive to vertically integrate 
backward. Firm B5 is able to produce an alternative input (B A), and does so if it 
considers firm A’s price to be excessive. The incentive only exists if firm B5 can 
replace A’s activity at a cost lower than the price charged by A. If a monopolist 
feels some of its customers are actively pursuing a policy of backward vertical 
integration to avoid the ‘tax’, it may be willing to accommodate them with special 
price concessions, in order to avoid losing their custom.
A mid-1980s example involving forward vertical integration is News Interna-
tional’s reluctance to use the UK’s railway network to distribute its newspapers 
Figure 20.6  Backward vertical integration: case 1

611
to wholesalers. News International instead used its own subsidiary TNT, a road 
haulage company (Monopolies and Mergers Commission, 1993). Oi and Hunter 
(1965) analyse the conditions under which firms might develop their own private 
distribution channels, rather than rely on contracting carriers through the market.
Another case in which a firm might consider backward vertical integration 
is illustrated in Figure 20.7. Firm B1, one of a number of firms in downstream 
industry B, has been seeking to secure control over an essential input produced 
by upstream industry A, by vertically integrating backward and acquiring firms 
A1 to A5. To prevent B1 from gaining monopoly control over the A industry, 
firm B5 vertically integrates backward by acquiring firm A6. In the long run, rival 
suppliers such as A7 might enter in order to challenge the emerging monopoly, 
but in the short run it would be extremely damaging for B5 to allow A6 to go the 
same way as A1 to A5 and fall into B1’s ownership. B5’s non-integrated competi-
tors B2, B3 and B4 are already weakened, because they have no alternative other 
than to buy from the A firms that have been acquired by B1.
Price discrimination
Vertical integration could provide a means for implementing a policy of price 
discrimination, which might otherwise be ineffective or ruled unlawful by the 
competition authorities. As discussed earlier (see Section 14.3), three conditions 
are required for successful price discrimination. First, the supplier must exercise 
monopoly control over the market. Second, the price elasticities of demand must 
be different for different classes of buyer. Third, the supplier must ensure that no 
resale or seepage occurs: customers who can buy at the lower price cannot resell 
to customers who are charged the higher price.
The Alcoa case in the US (Perry, 1980; Stuckey, 1983) involved a monopoly 
supplier of aluminium, which sold to both the aircraft industry and the kitchen 
utensils industry (pots and pans). Many substitute materials can be used to 
produce pots and pans, so the price elasticity of demand is high and the price-
discriminating supplier sets a low price. In the aircraft industry there are few 
Figure 20.7  Backward vertical integration: case 2

612	
|	 20    ■    Vertical integration
substitutes for aluminium, so the elasticity is low and the price is high. This sug-
gests kitchen utensils producers have an incentive to resell surplus aluminium 
ingots to the aircraft industry. By forward vertical integration into the kitchen 
utensils industry the aluminium supplier can prevent seepage, and can perhaps 
more easily conceal the policy of price discrimination.
	
20.3	
Motives for vertical integration: cost savings
Williamson (1971, 1975, 1989, 2002) argues that vertical integration may enable 
the integrated firm to reduce transaction costs. ‘[T]he firm is not a simple effi-
ciency instrument . . . but possesses coordinating potential that sometimes tran-
scends that of the market’ (Williamson, 1971, p. 112). As shown earlier (see 
Sections 5.2 and 5.3), Williamson’s transaction costs paradigm is based on Coa-
se’s (1937) seminal article on the nature of the firm. Coase raises the fundamental 
question as to why firms exist within a market economy. Coase argues that there 
are costs associated with the use of the price mechanism to allocate resources and 
coordinate economic activity. Within a firm, coordination is achieved through 
management direction and not through the price mechanism. The supersession 
of the price mechanism is the defining characteristic of the firm.
In cases where the market fails to work well, and a particular transaction proves 
costly to execute through the market, there may be a cost saving if the firm inter-
nalises that transaction. In other words, the market fails in the case of any trans-
action involving costs that could be reduced by substituting internal organization 
for external market exchange. Accordingly, whenever there is a large differential 
between the costs of external (market) coordination and internal organization for 
transactions involving producers at successive stages of a production process, there 
is an incentive for vertical integration. Many of the cost-savings explanations for 
vertical integration can be located within the transaction costs framework.
Technological conditions
A familiar argument for vertical integration is that technical conditions may 
dictate that production should be integrated under one coordinating unit. In the 
steel industry, for example, blast furnaces that produce steel and the strip mills 
that shape and cut steel are not only controlled by the same firm, but are also 
located within the same plant so as to conserve heat. In general, where there are 
closely related or technologically complementary production processes, a verti-
cally integrated firm may be able to achieve better planning and coordination, 
longer production runs and better use of capacity. In many cases, however, this 
justification for vertical integration does not lead to vertical merger because, if 
such obvious technological advantages exist, it is likely that integrated plants 
have been built from the outset. One might even argue that the two successive 
stages of production have really evolved into one stage. However, technological 
change may create new opportunities for integration.
Williamson (1989) suggests the technical economies realised through com-
mon ownership of technologically adjacent production processes are often

613
exaggerated. Closely related technical processes may be integrated because the 
alternative of achieving coordination using market mechanisms is too expensive. 
For example, the costs of drawing up and monitoring a contract between an 
owner of a blast furnace and an owner of a steel mill would be prohibitively high. 
Any attempted contract would probably be incomplete, because the codification 
of the obligations and responsibilities of both parties under all circumstances that 
could conceivably arise is impossible.
Uncertainty
Uncertainty creates a number of problems affecting firms’ efforts to organise pro-
duction. Coordination requires foresight concerning many possible events, some 
of which can be predicted while others cannot. As noted earlier (see Section 4.4), 
Simon (1959) coins the term bounded rationality to describe the limited ability of 
economic agents to absorb and process the information needed to make opti-
mal decisions. Helfat and Teece (1987) discuss two types of uncertainty. Primary 
uncertainty arises from factors external to the firm, such as technological change, 
change in consumer demand, and change in government policy. Secondary uncer-
tainty arises from a lack of information available to the firm’s decision-makers. 
Vertically adjacent firms may fail to disclose information to each other; or even 
worse, may distort information in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage.
A vertically integrated firm may also be able to take advantage of opportuni-
ties to conceal information. When a vertically integrated firm produces goods for 
its own consumption, it avoids making publicly observable market transactions. 
In certain cases this can create uncertainty in the minds of rivals. Transactions 
between firms at different stages of production are subject to several forms of 
uncertainty. For example, raw material supplies might be affected by political 
instability or climatic variation, which may interfere with the smooth flow of 
inputs. Many prices do not adjust automatically to ensure a balance between sup-
ply and demand. The firm never knows the exact demand for its product in the 
short term. The adjustment of production in response to fluctuations in demand 
is not instantaneous; decisions often have to be taken in the absence of any clear 
price signal; and the firm is at risk of over- or underproducing. However, some 
of these uncertainties can be reduced through vertical integration. An integrated 
firm might obtain information about changing supply and demand conditions 
earlier than a non-integrated firm (Arrow, 1975; Carlton, 1979).
Another possible cause of uncertainty is the quality of the inputs. Without 
directly observing a supplier’s production process, a firm is faced with the risk 
that it may be in receipt of substandard inputs. The desire to monitor the pro-
duction of inputs may provide an incentive for vertical integration. In the food 
industry, for example, the cost of determining quality is a significant transaction 
cost involved in the marketing of intermediate goods (Hennessy, 1997).
Uncertainty need not always lead to vertical integration. In an industry char-
acterised by rapid technological change, a firm might be able to manage risk and 
uncertainty most effectively by buying in its inputs, rather than producing them 
itself. Jacobson and Andréosso-O’Callaghan (1996) cite the case of major soft-
ware firms such as Microsoft and Lotus, which did not publish their own users’ 

614	
|	 20    ■    Vertical integration
manuals, preferring instead to use specialist firms which bore the uncertainty 
over the demand for manuals. In the event, the market did eventually decline, as 
online help functions largely superseded the printed manual.
Carlton (1979) suggests an optimal partial integration strategy might involve 
integrating to meet high-probability demand, while leaving low-probability 
demand to specialist producers. Emons (1996) considers a downstream firm 
whose demand for inputs varies randomly. The downstream firm can integrate 
vertically and produce its own inputs, or buy them through the market. If the 
vertically integrated firm invests in the capacity required to meet demand in good 
times, it incurs costs because it has spare capacity in bad times. However, when 
the downstream firm produces its own inputs, the market demand for inputs 
falls, leading to a reduction in input prices. This price effect may outweigh the 
costs of maintaining spare capacity.
Assured supply
Monteverde and Teece (1982) find that the higher the level of investment under-
taken by engineering firms in the production of components, the greater the 
tendency towards vertical integration. Buyers of technologically complex and 
strategically important inputs can find themselves at the mercy of suppliers, and 
backward integration is an obvious strategy for downstream producers to ensure 
supplies. Similarly, Acemoglu et al. (2003) find that when producers are more 
technology intensive than their suppliers, it is more likely that the producer will 
integrate backward than when the opposite is the case. The implication is that 
interruptions to the supply of inputs could threaten the producer’s investment. 
If this is a frequent or serious problem, the producer might consider backward 
integration to secure its own supply of inputs. However, it is important to iden-
tify the ultimate cause of the supply shortage. In industries where this may be due 
to factors beyond the supplier’s control, such as political instability or variations 
in climate, backward integration does not protect the downstream producer.
Adelman (1955) and Langlois and Robertson (1989) suggest vertical integra-
tion may be linked to the industry life cycle (see also Section 11.2). In the intro-
duction and growth stages, producers may integrate backward to develop their 
own supplies, and integrate forward to ensure efficient marketing and after-
sales service. As the industry approaches the maturity stage, specialist supply 
industries and independent distribution channels evolve, allowing producers to 
divest themselves of upstream and downstream activities. Eventually, during 
the maturity and decline stages, the extent of vertical integration may increase, 
as incumbent firms attempt to compensate for declining consumer demand by 
increasing their market power.
Externalities
Externalities may arise when property rights are poorly defined. Suppose firm 
A discovers a new process that only firm B can develop and produce. A asks B 
to keep the idea a secret from A’s rivals, and to sell the finished product only to 

	
	
	
20.3  Motives for vertical integration: cost savings	 |	
615
A. However, once A has passed the necessary information to B, there may be no 
incentive for B to comply with A’s original request, in which case A fails to ben-
efit from its own discovery. In this case, A has a clear incentive to integrate with 
B, in order to protect its property rights in the discovery. In the US in the 1920s, 
the development and profitability of the motor vehicle and petrol industries were 
retarded by the slow pace of innovation of petrol retailing: petrol was still sold 
in canisters by small corner shops. To speed up the development of retailing, 
petroleum producers integrated forward. The producers did not wish to invest 
in petrol stations and allow them to stay independent, because the new stations 
could have sold other firms’ petrol. Similar examples can be found in the UK 
brewing, tailoring and airlines industries. Some producers argue that forward 
integration into distribution is necessary to protect their investments. The final, 
retail stage may be too important to be left in the hands of inexperienced or inef-
ficient independent retailers.
Case study 20.1
One area of retail may be ‘diamond  
in the rough’
FT
Vertically integrated stores like American Eagle and Lululemon that control the design 
and distribution of their products and that were all the craze in the late 90s and early 
2000s — but fell out of fashion as department stores and wholesale channels gained 
­popularity — are returning to favour, according to Randal Konik, an analyst at Jeffer-
ies. In 2000 vertical integration was the ‘it’ thing, but the great recession changed that 
view and moved the market towards paying up for ‘capital-light’ or wholesale biz models.
However with the rise of Amazon as a ‘virtual’ department store we see risk to whole-
sale-only dominant businesses and believe the market will return to paying for companies 
that best control their destiny. So why is the wheel coming full circle for these vertically 
integrated retailers at a difficult time for the industry that is being pressured by changing 
consumer preferences and the rise of e-commerce?
First, these companies exert more control over their products and where they end up 
and that gives them a key competitive advantage over companies like Amazon. Moreover, 
they can cut their costs quickly because they have the ability to close stores and bring their 
store count to the right size. Abercrombie & Fitch he notes has about half of its existing 
store leases up for renewal in the next 2 years which gives it a lot of flexibility.
‘This may be hard to swallow but we believe looking at the scorched Earth of vertically 
integrated retail may be the new diamond in the rough,’ Mr Konik said. That could augur 
well for investors in companies like Abercrombie & Fitch, which has seen its shares down 
29 per cent so far this year, and American Eagle, which has seen it shares gain less than 
5 per cent over the same period.

Complexity
When two successive stages of a production process are linked by potentially 
complex legal relations, it may be efficient to integrate vertically. To guarantee 
a more certain supply of inputs or distribution outlets, a producer may attempt 
to negotiate long-term contracts with its suppliers or distributors. However, if 
the product is non-standard, perhaps due to frequent changes in design or tech-
nology, it may be difficult to specify an exhaustive contract capable of foresee-
ing all possible circumstances or pre-empting all possible ambiguities that could 
subsequently result in expensive litigation. An alternative approach might be to 
negotiate only a short-term contract. However, where a long-term investment is 
involved, the producer might feel it requires long-term guarantees. In such cases, 
neither long-term nor short-term contracts are effective, and vertical integration 
may provide a better solution.
The production and retailing stages of the film industry provide an example of 
the issue of complexity. Each film is unique and distribution patterns for one film 
never quite coincide with those for another. Issues such as pairing, regional expo-
sure, repeat showings, television sales and degree of promotional effort determine 
a unique distribution strategy for every film. This implies complex contractual 
relations between producers, distributors and exhibitors. Contractual agreements 
would also have to be monitored by a sophisticated and costly inspectorate. It 
may be simpler for producers to integrate forward with distributors and cinema 
chains, or for the latter to integrate backward.
Gil (2008) examines vertical relationships between distributors and exhibi-
tors in the film industry. Since contracts are inherently uncertain and subject 
to externalities, they are incomplete, especially as regards the length of time for 
which films will be screened. It is particularly difficult to write contracts speci-
fying the degree and effectiveness of the promotional activities supplied by the 
distributor and exhibitor. The distributor is generally responsible for national, 
regional and local promotion, while the exhibitor concentrates on point-of-sale 
promotion and pricing policy. The exhibitor also decides which film to show 
on which screen in the cinema. Decisions taken by the exhibitor affect ancillary 
markets supplied by the distributor, such as the DVD purchase and rental mar-
kets. In addition, the exhibitor may have other sources of revenue dependent on 
the screening of specific films, such as concessionary sales and on-screen adver-
tisements. Consequently the incentives of both parties may be misaligned. In 
the case of the Spanish film industry, Gil (2008) finds films shown by vertically 
integrated distributor–exhibitors are screened for up to two weeks longer than 
films screened by independent exhibitors. Films of uncertain quality are more 
likely to be distributed by integrated firms.
Moral hazard
In general, a moral hazard problem arises when an agent lacks the incentive to 
work in the best interests of the principal, and the principal cannot monitor the 
actions of the agent. Moral hazard issues can affect contracts between firms at 
different stages of a production process. Suppose a buyer of inputs arranges a 

	
	
	
20.3  Motives for vertical integration: cost savings	 |	
617
contract under conditions of uncertainty. It is possible for the input supplier to 
bear the risk, but this requires a risk premium to be added to the supply price. 
The buyer might regard this premium as excessive, and might decide to bear the 
risk itself by offering terms under which the buyer reimburses the supplier for 
all costs incurred and adds a markup for profit. Many government contracts are 
structured in this manner. However, contracts of this kind provide no incentive 
for the supplier to control its own costs. The buyer might insist on monitoring the 
supplier’s work, but if monitoring proves too difficult or costly, vertical integra-
tion may be a better alternative.
Asset specificity
Asset specificity occurs when two firms are dependent on each other, as a result 
of investments in specific physical capital, human capital, sites or brands. The 
specialised nature of the asset creates a situation of bilateral monopoly, in which 
only one firm buys and one firm sells the specialised asset or resource.
Figures 20.8 and 20.9 show a microeconomic analysis of bilateral monopoly. 
In Figure 20.8, it is assumed there is one (monopoly) upstream seller and many 
downstream buyers of the specialised asset. This case corresponds to a standard 
model of monopoly. The upstream seller maximises profit by producing at the 
point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Using the buyers’ demand 
function to identify the corresponding price, the seller’s profit-maximizing price 
and output combination is (P1, Q1).
In Figure 20.9 it is assumed there are many upstream sellers and one (monop-
sony) downstream buyer of the specialised asset. The construction is as follows:
■ The downstream buyer’s demand function (the same as the buyers’ collective 
demand function in Figure 20.8) is interpreted as the downstream buyer’s mar-
ginal revenue product function: the maximum amount the buyer is prepared to 
pay for each additional unit of the asset is the extra revenue it obtains by using 
the marginal unit of the asset to produce and sell more of its own product.
Figure 20.8  One seller, many buyers

618	
|	 20    ■    Vertical integration
■ The upstream sellers’ collective supply function corresponds to the monopo-
list’s marginal cost function in Figure 20.8.
■ The downstream buyer’s marginal outlay function is the marginal function 
corresponding to the upstream sellers’ supply function. The marginal outlay 
function lies above the supply function. For each additional unit of the spe-
cialised asset the buyer wishes to purchase, in order to induce more supply 
the buyer has to offer a slightly higher price, not only for the marginal unit 
but also for all the other units (up to the marginal unit) to which the buyer is 
already committed.
In Figure 20.9 the downstream buyer should buy the quantity of the specialised 
asset at which marginal revenue product equals marginal outlay. Using the sell-
ers’ supply function to identify the corresponding price, the buyer’s profit maxi-
mizing price and output combination is (P2, Q2). P2 in Figure 20.9 is certainly 
lower than P1 in Figure 20.8: a monopsony buyer is able to impose a low price 
on a group of atomistic sellers, and a monopoly seller is able to extract a high 
price from a group of atomistic buyers. Depending on the relative slopes of the 
revenue and cost functions, Q2 might be higher or lower than Q1.
Combining the analyses in Figures 20.8 and 20.9, there is no determinate solu-
tion to the bilateral monopoly case in which a single seller confronts a single 
buyer. The equilibrium price could fall anywhere between P1 and P2, depending 
on the relative negotiating or bargaining strengths of the monopoly seller and 
monopsony buyer of the specialised asset. However, it would be in the joint 
interests of both parties to agree to exchange the quantity Q3, at which the down-
stream buyer’s marginal revenue product equals the upstream seller’s marginal 
cost. Collusion between the two parties might be one method by which this out-
come could be achieved (Machlup and Taber, 1960). However, the usual difficul-
ties of negotiating, monitoring and enforcing an agreement can be avoided if the 
two firms integrate vertically.

Using transaction costs terminology, the difficulties of the situation can be 
illustrated with reference to the following example. Suppose a shipper of antique 
furniture is the only firm that requires specialised padded wagons for long-­
distance rail transport; and in view of the low level of demand, only one firm 
produces such wagons. The producer and the shipper are locked in by the specific 
nature of the asset. Both can behave opportunistically, in an attempt to extract 
more favourable terms. The seller may demand a higher price, threatening a 
refusal to supply, knowing the buyer has no alternative source of supply. Equally, 
the buyer may demand a lower price, threatening to refuse to buy, knowing the 
supplier has no alternative market. ‘Because non-redeployable specific assets 
make it costly to switch to a new relationship, the market safeguard against 
opportunism is no longer effective’ (John and Weitz, 1988, p. 340). Consequently, 
the market transaction is characterised by expensive haggling and high contrac-
tual costs, which may propel the firms to integrate vertically.
Williamson (1985) identifies four types of asset specificity:
■ Site specificity. By having plants located close to one another, there is a saving 
on transportation, processing and inventory costs. The assets cannot be moved 
to other locations without increasing costs.
■ Physical asset specificity. Plant and machinery that is designed with a limited 
end use, either for use by one buyer or with one input, is specific to one market 
transaction. Such investments offer little or no return in alternative uses.
■ Human asset specificity. Human capital, in the form of specialised knowledge 
and experience that has been developed by a firm’s managers or workers, may 
be essential for one supplier but irrelevant and therefore worthless elsewhere.
■ Dedicated assets. A firm may be forced to make large-scale investments in 
dedicated assets to meet the needs of one large buyer. If the buyer decides to 
go elsewhere, the firm is left with excess capacity.
Using data from ten large computer manufacturers between 1950 and 1970, 
Krickx (1995) tests the hypothesis that vertical integration is more likely when 
asset specificity is high, by analysing three major components: receiving tubes, 
transistors and integrated circuits. As the specificity of the components increased, 
so did the tendency towards vertical integration. By the late 1960s, the top six 
computer producers had all vertically integrated backward into the integrated 
circuit industry. Bigelow and Argyres (2008) examine the make-or-buy decisions 
of early US motor vehicle manufacturers during the period 1917–35. Most firms 
produced unique engines internally, but purchased standardised engines from 
independent suppliers. This suggests that the greater the degree of asset specific-
ity, the stronger the tendency to internalise production.
Avoidance of tax or price controls
Vertical integration between downstream and upstream firms, either within or 
across national boundaries, can be a means of avoiding tax or price controls. A 
market transaction that is subject to a sales tax or price control can be replaced 
by an internal transaction, escaping the liability or restriction. For example, 

620	
|	 20    ■    Vertical integration
if A is liable to pay a sales tax, from which B (the next stage of production) is 
exempt, there is a clear incentive for A to integrate vertically with B in order to 
escape the tax (see Figure 20.10). Alternatively, vertical integration might enable 
firms to avoid minimum or maximum price controls imposed by governments 
or regulators.
Of course, the authorities are aware of these possibilities and may attempt to 
tax or regulate upstream firms as well. Scherer (1980, p. 305) shows that in the 
US and Europe, integrated petroleum firms reported low pre-tax profits at the 
refining and marketing stages of production, but much higher profits at the crude 
oil extraction stage, which was subject to a lower rate of tax on profits. Within 
the EU, there is wide variation in national rates of corporate taxation, providing 
an incentive for firms to locate their subsidiaries in low-tax countries (Jacobson 
and Andréosso-O’Callaghan, 1996).
	
20.4	
Vertical disintegration
A relatively neglected issue is why vertically integrated firms might sometimes 
wish to create new intermediate markets by disengaging from parts of the supply 
chain and transforming themselves into more specialised organizations. Stigler 
(1951) suggests a theory of vertical disintegration along the following lines. Ini-
tially, when markets are small, there is a tendency for integration of the various 
stages of the supply chain. As markets develop and become larger, however, bene-
fits may be obtained from specialization and economies of scale at different stages 
of the supply chain, and there may be a tendency towards vertical disintegration.
Chen (2005) considers Stigler’s argument to be logically incomplete. Why 
should it be necessary for the firm to decouple its upstream operation in order 
for the latter to realise economies of scale? Why should a specialised upstream 
division not also benefit from economies of scale? According to Chen, the motiva-
tion for vertical disintegration originates in the nature of the horizontal competi-
tion at the downstream level. An integrated firm may find it hard to persuade 
its downstream competitors to purchase their inputs from its upstream division. 
The competitors may choose to ‘boycott’ the upstream supplier which is also 
their downstream rival, and purchase from independent suppliers. To retain the

business of its downstream competitors as purchasers of inputs from its upstream 
division, the firm might need to decouple the upstream division and reconstitute 
the latter as an independent entity.
Jacobides (2005) presents examples of vertical disintegration. The manufac-
ture of early prototypes of the PC (desktop) started as an integrated operation, 
dominated by the manufacturers of large mainframe computers such as IBM and 
DEC. With the advent of the PC, the industry tended to disintegrate into separate 
segments (component manufacturers, software and operating system develop-
ers, assemblers and retailers). Another example is the data processing function 
in banking. This used to be handled by the banks themselves, but subsequently 
was procured through the market from specialised firms such as EDS and IBM. 
Until the 1970s in the US, mortgages were granted, funded and serviced by inte-
grated institutions such as banks and savings and loans associations. By 2000, 
mortgage lending had disintegrated into a ‘collection of vertically co-specialised 
entities’ (Jacobides, 2005, p. 468). The trend towards vertical disintegration was 
motivated by the realization of economic benefits from specialization and trade, 
and a trend towards the standardization of the information used to evaluate the 
creditworthiness of borrowers across the industry.
	
20.5	
Empirical evidence on vertical integration
The topic of vertical integration has been extensively dealt with in the theoreti-
cal industrial organization literature. In contrast, the empirical literature on the 
motives for vertical integration, and the impact of vertical integration on perfor-
mance, is surprisingly sparse. This may be due partly to the difficulties involved 
in measuring vertical integration accurately. This section reviews a selection of 
empirical studies that tackle issues associated with vertical integration. For a 
comprehensive review, see Lafontaine and Slade (2007).
Spiller (1985) evaluates two competing hypotheses concerning the motives for 
vertical integration. The first is a neoclassical hypothesis that vertical integration 
increases profit by permitting savings in average costs, risk reduction, tax evasion 
or the imposition of price controls. The second is a transaction costs hypothesis, 
which emphasises the benefits of integration arising from asset specificity. The 
findings from an empirical study of the share price effect of a number of US verti-
cal mergers tend to favour the asset specificity hypothesis. John and Weitz (1988) 
develop a transaction costs analysis of forward vertical integration. The use of 
direct distribution channels implies vertical integration, while indirect channels 
comprise a variety of institutional structures. It is suggested that four particular 
factors may increase the use of direct channels: asset specificity, environmental 
uncertainty, behavioural uncertainty and the availability of savings in average 
costs. Asset specificity is discussed in Section 20.3; environmental uncertainty 
refers to unforeseen fluctuations in supply and demand in the markets for the 
firm’s inputs and outputs; behavioural uncertainty refers to opportunistic behav-
iour on the part of one of the contracting parties in a vertical relationship; and 
the cost savings argument is based on the notion that integration is more likely 
if there is potential for savings through economies of scale or scope.

622

D’Aveni and Ravenscraft (1994) examine the effects of vertical integration on 
costs. First, vertical integration can reduce costs by reducing the number of mar-
ket transactions, integrating administrative functions and allowing better access to 
information on upstream or downstream operations. Second, vertical integration 
can increase costs through managerial diseconomies of scale (the difficulties in 
managing a larger organization) or an absence of competitive pressure allowing 
the managers to get away with technical or x-inefficiencies. Cook (1997) examines 
the motives for vertical integration in the UK brewing and petrol industries. The 
market power motive for vertical integration involves collusion at the retail level, 
and the creation of entry barriers. The transaction costs motive is focused on 
asset specificity and uncertainties due to hold-up. Asset specificity is determined 
by the size of the sunk cost, which is related to the minimum efficient scale. The 
market power motive appears to be more important in the brewing industry, and 
the transaction costs motive is more important in the petrol industry.
Gertner and Stillman (2001) examine vertical relationships, and the ability 
of firms to respond to sudden changes in their competitive environment. The 
response of integrated and non-integrated clothing firms to the internet is exam-
ined. In general, vertically integrated firms offered online services earlier than their 
non-integrated counterparts, and offered a wider product range. Kwoka (2002) 
examines the economies of vertical integration in the electricity generating indus-
try in the US; Nemoto and Goto (2002) explore similar issues for Japan. Vertical 
integration between the power generation, transmission and distribution stages is 
a common feature of the electricity industry. The US electricity-industry is char-
acterised by large vertically integrated utilities operating alongside non-integrated 
generators, transmission and distribution firms. Kwoka finds the large vertically 
integrated utilities benefit from economies of scale in distribution, through the 
packaging and selling of power and the billing and servicing of accounts. Enforced 
deintegration would result in the loss of these vertical economies.
	
20.6	
Agency and vertical relationships
Sections 20.2 and 20.3 examine reasons why a strategy of vertical integration 
might be attractive to some firms. However, vertical integration is only one of 
a number of possible vertical structures. This section examines some alternative 
vertical relationships, which fall within the general category of principal–agent 
relationships. For example, a producer (acting as the principal) contracts a sup-
plying firm (the agent) to produce its inputs. The fundamental reason for develop-
ing contractually specific vertical ties is harmonization of production, processing 
and distribution activities. But why should firms choose this approach, rather 
than rely on the advantages of vertical integration? In general there are two rea-
sons: first, to maintain some degree of independence; and, second, to avoid costs 
that may be associated with full-scale backward or forward vertical integration. 
Firms that value their independence or wish to operate only in familiar stages 
of production may develop vertical relationships short of full-scale integration 
(Harrigan, 1983; Gal-Or, 1991, 1999; Aust, 1997). Vertical separation, as opposed 

	
	
	
20.6  Agency and vertical relationships	 |	
623
to vertical integration, might allow the development of sufficiently friendly rela-
tions among the principals to facilitate effective collusion (Bonanno and Vickers, 
1988). This section examines two common forms of vertical relationship: franchise 
agreements and networks.
Franchise agreements
Franchising refers to a vertical relationship between two independent firms: a 
franchisor and a franchisee (OECD, 1993). The franchisor sells a proven product, 
process or brand to a franchisee on a contractual basis, in return for set-up fees, 
licence fees, royalties or other payments. The contract typically covers issues such 
as the prices to be charged, services offered, location and marketing effort. One 
of the commonest models of franchise agreement involves retail franchising, in 
which a producer develops a vertical relationship with a retailer.
Several types of franchise agreement can be identified:
■ The business format franchise covers not only the sale of a product or brand, but 
also the entire business format, comprising a marketing strategy, staff training, 
manuals, quality control processes, store layout and close communications 
between the franchisor and franchisee. Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dyno-Rod 
and Prontaprint operate franchises of this type.
■ The product or trademark franchise allows greater independence to the franchi-
see and gives the franchisor less control. For example, a relationship between 
a car manufacturer and a car dealer may allow the dealer a large degree of 
independence. Car dealers supplying identical brands can differentiate their 
service; in contrast, Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets are characterised by their 
homogeneity.
■ The producer-to-wholesaler franchise and the wholesaler-to-retailer franchise 
complete the list. As an example of the former, the wholesalers of Coca-Cola 
are independent bottlers who hold perpetual Coca-Cola franchises with exclu-
sive territories. In the latter case, a wholesaler owns the franchise to supply 
independent retail outlets trading under their own brand names.
It is natural to ask why the relationship between the franchisor and fran-
chisee is subject to contractual control. The fundamental reason is that deci-
sions taken by one party concerning price, quality, service offered, quality of 
factor inputs employed and so on affect the profit and performance of the 
other party. Furthermore, the decisions of one franchisee may well impact on 
rival franchisees. While individual decisions may maximise the profit of one 
of the parties, externalities may reduce aggregate profits for the entire vertical 
operation. Accordingly, contractual control is necessary to reduce or eliminate 
negative externalities. ‘The crucial economic fact that underlies franchising 
contracts is that the incentives of the transacting parties do not always coincide’ 
(Klein, 1995, p. 12).
Klein (1995) identifies four potential sources of conflict:
■ When franchisees jointly use a common brand, a freerider problem arises. Each 
franchisee has an incentive to reduce the quality of the product in order to save 

624

costs, but the consequences of any such action are borne by all franchisees. 
The probable future reduction in customer demand is spread across the entire 
market and does not fall directly on the freerider.
■ If an initial pre-sales service is required to persuade customers to buy the prod-
uct, freeriding franchisees might be able to avoid providing such a service by 
relying on other firms to do so. For example, online car dealers might be able 
to charge a lower price by selling cars over the internet, avoiding the costs of 
providing showrooms, test drives and sales staff to answer queries. Customers 
might first obtain these services from franchised outlets, and then purchase 
more cheaply from the freeriding online supplier.
■ A franchisee may have some degree of market power in setting a price for the 
final product, perhaps because the franchisor has granted exclusive distribu-
tion rights. In this case, double marginalization may arise (see Section 20.2). 
The higher price charged by the franchisee might not necessarily be in the 
franchisor’s best interests.
■ If the price at which the franchisor sells the product to the franchisee exceeds 
the franchisor’s marginal cost, there is an incentive for the franchisor to 
increase its output, requiring the franchisee to increase the supply of its com-
plementary input (for example, marketing or other promotional effort). How-
ever, the amount of the complementary input a franchisee may wish to supply 
is not dependent on the franchisor’s profit-maximizing output level. For exam-
ple, suppose a franchisor sells its product at a wholesale price of £4.50, and the 
franchisee sells to consumers at a retail price of £5. The £0.50 markup covers 
the average distribution cost and the franchisee’s normal profit. Suppose a 
particular buyer has a reservation price of £4, but if the buyer is exposed 
to marketing services costing £3, the reservation price would increase to £5. 
Clearly, the franchisee cannot afford to spend £3 to secure this sale. However, 
if the franchisor’s marginal cost is below £1.50, it would benefit the franchisor 
to spend £3 to attract a sale worth £5. If the producer were vertically integrated 
with the distributor, the additional marketing service would be funded. Under 
a franchise agreement, the franchisor would need to subsidise the franchisee’s 
marketing effort in order to achieve the same outcome.
Three forms of contractual control or vertical restraint can be identified, which 
reduce or eliminate conflict due to negative externalities:
■ Relationships can be coordinated by giving the franchisor direct control over 
the franchisee’s decisions, such as price-setting, quality of product or service 
and marketing effort.
■ A structure of rewards and penalties can be designed to ensure the incen-
tives facing both parties are properly aligned. For example, the contract 
could specify that the franchisee pays the franchisor a fixed fee, and buys all 
variable inputs at marginal cost. Under this structure, the franchisee’s profit-­
maximizing output decision coincides with that of the franchisor.
■ To reduce competition between franchisees (intra-brand competition), a fran-
chisor might offer exclusive territorial contracts, or fix a minimum retail price.

625
In practice, contracts between franchisors and franchisees may include aspects 
of all three forms of contractual structure. Macho-Stadler and Pérez-Castrillo 
(1998) view franchise contracts as a mix of centralised and decentralised decision-
making. In the fast-food industry, for example, decisions such as menu selection 
and building design are taken centrally by the franchisor, while employee recruit-
ment and local advertising are taken locally by the franchisees.
Under some circumstances, it might be in a franchisor’s interest to give cer-
tain franchisees ownership of several units (Kalnins and Lafontaine, 2004). 
Multi-unit ownership may increase the franchisee’s bargaining power and lead 
to opportunistic behaviour. A franchisor might be willing to accept this risk for 
several reasons. First, a franchisee might possess specialised knowledge that can 
be deployed productively in more than one unit. Second, franchisees might be 
tempted to freeride, by using lower quality inputs or offering poor service, while 
enjoying the benefits of brand recognition and loyalty. This externality tends to 
diminish as the size of the franchisee’s operation expands. Third, by concentrat-
ing franchise ownership the franchisor can prevent excessive local competition 
between franchisees in the same chain. Kalnins (2004) finds prices in fast-food 
restaurants are influenced more by the pricing strategies of competitors in the 
same chain than by the prices set by rival chains. Finally, multi-unit owners may 
benefit from economies of scale in marketing.
In some cases, a franchisor might decide to maintain centralised control by 
running some outlets itself. For example, the development of a new brand or 
product might be too important strategically to be left to franchisees, and the 
company might prefer to channel such strategic initiatives through its own out-
lets. The geographic location of outlets is a key determinant of the degree of 
centralization or decentralization. Outlets far from the franchisor’s headquarters, 
outlets in rural areas and outlets close to motorways are more likely to operate 
with less centralised control (Macho-Stadler and Pérez-Castrillo, 1998; Dnes and 
Garoupa, 2005).
Informal networks
Informal networks are groups of firms linked vertically by regular contact and 
relationships that may eventually develop into formal relations. For example, 
upstream firms might train staff in downstream firms, provide technical exper-
tise, and customise their products in order to meet specific requirements of buy-
ers. The relationship is non-exclusive, and both parties sell to and buy from other 
firms. In contrast, independent firms rely solely on market transactions for stan-
dardised products, and do not develop special relationships with upstream sup-
pliers or downstream customers. In the face of uncertain demand, it is suggested 
informal networks can sometimes offer better solutions than full-scale vertical 
integration. First, buyers reliant on multiple sourcing arrangements may be able 
to reduce the bargaining power of sellers. Second, firms in informal networks 
can make specific investments to meet the needs of buyers or sellers. Accord-
ingly, vertical integration is not the only possible solution to specificity problems. 
Third, the aggregate level of investment in specific assets by the network may be 
less than in a vertically integrated firm (Bolton and Whinston, 1993).

626	
|	 20    ■    Vertical integration
According to Robertson and Langlois (1995), informal networks can be 
located within the transaction costs paradigm, encompassing independent, mar-
ket-oriented firms at one extreme, and firms that have internalised transactions 
through common ownership or contractual agreements at the other extreme. 
However, informal networks can also be analysed within a second dimension. 
This approach focuses on two alternative definitions of the firm (see Sections 5.4 
and 5.5). First, the firm as nexus of contracts approach (Jensen and Meckling, 
1976; Cheung, 1983) characterises the firm by the nature of its internal and exter-
nal contracts. Contracts within the firm are informal, subject to revision, and 
need to be coordinated administratively. The essence of a firm is its ability to 
manage these internal contracts efficiently. Second, the property rights approach 
characterises the firm by its ownership of assets. Accordingly, vertical integration 
involves the ownership of successive stages of production. To understand verti-
cal relationships, both definitions are useful. For example, it may be possible for 
two independent firms to be linked via administrative coordination, or for an 
integrated firm to deal with its subsidiary through the market. In Figure 20.11 
these two defining characteristics, integration of coordination and integration of 
ownership, are represented by the horizontal and vertical axes, in order to locate 
the following organizational forms:
■ Marshallian district. This refers to the most informal of all networks, based on 
Alfred Marshall’s analysis of nineteenth-century British manufacturing firms. 
Groups of small firms, producing the same or similar products, tend to cluster 
in specific geographic areas. Being vertically separated, the firms rely on local 
market transactions. However, the network (or district) allows for the realiza-
tion of external economies, through the development of pools of specialised 
labour and the rapid diffusion of new technologies.
■ ‘Third Italy’ district. This refers to the system developed in north-east Italy, 
where clusters of relatively small firms have developed into industrial dis-
tricts (see also Section 11.4), often located in the vicinity of smaller towns 
Figure 20.11  Robertson and Langlois’s two dimensions of integration

627
or cities. The firms often specialise in the production of standardised prod-
ucts, such as ceramics or textiles. The major difference between this and the 
Marshallian district is the level of cooperation between the firms. Coopera-
tion is often sponsored by government, and may involve shared accounting 
services, domestic and international marketing initiatives and investment in 
infrastructure.
■ Venture capital network. Venture capitalists are often involved in financing 
small, high- technology start-up businesses. Well-known high-technology 
clusters include Silicon Valley in the US and the Cambridge Science Park 
in the UK. The degree of integration of coordination is low; although per-
haps higher than in the Marshallian district, since some coordination is pro-
vided by venture capitalists who supply the initial finance. Venture capitalists 
help protect their investments by ensuring producers have at their disposal 
entrepreneurial and managerial expertise, as well as contacts with upstream 
suppliers and downstream customers. The involvement of venture capitalists 
implies producers cede some control to their investors, so there is an element 
of centralization and outside control.
■ Japanese kaisha network. Where production is characterised by the availabil-
ity of significant economies of scale, industrial districts comprising clusters 
of small firms are less likely to develop. An alternative core network model 
involves many small satellite firms located in the vicinity of one large firm, 
often an assembler. For example, US (and British) car manufacturers often 
rely on suppliers with relations governed through short-term contracts. The 
large manufacturer ensures discipline by exercising market power as a single 
(monopsony) buyer. If suppliers do not meet the manufacturer’s requirements 
regarding price, quality and timing, the manufacturer buys its inputs else-
where. The manufacturer’s detached attitude towards its upstream suppliers 
does not inspire loyalty, and fails to provide incentives for innovation, or for 
any action other than sticking rigidly to the terms of the contract. However, 
under the kaisha network system, large Japanese manufacturers typically offer 
long-term contracts to their suppliers, and share technical and design knowl-
edge. Japanese manufacturers often have significant ownership stakes in their 
suppliers. Owing to their interconnectedness, upstream and downstream firms 
tend to share similar business and financial goals.
■ Chandlerian firm. Chandler (1977) describes the traditional vertically inte-
grated firm. Successive stages of production are centrally owned, and market 
relationships between upstream suppliers and downstream buyers have been 
internalised.
■ Holding company. This structure combines integration of ownership, with non-
integration of coordination. Consequently, divisions or subsidiaries owned by 
the parent are allowed to operate in an independent, market-oriented manner. 
The development of multidivisional structures can be interpreted as a form 
of decentralization. Although vertically integrated, the core firm retains only 
very narrowly defined strategic functions, and the divisions or subsidiaries 
operate almost autonomously.

NHS outsourcing deal loses 1,000 jobs
FT
Capita, the FTSE 100 outsourcer, is planning to cut nearly 1,000 jobs when it takes on 
a £1bn contract to supply administrative support to the NHS. Almost 80 per cent of 
employees in the Primary Care Support Services division will lose their jobs and 28 of 30 
offices will be shut when the service is transferred from the public sector in September. 
The staff provide back-office services such as payments administration and management 
of clinical records for NHS primary care providers including GPs, opticians, pharmacists 
and dentists.
The Capita contract is the latest in a series of outsourcing deals in the NHS, as Brit-
ain’s state-funded health service increasingly seeks to use the private sector in pursuit 
of cost savings. Although the award remains subject to final approval from the Depart-
ment of Health, sign-off is expected within days. NHS England said the deal would cre-
ate ‘substantial administrative savings to reinvest in frontline health services, and will 
form the basis of full consultation with the employees involved’. Capita said it would 
be inappropriate to comment until the contract had been finalised. The plans have been 
revealed as part of NHS England’s discussions with unions ahead of the transfer of staff 
to Capita. The company beat stiff competition from Capgemini and Equiniti to win the 
contract, which is worth £750m over seven years, with an optional three-year extension. 
It is expected to deliver 40 per cent cost savings for NHS England from day one.
The use of the private sector in healthcare services is controversial but commercial 
providers are confident more opportunities will emerge. They believe that many health-
care trusts, faced with a £30bn shortfall in the NHS budget over the next seven years, 
will have little option but to work with the private sector, which promises to invest in 
technology, improve staff productivity and use economies of scale to deliver services at 
lower costs. Earlier this month, the Department of Health revealed it had signed a five-
year £12.5m deal with the Seattle-based Virginia Mason Institute to help five healthcare 
trusts improve care standards and avoid more than 800 unnecessary deaths a month in 
hospitals in England. According to the department, the Virginia Mason medical centre 
has used the Toyota Production System and manufacturing principles to become a leader 
in care standards in the US.
Capita employs 68,000 staff in the UK managing everything from the London conges-
tion charge for Transport for London to military bases for the Ministry of Defence. It 
has had a run of contract wins in the NHS and earlier this year secured work helping 
new doctor-led clinical commissioning groups to buy billions of pounds of services for 
hospitals and GPs, introducing a market in NHS procurement for the first time. In May 
it won an £80m, 10-year contract to provide IT, finance and estate management services 
to the Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust, which employs 3,000 staff 
in west London.

McDonald’s struggles to attract bidders  
for China franchises
FT
McDonald’s is struggling to attract the calibre of bidders it envisioned in the sale of its 
China and Hong Kong franchise, according to people familiar with the situation. With 
the auction, announced earlier this year, the company is seeking to reduce its direct expo-
sure to China, where food supply scandals have hurt its share price, and to halt capital 
expenditure in the region. But McDonald’s is also looking to fortify its reputation with 
the sale, which has moved into a second round of bidding and could fetch $2bn-$3bn, 
according to people briefed on the deal.
Pressure from investors for better quality control in Asia has been reflected in the terms 
of the deal, said these people, who say some of the conditions, such as keeping manage-
ment intact for two years and a restriction on taking the franchise public, are onerous. 
‘They aren’t getting the top-tier companies they wanted. They have had to turn down 
a lot of the [unqualified] bidders,’ one person briefed on the auction said. McDonald’s 
said: ‘We are making solid progress as we look for long-term strategic partners with 
local relevance who have complementary skills and expertise.’ The shortlist includes some 
Chinese groups that have shot to fame after aggressive buying sprees but have little to no 
experience in fast food.
Sanpower Group, which has struggled to manage the UK‘s House of Fraser depart-
ment store after buying it in 2014, said it had made an offer in partnership with state-
owned Beijing Tourism Group. State-owned ChemChina, which agreed in February 
to pay $44bn for Swiss agrochemical company Syngenta and owns a chain of noodle 
shops in China, was also an early bidder, though it is unclear if the company has made 
it into the next round. China Cinda Asset Management, a state-owned bad-debt man-
ager, and dairy company Beijing Sanyuan Foods have also lodged bids, Bloomberg 
has reported.
McDonald’s share price has risen more than 23 per cent over the past 12 months, since 
Steve Easterbrook took the reins and outlined a turnround effort. The plan for Asia 
involved one or more local partners taking over the China and Hong Kong franchise of 
2,800 outlets for 20 years while paying royalties to McDonald’s. But some investors are 
uneasy about handing over the franchise and McDonald’s brand reputation to a Chinese 
group, particularly after a food safety scandal there in 2014 that hit sales. ‘There has 
always been a massive disconnect between what is happening here and what the company 
in the US thinks is going on,’ said Ben Cavender, principal at China Market Research, 
which advises multinational chain restaurants in China.
Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of CtW Group, which is affiliated with a fed-
eration of unions holding more than $250bn in assets including 0.2 per cent of McDon-
ald’s, wrote a letter to the company in March expressing concern about the idea of a 
master franchising strategy for Asia. CtW said the royalties McDonald’s receives from 
the owner of its Latin America franchise, Arcos Dorados, have declined 23 per cent

over the past two years. ‘Our concern is that if McDonald’s attempts to replicate the 
master franchisee model it has established with Arcos Dorados in other regions, it will 
replicate the poor performance and absent accountability currently plaguing that com-
pany,’ Mr Waizenegger wrote.

Summary
The topic of vertical relationships covers a wide range of issues involving firms 
operating at different stages of the same production process. Vertical integration 
refers to a situation where a single firm has ownership and exercises control over 
production at successive stages of the production process. Vertical integration 
may be used as a strategy for restricting competition, by either using or abusing 
market power. However, one of the strongest arguments in favour of vertical 
integration derives from an analysis of the problem of double marginalization, 
which arises when successive stages of a production process are under the control 
of independent (non-integrated) monopoly firms. For example, if a producer and 
retailer are both monopolists, and both add their own markups to the price, the 
outcome is a higher price and lower output than in the case where the two firms 
are vertically integrated. Both producer and consumer surplus are higher if the 
production and retail stages are vertically integrated.
Williamson’s transaction costs paradigm provides another very general and 
wide-ranging explanation for vertical integration. Specific sources of cost saving 
include the following:
■ Technological conditions. Vertical integration may lead to the reduction of pro-
duction costs. This may occur where complementary processes are best com-
pleted together.
■ Uncertainty. The relationship between firms in successive stages of production 
is subject to uncertainty arising from incomplete information. Vertical integra-
tion can help reduce such incompleteness.
■ Assured supply. Firms may be concerned about the risks of being let down by 
a supplier. Backward vertical integration may help ensure a steady supply of 
inputs.
■ Externalities arise when a firm incurs additional costs brought about by the 
actions of its suppliers or distributors. Vertical integration may help eliminate 
these costs.
■ Complexity. Vertical relationships may be characterised by complex technical 
and legal relations. The resulting difficulties may be reduced through vertical 
integration.

	
	
	
Discussion questions	 |	
631
■ Moral hazard. A firm’s independent suppliers or retailers may have insufficient 
incentive to act in the firm’s best interests. Within an integrated organization 
these disincentives may be eliminated.
■ Asset specificity arises when a firm invests in the production or distribution of 
custom-made products for specific clients. High bargaining costs in a case of 
bilateral monopoly may be reduced or eliminated through integration.
■ Avoidance of tax or price controls may also be possible through a strategy of 
vertical integration.
Empirical evidence on the impact of vertical integration on performance is 
surprisingly sparse, partly because of the difficulties involved in measuring ver-
tical integration accurately. As an alternative to vertical integration, vertical 
relationships of a looser nature, stopping short of full-scale merger, are also 
possible. Examples include franchise agreements, involving a specific contrac-
tual agreement between a franchisor and franchisee; and informal networks of 
independent firms that are linked vertically through non-exclusive contracts or 
other relationships. Potential advantages of franchising or informal networks 
include the preservation of some (or all) of both parties’ independence, and the 
avoidance of some of the costs that might otherwise be associated with full-scale 
vertical integration.

Introduction
In some cases, the cost of organizing vertical integration or monitoring other 
types of vertical relationship might be prohibitive. As an alternative, various 
forms of vertical restraint might be developed, in order to achieve similar out-
comes. Vertical restraints are conditions and restrictions on trade imposed by 
firms that are linked vertically. It is perhaps unfortunate that the words ‘restraint’ 
and ‘restriction’ have negative connotations, because in certain cases arrange-
ments of the kind that are examined in this chapter may have beneficial rather 
than harmful effects on economic welfare.

This chapter proceeds as follows. Section 21.2 considers profit-enhancing 
motives for the creation of vertical restraints. As before, these are subdivided 
into enhancement of market power and pursuit of cost savings.
Section 21.3 examines the main forms that vertical restraints may take. Resale 
price maintenance (RPM) is an arrangement whereby an upstream firm retains 
the right to control the price at which a product or service is sold downstream by 
a wholesaler or retailer. Foreclosure refers to the practice of refusing to supply a 
downstream firm, or to purchase from an upstream firm. Territorial exclusivity 
refers to an arrangement whereby a producer imposes territorial restrictions per-
mitting dealers to operate only in specified locations. Finally, quantity-dependent 
pricing describes several arrangements such that the price per unit paid by a 
downstream buyer depends on the number of units purchased.
	
21.2	
Motives for vertical restraints
In some cases, firms may find that vertical integration or other types of vertical 
relationship are too costly to organise or monitor. As an alternative, they may 
develop various forms of vertical restraint, in an attempt to achieve similar out-
comes. Vertical restraints are conditions and restrictions on trade imposed by 
firms that are linked vertically. Generally speaking, vertical restraints may serve 
two purposes: enhancement of market power, and realization of cost savings. 
The principal motives for vertical restraints are discussed under these headings.
Enhancement of market power
In some cases, market power over one stage of production or distribution can be 
extended to an adjacent stage by means of vertical restraints. One way of extend-
ing market power is through a price or profit squeeze. An integrated monopolist 
can reduce the margin between the price of a raw material input and the price of 
the finished product.
Table 21.1 summarises an example based on the Alcoa case of 1945 in the 
US, in which the Aluminium Company of America was convicted of restrictive 
practices involving vertical restraints (Shepherd, 1997, p. 276). Under pricing 
policy A, the dominant firm sells aluminium ingots to its own manufacturing 
division, and to other firms, at a price of 1,000 per ton, and earns a profit of 200 
from ingot production. After processing at an additional cost of 500, aluminium 
products are sold to final consumers for 2,000 per ton. The dominant firm and 
the non-integrated rival both earn a profit of 500 at the manufacturing stage. The 
dominant firm’s total profit is 700. The price of 1,000 that the dominant firm 
charges its division is known as a transfer price (see Section 14.5). Under pricing 
policy B, the dominant firm increases ingot prices to 1,490, and earns a profit of 
690 from ingot production. The accounting costs of its manufacturing division 
rise to 1,990 and profit falls to 10, but total profit remains 700. However, the 
non-integrated rival experiences a profit squeeze, from 500 to 10. This might be 
sufficient to force the rival to withdraw from manufacturing.

Other methods for enhancing market power through vertical restraints include 
the following:
■ Increase in final prices and deterioration of service. A restraint that results in 
customers being forced to concentrate their orders on a narrow range of sup-
pliers results in the denial of access to alternative (more efficient) sources of 
supply, and access to alternative products. This can lead to a reduction in intra-
brand competition and inter-brand competition. Unable to exploit alternative 
sources, consumers may face higher prices and poorer conditions of supply.
■ Increased opportunities for collusion. The practice of forcing distributors to 
resell the product at a minimum price reduces intra-brand price competi-
tion and presents opportunities for effective horizontal price-fixing. An 
upstream producer may be tempted to cheat on a cartel of which it is a 
member by undercutting the cartel price, and stealing its rivals’ downstream 
business. This would not occur if the rivals were vertically integrated. A 
downstream firm would refuse to buy from the deviant cartel member, and 
would favour its upstream division regardless of the price offered by the 
deviant firm. Integrated firms would naturally prefer any profits to accrue 
to their own affiliates rather than to rivals. Vertical integration reduces the 
number of outlets through which the deviant firm can trade, making cheat-
ing less profitable and collusion more likely to succeed (Chen and Riordan, 
2007; Nocke and White, 2007).
■ Raising entrants’ costs. Vertical restraints discourage entry by raising sunk 
costs. Exclusive distribution agreements deny outlets to entrants, who are 
obliged to develop their own distribution networks. If potential rivals are 
denied access to cheap or high-quality inputs by an integrated firm, they face an 
absolute cost advantage entry barrier. Potential entrants could also be fearful 
about certainty of supply. An upstream firm could deny sufficient inputs to a 
downstream firm, frustrating its attempts to produce at the minimum efficient 
scale (MES). Rivals’ costs as well as potential entrants’ costs may be raised

through increased innovative effort on the part of downstream firms (Banerjee 
and Lin, 2003). An innovative downstream firm benefits from reduced costs, 
which can be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, leading to 
increased demand. The downstream firm buys more inputs from upstream 
suppliers, leading to increased input prices which increase production costs, 
not only offsetting some of the benefits to the innovative downstream firm (a 
negative effect from this firm’s perspective), but also increasing the costs fac-
ing the firm’s rivals (a positive effect). Some forms of vertical restraint could 
be conducive to entry. Non-integrated producers and upstream suppliers of 
inputs could agree to set wholesale prices at levels above average cost, allow-
ing downstream producers to justify setting a higher price for their outputs. 
Accordingly, vertical separation results in higher industry prices, which may 
tend to attract entry (Bonanno and Vickers, 1988; Innes, 2006).
Cost savings
Vertical restraints have the potential to produce cost savings in cases where arm’s 
length dealing between producers and distributors via the market leads to sub-
optimal outcomes. A freerider or externality problem occurs when a retailer is 
willing to invest in marketing, but is deterred from doing so because it is unable 
to appropriate the full benefits of this effort. For example, the retailer may wish 
to invest in a large retail space, where customers can browse at their leisure and 
be advised by fully trained staff. However, a rival discount retailer could pros-
per by attracting customers who have already accessed the pre-sales service and 
undercutting the price. Consequently the service-oriented retailer may be unwill-
ing to invest in providing the service, which damages the producer because sales 
are reduced if the service is not available. To prevent such an externality, the 
producer may refuse to supply the discount retailer, or adopt a policy of resale 
price maintenance (see Section 21.3).
The European Commission (1998) recommends three tests that can be used 
to ascertain whether the freerider problem is a valid reason for imposing vertical 
restraints. First, the freeriding issue should relate to pre-sales rather than after-
sales service; second, the product should be new or technically complex, so that 
consumers actually need information; and third, the product should be relatively 
expensive, so that it would be worthwhile for a consumer to obtain information 
from one source but purchase elsewhere.
Other issues relating to the freerider problem include the question of certifica-
tion, which arises when upmarket retailers with a high reputation effectively cer-
tify the quality of a good by stocking it. This may be particularly important for 
new products, which require recognition of this kind in order to become estab-
lished. Retailers serve their customers not only by stocking products, but also 
by acting as agents who search the market for goods that are attractive to their 
customers in terms of quality. In large measure, the reputation of a retailer may 
be externally defined, and the retailer may have limited influence over the inde-
pendent assessments on which its reputation is based. Coupled with the costs of 
a damaged reputation, the fact that reputation is hard to achieve may reduce the 
likelihood of opportunistic behaviour on the part of a retailer that has established

637
an upmarket reputation. However, there may be a freerider problem if customers 
subsequently switch to a downmarket retailer in order to complete the purchase 
at a lower price, having verified quality through the certification provided by the 
upmarket retailer. The upmarket retailer may not be able to charge a premium 
price to cover the costs of certification. A solution might be for the upstream 
producer to impose a larger margin upon all downstream retailers (Marvel and 
McCafferty, 1984; Standifird and Weinstein, 2007).
	
21.3	
Forms of vertical restraint
This section examines the principal forms of vertical restraint.
Resale price maintenance
Resale price maintenance (RPM) is an arrangement whereby an upstream firm 
retains the right to control the price at which a product or service is sold by a 
downstream firm, usually in the retail market (Mathewson and Winter, 1998). 
RPM most commonly involves the fixing of a minimum price (price floor), 
although a maximum price (price ceiling) is also possible. RPM has been subject 
to criticism from two directions, one legal and the other economic. From a legal 
viewpoint, RPM can be interpreted as contrary to the principle of alienation, 
which implies that, as an individual relinquishes ownership of goods, he or she 
should have no further say in their use and disposal. From an economic view-
point, the principal concern is that RPM is anticompetitive.
■ Retailer collusion. Retailers or dealers often share information or communicate 
for benign reasons, although it is possible that informal contact develops subse-
quently into full-blown collusion. As seen earlier (see Chapter 8), any collusive 
agreement is potentially unstable, due to the possibility that one or more of 
the parties decides to take independent action. RPM may be a means by which 
price discipline, and therefore stability, can be achieved (Julien and Rey, 2000). 
Furthermore, RPM can protect the retailer cartel from entry by other retailers 
offering price discounts. This view is questioned by the Chicago school (Bork, 
1978; Posner, 1981; Ornstein, 1985), who claim that retailer cartels are rare, 
owing to relatively low entry barriers. Furthermore, there is no reason why a 
producer should wish to support a retailer cartel that might work against the 
producer’s own interests.
■ Producer collusion. Producers wishing to collude on price might be expected to 
focus on the wholesale price. This policy may be effective if retailers’ cost and 
demand conditions are stable. If these conditions vary, however, the producers 
may not know whether differences in the prices charged by different retailers 
are due to genuine differences in cost or demand conditions, or due to cheating 
by one or more of the colluding producers. RPM eliminates price variations, 
since retailers are prevented from adjusting the retail price.
Arguments in favour of RPM can be developed from both a legal and an economic 
perspective. From a legal perspective, it can be argued that the owner of a good has 

638	
|	 21    ■    Vertical restraints
the right to offer any contract associated with the sale of the good that he or she 
wishes. From an economic perspective, it can be argued that RPM permits cost sav-
ings in distribution. Success in the production and marketing of a product depends 
on the actions of both producers and retailers. It is possible for individually rational 
behaviour to lead to suboptimal outcomes for both the producer and the retailer.
One case in point arises when the demand for a product depends not only 
on price, but also on associated pre-sales services, such as convenient location, 
availability of parking space, short waiting times, displays and demonstrations, 
and information provided by staff. Producers have an incentive to ensure retail-
ers provide such services. However, the freerider problem (see Section 21.2) 
may explain why certain retailers are unable to provide the necessary service. 
For example, the UK bicycle manufacturer Raleigh argued at the Monopolies 
and Mergers Commission (1981) that the demand for bicycles depends on pre-­
delivery services such as pre-sales inspection, final assembly and adjustments, 
as well as post-delivery services such as advice, repairs and stock of spare parts. 
Raleigh argued that discount stores such as Halfords could not offer these ser-
vices and sell at a discounted price (Hardt, 1995).
Historically, however, RPM has covered products such as confectionery, 
tobacco and clothing which perhaps do not require much pre-sales service. Butz 
and Kleit (2001) suggest producers often set low price floors, to limit the level of 
discounting without excluding it altogether. By narrowing the price differential 
between discount store prices and stores offering full service, producers may hope 
to encourage full-service stores to maximise the quality of their service.
The pre-sales service and certification arguments assume producers are unable 
to contract for the provision of these services directly. A contractual solution 
may be difficult to achieve, because of problems associated with the monitoring 
of contractual obligations. Klein and Murphy (1988) and Blair and Lewis (1994) 
suggest RPM can help provide the necessary discipline for a contractual solution 
to be feasible. If the producer is happy with the level of service provided, retail-
ers earn an abnormal profit, assuming the cost of providing the service is within 
their margin. However, if the producer is unhappy with the service, the dealer’s 
quasi-rents would be lost when the producer terminates the contract.
Gilligan (1986) attempts to distinguish between allocative efficiency and mar-
ket power as motives for RPM, by examining the effect on the profits of firms 
that were subject to complaints under competition law for the use of RPM. Using 
share price changes as a proxy for changes in future profits, Gilligan finds share 
prices were affected by these challenges. This suggests RPM makes an important 
contribution to profit. Share price changes appear to be related to structural 
characteristics of the firms and their industries; this is consistent with the retailer 
and producer collusion hypotheses.
[T]he findings of this study do not support the recent recommendations 
that RPM should enjoy benign treatment under contemporary antitrust 
policy . . . The results from our study of a sample of firms that were the 
object of antitrust adjudication clearly suggest that RPM sometimes 
causes allocative distortions in manufacturing and distribution. When 
RPM appears to promote efficiencies in the distribution process, its

639
use is outlived and persists only because of marketing inertia. Calls for 
per se legality of RPM must, given the findings of this study, be based on 
grounds other than economic efficiency.
(Gilligan, 1986, pp. 554–5)
Using a different methodology, Hersch (1994) examines the share prices of 
high-volume retailers and producers associated with high RPM usage, follow-
ing the 1951 US Supreme Court Schwegmann verdict, which severely limited 
the enforcement of RPM. Hersch finds little effect on share prices, but there are 
significant differences in the impact of RPM based on firm and market charac-
teristics. This conclusion lends support to the retailer collusion hypothesis. In 
other contributions, Deneckre et al. (1996) argue that producers facing uncertain 
demand have an incentive to resort to RPM in order to maintain adequate levels 
of stock, by preventing the emergence of discount stores. Wang (2004) exam-
ines the incentives for an upstream oligopoly to impose RPM. More recently, 
Giovannetti and Magazzini (2013) interrogate a unique database of RPM com-
plaints made to the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) between 2007 and 2009. 
The authors find little evidence that RPM arises from upstream firms exerting 
market power over downstream customers. Rather, the main motives for RPM 
appear to centre around limiting price-cutting and protecting brand reputation.

High street retailers hit by claims of sports  
bra price-fixing (2013)
FT
The price of sports bras has been pushed up by collusion between some of Britain’s larg-
est department stores and a leading UK lingerie maker, the competition watchdog has 
alleged in provisional findings. The Office of Fair Trading said on Friday that John Lewis, 
Debenhams and House of Fraser, the high street retailers, made nine anti-competitive 
agreements with DB Apparel, maker of the Shock Absorber range of sports bras.
The competition watchdog said that if its investigation proved true, it would constitute 
a ‘serious infringement of competition law’. It alleged that the four companies entered 
into so-called resale price maintenance agreements between 2008-11 – a practice in which 
manufacturers set price guidelines for their distributors and retailers. ‘These alleged agree-
ments had the aim of increasing the retail prices of DBA’s Shock Absorber brand of 
sports bras in each of the three department stores,’ the OFT said. Ann Pope, its senior 
director of services, infrastructure and public markets, said: ‘Resale price maintenance 
limits competition between retailers and can lead to consumers paying higher prices’.

UK competition watchdog drops sports bra  
price-fixing probe (2014)
The UK’s competition watchdog has closed an investigation into allegations that the 
price of sports bras was pushed up by a lingerie maker and three department stores, after 
deciding there were no grounds for action. The Competition and Markets Authority on 
Friday said it would drop the case, which centred on agreements between France-based 
DB Apparel – whose brands include Wonderbra and Playtex – and high-street retailers 
John Lewis, Debenhams and House of Fraser. ‘Having carefully reviewed the evidence in 
this case, including the parties’ representations, we have decided that there are no grounds 
for action by the CMA.’

Foreclosure
Foreclosure refers to the practice of refusing to supply a downstream firm, or 
to purchase from an upstream firm. Complete or absolute foreclosure occurs 
when either a supplier obtains control over all of the downstream outlets or a 
purchaser obtains control over all of the supplying outlets. In each case, non-
integrated rivals are denied a share in the relevant market. For example, verti-
cally integrated cable operators, which make and distribute TV programmes, 
tend to exclude rival programmes from access to their distribution networks 
(Chipty, 2001; Rubinfeld and Singer, 2001).
Rey and Tirole (2007) define foreclosure as a dominant’s firm refusal of access 
to an essential good or service it produces. An essential good or service is one 
that cannot be produced efficiently by the user. Typical examples are infrastruc-
ture projects such as ports, bridges, telecommunications and computer networks. 
The dominant firm extends its market power from its bottleneck segment of the 
market to the competitive segment. Foreclosure might be either partial, such that 
the dominant firm favours some competitive users over others, or complete, such 
that the dominant firm supplies none of the competitive users. Foreclosure can be 
achieved in several ways, such as setting a very high price, or creating incompat-
ibility with the technologies of the users.
With reference to exclusive distribution and exclusive purchasing agreements, 
Dobson (1997) identifies three conditions for the effectiveness of foreclosure:
■ A sufficient proportion of upstream or downstream firms are covered by the 
exclusive agreement.
■ There are substantial barriers to entry or an inability to expand output inter-
nally at the upstream or downstream stage.
■ The agreements are of relatively long duration.

	
	
	
21.3  Forms of vertical restraint	 |	
641
In addition to the possible anticompetitive effects, Heide et al. (1998) identify a 
number of other factors that might influence the extent to which a firm pursues 
an exclusive dealing strategy. Firm size may influence the degree of exclusive 
dealing. Large firms may benefit from economies of scale and scope in distribu-
tion by developing exclusive dealerships, or from promotional economies which 
enhance the reputation of their brands. This can bring benefits to producers, 
retailers and customers through the coordination of sales efforts, enabling cus-
tomers to make informed choices. However, exclusive dealing makes it difficult 
or impossible to compare different brands at one location. Customers save on 
search costs by shopping at outlets that carry a large selection of brands. The 
implication is that exclusive dealing may cause distributors to lose custom, reduc-
ing the incentive for distributors to enter into such agreements.
Does foreclosure or exclusivity damage competition? Can dominant manufac-
turers use exclusive contracts to deter entrants? Posner (1976) and Bork (1978) 
suggest the anticompetitive effects are exaggerated. Buyers will require some 
additional benefit for entering into an exclusive contract. Why should buyers 
commit themselves to being supplied by an incumbent if potential entrants may 
be more efficient? Motta (2004) illustrates this point using the analysis shown in 
Figure 21.1. Assume there is an incumbent monopolist, a more efficient potential 
entrant, and one downstream buyer. The monopolist’s average and marginal cost 
is C1, the monopoly price and output are (P1, Q1), and the downstream buyer’s 
consumer surplus is A. The potential entrant’s average and marginal cost is C2. 
To capture the downstream buyer’s business at a price the incumbent monopolist 
cannot match, the potential entrant could offer to sell an output of Q2 at a price 
that is fractionally below C1. The potential entrant realises a profit of E + F, and 
the downstream buyer’s consumer surplus is A + B + D. To secure the down-
stream buyer’s business, the incumbent monopolist would need to offer a pay-
ment equivalent to the difference in consumer surplus, B + D. However, such a 
payment is not feasible because it exceeds the incumbent monopolist’s profit of B.
For an exclusive contract to be feasible, there must be efficiency gains to both 
the seller and the buyer, perhaps in the form of reduction or elimination of the 
transaction costs incurred in bargaining. In this case the contract should be of no 
concern to the antitrust authorities (Matouschek and Ramezzana, 2007).

642	
|	 21    ■    Vertical restraints
According to the Chicago school, foreclosure is an irrelevancy; what matters 
is the degree of concentration in the upstream and downstream markets. Vertical 
integration and foreclosure are of little consequence provided horizontal markets 
are competitive.
On the other hand, Comanor and French (1985), Ordover et al. (1990) and 
Bolton and Whinston (1993) suggest vertical mergers may reduce competition in 
input markets. As a firm vertically integrates downstream, it has less incentive to 
compete on price with other upstream suppliers. Accordingly, the upstream rivals 
can also increase their prices. In the markets for hardware and software systems, 
there is evidence that foreclosure can lead to monopolization of the hardware 
market (Church and Gandal, 2000; Chen and Riordan, 2007). Bernheim and 
Whinston (1998) are more agnostic: under different conditions, exclusive dealing 
can be anticompetitive, efficiency enhancing or simply irrelevant.
Krattenmaker and Salop (1986) suggest a number of conditions that could be 
used to determine whether competition is harmed by foreclosure:
■ Is the ability of excluded rivals to compete reduced? Exclusion might lead to an 
increase in rivals’ costs in the following cases. First, if a firm gains control over 
the entire supply of a low-cost or high-quality input, rivals might have to acquire 
inputs that are more costly or of lower quality. Second, if exclusion reduces 
the supply of inputs available on the open market, rivals are forced to bid up 
the prices of the remaining inputs. However, foreclosure need not necessarily 
increase rivals’ costs if abundant supplies are available from alternative sources.
■ Is market power increased by exclusion? The ability to foreclose need not neces-
sarily increase the firm’s market power, if it has powerful rivals or if entry is 
possible. Exclusion may harm certain competitors, without necessarily damag-
ing competition.
■ Is exclusion profitable? Foreclosure implies some sales forgone. The increase in 
profit from enhanced market power might not be enough to compensate for 
the loss of revenue.

Wetherspoon drops Heineken over Irish dispute
FT
JD Wetherspoon has ditched Heineken in a surprise move that ends a 35-year relationship 
worth an annual £60m and means the Dutch company’s beers will no longer be sold at 
one of the UK’s larger pub chains. The pub company said Heineken had refused to sup-
ply certain beers to one of its new pubs in the Irish Republic, and had asked for personal 
guarantees from Wetherspoon’s chief executive before it would supply other products.
Wetherspoon, which runs 926 pubs in the UK and Ireland, said Heineken had been 
‘obstructive’ and called its refusal to supply Heineken lager and Murphy’s stout to a 
new pub in a port town south of Dublin ‘unacceptable’. ‘The refusal to supply Heineken 
lager and Murphy’s just before the opening of our new pub in Dun Laoghaire, which

Territorial exclusivity
Producers can impose territorial restrictions which allow dealers to operate only 
in specified locations. In some cases, the dealer is restricted to operating in a par-
ticular territory, but can serve any customer who approaches them. Alternatively, 
the dealer may be obliged to serve only customers from a specified location. 
Katz (1989) suggests territorial agreements affect final consumers’ search costs. 
In order to draw comparisons, consumers may have to visit a range of outlets 
in different locations. As a result of increased search costs, consumers may be 
unwilling to shop around, in which case inter-brand competition is reduced and 
industry profits are increased. However, territorial agreements may help foster 
dealer collusion, by limiting the number of dealers in a given area. This could 
work against the producer’s interests.
Slotting allowances
Slotting allowances occur in retailing, when large buyers, such as supermarket 
chains, require fees or other payments from suppliers, such as food manufactur-
ers, to place their products in prominent positions. These could be on eye-level 
shelves, or special displays in frequently visited parts of the store. A distributional 
efficiency argument suggests that manufacturers should pay for this service, as it 
represents an investment by us of nearly €4m, is unacceptable and hard to understand,’ 
said Tim Martin, chairman, in a statement. The pub group said Heineken had asked for 
a guarantee that John Hutson, chief executive, would personally pay for the supply of 
beers to the pub, the group’s second in Ireland, if Wetherspoon itself was unable to meet 
the bill. Heineken said it had ‘a longstanding and successful relationship with JDW in the 
UK market over a 35-year period, and it is unfortunate that commercial issues in Ireland 
between Heineken Ireland and JD Wetherspoon have led to the current situation. We are 
seeking a resolution as soon as possible.’
Wetherspoon, which is known for its low prices, had been selling Heineken lager for 
less than €3 a pint at its first pub in Ireland, the pub group said. Analysts suggested that 
this may have irritated Heineken, whose beer sells for about €5 a pint on average in the 
Republic. ‘Heineken is a premium lager in Ireland and they may have seen the price point as 
detrimental to their brand image,’ said Simon Matthews, analyst at Goodbody. ‘Asking for 
personal guarantees from the CEO of a performing FTSE 250 company is highly unusual.’
The row is not Wetherspoon’s first in Ireland. This year it clashed with drinks company 
Diageo over the price of Guinness, leaving its Irish operations without the country’s most 
famous drink. Such clashes showed the difference between the pub markets in the UK and 
Ireland, said Mr Matthews. In the UK large chains had significant negotiating power, but 
in Ireland’s fragmented market, ‘power lies with the brewers,’ he said.

enables them to reach their target market more effectively. The store is entitled 
to compensation for the costs of setting up the display, and to cover the invest-
ment risk should the product fail. On the other hand, slotting allowances may be 
seen as a mechanism for enhancing market power through the creation of entry 
barriers or foreclosure. In the UK, most grocery and related sales are channelled 
through four dominant supermarket chains. Planning restrictions ensure these 
stores are in relatively short supply, leading to high entry barriers and a short-
age of shelf space. Small manufacturers that cannot afford to pay the fees set 
by the supermarket chains are precluded from marketing their products. Large 
manufacturers might be willing accomplices in paying high fees, in order to deny 
space to their smaller competitors (Dobson, 2005; Foros and Jarle Kind, 2008).
Quantity-dependent pricing
Quantity-dependent pricing implies the price per unit paid by a buyer depends on 
the quantity purchased (Katz, 1989). Several specific types of vertical restraint 
fall under this heading.
Quantity forcing
Quantity forcing occurs when a buyer is obliged to buy more than he or she would 
wish under normal circumstances. This might be achieved by forcing the buyer 
to make a minimum payment for purchases up to a certain level. Forcing buyers 
to stock and sell more than they wish may have the effect of improving service 
and reducing prices to final consumers. This latter effect could help overcome 
the problem of double marginalization (see Section 20.2).
Non-linear pricing
A two-part tariff (see Section 14.3) is an example of a non-linear pricing structure. 
With a two-part tariff, a buyer pays a fixed franchise fee, plus a price per unit. As 
the quantity bought increases, the average cost per unit falls. The policy of charg-
ing a fixed franchise fee for the opportunity of stocking and selling the product 
on top of a constant per-unit charge can also be used to eliminate double mar-
ginalization, without resorting to full-scale vertical integration. In Figure 20.4, 
(P3, Q3) is the price and quantity combination chosen by the monopoly retailer, 
with double marginalization. The monopoly producer earns an abnormal profit 
of P1P2FG, and the retailer earns an abnormal profit of P2P3EF. From the pro-
ducer’s perspective, a better solution would be to charge the retailer a franchise 
fee of P1P2CD, and to make the product available at a price per unit equiva-
lent to the producer’s marginal cost, MC1. In this case, (P2, Q2) is the price and 
quantity combination chosen by the retailer. The producer’s abnormal profit is 
provided by the franchise fee of P1P2CD.
Kay (1990b) suggests two reasons why a non-linear pricing structure might be 
attractive to a producer. First, if a retailer’s profit increases more than proportion-
ately with the total amount of business done with the producer, this should increase 
the incentive to promote the product. For example, an insurance company might 
wish independent brokers to recommend its policies above others, or a breakfast 

	
	
	
21.3  Forms of vertical restraint	 |	
645
cereal producer might wish a supermarket to display its brand prominently on 
the shelves. A non-linear price structure should provide incentives. Second, if 
retailers stock only one product or a narrow range of products, the switching and 
search costs to consumers are increased. This policy increases the producer’s mar-
ket power. Mortimer (2008) examines the effect of non-linear pricing in the video 
rental industry in the US in the 1990s. Retail outlets paid a fixed fee to the distribu-
tor for a film, and received a share of the revenue (between 40 and 60 per cent to the 
retailer). The profits of both the upstream distributors and downstream retailers 
increased through the operation of this pricing structure.
Tying
The European Commission (1999) defines tying as the selling of two or more 
distinct products, where the sale of one good is conditional on the purchase of 
another. Products are distinct if, in the absence of tying arrangements, the products 
are purchased in separate markets. For example, the supply of shoes with laces is 
not generally considered as the supply of two distinct products. In contrast, if the 
purchase of a machine entails a contractual obligation to have the machine ser-
viced by the producer’s engineers, two distinct supply markets are tied: one for the 
machine and the other for servicing. Singer (1968) suggests a number of reasons 
why tying might be an attractive option for a supplier (producer or retailer):
■ Evasion of price controls. If the price a supplier can charge for one product 
is regulated, the supplier might force its buyers also to stock an unregulated 
product at a high price, effectively evading the price control.
■ Protection of goodwill. A supplier may wish to protect the quality of its 
product by insisting repairs and spare parts are supplied only by itself. The 
supplier might argue that to have the product serviced by non-approved engi-
neers may cause damage and could harm the firm’s reputation. Whether this 
argument is justified depends on whether efficient alternatives to the tying 
arrangement exist.
■ Economies of distribution. Producers may tie two or more complementary prod-
ucts in order to benefit from economies in distribution. In principle, assembled 
products such as cars involve tying many separate products such as engines, 
crankshafts, axles, wheels, tyres and other parts.
■ Price discrimination. Suppose a monopoly supplier sells colour printers (the 
tying product) and ink cartridges (the tied product). The supplier charges a 
competitive price for its printers but prices the cartridges above their marginal 
cost. Large customers (with a low price elasticity of demand) are forced to pay 
a higher price overall, since they use proportionately more of the expensive 
cartridges than the smaller customers. Resale is ruled out since the price of car-
tridges is the same for all customers. A form of price discrimination is achieved 
indirectly. The common practice of selling machines and expensive service 
contracts can be interpreted as a similar case of covert price discrimination.
■ Leverage. A tying arrangement can extend the power of a monopolist into 
related markets, enhancing market power in the market for the tied product. 
The leverage a monopolist can exert depends on the proportion of the tied 

646

market covered by the tying arrangement, and on the effectiveness of the tying 
arrangement as a barrier to entry or as a means of sustaining collusion in 
the downstream market (Whinston, 1990; Chen and Ross, 1999; Choi and 
Stefanadis, 2001; Carlton and Waldman, 2002; Spector, 2007).
Bundling
Under the practice of bundling, a supplier offers several goods as a single pack-
age. For example, hotels offer rooms bundled with the use of facilities such as 
in-house gyms and swimming pools. The prices of all these additional services 
are included in the price of the room, whether they are used or not. Adams and 
Yellen (1976) show bundling is profitable since customers can be sorted into 
different groups with different willingness to pay, and their consumer surplus 
appropriated accordingly. In other words, bundling can be used as a form of 
price discrimination. Nalebuff (2004) shows that bundling can be an effective 
barrier to entry. A monopolist operating in two markets can bundle the goods, 
making it difficult for rivals to enter either market. An entry barrier is created 
without having to lower prices in either market.
With reference to the film industry, Stigler (1963) discusses block booking, 
which can be interpreted as a form of bundling. Block booking refers to the prac-
tice of offering an exhibitor a collection of films in a package, rather than making 
them available individually. Assume a London distributor knows the reserve 
prices of two exhibitors. One exhibitor owns an arthouse cinema in Hampstead, 
and the other owns a West End cinema which shows popular films. The reserve 
prices each exhibitor is willing to pay for two films, Citizen Kane and the latest 
Harry Potter, are presented in Table 21.2:
If each film is sold separately and the distributor is able to prevent resale, 
perfect price discrimination can be achieved. The total rental is £22,500 
(= 7,000 + 4,000 + 8,500 + 3,000). However, if it is not possible to pre-
vent resale, the best the distributor can do is to charge £7,000 for Harry

(= 7,000 + 7,000 + 3,000 + 3,000). If the distributor practices block booking 
without discrimination, the two-film package can be sold for £11,000 to both 
exhibitors. The total rental rises to £22,000.
Vertical restraints: anticompetitive or benign?
Are vertical restraints always anticompetitive? Or are they sometimes desirable on 
efficiency or welfare criteria? Or is their effect simply neutral? Much of the debate 
in Europe and the US has centred on the views of the Chicago school (Telser, 1960;

Bork, 1978; Posner, 1981). Before the views of the Chicago school came to promi-
nence, it was widely believed that vertical restraints, by their very nature, reduce 
the independence of distributors and are therefore anticompetitive. Resale price 
maintenance (RPM), for example, was seen as little different from horizontal price-
fixing, and was banned in most countries. In contrast, the Chicago school distin-
guish between vertical and horizontal restraints. Competition takes place within 
a market, and is therefore impeded by horizontal restraints but not by vertical 
restraints. Producers do not normally impose restrictions downstream that would 
reduce the level of demand for their own products. If restrictions are imposed, it is 
because a potential cost saving or efficiency gain can be realised, perhaps through 
the elimination of externalities or opportunism (Baake et al., 2004).
Since the 1970s, the tide has turned somewhat against the Chicago view 
(Comanor, 1985; Rey and Tirole, 1986). It is now customary to analyse vertical 
restraints on a case-by-case basis. Restraints may sometimes raise entry barriers 
or facilitate collusion, leading to a distortion of competition. For example, RPM 
might be used as an alternative to horizontal price-fixing, the latter being more 
obvious as well as illegal. However, why upstream firms should wish to cooperate 
in enhancing market power downstream is not always clear. Grimes (2002) analy-
ses the approach of the US legal system to vertical restraints. The US Supreme 
Court recognises that vertical restraints can be justified as a cost-effective method 
for promoting an upstream supplier’s brands. In some cases, vertical restraints may 
foster competition, and blanket condemnation of such practices is unwarranted.

Summary
Vertical restraints are conditions and restrictions on trade that are imposed by 
firms that are linked vertically. Such restrictions may be motivated by factors 
similar to those that motivate other types of vertical relationship: specifically, 
the enhancement of market power and the potential for the realization of cost 
savings. Principal types of vertical restraint are as follows:
■ Resale price maintenance (RPM) involves a producer controlling the price at 
which a product or service is sold by a retailer. RPM usually involves the fix-
ing of a minimum price, although a maximum price is also possible. RPM may 
eliminate disincentives for retailers to supply pre-sales service, or provide an 
informal quality certification service.
■ Foreclosure refers to the practice of refusing to supply a downstream firm, or 
to purchase from an upstream firm. The extent to which foreclosure damages 
competition is controversial; some economists argue that only horizontal com-
petition matters, and vertical restraints of this kind are irrelevant.
■ Territorial exclusivity is a form of geographic foreclosure, whereby a producer 
requires its retailers to trade only in specified geographic locations.
■ Quantity-dependent pricing implies the price paid by a buyer depends on the 
quantity purchased. A retailer might be obliged to stock more than he or she 
would wish; the price the retailer pays might include a fixed component and 

648	
|	 21    ■    Vertical restraints
a variable component that depends on quantity (two-part tariff); the supply 
of one product to a retailer might be made conditional on the retailer’s will-
ingness to stock a second product (tying); or several products might be sold 
together to consumers as a single package (bundling).
The many types of vertical restraints that have been examined in this chapter 
may help promote efficiency or economic welfare; may be anticompetitive; 
or may simply have a neutral effect. In the 1970s and 1980s, the views of the 
­Chicago school, who took an essentially benign view of the implications of verti-
cal restraints for competition, influenced the formulation of competition policy 
in many countries. More recent thinking suggests a more sceptical and cautious 
approach is appropriate. Although blanket condemnation of vertical restraints 
is unwarranted, it is advisable to examine the implications for competition, effi-
ciency and welfare of each case on its own individual merits.

trade to ensure prime shelf locations for new lines. Assess the pro- and anticompetitive effects 
of these payments.

Introduction
For some products or services, the value or utility to any user increases with the 
total number of users. A classic historical example is the telephone. The larger the 
number of users who connect to a telephone network, the larger is the number of 
other users with whom each user can communicate, and the greater is the value 
of the service to each user. Similar network externalities are available for other 
communications technologies, both old and new, including postal services, and 
online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Stock and other securities 
markets may feature a network externality through an increase in liquidity and 
a reduction in transaction costs as the number of traders increases. Similarly,

the value each user derives from trading in online markets or betting exchanges 
such as eBay and Betfair increases with the number of other users, as auctions 
or the markets for bets on individual sporting events become more liquid and 
more competitive.
Another type of network externality arises when an increase in the number of 
users of a core product or service stimulates the production of complementary 
products or services, and the increased availability of complements increases the 
value to each user of the core product or service. This type of network exter-
nality characterises many hardware–software markets. As the number of users 
of a particular games console increases, for example, suppliers of software are 
encouraged to produce more applications, and the value or utility derived from 
ownership of the console increases owing to the increased availability of soft-
ware. Similar examples include PC operating systems and compatible software, 
and DVD or Blu-Ray players and compatible disks. Stock markets may feature 
a similar type of network externality, through an increase in vertically related 
services (for example, brokers or investment banking services) as the number of 
traders increases.
In many markets featuring network goods or services, a key feature of the 
market that determines the extent of the network externalities is the degree of 
compatibility between the products or services of different suppliers. If systems 
are compatible, the relevant network is the aggregate number of users of all 
suppliers. If systems are incompatible, the relevant network for each user is the 
number of other users who are connected to the same supplier. In many cases the 
compatibility or incompatibility of the products or services provided by two (or 
more) suppliers depends on the suppliers’ own strategic choices.
The outcome of a battle between technologies aiming to establish supremacy 
as the industry standard may have far-reaching consequences for the survival 
and profitability of the competing suppliers. Often the coexistence of competing 
technologies is unstable. Small or early advantages gained in a standards battle 
may have decisive and far-reaching consequences, if one technology surpasses 
a tipping point beyond which all users would switch to the victor, through a 
bandwagon effect. History matters, and the preferences of early adopters may 
have considerable influence in shaping product characteristics.
Technically superior or cheaper products that arrive on the market later 
might be unable to dislodge an inferior product that arrived earlier, because 
users of the latter are already benefiting from a network effect that they are 
unwilling to forgo by switching. A first-mover advantage might prove decisive 
in determining the outcome of a standards battle. For example, the QWERTY 
keyboard was originally designed for mechanical typewriters, to slow down 
the speed of typing so as to prevent the keys from being jammed. It is claimed 
that other keyboard layouts would permit much faster typing speeds but, even 
when the mechanical problems had been solved, QWERTY remained the stan-
dard, because typists had invested too much in effort in learning to type using 
the QWERTY keyboard for a new design to be marketable. Users of a losing 
technology may incur switching costs, which they could have avoided if they 
had correctly anticipated the outcome of the standards battle. This suggests 
that consumer expectations of the future number of users are important in

influencing the purchase decision, and suppliers may face incentives to attempt 
to influence or manipulate these expectations.
This chapter describes the economics of markets that exhibit network exter-
nalities. Section 22.2 examines how a network effect modifies the specification of 
a demand function for a network product or service. In specifying demand func-
tions, a distinction is drawn between the stand-alone benefit each user derives 
from consumption of the product or service regardless of the number of other 
users, and the network benefit that increases in proportion to the number of 
other users. The properties of the demand function are examined for two cases: 
first, where the stand-alone benefit is the same for every user but different users 
attach different value to the network benefit; and second, where the stand-alone 
benefit differs between users but the network benefit is the same for every user. 
Section 22.3 examines the nature of the market equilibrium under perfect compe-
tition (large numbers of competing suppliers of the network product or service) 
and monopoly (a single supplier), for both sets of demand assumptions.
Section 22.4 extends the theoretical analysis to cover the case of duopoly, in 
which there are two competing suppliers who might prefer either compatibility 
or incompatibility between their own technical standards. Section 22.5 contains a 
less formal discussion of factors that are likely to influence the form of competi-
tion between two or more suppliers offering competing technologies. Alternative 
forms of competition include inter-technology competition, where the suppliers 
prefer incompatibility to compatibility and are willing to engage in a standards 
battle in an effort to establish their own technology as the industry standard; 
and intra-technology competition, where the suppliers prefer compatibility to 
incompatibility under any circumstances, but would prefer rivals to adopt their 
technology if they can be persuaded to do so.
	
22.2	
Demand for a network product or service
Network externalities, also known as network effects or demand-side economies 
of scale, arise from the fact that the value to any user of certain products and 
services increases in proportion to the total number of users. In communications 
markets, the value comes from the ability to communicate with other users via a 
network. As the number of users increases, the opportunities for communication 
increase, and the value to each user of belonging to the network increases. Also 
there is a stronger incentive for more individuals to join the network. In this case, 
the network externalities are direct.
Another type of network externality arises in systems markets, where value 
is obtained by combining several components, such as a piece of hardware 
and a number of compatible software applications. As the number of applica-
tions increases, the value to each user derived from ownership of the hardware 
increases. Also, there is a stronger incentive for more individuals to purchase 
the hardware and compatible software applications, and a stronger incentive 
for software designers to create further applications. In this case the network 
externalities are indirect.

Following the modelling approach adopted by Economides and Himmelberg 
(1995) and Economides (1996), suppose the utility obtained by the i-th user from 
belonging to the network takes the following form:
Ui = ti + fi(ne)
where ti denotes the stand-alone benefit to the i-th user that is independent of 
the number of other users, and fi() is the utility function that specifies user i’s 
network benefit as a function of the total number of users of the network, ne.
Different models can be derived for the determination of an equilibrium for 
the number of users under two alternative sets of assumptions concerning this 
utility function. In the first case that is considered below, it is assumed that the 
stand-alone benefit is homogeneous (the same for all users) and the network 
benefit is heterogeneous (differs between users). In the second case, conversely, it 
is assumed that the stand-alone benefit is heterogeneous and the network benefit 
is homogeneous.
In this section, price is treated as exogenously determined, and the analy-
sis focuses on the determination of the quantity demanded at the given price. 
In ­Section 22.3 some simple cost assumptions are introduced, and the analysis 
focuses on the determination of the market equilibrium price and quantity under 
supply conditions of either perfect competition or monopoly.
Heterogeneous network benefits
In the case of homogeneous stand-alone benefits and heterogeneous network 
benefits, it is assumed ti = t for all i, and fi(ne) = vine, where t is constant, and 
the population of consumers (all actual and potential users) has vi distributed 
uniformly over the interval from 0 to 1. Accordingly, the consumer who values 
the network benefit the least has vi = 0 and fi(ne) = 0 for any ne. The consumer 
who values the network benefit the most has vi = 1 and fi(ne) = ne. The utility 
of the i-th consumer is
Ui = t + vine
Let p denote the price at which membership of the network is sold. The most 
marginal consumer, who is just willing to join the network at price p, has vi = v 
so that
t + vne - p = 0 or v = (p - t)/ne
Any consumer with vi Ú v is willing to join the network at price p; consumers 
with vi 6 v do not join. Therefore the total demand to belong to the network 
is n = 1 - v. This expression implies v = 1 - n. The demand function can be 
derived from the expression
t + (1 - n)ne - p = 0

	
	
	
22.2  Demand for a network product or service	 |	
653
The inverse demand function when the total network size is ne can be written as
p = t + (1 - n)ne
In order to establish the quantity demanded at any price, a fulfilled expecta-
tions assumption can be applied. It is assumed that the total demand to belong 
to the network equals the number of network users that enters the utility function 
of each individual user, or n = ne. By substitution into the previous expression, 
the market equilibrium must satisfy the condition
p = t + (1 - n)n
Figure 22.1 illustrates the determination of quantity demanded for a price of 
p. The downward-sloping dotted line labelled p = t + (1 - n) n1
e identifies the 
inverse demand function constructed under the assumption that the number of 
network users is held constant at a relatively low level of n1
e. In this case, the high-
est price that any consumer would pay to belong to the network is p1 = t + n1
e. 
At the price of p1 (and with n1
e network users), the consumer with vi = 1 is just 
willing to belong. In order to persuade all consumers to belong, including the 
consumer with vi = 0, a lower price of t would be required.
Similarly the dotted line labelled p = t + (1 - n)n2
e identifies the inverse 
demand function constructed under the assumption that the number of net-
work users is held constant at a higher level of ne
2. The highest price that any 
consumer would pay to belong to the network is p2 = t + n2
e. At the price of 
p2 (and with n2
e network users) the consumer with vi = 1 is again just willing 
Figure 22.1  Demand for a network good, heterogeneous network benefits

654	
|	 22    ■    Network goods and services
to belong. To persuade all consumers to belong, including the consumer with 
vi = 0, a lower price of t would again be required.
In Figure 22.1, the quadratic function p = t + (1 - n)n is interpreted as the 
collection of points that satisfy the condition n = ne. At the price of p, there are 
three possible solutions for quantity demanded: n = 0, n = n1
e and n = n2
e. At 
n = 0, the price of p is above the value that all consumers place on belonging to 
the network when no others belong, equivalent to the stand-alone benefit of t. 
Consequently, no consumer chooses to belong to the network. At both n = n1
e 
and n = n2
e, the total level of demand is the same as the number of network users 
assumed in the construction of the inverse demand function. At [ p, n1
e], each 
consumer expects few consumers in total to belong to the network, and only 
those consumers with a relatively high network benefit will belong. The expecta-
tion that few consumers will belong becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: acting on 
this expectation few consumers do choose to belong. At [ p, n2
e] by contrast, each 
consumer expects many other consumers to belong to the network and many 
consumers, including some with a relatively small network benefit, will belong. 
Again the expectation that many consumers will belong becomes a self-fulfilling 
prophecy: acting on this expectation many consumers do choose to belong.
The preceding analysis identifies multiple outcomes for quantity demanded, 
owing to the presence of the network externalities. Is any of the three outcomes 
either more likely or less likely to occur in practice? By imagining a disturbance 
in the form of a small change to the price of p, the price–quantity combination 
[ p, n1
e] may be identified as unstable, and therefore unlikely to be sustained for a 
long time. By contrast, the price–quantity combination [ p, n2
e] may be identified 
as stable, and therefore more likely to be sustained.
To demonstrate the instability of [ p, n1
e], consider first a small and tempo-
rary increase in price that has perhaps been driven by an increase in costs. The 
most marginal consumers withdraw from the network because it is no longer 
worthwhile for them to belong. However, their withdrawal reduces the network 
benefit to all, resulting in a downward shift in the inverse demand function. It 
would now take a reduction in price larger than the original increase to restore 
equality between ne and n. If the cost pressure is upward, such a price reduction 
is unlikely to be forthcoming. Consequently further withdrawals will occur, and 
the market will tend to collapse in the direction of the stable price–quantity 
combination [ p,0].
Now consider a small and temporary reduction in price, again starting from 
[ p, n1
e]. Some additional consumers are attracted into the market by the lower 
price. Their arrival increases the network benefit to all, resulting in an upward 
shift in the inverse demand function. It would now take an increase in price 
larger than the original reduction to restore equality between ne and n. If no such 
increase is forthcoming, further consumers will decide to join, and the market will 
tend to expand in the direction of the stable price–quantity combination [ p, n2
e].
Repeating a similar analysis starting from [ p, n2
e], the stability of this price–
quantity combination is easily demonstrated. A small increase in price causes 
a few users to withdraw, reducing the network benefit for all, and a new price–
quantity combination is rapidly established at the higher price on a new (lower) 
inverse demand function. Similarly, a small reduction in price causes a few

655
additional consumers to join, increasing the network benefit for all, and a new 
price–quantity combination is rapidly established at the lower price on a new 
(higher) inverse demand function.
This analysis suggests that the market for goods or services that confer net-
work benefits will tend to settle either at a point at which there are no users, or 
at one with many users. The intermediate case, with a small number of users, is 
the least likely to be sustained. In other words, the network either gains wide-
spread acceptance, perhaps becoming the industry standard; or it fails to gain 
acceptance, and withers and dies.
Clearly consumer expectations and history play an important role in determin-
ing the outcome. As noted above, the analysis is based on the fulfilled expecta-
tions assumption: the assumptions of each consumer, when deciding whether 
to belong to the network, concerning the total number of users, turn out to be 
accurate. Different assumptions about expectations could lead to different out-
comes for the level of demand. History matters, because as the stability analysis 
shows, small disturbances to the solution [ p, n1
e] can have large consequences in 
either direction. There is no sure-fire mechanism to ensure that the ‘successful’ 
price–quantity combination [ p, n2
e] is always achieved, rather than the unsuccess-
ful [ p, 0]. Small disturbances, especially at the critical moments in time when the 
network is striving to gain wider or universal acceptance, might create a band-
wagon effect that could operate in either direction.
Heterogeneous stand-alone benefits
In the case of heterogeneous stand-alone benefits and homogeneous network 
benefits, it is assumed fi(ne) = vne for all i, where v is constant, and the popula-
tion of consumers (all actual and potential users) has ti distributed uniformly 
over the interval from 0 to 1. The utility of the i-th consumer is
Ui = ti + vne
As before, let p denote the price at which membership of the network is sold. 
The most marginal consumer, who is just willing to join the network at price p, 
has t i = t so that
t + vne - p = 0 or t = p - vne
For prices that produce feasible values of t such that 0 … t … 1, any consumer 
with ti Ú t is willing to join the network at price p, and any consumer with 
ti 6 t does not join. The total demand is n = 1 - t. This expression implies 
t = 1 - n. The demand function can be derived from the expression
(1 - n) + vne - p = 0
If v 6 1, the network externalities are weak. The consumer with ti = 1 val-
ues belonging to the network when all consumers belong (ne = 1) less than the 
stand-alone benefit. If v 7 1, the network externalities are strong. The consumer 

656	
|	 22    ■    Network goods and services
with ti = 1 values belonging to the network when all consumers belong (ne = 1) 
more than the stand-alone benefit. The nature of the demand function depends 
upon whether the network externalities are weak or strong. These two cases are 
considered separately.
Weak network externalities, v * 1
■ At the price p = 1, the consumer with ti = 1 is just willing to belong to the 
network, even if no other members belong (ne = 0). For any p 7 1, no mem-
ber is willing to belong.
■ At the price p = v, the consumer with ti = 0 is just willing to belong to the 
network, provided all other members belong (ne = 1). For any p 6 v, all 
members are willing to belong.
■ At prices in the range v 6 p 6 1, the quantity demanded is determined by 
setting n = ne and solving (1 - n) + vn - p = 0, or p = 1 - (1 - v)n, for 
n. The solution is n = (1 - p)/(1 - v). Accordingly, [ p, (1 - p)/(1 - v)] is a 
feasible solution for v 6 p 6 1.
Figure 22.2 illustrates the solution for the case of weak network externalities. 
In the range v 6 p 6 1, quantity demanded is a decreasing function of price, 
because -1/(1 - v) 6 0. Intuitively, if the stand-alone benefit dominates the 
network benefit, the demand function is downward-sloping and similar to that 
for any regular (non-network) good or service (for which all of the benefit to the 
consumer is stand-alone). For every price, there is a unique solution for quantity 
demanded.

network externalities

657
Strong network externalities, v + 1
■ At the price p = 1 when ne = 0, the consumer with ti = 1 is just willing to 
belong to the network. For any p 7 1 when ne = 0, no member is willing to 
belong. Accordingly [ p, 0] is a feasible solution for p 7 1.
■ At the price p = v when ne = 1, the consumer with ti = 0 is just willing to 
belong to the network. For any p 6 v when ne = 1, all members are willing 
to belong. Accordingly [ p, 1] is a feasible solution for p 6 v.
■ At prices in the range 1 6 p 6 v, quantity demanded is determined by setting 
n = ne and solving (1 - n) + vn - p = 0, or p = 1 + (v - 1)n, for n. The 
solution is n = (p - 1)/(v - 1). Accordingly, [ p, (p - 1)/(v - 1)] is a feasible 
solution for 1 6 p 6 v.
Figure 22.3 illustrates the solution for the case of strong network externalities. 
In the range 1 6 p 6 v, quantity demanded is an increasing function of price, 
because -1/(1 - v) 7 0. Intuitively, if the network benefit dominates the stand-
alone benefit, the demand function is upward-sloping. As more consumers belong, 
the value to each consumer of belonging increases, and the ­willingness-to-pay of 
each consumer also increases. There are three possible solutions for every price, 
a situation resembling the position in the case of heterogeneous network benefits. 
In particular, the intermediate solution [ p, (1 - p)/(1 - v)] is likely to be unsta-
ble, for the same reasons as before. A small increase in price would cause some 
marginal consumers to withdraw, leading to a reduction in the network benefit 
for all, and further withdrawals. The market moves in the direction of the stable 
solution [ p, 0]. A small reduction in price would cause some additional marginal

consumers to join, leading to an increase in the network benefit for all, and 
further arrivals. The market moves in the direction of the stable solution [ p, 1].

Rightmove: homes and castles
FT
The onset of British Summer Time heralds the start of peak season for selling houses. 
Curtain-twitchers wondering what the neighbours are asking for their pad usually do their 
snooping on Rightmove, the UK’s leading property website. Yet there can hardly be a 
house in the land that has appreciated more than shares in the eponymous company; up 
almost 12-fold since floating in 2006. Extraordinary profits are not supposed to last. Juicy 
margins should attract new capital, which whittles them down to more ordinary levels. 
Rightmove is an exception. Far from shrinking, its margins have expanded, even though 
sales have grown at 22 per cent a year since the IPO.
The company is a case study in network effects. Its near-80 per cent market share means 
that estate agents must use it. The site is free for consumers, and the monthly fees that 
agents pay are relatively small in relation to their other expenses, so there is no incentive to 
cut spending. Then there is the operational gearing: Rightmove’s sales have risen almost 
sixfold since 2006, but selling and general expenses (the biggest component of operating 
costs) have merely tripled.
What could disrupt this virtuous circle? Competitors such as Zoopla have yet to slow 
the Rightmove juggernaut. A prolonged housing market downturn could, but it would 
take time. Rightmove is not directly dependent on transaction volumes or prices, as 
estate agents are. A slowdown would have to be prolonged enough to reduce the number 
of agents in order to have any lasting effect. Figures from the National Association of 
Estate Agents confirm what a glance down any British high street suggests: numbers are 
rising. This defensive moat comes at a price, of course. Like houses, Rightmove shares 
are changing hands at their highest multiple of earnings in recent history. In both cases, 
it is hard to see that changing.

The analysis of the market equilibrium price and quantity requires the superim-
position of cost and supply assumptions onto the preceding analysis of quantity 
demanded. In this section it is assumed that the supplier of the network product 
or service faces a linear total cost function, and incurs a constant marginal

cost of connecting each consumer to the network, denoted c. As in the previ-
ous section, separate analyses are required for the following two demand-side 
cases: first, heterogeneous network benefits (and homogeneous stand-alone 
benefits); and second, heterogeneous stand-alone benefits (and homogeneous 
network benefits).
Heterogeneous network benefits
In the case of heterogeneous network benefits, the downward-sloping seg-
ment of the curved function labelled p = t + (1 - n)n in Figure 22.1 identi-
fies the range of feasible and stable non-zero pairings of price and quantity 
demanded; and the analysis of the nature of the market equilibrium focuses 
on this segment. Although this function is interpreted as a collection of points, 
and not as a demand or average revenue function in the regular sense, from 
the supplier’s perspective it plays the same role as an average revenue func-
tion, by identifying feasible combinations of price and quantity demanded. 
This means it is possible to identify a corresponding marginal revenue func-
tion, MR = t + 2n - 3n2, which bears the same relation to the collection 
of feasible price–quantity combinations as does a ‘regular’ marginal revenue 
function to the corresponding average revenue. The maximum value of the 
‘average revenue’ function p = t + (1 - n)n, located at n = 1/2, is t + 1/4; 
the value of the marginal revenue function at n = 1/2 is also t + 1/4; and the 
value of this function at n = 1 is t - 1. Appendix 1 contains a mathematical 
derivation of these results.
Figure 22.4 identifies the market equilibria for four possible values of marginal 
cost, denoted c1, c2, c3, c4, in the case where the supply of the network product 
or service is perfectly competitive. In accordance with the standard model of

perfect competition, the market equilibrium is located at the point where price 
equals marginal cost, subject to the constraint that market demand cannot 
exceed the maximum of n = 1. Accordingly, the equilibrium prices are p*
j = cj 
for j = 1, . . . , 4. When the marginal cost is either c1 or c2 (where c1 6 t - 1, 
and t - 1 6 c2 6 t), the market equilibrium quantity is n*
1 = n*
2 = 1. When 
the marginal cost is c3 (where t 6 c3 6 t + 1/4), the equilibrium quantity is 
n*
3 (where 1/2 6 n*
3). When the marginal cost is c4 = t + 1/4, the equilibrium 
quantity is n*
4 = 1/2.
Figure 22.5 illustrates a similar analysis in the case where the supplier of the net-
work product or service is a monopolist. In accordance with the standard model 
of monopoly, the market equilibrium is located at the point where the derived 
‘marginal revenue’ function equals marginal cost, again subject to the constraint 
that market demand cannot exceed the maximum of n = 1. The equilibrium 
prices are denoted pj
m for j = 1,c, 4. Note that pj
m 7 pj* for j = 1,c, 3, 
but p4
m 7 p4*. When the marginal cost is c1, the market equilibrium quantity is 
n1
m = 1 (the same as in the case of perfect competition). When the marginal cost 
is c2, the market equilibrium quantity is n2
m 6 n2* = 1. When the marginal cost 
is c3, the equilibrium quantity is n3
m 6 n3
m 6 1. Finally, when the marginal cost is 
c4, the equilibrium quantity is n4
m = 1/2 = n4*.
In summary, when the marginal cost is sufficiently low (for c = t - 1), both 
perfect competition and monopoly lead to full market coverage. When the 
marginal cost is higher (for t - 1 6 c 6 t + 1/4), monopoly leads to lower 
coverage than perfect competition. In any of these cases (for c 6 t + 1/4), the 
monopoly price exceeds the market equilibrium price under perfect competi-
tion. In the limiting case c = t + 1/4 (above which the market would not be 
supplied), perfect competition and monopoly lead to identical coverage and 
identical prices.

Heterogeneous stand-alone benefits
Section 22.2 has noted a tendency for quantity demanded to gravitate to the 
extreme values of either n = 0 or n = 1 in the case of strong network externali-
ties. In this subsection, accordingly, the comparison of perfect competition and 
monopoly is limited to the case of weak network externalities.
The downward-sloping segment of the function labelled p = 1 - (1 - v)n in 
Figure 22.2 can be interpreted directly as a demand or average revenue function 
in the range v 6 p 6 1 and 0 6 n 6 1. The corresponding marginal revenue 
function, MR = 1 - 2(1 - v)n, assumes the usual position relative to this aver-
age revenue function, and at n = 1 attains a value of 2v - 1 (see Appendix 1).
Figure 22.6 identifies the market equilibria for four possible values of mar-
ginal cost, denoted c1, c2, c3, c4 (but not representing the same values as in 
­Figures 22.4 and 22.5), in the case where the supply of the network product or 
service is perfectly competitive. As before, the equilibrium prices are pj* = cj 
for j = 1, . . . , 4. When the marginal cost is either c1 or c2 (where c1 6 2v - 1, 
and 2v - 1 6 c2 6 v), the market equilibrium quantity is n1* = n2* = 1. When 
the marginal cost is c3 (where v 6 c3 6 1), the equilibrium quantity is n3* 6 1. 
When the marginal cost is c4 = 1, only the consumer with ti = 1 is willing to join 
at a price of p4* = c4 = 1. Under the large numbers assumption, this consumer 
represents a negligible portion of the entire potential market, so the equilibrium 
quantity is n4* ≅0.
Figure 22.7 illustrates a similar analysis in the case where the supplier of the 
network product or service is a monopolist. The equilibrium prices are denoted 
pj
m for j = 1, . . . , 4. As before pj
m 7 pj* for j = 1, . . . , 3, but p4
m = p4*. When 
the marginal cost is c1, the market equilibrium quantity is n1
m = 1 (the same as 
in the case of perfect competition). When the marginal cost is c2, the market

equilibrium quantity is n2
m 6 n2* = 1. When the marginal cost is c3, the equilib-
rium quantity is n3
m 6 n3* 6 1. Finally, when the marginal cost is c4, the equilib-
rium quantity is n4
m = n4* ≅0.
In summary, and with very close parallels to the heterogeneous network ben-
efits case, when the marginal cost is sufficiently low (for c 6 v), both perfect 
competition and monopoly lead to full market coverage. When the marginal cost 
is higher (for v 6 c 6 1), monopoly leads to lower coverage than perfect compe-
tition. In all of these cases (for c = 1), the monopoly price exceeds the perfectly 
competitive price. In the limiting case c = 1 (above which the market would not 
be supplied), perfect competition and monopoly lead to identical coverage and 
identical prices.
Welfare properties of the perfectly competitive and monopoly 
equilibria, and network externalities
The finding that for marginal cost within specified ranges of values, the monopo-
list achieves lower coverage and charges a higher price than would be realised 
under a perfectly competitive structure, leads to the standard conclusion that 
monopoly is welfare-reducing in comparison with perfect competition. How-
ever, in the range of marginal costs for which neither perfect competition nor 
monopoly achieves full coverage, it can be shown that neither structure achieves 
the socially optimal coverage of the network good or service. Appendix 1 shows 
that in the models considered in this section, the socially optimal coverage is 
always full coverage with quantity supplied and demanded of n = 1.
Accordingly, network externalities may give rise to a form of market failure. 
At both the perfectly competitive equilibrium and the monopoly equilibrium,

there are unexploited gains that could have been realised from further trade. 
When consumers decide whether to join the network, they only take account of 
their private benefit, and not the social benefit their decision to join confers upon 
other consumers. When marginal costs are sufficiently high to prevent full cov-
erage from being achieved, the producers also fail to capture these unexploited 
gains from further trade. The resulting market equilibrium coverage is less than 
the socially optimal coverage, and allocative efficiency is not achieved.

Market equilibrium price and quantity for a network 
good or service: duopoly
This section presents a model of competition between two duopolists, who com-
pete to supply a product or service with network externalities, in the case of 
heterogeneous stand-alone benefits. The model, originally developed by Cremer 
et al. (2000), builds on the earlier work of Katz and Shapiro (1985). A key feature 
of this model is that it allows for different levels of compatibility between the 
products or services of the two suppliers. The polar cases are perfect compat-
ibility and complete incompatibility. With perfect compatibility a customer of 
either supplier can connect seamlessly with customers of both suppliers, and each 
customer’s network benefit depends on the total number of customers. With 
complete incompatibility, a customer of either supplier can connect with cus-
tomers of the same supplier, but not with customers of the other supplier. Each 
customer’s network benefit depends on the number of customers of their own 
supplier. The model also allows for partial compatibility: the case where custom-
ers can connect with customers of the other supplier, but not seamlessly. In this 
case, a customer’s marginal network benefit when their own supplier acquires an 
additional customer is larger than their marginal network benefit when the other 
supplier acquires an additional customer; but the latter is positive and not zero 
(as it is in the case of complete incompatibility).
The other change to the set-up in Sections 22.2 and 22.3 is that the two suppli-
ers are each assumed to have a number of existing customers, who are locked in 
as a result of having entered into previously signed contracts. Below, each sup-
plier’s locked-in existing customers are referred to as its installed base. A degree 
of asymmetry between the two suppliers is introduced into the model when the 
size of the installed base is assumed to differ between the two suppliers.
As before, for the case of heterogeneous stand-alone benefits it is assumed 
that the population of unconnected consumers has ti distributed uniformly over 
the interval from 0 to 1. The utility of the i-th consumer if they are supplied by 
firm j (for j = A,B) is
Ui = ti + v[(bj + qj
e) + u(bk + qk
e)]
where bj is the installed base (number of existing customers) and qj
e is the expected 
number of new customers of the consumer’s own supplier j (for j = A,B); bk is 
the installed base and qk
e is the expected number of new customers of the other 

664	
|	 22    ■    Network goods and services
supplier k ≠j; and 0 … u … 1 is the compatibility parameter. u = 0 implies 
complete incompatibility, 0 6 u 6 1 implies partial compatibility, and u = 1 
implies perfect compatibility. It is assumed bA Ú bB.
Let pj denote the price at which membership is sold by supplier j. If both net-
works are to attract positive numbers of new customers, pA and pB must be set in 
such a way that the most marginal customer, with ti = t, is indifferent between 
joining either network or remaining unconnected. This condition implies
pA - v[(bA + qe A) + u(bB + qe B)]
= pB - v[(bB + qe B) + u(bA + qe A)] = t
or
pA = v[(bA + qe A) + u(bB + qe B)] + t and 
pB = v[(bB + qe B) + u(bA + qe A)] + t
Let qj denote the actual number of new customers of each supplier j (for 
j = A,B). If the most marginal customer has ti = t, then the total number of 
new customers is qA + qB = 1 - t; therefore t = 1 - (qA + qB). Substituting 
into the two previous expressions, applying the fulfilled expectations assumption 
so qA = qA
e  and qB = qB
e , and rearranging, yields the following expressions for 
the two suppliers’ inverse demand functions
 pA = 1 + v(bA + ubB) - (1 - v)qA - (1 - uv)qB;
 pB = 1 + v(bB + ubA) - (1 - v)qB - (1 - uv)qA
Let c denote the marginal cost to each supplier of connecting a new customer 
to the supplier’s own network, assumed to be the same for both suppliers. For 
any given level of compatibility (treating the parameter u as fixed), each supplier 
chooses qj to maximise its own profit. The profit functions are:
pj = (pj - c)qj = [1 + v(bj + ubk) - (1 - v)qj - (1 - uv)qk - c]qj
for j = A,B, k ≠j
Using the two profit functions, which depend upon both qA and qB, it is pos-
sible to derive a Cournot–Nash equilibrium by maximizing pA with respect to 
qA while treating qB as fixed, and simultaneously maximizing pB with respect to 
qB while treating qA as fixed. The solutions for qA and qB are
 qA* = 1
2¢ 2(1 - c) + v(1 + u)(bA + bB)
2(1 - v) + (1 - uv)
+
(1 - u)v(bA - bB)
2(1 - v) - (1 - uv) b
 qB* = 1
2¢ 2(1 - c) + v(1 + u)(bA + bB)
2(1 - v) + (1 - uv)
- (1 - u)v(bA - bB)
2(1 - v) - (1 - uv)b
At the Cournot–Nash equilibrium, the maximised profits of the two suppliers are 
pj* = (1 - v)(qj*)2, and the consumer surplus is S = (1/2)(qA* + qB*)2. Using these 

	
	
	22.4  Market equilibrium price and quantity for a network good or service: duopoly	 |	
665
expressions, it is easily shown that an improvement in compatibility (an increase 
in u) has two effects.
First, there is a demand expansion effect: total quantity demanded from the 
two suppliers, qA* + qB*, increases as u increases. This follows from
qA* + qB* = 2(1 - c) + v(1 + u)(bA + bB)
2(1 - v) + (1 - uv)
The right-hand-side expression is increasing in u. As compatibility increases, the 
value to consumers of both suppliers’ products or services increases. Total output 
increases as a consequence, and so too does consumer surplus.
Second, there is a quality differentiation effect: the difference between the 
quantities demanded from the two suppliers, qA* - qB*, increases as u decreases. 
This follows from
qA* - qB* =
(1 - u)v(bA - bB)
2(1 - v) - (1 - uv)
The right-hand side expression is decreasing in u. When compatibility is only 
partial, or if there is complete incompatibility, supplier A with the larger installed 
base benefits from a superior perceived quality, and becomes dominant in the 
market for new customers. An important result in the economics of networks 
follows directly from this result. Increased compatibility is less attractive for the 
supplier with the larger installed base.
To this point, compatibility has been treated as an exogenously determined 
parameter. Often, however, the compatibility or incompatibility of the network 
products or services provided by two (or more) suppliers is a consequence of stra-
tegic decisions taken by the suppliers. When the network externalities are large, 
the choice between compatibility and incompatibility may have far-­reaching 
consequences in practice for the survival and profitability of the suppliers, both 
individually and collectively. The suppliers might agree or disagree over the desir-
ability of compatibility, and whether or not compatibility is achieved might be 
beyond any supplier’s individual control.
Katz and Shapiro (1985) highlight two possible mechanisms for achieving 
compatibility. First, the suppliers might reach a collective decision to adopt a 
common standard. If compatibility increases total profitability, but does not 
increase the profitability of every supplier individually, side-payments might be 
used to ensure that all suppliers benefit from the adoption of a common stan-
dard. Side-payments might take the form of licence fees, or compensation for 
the cost of conversion to the common standard. Second, the construction of an 
adapter might enable a single firm to act unilaterally to make its product or ser-
vice compatible with those of other suppliers. Based on an assumption that the 
costs of achieving compatibility are fixed, Katz and Shapiro demonstrate a num-
ber of propositions concerning the private and social incentives for compatibility.
Let ∆pA and ∆pB denote the changes in profits of suppliers A and B, and 
∆p = ∆pA + ∆pB denote the total change in profit, as a consequence of 
achieving compatibility. Let ∆S denote the change in consumer surplus. Let 
∆W = ∆p + ∆S denote the change in total welfare. Let F denote the fixed 

666

cost of achieving compatibility. F is assumed to be payable by both suppliers 
in the case where compatibility is achieved through the adoption of an industry 
standard; or by the supplier that constructs the adapter in the case where compat-
ibility is achieved through the construction of an adapter.
The Katz and Shapiro analysis is based on the following two conclusions, 
which follow from the previous analysis of the demand expansion effect and the 
quality differentiation effect:
■ Any move to complete compatibility is welfare-enhancing. This follows from 
∆p 7 0 and ∆S 7 0, therefore ∆W 7 0.
■ Other things being equal, the supplier with the smaller installed base has the 
stronger private incentive to achieve compatibility.
In the case where the compatibility mechanism is adoption of a common 
standard, the prospects of achieving compatibility depend upon whether side-
payments are feasible. If side-payments are not feasible, a move to perfect com-
patibility requires ∆pA 7 F  and ∆pB 7 F. If side-payments are feasible, a 
move to perfect compatibility requires ∆p 7 2F. The former is a more stringent 
requirement than the latter. Even when side-payments are feasible, however, 
profit-maximizing suppliers might fail to achieve the welfare-maximizing out-
come of perfect compatibility. In the case ∆p 6 2F 6 ∆W, perfect compatibil-
ity is socially optimal, but there is insufficient private incentive for the suppliers 
to achieve perfect compatibility.
In the case where the compatibility mechanism is the construction of an 
adapter, the supplier with the smaller installed base, supplier B, has the stronger 
private incentive to achieve compatibility by means of an adapter. Supplier B’s 
private incentive is ∆pB - F. The social incentive is ∆pA + ∆pB + ∆S - F. 
From the previous discussion, the difference between the private incentive 
and the social incentive, ∆pA + ∆S, might be either positive or negative. The 
change in consumer surplus resulting from complete compatibility, ∆S, is posi-
tive, but the change in supplier A’s profit, ∆pA, might be negative and larger in 
absolute magnitude than ∆S. This implies supplier B’s incentive to construct 
an adapter might be either too high or too low from the perspective of social 
welfare maximization.

Regulators should not rush to curb Uber  
and Airbnb
FT
Evidence-free policy rarely works out well. Unfortunately, there is a lot of it around when 
it comes to the big ‘sharing economy’ companies, like Uber and Airbnb. Even though 
the car-hailing service Uber operates pretty much like taxi companies in many European

667
cities (or perhaps because it does), the older firms are lobbying fervently against it. As 
for Airbnb, some cities (such as Amsterdam and Berlin) have introduced restrictions on 
residents being able to rent out their rooms or properties on the platform.
Part of the fuss is the usual dislike established businesses have for successful newcom-
ers, which regulators ought to ignore because of the consumer benefits of competition, 
but sometimes give way to. There is a whiff of anti-Americanism too; most European 
‘sharing’ platform businesses are still too small to have ruffled incumbents’ feathers, but 
the few larger ones (only French-born BlaBlaCar is on a remotely comparable scale) do 
not attract the same kind of criticism as Uber and Airbnb.
However, the scale of this activity (‘peer-to-peer’ is a more descriptive, less emotional 
term than ‘sharing’) should give regulators pause before they restrict the platforms further. 
A recent Eurobarometer survey found that 17 per cent of EU respondents had used one of 
these platforms, and 5 per cent had already provided a service through them. That is a lot 
of voters. Besides, regulators really should have some evidence before they restrict the eco-
nomic activities of citizens. What, in fact, are the harms, and benefits, of the big platforms?
The answer is that nobody has any idea, except for the revealed preference (as an econo-
mist would term it) of the millions of people using the services as suppliers (hosts or drivers) 
or customers. Almost all the economic studies available use US data, generally provided 
by the companies themselves. An important phenomenon such as this needs some reli-
able data. In the UK, the Office for National Statistics has recognised this and is working 
out how to collect relevant statistics. The data also need to be relevant; US studies tell us 
little about the impact of the digital ‘sharing’ platforms in Europe. This includes the ‘gig 
economy’ aspect, as labour markets operate so differently on the two sides of the Atlantic.
The economic analysis of digital peer-to-peer platforms (part of the work for which 
Jean Tirole of the Toulouse School of Economics won the Nobel Prize in 2014) makes it 
clear that they will grow very rapidly once past a critical tipping point because of the 
strength of the ‘indirect network effects’: people supplying a service benefit from there 
being more buyers, and buyers benefit from there being more suppliers. Growing to 
the point at which this virtuous circle takes off is difficult because the two sides have 
to be expanded in the right balance with each other, usually by one side subsidising the 
other (for example, the traveller pays Airbnb about 12 per cent, the host 3 per cent). Scale 
is important. Finance is needed at scale to cover losses up to the tipping point. The bigger 
the market, too, the sooner the virtuous circle is reached. So it is no wonder American 
businesses are dominant, as they can start in their large home market.
Even so, the impacts are local. The services supplied on P2P platforms are tied to 
specific cities. With Airbnb the relevant questions are: Are hosts acting like hotels but 
not subject to the same regulatory burden or requirement to collect tourism taxes, while 
disturbing residential areas with short-term visitors? Are they withdrawing properties 
from the private rental market? Or is this additional supply enabled by the platform? The 
answers will depend on local circumstances.
At the moment I am working with some data on nearly a quarter of a million Airbnb 
listings in 14 European cities — web-scraped data provided by the information service 
Airdna. Even at an early stage in the work it is clear the cities differ significantly from 

668	
|	 22    ■    Network goods and services
each other. The majority of properties listed in every city have an occupancy rate of less 
than 50 per cent (and the average is 30 per cent with significant seasonal fluctuation), but 
the figure goes as high as 65 per cent (Amsterdam) or 85 per cent (Frankfurt).
The proportion of occupancy for single rooms rather than whole apartments or houses 
ranges from 64 per cent in Manchester down to 13 per cent in Paris. Only a small percent-
age of hosts made more than $30,000 in 12 months on the platform, the highest being 6 
per cent of hosts in London, with much smaller proportions elsewhere. Hosting rarely 
seems to be a professionalised activity: the great majority of hosts (between 70 per cent 
in Barcelona and 91 per cent in Paris) list just one property. Some of the multiple listings 
also turn out to be companies managing Airbnb properties for individual hosts.
There is much more to do to understand the effects on local hotel and rental markets. 
But if this picture of hundreds of thousands of Airbnb hosts making typically small 
amounts of extra income with relatively low occupancy of their property is robust, regula-
tors will not make themselves popular by limiting that opportunity. Nor will they boost 
the chances of a digital P2P platform growing to successful scale in Europe. The benefits 
of such platforms for the providers who use them as well as the customers can be very 
large indeed. As the European Commission recommended in its recent pronouncement 
on the ‘sharing economy’, policymakers should be aiming to grow these activities. The 
big digital platforms raise many difficult policy challenges, especially for competition 
authorities, but they provide big benefits too.

Forms of competition over standardization and 
compatibility
Strategies and tactics in competition between rival suppliers over compatibility 
or standardization are discussed by Besen and Farrell (1994), who examine the 
technology choices made by two suppliers A and B which could, in principle, 
adopt either technology 1 or technology 2. Each supplier might have a preference 
for one of the technologies over the other; the two technologies might previously 
have been developed by the two suppliers (technology 1 by supplier A, and tech-
nology 2 by supplier B), so each supplier has an interest in its ‘own’ technology 
becoming the industry standard. The technologies are incompatible, and the 
payoffs to each supplier depend on the adoption decisions of both suppliers, as 
summarised by the following payoff matrix:
Supplier B adopts
Technology 1
Technology 2
Technology 1
a1,1, b1,1
a1,2, b1,2
Supplier A adopts
Technology 2
a2,1, b2,1
a2,2, b2,2

	
	
	
22.5  Forms of competition over standardization and compatibility	 |	
669
Although the payoff matrix suggests certain analogies with game theory, Besen 
and Farrell suggest that this intuition should not be extended too far. It is not clear, 
for example, that the actions of the two suppliers are truly simultaneous, or that 
each supplier is unaware of the other supplier’s action at the moment in time when 
it decides upon its own action. Instead, Besen and Farrell focus on three possible 
forms of competition that could emerge from the situation summarised by the payoff 
matrix: first, inter-technology competition or incompatibility is preferred by both 
suppliers; second, intra-technology competition or compatibility is preferred by both 
suppliers; and third, one supplier prefers inter-technology competition or incompat-
ibility, while the other prefers intra-technology competition or compatibility.
Inter-technology competition (Tweedledum and Tweedledee)
If the off-diagonal payoffs exceed the on-diagonal payoffs, or a1,2 7 a2,2, a2,1 7 a1,1 
and b1,2 7 b1,1 and b2,1 7 b2,2, then both suppliers prefer incompatibility to com-
patibility. This case is characterised by Besen and Farrell as ‘Tweedledum and 
Tweedledee’, after two fictional characters in an English nursery rhyme who 
agree to take part in a battle that never actually transpires. Tweedledum and 
Tweedledee also appear in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass.
If each supplier has ‘ownership’ of one of the technologies, then it is likely 
that each supplier will adopt its ‘own’ technology. This situation is likely to arise 
when the two suppliers are symmetric, and the battle between the two technolo-
gies to become the industry standard does not inhibit adoption by consumers 
(compatibility is unimportant). Possible tactics in inter-technology competition 
to become the industry standard include the following:
■ Building an early lead. A technology with a large installed base is difficult to 
displace, even if the alternative is cheaper or technically superior. Early com-
petition might include aggressive discounting to attract early customers, or 
exaggerated claims concerning the number of customers in cases where the 
installed base is imperfectly observable to customers.
■ Influencing the supply of complements to the supplier’s own technology. The 
attractiveness to consumers of a games console, for example, increases with 
the quantity of available compatible software products.
■ Pre-announcements of new versions or new products. Pre-announcements might 
be made to deter consumers from adopting a rival’s technology prior to the 
introduction of the new version or new product; though they could also have 
the negative consequence of deterring consumers from adopting the supplier’s 
own current version.
■ Price commitments. A public commitment to keep the price or subscription fee 
at a low level for a long period might be helpful in encouraging adoption.
Intra-technology competition (Battle of the sexes)
If the on-diagonal payoffs exceed the off-diagonal payoffs, or a1,1 7 a2,1, a2,2 7 a1,2 
and b1,1 7 b1,2 and b2,2 7 b2,1, then both suppliers prefer compatibility to incom-
patibility. This case is characterised as ‘Battle of the sexes’ (see also Section 9.4). A 

670	
|	 22    ■    Network goods and services
male–female couple always prefers being together to being apart; but he would rather 
they both attend a football match, while she would rather they both attend ballet.
This situation is likely to arise when the suppliers are symmetric, and a battle 
between the two technologies to become the industry standard would inhibit adop-
tion by consumers (compatibility is important). If both suppliers can agree as to 
which technology is preferable, then standardization is straightforward to achieve. 
On the contrary, if each supplier has ‘ownership’ of one of the technologies and 
each would prefer its ‘own’ technology to become the industry standard, but each 
would nevertheless prefer adoption of the other supplier’s technology to incompat-
ibility, then either supplier might attempt to persuade the other to adopt its ‘own’ 
technology. Tactics might include commitments and concessions. Commitments 
visibly reduce the payoff of the supplier concerned from adopting its rival’s technol-
ogy. Relevant actions might include investment in additional production capacity, 
or further expansion of the installed base. The following concessions are designed 
to make it more attractive for the rival to adopt the supplier’s ‘own’ technology:
■ Low-cost licensing of the technology.
■ Creation of a hybrid standard that combines the technologies of more than 
one supplier.
■ Commitments to cooperate in future development of the technology.
■ Shifting future development to a neutral third party.
Any of the latter three concessions might be used primarily to provide reas-
surance to rivals that the original ‘owner’ of the technology will not exploit its 
‘ownership’ to the disadvantage of its rivals once the technology has become the 
industry standard.
One supplier prefers inter-technology competition, the other 
prefers intra-technology competition (Pesky little brother)
If the off-diagonal payoffs exceed the on-diagonal payoffs for one supplier, 
or a1,2 7 a2,2, a2,1 7 a1,1, but the opposite is true for the other supplier, or 
b1,1 7 b1,2 and b2,2 7 b2,1, then the first supplier prefers incompatibility and the 
second prefers compatibility. This case is characterised as ‘Pesky Little Brother’: 
the older of two siblings prefers to play alone, while the younger prefers to play 
with his older sibling.
This situation is likely to arise when the two suppliers are asymmetric. As the 
earlier analysis of the quality differentiation effect (see Section 22.4) suggests, a 
dominant supplier (supplier A) with a large installed base prefers incompatibility 
and inter-technology competition; the same might be true in other situations of 
asymmetry, such as one supplier having a markedly superior technology, or a 
powerful reputation. The smaller rival (supplier B), by contrast, prefers compat-
ibility and intra-technology competition. If supplier A is powerless to prevent 
imitation, then compatibility will follow. If supplier A is able to assert property 
rights over its ‘own’ technology, however, through copyright protection or pat-
enting, then A might be in a position to assert its preference for incompatibility. 
Alternatively, frequent changes of technology might be used as a tactic by a 
dominant supplier to make imitation more difficult or more costly.

Uber: it pays to be first
FT
Sometimes it pays to be biggest — and to be first. This is the obvious lesson from the way 
Uber has steamrollered across the world, raising $5bn from investors and launching in 
55 countries in five years. Uber is not the only ride in town though: ride-hailing apps are 
proliferating, with investment in these start-ups passing $8bn. Uber may close soon on 
another $1bn fundraising, while its US competitor Lyft is working on a nine-digit round. 
In India, where Uber temporarily suspended its New Delhi service in December because 
of concerns about passenger safety, market leader Ola Cabs has bought its smaller rival 
TaxiForSure, consolidating its leading position. And companies that are not consolidat-
ing are retrenching to focus on core markets: Hailo has pulled out of the US, and Easy 
Taxi has pulled back from Mumbai and Jakarta.
The rush to secure funding — and gain market share — is premised on the dynamics of 
two-sided network effects: whoever has most customers, and most drivers, wins. Having 
more drivers creates a better customer experience and attracts more customers, and vice 
versa. There is a catch though: when it comes to calling a car, the network effect is local. 
The number of countries in which Uber operates has no bearing on whether your Uber 
car arrives promptly in New York City. There is no great benefit to having the same car 
service in London and in Barranquilla. So while Uber appears to be doing very well in 
markets where it was a first mover, it has struggled in more recent markets such as India 
and China.
Uber’s competition appreciate how localised the market is — and are consolidating. In 
China, the two largest ride-hailing companies are set to merge, creating an operator that 
will control 99 per cent of the market. When it comes to ride-hailing, there is money to 
be made in controlling each local market. But the global market will not be dominated 
by any single player. Uber, of course, will keep spending on gaining global market share 
as long as it can keep raising money. For now, that is not a problem. But eventually even 
Uber may have to retrench.

Summary
Network externalities, also known as network effects or demand-side economies 
of scale, characterise products or services where the value to any user increases in 
proportion to the total number of users. Direct network externalities are common 
in communications markets, where the value to any user comes from the ability 
to communicate with other users via a network. Indirect network externalities 
are common in hardware–software markets, where an increase in the number 
of users of the hardware product stimulates the production of complementary 
software products, and the increased availability of software increases the value 
to each user of the hardware.

|	 22    ■    Network goods and services
Different specifications for the demand function for a network product or ser-
vice rely on different assumptions concerning the utility functions of individual 
users. In one of the cases examined in this chapter, it is assumed that the network 
benefit is heterogeneous (differs between users) and the stand-alone benefit is 
homogeneous (the same for all users). In another case it is assumed that the 
stand-alone benefit is heterogeneous and the network benefit is homogeneous.
■ In the case of heterogeneous network benefits, the dependence of quantity 
demanded on users’ expectations of the total size of the network makes multi-
ple solutions for quantity demanded feasible for some prices. The more extreme 
price–quantity combinations, characterised by either a zero rate or a high rate 
of adoption, tend to be more stable than the intermediate combination char-
acterised by a low but non-zero rate of adoption.
■ In the case of heterogeneous stand-alone benefits, the relationship between 
price and quantity demanded has a regular downward-sloping appearance in 
the case where the stand-alone benefit dominates the network benefit. This 
relationship may be upward-sloping, however, for certain prices in the case 
where the network benefit dominates the stand-alone benefit. In the latter case 
again, multiple solutions for quantity demanded are feasible for some prices.
Analysis of the profit-maximizing market equilibrium under alternative 
supply conditions of perfect competition and monopoly leads to the following 
conclusions. If marginal cost is sufficiently low, both perfect competition and 
monopoly lead to full market coverage. For intermediate values of marginal 
cost, monopoly leads to lower coverage than perfect competition. In all of these 
cases, the monopoly price exceeds the perfectly competitive price. For a limit-
ing value of marginal cost, above which the market is not supplied, perfect 
competition and monopoly lead to identical coverage and identical prices. The 
standard welfare conclusion, that monopoly is welfare-reducing in comparison 
with perfect competition, is maintained; but there are cases for which neither 
perfect competition nor monopoly achieves the welfare-maximizing provision 
of the network good or service.
In a duopoly model that allows for different levels of compatibility between 
the products or services of two competing suppliers, the properties of a Cournot–
Nash equilibrium shed light on the nature of competition between suppliers 
offering alternative networks. Through a demand-expansion effect, an increase 
in compatibility increases total output, and is welfare-enhancing. Through a 
­quality-differentiation effect, however, increased compatibility is less attrac-
tive for a dominant supplier with the larger installed base than it is for a small 
supplier. When side-payments are feasible, the likelihood of achieving perfect 
compatibility is greater than it is when there are no side-payments. Even when 
side-payments are feasible, however, profit-maximizing suppliers might fail to 
achieve the welfare-maximizing outcome of perfect compatibility, because the 
private incentives might not be sufficiently aligned with the social incentives.
The degree of compatibility between competing technological standards is 
typically the outcome of strategic decisions taken by the suppliers. Forms of com-
petition that could emerge from a situation in which suppliers have ‘ownership’

of separate technologies that are candidates to become the industry standard 
include: inter-technology competition, in the case where incompatibility is pre-
ferred by both suppliers; intra-technology competition, in the case where compat-
ibility is preferred by both suppliers; and a hybrid case in which one (dominant) 
supplier prefers inter-technology competition while the other (smaller) supplier 
prefers intra-technology competition. In the latter case the outcome may depend 
on the ease with which the dominant supplier, which prefers incompatibility, can 
prevent imitation of its technology by the smaller supplier.

Introduction
A diversified firm is involved in the production of a number of different goods 
and services. In other words, a diversified firm is a multi-product firm. Large 
diversified firms which operate in many sectors of the economy are often 
referred to as conglomerates. Examples are Unilever, which produces a large 
array of packaged food and personal care products; BAA, which is involved in 
airport management services, building projects, railways, property management

and consultancy services; and ABB, which is involved in various power and 
automotive technologies as well as oil, gas and petroleum. Large diversified 
firms account for a significant proportion of the total economic activity in most 
developed economies. Naturally, this raises questions concerning the implica-
tions of diversification for competition and performance. Chapter 23 addresses 
these issues.
Section 23.2 identifies three principal types of diversification: first, diversifica-
tion by product extension, where a firm supplies a new product that is closely 
related to its existing products; second, diversification by market extension, 
where a firm moves into a new geographic market; and, third, pure diversifica-
tion, where a firm moves into a completely unrelated field of activity. There 
are two ways in which a diversification strategy might be implemented: either 
through internally generated expansion, or through merger and acquisition. 
­Section 23.3 examines the theories that have been developed to explain why a 
firm might decide to pursue a diversification strategy. These are considered under 
four broad headings: enhancement of market power; realization of cost savings; 
reduction of transaction costs; and managerial motives for diversification.
Typically, the direction of diversification is not determined randomly; instead, 
the products of most conglomerates tend to be related. Nevertheless, during 
the 1980s and 1990s there appears to have been a shift of emphasis away from 
diversification, and in some cases towards the divestment of unrelated activities 
in pursuit of increased corporate focus. Section 23.4 considers reasons why some 
conglomerates have been subject to a strategy of divestment or deconglomeration.
Section 23.5 discusses the empirical evidence on the extent and direction of 
diversification among UK and European conglomerates. In general the empirical 
evidence seems to suggest most conglomerates are rather cautious in their diver-
sification strategies, preferring in most cases to diversify in a manner that leaves 
them operating relatively close to their current technological and market bases. 
Finally, Section 23.6 examines investment by multinational enterprises (MNEs) 
in foreign countries. Foreign direct investment (FDI) may be viewed as a form of 
diversification, whether vertical, horizontal or conglomerate, into international 
markets which offer strategic opportunities but also pose new challenges. The 
interaction of MNEs with the host country’s firms and institutions is considered, 
together with the factors that influence the returns from FDI.
	
23.2	
Types of diversification
As shown earlier (see Section 10.2), the definition of a market contains both 
a product dimension and a geographic dimension. The product market defi-
nition includes all products that are close substitutes for one another, either 
in consumption or in production. The geographic market definition involves 
determining whether an increase in the price of a product in one geographic loca-
tion significantly affects either the demand or supply, and therefore the price, in 
another location. If so, both locations form part of the same geographic market. 
Based on this definition of markets, the US Federal Trade Commission’s annual

Statistical Report on Mergers and Acquisitions suggests a convenient three-part 
classification of types of diversification:
■ Product extension. A firm can diversify by supplying a new product that is 
closely related to its existing products. A sweet manufacturer that sells a milk 
chocolate bar may decide to produce and sell a dark chocolate bar as a prod-
uct extension. Diversification by product extension could also include a move 
slightly further afield; for example, a chocolate bar producer might decide to 
supply closely related products such as ice cream or snack foods. Diversifica-
tion by product extension should not be viewed as a discrete series of easily 
identifiable steps, but rather as part of a continuous process. Since almost all 
firms produce more than one product line or offer more than one service, all 
firms are to some extent diversified.
■ Market extension. Diversification by market extension involves moving into a 
new geographic market. For example, the sweet manufacturer that produces 
chocolate bars for the UK market might decide to venture further afield by 
marketing the same chocolate bars elsewhere in the EU.
■ Pure diversification. A pure diversification strategy involves movement into 
unrelated fields of business activity. Firms that supply unrelated products 
to unrelated markets are known as conglomerates. The UK conglomerate 
Virgin plc is a well-known example of a firm that has grown mainly through 
a strategy of pure diversification. Virgin began in the early 1970s as a music 
store, before diversifying into numerous other fields including airlines, train 
services, financial products, soft drinks, mobile telephones, holidays, cars, 
wines, publishing and bridal wear. Diversification by product extension or 
market extension refers to a strategy based on core product specialization. 
Conglomerates or purely diversified firms do not specialise in this way. Pure 
diversification is a relatively unusual strategy. Most firms tend to diversify 
by entering adjacent markets, rather than totally unrelated ones. Sometimes 
it might appear that a firm is involved in pure diversification, but on closer 
examination there is a logical explanation as to why a particular direction 
has been chosen. For example, in 1982, Mars UK, the confectionery firm, 
developed marine radar, aimed at the small boat market. At first glance, this 
appears to be a case of pure diversification. However, Mars Electronics had 
developed a successful electronics business on the basis of technical expertise 
accumulated through its vending machine operations. Having spotted a gap 
in the market for a cheap and reliable radar system, the company diversified 
into this niche market.
There are two ways in which a diversification strategy can be implemented: 
first, through internally generated expansion; and, second, through merger and 
acquisition. Conglomerate merger involves the integration of firms that oper-
ate in different product markets, or in the same product market but in differ-
ent geographic markets. Internally generated expansion is likely to require the 
simultaneous extension of the firm’s plant and equipment, workforce and skills 
base, supplies of raw materials, and the technical and managerial expertise of its 
staff. A strategy of diversification through conglomerate merger may be a lot less 

678	
|	 23    ■    Diversification
demanding in this respect. Another important distinction is that diversification 
through internal expansion is likely to result in an increase in the total productive 
capacity in the industry concerned, while diversification through conglomerate 
merger involves only a transfer of ownership and control over existing productive 
capacity. The main requirements for the latter strategy are an ability to select 
an appropriate target firm; access to the financial resources required to secure 
a controlling interest in the target firm; and an ability to manage the integrated 
organization effectively after the merger has taken place.
De Jong (1993) suggests the choice of diversification strategy might depend 
on the stage reached in the industry life cycle (see Section 11.2). Firms operating 
in newer industries where rivalry is low are likely to face plentiful opportunities 
to extend their product lines as their markets expand. Firms operating in mature 
industries are likely to find their opportunities for new product developments 
constrained by slow growth in market demand and more intense rivalry. Diver-
sification through conglomerate merger rather than through internally generated 
expansion may be a more attractive strategy, especially since, as noted above, it 
avoids increasing the industry’s total productive capacity. During the late 1940s, 
1950s and 1960s, when most European economies were still undergoing recon-
struction following the Second World War, diversification in Europe was typically 
implemented through internally generated expansion, while diversification by 
conglomerate merger was more common in the US (Chandler, 1990; Jacobson and 
Andréosso-O’Callaghan, 1996). During the post-war reconstruction phase, most 
European industries were at an earlier stage of their life cycles than the equivalent 
US industries. Furthermore, Chandler (1990) suggests the ability of European 
firms to finance conglomerate mergers was constrained by the small size and lack 
of flexibility of European capital markets relative to their US counterparts.
	
23.3	
Motives for diversification
This section examines a number of theories that have been developed to explain 
why a firm might decide to pursue a strategy of diversification. The discussion 
begins by examining motives related to the enhancement of the firm’s market 
power, and motives related to the potential for cost savings. Theories of diver-
sification based on some of the alternative theories of the firm introduced in 
Chapter 4 are also examined.
Enhancement of market power
The diversified firm which operates in a number of separate geographic and 
product markets may enjoy a competitive advantage over a specialised firm, 
because it can draw on resources from its full range of operations in order to 
fight rivals in specific markets. Furthermore, a firm that already has significant 
market power in one market might be reluctant to expand further within the 
same market, for fear of alerting the competition authorities. A superior and less 
confrontational strategy might be to move into other related or unrelated mar-
kets. There are several specific anticompetitive consequences of diversification.

	
	
	
23.3  Motives for diversification	 |	
679
Cross-subsidization and predatory competition
Through a policy of cross-subsidization, the diversified firm may be in a strong 
position to compete against a specialised rival in the rival’s own market, draw-
ing on cash flows or profits earned elsewhere within the organization to cover 
the costs of engaging the rival in either price or non-price forms of predatory 
competition (Aron, 1993; Myers, 1994). Predatory competition involves divert-
ing resources from one operation in order to fight elsewhere. Under a predatory 
pricing strategy, for example, the diversified firm might undercut the specialised 
firm’s price in an attempt to force it out of the market (see also Section 12.3). 
Once the rival has withdrawn, the price is reset to the original level or a higher 
level. In order for this strategy to succeed, the predator must have a deeper 
pocket than its rival (OECD, 1989; Scherer and Ross, 1990). A predatory pricing 
strategy is only likely to be profitable if there are barriers to entry. Otherwise the 
sacrifice of profit in the short run may be in vain. ‘Predatory competition is an 
expensive pastime, undertaken only if monopoly and its fruits can be obtained 
and held’ (Adelman, 1959, p. 369). However, by signalling commitment, the 
predator may develop a reputation as a willing fighter, which itself serves as an 
entry barrier (Milgrom and Roberts, 1982; Chen, 1997).
There may be limits to the usefulness of a predatory competition strategy 
for a diversified firm. The specialised rival might turn out to be a more effec-
tive fighter, as it would be fighting for its very survival. For any firm wishing 
to eliminate rivalry, there may be alternative, less costly strategies than preda-
tory competition, such as collusion or acquisition (McGee, 1958; Telser, 1966a). 
Although the diversified firm might have the capability to carry out a preda-
tory competition strategy, it might refrain from doing so if this places its other 
operations at risk. For example, one of Rockefeller’s associates remarked that 
Standard Oil ‘gained or lost on a titan’s scale while our opponents did so on a 
pygmy’s’ (Nevins, 1953, p. 65).
Gabrielsen (2003) suggests the takeover of an independent firm might be a 
disguised vertical merger, rather than a strategy for diversification. A firm tar-
gets the independent firm for its distribution network, which might otherwise be 
used by potential entrants, for whom the development of a distribution network 
would be costly, time-consuming and risky. Acquiring a firm with a distribution 
network already in place might be a cost-effective means of achieving entry. 
Therefore, by acquiring the firm with the distribution network, the incumbent 
achieves market power through effective foreclosure on the potential entrant. 
Although the same result could be achieved by simply acquiring the entrant, 
antitrust authorities typically view horizontal mergers with greater scepticism 
than mergers that only have implications for vertical relations.
Reciprocity and tying
Reciprocity involves an agreement that firm A purchases inputs from firm B, 
on condition that firm B also purchases inputs from firm A. In other words, 
reciprocity is ‘the practice of basing purchases upon the recognition of sales to 
the other party, rather than on the basis of prices and product quality’ (Weston, 

680	
|	 23    ■    Diversification
1970, p. 314). It can be argued that, in effect, all economic transactions involve an 
element of reciprocity; and, in the extreme case of barter, transactions are based 
solely on reciprocal arrangements. Reciprocity becomes anticompetitive if one 
of the parties is forced to take part in a reciprocal transaction in which it would 
not participate voluntarily.
A specialised firm has only a limited range of input demands, whereas a diver-
sified firm has a much wider spread of purchasing requirements. Therefore, the 
diversified firm is in a stronger position. The US Federal Trade Commission 
argues that reciprocal trade increases existing entry barriers or creates new barri-
ers if entrants are effectively excluded as a result of reciprocal trade arrangements 
(Utton, 1979). For example, Wall Street and Technology (2006) reports that 
the investment bank Morgan Stanley encouraged its IT department to purchase 
technology inputs from a subsidiary of a major client. Much of the evidence on 
reciprocity draws on anecdotal evidence based on cases that were brought before 
the courts. Needham (1978) argues that reciprocity is just one method by which 
a firm can exploit its existing market power, rather than a strategy for extending 
market power. Consequently, the practice itself should not be viewed as particu-
larly damaging to competition.
Tying involves the linked selling of two distinct products, in order to purchase 
good X the buyer must also purchase good Y (see also Section 21.3). This prac-
tice may be an attractive strategy for a diversified firm that is seeking to generate 
sales across a number of distinct product lines.
Cost savings
In theory, a diversification strategy can result in cost savings in three ways: first, 
through the realization of economies of scope; second, by reducing risk and 
uncertainty; and, third, by reducing the firm’s tax exposure.
Economies of scope
As shown earlier (see Section 2.2), economies of scale are realised when the firm 
reduces its long-run average cost by increasing its scale of production, while 
economies of scope are realised when long-run average cost savings are achieved 
by spreading costs over the production of several goods or services. Douma and 
Schreuder (1998) quote a farming example. A fruit-grower must leave enough 
space between the trees to allow access for labour and farm equipment. This 
land can be used to graze sheep. The farmer uses one input, land, to produce 
two products, fruit and wool. However, the availability of cost savings through 
economies of scope does not necessarily imply the fruit-grower must diversify 
into sheep farming. Instead the land could be rented to a sheep farmer. This 
market transaction delivers the same outcome as the diversification strategy. 
However, if the market transaction costs are too high, diversification might be 
the more cost-effective approach.
Needham (1978) expresses scepticism as to the importance of economies of 
scope as a motivating factor for a diversification strategy. First, if economies 
of scope are achieved by spreading the costs of indivisible inputs over a wider 

	
	
	
23.3  Motives for diversification	 |	
681
range of outputs, the specialised firm could realise similar cost savings through 
economies of scale by increasing its scale of production. Second, the inputs 
must be non-specific and capable of being spread over different activities. This 
requirement might only be satisfied by certain inputs, such as the marketing or 
finance functions.
Reduction of risk and uncertainty
All firms are vulnerable to adverse fluctuations in demand, and increased compe-
tition in their product markets. The more products a firm develops, the lower is 
this vulnerability. According to Penrose (1995), the unpredictability of demand 
creates uncertainty, which in turn might motivate a diversification strategy:
Except for seasonal variations, it is rarely possible accurately to predict 
fluctuations in demand. The less accurate the firm feels its predictions 
are, the more uncertain are profit expectations; consequently the firm 
will give more weight to the possibilities of obtaining a more complete 
utilization of its resources and a more stable income stream and less 
weight to the possible restriction on its ability to meet fully the peak 
demand for its existing product.
(Penrose, 1995, p. 140)
A diversification strategy can help smooth out seasonal fluctuations in cash 
flows, if the firm is able to establish a presence in markets with different sea-
sonal peaks. Examples of offsetting activities include Walls’ ice cream and meat 
products; Valor Gas’s heating and gardening equipment product ranges; and the 
newsagent WHSmith’s involvement in travel agency services.
The ability to manage risk through diversification may help the firm to raise 
finance at a lower cost. From the point of view of the lender, however, it is not 
immediately obvious why a diversified firm should receive more advantageous 
terms than a specialised firm. A lender can manage his or her own risk by spread-
ing a diversified portfolio of investments across a number of specialised firms. 
It could be argued that for a small investor, in particular, holding shares in one 
diversified firm might be more attractive than holding a diversified portfolio of 
investments in many firms. For the small investor, the transaction costs incurred 
in making multiple investments and the cost of monitoring their performance 
might be onerous. However, vehicles such as unit trusts exist to channel funds 
from small-scale investors into managed diversified portfolios, reducing their 
investors’ exposure to risk.
Obi (2003) examines whether the diversification of US bank holding companies 
into non-bank activities reduced the amount of unsystematic risk. Unsystematic 
risk is specific to the individual firm. This is in contrast to systematic or market 
risk, which affects all firms equally and cannot be managed through a strategy of 
diversification. Fifty financial institutions that moved from traditional banking 
business into areas such as life insurance, share dealing and real estate, between 
1984 and 1995, are examined. The results suggest unsystematic risk was reduced 

682	
|	 23    ■    Diversification
through diversification, although market risk appears to have increased over the 
same period. Stiroh (2009) suggests that in recent years banks have refocused 
away from volatile capital market business back toward more stable retail bank-
ing business.
Reduction of tax exposure
Under some taxation regimes, diversification can enable a firm to reduce its 
tax liability. Profits in one activity can be offset against losses in another. A 
specialised firm which makes a loss pays no tax on profit, but the tax payable by 
other profitable specialised firms is not reduced. A diversified firm might make 
greater use of debt rather than equity finance. If interest payments on loans are 
tax deductible, the overall effect might be a reduction in the firm’s taxable profit 
(Needham, 1978). These arguments were tested by Berger and Ofek (1995), who 
express scepticism as to whether such factors are significant in most diversifica-
tion or divestment decisions:
Two potential benefits of diversification are increased interest tax shields 
resulting from higher debt capacity and the ability of multi-segment firms 
to immediately realize tax savings by offsetting losses in some segments 
against profits in others. Our estimate of tax saving, however, is only 0.1 
per cent of sales, far too small to offset the documented value loss.
(Berger and Ofek, 1995, p. 60)
Diversification as a means of reducing transaction costs
Motives for diversification or conglomerate merger can also be identified using 
the transaction costs approach. Next, these are considered under three headings: 
the conglomerate as an internal capital market, the conglomerate as a vehicle for 
the exploitation of specific assets, and the ability of a conglomerate to deliver 
services.
The conglomerate as an internal capital market
In theory, the financial or capital markets should always reward efficient manage-
ment by increasing the market value of the firm. In practice, however, investors 
may be unable to access accurate information in order to judge the performance 
of management, especially since managers are likely to exercise influence or con-
trol over the flow of information. It would require a great deal of altruism for 
managers to pass on information which might reflect badly on their own perfor-
mance. Information impactedness (Williamson, 1971) creates a transaction cost 
that frustrates the efficient allocation of investment funds.
With an M-form corporate structure (Williamson, 1975), the headquarters of 
the conglomerate performs the task of allocating funds for investment between 
a number of divisions (see Section 5.3). The managers of the divisions have 
autonomy in their day-to-day decision-making. In this coordinating role, the

M-form headquarters has two advantages over the capital market. First, the 
divisional managers are subordinates to the senior managers, and can be ordered 
to provide reliable information. An implicit disciplinary threat can be used to 
encourage compliance (Harris and Raviv, 1996). It might be easier for divi-
sional managers to share confidential information with senior managers than 
with external investors. Second, the headquarters can conduct internal audits to 
guard against mismanagement at divisional level. Effectively, the conglomerate 
acts as a miniature capital market, but enjoys better access to information and 
is able to monitor performance at divisional level more effectively. Of course, 
as the conglomerate grows larger, limits may be reached to the ability of the 
senior managers to monitor and coordinate effectively. There is also an oppos-
ing view, that the managers of a large diversified conglomerate might perform 
the task of allocating funds less efficiently than the capital markets. The man-
agers might be excessively willing to prop up ailing divisions at the expense of 
the profitable ones. Divisions within a conglomerate bargain for funds and the 
bargaining power of a division might be enhanced by investments that do not 
benefit the organization as a whole. The head office might buy the cooperation 
of divisions by diverting investment funds in their direction (Berger and Ofek, 
1995; Scharfstein, 1998; Berlin, 1999).
Van Oijen and Douma (2000) elaborate on the factors that determine whether 
or not central management can exercise effective control over the divisions of a 
large, diversified conglomerate. Diversification eventually presents a challenge 
to the control exercised by central management in the following areas:
■ Planning. A corporate strategy identifies the portfolio of industries and geo-
graphic markets in which the firm will be involved. This is distinct from a 
business strategy, which concerns individual divisions in different industries 
and countries. The centre is responsible for corporate strategy, but the extent 
of its involvement in business strategy depends on the level of diversification. 
The greater the participation of the centre in business strategy, the greater the 
likelihood that decisions benefit the corporation, rather than the individual 
division. If the divisions are to benefit from synergies in marketing and distri-
bution, some central coordination is required. Central coordination is easier 
to achieve if the level of diversification is relatively low.
■ Evaluation. The centre allocates funds to the individual divisions and must 
monitor the subsequent use of funds. Traditional accounting rates of return 
may be too crude to measure the true contribution of individual divisions to 
the corporation as a whole. For example, division A may be instructed to 
send resources to division B, but if this were likely to compromise division A’s 
financial performance, A’s cooperation might not be forthcoming. A more 
sophisticated method of evaluation may be required, recognizing each divi-
sion’s total contribution to the corporation’s performance.
■ Selection. This reflects the ability of the corporation to select managers who 
are sympathetic to its strategies, ideals and culture. Effective selection is easiest 
when the level of diversification is relatively low and the centre is informed of 
the specific needs of individual divisions.

|	 23    ■    Diversification
■ Rotation. The rotation of resources, especially management, helps spread best 
practice and develops networks. Rotation encompassing all aspects of the 
corporation’s activities is more difficult in large diversified conglomerates.
■ Motivation. In large conglomerates, financial criteria tend to determine incen-
tives, since the centre may be unable to access other information. In less diver-
sified corporations, it may be easier to develop incentive structures based not 
only on financial criteria, but also on strategic criteria reflecting the perfor-
mance of the entire organization.
■ Coordination. Coordination of joint activities among divisions tends to be eas-
ier in less diversified corporations. In highly diversified conglomerates, central 
coordination may be impeded if it is seen as damaging to the interests of the 
individual division and consequently resisted by its management.
■ Support. Functions such as human resources, research and development, and 
legal services can be organised centrally, but the level of diversification is likely 
to influence the extent of central provision. There is less scope for central 
provision in a corporation with a diversified range of activities.
Summarizing these arguments, Van Oijen and Douma anticipate that, as the level 
of diversification increases, the centre: becomes less involved in planning busi-
ness strategies and in the day-to-day management of the divisions; relies more 
on financial criteria when evaluating performance; becomes less involved in the 
selection of staff; reduces the level of staff rotation; tends to rely increasingly on 
financial incentives; and offers fewer centralised services.
Doukas and Kan (2008) report that diversified firms that generate higher 
returns from their non-core business than from their core business tend to favour 
diversifying mergers, while those that generate lower returns from their non-core 
activities tend to favour non-diversifying mergers. Accordingly, it appears that 
the profitability of the core business of the conglomerate plays an important role 
in the decision to diversify. A conglomerate that reallocates capital from a less 
profitable core activity to a more profitable non-core activity contributes to an 
improvement in the efficiency of capital allocation.
The conglomerate as a vehicle for the exploitation of specific assets
Penrose (1995) suggests firms’ opportunities for growth derive from their pos-
session of resources and assets that can be exploited in other markets. If these 
resources could be sold to other firms through the market, the rationale for diver-
sification would disappear. Specific assets include new technologies, trade secrets, 
brand loyalty, managerial experience and expertise (Gorecki, 1975; ­Sutton, 1980; 
Teece, 1982; Markides and Williamson, 1994). In the management science lit-
erature, assets of this kind are termed core competences by Prahalad and Hamel 
(1990) and core capabilities by Stalk et al. (1992). In order to capitalise on its 
specific assets, the firm can either sell the assets in the market, or diversify into 
the relevant industry and exploit the asset itself. The decision whether to sell or 
diversify depends on the presence of market imperfections which increase the 
transaction costs incurred by selling the assets in the market.

	
	
	
23.3  Motives for diversification	 |	
685
■ A market may not exist because the property rights in the asset cannot be 
protected. Basic knowledge which is non-patentable is an example of a specific 
asset of this kind.
■ It may be too difficult to transfer a specific asset independently of its owner. 
A team of managers or a group of skilled workers may be uniquely loyal to 
an owner and unwilling to transfer to another organization.
■ The transaction costs of transferring the asset may be too high. For example, 
if the technology is complex, it might not be possible to find a buyer with the 
skills and facilities needed to exploit the asset. It might be necessary to transfer 
not only the blueprints and recipes for a new product or process, but also skills 
that are learnt through experience. This would require the training of staff in 
the buying firm, whose technical background may be unsuitable.
■ Market transactions may be subject to externalities. For example, if B pur-
chases A’s brand or trademark, but B is unable to maintain A’s standards of 
service, A’s reputation and profitability may suffer. Negotiations between a 
seller and a buyer may reveal production methods and strategies sufficient for 
the buyer to contemplate entry into the seller’s industry, even if the sale and 
purchase are not completed. To guard against externalities or spillovers of 
these kinds, strict and complex contractual relations, perhaps involving high 
monitoring and policing costs, would be required.
In view of these market imperfections and the associated transaction costs, firms 
might find it more beneficial to diversify than to trade their specific assets in the 
market. For example, Gillette’s acquisition of the battery manufacturer Duracell 
in 1996 can be interpreted in terms of the exploitation of specific assets. At first 
glance there appears to be no obvious potential for economies of scope. Capital 
equipment and technology are very different for the two products. Douma and 
Schreuder (1998) suggest Gillette wished to exploit its marketing and sales opera-
tions in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and India by selling batteries as 
well as razors.
Montgomery and Wernerfelt (1988) see diversification as a means for extract-
ing rents in related activities. Rents are the returns or rewards to owners of unique 
factors. Potential diversifiers have excess capacity in their factor inputs, which can 
be exploited beyond their current use. As a firm diversifies it transfers this excess 
capacity to the adjacent market which yields the highest rents. Should any spare 
capacity remain, the firm diversifies into markets further afield, until the marginal 
rents disappear. Davis and Devinney (1997) suggest three ways in which the desire 
to make better use of specific assets might propel firms towards diversification. 
First, supply conditions relate to the potential for economies of scale and scope, 
created by the possibility of spreading the costs of production, marketing and 
distribution over a greater number of activities. Second, synergies are created by 
various customer switching costs. For example, if a firm has built up brand loyalty, 
and consumers perceive the brand as representing high quality, then this percep-
tion can be exploited in other markets. Third, and perhaps most importantly, is the 
exploitation of managerial skills, such as technical expertise, the ability to marshal 
skilled labour and knowledge of the workings of supply industries.

The delivery of services
The role of diversification as a means for eliminating transaction costs may 
be applicable to the delivery of services. Unlike physical products, services 
are intangible and therefore have the characteristics of experience goods (see 
­Section 17.3). Furthermore, services involve interactions between customers and 
suppliers. These characteristics create difficulties for customers in comparing the 
services offered by different suppliers, which give rise to switching costs. Diversi-
fied organizations, which supply both goods and services, may therefore have 
an advantage over specialised suppliers of goods only. Based on an analysis of 
US data for the period 1998–2000, Skaggs and Droege (2004) report that manu-
facturers that had diversified into services performed better, with less risk, than 
specialised manufacturers.
Managerial motives for diversification
As shown earlier (see Section 4.3), an important characteristic of the large cor-
poration is the separation of ownership from control. According to Marris’s 
(1964) managerial theory of the firm, diversification is the principal method by 
which growth in demand is achieved in the long run. Similarly, Mueller (1969) 
suggests conglomerate merger is a strategy that may be pursued by managers 
more concerned with the maximization of growth than with the maximization 
of shareholder value. If the regulatory authorities make it difficult for firms to 
expand horizontally or vertically, conglomerate merger may represent the best 
available alternative strategy.
There may be several reasons why the managers (the agents) might wish to 
pursue growth at a faster rate than would be chosen by the owners or share-
holders (the principals). First, the managers’ power, status and remuneration 
might be related to the growth of the organization. Second, diversification 
into new activities might complement the talents and skills of the manag-
ers, increasing their value to the organization. Third, unlike shareholders, 
who are able to reduce risk by diversifying their portfolios, the managers’ job 
security depends on the fortunes of the firm. Diversification might provide a 
means of reducing the risk of failure facing the firm and its managers. Income 
from employment represents a large proportion of the managers’ remunera-
tion, and this income is correlated with the firm’s performance. The risks to 
the managers’ income are closely related to the risks facing the firm. Since 
their employment risk cannot easily be reduced by diversifying their personal 
portfolios, managers diversify their employment risk by supporting strate-
gies of diversification or conglomerate merger. Amihud and Lev (1981) find 
manager-controlled firms are more likely to pursue conglomerate merger than 
owner-controlled firms.
Any firm that wishes to grow within its existing markets is eventually likely 
to find these markets incapable of expanding sufficiently quickly. Investment 
opportunities in new markets may offer better prospects than those in existing 
markets. These opportunities may reflect not just changes in prices, tastes and 
other market conditions, but also the development of skills and knowledge within

the firm (Penrose, 1995). Furthermore, the firm might find expansion within its 
existing markets triggers increasing rivalry from its competitors.
In a survey of US firms, Rose and Shepard (1997) find managers’ salaries 
were 13 per cent higher in diversified firms than those in similar specialised firms. 
However, some caution is required in interpreting this finding. Perhaps diversi-
fied firms are more complex to manage and require managers with more ability. 
Incumbent managers who pursue diversification strategies are not necessarily 
rewarded with higher salaries; instead, newly appointed managers of diversified 
firms might be paid more than managers of specialised firms because the job is 
more demanding.
Case study 23.1
Japan Tobacco: get off the drugs
FT
Japan Tobacco is something of a misnomer. It derives the majority of its revenues out-
side Japan. It has employees in at least 70 countries and sells its brands in 120. It is also 
unlike many Japanese companies in its high profitability: return on equity is in the mid 
to high-teens.
The tobacco part is mostly accurate, though. Nine-tenths of JT sales come from 
smoking-related products. It owns brands such as Silk Cut and Benson & Hedges. The 
company has done a good job in a challenging environment, bolstering market share 
with acquisitions and investment in its brands. It has hedged against declining cigarette 
revenues by buying into ecigarettes and water pipes. This has paid off. Late on Tuesday, 
it announced solid third-quarter results and lifted its full-year forecasts a smidgen. It also 
raised its full-year dividend forecast by nearly a tenth. The market was well pleased: the 
stock closed up 7 per cent on Wednesday.
The other 10 per cent of JT’s revenues come from processed food and pharmaceuticals. 
The food division has, over the past decade, contributed 3 per cent (at best) to earnings 
before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. JT may yet have plans to jet-
tison it, having already sold its beverages division to Suntory. That would leave the drug 
business, operated through majority-owned Torii Pharmaceutical. It contributes a mere 
3 per cent of the group’s sales and has made losses for nearly a decade. It is sub-scale; 
Japanese market leader Takeda Pharmaceutical has a research and development budget 
about 13 times as large as JT’s subsidiary.
Yet JT appears curiously wedded to the drug business. That might appear of little 
consequence now; annual R&D costs of $241m are dwarfed by group ebitda of $5.5bn. 
But if the business is ever to become significant, R&D will have to grow. JT executes 
well in its core business. It should quit food and drugs, and leave diversification to its 
shareholders.

Case study 23.2
LVMH: luxe redux
FT
Wealthy drinkers in China are sipping cognac again. Sales of LVMH’s more ostenta-
tious cognac brand were revived after a dry spell because of a crackdown on conspicuous 
quaffing. Better sales are one reason that French luxury goods group LVMH was able 
to report 3 per cent revenue growth in the first half of the year — but not the main rea-
son. The early noughties growth bonanza in China may not be repeatable, given that its 
drinkers are catching up from a rather sober period in the first half of 2015. LVMH’s US 
businesses, however, deserve closer attention. True, the standout growth in the US may 
be a reflection of weakness elsewhere. But the recently announced sale of the US brand 
Donna Karan suggests that management is admirably focused on getting more from its 
brand portfolio, rather than simply riding the coattails of economic recovery (and the 
strong dollar). The sale is an unusual step for a group that had been known more for 
opportunism in acquisitions than disposals.
Even after the DK sale, LVMH remains widely and deliberately diversified across 
regions and business segments. It argues that it allows its highly mobile clients to satisfy 
their desire for a bit of self-indulgent spending everywhere on the globe. Diversifica-
tion adds stability, but it also means that finite resources cannot be invested into the 
most profitable business all the time. That may be why shares in more highly focused 
competitors like Salvatore Ferragamo or Richemont have underperformed LVMH last 
year — though beat it over a five-year horizon. Like all luxury goods groups, LVMH is 
exposed to significant currency risk; currency losses had the effect of lowering year-over-
year revenue growth by 2 per cent in the first half, and recent stock performance is highly 
correlated to the euro on a trade weighted basis. LVMH actively manages those risks 
arising from foreign exchange movements. Like its diverse portfolio, this may ultimately 
boost returns — but investors should note the potential for greater revenue volatility in 
the meantime.

Corporate focus and deconglomeration
In the management science literature, the term corporate focus refers to the extent 
to which a firm specialises in its core activity. In a study of 33 large US firms 
over the period 1950–86, Porter (1987) notes most had divested more acquisitions 
than they had retained; in other words, most had become increasingly focused. 
Similar conclusions are drawn by Scharfstein (1998), who analyses a US sample 
of 165 conglomerates that were diversified into at least one other unrelated activ-
ity in 1979. By 1994, 55 of these firms had become focused on their core activity; 

	
	
	
23.4  Corporate focus and deconglomeration	 |	
689
57 firms that had not become more focused had been acquired by other firms; 
and only 53 firms still existed as conglomerates in 1994.
Why did many large conglomerates tend to divest activities during the 1980s 
and 1990s? The fundamental reason is that, in many cases, firms that had become 
increasingly diversified also became less profitable. Conversely, average profit-
ability often tended to increase among firms that became more focused. There 
is some evidence of a tendency for the stock market prices of parent firms that 
divested some activities to have risen (Daley et al., 1997). Furthermore, this ten-
dency was more pronounced for firms that sold unrelated activities than for firms 
that sold related activities. In a study of 1,449 US firms in the 1980s, Lang and 
Stulz (1994) find Tobin’s q (the ratio of the market value of a firm to its replace-
ment cost of assets) was greater for specialised firms than for diversified firms.
If the share prices of diversified firms are consistently lower than those of 
specialised firms (relative to the underlying value of assets), it appears that 
shareholders tend to penalise diversified firms. This might suggest that unrelated 
diversification is a strategy intended to benefit managers and not shareholders. 
Analysing the profitability of the parent firms that divested themselves of their 
acquisitions, as well as the units that were divested, Daley et al. (1997) find that 
profitability increased for both types of organization. This appears to justify the 
observed tendency for capital markets to be optimistic about firms that have 
become more focused.
The issue of focus is approached from a different angle in Siggelkow’s (2003) 
study of US mutual fund providers. Some providers offer a broad range of funds, 
including specialised equity, bond and index funds; while others focus on a nar-
rower range of funds. Using data for the period 1985–96, Siggelkow finds the 
mutual funds of focused providers outperformed those of diversified providers. 
Similar findings are reported by Ravenscraft and Scherer (1987), Kaplan and 
Weisbach (1992), Comment and Jarrell (1995) and Haynes et al. (2002). Martin 
and Sayrak (2003) survey the literature on diversification and shareholder value.
Berger and Ofek (1995) test for the existence of a diversification discount, mea-
sured by comparing the performance of individual divisions of a conglomerate 
with that of specialised firms in the same industry. The diversification discount is 
the difference between the sum of the hypothetical stand-alone market values of 
each constituent division of the conglomerate and the actual market value. The 
stand-alone values exceeded the market values by about 15 per cent on average.
Agreement on the existence and magnitude of the diversification discount is 
not universal. Hyland (2003) tests the hypothesis that a diversification discount 
may already exist before a firm decides to diversify. A firm that diversifies may 
have a relatively low value of Tobin’s q for reasons other than diversification, 
such as inferior management. Accordingly, Hyland examines the diversifica-
tion discount over the three years before and the three years after the diver-
sification decision. On average, Tobin’s q tends to fall in the first year after 
diversification, but the value for the subsequent two years is not lower than 
that for the preceding three years. In an international study, Lins and Servaes 
(1999) find evidence of a diversification discount for Japan and the UK but not 
for Germany. It is suggested the different results might reflect different levels of 
concentration of ownership.

690	
|	 23    ■    Diversification
Nevertheless, the consensus seems to be that a diversification discount does 
exist and, if the discount is as large as some studies suggest, it is perhaps unsur-
prising that shareholders have encouraged managers to implement strategies of 
divestment or deconglomeration. Haynes et al. (2002) suggest the following rea-
sons for improved performance following divestment from diversified activities. 
First, the diversified firm may be overstretched in so far as its organizational 
structure is unable to cope with the complex demands of its divisions. Second, if 
diversification was originally undertaken in order to realise managerial objectives 
such as growth or sales revenue maximization, then divestment may enable the 
firm to regain previous levels of profitability performance. Third, for an under-
performing firm, a divestment announcement may signal that management are 
addressing the problem and that changes are imminent. The stock market may 
view such an announcement in a positive light. Finally, if the divesting firm is 
acquired by a new owner, the potential for cost savings may generate gains which 
flow to the vendors via a higher purchase price. An improvement in performance 
is therefore linked with divestment.
Mair and Moschieri (2006) view deconglomeration as beneficial when there 
is a clash of cultures between the divisions of a conglomerate. Central manage-
ment might have a vested interested in the retention of the non-core divisions, but 
culture clashes may tend to consume scarce resources, such as managerial time 
and effort, and create barriers to internal capital mobility. Following divestment, 
resources are freed for reinvestment in the core activity. The divested unit might 
still benefit from the support of its former parent, through access to capital, 
expertise and reputation. For example, the electronics manufacturer Philips oper-
ates a Technology Incubator, which develops new ideas, with a view to selling 
them when they are able to attract their own customers, strategic partners and 
venture capital finance.
Porter (1990) suggests another reason for poor performance: the neglect of 
innovation in the divisions of the conglomerate. Innovation stems from focus and 
commitment to sustained investment in a specific activity. In contrast:
Unrelated diversification, particularly through acquisition, makes no 
contribution to innovation. Unrelated diversification almost inevitably 
detracts from focus, commitment and sustained investment in the core 
industries, no matter how well-intentioned management is at the outset. 
Acquired companies, where there is no link to existing businesses, often 
face short-term financial pressures to justify their purchase price. It is 
also difficult for corporate managers of a diversified firm to be forward-
looking in industries they do not know.
(Porter, 1990, p. 605)
I will continue to hold the view that management too often 
underestimates the problems in carrying through mergers, especially 
of companies in unrelated fields. It has indeed been one of the more 
welcome developments of recent years that companies have been 
increasingly concentrating on their core activities, divesting themselves

of some of the enterprises they have acquired in earlier diversifications. 
It is the very pressures of competition I referred to earlier that have 
forced so many companies to re-examine their structure.
(John Bridgeman, Director-General of Fair Trading, speech to the 
European Policy Forum, 30 January 1996)
In the light of most of this evidence, it is natural to wonder why companies 
ever diversified into unrelated activities, and why some still do. One possibility 
is that the diversification discount may once have been lower than it subse-
quently became (Matsusaka, 1993; Servaes, 1996). The increasing scope and 
efficiency of capital markets may have reduced the need for the conglomerate 
to act effectively as an internal capital market. In the US and UK in particular, 
the refocusing of many conglomerates during the 1980s and 1990s was made 
possible by leveraged buyouts, in which unsecured junk bonds and loans were 
used to buy up large diversified conglomerates. Typically, the less profitable 
parts of the target firm would be sold off, leaving only the more profitable 
core activities. The receipts from the sale of unrelated activities would be used 
to service and repay the unsecured loans. An example of this type of buyout 
was Hoylake’s attempt to buy British and American Tobacco which, in 1989, 
was the ninth largest company in Europe. In another case, Hanson’s purchase 
of a 2.8 per cent share in ICI was interpreted by the markets as a prelude to 
a full takeover bid. Investors inferred that to finance the takeover, Hanson 
would be forced to sell off some ICI divisions, and refocus the remaining 
activities. ICI fought back by splitting into two independent companies: one 
(ICI) concentrating on chemicals, and the other (Zeneca) on pharmaceuticals 
and agriculture. As a result of this strategy, the profitability and share prices 
of both companies increased.
	
23.5	
Empirical evidence
This section examines some of the empirical evidence concerning the reasons for 
diversification and its direction. The discussion starts by examining the measure-
ment of the degree of diversification.
In a technical sense, the measures of the extent of diversification are quite 
similar to the measures of concentration reviewed earlier (see Section 10.4). Con-
centration measures reflect the number and relative sizes of the firms operating 
in an industry. Diversification measures reflect the number of industries in which 
one firm is involved, and the relative scale of its involvement in each case (Gollop 
and Monahan, 1991; Lacktorin and Rajan, 2000). Some of the most widely used 
diversification measures are as follows:
■ A count of activities. One possibility is to simply count the number of three- or 
four-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) activities in which the firm is 
involved. This is perhaps too simple for most purposes: one would naturally wish 
to discount or disregard activities in which the firm’s involvement is very small.

692	
|	 23    ■    Diversification
■ Ratio of non-primary activities to all activities. A simple measure of the extent 
of diversification is the ratio DR = B/(A + B), where A represents the firm’s 
primary activity and B represents all other non-primary activities. A and B 
might be measured in terms of sales or employees. A specialised firm has 
DR = 0; and the greater the extent of diversification, the closer is DR to its 
maximum value of one. However, DR does not reflect the relative importance 
of each of the non-primary activities.
■ Herfindahl index of specialization, H(S). This index is based on a weighted sum 
of the share of each activity in the total of all of the firm’s activities (Berry, 
1971, 1974). It is defined in the same way as the Herfindahl–Hirschman (HH) 
index of concentration (see Section 10.4). For a firm involved in N activities, 
let xi denote the share of sales or employment in activity i in the firm’s total 
sales or employment. The H(S) index is calculated as follows:
H(S) = a
N
i=1
xi
2
	
The index is influenced by both the number of activities and their relative 
importance. The more specialised the firm, the greater is H(S). As in the case 
of the HH index of concentration, a numbers equivalent of the H(S) index is 
defined as 1/H(S). The numbers equivalent is an inverse measure of diversifica-
tion. For a firm with N activities (and using a sales-based measure), the mini-
mum possible value of the numbers equivalent is 1/H(S) = 1, when virtually 
all of the firm’s sales are derived from one activity, with a negligible propor-
tion split between the other N - 1 activities. The maximum possible value is 
1/H(S) = N, when the firm’s sales are split equally between the N activities.
Using 1963 UK manufacturing data, Gorecki (1975) examines the direction and 
determinants of diversification. Measurement of the direction of diversification 
distinguishes between diversification within and outside a firm’s two-digit indus-
try group. To measure direction, Gorecki calculates the extent of participation of 
diversified firms in other industries within a broadly defined industry, known as 
an order. An order roughly corresponds to a two-digit industry group. Gorecki’s 
dataset comprises 14 orders and 51 industries. The measure of direction is the 
T-value, the summation of the total number of enterprises that own establish-
ments in each of the other industries within the same order, divided by the sum-
mation of the total number of enterprises that own establishments in any other 
manufacturing industry.
The actual T-value can be compared with the T-value expected if diversifica-
tion occurs randomly across the other 50 industries. In the majority of cases 
examined by Gorecki, the actual T-value was greater than the expected T-value. 
In only a handful of cases, including building materials, footwear and furniture, 
was the actual value less than the expected value. Gorecki’s overall conclusion, 
that the direction of diversification was not random, is unequivocal.
In a regression model that seeks to identify the determinants of the decision 
to diversify, Gorecki’s dependent variable is the ratio of employment in non-
primary activities to total employment. Two types of independent variable are

used to explain diversification. The first covers activities determined by the firm, 
such as advertising and research and development, which produce specific assets 
(brands, trademarks, innovation) that can be exploited through diversification. 
Advertising is measured using an advertising-to-sales ratio, and research and 
development is measured using the number of research employees. Dummy 
variables control for differences between consumer and non-consumer goods 
industries. The second category of variables covers environmental factors, such 
as industry growth and concentration. Firms in low-growth industries are more 
likely to diversify in order to exploit their specific assets; therefore a negative rela-
tionship between growth and the extent of diversification is expected (although 
this relationship might be offset if firms in declining industries are unable to 
finance diversification). Firms in highly concentrated industries face higher costs 
of further expansion within the same industries. Firms in more highly concen-
trated industries are therefore expected to be more likely to diversify.
The estimation results do not support all of the hypotheses advanced above. 
The results are consistent with the hypothesis that diversification and research 
and development expenditure are positively related. However, the coefficient on 
the advertising-to-sales ratio is negative and not positive as expected. Gorecki 
suggests firms in consumer goods industries characterised by heavy advertising 
might vertically integrate forwards in order to protect their brands, and this type 
of strategy might be at the cost of diversification. The coefficients on industry 
growth and concentration are both statistically insignificant.
Writing from a strategic management perspective, Luffman and Reed (1984) 
examine diversification by UK firms during the 1970s, using a four-category 
methodology suggested by Rumelt (1974):
■ In a single business, more than 95 per cent of sales are accounted for by one 
product.
■ In a dominant firm, between 70 per cent and 95 per cent of sales are accounted 
for by one product.
■ In a related firm, no one product accounts for more than 70 per cent of sales, 
but all products are related.
■ In an unrelated firm, no one product accounts for more than 70 per cent of 
sales, and the products are unrelated.
Luffman and Reed find there was a trend towards increased diversification dur-
ing the 1970s, although the trend was not as strong as in the decades immediately 
after the Second World War. There was significant movement into unrelated 
(conglomerate) activities.
Rondi et al. (1996) measure the extent of diversification among major firms 
producing within the EU, and attempt to identify the major determinants of 
diversification. Their sample is based on the five leading EU firms in each manu-
facturing industry. Although both EU and non-EU firms are considered, any 
production activity located outside the EU is ignored. The diversification mea-
sures used are those described at the start of this section: first, a simple count of 
different industry involvement, N; second, the ratio of secondary production to 
total production, DR; and, third, the Berry (1971, 1974) index, D = 1 - H(S).

|	 23    ■    Diversification
All three measures are calculated at the two-digit and three-digit levels, to allow a 
distinction to be drawn between product extension (related) and pure (unrelated) 
diversification. Production outside the two-digit level implies pure diversification.
Table 23.1 summarises the results. The average firm is involved in almost five 
three-digit industries, and almost three two-digit industries. Around 28 per cent 
of output is produced outside the primary two-digit industry, and 17 per cent is 
produced within the primary two-digit industry. By country, the highest levels 
of diversification at the three-digit level were for the UK and the Netherlands, 
and the lowest levels were for Italy and Germany.
In examining the determinants of diversification, Rondi et al. (1996) focus 
on three theories of diversification. The first, attributed to Marris (1964) and 
Penrose (1959), suggests managers seek to maximise the growth of the firm. The 
exploitation of specific assets such as marketing skills and technical expertise in 
other industries provides a convenient vehicle for the pursuit of a growth objec-
tive. The second theory, attributed to Bain (1959), focuses on the conditions that 
make entry possible or attractive. These include industry-level characteristics such 
as average profitability, growth and concentration, as well as barriers to entry. 
The third theory, attributed to Rumelt (1984) and Williamson (1975), focuses on 
relatedness between industries that makes diversification attractive. Relatedness 
refers to similarities between technologies, markets and organizational structures.
Rondi et al.’s empirical model is:
P(F,P,S) = f{W(F),X(P),Y(S),Z(P,S)}
The dependent variable P(F, P, S) is the probability that firm F with primary 
activity P diversifies into secondary activity S. The independent variables are 
W(F), a vector of characteristics of firm F; X(P), a vector of characteristics of 
primary activity P; Y(S), a vector of characteristics of secondary activity S; and 
Z(P, S), a vector reflecting the degree of relatedness between P and S.
The vector W(F) includes a firm size measure to reflect the ease with which a 
firm can acquire resources; a measure of the size of the firm’s domestic market 
to reflect the opportunities for growth; and dummy variables to capture relevant 
characteristics of each country’s capital markets. X(P) includes indicators of 
advertising intensity, research and development, human resources and capital

intensity, to reflect the firm’s specific assets. Y(S) includes measures of the attrac-
tiveness of secondary industries and the height of entry barriers, captured using 
industry growth, profitability, advertising intensity, research and development, 
human resources and capital intensity indicators. Z(P, S) includes measures of 
the relatedness of each secondary and primary industry, also based on advertis-
ing, research and development, human resources and capital intensity indicators.
The estimation results suggest firm size matters. Large firms are more likely to 
diversify than small firms. Firms originating from countries where there is a separa-
tion of ownership from control (proxied by capital market characteristics) are more 
likely to diversify. However, the size of the domestic market has no effect on the 
probability of diversification. Diversification is more likely if levels of advertising, 
research and development and specific human capital skills are high in both the 
primary and secondary activities. Specific assets play an important role in deter-
mining the rate and direction of diversification, as does the degree of relatedness: 
diversification often involves entry into secondary industries with characteristics 
similar to the primary industry. The coefficients on capital intensity are negative, 
supporting the notion that entry barriers influence the direction of diversification.
Altunbaş and Marqués (2008) examine diversification through merger in the 
EU banking industry. Does diversification into new financial services and diver-
sification into geographical areas yield benefits including economies of scale and 
scope, reduction of risk, increased use of specific assets and improved access to 
low-cost (internal) finance? Alternatively, does diversification produce disecono-
mies of scale as the organization becomes too complex to manage efficiently? 
Does the degree of organizational and strategic similarity between the merger 
partners influence their subsequent performance? Broad similarities between the 
merging firms are found to improve post-merger performance. However, there 
are differences in the pattern between different types of merger (domestic or 
international), and between mergers involving different strategies regarding loans 
and deposits, capitalization, technology and innovation.
Using a dataset comprising the entire range of US financial intermediaries, 
Schmid and Walter (2012) investigate whether geographic diversification is 
value-enhancing or value-destroying in the financial services sector. The results 
indicate that geographic diversification is not associated with a valuation dis-
count in financial intermediaries. However, when accounting for the firms’ main 
activities, there is evidence of a significant discount associated with geographic 
diversification in securities firms, and a premium in credit intermediaries and 
insurance companies.
Santalo and Becerra (2008) examine the effects of diversification on perfor-
mance, taking account of industry characteristics. Most empirical studies mea-
sure the average effect of diversification on performance on the assumption either 
that this effect is homogeneous across industries, or that it varies randomly. 
There is evidence of a diversification discount when a diversified firm competes 
in an industry dominated by specialised producers. Conversely, there is evidence 
of a diversification premium when the diversified firm faces only a few specialised 
competitors, whose share of the relevant market is small.
In general, the empirical evidence on the direction and determinants of diver-
sification in the UK and Europe suggests firms tend to be relatively cautious in 

696

their diversification strategies, preferring in most cases to remain close to their 
technological and market bases. Perhaps the single most important motive for 
diversification is the opportunity to exploit specific assets within related industries.
	
23.6	
The multinational enterprise
Some firms choose to exploit opportunities for diversification via expansion 
into foreign markets. Around 2000 BC there was regular trade between ancient 
Babylonia and Egypt (Leemans, 1960). International trade has grown through 
the centuries, accelerating in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries with the 
expansion of financial intermediation, supply chains and communications. By 
the middle of the nineteenth century risk had been reduced to a level where large 
firms found it feasible to undertake direct investments in foreign production 
(foreign direct investment, FDI), rather than rely solely on exports and imports.
In the nineteenth century FDI sought to exploit natural resources in Euro-
pean colonies located in Africa, Asia and Latin America. During the twentieth 
century, FDI in manufacturing was an important part of the growth strategy 
of many Western European, North American and Asian companies, not only 
in developing countries where labour costs were low and regulation minimal, 
but also in developed countries. Towards the end of the twentieth century, the 
emphasis in FDI shifted towards financial and other services. Foreign expansion 
can take many forms, including exports, licensing, joint ventures and foreign 
direct investment (FDI). A MNE may acquire a sufficient ownership stake in a 
foreign company to take control; or it may construct its own plant or acquire 
existing foreign plant. Additional investment may be financed by profits gener-
ated by the foreign entity, or directly from the parent company.
Why do firms make investments abroad? Traditional economic analysis assumes 
that international expansion takes place to increase revenues, or reduce produc-
tion costs. International expansion may be motivated by opportunities to access 
new markets and expand sales. A typical progression would advance from exports 
through setting up marketing operations to the building or acquisition of produc-
tion facilities. The parent firm may have achieved a saturation level of demand 
in its domestic market, and further growth can only be achieved by investment 
abroad. The parent firm may itself face competitive pressure from inward invest-
ment by foreign firms, and international diversification may be seen as a strategy 
for protecting its ability to continue to operate at its current scale. Cost-saving 
motives may include access to cheaper labour or raw materials, or minimization 
of transport costs. Furthermore, grants, subsidies, preferential tax arrangements 
and access to ready-built plant may be offered by host governments to attract FDI.
MNE paradigms and typologies
Several typologies describe the nature of MNE involvement in foreign investment 
(Perlmutter, 1969; Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1989; Faeth, 2009). An early example is 
the Perlmutter ethnocentric, polycentric and geocentric (EPG) model. Ethnocen-
tric firms are those where the parent company prioritises the development and

marketing of goods for its domestic market. The firm exercises near total control 
over the strategic direction of its foreign entities, frequently run by expatriate 
senior management. In consequence, inefficiencies arise through ignorance of 
local markets. The prevailing attitude is that what works in the home market 
will work abroad. Polycentric firms are more focused on foreign activity. The 
parent company cedes partial control to its foreign subsidiaries. These subsid-
iaries are assumed to be better at exploiting resources and developing strategic 
plans specific to their own geographic and product market. However, poor com-
munications between the parent and a foreign subsidiary can lead to failures of 
coordination and operational inefficiencies. Geocentric firms view themselves as 
foreign operations that uniquely serve a global strategy or vision, and rely on 
global supply chains, staffing, R&D and marketing. Senior management owes 
an allegiance neither to the home nor the host country, but to the organization 
itself. Company headquarters defines itself as serving a global market.
Until the 1960s, MNEs were seen primarily as a channel for the relocation 
of capital from country to country. Resources flow to wherever they are most 
productive. Capital movements also exploit differences in interest rates. Hymer 
(1976) identifies several reasons why firms’ home and overseas investments 
should be treated separately. First, the activities of MNEs do not necessary 
require an outflow of investment, but may instead draw on local capital. Second, 
investment may flow in both directions between home and host countries. Third, 
the activities of some MNEs span many countries. Ietto-Gillies (2012) suggests 
that by exercising control over its investments, the firm can reduce the costs of 
dealing with local industry structures and various market imperfections.
Vernon (1966, 1971) argues that in developed economies where capital is rela-
tively cheap, labour costs are high, and consumers have relatively high income, 
the environment is conducive to innovation. Initially a new developed product is 
launched in the sophisticated local market, yielding the firm a degree of market 
power, as well as room to make minor product improvements and correct techni-
cal errors. As the product matures, the firm faces an increase in foreign demand 
from developed countries, met initially by exports. Later the increase in demand, 
or changes in the conditions of trade, may justify direct investment. If production 
costs in the home country increase, the firm may consider moving production 
and marketing functions to less developed countries. Both at home and abroad, 
however, the entry of new firms (imitators) tends to erode market share.
Dunning (1977) observes that MNEs have three types of advantage over local 
competitors. Ownership advantages may include superior access to upstream or 
downstream markets, diversification benefits, proprietary knowledge, technical 
and marketing expertise, brand recognition, and R&D capability. Locational 
advantages explain why MNEs select specific foreign markets over others. These 
may include low labour costs, availability of a skilled labour force, good infra-
structure, a strong domestic market, a favourable tax regime, or government 
support. For example, in the 1980s UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher prom-
ised Japanese companies investing in the UK that she would lobby for them to 
be classified as British by the EU, allowing them access to European markets. 
An important aspect might also be a positive cultural dimension that fosters 
trust and confidence (Bhardwaj et al., 2007). Internalization advantages refer 
to transaction costs savings (see Chapter 5) realised when transactions between

entities operating in different countries are internalised within an MNE, rather 
than executed via markets (Rugman, 1985; Dunning, 1991).
The myth of global strategy?
It has been suggested that much FDI is located within a geographical space (or 
so-called ‘triad’) occupied by the US, the EU and Japan, which can be expanded 
to include NAFTA, Europe and the Far East including Oceania (Ohmae, 1985, 
1990). The triad is characterised by low macroeconomic growth, similar technol-
ogies, capital- and knowledge-intensive corporations, and homogeneous market 
demand. The typical MNE is focused on its own sphere of influence within the 
triad; and relatively few MNEs can claim to be truly global, such as those found 
in consumer electronics, strongly branded food producers and software indus-
tries (Berrill, 2015; Oh and Li 2015; Verbeke and Kano, 2016). In 2000 the triad 
housed 430 of the top 500 MNEs (Rugman, 2000). Most of these firms focus 
investment on their own knowledge and technical capabilities generating a flow 
of innovative products. However, the initial advantages gained from launching 
successful products are soon eroded by the diffusion of the technology to domes-
tic and foreign rivals, regardless of any institutional protection of their property 
rights. Some MNEs respond by attempting to become more deeply imbedded 
in their triad markets, building the capability to survive adverse events. MNEs 
that become ‘insiders’ may be able to develop global supply chains, and effective 
strategies for cross-subsidization and retaliation.
Table 23.2 shows the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD) rankings of the 30 top non-financial MNEs according to foreign 
assets, and the rankings of these firms by a transnationality index (TNI). This 
index is the arithmetic mean of three ratios: foreign assets to total assets; foreign 
sales to total sales; and foreign employment to total employment. Values of the 
TNI can vary from 0 per cent to 100 per cent (where 100 per cent indicates that 
all of the firm’s activities are overseas). For example, Rio Tinto Zinc, ranked 
30th by foreign assets, is ranked 1st by TNI, with a score of 99.22 per cent. Using 
the UNCTAD TNI index for 1999, Dicken (2010) finds a mean average TNI of 
52.6 per cent. Only 57 of the top 100 firms had an index greater than 50 per cent, 
and only 16 had an index greater than 75 per cent. From the data presented in 
Table 23.2, the mean average is 65.4 per cent and 83 of the top 100 companies 
have an index over 50 per cent.
Using data from Egypt, India, South Africa and Vietnam, Meyer et al. (2009) 
examine the effect of formal and informal institutions (legal system, property 
rights, information systems, enforcement agencies) on the mode of entry (green-
field investments, acquisitions, joint ventures) of MNEs. Greenfield investments 
or acquisitions tend to be selected when institutions are well developed, and joint 
ventures (to secure resources) when institutions are less developed.
Effects of FDI on local firms and innovation
An important aspect of the study of MNEs is their effects on the performance 
of local business in the host country. After having surmounted entry barriers, 
the MNE branch or subsidiary is likely to challenge the market power of local

suppliers, and perhaps spur these firms into producing more efficiently. The use 
of newer technologies by MNEs might have several consequences for local firms: 
reduction in supply bottlenecks; exposure of local businesses to more advanced 
technical knowledge; enhanced training of the local workforce; introduction of 
superior systems for quality and inventory control; and improved vertical relation-
ships with suppliers and distributors (Blomström and Kokko, 2003). It is difficult 
to generalise, however, and the impact needs to be identified on a case-by-case 
basis. In a study of the impact of FDI in China on state-owned enterprises (SOEs), 
Girma and Gong (2008) find that competition from FDI has a negative effect on 
the growth and survival of SOEs in the same sector that do not have access to 
foreign capital. There is no evidence of spillover effects that could be attributed to 
FDI in upstream sectors, suggesting limited linkages between MNEs and SOEs.
Empirical research into the impact of FDI on the diffusion of technology and 
knowledge has produced mixed results. A 2002 OECD report maps the spread of 
technology to less developed countries through four channels, referred to as verti-
cal, horizontal, migration of skilled labour, and internalization of R&D. The ver-
tical channel refers to linkages with suppliers or purchasers in the host countries, 
and the horizontal channel refers to linkages with competing or complementary 
suppliers in the same industry. According to the OECD report, technology trans-
fer operates primarily through the vertical channel, and mainly upstream: MNEs 
invest in technical assistance, staff training, or upgrading local plants, to improve 
the quality or increase the supply of intermediate goods. In a survey of SMEs 
(small and medium-sized enterprises), Stiebale and Reize (2011) find a negative 
impact of foreign acquisition on the propensity to innovate. Sales of innovative 
products are not significantly affected by foreign acquisition. Using UK firm-
level data, Criscuolo et al. (2010) find that global firms are more innovative, not 
only because they invest more in R&D, but also because they absorb worldwide 
knowledge from local industries, suppliers, consumers and universities. Ghazal 
and Zulkhibri (2015) examine the determinants of innovation, using a patents 
measure, in developing countries. The efficiency of local institutions and gover-
nance has a positive effect in attracting FDI, and promoting innovation.
Case study 23.3
EM leads DM in cross-border M&A  
for first time
FT
For the first time, transnational corporations from emerging market (EM) countries spent 
more on foreign acquisitions last year than companies from developed market (DM) 
countries, according to a study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Develop-
ment. Led by some record breaking acquisitions by Chinese and Russian companies, EM 
transnational corporations (TNCs) accounted for 56 per cent of total cross-border trans-
actions in 2013, the study found. In total the value of cross-border M&A deals – from 

	
	
	
23.6  The multinational enterprise	 |

EM and DM sources – rose 5 per cent in 2013 to $349bn. More than two- thirds of 
cross-border purchases by EM companies involved the takeover of companies in other 
developing countries. Half of the companies bought by TNCs originating from develop-
ing countries were purchased from TNCs based in developed countries.
The rise in purchases by companies from EMs has led to an increase in overall foreign 
direct investment by EM transnational corporations to $100bn in 2013, accounting for 
39 per cent of worldwide FDI outflows. EM companies accounted for only 12 per cent 
of FDI outflows 15 years ago. There are two reasons for the FDI trend, says James 
Zhan, director of UNCTAD’s Investment and Enterprise Division: ‘One is the consistent 
increase in investment from developing countries. But the increase of the share of FDI 
from developing countries is partly because of the drastic decline in outward investment 
from developed country TNCs.’
The financial crisis prompted TNCs from developed countries to sell off their foreign 
assets which were bought by companies from EMs. ‘If you compare with the peak level 
of outward investment from developed country TNCs in 2007 and today, it is 55 per cent 
lower,’ says Zhan. Chinese companies invested $101bn abroad in 2013, topping the list 
of emerging market spenders. Chinese companies made 15 per cent more foreign invest-
ments in 2013 than in the previous year. The $19bn acquisition of Canada’s Nexen by 
Chinese state oil company CNOOC and $5bn buyout of US-based Smithfield Foods by 
Shuanghui were behind the increase.
In developing markets, PetroChina’s acquisition of a Mozambican subsidiary from 
Italy’s ENI Spa for over $4bn and Sinopec’s $3bn purchase of Apache’s Egyptian oil and 
gas business were also important. The completion of Rosneft’s acquisition of TNK-BP 
in March last year had a similar effect on Russia’s FDI, as the company was previously 
owned by an investment vehicle registered in the British Virgin Islands. FDI by TNCs 
from Qatar more than quadrupled last year, while Kuwaiti companies invested 159 per 
cent more in foreign countries in 2013 than in 2012. While TNCs from developed coun-
tries stuck to investments in select industries such as telecommunications, buyers from 
EMs invested in many sectors, particularly consumer goods and banking.

Sweetheart tax deals targeted as EU  
boosts information exchange
FT
EU nations face more scrutiny over sweetheart tax deals with multinational companies 
after finance ministers on Tuesday agreed to boost information sharing in response to the 
LuxLeaks scandal. The move is the first major step to be agreed by the EU since leaked 

702	
|	 23    ■    Diversification
documents revealed last year that Luxembourg had issued hundreds of so-called tax rul-
ings with companies from Pepsi to Ikea that allowed the companies to lower their tax 
bills by channelling profits through the Grand Duchy. Tuesday’s deal will require finance 
ministries to exchange information on tax rulings with each other automatically, without 
any need for a request. The law will take effect at the start of 2017, although data on past 
deals will also have to be shared. While the measure does not directly curb the practice of 
arranging sweetheart deals, ministers and the European Commission said it would have 
a deterrent effect.
‘This is a major step in combating aggressive tax planning, creating greater transpar-
ency in corporate taxation and in providing fairer competition for both businesses and 
consumers,’ Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner in charge of tax policy, said. Public 
outrage at the LuxLeaks scandal prompted the EU to launch probes into whether such 
deals constitute illegal state aid. The most advanced investigations target Starbucks in 
the Netherlands, Apple in Ireland, and Amazon and Fiat in Luxembourg. In tandem, 
the commission has unveiled broader plans to curb aggressive tax competition between 
EU nations. Tuesday’s accord waters down a proposal from Mr Moscovici that nations 
should have to supply information on deals struck as long ago as 2007 — a decade before 
the new law becomes operational on January 1, 2017. Instead, the requirement will 
stretch back only five years, to 2012. For past rulings that are now defunct the equivalent 
deadline will be 2014.
Mr Moscovici said the agreement was ‘a solid, fair compromise’ and that his original 
plan would have presented ‘a very serious administrative burden’ for nations. The deal 
comes ahead of a summit of the Group of 20 next month where leaders are expected to 
agree to more transparency over tax rulings.
The Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development called for 
the compulsory and spontaneous exchange of information on such rulings at international 
level to combat tax base erosion and profit shifting. Tax campaigners and members of the 
European Parliament denounced Tuesday’s EU accord as inadequate.
‘This problem won’t go away just because our European tax administrations get more 
information,’ the European Network on Debt and Development said in a statement. 
‘Unfortunately, it’s still completely legal for multinational corporations to avoid taxes, 
and what our tax administrations can do is very limited.’
Sven Giegold, a member of the European Parliament from Germany’s Green party, 
said the deal was a missed opportunity to give the commission access to data that it could 
use in competition probes into tax deals. ‘It is outrageous that the member states protect 
their transnational corporations against investigations by the EU commission,’ he said. 
The EU deal was only reached after last minute haggling over the extent to which tax

by the rules.
The Netherlands, which is under investigation by the EU’s competition arm for a sweet-

Summary
Chapter 23 has examined the topic of diversification. There are three basic types 
of diversification. Diversification by product extension implies a firm supplies 
a new product that is closely related to its existing products. Diversification by 
market extension implies a firm supplies its existing product in a new geographic 
market. Finally, pure diversification involves a movement into a completely 
unrelated field of activity. There are two ways in which a diversification strategy 
can be implemented: first, through internally generated expansion; and, second, 
through conglomerate merger. While diversification through internal expansion 
leads to an increase in the total productive capacity in the industry concerned, 
diversification through conglomerate merger involves only a transfer of owner-
ship and control over existing productive capacity.
Several theories have been developed to explain why a firm might decide to 
pursue a diversification strategy:
■ Enhancement of market power. The diversified firm may be in a strong posi-
tion to compete against a specialised rival by drawing on cash flows or prof-
its earned elsewhere within the organization, effectively cross-subsidizing the 
costs of engaging the rival in either price or non-price forms of competition. 
Reciprocity and tying may be attractive strategies for a diversified firm that is 
seeking to generate sales across several distinct product lines.
■ Cost savings. Diversification can result in cost savings in three ways. First, 
economies of scope are realised when the costs of indivisibilities are spread 
over the production of several goods or services, or when the diversified pro-
ducer is able to realise other types of average cost saving. Second, diversifica-
tion reduces the firm’s exposure to adverse fluctuations in demand in any one 
of its product markets. The ability to manage risk through diversification may 
reduce the firm’s cost of raising finance. Third, by offsetting profits earned 
from one activity against losses in another, a diversified firm may be able to 
reduce its tax exposure.
■ Reduction of transaction costs. If investors are unable to access reliable 
information in order to judge the performance of managers, the efficient 
allocation of investment funds may be impeded. Within a diversified firm 
or conglomerate, central managers at head office undertake the task of 
allocating funds between the divisions of the conglomerate. Effectively, the 

704	
|	 23    ■    Diversification
conglomerate acts as a miniature capital market, but enjoys better access to 
information and is able to monitor performance more effectively. Most firms 
possess specific assets that are of value if exploited in other markets. If the 
transaction costs incurred in trading specific assets through the market are 
high, it may be better for the firm to exploit the assets itself by implementing 
a diversification strategy.
■ Managerial motives for diversification. According to several of the early man-
agerial theories of the firm, diversification is the principal method by which 
growth in demand is achieved in the long run. Managers might target growth 
rather than profit because their compensation and prestige are related to 
the size or growth of the organization. Diversification might increase the 
managers’ value to the organization, and it might enhance their job security 
by reducing risk.
During the 1980s and 1990s there was a shift of emphasis away from diver-
sification, and in some cases towards the divestment of unrelated activities in 
pursuit of increased focus. There is some empirical evidence of a diversification 
discount: a tendency for conglomerates to underperform relative to specialised 
firms in terms of profitability and stock market valuation. This may explain 
why shareholders encouraged managers to implement a strategy of divestment 
or deconglomeration.
There are several reasons why a diversified firm might underperform, or 
why a policy of divestment might be expected to bring about an improvement 
in performance. First, some conglomerates may simply be too large and their 
organizational structures overstretched. Second, if diversification was originally 
undertaken in pursuit of non-profit objectives, divestment might enable the firm 
to recover previous levels of profitability. Third, a divestment announcement 
may signal to the stock market that the problems of an underperforming con-
glomerate are being addressed. Finally, in the more market-oriented environment 
of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, the economic rationale for 
the existence of large, highly diversified conglomerates is perhaps less persuasive 
than it may have been during the decades up to the 1970s, when the trend towards 
corporate diversification was apparently at its strongest.
A multinational enterprise that diversifies geographically into a foreign mar-
ket might benefit from several advantages, such as access to cheap resources, 
reduction of transport costs, reduction of tax exposure, and financial induce-
ments from government. An important aspect of the study of MNEs is their 
effects on the performance of local business in the host country. The entry of 
an MNE may undermine the market power of local suppliers, or act as a spur 
to greater efficiency. Research into the impact of FDI on the diffusion of tech-
nology and knowledge has produced mixed results, with some evidence that 
technology transfer operates primarily through linkages with local suppliers of 
raw materials or other inputs. MNEs may invest in technical assistance, staff 
training, or upgrading local plants to improve the quality or increase the supply 
of intermediate goods.

Introduction
Chapter 24 examines competition policy. There are strong associations between 
competition and the theoretical notions of productive and allocative efficiency 
(see Section 3.4). Firms operating in competitive markets may be compelled to 
achieve full efficiency in production, or face the prospect of being driven out 
of business by more efficient competitors. The long-run market equilibrium in 
perfect competition is also consistent with allocative efficiency, since the industry 
operates at the point where price equals marginal cost. Accordingly, the eco-
nomic case for competition policy rests largely on the theoretical arguments for 
and against perfect competition and monopoly. These arguments are examined 
in Section 24.2.
The idea that competition is always preferable to monopoly has not gone 
unchallenged. If the monopolist is able to operate on a lower average or marginal 
cost function than the firms comprising a perfectly competitive industry, then 
social welfare could be higher under monopoly than under perfect competition. 
The theories of natural monopoly and price discrimination can also be used to 
make a case for monopoly based on social welfare criteria. The Schumpeterian 
hypothesis suggests that market power and monopoly status may be interpreted 
as a reward for successful past innovation.
Section 24.3 discusses some of the more practical aspects of competition pol-
icy. Competition policy deals with three principal areas: monopoly, restrictive 
practices and merger. The implementation of monopoly, restrictive practices and 
merger policy requires a practical method for measuring market power. Seller 
concentration and market share measures are obvious candidates. Issues of 
product and geographic market definition have major implications for the mea-
surement of market power using concentration or market share measures. The 
notion of workable competition, which may provide a more realistic target than 
the theoretical ideal of perfect competition, is examined.
At the time of writing, competition policy in the UK is the responsibility of the 
Competition and Markets Authority. One of the objectives of UK competition 
policy legislation (until 2016 at least) was to harmonise the UK’s arrangements 
with those effective at EU level. Section 24.4 describes the competition policy 
regimes of the US, the EU and the UK. A major objective of EU competition 
policy is the promotion of competition within the European Single Market. The 
cornerstones are Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which came into 
force in 2009, replacing earlier competition policy provisions within the Treaty of 
Rome. This chapter concludes in Section 24.5 with an evaluation of the strengths 
and weaknesses of current competition policy arrangements.

Competition policy: theoretical framework
According to the structure–conduct–performance (SCP) paradigm, perfect com-
petition is the market structure with the most favourable efficiency and welfare 
properties. In much of the theoretical and policy debate, there is an implicit

711
assumption that competition is good and monopoly bad. This section examines 
the economic case for and against monopoly in some detail. Several of the argu-
ments have already been rehearsed in previous chapters of this book. As has been 
shown previously, not all economists agree that monopoly is necessarily a worse 
state of affairs than competition.
Abnormal profit, allocative and productive inefficiency
A comparison between the models of perfect competition and monopoly in 
the neoclassical theory of the firm was developed early on in this book (see 
­Section 3.4). The case for perfect competition and against monopoly was made 
on the grounds of allocative and productive efficiency (see Figures 3.5 and 3.6). 
The monopolist and the perfectly competitive industry were assumed to both 
face the same horizontal LRAC (long-run average cost) and LRMC (long-run 
marginal cost) function (see Figure 3.5). Some of the consumer surplus achieved 
under perfect competition is converted into producer surplus (abnormal profit) 
under monopoly; and the rest becomes deadweight loss. Therefore, monopoly 
is allocatively inefficient. It was further assumed that a complacent monopolist, 
shielded from competitive pressure emanating either from rival firms or from 
actual or potential entrants, operates on a higher LRAC and LRMC function 
than it would if it were fully efficient in production (see Figure 3.6). This leads 
to a further increase in the deadweight loss. The main findings of this analysis 
can be summarised as follows:
■ Under monopoly, market price is higher and output is lower than under per-
fect competition. If LRAC is U-shaped or L-shaped, the monopolist typically 
fails to produce at the MES (minimum efficient scale), and therefore fails to 
produce at the lowest attainable LRAC. In contrast, the perfectly competitive 
firm produces at the MES in long-run equilibrium. The monopolist earns an 
abnormal profit in the long run, while the perfectly competitive firm earns only 
a normal profit.
■ Under monopoly, there is allocative inefficiency because price exceeds mar-
ginal cost. This implies the value society would place on an additional unit 
of output (measured by the price the most marginal consumer is prepared to 
pay) exceeds the cost of producing that unit. Therefore, industry output is too 
low and welfare could be increased by producing more output. In contrast, 
under perfect competition there is allocative efficiency because price equals 
marginal cost.
■ Under monopoly, there may also be productive inefficiency if a lack of com-
petitive pressure enables the monopolist to become complacent or lazy. A 
complacent monopolist may fail to make the most efficient use of its factor 
inputs (technical inefficiency), or it may fail to employ the most cost-effective 
combination of inputs (economic inefficiency). Under perfect competition, 
intense competitive pressure compels all firms to be efficient in production, 
since any firm that fails to minimise its LRAC will realise a loss and be forced 
out of business.

712	
|	 24    ■    Competition policy
■ The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is lower under monopoly 
than it is under perfect competition. Therefore, under monopoly, there is a 
deadweight loss due to industry output being lower than it is under perfect 
competition. The existence of a deadweight loss is a corollary of the monopo-
list’s preference to produce an output level at which price exceeds marginal 
cost (allocative inefficiency). The size of the deadweight loss is increased if the 
monopolist is also inefficient in production.
However, a further possibility (not considered in Figures 3.5 and 3.6) is that 
the monopolist could operate on a lower LRAC and LRMC function than the 
firms comprising the perfectly competitive industry. For example, by exploiting 
economies of scale in research and development, the monopolist might be able 
to gain access to a production technology that is not available to a group of per-
fectly competitive firms. This argument is developed by Williamson (1968a,b), 
and has often been used in support of large firms seeking to merge horizontally, 
despite the fact that the merged entity would acquire enhanced market power. 
This efficiency defence for mergers forms part of the US Department of Justice 
Merger Guidelines.
Figure 24.1 considers prices, costs and output under conditions of monopoly 
and perfect competition, in the case where the monopolist’s costs are below those 
of the firms under perfect competition. The perfect competitors’ cost functions are 
LRMC1 = LRAC1, and the monopolist’s cost functions are LRMC3 = LRAC3. 
The perfectly competitive industry operates at (PC, QC) (as in Figure 3.5). Consumer 
surplus is A + B + C and producer surplus (abnormal profit) is zero. The monopo-
list operates at (P3, Q3). Consumer surplus is A and producer surplus is B + D. 
Comparing the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus in the two cases, 
welfare is higher under monopoly than it is under perfect competition if D 7 C. 
Whether this condition is satisfied depends on the size of the difference between 
Figure 24.1  Consumer and producer surplus: perfect competition versus a monopolist with 
a cost advantage

	
	
	
24.2  Competition policy: theoretical framework	 |	
713
LRMC1 = LRAC1 and LRMC3 = LRAC3: the larger the difference, the more 
likely it is that welfare is higher under monopoly than it is under perfect competition.
Overall, the theoretical evidence as to whether monopoly leads to a reduction 
in efficiency and social welfare is inconclusive. Consequently, the case for and 
against the continuation of any particular monopoly must be assessed on an 
individual basis.
The regulatory problems posed by dominant positions in the private 
sector can be brought into focus by considering the distinction between 
technical efficiency and allocative efficiency. In many markets the need 
of technical efficiency may threaten allocative efficiency by allowing 
firms to attain dominance due to economies of large size to bolster their 
position by restrictive or exclusionary practices. Success in this respect 
may then also create x-inefficiency and thus reduce welfare still further.
(Utton, 1986, p. 135)
Harberger (1954) estimates that the welfare loss from monopolization accounted 
for 0.1 per cent of US gross national product over the period 1921–8. ­Kamerschen 
(1966) reports a much larger estimate of almost 6 per cent of national income 
for the period 1956–61. Cowling and Mueller (1978) evaluate several measures 
of welfare loss for the US (1963–6) and the UK (1968–9). They find that in the 
former case, welfare losses arising from monopoly range from 4 per cent to 
13.1 per cent of national income. In the latter, they range from 3.9 per 
cent to 7.2 per cent. Jenny and Weber (1983) report welfare losses for France 
ranging from 0.14 per cent to 8.9 per cent for the period 1967–74. Hay and Mor-
ris (1991) point out that many of these studies were carried out at national level, 
and so provide little information concerning the welfare effects of monopoly at 
industry level. Littlechild (1981) argues that monopoly profits are a temporary 
phenomenon, and short-run welfare losses should not be overemphasised.
Natural monopoly
As shown earlier (see Section 3.4), a natural monopoly is a market in which LRAC 
is decreasing as output increases over the entire range of outputs that could con-
ceivably be produced, given the location of the market demand function. (This 
case is illustrated in Figure 3.7.) There is insufficient market demand for any 
firm to exploit all possible opportunities for savings in average costs through 
economies of scale; in other words, there is insufficient market demand for any 
firm to attain the MES (minimum efficient scale) of production. In a natural 
monopoly, monopoly is always more cost-effective than competition. LRAC is 
lower if one firm services the entire market than if two (or more) firms share the 
market between them. In a natural monopoly, fixed costs tend to constitute a 
large proportion of total costs. Utilities (water, gas, electricity) and telecommu-
nications are the most obvious examples of industries that tend to conform, to 
some extent, to the textbook case of natural monopoly. Competition would tend 
to lead to wasteful duplication of infrastructure and delivery systems. Box 24.1 
examines ownership arrangements under natural monopoly.

Box 24.1
Ownership arrangements under natural monopoly
There are several possible ownership arrangements under natural monopoly. The first 
is public ownership, which normally involves granting statutory rights to a single firm. 
In doing so, the firm can be required to price its products in a competitive manner. A 
second solution is to open up the relevant market to competition. In many countries, the 
privatization of previously nationalised industries, involving the transfer of state-owned 
assets to the private sector, has been accompanied by efforts to create more competitive 
post-privatization market conditions. A final solution is to allow temporary monopoly 
rights through the granting of a franchise. In this case, competition takes place prior to the 
award of the franchise during the bidding process, with stipulations concerning matters 
such as price and quality of service written into the successful bidder’s contract.
Nationalization
Nationalization involves the creation of a statutory monopoly owned and controlled by 
the government. Usually, competition is prohibited: other firms cannot enter and compete 
with the established monopolist. Domberger and Piggott (1986) suggest there is a strong 
case for public ownership of natural monopolies. By assuming ownership, the govern-
ment can instruct the firm to pursue certain objectives or adopt certain policies. The aim 
is to correct market failures associated with market power, externalities and asymmetric 
information, and to satisfy the necessary conditions for allocative efficiency. In practice, 
however, allocative efficiency may be difficult to achieve, if a marginal cost pricing policy 
causes the natural monopolist to realise a loss (see Section 3.4, Figure 3.7). Therefore 
second-best policies are sometimes pursued: the firm might adopt average cost pricing; 
or the government might provide a subsidy to cover the losses entailed by marginal cost 
pricing (Lipsey and Lancaster, 1956).
Nationalisation involving the creation of a statutory monopoly may result in the elimi-
nation of wasteful competition, or it may allow the full exploitation of economies of scale. 
In some cases, nationalization may be justified in terms of social objectives, such as the 
provision of services that would otherwise be deemed uneconomic by the private sector: 
for example, postal or telephone services to rural areas.
However, the public provision of goods and services does raise a number of diffi-
cult issues. Nationalised firms are generally shielded from the rigours of competition. 
Therefore there is little or no threat of bankruptcy, as losses are effectively underwritten 
or recovered by means of government subsidy. Nationalised firms are also protected 
from the threat of being taken over. Consequently, there may be little or no incentive 
for the managers of nationalised firms to achieve full productive efficiency, especially if 
the managers’ remuneration is not directly linked to the organization’s performance. In 
many cases, conflict between political and economic objectives has made nationalised 
firms difficult to manage. Nationalised firms may be instructed to follow non-commercial 
objectives in pursuit of policy objectives concerning employment, procurement and trade.

715
Privatization
Privatization involves the transfer and sale of assets from the public to the private sector. 
The transfer of assets can be implemented by means of a sale of shares to financial institu-
tions and the general public. Privatization may or may not be accompanied by a process 
of deregulation (or market liberalization).
The following points contribute to the economic case for privatization:
■ Increased competition. Privatization may encourage firms that were previously in state 
ownership to search for methods of reducing costs and eliminating x-inefficiencies 
for several reasons. If privatization is accompanied by a change in market structure, 
perhaps through the break-up of a previously state-owned monopoly into a number 
of competing units, the resulting competitive pressure may dictate that the newly pri-
vatised firms engage vigorously in the search for cost savings. Increased competition 
may help deliver lower prices, improved product or service quality, and greater choice 
for consumers.
■ Increased capital market discipline. Following privatization, the creation of a tier of 
profit-motivated shareholders may force management to attach higher priority to 
objectives related to profitability. Therefore, pressure from shareholders may also 
motivate the search for methods of reducing costs, through the elimination of bureau-
cracy, waste and inefficiency. In privatised firms, the shareholder is the principal and 
the manager is the agent. Reward and incentive structures can be created to encourage 
managers to perform well.
■ Elimination of government controls. Nationalised enterprises are subject to various con-
trols over their operations or financing, which may be eliminated through privatization.
There are several counter-arguments against privatization. If privatization simply leads 
to the transfer of a monopoly from public to private ownership, with the privatised firm 
free to exploit its market power in pursuit of shareholder profit, then this is likely to 
work against the interests of consumers. On the other hand, if privatization involves the 
break-up of a state-owned monopoly into smaller components, costs might increase if the 
smaller units are unable to realise the full benefits of economies of scale or scope. The use 
of privatization proceeds to finance current government spending or tax cuts can also be 
criticised. The proceeds from the sale of state-owned assets are effectively the capitalised 
value of the future profit flows those assets are expected to yield. There is an element of 
short-termism in the policy of using such windfall gains to finance current expenditure, 
which is likely to lead to a gap appearing in the public finances in future years when no 
further saleable assets remain.
Franchising
Franchising involves contracting out to private contractors (often by means of some 
form of auction) of services that were previously provided from within the public sec-
tor. Franchising is often used in cases where direct competition is deemed impossible or 

716	
|	 24    ■    Competition policy
undesirable. In the UK, examples include local bus services and commercial passenger 
train services. The aim is to increase competition indirectly, by encouraging firms to bid 
competitively for contracts and licences to provide the relevant goods or services.
Franchises can be characterised as ownership or operating. Ownership franchises grant 
the holder control over an asset in perpetuity. Operating franchises grant the holder 
temporary control, for a limited period of time. Both types of franchise shield the holder 
from competition while the franchise is effective, but in the case of an operating franchise 
this benefit is of limited duration. It has been argued that operating franchises discourage 
long-term investment, because the franchise holder is aware of the risk that the franchise 
will not be renewed when it expires.
Once the franchise has been awarded, the franchisor retains an element of control, 
either by threatening that the franchise might not be renewed when it expires or, in 
extreme cases, by retaining the right to revoke the franchise in the event of the franchi-
see’s non-compliance with the terms and conditions. Although the franchisee is shielded 
from competition once the franchise has been awarded, competition during the bidding 
process may be intense. If the franchise is expected to be profit-making, bidders are 
invited to pay to secure the franchise. Conversely, if the franchise is expected to be loss-
making, bidders are invited to state the payment or subsidy they would require to supply 
the product or service.
Price discrimination
As discussed earlier, a monopolist can practise price discrimination in several 
ways (see Section 14.3). Under first-degree (perfect) price discrimination, the 
price per unit of output depends on the identity of the purchaser and on the 
number of units purchased. Under second-degree price discrimination, the price 
per unit of output depends on the number of units purchased, but not on the 
identity of the purchaser. All consumers who buy a particular number of units 
pay the same price per unit. Under third-degree price discrimination, the price per 
unit of output depends on the identity of the purchaser, but not on the number 
of units purchased. Any consumer can buy as many or as few units as he or she 
wishes at the same unit price. In each case, the market for the product must be 
divisible into submarkets, within which there are different demand conditions 
(or different price elasticities of demand). These submarkets must be physically 
separate either in space or time, so that secondary trade or resale between con-
sumers in different submarkets is not possible. For example, according to the 
European Commission (1995), European car manufacturers have practised a 
form of price discrimination that has resulted in large price disparities between 
different countries.
Perhaps surprisingly, however, price discrimination should not always be 
judged pejoratively. The monopolist who adopts a policy of first-degree price 
discrimination earns an even higher abnormal profit than the monopolist who 
charges a uniform price but, on allocative efficiency criteria, the outcome in the

717
former case is preferable. Total output is higher under first-degree price discrimi-
nation than under monopoly with uniform pricing, and in the former case the last 
unit of output produced is sold at a price equivalent to its marginal cost. In the 
less extreme but more realistic cases of second- and third-degree price discrimina-
tion, it is not possible to generalise about the social welfare implications, which 
can be either positive or negative.
Entry barriers and vertical restraints
Various strategies that a monopolist might adopt in an attempt to raise entry 
barriers and deter potential entrants were examined earlier (see Section 12.3). 
These might include limit pricing, predatory pricing and product differentiation 
or brand proliferation. For example, Myers (1994) suggests predatory pricing 
in the deregulated UK bus industry led to a decline in the number of bus opera-
tors. Another example involves a case brought by the European Commission 
against Deutsche Post in 2001, in which the company was alleged to have used its 
monopoly profit from mail delivery to subsidise its prices in the business parcel 
service market, where it was exposed to competition from United Parcel Services 
(UPS). The commission found the company had failed to cover its costs in parcel 
delivery for five years, suggesting a form of predatory pricing.
As shown earlier (see Chapter 20), vertical restraints are conditions and 
restrictions on trade that are imposed by firms that are linked vertically. Principal 
forms of vertical restraint include retail price maintenance, foreclosure, territorial 
exclusivity and quantity dependent pricing (tying or bundling).
Technological progress
According to the Schumpeterian hypothesis, market power and monopoly status 
should be interpreted as the reward for successful innovation (see Section 18.2). 
For a time, the successful innovating firm becomes a monopoly supplier of a new 
product; or its mastery of a new process enables it to produce at a lower cost than 
its rivals, perhaps capturing some or all of their market share by setting a price 
they are unable to match. However, the market power conferred by successful 
innovation is always temporary, because in time the new technology will itself 
be superseded by further technological progress. Successful innovation brings 
benefits to society, in the form of new products or more efficient production 
processes. In the past, the competition authorities have often tended to take a 
benign or favourable view of firms that are perceived to invest heavily in research 
and development.

Elements of competition policy
Competition policy aims to promote competition and control or eliminate abuses 
of market power. More specifically, competition policy may seek to increase 
efficiency, promote innovation, or improve consumer choice.

718	
|	 24    ■    Competition policy
Competition policy has its central economic goal as the preservation 
and promotion of the competitive process, a process which encourages 
efficiency in the production and allocation of goods and services over 
time, through its effects on innovation and adjustment to technological 
change, a dynamic process of sustained economic growth.
(OECD, 1984, para. 232)
The role of competition policy is to ensure that competition is indeed 
effective. To this end, competition policy stops, penalizes and deters 
anti-competitive actions by suppliers. It extends also to the unnecessary 
restrictions on competition stemming from government laws and 
regulation. And a full effective competition policy also embraces 
measures to make markets work more competitively by enhancing the 
power of consumer choice.
(Vickers, 2002, p. 8)
Competition policy deals with three principal areas: monopoly, merger and 
restrictive practices. First, monopoly policy addresses existing monopolies. If a 
firm has sufficient market power, its dominant position may enable it to pursue 
policies detrimental to competition or the wider public interest. The competition 
authorities must weigh this danger against the possible benefits (such as cost sav-
ings through economies of scale) of large-scale operation.
Second, merger policy deals with situations where two or more firms propose a 
merger that may create a dominant position in the market for the newly merged 
entity. Merger policy considers whether the increased concentration of market 
power arising from a merger is in the public interest. For example, the possible 
benefits of rationalization must be weighed against the possible cost in terms of 
potential abuse of market power. Merger policy should not be so restrictive as 
to provide inefficient management with complete protection from the threat of 
being taken over. The threat of merger or takeover can, in some cases, act as a 
spur to managerial efficiency (see Section 19.3).
Third, restrictive practices policy examines cases where a firm or a group of 
firms is involved in restrictive practices of one type or another that may prove 
damaging to competition or the wider public interest. Such practices might 
include price-fixing agreements, predatory pricing and vertical restraints (Pick-
ering, 1982). As shown earlier (see Chapter 8), an agreement to collude might 
be either formal (explicit) or informal (implicit or tacit). Horizontal agreements 
involve firms in the same industry, and are primarily aimed at reducing compe-
tition. Examples include common pricing policies, production quotas, market 
allocation, or sharing information on prices, output and quality. Vertical agree-
ments involve firms operating at successive stages of production or distribution, 
such as exclusive dealing contracts and resale price maintenance.
If companies seek to eliminate or at least to reduce competition between 
themselves, they will normally try to do so by some form of agreement 
or concerted practice; these are classified as horizontal since they are

made by undertakings operating at a similar level, for example as 
manufacturers or retailers. By contrast vertical agreements are those 
where relationships of the parties are complementary, for example when 
a supplier makes a distribution agreement with a dealer or a patent 
owner enters into a licence agreement with a licensee.
(Goyder, 2003, pp. 11–12)
The implementation of monopoly, restrictive practices and merger policy requires 
a practical method for measuring market power. Seller concentration and market 
share measures are the most obvious candidates (see Section 10.4). According 
to Shepherd (1997), abuses of market power are most likely to take place in 
industries with four-firm concentration ratios (CR4) exceeding 60 per cent, and 
the attentions of the competition authorities should be focused on such cases. Of 
course, the market share of an individual firm is also highly relevant as an indica-
tor of market power. As a rule-of-thumb, a firm with a market share exceeding 
30 per cent has at many times been assumed by the UK competition authorities 
to be dominant. However (as shown in Section 12.5) according to the contest-
able markets approach of Baumol et al. (1982), provided entry barriers are not 
insurmountable and markets are contestable, the threat of entry and competition 
constrains the pricing policy of a firm that might appear to have market power 
according to a standard seller concentration measure, perhaps even to the extent 
that only a normal profit can be earned. In assessing the degree of market power, 
it is therefore relevant to ask questions concerning the ease of entry.
In order to assess whether an abuse of market power is taking place, it is first 
necessary to define the extent of the relevant market. Naturally, this decision 
has major implications for the values of the market power indicators mentioned 
above, seller concentration and market share. If a narrow market definition is 
employed, market power may be overstated. Conversely, if a wide market defini-
tion is employed, market power may be understated and genuine abuses might 
not even be investigated. The definition of any market contains both a product 
dimension and a geographic dimension (see Section 10.2). The product market 
definition should include all products that are close substitutes for one another, 
both in consumption and in production. In practice, however, it is not usu-
ally straightforward to decide which products to include within this definition. 
­Budweiser lager might be included in the same market as Stella Artois, but do 
other beers (bitter and real ale) belong in the same product market? Should other 
beverages, such as soft drinks, tea, coffee, wines and spirits, be included? Geo-
graphic market definitions present similar problems. Is the relevant geographic 
market defined at a local, regional, national or international level? The market 
definition should reflect the true competitive situation. If it fails to do so, com-
petition policy decisions will be biased. In practice, the competition authorities in 
the UK and elsewhere tend to rely on a range of market definitions. Exchanges 
between antitrust economists in the US have questioned whether market defini-
tions should be calculated at all (Kaplow, 2010; Werden, 2012).
It is also relevant to note that market definitions are not static, but are subject 
to change over time due to changes in technology or consumer tastes. Therefore, 

720	
|	 24    ■    Competition policy
in some cases it might be appropriate to incorporate a dynamic element into 
market definitions. For example, in 2002, Tetra (a carton packaging firm with a 
world market share of around 80 per cent) sought to merge with Sidel (a plastics 
packaging firm with a world market share of around 60 per cent). While the 
European Commission concluded the relevant markets were separate, it was 
likely they would tend to converge over time. Therefore the proposed merger 
would reduce competition in the long run.
Most economists would recognise that perfect competition is a theoretical 
ideal, which is highly unlikely to prevail in practice (Clark, 1940; Sosnick, 1958; 
Reid, 1987). Therefore, a more realistic objective for competition policy might 
be to foster workable competition. This approach searches for aspects of struc-
ture and conduct that can be adjusted to bring about a favourable performance 
outcome. In other words, competition policy should start from a definition of 
good performance, and aim to bring into being the forms of industry structure 
and conduct that are most likely to produce good performance.
The workable competition approach has several drawbacks. First, the weights 
that should be attached to each dimension of performance are not specified. 
Second, any definition of favourable performance is subjective to some extent. 
There is scope for disagreement as to the appropriate criteria for the implementa-
tion of competition policy based on the concept of workable competition. Stigler 
(1968) criticises the workable competition approach for its serious ambiguity. 
According to the Austrian school, ‘departures from the optimality conditions 
of perfectly competitive equilibrium are not a threat to any relevant notion of 
economic efficiency. Equilibrium is not an attainable ideal, nor are perfect or 
‘near perfect’ competition attainable’ (Kirzner, 1997b, p. 59).
	
24.4	
Implementation of competition policy
The United States
The modern framework for antitrust or competition law in the US was estab-
lished by the Sherman Act 1890, the Clayton Act 1914 and the Federal Trade 
Commission Act 1914. These pieces of legislation codified previous American 
and English common law concerning restraint of trade. The term antitrust origi-
nated in the formation by US corporations in the late nineteenth century of 
trusts to conceal the nature of their restrictive practices. Section 1 of the Sherman 
Act prohibits restraints on trade in the form of ‘contracts, combinations and 
conspiracies’. Section 2 of the Act deals with monopolies, monopolization and 
conspiracies to monopolise. The Act prescribes criminal penalties in the form of 
fines or imprisonment for violators.
Enforcement of the Sherman Act was patchy during the years immediately 
following its enactment. However, US Supreme Court rulings in 1911 against 
two major trusts, Standard Oil and American Tobacco, signalled the introduc-
tion of a tougher approach. The Standard Oil case is perhaps the most famous 
in the history of US antitrust policy. Formed in Ohio in 1870 by the industrial-
ist John D. Rockefeller with partners including his brother William, Standard

721
Oil rapidly achieved a position of dominance in the embryonic US oil industry 
through a series of questionable business practices. By 1890 Standard Oil con-
trolled 88 per cent of refined oil flows in the US. Although its market share had 
fallen to 64 per cent by 1911, the Supreme Court declared Standard Oil to be an 
unreasonable monopoly. It was adjudged guilty of a number of forms of unfair 
practice, including predatory pricing through localised price-cutting, and vertical 
restraints achieved through acquisitions of distribution networks (pipelines and 
railroads). The Court ordered the break-up of Standard Oil into 34 independent 
companies, several of which themselves became dominant players in the global oil 
industry throughout the twentieth century and beyond. For example, Standard 
Oil Company of New Jersey eventually became Exxon, Standard Oil Company 
of New York became Mobil, and Standard Oil of California became Chevron.
Shortly after the Standard Oil case, the Supreme Court passed a similar verdict 
against American Tobacco, which had engaged in even more aggressive preda-
tory pricing practices than Standard Oil in its campaign to control the market for 
chewing tobacco. In the 1911 Standard Oil case the Supreme Court also developed 
the rule of reason doctrine which specified that only monopolies and contracts 
which restrained trade unreasonably were subject to action under the Sherman 
Act. The possession of monopoly or market power was not illegal in itself.
The Sherman Act covers monopoly, price-fixing and other forms of restric-
tive practice on the part of independent firms, but it does not provide for the 
scrutiny or prohibition of mergers. Therefore, independent firms wishing to 
collude had the option of merging in order to place themselves beyond the 
reach of the legislation. The Clayton Act extended antitrust policy to cover 
mergers that were deemed capable of damaging competition, and introduced 
provisions covering a number of other forms of restrictive practice that were 
originally excluded from the Sherman Act. These included price discrimina-
tion in cases where the effect is a reduction in competition or the creation 
of a monopoly, exclusive dealings and tying, and interlocking directorships 
in competing companies. The Federal Trade Commission Act established the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as the agency charged with enforcement of 
the Clayton Act. The FTC was awarded powers to intervene in a wide range 
of situations involving very broadly defined ‘unfair methods of competition’. 
Both the FTC and the US Department of Justice can initiate actions under the 
US antitrust legislation. Most cases are precipitated by a complaint from a 
competitor, a report in the press or a report from a government agency.
The legislative framework for US antitrust policy that was established in the 
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries has remained intact subsequently, 
subject to modifications such as the Robinson-Patman Act 1936, which extended 
the provisions for dealing with price discrimination; and the Celler-Kefauver Act 
1950, which extended the coverage of the Clayton Act to mergers involving the 
acquisition of assets, as well as those involving stock acquisition. However, the 
interpretation and strength of enforcement has varied over time with political 
and intellectual trends, and with changes to the structure of the economy. For 
example, by acquitting US Steel of conspiring to fix prices in a case brought in 
1920, the Supreme Court established a precedent that considerably weakened the 
interpretation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act for the next 25 years. US Steel had 

722	
|	 24    ■    Competition policy
been charged with cooperating with its competitors through trade meetings and 
the notorious ‘dinners’ hosted by Judge Elbert Gary, the company president, at 
which discussions took place with competitors over matters related to pricing. 
The Supreme Court ruled that because US Steel needed to cooperate with its 
competitors, it could not be held to constitute a monopoly.
A further landmark ruling came with the Alcoa case of 1945, in which the Alu-
minum Company of America (Alcoa) was charged with monopolizing the market 
for aluminium ingots. Issues of market definition were key to the outcome of the 
Alcoa case. The District Court, which had originally acquitted Alcoa, defined 
the company’s market share in 1937 as 33 per cent, by including secondary ingot 
(produced from scrap aluminium) in the same market as primary ingot. How-
ever, the New York Court of Appeals, which overturned the District Court’s 
ruling, ruled that Alcoa’s dominance of primary ingot production gave it indirect 
control over the market for secondary ingots, and an overall market share in 1937 
of 90 per cent. Although there was little evidence of predatory pricing or other 
aggressive anticompetitive practice on the part of Alcoa (in contrast to Standard 
Oil and American Tobacco), the Court of Appeal ruled that an overwhelming 
market share was in itself a violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, unless 
there were economies of scale such that the industry would take the form of a 
natural monopoly.
The Alcoa case signalled the onset of a relatively stringent and aggressive 
phase in the implementation of antitrust policy in the US, which continued from 
the mid-1940s until the mid- to late 1970s. Several academic economists and 
lawyers connected to the Chicago school became increasingly vocal in their criti-
cism of the interventionist nature of antitrust policy during this phase, arguing 
that there was a tendency for the implementation of policy to be biased towards 
favouring certain groups and harming others, and therefore subject to influ-
ence through political lobbying. Others argued that the potential efficiency gains 
associated with large-scale and vertical integration should carry greater weight 
in determining the outcome of merger cases brought under the antitrust legisla-
tion. As US manufacturers struggled to maintain competitiveness in world export 
markets during the 1970s, this efficiency argument attracted increasing levels of 
sympathy. At the start of the 1980s, the incoming administration of President 
Ronald Reagan was highly receptive to the anti-interventionist economic phi-
losophy of the Chicago school.
During the 1980s and 1990s, a less interventionist and more ‘hands-off’ 
approach to antitrust policy was informed by the view that market forces should 
be allowed to select the most efficient firms, unless there were compelling rea-
sons otherwise. It became more difficult to secure a judgment against a firm 
on antitrust grounds, especially in cases involving monopolization or vertical 
restraints. In 1977, a total of 1,611 private antitrust cases were filed in the US 
District Courts, but by 1989 this total had fallen to 638 (Motta, 2004). More 
recently, there have been signs of a partial reversion towards a more stringent 
and interventionist approach once again, with the current approach having been 
characterised as lying ‘somewhere between the interventionism of the 60s and 
the laissez-faire of the 80s’ (Motta, 2004, p. 9). An important development in 
the prosecution of cases involving cartels or other forms of collusion during the

2000s has been the imposition by the courts of lengthy prison sentences in several 
high-profile cases, and an increased willingness to enter into plea bargaining or 
grant amnesties to whistle-blowers.
The European Union
During the first half of the twentieth century, the authorities in many European 
countries took a more tolerant view of monopoly and restrictive practices than 
those in the US. Although competition was seen as desirable, considerations of 
scale and efficiency often took precedence. In countries such as France, Germany 
and the UK, the suspicions of Americans concerning big business and collusion 
were often felt to be overblown, and incompatible with their own national insti-
tutions and traditions. Since the Second World War, however, there has been a 
progressive strengthening of antitrust legislation throughout Europe. Although 
some important differences remain between the American and European mod-
els, in many respects European provision has converged towards the American 
model. Ironically, by the start of the twenty-first century the European approach 
could be characterised as more stringent than that of the US in some respects. 
Many European governments were instinctively hostile towards the laissez-faire, 
non-interventionist approach that had been influential or dominant in the US 
since the 1980s. They were also sceptical of the view that market forces should 
be allowed to select the most efficient firms unless there were compelling reasons 
to the contrary.
The stated objective of EU competition policy is the promotion of competi-
tion within the European Single Market. The cornerstones of EU competition 
policy are Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which was concluded in 
2007 and came into force in early 2009. These articles incorporate Articles 85 and 
86 of the earlier Treaty of Rome. In accordance with the principle of subsidiar-
ity, the scope of Articles 101 and 10 is confined to firms based in EU member 
states that trade in other EU states. These articles do not apply to the activities 
of domestic firms trading within the domestic market. Cases are investigated 
and the articles are enforced by the Competition Directorate-General IV, which 
has the power to fine companies up to 10 per cent of their annual worldwide 
turnover. The Directorate-General IV Leniency programme offers reductions 
in fines of between 10 per cent and 100 per cent for cooperation or provision of 
information relating to violations of Article 101.
Article 101 deals with restrictive practices, prohibiting agreements between 
firms from EU member states that prevent or restrict competition. The prohibi-
tion covers both horizontal and vertical agreements. For example, agreements 
to fix prices, production quotas or to share markets are all deemed illegal. How-
ever, exemptions are available if it can be shown the benefits outweigh the costs 
to consumers. For example, an agreement might be exempt if it led to higher 
production, resulting in economies of scale, improvements in efficiency in dis-
tribution, or technological progress, with consumers ultimately benefiting from 
lower prices or improvements in quality. Block exemptions are also available, 
typically with respect to vertical agreements between firms at different stages of 
the supply chain, in cases where the parties involved do not exercise significant 

724	
|	 24    ■    Competition policy
market power. For example, it is accepted that agreements between a manu-
facturer and a distributor do not necessarily reduce competition. At the end of 
2000, a block exemption covering distribution agreements permitted agreements 
between firms at different stages of the supply chain, as long as the seller (buyer) 
does not account for at least 30 per cent of the relevant seller (buyer) market. 
Agreements covering market partitioning, price fixing and resale price mainte-
nance remain illegal.
Article 102 regulates possible abuses of monopoly power, such as monopoly 
pricing, predatory pricing and price discrimination. An individual firm occu-
pies a dominant position if it can prevent competition, behave independently 
of competitors, and exercise control over production and prices. In practice, an 
investigation is triggered if a single firm has a 40 per cent share of the relevant 
market. Price-fixing, the restriction of production or technical development to 
the detriment of consumers, a refusal to trade with certain customers, and the 
imposition of unfair terms or restrictions are recognised forms of abuse of a 
dominant position. A landmark case in 1978 involved the prices charged for 
bananas by the United Brands company to distributors in EU countries. Higher 
prices charged to distributors in Denmark and Germany than to those in Ireland, 
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were found to be unjustifiable on 
criteria such as cost or risk. In contrast to Article 101, there are no provisions for 
exemptions from Article 102. In 2014, a new Directive (2014/104/EU) on Anti-
trust Damages came into force. This Directive allows for individuals and firms 
to claim and receive compensation for any detriment caused by cartel agreements 
or other abuses of dominant market positions. Figure 24.2 shows the number of 
cartel and antitrust decisions over the period 2005–14.
Mergers are regulated by Regulation 139/2004, which came into force in May 
2004, covering mergers, acquisitions and joint mergers. A horizontal merger

qualifies for investigation if it has a fundamental effect on competition within 
the EU. Regulation 139/2004 is intended to streamline and improve the trans-
parency of merger investigations. It contains guidelines for the assessment of 
mergers based on economic indicators, and guidelines for firms concerning 
their rights in the event of a merger being disallowed. The Merger Task Force, 
which previously had responsibility for investigating proposed mergers, was 
disbanded.
Lyons (2003) suggests that these changes were motivated by increased 
recognition of the usefulness of economic analysis in informing competition 
policy, and a need to streamline procedures following the accession of ten new 
member states to the EU in May 2004. Lyons cites three successful appeals 
(Airtours/First Choice; Schneider/Le Grand; and Tetra/Sidel) against deci-
sions taken under the pre-2004 arrangements. In each case the Merger Task 
Force was criticised for using inappropriate economic theory, failing to take 
account of changing industry conditions and misinterpreting documentary 
evidence.
Notification of any merger should be made to Competition Directorate-
General IV not more than one week after a bid is placed or a deal announced. 
Failure to notify may result in a fine. The Directorate reviews any proposed 
merger in two phases. Phase I, the initial investigation, is completed within one 
month, and may or may not trigger a more detailed Phase II investigation. Phase 
II, which is normally completed within four months, examines the implications 
of the proposed merger for competition (based on the dominance test) and the 
single market. The investigation invites views and written submissions from 
customers, suppliers and competitors. The Directorate-General IV takes the 
final decision as to whether an investigation takes place and whether a merger 
is permitted to proceed. Figure 24.3 shows the number of merger decisions over 
the period 2005–14.
Most merger investigations weigh the implications for competition and the 
single market against any possible benefits, which might include scale economies 
or technological advances. It is unusual for a merger to be allowed to proceed if it 
creates or strengthens a dominant position. However, any investigation will take 
account of the extent to which buyer power acts as a countervailing force against 
the competitive dominance brought about by the proposed merger. If a merger 
is disallowed, the parties involved can appeal to the Court of First Instance and, 
ultimately, to the European Court of Justice.
Control over state aid is a further important strand of EU competition policy, 
regulated by Article 107 of the Treaty of Lisbon. Article 107 establishes a member 
state’s right to deliver public services, but requires that public service providers 
should otherwise be subject to the same rules on collusion and abuses of market 
power as firms in the private sector. The Article specifies rules precluding the 
deployment of state aid or subsidies in a manner that distorts competition, but 
also grants exemptions in a number of cases where state intervention is necessary 
to maintain the smooth functioning of the economy. For example, aid targeted 
at research and development, the promotion of SMEs, and regional economic 
development is normally permitted. EU rules on state aid control permit a failing 
company to be rescued once subject to approval, which requires the articulation

developments reported in the 2014 edition of the European Commission’s (2015) 
annual Report on Competition Policy.
Energy
Energy is an essential input to all economic sectors, and a significant 
item of expenditure for EU households. Energy markets are currently 
facing very significant challenges: incomplete market integration, high 
retail prices, decarbonisation and security of supply are among the most 
important. In his Political Guidelines, President Juncker called for a 
reform and reorganization of EU energy policy into a new European 
Energy Union, focusing on the need to diversify EU energy sources, 
strengthen the share of renewables, enhance energy efficiency and reduce 
the energy dependency of several EU countries. Competition policy will 
contribute towards achieving those goals.
Financial services
Competition enforcement in the financial services sector has been a 
Commission top priority since the onset of the crisis. A great deal of 
work has been done to improve bank regulation and supervision, and to 
ensure that the banking sector functions correctly in providing finance 
for economic activities. Competition policy is playing a central role in 
achieving a more transparent and stable financial system.
To address the challenge of restoring financial stability in the euro 
area, in 2012 the Commission launched the Banking Union. State 
aid control continued to secure a consistent policy response to the 
financial challenges, significantly contributing to limiting distortions of 
competition within the Single Market, while at the same time reducing 
the use of taxpayers’ money to the minimum necessary.
In October the Commission adopted two important cartel decisions 
concerning interest rate derivatives in the Swiss franc. One decision 
concerned two banks, RBS and JP Morgan, participating in an illegal 
bilateral cartel aimed at influencing the Swiss franc Libor benchmark 
interest rate between March 2008 and July 2009. The Commission 
imposed fines totalling almost EUR 62 million. In the other decision, 
RBS, UBS, JP Morgan and Crédit Suisse were fined a total of EUR 32 
million for operating a cartel on bid-ask spreads of Swiss franc interest 
rate derivatives in the European Economic Area. In both cases, the banks 
agreed to settle with the Commission. The Commission had adopted 
two more cartel decisions related to the manipulation of financial 
benchmarks in 2013.
Broadband and telecoms networks
The Commission also ensures that broadband and mobile networks 
remain open and competitive, a sine qua non for building a vibrant 
Digital Single Market. After an in-depth investigation, in October the 
Commission imposed a fine close to EUR 39 million jointly and severally 
on Slovak Telekom and its parent company, Deutsche Telekom, for 

728	
|	 24    ■    Competition policy
having pursued during more than five years an abusive strategy to shut 
out competitors from the Slovak market for broadband services, in 
breach of EU antitrust rules. In particular, the Commission concluded 
that Slovak Telekom refused to supply unbundled access to its local 
loops to competitors, and imposed a margin squeeze on alternative 
operators. Deutsche Telekom also received an additional fine of EUR 31 
million to ensure sufficient deterrence as well as to punish for its repeated 
abusive behaviour (recidivism), as it had already been fined in 2003 for a 
margin squeeze in broadband markets in Germany.
Healthy competition in the mobile telecoms market is especially 
important for European consumers, who should continue to benefit from 
improved services at attractive prices. In summer 2014, the Commission 
conditionally approved two mergers between mobile network operators 
in Ireland (Hutchison 3G UK/Telefónica Ireland) and Germany 
(Telefónica Deutschland/E-Plus)10, following in-depth investigations. 
The remedies in these cases ensured that competition between market 
players is maintained, both through market entry or expansion of 
so-called mobile virtual network operators – that is operators that do 
not own a network but use the network of another operator to provide 
services to their customers – and by keeping the door open for a new 
network operator to enter the market in the future.
Smart Devices and Online Services
Smart mobile devices are becoming increasingly important within the 
digital economy. In 2014 for the first time more users have accessed 
the internet through a smart mobile device than through a PC. In this 
area, the Commission has launched a preliminary investigation 
regarding Google’s business practices with regard to the Android mobile 
operating system, based on complaints about potential abuses of a 
dominant position. Google’s Android is the leading operating system for 
smartphones.
In October, the Commission authorised, under the EU Merger 
Regulation, the proposed acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook. 
Facebook (via Facebook Messenger) and WhatsApp both offer 
applications for smartphones which allow consumers to communicate 
by sending text, photos, voice and video messages. The merger was 
approved without conditions, in particular in light of the dynamic nature 
of the market, low entry barriers and sufficient remaining competition. 
The Commission’s investigation focused on three areas: consumer 
communications services, social networking services, and online 
advertising services.
The United Kingdom
Before 1998 in the UK, regulation of monopoly and the scrutiny of merger propos-
als was the responsibility of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), 
originally established in 1948 and reconstituted in 1965. Restrictive practices were

policed by the Restrictive Practices Court (RPC), originally established in 1956. 
The Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise Act 2002 are the two principal 
pieces of legislation that established the current framework for the conduct of 
competition policy in the UK. The Competition Act of 1998 rationalised and 
consolidated competition policy, bringing it into line with EU norms. The Act 
dissolved the Restrictive Practices Court, and set up a new Competition Commis-
sion to take over the responsibilities of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. 
Competition policy in the UK then became the responsibility of the Office of 
Fair Trading (OFT) and the Competition Commission (with the OFT investigat-
ing complaints of anticompetitive practices and, if these complaints were upheld, 
referring the findings to the Competition Commission. In May 2012, the UK 
Government’s Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill created a new Competition 
and Markets Authority, which consolidated the Competition Commission and 
the Office of Fair Trading into a single regulatory authority. Since April 2014, 
the Competition and Markets Authority has been responsible for investigation of 
anticompetitive practice, and enforcement of the Competition Act.
The Competition Act consists of two main components, known as chapter 
prohibitions. The Chapter I prohibition deals with anticompetitive (restrictive) 
practices, and the Chapter II prohibition deals with abuses of dominant (or 
monopoly) positions. Both chapters are concerned with promoting competition. 
Section 60 requires the enforcement of the Act and any investigations to be con-
sistent with EU competition policy.
The Chapter I prohibition applies to (formal and informal) agreements 
between firms which prevent, distort or otherwise affect trade within the UK. 
Agreements which fall under the remit of the act include the following:
■ agreements to fix buying or selling prices;
■ agreements to share markets;
■ agreements to limit production;
■ agreements relating to collusive tendering;
■ agreements involving the sharing of information.
Exemptions can be granted if the agreement improves the production or dis-
tribution of goods and services, or promotes technological progress, leading to 
substantial benefits for consumers.
The Chapter I prohibition is closely related to Article 101 of the EU’s Treaty 
of Lisbon. In cases of investigative overlap under the terms of Chapter I and the 
equivalent Article 101, the Competition Directorate-General IV takes charge of 
the investigation. An exemption granted under Article 101 automatically implies 
a parallel exemption from the Chapter I prohibition. However, an exemption 
from the Chapter I prohibition does not automatically lead to an exemption 
from Article 101.
The Chapter II prohibition is based on Article 102 of the Treaty of Lisbon, 
and deals with the possible abuse of market power by monopolies. The investi-
gation of a dominant position comprises a two-stage test, to assess whether the 
firm is dominant in the relevant market and, if so, whether the firm is abusing its 

730	
|	 24    ■    Competition policy
position. Practices that constitute abuse include charging an excessive price, price 
discrimination, various forms of predatory competition, vertical restraints and 
refusals to supply. For example, in 2001 Napp Pharmaceuticals was fined £3.2m 
for overcharging NHS hospitals and pharmacies for the supply of morphine. 
Napp was convicted of charging between 33 per cent and 67 per cent more than 
other firms that were selling similar products in other markets. Section 36 of the 
Act specifies the penalties for violation of either of the chapter prohibitions. The 
maximum penalty is 10 per cent of annual turnover for each year that the viola-
tion takes place, up to a maximum of three years.
The Enterprise Act 2002 strengthened the regulatory framework for UK com-
petition policy. The Act established the OFT as a legal entity, and provided 
guidelines with respect to the OFT’s day-to-day running, investigative pow-
ers, and operating and reporting procedures. The Act sought to improve the 
use of quantitative and qualitative analysis in reaching expert and independent 
decisions.
The Act also introduced a new merger policy which is based on economic 
analysis of the likely effects on competition (via the substantial lessening of 
competition (SLC) test), rather than vague public interest concerns. In cases of 
disallowed mergers, firms have the right to appeal to the Competition Appeals 
Tribunal (CAT). The process of investigation and enforcement has been made 
more transparent, in line with EU practice. The Act also strengthened the punish-
ment regime for managers convicted of anticompetitive practice. Harsh penalties 
(up to five years’ imprisonment) can be imposed on managers found guilty of 
price fixing and related offences.

Brussels moving towards blocking  
Three-O2 deal
FT
Antitrust regulators in Brussels are moving towards blocking CK Hutchison’s £10.5bn 
deal to acquire O2, Telefonica’s British mobile business, unless additional concessions are 
offered. Two people close to the discussions said a draft decision by Europe’s antitrust 
watchdog to stop the deal is likely, in a regulatory test case that could send shockwaves 
through the continent’s telecoms industry. The news comes days after the UK’s Competi-
tion and Markets Authority urged Brussels to block the acquisition. The move followed 
similar protests by Ofcom, Britain’s telecoms regulator, which has come out against the 
merger. One person close to the deal described the CMA’s intervention as helpful and in 
line with thinking in Brussels.
Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, said on Wednesday that she 
would take account of resistance in Britain. UK regulators fear the proposed merger 
of O2 with Hutchison’s Three could harm consumers by reducing competition and lead 
to increased prices. ‘They work the same way as we do, so of course I take due note of

Fresh blow for OnTheMarket as watchdog  
warns agents on collusion
FT
Challenger property portal OnTheMarket faces a further blow after the competition regu-
lator warned estate agents against colluding to join the site and remove their business 
from the two market leaders, Rightmove and Zoopla. The Competition and Markets 
Authority has written to agents to highlight that such behaviour could result in ‘signifi-
cant fines’.
OnTheMarket was set up last year by a consortium of estate agents including well-
known names such as Savills and Knight Frank, aiming to reduce the power of Right-
move and Zoopla to set fees by allowing members to sign up to only one of the other 
major portals. It has succeeded in attracting 6,000 agents, but remains less well-known 
than its two longer-established rivals, and also faces a potential mutiny from about 200 
agents seeking to leave because of concerns over its service and contractual issues. Right-
move is currently used by 19,700 agents and Zoopla by 16,700.
The CMA said on Thursday that agents had been unlawfully making joint decisions on 
what portals to use. It has written individually to agents suspected of collusion but also 
published an open letter to all estate agents on the issue. ‘Estate agents in some local areas 
may have made a collective decision to join the OnTheMarket portal and, at the same 
time, to remove their business from other portals that compete with OnTheMarket,’ the 
CMA said. ‘This kind of conduct may break competition law and . . . agents engaging in 
what the regulators and the competition authority has said in this case,’ Ms Vestager 
said, although she stressed that a final decision had not been taken. British competition 
officials want Hutchison to carve off part of its business to create a fourth mobile opera-
tor to replace O2, a view which has support within the commission.
However, there are still several weeks before a decision is due to be brought in front 
of the college of 28 EU commissioners. The company could still make further conces-
sions to address the concerns. The heavy lobbying by Ofcom and the CMA has provided 
European regulators with political cover to deflect any anger caused by Brussels mak-
ing a decision on the UK market just months before a British referendum on staying in 
the EU. A decision to scupper the deal would also mean a period of uncertainty for the 
British mobile market. Hutchison is expected to appeal any block. This could take as 
much as a year.

it could therefore face significant fines,’ it said, adding that the most serious competition 
offences could result in prison sentences. The CMA added that it had ‘no reason to write 
to OnTheMarket in this connection at this time’.

Regulator takes action on fake online reviews
FT
An online marketing company that posted more than 800 fake reviews for small Brit-
ish businesses has been ordered to take them down in the first enforcement action of its 
kind by the competition regulator. Total SEO & Marketing, a search engine optimisa-
tion specialist, wrote positive reviews for 86 businesses, including car dealers, mechanics 
and landscape gardeners, according to an investigation by the Competition and Markets 
Authority. Nisha Arora, a senior director at the CMA, said: ‘With more than half of 
people in the UK using online reviews to help them choose what to buy, they are becom-
ing an increasingly valuable source of information. Fake reviews can lead to people mak-
ing the wrong decisions and businesses losing out.’
The CMA said it has obtained a signed undertaking from Total SEO that the Dorking-
based company would stop writing fake reviews and remove those that it had already 
posted on 26 websites. The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 
contain a specific prohibition on businesses falsely representing themselves as consumers. 
These regulations are enforceable through both the civil and criminal courts, potentially 
leading to a fine for a company or a prison sentence for its directors.
The CMA opened an investigation last year into a number of companies that it sus-
pected of writing fake positive reviews about themselves to boost their ratings on review 
sites. It has also been investigating businesses that write fake negative reviews to under-
mine their rivals. The regulator has estimated that as much as £23bn a year of consumer 
spending is open to the influence of online reviews on websites such as TripAdvisor, 
Amazon and Checkatrade.

Evaluation of UK and EU competition policy
For most of the post-war period, the policy approach of the UK authorities 
towards the regulation of monopoly and merger has been relatively cautious, and 
has been implemented on a case-by-case basis. The question posed by regulators 
is not whether a firm has monopoly power, but whether or not this power is used 
in a way that is detrimental to the wider public interest. In contrast, the approach 
taken towards the regulation of restrictive practices has usually been more strin-
gent in principle, although it has encountered difficulties in its execution.
It seems likely that tacit forms of collusion have been widespread, and difficult 
for the authorities to uncover (Rees, 1993a,b). For most of the post-war period, 
the risk of detection was small and penalties in the event of detection were light 
(Utton, 2000). For example, prior to the Competition Act 1998, there were no 
fines for first offenders: ‘it is as though the police having captured a bank robber 
red-handed, inform him that he has broken the law and should not do it again, 
but then let him go with the fruits of his crime’ (Williams, 1993, cited in Utton, 
2000, p. 276).

Wedding venues ‘must play fair’ on charges – CMA
FT
Wedding venues must ‘play fair’ when it comes to charging couples in the unfortunate 
event that they have to cancel their big day, according to the UK’s competition authority. 
The Competition and Markets Authority has sent out letters to more than 100 wedding 
and event venues warning that requiring couples to pay large deposits upfront and hefty 
cancellation charges could potentially breach consumer law. In one of the CMA’s more 
unusual interventions in recent times, the CMA says: With costs for hiring venues often 
running into thousands of pounds, potentially unfair cancellation terms can result in 
considerable loss to consumers, particularly when they have to pay significant sums up-
front which they lose if they have to cancel or change their plans.
The CMA is reminding that a deposit serves to reserve goods or services and should 
be no more than a ‘small’ percentage of the overall cost of a wedding or other event. Any 
advance payments should only reflect the business’ expenses and customers should still 
have a ‘reasonable amount’ still to pay when those services have been received. In all 
circumstances, says the CMA, customers must not lose large advance payments if they 
have to cancel.
Nisha Arora, a senior director at the CMA said: ‘Planning a wedding or any large event 
can be stressful. Consumers are particularly vulnerable when they are focusing on prepar-
ing for a special event and have paid significant sums up-front. Businesses need to treat 
their customers fairly and should not require unjustifiable, non-refundable deposits or 
impose unreasonable cancellation charges, which could mean customers lose a significant 
amount of money if they change their mind about the venue or have to call off the event.’

|	 24    ■    Competition policy
In an extensive evaluation of the pre-1998 competition policy arrangements 
in the UK, Davies et al. (1999) investigate the determinants of MMC decisions 
against monopolies. The MMC ruled against roughly two-thirds of the 73 cases 
examined in the study. Of these cases, 36 referred to pricing issues (monopoly 
pricing, predatory pricing and collusion), and 37 referred to vertical restraints 
(vertical integration, resale price maintenance, tie-in sales, exclusivity in distribu-
tion and purchasing). Among the cases where the MMC ruled against the firms, 
recommendations included the termination of a restrictive practice (34 cases), 
price controls (nine cases) and divestment of assets (nine cases).
Davies et al. use a statistical model to identify the factors most likely to 
influence the probability of the MMC ruling against a firm or group of firms. 
Explanatory variables include indicators of market structure such as concentra-
tion, rates of entry and market shares; indicators of conduct covering areas such 
as vertical integration, exclusive purchasing, exclusive distribution, monopoly, 
predatory pricing, price discrimination and collusion; and variables to allow for 
changes in the MMC’s decisions over time, and to identify whether or not the 
investigation was a repeat referral. The estimated model suggests the greater 
the market share of the biggest firm in the industry, the more likely it was that 
the MMC would rule against the monopoly practice. The MMC was more likely 
to rule against in cases involving exclusive dealing, but less likely to do so in cases 
involving vertical restraints. The MMC was more likely to rule against in the 
1970s and 1980s than in the 1990s.
It is often easier to prevent an increase in seller concentration by preventing a 
merger before it takes place than by breaking up an incumbent firm that already 
occupies a dominant position. Weir (1992, 1993) analyses MMC decisions on 
referred mergers using a sample of 73 published reports covering the period 1974–
90. The sample is split into two groups: cases where the MMC thought the merger 
would reduce competition; and cases where the MMC thought the merger would 
have no effect on competition. Regression analysis is used to identify the factors 
that influence the judgment as to whether a merger was in the public interest. Fac-
tors investigated include the effects of the merger on prices, market shares, profits, 
product quality, efficiency, research and development expenditure and the UK 
balance of payments. The analysis distinguishes between horizontal, vertical and 
conglomerate mergers. Unsurprisingly, mergers were more likely to be permitted 
in cases where the MMC thought competition would increase. Expectations of 
lower prices, cost savings, increased expenditure on research and development, or 
a benefit to the balance of payments increased the likelihood of a positive verdict.
In 2001, the DTI commissioned Price Waterhouse to carry out an assessment 
of UK competition policy, in comparison with other EU and OECD countries 
including the US, Germany, Australia, France, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, 
Spain, Sweden and Switzerland (Department of Trade and Industry, 2001). 
Experts (including senior officials from competition authorities, multinational 
companies, competition lawyers, academic economists and representatives of 
consumer bodies) were asked to assess a number of factors relating to the effec-
tiveness of competition policy, including the following:
■ clarity of policy objectives;
■ competence of economic and legal analysis;

	
	
	
24.4  Implementation of competition policy	 |	
735
■ political independence;
■ quality of leadership within competition authorities;
■ transparency of procedures;
■ communication with the general public.
The experts were also invited to suggest improvements to the UK’s arrange-
ments. Each country was assigned a score relative to an EU benchmark. The 
UK was deemed to have a competition policy regime less effective than the US 
and Germany, but more effective than the average for the other OECD countries 
included in the study. The UK was praised for its economic analysis, transpar-
ency of procedures and speed of decision-making in investigations of monopo-
lies. However, relative to the EU, UK merger policy was criticised as being less 
politically independent, providing a lower quality of legal analysis, and slower 
in taking decisions. The report suggested abandoning the vague notion of public 
interest in favour of a competition-based test for the assessment of proposed 
mergers. Follow-up reports (DTI, 2004, 2007) indicate UK merger policy has 
improved relative to the EU since 2001. This may be partly as a consequence of 
difficulties experienced by the EU, in the form of successful appeals by the firms 
involved in several high-profile merger cases (Lyons, 2003). While UK monop-
oly policy was rated as strong, policy towards cartels still lacks some clarity, 
although the introduction of the Competition Appeals Tribunal has improved 
transparency. Further simplification of procedures and speeding up decisions 
would improve the performance of the competition regime further.
A report commissioned by the OFT (2007) examines the extent to which UK 
competition policy arrangements deterred anticompetitive behaviour. Face-to-
face and telephone interviews with lawyers, economists and company executives 
were used to ascertain the extent to which OFT scrutiny constrained behaviour. 
Merger proposals were less likely to proceed if there had been a recent Competi-
tion Commission (CC) inquiry into the sector concerned. Lawyers and econo-
mists perceived that infringement rulings under the Competition Act concerning 
anticompetitive practices had a greater deterrent effect on firms operating in the 
same sector as the subject of the ruling, than on firms operating in other sectors. 
However, company executives did not share this perception.
Davies (2010) conducts an in-depth analysis to examine impact estimation 
methodologies utilised by UK competition authorities. He concludes ‘no other 
Competition Authority worldwide takes impact estimation more seriously’ and 
‘much of OFT’s work in this area is well-founded in up-to-date appropriate 
academic literatures’ (Davies, 2010, p. 37).
Overall, the UK’s 1998 and 2002 legislation, together with the stricter provi-
sions that are effective at EU level, has strengthened the UK’s competition policy 
regime significantly. Emphasis is placed on serving the needs of consumers and 
enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of UK industry. OFT (2007) 
recommends further improvement through increased publicity and education, 
faster decision-taking and an increased willingness to initiate criminal prosecu-
tions in cases involving cartels.
At EU level, a study by the EU Directorate-General for Competition (2005) 
examines the types of remedy imposed if competition was deemed to be restricted. 

736	
|	 24    ■    Competition policy
Of the 96 remedies examined, 80 per cent were within an industry (horizontal 
competition concerns, such as monopoly pricing). Fourteen per cent of remedies 
involved a combination of both within and across industry (vertical concerns 
such as foreclosure), and 6 per cent involved pure vertical concerns. Resolution 
of horizontal, and the combination of horizontal and vertical concerns, was most 
commonly achieved through a transfer of market share. Vertical concerns were 
often addressed by commitments to grant access to suppliers or networks.
Several studies have presented statistical analyses of the regulatory treatment 
of merger proposals at EU level. For example, Bergman et al. (2005) examine 
the factors that influence the probability of an in-depth investigation of a merger 
proposal taking place, and the probability that the merger is prohibited. These 
probabilities increase when the market shares are high and when entry barriers are 
high. No significant evidence of political interference is found. Similarly, Bougette 
and Turolla (2006) find the market power, size and sectoral affiliation of the 
acquiring firm are all significant factors in determining whether an in-depth inves-
tigation of a proposed merger takes place. Aktas et al. (2007) find there is a higher 
probability of intervention in merger proposals where the bidding firm is foreign, 
lending some support to the allegation that EU merger policy is protectionist.
Duso et al. (2007) assess whether the stock market anticipated that merger 
proposals would be pro-competitive (indicated by a decline in rival firms’ share 
prices) or anticompetitive (indicated by an increase in rival firms’ share prices). 
Mergers the stock market identified as pro-competitive that were prohibited or 
had remedies imposed are classed as Type I errors; and mergers identified as 
anticompetitive that were allowed to proceed are classed as Type II errors. Of 
167 merger proposals examined in the study, 28 per cent resulted in Type I errors 
and 23 per cent resulted in Type II errors. The pattern is partially explained by 
country and industry effects. Later studies (which followed the 2004 reforms to 
the EU merger control rules) by Serdarević and Teplý (2011) and Duso et al. 
(2013) found a reduction in the number of Type I and Type II errors.
Clougherty and Duso (2009) assess the stock market reaction to a large sample 
of horizontal mergers that occurred within the 1990–2002 period. The study 
find that the share prices of rival firms increase following a merger involving a 
competing firm, implying a decline in competition.
Aguzzoni et al. (2013) report an event study of the effects of antitrust inves-
tigations on the share prices of firms infringing EU competition law, focussing 
on the effects of surprise raids on firm premises and court decisions on firm 
share prices. Surprise raids and guilty verdicts in court cases have a significantly 
negative effect on the affected firms’ share prices. In contrast, court decisions 
annulling prior guilty decisions have a positive effect on share prices. Smuda 
(2014) suggests that the EU regime for punishing cartels is insufficient given that 
(according to his own estimate) in 63 per cent of cases the gains from price fixing 
exceed the expected fines.

consumer choice, we might expect such improvements to feed through to macro-
economic outcomes in terms of improvements in economic growth, total factor

productivity and reductions in inequality. Finding appropriate and comparable 
measures of the strength of competition policy across countries and over time is 
not a straightforward exercise. Typically researchers have constructed indicators 
based on the magnitude of resources provided to competition authorities and the 
scope of laws in force within a country at a given time (OECD, 2013).
Buccirossi et al. (2013) investigate the relationship between competition policy, 
competition and productivity for 12 OECD countries over the period 1995–2009. 
There is a positive relationship between the strength of competition policy and 
productivity, and a negative relationship between the strength of competition 
policy and market power.
Petersen (2013) investigates whether the introduction of a new competition law 
affects economic growth. In a sample of 154 countries over the period 1960–2005, 
there is a positive relationship between the introduction of competition laws and 
GDP growth and GDP per capita.
Gutmann and Voigt (2014) explore the relationship between competition pol-
icy and macroeconomic outcomes (measured as GDP and productivity growth, 
domestic and foreign direct investment) using a sample of 179 countries over 
the period 1971–2012. There is a positive association between the strength of 
competition policy and GDP growth and domestic investment. However, there 
is no relationship between the strength of competition policy and productivity 
growth and foreign direct investment.
	
24.5	
Summary
The economic basis for competition policy rests in large measure on the theoreti-
cal case for and against monopoly. According to the neoclassical theory of the 
firm, under monopoly, market price is higher and output is lower than under 
perfect competition. The monopolist typically fails to produce at the minimum 
efficient scale, and therefore fails to produce at the lowest attainable average 
cost. The monopolist earns an abnormal profit in the long run, while the per-
fectly competitive firm earns only a normal profit. Under monopoly, there is 
allocative inefficiency because price exceeds marginal cost. Industry output 
is too low, and welfare could be increased by producing more output. Under 
monopoly, there may also be productive inefficiency, if a lack of competitive 
pressure implies a monopolist becomes complacent or lazy, failing to achieve 
full technical or economic efficiency. Monopoly produces a deadweight loss, 
and the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is lower than it is under 
perfect competition.
On the other hand, if the monopolist is able to operate on a lower average or 
marginal cost function than the firms comprising a perfectly competitive indus-
try, social welfare could be higher under monopoly than under perfect com-
petition. Overall, the theoretical evidence as to whether monopolies lead to a 
reduction in efficiency and social welfare is inconclusive.
A natural monopoly is a market in which average cost decreases as output 
increases over the entire range of realistic output levels. In natural monopoly, 
monopoly is always more cost-effective than competition. In this case, it is not at 

738	
|	 24    ■    Competition policy
all obvious that competition is a more desirable state of affairs than monopoly. 
On theoretical grounds, a policy of price discrimination practised by a monopo-
list should not always be judged pejoratively. Although in this way the monopo-
list earns an even higher abnormal profit than is possible by charging a uniform 
price, total output is higher and the last unit of output produced is sold at a price 
equivalent to its marginal cost. Therefore a policy of first-degree price discrimi-
nation may be consistent with social welfare maximization. With other forms 
of price discrimination, it is not possible to generalise about the social welfare 
implications.
An incumbent monopolist might pursue various strategies in an attempt to 
raise entry barriers and deter potential entrants. Monopolists might also seek 
to impose vertical restraints on other firms that are vertically linked (suppliers 
of the monopolist’s inputs or purchasers of its outputs). Such practices might 
be expected to attract the attention of the competition authorities. According 
to the Schumpeterian hypothesis, market power and monopoly status should 
be interpreted as the reward for successful past innovation. Successful innova-
tion brings benefits to society in the form of new products or more efficient 
production processes. In the past, the competition authorities have often taken 
a benign or favourable view of firms that are perceived to invest heavily in 
research and development.
Competition policy deals with three principal areas: monopoly, restrictive 
practices and merger. The implementation of monopoly, restrictive practices 
and merger policy requires a practical method for measuring market power. 
Seller concentration and market share measures are obvious candidates. How-
ever, provided entry barriers are not insurmountable and markets are contest-
able, the threat of entry and competition may constrain a monopolist’s pricing 
policy. It is therefore relevant to ask questions concerning the likelihood of 
entry. Issues of product and geographic market definition have major implica-
tions for the measurement of market power using concentration or market share 
indicators. Most economists recognise that perfect competition is a theoretical 
ideal, which is unlikely to be attainable in practice. A more realistic objective 
for competition policy might be to foster workable competition, which seeks 
to create aspects of structure and conduct that are most likely to deliver good 
performance.
At the time of writing, competition policy in the UK is the responsibility of the 
Competition and Markets Authority. The Competition Act 1998 and the Enter-
prise Act 2002 consolidated current arrangements for the conduct of competition 
policy, and harmonised the UK’s arrangements with those operative at EU level. 
The Chapter I prohibition deals with restrictive practices, and corresponds to 
Article 101 of the EU’s Treaty of Lisbon. The Chapter II prohibition deals with 
abuses of dominant (or monopoly) positions and corresponds to Article 102 of 
the Treaty of Lisbon. The most recent legislation, together with the provisions 
operative at EU level, has strengthened the UK’s competition policy regime con-
siderably, in comparison with previous decades.

Demand, revenue, elasticity and profit maximization
This section demonstrates the relationship between marginal revenue and price 
elasticity of demand.
Symbols
P = price
Q = output
TR = total revenue
MR = marginal revenue
PED = price elasticity of demand
The formal definition of price elasticity of demand is:
PED = dQ
dp * P
Q
where dQ
dP is the derivative of the market demand function with respect to price.
The definition of total revenue is:
TR = PQ
Using calculus, the definition of marginal revenue is the derivative of TR with 
respect to Q.
According to the Product Rule, if y = uv, dy
dx = u dv

Theories of perfect competition and monopoly
This section derives the long-run profit-maximizing equilibrium in monopoly 
for the case where the market demand function is linear, and the long-run aver-
age cost (LRAC) and long-run marginal cost (LRMC) functions are horizontal 
(constant returns to scale production technology).
Symbols
P = price
Q = output
c = marginal cost
TR = total revenue
p = profit
The market demand function (in inverse form) is:
P = a - bQ
By definition, total revenue is:
TR = PQ = (a - bQ)Q = aQ - bQ2
Total cost is:
TC = cQ
By definition, profit is total revenue minus total cost:
 p = TR - TC = aQ - bQ2 - cQ
 p = (a - c)Q - bQ2

Models of output determination in duopoly
This section provides an algebraic derivation of the Cournot–Nash, joint profit 
maximization and Stackelberg equilibria for a two-firm (duopoly) model and an 
N-firm (oligopoly) model. It is assumed the firms produce identical products, the 
market demand function is linear, and the long-run average cost (LRAC) and 
long-run marginal cost (LRMC) functions are horizontal (constant returns to 
scale production technology).

qi = total output of all firms
c = marginal cost
TRi = total revenue of firm i

Two-firm model (firms A and B)
The market demand function (in inverse form) is:
P = a - bQ
Substituting for Q in the market demand function, we can write:
P = a - b(qA + qB)

746	
|	 Appendix 1    ■    Mathematical Methods
Therefore:
 TRA = PqA = [a - b(qA + qB)]qA = aqA - bq2 A - bqAqB
 TRB = PqB = [a - b(qA + qB)]qB = aqB - bqAqB - bq2 B
 pA = TRA - cqA = aqA - bq2 A - bqAqB - cqA
= (a - c)qA - bq2 A - bqAqB
 pB = TRB - cqB = aqB - bqAqB - bq2 B - cqB
= (a - c)qB - bqAqB - bq2 B
Reaction functions
To derive the expression for firm A’s reaction function: take the partial deriva-
tive of pA with respect to qA (holding qB constant, in accordance with the zero 
conjectural variation assumption), set this partial derivative to zero, and solve 
the resulting expression for qA.
 pA
qA
= (a - c) - 2bqA - bqB
 (a - c) - 2bqA - bqB = 0
Therefore firm A’s reaction function is:
qA = a - c

Firm B’s reaction function is derived in the same way:
qB = a - c

Cournot–Nash equilibrium
The Cournot–Nash equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the two firms’ reac-
tion functions. To locate the Cournot–Nash equilibrium, substitute the expres-
sion for qB from firm B’s reaction function into firm A’s reaction function, and 
solve the resulting expression for qA. Let qA

discrimination for the case of two submarkets, and demonstrates that the total 
profit under third-degree price discrimination exceeds the total profit under uni-
form monopoly pricing.

Therefore the total revenue and profit functions for each submarket are:

Section 15.3 makes use of the following result: if the bidders’ signals are distrib-
uted uniformly over the interval v to v:
E[S(1)] = v + [N/(N + 1)](v + v)
Below and with reference to independent private values model, we prove the 
result E[V(1)] = N/(N + 1) for the cases N = 2 and N = 3, where E[V(1)] is the 
expected value of the highest private valuation, and bidders’ private valuations 
are distributed uniformly over the interval 0 to 1. This proof is equivalent to the 
proof required in the present case (simplified, but unaffected in any important 
way, by setting v = 0 and v = 1).

dent private values model, for the case of an English auction with two bid-
ders, where the bidders’ private valuations are distributed uniformly over the

The optimal reserve price is the value of r that maximises E(R0).
If r 7 V1 7 V2 or r 7 V2 7 V1, both bidders drop out before the reserve 
price is attained. No sale takes place, so the seller retains the item worth V0.
If V1 7 r 7 V2 or V2 7 r 7 V1, one bidder drops out before the reserve price 
is attained, but one bidder remains. A sale takes place at the reserve price, r.
If V1 7 V2 7 r or V2 7 V1 7 r, both bidders remain when the reserve price 
is attained. Bidding continues until the bidder with the lower private valuation 
drops out. A sale takes place, with the remaining bidder paying a price equivalent 
to the lower of the two private valuations.

Hotelling’s location model
This section derives the equilibrium prices in the collusive and non-collusive ver-
sions of the Hotelling model with fixed locations and endogenous prices.
Symbols
PA, PB = prices charged by firms A and B
P = common price charged by both firms (where applicable)
TR = total revenue
d = consumers> addresses, measured on a scale of d = 0 to d = 1
k = parameter reflecting magnitude of transport cost (per unit of distance), or 
degree of substitution between the products of firms A and B
p& = price at which the consumer located at address d = 0.5 is indifferent 
between buying from either firm.
Collusive model: joint profit maximization
P∼= 1 - k/4 denotes the price at which the consumer located at address d = 0.5 
is indifferent between buying from either firm or withdrawing from the market. 
Let P = PA = PB represent the common price charged by firms A and B under 
a policy of joint profit maximization. We examine the implications for joint total 
revenue (and therefore joint profit) of variations in P around p∼.
For 0 … P 6 P∼, firms A and B each supply one half of the market. Total 
quantity demanded = 1, and total revenue = P.
For P∼… P 6 1, firm A supplies consumers at addresses d such that P + kd2 … 1.
The consumer at address d = A
1 - P
k
 is indifferent between buying from 
firm A or withdrawing from the market.
Therefore firm A’s quantity demanded = A
1 - P

. By symmetry, firm B’s 
quantity demanded is given by the same expression.
Total quantity demanded = 2A

To find the value of P that maximises TR, differentiate TR with respect to P, 
set the derivative to zero and solve for P.

To differentiate TR with respect to P, use both the Product Rule and the Chain 
Rule. It can be shown:

Non-collusive model: Bertrand (or Nash) equilibrium
For the mathematical derivation of the Bertrand (or Nash) equilibrium, we assume 
both firms’ prices are sufficiently low that no consumer is priced out of the market.
The address at which a consumer is indifferent between purchasing from firm 
A or from firm B is d such that:
PA + kd2 = PB + k(1 - d)2
To solve for d:
 PA + kd2 = PB + k(1 - 2d + d2)
 PA - PB - k = -2kd
 d = PB - PA + k
2k
This expression represents firm A’s quantity demanded. Therefore firm A’s total 
revenue is:
TRA = PAPB - PA
2 + kPA
2k
Similarly, firm B’s total revenue is:
TRB = PAPB - PB
2 + kPB
2k
To determine the Bertrand (or Nash) equilibrium, at which each firm sets its 
price to maximise its own profit treating the other firm’s price as fixed: take the 
partial derivatives of TRA and TRB with respect to PA and PB, respectively, set 
the partial derivatives to zero and solve the resulting simultaneous equations 
for PA and PB.

2k
= 0 1 PB + K
2
- 2PB + K = 0
 PB + k - 4PB + 2k = 0
 PB = k
 PA = k
Therefore the Bertrand (or Nash) equilibrium is PA = PB = k. As noted above, 
this result is based on the assumption that no consumer is priced out of the mar-
ket altogether at the Bertrand (or Nash) equilibrium. For the consumer located 
at d = 0.5, this assumption is valid under the following condition:
k + kd2 … 1 1 k + k
4 … 1 S 5k
4 … 1 1 k … 4
5 = 0.8
For k 7 0.8, both firms operate as local monopolists, and their quantities 
demanded are not dependent on the other firm’s price. Each firm maximises 
profit within its own market. The solution is the same as in the collusive model. 
Therefore the full set of solutions (see also Figure 16.12) is as follows:
 For k … 0.8, PA = PB = k
 For 0.8 6 k … 1.33, PA = PB = 1 - k/4
 For k 7 1.33, PA = PB = 2/3

and define the time-dependent variable y as follows:
y =
ni,t
Ni
=

1 + e-(a+bt)
ni,t+1 - ni,t is interpreted as the rate of change of y with respect to time, dy
dt.
Therefore the original expression for the pace of diffusion can be rewritten 
as follows:
dy
dt = ky(1 - y)
The equivalence between the two previous expressions is shown by demonstrat-
ing that when
y =

1 + e-(a+bt), dy
dt = ky(1 - y).
To differentiate y =
1
1 + e-(a+bt) with respect to t, use the Chain Rule.
In general, if y = f [g(t)], dy
dt = f′[g(t)]g′(t), where f[] and g() are functions, and 
f′[] and g′() are the derivatives of f[] and g().
In this case, g(t) = (1 + e-(a+bt)) and f [g(t)] = (1 + e-(a+bt))-1:
 f′[g(t)] = -(1 + e-(a+bt))-2
 g′(t) = -be-(a+bt)
Applying the Chain Rule:
dy
dt =
be-(a+bt)

Introduction
Several chapters in this book refer to empirical studies, which examine whether 
economic hypotheses based on theoretical reasoning are supported empirically 
using data from the real world. In many cases, this evidence is obtained by apply-
ing regression analysis to industrial organization data. Appendix 2 provides a 
brief survey of the essentials of regression analysis at an introductory and non-
technical level. Any reader requiring a comprehensive treatment of this topic is 
advised to consult one (or more) of the following textbooks:

Types of industrial organization dataset
Datasets used for empirical research in industrial organization may have been 
compiled by government agencies or commercial organizations. There are two 
basic types of dataset: time series and cross-sectional.
■ A time-series dataset contains observations on a specific ‘unit’ over a number 
of time periods, which might be days, months or years. The ‘unit’ might be a 
single firm, or a particular industry.
■ A cross-sectional dataset contains observations on a number of ‘units’ at one 
particular point in time. The ‘units’ might be a group of firms classified as 
members of one industry, or a number of industries that comprise a larger 
grouping, such as an entire manufacturing or service sector.

	
	
	
﻿The two-variable linear regression model	 |	
767
Some datasets include both a time-series and a cross-sectional dimension. For 
example, there might be several time-series observations on each member of 
a group of firms or industries. This type of dataset is known as pooled cross-
sectional time-series data, or alternatively as panel data.
	
	
The two-variable linear regression model
Most empirical studies seek to explain observed facts about the real world. One 
of the most important questions that can be investigated using appropriate data 
is whether there is empirical evidence of a relationship between some specific 
economic variables. For example, if we have cross-sectional data on the levels of 
advertising expenditure and the sales revenues of a number of firms in the same 
year, we can investigate whether the data reveals any evidence of a relationship 
between advertising and sales revenue.
More generally, a two-variable linear regression model takes the following 
form:
yi = b1 + b2xi + ui
The definitions of variables and symbols are as follows:
yi is the dependent variable
xi is the independent or explanatory variable
ui is the error term
b1, b2 are the regression coefficients.
The dependent variable yi is the variable whose behaviour the model seeks to 
explain. The independent variable xi is a variable thought to influence or deter-
mine yi. The coefficient b2 identifies the impact on yi of a small change in the 
value of xi. For example, if xi increases by one unit, the numerical adjustment 
to the value of yi is given by the coefficient b2. The coefficient b1 can be inter-
preted as the expected value of the dependent variable yi when the independent 
variable xi equals zero. Finally, the error term ui allows for any variation in the 
dependent variable that is not accounted for by corresponding variation in the 
independent variable. In most regression models, the error term is assumed to be 
purely random. For purposes of statistical inference (see below) it is often useful 
to assume the error term is drawn from some specific probability distribution, 
such as the normal distribution.
So far, everything we have said refers to what is known as the ‘population’ or 
‘true’ regression model. b1 and b2 are unknown parameters which describe the 
true relationship between xi and yi. In order to know b1 and b2, we would need 
complete information about every member of the population of firms or indus-
tries. In practice we do not have this much information. However, we can take 
a random sample of observations of yi and xi, and use it to obtain estimates of 
b1 and b2. If we take a random sample and, using only these observations, fit a 
line as best we can through them, we obtain the sample regression line. Because 

768	
|	 Appendix 2    ■    Econometric methods
no sample is ever perfectly representative of the population from which it is 
drawn, the sample regression line will never coincide precisely with the (true but 
unknown) population regression line: we will always slightly over- or underes-
timate b1 and b2.
The sample regression model is specified as follows:
yi = bn1 + bn2xi + ei
In the sample (estimated) model, bn1 and bn2 are the sample estimators of b1 and 
b2. ei is the sample estimator of ui, known as the estimated error term or residual. 
yni = bn1 + bn2xi are known as the estimated values or fitted values of the depen-
dent variable, yi.
Consider Table A.1, which records the levels of advertising expenditure and 
sales revenue for a sample of nine firms, observed in 2016:

The simplest way of thinking about regression analysis is in terms of using 
a ruler to draw a ‘line-of-best-fit’ through the centre of the set of plotted 
points. The estimation technique known as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is 
the mathematical method that is used to locate the line-of-best-fit precisely. 
Numerical estimates of the regression coefficients b1 and b2 can be obtained 
from any computer package that includes OLS estimation. The estimation 
results are shown below.

Unexplained variation, Σei
2 = 14.0
R@square = 0.884 (=106.9/120.9)
Therefore the fitted regression model is:
yni = 3.607 + 1.311xi
In many empirical studies, it is standard practice to write down an estimated 
regression model using a slightly different notational convention, in which 
the dependent and independent variables are identified by names (which are 
often abbreviated). Therefore we might use SALES to denote sales revenue and 
ADVERT to denote advertising expenditure. Using this alternative notation, the 
same fitted regression model would be written as:
SALES = 3.607 + 1.311 ADVERT
Statistical inference
Once a regression model has been estimated, the signs and numerical magni-
tudes of the estimated coefficients convey information about the direction and 
strength of the relationship between the independent variable and the depen-
dent variable. Because the estimated coefficients are based on a limited sample 
of data, there is always a suspicion of imprecision or unreliability attached to 
them. For this reason, estimation methods for regression coefficients provide 
a standard error for each estimated coefficient. The standard error reflects the 
reliability of the estimated coefficient: the smaller the standard error, the greater 
the reliability.
The ratio of an estimated coefficient to its standard error, usually known 
as a t-statistic or z-statistic (depending on precisely which type of regression 
model is being fitted), provides a convenient method for assessing whether 
the estimation has succeeded in identifying a relationship between variables 
that is reliable in a statistical sense. This is one of the main tasks of statistical 

770

inference. The t-statistic (or z-statistic) for the estimated coefficient bn2 is cal-
culated as
t = bn2/se(bn2), where se(bn2) is the standard error of bn2.
If the absolute value of the t-statistic exceeds a certain critical value, we say that 
bn2 is statistically significant or significantly different from zero. This means we 
have sufficient statistical evidence to reject the hypothesis that the true value of 
the coefficient b2 is zero.
Whenever a hypothesis test is carried out, it is usual to quote an accompanying 
significance level, such as 1, 5 or 10 per cent. This expresses the probability that 
the test may cause us to draw a wrong inference, by rejecting a hypothesis that 
is actually true. With a significance level of 5 per cent, if b2 really were zero, the 
test would run a 5 per cent risk of incorrectly concluding that b2 is non-zero. The 
smaller the significance level, the greater the degree of confidence we can have in 
any decision to reject the hypothesis that the true value of the coefficient is zero.
In the advertising–sales example, suppose we wish to test the hypothesis 
that advertising has no effect on sales revenue. This is equivalent to testing the 
hypothesis that the true value of the unknown coefficient b2 equals zero. We will 
use a significance level of 5 per cent.
■ The t-statistic is bn2/se(bn2) = 1.311/0.179 = 7.21.
■ The critical value for the test is taken from statistical tables for the ­t-­distribution 
with n - k = 7 degrees of freedom, where n = 9 is the number of observa-
tions used to estimate the model, and k = 2 is the number of estimated regres-
sion coefficients. For a test at the 5 per cent significance level, this critical value 
is 2.365.
■ If the t-statistic is numerically smaller than the critical value, we accept the 
hypothesis we are testing. If the t-statistic is numerically greater than the criti-
cal value, we reject the hypothesis.
■ In this case, the t-statistic of 7.21 exceeds the critical value of 2.365. Therefore 
we reject the hypothesis that the true value of the coefficient b2 equals zero. 
We infer b2 is non-zero, and advertising does therefore have a significant effect 
on sales revenue.
Multiple regression
The two-variable linear regression model that is described above can easily be 
extended to allow for cases where there is more than one independent variable. 
We might wish to expand the model that seeks to explain the variation in sales, 
by adding more independent variables. For example, we might believe that for 
any particular firm, sales will depend not only on the firm’s own advertising 
expenditure, but also on a number of other factors such as price, product quality, 
or rivals’ pricing and advertising decisions.
For a multiple regression, the population or ‘true’ model is defined as follows:
yi = b1 + b2x2i + b3x3i + ... + bkxki + ui

	
	
	
﻿The two-variable linear regression model	 |	
771
The definitions of variables and symbols are as follows:
yi is the dependent variable;
x2i, x3i, c , xki are the independent or explanatory variables;
ui is the error term;
b1, b2, b3, c , bk are the regression coefficients.
As before, the dependent variable yi is the variable whose behaviour the model 
seeks either to explain or to predict. The independent variables x2i, x3i, c , xki 
are other variables thought to influence or determine yi. The coefficients 
b2, b3, c , bk identify the impact on yi of small changes in the values of each 
of x2i, x3i, c , xki, respectively.
The sample/estimated model is written as follows:
yi = bn1 + bn2x2i + bn3x3i + c + bnkxki + ei
This type of regression cannot be presented graphically, but computer software 
can be used to obtain estimated regression coefficients denoted b1, b2, c , bk, 
as well as their standard errors and t-statistics.
So far, we have assumed the dependent variable, yi, is influenced by a number 
of independent variables, x2i c , xki, which are quantitative (measurable) in 
nature. However, in some cases we might also want to incorporate certain non-
quantitative or qualitative information as well.
With reference to our earlier example of a model for the sales revenues of 
firms in 2016, it might be the case that some of the firms have introduced a new 
model in 2016, while others are continuing to sell an old model. For each firm, 
the information as to whether or not a new model has been introduced can be 
captured by defining a 0–1 dummy variable di:
di = 1 if firm i introduced a new model in 2016
di = 0 if firm i did not introduce a new model in 2016.
In our earlier example, suppose firms A, D, F and I introduced new models in 
2016, while firms B, C, E, G and H continued to sell old models. The extended 
dataset is as shown in Table A.2:

Running a multiple regression in which the dependent variable is yi and the 
independent variables are xi and di, the estimation results (presented in the same 
format as before) are as shown below:

Σ(yni - y)2 = 116.3
Unexplained variation, Σei
2 = 4.6
R@square = 0.962(= 116.3/120.9)
Therefore the fitted regression model is:
yni = 3.567 + 1.138xi + 2.254di
Using the alternative notation, and letting NEW denote the new product dummy 
variable, the same fitted regression model would be written:
SALES = 3.567 + 1.138 ADVERT + 2.254 NEW
Suppose we now wish to test the hypothesis that the introduction of a new 
model has no effect on sales revenue. This is equivalent to testing the hypothesis 
that the true value of the unknown coefficient b3 equals zero. As before, we will 
use a significance level of 5 per cent.
■ The t-statistic is bn3/se(bn3) = 2.254/0.640 = 3.52.
■ The critical value for the test is taken from statistical tables for the t-­distribution 
with n - k = 6 degrees of freedom (there are n = 9 observations and k = 3 
estimated regression coefficients). For a test at the 5 per cent level, this critical 
value is 2.447.
■ The t-statistic of 3.52 exceeds the critical value of 2.447. Therefore we reject 
the hypothesis that the true value of the coefficient b3 is zero. We infer the 
introduction of a new model does have a significant effect on sales revenue.
	
	
Coefficient of determination, R2
When we fit a regression model using a sample of data, we are attempting to 
explain as much as possible of the variation in yi (the dependent variable). The 
variation in yi is explained by corresponding variation in xi (the independent 
variable). However, not all of the variation in yi can be explained by variation 
in xi. This is why we have an error term, ui, which allows for all other (random) 
influences on yi.

Consider Figures A.2a and A.2b. In both cases the same regression line has 
been fitted. Both lines have the same intercept and the same slope. However, 
it is clear that the regression line in Figure A.2a fits the data more accurately 
than the one in Figure A.2b, because in the latter case the data are more widely 
dispersed around the fitted regression line. It is natural to ask what propor-
tion of the total variation in yi is explained by xi, and what proportion is left 
unexplained.
In the case of a multiple regression, the estimated model may be written:
yi = yni + ei where yni = bn1 + bn2x2i + bn3x3i + c . + bnkxk
Subtracting the sample mean of the dependent variable y, denoted, from both 
sides we can write:
(yi - y) = (yni - y) + ei
For the i-th observation, we can interpret the components of this expression as 
follows:
yi - y = total variation in the i-th observation of the dependent variable (dif-
ference between the actual value and the sample mean).
yni - y = explained variation in the i-th observation (difference between the fit-
ted value and the sample mean).
ei = unexplained variation (error, or difference between the actual and fitted 
values).
It can be shown that a similar relationship exists between the sums (over all 
observations in the sample) of squares of these terms. By squaring, we make all 
the terms positive and therefore comparable with each other. By summing we 
obtain measures of variation over the entire sample.
 Σ(yi - y)2  =    Σ(yni - y)2  +   Σei
2
 Total variation in yi = Explained variation + Unexplained variation
Figure A.2  Regression models with different degrees of explanatory power

774	
|	 Appendix 2    ■    Econometric methods
This relationship allows us to define R2(‘R-square’) or goodness-of-fit, also 
known as the coefficient of determination, as follows:
 R2 = Explained variation
Total variation
 R2 =
a (yni - y)2
a (yi - y)2
R2 must lie between 0 and 1. As we have seen, its interpretation is quite simple:
R2 is the proportion of the variation in yi that is explained by the model.
For the first of our two fitted regression models,
SALES = 3.607 + 1.311 ADVERT:
Σ(yni - y)2 = 106.9 and Σ(yi - y)2 = 120.9 1 R2 = 0.882
For the second of our two models, SALES = 3.567 + 1.138 ADVERT +
2.254 NEW:
Σ(yni - y)2 = 116.3 and Σ(yi - y)2 = 120.9 1 R2 = 0.962
Therefore, advertising expenditure by itself is capable of explaining 88.2 per cent 
of the variation in sales revenue. When the information about which firms are 
selling new models is added to the dataset, the proportion of the variation in sales 
revenue that is explained by the model increases to 96.2 per cent.
Difficulties and pitfalls in the interpretation of regression 
results
In practice, various statistical issues can create difficulties or cloud the inter-
pretation of an estimated regression model. This survey concludes with a brief 
discussion of a few of the issues that arise most frequently.
■ The direction of causation. Although regression analysis may be able to confirm 
the existence of significant relationships between economic variables, it may 
be unable to determine the direction of causation. For example, one might 
find evidence of a positive relationship between research and development and 
the level of seller concentration. However, it might still be difficult to decide 
whether high concentration leads to high research and development expendi-
ture, or whether a high level of research and development expenditure tends to 
create a highly concentrated industry structure.
■ Multicollinearity. Multicollinearity describes the case where some or all of the 
independent variables included in a multiple regression model are highly cor-
related with one another. Collectively, the independent variables are success-
ful in explaining the variation in the dependent variable, but the estimation 
is unable to pinpoint the individual relationships between each independent 
variable and the dependent variable. For example, suppose the quantity 

	
	
	
Coefficient of determination, R2	 |	
775
demanded of a firm’s product depends on its own price, and on a rival’s price 
(as well as other variables). If the two firms always tend to change their prices 
in the same direction at the same time, it becomes difficult for the regression 
model to isolate the separate effects of each of the two prices on the quantity 
demanded.
■ Autocorrelation. Autocorrelation or serial correlation arises when the assump-
tion of a random error term is violated. This problem commonly arises in 
regression models estimated using time-series data. The randomness assump-
tion requires that all random disturbances affect the dependent variable for one 
time-period only, and then disappear completely. However, this requirement 
may not be satisfied in practice. For example, the demand for a particular prod-
uct may be affected by many factors that change slowly through time, such as 
lifestyles, tastes, customs and habits. If these factors are not captured explicitly 
among the model’s independent variables, their effects will be incorporated 
into the error term. Because these factors change slowly over time, the values 
of the error term in successive periods will be correlated, violating the random-
ness assumption. If uncorrected, autocorrelation may result in t-statistics and 
R-square giving an exaggerated impression of the precision of a fitted regres-
sion model.
■ Heteroscedasticity. If the amount of variation in the random error term (mea-
sured by its variance) changes as the values of the independent variables change, 
there is a problem of heteroscedasticity. This is a common problem in regres-
sion models estimated using cross-sectional data. For example, over a large 
cross-section of firms, one might expect to find greater variation in growth 
rates at the lower end of the firm size distribution than at the upper end. Start-
ing from a very low base, a successful small firm might record a year-on-year 
growth rate of several hundred per cent, whereas an unsuccessful small firm 
might just as easily shed most of its sales or assets in any one year. It is unlikely 
that, proportionately, a very large firm would experience such a large (positive 
or negative) year-on-year growth rate. Therefore a cross-­sectional regression 
model using growth as a dependent variable might be subject to a heterosce-
dasticity problem, if the variation in the dependent variable feeds through into 
similar variation in the error term. If uncorrected, heteroscedasticity can lead 
to incorrect inferences being drawn from hypothesis tests.
■ Misspecification. Misspecification errors arise when independent variables 
that actually have no effect on the dependent variable are included in a mul-
tiple regression model, or when variables that do have an effect are omit-
ted. Another possible source of misspecification error is the selection of an 
incorrect functional form for the estimated equation. For example, if the true 
relationship between seller concentration and advertising expenditure is qua-
dratic, but a linear specification is estimated instead, misleading inferences 
about the existence or nature of this relationship may be obtained. In practice, 
finding the correct specification for a regression model is often a difficult task. 
There are hundreds of economic variables, many of which are interrelated to a 
greater or lesser extent. Researchers may need to estimate and compare many 
different versions of a model before a final specification is accepted.

Price rigidity.  A tendency for oligopolists to avoid fre-
quent changes of price, perhaps preferring instead 
non-price forms of competition.
Price-taking behaviour.  Each firm’s market share is suf-
ficiently small that the firm believes its output decision 
has no bearing on the market price. Therefore, the firm 
treats the market price as being beyond its control.
Principal–agent problem.  Agency theory emphasises 
the conflicts that can arise between principals and 
agents. The principal–agent problem refers to the 
difficulties that arise when a principal hires an agent, 
due to imperfect information.
Prisoner’s dilemma.  In game theory, refers to a case in 
which players select their dominant strategies and 
achieve an equilibrium in which they are worse off 
than they would be if they could all agree to select 
an alternative (non-dominant) strategy.
Privatization.  The sale and transfer of assets from the 
public sector to the private sector.
Process innovation.  The commercial application of a 
new piece of cost-saving technology.
Producer surplus.  The difference between the market 
price and the minimum price a producer would be 
willing to accept.
Product differentiation.  The practice of making close 
substitutes appear different, so that customers no 
longer regard them as similar or identical.
Product differentiation entry barrier.  Arises when a 
potential entrant incurs advertising or other market-
ing costs in order to achieve a viable market share, 
because consumers are loyal to the established brands 
of incumbents. Both natural and strategic product dif-
ferentiation may give rise to entry barriers.
Product innovation.  Production of a new product on a 
commercial basis.
Production function.  A technological relationship 
between the quantities of inputs and the level of 
output.
Productive efficiency.  A firm is efficient in production 
if it has achieved both technical efficiency and eco-
nomic efficiency.
Product market definition.  Includes all products that 
are close substitutes for one another, both in con-
sumption and in production.
Profit maximization.  The output level where marginal 
revenue equals marginal cost.
Pure common value model.  In auction theory, there is 
a single, intrinsic value of the item being sold that is 
the same for all bidders.
Pure strategy.  In game theory, a strategy whereby one 
player always chooses a certain action, regardless of 
the actions chosen by other players.
Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium.  See Nash Equilibrium.
Quantity-dependent pricing.  The price per unit depends 
on the number of units purchased. Also known as 
non-linear pricing.
Quantity forcing.  A seller with market power forces 
buyers to purchase more units of a good than they 
would wish if they had the choice.
Quasi-rent.  Rent arising from the creation of an asset 
that is specific to some particular relationship, but 
with little or no value outside that relationship.
Reaction function.  Shows the profit-maximizing 
response of one firm to a price or output decision 
taken by a rival firm, treating the rival’s decision 
as fixed.
Real economies of scale.  Economies of scale arising 
from technological relationships between inputs and 
outputs embodied in a firm’s long-run production 
function.
Reciprocity.  An agreement whereby firm A purchases 
inputs from firm B, on condition that firm B also 
purchases inputs from firm A.
Regional concentration.  See geographic concentration.
Repeated game.  See multiple-period game.
Representative consumer model.  A model of product 
differentiation in which consumers’ tastes or pref-
erences are expressed in terms of goods or services 
(rather than characteristics), and firms compete to 
attract buyers by differentiating the goods or ser-
vices they offer.
Resale price maintenance.  A practice whereby an 
upstream firm sets a minimum (or possibly a maxi-
mum) price to be charged in a downstream (usually 
retail) market.
Reserve price.  In auction theory, a minimum bid 
that must be registered for the sale of the item to 
proceed.
Residual rights (to control).  Rights to whatever 
resources are left after a firm’s contractual obliga-
tions have been satisfied and all specific rights to the 
firm’s resources have been assigned.
Restrictive practices policy.  A branch of competition 
policy dealing with single firms or groups or firms 
that engage in practices that may be detrimental to 
consumer welfare, such as price fixing, output quo-
tas, predatory pricing and vertical restraints.
Returns to scale.  See increasing returns to scale and 
decreasing returns to scale.
Revenue equivalence theorem.  In auction theory, in 
the case where bidders form independent private 
valuations of the item that is for sale, all four basic 
auction types (English, Dutch, first price sealed bid 
and second price sealed bid) yield the same expected 
proceeds to the seller.

Revenue test.  A test proposed by Rosse and Panzar 
(1977), which examines whether firm conduct is 
in accordance with the models of perfect competi-
tion, imperfect competition or monopoly, based on 
observation of the impact of variations in factor 
prices on profit-maximizing firm-level revenues.
Rule of reason.  The principle that competition policy 
should be concerned with the practical consequences 
for competition and welfare of specific abuses of 
market power or other restrictive practices, rather 
than with the structural characteristics of markets 
which might, in theory, create opportunities for 
anticompetitive practice.
Sample selection bias.  Bias arising in statistical analy-
sis if the data has been chosen non-randomly. For 
example, if five years’ data is required for each firm, 
and only those firms that traded continuously for 
five years are included, a non-random sample of sur-
vivors is obtained, excluding all firms that entered 
and exited during the five-year period. This specific 
form of sample selection bias is known as survivor-
ship bias.
Satisficing.  In the behavioural theory of the firm, a 
firm aims for a satisfactory profit but does not nec-
essarily maximise profit.
Schumpeterian hypothesis.  Describes the view that a 
fast pace of innovation is more likely to be associ-
ated with monopoly than with competition.
Search goods.  Goods whose qualities can be ascertained 
by inspection prior to purchase and consumption.
Second-degree price discrimination.  The price per unit 
of output depends on the number of units pur-
chased, but not on the identity of the buyer. All 
buyers who purchase a given number of units pay 
the same price per unit.
Second-mover advantage.  A situation in which a firm is 
rewarded for waiting for a competitor to take some 
strategic action, and responding subsequently after 
observing the competitor’s decision.
Second price sealed bid auction.  An auction in which 
each bidder independently and privately submits a 
single bid. The highest bidder secures the item, but 
pays a price equal to the second-highest submitted 
bid. Also known as a Vickrey auction.
Seller concentration.  A measure of the number and 
size distribution of sellers, reflecting the degree 
of market power on the supply side. May refer 
either to aggregate concentration (for the economy 
as a whole) or to industry concentration (for one 
­particular industry).
Semi-collusion.  Firms collude over certain areas of 
activity (for example, pricing or production), but 
compete in other areas in which it may be more dif-
ficult to specify, conclude or enforce an agreement 
(for example, research and development).
Sequential game.  In game theory, players choose their 
actions sequentially (in turn). A player who moves 
later knows which actions were chosen by players 
who moved earlier.
Shopping goods.  Goods that are expensive and are pur-
chased infrequently.
Short run.  A time period during which only one factor 
input used in production can be varied, while other 
factor inputs are fixed.
Side-payment.  In the behavioural theory of the firm, a 
payment in excess of the minimum required to pre-
vent an individual or group from withdrawing from 
the organization.
Simultaneous game.  In game theory, all players choose 
their actions simultaneously. When choosing, no 
player knows the actions chosen by other players.
Slotting allowances.  These occur in retailing, when 
large buyers, such as supermarket chains, require 
fees or other payments from suppliers, such as food 
manufacturers, to place their products in prominent 
positions.
Spatial model.  See location model.
Specialization.  Refers to the extent to which a coun-
try’s production is composed mainly of a small 
number of products or services, or is more widely 
dispersed.
Specific rights.  Rights that are specified explicitly in the 
terms of a contract.
Stackelberg equilibrium.  A solution to a duopoly or an 
oligopoly model, in which one firm anticipates its 
rivals’ tendencies to act in accordance with a zero 
conjectural variation assumption, and exploits this 
awareness to increase its own profit.
Stakeholder.  The broadest stakeholder defini-
tion includes any group that has the capability 
to influence or exert pressure on the company’s 
management.
State-sponsored collusion.  Collusion that is encouraged 
or dictated by government. The justification might 
be to promote rationalization, or to assure a steady 
supply.
Strategic alliance.  A form of cooperation between pro-
ducers that stops short of a full-scale merger, such as 
a licensing arrangement or a joint venture.
Strategic group.  A group of firms from the same 
industry, whose conduct is similar and that tend to 

	
	
	
Glossary	 |	
791
view other firms from the same group as their main 
competitors.
Strategic product differentiation.  The distinguishing 
characteristics of products are consciously created 
by suppliers, for example through advertising or 
other types of marketing campaign.
Strategy.  In game theory, a set of rules defining which 
action a player should choose under each possible 
set of circumstances that might exist at any stage in 
the game.
Strict dominance.  Describes a situation where a strat-
egy is superior to another strategy under all possible 
circumstances regarding the other player’s choice of 
strategy.
Structure–conduct–performance paradigm.  A method-
ological approach for research in industrial orga-
nization, in which the structural characteristics 
of industries are assumed to influence or dictate 
the conduct and performance of the industry’s 
member firms. More sophisticated models allow 
for feedback effects, whereby conduct and perfor-
mance variables help shape the industry’s future 
structure.
Subgame Perfect Equilibrium.  A Nash Equilibrium 
solution to a game that is also a Nash Equilibrium 
solution to all possible subgames. Any Nash Equi-
librium that could only be achieved if a player took 
an action that was sub-optimal at some stage of the 
game is not a Subgame Perfect Equilibrium.
Substitutes.  Goods with a positive cross-price elastic-
ity of demand: an increase in the price of one good 
leads to an increase in demand for the other good
Sunk cost.  Expenditure on items such as advertis-
ing and research and development that is non-
recoverable in the event that the firm exits from 
the industry.
Survivorship bias.  See sample selection bias.
Switching costs.  Costs associated with switching from 
one supplier to another.
Synergy.  Synergies exist when two companies merge 
and the combined sum in value is greater than the 
sum of the individual values.
Tacit collusion.  Collusion that is not organised through 
a formal, explicit contract or other specific agree-
ment between the colluding parties.
Tangency solution.  Long-run equilibrium under 
monopolistic competition, at which each firm’s aver-
age revenue function is tangential to its average cost 
function. Accordingly, each firm earns only a nor-
mal profit.
Technical efficiency.  A firm is technically efficient if 
it is producing the maximum quantity of output 
that is technologically feasible, given the quanti-
ties of the factor inputs it employs. A technically 
efficient firm operates on (and not within) its own 
production function. Also known as x-efficiency.
Third-degree price discrimination.  Price depends on the 
identity of the buyer but not on the number of units 
purchased. Any buyer is offered as many or as few 
units as he or she wishes at a constant price.
Tie-in sale.  See tying.
Tit-for-tat.  In game theory, a strategy whereby one 
player punishes another for non-cooperation in a 
previous period.
Tobin’s q.  The ratio of a firm’s stock market value to 
the replacement cost of its capital.
Total cost.  Variable cost plus fixed cost.
Total revenue.  Price times quantity sold.
Tournament theory.  The theory suggests that high CEO 
remuneration is a ‘prize’. This provides incentives 
for junior executives on much lower salaries to com-
pete against each other. The winner then becomes 
eligible for promotion to the rank of CEO. The 
larger the firm, the greater the pay disparity.
Trade association.  An organization that represents the 
interests of the member firms of an industry. It usu-
ally differs from a cartel in that it has no monopo-
listic intent.
Transaction costs.  Costs incurred when using the mar-
ket to allocate resources, arising from the acquisi-
tion of information or the negotiation, monitoring 
and enforcement of contracts.
Transfer pricing.  The pricing of intermediate products 
traded internally between the divisions of a single 
firm.
Two-part tariff.  A price structure requiring the pay-
ment of a fixed fee (mandatory if any purchases are 
to be made) and an additional uniform price for 
each unit purchased.
Tying.  A firm with market power in the market for 
Good X requires buyers also to purchase Good 
Y in order to obtain Good X. Also known as a 
tie-in sale.
Type 1 industry.  An industry in which growth in the 
size of the market leads to fragmentation of industry 
structure and deconcentration (Sutton, 1991). The 
level of sunk cost investment expenditure is deter-
mined exogenously, by product characteristics and 
technological conditions.
Type 2 industry.  An industry in which growth in the 
size of the market leads to growth in the size of the 

792	
|	 Glossary
largest firms, and no tendency for fragmentation 
of industry structure or deconcentration (Sutton, 
1991). The level of sunk cost investment expendi-
ture is determined endogenously, by incumbent 
firms’ decisions on advertising and research and 
development.
Upstream vertical integration.  See backward vertical 
integration.
Valuation ratio.  The ratio of the firm’s stock market 
value to the book value of its assets.
Value chain.  A technique devised to disaggregate a firm 
into its strategically relevant activities, in order to 
appraise each activity’s contribution to the firm’s 
performance.
Variable cost.  The component of total cost that varies 
with output.
Variance decomposition analysis.  A statistical tech-
nique involving the decomposition of the varia-
tion in a firm’s profitability into components 
deriving from the industries in which the firm 
operates, and from each division or business unit 
within the firm.
Vertical agreement.  Agreements between firms oper-
ating at successive stages of a production process, 
such as exclusive dealing contracts and resale price 
maintenance.
Vertical disintegration.  A corporate strategy of disen-
gaging from an involvement in one or more stages 
of the production process.
Vertical integration.  See vertical merger.
Vertical merger.  A merger between two firms that pro-
duce at different stages of a production process, also 
known as vertical integration.
Vertical product differentiation.  One product, service 
or brand differs from another in terms of overall 
quality. If the prices were the same, all consumers 
would choose the superior product.
Vertical restraint.  Conditions or restrictions on trade 
between firms that are linked vertically.
Vickrey auction.  See second price sealed bid auction. 
Due to Vickrey (1961).
Weak dominance.  Describes a situation where a strat-
egy is no worse than another strategy under all pos-
sible circumstances regarding the other player’s 
choice of strategy, and superior to the other strat-
egy under at least one choice made by the other 
player.
Welfare.  A measure of well-being based on alternative 
allocations of scarce resources.
Winner’s curse.  A tendency for the winning bid to 
exceed the intrinsic value of the item being auc-
tioned, common in sealed bid auctions.
Workable competition.  An approach to competition 
policy which seeks to adjust aspects of structure 
and conduct in order to bring about a favourable 
performance outcome.
X-efficiency.  See technical efficiency.
Zero-sum game.  A constant sum game in which the sum 
of the gains and losses of all players is always zero.
