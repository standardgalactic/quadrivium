Shortcuts

We can speed up our command-line experience by
taking advantage of the many built-in shortcuts.
These shortcuts are designed so that your hands never
have to leave your keyboard "home base"
They take a little bit of practice to get comfortable
with, but it's worth the effort! 
Shortcuts

Clearing
Use ctrl-l to clear the entire screen

Use ctrl-a to move the cursor to the beginning
of the line.
Use ctrl-e to move the cursor to the end of the
line.
Line Jumping

Moving 
Characters
Use ctrl-f to move the cursor forward one
character at a time (same as the right arrow)
Use ctrl-b to move the cursor backwards one
character at a time (same as the left arrow)

Jumping Words
Use alt-f to move the cursor forward one word.
Use alt-b to move the cursor backwards one word.

Swapping
Use ctrl-t to swap the current character under the
cursor with the one preceding it.  This can be useful
to correct typos made by typing to quickly!

Killing The Line
Use ctrl-k to kill the text from the current cursor
location until the end of the line.   →
Use ctrl-u to kill the text from the current cursor
location to the beginning of the line.  ←

Killing A Word
Use alt-d to kill the text from the current cursor
location through the end of the word  →
Use ctrl-w or alt-delete to kill the text from the
current cursor through the beginning of the word  ←

Reviving Text
(Yanking)
When we kill text using commands like ctrl-k, ctrl-u,
alt-d, and alt-backspace, the "killed" text is stored
in a memory in an area known as the "kill-ring"
We retrieve the most recently killed text using 
ctrl-y. 

Bash keeps a record the command we have previously
entered.   We can see the actual file at ~/.bash_history.
You can scroll through the history one command at a time
using the up and down arrows.
We can also use the history command to view the entire
history, though it's generally easier to manage if we pipe
the output to less.
History
history
❯
history | less
❯

We can easily re-run an earlier command if we have its
line number from the history.  
For example, to run the 73rd command in the history, we
could run !73
History Expansion
!somenumber
❯
!73
❯

Often it's easiest to find an earlier command by searching
using a small portion of the command that you remember.
Type ctrl-r to enter "reverse-i-search".  As you start typing,
bash will search the history and show you the best match.  
Hit ctrl-r to cycle through potential matches.
