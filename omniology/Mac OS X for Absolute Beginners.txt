  About the Author 
 Wallace   Wang  has written dozens of computer books over the years, beginning with ancient 
MS-DOS programs like WordPerfect and Turbo Pascal, and graduating up to Windows 
programs like Visual Basic and Microsoft Office. After taking one look at the incredible mess 
that Microsoft made with Vista, he decided to abandon the Windows world and shift toward 
the friendlier and less frustrating world of the Macintosh. (His decision was confirmed when 
Microsoft released Windows 8 to an unsuspecting public.) 
 After being a happy Macintosh user for nearly a decade, he’s spent the last several years 
helping people make the transition from Windows to Macintosh as painless as possible. 
When he’s not helping people discover the joys of personal computing with a computer 
that’s actually fun to use, he performs stand-up comedy and appears on two radio shows 
on KNSJ in San Diego (  http://knsj.org ) called  Notes From the Underground and  Laugh In 
Your Face Radio (   www.laughinyourfaceradio.com  ). 
 He also writes a screenwriting blog called  The 15 Minute Movie Method 
(  http://15minutemoviemethod.com ), a blog about the latest cat news on the Internet called 
 Cat Daily News (  http://catdailynews.com ), and a blog about the latest technology related to 
Apple products called  Top Bananas (   www.topbananas.com  ).

 Introduction 
 Most people don’t buy a Macintosh because they want to use Photos, iTunes, or Pages. 
Instead, most people buy a Macintosh because they want to accomplish a specific result, 
such as saving and viewing photographs, playing music, or typing and printing a letter. 
That’s why thick books explaining how to use the Macintosh operating system, called OS X, 
can be so intimidating. These thick books assume readers want to become computer 
experts by learning how OS X works. 
 As a result, most computer books exhaustively explain every possible feature of OS X 
without telling you why you might want to use that particular feature. That’s like forcing you 
to learn how a six-cylinder internal combustion engine works before you learn how to drive. 
 This book is different because it teaches you the most common tasks you’ll need to be 
productive on your Macintosh. You won’t learn every possible feature of iTunes or Mail. 
Instead, you’ll just learn enough so you can feel comfortable using a Macintosh. 
 A computer is nothing more than a tool. What you do with that tool is entirely up to you. 
 A paintbrush is also a tool, but if you give a paintbrush to the average person, they might be 
able to scribble some blobs of pretty colors on a canvas. Yet if you give a paintbrush to an 
artist like Michelangelo, you get a work of art painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. 
 The co-founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, once described computers as “bicycles for the mind.” 
Jobs said this after reading a  Scientific American article that showed that condors used 
the least amount of energy to move a kilometer. In comparison, humans were extremely 
inefficient in moving that same distance by walking or running. However, when humans 
used a bicycle to travel a kilometer, they expended far less energy than even a condor. Just 
as a bicycle is a tool to make humans more efficient in getting from one place to another, 
computers are a tool to make humans more efficient in tapping their creativity. 
 So this book won’t waste your time by teaching you what different tools can do. Instead, 
this book focuses on teaching you how to use different tools so that you can create useful 
results on your Macintosh.

Introduction
 Whether you need to write a letter, jot down some notes, edit a picture, or play music, this 
book will show you the fastest, simplest, and easiest way to achieve a given task—so that 
your Macintosh becomes a bicycle for your mind. 
 Understanding How a Macintosh Works 
 Whether you have an iMac or Mac mini that sits on a desk, or a MacBook laptop that you 
can take with you, every Macintosh is nothing more than a chunk of hardware. What makes 
that chunk of hardware work is a special program called an  operating system . 
 If you’ve used a PC before, you’re probably already familiar with an operating system called 
Microsoft Windows. With a Macintosh, the operating system is called OS X. 
 Don’t worry. You don’t have to know anything about OS X to use your Macintosh. All you 
need to know is that any time you want to do something, you need to find the right program 
that works with OS X to accomplish it. On OS X, you can do such things as
  Play music  
  Write letters  
  Edit video  
  Browse web pages on the Internet  
  Send and receive e-mail  
  And many other tasks  
 While OS X makes your Macintosh work, individual programs stored on your Macintosh let 
you perform specific tasks. For example, your Macintosh might have a word processor that 
lets you type and print letters from it, an e-book viewer that allows you to read books on it, 
or a game that lets you to play chess with it. 
 Each time you install a new program, you make your Macintosh more versatile and capable 
of performing different tasks. With the right program, your Macintosh can do almost 
anything. However, this book focuses solely on the programs that come free with every 
Macintosh. 
 So whether you’ve used a computer before or you’re a complete novice, don’t worry. This 
book won’t bog you down with technical details. Instead, you’ll learn what to do, how to do 
it, and more importantly, why to do it. 
 There’s a reason why more people are buying and using Macintosh computers. It’s because 
a Macintosh is easier, more reliable, and maybe more fun to use than most other types of 
computers. So get ready to learn shortcuts, tips, and basic instructions for getting the most 
out of your Macintosh today.

Introduction
 What to Expect from this Book 
 Don’t expect to learn every possible feature available on a Macintosh. Also, don’t expect 
dense explanations that show how to do something without telling you why you might want 
to do it in the first place. 
 What you can expect from this book is a chance to learn how to use your Macintosh as 
quickly, easily, and painlessly as possible. 
 This book doesn’t have all the answers to using a Macintosh, but it does have lots of tips 
and tricks for helping you work faster and more efficiently than ever before. 
 Once you learn just enough to get started, you’ll feel more comfortable—until you’re able to 
figure out how to use your Macintosh all by yourself. Fair enough? If so, then turn the page 
and let’s get started.

 Part I 
 Basic Training 
 One of the biggest problems with learning anything new is knowing where to get started. 
In this part of the book, you’ll learn the most common commands for using the Macintosh-no 
matter what program you need to use. 
Y ou’ll learn how to
 give commands using a mouse, trackpad, and keyboard  
 start and stop programs  
 write and edit text  
 save your data in files that you can organize in different ways  
 By the time you’ve completed reading this part of the book, you should feel confident that 
you can use your Macintosh all by yourself.

 Chapter 1  
 Understanding OS X 
 Most computers tend to work in similar ways. By understanding how computers work in 
general, you can quickly learn how to use any particular type of computer now and in the 
future. 
 The monitor can show useful information such as stock quotes or news stories displayed on 
a web page. 
 The keyboard, mouse, or trackpad let you control the computer by typing text or 
manipulating items on the screen, such as editing a photograph. 
 Once you give commands to the computer, the processor calculates a new result and 
displays those changed results on the screen. 
 Using a computer is essentially a back and forth conversation where the computer shows 
information on the monitor and then waits for you to do something about it. You can use 
the keyboard, mouse, or trackpad to manipulate data on the screen, such as editing text or 
modifying a picture. Once you’ve given a command to the computer, it changes the data on 
the screen and shows the result so that you can do something else. 
 What makes every computer do something useful is software. By installing different 
programs, you can literally make the computer do practically anything you want. 
 People can use a  computer  to write letters, play games, draw cartoons, plot stock market 
prices, or edit movies. Software turns your computer into a versatile tool customized for your 
particular needs. 
 However, the most important software every computer needs is called an   operating system 
because it literally controls how the entire computer works. If you have a Mac, you use an 
operating system called   OS X . 
 OS X controls the physical parts of your Mac, such as sending data to a printer or accepting 
characters typed from the keyboard. To use a Mac, you need to learn how to use OS X.

CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 Don’t worry. You don’t need to learn technical details about OS X. Neither do you need to 
learn every possible feature of OS X. All you really need to know are the basics to using OS 
X so that you can do something useful with your Mac. 
 Why Computers Are So Difficult to Understand 
 In the early days of computers, you had to be a computer  expert  just to turn on a computer, 
let alone use it. Fortunately, computers have gotten much easier to use, thanks to the Mac, 
but in case you still feel computers are too hard to use, the reason is simple. 
 Computer programmers and engineers created and designed computers for themselves. 
 Think about how every field has its own jargon and way of thinking. Accountants know the 
meaning of terms like balance sheets, cash flow, and equity, while plumbers can easily 
understand terms like auger, closet bend, and dip tube. 
 If you’re not an accountant, you won’t understand common accounting terms. Likewise, if 
you’re not a plumber, you won’t understand common plumbing terms. 
 If you’re not a computer  expert  , you won’t understand common computer terms, and that’s 
why computers have always seemed so confusing and difficult to use. Most computer 
manuals are written by programmers for other programmers, using terms that they already 
understand. If you don’t understand common computer terms, you probably won’t be able 
to understand most computer manuals, help files, or other types of documentation that are 
supposed to help you but only tend to confuse and frustrate you even more. 
 Even worse, programmers already know how to use a computer, so they readily skip over 
steps, assume too much, and gloss over explanations. The actual steps to using a computer 
are often based on earlier, more primitive ways of using a computer. If you aren’t familiar 
with these earlier, more primitive ways of using a computer, you probably won’t completely 
understand why today’s computers work the way they do. 
 For example, the first  IBM PC came with a keyboard that combined a numeric keypad with 
cursor keys is shown in Figure  1-1 . If you wanted to use the numeric keypad, you had to 
press a special Num Lock key. If you wanted to move the cursor on the screen, you had to 
press the Num Lock key a second time to turn off the numeric keypad.  
 Note  If you’ve used another type of computer before, you probably used an operating system 
called Microsoft Windows. OS X works much the same way as Microsoft Windows, but it doesn’t 
work exactly like Microsoft Windows. If you’re used to the way Windows works, you need to relearn 
how to perform specific tasks using OS X. 

5
CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 Figure 1-1.   The keyboard of the original  IBM PC combined cursor keys with a numeric keypad 
 Figure 1-2.   IBM modified the keyboard to include a separate cursor keypad along with a second cursor/numeric keypad  
 How could you tell if the Num Lock key was on or off on the original  IBM PC keyboard? You 
couldn’t. You had to press a key on the numeric keypad, and if it typed a number, then you 
knew the Num Lock key was turned on. If it moved the cursor, then you knew the Num Lock 
key was turned off. 
 IBM later redesigned the keyboard to offer separate cursor keys and numeric keys. 
Inexplicably, the separate numeric keypad retained the Num Lock key, so it could double 
up as a cursor keypad as well. This meant you now had one dedicated cursor keypad and a 
second cursor/numeric keypad, as shown in Figure  1-2 . 
 Why would anyone ever turn off the Num Lock key to have two separate cursor key pads? 
No one would do this. Yet you can still see this horrible design in many PC keyboards 
even today. 
 Computer  manufacturers  often retain old features out of inertia and familiarity. Rather than 
question why certain features exist and eliminating outdated ones, computer people tend 
to keep old features and pile on new ones to create a confusing mess that only they can 
understand. 
 Just as computer people have retained obsolete hardware designs, so have they also 
retained obsolete software designs.

CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 In the old days, people used floppy disks, which were circular disks coated with magnetic 
material. These early floppy disks were 8 inches in size, but later shrank down to 5.25 inches 
and eventually to 3.5 inches in size, as shown in Figure  1-3 . They were called   floppy disks  
because they were disks and would flop up and down if they weren’t enclosed in a protective 
plastic case.  
 Figure 1-3.   Early computers stored data on 8-, 5.25-, and 3.5- inch  floppy disks 
 Figure 1-4.   Microsoft Word 2016 uses a floppy disk icon to represent the Save command 
 A 3.5-inch floppy  disk could only hold a maximum of 1.44 megabytes of data. Today, a 
single audio file of a popular song takes up more than 3 megabytes. Since  floppy disks  
weren’t able to store today’s larger files, they quickly fell out of popularity. That’s why you 
never see floppy disk drives used in any modern computer. 
 Yet if you look at the user interface of Microsoft Word 2016, you can still see that Microsoft 
uses a floppy disk icon to represent the Save command, as shown in Figure  1-4 . 
 Even though people haven’t used a floppy  disk in over a decade, and many newer computer 
users have never seen a floppy disk in their life, Microsoft and many other companies still 
use the floppy disk icon to represent the Save command.

CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 None of this makes sense unless you understand the historical origins. Even when you 
do understand the historical origins, it still doesn’t make any sense to cling to antiquated 
features and icons that no longer have any meaning. 
 That’s why computers have traditionally been so hard to understand—they force people to 
decipher obsolete ideas that increase confusion for no good reason. 
 Fortunately, OS X sheds many of these obsolete vestiges of computer history to make a 
Mac easier to use. OS X may not be perfect, but it eliminates much of the confusion that still 
clutters other operating systems.  
 Computers Are Designed for Experts, Not Beginners 
 Programmers create and design computers, so to better understand how any computer 
works, you need to understand how programmers think. Programmers tend to create 
multiple ways to perform the exact same command. For example, to save a file in almost any 
program, you typically have the following three ways to choose the same Save command:
  Click the File menu and choose Save  
  Click the Save icon  
  Press Command+S  
 Why do computers offer so many ways to perform the exact same command? It’s because 
programmers like shortcuts and options so that they can choose the way that they like best. 
 The drawback of so many options is that they tend to confuse beginners. Car manufacturers 
never give you three different ways to signal a left turn because that would just confuse 
drivers. Instead, car manufacturers give you one simple way to signal a left turn. Once 
you learn this one, simple way, you never have to relearn anything different or new to signal 
left turns. 
 Rather than simplifying computers, multiple options clutter the screen and get in the way, 
while at the same time making computers harder to use. Computer novices just want to 
learn one way to perform a task. Only computer experts care about using multiple shortcuts 
to perform the same task, so ultimately computers are designed to satisfy experts, not 
beginners.  
 Understanding the  Mac Philosophy  
 When Apple introduced the original Mac back in 1984, the goal was to make a powerful 
computer that was easy for non-computer experts to use. The Mac philosophy has always 
been about maximizing the user experience to make it as effortless as possible. That’s not 
always the case with other operating systems. 
 On Windows PC laptops, the trackpad displays a left and right mouse button so that you 
can give commands to the computer. On Mac laptops, pressing the trackpad lets you give 
commands to the computer. By eliminating extra buttons, Apple’s trackpads are not only 
more elegant in appearance, but also easier and simpler to use. 

8
CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 As a result of this design philosophy, the Mac hardware and its OS X operating system 
shields you from the technical complexity of using a computer. On a Windows PC, a single 
program often consists of dozens of files. If you accidentally delete one of these critical files, 
your program won’t work. Despite this danger, Windows displays all program files by default, 
increasing the chance that a novice will move, rename, or delete a file by mistake. 
 On a Mac, program files are hidden from view; so unless you specifically ask to see all 
the files that make up a single program, you’ll never see anything but a single icon that 
represents that entire program. This ensures that you can’t accidentally delete or move a 
program file by mistake. 
 Attention to details that protect the user makes the Mac and OS X much easier and safer to 
use. The goal of the Mac is to free you from maintaining and caring for a computer so that 
you can spend more time actually getting useful work done. 
 With a Windows 8 PC, scrolling the mouse button up and down moves the Windows 8 tiles 
left and right. If this sounds disorienting, confusing, and illogical, you’re right. In all versions 
of Windows, sliding your finger up on a trackpad moves the content of a window down, 
and sliding your finger down on a trackpad moves the content of a window up. This is like 
turning your left turn signal in a car to signal right and turning your right turn signal on to 
signal left. 
 On a Mac, sliding your finger up a trackpad moves the content of a window up, and sliding 
your finger down a trackpad moves the content of a window down. This more natural 
movement helps you better associate how the motion of your finger correlates to the motion 
of data displayed on the screen. 
 If you’ve never used a Mac before, you’ll find using OS X can feel natural and intuitive. 
If you’ve used a Windows PC before, you’ll find that a Mac running OS X can be more logical 
to understand and much simpler to use. 
 Just remember that when you learn anything for the first time, you’ll be clumsy and 
awkward. With a little practice, you become more proficient—until the day that you find 
yourself performing tasks without thinking. 
 Using a computer is a skill that anyone can learn and develop. The more you use a Mac, the 
more comfortable you become. The more comfortable you become, the more adventurous 
you become, and you’ll start exploring on your own. 
 Best of all, once you run into problems and learn how to fix them yourself, your confidence 
level starts increasing until the day comes that you won’t have any problems using a Mac 
at all.

CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 Understanding the  OS X Desktop  
 As you learned earlier, OS X is an operating system that controls the computer. OS X acts 
like an interpreter between you and your Mac. 
 First, OS X gets data from the computer and displays this information on the screen. If you 
select a command to manipulate the data on the screen, OS X obeys and then displays new 
information on the screen. Based on this new information, you can choose more commands. 
 OS X displays information on the screen and shows a list of commands that you can choose 
from; this is called the   user interface . The main OS X user interface is called the  desktop , 
which consists of the following three areas (also see Figure  1-5 ):
  Menu bar: Displays pull-down menus at the top of the screen  
  Desktop: Displays an image to fill the screen  
  Dock: Displays icons at the bottom of the screen  
 Figure 1-5.    The three areas of the OS X desktop 
 The menu bar always appears at the very top of the screen. By clicking the different titles in 
the menu bar, you see a list of the available commands that you can choose, as shown in 
Figure  1-6 . 
 

10
CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 Directly underneath the menu bar is the desktop wallpaper. The wallpaper fills most of 
the screen. The wallpaper can be any image that you like so that you can customize the 
appearance of your Mac. The desktop is also a place to store icons that represent data 
or programs. Placing icons on the desktop lets you find them easily. When you open a 
program, it opens and displays one or more windows that appear on the desktop. 
 At the bottom of the screen is the Dock, which offers an organized way to store icons. The 
Dock normally appears at the bottom of the screen, but you can make it appear on the left 
or right sides instead. 
 Typically, you can use the Dock to store your most frequently used programs; that way, you 
can find and run your favorite programs. 
 Every time that you use a Mac, you see the desktop, although the menu bar at the top of the 
screen may change, depending on which program you are running at the time.  
 Figure 1-6.   Clicking a title displays a pull-down menu 
 

11
CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 Using a  Keyboard 
 The whole purpose of the desktop is to give you access to any programs installed on your 
Mac. By itself, the desktop does nothing but display information on the screen and wait for 
you to choose a command. To choose a command displayed on the desktop, you have to 
use the keyboard and a mouse or trackpad. 
 The keyboard contains letters, numbers, and symbols (such as $, &, @, and #) that you can 
type. Besides these character keys, keyboards also contain the following additional sets of 
keys (also see Figure  1-7 ):
  Function keys  
  Cursor keys  
  Modifier keys  
 Figure 1-7.    The types of keys on a keyboard 
 Function keys  (located at the top of the keyboard) are another throwback to earlier 
computers. In the old days, many programs allowed you to give a command by pressing a 
function key. Pressing the F1 function key might display help, whereas pressing F10 might 
print data. 
 

12
CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 Nowadays, hardly any programs let you give commands by pressing a function key. That’s 
why most computers, including the Mac, now assign hardware controls to the  function  keys, 
as follows:
  F1: Reduce (or dim) screen brightness  
  F2: Increase screen brightness  
  F7: Rewind  
  F8: Play/Pause  
  F9: Fast-forward  
  F10: Mute  
  F11: Decrease volume  
  F12: Increase volume  
 Why do function keys still exist even though most programs completely ignore them? It’s 
because function keys can be used to create custom shortcuts in addition to maintaining 
compatibility with the handful of older programs that may still use function keys. 
 In general, most people never use function keys, but they exist for more advanced users. 
 The  cursor keys  consist of four arrows, which point up, down, left, or right.  Cursor keys  are 
most often used when typing and editing text. The cursor appears on the screen as a vertical 
line that blinks on and off to make it easy to find on the screen. 
 Whenever you type any keyboard characters, they appear wherever the cursor currently 
appears, as shown in Figure  1-8 . 
 Note  In the rare event that you need a function key, you need to hold down the Fn key (normally 
located at the bottom-left corner of the keyboard) and then press a function key. The Fn key tells 
your Mac to ignore any hardware controls assigned to a function key. 
 Figure 1-8.   The cursor lets you point where you want to edit text 
 Modifier keys  allow you to use ordinary keys in different ways. The most obvious modifier 
key is the Shift key. Holding down the Shift key while pressing a letter key creates an 
uppercase letter. Holding down the Shift key while pressing a number key on the top row 
creates a symbol, such as $ or #. 
 

13
CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 Three other  modifier keys  include Control, Option, and Command, which are often 
represented by symbols, as shown in Figure  1-9 . 
 Figure 1-9.   Modifier keys let you change the behavior of other keys 
 Modifier keys  are only used to change the behavior of other keys. In most programs, you 
can hold down the Command key, tap the S key, and let go of both to choose the Save 
command, which is often abbreviated as Command+S. 
 You can also use two modifier keys along with a third key to choose a command, such as 
holding down the Shift key, holding down the Command key, and tapping the N key, which is 
abbreviated as Shift+Command+N. 
 Modifier keys  let you choose commands through the keyboard. The most commonly used 
modifier key is the Command key. Beyond the Shift key, the other three modifier keys 
(Control, Option, and Command) are completely optional. It’s possible to use a Mac without 
ever touching any of these three modifier keys.  
 Using a Mouse or  Trackpad 
 Back in the early days of computers, all you could create on a computer was text, so a 
keyboard worked just fine. Of course, that meant computer-savvy people kept adding new 
features to the standard keyboard. That’s why you see function keys and modifier keys on 
computer keyboards. 
 When Apple introduced the Mac in 1984, it was the first personal computer that allowed 
people to create and edit graphics as well as text. How can you edit and manipulate 
graphics using cursor keys on a keyboard? You can’t. 
 That’s why the Mac comes with a mouse: so you can point on the screen. The screen always 
displays a pointer that lets you point and click on the screen. By moving the mouse on a flat 
surface, you can move the pointer on the screen. 
 A trackpad works exactly like a mouse. A trackpad lets you move the pointer on the screen 
by sliding your finger across the surface of the trackpad. 
 Laptops use a trackpad to save space, whereas desktops typically use a mouse. However, 
you can always add a trackpad to a desktop computer or a mouse to a laptop. Some people 
prefer a mouse, others prefer a trackpad, and some people even use both. 
 When you point to something on the screen, nothing happens until you click the mouse/
trackpad. Older mice had physical buttons that you could press. However, on Apple’s 
 mouse , there are no physical buttons. 
 

14
CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 Instead of clicking a physical button, an  Apple mouse  lets you press down on the top-left 
or top-right corners of the mouse with your finger. Pressing the top-left corner of an  Apple 
mouse represents the left button and pressing the top-right corner of an  Apple mouse  
represents the right button, as shown in Figure  1-10 . 
 Figure 1-10.   The top corners of the  Apple mouse represent the left and right buttons 
 Pressing the left button on a mouse is known as a  click or a  left-click . When you use a 
mouse, you typically use the left mouse button by pressing the top-left corner of the mouse 
and letting go. 
 Pressing the right button is known as a   right-click or a   secondary click . This action often 
displays a menu of options that pop up wherever the pointer happens to be, as shown in 
Figure  1-11 . 
 

15
CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 Since right-clicking is a shortcut, it’s possible to use a computer and never press the right 
button. Often times, you must specifically turn on this right-click/secondary click feature 
before you can use it, which you’ll learn to do later in this chapter. 
 With a trackpad, the entire surface acts like a button. To perform a left-click on a 
trackpad, just press your finger on the trackpad surface and lift up your finger. To perform a 
right-click/secondary click on a trackpad, press two fingers on the trackpad surface and lift 
up both fingers. 
 Pointing at something on the screen and then clicking it is the most common mouse/
trackpad task. To help you learn how to use a mouse or trackpad, try the following exercise:
 1. 
 Turn on your Mac by pressing its power button. (On an iMac or Mac 
mini, the power button is located on the back of the computer. On 
a laptop Mac, the power button is located in the upper-right corner 
of the keyboard.)  
 2. 
 Using the mouse or trackpad, move the mouse pointer over the 
Apple icon on the left side of the menu bar and then left-click (press 
the top-left corner of the mouse or press one finger on the trackpad). 
If you clicked the mouse/trackpad successfully, the Apple menu 
appears, as shown in Figure  1-12 . 
 Figure 1-11.   Right-clicking often displays a pop-up menu of commands

 3. 
 Move the mouse pointer over System Preferences and click the left 
mouse button or press one finger on the trackpad. If you clicked 
 System Preferences  correctly, a System Preferences window 
appears, as shown in Figure  1-13 . 
 Figure 1-12.    The Apple menu lets you customize your Mac

 4. 
 Point and click the Mouse or Trackpad icon in the second row 
from the top. Clicking the Mouse icon displays the Mouse window, 
as shown in Figure  1-14 . Clicking the Trackpad icon displays the 
Trackpad icon, as shown in Figure  1-15 .

 5. 
 Make sure that a check mark appears in the “Secondary click” 
check box. If not, click in the “Secondary click” check box to select 
it. (A check mark tells you that secondary click is turned on. An 
empty check box means that it is turned off.)  
 6. 
 Click the red dot in the upper corner of the Mouse or Trackpad 
window. This red dot represents the Close window command.  
 Congratulations! By using the mouse or trackpad in the preceding exercise, you’ve learned 
to customize your mouse or trackpad to allow secondary or right-clicking. 
 You also learned how to use the menu bar at the top of the screen and choose commands 
by pointing and clicking them with the mouse/trackpad. 
 To use OS X, you must learn how to point and click using a mouse/trackpad. Since pointing 
and clicking is such a crucial part of using OS X, the next chapter goes into more details on 
how to use a mouse/trackpad.

CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 How to Turn a Mac On and  Off 
 The most crucial lesson to learn is how to turn a Mac on and off. One reason why computers 
seem so confusing is that they don’t work the way you’d expect them to. When you have a 
blender, you turn it on by flicking a switch to the On position. Then to turn it off, you flick that 
same switch to the Off position. The same switch turns a blender on and off. 
 That’s not how computers work, which is part of the reason why computers can be so 
frustrating and confusing. To turn a Mac on, you press a button. On an iMac or Mac mini, the 
power button is in the back of the computer. That’s to keep you from pressing it by mistake 
and turning your computer off. 
 On a Mac laptop, the On switch is in the upper-right corner above the keyboard. This 
out-of-the-way location is also designed to keep you from pressing the button and turning 
your computer off by mistake. 
 If you want to use the power button to turn off your Mac, hold the power button for a few 
seconds until a message appears, asking if you want to shut the computer down. When this 
message appears, click the Shut Down button. 
 A more common way to turn a Mac off is to shut down OS X. When you shut down OS X, 
the operating system first checks if you have any unsaved data. If you do, OS X displays a 
message on the screen that asks if you want to save your data or not. Regardless of how 
you answer, OS X then makes sure that all files on your computer are closed before shutting 
off your Mac. This helps to avoid your data getting lost or scrambled. 
 Any time you want to turn off your Mac, you must first shut down OS X. To shut down OS X, 
follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon on the menu bar. A pull-down menu appears, 
as shown in Figure  1-16 .  
 Note   If you don’t turn on the secondary-click option, you can simulate a right-click by holding 
down the Control key and clicking the left mouse button or pressing one finger on the trackpad; 
then release both the mouse/trackpad and the Control key. 

21
CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 2. 
 Click Shut Down. If you have any unsaved data, OS X asks if you 
want to save it or not.  
 Always (yes, always) turn off your Mac using the Shut Down command. If you fail to use the 
Shut Down command, you could lose data.  
 Summary 
 Computers display information on the screen and wait for the user to choose a command to 
modify the information. To give commands to a computer, you have to use the keyboard and 
the mouse. Instead of a mouse, you may have a trackpad that mimics a mouse. 
 By moving the mouse or sliding your finger on the surface of a trackpad, you can move a 
pointer on the screen. Left-clicking (pressing down and letting go of the top-left corner of a 
mouse, or pressing one finger on a trackpad surface and letting go) selects something on 
the screen, such as a pull-down menu command. 
 A menu bar always appears at the top of the screen and allows you to point and click on a 
command. As a shortcut, you can often choose common commands by using modifier keys 
on the keyboard instead, such as the Shift, Control, Option, or Command keys. 
 OS X is an operating system that controls how your Mac works. Although OS X and the Mac 
try to make computers easier to use, you may still find some confusing features that don’t 
make any sense until you understand the original reason why they were used. 
 Figure 1-16.    The  Shut Down command in the Apple pull-down menu 
 

22
CHAPTER 1: Understanding OS X
 Most importantly, always (yes, always) turn your Mac off by clicking the Apple icon on the 
menu bar and then choosing the Shut Down command. The Shut Down command can help 
you avoid losing data, such as important business reports. 
 Remember, using a computer is a skill that you can always improve through practice. Don’t 
be afraid to experiment and play around with your Mac. The best way to learn anything is 
through constant practice and experimentation, until you feel more and more comfortable 
using your Mac.

 Chapter 2  
 Giving Commands with the 
Mouse, Trackpad, 
and Keyboard 
 To use OS X, you need to know how to point and click to choose commands. In addition, 
you need to know how to type and edit text. That means you need to know how to use 
keyboard and a mouse or a trackpad. 
 The  mouse/trackpad  is the main way to control a Mac. Once you understand how to move 
the pointer on the screen by moving the mouse (or sliding your finger across the trackpad 
surface), you need to know how to give commands to OS X. The following are the four basic 
tasks needed to perform commands through the mouse or trackpad:
  Hover 
  Click (also known as  left-click because you use the left mouse button)  
  Drag  
  Right-click (also known as  secondary click ) 
 Hovering  
 To  hover , or  hovering , means to move the pointer over something that appears on the 
screen. A common example of hovering is when you place the pointer over an icon and then 
wait a few seconds until a brief explanation of the icon’s purpose pops up. 
 By hovering the pointer over the icons in any program’s user interface, you can often learn 
the command that each icon represents. 

24
CHAPTER 2: Giving Commands with the Mouse, Trackpad, and Keyboard 
 Hovering lets you tell OS X this: “Do you see where the pointer is? Whatever appears 
underneath the pointer is what I want to choose.” 
 Pointing and  Clicking  
 The most common use for clicking is to choose a command. For example, if you move the 
pointer over the Apple icon on the menu bar and then click, you’re telling OS X, “I want to 
open the Apple menu.” 
 When the Apple menu appears, you can move the pointer over the System Preferences 
command and click again, which tells OS X, “Choose the System Preferences command.” When 
you choose the System Preferences command, the System Preferences window appears. 
 When you move the pointer over the Mouse or Trackpad icon in the System Preferences 
window and click, you tell OS X, “Show me the options that I can use to modify the mouse 
or trackpad.” 
 Within the Mouse or Trackpad window, you could point and click check boxes to select or 
disable features such as secondary click. 
 When you finish changing options for the mouse or trackpad, you can then point at the red 
button (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the Mouse or Trackpad window and click 
to close the window. 
 This point-and-click procedure is something that you use every time you use a Mac. The 
most common use for point-and-click is to choose a command from a menu or to choose an 
option in a window, such as clicking a button or a check box. 
 Pointing at something on the screen and then clicking it is the most common task that you’ll 
do with a mouse/trackpad. To practice pointing and clicking, try the following exercise to 
discover the type of Mac that you have and which version of OS X you are using:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon on the menu bar to display a pull-down menu.  
 2. 
 Point and click About This Mac. A window appears, as shown in 
Figure  2-1 . 
 Note  If you can’t see the pointer, jiggle the mouse (or slide your finger erratically across the 
trackpad surface). This temporarily enlarges the pointer so you can easily find it on the screen. 
 Note   Always make sure that you point at the correct item that you want to choose before clicking 
the mouse or trackpad. If you point at the wrong item and click, you won’t get the expected result, 
which will likely confuse and frustrate you. 

25
CHAPTER 2: Giving Commands with the Mouse, Trackpad, and Keyboard 
 3. 
 Click the Displays tab (see Figure  2-2 ). The window now lists the 
resolution of your monitor and the type of graphics processor inside 
your Mac.  
 Figure 2-1.   The Overview tab tells you the OS X version and the type of Mac that you’re using 
 Figure 2-2.   The Displays tab identifies information about your monitor and graphics processor 
 
 

26
CHAPTER 2: Giving Commands with the Mouse, Trackpad, and Keyboard 
 4. 
 Click the Storage tab (see Figure  2-3 ). The window now lists the 
storage capacity of your hard disk and any external hard disks 
connected to your Mac.  
 Note  If the memory in your Mac can be upgraded, you also see a Memory tab that lists which 
types of memory chips are plugged into the memory slots in your Mac. 
 Figure 2-3.   The Storage tab lets you see how much room your Mac has available on hard disk or solid-state storage 
 5. 
 Click the red close button (the red dot in the upper-left corner of the 
window) to close the window.  
 

27
CHAPTER 2: Giving Commands with the Mouse, Trackpad, and Keyboard 
 Notice that by pointing and clicking with the mouse or trackpad, you can perform common 
tasks like choosing menu commands, opening and closing a window, and choosing options 
inside that window. 
 In this case, you learned how to open the About This Mac window to identify the different 
features of your Mac.  
 Dragging  
 The mouse and trackpad are most commonly used for pointing and clicking to select commands 
and options. The second-most common use for the mouse and trackpad is  dragging . 
 Dragging involves the following three  steps  :
 1. 
 Move the pointer over the object that you want to manipulate.  
 2. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or keep your finger pressed on the 
trackpad).  
 3. 
 Move the mouse (or hold your finger down on the trackpad and slide 
it around).  
 Dragging is most often used to move something on the screen such as a window, a picture, 
or a chunk of text. For novices, dragging might initially feel awkward since you need to hold 
down the left mouse button while moving the mouse (or keep your finger pressed down 
while moving your fingertip across the trackpad surface), so here’s a simple exercise to let 
you practice dragging. 
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon on the menu bar to display a pull-down menu.  
 2. 
 Choose (point and click) About This Mac. The About This Mac 
window appears.  
 3. 
 Move the pointer over the gray area (called the  title bar ) near the top 
of the window, as shown in Figure  2-4 . 
 Note   To move anything on the screen with the mouse or trackpad, make sure that you select it 
first. That means positioning the pointer exactly over the object that you want to move. If the pointer 
isn’t over the object that you want to move, then dragging won’t do anything but move the pointer. 

28
CHAPTER 2: Giving Commands with the Mouse, Trackpad, and Keyboard 
 4. 
 Hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse (or press the 
trackpad surface and move your finger). Holding down the left mouse 
button or pressing the trackpad surface while moving the mouse 
or your finger at the same time is called  dragging . Notice that the 
window moves wherever you move the pointer.  
 5. 
 Release the left mouse button, or lift your finger off the trackpad, 
when you’re happy with the position of the About This Mac window.  
 6. 
 Click the red button (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the 
About This Mac window to make it disappear.  
 Remember, when dragging the mouse (or trackpad), keep the left mouse button or finger 
pressed down on the trackpad. If you lift up your finger too soon, OS X stops moving your 
selected object on the screen.  
 Right-Clicking (or Secondary Clicking)  
 Right-clicking (also known as  secondary clicking ) is used far less often. In fact, it’s possible 
to use a Mac without ever using the right-click or secondary click command at all, which is 
why some Mac computers have secondary clicking turned off. 
 However, right-clicking offers shortcuts to common commands. To right-click, first move the 
pointer over the object that you want to manipulate. Then choose the right-click command in 
one of the following ways:
  (Mouse) Press and release the right mouse button  
  (Trackpad) Press and release two fingers on the surface of the trackpad  
  (Mouse or trackpad) Hold down the Control key and then press and release 
the left mouse button (or press and release one finger on the trackpad)  
 Figure 2-4.   The title bar of a window appears as a gray band near the top 
 

29
CHAPTER 2: Giving Commands with the Mouse, Trackpad, and Keyboard 
 When you right-click over an item, a pop-up menu appears, showing you a list of commands 
for manipulating the object that the pointer currently appears on. So if you right-click a 
picture, you only see a pop-up menu of commands for manipulating pictures, as shown in 
Figure  2-5 . 
 Figure 2-5.   Right-clicking over an  image displays a pop-up menu of image manipulation commands 
 

30
CHAPTER 2: Giving Commands with the Mouse, Trackpad, and Keyboard 
 Figure 2-6.   Right-clicking  over selected text displays a pop-up menu of text manipulation commands 
 Figure 2-7.   Right-clicking over the  desktop  displays a pop-up menu of commands for manipulating the desktop 
 If you right-click over selected text, you only see a pop-up menu of commands for 
manipulating text, as shown in Figure  2-6 . 
 To see how right-clicking can display a pop-up menu of commands, try the following exercise:
 1. 
 Move the pointer anywhere over the desktop wallpaper image.  
 2. 
 Click the right mouse button (or press two fingers on the trackpad 
surface) and lift up your fingers. A pop-up menu appears, as shown 
in Figure  2-7 . 
 
 

31
CHAPTER 2: Giving Commands with the Mouse, Trackpad, and Keyboard 
 3. 
 Click the Change Desktop Background command. The Desktop & 
Screen Saver window appears.  
 4. 
 Click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the 
Desktop & Screen Saver window to make it disappear.  
 Let’s see how to find the Change Desktop Background command without right-clicking. 
It takes the same number of steps, but notice how you need to hunt around to finally find it.
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon on the menu bar at the top of the screen. 
A pull-down menu appears.  
 2. 
 Click System Preferences. The System Preferences window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon. The Desktop & Screen Saver 
window appears.  
 4. 
 Click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the 
Desktop & Screen Saver window to make it disappear.  
 Both methods work, but right-clicking saves you the time of hunting around the screen, 
looking for the right commands to choose. Just remember that right-clicking may not always 
display a commands pop-up menu for everything that the pointer appears over.  
 Using the  Keyboard 
 The keyboard is mostly used to create and edit text. Beyond the normal character keys that 
let you type letters, numbers, and symbols, the two other types of keys on the keyboard are 
the cursor keys and the modifier keys. 
 The  cursor keys  let you move the cursor up, down, left, or right within text. Occasionally, you 
can also use the cursor keys to move objects on the screen after you have selected them. 
 The  modifier keys  are used to change the behavior of another key, such as the S or O key. 
Pressing a modifier key along with another key lets you access keystroke shortcuts for 
common commands. 
 The most common modifier key is the Command key. The following are the most common 
keystroke shortcuts that work in nearly every OS X program:
  Command+N: The New command  
  Command+O: The Open command  
  Command+P: The Print command  
  Command+S: The Save command  
 The advantage of  keystroke shortcuts  is that they let you choose a command quickly, 
without wasting time looking for the command in a pull-down menu. The disadvantage is 
that you must memorize the keystrokes to choose your favorite commands. 

32
CHAPTER 2: Giving Commands with the Mouse, Trackpad, and Keyboard 
 To help you find  keystroke shortcuts  for common commands, just look at the commands 
in any pull-down menu. The most common commands in each pull-down menu show the 
keystroke shortcuts to the right of the command, as shown in Figure  2-8 . 
 Figure 2-8.    Almost every pull-down menu lists  keystroke shortcuts 
 Keep in mind that the same  keystroke shortcuts  may not work the same in every program. 
In the Finder program shown in Figure  2-8 , for example, you can press Shift+Command+N 
to choose the New Folder command, but if you press Shift+Command+N in another 
program, nothing at all may happen. 
 

33
CHAPTER 2: Giving Commands with the Mouse, Trackpad, and Keyboard 
 The most common  keystroke shortcuts  only use two keys, such as Command+S. The less 
common keystroke shortcuts use three or more keys, such as Control+Shift+Command+T. 
 To see how  keystroke shortcuts  work, try the following exercise:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock, as shown in Figure  2-9 . 
 Figure 2-9.   The Finder icon appears on the left side of the Dock at the bottom of the screen 
 2. 
 Hold down the Command key and tap the N key (Command+N). 
Release both keys. This chooses the New Finder Window command, 
which opens another Finder window on the screen.  
 3. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Finder Window. Notice that this 
opens another Finder window on the screen.  
 4. 
 Click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner of each 
Finder window to make it disappear.  
 For commonly used commands, it’s much faster to memorize and use keystroke shortcuts. 
For less commonly used commands, it’s easier to use pull-down menus rather than trying to 
memorize obscure keystroke combinations.  
 Summary 
 The three ways to control your computer involve the mouse, trackpad, and keyboard. 
Most desktops use the mouse, whereas most laptops use the trackpad, but it’s possible to 
use both. 
 The four commands for using a mouse or trackpad are hover, click, drag, and right-click. 
 Hover means moving the pointer over something on the screen, such as an icon, which 
usually displays a brief explanation of the command that the icon represents. 
 Clicking means pressing and releasing the left mouse button once, or pressing and releasing 
your finger on the trackpad surface. 
 Dragging means holding down the left mouse button while moving the mouse, or pressing 
one finger on the trackpad while sliding your fingertip across the trackpad surface. 
 Right-clicking means pressing and releasing the right mouse button once, or pressing and 
releasing two fingers on the trackpad surface. 
 

34
CHAPTER 2: Giving Commands with the Mouse, Trackpad, and Keyboard 
 Right-clicking displays a pop-up menu of common commands for manipulating the object 
that the pointer currently appears on. 
 The keyboard offers modifier keys to choose shortcuts. The most common modifier key is 
the Command key. 
 Make sure that you feel comfortable using the mouse to click and drag. Right-clicking is 
optional but it can make using OS X much easier. 
 To find common keystroke shortcuts, look in the different pull-down menus of your favorite 
programs. Just remember that each program may use different keystroke shortcuts to 
choose the same commands. 
 Once you get comfortable giving commands to your Mac through the mouse/trackpad and 
keyboard, you’re ready to start exploring and customizing the different features of OS X.

 Chapter 3  
 Running Programs 
 The only reason to use OS X is to run programs (also called  applications or  apps ) on your 
Mac. Some common types of applications include word processors, games, browsers, 
spreadsheets, databases, and painting or drawing programs. By installing different 
applications, you can make your Mac perform a variety of different tasks. 
 Most people really care about OS X running the applications they need. By just installing the 
right application, you can turn your Mac into the right tool for your needs. 
 Although you’ll likely buy additional programs or applications to install on your Mac, you 
might be pleasantly surprised to find that every Mac comes with plenty of free apps that you 
can use right away. The following are some of the types of apps that come free with OS X:
 Office suite programs (word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation 
programs)  
 Personal productivity programs (calendar, contacts, notes, reminders, 
and stickies)  
 Utility programs  
 Office suite programs  let you create letters, balance budgets, or make slide show 
presentations for work, school, or personal use. 
 Personal productivity programs  let you save personal information such as appointments, 
short ideas you don’t want to forget, and names and contact information of friends and 
business associates. 
 Utility programs  let you examine and maintain your hard disk, capture screen images, record 
audio, and manage files. 
 You can run one or more programs at the same time, depending on how much memory your 
Mac has. The more memory it has, the more programs you can run simultaneously. The main 
reason to have two or more programs open at the same time is so that you can share data 
between them or quickly switch between programs. For example, you can copy text from a 
browser and paste it in a word processor document. 

36
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 Generally, you’ll want to run a program as long as you need it and then shut it down when 
you’re finished with it. So the main steps to using any program are as follows:
 1. 
 Launch the program.  
 2. 
 Use the program.  
 3. 
 Quit the program.  
 Remember that there are usually multiple ways of doing anything with a computer. So when 
you learn two or more ways to perform the same task, just choose the method you like best 
and feel free to ignore the other methods. 
 Finding a  Program 
 Before you can use any program, you have to find it. Almost every program is stored in a 
special location called the   Applications folder (see Figure  3-1 ). Each program appears as a 
colorful icon along with a descriptive name to help you identify it. You can find any program 
by looking for either its name or icon.  

37
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 To see a list of programs stored on a Mac, you need to use a special program called the  Finder . 
 Since the Finder is so important in helping you locate other programs, it always appears on 
the left side of the Dock, as shown in Figure  3-2 . 
 Figure 3-1.   Every program consists of a descriptive name and icon 
 Figure 3-2.    The  Finder icon appears on the Dock 
 
 

38
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 To view the contents of the Applications folder, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder menu bar appears at 
the top of the screen.  
 2. 
 Do one of the following:
 Click the Go menu and click Applications (Go ➤ Applications).  
 Press Shift+Command+A on the keyboard.  
 Open a Finder window and click Applications in the left pane, as shown in 
Figure  3-3 . 
 Figure 3-3.    The  Applications folder appears in the left pane of the Finder window 
 3. 
 Move the pointer over the program icon that you want to run and use 
one of the following methods to start the program:
 Click to select the program icon and then choose File ➤ Open (click the File 
menu and then click Open).  
 Click to select the program icon and then press Command+O.  
 Left-click twice in rapid succession (known as  double-clicking ).  
 Right-click the program icon and when a pop-up menu appears, choose 
Open, as shown in Figure  3-4 . 
 

39
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 Notice that when you launch a program, its program icon appears on the Dock. After you 
quit the program, its icon disappears from the Dock. When a program is running, OS X 
displays a dot underneath that program’s icon. If a program isn’t running, the dot won’t 
appear at all, as shown in Figure  3-5 . 
 Figure 3-4.   Right-clicking a program icon displays a pop-up menu 
 Figure 3-5.   Dots appear underneath the icons of currently running programs 
 
 

40
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 Double-clicking a program icon is the most common way to start a program. When 
double-clicking, make sure that you click the left mouse button (or press one finger on the 
trackpad surface) twice in rapid succession. If you click too slowly, your Mac interprets it as 
two single-clicks, which won’t start the program. 
 Of course, constantly having to open the Applications folder, hunt around for the program 
icon that you want to load, and double-clicking the program icon can be annoying, so 
OS X offers another way to start a program. To give you one-click access to your favorite 
programs, you can put a program icon on the Dock.  
 Using the Dock 
 The Dock holds your most commonly used program icons in one place so that you can find 
and click them quickly and easily. The Dock can appear on the bottom, left, or right side of 
the screen. Once a program icon appears on the Dock, you can start that program just by 
clicking its icon once. 
 OS X automatically displays some program icons on the Dock, but you can always add your 
own program icons or remove any existing icons. 
 Just remember that the more program icons you add to the Dock, the smaller each icon will 
appear, so it’s best to include only those program icons that you use most often. 
 Adding Program Icons to the Dock  
 The Dock likely won’t include all of your favorite program icons, so you’ll need to add them 
to the Dock manually. There are two ways to add a program icon to the Dock:
 Drag a program icon from the Applications folder to the Dock  
 Start a program within the Applications folder so that it automatically 
appears on the Dock, and then lock the icon on the Dock  
 To drag a program icon to the Dock, follow these steps.
 1. 
 Open the Applications folder in the Finder window.  
 2. 
 Move the pointer over a program icon and drag the icon on the 
Dock. As soon as you drag a program icon to the Dock, the existing 
program icons make room for it, as shown in Figure  3-6 . 

41
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 3. 
 Release the mouse or trackpad when the program icon is on the 
Dock. Your chosen program icon now appears on the Dock.  
 Dragging a program icon is handy, but if you’ve already started a program, its icon 
automatically appears on the Dock anyway. You can choose to keep a program icon on the 
Dock by following these steps:
 1. 
 Start a program by opening it from the Applications folder. When you 
start a program, its program icon appears on the Dock with a dot 
underneath it.  
 2. 
 Right-click the program icon on the Dock. A pop-up menu appears.  
 3. 
 Choose Options ➤ Keep in Dock, as shown in Figure  3-7 (in other 
words, click Options and then click Keep in Dock). Once a check 
mark appears in front of the Keep in Dock command, the program 
icon will always appear in the Dock. If a check mark does not 
appear in front of the Keep in Dock command, the program icon will 
disappear from the Dock when you quit running the program.

CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 Rearranging Icons on the  Dock 
 You can move any icon on the Dock to a new location just by dragging it with the mouse or 
trackpad. To move an icon to a different location on the Dock, follow these steps:
 1. 
 On the Dock, move the pointer over the program icon that you want 
to move. 
 2. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or hold a finger down on the 
trackpad surface).  
 3. 
 Slide the mouse (or finger on the trackpad) to move the program 
icon. As you drag the program icon, you’ll see the other program 
icons slide out of the way.  
 4. 
 Release the mouse (or trackpad) when the program icon is in the 
location that you want.  
 Removing Icons from the  Dock 
 Once you’ve added and arranged a program icon on the Dock, you can always remove it 
if you later find that you don’t use that program often enough. To remove an icon from the 
Dock, follow these steps:
 1. 
 On the Dock, move the pointer over the program icon that you want 
to remove.  
 2. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or hold a finger down on the 
trackpad surface).  
 Note   The Finder icon is the only program icon on the Dock that you can’t remove or move to a 
different position. That makes it easy to find the Finder icon at all times. 
 Figure 3-7.   Right-clicking a program icon that’s currently running displays a pop-up menu 
 

43
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 3. 
 Slide the mouse (or finger on the trackpad) to move the program icon 
up and away from the Dock until you see a Remove label appear 
above the program icon, as shown in Figure  3-8 . 
 Figure 3-8.   Dragging an icon up from the Dock lets you remove it 
 4. 
 Release the mouse (or trackpad). Your chosen program icon 
disappears.  
 Remember, once you remove a program icon from the Dock, you can still find and run 
that program in the Applications folder. Removing a program icon from the Dock does not 
physically delete a program from your Mac. 
 Think of the Dock as a shortcut to your favorite programs. If you can’t find a particular 
program icon on the dock, look in the Applications folder. If you can’t find a particular 
program in the Applications folder, it may be stored somewhere else on the Mac or it may 
not be installed at all.  
 Using a  Program 
 Each time you run a program, three things happen:
 The program icon appears on the Dock  
 A dot appears underneath the program icon on the Dock to let you know 
that the program is running  
 The program’s menu bar appears at the top of the screen  
 Besides the dot appearing underneath the program icon on the Dock, a second way to 
identify the currently running program is to look on the menu bar. 
 To the right of the Apple icon on the menu bar, you’ll always see the Application menu title, 
which displays the currently active program’s name, as shown in Figure  3-9 . 
 

44
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 The currently active program is the one program that will accept anything you type on the 
keyboard. Remember, you can have multiple programs running at once, but you can only 
use one program at a time. No matter how many programs you may be running at the same 
time, you’ll always have one program that’s active, which you can identify by looking for its 
name in the Application menu title. 
 Most programs display a window that contains information. A word processor window might 
contain text, a game might contain animation, and a drawing program might contain lines 
and shapes. When you have multiple programs running, you’ll often have multiple windows 
on the OS X desktop, as shown in Figure  3-10 . 
 Figure 3-9.   The Application menu title always changes to identify the currently active program 
 Figure 3-10.   A typical Mac may have multiple windows on the desktop 
 
 

45
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 Moving Windows  
 Program windows can fill either the entire screen or just part of the screen. When program 
windows only fill part of the screen, you can easily view data in multiple windows, side by 
side. For example, you can have a word processor window open so that you can write, 
while you have a browser window open so that you can look up and reference information as 
you write. 
 Many programs also let you open two or more windows. For example, you could open two 
windows in a word processor; that way, you could edit two documents at the same time, 
such as two chapters in a book. 
 When program windows fill only part of the screen, you can move them around as shown in 
Figure  3-11 by following these steps:
 1. 
 Move the pointer over the title bar of the window that you want to 
move. The title bar typically appears as a colored (often gray) area at 
the top of the window.  
 2. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or press a finger on the trackpad 
surface). Keep the left mouse button or trackpad pressed down.  
 3. 
 Move the mouse or slide your fingertip across the trackpad surface. 
Steps 2 and 3 are known as  dragging . As you drag the mouse or 
trackpad, the window moves with the pointer.  
 4. 
 Release the left mouse button (or lift your finger off the trackpad) 
when you’re happy with the new position of the window.  
 Figure 3-11.   Dragging the title bar of a window moves it to a new location on the screen 
 

46
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 When you only have a few windows on the screen, it can be easy to see what each window 
contains. However, having multiple windows on the screen can make everything look 
cluttered and confusing. 
 To avoid getting overwhelmed by seeing so many program windows on the screen, you have 
two options. First, you can resize a window to make it fill most of the screen. Second, you 
can hide windows so that you can focus only on the windows of one program. 
 By filling most of the screen or hiding the other windows, you can focus on the contents of 
the windows you want to see without distraction.  
 Resizing Windows  
 OS X provides several ways to resize a window:
 Click the full size window button (the green dot in the upper-left corner 
of the window, as shown in Figure  3-12 ) 
 Figure 3-12.    The full screen window button 
 Drag the sides or corners of a window to enlarge or shrink it  
 Choose Window ➤ Zoom (click the Window menu and then click Zoom)  
 In the upper-left corner of every window, you see the following three buttons:
 Red: Closes the window  
 Yellow: Minimizes the window  
 Green: Displays the window to fill the entire screen  
 The red button closes the window. If you haven’t saved the content of the program, OS X 
asks if you want to save the data. (Some programs, such as utility programs, don’t create 
data, so you can close their windows without worrying about saving or losing data). 
 The yellow button temporarily hides a window. This is useful when you want to view certain 
windows without closing other windows. 
 The green button expands a window to full screen. Full screen mode even hides the menu 
bar from sight so that you have more space to see the actual contents of the window. If you 
need to access the menu bar, just move the pointer to the top of the screen with the mouse 
or trackpad. 
 

47
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 Once a window completely fills a screen, you can shrink that window by moving the pointer 
to the top of screen to make the menu bar and the red, yellow, and green buttons appear in 
the upper-left corner. Click the green button again to shrink the window. 
 To see how the full screen (green) button works, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the green button in the upper-left corner of the Finder window. 
The Finder window expands to fill the entire screen.  
 3. 
 Move the mouse pointer to the top of the screen so that the Finder 
menu bar and the red, yellow, and green buttons appear.  
 4. 
 Click the green button in the upper-left corner. The Finder window 
shrinks back to fill part of the screen.  
 The ability to expand a window to full screen and then back to normal size works on every 
window. When you want to avoid distractions, expand a window to full size. 
 A second way to resize a window is to drag a corner or edge of the window with the mouse 
or trackpad. To do this, first move the pointer over the edge or corner of any window until 
the pointer turns into a two-way arrow, as shown in Figure  3-13 . 
 Note  Each time that you click the green button, it toggles between expanding a window to full 
screen and shrinking a full screen window back to a smaller size. 

48
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 Second, hold down the left mouse button (or press a finger on the trackpad). 
 Third, as you move the mouse (or slide your finger across the trackpad surface), the window 
edge shrinks or enlarges the window. 
 The combination of moving and manually resizing a window with the mouse or trackpad can 
be convenient for aligning two or more windows next to each other. 
 For a faster way to resize a window, you can click the Window menu title and then choose 
Zoom (Window ➤ Zoom). This command toggles a window to enlarge or shrink it.  
 Switching Windows  
 When you have multiple programs open, you can switch from working in one program 
to another. If a single program displays two or more windows (such as a word processor 
displaying two or more documents), you can switch to different windows within the same 
program. 
 To switch windows, you can do one of the following:
 Click in another window visible on the screen  
 Click another program icon that has a dot underneath it on the Dock  
 Figure 3-13.   When the two-way arrow appears, you can drag to resize the window 
 

49
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 Figure 3-14.   Right-clicking a program icon on the Dock displays a menu of all currently open files 
 Remember, when you switch to another program’s window, the menu bar changes to display 
that program’s menu bar. So if you’re using Microsoft Word, you’ll see the Word menu bar at 
the top of the screen. Then if you switch to Safari, you’ll see the Safari menu bar at the top 
of the screen. 
 If you have multiple windows open in the same program, you can switch to a different 
window in same program by doing one of the following:
 Click the Window menu and click the file name (this only switches to 
another window in the same program)  
 Right-click the program icon on the Dock, and when the pop-up menu 
appears, click the file that you want, as shown in Figure  3-14 
 Hiding Windows  
 Having multiple windows open in one or more programs lets you quickly switch from one file 
to another. The biggest problem is that the more windows you have open, the more cluttered 
your screen will look. 
 One option is to close a window, but if you just want to tuck it temporarily out of sight, it’s 
easier to hide the window instead. OS X gives you three ways to hide windows:
 Click the Application menu title on the menu bar and choose Hide 
(program name), or press Command+H to hide all windows in the 
currently active program  
 Right-click any program icon on the Dock that has a dot under it, and 
when a pop-up menu appears, choose Hide to hide all windows in the 
currently active program  
 Click the Application menu title on the menu bar and choose Hide 
Others, or press Option+Command+H to hide all windows except the 
currently active program  
 

50
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 Once you hide a window, you’ll eventually want to make it visible again. To unhide or show a 
hidden window, you have two options:
 Right-click the program icon on the Dock that has a dot under it, and 
when a pop-up menu appears, choose Show (to show any hidden 
windows from that program icon)  
 Click the Application menu title on the menu bar and choose Show All 
(to show all hidden windows from all programs)  
 Hiding windows is one way to ease the clutter of multiple open windows. To see how hiding 
windows can work, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the Safari icon on the Dock to open a window in Safari.  
 3. 
 Manually move and resize the open windows so that you can see 
both of them on the screen.  
 4. 
 Click in one window. Notice that the title bar of the active window 
(the window currently displaying the cursor) appears darker, while 
the title bar of the other window appears dimmed. Also notice that 
the active window’s program name appears in the menu bar, such as 
Finder or Safari.  
 5. 
 Click in the other program window. Notice that the title bar of this 
window now appears darker, while the title bar of the other window 
appears dimmed. Also notice that a different program name now 
appears in the menu bar.  
 6. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. Notice that the Finder window title 
bar now appears darker and the menu bar now displays Finder next 
to the Apple icon.  
 7. 
 Click the Safari icon on the Dock. Notice that the Safari window title 
bar now appears darker and the menu bar now displays Safari next 
to the Apple icon.  
 8. 
 Right-click the Finder icon on the Dock to display a pop-up menu.  
 9. 
 Click Hide. Notice that this hides the Finder window. If you had 
multiple Finder windows open, all of them would be hidden.  
 10. 
 Right-click the Safari icon on the Dock to display a pop-up menu.  
 11. 
 Click Hide. Notice that this hides the Safari window. If you had 
multiple Safari windows open, all of them would be hidden.  
 12. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder name appears next to 
the Apple icon on the menu bar.  
 13. 
 Click Finder on the menu bar and then click Show All (Finder ➤ 
Show All). OS X displays all program windows on the screen again.  

51
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 Figure 3-15.    A minimized window appears on the Dock 
 14. 
 Click Finder on the menu bar and then click Hide Others (Finder ➤ 
Hide Others). Notice that only the Finder window remains visible, 
whereas the Safari window is hidden.  
 15. 
 Click Finder on the menu bar and then click Show All (Finder ➤ 
Show All). Notice that the Safari window appears again.  
 Minimizing  Windows  
 Hiding windows makes them disappear, but it’s not easy knowing which windows are hidden. 
The only way you can find a hidden window is to choose the Show All command from any 
application title menu, such as Finder ➤ Show All or Safari ➤ Show All. As an alternative to 
completely hiding a window, OS X gives you the option to minimize a window instead. 
 When you minimize a window, it appears on the Dock next to the Trash icon, as shown in 
Figure  3-15 . 
 Each time that you minimize a window, it appears as an icon on the Dock. To minimize a 
window, you have three options:
 Click the yellow button (the minimize button) in the upper-left corner of 
the window that you want to minimize  
 Click the window that you want to minimize and press Command+M  
 Click the window that you want to minimize, click the Window menu, 
and choose Minimize (Window ➤ Minimize)  
 Once you’ve minimized a window, you can open it again by clicking its icon on the Dock. 
To see how this works, try the following:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Choose a way to minimize the Finder window, such as pressing 
Command+M, choosing Window ➤ Minimize, or clicking the yellow 
minimize button in the upper-left corner of the Finder window. Notice 
that the window shrinks to appear as an icon on the Dock.  
 3. 
 Click the minimized window icon on the Dock. Notice that the 
window now appears back on the screen again.  
 Minimizing windows can be handy for temporarily tucking one or two windows out of sight, 
but if you minimize too many windows, their icons will take up room on the Dock.  
 

52
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 Closing Windows  
 Hiding or minimizing windows tucks them out of sight but keeps them ready to view again. 
However, if you don’t need a window any more, it’s best to close it completely. 
 OS X offers three ways to close a window:
 Click the red button (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the window  
 Click the window that you want to close and press Command+W  
 Click the window that you want to minimize, click the File menu, 
and choose Close (File ➤ Close)  
 If you haven’t saved the data in the window you want to close, you’ll see a dialog message 
asking if you want to save the data or not.  
 Using Mission  Control 
 If you have multiple programs running at the same time, you’ll likely have numerous windows 
open on the desktop. Unfortunately, opening too many windows will likely bury some open 
windows underneath other open windows. Even though a window may be open, you may 
not see it on the screen. 
 To solve this problem, OS X offers a feature called Mission Control, which helps display open 
windows in one of two ways:
 Displays all open program windows as miniature windows on the 
screen, as shown in Figure  3-16 
 Displays only open windows belonging to a single program  
 Figure 3-16.   Mission Control shows you all the currently open windows 
 

53
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 Figure 3-17.   Mission Control can show only a program’s currently open windows 
 To display all open program windows, hold down the Control key and press the Up arrow 
key (Control+Up arrow). (If you have a trackpad, swipe three fingers up to display all open 
program windows.) 
 At this point, you can click any window to switch to that particular window. If you just want 
to go back to the window that you previously were using, do one of the following to exit out 
of Mission Control:
 Press Control+Up arrow  
 Press Esc  
 The more open windows you have, the more cluttered your Mission Control display will look. 
To reduce the number of windows Mission Control displays, you can choose to only display 
windows from one program at a time. 
 For example, if you have three open windows in Microsoft Word, Mission Control can display 
just those three Microsoft Word windows. If you have two open windows in the Finder, 
Mission Control can display just those two Finder windows, as shown in Figure  3-17 . 
 To use Mission Control to open the windows of one particular program, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click a program icon on the Dock.  
 2. 
 Press Control+Down arrow. Mission Control only displays the open 
windows for the program you selected in step 1.  
 3. 
 Click any open window to select it, or press Esc or Control+Down 
arrow to exit out of Mission Control.  
 

54
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 By using Mission Control, you can easily select a different open window no matter how 
many open windows you have. As a general rule, close any window if you don’t need it right 
away. This helps reduce the number of windows on the screen and keeps your screen from 
looking cluttered and confusing.  
 Quitting a  Program 
 When you close a window, the program that opened it continues running. That gives you the 
option to open other windows in that program. When you no longer want to use a particular 
program, you can exit or quit out of that program. 
 To quit any program, you have three options:
 Click the application menu title (such as Safari) and choose Quit (such 
as Safari ➤ Quit Safari)  
 Press Command+Q  
 Right-click the program icon on the Dock, and when the pop-up menu 
appears, choose Quit  
 Because it’s a part of OS X that’s always running, the Finder is the only program that you 
cannot quit. 
 Summary 
 The Mac operating system, OS X, runs all the time. To run other programs, you can double-
click (click twice in rapid succession) a program icon in the Applications folder. As a 
shortcut, you can place program icons on the Dock so that you can get quick access to your 
favorite programs in one click. 
 You can open as many programs as you wish. Each time that you open a program, it displays 
a window with data that you can manipulate. A single program can open multiple windows. 
 You can manually move and resize windows, or choose various commands to make a 
window fill the screen, hide from view, or appear as a minimized icon on the Dock. Hiding and 
minimizing windows makes it easy to keep too many windows from cluttering the screen. 
 If you’re done with certain data, you can close the window displaying that data. If you 
haven’t saved your data, a dialog message will ask if you want to save the data or not. 
 Only one program can run at a time. You can identify the currently active program (the 
program that currently displays the cursor in one of its windows) by looking at the menu bar. 
The name of the currently active program appears to the right of the Apple icon on the menu 
bar, such as Safari or Finder. 
 Note   If you haven’t saved data in any open program windows that you try to quit, a dialog 
message will ask if you want to save your data or not. 

55
CHAPTER 3: Running Programs
 When you have multiple windows open, you can switch between multiple programs by 
clicking a window belonging to another program, or by clicking a program icon displayed on 
the Dock. Any program icon on the Dock that has a dot underneath it is currently running. 
 By using Mission Control, you can view and select any currently open window. The 
Control+Up arrow command displays all open windows, whereas the Control+Down arrow 
command only displays the currently selected program’s open windows. 
 To quit a program, you can choose the application menu title (such as Safari) and then 
choose Quit, or press Command+Q. If you haven’t saved any data, you’ll see a dialog 
message asking if you want to save your data or not. 
 By letting you run multiple programs at the same time and display multiple windows from 
each program, OS X lets you share data between programs or view data from two or more 
different programs so that you can work more effectively, no matter what you need to do 
with your Mac.

 Chapter 4  
 Typing and Editing Text  
 Most people use a computer to type text to write letters, reports, blog posts, or messages. 
Since typing text (letters, numbers, and symbols) is so common, you need to know how to 
type and edit text no matter what type of program you use. 
 The basics of typing and editing text include knowing the following:
 How to type text, including unusual symbols such as foreign 
language characters  
 How to select text  
 How to copy, move, and delete text  
 Before you can type text, you need to move the cursor where you want that text to appear. 
The cursor shows you exactly where the text will appear the moment that you start typing. 
 To move the cursor to a new location, you can press the up, down, left, or right cursor keys 
on the keyboard, or you can move the pointer and click the mouse or trackpad. 
 Typing creates text such as letters, numbers, or symbols. Once you’ve typed text, you can 
modify it. To modify text, you must first select the text that you want to modify by using the 
keyboard or the mouse or trackpad. 
 Once you’ve selected text to modify, you can then choose a way to modify it, such as 
deleting the text or moving it to a new location. 
 Moving the Cursor 
 The fastest way to move the cursor is to use the mouse or trackpad by pointing and clicking. 
The problem with the mouse and trackpad is that they’re not always precise. Trying to 
position the pointer in the exact spot that you want the cursor to appear can be difficult, 
so that’s why you may also want to use the keyboard. 

58
CHAPTER 4: Typing and Editing Text
 The keyboard’s  cursor keys  slowly move the cursor one character to the left or right, or one 
line up or down. Although the cursor keys move the cursor slowly, they do move it more 
precisely. 
 It’s often faster to use the mouse or trackpad to place the cursor near the area where you 
want to start typing. Once you place the cursor near the area where you want to type, you 
can use the cursor keys on the keyboard to move the cursor more precisely to the exact 
position. 
 To make the keyboard faster at moving the cursor, OS X offers the following shortcuts, which 
use the  modifier keys  in combination with the cursor keys:
 Command+Left arrow: Moves the cursor to the beginning of a line  
 Command+Right arrow: Moves the cursor to the end of a line  
 Command+Up arrow: Moves the cursor up to the front of the previous 
paragraph  
 Command+Down arrow: Moves the cursor down to the front of the next 
paragraph  
 Option+Left arrow: Moves the cursor one word to the left  
 Option+Right arrow: Moves the cursor one word to the right  
 Selecting  Text 
 After you’ve created text, you can manipulate it to do the following:
 Delete text  
 Change the text size  
 Change the text font  
 Change the text color  
 Copy text to paste in another location  
 Move text to another location  
 Before you can manipulate text, you must first select the text that you want to modify. 
To select text, you can use the mouse, the keyboard, or a combination of both. 
 Note   Not all programs may accept these keystroke shortcuts for moving the cursor. Some 
programs, such as Microsoft Word, offer shortcuts of their own, such as pressing the Home key to 
move the cursor to the beginning of a line, or the End key to move the cursor to the end of a line. 

59
CHAPTER 4: Typing and Editing Text
 Selecting Text with the Mouse or  Trackpad  
 The mouse and the trackpad offer different ways to select text. If you click the mouse or trackpad 
anywhere in text, you move the cursor where you clicked. However, if you double-click 
within a word, you can select just that word. If you triple-click, you can select an entire paragraph.
 Click: Places the cursor in text  
 Double-click inside a word: Selects the word  
 Triple-click inside a paragraph: Selects the entire paragraph  
 If you want to select text within a paragraph or text that spans across multiple paragraphs, 
double- or triple-clicking won’t work. That’s when you need to drag the mouse or trackpad 
over the text that you want to select. 
 To select text by  dragging  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 Move the pointer to the beginning of the text that you want to select.  
 2. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or press down on the trackpad 
with one finger).  
 3. 
 Move the mouse (or slide your fingertip across the trackpad while 
pressing down). As you move the mouse, or slide your finger across 
the trackpad, you select text (see Figure  4-1 ). 
 Note  Remember that double-clicking and triple-clicking mean that you click in rapid succession. 
If you allow too much time to pass between clicks, OS X interprets it as multiple single clicks. 
 Figure 4-1.   Dragging the  mouse or trackpad selects text 
 4. 
 Release the left mouse button (or lift your finger off the trackpad) 
when you’re done selecting text.  
 

60
CHAPTER 4: Typing and Editing Text
 Double- or triple-clicking allow you to select entire words or paragraphs. Dragging is another 
way to select multiple lines of text. A third way to select text uses a combination of the Shift 
key and the mouse or trackpad; the following explains how to do this:
 1. 
 Move the cursor to the beginning of the text that you want to select.  
 2. 
 Move the pointer to the end of the text you want to select.  
 3. 
 Hold down the Shift key and click the left mouse button (or press and 
let go of the trackpad surface) to select this text.  
 Selecting Text with the  Keyboard 
 Using the mouse to select text can often be imprecise because you need to click exactly 
where you want to define the beginning or end of the text that you want to select. If you’re 
one letter off, then your selected text won’t be exactly what you wanted. 
 For more accuracy in selecting text, you can use the keyboard. To select text with the 
keyboard, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Move the cursor to the beginning of the text that you want to select.  
 2. 
 Hold down the Shift key and press the up/down, left/right cursor 
keys. Each time you press a cursor key, you select text in the 
direction that you moved the cursor.  
 3. 
 Release the Shift key when you’re done selecting text.  
 If you ever select text and then change your mind about it, you can deselect text in one of 
two ways:
 Tap any of the cursor keys  
 Click anywhere  
 Note   Don’t forget that in addition to using the cursor keys, you can also use the shortcut keys 
for moving the cursor to the beginning of a line (Command+Left arrow) or to the end of a line 
(Command+Right arrow). 

61
CHAPTER 4: Typing and Editing Text
 Deleting  Text  
 One of the simplest ways to modify selected text is to delete it. After you’ve selected text, 
just tap the Delete key on the keyboard. 
 Copying  Text  
 Another common way to manipulate text is to copy it from one place and paste it into 
another. You can copy and paste text within the same document, or you can copy and paste 
text from one program to a completely different program. For example, you might want to 
copy text from a browser (e.g., Safari) window and paste it in a word processor (e.g., Pages 
or Microsoft Word) window. 
 To copy text, you must do the following:
 1. 
 Select the text that you want to copy.  
 2. 
 Choose the Copy command.  
 3. 
 Move the cursor to the new location where you want the place a 
second copy of the selected text.  
 4. 
 Choose the Paste command.  
 To choose the Copy command, you have the following three options:
 Click the Edit menu and click Copy (Edit ➤ Copy)  
 Press Command+C  
 Right-click over the selected text, and when a pop-up menu appears, 
choose Copy, as shown in Figure  4-2 
 Note  Any time you modify text (such as deleting) and then suddenly change your mind, press 
Command+Z or click the Edit menu and choose Undo (Edit ➤ Undo). The Undo command reverses 
the last command that you performed. If you keep choosing the Undo command, you’ll keep 
reversing the last commands that you chose. 

62
CHAPTER 4: Typing and Editing Text
 Whenever you copy anything, OS X stores that selected item temporarily. If you select and 
copy something else, OS X forgets any previously copied item. That means that if you select 
and copy a paragraph, and then select and copy a second paragraph, OS X only remembers 
the last paragraph you selected and copied. 
 After you’ve selected and copied text, you’ll eventually need to use the Paste command to 
place a copy of that text somewhere else. You have three ways to choose the  Paste command  :
 Click the Edit menu and click Paste (Edit ➤ Paste)  
 Press Command+V  
 Right-click over the selected text, and when a pop-up menu appears, 
choose Paste (see Figure  4-2 ) 
 Moving  Text 
 When you copy text, you create a duplicate of any text you selected. However, if you want to 
move text from one location to another, you need to use the  Cut command  , as follows:
 1. 
 Select the text that you want to move.  
 2. 
 Choose the Cut command (your selected text will disappear).  
 3. 
 Move the cursor to the location that you want to place the selected text.  
 4. 
 Choose the Paste command.  
 Figure 4-2.   Right-clicking selected text displays a pop-up menu 
 

63
CHAPTER 4: Typing and Editing Text
 To choose the  Cut command  , you have the following three options:
 Click the Edit menu and click Cut (Edit ➤ Cut)  
 Press Command+X  
 Right-click over the selected text, and when a pop-up menu appears, 
choose Cut (see Figure  4-2 ) 
 Note  Remember, when you select text and choose the Cut command, make sure that you move 
the cursor to a new location and use the Paste command as soon as possible. The Paste command 
only works with the text that was last selected. 
 Copying and Moving Text by  Dragging  
 If you find copying and cutting too slow, you can copy and cut text by using the mouse or 
trackpad instead. To copy or move text using the mouse or trackpad, you need to follow 
these steps:
 1. 
 Select the text that you want to move.  
 2. 
 Move the pointer over the selected text using the mouse or trackpad.  
 3. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or press a finger on the trackpad 
surface).  
 4. 
 Drag the mouse (or slide your finger on the trackpad surface). As 
you drag the mouse or slide your finger on the trackpad surface, the 
cursor moves to show where the text will appear when you let go of 
the mouse or trackpad.  
 5. 
 Release the mouse or trackpad to move your text at the current 
cursor location.  
 These steps let you move selected text by dragging it to a new location. This is equivalent to 
choosing the Cut and Paste command. 
 If only want to copy text, hold down the Option key in step 3 before holding down the left 
mouse button or pressing a finger on the trackpad surface. Then in step 5, release the 
Option key along with the mouse or trackpad. When you copy text by holding down the 
Option key, you see a plus sign in a green circle, as shown in Figure  4-3 . 

64
CHAPTER 4: Typing and Editing Text
 Formatting  Text 
 The most visually interesting way to modify text is to format it. Formatting can mean one or 
more of the following:
 Changing the text size (known as the font size)  
 Changing the text font  
 Changing the text color and/or background color  
 Changing the text style (bold, underline, or italics)  
 The font size defines how big or small text might appear, measured in points, as shown in 
Figure  4-4 . 
 Figure 4-3.   Holding down the Option key while dragging displays a plus sign in a green circle to identify the Copy command 
 

65
CHAPTER 4: Typing and Editing Text
 Fonts determine the appearance of each character. For example, fonts can make your text 
look like Old English, calligraphy, or even handwriting, as shown in Figure  4-5 . 
 Figure 4-4.   The different appearance of text displayed in various font sizes 
 

66
CHAPTER 4: Typing and Editing Text
 Text color defines the color of each character. In this book, every character is colored black. 
The text background defines the color that appears behind each character. In this book, the 
background color is white. 
 Changing the text background is like using a highlighting marker to emphasize text, such 
as making the text background yellow or orange. When working with text colors and 
background colors, always make sure that they contrast. For example, you don’t want to 
choose a light text color and a light background color because that would be hard to read. 
Instead, you either want a darker text color and a lighter background color, or a lighter text 
color and a darker background color, as shown in Figure  4-6 . 
 Figure 4-5.   The different appearance of text displayed in various font sizes 
 Note   Not all computers have the same fonts installed and not all programs support text 
formatting. If you need to share files with others, make sure that they have the same fonts installed 
or else your text will look different on another computer. 
 Figure 4-6.   Changing the text color and background color can make text stand out 
 
 

67
CHAPTER 4: Typing and Editing Text
 Figure 4-7.    Three common text formatting styles 
 Yet another way to format text is to modify its style. The three most common styles are 
underline, bold, and italics, which you can also combine, as show in Figure  4-7 . 
 To choose different styles for text, you can use keyboard shortcuts, as follows:
 Command+U to underline text  
 Command+B to bold text  
 Command+I to italicize text  
 To turn off a text style, simply select the text again and choose the same command. So 
if you formatted text by underlining it, you can select the underlined text and choose the 
underline command again (Command+U) to remove the underlining.  
 Typing Unusual Characters  
 Most keyboards display letters, numbers, and symbols such as #, *, and @, which you can 
type by pressing a key or holding down the Shift key and pressing another key. However, 
what happens if you need to type characters that don’t appear on the keyboard? For 
example, many keyboards don’t have keys for typing foreign language characters that use 
accent marks. 
 Fortunately, OS X offers a shortcut for typing foreign language characters. Just hold down 
the letter key that represents a letter with an accent mark in a non-English language, such 
as a, e, i, o, u, or c. When holding down one of these letter keys, OS X displays a list of 
common accent marks, as shown in Figure  4-8 . 
 

68
CHAPTER 4: Typing and Editing Text
 Then, type the number that corresponds to the character that you want and OS X will enter it 
in the program. 
 If you need to type more unusual characters or symbols, you have two options:
 Choose Edit ➤ Emoji & Symbols (click the Edit menu and click Emoji & 
Symbols)  
 Press Control+Command+Spacebar  
 When you choose either of these two options, you get a Characters window that lets you 
choose from different categories of symbols, as shown in Figure  4-9 . 
 Figure 4-8.   Holding down a letter key displays a menu of common accent marks 
 Figure 4-9.    The Characters window lets you create unusual characters 
 
 

69
CHAPTER 4: Typing and Editing Text
 The Characters window lets you choose from several different categories of symbols, such 
as currency symbols, emoji, or math symbols. To choose a symbol from the Characters 
window, click a category in the left pane (such as Emoji or Currency Symbols). For the Emoji 
category, you also need to click a subcategory, such as Food & Drink or Smileys & People. 
Then double-click the unusual character that you want to insert where the cursor appears. 
 When you’re done with the Characters window, you need to click the red button (the close 
button) in the upper-left corner of the Characters window to make it disappear. 
 To see how to add unusual characters, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears. If a 
Finder window does not appear, click the File menu and click New 
Finder Window (File ➤ New Finder Window).  
 2. 
 Click Applications in the left pane of the Finder window. The Finder 
window now displays icons of all the programs installed on your Mac.  
 3. 
 Double-click the Pages icon. Pages is a free word processor that 
comes with every new Mac. Notice that the Pages icon appears on 
the Dock and the Pages menu bar appears at the top of the screen, 
as shown in Figure  4-10 .  
 Figure 4-10.   The Pages icon on the Dock and the Pages menu bar at the top of the screen 
 4. 
 Click the Edit menu and click Emoji & Symbols (Edit ➤ Emoji & 
Symbols), or press Control+Command+Spacebar. The Characters 
window appears.  
 

70
CHAPTER 4: Typing and Editing Text
 5. 
 Click the Emoji category and then click the Smileys & People 
subcategory to see the list of smiling faces that you can choose from 
(see Figure  4-9 ).  
 6. 
 Double-click a smiley face. Notice that your chosen smiley face now 
appears in the Pages document.  
 7. 
 Click the red button (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the 
Characters window.  
 8. 
 Click the Pages menu title and then click Quit Pages (Pages ➤ Quit 
Pages). Pages displays a dialog window asking if you want to save 
your document.  
 9. 
 Click Delete. Pages quits. It does not save your document.  
 By using the Characters window, you can type a variety of symbols and characters that you 
can’t type on a keyboard. 
 Summary 
 As you can see, there are multiple ways to modify the appearance of text in any program. 
With most programs, you can find different ways to emphasize and spice up the appearance 
of anything that you write. 
 Just remember that you can use the mouse and/or keyboard to select text. The mouse can 
be faster but the keyboard can be more precise. 
 Once you’ve selected text, you can modify it by changing its size, font, or style. One 
common way to manipulate text is to copy or move it. To copy selected text, use the 
Command+C command. To cut selected text, use the Command+X command. 
 After you’ve copied or cut text, you can paste it using the Command+V command. Just 
make sure that after you cut or copy selected text, you choose the Paste command as soon 
as possible, because if you choose the cut or copy command again, the Paste command 
will only work with the last text selected. 
 You can type foreign language characters by holding down a letter key and choosing the 
correct character from a menu. 
 If you want to create unusual symbols, you can do that through the Characters window, 
which opens by using the Control+Command+Space bar command. 
 With so many ways to create and manipulate text, you’ll be able to make your text look good 
no matter which program you use.  
 Note   The Latin category in the Characters window also lets you choose common foreign 
language characters.

 Chapter 5  
 Understanding Files 
and Folders 
 When you use most programs, you need to save data. That way, the next time you need the 
data, you can use or modify it without having to retype everything all over again. 
 For example, if you’re  writing  a letter or a report on a word processor, you want to save that 
letter or report so that you don’t have to retype the entire letter or report. Whenever you save 
data in a program, the program saves it in a file. 
 A file acts like a box that holds your stuff. If you write a letter in a word processor, that 
file contains your letter. If you type a list of names and addresses in a database, that file 
contains your names and addresses. If you draw a picture in a graphics program, that file 
contains your picture. 
 Almost every program can save  data  in a file. When you save data in a file, you need to give 
the file a name. This  file name  can be anything you want, although it’s best to choose a 
descriptive name that helps you remember what type of data the file contains. 
 For example, you might give one file a name like “Tax Returns 2018” and another file a 
name like “Birthday Picture in Hawaii”. File names typically consist of letters, numbers, 
and spaces, and they can contain up to 255 characters.  Descriptive file names  are for 
your benefit only. OS X only cares that each file in the same folder has a different name. 
It’s actually possible to use identical file names multiple times as long as you store each 
identically named file in a different folder, but this can easily confuse people and it is not 
recommended.  

72
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 How OS X Organizes  Files 
 Every Mac stores files on a disk that holds everything needed to make your computer work, 
including the OS X operating system and programs such as a word processor or a browser. 
 One problem with storing everything on a single disk is that it’s like tossing all of your clothes 
in one big pile in a closet. This makes finding anything slow, confusing, and time-consuming. 
 Just as you would organize a closet to store shoes on a shelf and hang clothes on hangars, 
you can organize your computer’s disk into separate sections to hold different items. When 
you divide a computer’s disk into parts, you use something called   folders . 
 A folder on your Mac lets you organize related files together. The left pane of the Finder 
window, called the  sidebar , shows some of the folders that your Mac has already created for 
storing similar types of files. These are described in the following list and shown in Figure  5-1 :
 Applications: Contains programs installed on the Mac  
 Documents: Contains files you create  
 Downloads: Contains files downloaded from the Internet  
 Movies: Contains video files  
 Music: Contains audio files such as songs  
 Pictures: Contains graphic images such as digital photographs  

73
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 Note   You can actually store any type of file in any folder. However, it’s best to store related files 
in the right folders, such as storing all programs in the Applications folder and all audio files in the 
Music folder, so that you can easily find them again. 
 Figure 5-1.   Every Mac divides its disk into folders for organizing related files 
 

74
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 Folders help keep all of your files organized. To avoid any single folder from getting too 
cluttered, you can create folders within folders (often called  subfolders ). Initially, every Mac 
divides its disk into four main  folders  :
 Applications  
 Library  
 System  
 Users  
 The  Applications folder  contains all of your programs. The Library folder contains files used 
by OS X. The System folder contains the files that make up OS X. In most cases, you’ll never 
need to open and view the Library or System folders. 
 The  Users folder  contains all the files that you create and save. Since multiple people can 
use the same Mac, OS X creates separate folders for each user. By creating separate folders 
(within the Users folder) for each person who uses the same Mac, OS X ensures that one 
person can’t easily mess up files created by another person. 
 OS X organizes your disk in multiple folders, as described here and shown in Figure  5-2 :
 The  Users folder  contains a Guest, Shared, and personal folder 
identified by your name, such as john smith or peggy norton.  
 The  personal folder  (displaying your name) contains an Applications, 
Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Movies, Pictures, and Public folder  

75
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 The most commonly used folders are Documents, Downloads, Movies, Music, and Pictures. 
The Documents folder stores most of your files. Most likely, you’ll need to create additional 
folders within the Documents folder to keep everything organized. 
 Figure 5-2.   OS X organizes folders within folders 
 

76
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 For example, you might divide the Documents folder so that it contains a folder for 
your personal files and a second folder for your work files. Within your work folder, you 
might create a folder related to budgets, a folder related to travel expenses, and a third 
folder related to sales. By creating multiple folders within folders, you can keep your files 
organized.  
 Navigating Through Folders  
 Once you open the Finder window, you can view the contents of a folder in one of the 
following three ways (also see Figure  5-3 ):
 Double-click any folder displayed in the Finder window  
 Click a folder name displayed in the left pane (sidebar) of the 
Finder window  
 Click the Go menu and then click the folder that you want to view, 
such as Documents or Applications  
 Figure 5-3.    Three  ways to open a folder 
 A limitation of both the sidebar on the left pane of the Finder window and the Go menu is 
that they only show a limited number of folders. If you create new folders, you won’t be able 
to find them listed in the sidebar of the Finder window or on the Go menu. 
 To get around this limitation, you have two options:
 Click the Go menu and choose Recent Folders (Go ➤ Recent Folders)  
 Click the Go menu and choose Go to Folder (Go ➤ Go to Folder) 
(or press Shift+Command+G)  
 The Go ➤ Recent Folders command displays a list of your recently viewed folders so that 
you can click the folder that you want to view, as shown in Figure  5-4 .  
 

77
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 If you want to view a folder that you haven’t opened recently, you can choose the Go ➤ Go 
to Folder command. This opens a dialog that asks you to type the exact name of the folder 
that you want to view. 
 The main limitation of this Go ➤ Go to Folder command is that you may not know the exact 
spelling of the folder that you want to view. Misspell the folder name and the Finder won’t 
know how to find the folder that you want.  
 Figure 5-4.    The Recent Folders list on the Go menu 
 

78
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 Navigating Through Previously Viewed Folders 
 Another way to  navigate through folders  is to use the Back and Forward buttons that appear 
in the upper-left corner of the Finder window, as shown in Figure  5-5 . 
 Figure 5-5.   The Back and Forward buttons let you navigate through folders 
 The Back button takes you to the previous folder that you viewed. The Forward button 
normally appears dimmed until you click the Back button at least once. Then if you click the 
Forward button, you can move forward to the folder that you viewed before hitting the Back 
button. 
 To see how the Back and Forward buttons work, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the Go menu and then click Documents (Go ➤ Documents). 
The Finder window displays the contents of your Documents folder. 
Notice that the Forward button appears dimmed.  
 3. 
 Click the Go menu and then click Home (Go ➤ Home). The Finder 
window now displays the contents of the Home folder.  
 4. 
 Click the Back button. The Finder window now takes you back to 
the Documents folder, because it is the folder that you viewed prior 
to the Home folder. Notice that now the Forward button no longer 
appears dimmed.  
 5. 
 Click the Forward button. The Finder window now takes you forward 
to the Home folder, because it is the folder that you viewed before 
clicking the Back button.  
 If you click the Back button multiple times, you see the folders that you previously 
viewed. The Forward button simply reverses the order of the folders you viewed using the 
Back button.  
 

79
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 Viewing the Contents of a  Folder 
 Once you find a folder to view, you can view the contents of that folder in one of four ways:
 Icon view  
 List view  
 Column view  
 Cover Flow view  
 To change the way a folder’s content appears in the Finder window, you have the following 
two choices (also see Figure  5-6 ):
 Click the View menu and click an option, such as Icons or List  
 Click an icon in the upper-left corner of the Finder window  
 Figure 5-6.   Changing how to view the contents of a folder 
 Icon view  makes it easy to see each file or folder. File icons can also display thumbnail 
images of the file contents. These thumbnail images are especially handy for browsing 
through pictures or videos, as shown in Figure  5-7 . 
 

80
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 The problem with  Icon view  is that when you’re viewing a folder that contains many files 
and folders, you can’t easily see everything at once. That’s when you might prefer using List 
view instead. 
 List view  lets you view the contents of multiple folders. This makes it easier to see the 
contents of a single folder and the contents of any folders inside that folder. 
 The drawback of  List view  is that everything appears as a much smaller icon. To view the 
contents of a folder, you need to click the gray disclosure triangle that appears to the left of 
a folder, as shown in Figure  5-8 . 
 Figure 5-7.   Icon view shows thumbnail images of picture or video  files 
 

81
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 Column view  is best at showing the contents of folders within folders because you can see 
the contents of each folder in a column. The leftmost column displays the folder that you’re 
examining and each column to the right displays the contents of the currently selected 
folder, as shown in Figure  5-9 . 
 Figure 5-8.   List view shows the contents of folders within  folders 
 

82
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 Cover Flow view  is best at helping you browse through files so that you can view the 
contents without actually opening them, as shown in Figure  5-10 . You can scroll left and 
right through Cover Flow view by swiping your finger left or right across the mouse or 
trackpad surface.  
 Figure 5-9.   Column view displays the contents of folders in each  column 
 

83
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 Creating  Folders  
 Although OS X includes folders for storing different types of files, you’ll likely need to create 
your own folder. You can create a folder in one of two ways:
 Click the File menu and click New Folder (File ➤ New Folder)  
 Press Shift+Command+N  
 Figure 5-10.   Cover Flow view shows thumbnail views of each file’s  contents 
 

84
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 To rename a  folder  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the folder that you want to rename. OS X highlights your 
selected folder.  
 2. 
 Do one of the following:
 Click the File menu and click Rename (File ➤ Rename)  
 Press Return  
 Right-click the folder, and when a pop-up menu appears, click Rename  
 No matter which method you choose, the Finder highlights the current 
folder name.  
 3. 
 Type a new name for your folder or edit the existing name.  
 4. 
 Press Return when you’re done.  
 The Finder displays your folder with the new name that you typed. Remember, every folder 
needs a descriptive name, but two folders stored inside the same folder cannot have the 
same folder name. 
 While it’s possible to give two or more folders identical names as long as they’re stored 
in different folders, it’s best to always give every folder a distinctive name. That way you’ll 
avoid confusing yourself when trying to find a specific folder.  
 Figure 5-11.    A new folder has a generic folder name 
 When you first create a folder, the Finder generically names it “untitled folder” (see Figure  5-11 ).  
 

85
CHAPTER 5: Understanding Files and Folders 
 Summary 
 Every Mac has a disk for storing everything. To organize your files, your disk is divided into 
multiple folders, in which each folder stores related files. Some common folders that OS X has 
already created for you include Applications (for storing programs), Documents (for storing 
your files), Music (for storing your songs), and Pictures (for storing your digital photographs). 
 Folders often contain other folders. The Finder helps you find your way through these 
multiple hierarchies of folders within folders. You can view a folder’s contents by doing one 
of the following:
 Double-click a folder  
 Click a folder in the sidebar (left pane) of the Finder window  
 Click the Go menu and then click the folder that you want to view  
 Click the Go menu and click Recent Folders (Go ➤ Recent Folders) to 
view a list of your most recently viewed folders  
 Click the Go menu and then click Go to Folder (Go ➤ Go to Folder) and 
type the exact name of the folder that you want to find  
 Click the Back or Forward buttons in the upper-left corner of the 
Finder window  
 Once you’ve selected a folder to open, you can view that folder’s contents as icons, as a list, 
in columns, or in a Cover Flow. Icon view and Cover Flow view provide thumbnail images of 
the file so that you can see the contents at a glance. List view and Column view are best for 
viewing folders within folders. 
 You can also create your own folders by choosing the New Folder command. When you 
create a new folder, it has the generic “untitled folder” name, so you’ll need to rename to 
something more descriptive. 
 Ultimately, folders exist to help you stay organized. By giving your folders descriptive names, 
you’ll more easily find the files stored in each folder.

 Chapter 6  
 Manipulating Files 
 Files typically contain text and/or graphics. Once you save data in a file, you can always 
copy, modify, move, or delete the file. Since files contain personal or work data that’s likely 
important to you, you need to know how to manipulate files stored on your Mac. 
 You can manipulate a file by modifying the contents or by changing the characteristics. 
To modify the contents of a file, you need to open the file in a program. If you have a word 
processor file, you need to use a word processor to edit the text stored in the file. If you have 
a graphics file, you need to use a graphics editor to change the picture stored in the file. 
 Beyond changing the contents of a file, you may also need to change the characteristics of 
the  file  , such as:
 Renaming a file  
 Copying a file  
 Moving a file to a new location  
 Deleting a file  
 Modifying information about the file, such as tags or comments  
 Think of files as boxes containing stuff. You can modify the stuff inside the box or you can 
mark up the outside of the box, move the box to a new location, or throw away the whole 
box (and everything inside it) altogether. 
 Opening a File  
 To open a file, you have two options. The first option is to start the program that created that 
file. If you want to open a file that you created using Microsoft Word, for example, you need 
to start Microsoft Word. (If you don’t know or remember which program created the file that 
you want to open, the second option is best; this is explained later.) 

88
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 Once you start the program that created the file, click the File menu, and then click Open 
(File ➤ Open). When an Open window appears, click the file that you want to edit and then 
click the Open button in the bottom-right corner of the Open window, as shown in Figure  6-1 . 
 Figure 6-1.   A typical Open window that lets you open a file within a program 
 A second and faster way to open a file is to do one of the following:
 Double-click the file  
 Right-click the file, and when a pop-up menu appears, click Open  
 Both options open the file and load the program that created it at the same time. If you’re 
ever in doubt which program created a file, just double-click that file (or right-click and 
choose Open). 
 There could come a time when you receive a file created by a program that you don’t have 
on your Mac. Similarly, you may want to edit a file using a program different from the one 
that created it; for example, you have a file created in Microsoft Word but you want to edit 
it using Pages. When you want to edit a file using a program different from the one that 
originally created it, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock to open a Finder window.  
 2. 
 Right-click the file that you want to edit. A pop-up menu appears.

 4. 
 Click the program name that you want to open your chosen file. If it 
is able, OS X opens your file within the program that you just chose.  
 Although every file contains data, every program potentially stores data in a different way. 
The way that a program saves data in a file is called a   file format . If you type the same letter in 
two different word processors, the first word processor would save the data in one file format 
and the second word processor would save that same data in an entirely different file format. 
 Fortunately, most programs can save files in multiple formats so that you can use the  file 
format  most convenient for you. For example, the Pages word processor can save files in its 
own Pages format or in Microsoft Word format. This lets you share Pages documents with 
anyone who might be using Microsoft Word. 
 Figure 6-2.   The Open With command lets you choose which program to use to edit a file 
 3. 
 Choose Open With. You see a submenu listing all the programs OS X 
thinks can open your chosen file, as shown in Figure  6-2 . 
 Note   Even though the Open With submenu lists potential programs, there’s no guarantee that any 
of these programs can actually open your file. 
 

90
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 To help identify the  file format  , programs typically add an identifying extension to the file 
 name  . This file  extension  helps you identify which programs created the file and how that 
data is stored. The following are some common  file formats  :
 Graphic files: .png, .jpg, .tiff, .gif, .psd  
 Word processor files: .doc, .docx, .pages  
 Spreadsheet files: .xls, .xlsx, .numbers  
 Slide show presentation files: .ppt, .pptx, .keynote  
 The file  extension  appears after the file’s name. So if you named a file “Letters to Grandma”, 
it might have a file  extension  that makes the whole file name look like “Letters to Grandma.
docx” or “Letters to Grandma.pages”. 
 In general, all programs, such as Photoshop and Microsoft Word, are able to open a variety 
of different file formats.  
 If you use Apple’s Pages word processor, you can open Microsoft Word .doc and .docx 
files, but Microsoft Word can’t open .pages files. Likewise, Apple’s Numbers spreadsheet 
can open Microsoft Excel .xls and .xslx files, and Apple’s Keynote presentation program can 
open Microsoft PowerPoint .ppt and .pptx files, but the Microsoft programs can’t open the 
Apple programs. 
 While file  extensions  can help you identify a file format, file  extensions  can be hidden. If a file 
 extension  isn’t visible, you can still view the file  extension  by following these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock to open a Finder window.  
 2. 
 Right-click the file that you want to examine. A pop-up menu 
appears, as shown in Figure  6-3 . 

91
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 3. 
 Click Get Info (or press Command+I). An Info window appears.  
 4. 
 Click the red close button in the upper-left corner when you’re done 
looking at the Info window.  
 As shown in Figure  6-4 , the Info window clearly identifies the file name, the file  extension  , 
and the program that created the file. Look for the following in the figure:
 At the top of the window, you see the file name with the file  extension  
and the icon of the program that created the file. In the example, 
Lesson 2.doc is a .doc file created by Microsoft Word.  
 The Kind field includes the file format and file  extension  , stating the 
name of the program that created the file.  
 The Name & Extension field also displays the file name and file 
 extension  . (If you clear the “Hide extension” check box, you can see the 
file extension in the Finder window.)

CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 Previewing a  File  
 Opening a file can be cumbersome because you have to load the program to see the file’s 
contents. Instead of opening a file, it’s often faster to preview a file. 
 Previewing simply shows you the contents of that file without having to start a program to 
open that particular file. The drawback is that OS X can only preview files stored in common 
formats such as graphics (.jpg, .png, .gif, .pdf), word processor documents (.doc, .docx, 
.pages), spreadsheets (.xls, .xlsx, .numbers), and presentation files (.ppt, .pptx, .keynote). 
If you try to preview a file created by a less commonly used program, you may not be able to 
use the preview feature. 
 To preview a file, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the file that you want to preview.  
 3. 
 Do one of the following to open a preview window like the one shown 
in Figure  6-5 :
 a.  Press the spacebar  
 b.  Press Command+Y  
 c.  Right-click the file, and when a pop-up menu appears, choose Quick Look  
 Figure 6-5.   The preview window displays the contents of a file without opening the file 
 4. 
 Click the close button in the upper-left corner of the preview window 
to make it disappear.

CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 Creating and Saving a  File 
 All files are created by programs. A word processor lets you type text, a paint program lets 
you draw pictures, a game lets you store high scores, and a video editor lets you modify 
video. Even OS X and Safari create files to store data for its own use, even though you may 
never know they exist. 
 With most programs, you have the option to create a new file. The following are two 
common ways to create a new file in any program:
 Click the File menu and click New (File ➤ New)  
 Press Command+N  
 When you create a new file in a program, you see an empty window. Within this window, you 
create your data, such as typing a business report or drawing a picture. 
 Once you create a new file, you’ll eventually want to save it. The following are two common 
ways to save a file:
 Click the File menu and click Save (File ➤ Save) 
 Press Command+S  
 When you save a new file, you need to decide the following:
 The file name  
 The location where you want to save the file  
 The file name can contain up to 255 characters but should be descriptive of the file’s 
contents. For example, naming a file “Tax Returns” can help you find which file contains your 
tax return data. 
 The location of a file can be any folder, but most people usually save their files in the 
Documents folder. Of course, to further organize their files, people often create multiple 
folders inside the Documents folder. 
 The first time that you save a file, you always need to define a file name and location to save 
the file in. From that point on, saving that file simply saves the contents of that file so that 
you never need to worry about the file name or location again.  
 Identifying an Open File’s  Location 
 If you’ve opened an existing file in a program, here’s a quick way to identify that file’s 
location on your disk. At the top of every window, centered in the middle, you’ll always see 
the title bar that displays the file name. 
 Right-click the file name on the title bar to make a pop-up menu appear. This menu lists a 
hierarchy of all the folders (folders tucked within other folders) in which you can find the file 
displayed in the current window, as shown in Figure  6-6 .  

95
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 In Figure  6-6 , the current file in the window is named “Thanksgiving” and it’s stored inside a 
folder called KNSJ Skits. This folder is stored inside a folder called Comedy, which is inside 
the Documents folder. 
 Your home folder is typically your name. Every home folder gets stored in the Users folder, 
which is stored on your Mac’s hard disk. By simply following the hierarchy of folders, you 
can find the location of your file.  
 Renaming a  File  
 When you first save a file, you should give it a descriptive and unique name. You can’t 
give two files in the same folder the same name, but you can give two files the same name 
if they’re stored in separate folders. However, this isn’t recommended since it will likely 
confuse you. 
 You can always rename a file by either editing its existing name or giving it an entirely 
different name. 
 To rename a file, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the file that you want to rename.  
 3. 
 Do one of the following to select the existing file name:
 a.  Press Return to highlight the current file name  
 b.  Right-click the file, and when a pop-up menu appears, choose Rename  
 4. 
 Use the cursor keys to edit the existing name or type an entirely new name.  
 Copying a  File 
 Copying a file makes a duplicate of that file. When you copy a file, you can store the copy 
of that file anywhere else, such as in a different folder on your Mac or on a separate device, 
such as a USB flash drive or an external hard drive. 
 Copying a file involves three steps: selecting, copying, and pasting.  
 Figure 6-6.   Right-clicking a window title bar displays the location of that file 
 

96
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 Select the File 
 First, you need to select the file or files that you want to copy, as follows:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Do one of the following:
 To select only one file in the Finder window, click the file that you want to 
copy. It becomes highlighted.  
 To select two or more files in the Finder window, hold down the Command 
key and click each file that you want to select. This method lets you select 
two or more files that aren’t necessarily next to each other.  
 To select a range of files that are next to each other, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the first file that you want to select in the Finder window.  
 2. 
 Hold down the Shift key and click the last file that you want to select. 
The Finder selects the range of files, as shown in Figure  6-7 . 
 Figure 6-7.   Clicking once, holding down the Shift key, and clicking a second time selects the range of files 
 

97
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 Copy the File 
 After you have selected one or more files, choose the Copy command in one of three ways:
 Click the Edit menu and click Copy (Edit ➤ Copy)  
 Press Command+C  
 Right-click the selected file and when a pop-up menu appears, 
choose Copy  
 Paste the File 
 Finally, open the folder where you want to store the copied file(s) and choose the Paste 
command in one of the following three ways:
 Click the Edit menu and click Paste (Edit ➤ Paste)  
 Press Command+V  
 Right-click the selected file, and when a pop-up menu appears, 
choose Paste  
 Moving a  File 
 Unlike copying a file, moving a file physically moves it to a new location. To move a file, you 
can use the mouse or trackpad. However, keep in mind that moving a file works differently 
depending on whether you’re moving a file to a new folder on the same storage device (such 
as the hard disk on your Mac) or whether you’re moving a file from one device (such as your 
Mac) to a second device (such as a USB flash drive). 
 To move a file to another folder on the same storage device (such as a different folder on a 
Mac), follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears. In this 
Finder window, find the folder in which you want to move a file to.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Finder Window (or press 
Command+N). This opens a second Finder window. You may want 
to move this second Finder window so that you can see both Finder 
windows side by side. (You can also drag a file to a different folder in 
the same Finder window if you can see the folder in which you want 
to store the file.)  
 3. 
 In this second Finder window, move the pointer over the file that you 
want to move.  
 Note   If you hold down the Option key during steps 4 and 5, you can copy a file instead of moving it. 

98
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 4. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or press your finger on the 
trackpad surface).  
 5. 
 Drag the file icon to the folder where you want to move it to (such as 
the folder that you selected in step 1).  
 6. 
 Release the mouse or trackpad. The Finder moves your selected file.  
 To move a file from one storage device (such as a hard disk on a Mac) to another storage 
device (such as an external hard disk or USB flash drive), follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears. In this 
Finder window, find the folder on the storage device in which you 
want to move a file to.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Finder Window (or press 
Command+N). This opens a second Finder window. You may want 
to move this second Finder window so that you can see both Finder 
windows side by side.  
 3. 
 In this second Finder window, move the pointer over the file that you 
want to move.  
 4. 
 Hold down the Command key. (If you don’t hold down the Command 
key, the Finder will copy your selected file instead of moving it.)  
 5. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or press your finger on the 
trackpad surface).  
 6. 
 Drag the file icon to the folder where you want to move it to (such as 
the folder that you selected in step 1).  
 7. 
 Release the mouse or trackpad. The Finder moves your selected file 
from one storage device to another.  
 Notice the differences when dragging and dropping a file from one folder to another. When 
you’re dragging and dropping a file within the same storage device, the Finder defaults to 
moving the file unless you hold down the Option key to make it copy the file instead. 
 When you’re dragging and dropping a file between two different storage devices, the 
Finder defaults to copying the file unless you hold down the Command key to make it move 
the file instead. 
 By defaulting to copying files between two different storage devices, OS X protects you from 
accidentally moving a file to a different storage device.  

99
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 Deleting a  File 
 No matter how important a file might be, you may eventually want to delete it. To delete 
a file, you need to move it to the Trash folder. There are several ways to delete a file after 
selecting it in the Finder window:
 Drag the file to the Trash icon on the right side of the Dock  
 Right-click the selected file, and when a pop-up menu appears, choose 
Move to Trash  
 Click the File menu and choose Move to Trash (File ➤ Move to Trash)  
 Remember, once you delete a file, you can still recover that file from the Trash if you change 
your mind. To retrieve a file from the Trash, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Trash icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears, 
displaying all the files currently stored in the Trash.  
 2. 
 Click the file that you want to retrieve and do one of the following:
 a.  Click the File menu and choose Put Back (File ➤ Put Back)  
 b.  Right-click the file that you want to retrieve, and when a pop-up menu 
appears, choose Put Back, as shown in Figure  6-8 
 Figure 6-8.   The Put Back command retrieves a file from the Trash 
 

100
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 If you’re sure you want to delete any files stored in the Trash, you can permanently delete 
these files by emptying the Trash. To empty the Trash, do one of the following:
 Right-click the Trash icon on the Dock, and when a pop-up menu 
appears, choose Empty Trash  
 Click the Finder menu and choose Empty Trash (Finder ➤ Empty Trash)  
 After you choose the Empty Trash command, OS X permanently deletes all files in the Trash. 
Always make sure that there aren’t any files in the Trash that you actually need before you 
choose the Empty Trash command.  
 Searching for a  File  
 Perhaps the biggest problem with files is trying to find them again. Storing files in folders with 
descriptive names is only part of the solution. No matter how carefully you name folders and 
store files in the appropriately named folder, chances are good you’ll forget where you saved 
a particular file. When this happens, you need to search for that file by its name or contents. 
 To search for a file, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click in the Search field that appears in the upper-right corner of the 
Finder window, as shown in Figure  6-9 . 
 Note  The Put Back command moves a file from the Trash back to its original location when you 
deleted it. 

101
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 3. 
 Type a word or phrase that you want to find in either the name of a 
file or in the contents of a file.  
 4. 
 Press Enter to see a list of files that contain a match.  
 Searching for the word “taxes” helps you find files and folders that contain the word 
“taxes” in the file name. In addition, you’ll find files that contain the word “taxes” somewhere 
in its data. 
 Note   When searching for the contents of a file, type phrases instead of single words. Searching 
for phrases minimizes finding files that contain irrelevant data. 
 Figure 6-9.   Searching finds file names and files that contain certain words or phrases 
 Tagging  Files  
 Most people forget where they stored files that they don’t use that often. So no matter how 
disciplined you might be in making folders with descriptive names, chances are good that 
you’ll forget where you stored a file. 
 Since you may not remember the name that you gave a file, and searches often results in too 
many files that you do not want, you can simplify searching by using tags. 
 

102
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 Tags consist of two parts:
 A color  
 A descriptive word or phrase  
 Tags let you mark files with a distinctive color and description. For example, you might tag 
some files with the color red and the word “taxes” and other files with the color yellow and 
the phrase “Vacation Photos 2017.” The whole purpose of tags is to help you identify related 
files and provide another way to help you find a file later. 
 You can tag a file when you create it or you can tag a file that already exists. You can even 
place multiple tags on a single file. By placing two or more tags on a file, you’ll be able to 
retrieve it by searching for any of the tags associated with it. 
 For example, you might tag a file with the phrase “Tax information” and a second tag called 
“Business expense”. Then you can find that file by searching for either “Tax information” or 
“Business expense”. 
 To tag a file that already exists, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click to select the file or folder that you want to tag. (If you hold 
down the Command key, you can click to select more than one file at 
a time.)  
 3. 
 Click the File menu and click a tag at the bottom of the File menu. 
Alternatively, right-click the selected file and click a tag at the bottom 
of the pop-up menu, as shown in Figure  6-10 . 
 Figure 6-10.   Tagging a file through the File menu or the right-click pop-up menu 
 

103
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 After you have tagged a file, the Finder displays those tagged items with colors that appear 
to the right of the file or folder name, as shown in Figure  6-11 . 
 Note  Tagging folders can be a faster and easier alternative than tagging multiple files individually. 
 Figure 6-11.   Tags appear to the right of a file or folder 
 To remove a tag from a file or folder, just repeat the preceding steps. So if a file has an 
orange tag, you can remove that orange tag by selecting it a second time, as shown in 
Figure  6-12 . 
 

104
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 Customizing  Tags 
 By default, tags are simply colors, but you can add descriptive phrases to each color as 
well. To customize a tag with a descriptive name, you can either modify them within the 
Finder Preferences window or in the left pane of the Finder window. 
 To rename a tag in the  Finder Preferences window  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears. If a 
Finder window does nots appear, click the File menu and click New 
Finder Window (File ➤ New Finder Window).  
 2. 
 Click the Finder menu and choose Preferences (Finder ➤ 
Preferences). The Finder Preferences window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Tags icon. The Finder Preferences window displays all 
available tags.  
 4. 
 Right-click the tag that you want to modify. A pop-up menu appears, 
as shown in Figure  6-13 . 
 Figure 6-12.   Selecting the same tag twice removes that tag from a file or folder

 Click the Rename command. The current tag name is selected.  
 6. 
 Edit the existing name or type a new name for your tag. Press Return 
when you’re done.  
 7. 
 (Optional) If you want to change the color of a tag, right-click the tag 
that you want to modify. A pop-up menu appears (see Figure  6-13 ). 
 8. 
 Click the new color that you want to associate with your tag.  
 

106
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 Searching with  Tags 
 Once you’ve tagged one or more files and folders, you can easily search for those tagged 
items. You can use the sidebar (the left pane) of the Finder window to display a list of your 
most commonly used tags, as shown in Figure  6-14 . 
 Figure 6-14.   Tags appear in the sidebar (the left pane) of the Finder window 
 To define which tags appear in the sidebar of the Finder window, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the Finder menu and choose Preferences (Finder ➤ 
Preferences). The Finder Preferences window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Tags icon. The Finder Preferences window displays all 
available tags.  
 4. 
 Click the check box to the right of each tag that you want to appear 
in the Finder sidebar. A check mark means the tag will appear in the 
sidebar. An empty check mark means that the tag will not appear in 
the sidebar. By default, tags have an inactive mark in the check box, 
which means that OS X will only display the most common tags in 
the sidebar, such as Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple.  
 5. 
 Click the close button in the upper-left corner of the Finder 
Preferences window.  
 

107
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 Once you’ve defined one or more tags to appear in the sidebar of the Finder window, you 
can display only certain tagged files. To find all files with the same tag, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Scroll through the sidebar of the Finder window until you see the list 
of available tags.  
 3. 
 Click a tag. The Finder window displays all files and folders that have 
that particular tag, as shown in Figure  6-15 . 
 Figure 6-15.   Clicking a tag in the sidebar displays only those tagged files in the Finder window 
 Another way to search for tagged files is to use the Search field in the upper-right corner of 
the Finder window. To use the Search field to look for specific tags, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click in the Search field in the upper-right corner of the Finder window.  
 3. 
 Type part of the tag name, such as “taxes” or “orange”. As you type, 
the Search field lists all matching tags, as shown in Figure  6-16 .  
 

108
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 4. 
 Click the tag that you want, such as Orange. The Finder window 
displays all files and folders with that particular tag.  
 Using  iCloud 
 Every Mac has a limited amount of built-in storage. If you need more storage, one option 
is to use an external hard disk. However, if you’re using a laptop, lugging an external hard 
disk around isn’t practical. That’s why Apple offers another option, called  iCloud  , which only 
relies on an Internet connection. 
 Think of iCloud as an external hard disk accessible over the Internet. The main advantage 
of storing files on iCloud is that if your Mac is stolen, destroyed, or fails, all of your files are 
still safely stored on iCloud. The disadvantage of iCloud is that you always need an Internet 
connection to access it. 
 Another  drawback of iCloud  is that Apple only gives you a limited amount of free storage, 
perhaps 5GB. If you want more storage space, you have to pay for it. From a privacy point of 
view, any files stored on iCloud are physically out of your control, so there’s always a small 
chance that others could access those files without your knowledge or permission. 
 Before you can use iCloud, you need to create an Apple ID that uniquely identifies you. 
To create a free Apple ID, visit Apple’s web site at   https://appleid.apple.com . 
 Once you’ve created an Apple ID, you can create an iCloud account by visiting Apple’s web 
site at   https://www.apple.com/icloud/setup . 
 Besides providing a place to store backup copies of your critical files, iCloud also gives you 
a place to store files that you want to access on different devices. 
 Without iCloud, you might modify a file on a Mac, and then copy that file to an iPad to 
modify it some more. You might copy that file to a Windows PC to modify it yet again. 
 Figure 6-16.   Searching for tags in the Search field 
 

109
CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 Copying a file from one device to another can be cumbersome, because now that you have 
multiple copies of the same file stored on different devices, if you make changes to the file, 
how do you know which is the most recent and up-to-date version? 
 iCloud eliminates this problem by letting you store a file on iCloud. There’s always only a 
single copy of any file saved on iCloud. You can modify the file on a Mac and then switch to 
an iPhone to modify the file some more. 
 Each time that you modify a file on iCloud, you’re only modifying one file, so you’ll never 
have multiple copies of the same file. iCloud basically gives you a safe place to store files 
(unless you accidentally delete the files from iCloud). 
 Think of iCloud as a second disk on the Internet. Just as you can divide the disk in your 
Mac into folders, you can divide iCloud into folders to organize your files. You can view the 
contents of iCloud in the Finder. 
 To view your iCloud storage, first make sure that you have an Internet connection and that 
you have set up an iCloud account using your Apple ID. Then, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the Go menu and click iCloud Drive, as shown in Figure  6-17 . 
The Finder displays the contents of your iCloud drive.  
 Figure 6-17.    Accessing iCloud Drive from the Finder 
 Once you open your iCloud Drive, you can store files on iCloud, create folders, and copy or 
move files between iCloud and your Mac.

CHAPTER 6: Manipulating Files
 Summary 
 File management is one of the most critical yet confusing elements of using any computer. 
Before creating files, it’s best to develop a plan to keep all of your files organized. 
 Typically, you can store all of your critical files inside the Documents folder, but make sure 
that you create additional folders to keep your various files organized so that you can find 
them again. 
 Beyond using folders to organize files, consider tagging files with colors and descriptive 
phrases as well. Such tags can help you find a file quickly when you need it. 
 You can rename, copy, move, and delete any file. Just remember that if you delete a file, 
you can always retrieve it later from the Trash. However, if you empty the Trash, then all the 
files are gone for good. 
 Files contain your important data, so make sure that you know how to create files, save 
them, and find them again. Managing files might feel as exciting as organizing a closet, 
but when you take the time to do it, you’ll be glad you did.

 Chapter 7  
 Sharing Files 
 Most of the time, you  create  and modify files for your own use. However, sometimes you 
need to share files with other people. At times, you may want to let others see what you’ve 
created, and other times, you may need to let others edit your file and send it back to you. 
Since sharing files is often necessary, you need to know how to share files easily. 
 In a perfect world, you should be able to share files as easily as you can share a newspaper 
or a magazine. In reality, sharing files isn’t as simple as you might expect. 
 Remember, programs often store data in a specific file format. That means that a file created 
in Microsoft Word can’t be opened in iMovie, and a video edited in iMovie can’t be opened 
in Microsoft Excel. 
 To share a file successfully, one or more of the following criteria must be met:
 Both the sender and the receiver of the file must have the same program 
that created the file  
 The receiver must have a program that can import the file  
 The sender must have a program that can export the file into another file 
format that the receiver can open  
 Files can contain the same data, but if the data is stored in different file formats, not 
everyone is able to access the data. 
 To simplify the problem with file formats, the Adobe company created a universal file 
format called a  Portable Document File (PDF)  . Files stored in the PDF format have the .pdf 
file extension. 
 The advantage of .pdf  files  is that they preserve all text formatting and graphics displaying. 
Even better, you can share .pdf files across all types of computers, including Windows, 
Linux, OS X, and even iOS and Android devices. 
 The  disadvantage of  .pdf files is that they can be viewed but only partially edited and 
modified. Many government agencies and companies create .pdf files of forms that you can 
complete by entering data or by printing to fill out by hand.

CHAPTER 7: Sharing Files
 Creating a PDF  File 
 With OS X, you can turn any file into a .pdf file just by using the Print command. Instead 
of printing the contents of a file to paper, you print your file to a .pdf file that displays your 
data exactly as if it were printed on paper. Since almost every program can print data, every 
program can create a .pdf file that you can share with others. 
 To create a .pdf file from most programs that can display text or graphics, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open a file that you want to save as a .pdf file, such as a word 
processor document, spreadsheet, or slide show presentation.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose Print (File ➤ Print). A Print window 
appears, as shown in Figure  7-1 . 
 Figure 7-1.    The Print command opens a Print window 
 

113
CHAPTER 7: Sharing Files
 3. 
 Click the PDF pop-up menu in the bottom-left corner. A pop-up 
menu appears, as shown in Figure  7-2 . 
 Figure 7-2.    The  PDF  pop-up menu 
 4. 
 Choose Save as PDF. A Save As window appears, letting you choose the 
folder to save your .pdf file and the name you want to give your .pdf file.  
 5. 
 Click the folder where you want to save your .pdf file.  
 6. 
 Type a descriptive file name for your .pdf file.  
 7. 
 Click the Save button. Your .pdf file gets saved in the folder under 
the file name that you chose, as shown in Figure  7-3 . 
 Figure 7-3.   The Finder identifies .pdf files as PDF Document in the Kind column 
 
 

114
CHAPTER 7: Sharing Files
 Another way to create a .pdf file within most programs is to click the File menu and choose 
either Export (File ➤ Export) or Save As (File ➤ Save As). Then choose to export or save the 
file as a PDF file, as shown in Figure  7-4 . 
 Figure 7-4.    The File ➤ Export or File ➤ Save As command offers another way to create .pdf files 
 Opening a PDF  File 
 To open and view the contents of a .pdf file on any computer, you would normally use a 
special PDF viewing program such as Adobe Reader. However, the Mac includes a program 
called  Preview  that can open and view .pdf files so that you don’t need to download and 
install Adobe Reader on your Mac. 
 To open a .pdf file on a Mac, you can double-click a .pdf file in the Finder window. You can 
also open the Preview program (in the Applications folder) and then choose File ➤ Open to 
select the .pdf file that you want to view.  
 Note   In addition to opening .pdf files, the Preview program can also open most common graphic 
files, such as .jpg, .png, and .gif. 

115
CHAPTER 7: Sharing Files
 Importing a  File 
 If you want to share a file with another person, it’s always easiest if the other person uses the 
same program as you do on a Mac. That way you can share your files without any problems. 
 Unfortunately, not everyone uses the same programs. Even different versions of the same 
program could save files in slightly different formats. When someone sends you a file created 
by another program, you need to know which type of program is able to open that file. When 
a program can open a file created by another program, that’s called  importing . 
 Some common  types of files  are shown in Table  7-1 .  
 Table 7-1.   Commonly Shared File Formats

 QuickTime Player, 
GarageBand 
 Video 
 .avi, .mov, .mpg, 
.mpeg, .mp4, .wmv 
 Any video player or editor 
 QuickTime Player, 
iMovie 
 Once you can identify the type of program that created the file, you can use a similar 
program to import and open that file. For example, if you wanted to import and open a .docx 
file, since you know it’s a word processor file, you should be able to import and open that file 
using almost any word processor such as Pages. 
 Likewise, if you wanted to import and open an .xlsx file, you could use any spreadsheet such 
as Numbers. If you wanted to import and open a .pptx file, you could use a presentation 
program such as Keynote. 
 Note   When you import a file, you may lose the original formatting of the data. 

116
CHAPTER 7: Sharing Files
 Exporting a  File 
 Because so many people use Microsoft Office on either Windows or the Mac, many people 
share word processor documents saved in Microsoft Word format, spreadsheets in Microsoft 
Excel format, and presentations in Microsoft PowerPoint format. Most modern programs can 
import Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. 
 So if you need to share a file with someone who doesn’t have the same program as you, 
save that file as a .pdf file—if the receiver doesn’t need to edit the data in the file. 
 If others need to edit the data, then you should export the file as a Microsoft Word, Excel, or 
PowerPoint file. 
 All Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files come in two file formats. First, there’s the old file 
format used in earlier versions of Word (.doc), Excel (.xls), and PowerPoint (.ppt). 
 Second, there’s the new file format used in more recent versions of Word (.docx), Excel 
(.xlsx), and PowerPoint (.pptx). 
 For maximum compatibility, export files into the new file format of Word (.docx), Excel (.xlsx), 
or PowerPoint (.pptx). If you need to share files with someone using an older computer 
running any version of Word 2003, Excel 2003, PowerPoint 2003, or earlier versions, 
you may need to share files using the older file format of Word (.doc), Excel (.xls), and 
PowerPoint (.ppt). 
 To export a file from most programs, click the File menu and choose Export or Save As. 
Then choose the file format you want to use, such as Word or Excel. 
 If you need to share files with programs that won’t accept a Word, an Excel, or a PowerPoint 
format, you may need to export your files in one of the following types of file formats that 
practically all programs and computers can import:
 Text (for word processor documents)  
 CSV (comma-separated value) (for spreadsheets)  
 Text files  contain nothing but text such as letters, punctuation marks, and symbols. Unlike a 
word processor file format, text files don’t contain any formatting. 
 CSV files  contain nothing but numbers and text separated by commas, tabs, or other 
symbols. Like text files, CSV files only contain data but no formatting or formulas. 
 Remember, when you export data to text or CSV file formats, you lose all formatting, such as 
bolding, fonts, or font sizes. To retain formatting, share your files as Microsoft Word, Excel, 
or PowerPoint files, if possible. 
 Note   You can purchase special file conversion programs that are especially useful for converting 
files trapped in formats that are no longer popular, such as dBASE, Lotus 1-2-3, WordStar, or 
WordPerfect files. 

117
CHAPTER 7: Sharing Files
 Compressing Files  
 If a file is small, it is easy and fast to copy a file from one computer to another. Unfortunately, 
many graphics and video files can be extremely large. Even worse, if you want to share 
multiple files, you don’t want to copy each file individually. 
 To solve both of these problems, you can compress files. Compressing a file offers two 
huge benefits:
 It can often shrink a file size up to half its original size  
 It can combine multiple files into a single file  
 Compressing saves space and stuffs multiple files into a single compressed file called a 
 ZIP  file .  ZIP files  can be opened or unzipped by Windows, Linux, and Mac computers, so 
compressing is a way to make file sharing easier for everyone. 
 To compress one or more files, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the left end of the Dock. A Finder window 
appears.  
 2. 
 Do one of the following:
 a.  Click one file to compress  
 b.  Hold down the Command key and click two or more files  
 c.  Click the first file to compress, hold down the Shift key, and click the last file 
to compress to select a range of files  
 3. 
 Do one of the following:
 a.  Click the File menu and choose Compress (File ➤ Compress)  
 b.  Right-click the selected file or files, and when a pop-up menu appears, 
choose Compress  
 Compressed files appear in the Finder window with .zip file extension and a ZIP icon as 
shown in Figure  7-5 . 
 Note   Rather than select two or more files to compress, you can also select one or more folders, 
which will compress all files within that folder. 

118
CHAPTER 7: Sharing Files
 Once you’ve compressed a file, you can share that file with others. If someone sends you a 
ZIP compressed file, you can unzip that file by following these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the left end of the Dock. A Finder 
window appears.  
 2. 
 Double-click the ZIP file that you want to unzip. The Finder now 
displays your unzipped file or folder.  
 Using  AirDrop 
 The simplest way to share a file is to copy it on to a USB flash drive, plug that flash drive 
in another computer, and then copy the file to the other computer. This method can be 
especially useful for sharing files between a Mac and a PC running Windows or Linux. 
 The main drawback with this method of sharing files is that you need a USB flash drive. 
Even if you have a flash drive, you can’t use it to share files with an iPhone or an iPad. 
To solve this problem, you can share files wirelessly using AirDrop. 
 The main idea behind AirDrop is that you can share files just by dragging and dropping them 
to a special AirDrop window. This lets you share files between two Mac computers, two iOS 
devices, or a Mac and an iOS device such as an iPhone or iPad. 
 Figure 7-5.   You can identify a ZIP  file by its icon and file extension 
 

119
CHAPTER 7: Sharing Files
 To use AirDrop, your two devices need to meet the following criteria:
 Be within 30 feet (9 meters) of each other  
 The Mac must be running OS X Yosemite or later  
 The Mac must have its “Block all incoming connections” option turned 
off in the Security & Privacy preferences window  
 The iOS device must have Personal Hotspot turned off in Settings ➤ Cellular  
 Using AirDrop  Between Two Mac Computers  
 When you want to share files between two Mac computers, both of them need to be 
capable of running AirDrop. To share a file using AirDrop between two Mac computers, 
follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock on both Mac computers. A Finder 
window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the Go menu and choose AirDrop (Go ➤ AirDrop) on both Mac 
computers. The AirDrop icon appears in both Finder windows. Wait a 
few seconds and an icon representing the other Mac appears in the 
Finder window, as shown in Figure  7-6 . 
 Figure 7-6.   Each device appears as an icon in the AirDrop window 
 

120
CHAPTER 7: Sharing Files
  3.  On the Mac that has the file that you want to share, click the File 
menu and choose New Finder Window (File ➤ New Finder Window). 
This opens a second Finder window. You may want to rearrange the 
two Finder windows so that they appear side by side.  
 4. 
 In this second Finder window, find the file that you want to share.  
 5. 
 Using the mouse or trackpad, drag the file over the icon representing 
the other Mac computer.  
 6. 
 Release the mouse or trackpad when the file appears directly over 
the other Mac computer icon. On the receiving Mac computer, the 
AirDropped file appears in the Downloads folder.  
 Using AirDrop Between a Mac and an iPhone/ iPad  
 AirDrop can be a convenient way to share files between a Mac and an iPhone/iPad without 
physically connecting them with a cable. 
 On the iOS device, make sure that you have both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on. Then follow 
these steps to send a file from a Mac to an iOS device:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock on the Mac. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the Go menu and choose AirDrop (Go ➤ AirDrop) on the Mac. 
The AirDrop icon appears in the Finder window.  
 3. 
 Turn on the iOS device. Wait a few seconds and an icon representing 
the iOS device appears in the Finder window (see Figure  7-6 ). 
 4. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Finder Window (File ➤ New 
Finder Window). This opens a second Finder window. You may want 
to rearrange the two Finder windows so that they appear side by side.  
 5. 
 Find the file that you want to share using this second Finder window.  
 6. 
 Drag the file, using the mouse or trackpad, over the icon representing 
the iOS device.  
 Note  If you send a file from a Mac to an iOS device, make sure that you have an iOS app that can 
open the file. 
 Note   If you’re trying to connect to a Mac model older than 2012, click the “Don’t see who you’re 
looking for?” link in the bottom-right corner of Figure  7-6 . 

121
CHAPTER 7: Sharing Files
 At times, you may want to share a file from an iOS device to a Mac. To share a file on an iOS 
device and copy it to a Mac, follow these steps:
 1. 
 On the iOS device, open the file that you want to send to the Mac.  
 2. 
 Tap the  Share icon  , as shown in Figure  7-7 . Depending on the app 
that you use, the Share icon may appear near the top or bottom of 
the screen. Another screen lets you select how to share the file.  
 Figure 7-7.    The  Share icon lets you send a file to another computer 
 3. 
 Tap the icon representing the Mac that you want to receive 
the file. This icon appears under the AirDrop category, as shown in 
Figure  7-8 . The file gets stored in the Downloads folder of the Mac.  
 

122
CHAPTER 7: Sharing Files
 Using File Attachments with E- mail  
 AirDrop works fine with new Mac and iOS devices. However, what if you want to share a file 
on a Mac with a Windows or Linux PC, or an Android device? In these cases, you can’t use 
AirDrop, but you can use file attachments. 
 Since nearly all modern computers can send and receive e-mail, you can use e-mail to send 
files, which are known as  file attachments. To send file attachments by e-mail, you need to 
set up an e-mail account on your Mac (see Chapter   18 ) and know the e-mail address on the 
other device. 
 To send a file attachment by e-mail, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the Go menu and choose Applications (Go ➤ Applications), 
or just click the Applications folder in the sidebar of the Finder 
window. A list of all applications on your Mac appears.  
 Figure 7-8.   The Mac appears as an icon under the AirDrop category 
 

123
CHAPTER 7: Sharing Files
 3. 
 Double-click the Mail icon to open the Mail program. (Make sure that 
you have an e-mail account in the Mail program.)  
 4. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Message (File ➤ New 
Message). The New Message window appears.  
 5. 
 Click the file attachment icon in the upper-right corner (it looks like a 
paperclip), as shown in Figure  7-9 . A window appears, letting you 
click the file that you want to send.  
 Note  You may want to compress a file first before sending it by e-mail to make it smaller or to 
send multiple files at once. 
 Figure 7-9.    The file  attachment icon in the New Message window 
 6. 
 Click a file to attach to your e-mail message. (If you hold down the 
Command key, you can click and select two or more files to attach to 
the e-mail message.)  
 7. 
 Click the Choose File button to attach the selected files to your 
e-mail message, as shown in Figure  7-10 . At this point, you need to 
type an e-mail address and a subject, and then click the Send icon, 
which looks like a paper airplane icon in the upper-left corner.  
 

124
CHAPTER 7: Sharing Files
 Summary 
 Before you share files with another computer, make sure that other computer can open 
your file. You may need to export your file into another file format or make sure that another 
computer can import your file. 
 If you just want to share a file for someone to view but not edit, then you can save the file in 
the .pdf file format, which practically every computer can open. If you want to share a file for 
someone else to edit, save it in a commonly used file format. 
 For graphics, that means saving files in .jpg, .png, or .psd files that nearly every graphics 
program can import. For word processor documents, save files in .doc or .docx format. 
For spreadsheets, save files in .xls or .xlsx format. For presentations, save files in .ppt or 
.pptx format. 
 To make it easy to share files, compress files. Compressed files take up less space and let 
you combine multiple files into a single file. 
 If you need to share files within other Apple products, such as a Mac or an iPhone, use 
AirDrop. AirDrop can wirelessly transfer files. If you need to transfer files to non-Apple 
products, attach the file to an e-mail message. 
 Files contain important data so make sure that you know how to share files with others. 
After all, your data is only useful if someone else can use it.  
 Figure 7-10.   The Choose File button lets you attach one or more files to an e-mail message

 Part II 
 Customizing OS X 
 When you first plug in a Macintosh and turn it on, it looks exactly like every other Macintosh 
in the world. While this is nice, you may want to spend a little time customizing the way that 
your Macintosh looks and works. 
 Such customization can make your Macintosh a unique expression of your own personality. 
For example, you might want to display personal pictures on your screen, or you may want 
to install certain programs, such as games or specialized software that helps you write 
novels or create animated cartoons. 
 By learning to customize your Macintosh for personal reasons or for productivity needs, 
you can turn your Macintosh into a specialized machine that’s uniquely suited to help make 
your life easier.

 Chapter 8  
 Using the Dock and the 
Launchpad 
 To find a program or file, you normally have to open a Finder window and then look for the 
program or file that you want to use. This means going through several steps just to start a 
program. If you use a program or file often, going through multiple steps can be annoying. 
 OS X offers the Dock as a place to store commonly used programs, files, and folders so that 
you can access them with one click. The Dock doesn’t have room to store everything on 
your computer, just the programs, files, and folders that you use most often. 
 Think of the Dock as a shortcut to your favorite programs, files, and folders. 
 To customize the  dock  , you can add new icons that represent programs or files, rearrange 
icons, change the way the Dock appears, and even place the Dock on the left or right side of 
the screen instead of at the bottom. 
 The two main  features  of the Dock that are always visible are the Finder icon on the far left of 
the Dock and the Trash icon on the far right, as shown in Figure  8-1 . Unlike other icons on the 
Dock, you can never move the Finder icon or the Trash icon to a new position on the Dock.  
 Figure 8-1.    The  Finder and  Trash icons appear on opposite ends of the Dock 
 

128
CHAPTER 8: Using the Dock and the Launchpad
 Changing the Location of the  Dock  
 The dock normally appears at the bottom of the screen. If you don’t like this location, you 
can place the Dock in one of the following three locations:
  At the bottom of the screen (its default location)  
  On the left of the screen, as shown in Figure  8-2 
  On the right of the screen  
 Figure 8-2.   The Dock can appear on the left side of the screen 
 

129
CHAPTER 8: Using the Dock and the Launchpad
 The location of the Dock is solely your personal preference. No matter where you place the 
Dock, it behaves the same way. 
 To change the location of the Dock, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon in the upper-left corner of the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Click  System Preferences  to open the System Preferences window, 
as shown in Figure  8-3 . 
 Figure 8-3.    The  System Preferences window 
 3. 
 Click the Dock icon in the top row. The Dock window appears 
(see Figure  8-2 ). 
 4. 
 Click the Left, Bottom, or Right radio button in the “Position on 
screen” category.  
 5. 
 Click the red close button in the upper-left corner to make the Dock 
window disappear.  
 

130
CHAPTER 8: Using the Dock and the Launchpad
 Changing the Size of  Dock Icons  
 The more icons you place on the Dock, the more crowded the Dock will appear. To help you 
find icons on the Dock, you can increase or decrease the size of the icons that appear on the 
Dock, as shown in Figure  8-4 . 
 Figure 8-4.   Changing the Dock icons makes them easier to see or allows you to add more of them to the Dock 
 Increasing the Dock icons makes them easier to see but gives you less room to display 
icons. Decreasing the Dock icons allows more icons to appear on the dock but makes all of 
them smaller and harder to see. 
 To change the size of the Dock icons, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon in the upper-left corner of the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Click System Preferences to open the System Preferences window 
(see Figure  8-3 ).  
 3. 
 Click the Dock icon in the top row. The Dock window appears 
(see Figure  8-2 ).  
 4. 
 Drag the Size slider left (to make Dock icons smaller) or right 
(to make dock icons larger).  
 Magnifying the  Dock Icon 
 By shrinking Dock icons, you can display more of them on the screen. By increasing the size 
of Dock icons, you can see them easier. However, tiny Dock icons can be hard to see and 
larger Dock icons take up too much space. 
 For another way to modify the Dock icons, you can turn on magnification. With magnification 
turned on, all Dock icons remain the same size, but the moment you move the pointer over a 
Dock icon, magnification makes that icon temporarily expand in size. As soon as you move 
the pointer away from the Dock icon, all icons shrink back to their original size. 
 Magnification is a way to help make it easier to see your Dock icons, as shown in Figure  8-5 . 
 

131
CHAPTER 8: Using the Dock and the Launchpad
 To turn on magnification of the Dock icons, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon in the upper-left corner of the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Click System Preferences to open the System Preferences window, 
as shown in Figure  8-3 . 
 3. 
 Click the Dock icon in the top row. The Dock window appears 
(see Figure  8-2 ).  
 4. 
 Select the Magnification check box. (If the Magnification check box 
is clear, then magnification is turned off.)  
 5. 
 Drag the Magnification slider left or right to change the size of the 
Dock icon when the pointer appears over it.  
 Temporarily Hiding the Dock  
 Having the Dock appear all the time may clutter the screen. To solve this problem, you can 
make the Dock temporarily disappear. When the Dock is hidden, you can make it appear by 
moving the pointer to the Dock’s location. 
 So if the Dock appears at the bottom of the screen, you can make a hidden Dock appear 
by moving the pointer to the bottom of the screen. If the dock appears at the left side of 
the screen, you can make a hidden Dock appear by moving the pointer to the left side of 
the screen. 
 Note   Make sure that you know the location of the Dock before you hide it. That way you’ll know 
which edge of the screen to move the pointer to make the Dock appear again. 
 Figure 8-5.   Magnification enlarges icons near the pointer to make them easier to see 
 

132
CHAPTER 8: Using the Dock and the Launchpad
 To temporarily hide the Dock, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon in the upper-left corner of the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Click System Preferences to open the System Preferences window 
as shown in Figure  8-3 . 
 3. 
 Click the Dock icon in the top row. The Dock window appears 
(see Figure  8-2 ).  
 4. 
 Select (or clear) the “Automatically hide and show the Dock” 
check box.  
 Adding Folders to the Dock  
 In Chapter   3 , you learned how to add program icons to the Dock, rearrange them, and 
remove them as well. Putting program icons on the Dock gives you one-click access to your 
favorite programs. 
 However, you can also add folders to the Dock. This gives you one-click access to your 
favorite folders containing the files that you use most often. 
 The Dock actually consists of two parts. On the left side, program icons appear on the left 
and folder icons appear on the right, as shown in Figure  8-6 . 
 Figure 8-6.    The Dock contains program and folder icons 
 To place a folder on the Dock, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Find the folder that you want to place on the Dock.  
 3. 
 Move the pointer over the folder that you want to place on the 
Dock. Hold down the left mouse button (or press your finger on the 
trackpad) and drag the folder anywhere on the right side of the Dock. 
The current icons on the Dock slide out of the way to make room for 
your folder icon, as shown in Figure  8-7 . 
 

133
CHAPTER 8: Using the Dock and the Launchpad
 4. 
 Release the mouse or trackpad to place your folder on the Dock.  
 Displaying Folder Contents  
 Once you’ve placed a folder on the  Dock , you can view its contents by clicking its icon on 
the Dock. You can display your folder contents as a fan, grid, or list. If you aren’t sure which 
method to use, you can choose the Automatic option to let OS X choose for you based on 
the number of items in the folder. 
 The  Fan  view is best when folders contain a small number of files, so that you can easily see 
all of them at once, as shown in Figure  8-8 . 
 Figure 8-7.   Dragging a folder from the Finder window to the Dock 
 

134
CHAPTER 8: Using the Dock and the Launchpad
 Figure 8-8.    The  Fan style  displays files as icons 
 

135
CHAPTER 8: Using the Dock and the Launchpad
 The  Grid style  displays files in rows, which are easier to see if the folder contains many files, 
as shown in Figure  8-9 .  
 Figure 8-9.    The  Grid style displays folder contents in rows 
 

136
CHAPTER 8: Using the Dock and the Launchpad
 The  List style  is best at showing all the contents of a folder in a condensed style, although it 
may be hard to read because the text is tiny, as shown in Figure  8-10 . 
 Figure 8-10.   The  List style displays file and folder names in a vertical column 
 

137
CHAPTER 8: Using the Dock and the Launchpad
 To define how a folder displays its contents from the Dock, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Right-click the folder that you want to modify. A pop-up menu 
appears, as shown in Figure  8-11 . 
 Figure 8-11.   Right-clicking a folder icon displays a pop-up menu 
 2. 
 Click Fan, Grid, List, or Automatic under the View content as 
category. If you choose Automatic, OS X will display a folder’s 
contents based on how many items are stored inside.  
 Once you define how to display a folder’s contents, you can click that folder to display the 
contents of that folder in your chosen style (Fan, Grid, or List).  
 

138
CHAPTER 8: Using the Dock and the Launchpad
 Displaying Folder Contents in the Finder Window 
 When you display folder contents in the Fan, Grid, or List view, you can open a file by 
double-clicking on that file icon. 
 The problem with the Fan, Grid, and List views is that you may prefer to view a folder’s 
contents in the more familiar Finder window. 
 To display a folder’s contents in the Finder window, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Right-click the folder that you want to open. A pop-up menu appears 
(see Figure  8-11 ).  
 2. 
 Click Open.  
 Using the  Launchpad  
 If you’re more familiar with iOS, you might prefer displaying program icons as if they were on 
an iPhone or iPad screen. To do this, OS X provides a special program called Launchpad. 
 To run Launchpad, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the Go menu and choose Applications (Go ➤ Applications). 
Look for the Launchpad icon, as shown in Figure  8-12 . 
 Figure 8-12.    The  Launchpad icon 
 

139
CHAPTER 8: Using the Dock and the Launchpad
 3. 
 Double-click the Launchpad icon. Launchpad appears, displaying 
your program icons like an iPhone or iPad display, as shown in 
Figure  8-13 . 
 Figure 8-13.   Launchpad displays OS X programs like an iOS screen 
 4. 
 Click any program that you want to run.  
 While in Launchpad, you still have access to the Dock. Launchpad just displays all of your 
program icons on the screen at once. 
 Note   If you have a trackpad, you can pinch four fingers on the trackpad surface as a shortcut to 
open Launchpad. 
 

140
CHAPTER 8: Using the Dock and the Launchpad
 To exit out of Launchpad, press the Esc key on the keyboard, or click in the gray area on the 
right or left side of the screen, making sure that you don’t click any program icons.  
 Summary 
 The Dock acts as a shortcut to your favorite programs or folders. You can place the Dock on 
the left, right, or bottom of the screen, or even temporarily hide it from sight until you move 
the pointer toward the screen edge to make it appear again. 
 To customize the Dock, you can shrink or enlarge the size of its icons. You can also magnify 
icons so that they appear enlarged only when the pointer appears over them. 
 To clear the screen, you can also make the Dock temporarily disappear. When you want the 
Dock to appear again, just move the pointer toward the edge of where the Dock is located 
(on the left, right, or bottom of the screen). 
 Besides placing program icons on the Dock, you can also place folders on the Dock. 
You can open a folder within the Finder window or by displaying icons on the screen as a 
fan, grid, or list. 
 Finally, if you’re more comfortable using apps on iOS, you can make OS X display all of your 
programs as icons in a grid. To do this, you need to run a program called Launchpad. 
 The Dock and Launchpad act like shortcuts to help you find and run your favorite programs. 
By taking the time to learn how the Dock and Launchpad work, you can make your Mac 
even easier to use.

 Chapter 9  
 Installing Software  
 Every Mac comes with plenty of free software, but it’s likely you’ll want to install additional 
programs on your Mac. Installing software on a Mac might seem straightforward, but you 
need to be aware of several issues. 
 First, most newer Mac computers don’t have a DVD drive, which means you have to either 
get an external DVD drive or download a program from a web site. 
 Second, OS X tries to protect your Mac from malware (viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, etc.), 
so you can’t always install software from the Internet without going through additional steps. 
 Of course, once you install software, you may want to remove that software later. In this 
chapter, you’ll learn all the different ways to install software on a Mac. 
 There are three ways that you can install  software  on your Mac:
 Download a program from the Internet  
 Install a program from a DVD  
 Install a program from the Mac App Store  
 Of these three, installing a program from a DVD or from the  Mac App Store  are the two 
safest methods. When you install software from the Internet, you need to take extra 
precautions. 
 Note   One big advantage of installing software from the Mac App Store is that if you ever delete a 
program by mistake or lose your Mac, you can always reconnect to the Mac App Store to download 
and reinstall the software without having to find serial codes or installation DVDs. 

142
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
 Finding Software on the  Mac App Store  
 The Mac App Store contains a library of software that Apple has examined to make sure 
it’s safe. The disadvantage of the Mac App Store is that it doesn’t contain all available 
OS X software. 
 To access the Mac App Store, you need an Apple ID, which is linked to a credit card. That 
allows you to purchase software securely without needing to retype a credit card number 
each time you want to buy another program from the Mac App Store. 
 The Mac App Store serves two  purposes  . One, it provides a place for you to search for and 
purchase programs. Two, it provides a way to update any programs currently installed on 
your Mac. 
 To view the Mac App Store, make sure that you have an Internet connection and then follow 
these steps:
  1.   Click the Apple icon in the upper-left corner of the menu bar.  
  2.   Click App Store to open the App Store window, as shown in 
Figure  9-1 . 
 Note  To get a free Apple ID, visit   https://appleid.apple.com . 

143
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
 There are several ways to search for a program within the Mac App Store. The App Store 
window organizes software into the following three groups:
 Featured  
 Top Charts  
 Categories  
 The  Featured group  lists the newest or most popular programs that Apple wants to highlight 
(see Figure  9-1 ). 
 Figure 9-1.    The  Mac App Store window 
 

144
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
 The Top  Charts category lists the most popular paid programs, the most popular free 
programs, and the programs earning the most money through the Mac App Store 
(see Figure  9-2 ). 
 Figure 9-2.   The Top Charts  category lists the most popular programs in the Mac App Store 
 

145
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
 The  Categories group  lists software according to their function, such as medical, video, 
finance, games, or travel, as shown in Figure  9-3 . 
 Figure 9-3.    The  Categories group lists available software by function 
 By clicking a particular group, you can browse through all available software in that group, 
such as all games or all sports programs. 
 

146
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
 Figure 9-4.   Searching for a  program in the App Store window 
 Another way to browse through the Mac App Store is to search it. To search for a program 
by name or by function, follow these steps:
  1.  Click the Apple icon in the upper-left corner of the menu bar.  
  2.  Click App Store to open the Mac App Store window (see Figure  9-1 ).  
  3.  Click in the Search field in the upper-right corner of the App Store window.  
  4.  Type all or part of a program name or category type (such as 
health or finance) and press Return. The App Store window lists all 
programs that match your search criteria, as shown in Figure  9-4 . 
 

147
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
 Figure 9-5.    Viewing an individual program in the App Store 
 Viewing Software on the  Mac App Store  
 Whether you search for a program or you find a program through the Featured, Top Charts, 
or Category groups, you can view more details about a particular program by clicking its 
icon. When you select a program, the App Store window displays more information about 
that program, such as price, description, and screenshots, as shown in Figure  9-5 . 
 

148
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
 If you scroll down, you see reviews of the program, which can help you decide whether to 
buy it (see Figure  9-6 ).  
 Figure 9-6.    Viewing program reviews 
 

149
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
 Installing Software from the  Mac App Store  
 Once you find a program that you like, you can install it by clicking the price button or the 
Get button, as shown in Figure  9-7 . 
 Figure 9-7.   Paid programs display a price button but free programs display the Get button 
 If you click a price button, you need to enter your Apple ID password to verify that you 
want to purchase the program. If you click the Get button to download a free program, the 
Get button turns into an Install button, which you need to click to install the software on 
your Mac. 
 If you have already purchased (whether the program cost money or was free) and 
downloaded a program from the Mac App Store, you simply see an Open button to show 
that you have already installed the program on your Mac. Clicking the Open button starts the 
program on your computer.  
 Installing Software from the  Internet  
 Not all programs available for the Mac appear in the Mac App Store. Some developers prefer 
to distribute their software themselves, so you can find plenty of programs available for 
downloading. 
 Some of these programs are free but many cost money. The typical way to distribute 
software over the Internet is to bundle it in a special file called a .dmg, which stands for Disk 
iMaGe file. 
 

150
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
 Once you’ve saved a .dmg file on your Mac, the next step is to open that .dmg file by 
double-clicking it. When you open a .dmg file, the following two things happen 
(also see Figure  9-9 ):
 The .dmg file creates a virtual disk that appears in the sidebar of the 
Finder window  
 A Finder window opens and displays the program icon and the 
Applications folder  
 Figure 9-8.   A .dmg file contains all the files of a program condensed in a single file 
 A  .dmg file  essentially contains all the files of an entire program, so the first step is to 
download the program’s .dmg file to your Mac, which usually stores downloaded files in the 
Downloads folder, as shown in Figure  9-8 . 
 

151
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
 To install the program on your Mac at this point, follow these steps:
  1.   Move the pointer over the program icon. Hold down the left mouse 
button (or press a finger on the trackpad) and drag the program icon 
over the Applications folder.  
  2.   Release the left mouse button or trackpad when the program icon 
appears directly over the Applications folder. The program is now 
installed in the Applications folder.  
  3.   Click the eject icon (it looks like a triangle above a horizontal line) that 
appears to the right of the virtual disk icon in the sidebar of the 
Finder window. This removes the Finder window of the .dmg file that 
you just opened.  
 Installing Software  Blocked from Running  
 One huge danger of downloading and installing software from the Internet is that you 
may not know whether the program is legitimate or not. Many malicious hackers create 
malware (malicious software) designed to delete files or steal important information such as 
passwords or credit card numbers. 
 Note  To complete the installation process, you may need to type a serial code when you first start 
the program. Once done, you won’t have to type it again. However, keep the serial code in a safe 
place in case you need to install the software again at a later date. 
 Figure 9-9.   Opening a .dmg file 
 

152
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
 To protect you from downloading and running malware by mistake, your Mac may prevent 
you from opening a program that you just installed from a .dmg file. This warning message 
identifies the program that you’re trying to run (including the time and web site that you 
downloaded it from), as shown in Figure  9-10 . 
 Figure 9-10.   OS X may block you from running a program for the first time 
 To modify your computer’s security settings and allow a program to run for the first time, 
click the OK button to make the warning message go away, and then follow these steps:
  1.  Click the Apple icon on the menu bar in the upper-left corner of the 
screen.  
  2.  Choose System Preferences. The System Preferences window 
appears.  
  3.  Click the Security & Privacy icon. The Security & Privacy window 
appears.  
  4.  Click the General tab. The bottom of the window explains which 
program your Mac may have stopped from installing, as shown in 
Figure  9-11 . 
 

153
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
  5.  Click the Open Anyway button. Another message asks if you’re sure 
that you want to open the .dmg file (see Figure  9-12 ). 
 Figure 9-11.   The Security & Privacy window shows you which .dmg file it blocked from installing 
 Figure 9-12.   A message asks if you want to open a .dmg file 
 
 

154
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
  6.  Click the Open button. A window asks for your password to verify 
that you want to open and run the blocked program.  
  7.  Type the password that lets you access your Mac and then click the 
OK button. You can now run your newly installed program. You won’t 
have to go through these steps again for this particular program.  
 Modifying Security Preferences for Downloaded  Software  
 If you want to modify the security features of OS X for downloaded software, you can 
change its settings to one of three options:
 Mac App Store: Allows installation of software downloaded from the 
Mac App Store only  
 Mac App Store and identified developers: Allows installation of software 
from the Mac App Store and major software publishers, such as 
Microsoft and Adobe  
 Anywhere: Turns off security features that block potential malware  
 Restricting software so that it is only downloadable from the Mac App Store provides the 
most security, but not all programs are available through the Mac App Store. As a result, this 
option can keep you from installing legitimate programs downloaded from web sites. 
 Allowing software to be installed from anywhere is the most dangerous option since it 
eliminates all possible security features. In general, it’s not a good idea to choose this option 
because it could allow malware to install itself on your Mac without your acknowledgement. 
 The default option of Mac App Store and identified developers is the safest choice. Unless 
you otherwise have a good reason, it’s best to use this option. 
 To modify security preferences, follow these steps:
  1.  Click the Apple icon on the menu bar in the upper-left corner of the 
screen.  
  2.  Choose System Preferences. A System Preferences window 
appears.  
  3.  Click the Security & Privacy icon. A Security & Privacy window 
appears.  
  4.  Click the General tab. The bottom of the window displays a lock icon 
in the bottom-left corner, as shown in Figure  9-13 . Notice that the 
bottom of the window shows your download security options 
grayed out.  

155
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
  5.  Click the lock icon in the bottom-left corner of the Security & Privacy window. 
A window appears, asking for your password, as shown in Figure  9-14 . 
 Figure 9-13.   Security preferences are locked to prevent unauthorized changes 
 Figure 9-14.   To change security preferences, you must type your password 
 
 

156
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
  6.  Type your password in the Password field and click the Unlock 
button. The Security & Privacy window now lets you choose the 
download security options, as shown in Figure  9-15 . 
 Figure 9-15.   After unlocking, the Security & Privacy window now lets you choose a different security setting 
  7.  Click a radio button, such as Mac App Store or Anywhere.  
  8.  Click the lock icon to lock your choice.  
  9.  Click the red button in the upper-left corner (the close button) to 
make the Security & Privacy window disappear.  
 

157
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
 Installing Programs from a  DVD 
 If you buy software in a store, it will likely be on a DVD. To install software on a DVD, you 
must have a DVD drive. Older Mac models come with a built-in DVD drive but newer 
models do not. 
 To install software on a Mac without a DVD drive, you have to either plug an external DVD drive 
into your Mac or download the program file (.dmg) from the software publisher’s web site. 
 When you install software from a DVD (or sometimes even from the Internet), the program 
may appear as a .pkg (package) file. When you double-click a .pkg file to open it, it typically 
runs its own installation program. 
 To install software from a DVD, follow these steps:
  1.  Insert the software DVD into the DVD drive of your Mac. A window 
appears, displaying an installation program icon, as shown 
in Figure  9-16 . 
 Figure 9-16.   Software on a DVD typically contains its own installation programs 
 

158
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
  2.  Double-click the installation program icon and follow the steps to 
install the program, such as defining the location to store the 
program.  
 Uninstalling Programs  
 Once you have installed a program, you may want to remove it from your Mac one day. To 
remove or uninstall a program, follow these steps:
  1.  Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
  2.  Click the Go menu and choose Applications (Go ➤ Applications). 
Look for the program that you want to uninstall.  
  3.  Choose one of the following:
 
 a.  Move the pointer over the program icon that you want to uninstall. 
Hold down the left mouse button (or press one finger on the 
trackpad). Drag the icon over the Trash icon on the Dock. Release 
the mouse or trackpad.  
 
 b.  Click the program icon that you want to uninstall. Click the File 
menu and choose Move to Trash (File ➤ Move to Trash).  
 
 c.  Right-click the program icon that you want to uninstall, and when 
a pop-up menu appears, choose Move to Trash.  
 To permanently delete a program from your Mac, right-click the Trash icon on the Dock. 
When a pop-up menu appears, choose Empty Trash. 
 If you change your mind about uninstalling a program after you’ve moved it to the Trash, 
follow these steps:
  1.  Right-click the Trash icon on the Dock. A pop-up menu appears.  
  2.  Choose Open. A Finder window appears, listing the contents of the 
Trash. 
  3.  Right-click the program icon that you want to keep. A pop-up menu 
appears.  
  4.  Choose Put Back. The Finder puts the program icon back in the 
Applications folder (or whichever folder that it was originally stored in).  
 Note   After you install software from a DVD, store the DVD and any serial codes in a safe place in 
case you need to reinstall the software later. 

159
CHAPTER 9: Installing Software
 Summary 
 Installing software is the most common way to customize your Mac so that it can perform 
the tasks you need. You can buy software through the Mac App Store, from a retail store, or 
directly from a software publisher’s web site. 
 The safest way to get software is either from the Mac App Store or from the software 
publisher’s official DVD installation disc. 
 When downloading and installing software from the Internet, make sure that you trust the 
source to avoid infecting your computer with malware by mistake. OS X provides three 
security settings for protecting your Mac:
 Mac App Store  
 Mac App Store and identified developers  
 Anywhere  
 If you choose the Anywhere option, OS X will not block any new programs from running. 
If you choose either the Mac App Store option or the Mac App Store and Identified 
Developers option, then OS X alerts you when you first try to run a program downloaded 
from the Internet. 
 To uninstall a program from a Mac, just drag the program icon out of the Applications folder 
(or wherever it might be stored) and drop it in the Trash icon on the Dock. 
 The more you use a Mac, the more likely you’ll need to install programs and occasionally 
uninstall programs that you no longer use. With the right software, you can customize your 
Mac to perform nearly any task.

 Chapter 10  
 Customizing the Screen  
 You’re going to spend most of your time looking at the screen of your Mac, so why not 
customize its appearance to make your computer uniquely yours? Customization can be for 
fun, such as displaying pictures of your family or pets on the screen, or practical, such as 
creating shortcuts to make your tasks easier and faster. 
 The following are some of the ways that  you  customize your screen:
 Change the desktop wallpaper  
 Choose screen savers  
 Create shortcuts  
 Changing the  Desktop Wallpaper  
 The desktop fills the entire screen, so it is the first image that you see when you turn on your 
Mac. In the old days, computer screens displayed a solid black or white background. While 
you could still use a solid color, you also have the option to display pictures, which is called 
 wallpaper . 
 Like real wallpaper, the wallpaper on your desktop simply provides decoration on the screen. 
You can place any picture you want on the desktop, including photos that you captured on 
your digital camera or pictures that you downloaded from the Internet. 
 If you get tired of looking at the same picture all the time, you can even have different 
pictures appear at random intervals. Wallpaper doesn’t do anything useful, but it does make 
using a Mac a little more fun. 
 Note   When you customize the way that your Mac looks and behaves, it won’t look or behave 
like any other Mac. If you use multiple Mac computers, you may want to customize all of them 
identically. 

162
CHAPTER 10: Customizing the Screen
 When you want to change the desktop wallpaper, you must choose the location of a 
particular picture. Every Mac lets you choose from three different options to choose a folder 
that contains a picture:
 Apple: Lets you choose images or solid colors provided by Apple  
 Photos: Lets you choose any images stored in the Photos app that you 
captured with a digital camera  
 Folders: Lets you use pictures stored in any folder on your Mac, such as 
the Pictures folder or any other folder that you have created  
 To change your desktop wallpaper, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon in the upper-left corner of the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Click System Preferences to open the System Preferences window.  
 3. 
 Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon, as shown in Figure  10-1 .

Desktop & Screen Saver window to make it disappear.  
 

167
CHAPTER 10: Customizing the Screen
 Choosing Pictures Randomly or  Sequentially  
 Normally when you select a desktop wallpaper, your selection is permanent until you select 
another wallpaper image. However, if you like variety, you can periodically alternate your 
desktop wallpaper with a different image, such as every 30 minutes. 
 OS X can pick a new picture in the same folder in two different ways:
 Sequentially choose another picture in the same folder by file name  
 Randomly choose another picture in the same folder  
 If a folder contains ten images, then OS X will only use those ten images. Ideally, you want to 
choose a folder with plenty of images that you won’t mind viewing and displaying to anyone 
who can look at your Mac screen. 
 To change desktop wallpaper images, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon in the upper-left corner of the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Click System Preferences to open the System Preferences window.  
 3. 
 Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon (see Figure  10-1 ). 
 4. 
 Select the “Change picture” check box. The pop-up menu on the 
right no longer appears grayed out.  
 5. 
 Click in the pop-up menu and choose a time interval, as shown 
in Figure  10-6 . 
 Note  Make sure that you don’t choose a folder that contains potentially embarrassing or 
inappropriate images. 

168
CHAPTER 10: Customizing the Screen
 Figure 10-6.   When the “Change picture” check box is selected, you can choose a time interval 
 6. 
 (Optional) Select the “Random order” check box if you want OS X 
to pick a picture at random. If this check box is clear, OS X picks 
pictures sequentially so that you see the pictures in the same order.  
 7. 
 Click the red button (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the 
Desktop & Screen Saver window to make it disappear.  
 Defining How to Display a Small  Picture  
 If you choose an Apple wallpaper image or a solid color, it fills the entire screen. However, 
other types of pictures, such as those you took with a digital camera, may not be large 
enough to fill the entire screen. 
 

169
CHAPTER 10: Customizing the Screen
 OS X provides five different ways to use images that do not fill the entire screen:
 Fill Screen: Expands a picture so that it fills the entire screen, but part of 
the picture may be cut off to do so  
 Fit to Screen: Expands a picture until its width or height fills the screen, 
which could leave empty space on the sides  
 Stretch to Fit Screen: Stretches the height and width of a picture to 
make it fill the entire screen, but may skewer the appearance of images  
 Center: Displays the image in its original size in the center of the screen  
 Tile: Displays the image in rows and columns to fill the screen, as shown 
in Figure  10-7 
 Figure 10-7.   Tiling displays the same image multiple times in rows and columns 
 To make a small picture the desktop wallpaper, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon in the upper-left corner of the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Click System Preferences to open the System Preferences window.  
 3. 
 Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon (see Figure  10-1 ).

CHAPTER 10: Customizing the Screen
 Defining a Screen  Saver 
 Back when computers used  cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitors  , leaving the same image on 
the screen for long periods could literally burn that image into the glass screen. If you look 
at old arcade games or automated-teller machines, you can sometimes see this faint, ghost-
like image on the screen, even though the screen may be turned off. 
 To prevent the screen from burning a static image in the glass, people used special 
programs called  screen savers . The idea behind screen savers was that displaying a 
constantly changing image on the screen reduced the chance of one image appearing on 
the screen long enough to burn it into the glass. 
 Nowadays, screen savers are far less important because flat-screen monitors pose far less 
risk of burning a static image on the screen. Nevertheless, some people still prefer screen 
savers to make sure burn-in never occurs and to provide a pleasant display if you don’t use 
your Mac for a fixed period, such as five minutes. 
 Since screen savers are still popular, OS X provides a series of built-in screen savers that 
you can choose from. When choosing a screen saver, you need to choose a type and a time 
interval of inactivity to wait before the screen saver starts running. 
 To choose a screen saver for your Mac, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon on the menu bar in the upper-left corner of the 
screen.  
 2. 
 Choose System Preferences. A System Preferences window 
appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon. A Desktop & Screen Saver 
window appears.  
 4. 
 Click the Screen Saver tab. A list of different screen savers appears 
on the left of the window, as shown in Figure  10-9 .

CHAPTER 10: Customizing the Screen
 6. 
 Click the “Start after” pop-up menu and choose a time interval 
to wait before the screen saver starts running, as shown in 
Figure  10-10 . This time interval begins after detecting no activity 
from the mouse, trackpad, or keyboard.

CHAPTER 10: Customizing the Screen
 Defining  Hot Corner Shortcuts  
 Normally, you have to choose a command from a pull-down menu or type a keystroke 
shortcut, such as Command+S to save a file or Command+O to open a file on the Mac. 
 As another way to create shortcuts, you can use  hot corners . A hot corner is one of four 
corners on the screen where you can move the pointer. As soon as you shove the pointer in 
one corner, your hot corner can perform one of the following tasks:
 Start Screen Saver: Starts your screen saver right away, which is handy 
when you need to step away from your Mac and don’t want anyone to 
see what you’re currently working on.  
 Disable Screen Saver: Keeps the screen saver from running no matter 
how long you may be away from your Mac.  
 Mission Control: Displays all open windows on the screen at once so 
that you can pick an open window by clicking it.  
 Application Windows: Hides all windows except for the currently active 
window that you’re using right now.  
 Desktop: Temporarily hides all open windows and displays the desktop.  
 Dashboard: Opens Dashboard, a screen that displays simple utility 
programs.  
 Notification Center: Displays the Notification Center window on the right 
side of the screen.  
 Launchpad: Displays the Launchpad screen.  
 Put Display to Sleep: Powers down your monitor to conserve power. 
Unlike a screen saver, putting your display to sleep simply blacks out 
your screen.  
 You can define up to four hot-corner shortcuts, but each hot corner can only represent one 
shortcut. You can assign the same shortcut to two or more different hot corners if you want, 
but you cannot assign more than one shortcut to a hot corner. 
 To define a hot-corner shortcut, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon on the menu bar in the upper-left corner of 
the screen.  
 2. 
 Choose System Preferences. A System Preferences window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon. A Desktop & Screen Saver 
window appears.  
 4. 
 Click the Screen Saver tab. A list of different screen savers appears 
on the left side of the window (see Figure  10-9 ). 
 5. 
 Click the Hot Corners button. An image shows the four corners of 
the screen.

CHAPTER 10: Customizing the Screen
 Password Protecting a  Mac 
 When you don’t use your Mac for a fixed amount of time, the screen saver starts displaying 
moving images on the screen. If you put your display to sleep to conserve power, it displays 
a blank screen. 
 The moment you touch the mouse, trackpad, or keyboard, your screen saver stops running 
or your Mac wakes up from sleep and turns the power back on to the monitor. However, 
this allows anyone to walk up to your Mac, tap the keyboard, mouse, or trackpad, and 
immediately get access to your computer. 
 To prevent this, you may want to turn on password protection. That way, if someone turns 
off your screen saver or wakes up your Mac from sleep by tapping the keyboard, mouse, or 
trackpad, they won’t be able to access your Mac without typing a password first. 
 If you want to limit access to your Mac, it’s a good idea to turn on password protection. 
To do so, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon on the menu bar in the upper-left corner of the 
screen.  
 2. 
 Choose System Preferences. A System Preferences window 
appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Security & Privacy icon. A Security & Privacy window 
appears.  
 4. 
 Click the General tab.  
 5. 
 Click the lock icon in the bottom-left corner of the Security & Privacy 
window. Type your password in the password text field when it 
appears. The lock icon changes into an unlocked padlock icon and 
all options under the General tab appear visible so that you can 
choose them, as shown in Figure  10-13 .

check box and then click the Set Lock Message to show a message 
on the screen.  
 8. 
 Make sure that the “Disable automatic login” check box is selected 
because it keeps someone from turning your Mac off and on again to 
gain access.

 Saving  Power 
 If you have a laptop, you’ll be especially concerned about saving power since it can prolong 
your battery. Even if you have a desktop Mac, you may still want to save power to reduce 
your electricity bill. 
 With a laptop, there are slightly different power setting options on your laptop for when it is 
running on batteries or plugged into an electrical outlet, as shown in Figures  10-15 and  10-16 .  
 Figure 10-15.    The power settings for a laptop running on battery power 
 

181
CHAPTER 10: Customizing the Screen
 The following are some of the energy saving options:
 A slider that defines the length of inactive time before turning off 
the display.  
 Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off: 
Keeps the computer from conserving power by going to sleep.  
 Put hard disks to sleep when possible: Conserves power by reducing 
electrical use for the hard disk.  
 Wake for network access: Wakes a computer if it receives data through 
the Internet.  
 Enable Power Nap: Allows your Mac to conserve power while still 
performing background tasks, such as backing up your data or 
checking for new e-mail.  
 To modify your Mac’s energy settings, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon on the menu bar in the upper-left corner 
of the screen.  
 2. 
 Choose System Preferences. A System Preferences window 
appears.

 4. 
 Select any of the energy saving options. (Click the Restore Defaults 
button to use the original energy saving settings defined by Apple.)  
 5. 
 Click the red button (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the 
Energy Saver window to make it disappear.  
 Summary 
 The appearance of your screen doesn’t have to be boring. You can customize its look and 
behavior to make your Mac uniquely your own. The simplest way to change the look of your 
Mac is to select a desktop wallpaper, which could be an image provided by Apple, a picture 
from the Internet, or a photo that you captured with your digital camera. 
 Another way to customize your screen is to choose a screen saver. A screen saver can 
automatically run after a period of inactivity when you don’t touch the keyboard, mouse, 
or trackpad. When the Mac detects inactivity for a fixed amount of time, it can run a 
screen saver. 
 To make using your Mac easier, you can define shortcuts for all four corners of the screen. 
These hot corners can activate a shortcut the moment that you put the pointer in a corner 
using the mouse or trackpad. 
 To restrict access to your Mac, you can password protect it. Not only can a password keep 
someone from accessing your Mac when they first turn it on, but it can also block someone 
from using your Mac immediately after your computer wakes up from sleep or when 
someone turns off the screen saver by tapping the keyboard, mouse, or trackpad. 
 Don’t worry about every possible option available for customizing your Mac. Just choose 
the features that you need and ignore the rest. By customizing your Mac, you can make it 
secure, easy, and fun to use every day.

 Customizing the Finder 
Window 
 No matter what you need to do, the program you’ll likely use most often is the Finder. With 
the Finder, you can find, open, rename, copy, move, and delete files. By customizing the 
Finder, you can make it easier to use. 
 The following are some of the ways that you can customize the  Finder  :
 Change the sidebar on the left side of the Finder window  
 Change the toolbar at the top of the Finder window  
 Change the behavior of the Finder window  
 Changing the  Sidebar 
 The sidebar gives you access to your frequently used folders, such as Documents, Pictures, 
and Movies. In addition, the sidebar displays a list of external drives connected to your 
Macintosh, such as an external hard disk or a USB flash drive. If you use tags to identify 
certain files, you can display tags in the sidebar; one tap of a tag in the sidebar helps you 
find all files with this tag. 
 Note   When you customize the way that your Macintosh looks and behaves, it won’t look or 
behave like any other Macintosh. If you use multiple Macintosh computers, you may want to 
customize them identically. 

184
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 Perhaps the simplest way to modify the sidebar in the Finder window is to expand or shrink 
its width. To change the width of the sidebar, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Move the pointer over the right edge of the sidebar pane until the 
pointer turns into a double-pointing arrow, as shown in Figure  11-1 . 
 Figure 11-1.   Dragging the edge of the sidebar pane can change its width 
 3. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or press one finger on the 
trackpad) and move the mouse (or finger) left and right to change the 
width of the sidebar pane.  
 4. 
 Release the mouse (or trackpad) when the sidebar pane is at the 
width you want.  
 If you look at the sidebar, you’ll see that it already contains different folders under the 
Favorites category, such as Applications, Downloads, and Pictures. 
 In general, you’ll probably want the Applications folder in the sidebar because that gives 
you access to all the programs installed on your Macintosh. Likewise, you’ll probably want 
to keep the Documents folder on the sidebar so that you can quickly find any files that you 
have created. 
 However, you may not want some of the other folders in the sidebar. For example, if you don’t 
save movies on your computer, you probably won’t care to open the Movies folder. Likewise, 
if you don’t use AirDrop, you probably won’t want the  AirDrop icon  cluttering up the sidebar. 
 

185
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 Since the sidebar exists to make it easier for you to access a folder, you can choose which 
folders appear in the sidebar. To modify (add or remove folders) that appear in the sidebar of 
the Finder window, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the far left end of the Dock. A Finder window 
appears and the Finder menu appears on the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Click the Finder menu title and choose Preferences (Finder ➤ Preferences). 
A Finder Preferences window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Sidebar icon. A list of different folders appears, as shown in 
Figure  11-2 . Check marks indicate the folders that appear in the Finder sidebar.  
 Figure 11-2.   Choosing which folders to appear in the Finder sidebar 
 

186
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 4. 
 Select the folders that you want to appear in the Finder sidebar by 
making sure that a check mark appears to its left. Prevent folders from 
appearing in the Finder sidebar by keeping the check box empty.  
 5. 
 Click the red close button in the upper-left corner to close the Finder 
Preferences window.  
 By taking the time to place the folders that you use most often in the Finder sidebar, you can 
access your favorite folders quickly and easily.  
 Adding Custom Folders to the Finder  Sidebar  
 If you customize the Finder sidebar through the Finder Preferences window (see Figure  11-2 ), 
you can only choose to display the most common folders, such as Documents, Music, or Movies. 
 Fortunately, you can add any folder to the Finder  sidebar  by following these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the far left end of the Dock. A Finder window 
appears and the Finder menu appears on the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Find the folder that you want to place on the Finder sidebar.  
 3. 
 Move the pointer over that folder. Hold down the left mouse button 
(or press one finger on the trackpad) and drag the folder over 
the sidebar. A horizontal line appears in the sidebar to show you 
where the folder will appear when you release the mouse button or 
trackpad, as shown in Figure  11-3 . 
 Figure 11-3.   Dragging and dropping places a folder in the sidebar 
 

187
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 4. 
 Release the mouse or trackpad. Your chosen folder now appears in 
the Finder sidebar.  
 If you don’t like the  drag-and-drop method  , follow these steps to choose another way to 
place a folder on the sidebar:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the far left end of the Dock. A Finder window 
appears. The Finder menu is on the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Click the folder that you want to place on the sidebar.  
 3. 
 Click the File menu and choose Add to Sidebar (File ➤ Add to 
Sidebar) or press Command+Control+T.  
 In case you don’t like the order that the Finder sidebar displays your folders, you can 
rearrange them any way that you want. To rearrange folders in the sidebar, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the far left end of the Dock. A Finder window 
appears and the Finder menu appears on the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Move the pointer over a folder in the sidebar. Hold down the left 
mouse button (or press one finger on the trackpad) and drag up or 
down. 
 3. 
 Release the mouse or trackpad when the folder appears in the 
position that you like.  
 If you realize that you don’t use a particular folder often enough, you can always remove it 
from the sidebar. To remove a folder from the sidebar, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the far left end of the Dock. A Finder window 
appears. The Finder menu is on the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Right-click over the folder in the sidebar that you want to remove. 
A pop-up menu appears.  
 3. 
 Choose Remove from Sidebar, as shown in Figure  11-4 . 
 Note   When you drag and drop a folder on the sidebar, you do not move the folder from its original 
location. 
 Note   Besides adding folders to the sidebar, you can add individual files as well. This lets you find 
and access important files quickly and easily. 

188
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 When you remove a folder from the sidebar, you don’t physically change that folder’s 
contents or original location.  
 Customizing the Default Folder to  Display 
 Each time that you start the Finder or choose File ➤ New Folder Window from the Finder 
menu bar, the Finder window displays the contents of a default folder. 
 Generally, you might want to open the Documents folder each time you create another 
Finder window, but if you want to make the Finder window display a different folder, you can 
choose another folder to open by default. 
 To define a default folder, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the far left end of the Dock. A Finder window 
appears. The Finder menu is on the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Click the Finder menu title and choose Preferences (Finder ➤ 
Preferences). A Finder Preferences window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the General icon. The “New Finder windows show” pop-up 
menu displays the current default folder, such as Documents, as 
shown in Figure  11-5 .

 Click a folder name, such as Desktop or Documents. Click Other… 
to select any folder on your Macintosh.  
 6. 
 Click the red close button in the upper-left corner to close the Finder 
Preferences window.  
 You can only choose one default folder to appear each time that you open a new Finder 
window. By defining a default Finder folder, you get quick access to the folder that you need 
most often.  
 Customizing the  Toolbar 
 The top of every Finder window contains various icons that provide a shortcut to common 
commands, as shown in Figure  11-7 . Some of these icons represent commands for deleting 
an item, changing the way a folder’s contents look, or sharing an item with others.  
 Figure 11-7.    The toolbar in the Finder window 
 

191
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 The following are some of the ways to customize the toolbar:
 Change the appearance of icons to display text in addition to or instead 
of icons  
 Rearrange the position of icons on the toolbar  
 Add or remove icons from the toolbar  
 Before you customize the Finder toolbar, you need to understand the purpose of the 
default toolbar icons so that you can better decide whether to keep or remove them 
(see Figure  11-8 ).  
 Figure 11-8.    The default toolbar icons 
 Under the Back category, you see Back and Forward buttons that work much like the back 
and forward buttons on a browser. To see how these buttons work, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the far left end of the Dock. A Finder window 
displays the contents of its default folder, such as Documents.  
 2. 
 Click any folder in the sidebar, such as Downloads or Music. The 
Finder window displays the contents of this new folder but also 
highlights the Back button.  
 3. 
 Click the Back button on the Finder toolbar. The Finder window now 
goes back to the folder displayed in step 1. Notice that the Forward 
button is now highlighted.  
 4. 
 Click the Forward button. The Finder window now goes back to the 
folder that you chose in step 2. By clicking the Back and Forward 
buttons, you can go back to the last folder that you opened or go 
forward to the folder that you had open prior to clicking the Back 
button. 
 Under the View category, there are four options to display items in the Finder window: as 
icons, in a list, in columns, or in Cover Flow. 
 Icons  make it easier to find an item but they take up more space (see Figure  11-9 ). 
 

192
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 Lists  take up less space and show more information, but they are harder to read 
(see Figure  11-10 ).  
 Figure 11-9.   Icon  view

193
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 Columns show the hierarchy of folders but are as hard to read as lists (see Figure  11-11 ). 
 Figure 11-11.   Column view 
 Cover  Flow lets you view the contents of files but takes up more space (see Figure  11-12 ). 
By clicking an icon in the View category, you can change the way that the Finder window 
displays its contents.  
 Figure 11-12.    The  Cover Flow view 
 
 

194
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 The  Arrange icon  lets you rearrange how the Finder displays items, such as alphabetically 
by name, chronologically by date created or modified, or by file size. By choosing a different 
way to arrange items in the Folder window, you can quickly find items, such as the most 
recent file that you created or modified (see Figure  11-13 ).  
 Figure 11-13.   Using the Arrange  icon to change the way the Finder window displays items 
 The  Action icon  (it looks like a gear icon) lets you perform common tasks on a file or folder, 
such as creating a new folder, showing a preview of the file’s contents, or opening the Info 
window of a file or folder. 
 When you click the Actions  icon  , you get a pull-down menu. This pull-down menu displays 
slightly different commands, depending on whether you selected a file, a folder, or 
nothing at all. 
 To see how the Actions  icon displays different commands in its pull-down menus, follow 
these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the far left end of the Dock. A Finder window 
appears and displays the contents of its default folder, such as 
Documents.  
 

195
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window

 Basically, the  Action icon  duplicates most of the commands on the File menu. 
 

197
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 The Share  icon lets you select one or more files or folders and send them to someone by 
e-mail. If you select a graphic file, you can also share a file through popular social networks, 
such as Twitter, Facebook, or Flickr, as shown in Figure  11-16 . 
 Figure 11-16.    The Share  icon lets you share a file or folder with others 
 

198
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 The  Quick Look icon  lets you preview the contents of a file without opening it in a program. 
If you click a word processor document, the Quick Look icon lets you browse the contents 
of that file. If you click a graphic image, you’ll see that image in a separate window, as 
shown in Figure  11-18 . If you click a movie or audio file, you’ll see that movie or hear that 
audio file.

CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 Changing the Appearance of the  Toolbar Icons 
 The toolbar on the Finder usually displays icons, but you can change its appearance in 
several ways:
 Icon and Text: Displays the icon and provides a descriptive label  
 Icon Only: Displays icons  
 Text Only: Displays only descriptive text  
 Hide Toolbar: Hides the toolbar  
 To change the appearance of the Finder’s toolbar, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the far left end of the Dock. A Finder window 
appears.  
 2. 
 Right-click the toolbar (but not on any icons) to make a pop-up menu 
appear, as shown in Figure  11-19 . 
 Figure 11-18.   The  Quick Look icon lets you view the contents of a file, such as a picture stored in a graphic file

CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 3. 
 Choose an option, such as Icon and Text, Icon Only, or Text Only. 
The Finder toolbar changes appearance based on your choice.  
 The appearance of the toolbar icons is solely for your own personal preference. Toolbar icons 
work identically whether they’re displayed as text, icons, or a combination of icons and text.  
 Customizing the  Toolbar 
 Rather than modify the appearance of the toolbar icons, you can add or remove icons on the 
toolbar. This lets you remove those icons you don’t need and replace them with icons you 
use most often. 
 To customize the toolbar, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the far left end of the Dock. A Finder window 
appears.  
 2. 
 Click the View menu and choose Customize Toolbar (View ➤ Customize 
Toolbar). You can also right-click the toolbar (but not on any icons) to 
bring up a pop-up menu to choose Customize Toolbar. A list of icons 
shows what you can add to the toolbar (see Figure  11-20 ).

 Click the Done button.  
 To remove an icon from the toolbar, repeat these steps—except rather than dragging and 
dropping an icon onto the toolbar, drag and drop the icon anywhere off the toolbar.  
 Using  Tabs 
 The simplest way to copy a file from one folder to another is to open two Finder windows 
and then drag a file from one Finder window into the second Finder window. If you’d rather 
not clutter your screen with multiple Finder windows, you can use tabs instead. 
 Tabs let you view the contents of two or more folders within a single Finder window. You can 
view the contents of different folders just by clicking a different tab.  
 Creating a Finder  Tab 
 The following describes the two ways to create a tab in the Finder window (also see 
Figure  11-22 ):
 Click the File menu and choose New Tab (File ➤ New Tab)  
 Press Command+T  
 Figure 11-22.   Creating tabs in the Finder window 
 

203
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 You can create as many tabs as you want but the more tabs that you create, the more 
crowded the Finder window will look. 
 Once you’ve created a tab, you can click that tab and select a folder. The name of the 
currently displayed folder appears in the tab, such as Downloads or Documents. 
 To copy a file from one folder to another, you can drag a file directly over a tab. So if you 
have a tab that displays the Documents folder, you could drag a file and drop it directly on 
the Documents tab. 
 If you don’t like the order of your tabs, you can rearrange their position by dragging a tab left 
or right with the mouse or trackpad.  
 Merging (and Separating) Finder  Tabs  
 If you have multiple Finder windows open, you can merge all open Finder windows into tabs 
within a single Finder window. To do this, click the Window menu and choose Merge All 
Windows (Window ➤ Merge All Windows). 
 If you have two or more tabs already displayed within a Finder window, you can separate 
tabs so that they appear in their own Finder window. To do this, click the Window menu and 
choose Move Tab to New Window (Window ➤ Move Tab to New Window). 
 It’s possible to have multiple Finder windows open and tabs within one or more Finder 
windows. 
 Closing Finder  Tabs  
 Once you’ve opened tabs within a Finder window, you can always close them. To close a 
tab, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the far left end of the Dock. A Finder window 
appears.  
 2. 
 Move the pointer over the tab in the Finder window that you want 
to close. A close icon (an X) appears on the left side of the tab, as 
shown in Figure  11-23 . 
 Figure 11-23.   The close icon appears on a tab when the pointer appears over that tab 
 3. 
 Click the close icon of the tab that you want to remove. The tab 
disappears.  
 

204
CHAPTER 11: Customizing the Finder Window
 Summary 
 You’ll likely use the Finder every time that you use a Macintosh, so take some time to 
understand how you can customize its features. Place your favorite folders in the sidebar for 
easy access. Modify the toolbar so that your most frequently used commands are available 
at all times. 
 The Finder toolbar contains a set of default icons, but you’ll probably want to remove icons 
that you don’t use and replace them with the icons you use most often. The less cluttered 
the toolbar, the less complicated the Finder window will look. 
 Remember, you can always modify the Finder toolbar at any time by adding new icons or 
removing old ones. You might also experiment with modifying the way the toolbar looks so 
that you can make the toolbar easier to read. 
 To avoid cluttering your screen with multiple Finder windows, you can create tabs. You can 
merge multiple Finder windows in tabs or separate tabs into their own Finder window. Tabs 
help keep your screen organized. 
 The Finder is one of the most crucial programs that you’ll use to manage files on your 
Macintosh. A little time spent modifying the Finder today will make your Macintosh much 
easier to use from now on.

 Chapter 12  
 Organizing Windows  
 No matter how big your screen may be (even if you have multiple screens), there never 
seems to be enough room to show everything. You can minimize windows or temporarily 
hide them, but a more elegant solution might be to use multiple desktops. 
 When you first start your Mac, you’ll see the desktop displaying its wallpaper background 
image. Any program windows you open all appear on this desktop. If you open too many 
windows, your desktop becomes cluttered. 
 To solve this problem, you have several options:
 Minimize one or more windows to tuck them out of sight on the Dock  
 Hide windows  
 Use Mission Control to view all open windows  
 Use Mission Control to create multiple desktops  
 Minimizing a  Window 
 Any window can be temporarily tucked out of sight by minimizing it so that it appears as 
a thumbnail image on the Dock next to the Trash icon. When you want to use a minimized 
window again, just click its thumbnail image on the Dock. 
 To minimize a window, you have the following three options (also see Figure  12-1 ):
 Click the yellow (middle) minimize button that appears in the upper-left 
corner of every window  
 Press Command+M  
 Click the Window menu and choose Minimize (Window ➤ Minimize)  

206
CHAPTER 12: Organizing Windows
 When you minimize a window, it appears as a thumbnail image on the Dock next to the 
Trash icon, as shown in Figure  12-2 . To help you identify the program that the window 
belongs to, the program icon appears in the bottom-right corner of the thumbnail image.  
 Figure 12-1.    The minimize button on a window 
 Figure 12-2.   Minimized window appears on the Dock 
 To open a minimized window, click its thumbnail image on the Dock. 
 Although minimizing windows helps you keep your desktop organized, it can be troublesome 
to minimize windows individually. The more minimized windows that you create, the more 
crowded those minimized windows appear on the Dock. For that reason, OS X offers 
another way that hides windows completely from view.  
 Hiding Windows  
 Because minimizing multiple windows can clutter the Dock, OS X can hide them completely. 
To hide windows, you have two choices:
 Hide all windows belonging to one program  
 Hide all windows except those belonging to one program  
 
 

207
CHAPTER 12: Organizing Windows
 Hiding all windows except those belonging to one program can be useful when you only 
want to work in one program but don’t want to close or minimize windows belonging to 
other programs. 
 To hide windows, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Application menu on the menu bar. The Application menu 
is whatever program you’re currently using, such as Pages, Safari, or 
Excel.  
 2. 
 Do one of the following, as shown in Figure  12-3 :
 a.  Hide (Application name), such as Hide Finder or Hide Pages: 
Hides only the windows belonging to the currently active 
program  
 b.  Hide Others: Hides all windows except those of the currently 
active window  
 Note  Unlike minimizing windows, hiding windows gives you no clue as to the number of 
hidden windows. 
 Figure 12-3.    A typical Application menu 
 You can hide windows from any Application menu. When you want to display any hidden 
windows on the screen again, click any Application menu and choose Show All.  
 

208
CHAPTER 12: Organizing Windows
 Using Mission  Control 
 If you have multiple open windows all over your screen, they may overlap and hide other 
open windows. When an open window is hidden behind another open window, one quick 
way to see all open windows on the screen at once is to use Mission Control. 
 Mission Control displays all open windows (but not hidden or minimized windows) as 
thumbnail images on the screen. This lets you see all your open windows so that you can 
click the one you want, as shown in Figure  12-4 . 
 Figure 12-4.   Displaying multiple open windows in Mission Control 
 The moment you click a thumbnail image of a window in Mission Control, your chosen 
window appears on the screen in normal size so that you can start working in that window. 
 To see how Mission Control works, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open two or more windows on your Mac, preferably using different 
programs, such as the Finder, Safari, and Keynote.  
 2. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 3. 
 Click Applications in the sidebar of the Finder window.  
 

209
CHAPTER 12: Organizing Windows
 4. 
 Double-click the Mission Control icon. Mission Control displays all of 
your open windows as thumbnail images on the screen.  
 5. 
 Click any thumbnail image of an open window. That window 
becomes the currently active window on the screen and appears in 
normal size.  
 Opening the Applications folder and double-clicking the Mission Control icon can be 
cumbersome, so one option is to drag the Mission Control icon onto the Dock. Now you can 
open Mission Control with one click. 
 A second shortcut to opening Mission Control is to use a keystroke shortcut. The default 
keystroke shortcut is Control+Up arrow (try it on your Mac now), but you can define any 
keystroke shortcut you wish. 
 A third shortcut to opening Mission Control with a trackpad is to swipe three fingers 
up on the trackpad. To exit out of Mission Control, you can swipe three fingers down on 
the trackpad. 
 To define a keystroke shortcut for opening Mission Control, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple icon on the menu bar to display a pull-down menu.  
 2. 
 Click System Preferences. A System Preferences window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Mission Control icon. The Mission Control window appears, 
as shown in Figure  12-5 .  
 Note  If you don’t want to click any open window in Mission Control, you can exit out of Mission 
Control by pressing the Esc key on the keyboard or by clicking in a blank space between any 
thumbnail images of windows. 

210
CHAPTER 12: Organizing Windows
 4. 
 Click the Mission Control pop-up menu and choose a different 
keystroke shortcut to run Mission Control.  
 5. 
 Click the red button (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the 
Mission Control window to make it disappear.  
 If you look at the Mission Control window, you can see three additional options for defining 
keystroke shortcuts:
 Application windows (Control+Down arrow)  
 Show Desktop (F11)  
 Show Dashboard (F12)  
 Note   If you’re using a laptop, you’ll need to press the Fn key at the same time you press a 
function key, such as F11 or F12. That’s because laptops assign hardware controls to the function 
keys, such as adjusting screen brightness or audio volume. 
 Figure 12-5.   The Mission Control window lets you customize how Mission Control works 
 

211
CHAPTER 12: Organizing Windows
 The Application windows shortcut (Control+Down arrow) displays the thumbnail images 
of all the windows in the currently active program. You can see which program is currently 
active by looking at the Application menu next to the Apple icon on the menu bar. 
 So if Microsoft Word is the currently active program, you see Word next to the Apple icon on 
the menu bar. Then if you press Control+Down arrow, you’ll only see thumbnail images of all 
currently open (not minimized or hidden) Word documents, as shown in Figure  12-6 . 
 Figure 12-6.   The Application windows keystroke shortcut lets you view only open windows in the currently 
active program 
 The Show Desktop shortcut (F11) temporarily hides all open windows so that you can see 
the desktop. To display all open windows once more, press the Show Desktop shortcut 
keystroke again (such as F11). 
 The Show Dashboard shortcut (F12) displays simple utility programs that appear on the 
screen, such as the clock and the calendar, as shown in Figure  12-7 . 
 

212
CHAPTER 12: Organizing Windows
 Using Multiple  Desktops 
 Perhaps the most useful feature of Mission Control is the ability to display multiple desktops. 
Normally, you only use one desktop. Any windows that you open appear on the one 
desktop, so the more programs you use, the more open windows clutter it. 
 The idea behind multiple desktops is to help you organize related programs. For example, 
you might open your word processor documents in one desktop, your browser and e-mail 
program in a second desktop, and a game in a third desktop. 
 Now, instead of having all open windows cluttering a single desktop, you can organize 
programs in different desktops and switch between desktops. 
 Creating Additional Desktops  
 Each time you turn on your Mac for the first time, it displays a single desktop. To create 
additional desktops, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open Mission Control using any method you like (such as pressing 
Control+Up arrow). Mission Control displays all open windows as 
thumbnail images. A + icon appears in the upper-right corner of the 
screen, as shown in Figure  12-8 .  
 Note  OS X initially has two desktops. One desktop is what you see on your Mac. The second 
desktop is used to display the utility programs of Dashboard (see Figure  12-7 ). 
 Figure 12-7.    The Dashboard displays simple utility programs 
 

213
CHAPTER 12: Organizing Windows
 2. 
 Click the + icon. Mission Control adds a new desktop thumbnail and 
gives it a number, such as Desktop 2, as shown in Figure  12-9 . 
 Figure 12-9.   Clicking the + icon creates a new desktop 
 Figure 12-8.   The plus (+) icon lets you add a new desktop to Mission Control 
 3. 
 Click the newly created desktop thumbnail image, such as Desktop 2. 
Your desktop appears with no open windows.  
 4. 
 Open Mission Control again and then click your first desktop, such 
as Desktop 1. Notice that if you have any open windows on Desktop 1, 
they appear again.  
 Rather than constantly manage multiple open windows on a single desktop, Mission 
Control lets you create multiple desktops. Now you can isolate related windows in separate 
desktops and each desktop won’t appear cluttered with   so many open windows.  
 Switching Between Desktops  
 Once you’ve created two or more desktops, you can switch between them. The following are 
three different ways to switch between desktops:
 Open Mission Control and click the desktop thumbnail image that 
you want to use  
 With a trackpad, swipe three fingers left or right to view each 
additional desktop  
 Press Control+Left arrow or Control+Right arrow to view each 
additional desktop  
 
 

214
CHAPTER 12: Organizing Windows
 Moving Windows Between  Desktops  
 On each desktop, you can open programs and arrange windows any way that you like. 
One limitation is that if you open a program in one desktop, you cannot open that program 
in another desktop. This helps keep windows from the same program isolated in the 
same desktop. 
 If you open a program in one desktop and later want to move it to a different desktop, you can. 
 If you have an open program window on one desktop and you would like to move it to 
another desktop, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open Mission Control using any method you like (such as pressing 
Control+Up arrow). Mission Control displays all open windows as 
thumbnail images.  
 2. 
 Move the pointer over the window that you want to move to another 
desktop.  
 3. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or press one finger on the 
trackpad) and move the pointer over the desktop where you want it 
to appear, as shown in Figure  12-10 . 
 Figure 12-10.   Dragging a window to another desktop 
 4. 
 Release the mouse (or trackpad).  
 5. 
 Click a desktop image at the top of the screen to open that desktop.  
 By dragging and dropping windows from one desktop to another, you can have different 
windows from the same program in separate desktops. For example, you might to open 
two documents in Microsoft Word and place one document window in one desktop and a 
second document window in another desktop.  
 

215
CHAPTER 12: Organizing Windows
 Rearranging Desktops  
 The order that you create desktops is the order that they’ll appear. If you need to switch back 
and forth between two desktops, you might want to place them next to each other so that you 
don’t have to view other desktops when pressing Control+Left arrow or Control+Right arrow. 
 To rearrange desktops, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open Mission Control using any method that you like (such as 
pressing Control+Up arrow). Mission Control displays all open 
windows as thumbnail images.  
 2. 
 Move the pointer over a desktop thumbnail image at the top of the 
screen.  
 3. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or press one finger on the 
trackpad). Move the pointer left or right to rearrange the position of 
all your desktops.  
 4. 
 Release the mouse (or trackpad) when the desktop is in the order 
that you want it.  
 Deleting a  Desktop 
 Once you’ve created two or more desktops, you may eventually want to delete one. If 
you delete a desktop that has open windows in it, they’ll automatically appear in another 
desktop, but you may want to move all windows to a specific desktop yourself. 
 To delete a desktop, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open Mission Control using any method that you like (such as 
pressing Control+Up arrow). Mission Control displays all open 
windows as thumbnail images.  
 2. 
 Hold down the Option key and move the pointer to the top of the 
screen. Thumbnail images of all your desktops appear. Move the 
pointer over the desktop thumbnail that you want to delete. A close 
button (an X in a circle) appears in the upper-left corner of each 
desktop thumbnail, as shown in Figure  12-11 . 
 Figure 12-11.   When holding the Option key down, a close button appears in the upper-left corner of each desktop image  
 

216
CHAPTER 12: Organizing Windows
 3. 
 Click the close button of the desktop that you want to delete. Your 
chosen desktop disappears and any open windows on that desktop 
move to another desktop.  
 Using Split  View 
 Some (but not all) OS X programs support a feature called  split view . The idea behind split 
view is to allow you to place two windows side by side, as shown in Figure  12-12 . 
 Figure 12-13.   Identifying windows that support split view 
 Figure 12-12.   Split view lets you place two windows side by side 
 To identify which program’s windows support split view, hover the pointer over the green 
button in the upper-left corner of the window. If a window does not support split view, you’ll 
see a zoom button (+). If a window does support split view, you’ll see a full-screen button 
(two triangle icons pointing in opposite directions), as shown in Figure  12-13 . 
 
 

217
CHAPTER 12: Organizing Windows
 To open split view, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Move the pointer over the green, full-screen button of a program 
window. (If a zoom button appears, you won’t be able to make that 
window appear in split view.)  
 2. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or press a finger on the trackpad) 
until the window shrinks slightly.  
 3. 
 Release the mouse or trackpad. The window shifts to one side of the 
screen (see Figure  12-12 ). 
 To exit out of split view, press the Esc key on the keyboard.  
 Using Full-Screen  Mode 
 To allow you to focus on a single window without distractions, some (but not all) programs 
support full-screen mode. To identify which program windows support full-screen mode, 
look at the green button in the upper-left corner of each program window. If you see a full-
screen button (see Figure  12-13 ), then that program window supports full-screen mode. 
 Full-screen mode expands a single window to fill the entire screen and even temporarily 
hides the menu bar. 
 To exit out of full-screen mode, move the pointer to the top of the screen until the menu bar 
and window title bar reappear. Then click the green button in the upper-left corner of the 
window again to display the window normally.  
 Summary 
 The ability to open multiple windows lets you multitask and refer to the contents of one 
window while working in another. However, too many windows can clutter the screen and 
prove more confusing than helpful. 
 That’s why OS X offers several ways to help organize and reduce the clutter. You can 
minimize individual windows to temporarily tuck them out of sight on the Dock. You can also 
completely hide windows and make them appear again when you want them. 
 If you have multiple open windows on the screen, you might want to use Mission Control, 
which displays open windows as thumbnail images. By letting you see all open windows at 
once, you can click the one that you want to use. 
 Mission Control also lets you create multiple desktops. By using desktops, you can organize 
each desktop with different windows and switch between desktops. This lets you keep each 
desktop organized for a specific task. 

218
CHAPTER 12: Organizing Windows
 Some, but not all, program windows support full-screen mode and split view. Full screen 
mode expands a window to fill the entire screen to block out distractions and let you focus 
on the contents of one window. Split screen lets you view two windows side by side so that 
you can easily refer to both of them at the same time. 
 With so many different ways to organize windows, you can use the methods that you 
like best to keep yourself from getting distracted and getting overwhelmed by so much 
information displayed on the screen at once. By taking the time to learn different ways to 
organize your program windows, you can find a way that makes you more efficient and 
productive.  

219
 Part III 
 Having Fun 
 The real reason that people buy a computer isn’t simply to do more work, but to have fun. 
Even if you don’t play video games, you can still find ways to have fun with your Macintosh, 
such as viewing and organizing pictures captured with a digital camera. In addition to letting 
you view and modify still images, your Macintosh also lets you watch and edit video. 
 Perhaps the most common trait that people enjoy is listening to music. Whether you listen 
to classical, jazz, country, hip-hop, rock, or rap, you can store, organize, and listen to your 
favorite songs and recording artists by turning your Macintosh into a sophisticated jukebox 
or radio. 
 Or, you may want to read e-books on your Macintosh. Instead of lugging around stacks of 
heavy and cumbersome printed books, you can literally store thousands of e-books on your 
Macintosh. Whenever you want to read a novel or a non-fiction e-book, you can turn your 
Macintosh into an e-book reader. 
 Computers are supposed to be fun to use, so find what you enjoy most—the chances are 
good that you’ll find a way to have fun playing with it on your Macintosh.

 Chapter 13  
 Playing with Photos 
 Taking pictures can be fun. With digital cameras in every smartphone and tablet, it’s easy to 
capture pictures wherever you go without worrying about taking a camera with you. 
 One of the biggest problems with taking pictures is finding a place to store them. If you take 
too many pictures, you’ll eventually run out of room to store any more, so you need  to know 
how to get photos off a smartphone, tablet, or camera and on to a Mac for safekeeping. 
 There are three ways  to   transfer pictures from an external device (such as a smartphone or 
tablet) to a Mac:
 Use the Photos program  
 Use the Image Capture program  
 Use the Finder to copy individual pictures  
 Using the Photos Program 
 Included with every Mac is a  program  called Photos, which can store pictures, organize 
them, and edit them. Best of all, Photos can automatically import pictures off a smartphone 
or tablet to make transferring photos fast, simple, and easy. 
 When you add pictures to the Photos program, it stores them in a special file called the 
Photos Library. No matter how many pictures that you add to Photos, they all get stored in 
this single file. 
 Once you’ve stored pictures in Photos, you can view them in chronological order, or you can 
group related pictures together in albums, as shown in Figure  13-1 . You can also do light 
editing on pictures, such as adjusting the brightness.  

222
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 Finally, you can share pictures with others through e-mail or social networks like Flickr or 
Facebook, or even create projects from your pictures, such as printing a book, greeting 
cards, or a calendar. For many people, Photos is the only program that they need to save, 
modify, and view their pictures. 
 Adding Pictures to Photos 
 To add pictures to the Photos  library  file, you can either connect a cable to an external 
camera (such as a smartphone or tablet) or retrieve pictures stored in a separate folder, such 
as the Pictures folder or a USB flash drive. 
 The Photos program  automatically   loads every time that you connect a camera to your Mac 
through a cable. When the Photo program loads and connects to your camera, it displays 
a list of photos that are stored on your camera but not copied to Photos, as shown in 
Figure  13-2 . 
 Figure 13-1.    The  Photos program can organize pictures in chronological order 
 

223
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 To add all new pictures, click the Import All New Photos button in the upper-right corner. 
 To selectively  add  pictures, click the picture (or pictures) that you want to add and then 
click the Import Selected button. Each time that you click a picture, a check mark appears 
to show that it’s selected. If you click a selected picture a second time, the check mark 
disappears. 
 If you want to  delete   pictures off your smartphone, tablet, or camera after copying them into 
the Photos program, click the “Delete items after import” check box. 
 Viewing Pictures in Photos 
 Once you’ve saved pictures  in the Photos program, you can view them in chronological 
order or by albums. Since most cameras place a date and time stamp on each photo, the 
Photos program can determine the order that you captured your pictures. 
 Note  When the “Open Photos for this device” check box is selected, the Photos program opens 
automatically every time that you connect your camera to your Mac. If you clear this check box, 
then the Photos program will not open automatically when you plug your camera into your Mac. 
 Figure 13-2.   The Photos program identifies photos that appear on a connected camera but not on your Macintosh 
 

224
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 To view pictures in  chronological  order, open the Photos program and click the Photos tab 
(see Figure  13-1 ). Then double-click any picture that you want to view, as shown in Figure  13-3 .  
 Figure 13-3.   Double-clicking a  picture expands it so that you can see more detail 
 Once you’ve selected a picture, you can edit or share it.  
 Editing Pictures in Photos 
 Editing a picture lets  you  fix slightly flawed pictures, such as changing brightness, cropping 
out unwanted parts, or rotating. The following are some of the ways to edit a picture:
 Enhance  : Brightens an image to correct pictures that are too dark  
 Rotate  : Flips a picture on its side  
 Crop  : Lets you select a rectangular portion of the image to keep; the 
rest of it is removed  
 Filters  : Lets you change the appearance of a picture as seen through 
different visual filters  
 Adjust  : Lets you change the color of an image  
 

225
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 Retouch  : Lets you drag the pointer over parts of an image you want to 
remove, such as eliminating blemishes on a person’s face  
 Red- Eye  : Lets you remove the red glow in a person’s eyes that occur 
when a picture is captured using flash  
 Each type of editing tool displays different options for modifying an image in different ways. 
 To edit a picture stored in Photos, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Double-click  the   picture that you want to edit. Your chosen picture 
appears (see Figure  13-3 ).  
 2. 
 Click the Edit button in the upper-right corner. The Edit menu 
 appears  on the right edge of the screen, as shown in Figure  13-4 . 
 Note  The  Red-Eye tool only appears when the Photos program detects red eye in a picture. To 
make the Red-eye tool appear all the time, click the View menu and choose Always Show Red-Eye 
Control (View ➤ Always Show Red-Eye Control). 
 Figure 13-4.    The Edit  menu  displays common editing tools 
 3. 
 Click an editing tool on the right edge of the screen, such as 
 Enhance  or Retouch and modify the image, as shown in Figure  13-5 . 
 

226
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 4. 
 Click the  Done  button in the upper-right corner when you’re done.  
 Figure 13-5.    The Adjust editing  tool displays a variety of ways to modify an image 
 

227
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 Organizing Pictures in Albums 
 Just as you can organize physical  pictures   in albums, you can also organize digital pictures 
in albums. The big difference is that physical photos can only appear in one album at a time. 
With digital albums, you can place the same photo in multiple albums. 
 For example, you might have one album containing pictures only of your pet dog and a 
second album containing pictures only of your son. Yet the same dog picture could  appear 
 in both albums if there’s a picture of your dog with your son. 
 Albums simply give you a way to group related photos together so that you can easily find 
 them  again, as shown in Figure  13-6 . Photos provides several different types of albums:
 Standard albums  : These albums contain any pictures that you want, 
based on your own criteria.  
 Smart albums  : These albums contain pictures based on criteria that you 
specify, such as pictures taken on a certain date or place.

CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 Figure 13-6.   Photos can organize  your pictures in different types of albums 
 Your  Photos   program may not display all of these different album types. For example, if 
you haven’t captured any slow motion or panoramic images, you won’t see a Slow-mo or 
Panoramas album in the Photos program. 
 Out of all these album types,  standard albums are the ones that you can create. The other 
album types occur automatically. 
 Creating Standard Albums 
 You can create as many  standard albums  as you want and fill them with pictures based on 
your own criteria, such as pictures from a certain location or pictures that evoke a certain 
emotion. 
 Once you create a standard album,  you’ll   need to fill that album with pictures that you 
manually place (or remove) in that album. 
 To create a standard album,  follow   these steps:
 1. 
 Click the File menu  and   choose New Album (File ➤ New Album) or 
press Command+N. A Create New Album dialog box appears, as 
shown in Figure  13-7 . 
 Note  If you  select  one or more pictures before choosing to create a new album, those selected 
pictures automatically appear in your new album. 
 

229
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 2. 
 Click in the Album Name text field and type a descriptive name for 
 your  album, such as Vacation Photos or Birthday Party April 2018.  
 3. 
 Click the OK button. Photos creates an empty album.  
 Adding Pictures to a Standard Album 
 Once you’ve created an  album , you can add pictures to it. Adding pictures essentially means 
making a copy of that picture and storing it in an album, so if you ever delete that album (or 
that picture in that album), you’ll still have a copy of that picture stored in the Photos library. 
 To add pictures to a standard album, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Albums tab. A list of available albums appears (see 
Figure  13-6 ). 
 2. 
 Double-click the album that you want to use.  
 3. 
 Click the View menu and choose Show Sidebar (View ➤ Show 
Sidebar). The sidebar appears on the left side of the Photos window, 
listing your current album, as shown in Figure  13-8 . 
 Figure 13-7.   Creating  a new album

CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 4. 
 Click the View menu and choose Photos (View ➤ Photos) or press 
Command+1 to display all the pictures stored in the Photos library.  
 5. 
 Move the pointer over a picture that you want to add to the album. 
Hold down the left mouse button (or press a finger on the trackpad) 
and drag the picture over the album name that appears in the 
sidebar, as shown in Figure  13-9 . 
 Figure 13-8.   The side bar appears on the left side of the Photos window 
 

231
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 6. 
 Release the mouse button (or trackpad) when a white plus sign 
appears inside a green circle. Your chosen picture now appears in 
your album.  
 Removing Pictures from a Standard Album 
 If you added a  picture  to an album and later decide you don’t want it there any more, you 
can always remove it. To remove a picture from a standard album, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Albums tab. A list of available albums appears (see 
Figure  13-6 ). 
 2. 
 Double-click the album that you want to modify. All the pictures 
stored in that album appear.  
 3. 
 Right-click the picture that you want to remove. A pop-up menu 
appears.  
 4. 
 Choose Remove from Album, as shown in Figure  13-10 .

CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 Tagging Pictures 
 Each time that you  capture  a photo with a digital camera, it may tag that file with a generic 
file name along with the date when and the location where it was captured, as shown in 
Figure  13-11 . 
 Figure 13-10.   Removing a picture from an album 
 Note   Removing a picture from an album does not physically delete that picture from your Photos 
library. 
 

233
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 To help you find a particular file, you might want to add additional tags, such as marking 
some pictures as your favorite, typing in a description of that image, or adding identifying 
keywords about the pictures, such as the name of the person in the picture. Tags give you a 
way to find a particular picture quickly without endlessly scrolling through your entire library 
of pictures. 
 To tag a picture, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Right-click a picture that you want to tag. A pop-up menu appears, 
as shown in Figure  13-12 . 
 Figure 13-11.   Captured images often store information about the location and device that captured it 
 

234
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 2. 
 Click Get Info. An Info window appears (see Figure  13-11 ). 
 3. 
 Add a tag, such as one or more of the following:
 a.  Click the Heart icon in the upper-right corner to mark a picture as 
a Favorite.  
 b.  Click in the Add a Title text field to add a title for your picture.  
 c.  Click in the Add a Description text field to add a description.  
 d.  Click in the Add a Keyword text field to add a keyword, such as 
the name of a person in the picture.  
 When typing descriptions or keywords, be consistent. For example, you probably wouldn’t 
want to label one picture as “Hawaii” and a similar picture as “Honolulu” since searching for 
one tag (Hawaii) wouldn’t help you find the other picture. 
 Since you can make up your own descriptions, titles, and keywords, use words that you’ll 
remember. That way you’ll be able to search for all pictures tagged with the same keywords, 
titles, or descriptions.  
 Figure 13-12.   Right-clicking a picture displays a pop-up menu 
 

235
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 Figure 13-13.   Searching lets you find all pictures matching a particular title, description, or keyword 
 Searching with Tags 
 Once you’ve tagged  your  pictures, you can use those tags later to help you find a particular 
image. For example, if you captured a dozen pictures in Paris over the years, then you might 
tag it with the Paris keyword. Now you can easily find all pictures tagged with the Paris 
keyword. 
 To search for a picture using a tag, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click in the Search field in the upper-right corner of the Photos 
window. 
 2. 
 Type part or all of the tag that you want to find. As you type, a list of 
matching pictures appears, as shown in Figure  13-13 . 
 3. 
 Click the picture that you want to view.  
 Creating Smart Albums 
 When you create a standard album, you must add (or remove) pictures to that album 
yourself. A much easier way is to create  smart albums  . 
 A  smart album  automatically adds pictures based on certain criteria, such as all pictures that 
were captured on a certain date, or contained specific people or tags. 
 Smart albums work best if all the pictures stored in your Photos library are tagged. That way 
you won’t risk missing a picture just because it wasn’t tagged. 
 Note  The main difference between a standard album and a smart album is that a smart album 
adds pictures automatically, whereas a standard album forces you to manually add pictures to it. 
 

236
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 Figure 13-15.   Defining criteria for the type of pictures to include in a smart album 
 To create a smart album, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Smart Album (File ➤ New 
Smart Album). A window asks you to set criteria for the pictures to 
add to the smart album, as shown in Figure  13-14 .

CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 4. 
 Click in the far right pop-up menu to define different options for 
the choice that you made in step 3, as shown in Figure  13-16 . 
Depending on which option you chose in step 3, these options offer 
different choices.  
 Figure 13-16.   Defining additional criteria for adding pictures to a smart album 
 5. 
 (Optional) If you want to add more criteria, click the plus sign in a 
circle that appears to the far right, as shown in Figure  13-17 . You can 
add multiple criteria to ensure that the smart album only includes 
pictures that you want.  
 Figure 13-17.   Defining additional criteria for adding pictures to a smart album 
 6. 
 Click the OK button when you’re done defining enough criteria to 
choose which type of pictures automatically appear in your smart album.  
 Once you’ve defined the criteria for a smart album, it continues to use it to add new pictures 
automatically. Just make sure that you remember the criteria you defined for each smart 
album so that you’ll know how to tag new pictures so that they’ll automatically appear in the 
right smart albums.  
 
 

238
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 Exporting a Picture 
 Photos is  handy  for storing pictures but you’ll likely want to share them with others. Photos 
can send a picture directly to e-mail, or as a text message, or to a common social network 
like Facebook or Twitter. 
 Since Photos stores all pictures in its own Photos Library file, you may want to export a 
picture out of Photos to save it as a separate file. That way you can use it in another program. 
 To share a picture, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the picture that you want to share. (Hold down the Shift key and 
click multiple pictures to select more than one to share at a time.)  
 2. 
 Click the Share icon in the upper-right corner of the Photos program 
to display a pop-up menu, as shown in Figure  13-18 . 
 Figure 13-18.   Clicking the Share icon displays a menu offering different ways to share a picture 
 3. 
 Click one of the following choices:
 a.  iCloud Photo Sharing  : Lets you share photos with others through 
an online album  
 b.  Mail  : Lets you send a picture as a file attachment in an e-mail 
message  
 c.  Messages  : Lets you send a picture as a text message  
 

239
CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 d.  AirDrop  : Lets you wirelessly send a picture to a Mac or iOS device  
 e.  Notes  : Lets you store a copy of a picture in the Notes program  
 f. 
 Facebook  : Lets you post a picture on Facebook  
 g.  Flickr  : Lets you post a picture on Flickr  
 If you want to save a picture as a separate file, you need to export that picture. When you 
export a picture out of Photos, you can define the following:
 A file format (JPEG, TIFF, or PNG)  
 A file name  
 Additional information about the file, such as the keywords or 
descriptions used to tag that picture  
 To export a picture out of Photos, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the picture that you want to save as a separate file. (Hold down 
the Shift key and click multiple pictures to select more than one to 
share at a time.)  
 2. 
 Click the File menu, choose Export, and choose Export again 
(File ➤ Export ➤ Export), as shown in Figure  13-19 . A dialog asks for 
a file format and file name, as shown in Figure  13-20 . 
 Figure 13-19.   Exporting a picture from Photos

CHAPTER 13: Playing with Photos
 3. 
 Click in the Photo Kind pop-up menu and choose a file format 
(JPEG, TIFF, or PNG).  
 4. 
 Select (or clear) the Include check boxes, such as Location 
Information.  
 5. 
 Click the File Name pop-up menu and choose how you want to 
name your pictures.  
 6. 
 Click the Export button. A window lets you choose a folder to store 
your exported pictures.  
 7. 
 Click a folder to store your pictures and click the Export button. Your 
chosen pictures now appear as separate files that you can use in other 
programs, such as a desktop publishing program or a website editor.  
 Using the Image Capture Program 
 Photos is  handy for storing and managing your pictures because it automatically asks to 
import pictures every time that you plug an external camera into your Mac. However, if you 
don’t want to use the Photos program or if you want to store pictures as separate files in a 
folder, you can use the Image Capture program instead. 
 Unlike the Photos program, the Image Capture program won’t run automatically when you 
connect a camera to your Mac. You also can’t edit pictures with the Image Capture program 
or share pictures with others by e-mail or social networks like Facebook.

 Summary 
 Almost every smartphone and tablet comes with a built-in camera, which means you can 
easily capture pictures at any time. The trick is getting those pictures off your camera and on 
to your Mac for safekeeping. 
 The two main programs for copying pictures off a camera are the Photos program and the 
Image Capture program. The Image Capture program treats pictures as separate files and 
simply copies them off a camera on to a folder on your Mac. 
 The Photos programs can copy pictures off a camera, and organize, share, and edit them as 
well. Unlike the Image Capture program, the Photos program stores all pictures in a single 
file called the Photos Library. 
 You can use the Photos program and the Image Capture program to copy still pictures 
and video off any camera connected to your Mac. Whenever you have pictures, use either 
Photos or Image Capture to save your pictures on your computer.  
 Figure 13-22.   The Import To pop-up menu lets you define where to save copies of your pictures

 Chapter 14  
 Watching and Editing Video  
 Cameras can capture both still images and video. Once you have video on your Mac, 
you can view, edit, or save it to a DVD if your Mac has a DVD drive (either internal 
or external). 
 Video files may be stored in different types of  file formats  , such as:
 .mpg, .m4v: MPEG-4 format  
 .mpg, .mpeg: MPEG-1 format  
 .mov, .qt: QuickTime format  
 .avi: Audio Video Interleave format (commonly associated with Windows)  
 .wmv: Windows Media Video (commonly associated with Windows)  
 The best video  file formats  for OS X are the  MPEG and  QuickTime  formats. Your Mac may 
be able to recognize other video file formats, but if you are unable to play a video file on your 
Mac, you may need to convert it to the .mpg, .m4v, or .mov formats. 
 Once you get a video in a format that your Mac can recognize, you can then manipulate the 
video in different ways. 
 Note   The Photos program (see Chapter   13  ) can also store and organize video files as well as 
still images. 

244
CHAPTER 14: Watching and Editing Video
 Watching a Video with Quick Look 
 The most common use for any  video   file is to watch it. The simplest and fastest way to 
watch a video is to use the Quick Look feature that lets you view the contents of a file 
without running a program to open that file first. 
 To use the Quick Look feature to watch a video, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the video file that you want to view.  
 3. 
 Do one of the following:
 a.  Press the spacebar  
 b.  Press Command+Y  
 c.  Click the File menu and choose Quick Look (File ➤ Quick Look)  
 d.  Right-click the video file, and when a pop-up menu appears, 
choose Quick Look  
 4. 
 Click the close button (the X) in the upper-left corner of the Quick 
Look window when you’re done watching the video.  
 When you open a video file using Quick Look, the video appears in a window, as shown 
in Figure  14-1 . 

245
CHAPTER 14: Watching and Editing Video
 The Quick Look window displays several controls for viewing a video:
 Pause/Play: Toggles between playing the video and pausing it  
 Mute/Volume: Toggles between muting the volume and increasing it  
 Scrubber Bar: Rewinds or forwards the video  
 If you click the Open with QuickTime Player button in the upper-right corner, you can open 
the video file in the QuickTime Player program. This gives you the option of saving the video 
in a different file format or doing basic editing to trim the length of the video.  
 Figure 14-1.   Quick Look displays a video file in a separate window 
 

246
CHAPTER 14: Watching and Editing Video
 Figure 14-2.   The Photos program can organize pictures in chronological order 
 Watching a Video with the QuickTime Player 
 You can open  the  QuickTime Player within the Quick Look window or by double-clicking the 
QuickTime Player program icon in a Finder window. The QuickTime Player gives you more 
control over watching a video than the Quick Look window; you can adjust the volume, 
export the video in different resolutions, or even strip out the video and retain only the audio. 
 In addition, the QuickTime Player lets you do basic video editing, such as trimming the 
beginning or end of a video. 
 To open and watch a video in the QuickTime Player like the one shown in Figure  14-2 , you 
can use one of the following methods:
 Load the QuickTime Player and then choose File ➤ Open to select the 
video you want to view  
 Right-click the video file that you want to open, and when a pop-up 
menu appears, choose Open With ➤ QuickTime Player  
 Click a video file and open it in the Quick Look window. Then click the 
Open with QuickTime Player button  
 

247
CHAPTER 14: Watching and Editing Video
 Exporting a Video in Different Resolutions 
 If the QuickTime Player program can load and play a  video  , then you can export that video 
as a QuickTime video (.mov) in several different resolutions, as follows (also see Figure  14-3 ):
 1080p: Up to 1920 × 1080 resolution  
 720p: Up to 1280 × 720 resolution  
 480p: Up to 640 × 480 resolution  
 iPad, iPhone, iPod touch & Apple TV: Lets you optimize your file for a 
specific Apple device  
 Audio Only: Strips away the video and only saves the audio portion  
 iTunes: Lets you share a movie on iTunes  
 Figure 14-3.   Exporting a video in different resolutions 
 

248
CHAPTER 14: Watching and Editing Video
 The smaller the device that you choose (such as an iPod touch), the smaller the file size. 
Small file sizes can be viewed on larger devices but the resolution won’t be optimized for 
that larger screen. So if you save a video for an iPod touch, it won’t look as good when 
viewed on an Apple TV or iPad. 
 After you choose a resolution and file size, you can then specify a folder and a file name to 
save your exported video.  
 Trimming Video in the QuickTime Player 
 Trimming a  video  shortens that video clip to get rid of unwanted images at the beginning or 
end of a video. To trim a video, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open a video with the QuickTime Player program.  
 2. 
 Click the Edit menu and choose Trim (Edit ➤ Trim) or press Command+T. 
The QuickTime Player displays clips of your video with a handle at the 
beginning and end of the video, as shown in Figure  14-5 . 
 Figure 14-4.   Defining an optimum file size for different Apple devices 
 If you choose the “iPad, iPhone, iPod touch & Apple TV” option in the Export submenu, 
you’ll see an additional dialog for choosing a size for your file, as shown in Figure  14-4 . 
 

249
CHAPTER 14: Watching and Editing Video
 3. 
 Move the pointer over the handle at the beginning or end of the video 
clip. Notice that the Trim button appears dimmed.  
 4. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or press a finger on the trackpad). 
Drag the mouse (or slide your finger on the trackpad) left or right to 
exclude a portion of the video at the beginning or end.  
 5. 
 Release the left mouse button (or lift your finger off the trackpad). 
The Trim button appears so that you can select it.  
 6. 
 Click the Trim button. The QuickTime Player trims your video.  
 Splitting Video into Clips 
 Trimming shortens a video. Another way to edit a video is to split a  video  into clips. Once 
you’ve split a video into clips, you can rearrange the clips so that images that appeared 
earlier can appear later and vice versa. 
 Note  If you make a mistake trimming a video, choose Edit ➤ Undo or press Command+Z to undo 
any changes you made. 
 Figure 14-5.    Trimming a video

 To split a video into clips, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open a video with the QuickTime Player program.  
 2. 
 Click the View menu and choose Show Clips (View ➤ Show Clips). 
The QuickTime Player displays multiple clips of your video, as shown 
in Figure  14-6 . A red vertical line (called the  playhead ) appears on the 
far left.

 5. 
 Click the Edit menu and choose Split Clip (Edit ➤ Split Clip) or press 
Command+Y. QuickTime Player splits the video into separate clips, 
as shown in Figure  14-7 . You can repeat steps 3 to 5 as often as 
necessary to keep splitting a video into multiple clips.  
 6. 
 Click the Done button when you’re finished splitting your video into 
separate clips.  
 Rearranging Clips 
 Once you’ve split your  video  into at least two separate clips, you can rearrange them in any 
order. To rearrange clips, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Split your video into at least two separate clips.  
 2. 
 Click the clip that you want to move to a new location. QuickTime 
Player highlights your chosen clip.  
 
 

251
CHAPTER 14: Watching and Editing Video
 3. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or press a finger on the trackpad).  
 4. 
 Move the mouse (or slide your finger on the trackpad) left or right to 
rearrange the clip. The existing clips move out of the way to make 
room for the new location of the moved clip.  
 5. 
 (Optional) Click the Edit menu and choose one of the following to 
change the visual orientation of your chosen clip:
 a.  Rotate Left  
 b.  Rotate Right

 6. 
 Click the Done button when you’re finished rearranging clips.  
 Capturing a Video of the Screen 
 If you’ve ever tried to explain  to  someone how to use a Mac, you know how frustrating and 
limited words can be. Since it’s not always possible to peek over someone’s shoulder and 
show them how to use a Mac, you can do the next best thing and record a video of your 
screen instead. 
 When you record a video of your screen, others can see exactly what you click and choose. 
Even better, you can record audio so that you can narrate what you’re doing. 
 To record the actions on your screen, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the QuickTime Player program.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Screen Recording (File ➤ New 
Screen Recording). A Screen Recording window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Options icon to display a pull-down menu, as shown in 
Figure  14-8 . 
 Note  If you open video in another QuickTime Player window, you can copy/cut clips from one 
video and paste them into another video. 
 Note   QuickTime Player can only record audio from your Mac’s built-in microphone. QuickTime 
Player cannot record any audio playing out of your Mac. 

252
CHAPTER 14: Watching and Editing Video
 4. 
 Choose how you want to record audio, such as None or Built-in Microphone.  
 5. 
 Click the red Record button. A message appears letting you know to 
click to record the full screen or part of the screen.

CHAPTER 14: Watching and Editing Video
 Burning a Video to a DVD 
 Most Macs no longer have a built-in DVD  drive  , but you can always connect an external DVD 
drive to any Mac. If you have a DVD drive, you can burn a video to a DVD. 
 Burning a video to a DVD creates a playable DVD. If you copy a video  file to a DVD, then that 
video won’t play in ordinary DVD players; it can only be read by other computers. 
 To burn a video file to a DVD, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Make sure that you have a DVD drive connected to your Mac with a 
blank DVD inside it.  
 2. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.  
 3. 
 Right-click the video file that you want to burn to a DVD. A pop-up 
menu appears, as shown in Figure  14-11 . 
 Figure 14-11.   Right-clicking displays a pop-up menu with the Burn command

 Summary 
 OS X provides basic features for playing, capturing, and editing video. If you need video-
editing features that are more advanced, you can use the iMovie program that comes with 
every Mac. With iMovie, you can add titles, transition, and audio in more ways than the 
QuickTime Player can offer. 
 For simple screen capturing and recording, you can use the QuickTime Player. However, if 
you want to record audio from a microphone and audio playing out of your Mac, you’ll need 
a dedicated video recording program. 
 Likewise, if you have a DVD drive connected to your Mac and you want to burn videos to 
DVDs in different ways, you need to get a dedicated CD/DVD burning program. 
 If you regularly work with video captured from different cameras, you may want to get a 
special video file converter. That way, no matter what file format a video might be stored in, 
you’ll be able to view and edit it. 
 With so many smartphones and tablets available, capturing video is getting even easier than 
before. Capture your memories in video and then store them on your Mac for safekeeping. 
Once stored on your Mac, your video files are always available for viewing, editing, or 
sharing whenever you like.  
 Note   If your Mac has a DVD drive, you can also play DVDs, such as movies, using the DVD Player 
program, which mimics the controls and features of a DVD player.

 Playing Music 
 Listening to music is yet another way that you can enjoy using your Mac. You can listen to 
music stored on a CD (if you have a CD/DVD drive connected to your Mac), music streamed 
over the Internet, or music stored as audio files on your computer. You can listen to music 
while working on your computer, or you can turn your Mac into a stereo and let it play music 
while you do something else. 
 Besides playing music, you can also purchase music online. You can buy your favorite songs 
or albums and play them right away on your Mac. 
 There are three ways to play audio files such as music on a Mac:
 Use Quick Look  
 Use the QuickTime Player  
 Use iTunes  
 Playing Audio with Quick Look 
 Quick Look is meant to let you  peek at the contents of any file without the hassle of 
opening a program to do it. With Quick Look, you can play a portion of an audio file or the 
entire file if you wish. 
 Quick Look can open and play a variety of audio file formats, including .mp3, .wav, .aac, 
.mov, and .qt. If you have an audio file stored in a different file format, Quick Look may not 
be able to play it. 
 To listen to an audio file with Quick Look, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the dock. A Finder window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the audio file that you want to hear.  

256
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 3. 
 Do one of the following to open the Quick Look window (also see 
Figure  15-1 ):
 a.  Press the spacebar.  
 b.  Press Command+Y.  
 c.  Click the File menu and choose Quick Look (File ➤ Quick Look).  
 d.  Right-click the video file, and when a pop-up menu appears, 
choose Quick Look.  
 Figure 15-1.    The Quick Look window playing an audio file 
 4. 
 Click the close button (the X) in the upper-left corner of the Quick 
Look window when you’re done listening to the audio file.  
 Playing Audio with the QuickTime Player 
 One drawback of  using  Quick Look to play an audio file is that you can’t play an audio file in 
Quick Look and use the Finder at the same time. If you want to listen to an audio file while 
using the Finder, you have to use the QuickTime Player. 
 To play an audio file with the QuickTime Player, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start the QuickTime Player.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose Open File (File ➤ Open File). Select 
the audio file that you want to play. A QuickTime Player window 
appears, as shown in Figure  15-2 . 
 

257
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 3. 
 Click the close button (the X) in the upper-left corner of the QuickTime 
Player window when you’re done listening to the audio file.  
 Playing an Audio File in iTunes 
 The biggest limitation of  playing  audio files in Quick Look or the QuickTime Player is that 
you can only play one audio file at a time. If you want to hear multiple audio files one after 
another, you can play audio files in iTunes instead. 
 With iTunes, you can import audio files either by buying them online or by importing them 
off your hard disk or flash drive. You can also create playlists to play related audio files one 
after another. 
 Of course, before you can play any audio files in iTunes, you must import them into iTunes first.  
 Importing Audio Files into iTunes 
 Although there are many varieties of audio file  formats  , iTunes can only play the more 
popular audio file formats, such as:
 .aac: The file format used when you purchase music within iTunes  
 .aiff and .wav: Two file formats that provide the best audio quality but at 
the expense of larger file sizes  
 Apple Lossless Encoder: Apple’s format that is similar to AIFF but takes 
up much less space  
 .mp3: The most popular file format for storing audio files  
 Note   Unlike Quick Look, which can only play one audio file at a time, you can open as many audio 
files as you wish in the QuickTime Player. 
 Note   If you have an audio file stored in a different format, you may have to convert it to another 
file format before importing it into iTunes. 
 Figure 15-2.   Playing an audio file in the QuickTime Player 
 

258
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 To import a compatible audio file into iTunes, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the iTunes program.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose Add to Library (File ➤ Add to 
Library). A dialog appears.  
 3. 
 Click the audio file that you want to add to your iTunes library. (You 
can hold down the Command key to select more than one file.) If you 
select a folder, you will add all audio files stored in that folder.  
 4. 
 Click the Open button. iTunes adds your selected audio file in the 
Music library and the Recently Added playlist.  
 Importing Audio CDs into iTunes 
 If your Mac has a DVD drive, you  can  have iTunes automatically ask you to import audio 
tracks off a CD every time that you insert it into your DVD drive. This makes it convenient 
to save audio CD tracks as digital files in iTunes so that you can play them again without 
inserting the CD back into your Mac again. 
 To make iTunes automatically ask if you want to import audio files every time you insert an 
audio CD into a DVD drive, follow these steps (if your Mac has a DVD drive connected to it):
 1. 
 Click the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of the screen to display 
a pull-down menu.  
 2. 
 Choose System Preferences. A System Preferences window 
appears.  
 3. 
 Click the CDs & DVDs icon. The CDs & DVDs window appears, as 
shown in Figure  15-3 . 
 Figure 15-3.   You can make iTunes load automatically every time you insert an audio CD into your DVD drive 
 

259
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 4. 
 Click the “When you insert a music CD” pop-up menu and choose 
Open iTunes. From now on, iTunes automatically loads each time 
that you insert a music CD into your DVD drive. To make iTunes 
automatically import audio tracks, you need to define how iTunes 
behaves when you insert an audio CD into your DVD drive.  
 5. 
 Open iTunes, click the iTunes menu, and choose Preferences 
(iTunes ➤ Preferences). A General Preferences window appears.  
 6. 
 Click the General tab and click the “When a CD is inserted” pop-up 
menu. Choose Ask to Import CD, as shown in Figure  15-4 . 
 Figure 15-4.   Modifying how iTunes behaves when you insert an audio CD into a DVD drive

CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 8. 
 Insert an audio CD into the DVD drive of your Mac. iTunes asks if you 
want to import the audio tracks into iTunes, as shown in Figure  15-5 . 
 Figure 15-5.   Inserting a music CD can automatically import audio tracks into iTunes 
 9. 
 Click the Yes button to import all audio tracks from the CD. Click the 
No button if you don’t want to import any audio tracks from the CD.  
 Playing Audio in iTunes 
 Once you have audio files stored in iTunes, you can play them individually or in groups, such 
as all songs from a single album. In addition, you can play an audio file once or have it loop 
multiple times. This is particularly handy for a long audio track, such as a relaxing meditation 
audio file, that you want to keep playing until you finally turn it off. 
 Playing a Single Audio Track 
 If you just want to play  a  single audio track stored in your iTunes library, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open iTunes.  
 

261
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 2. 
 Click the View menu and choose Music. Click Music in the left pane 
under the Library category, or press Command+1. A list of all audio 
tracks stored in iTunes appears, as shown in Figure  15-6 .

 3. 
 Click an audio track that you want to play.  
 4. 
 Click the Controls menu and choose Play (Controls ➤ Play). Press 
the spacebar or click the Play button in the upper-left corner of the 
iTunes window. Your chosen audio track starts playing.  
 While an audio track is playing, you’ll see controls at the top of the iTunes window, as shown 
in Figure  15-7 . The following includes ways to control an audio track:
 Previous: Plays the previous audio track (if any).  
 Play/Pause: Toggles between playing and pausing an audio track.  
 Next: Plays the next audio track (if any).  
 Scrubber: Shows the current position of the audio track and lets you 
drag a slider to move the audio track to a specific position.  
 

262
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 If you’re just playing a single audio track, the Previous button starts playing the audio track 
from the beginning and the Next button stops playing the audio track.  
 Playing Multiple Audio Tracks 
 Most likely, you won’t want to load iTunes just to play a single audio track. Instead, you’re 
more likely to  play  multiple audio tracks. To play multiple audio tracks, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open iTunes.  
 2. 
 Click the check box to the left of each audio track that you want to 
play, as shown in Figure  15-8 . 
 Figure 15-7.   Controls for playing an audio track in iTunes 
 Figure 15-8.   Selecting multiple audio tracks 
 3. 
 Click the Controls menu and choose Play (Controls ➤ Play). Press 
the spacebar or click the Play button in the upper-left corner of the 
iTunes window. Your chosen audio tracks start playing.  
 Note  If you click the Controls menu and choose Shuffle and On (Controls ➤ Shuffle ➤ On), you 
can play your selected audio tracks in random order. 
 
 

263
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 Making Playlists 
 Many people have  favorite   songs that they want to hear together, such as all songs from 
a particular album or similar types of songs, such as love songs or songs you just like the 
best. When you want to play groups of related songs, you can create a playlist. 
 A playlist defines a group of songs that you can play sequentially or randomly. Instead of 
taking time to select the audio tracks you want to hear, you can just select the playlist that 
you want to hear. 
 The following are three ways to create a playlist:
 Create a playlist and then choose audio tracks to store in that playlist.  
 Select multiple audio tracks and create a playlist from those selected 
audio tracks.  
 Create a smart playlist where iTunes automatically adds new audio 
tracks based on different criteria.  
 Creating a Playlist 
 If you want to create a playlist  and  then choose audio tracks to store in that playlist 
afterward, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open iTunes.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu, choose New, and then choose Playlist 
(File ➤ New ➤ Playlist), or press Command+N. iTunes displays 
an empty playlist window with a generic name (Playlist) selected 
so that you can type a more descriptive name for your playlist, as 
shown in Figure  15-9 .  

264
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 3. 
 Type a descriptive name for your playlist and press Return.  
 4. 
 Click the Edit Playlist button. iTunes displays a list of audio tracks 
currently stored in iTunes that you can drag into the playlist pane on 
the right side of the iTunes window, as shown in Figure  15-10 . 
 Figure 15-9.    An empty playlist in iTunes 
 

265
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 5. 
 Click an album that contains the audio tracks you want to add to 
your playlist. A list of audio tracks in that album appears.  
 6. 
 Move the pointer over an audio track that you want to add to your 
playlist, hold down the left mouse button (or press a finger on the 
trackpad), and drag the mouse (or slide your finger on the trackpad) so 
drag the audio track over the playlist box, as shown in Figure  15-11 .  
 Figure 15-10.    Adding audio tracks to a playlist 
 

266
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 7. 
 Release the left mouse button (or lift your finger off the trackpad) 
when the audio track appears over the playlist box. iTunes adds your 
audio track to the playlist. Repeat steps 5 to 7 for each additional 
audio track that you want to add to the playlist.  
 8. 
 (Optional) You can drag and drop audio tracks up or down to 
rearrange their order.  
 9. 
 Click the Done button when you’re finished adding audio tracks to 
your playlist.  
 Creating a Playlist from a Selection of Audio Tracks 
 Creating an empty playlist and then filling it  with audio tracks  is fine, but it’s often faster to 
select multiple audio tracks and then add those selected audio tracks to a playlist right away. 
 Then you can add new audio tracks later if you wish. Selecting audio tracks first is especially 
useful when grouping audio tracks from the same album together. To select audio tracks and 
then create a playlist, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open iTunes.  
 2. 
 Click the View menu and choose Music (View ➤ Music), or press 
Command+1 to view all audio tracks stored in your iTunes library.  
 Figure 15-11.   Dragging and dropping an audio track to add it to a playlist 
 

267
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 3. 
 Hold down the Command key and click each audio track that you 
want to add to your playlist.  
 4. 
 Click the File menu, choose New, and then choose Playlist from 
Selection (File ➤ New ➤ Playlist from Selection). iTunes creates a 
playlist with your chosen audio tracks.  
 Creating a Smart Playlist 
 The biggest problem with  creating  a playlist is that it only contains the audio tracks that you 
specifically add. If you add new audio tracks to your iTunes library, none of those new audio 
tracks will appear in your playlists until you specifically add them. 
 To overcome this limitation, iTunes offers  smart playlists . A smart playlist lets you define 
criteria for which audio tracks to include, such as certain recording artist names, year 
released, or length. 
 Each time you add new audio tracks to your iTunes library, iTunes checks to see if any of 
these new audio tracks match the criteria defined by your smart playlist. If so, then it adds 
those audio tracks to your playlist automatically. 
 iTunes already has several smart playlists, such as Recently Added and Recently Played. 
Because smart playlists can add (or remove) audio tracks automatically, they can help you 
group related audio tracks with no extra effort on your part. 
 For smart playlists to work, your audio tracks must contain certain information, such as 
the genre, album, recording artist name, or song name. When you import audio tracks off a 
music CD, this information will already be recorded with each file. If you import audio files 
from another source, you need to tag that audio file with descriptive information, such as the 
recording artist name and other details that can help identify that audio file for your smart 
playlists. 
 If you want to add (or edit) an audio track to give it more descriptive information, follow 
these steps:
 1. 
 Open iTunes.  
 2. 
 Click the audio track that you want to tag with additional information.  
 3. 
 Click the File menu and choose Get Info (File ➤ Get Info), or press 
Command+I to view all audio tracks stored in your iTunes library. 
A window displays tags for your chosen audio track, as shown in 
Figure  15-12 . 

268
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 4. 
 Edit any information about your chosen audio track and click the OK 
button when you’re done.  
 Once you’ve made sure that all of your audio tracks have descriptive information, you can 
then use that information to create a smart playlist. When creating a smart playlist, you can 
choose several options:
 Limit to: Lets you set a maximum limit to your smart playlist, such as the 
number of audio tracks it can contain, the time length of all audio tracks, 
or the file size of all audio tracks.  
 Figure 15-12.   Displaying information about an audio track 
 

269
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 Match only checked items: Only selects audio tracks that are checked 
(in check box) in your Music library.  
 Live updating: Constantly adds or removes audio tracks from your smart 
playlist as you add new audio tracks to your iTunes library.  
 To create a smart playlist, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open iTunes.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu, choose New, and then choose Smart Playlist 
(File ➤ New ➤ Smart Playlist). A Smart Playlist window appears, as 
shown in Figure  15-13 .

 (Optional) Click the plus sign (+) if you want to create additional rules 
and then repeat steps 3 to 5.  
 7. 
 Select any additional options, such as “Live updating” or “Match only 
checked items”.  
 8. 
 Click the OK button. Your smart playlist appears in the left pane of 
the iTunes window.  
 Note  iTunes comes with several smart playlists already defined, such as Recently Added, Recently 
Played, and Genius. The Genius smart playlist tries to include similar songs in your iTunes library 
along with suggesting new songs that you might enjoy. 
 Figure 15-14.   Choosing criteria to define an audio track for a smart playlist 
 

271
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 Editing a Playlist 
 After you’ve created a playlist,  you can always edit it at any time. For example, you might 
want to edit a smart playlist if it’s choosing audio tracks you don’t want. To edit a playlist, 
follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open iTunes.  
 2. 
 In the left pane of the iTunes window, click the playlist that you want to edit.  
 3. 
 Click the Edit Playlist button in the upper-right corner of the iTunes 
window. If you’re editing a smart playlist, you can define or delete rules 
for choosing which audio tracks to add automatically. If you’re editing 
a regular playlist, you can add or remove audio tracks manually.  
 Listening to a Playlist 
 Playlists are handy when  you want to play certain types of audio tracks for long periods of 
time without any additional effort on your part. To listen to a playlist, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open iTunes.  
 2. 
 In the left pane of the iTunes window, click the playlist that you want 
to hear. Your chosen playlist appears in the right pane of the iTunes 
window.  
 3. 
 Click the first audio track in the playlist that you want to hear. (It doesn’t 
necessarily have to be the first audio track at the top of your playlist.)  
 4. 
 (Optional) Click the Controls menu, choose Shuffle, and then choose 
On (Controls ➤ Shuffle ➤ On). Or, click the Shuffle icon (it looks like 
two crisscrossing arrows, as shown in Figure  15-15 ).

CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 Deleting a Playlist 
 You can delete  a  playlist at any time. When you delete a playlist, you simply remove the list 
of audio tracks but you do not delete any of the audio tracks listed in the playlist. 
 To delete a playlist, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open iTunes.  
 2. 
 In the left pane of the iTunes window, click the playlist that you want 
to delete.  
 3.

if you want to delete your chosen playlist.  
 4. 
 Click the Delete button.  
 Listening to the Radio 
 Besides using  iTunes to listen  to your own music, you can also use iTunes to listen to the 
radio. Many radio stations around the world offer music, news, and information in multiple 
languages so that you can choose what you like. 
 There are two ways to listen to the radio in iTunes: Internet radio or Apple Music. 
 If you choose to listen to Internet radio, it will be free but finding a station can be difficult and 
the reliability of the broadcast may be uneven. 
 If you choose to listen to Apple Music, you can only listen to a handful of free stations. To 
hear other radio stations, you’ll need to subscribe to Apple Music.  
 Listening to Internet Radio 
 Internet radio gives you the  widest   selection of available stations, but finding a station to 
listen to can be challenging. To listen to an Internet radio station, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open iTunes.  
 2. 
 Click the View menu, choose More, and then choose Internet Radio 
(or press Command+9). A list of Internet radio station categories 
appears, as shown in Figure  15-17 .  

274
CHAPTER 15: Playing Music

 Listening to Apple Music Radio 
 Apple Music is a subscription  that   lets you stream audio. If you want to listen to all possible 
stations on Apple Music, you’ll need to buy a subscription. However, there are a handful of 
free radio stations available on Apple Music. 
 To listen to the radio through Apple Music, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open iTunes.  
 2. 
 Click the View menu and choose Music (or press Command+1).

CHAPTER 15: Playing Music
 Summary 
 You can play audio files in Quick Look, in the QuickTime Player, or in iTunes. For listening to 
a single audio file, Quick Look is the fastest and easiest method. For converting an audio file 
to make the file smaller, use the QuickTime Player. 
 For playing multiple audio files, use iTunes. With iTunes, you can create a playlist of multiple 
audio tracks, such as all songs from the same album, or all songs from a specific genre, 
such as country or jazz. 
 iTunes can create smart playlists that can automatically organize audio tracks based on 
criteria that you define, such as artist or genre. A playlist can play audio tracks sequentially 
or in random order. In addition, you can choose to repetitively play one or more audio tracks 
so you’ll always have something to listen to. 
 Think of iTunes as your digital jukebox. You can listen to music or radio stations, so you’ll 
never need to use a separate radio ever again.

 Reading e-Books 
 If you wanted to read a book in the old days, you had to buy a paper copy and lug it around 
with you wherever you went. If you wanted to read two or more books, you had to carry two 
or more books. That meant carrying around a lot of bulk and weight just on the off chance 
you would actually have time to do any reading. 
 Nowadays, you can load and carry thousands of books of all kinds as e-books. An e-book 
takes up a minimal amount of space and you can read it on your Mac whenever you want. If 
you have a laptop, you can read e-books while traveling. 
 The following are the most common e-book  file formats  :
 PDF  
 ePub  
 iBook 
 PDF (Portable Document Format) files essentially display static text and graphics that others 
can read but cannot modify. 
 ePub files are considered the standard for e-books and can be read by most e-book 
readers, such as the Kindle, Nook, and Kobo. 
 iBook is Apple’s e-book file format that can only be read using the iBooks app on a Mac, 
iPhone, or iPad. You can download e-books, stored in the iBook format, by opening the 
iBooks program, clicking the Store menu, and choosing Store Home (Store ➤ Store Home). 
Although some e-books on the iBookstore are free, most cost money. 
 Reading an e-Book in a PDF 
 There are three ways to read a PDF file:
 Quick Look  
 Preview  
 iBook

The Preview program loads your chosen PDF file.  
 Note  You can also start the Preview program and then choose File ➤ Open to open the PDF file 
that you want to read in the Preview program. 

281
CHAPTER 16: Reading e-Books
 Once you open a PDF file in the Preview program, you can modify how the pages look, how 
to navigate around, and even how to modify the file to add comments or your own signature, 
which is handy for filling out legal documents. 
 Note   Adobe gives away a free PDF reader program called Adobe Reader, which is the main 
program for opening PDF files on Windows and Linux PCs. You can download and install Adobe 
Reader on your Mac if you wish, but it’s usually easier just to use the Preview program to open PDF 
files on a Mac.

CHAPTER 16: Reading e-Books
 Viewing PDF Files 
 The  Preview program gives   you several ways to view PDF files, depending on your personal 
preference.
 Zoom: Magnifies or shrinks text on the screen  
 Scroll: Defines how the Preview program displays pages on the screen  
 Navigation: Provides different ways to jump to different parts of a PDF file  
 Markup: Provides tools for adding comments or notes to a PDF file  
 To shrink or enlarge text in a PDF file within the Preview program, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open a PDF file within the Preview program.  
 2. 
 Click the View menu and choose Zoom In/Zoom Out (Command+ to 
zoom in, Command– to zoom out). If you have a trackpad, you can 
also pinch two fingers to zoom in and out.  
 Changing How to Scroll Pages 
 There are three options  for   scrolling through a PDF file:
 Continuous Scroll: Smoothly and continuously scrolls through the pages 
of the file  
 Single Page: Discretely scrolls through the pages so that you can easily 
see where each page begins and ends  
 Two Pages: Displays two pages side by side like an open book  
 To change how the Preview program scrolls through a PDF file, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open a PDF file within the Preview program.  
 2. 
 Click the View menu and choose one of the following:
 a.  Continuous Scroll (or press Command+1)  
 b.  Single Page (or press Command+2)  
 c.  Two Pages (or press Command+3)  
 You can also view a PDF file as a slideshow or in full screen. Both options display the pages 
to fill the entire screen. As a slideshow, Back, Forward, Play/Pause, and Close buttons 
appear at the bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure  16-3 . 
 Note  If you click the View menu and choose Actual Size (View ➤ Actual Size), you can quickly 
return a page to its original magnification. 

283
CHAPTER 16: Reading e-Books
 The Play/Pause button toggles between automatically going to the next page and pausing. 
The Back button returns to the previous page. The Forward button jumps to the next page. 
The Close button exits out of the Slideshow view. 
 Full Screen mode fills the contents of the PDF file on the screen but lets you manually 
advance or reverse the pages by pressing the left or right arrow keys. 
 To switch to Slideshow or Full Screen mode, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open a PDF file within the Preview program.  
 2. 
 Click the View menu and choose one of the following:
 a.  Slideshow  
 b.  Enter Full Screen  
 3. 
 To exit out of Slideshow mode, click the Close button 
(see Figure  16-3 ). To exit out of Full Screen mode, press the 
Esc key on the keyboard.  
 Slideshow mode is best for turning a PDF file into a presentation. Full Screen mode is best 
for viewing the pages of a PDF file without the distraction of other windows on the screen.  
 Navigating Through a PDF File 
 If a PDF file contains multiple  pages , you may find it difficult to continuously scroll up or 
down through the entire PDF file. To make navigation easier through a large PDF file, the 
Preview program offers two features:
 Thumbnails  : Displays shrunken images of each page in the left pane of 
the Preview window  
 Contact Sheet  : Displays miniature images of each page across the 
entire screen  
 With thumbnails, you can scroll up or down the thumbnail list. When you find the page that 
you want to read, click it to view that page, as shown in Figure  16-4 . 
 Figure 16-3.   The Back, Forward, and Play/Pause buttons appear in Slideshow view 
 

284
CHAPTER 16: Reading e-Books
 A  contact sheet  lets you view several PDF pages as tiny thumbnail images that fill the 
screen. Click the page that you want to view, as shown in Figure  16-5 .

286
CHAPTER 16: Reading e-Books
 Using Bookmarks 
 You mark your place  in  a printed book by inserting a bookmark between two pages. If you’re 
reading a PDF file, you can place a bookmark a page to quickly jump to it later. More than 
one page can be bookmarked. 
 You can do three things with bookmarks:
 Place a bookmark  
 Jump to a bookmarked page  
 Delete a bookmark when it’s no longer needed  
 To place a bookmark, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open a PDF file within the Preview program.  
 2. 
 Navigate to the page that you want to place a bookmark.  
 3. 
 Click the Tools menu and choose Add Bookmark (Tools ➤ Add 
Bookmark) or press Command+D. A red bookmark appears in the 
upper-right corner of the page.  
 4. 
 Repeat steps 2 and 3 as often as you wish to place multiple 
bookmarks throughout a PDF file.  
 Once you’ve placed one or more bookmarks in a PDF file, you can jump to a specific page 
that you have bookmarked by following these steps:
 1. 
 Using the Preview program, open a PDF file that contains 
bookmarks.  
 2. 
 Click the View menu and choose Bookmarks (View ➤ Bookmarks). 
The list of bookmarks appears in the left pane, as shown in 
Figure  16-6 .

to delete. A pop-up menu displays the Delete command.  
 4. 
 Click Delete.  
 Reading PDF, ePub, and iBook Files 
 The Preview program can only let you read PDF files. If you want to read ePub or iBook files, 
you’ll have to use the iBooks program. iBooks can also let you read PDF files too so that you 
can use iBooks for all of your e-book reading needs. 
 Note  When you delete a bookmark, you don’t physically delete any pages in the PDF file. 
 Figure 16-6.   The bookmark pane appears in the left side of the Preview window 
 

288
CHAPTER 16: Reading e-Books
 To read PDF, ePub, or iBook files, you must first load them into the iBooks program. To store 
an e-book file in iBooks, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the iBooks program.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose Add to Library (File ➤ Add to 
Library). A dialog appears.  
 3. 
 Click the e-book file that you want to add to iBooks and click the 
Add button.  
 Finding e-Books in iBooks 
 Once you’ve loaded e-book files  into  iBooks, the next problem is finding them again. When 
you have a regular bookshelf holding printed books, you must browse through all of your 
books until you find the one you want. With iBooks, you can browse through your book 
collection or search by author, category, or title. 
 iBooks offers several categories to help sort and organize your e-books:
 All Books: Displays the cover art of all e-books in iBooks  
 Collections: Organizes e-books into groups, such as PDF files or 
science fiction e-books  
 Authors: Displays a list of author names in the left pane of the iBooks window  
 Categories: Displays a list of book genre categories in the left pane of 
the iBooks window  
 List: Lists the titles of all e-books in iBooks  
 To view the different categories in iBooks, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the iBooks program.  
 2. 
 Click a category near the top of the iBooks window, such as Authors 
or List, as shown in Figure  16-7 .  

289
CHAPTER 16: Reading e-Books
 3. 
 Click the e-book that you want to read.  
 Making e-Book Collections 
 iBooks provides a  collection  for PDF files and another for ePub and iBook files. However, 
you might want to create collections to organize your e-books in any way that you wish, 
such as your favorites. 
 To create your own e-book collection in iBook, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the iBooks program.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Collection (File ➤ New 
Collection), or press Command+N. iBooks creates a new collection 
in the left pane, as shown in Figure  16-8 .

 Figure 16-9.   Deleting a collection in iBooks 
 5. 
 Click the Delete Collection Only button (or click the Delete Contents 
button if you also want to delete all the e-books inside it).  
 Reading e-Books in iBooks 
 Once you’ve saved an e-book inside the iBooks program, you can read them. Depending on 
the type of e-book you want to read (PDF, ePub, or iBooks file), you have different options 
for reading the e-book. 
 When you choose to read a PDF file in iBooks, the iBooks program opens the PDF file using 
the Preview program, which was explained earlier in this chapter. 
 When you open an ePub or iBook file in iBooks, you can scroll through the pages by 
pressing the left/right arrow keys or swiping left/right across your mouse or trackpad. To 
make it easy to read an e-book, you can navigate to particular pages by using the table of 
contents or bookmarks. 
 Viewing a Table of Contents 
 Almost all ePub and  iBooks files   offer a table of contents. By opening it, you not only see 
the number of sections that the e-book contains, but you can also click a chapter name or 
number to immediately jump to it. 
 To use the table of contents in an ePub or iBooks file, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the iBooks program.  
 2. 
 Open the ePub or iBooks file that you want to read.  
 3. 
 Click the Table of Contents icon (three horizontal lines that appear in 
the upper-left corner of the iBooks window), as shown in Figure  16-10 .  
 

292
CHAPTER 16: Reading e-Books
 4. 
 Click a chapter name or number to jump to it in the e-book.  
 Using Bookmarks 
 Bookmarks also aid you  in reading ePub and iBook files. You can place as many bookmarks 
as you wish and remove them at any time. To place a bookmark, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the iBooks program.  
 2. 
 Open the ePub or iBooks file that you want to read.  
 3. 
 Open the page that you want to place a bookmark.  
 4. 
 Click the Edit menu and choose Add Bookmark (Edit ➤ Add 
Bookmark) or press Command+D. iBooks places a red bookmark in 
the upper-right corner of the page.  
 Figure 16-10.   Viewing the Table of Contents in an ePub or iBooks file 
 

293
CHAPTER 16: Reading e-Books
 4. 
 Click the bookmark that you want to view. iBooks jumps to that 
bookmarked page.  
 You can remove a bookmark when you no longer need it in one three ways. The first step is 
to go to the page with the bookmark, and then do one of the following:
 Click the Edit menu and choose Remove Bookmark (Edit ➤ Remove 
Bookmark)  
 Press Command+D  
 Click the red bookmark icon in the upper-right corner of the iBooks 
window 
 Figure 16-11.   The View Bookmarks icon lists all bookmarks in an e-book

 2. 
 Open the ePub or iBooks file that you want to read.  
 3. 
 Click the View Bookmarks icon that appears in the upper-right corner 
of the iBooks window, as shown in Figure  16-11 . A list of bookmarks 
appears.  
 

294
CHAPTER 16: Reading e-Books
 Deleting e-Books 
 Each time that you add  another  e-book to iBooks, it takes up space. Eventually, you may 
want to remove an e-book from your iBooks library. When you delete an e-book, you’re 
physically removing it from your Mac but retaining a copy in iCloud. You can always reinstall 
it back into iBooks later. 
 To delete an e-book from iBooks, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the iBooks program.  
 2. 
 Click the e-book you want to remove from iBooks.  
 3. 
 Click the Edit menu and choose Delete (Edit ➤ Delete), or right-click 
an e-book and choose Delete. A message asks if you want to delete 
the e-book and retain a copy on iCloud, as shown in Figure  16-12 . 
 Figure 16-12.   Deleting an e-book 
 4. 
 Click the Delete Copy button.  
 Summary 
 Since a single e-book takes up so little space, you can store many e-books on your Mac so 
that you’ll always have something to read. An e-book may be stored in a PDF, ePub, or 
iBook file. If you have a PDF file, you can read it using the Preview program. If you have an 
ePub or iBook file, you can read it in the iBooks program. 
 Note   As an alternative to using the iBooks program to read ePub files, you can also download 
Amazon’s free Kindle program or Barnes & Noble’s free Nook program. Both programs can open 
and read ePub files while also letting you shop for more e-books through the Kindle or Nook 
bookstore. 
 

295
CHAPTER 16: Reading e-Books
 Two common ways to navigate through any e-book is through the table of contents and 
bookmarks. Not all e-book files (especially PDF files) contain a table of contents but by 
viewing a table of contents, you can click a chapter name or number to jump to it. 
 Another way to navigate through an e-book is through bookmarks. By placing a bookmark, 
you can save your place or mark a page that you want to reference later. You can view a list 
of your bookmarks and jump to that page later. 
 Quick Look is handy for viewing PDF files, but if you want to read long PDF files, you 
should use the Preview program. For reading ePub or iBooks files, you’ll need to use the 
iBooks program.

 Part IV 
 Getting on the Internet 
 Back in the old days, every computer was isolated from everyone else. Fortunately, those 
primitive dark ages of computing are over because now almost everyone’s computer can 
connect with anyone else in the world through the magic of the Internet. 
 In this part of the book, you’ll learn how to connect your Macintosh to the Internet. 
Once you’re connected to the Internet, you can send and receive e-mail to and from people 
all over the world, explore the world by visiting web sites, chat with your friends and family 
members through text messages, and see and talk to others using video and audio. 
 Perhaps the most important advantage of the Internet isn’t communicating with other 
people, but in protecting your data through the magic of iCloud. With iCloud, you can back 
up your data to the Internet and retrieve it from any device, such as an iPhone or iPad. 
 The Internet can be the gateway to making your Macintosh even more fun and productive 
than ever before.

 Chapter 17  
 Browsing the Internet  
 Back in the old days, you had to read a newspaper or a magazine, listen to the radio, or 
watch TV to get the latest news. Today, you can get the latest news, often within minutes of 
it happening, right on your Mac. 
 The secret to accessing information all over the world lies with the Internet. By connecting 
to the Internet, you can access a wealth of information that rivals anything your library 
could offer. 
 To access the Internet, you need to use a special program called a   browser . OS X comes 
with a browser called Safari, which lets you browse web sites on the Internet. 
 Connecting to the Internet 
 In addition to a browser such  as  Safari, you also need an Internet connection. Two ways to 
connect to the Internet are through an  Ethernet cable  that physically plugs into your Mac 
(MacBook models require a special adapter because they don’t have an Ethernet port) or 
through Wi-Fi, which doesn’t require any wires at all. 
 An Ethernet connection is the most secure and reliable way to connect to the Internet, but is 
mostly useful only for desktop computers that don’t need to be moved. 
 Wi-Fi connections  are less secure and reliable than Ethernet, but far simpler to use, 
especially for laptops that may not have an Ethernet port. Wi-Fi is often available at public 
places such libraries, coffee shops, or airport terminals. 
 Note   Safari is the default browser for OS X but you can always install and use another browser, 
such as Chrome or Firefox, since all browsers work in similar ways.

General window to make it go away.  
 Figure 17-4.   The General window lets you define a default browser 
 

304
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 Visiting Web Sites 
 The main purpose of a  browser  , such as Safari, is to let you view web sites anywhere on the 
Internet. Two common ways to find a web site is to enter the web site address (such as 
   www.apple.com  ) or type a search query such as looking for all web sites that contain 
information about “Apple computers”. 
 In general, searching for a web site is easier because you just type one or more keywords 
that you want to find such as “Apple” and “Mac”. 
 Typing a web site address means knowing the exact web site address you want to find and 
spelling it correctly. If you misspell a web site address, you won’t find the web site that you 
want. The advantage of typing a web site address is that it gets you directly to the web site 
that you want to view. 
 To visit a web site by typing its address, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Safari program.  
 2. 
 Click in the Search text field at the top center of the Safari window, 
as shown in Figure  17-5 .  
 Note   Be especially careful when typing a web site address. Malicious hackers often create web 
sites with domain addresses that match commonly misspelled web site addresses. If you visit a 
malicious web site, it could lock up your browser and try to install malware on your computer. 
 Figure 17-5.   The Search text field appears at the top center of the Safari window 
 3. 
 Type a web site address (such as    www.apress.com  ) or type a search 
query (such as “books on OS X”) and press Return. Safari displays 
the web site at the address that you specified or a list of web sites 
that match your search query (“books on OS X”).  
 Note   When typing a search query, use as many words as possible to avoid finding web sites 
containing irrelevant information. So rather than just search for “Apple”, search for “Apple Mac” or 
“Apple Mac refurbished” to find more web sites that exactly match your search criteria. 
 

305
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 Defining a Default Search Engine 
 When you type a search query,   Safari sends your query to its default search engine, which is 
Google. If you want, you can choose a different search engine. 
 Since Google tracks your search queries (so they know which Google ads to show you), 
some people prefer DuckDuckGo as their search engine since they don’t track your search 
queries like Google does. 
 Baidu is the most popular search engine in Asia so if you search Asian web sites frequently, 
you may want to switch to Baidu instead. If for some reason you simply don’t like the results 
Google consistently provides, you can try switching to Yahoo! or Bing. 
 To define a default search engine for Safari, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Safari program.  
 2. 
 Click the Safari menu and choose Preferences. A Preferences 
window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Search icon. The Search window appears.  
 4. 
 Click the Search engine pop-up menu and choose a search engine, 
such as Yahoo! or DuckDuckGo, as shown in Figure  17-6 . 
 Note  If you define a default search engine for Safari, this won’t change the default search engine 
for any other browsers you may have installed on your Mac, such as Chrome or Firefox. 
 Figure 17-6.   The Search text field appears at the top center of the Safari window 
 5. 
 Click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the 
Search window to make it go away.  
 

306
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 Opening Multiple Web Sites 
 When you first start  Safari,   you can open and view a single web site. If you want to view 
another web site, the new web site appears and your previously viewed web site disappears. 
 In some cases, this might be what you want, but if you want to keep a web site visible while 
looking at more web sites at the same time, you may need to open additional web sites 
inside of multiple windows or tabs. 
 When you open multiple windows, you can arrange the windows on the screen so that you 
can view them side by side. However, multiple windows can clutter your screen so another 
alternative is to open multiple web sites as separate tabs inside a single window, as shown 
in Figure  17-7 . 
 Figure 17-7.   Multiple tabs let you view several web sites within a single window 
 Opening a Web Site in Another Window 
 To open another web site in a separate  window , follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Safari program.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Window (or press 
Command+N). Safari displays another window.  
 3. 
 Click in the Search text field in the new Safari window. Type a web 
site address or a search query and then press Return.  
 4. 
 Click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the 
Safari window when you’re done using it.  
 Opening a Web Site in a Tab 
 Multiple  windows make it easy to view two or more web sites side by side. However, if you 
don’t need to view two or more web sites at the same time, you can open multiple web sites 
in tabs. 
 Tabs appear in a single window so they take up less space and make it easy to quickly 
switch from one web site to another. If you want, you can even open multiple windows 
where each window has two or more tabs. 
 

307
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 To open a web site in a tab, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Safari program.  
 2. 
 Create a new tab by choosing one of the following:
 a.  Click the “Add new tab” button (it looks like a +) (see Figure  17-7 ). 
 b.  Click the File menu and choose New Tab (File ➤ New Tab).  
 c.  Press Command+T.  
 3. 
 Click in the Search text field in the new Safari tab. Type a web site 
address or search query and press Return.  
 4. 
 When you’re done with a tab, move the pointer over the tab so 
a close button (an X) appears to the left of that tab, as shown in 
Figure  17-8 . 
 Figure 17-8.   A close button appears to the left of a tab when you move the pointer over that tab 
 5. 
 Click the close button on a tab that you want to close. The tab 
disappears.  
 Defining Default Web Sites for New Windows and Tabs 
 Each time you open  another  web site in a separate window or tab, Safari displays a default 
web page. Initially this default web page is your list of Favorite web sites, but you can define 
a new default web page for both new windows and tabs by following these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Safari program.  
 2. 
 Click the Safari menu and choose Preferences (Safari ➤ 
Preferences). A Preferences window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the General tab. The General window appears, as shown in 
Figure  17-9 .

option.  
 5. 
 Click in the New tabs open with: pop-up menu and choose an 
option.  
 6. 
 Click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the 
General window to make it go away.  
 Turning Tabs into Multiple Windows (and vice versa) 
 If  you open another web site in a separate window, you can always merge all open Safari 
windows into one and display those web sites as tabs within a single Safari window. 
 Likewise, if you open multiple web sites in separate tabs, you can always display those tabs 
as different windows instead. By switching between multiple windows and tabs, you can 
view your web sites the way you like best. 
 Figure 17-9.   The General window lets you define default web pages for new windows and tabs

CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 To merge multiple Safari windows into tabs, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open two or more separate windows in Safari.  
 2. 
 Click the Window menu and choose Merge All Windows, as shown 
in Figure  17-10 . Safari closes all open Safari windows and displays 
them as tabs in a single window.  
 Figure 17-10.    The Merge All Windows command turns multiple windows into tabs 
 To display a Safari tab as a separate window, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open a window in Safari that displays two or more tabs.  
 2. 
 Click the tab that you want to display as a separate window.  
 3. 
 Click the Window menu and choose Move Tab to New Window 
(Windows ➤ Move Tab to New Window) (see Figure  17-10 ). Safari 
displays your chosen tab in a separate window.  
 For each tab that you want to display in a separate window, you’ll have to repeat 
steps 2 and 3.  
 Going Back to Previously Viewed Web Sites 
 Browsing the  Internet  encourages you to explore by clicking various links to see something 
new. The problem is that as you explore the Internet, you may want to return to a previous 
web site that you recently looked at. 
 

310
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 Fortunately, Safari offers two ways to go back to previous viewed web sites:
 Use the Show the previous page and “Show the next page” buttons  
 Use the History menu  
 The “Show the previous page” and “Show the next page” buttons appear in the upper-left 
corner of the Safari window, as shown in Figure  17-11 . 
 Figure 17-11.   The “Show the previous” page and “Show the next page” buttons 
 Each time that you click a web page link that displays a new web page, you can go back to 
the previous web page by clicking the “Show previous page” button. 
 Suppose you visit a financial web page and then visit an animal web page. With the animal 
web page displayed, clicking the “Show previous page” button returns you to the financial 
web page. Clicking the “Show next page” button displays the animal web page again. 
 Essentially, the “Show previous page” and ”Show next page” buttons let you go back one 
web page at a time to what you previously viewed. Until you go back at least one web page, 
the “Show next page” button remains dimmed and unavailable. 
 As an alternative to clicking the “Show previous page” and “Show next page” buttons, you 
can also do one of the following:
 Click the History menu and choose Back or Forward  
 Press Command+[ to choose the Back command, or press Command+] 
to choose the Forward command  
 Going back and forth one web page at a time is slow. If you want to go back to a web site that 
you viewed earlier in the day but browsed through dozens of other web sites since then, going 
back one web page at a time is clumsy. A faster alternative is to view your browsing history. 
 Each time you visit a web site, Safari keeps track of the site in its history list. By viewing this 
history list, you can see a list of previously visited web sites and just click the one that you 
want to return to. 
 To use Safari’s history list, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start Safari and browse different web sites.  
 2. 
 Click the History menu. A list of previously viewed web sites appears, 
as shown in Figure  17-12 . 
 

311
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 3. 
 Click a web site that appears in the History menu list.  
 Another way to use Safari’s history list is to do one of the following:
 Click the History menu and choose Show History (History ➤ Show 
History)  
 Press Command+Y  
 Figure 17-12.    The History menu lists previously viewed web sites 
 

312
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 When you choose one of these two methods, Safari displays a detailed history list that displays 
the actual web site address in addition to the web site name, as shown in Figure  17-13 .  
 Figure 17-13.    Viewing a detailed history list in Safari 
 To close this detailed history list, just press Command+Y or click the History menu and 
choose Hide History.  
 Protecting Your Privacy 
 One drawback of storing  your   browsing history is that you may not want anyone else to see 
which web sites you may have visited. Since you can’t always keep people from away from 
your Mac, you can protect your privacy in two ways. 
 First, you can erase your browsing history. Second, you can use a special private browsing 
feature of Safari. 
 The drawback of erasing your browsing history is that you may delete a web site that you 
may want to visit later. If you use the private browsing feature of Safari, you can never go 
back to previously viewed web sites since Safari won’t keep track of them. 
 When you erase your history, you have a choice of four options:
 The last hour  
 Today 
 Today and yesterday  
 All history  
 

313
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 Erasing Your Browsing History 
 To erase your history,   follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start Safari.  
 2. 
 Click the History menu and choose Clear History (History ➤ Clear 
History). A dialog asks how much of your browsing history you want 
to delete, as shown in Figure  17-14 . 
 Figure 17-14.   Deleting your browsing history in Safari 
 Figure 17-15.    Viewing a private browsing window 
 3. 
 Click the Clear pop-up menu and choose how far back you want to 
delete your history, such as today or the last hour.  
 4. 
 Click the Clear History button.  
 Because Safari originally saved your browser history, erasing it simply removes it from Safari 
but does not delete it from your hard disk. That means it’s still possible to retrieve your 
browser history using special forensics tools. 
 If you really want to protect your privacy, use Safari’s private browsing feature. This doesn’t 
save any of your browsing history, so it’s impossible to retrieve it later. 
 To use private browsing, click the File menu and choose New Private Window (File ➤ New 
Private Window), or press Shift+Command+N. Safari lets you know you’re in a private 
browsing window by displaying the search text field with a dark background and by 
displaying a message near the top of the window, as shown in Figure  17-15 .  
 A private browsing window lets you create additional tabs as well where each tab also lets you 
browse privately without saving your history. When you’re done with a private browsing window, 
click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the private browsing window.  
 
 

314
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 Defining Browser Privacy Settings 
 When you browse the Internet,   many web sites use small files known as cookies to track 
your behavior. In addition, some web sites can even identify your location. While this is 
handy in helping you find directions on a map, it can also be used to pinpoint your location, 
which you might not want. 
 To further protect your privacy, you can block cookies, location services, and tracking. It may 
not block particularly devious web sites, but it can provide an additional level of privacy. 
 The most secure setting is to always block cookies, deny all location services, and ask web 
sites not to track your activity. 
 If you always block cookies, you’ll lose the convenience of web sites recognizing you when 
you return. If you block location services, you won’t be able to get custom information from 
your area. You may want to experiment with different settings so that you can determine 
what trade-off between convenience and privacy you’re willing to accept. 
 To define browser settings for Safari, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start Safari.  
 2. 
 Click the Safari menu and choose Preferences (Safari ➤ 
Preferences). The Preferences window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Privacy icon. Safari’s Privacy settings appear, as shown in 
Figure  17-16 . 
 Figure 17-16.   Safari’s Privacy settings 
 

315
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 4. 
 Choose the options you want.  
 5. 
 Click the red button (the close button) in the upper-left corner to 
make the Privacy window disappear.  
 Using Bookmarks 
 Jumping to a web site from  your  history list is convenient, but if there are web sites you visit 
frequently, it’s far easier to save those web sites as bookmarks instead. 
 When you bookmark web sites, you can store those bookmarks in one of the following three 
places (and as shown in Figure  17-17 ):
 The Bookmarks menu  
 The Bookmarks sidebar  
 The Favorites bar  
 Figure 17-17.   Places to store bookmarked web sites 
 Bookmarks are best for saving your favorite web sites. Now you can quickly access your 
favorite web sites with just one click of the mouse (or trackpad).  
 Bookmarking a Web Site 
 When you find a favorite web  site  , create a bookmark so that you’ll always be able to find 
that web site again. When bookmark a web site, you can give it a descriptive name and 
choose where to store it. 
 To bookmark a web site, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start Safari.  
 2. 
 Open any web site that you want to visit repeatedly.  
 3. 
 Click the Bookmark menu and choose Add Bookmark (Bookmark ➤ 
Add Bookmark). A dialog asks where you want to save your 
bookmark and what descriptive name you want to give it, as 
shown in Figure  17-18 .  
 

316
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 4. 
 Click in the Add this page to pop-up menu and choose a location 
where you want to save your bookmark.  
 5. 
 Click in the bottom text field and edit or type a descriptive name for 
your bookmark.  
 6. 
 Click the Add button.  
 Viewing Bookmarks 
 Once you’ve saved  your  bookmark, you’ll eventually want to view it. To view bookmarks on 
the Bookmarks menu, just click the Bookmarks menu. 
 To view bookmarks in the Bookmarks sidebar, click the View menu and choose Show 
Bookmarks Sidebar (View ➤ Show Bookmarks Sidebar). 
 To view bookmarks in the Favorites bar, click the View menu and choose Show Favorites Bar 
(View ➤ Show Favorites Bar). 
 No matter where you’ve stored your bookmarks, you can click a bookmark to jump to the 
web site that it represents.  
 Creating Bookmark Folders 
 The more  bookmarks you  add, the more cluttered your bookmarks become until it’s hard 
to find any particular bookmark. To organize your bookmarks, you can create bookmark 
folders. That way you can group related bookmarks together and avoid getting overwhelmed 
by a long list of bookmarks. 
 To create a bookmark folder, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start Safari.  
 2. 
 Click the Bookmark menu and choose Edit Bookmarks (Bookmark ➤ 
Edit Bookmarks). Safari displays all your bookmarks and the web site 
addresses stored in them, as shown in Figure  17-19 . 
 Figure 17-18.   Defining a bookmark 
 

317
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 3. 
 Click the Bookmarks menu and choose Add Bookmark Folder. Safari 
creates a folder called untitled folder.  
 4. 
 Type a descriptive name for your bookmark folder.  
 5. 
 Move the pointer over your newly created bookmark folder, hold 
down the left mouse button (or press a finger on the trackpad), and 
drag the bookmark folder where you want to store it, such as under 
the Bookmarks Menu or Favorites category.  
 6. 
 Move the pointer over any bookmark, hold down the left mouse 
button (or press a finger on the trackpad), and drag the bookmark in 
your newly created bookmark folder.  
 Figure 17-19.   Editing bookmarks 
 

318
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 Editing Bookmarks 
 After you’ve created  a bookmark, you can always modify that bookmark later, such as 
changing its descriptive name or editing its web site address. Editing also lets you rearrange 
your bookmarks by dragging them with the mouse or trackpad. 
 To edit a bookmark, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start Safari.  
 2. 
 Click the Bookmark menu and choose Edit Bookmarks (Bookmark ➤ 
Edit Bookmarks). Safari displays all your bookmarks (see Figure  17-18 ). 
 3. 
 Right-click the bookmark you want to edit. A pop-up menu appears, 
as shown in Figure  17-20 . 
 Figure 17-20.   Right-clicking a bookmark displays a pop-up menu 
 4. 
 Choose one of the following:
 a.  Rename: Lets you rename the bookmark.  
 b.  Edit Address: Lets you edit the web site address stored in the 
bookmark.  
 c.  Remove: Lets you remove a bookmark from Safari.  
 Importing and Exporting Bookmarks 
 If you have a desktop  and   laptop Mac, you’ll probably want to have the same bookmarks on 
both computers. To do this, you can export bookmarks from Safari and then import them on 
another computer. 
 If you’ve been using another browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, you can import bookmarks 
out of those browsers and import them into Safari. Or you can export bookmarks out of 
Safari and import them into a different browser. 
 Importing and exporting bookmarks just makes sure that you can use bookmarks on other 
computers or browsers. When you export bookmarks out of Safari, all of your bookmarks are 
saved in a single HTML (HyperText Markup Language) file that all browsers and computers 
can read. 
 

319
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 To export a bookmark, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start Safari.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose Export Bookmarks (File ➤ Export 
Bookmarks). A dialog asks for a name to give your bookmark file and 
a location to store it in.  
 3. 
 Type a descriptive name for your bookmark file and choose a 
location to store it in.  
 4. 
 Click the Save button.  
 To import a bookmark, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start Safari.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose Import Bookmarks (File ➤ Import 
Bookmarks). A dialog asks for a bookmark file to import.  
 3. 
 Click the bookmark file that you want to use and click the Import 
button.  
 Creating a Reading List 
 Bookmarks are meant to  store  web sites that you plan to visit regularly in the future. 
However, if you only want to save a web page to read but don’t necessarily want to visit that 
site later, you can use Safari’s reading list feature instead. 
 A reading list essentially acts like bookmarks. The only difference is that a reading list 
appears in a sidebar that you can hide or view at any time. 
 To place a web page on a reading list, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start Safari.  
 2. 
 Open a web page that you want to temporarily save to read later.  
 3. 
 Click the Bookmarks menu and choose Add to Reading List 
(Bookmarks ➤ Add to Reading List). Safari adds the web page to the 
Reading List sidebar.  
 4. 
 Click the View menu and choose Show Reading List Sidebar (View ➤ 
Show Reading List Sidebar). The reading list sidebar appears, as 
shown in Figure  17-21 . 

320
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 5. 
 Click any item in the reading list to view the contents of that web 
page.  
 To remove a web page from the reading list, right-click the web page that you want to 
remove. When a pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure  17-22 , choose either Remove 
Item or Clear All Items (to clear your entire reading list).

321
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 Using AutoFill 
 If you often need to  type  the same information into different web sites, you may want to use 
AutoFill. AutoFill lets you store common information such as your name, street address, and 
credit card number. Now if you need to fill in this information on a web page, AutoFill can 
type all of this information for you automatically. 
 AutoFill can store four different types of information:
 Your contact information including your name, address, e-mail address, 
and phone number  
 User names and passwords for different web sites  
 Credit card numbers  
 Additional sign-in information  
 The advantage of AutoFill is that it can simplify typing information needed to order products 
online or access different types of web sites, such as those that require a user name and 
password. 
 The disadvantage of AutoFill is if someone accesses your Mac without your permission, they 
could impersonate you by letting AutoFill automatically enter your personal data. 
 AutoFill works automatically as soon as it detects you’re filling out a form in Safari, as shown 
in Figure  17-23 . 
 Note  For security, AutoFill does not save your credit card’s security code. This prevents someone 
from accessing your Mac and using AutoFill to buy something with your stored credit card number. 
 Figure 17-23.   AutoFill appears automatically when you start filling out a form 
 If you click the AutoFill miniature window, Safari displays your saved information so that you 
can verify that it’s correct. Then click the AutoFill button to automatically fill in the form. 
 

322
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 To store and edit data for AutoFill to use, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start Safari.  
 2. 
 Click the Safari menu and choose Preferences (Safari ➤ 
Preferences).  
 3. 
 Click the AutoFill icon. The AutoFill window appears, as shown in 
Figure  17-24 . 
 Figure 17-24.    The AutoFill window 
 4. 
 (Optional) Select or clear the check boxes in front of each AutoFill 
web form option. If you don’t want AutoFill to use your credit card 
information, clear the “Credit cards” check box.  
 5. 
 Click the Edit button next to the AutoFill option that you want to 
modify. Depending on the option that you choose, a different window 
appears, letting you edit the saved data.  
 Muting Audio 
 If you visit some web sites,  ads  might start blaring right away. To avoid this nuisance of 
trying to find a way to lower or mute the volume, Safari offers a handy mute feature that 
appears on the right side of each tab. 
 Now if you visit a web site that blasts unwanted audio right away, you can quickly shut off 
the volume or turn it back on again just by clicking the volume icon on the tab, as shown in 
Figure  17-25 . 
 

323
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 Dealing with Unresponsive Web Pages 
 What’s becoming an  increasingly   annoying problem is malicious web sites that lock up 
Safari and keep you from shutting down the window or tab. Typically, a booby-trapped web 
site locks up Safari and displays a warning message, as shown in Figure  17-26 . 
 Figure 17-25.   The volume icon appears on the far right of each Safari tab 
 Figure 17-26.    A typical phony warning that freezes Safari 
 
 

324
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 Any time you see a web page warning of a computer infection that won’t let you do anything 
with Safari, you likely visited a malicious web site. 
 To shut down Safari when it locks up, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of the screen.  
 2. 
 Choose Force Quit. A Force Quit window appears, as shown in 
Figure  17-27 . 
 Figure 17-27.   The Force Quit window lets you shut down any unresponsive program 
 3. 
 Click Safari.  
 4. 
 Click the Force Quit button to shut down Safari.  
 5. 
 Hold down the Shift key and open Safari again, such as clicking 
the Safari icon on the Dock or double-clicking the Safari icon in the 
Applications folder.  
 Normally, if you open Safari, it reopens all previously opened tabs and windows. By holding 
down the Shift key, you force Safari to just open a single window. This keeps Safari from 
reopening the malicious web site that originally locked up your browser.  
 Summary 
 Although you can always install and use any browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, Safari is 
optimized for OS X, especially on laptops that need to conserve power. 
 In Safari, you can browse web sites and save them later as bookmarks or part of a reading 
list. If you need to open and view multiple web sites at the same time, you can open them in 
separate windows or in multiple tabs within each window. 
 

325
CHAPTER 17: Browsing the Internet
 To protect your privacy, Safari offers a special privacy browsing window or you can define 
various privacy settings so that you control what web sites can track of your activities. 
 If you frequently fill out information such as your name, address, and credit card number, 
you can use Safari’s AutoFill feature to automatically fill in information. 
 Safari acts as a gateway to the Internet, so be sure that you know how to use this program 
so that you can access information scattered all over the world  .

 Chapter 18  
 Using E-mail 
 Beyond browsing various web sites, the second most common use for the Internet is 
sending and receiving e-mail. To help you create and receive e-mail, OS X comes with a 
program called Mail. 
 Besides letting you send and receive text messages, e-mail also lets you send and receive 
files. This gives you a simple way to share files between two different computers as long as 
both computers can open that file. 
 There are two common ways to access an  e-mail  account:
  Through a browser  
  Through an e-mail program  
 The advantage of accessing your e-mail account through a browser is that you can read 
messages using any computer connected to the Internet. The disadvantage of using a 
browser is that you can’t read any messages if you don’t have an Internet connection. 
 The advantage of using an e-mail program is that your messages will be stored on your 
computer so that you can read them any time that you want whether you have an Internet 
connection or not. The disadvantage is that your messages are stored on one computer so 
that you can’t access those messages from another computer unless you copy or download 
them to another computer. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use OS X’s e-mail program called Mail. If you don’t like 
Mail, you can always use a different e-mail program. 

328
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 Setting Up an E-mail Account 
 To send and  receive   e-mail, you need to create an e-mail account. You can create an e-mail 
account with major web sites (such as Google or Yahoo!), your Internet service provider, or 
your company. To set up an e-mail account, you need to know the following information:
  Your e-mail address (such as JohnSmith@mycompany.com): You can 
often choose the first part of your e-mail address (such as JohnSmith 
or JSmith) but the second part of your e-mail address will be defined 
by the e-mail provider such as Google (@gmail.com) or your Internet 
service provider, such as your cable company (@cox.net).  
  Password: This is the password that gives you access to your account.  
 Once you know all the information about your e-mail account, you can set up Mail to use 
that e-mail account. The Mail program can automatically set up e-mail accounts for popular 
e-mail services such as Google or AOL, but you might need to manually set up an account. 
 The first time you run the Mail program, it will guide you through the process of setting up 
an e-mail account. With e-mail providers like Google, Yahoo!, or AOL, you need to visit their 
web sites to set up an e-mail account. 
 When you set up an e-mail account through common e-mail providers like AOL or Google, 
you’ll need to choose a user name and password. When you’re done setting up an e-mail 
account, you can access your e-mail through a web page or download your e-mail to your 
computer using Mail. 
 To get an existing e-mail account to work within Mail, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Mail program.  
 2. 
 Click the Mail menu and choose Add Account. A list of e-mail 
providers appears, as shown in Figure  18-1 . This list lets you choose 
a popular e-mail account that Mail can automatically help you set up.  
 Note  Make sure that you get all the information you need to set up an e-mail account or else you 
won’t be able to send or receive e-mail. 

329
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 3. 
 Click an e-mail account provider, such as AOL or Google. If you don’t 
see your e-mail account provider, click the Other Mail Account radio 
button. 
 4. 
 Click the Continue button and follow the instructions on the screen.  
 5. 
 If you choose one of the common e-mail providers, Mail asks you to 
sign into your account with your user name and password. Then Mail 
configures itself automatically so that you’re able to send and receive 
e-mail from that account.  
 Figure 18-1.   The list of e-mail accounts that Mail can automatically recognize 
 

330
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 If you aren’t using a common e-mail provider, you’ll need to type additional information into 
Mail yourself, such as:
  Your e-mail account type: Common account types are IMAP and POP, 
but many corporations may use other e-mail account types, such as 
Microsoft Exchange.  
  Incoming mail server name: The name of the computer that sends e-mail 
to you; it usually has a name like mail.server.com or pop.server.com, 
where server.com is the name of the mail server.  
  Outgoing mail server name: The name of the computer that lets you 
send e-mail. It usually has a name like smtp.server.com, where server.
com is the name of the mail server.  
 To get this information, you need to contact your e-mail provider. 
 Sending E-mail 
 Once you’ve set up an  e-mail   account, you’ll likely want to send e-mail to other people. 
To create a new message, you need to define three items:
  An e-mail address: The e-mail address of the person you want to receive 
the message.  
  A subject: This identifies the topic of your message.  
  The message itself: This contains the text of your message, which can 
be as long or as short as you wish.  
 To create a new message and send it, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Mail program.  
 2. 
 Do one of the following to create a new message (also see Figure  18-2 ): 
 a.  Click the File menu and choose New Message (File ➤ New Message).  
 b.  Press Command+N.  
 c.  Click the New Message icon.  
  
 A new message window appears.  
 Note  When you connect the Mail program to an e-mail account, you can access your e-mail 
through a browser or through the Mail program; you can use whichever method is most convenient. 

331
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 3. 
 Click in the To: text field and type an e-mail address. (Make sure that 
you type the e-mail address correctly or else your message will not 
be sent to the person you want to receive it.)  
 4. 
 Click in the Subject: text field and type the topic of your message.  
 5. 
 Click in the message text box and type your message. (Remember, 
you can paste text in here from other programs, such as a word 
processor or spreadsheet.)  
 6. 
 Click the Send icon, as shown in Figure  18-3 , to send your message. 
To view all of your sent messages, click the Sent folder in the left 
pane of the Mail window.  
 Figure 18-2.   Choosing the New Message command 
 

332
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 To send a message, you must have an e-mail address in the To: text field. If you want to 
send the same message to multiple people, you can use the carbon copy (cc:) or blind 
carbon copy (bcc:) feature. 
 Carbon copy  means everyone who receives your message can see all the e-mail addresses 
of everyone who received the same message. 
 Blind copy  means everyone who receives your message can only see your e-mail address 
but no one else’s e-mail address. For privacy, use blind copy instead of carbon copy. 
 To add additional e-mail addresses to send a message to, click the View menu and choose 
Cc Address Field or Bcc Address Field (View ➤ Cc Address Field or View ➤ Bcc Address 
Field), as shown in Figure  18-4 .

CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 Once you’ve displayed the Cc or Bcc Address Field, you can type additional e-mail 
addresses into either of these fields to send the same message to multiple recipients.  
 Saving Drafts 
 Rather than write a  message   and send it off right away, you can save your message by 
clicking the file menu and choosing Save, or pressing Command+S. When you save a 
message without sending it, Mail stores the message in your Drafts folder that appears in the 
left pane of the Mail window, as shown in Figure  18-5 . 
 Figure 18-4.   The View menu displays Cc Address Field and Bcc Address Field options 
 

334
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 By saving messages as drafts, you can edit them later. To open a message stored in your 
Drafts folder, just click the Drafts folder and then double-click the message that you want to 
edit. Now you can edit your message and click the Send icon when you’re ready to send it.  
 Formatting Text 
 Most people just type  ordinary   text in their e-mail messages. However, you may want to 
format text in fancy ways, such as choosing different fonts and font sizes, using bold or 
italics, or aligning text in the center or to the right. 
 To format text, you have two options. First, you can use the Format menu. Second, you can 
use the format bar that you can hide or display by clicking the Show/Hide format bar icon, 
as shown in Figure  18-6 . 
 Figure 18-6.   You can format text with the Format menu or format bar

335
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 Clicking the Show/Hide format bar icon toggles between showing and hiding the format bar. 
By default, the format bar is hidden.  
 Using Stationery 
 Formatting text can make  your  messages look prettier, but to make your messages look even 
better, you can use stationery. Stationery lets you choose from a template of different designs 
so that your message won’t look like plain text but more colorful, as shown in Figure  18-7 .  
 Figure 18-7.   Stationery can make your e-mail messages look fancier 
 

336
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 To use stationery, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Create a new message in the Mail program to open a message 
window. 
 2. 
 Click the Show/Hide stationery pane icon to view a list of different 
stationery templates, as shown in Figure  18-8 .  
 Figure 18-8.    Viewing stationery templates 
 3. 
 Click a stationery category, such as Photos or Sentiments.  
 4. 
 Click the stationery template you want to use. Your chosen stationery 
template appears. At this point, you can customize the text and 
pictures by clicking the part you want to modify.  
 Attaching a File 
 Often times you may not  just  want to send text but an actual file as well such as a word 
processor document, a database file, or a spreadsheet. When you want to send someone a 
file created by another program, such as Microsoft Excel, you can attach a file to a message 
and send that file by e-mail. 
 Note  Depending on your e-mail provider, there may be a maximum file size limit you can send, 
such as 10MB. 
 

337
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 You can attach multiple files of any type to a single message. However, if you plan to send 
multiple files, it’s best to compress them by opening the Finder, selecting all the files you 
want to send, clicking the File menu and choosing Compress (File ➤ Compress). 
 Compressing creates a single ZIP file that you can attach to a message. If you receive a ZIP file, 
you can unzip it by double-clicking on the ZIP file to access the multiple files stored inside. 
 To attach a file to a message, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Create a new message in the Mail program to open a message window.  
 2. 
 Click the Attach file icon, or click the File menu and choose Attach 
Files (File ➤ Attach Files), as shown in Figure  18-9 . A dialog lets you 
choose a file to attach to your message.  
 Figure 18-9.   The Search text field appears at the top of the Safari window 
 3. 
 Click a file to attach to your message and click the Choose File 
button. An icon representing your file appears in your message (see 
Figure  18-9 ). (You can click the attached file and press the Delete or 
Backspace key if you change your mind and don’t want to attach the 
file to your message after all.)  
 Viewing Sent Messages 
 Whenever you send  a  message, the Mail program saves a copy of that message in its Sent 
folder, which appears in the left pane of the Mail program. If you click the Sent folder icon in 
the left pane, you can see a list of messages you’ve sent in chronological order. 
 If you click a specific message, you can read the contents of that message. Now you can 
review any of your past messages to see exactly what you sent and the time and date that 
you sent it.  
 

338
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 Saving E-mail Addresses 
 Typing an  e-mail address  can get cumbersome because if you misspell one character, your 
e-mail won’t go through. Rather than type an e-mail address in, it’s far easier to type it once, 
save it, and then just click a saved e-mail address that you want to use. 
 To save e-mail addresses, you use the Contacts program. You can open the Contacts 
program through the Finder window and then manually type in someone’s name and e-mail 
address. 
 To save e-mail addresses in the Contacts program, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts program in the Applications folder.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Card (or press Command+N). 
The Contacts program displays an empty card window, as shown in 
Figure  18-10 . 
 Figure 18-10.   An empty card for filling in a person’s name and e-mail address 
 3. 
 Type a person’s name and e-mail address.  
 4. 
 Click the Done button when you’ve typed all the contact information 
about that person. You’ve now saved an e-mail address into the 
contacts program.  
 Once you’ve saved an e-mail address in the Contacts program, you can now retrieve that 
saved e-mail address when you create a new message in the Mail program. 
 

339
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 To send a message to a saved e-mail address, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Create a new message in the Mail program to open a message 
window. 
 2. 
 Click the plus (+) icon that appears on the far right in the To: text 
field. A pop-up window appears, as shown in Figure  18-11 . 
 Figure 18-11.   The + icon lets you choose from a list of saved e-mail addresses 
 3. 
 Click a name that contains a saved e-mail address. (You can also 
type part or all of a name in the Search field to find a person’s name 
and e-mail address faster.) Mail automatically types in the stored 
e-mail address for that person.  
 Manually typing an e-mail address into the Contacts program is one way to save e-mail 
addresses. Another way is to simply add the e-mail address of someone who sent you a 
message. 
 Note   You can also use saved e-mail addresses in the Cc: and Bcc: text fields as well. 
 

340
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 To add the e-mail address of a message to the Contacts program, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start the Mail program and click a message that contains an e-mail 
address you want to save in the Contacts program. Mail displays the 
message contents in the right pane.  
 2. 
 Move the pointer over the sender’s e-mail address. Mail highlights 
the sender’s e-mail address and displays a downward-pointing arrow 
to the right of that e-mail address.  
 3. 
 Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the sender’s e-mail 
address. A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure  18-12 . 
 Figure 18-12.    Adding an e-mail address from a received message 
 4. 
 Choose one of the following:
 a.  Add to Contacts: Saves your chosen e-mail address to your Contacts 
program so that you can use this saved e-mail address in the future.  
 b.  New E-mail: Creates a new message with the recipient’s e-mail address 
automatically typed in the To: text field but does not save the e-mail address 
in the Contacts program.  
 Getting New Mail 
 Even if your Mac is  connected   to the Internet, you may still need to tell the Mail program 
to retrieve your messages from your e-mail account. To get any new e-mail messages, you 
can manually retrieve them or define settings that determine how often the Mail program 
automatically checks for messages. 
 To manually retrieve new e-mail messages, do one of the following (also see Figure  18-13 ):
  Click the Mailbox menu and choose Get New Mail.  
  Click the Get New Messages icon in the upper-left corner of the Mail 
program.  
 

341
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 Rather than manually retrieve new messages from your e-mail account, you can also define 
how often you want the Mail program do retrieve new e-mail. To define how often you want 
the Mail program to retrieve new e-mail, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start the Mail program.  
 2. 
 Click the Mail menu and choose Preferences (Mail ➤ Preferences). 
A Preferences window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the General icon.  
 4. 
 Click the “Check for new messages” pop-up menu and choose an 
option, as shown in Figure  18-14 . 
 Figure 18-13.   Manually retrieve new e-mail messages in the Mail program 
 

342
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 5. 
 Click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the 
Preferences window to make it disappear.  
 Replying to Messages 
 When you receive  messages  , you can reply or create a new message altogether. When you 
reply to a message, you don’t save the sender’s e-mail address and you send the previous 
contents of the message for the recipient’s reference. 
 For example, suppose you receive a message asking, “Are you coming to my birthday party 
this Saturday?” 
 If you reply to this message, Mail displays the message contents within your reply, as shown 
in Figure  18-15 . 
 Figure 18-14.   The Check for new messages pop-up menu lets you choose an option for retrieving e-mail automatically 
 

343
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 To make the previous message contents easy to find, the Mail program draws a vertical bar 
in the left margin and displays the previous message in a different color. 
 Each time you reference another previous message, the Mail program draws another vertical 
bar so that you can see the number of previous messages that you’ve references so far. 
 Mail gives you three ways to reply to a message:
  Reply: Lets you send a message back to the e-mail address of the 
person who sent the message.  
  Reply All: Lets you send a message back to all e-mail addresses stored 
in the Cc: text fields.  
  Forward: Lets you share a message with someone else, typically not the 
person who sent you the original message.  
 The main difference between Reply and Reply All is that Reply sends a message to one 
person while Reply All sends a reply to everyone who received the original message. 
 To reply to a message, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start the Mail program.  
 2. 
 Click the message that you want to reply to.  
 3. 
 Do one of the following (also shown in Figure  18-16 ):
 a.  Click the Message menu and choose Reply (Message ➤ Reply).  
 b.  Press Command+R.  
 c.  Click the Reply icon.  
 d.  Click the Reply to All icon.  
 e.  Click the Forward icon.  
 Figure 18-15.   Replying to a message displays the contents of the received message 
 

344
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 4. 
 Type a message and click the Send icon (it looks like a paper 
airplane) to send your reply.  
 Searching Messages 
 Normally, the Mail  program  lists your messages in chronological order that it receives them. 
This is fine when you know the date that you received a particular message. But what if you 
don’t remember the exact date? 
 You can search for a particular message by the sender’s name, e-mail address, subject, or 
any keyword in the message itself. 
 To search for a message, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start the Mail program.  
 2. 
 Click in the Search text field that appears in the upper-right corner of 
the Mail window.  
 3. 
 Type part or all of the text that you want to find, such as a person’s 
name, e-mail address, or subject. As you type, Mail displays a list of 
messages that match your criteria, as shown in Figure  18-17 . 
 Figure 18-16.    The Reply, Reply All, and Forward icons 
 

345
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail

 Click the message that you want to view. The Mail program displays 
all messages that match your search criteria.  
 5. 
 Click the clear icon (it looks like an X inside a circle) that appears on 
the far right of the Search text field to clear out the Search text field, 
as shown in Figure  18-18 . When you clear the Search text field, the 
Mail program displays all of your messages, not just the messages 
that match your search criteria.

CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 Organizing Messages with Smart Mailboxes 
 In most places, a mail  carrier   delivers letters to your home by placing them in your mailbox. 
When you open your mailbox, all of your mail is lumped in a pile. 
 Many people organize their mail in separate piles, where one pile might represent bills and 
another might represent messages from work. 
 The Mail program on the Mac works the same way. When you receive messages in your 
e-mail account, those messages appear lumped together, which can make finding a 
particular type of message difficult. 
 Just as you might sort your physical letters into separate piles, you can organize e-mail 
messages in separate piles. In the Mail program, you can organize your e-mail messages 
using Smart Mailboxes. 
 Smart Mailboxes automatically collect certain types of messages, such as work-related 
messages or messages from a specific person. With Smart Mailboxes, you can quickly find 
the type of messages you need without wading through your entire list of messages.  
 Creating and Using a Smart Mailbox 
 You can create as  many  Smart Mailboxes as you wish. Unlike sorting physical letters into 
separate piles, Smart Mailboxes allow the same messages to appear in multiple Smart 
Mailboxes. 
 For example, you might have a Smart Mailbox for messages related to a specific project and 
a second Smart Mailbox for messages from a certain person. So it’s possible for a message 
to appear in two or more Smart Mailboxes at the same time. 
 When you create a Smart Mailbox, you must define rules that determine which types 
of messages appear in that Smart Mailbox. For example, you might only want to store 
messages from a certain person or messages on a specific type of subject. 
 You must define at least one rule, but you can define multiple rules. Multiple rules ensure 
that only certain types of messages appear in your Smart Mailbox, such as only messages 
from a certain person and related to a specific subject. 
 To create a Smart Mailbox, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start the Mail prog]ram.  
 2. 
 Click the Mailbox menu and choose New Smart Mailbox (Mailbox ➤ 
New Smart Mailbox). A dialog asks to name your Smart Mailbox and 
one or more rules to determine which types of e-mail messages are 
stored, as shown in Figure  18-19 . 

347
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 3. 
 Click in the Smart Mailbox Name text field and type a descriptive 
name.  
 4. 
 Click in the left pop-up menu and choose criteria to store certain 
types of e-mail messages, such as “Any recipient” or Subject, as 
shown in Figure  18-20 . 
 Figure 18-20.   Defining criteria for selecting which e-mail messages to store in the Smart Mailbox 
 Figure 18-19.   Defining a Smart Mailbox 
 
 

348
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 5. 
 Click in the middle pop-up menu to define additional criteria. 
Depending on what you chose in the left pop-up menu, the middle 
pop-up menu may display different options, as shown in Figure  18-21 .  
 Figure 18-21.   The second pop-up menu lets you define your criteria for choosing messages 
 Figure 18-22.   Smart Mailboxes appear in the left pane of the Mail window for easy access 
 6. 
 Click in the text field and type any additional information necessary 
for your rule, such as defining an e-mail address or a subject title.  
 7. 
 (Optional) Click the plus (+) icon on the right to create another rule. 
Then repeat steps 4-6.  
 When you create a Smart Mailbox, its name appears in the left pane of the Mail window, 
under the Smart Mailboxes category, as shown in Figure  18-22 . 
 Note  After you define one or more rules to define the type of messages to appear in your Smart 
Mailbox, test it to make sure it works correctly. 
 
 

349
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 To view the contents of a Smart Mailbox, just click the Smart Mailbox name that you want 
to view. 
 To edit the criteria for a Smart Mailbox, right-click a Smart Mailbox name. When a pop-up 
menu appears, choose Edit Smart Mailbox. 
 If you want to delete a Smart Mailbox, right-click the Smart Mailbox name, and when a 
pop-up menu appears, choose Delete Mailbox. A warning asks if you really want to delete 
the Smart Mailbox, as shown in Figure  18-23 . 
 Note  Deleting a Smart Mailbox does not delete any messages displayed inside that Smart 
Mailbox. 
 Figure 18-23.   You must confirm that you want to delete a Smart Mailbox 
 Deleting Messages 
 When you’re done  reading  a message and don’t need to keep it for future reference, delete 
it. Each time you delete a message, the Mail program stores it in the Trash folder. This gives 
you one last chance to retrieve a message if you want. 
 To delete a message, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start the Mail program.  
 2. 
 Click a message that you want to delete.  
 3. 
 Click the Edit menu and choose Delete (Edit ➤ Delete). Your chosen 
message now appears in the Trash folder.  
 Note  You can also right-click a message, and when a pop-up menu appears, choose Delete. 
 

350
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 Retrieving Deleted Messages 
 If you delete a message by mistake,   you can undo the delete command if you click the Edit 
menu and choose Undo (Edit ➤ Undo) or press Command+Z. 
 Unfortunately, the Undo command only works if you choose it immediately after deleting a 
message by mistake. If you deleted a message a long time ago and then suddenly decide 
you need it after all, you can undelete a message by retrieving it from the Trash folder. 
 To retrieve a message from the Trash folder, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Trash folder in the left pane of the Mail window. The 
Mail program lists all messages that you deleted using the Delete 
command.  
 2. 
 Click a message in the Trash folder that you want to retrieve.  
 3. 
 Click the Message menu, choose Move To, and choose Inbox. 
Choose the inbox name to store the deleted message.  
 Erasing Deleted Messages for Good 
 You can always retrieve  deleted  messages no matter how long ago you deleted them. 
However, you may eventually want to delete messages for good to save space on your Mac 
and to avoid the risk of other people reading them if they ever gain access to your computer. 
 To erase deleted messages for good, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start the Mail program.  
 2. 
 Right-click the Trash folder in the left pane of the Mail program. 
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure  18-24 . 
 Note  You can right-click a message, and when a pop-up menu appears, choose Move To, 
choose Inbox, and then choose the inbox name to store the deleted message. 

351
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 Figure 18-25.   A warning message lets you know that erasing the Trash folder is a permanent action 
 Figure 18-24.   Right-clicking the Trash folder displays a pop-up menu 
 3. 
 Choose Erase Deleted Items… A warning message appears, as 
shown in Figure  18-25 , letting you know that if you erase items in the 
Trash folder, you won’t be able to retrieve them later if you wish.  
 4. 
 Click the Erase button. The Mail program deletes all messages in the 
Trash folder.  
 
 

352
CHAPTER 18: Using E-mail
 Summary 
 The Mail program lets you retrieve messages from an e-mail account so that you can view 
and read them without connecting to the Internet. You can send messages by typing e-mail 
addresses each time, or store commonly used e-mail addresses in the Contacts program 
that you can use so that you don’t have to type them again. 
 You can send a message to one e-mail address at a time, or send the same message to 
multiple e-mail addresses at once. When sending the same message to multiple people, you 
can use either Cc: (carbon copy) or Bcc: (blind carbon copy). Carbon copy lets everyone see 
all the e-mail addresses who received the same message while blind carbon copy does not. 
 To help you find a particular message, you can search for it. Another alternative is to set 
up Smart Mailboxes that automatically store messages based on certain criteria, such as 
the sender’s e-mail address or message subject. Smart Mailboxes can help organize your 
messages automatically. 
 Once you delete a message, you can always retrieve it again from the Trash folder. 
To permanently delete a message, you must erase all deleted items in the Trash folder. 
Once you erase all deleted items in the Trash folder, you can never retrieve those deleted 
messages again. 
 The Mail program can connect to any e-mail account, such as Google or AOL. Use the Mail 
program as an alternative to reading your e-mail messages through a browser.

 Chapter 19  
 Using Messages and 
FaceTime 
 With the introduction of high-speed Internet in most places around the world, people now 
have a new way to communicate with each other. Instead of sending e-mail and waiting for a 
response, you can now communicate in real-time using either Messages or FaceTime. 
 Messages essentially lets you send and receive text messages through your Mac. FaceTime 
lets you talk to other people, turning your Mac into a video telephone. 
 Both Messages and Facetime require an Internet connection to work. As long as you have 
an Internet connection and need to communicate with someone right away, you can choose 
which method is best for you. 
 Setting Up a Messages Account 
 Before you can chat with  Messages  , you need to set up a Messages account. Your account 
determines how people can reach you to send a message. 
 The three most common types of accounts are Google, Yahoo!, and AOL e-mail addresses. 
If you aren’t using one of these services for e-mail, you can also connect Messages to an 
AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) or Jabber account. 
 AIM and  Jabber  are two popular instant messaging programs, so you can share text 
messages with people who may not be using the Messages program. 
 The Messages program can automatically recognize e-mail addresses from Google, Yahoo!, 
and AOL, but if you have an e-mail address with a different e-mail provider, you’ll need to 
define the settings yourself. 

354
CHAPTER 19: Using Messages and FaceTime

 Deleting Messages 
 If you don’t need to review  past   messages, you can delete them. There are two ways to 
delete messages. First, you can delete individual messages. Second, you can delete an 
entire person’s message conversation, which means you could wipe out all messages you’ve 
sent to a person and all messages that person has sent to you. 
 
 
 

360
CHAPTER 19: Using Messages and FaceTime
 To delete individual messages, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Messages program.  
 2. 
 Click a name, e-mail address, or mobile phone number that appears 
in the left pane of the Messages window. Messages shows all the 
messages that you’ve sent to that person and all messages that 
you’ve received from that person (see Figure  19-6 ). 
 3. 
 Click the message that you want to delete.  
 4. 
 Click the Edit menu and choose Delete (Edit ➤ Delete). (You can also 
right-click a message and choose Delete from the pop-up menu.) 
A warning dialog appears, letting you know that if you delete a 
message, you won’t be able to retrieve it later.  
 5. 
 Click the Delete button.  
 Deleting an individual message leaves the rest of your message conversation intact. If you 
would rather delete an entire conversation (all messages sent and received from a specific 
person), follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Messages program.  
 2. 
 Click a name, e-mail address, or mobile phone number that appears 
in the left pane of the Messages window. Messages shows all the 
messages that you’ve sent to that person and all the messages that 
you’ve received from that person (see Figure  19-6 ). 
 3. 
 Do one of the following:
 a.  Move the pointer over a name, e-mail address, or mobile phone number, and 
then click the X icon that appears.  
 b.  Move the pointer over a name, e-mail address, or mobile phone number, 
and then swipe two fingers to the left to reveal a red Delete button. Click the 
Delete button, as shown in Figure  19-10 . 
 A warning dialog appears to let you know that if you delete an entire 
conversation of messages, you can’t retrieve those deleted messages later.

 Click the Delete button.  
 Using FaceTime 
 The Messages  program  is best for sending and receiving text. If you want to chat in real-time 
using either audio or video, you need to use FaceTime. 
 To use FaceTime, you need an Apple ID so that you can assign an e-mail address to your 
FaceTime account. That way if someone wants to reach you, they just need to know your 
e-mail address. 
 If you set up a FaceTime account to work with your iPhone phone number, you can receive 
messages on your iPhone and your Mac. To link your FaceTime account to your mobile 
phone number or additional e-mail addresses, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the FaceTime program.  
 2. 
 Click the FaceTime menu and choose Preferences. A Preferences 
window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Settings tab and choose additional e-mail addresses or 
mobile phone numbers that you want to link to your FaceTime 
account.  
 4. 
 Click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner to make 
the Preferences window disappear.  
 Note  To use FaceTime, both people need a fast and reliable Internet connection and an Apple 
device that supports FaceTime, such as a Mac or iPhone. 
 Figure 19-10.   Deleting all messages in a conversation 
 

362
CHAPTER 19: Using Messages and FaceTime
 After you’ve set up FaceTime with your Apple ID and e-mail address or mobile phone 
number, you can start using FaceTime. FaceTime gives you the option of making an audio 
call (like a telephone) or a video call (where you can see the other person). You can choose 
which type of call to make by clicking the Video or Audio tab. 
 To make a FaceTime call, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Start the FaceTime program.  
 2. 
 Click the Video or Audio tab.  
 3. 
 Do one of the following to contact someone:
 a.  Click in the text field that displays the text “Enter a name, 
e-mail, or number” and type an e-mail address or mobile phone 
number, as shown in Figure  19-11 . 
 b.  Click a name, e-mail address, or mobile phone number that 
appears in the left pane of the FaceTime window. This lists 
people you’ve contacted through FaceTime in the past, so if you 
haven’t used FaceTime yet, this left pane will be empty.  
 c.  Click the plus (+) icon that appears on the far right of the text 
field that displays “Enter a name, e-mail, or number.” This 
displays a list of names stored in the Contacts program. Now 
click a name to contact that person.  
 Note  Video calls require a faster Internet connection, so if either person on the FaceTime call has 
a slow or less reliable Internet connection, they will likely experience audio and/or video issues. 

363
CHAPTER 19: Using Messages and FaceTime
 When someone receives a call through FaceTime, a FaceTime notification window appears, 
displaying an Accept or Decline button, as shown in Figure  19-12 . 
 Figure 19-11.   FaceTime lets you type in the e-mail address or mobile phone number of someone that you want to 
contact

 Blocking Callers in Messages and FaceTime 
 You may have chatted  with  someone through Messages or FaceTime in the past, but now 
your relationship with that person has ended. You may not want that person to contact 
you or to see their attempts to reach you. Fortunately, both the Messages and FaceTime 
programs offer ways to block a specific e-mail address or mobile phone number. When 
you block someone in Messages or FaceTime, your Mac completely ignores any contact 
requests from that person.

 Summary 
 When sending and receiving e-mail is too slow, you can communicate in real-time using text, 
audio, or video. The Messages program lets you type and send text messages to another 
person using a computer or smartphone. 
 FaceTime lets you chat with someone using audio or video. To use FaceTime, both people 
need an Apple product that supports FaceTime (such as a Mac or an iPhone). Audio calling 
in FaceTime is like making a telephone call. Video calling in FaceTime lets you talk and see 
someone at the same time. 
 Messages lets you communicate with others using different types of computers. FaceTime 
only works with Apple products, so if someone doesn’t have an Apple product capable of 
using FaceTime, you won’t be able to chat using FaceTime. 
 With both Messages and FaceTime, you can communicate with anyone around the world 
absolutely free just as long as both of you have an Internet connection.

 Chapter 20  
 Using iCloud 
 In the old days, every computer was an island. Anything you created on one computer would 
have to be copied and moved to another computer. If you forget to copy a file from your 
desktop to your laptop, you might travel to another city only to realize that you’re missing 
several crucial files. 
 Fortunately, there’s a better solution. Rather than try to keep your files synchronized on 
multiple computers, you can just use iCloud. The main idea behind iCloud is that you have 
storage space on the Internet, otherwise known as the “cloud.” 
 The  advantage of iCloud  is that you’ll always be able to access your files on any device 
you wish as long as you have Internet access. The disadvantage is that if you  happen   to be 
somewhere without Internet access, you won’t be able to access your files. 
 Since Internet access is so readily available in many places, using iCloud can help you keep 
track of your files in one place so that you’ll never be without them again. 
 Setting Up an iCloud Account 
 To use iCloud, you must create  an  Apple ID and then turn on iCloud for your Mac. Initially, 
Apple gives you 5GB of storage space, but you can buy more storage space if you wish. 
 Once you turn on iCloud, you can choose various options for choosing which programs can 
store data on and retrieve data from iCloud. 
 To set up an iCloud account, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple menu to display a pull-down menu.  
 2. 
 Choose System Preferences. The System Preferences window 
appears.  
 3. 
 Click the iCloud icon. The iCloud window appears, as shown in 
Figure  20-1 . 

368
CHAPTER 20: Using iCloud
 4. 
 Make sure that the iCloud Drive check box is selected.  
 5. 
 Select or clear the check boxes to the left of each program. If a check 
box is clear, then that program won’t be able to share data with other 
devices—such as an iPhone or iPad—that you may also own.  
 Once you have set up iCloud Drive, you can access it through the Finder as if it were just 
another drive physically attached to your Mac. To make the iCloud Drive appear in the 
Finder, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window opens.  
 2. 
 Click the Finder menu and choose Preferences. The Preferences 
window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Sidebar icon. A list of items that can appear in the left 
sidebar pane of the Finder appears, as shown in Figure  20-2 . 
 Figure 20-1.   The iCloud window lets you define which programs can access iCloud 
 

369
CHAPTER 20: Using iCloud
 4. 
 Select the iCloud Drive check box. The iCloud Drive icon now appears 
in the left sidebar pane of the Finder window. Now you can copy and 
paste files from your Mac to your iCloud Drive (and vice versa).  
 Moving Files to and from iCloud 
 When you drag and  drop  a file in the Finder, you either copy or move a file. If you drag and 
drop a file on the same drive, dragging and dropping moves the file. 
 If you drag and drop a file from one drive to another (such as from a flash drive to a hard 
drive), dragging and dropping copies a file. So when you drag and drop a file to or from 
iCloud, you’re moving a file from one location to another. 
 Since moving a file from iCloud keeps any other device from accessing that file, the Finder 
displays a warning dialog, as shown in Figure  20-3 . 
 Figure 20-2.   Selecting the iCloud Drive check box makes the iCloud Drive visible in the Finder 
 Figure 20-3.   A warning dialog appears to let you know the consequences of moving a file off iCloud 
 
 

370
CHAPTER 20: Using iCloud
 If you’re sure that you no longer want that file to be accessible over the Internet, click the 
Move button. Otherwise, click the Cancel button to keep the file on iCloud. 
 One way to use iCloud is to store critical files there. If anything happens to your computers, 
your files are always safe. However, if you store multiple files or large files, storing files on 
iCloud can get expensive because you may need to pay for extra storage space. 
 A second way to use iCloud is to temporarily store files that you need to access on different 
devices. When you’re sure that you won’t need to use these files any more, move them from 
iCloud to conserve space. 
 Accessing iCloud from a Browser 
 You can access  iCloud from   the Finder (as long as you have an Internet connection) or you 
can access iCloud through a browser, such as Safari. Accessing iCloud through the Finder 
makes it easy to move files from a Mac to iCloud. Accessing iCloud through a browser is 
handy when you’re using a different computer, such as a Windows or Linux PC. 
 When you access iCloud through a browser, you can create and delete folders to organize 
your files. You can also delete or rename files, or upload new files. When you need to access 
your iCloud files without a Mac, you can do it through any computer with a browser and an 
Internet connection. 
 To access iCloud through a browser, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open a browser on any computer and visit    www.icloud.com   . 
The iCloud web site appears.  
 2. 
 Type your Apple ID and password. The iCloud web site displays 
program icons that you can access over the Internet, such as Pages 
or Photos, as shown in Figure  20-4 . 
 Note  Apple only gives you 5GB of free storage, so if you need more storage, you’ll have to pay 
extra for it. 

371
CHAPTER 20: Using iCloud
 3. 
 Click the iCloud Drive icon. The iCloud web site now displays the 
contents of your iCloud.  
 Once you access your iCloud Drive from your browser, you can create new folders, upload 
new files, download files, or delete files and folders, as shown in Figure  20-5 . 
 Figure 20-4.   The iCloud web site displays the iCloud Drive icon 
 Figure 20-5.   iCloud Drive lets you modify files and folders 
 Using iWork for iCloud 
 Accessing  iCloud from any   browser gives you access to your files on any computer. 
However, what if you want to edit a file stored on iCloud? 
 One solution is to download the file from iCloud to your computer, modify that file, and 
then upload the modified version back to iCloud. While this can work, it’s clumsy and risks 
creating multiple versions of the same file stored in different locations (one copy on iCloud 
and another copy stored on your computer). 
 To solve this problem, you can use Apple’s office suite, called iWork, directly on iCloud. 
This lets you modify files on iCloud directly. 
 
 

372
CHAPTER 20: Using iCloud
 The three iWork programs are Pages (a word processor), Numbers (a spreadsheet), and 
Keynote (a presentation program). Best of all, Pages can import and export Microsoft Word 
documents, Numbers can import and export Microsoft Excel files, and Keynote can import 
and export Microsoft PowerPoint files. By using iWork, you can share common office files 
with other people, even if they’re not using a Mac. 
 By using iWork in your browser, you can use a full office suite on any computer, whether 
you’re using a Mac, a Windows PC, or an Android tablet. This lets you edit and create files 
on any computer that has a browser and an Internet connection. 
 There are several ways to access the iWork programs with a browser. If you access the iCloud 
web site, you can click a program icon, such as Pages, Numbers, or Keynote (see Figure  20-4 ). 
 If you have already opened your iCloud Drive, you can click a program icon by clicking the 
iCloud Drive label in the upper-left corner of the iCloud Drive window. This displays a menu that 
shows different program icons, such as Pages, Numbers, or Keynote, as shown in Figure  20-6 .  
 Figure 20-6.    Accessing the iWork program icons within iCloud Drive 
 Figure 20-7.   The user interface of iWork programs on the Mac look slightly different from iWork programs on iCloud 
 If you already have iWork files stored in iCloud Drive, you can also open Pages, Numbers, or 
Keynote by clicking an iWork file. 
 Although iWork for iCloud looks and works like the iWork programs on the Mac, there are 
some minor differences. First, iWork programs on the Mac display pull-down menus at the 
top of the screen, whereas iWork for iCloud displays icons that let you access most (but not 
all) of the features found on iWork on the Mac, as shown in Figure  20-7 . 
 
 

373
CHAPTER 20: Using iCloud
 The iWork user interface on iCloud is much simpler than the iWork user interface on the Mac. 
As a result, iWork for iCloud is meant for performing common tasks, whereas iWork on the 
Mac offers more sophisticated features, such as creating a table of contents automatically in 
a word processor document. 
 Because of its simplified user interface, iWork for iCloud forces you to click icons to access 
commands instead of using pull-down menus. To help you identify the purpose of each icon, 
just move the mouse pointer over an icon, and after a few seconds, a brief explanation of 
that icon’s function appears, as shown in Figure  20-8 . 
 Figure 20-8.   You can identify the purpose of icons by moving the mouse pointer over that icon 
 Opening a File in iWork for iCloud 
 To open an iWork  file   stored on iCloud, you must first double-click the appropriate program 
icon (such as clicking the Pages, Numbers, or Keynote icon). As soon as you load an iWork 
for iCloud program, a list of files stored on iCloud appears, as shown in Figure  20-9 . 
 Figure 20-9.   You can identify the purpose of icons by moving the mouse pointer over that icon 
 
 

374
CHAPTER 20: Using iCloud
 Just click the file that you want to open, or click the Create Document icon that displays a 
plus sign (+) in the middle. As soon as you choose a file to open, you can start editing that 
file within iWork for iCloud.  
 Downloading Online Files 
 When you create files  using iWork for iCloud, your files are saved on iCloud. If you want a 
copy of the file on your own computer, you need to download a copy of that file. 
 To download a file from iWork for iCloud to your Mac, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open an iWork for iCloud file, such as Pages or Keynote.  
 2. 
 Click the Tools icon (it looks like a wrench) in the upper-right corner 
of the screen, as shown in Figure  20-10 . 
 Figure 20-10.    The Tools icon 
 3. 
 Choose Download a Copy. A dialog asks you to choose a file 
format, as shown in Figure  20-11 . Depending on whether you’re 
using Pages, Numbers, or Keynote, these file format options will be 
different.  
 

375
CHAPTER 20: Using iCloud
 4. 
 Click a file format. Your file appears on your Mac.  
 Collaborating Online 
 One unique feature  that   iWork for iCloud offers is the ability to share and collaborate on files 
over the Internet. When you share an iCloud file, you have two options. 
 First, you can let another person view the file but not edit it. Second, you can let another 
person edit the file using iWork for iCloud. 
 To send someone a link to an iCloud file, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open an iWork for iCloud file, such as Pages or Keynote.  
 2. 
 Click the Share icon, as shown in Figure  20-12 . A dialog asks how 
you want to share the file, as shown in Figure  20-13 .

 5. 
 (Optional) Click Email Link. This lets you send an e-mail directly from 
your iCloud e-mail account, if you have set up one. Otherwise, you 
can copy the link and paste it into an e-mail message using another 
program, such as Mail.  
 6. 
 Click Close.  
 When you share a link to an iCloud file, the Share icon changes into a Collaboration icon that 
looks like a person’s silhouette, as shown in Figure  20-15 . 
 Figure 20-15.   The Collaboration icon replaces the Share icon to let you know when you’ve shared a file 
 To stop sharing an iCloud file, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the iWork for iCloud file that you shared previously.  
 2. 
 Click the Collaboration icon. A pop-up menu appears 
(see Figure  20-15 ). 
 3. 
 Click Settings. A dialog appears, displaying the link to your iCloud file 
(see Figure  20-14 ). 
 4. 
 Click Stop Sharing.  
 Exiting from iCloud 
 When you’re done  using  iCloud, you need to sign out. Signing out closes your iCloud 
session. If you fail to sign out, it’s possible that someone else could get on your Mac and 
visit your browser history to access your iCloud files. 
 To sign out from iCloud, click your name in the upper-right corner. When a menu appears, 
choose Sign Out, as shown in Figure  20-16 . 
 

378
CHAPTER 20: Using iCloud
 Summary 
 If you have a reliable Internet connection, you can take advantage of iCloud. Apple gives you 
free 5GB of storage, but you can purchase more if you need it. 
 With iCloud, you can store crucial files that you can access on any Apple device, including a 
Mac, an iPhone, or an iPad. If you occasionally use a non-Apple device such, as an Android 
tablet or a Windows PC, you can still access your files on iCloud. (Just be aware that you 
may need to convert files to a format that another computer can recognize.) 
 If you want to modify iCloud files without copying them to your own computer, you can use 
iWork for iCloud, which lets you use Pages, Numbers, or Keynote to create or edit files. Best 
of all, you can use iWork for iCloud using any computer, such as a Windows or Linux PC, 
just as long as you have an Internet connection. 
 Think of iCloud as an extension of your computer. You can store files online, share files with 
others, and even create and edit files online, whether you have a Mac or another type of 
computer. By using iCloud, your Mac becomes even more versatile.  
 Figure 20-16.   The Sign Out option appears on a menu that appears when you click your name

 Getting Work Done 
 No matter how much you may like playing with your Macintosh, eventually you may need 
to get some work done. Fortunately, using a Macintosh doesn’t have to be drudgery. In fact, 
you may find that working on a Macintosh can make any work-related task easier and even 
more enjoyable. 
 To help you keep track of important people in your life, you can use the Contacts program 
so that you never lose track of someone’s phone number or e-mail address again. 
 To help you keep track of random thoughts and ideas, you can use the simple Notes 
program that lets you organize related ideas in folders for quick access. If you need constant 
reminders of something, you can create electronic sticky notes that you can paste on your 
screen so you’ll always see them. 
 If you receive important forms or documents stored as PDF files, you can fill them in without 
printing them out, and even add your own signature to an electronic form. 
 More importantly, you can synchronize data between a Macintosh and an iPhone or iPad; 
that way, you can access your crucial information whenever you need it.

 Chapter 21  
 Keeping Track of Contacts 
 Everyone needs to keep track of people, whether for business or for personal reasons. After 
all, you probably don’t want to memorize someone’s street address or e-mail address. 
 In the past, people stored contact information in Rolodex files or black books. To make it 
easier to store names, addresses, and other information about people, OS X comes with a 
simple database called Contacts. 
 The advantage of using Contacts is that you can search for specific names, you can group 
names in categories, and then contact people directly through FaceTime or Messages. If you 
have an iPhone or an iPad, you can share and synchronize contact information between your 
Mac and iPhone or iPad using iCloud (see Chapter   20 ) so that you always have the latest 
contact information at all times. 
 Storing Data 
 The Contacts program  lets you store a name and additional information, such as e-mail 
address, phone number, or street address. For some people, you might only store a name 
and street address. For others, you might store a name, street address, e-mail address, 
Twitter name, web site address, and anything else that provides a way to contact that person. 
 The Contacts program acts like an electronic version of a Rolodex file, storing the name 
of one person on a card or window. Unlike physical Rolodex cards, a Contacts card can 
contain as much or as little information as you like. 
 To store a name and additional contact information in the Contacts program, follow these 
steps:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts program in the Applications folder.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Card (File ➤ New Card) or press 
Command+N. A new blank card appears, as shown in Figure  21-1 .

 Click the Add Photo circle to add the person’s photo or an image that 
reminds you of that person, as shown in Figure  21-2 . You can choose 
to add a picture from a list of different images, from your iCloud Photos 
account, from the Faces category in Photos, or from your Mac’s camera.

 Searching for a Name 
 The  Contacts program   lists names alphabetically by last name. When you have a small 
number of stored names, you can easily find a name just by scrolling through the name list. 
However, once you start storing large numbers of names, scrolling through the alphabetic list 
can get cumbersome. 
 

385
CHAPTER 21: Keeping Track of Contacts
 That’s why Contacts provides a search field. Just like searching on the Internet with a search 
engine, the search field lets you type part or all of the information that you want to find, such 
as part of a person’s last name, telephone number, e-mail address, or street address. Just as 
long as you know some bit of information about someone, and that information is stored in 
the Contacts program, you’ll be able to search and find it. 
 To search for a name in the Contacts program, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts program.  
 2. 
 Click in the search field that appears in the upper-left corner of the 
Contacts window.  
 3. 
 Type whatever contact information you recall, such as the city where 
the person lives or their mobile phone number, and press Return. The 
Contacts program only lists names matching your criteria.  
 4. 
 Click the close icon (it looks like an X in a circle) that appears to 
the right of the search field to clear it and display all names in the 
Contacts program once more.  
 Grouping Names 
 The  Contacts program  organizes people alphabetically by last name. While this can help you 
find a particular person if you know their last name, it’s not the most convenient way to find 
everyone or groups of people; for example, the names of co-workers or people associated 
with a particular group, such as your daughter’s Girl Scouts organization. The Contacts 
program normally sorts all of these people in alphabetical order, but you can create groups. 
 A group is simply a subset of names that are related based on your own criteria. You can 
add or remove names to a group at any time, and names can appear in more than one group 
if you wish. There are three ways to do this:
 Create a group and then copy names into it  
 Select the names that you want to put in a group and then create a 
group that contains only those names  
 Create a smart group that automatically adds names to it  
 Creating a Group 
 The most straightforward  way to create a group is to define it with a descriptive name and 
then copy names into that group. To create a group, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts program.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Group (File ➤ New Group). 
An untitled group appears in the left pane of the Contacts window, as 
shown in Figure  21-5 . 

386
CHAPTER 21: Keeping Track of Contacts
 3. 
 Type a descriptive name for your group and press Return. The 
Contacts program creates a new group that’s initially empty.  
 4. 
 In the left pane, click All Contacts. This displays all names stored in 
the Contacts program.  
 5. 
 Move the pointer over a name. Then drag and drop that name on the 
group name in the left pane to add it to the group, as shown in 
Figure  21-6 . 
 Note  You can place the same name in more than one group. 
 Figure 21-5.   Group names appear in the left pane 
 Figure 21-6.   To store a name in a group, drag and drop it on a group name 
 
 

387
CHAPTER 21: Keeping Track of Contacts
 Selecting Names to Put in a Group 
 Creating groups and then  dragging names   into that group can be tedious. To store names in 
groups more quickly, select multiple names and then tell the Contacts program to create a 
new group that includes all the names that you’ve selected. 
 To select multiple names and automatically store them in a group, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts program.  
 2. 
 In the left pane, click All Contacts to view all the names stored in the 
Contacts program.  
 3. 
 Hold down the Command key and click each name that you want to 
store in a group.  
 4. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Group From Selection 
(File ➤ New Group From Selection). Your chosen names 
automatically appear in a group that appears in the left pane, as 
shown in Figure  21-7 . 
 Figure 21-7.   Contacts creates a generic group that automatically includes the names you selected 
 5. 
 Type a descriptive name for your group and press Return.  
 Creating a Smart Group 
 There’s one problem  with   creating a group and manually selecting the names to appear in 
that group. Each time you add a new name to the Contacts program, you need to decide 
whether that name belongs in one of your existing groups. If you forget to do this, your 
groups won’t contain all the right names. 
 That’s the purpose of smart groups. Smart groups use criteria that you define to determine 
which names should automatically appear in a group, such as names with certain e-mail 
addresses or company names. 
 

388
CHAPTER 21: Keeping Track of Contacts
 To create a smart group, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts program.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Smart Group (File ➤ New Smart 
Group). The Contacts program displays a window in which you can 
define criteria for adding names automatically, as shown in Figure  21-8 .  
 Figure 21-8.   Defining criteria for a smart group in the Contacts program 
 Figure 21-9.   Choosing criteria to define a smart group 
 3. 
 Type a descriptive name for your smart group in the Smart Group 
Name text field.  
 4. 
 Click in the first pop-up menu and choose an option, such as Card, 
Company, or Department, as shown in Figure  21-9 . 
 
 

389
CHAPTER 21: Keeping Track of Contacts
 5. 
 Click in the second pop-up menu and choose an option, such as 
“contains” or “is member of” (see Figure  21-10 ). Depending on the 
option you chose in step 4, the options listed in the second pop-up 
menu may be different.  
 Figure 21-10.   Specifying the details of an option 
 6. 
 Click in the text field and type text to complete your criteria. For 
example, your criteria might list “Card contains Acme Corporation,” 
which means any new name that you add to the Contacts program 
that includes the Acme Corporation is automatically included in the 
smart group.  
 7. 
 (Optional) Click the plus (+) button on the far right to define an 
additional rule. If you click the minus (–) button, you can delete any 
rules you may have created.  
 8. 
 Click the OK button. Your smart group appears in the left pane under 
the Smart Group category, as shown in Figure  21-11 . 
 

390
CHAPTER 21: Keeping Track of Contacts
 Renaming a Group 
 Once you’ve created a group,  you  can always rename it later. The only exception is that you 
cannot rename the All Contacts group. To rename a group, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts program.  
 2. 
 In the left pane, click the group that you want to rename.  
 3. 
 Click the Edit menu and choose Rename Group (Edit ➤ Rename 
Group). Your chosen group name appears highlighted.  
 4. 
 Type or edit a new name and press Return when you’re done.  
 Figure 21-11.   Smart groups appear under the Smart Group category to easily identify them from other groups 
 

391
CHAPTER 21: Keeping Track of Contacts
 Removing Names from a Group 
 If you created an  ordinary  group (not a smart group), you can remove names from a group. 
When you remove a name, you have two options. 
 First, you can completely delete the name from your Contacts program. Second, you can 
simply remove the name from a group but keep it saved in your Contacts program. 
 To remove a name from a group, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts program.  
 2. 
 In the left pane, click the group that contains a name that you want 
to remove. A list of names in that group appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Edit menu and choose Remove From Group 
(Edit ➤ Remove From Group).  
 Deleting a Group 
 Eventually you may want to  delete  a group. When you delete a group, you do not delete the 
names that appeared inside it. Any names that appear in the group that you want to delete 
also appears in the All Contacts group. 
 To delete a group, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts program.  
 2. 
 In the left pane, click the group that you want to delete.  
  3.   Click the Edit menu and choose Delete Group (Edit ➤ Delete Group). 
A message asks if you’re sure that you want to delete the group.  
 4. 
 Click the Delete button (or Cancel if you don’t want to delete the 
group). 
 Deleting Names 
 Although it’s easy to add  names  , eventually you may want to delete names. You can delete 
names from the All Contacts group or from within another group you created. 
 When you delete a name from a group you’ve created, you have a choice of deleting the 
name completely or just removing the name from the group. 
 Note   You cannot delete the All Contacts group. 

392
CHAPTER 21: Keeping Track of Contacts
 To delete a name, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts program.  
 2. 
 In the left pane, click the group that contains a name you want to 
remove. If you click the All Contacts group name, you’ll completely 
delete the name from the Contacts program.  
 3. 
 Click the Edit menu and choose Delete Card (Edit ➤ Delete Card). 
A message asks if you’re sure that you want to delete the name.  
 4. 
 Click the Delete button (or Cancel if you don’t want to delete the 
group).  
 Merging Names 
 Trying to keep track of  so many names can be difficult, which means you may accidentally 
enter the same person’s name in twice. To avoid storing duplicate information, the Contacts 
program finds duplicate names and merges the information. 
 To merge duplicate names, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts program.  
 2. 
 Click the Card menu and choose Look for Duplicates (Card ➤ Look 
for Duplicates). If the Contacts program finds any duplicate names, 
a dialog asks if you want to merge the entries together, as shown in 
Figure  21-12 . 
 Figure 21-12.    You can find and merge duplicate names 
 3. 
 Click the Merge button  
 

393
CHAPTER 21: Keeping Track of Contacts
 Sharing Contact Information 
 If you want to share contact  information  with others, you can save it as one of the following 
types of files:
 Contacts Archive: This file can only be read by someone using the 
Contacts program on another Mac.  
 vCard: A standard format for storing contact information. Use the vCard 
format when you need to share contact information with people using 
other programs.  
 PDF: Data stored as a Portable Document Format file. The receiver of 
this file needs to copy this data and paste it into another program if they 
wish to use it.  
 To share contact information, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts program.  
 2. 
 Click the name that you want to share.  
 3. 
 Do one of the following:
 a.  Click the File menu and choose Export as PDF (File ➤ 
Export as PDF).  
 b.  Click the File menu, choose Export, and then choose Export 
vCard or Contacts Archive.  
 Summary 
 The Contacts program is especially handy if you use iCloud and have an iPhone. You can 
synchronize your contact list between both your iPhone and your Mac. Even if you’re just 
using a Mac, the Contacts program is a convenient place to store the names and contact 
information of family members, friends, and business associates. 
 To help you organize your list of names, you can create groups. You can manually add 
names to a group or create a smart group that does this for you automatically based on 
criteria that you define. 
 The Contacts program is nothing more than a simple database for helping you keep track of 
the people in your life who are most important to you.

 Chapter 22  
 Using Notes, Stickies, and 
the Calendar 
 One way to keep track of random information is to write it down on sticky notes and stick 
them on the side of your monitor. Another way is to have a calendar on your desk where 
you can easily jot down important appointments. Yet another way is to jot down ideas on 
napkins, envelopes, or other random pieces of paper and stack them in a pile on your desk. 
 While such paper solutions may work, they can be clumsy and messy. A far better solution is 
to store everything electronically on your Mac using one or more of the following programs:
 Notes: A simple word processor for jotting down quick thoughts and 
ideas.  
 Stickies: An electronic version of sticky notes that appear on your 
screen so that you can’t miss them.  
 Calendar: An electronic calendar that keeps track of important dates 
and appointments.  
 By using any of these three programs by themselves or together, you can keep track of 
important information that you need to save and find at a glance. 
 Jotting Down Notes 
 You can use a word processor  like  Pages to capture ideas, but it often offers more features 
than you need, such as formatting or a table of contents. With the Notes program, you can 
create brief amounts of text that you can quickly browse. 
 Unlike a word processor, the Notes program stores all your notes together so you can easily 
find them. To organize your notes, the Notes program window displays three panes, as 
shown in Figure  22-1 . 

396
CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 The left pane displays folders. Each folder can store any number of notes. 
 The middle pane displays one or more note titles. The first sentence you type in your note 
becomes its title, so type a descriptive title to help you identify a note’s contents. 
 The right pane displays the actual contents of each note. This right pane is where you can 
view and edit text stored in a note.  
 Creating a New Note 
 To create a new note,  follow  these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Notes program in the Applications folder. The Notes 
window appears (see Figure  22-1 ). 
 2. 
 Click the folder where you want to store your note.  
 3. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Note, or press Command+N. 
The middle pane displays your new note.  
 4. 
 Click in the right pane and type your text. Notice that as you type, 
the Notes program uses the first sentence to define the title of the 
note, as shown in Figure  22-2 .  
 Figure 22-1.    The Notes window consists of three panes 
 

397
CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 Creating a New Folder 
 If you just have a handful of  notes , you can easily find the one you want. However, once you 
start collecting large numbers of notes, you may want to organize related notes in a group. 
By creating multiple groups, you can keep your notes separated into different categories to 
easily find them again. 
 To create a folder, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Notes program.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Folder (File ➤ New Folder). 
The new folder appears in the left pane, as shown in Figure  22-3 . 
 Figure 22-2.   The first sentence you type becomes the note’s title 
 

398
CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 3. 
 Type a descriptive name for your folder and press Return.  
 Searching for a Note 
 When you’ve  created   multiple notes, you can search for them manually. However, it’s faster 
and more accurate to search by entering a word or phrase that appears within a note. 
 To making searching for a note more accurate, use keywords in certain types of notes. For 
example, for work-related notes, add your company name or project name. For personal 
notes, type in a topic such as “dieting” or “real estate”. If you do this consistently with all 
notes, then searching for your keywords can help you find your notes quickly. 
 To search for a note, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Notes program.  
 2. 
 Click in the Search field that appears in the upper-right corner of the 
Notes window.  
 3. 
 Type part or all of a word or phrase that is contained in the note 
you want to find. A list of all notes that contain your search criteria 
appears. The search criteria is highlighted in the text, as shown in 
Figure  22-4 . 
 Figure 22-3.   A new folder appears in the left pane of the Notes window 
 

399
CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 4. 
 Click the close icon (the X in the gray circle) that appears in the right 
of the Search field to clear it and view all of your notes once more.  
 Sharing Notes 
 Once you’ve created a note,   you may want to share it with others. The simplest way to 
share a note is to copy the text in the Notes program and paste it in another program, such 
as an e-mail message. Notes lets you share a note in several ways, including as an e-mail 
message, as a text message in the Messages program, or as a note in Twitter, LinkedIn, or 
Facebook. 
 To share a note, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Notes program.  
 2. 
 Click the note that you want to share.  
 3. 
 Click the File menu and choose Share (File ➤ Share). A pop-up menu 
of ways to share the note appears, as shown in Figure  22-5 . (You can 
also click the Share icon.)  
 Figure 22-4.   Notes highlights the search criteria in each note that matches 
 

400
CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 4. 
 Choose the way that you want to share your note. Each method of 
sharing works slightly differently. It helps to be familiar with each 
method, such as Twitter or Messages, to share a note successfully.  
 Renaming a Folder 
 A folder’s name should be  descriptive  . If you don’t like the name you initially gave a folder, 
you can always change it later. (The only folder than you cannot rename is the Notes folder.) 
To rename a folder, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Notes program.  
 2. 
 In the left pane, right-click the group that you want to rename. 
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure  22-6 . 
 Figure 22-5.   Choosing how to share a note 
 

401
CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 3. 
 Choose Rename Folder. The current folder name appears selected.  
 4. 
 Edit the existing folder name or type a new folder name and press 
Return when you’re done.  
 Deleting Folders and Notes 
 Notes are often temporarily,   which means that you’ll eventually want to delete a note. You 
can delete notes individually or delete an entire folder of notes. 
 To delete an individual note, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Notes program.  
 2. 
 Click the note that you want to delete.  
 3. 
 Click the Edit menu and choose Delete (Edit ➤ Delete). Your chosen 
note disappears.  
 Note  If you delete a note by mistake, just click the Edit menu and choose Undo (Edit ➤ Undo) or press 
Command+Z. This Undo command only works if you choose it immediately after deleting the note. 
 Figure 22-6.   Renaming a folder 
 

402
CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 To delete an entire folder, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Notes program.  
 2. 
 Click the folder you want to delete.  
 3. 
 Click the Edit menu and choose Delete (Edit ➤ Delete). A warning 
appears to let you know that deleting a folder will also delete all 
notes stored in that folder, as shown in Figure  22-7 . Remember, you 
cannot delete the Notes folder because it contains all notes stored in 
the program.  
 Figure 22-7.   A warning message appears when you try to delete a folder 
 4. 
 Click the Delete Folder button.  
 Note   When you delete notes, the Notes program actually retains deleted notes for up to 30 days. 
To see deleted notes, click the Recently Deleted group in the left pane of the Notes program, as 
shown in Figure  22-8 . 
 

403
CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 Using Stickies 
 The Notes program is a handy  place  to capture ideas and thoughts; you always know where 
to find them. Another way to capture your ideas is to use the Stickies program. 
 The main difference between the Notes program and the Stickies program is that the Notes 
program lets you organize notes into folders but the Stickies program lets you display a 
Stickies window on the screen at all times to mimic pasting a paper sticky note on the front 
of your computer screen. 
 Because the Stickies program displays miniature windows all over the screen, it’s meant to 
store a handful of Stickies windows. If you store too many sticky notes, they will eventually 
clutter the screen.  
 Creating a Sticky Note 
 To type text into  the   Stickies program, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Stickies program.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Note (File ➤ New Note). The 
Stickies program creates a new Stickies window, as shown in 
Figure  22-9 . 
 Figure 22-8.   The Notes program stores deleted notes for up to 30 days 
 

404
CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 3. 
 Type any text you wish into the Stickies window.  
 Once you’ve created a sticky note, you can move or resize it on the screen to make it easier 
to see. To move a sticky note, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Stickies program.  
 2. 
 Move the pointer over the horizontal bar at the top of the Stickies 
window, as shown in Figure  22-10 . 
 Figure 22-9.    A new Stickies note 
 Figure 22-10.    A new Stickies note 
 3. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or press a finger on the trackpad) 
and move the mouse or slide your finger on the trackpad to move the 
Stickies window on the screen.  
 
 

405
CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 Another way to make sticky notes easier to see is to resize them. Just like resizing any 
window on the screen, you can resize a Stickies window by moving the pointer over the 
edge or corner of a Stickies window until the pointer turns into a two-way pointing arrow. 
 Then drag the mouse or trackpad to resize the window. If you move the pointer to a corner of 
a Stickies window, you can resize both the width and height of the window at the same time.  
 Making a Sticky Note Easy to See 
 Whenever you start the  Stickies  program, all of your sticky notes appear on the screen. 
That’s why the Stickies program is best for storing a small number of notes: because too 
many notes just clutters the screen. 
 Moving and resizing sticky notes keeps them organized on your screen, but the Stickies 
program offers two additional ways to make sticky notes easier to see. 
 First, you can turn a sticky note into a floating window. Normally, if you switch to a different 
program, all of your Stickies windows are hidden underneath other program windows. 
A floating window means that a Stickies window always appears on the screen, even if you 
switch to another program. This mimics slapping a physical sticky note on your screen. 
 Second, you can change the color of a sticky note. By using different colors for different 
topics, you can make it easy to find a particular sticky note. 
 To turn a sticky note into a floating window, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Stickies program.  
 2. 
 Click the sticky note that you want to turn into a floating window.  
 3. 
 Click the Note menu and choose floating Window (Note ➤ Floating 
Window). Your chosen Stickies window now appears on the screen 
at all times unless you exit out of the Stickies program.  
 To change the color of a sticky note, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Stickies program.  
 2. 
 Click the sticky note that you want to change to a different color.  
 3. 
 Click the Color menu and choose a color, as shown in Figure  22-11 . 
 Note   Repeat the preceding steps to turn off a floating window so that it doesn’t always appear on 
the screen. 

406
CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 Importing and Exporting Text into a Sticky Note 
 Normally, you just type text into  a   sticky note. However, if you have text stored in an ordinary 
text file (not a word processor file, such as a Pages or Microsoft Word file), you can import 
that text file onto a sticky note. 
 Since Stickies windows are fairly small, you don’t want to import large amounts of text, but 
importing a small text file lets you display important information on a sticky note. 
 To import text onto a sticky note, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Stickies program.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose Import Text (File ➤ Import Text). An 
Open dialog appears.  
 3. 
 Click the text file that contains text you want to display on a sticky 
note and click the Open button. The Stickies program creates a new 
sticky note with the contents of your chosen text file.  
 If you’ve created an important sticky note, you can save it as a text file. When you export a 
sticky note, you can save the text as plain text with no formatting, or as Rich Text Format 
(RTF), which preserves formatting. 
 To export text from a sticky note, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Stickies program.  
 2. 
 Click the sticky note that contains the text that you want to save.  
 3. 
 Click the File menu and choose Export Text (File ➤ Export Text). An 
Export dialog appears, as shown in Figure  22-12 . 
 Figure 22-11.   The Color menu lets you choose a different sticky note background color 
 

407
CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 4. 
 Type a descriptive name for your file in the Save As text field.  
 5. 
 Click the Where pop-up menu and choose a folder to store your file.  
 6. 
 Click in the Format pop-up menu and choose a file format, such as 
Plain Text or RTF (Rich Text Format), which retains any formatting in 
your text.  
 7. 
 Click the Save button.  
 Deleting a Sticky Note 
 No matter  how   useful a sticky note might be, eventually you’ll want to get rid of it. To delete 
a sticky note, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Stickies program.  
 2. 
 Click the sticky note that you want to delete.  
 3. 
 Click the close icon in the upper-left corner of the sticky note, as 
shown in Figure  22-13 . A warning dialog appears to let you know 
that if you delete a sticky note, you’ll lose the contents of that note.  
 Figure 22-12.   The Export dialog lets you define a file name, a location, and a file format 
 

408
CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 4. 
 Click the Don’t Save button. (If you click the Save button, you have 
the opportunity to export your sticky note text to a file.)  
 Using the Calendar 
 The Calendar program helps you keep track of appointments on a particular date. You 
can look at your calendar from a yearly, monthly, weekly, or daily view. You can spot 
appointments far in advance, or check your daily schedule to see your appointments and 
how long they should take. 
 Changing the Calendar View 
 With a paper calendar, you’re  stuck  with viewing a monthly, a weekly, or a daily view. With 
the Calendar program, you can switch views any time by choosing one of the following (also 
see Figure  22-14 ):
 Year: View ➤ By Year; press Command+4; or click the Year icon.  
 Month: View ➤ By Month; press Command+3; or click the Month icon.  
 Week: View ➤ By Week; press Command+2; or click the Week icon.  
 Day: View ➤ By Day; press Command+1; or click the Day icon.

CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 Setting an Appointment 
 No matter which  calendar view  you choose, you can create an appointment, also known as 
an  event , for a particular date. To create an appointment, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Calendar program.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose New Event (File ➤ New Event), press 
Command+N, or click the plus sign (+) icon in the upper-left corner 
of the Calendar window. A Create Quick Event window appears, as

CHAPTER 22: Using Notes, Stickies, and the Calendar 
 Summary 
 When you have fleeting thoughts that you want to capture, store them in the Notes or 
Stickies programs. The Notes program is useful for storing large numbers of ideas that you 
can organize into related groups. 
 The Stickies program is useful for storing a small number of brief ideas that you can also 
keep floating on the screen so that they’re always visible, like a real sticky note. 
 You can use the Calendar program to keep track of your schedule and plan your day, week, 
month, or year. 
 By using the Notes, Stickies, and Calendar programs, you can turn your Mac into an 
electronic desk organizer. You’ll always have all the information you need at your fingertips 
just as long as you have your Mac.  
 Note   If you accidentally delete an appointment, you can retrieve it by immediately choosing the 
Edit ➤ Undo command or by pressing Command+Z.

 Chapter 23  
 Modifying PDF Files 
 Many businesses and government agencies store crucial forms and documents as PDF 
(Portable Document Format) files because anyone can open and view a PDF file on nearly 
any type of computer. Best of all, PDF files retain all formatting, so you can print a form, fill it 
out by hand, and mail it. 
 Although printing a PDF form and filling it out by hand is one way to use a PDF file, another 
way is to modify it directly. By doing so, you can type or add comments into a PDF file. For 
example, let’s suppose that someone sent you a PDF file to review. You could type your 
comments directly in the form and send the modified PDF file back to the other person. 
 In the past, you needed to buy expensive software to modify PDF files, but OS X comes with 
a free program called Preview that can modify PDF files. By using the Preview program, you 
can both view and modify PDF files. 
 Rearranging Pages 
 Most PDF files have multiple pages. With the  Preview program  , you can rearrange the order 
of the pages, delete pages, or insert a PDF file within the pages of another PDF file. 
 To rearrange the pages of a PDF file, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Preview program.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose Open (File ➤ Open). Choose the PDF 
file whose pages you want to rearrange.  
 3. 
 Click the View menu and choose Thumbnails (View ➤ Thumbnails) so 
that a check mark appears to the left of the Thumbnails command. 
The Preview window displays thumbnail images of each page in the 
PDF file, as shown in Figure  23-1 . 

414
CHAPTER 23: Modifying PDF Files
 Figure 23-1.   Thumbnails of pages appear in the left pane of the Preview window 
 

415
CHAPTER 23: Modifying PDF Files
 4. 
 Move the pointer over a thumbnail image of a page and drag it up or 
down to a new position so that the existing thumbnail pages make 
room for it.  
 5. 
 Release the left mouse button or trackpad when the thumbnail page 
is in the location that you want.  
 6. 
 Click the File menu and choose Save (File ➤ Save) to save the 
rearranged pages in the PDF file.  
 Adding Pages 
 It’s possible to add graphic images  or  even another PDF file inside an existing PDF file. To 
insert a graphic image or another PDF file, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Preview program and the PDF file that you want to modify.  
 2. 
 Make sure that thumbnail views appear in the left pane of the 
Preview window.  
 3. 
 Click a thumbnail page. Any graphic images or PDF files that you 
add now appear after this thumbnail page.  
 4. 
 Click the Edit menu, choose Insert, and choose Page from File 
(Edit ➤ Insert ➤ Page from File). A dialog appears.  
 5. 
 Click the PDF file or graphic image that you want to add to the 
currently open PDF file. Click the Open button. The graphic image or 
PDF file appears in the current PDF file.  
 6. 
 Click the File menu and choose Save (File ➤ Save) to save the added 
pages in the PDF file.  
 Deleting Pages 
 Besides adding new  pages  to a PDF file, you can also delete pages by following these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Preview program with the PDF file that you want to modify.  
 2. 
 Make sure that thumbnail views appear in the left pane of the 
Preview window.  
 3. 
 Click a thumbnail page. If you hold down the Command key, you can 
click to select more than one thumbnail page.  
 Note   If you choose Edit ➤ Insert ➤ Blank Page, you can insert a blank page in your PDF file. 

416
CHAPTER 23: Modifying PDF Files
 4. 
 Press the Delete button on the keyboard.  
  5.   Click the File menu and choose Save (File ➤ Save) to save the 
rearranged pages in the PDF file.  
 Marking Up Text 
 While you can’t  physically  edit the text or graphics stored in a PDF file, you can highlight 
text, such as changing the text background to yellow (to mimic highlighting with a yellow 
marker), underlining text, or striking through text. 
 To mark up text, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Preview program with the PDF file that you want to modify.  
 2. 
 Click the Tools menu and choose Annotate (Tools ➤ Annotate). 
A submenu appears, as shown in Figure  23-2 . 
 Note   If you accidentally delete a page, press Command+Z or click Edit ➤ Undo. 

417
CHAPTER 23: Modifying PDF Files
 3. 
 Choose one of the following:

418
CHAPTER 23: Modifying PDF Files
 5. 
 Click the File menu and choose Save (File ➤ Save) to save the 
modified pages in the PDF file.  
 Adding Text 
 Although you can’t edit  text displayed in a PDF file, you can add your own text and place it 
on a PDF file. This can be especially useful for filling out forms. 
 In the past, you would have to print a PDF file and fill it the blanks by hand. With the Preview 
program, you can type text inside of boxes and move those boxes over the appropriate 
places in a PDF file. This lets you fill out a form stored as a PDF file, including typing your 
name, address, or phone number. 
 To add text to a PDF file, follow these steps:
  1.   Open the Preview program with a PDF file that you want to modify.  
  2.   Click the Tools menu, choose Annotate, and then choose Text 
(Tools ➤ Annotate ➤ Text). A text box appears, as shown in 
Figure  23-4 . 
 Figure 23-3.   Three different ways to annotate text in a PDF file 
 Figure 23-4.    Adding a text box to a PDF file 
 
 

419
CHAPTER 23: Modifying PDF Files
  3.   Do one or more of the following to modify the text box:
 a.  Double-click inside the text box and type anything you want to appear on the 
PDF file, such as your name or the date.  
 b.  Move the pointer over the text box handle (little circles on the left and right 
edges of the text box) and drag the mouse to resize the text box.  
 c.  Move the pointer over the text box so that it turns into a hand pointer, and 
then drag the mouse to move the text box to a new location in the PDF file.  
  4.   Click the Text Style icon to display a formatting pop-up window 
that lets you do such things as change the text color or font (see 
Figure  23-5 ). 
 Figure 23-5.   Formatting text in a text box 
 Besides using text boxes, another way to add text to a PDF file is through speech bubbles, 
which look like the dialogue bubbles used in comic books. The main purpose of a speech 
bubble is to type a comment and have the speech bubble point to a specific part of a PDF file. 
 By pointing a speech bubble at a particular place in a PDF file, you can add a comment about 
specific items in the PDF file, such as pointing out an error or missing information. A speech 
bubble is basically a different type of text box with a border that makes it easy to spot. 
 To add a speech bubble, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Preview program with a PDF file that you want to modify.  
 2. 
 Click the Tools menu, choose Annotate, and then choose Speech 
Bubble (Tools ➤ Annotate ➤ Speech Bubble). A speech bubble 
appears, as shown in Figure  23-6 . 
 

420
CHAPTER 23: Modifying PDF Files
 3. 
 Do one or more of the following to modify the speech bubble:
 a.  Double-click inside the speech bubble and type a comment.  
 b.  Move the pointer over the text box handle (little circles around the edges of 
the speech bubble) and drag the mouse to resize the speech bubble.  
 c.  Move the pointer over the speech bubble so that it turns into a hand pointer, 
and then drag the mouse to move the speech bubble to a new location in the 
PDF file.  
 d.  Move the pointer over the handle (a clear circle) near the pointer of the speech 
bubble and drag the mouse to move the pointer to a new location.  
 You can modify the border or interior of a text box or speech bubble by clicking either the 
Border Color or Fill Color icon, as shown in Figure  23-7 .

CHAPTER 23: Modifying PDF Files
 Adding Signatures 
 In the past, one of the  biggest   problems with PDF files was adding a signature. That’s why 
most people simply printed out a PDF file, filled it out by hand, and signed it before mailing 
or faxing it to someone else. 
 While you can still sign a PDF file by printing it out, you can also sign a PDF file by either 
using a trackpad (if you have one) or the camera on your Mac (if your Mac has a built-in 
camera). 
 With a trackpad, you can use your finger to sign your name. With a camera, you can sign 
your name on a sheet of white paper and then take a picture of your signature. 
 With either method, you can then save your signature in Preview. Whenever you need to add 
a signature to a PDF file, you can use your saved signature to paste it in the appropriate spot 
on the PDF file.

422
CHAPTER 23: Modifying PDF Files
 Capturing a Signature with a Trackpad 
 If you have a trackpad, you can  capture  your signature by following these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Preview program.  
 2. 
 Click the Tools menu, choose Annotate, Signature, and then Manage 
Signatures (Tools ➤ Annotate ➤ Signature ➤ Manage Signatures). 
Another way is to click the View menu and choose Show Markup 
Toolbar (View ➤ Show Markup Toolbar), and then click the Sign icon.  
 3. 
 Click the Trackpad tab, as shown in Figure  23-8 . 
 Figure 23-8.    Writing a signature with a trackpad 
 

423
CHAPTER 23: Modifying PDF Files
 4. 
 Click the Click Here to Begin button.  
 5. 
 Sign your name with your finger on the trackpad and press any key 
when you’re done. If you want to try again, click the Clear button and 
sign your name again.  
 6. 
 Click the Done button. The Preview program stores your signature 
under the Sign icon, as shown in Figure  23-9 . You can store as many 
signatures as you wish.  
 Figure 23-9.   Stored signatures appear under the Sign icon 
 Capturing a Signature with the Mac Camera 
 Almost all  Mac  models (except for the Mac mini) come with a built-in camera, thus another 
way to capture a signature is to take a picture of it. Just sign your name on a white sheet of 
paper and then hold your signature up to the camera to capture it. 
 To capture your signature with the camera, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Preview program.  
 2. 
 Write your signature on a white sheet of paper.  
 3. 
 Click the Tools menu, choose Annotate, Signature, and then Manage 
Signatures (Tools ➤ Annotate ➤ Signature ➤ Manage Signatures). 
Another way is to click the View menu and choose Show Markup 
Toolbar (View ➤ Show Markup Toolbar), and then click the Sign icon.  
 4. 
 Click the Camera tab.  
 5. 
 Hold up your written signature to the camera and click the Done 
button. 
 

424
CHAPTER 23: Modifying PDF Files
 Placing a Signature in a PDF File 
 Once you’ve captured  one or more signatures using either the trackpad or camera, you can 
place that signature on a PDF file by following these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Preview program and open the PDF file in which you want 
to add a signature.  
 2. 
 Click the View menu and choose Show Markup Toolbar (View ➤ 
Show Markup Toolbar) to make the markup toolbar appear. (If the 
markup toolbar is already visible, skip this step.)  
 3. 
 Click where you want to add the signature on the page.  
 4. 
 Click the Sign icon. A list of stored signatures appears, as shown in 
Figure  23-10 . 
 Figure 23-11.   A signature appears in a box that you can move or resize 
 Figure 23-10.    Your saved signatures appear in a menu 
 5. 
 Click the signature that you want to use. The Preview program places 
your signature in the PDF file, as shown in Figure  23-11 . 
 6. 
 Do one or more of the following to modify the signature box:
 a.  Move the pointer over the box handle (little circles around the corners) and 
drag the mouse to resize the signature box.  
 b.  Move the pointer over the signature box so that it turns into a hand pointer, 
and then drag the mouse to move the signature box to a new location in the 
PDF file.  
 
 

425
CHAPTER 23: Modifying PDF Files
 Deleting a Signature 
 Eventually, you may want  to  delete a saved signature. Deleting your saved signature makes 
sure that no one else can access it to impersonate you. 
 To delete a signature, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Preview program.  
 2. 
 Click the View menu and choose Show Markup Toolbar (View ➤ 
Show Markup Toolbar) to make the markup toolbar appear. (If the 
markup toolbar is already visible, skip this step.)  
 3. 
 Click the Sign icon to view a list of saved signatures.  
 4. 
 Move the mouse pointer over the signature that you want to delete. 
A close icon (an X inside a gray circle) appears to the right of the 
signature, as shown in Figure  23-12 . 
 Note   Anyone with access to your Mac could potentially use your saved signature, so guard 
against access by unauthorized users. 
 Figure 23-12.   A close icon appears when the pointer is over a signature 
 5. 
 Click the close icon next to the signature that you want to delete.  
 Saving Changes to a PDF File 
 If you’ve modified a  PDF  file in any way, remember to save your changes. To save a PDF file 
in the Preview program, click the File menu and choose Save, or press Command+S.  
 

426
CHAPTER 23: Modifying PDF Files
 Summary 
 PDF files are convenient for sharing data, but you can modify them with the Preview 
program. The simplest way to modify a PDF file is to add, delete, or rearrange its pages. 
 A more common way to modify a PDF file is to mark up in the PDF file, such as highlighting, 
underlining, or striking through existing text. These features let you edit text in a PDF file so 
that others can see your suggestions. 
 When you need to add text, you can choose between a text box and a speech bubble. A 
text box lets you fill out a form stored in a PDF file, whereas a speech bubble is more useful 
for pointing out certain text and offering your comments. 
 If you need to sign forms, you can capture and save your signature to add it to the file 
without physically printing the form and signing it by hand. 
 No matter how you modify a PDF file, always remember to save your changes using the 
Save command.

 Capturing Screenshots 
and Video 
 In the business world, many people give presentations using programs like Microsoft 
PowerPoint or Apple’s Keynote. Usually such presentations consist of text and graphics, but 
sometimes you might need to capture images from your screen. Such images can be static 
(known as a  screenshot ) or video, such as showing the steps for using a particular program. 
 Capturing images from the screen used to require buying specialized software, but OS 
X includes several ways to capture screenshots and video. By capturing images directly 
from the screen, you can show people your computer display rather than try to describe it 
to them. 
 There are three ways to capture screenshots on a Mac. First, you can use the screen-
capturing feature in OS X. Second, you can use a separate program called Grab. Third, you 
can use the Preview program 
 The main difference between these three methods is that the OS X screen capture saves 
screenshots in the PNG file format and automatically stores them on your desktop. Any time 
you’re using your Mac, you can capture a screenshot with the OS X screen capture feature. 
 On the other hand, to capture a screenshot with the Grab program, you must specifically 
load the Grab program. The Grab program does let you capture a timed screenshot in which 
you can set a delay before capturing it. The Grab program also saves screenshots in the .tiff 
file format, which takes up more space. 
 The Preview program captures and saves screenshots as graphic images (PNG or JPG files), 
or as PDF files. Depending on which type of file format you need, you can choose the best 
screen-capturing method for your needs. 

428
CHAPTER 24: Capturing Screenshots and Video 
 Capturing Screenshots with OS X 
 To capture a screenshot  with OS X , you must use one of the following keystroke 
combinations:
 Command+Shift+3: Captures the entire screen  
 Command+Shift+4: Captures part of the screen  
 Command+Shift+4: Captures a window  
 When you want to capture the whole screen, press Command+Shift3. When you want to 
capture part of the screen (either a portion you define or a specific open window), press 
Command+Shift+4.  
 Capturing the Whole Screen 
 To capture the  whole screen  , press Command+Shift+3. OS X then stores your screenshot 
on the desktop as a PNG file with a generic name that includes the date and time it was 
captured, as shown in Figure  24-1 . 
 Figure 24-1.   A screenshot contains the date and time of its capture 
 Capturing Part of the Screen 
 You may not always want  to  capture the entire screen, so OS X gives you the option to 
capture just part of the screen. You can either define the area to capture or capture a single 
window on the screen. 
 To capture part of the screen that you define, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Press Command+Shift+4. The pointer turns into a crosshair.  
 2. 
 Move the crosshair pointer where you want to start capturing part of 
the screen.  
 3. 
 Hold down the left mouse button (or press on the trackpad) and 
move the mouse (or slide your finger on the trackpad) to define a 
gray rectangular area to capture, as shown in Figure  24-2 . 
 

429
CHAPTER 24: Capturing Screenshots and Video 
 4. 
 Release the left mouse button (or trackpad). Your screenshot appears 
on the desktop.  
 Capturing a Window 
 If you just want to capture  an  open window on the screen, you could manually drag the 
mouse around the window boundaries, but it’s faster and more accurate to let OS X capture 
the entire window instead. 
 To capture a single open window on the screen, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Press Command+Shift+4. The pointer turns into a crosshair.  
 2. 
 Press the spacebar. The crosshair pointer changes into a camera 
pointer.  
 3. 
 Move the pointer over the open window that you want to capture. 
The currently selected window appears highlighted so that you know 
which window you’re about to capture.  
 4. 
 Click the mouse (or trackpad). Your screenshot appears on the 
desktop.  
 Using the Grab Program 
 Using the OS X screen- capturing  feature is fast and simple, but if you want the flexibility to 
delay capture for a few seconds, then you might want to use the Grab program. 
 The Grab program is stored in the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder. Like the OS X 
screen-capturing features, the Grab program can also capture the entire screen, part of the 
screen, or a single open window on the screen. 
 When using the Grab program, you must manually save any screenshots by clicking the File 
menu and choosing Save, or by pressing Command+S. 
 Figure 24-2.   Dragging the mouse (or trackpad) can capture part of the screen 
 

430
CHAPTER 24: Capturing Screenshots and Video 
 To capture the whole screen, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Grab program stored in the Utilities folder (inside the 
Applications folder).  
 2.

and move the mouse (or slide your fingertip on the trackpad) to 
define the area that you want to capture, which appears in a red 
rectangular box.  
 4. 
 Release the mouse (or trackpad) when you’re done defining the 
area that you want to capture. The Grab program displays your 
screenshot in a window.  
 5. 
 Click the File menu and choose Save (File ➤ Save), or press 
Command+S. A dialog asks where you want to save the screenshot 
and what name you want to give it.  
 To capture a single open window on the screen, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Grab program stored in the Utilities folder (inside the 
Applications folder).  
 2. 
 Click the Capture menu and choose Window (Capture ➤ Window). 
A dialog appears, as shown in Figure  24-5 . 
 Figure 24-4.   The Grab dialog appears when you want to capture part of a screen

CHAPTER 24: Capturing Screenshots and Video 
 3. 
 Click the Choose Window button.  
 4. 
 Click the window that you want to capture. The Grab program 
displays your screenshot in a window.  
 5. 
 Click the File menu and choose Save (File ➤ Save), or press 
Command+S. A dialog asks where you want to save the screenshot 
and what name you want to give it.  
 Capturing a Timed Screen 
 One unique feature  of  the Grab program is its ability to capture a timed screen. That means 
the Grab program delays capturing the screen for a few seconds. This gives you a chance to 
set up your screen the way you want before capturing it. 
 When capturing a timed screen, you can only capture the entire screen, not just part of it. 
 To use the timed screen feature, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Grab program in the Utilities folder (inside the Applications 
folder).  
 2. 
 Click the Capture menu and choose Timed Screen (Capture ➤ Timed 
Screen). A dialog appears, as shown in Figure  24-6 . 
 Figure 24-5.   The Grab dialog appears when you want to capture a window on the screen 
 

433
CHAPTER 24: Capturing Screenshots and Video 
 3. 
 Click the Start Timer screen.  
 4. 
 The Timed Screen Grab dialog shows you the amount of time left 
before the Grab program captures the entire screen. Eventually, the 
Grab program displays your screenshot in a window.  
 5. 
 Click the File menu and choose Save (File ➤ Save), or press 
Command+S. A dialog asks where you want to save the screenshot 
and what name you want to give it.  
 Capturing the Pointer 
 The  Grab program gives   you the option of capturing screens with or without the pointer. 
Sometimes you may want the pointer to appear to show exactly what the screen looks like, 
but other times the pointer simply gets in the way. 
 To determine how to capture the pointer in a screenshot, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Grab program in the Utilities folder (inside the Applications 
folder).  
 2. 
 Click the Grab menu and choose Preferences (Grab ➤ Preferences). 
A Preferences window appears, as shown in Figure  24-7 . 
 Figure 24-6.   The Grab dialog appears when you want to capture a timed screen 
 

434
CHAPTER 24: Capturing Screenshots and Video 
 3. 
 Click a pointer type. If you don’t want the pointer to appear at all, 
click the blank option.  
 4. 
 Click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the 
Preferences window to make it disappear. From now on, every time 
that you capture a screenshot with the Grab program, the pointer will 
appear the way you chose in step 3.  
 Capturing Screenshots with the Preview Program 
 Yet another way  to  capture screenshots is with the Preview program. You can capture all or 
part of a screen, or capture just a single window on the screen. 
 You can then save captured screenshots as individual files or as part of an existing file. 
 To capture a screenshot with the Preview program, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Preview program.  
 2. 
 Click the File menu and choose Take Screenshot (File ➤ Screenshot). 
A submenu appears, as shown in Figure  24-8 . 
 Figure 24-7.   The Grab Preferences window lets you choose how the pointer appears in a screenshot

 Capturing Video and Audio 
 Capturing screenshots can show someone  else  images from your Mac. For greater impact, 
you might prefer to capture video of your screen. Such a video can demonstrate how to 
perform a task so that others can see exactly which steps they need to follow. 
 When you capture video, you can also capture the audio that plays out of your Mac’s 
speakers. The program for capturing video is called the  QuickTime Player  . 
 The QuickTime Player can capture three types of recordings:
 Audio Recording: Captures only audio from the Mac’s built-in 
microphone  
 Screen Recording: Captures the video and audio from what appears on 
the screen  
 Movie Recording: Captures video from the built-in camera on the Mac

 Capturing a Screen Recording 
 A  screen recording captures   everything that appears on the screen. Screen recordings are 
handy for creating software tutorials to show someone how to perform a specific task on the 
computer. 
 When you capture a screen recording, you can also capture audio through the built-in 
microphone on the Mac. If anything on your Mac plays audio (such as music), then the audio 
is only captured from outside the speakers. As a result, the audio may sound muffled and 
less than perfect.

CHAPTER 24: Capturing Screenshots and Video 
 Summary 
 Capturing static or video images on your screen can help you show others how to use a 
computer or how to use a particular feature in a program. By capturing screenshots or videos, 
you can create tutorials to show people exactly what they should see on their own Mac. 
 You can capture screenshots in three different ways: with OS X keystroke commands, with 
the Grab program, or with the Preview program. 
 Capturing screenshots with OS X keystroke commands is fast and simple. 
 Capturing screenshots with the Grab program gives you the option of capturing screenshots 
after a fixed amount of time. 
 Capturing screenshots with the Preview program lets you define a graphic or PDF file format 
to save your images. 
 The  QuickTime  Player program lets you capture audio, screen recordings, or movie 
recordings. Audio only captures audio through the built-in microphone of the Mac. 
 Screen recordings only capture video and audio from the screen. If your Mac plays any 
audio, that audio gets captured through the Mac’s built-in microphone, so the sound may be 
muffled. 
 Movie recordings only capture video and audio from a webcam. Movie recordings are best 
for capturing video of whoever happens to be sitting in front of your Mac. 
 With so many different ways to capture screenshots, audio, and video, you can find the way 
that you like best and capture screenshots or entire movies that you can share with others.

 Chapter 25  
 Syncing a Mac with an 
iPhone or iPad 
 If you’re happy with your Mac, chances are good that you have an iPhone or iPad as well. 
Since many of the programs on the Mac have equivalent apps on the iPhone and iPad, you 
can store data on one device and transfer it to another. 
 For example, you might enter an appointment in your Calendar app on the iPhone, and then 
transfer it to your Mac so that you see the same appointment on all of your calendars. 
 You might also have music or an e-book that you put on your Mac but you want to read on 
your iPad. Whenever you put data on one device, you can seamlessly transfer it to another 
device so that you always have your data when you need it, whatever Apple product you are 
using. 
 The following are some of the programs and data that you can share between a Mac and an 
iPhone or iPad:
 Calendar: Appointments  
 Contacts: Names, addresses, and other contact information  
 Notes: Ideas and random thoughts  
 Photos: Digital photographs  
 iBooks: PDF files and e-books  
 iTunes: Audio and video files  
 By synchronizing data between your Mac and your iPhone or iPad, you can always have the 
most up-to-date data that you need wherever you go. 

442
CHAPTER 25: Syncing a Mac with an iPhone or iPad
 Connecting a Mac to an iPhone or iPad 
 There are two ways to connect  a  Mac to an iPhone or iPad. The most straightforward way is 
to plug the USB charging cable that comes with every iPhone or iPad into both the Mac and 
the iPhone or iPad. 
 Another way to connect a Mac to an iPhone or iPad is through a Wi-Fi network. No matter 
which method you choose, you can then synchronize data between your Mac and iPhone or 
iPad using the iTunes program on your Mac. 
 To synchronize a Mac with an iPhone or iPad, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Plug the USB charging cable into both your Mac and your iPhone or 
iPad.  
 2. 
 Open iTunes on your Mac. A Device icon appears in the upper-left 
corner of the iTunes window, as shown in Figure  25-1 . 
 Figure 25-1.   The Device icon appears when iTunes recognizes an iPhone or iPad connected to your Mac 
 3. 
 Click the Device icon. iTunes shows information about the connected 
iPhone or iPad, as shown in Figure  25-2 .

 Click Summary in the left pane of the iTunes window.  
 5. 
 (Optional) Scroll down to the Options category and select the 
“Synchronize with this iPhone or iPad over Wi-Fi” check box, as 
shown in Figure  25-3 . Click the Apply button in the bottom-right 
corner of the iTunes window.  
 Figure 25-2.   iTunes displays information about the connected iPhone or iPad 
 Figure 25-3.   Selecting to synchronize over Wi-Fi 
 
 

444
CHAPTER 25: Syncing a Mac with an iPhone or iPad
 If you have turned on Wi-Fi synchronization, it only occurs when both your Mac and iPhone 
or iPad use the same Wi-Fi network. Synchronization occurs automatically whenever iTunes 
is open on your Mac and your iPhone or iPad is charging.  
 Backing Up Your iPhone or iPad 
 One critical reason  to  synchronize your Mac with your iPhone or iPad is to back up your 
iPhone or iPad data. If you’ve created data or taken pictures on your iPhone or iPad, you risk 
losing all that important data if you lose your iPhone or iPad. 
 You can back up your iPhone or iPad to iCloud or to your Mac. That way, if you lose your 
iPhone or iPad, you can get another one, retrieve your backups, and essentially clone your 
old iPhone or iPad onto your new one. 
 To back up your iPhone or iPad to your Mac, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Plug the USB charging cable into both your Mac and your iPhone or iPad.  
 2. 
 Open iTunes on your Mac. A Device icon appears in the upper-left 
corner of the iTunes window (see Figure  25-1 ). 
 3. 
 Click the Device icon. iTunes shows you information about your 
connected iPhone or iPad (see Figure  25-2 ).  
 4. 
 Click Summary on the left pane of the iTunes window.  
 5. 
 Click the “This computer” radio button under the Backups category, 
as shown in Figure  25-4 .  
 Figure 25-4.    The Backup options in iTunes 
 6. 
 (Optional) Select the “Encrypt local backup” check box. You need 
to type a password use this backup in the future. Encrypting your 
backup protects your data so that someone else can’t retrieve it if 
they get access to your Mac.  
 7. 
 Click the Back Up Now button.  
 

445
CHAPTER 25: Syncing a Mac with an iPhone or iPad
 Syncing Through iCloud 
 You can synchronize an iPhone or iPad with  your  Mac every time you connect them (through 
the USB cable or Wi-Fi). However, most people don’t synchronize their iPhone or iPad with 
their Mac every time they change data on one device or the other. 
 That’s why it’s much faster and convenient to synchronize your Mac with your iPhone or 
iPad through iCloud. This means that every time you change data on one device (provided 
it has an Internet connection at the time), the changed data gets stored on iCloud and then 
synchronized back with your other device the next time it connects to the Internet. 
 For example, you might type in the name of a new person you’ve met into the Contacts app 
on an iPhone. That new person’s name becomes synchronized in iCloud and stored on the 
Contacts program on your Mac. By using iCloud, you never have to worry about keeping 
your data synchronized yourself. 
 To synchronize through iCloud, you need to define the iCloud settings on both your Mac and 
on your iPhone or iPad. Make sure that you define the same iCloud settings for each device. 
 So if you want to synchronize your Contacts data, make sure that you give the Contacts 
program access to iCloud on both your Mac and your iPhone or iPad. 
 To define iCloud settings on your Mac, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System 
Preferences window appears.  
 2. 
 Click the iCloud icon.  
 3. 
 Select (or clear) the check boxes for the programs that you want to 
synchronize through iCloud, as shown in Figure  25-5 . 

446
CHAPTER 25: Syncing a Mac with an iPhone or iPad
 4. 
 Click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner of the 
iCloud window to make it disappear.  
 Once you’ve defined which programs to synchronize on iCloud, you need to do the same 
thing with your iPhone or iPad. To define iCloud synchronization options on an iPhone or 
iPad, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Tap the Settings icon. The Settings screen appears.  
 2. 
 Tap iCloud. The iCloud screen appears, as shown in Figure  25-6 . 
 Figure 25-5.   Defining program settings for iCloud 
 

447
CHAPTER 25: Syncing a Mac with an iPhone or iPad
 3. 
 Turn the options on or off for different apps. Make sure that the apps 
you choose on your iPhone or iPad are the same ones you chose 
for your Mac.  
 Syncing Through iTunes 
 Keeping your appointments,   contacts, and notes updated on multiple devices is critical. 
That’s why it’s important to synchronize this type of data on iCloud; it’s always current as 
long as you have regular Internet access. 
 However, other types of data are far less time-sensitive, such as your favorite songs, 
e-books, or movies. To synchronize less important data, you can use iTunes every time you 
connect your iPhone or iPad to your Mac. 
 When synchronizing data between your Mac and iPhone or iPad, you can either choose all 
the data or individually choose which items to synchronize. For example, if you click Music 
in the Settings category, you can choose to copy all of your music from your Mac to your 
iPhone or iPad, or just choose individual songs. 
 Figure 25-6.   The iCloud screen lets you define which apps can synchronize data

 6. 
 Click the Apply button.  
 Disconnecting an iPhone or iPad 
 When you’re done  synchronizing   data between your Mac and iPhone or iPad, don’t 
disconnect the USB cable just yet; you have to eject the iPhone or iPad first. 
 Ejecting the iPhone or iPad gives your Mac a chance to make sure that there are no open 
files on the iPhone or iPad so that you can safely disconnect and remove the device. 
 To disconnect an iPhone or iPad from a Mac, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the iTunes program.  
 2. 
 Click the Eject button, as shown in Figure  25-9 .

 Summary 
 Your data is important to you, so it’s crucial that you have access to your important data 
whether you’re using a Mac, an iPhone, or an iPad. By synchronizing your data, your data 
essentially follows you, whichever device you happen to be using at the time. 
 For synchronizing critical information such as contacts and appointments, use iCloud. 
Through iCloud and regular access to the Internet, your data is synchronized instantly. For 
less time-sensitive data, such as e-books or music, you can synchronize data manually. 
 Besides synchronizing your data, iTunes can also be used to back up your iPhone or iPad. 
By doing this, you’ll never risk losing data on your iPhone or iPad again. 
 With an iPhone or iPad and a Mac, you’ll be able to work anywhere you have an Apple 
device, whether it’s at a desk or on the road.

 Part VI 
 Useful Macintosh Information 
 A surprisingly large amount of information about using a computer is often passed around by 
word of mouth but rarely printed in a book. That’s why this part of the book includes useful 
information known by experienced Macintosh users. By reading this part of the book, you’ll 
learn what experienced Macintosh users have known for years. 
 First, you’ll learn about simple disk maintenance tasks that you can perform to tune up your 
computer any time it starts acting erratically. 
 Second, you’ll learn how to protect your Macintosh from malware. Although the malware 
threat isn’t as severe as the one that Windows PC users face every day, malware is slowly 
coming to the Macintosh, so you need to know how to identify the threats and protect your 
computer as much as possible. 
 Third, you’ll eventually need to buy a new computer one day, so you need to know the best 
ways to buy another computer without spending too much to do it. 
 By reading this part of the book, you’ll learn hidden secrets that have taken most people 
years to gather on their own.

 Chapter 26  
 Protecting Your Data 
 Computers are like cars because they only work if you properly maintain them. While it’s 
nice to think that your Mac will work all the time, whenever you  need it, the reality is that 
your Mac may eventually fail if you don’t take care of it. Perhaps the most important way to 
maintain your Mac and all of your critical data is to maintain your disk. 
 Older Mac computers have physical hard disks, whereas newer Mac models use solid-state 
drives that act like USB flash drives in that they have no moving parts. While solid-state 
drives are much faster than mechanical hard drives, they are prone to failure too. One of the 
most common ways disks can fail is by corrupting or losing data. 
 Losing or corrupting  data  may never happen to you, but it’s not a surprise when it does 
occur. That’s because OS X isn’t perfect and it’s possible that, through no fault of your own, 
OS X will simply fail to correctly save a file in the right location, overriding or destroying other 
files that you’ve saved. 
 Ultimately, maintaining your disk is really about protecting your files. Two common ways to 
lose a file are deleting it by mistake or OS X corrupting it. 
 Retrieving Deleted Files 
 When you delete a file, OS  X  doesn’t physically erase the file. Instead, it stores the file in the 
Trash folder. As long as a file appears in the Trash folder, you’ll be able to retrieve it. That 
means that if you delete a file today and peek in your Trash folder five years from now, you’ll 
be able to find your file safe and sound. The only way you ever risk losing a file is if you 
dump it in the Trash folder and then empty the Trash folder. 
 The moment that you empty the Trash folder, OS X pretends that the file never existed. 
However, the file still physically exists on your hard disk, which means that if you buy special 
file-recovery software, you may still be able to retrieve previously deleted files. However, the 
longer you wait to retrieve a deleted file, the lower your chances of actually recovering it. 

454
CHAPTER 26: Protecting Your Data
 If you haven’t emptied the Trash folder, you can recover a deleted file by following these 
steps:
 1. 
 Right-click the Trash icon on the Dock. A pop-up menu appears, 
as shown in Figure  26-1 .  
 Figure 26-1.   Right-clicking the Trash icon displays a pop-up menu 
 2. 
 Choose Open. The Finder window lists all the deleted files still in the 
Trash folder.  
 3. 
 Right-click the file that you want to retrieve. A pop-up menu appears, 
as shown in Figure  26-2 .  
 

455
CHAPTER 26: Protecting Your Data
 4. 
 Choose the Put Back command. The Finder moves your file back to 
its original location.  
 Using Time Machine 
 Retrieving files from the  Trash folder works if you haven’t emptied the Trash folder. 
The moment you empty the Trash folder, you’re unable to retrieve any previously deleted 
files without buying special file-recovery software. 
 Of course, you have to empty your Trash folder periodically; otherwise, all of your deleted 
files will take up space until you have so many deleted files on your computer that you can’t 
store anything else. That’s why you need to empty the Trash folder periodically, but only after 
you’re sure that you will never need any of those deleted files again. 
 If you want the option of retrieving deleted files in the future, then another solution is to use 
Time Machine, which is a free backup program included with every Mac. 
 To use Time Machine, you need an external hard disk that’s connected to your Mac at all 
times. The most common way to connect an external hard disk to a Mac is through a USB 
cable, but some external hard disks (such as Apple’s Time Capsule) can connect to a Mac 
through a Wi-Fi network. Connecting an external hard disk wirelessly can be especially 
convenient with laptops, such as the MacBook, which lacks a traditional USB port. 
 Figure 26-2.   Right-clicking a file displays a pop-up menu with the Go Back command 
 

456
CHAPTER 26: Protecting Your Data
 Once you have an external hard disk, you need to configure Time Machine to work with that 
external hard disk. Ideally, you should only use that external hard disk solely for backing up 
your Mac on Time Machine.  
 Configuring an External Hard Disk with Time Machine 
 Once you have an external  hard disk connected to your Mac, you need to configure 
Time Machine to work with that external hard disk. 
 To configure a hard disk to work with Time Machine, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple menu. A pull-down menu appears.  
 2. 
 Choose System Preferences. The System Preferences window 
appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Time Machine icon. A Time Machine window appears, 
as shown in Figure  26-3 .  
 Figure 26-3.    The Time Machine window 
 4. 
 Click the On/Off switch to On.

458
CHAPTER 26: Protecting Your Data
 Retrieving Deleted Files with Time Machine 
 Time Machine backs up  your   entire Mac every hour, including files, programs, and settings. 
Once Time Machine fills up an external hard disk, it starts erasing the oldest backup and 
replaces it with the latest backup. 
 Because of this, you want the largest external hard disk you can afford. If you get a small 
external hard disk, Time Machine won’t be able to store backups from too far in the past. If 
you get a large external hard disk, you’ll be able to retrieve files from longer in the past, such 
as several months or even several years ago. 
 The moment that you realize you need a file that you once had, you don’t have to panic 
or frantically search through your computer to see if another copy still exists. Instead, you 
can just load Time Machine, go back to a specific time in the past when you know the file 
existed, and retrieve the file. 
 To retrieve a file saved by Time Machine, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open Time Machine by either double-clicking the Time Machine icon 
in the Applications folder or by clicking the Time Machine icon on the 
menu bar (see Figure  26-5 ) and choosing Enter Time Machine. 
The Time Machine window appears, as shown in Figure  26-6 . 
 Figure 26-6.   The Time Machine window displays a timeline on the right edge of the screen 
 

459
CHAPTER 26: Protecting Your Data
 2. 
 Click the timeline to a point in the past when you know a certain file 
existed.  
 3. 
 Navigate in the Finder window until you find the file that you want to 
retrieve.  
 4. 
 Click the file that you want to retrieve.  
 5. 
 Click the Restore button. Time Machine retrieves your file and 
displays it in the Finder window.  
 Using the Disk Utility Program 
 The Trash folder and  Time  Machine are handy for retrieving files that you may have deleted 
by mistake. However, sometimes your hard disk might simply fail, either from mechanical 
problems or from problems with OS X. If you try to access a hard disk and get error 
messages, you might need to use the Disk Utility program to fix your hard disk. 
 The Disk Utility program is stored in the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder. 
The Disk Utility can’t recover corrupted or deleted files, but it can fix the way that files are 
stored on the hard disk, so you might be able to retrieve files off that disk again. 
 To use the Disk Utility program to fix your hard disk, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Disk Utility program inside the Utilities folder (which is 
inside the Applications folder). The Disk Utility window appears, as 
shown in Figure  26-7 .

 Summary 
 The two most common ways to a lose file are through user error or computer failure. If you 
accidentally delete a file, you might be able to retrieve it from the Trash folder, provided you 
didn’t empty the Trash folder. 
 If you did empty the Trash folder and you still need to retrieve a lost file, you might still be 
able to recover that file if an external hard disk was connected to your Mac and you used the 
Time Machine backup program. 
 With Time Machine, you can retrieve files from days, weeks, months, or even years ago. Of 
course, Time Machine can only protect your files if you set it up long before you actually 
need it. 
 If your hard disk is acting erratically, you may need to repair it. Sometimes hard disks fail 
because of mechanical errors, but most of the time hard disks fail because OS X can no 
longer recognize the files on that particular hard disk. 
 When this occurs, you can often fix these software errors by using the Disk Utility program, 
which comes in the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder. Disk utility can repair OS X 
problems to correctly recognize the files stored on a hard disk again.  
 Note   If Disk Utility can’t fix a problem, you may need to use a more extensive disk utility repair 
program.

 Chapter 27  
 Protecting a Mac from 
Malware 
 Malware is a category of software known as malicious software or viruses. Most malware 
can only attack specific operating systems. Since Windows PCs were once the dominant 
computers in the world, most malware targets Microsoft Windows. 
 With the growing popularity of the Mac, more and more malware now targets OS X. 
No matter what type of computer you use, it is always possible to become infected with 
malware. 
 There are two ways to guard against malware. The most common way is to rely on 
technological solutions such as antivirus software. Unfortunately, technological solutions can 
never provide 100-percent protection. That’s because the weakest link in any computer’s 
security is always the user. 
 If users fail to turn on or use technological solutions, then those technological solutions 
are useless. Even worse, users can often be tricked into installing malware. Ultimately, no 
amount of technological solutions can ever protect your computer. You also need a basic 
understanding of computer security so that you don’t accidentally infect your computer by 
mistake. 
 Malware can only infect your computer if it can  access  it. The following are some of the 
ways that malware can get into a computer:
 Inserting an infected USB flash drive into the USB port of your computer  
 Downloading an infected file attachment sent to you by e-mail  
 Visiting a malicious web site  
 Ultimately, the best defense against malware is knowing the types of threats that may attack 
your computer and avoiding falling prey to their traps.

CHAPTER 27: Protecting a Mac from Malware
 Password Protecting a Mac 
 Beyond physically locking  your  Mac behind a door, the next best way to block access to 
your Mac is to provide password protection. When you first set up your Mac, you have to 
choose a password, but you can always change it later. 
 Besides changing your password periodically, there are the following two other options to 
consider:
 Requiring a password after a fixed amount of inactivity: Password 
protects your Mac if you step away for a moment  
 Disabling automatic login: Requires a password to log in  
 To change the password settings on your Mac, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple menu. A pull-down menu appears.  
 2. 
 Choose System Preferences. The System Preferences window 
appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Security & Privacy icon. The Security & Privacy window 
appears.  
 4. 
 Click the General tab (see Figure  27-1 ). 
 Note  The best passwords contain random letters, numbers, and symbols. 

465
CHAPTER 27: Protecting a Mac from Malware
 5. 
 Select (or clear) the “Require password” check box. Click in the 
pop-up menu to define a time, such as 15 minutes or 1 hour. 
Selecting this option gives you greater security.  
 6. 
 Select (or clear) the “Disable automatic login” check box. Selecting 
this option gives you greater security.  
 7. 
 Click the Change Password button if you want to change your 
password. (Generally, you should change your password periodically 
for greater security.)  
 8. 
 Click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner to make 
the Security & Privacy window disappear.

CHAPTER 27: Protecting a Mac from Malware
 Turning on the Firewall 
 If your Mac is connected to the Internet,  it’s  vulnerable. Every time you connect to the 
Internet, you’re an open target for anyone around the world to hack into your computer. 
 To protect yourself when you’re on the Internet, you need to turn on the  firewall . A firewall 
essentially acts like a locked door that keeps hackers on the Internet from getting into your 
computer. Without a firewall, anyone on the Internet can get into your computer, so it’s 
crucial that you turn on your firewall. 
 Generally, if you turn on your firewall, you’ll rarely have a reason to turn it off; so once you 
turn on the firewall, leave it on. 
 To turn on the firewall, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Apple menu. A pull-down menu appears.  
 2. 
 Choose System Preferences. The System Preferences window 
appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Security & Privacy icon. The Security & Privacy window 
appears.  
 4. 
 Click the Firewall tab. (If a green dot appears next to the “Firewall: 
On” label, your firewall is already turned on, so you don’t need to 
follow the remaining steps.)  
 5. 
 Click the Lock icon in the bottom-left corner. A dialog appears for 
you to type your password.  
 6. 
 Type your password and click the Unlock button.  
 7. 
 Click the Turn On Firewall button (see Figure  27-2 ). 

467

CHAPTER 27: Protecting a Mac from Malware
 9. 
 Select (or clear) the “Block all incoming connections” check box. 
Selecting this check box provides greater security. If this check box 
is clear, you can individually block certain programs from accessing 
the Internet by clicking the pop-up menu to the right of each program 
name and choose “Allow or Block incoming connections”. Ideally, 
you want to allow incoming connections for programs that you 
recognize, and block incoming connections for programs that you 
don’t recognize.  
 10. 
 Select (or clear) the “Automatically allow signed software to receive 
incoming connections” check box. Selecting this check box provides 
greater security because signed software represents software that a 
third party has verified, much like a driver’s license represents that a 
government agency has verified your identity (although, like a driver’s 
license, signed software can also be faked).

CHAPTER 27: Protecting a Mac from Malware
 11. 
 Select (or clear) the “Enable stealth mode” check box. Stealth mode 
hides your computer from hackers trying to find it on the Internet. 
Selecting this check box provides greater security.  
 12. 
 Click OK.  
 13. 
 Click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner to close 
the Security & Privacy window.  
 Protecting Safari 
 Every time that you use  a   browser like Safari, you’re at risk of visiting a malicious web site. 
Such malicious web sites often contain misspelled domain names. 
 For example, instead of typing the correct  microsoft.com , you might misspell it, such as 
 mircosoft.com . Because it’s so easy to misspell a domain name, many hackers set up 
malicious web sites using similar domain names as well-known sites. 
 The best way to protect yourself from such malicious web sites is to type a domain address 
carefully and check its spelling before visiting the site. Then, if it’s a site you plan on visiting 
often, bookmark the site so that you can safely visit that site in the future. 
 Of course, it’s not always possible to avoid malicious web sites because sometimes hackers 
booby-trap legitimate web sites as well. Because you can never be too safe on the Internet, 
you need to take precautions with your browser. 
 Since most hackers know that Mac users rely on Safari as their main browser, one trick is to 
use a less popular browser, such as Opera. Malware designed to trick Safari may not be able 
to trick another browser, like Opera. 
 If you’re going to use Safari, you need to make sure that you have turned on additional 
security measures.  
 Defining “Safe” Files to Download 
 By default, Safari  defines   common files as “safe” for downloading, such as PDF files. 
In reality, PDF files along with movie files are often specifically infected with malware 
because so many people think these types of files are safe. While it’s convenient to let these 
types of files be freely downloaded, it does open up a huge security hole in your Mac, so you 
need to decide if convenience is worth the security risk. 
 Many times, hackers disguise malware as seemingly innocent file attachments. For example, 
one trick is to send an e-mail message supposedly from Federal Express or UPS, claiming the 
service tried to drop off a package and you now need to download and open a file attachment. 
 Sometimes hackers even hijack a friend’s e-mail account and send messages from a friend’s 
e-mail address. Once again, assume that anything from the Internet is not what it seems until 
you can prove otherwise. That might mean contacting your friend in a different way (such as 
through text messaging on a smartphone) to verify that he or she really did send you a file 
(or did not if you receive a suspicious message from a “friend” claiming to be trapped in a 
foreign country and needing you to send money to a strange address overseas right away). 

470
CHAPTER 27: Protecting a Mac from Malware
 Another trick is to booby-trap ads on legitimate web sites. Visiting a web site might display a 
warning message that asks you to take some kind of action, such as clicking a link. When in 
doubt, don’t believe anything on the Internet and play it safe by only downloading files you 
absolutely trust. 
 To define whether to allow downloading PDFs, movies, and other common types of files 
from the Internet, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open Safari.  
 2. 
 Click the Safari menu and choose Preferences (Safari ➤ 
Preferences). A Preferences window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the General icon, as shown in Figure  27-4 . 
 Figure 27-4.    The General tab in the Safari Preferences window 
 4. 
 Select (or clear) the “Open “safe” files after downloading” check box. 
Clearing this check box provides greater security.  
 5. 
 Click the red dot (the close button) in the upper-left corner to close 
the Preferences window.  
 

471
CHAPTER 27: Protecting a Mac from Malware
 Defining Safari Security Settings 
 In the old days,  browsers did relatively little, so you needed to download and install plug-ins 
to let them display animation or play audio. Because downloading and installing plug-ins 
became so popular, hackers soon started creating malware disguised as plug-ins. 
 Even worse, hackers also used legitimate plug-ins to break into computers. Because each 
plug-in needs access to your computer, each plug-in provides another potential opening for 
malware to break into your computer. Common plug-ins like Adobe Flash and Java are 
often hijacked by malware to sneak into your computer. For greater security, you don’t want 
plug-ins, although they may be necessary on some web sites that you rely on. 
 To block browser plug-ins, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open Safari.  
 2. 
 Click the Safari menu and choose Preferences (Safari ➤ 
Preferences). A Preferences window appears.  
 3. 
 Click the Security icon, as shown in Figure  27-5 . 
 Figure 27-5.    The Security tab in the Safari Preferences window 
 4. 
 Select (or clear) the “Warning when visiting a fraudulent website” 
check box. Selecting this check box provides greater security but 
cannot guarantee that fraudulent web sites might still appear in 
Safari anyway.  
 5. 
 Select (or clear) the Allow Plug-ins check box. Clearing this check 
box provides greater security but at the risk of not allowing certain 
web sites to display correctly.  
 6. 
 (Optional) Click the Plug-in Settings button. A window shows you the 
plug-ins that are currently installed. If you click the plug-in in the left 
pane, you see a list of the web sites that require the use of that 
plug-in, as shown in Figure  27-6 . 
 

472
CHAPTER 27: Protecting a Mac from Malware
 7. 
 Select (or clear) the check box to the left of each plug-in, such 
as Adobe Flash Player. If you don’t want to completely block a 
plug-in, you can selectively choose which web sites can run the 
plug-in by clicking the pop-up menu that appears to the right of web 
site names, as shown in Figure  27-7 . 
 Figure 27-6.   The Plug-ins option window shows all installed plug-ins and the web sites that require them to work 
 

473
CHAPTER 27: Protecting a Mac from Malware
 Figure 27-7.   You can selectively allow or block individual web sites from running plug-ins 
 8. 
 (Optional) Click in the “When visiting other websites” pop-up menu 
to select how the plug-in works with web sites other than the ones 
listed.  
 9. 
 Click the Done button.  
 Summary 
 The best computer security starts with you. Don’t visit suspicious web sites, don’t open 
file attachments from strangers, and don’t believe phony e-mail messages from seemingly 
legitimate organizations. In other words, trust no one on the Internet. 
 At the very least, turn on the firewall in OS X. This firewall may block legitimate programs 
from accessing the Internet, but in most cases, it prevents hackers from breaking into your 
computer. 
 To physically protect your Mac, restrict access whenever possible. Since that may not be 
feasible, however, password protect your Mac so that others can’t access your computer 
without your permission. 
 

474
CHAPTER 27: Protecting a Mac from Malware
 Finally, harden Safari’s security settings. Turn off unnecessary plug-ins and consider 
blocking access to supposedly “safe” files to download, which are not actually safe at all. 
Whenever you make your computer more secure, you also increase the chance of making 
it more inconvenient to use, so you have to carefully weigh the pros and cons of various 
security settings. 
 Ultimately, the best form of security is knowing how malware might attack your computer 
and then taking steps to minimize the risk. You’ll never be completely free from attacks, but 
you can always try to make it more difficult for hackers and malware to attack your Mac.

 Chapter 28  
 Shopping for a New Mac  
 Unlike other types of computers, a Mac holds its value and usefulness for years. Once you 
get a Mac, you won’t need a new one for a long time because Apple offers free regular OS X 
updates. 
 The only problem with free  OS X upgrades  is that they’re mostly designed to run on the 
latest hardware. That means over time, your Mac will simply lack the hardware necessary 
to take full advantage of the newest features in OS X. Eventually, the latest version of OS 
X stops supporting older hardware, which means you’re stuck with a Mac that is unable to 
adopt the newest version of OS X. 
 That’s when you need to think about getting another Mac. Eventually, you’ll want to get 
another Mac, either as an addition or as a complete replacement. 
 When shopping for a Mac, you have multiple options, but you can save money by timing 
your purchases and shopping selectively. By doing both, you can buy a new Mac for 
hundreds of dollars less than the normal retail price. 
 Time Your Purchases with Apple’s Upgrade Cycle 
 Apple releases new Mac  models   at regular intervals. Just as Apple always releases a new 
iPhone model every year, they also release new Mac models at fairly predictable times of the 
year. By timing your purchase to match Apple’s release schedule, you can avoid paying top 
dollar for a new Mac that’s outdated (although still perfectly usable) the next day. 
 The main web site for tracking Apple’s product upgrade cycle is the   MacRumours Buyer’s 
Guide (  http://buyersguide.macrumors.com ), shown in Figure  28-1 . 

476
CHAPTER 28: Shopping for a New Mac
 The  MacRumours Buyer’s Guide provides estimates for when Apple will likely release a new 
model (such as a Mac mini or MacBook) and offers suggestions for buying a particular Mac:
 Buy Now: This means that Apple just released a new model  
 Caution: This means that Apple released the latest model a while ago, 
so if you can afford to wait, do so to get the newest model for the same 
or lower price as the current-generation model  
 Don’t Buy: This means that Apple will likely release a new model soon, 
so don’t buy a new Mac unless you absolutely need one now  
 Remember, Apple’s release schedule isn’t always predictable, so the  MacRumours Buyer’s 
Guide gives a rough estimate when a new Mac model will likely appear. By timing your 
purchases to the  MacRumours Buyer’s Guide recommendations, you can buy the latest 
model instead of paying the same amount of money to get last generation’s model. 
 As an alternative to buying the latest Mac model on the day it arrives, you might take the 
opposite approach and buy last generation’s model at a discount. 
 For example, if you purchase the latest iMac or MacBook, it might cost you the standard 
retail price. However, the moment that Apple releases a new model, the new model adopts 
the retail price while the previous generation model drops in price. 
 Figure 28-1.    The MacRumours Buyer’s Guide web site 
 

477
CHAPTER 28: Shopping for a New Mac
 That means on the day before Apple releases a new model, an iMac might cost you $1,299, 
but the next day when Apple releases a newer model, that same iMac is now considered a 
previous generation model. As a result, the price drops, so you can buy a brand-new Mac 
for much less simply because a newer model just appeared.  
 Buy Refurbished 
 Even if you time your purchases to buy a new Mac the  day it’s released, you’ll still pay full 
retail price. Rather than buy a new model right when it’s introduced, wait a while. The reason 
to wait is because other people buy the latest model and then return it for whatever reason. 
 When that happens, Apple and other stores, such as Best Buy, take the returned products 
and check them to make sure that everything works correctly. Since they can’t sell returned 
items as new, they must sell them as refurbished, which means they have to sell them at 
reduced prices. 
 By buying a refurbished computer, you can save hundreds of dollars. Refurbished models 
come with the same warranty as new models but at a slightly lower price. 
 The one drawback of refurbished models is that you can’t customize them. That means you 
have to buy only what’s available. If a particular model or configuration isn’t available, you’ll 
have to wait and hope that your desired configuration becomes available soon. If you have 
needs that require a specially configured computer, you may only find standard models for 
sale as refurbished; in which case, you would have to buy a new computer. 
 In exchange for waiting and taking what’s available, refurbished computers offer lower prices. 
To purchase a refurbished computer from Apple, visit Apple’s web site (   www.apple.com   ) and 
look for the Refurbished link near the bottom of the home page, as shown in Figure  28-2 .  

478
CHAPTER 28: Shopping for a New Mac
 Besides Apple, other stores sell refurbished Mac models, including Best Buy and MacMall. 
Like Apple, these other stores give the same warranty on refurbished model as they do for 
new ones. Also, the variety of configurations is limited. 
 The next time you’re in the market for a new Mac, browse refurbished Mac sites. You may 
find the model you want at a lower price than retail.  
 Figure 28-2.   Apple sells refurbished Mac models on their web site 
 

479
CHAPTER 28: Shopping for a New Mac
 Shop During Holidays 
 You’ll rarely find that  the  price of Mac computers differs much because Apple enforces 
a fixed retail price for all retailers. Yet during the holiday shopping season at the end of 
every year, almost every retailer—including Apple and many other electronics stores—offer 
discounts. 
 Such discounts can save you money or reward you with gift cards or other bonuses, 
depending on which Mac you buy. Retailers want to sell as many products as possible 
during each holiday season. So if you can time your purchase to wait for holiday sales, you 
can save yourself some money.  
 Do Your Own Memory Upgrade 
 It’s no secret that  Apple   charges more for memory than everyone else. Unfortunately, some 
Mac models have soldered memory chips, which means that you cannot replace them. 
When you buy a Mac, make sure that it comes with enough memory, or you will never be 
able to increase it. 
 A handful of Mac models offer removable memory chips, however. For those Mac models, 
simply buy the model with the least amount of memory, and then buy memory chips from 
a third-party retailer. Then all you have to do is plug the memory chip into your Mac. You’ll 
save money if you buy and install memory yourself rather than pay Apple to do it. 
 Just remember to make sure the Mac you want offers removable memory chips, because 
more Mac models are using soldered memory chips that can’t be easily replaced.  
 Get an Educational Discount 
 If you’re a teacher or a student, you can buy hardware and software at  a   discount. College 
bookstores typically offer discounts to anyone with a faculty or a student ID. Apple’s own 
site offers a special store for educators, as shown in Figure  28-3 . 

480
CHAPTER 28: Shopping for a New Mac
 Buy a Used Mac 
 Mac computers tend to  hold   their value better than ordinary PCs. That’s why many people 
sell their used Macs so that they can use the money to buy a newer model. 
 If you’re willing to do a little research and you don’t mind getting a slightly older Mac, buying 
a used Mac can save you money. Just like buying a used car, buying a used computer 
means taking the time to understand exactly what you’re getting for the price. 
 A used Mac may work just fine, but it will become outdated faster than a newer computer, 
which means that you may not be able to upgrade it to the latest version of OS X. If you are 
able to upgrade it to the latest version of OS X, your Mac may not be able to accept next 
year’s version of OS X. 
 Just be careful when buying a used Mac. If you’re wary of buying a used Mac from eBay 
or Craigslist (be careful that you’re not buying stolen merchandise), you might feel more 
comfortable buying a used Mac from one of two reputable dealers. 
 Figure 28-3.   Apple’s educational site offers modest discounts on all Mac models 
 

481
CHAPTER 28: Shopping for a New Mac
 PowerMax (   www.powermax.com  ) sells both new and used Mac computers (see Figure  28-4 ). 
When you buy a used Mac from PowerMax, they’ll give you a 120-day warranty so that you 
can be sure your Mac works correctly. If you’re in the market for a new Mac, you can trade in 
your old one to PowerMax so that you don’t have to sell it yourself.  
 Figure 28-4.   PowerMax sells a variety of used Mac computers 
 Another used Mac retailer is Mac of All Trades (   www.macofalltrades.com  ). Like PowerMax, 
Mac of All Trades sells used computers with a warranty so that you can be sure that your 
used Mac works correctly. By buying a used Mac (or trading in your old Mac) through 
reputable used computer dealers, you don’t have to worry about being cheated. 
 Carefully compare the prices of used computers, because many times you can buy 
refurbished computers (which are practically new) for only slightly more than an older used 
computer.  
 

482
CHAPTER 28: Shopping for a New Mac
 Figure 28-5.   Many retailers offer small everyday discounts below Apple’s normal retail price 
 Buy from Apple Retailers 
 Apple charges the full  retail   price for all of their products, except during the holiday season, 
when they might offer discounts. On the other hand, most other retailers offer small 
discounts on Apple’s retail price to entice you to buy from them instead of from Apple. 
 One prominent online dealer is MacMall (   www.macmall.com  ), which offers small discounts on 
nearly every Mac model (see Figure  28-5 ). 
 Other retailers, such as Best Buy, may charge full retail price on some Mac models but offer 
slight discounts on other models. By comparison price shopping on other retailer web sites, 
you can often find a brand-new Mac at a slight discount.  
 Summary 
 The most expensive option is to buy a new Mac from Apple. If you’re going to buy a 
computer from Apple, consider buying a refurbished model. The main drawback of 
refurbished models is that they may not always offer the configuration that you want. 
 Besides refurbished computers, consider buying a used computer or a new computer using 
an educational discount, if you qualify as a student or teacher. 
 If you insist on buying a new Mac, look at other retailers besides Apple. The chances are 
good that you’ll save a little bit of money buying from another retailer rather than directly 
from Apple. Whether you buy a Mac from Apple or another retailer, you’ll still be able to get 
free technical support from your neighborhood Apple Store if necessary. 
 Just because the Mac is considered a premium product doesn’t mean that you have to pay 
a premium price for it. By taking the time to research and compare all of your options, you 
may be surprised at how much money you can save.
