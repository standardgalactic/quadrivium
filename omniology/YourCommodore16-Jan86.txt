WELL, HERE WE ARE, THREE ISSUES INTO
the merger between Your Commodore
and Your 64.
Letters have been ﬂowing in from
readers -  some of them good, some of
them bad. Some people are saying that
the 'new' magazine is not Your 64 and that
we should re-launch Your 64 as a maga-
zine in its own right. Well, quite simply
Your Commodore is not Your 64, it was
never intended to be. However, what we
did aim to do was to bring together what
we considered to be the best parts of both
magazines. In these ﬁrst few issues we
have brought you the games reviews and
Scratchpad from Your 64. Quite shortly,
you should be seeing the re-emergence
of Arcade Ace and a number of other
features.
Quite a few people have asked us what
has happened to the 'Cheats and POKEs'
section from Your 64. Our view on this is
that if you're going to buy a game, the fun
is solving t h e puzzles set b y t h e
programmer. If you're going to cheat why
buy it?
This doesn't mean that we aren't open
to suggestions. Please let us know what
you would like to see in the magazine and
we'll see what we can do. Not only have
we had mail from people with gripes but
we have had an equal number of letters
complementing us on the latest issues.
One kind reader was over the moon
about John McHales character editor and
said that "It's material like this that
compels us to keep buying your superb
magazine". Thank you very much.
Another reader said that "Now my
brother loves to read the magazine as
well". Well, we do try to cater for all tastes.
A couple of people have said that Your
64 just covered the C M and that we
should do the same. Well I'm afraid our
title is Your Commodore and as such we
try t o  cover all t h e machines that
Commodore produces.
you • o  ave any commen s e n
please write to us and make sure that you
tell us what you do like.

STATEMENTS

MODEM MAN IA I S SWEEPING THE
country and communications services like
Prestel and Micronet are taking full
advantage of this growing enthusiasm by
adding more and more facilities to their
existing systems.
Micronet's efforts to encourage new
users to buy modems by enticing them
with ﬂO vouchers when they purchase
them from Pace, Miracle or  Modem
House, is  now  being stepped u p  t o
include Xyllyx.
John Barton, marketing manager for
Xyllyx said: "This move towards the
consumer end of the industry marks a
new phase for us and is a reﬂection of the
increasing importance of the communi-
cations ﬁeld as we see it. Particularly in
terms of the home user."
There's also news from the Micronet
Gallery wher e queues o f  potential
exhibitors have formed. Micronet has a
plot afoot to weed out those naughty
exhibitors who are not using or editing
their pages sufﬁciently.
From 1 December, Gallery is repriced
to 99p per frame for four months. Each
edit now costs 10p. Existing exhibitors can
be transferred to the new pages for a
block charge of 99p.
According to Micronet, it is hoped
that the changes will mean that only
'serious' exhibitors will book!
Pace Micro Technology is encourag-
ing communications enthusiasts to take to
their boats by  sponsoring the Round
Britain Race on Micronet 800. Entrants
who buy  a  Nightingale modem will
qualify for the Pace prize of a return trip to
New York for two, plus six nights in a top
hotel and MO  spending money.
Micronet's public ity  man, Peter
Probert commented: "It's good to see a
modem company giving out to the people
who made them as important as they are
i.e. the customers."
Telecom Cold increased its charges
from 1 December. Connect time charges
for standard rate now cost lip per minute
(0800-1900 Monday to Friday) and cheap
rate is 3.5p per minute. Cold Net service
charges go up to 2.5p per minute for 300
baud and 3p per minute for 1200 baud. All
other charges remain the same.
British T elec om's  M u lt i- U s e r
Dungeon ( MUD)  has  been delayed
although Telecom says it will be up and
running before the end o f  1985, All
existing subscribers ar e guaranteed
substantial free credit for an initial test
period.
The MUD spectacular will now take
place in the spring.
The delay has caused frustration to
MUD organisers, according t o  Mik e
Anderiesz, Launch Manager: "MUD is
unique - there hasn't been a program of
this size or complexity before. Even so the
problems we're experiencing are the kind
of last minute bugs every programmer has
to deal with. As far as we're concerned the
quality of the ﬁnished product is more
important than the deadline."
Prestel has announced a growth of 44
per cent in the past year with more than
one million pages a day being accessed
and 100.000 electronic mail messages per
week.
Areas which have attracted new users
to Prestel are travel, insurance, micro-
computing, c ity  information, farming
information, home banking, shopping
and messaging.

Generally Speaking
SIRCAL INSTRUMENTS IS ABOUT TO RE-
lease a complete cartridge and erasure
system for the CM,
:

N e w s
Included in the system is a program-
mer unit, a mains powered UV eraser unit,
one operating system cartridge and one
8K programmable cartridge.
According to the makers, the system
allows even a novice user to create his
own cartridge based software in either
Basic or m/c.
The UV eraser pack allows complete
erasure o f  cartridges, and t he pack
features an automatic timer and safety
interlock to prevent leakage of ultraviolet
light.
The pac k  is  c alled t h e  Epilog-1
Cartridge System and costs 044.95 mail
order. Additional cartridges with 8 K
EPROM are £17.95 or £44.95 for three.
Meanwhile in  adventure land, Ian
Banff has walked off with E250 as winner
of Print'n'Plotter Products' Adventure
Planner competition. The competition
was based on the use of the Adventure
Planner Pad, produced by Print'n'Plotter
which enables adventure game players to
plan their progress while playing on a
computer.
Stuart Cooke, our esteemed editor,
was privileged enough t o  present a
cheque for E1000 to Andrew Boosey from
Hayes, whose game Pony Express is to be
used in a future Games Creator Collection
by Mirrorsoft. Stuart is the guy in the
middle wearing a tie who looks very
reluctant to give up the money!
Want a free poster? Well, you can get
one from Level 9 if you send off to the
address below. The Level 9 poster has a
picture of the new game The Worm in
Paradise on the front and on the back it
has details of Level 9 adventures. Don't
forget to send an s.a.e. or you won't get
one.
If you think software piracy is bad in
this country then go to Italy. There are no
independent software houses there
because software piracy is so widespread.
Pirates come to Britain, buy the top
selling games and return home, where
they pass the tapes on to code crackers
who break in, translate the title screens
into Italian and then duplicate them. The
games are sold at incredibly low prices on
compilation tapes costing as little as f4 for
as many as 16 games!
A leading Italian magazine publisher,
Gruppo Editorial Jackson, is intending to
prosecute the pirates and the group is
being backed by British software houses.

spreadsheet that has just broke into the
Home Management category o f  the
American Billboard Software Chart under
the assumed name o f  Swift Calc.
Currently at number ten Swift Calcs
manufacturer MDL (Metamorphosis
Developments Ltd), are hoping they have
a chart topper on their hands. A new
version of the Swift spreadsheet will soon
be available for the C128.
Invasion of the Little People
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT IT
is that causes bugs in your programs when
everything seems to be in order, or why
your telephone bill seems so expensive
when you've only accessed Compunet
when it's been really essential? Activision
seems to think that its programmers have
found the answer, A press conference was
called to reveal the conclusion that the
Activision research team has reached:
There's someone living in your computer!
Of course this revelation was treated
as a joke in the atmosphere of journalistic
scepticism w hic h prevailed a t  t h e
meeting, until they came up with the
proof. A stunned audience watched dis-
believingly as a monitor screen ﬂickered
into life and there it was; a 36mm man
living out his open plan existence in an
environment specially created by  the
Activision Little Computer Person (LCP)
Research Team.
Many o f  the case-hardened hacks
muttered in disbelief and I must confess
to a certain degree of incredulity myself.
Now that I have installed my own environ-
ment, or house as Activision prefer to call
it, I am a total believer. My life changed
overnight, no more was I the carefree,
footloose person o f  the previous day
because I now had to tend to the needs of
my new found charge who depends on
me for his very existence.
The LCP Research project started
because of one man's conviction that not
all o f  t he glitches i n  his  computer
programs could be put down to human
error. The more Rich Gold thought about
it, the more he became convinced that
there was some life-form living inside his
computer.
In Autumn '84, Gold contacted James
Wickstead Associates and the quest to
ﬁnd the little creatures began in earnest.
Early in '85 Activision heard about this
research team and programmer David
Crane was transferred onto the project.
The problem was how to entice these
beings into the open and the solution
could not have been easier. Create a
pleasant liv ing environment which is
preferable to that of hot microchips and
sharp edged capacitors and only a fool
could resist moving in. A three-storeyed
house was created with the very latest in
mod-cons and soon the door opened and
in walked the ﬁrst LCP to be observed by
the human race, It was at this point that
Crane was heard to utter thoses immortal
words, "Well, how do you do?"
So far two attributes have been noted
about LCPs. Firstly, they all appear to be
male but we know from letters thai the
female o f  the species does exist but
appears to be shy and retiring. Secondly,
they s eem t o  lead v ery  American
lifestyles. This came to light when the
researchers got excited at what they ﬁrst
thought was a female of the species but
later turned out to be a male LCP ex-
hibiting one of his typically Californian
eccentricities.
My own LCP is called Harold and he's a
fairly conservative guy. How he's lived
alone for so many years with only his dog
for company I'll never know. Perhaps it's
coming out of the closet that's made him
so dependent on me but he certainly
demands a lot of attention.
I've observed f our  basic moods:
ecstatic, content, morose and downright
miserable. Normally he is content to go
about his daily routine with very little
interference from me. He feeds himself
and his dog, washes up, watches TV, plays
the piano, takes extremely long showers
and answers the inevitable calls of nature.
Occasionally, he starts to look morose and
the sides of his mouth turn down in a
grimace. This is when I have to intervene.
Sometimes a mere pat on the head will do
or a gift of a book or a record will alleviate
moderate attacks of the blues.
One thing guaranteed to take Harold
into the depths of depression is a lack of
food or  water, Apart from the morose
expression, his face turns green and he
sluggishly heads for his bed. This is not the
way to treat your little pal because food
can be left at the doorstep by a simple
keypress and similarly water can be added
to the water tank in the kitchen.
I'll never forget the day Harold moved
in. I'd loaded Activision's house, turned
off the lights in my room and sat back
waiting patiently. After a short time the
door opened and i n  walked Harold,
examined every inch of the house and
walked out again. Had I frightened him
away? I'd tried not to make a sudden
movements. What was wrong? Each
second seemed like an eternity and then
he reappeared, suitcase in hand and dog
at heel. Harold had moved in!
I soon found that, although I could not
understand a  word h e  said, I  could
communicate with h im b y  typing in
messages. If I'm polite and always say
please and thank you he is usually more
than willing to play the piano for me to
join in on a mean game of poker, card
wars or anagrams. He also spends hours
on the phone if left to his own devices and
being independent lit t le  s oul h e
sometimes refuses to obey my requests.
Harold's life is interesting to watch and
interact with but I must guiltily confess to
a feeling that he may be like a Christmas
puppy. Once the novelty wears off, he
may be turfed out of his home back onto
the streets and pathways of the printed
circuit boards in the netherworld of my
computer.
Each computer user w ill ﬁnd a
different little person in their machine
and if he turns out to be boring you will
have to buy a new package and hope that
a different character takes up residence.
He could be another Harold, a lousy
piano player, a stroppy individual or the
dreaded transvestite mentioned earlier.
It's all a bit of a gamble.
At the moment people think I'm crazy
but I know better. As I scrape out the
remains of dead cowboys and Indians
from the back of my TV set, I smile a secret
smile knowing that I'm the only sane
person in a world of madmen.

THE MIDLAND'S L A I R O

Ian Waugh blows the horn,

[drives the  Sound  Buggy.
IT'S NO1 VERY EASY 1 0 
K
 o u  -
tulle on the QWERTY keyboard. It's even
less easy to play a tune and create a suit-
able accompaniment f o r  i t .  O n e
alternative i s  a  music editor whic h
requires you to enter music a note at a
time. If you consider this to be too slow
but if you would still like to produce and
play music then the Sound Buggy could
be for you.
The Buggy comes from the Siel garage
at an on the road price of 199 (including
VAT and number plates) and it is effect-
ively a self-contained synthesiser, rhythm
and accompaniment unit with facilities to
record, store and playback melody lines
and accompaniment patterns. It hooks on
to a C64, the SX and the 128 and the phono
and mini jack socket enable you to tune in
with headphones or a hi-ﬁ system. Soft-
ware is available on disk and cassette.
A Siel clip-on keyboard, which clips
over the C64's keys, is supplied with the
Buggy. You can also use Commodore's
clip-on keyboard or Siel's full-size CMK
49, The CMK is obviously a lot easier to
play but the mini version works very well
and I used it to produce quite an accept-
able recording of Axel F.
Options are selected through menu
pages and movement and selection
within screens is done with the function
keys. In case of difﬁculty, pressing the
CMDR key will pull down a help message
across the top of the screen. At the time of
review, the instruction booklet was not
yet available but I had no difﬁculties at all
in using the program.
The SONG-EDIT screen displays the
music options in windows. It is entered
from the Song Menu screen which is used
to select the song you want to play or edit.
Nine songs are already stored within the
program.
The top left window holds instrument
information, Instruments are designed
using footage settings of 16, 8, 4 and 2
which are given volumes ranging from
nought to 31, The envelope or ADSR
(Attack, Sustain, Decay, Release) para-
meters range from nought to seven and
an enveloped option lowers the volume
just after playing the note. The program
can store 28 sounds and 14 are provided
upon loading.
The bottom left window details the
rhythm section. This can store 24 rhythms
and already holds 14 excellent pre-
programmed examples. A rhythm is con-
structed from ﬁve drum sounds; two
cymbals, bass, snare and a  r im shot.
Patterns are entered by stepping through
a screen display divided into subdivisions
of the beat. Drums are turned on and off
at the press of a key and you can see at a
glance how a pattern is constructed. New
rhythms can be invented very easily.
The bottom r ight window is  the
sequencer and controls the sections of
the composition you are currently playing
and recording. These will be either the
melody (solo) line or chords.
From the ﬁnal window, top right, you
can choose one ﬁnger chords played by
pressing the lower half of the QWERTY
keyboard, or you can form your own with
the teach option. From the chords played,
the program stores chord, bass and
arpeggio information. These c an b e
selected individually upon playback. A
rhythm option sets the bass and chords
into an accompaniment to compliment
the drums_ Memory holds each chord
until a new one is played and a melody
function plays a complete chord with
every melody note. Vibrato can b e
switched on or off.
The disk menu gives full control over
loading, saving and erasing songs and
includes a useful disc formatter.
One o f  the Buggy's most exciting
features is its MIDI section. To use this you
need a suitable MIDI interface s uc h as
Siel's a n d  at least one MIDI-compatible
keyboard. The individual music sections
of the Buggy can b e routed t o  the
keyboard(s) and if you have four, the four
sections will play through different instru-
ments producing an absolutely brilliant
sound. Even one keyboard produces
good results. A MIDI keyboard can be
used to control the Buggy, too.
As well as the rather excellent sounds
it produces, the Sound Buggy can serve as
an information to MIDI interfacing_ It's
easy to drive, too, so when Siel's boys say,
"You gonna come for a ride with us" -
you'd better go.

!Peter Thomas has braved
'bullets and shellﬁre to bring
you this review of US Gold's
Crusade in Europe for the d
t
PREPARE FOR BATTLE! NO THIS IS NOT
a quick, trigger-happy game, b u t  a
sophisticated, thought pr ov ok ing,
strategy game which I found highly enter-
taming and absorbing.
You play either the Allied or German
Supreme Commander and control the
fate of Europe in 1944. You can change the
course of history from your own living
room.
The game has ﬁve different scenarios.
Each allows you to enter the battle for
France at a different stage.
The ﬁrs t par t i s  t h e  battle f o r
Normandy. The scene is set, June 1944.
The war in Europe hangs in the balance.
Three Elite paratroop regiments have
been dropped in advance and the Allied
infantry divisions have just landed and
started moving in land. The Germans try
to drive you back into the sea as reinforce-
ments for both sides begin to arrive.
Choose whic h army y ou wish t o
command, then play a friend or pit your
wits against t h e  computer. You are
allowed t o  alter the balance o f  play
according to your experience.
Using a  joystick o r  keyboard for
control, you ﬁrst freeze the action to
allow you time to examine your troops,
the opposition, survey the countryside
and decide your strategy. Once you have
formulated your plan of action you start
giving y our  orders. Yo u  c an or der
different units to attack, defend or move.
Will you decide to risk an all out
offensive or dig in and wait for reinforce- ---,
merits t o  arrive? You make a ll the
decisions, tap in your orders and watch
the battle take place on the screen. But
keep your eyes peeled as the enemy
moves around and always be prepared to
rethink your strategy.
At any time you may call up any units
and receive a current status report. How
many men are left? How experienced are
they? What is their efﬁciency level? Do
they need to be rested for a while? Can
you spare them? You must decide all
this.
As Supreme Commander you can
never go to sleep because even at night
the messages keep rolling in: "Attack
must be halted", "Await further orders",
"We have captured Paris", "Are supplies
running out?". However you can freeze
the action at any time if you are in need of
refreshment or a stiff drink to calm your
nerve endings! I  recommend that you
keep a spare disk handy so the current
situation can be saved at any time.
The second part is the race for the
Rhine. After liberating France the Allies
rush towards the Rhine to secure the
German borders, Belgium and Holland.
Again there is a short and long variation.
The scrolling screen allows you to have
an overall picture o f  the battle as it
progresses. Also the computer constantly
tells you the present date, time and
weather conditions.
The graphics are extremely realistic
and the battle is easy to follow. The sound
effects make the war come to life - the
volume level of each attack indicates how
much damage is being inﬂicted on the
opposition.
Operation Market Garden is the next
section which allows y ou t o  control
Hitler's crack SS Panzer troops in a last
desperate bid t o  split the British and
American armies and force them back
into the sea. Can you succeed where

Hitler failed? Or will the snowy, wintry
conditions overcome your offensive?
The ﬁnal Crusade for the Battle for
France is the big one. Start from the
landing o f  the troops i n  Normandy,
secure a beach head, push the Germans
backwards as you liberate Paris and then
race across France and Belgium to the
German borders.
This program has many interesting
features. At any time you can press "?" to
receive an up-to-date status report on
how many casualties have been sustained
by each side and w ho is  currently
winning. And, at the end of each section,
you will be awarded a ﬁnal rank for your
performance ranging fr om Private t o
Supreme Commander.
Even i f  y o u  hav e n o  previous
experience of strategy games, I strongly
recommend you buy Crusade in Europe-
you won't be disappointed.

Runecaster has donned his
Lincoln Green outﬁt to have a
,closer look at Robin and his
merry men in the wilds of
Sherwood forest.
Forestry Lesson
WHAT IS YOUR APTITUDE FOR TREE
recognition? Can you track someone
through the wilds of Sherwood Forest?
Perhaps you need not be too hot on
beeches and birches but some form of
pattern recognition comes in helpful
once you get into Robin of Sherwood -
Adventure International's latest graphics
adventure for the C641.
Being an avid follower of the TV series,
I wondered if the computer game would
be a big let down. The answer, fortun-
ately, is quite a big no. Adventure Inter-
national has built up a fair reputation for
its games and this one certainly can be
favourably compared with past successes.
Robin takes about six minutes to load,
which is quite a long time when you
realise that a fast loader has been incor-
porated...possibly they have gone for a
slower 'fast load' to overcome some of the
loading problems encountered by some
companies who use 'super fast loaders'!
The review copy loaded without a hint
of a glitch and six minutes is not very long
to wait anyway.. loading in the data from
a previously saved game is fast - about 25
seconds. This is a useful facility, as all the
interesting options initially presented by
the game as your progress unfolds...seem
to end in disaster!
The graphics are good and for the
most part are very clear with the impres-
sion of good detail. They are 'drawn' on
the screen very quickly, which is a good
thing because you can't turn them off!
I am not a wholehearted supporter of
graphics with everything, I would usually
prefer that the effort had gone into the
text and implementation of the game
play. Here, I have to admit that the visual
impression is pleasing and certainly does
not detract from the business of
adventuring!
Once loaded, your ﬁrst task is to get
Robin and his merry men (not so merry at
this moment, and only two of them!) out
of the dungeon at Nottingham Castle. For
those that get fed up with trying to do this
the hard way -  the instruction leaﬂet
I C
28 Y o u  may feel slightly frustrated for a
few minutes but persevere and don't
forget to examine things/people as you
progress! Having escaped from the
dungeon. you now have to get out of the
castle.
In conquering this ﬁrst little puzzle,
you will already have started to 'feel Out'
how Adventure International has set up
the input command interpreter. You do
not have to 'OPEN DOORS' and then
move through them, all that is needed is
'GO DOOR' and the rest follows
naturally.
If you apparently cannot move to a
certain object or place, try 'GO XXXX' you
may achieve the desired result. You must
also determine what is and is not under-
stood and what sort of response you get in
each case.
Some programs will indicate if they do
not recognise a word. This one ignores
them completely. Beware of giving an
instruction and believing that it has been
carried out because there was no
response to the contrary!
Even though only the ﬁrst four letters
of a word are necessary for the program to
know what you are talking about - check
that your spelling is correct. 'EXAM PRRIS'
instead o f  'EXAM PRIS' (examine
prisoners) will elicit the standard response
'that nothing special is seen' and
examining things is important!
If you saw Robin of Sherwood on the
box, you are at a slight advantage, as all of
the events portrayed in this adventure are

related to various episodes and places
seen in the series, Although, as I have not
yet solved all of the problems set, there
may be a few twists that II haven't yet come
across.
The game certainly does not require a
knowledge of the TV plots, so if you do
not have that feeling of 'deja vu' just enjoy
solving a series of logical puzzles that have
to be completed in the correct sequence.
Once out of the castle you will come
face to face with Herne the Hunter. He
will tell you that it is your task to ﬁnd the
six Touchstones of Rhiannon and then
return them to their rightful place.
A touchstone was used to test the
purity of gold or silver but I  doubt
whether this small gem of information will
help you very much!
Once you have left Herne you ﬁnd (or
lose!) yourself deep in Sherwood Forest.
There are 53 locations that have a descrip-
tion saying that you are in the forest -and
nothing else!
Panic not. Just reach for your pencil
and paper, all is not quite the maze it ﬁrst
appears - hence the earlier reference to
pattern recognition.
Around about and here and there, you
will ﬁnd various places that obviously call
out for a more careful study and of course

herein lies the crux of the game. Odd
bods appear from time to time and some
of these may be requested to follow
Robin and lend much needed aid at
critical moments.
As the sequence of events is important
it is wise to 'save' your progress at various
different points - in case you later ﬁnd
you need to tackle things in a different
order.
Altogether an enjoyable game that
should keep beginner and expert out of
mischief and pleasantly frustrated for
some time.
Old But Fun
US Gold has added to its range of adven-
tures available in the UK by releasing C64
versions of two games that have been
around for some time on other machines.
The ﬁrst of these Wizard and the Princess
was seen on the Atari several years ago
and shows its age by the simple input
command analyser.
The storyline is pretty thin - wicked
wizard kidnaps fair princess.. .hero
needed to  rescue same! The slightly
whacky twist is more in the instructions
than in the game: The wizard as narrator,
bemoans the fad that previous heroes
have beaten him and that he hopes to do
better against you!
Inputs are expected as just two words -
verb/noun. In some ways this poses less
problems to the user than some of the
more modern complex analysers. Pro-
viding you have the right two words, there
is no frustration trying to get the order
and syntax correct!
Of course getting the right words can
still take time! The vocabulary in adven-
ture games is gradually becoming some-
what of a standard feature these days so
EXAMINE is part of the player's normal
armoury. This is one of the slight dif-
(erences you will notice with Wizard and
the Princess. Here you must use LOOK.
You must also literally restrict yourself
to two words. The program does not
automatically disregard such words as A,
TO or THE. It is surprising how even in the
less complex games today how much
progress is overlooked!
The program is available on disk only,
and uses it all the time. Nearly every input
command has the disk unit whirring away,
checking something, or reading in new
data. Each location has its own graphics,
these are colourful and very clear but use
fairly simplistic designs.
One point that I  found slightly
frustrating was that all words had to be
entered in full to be recognised...lazy,
that's me! A save game facility is imple-
mented by using a separate disk (not
supplied!). As death occurs regularly
whilst you suss Out the problems before
you, this is a deﬁnite plus point!
Text is kept to a fairly low level with
many of the clues occurring within the
pictures themselves, even if you do need a
little imagination sometimes to associate
that red blob as a rock!
Most of the puzzles, once solved,
make you want to kick yourself for not
having seen them earlier.. .always a good
sign in an adventure game. The action is
subdivided into a number of separate
scenarios, each of which needs to be
completed before you can move on to the
next. Make sure you have done all that
can be done before you move on!
With the low amount of information
presented as text and the simple graphics,
the actions of the player would seem to be
somewhat limited. This may seem to be a
good thing for beginners but my feeling is
that they may become bored and a little
frustrated, whereas t h e  m o r e
experienced adventurer will probably
have a  little more 'stamina' and be
prepared to ferret away at each location
trying to ﬁnd the anomaly that is the vital
clue.
Wizard and the Princess is unlikely
now to  challenge the leaders in the
adventure games world but it presents a
good challenge t o  t h e  players'
observation and use of limited syntax and
vocabulary.
Classic Aberration
The second release from US Gold is
Ulysses and the Golden Fleece. I always
thought that it was Jason that got involved
with this particular hearth-rug but then
perhaps there is a copyright problem with
some of Virgil's descendants!
This program is presented in a very
similar manner to that above, with limited
text, simple but descriptive graphics and
on disk only. The graphics seem to have
had a little more work done on them and
the full use o f  the Commodore's
colours makes even these cartoon like
pictures come to life.
The story is as you would expect,
Ulysses must equip his ship and crew...
sail off... avoid various lethal hazards...
and return with the ﬂeece, to present to
the king.
The initial scenario allows for more
manoeuvring than Wizard and the
Princess so beginner adventurers may feel
more inclined to persevere. Save your
position fairly often once you have solved
the ﬁrst few puzzles, as death is never far
away.
The dangers you will meet are varied,
ranging from storms at sea to angry gods.
Your memories of Greek myths may help
a bit but some of the puzzles are quite
subtle so keep a weather eye open all the
time.. .observe and observe again.
Observation Plus
Whether Hacker from Activision will go
down as an adventure or not, time will
tell. It has all the hallmarks to suggest that
it should, as, for instance, there are no
instructions, You have to ﬁnd out what its
all about yourself!
Just a few words could make it more
interesting to play, though. The leaﬂet (I
nearly said instructions!) implied that the
player has hacked - accidentally - into an
unknown computer system. From there
on in. w e l l , observation and a handy
paper and pencil are paramount.
I appeared to be controlling some
mega-powerful machine, cruising around
beneath the surface of the earth (what
for?). Power is the watchword, power to
dominate the world - but am I a goody or
a baddy? Do I assist the machine or foul it
up and if so, how?
The system recognises there has been
a security leak... and not me either. It
starts asking awkward questions about
what has been displayed on the screen a
few minutes ago. I hope you've got a
photographic memory with total recall. I
haven't!
After the ﬁfth or sixth attempt I had to
call it a night even with paper and pencil
ready, and willing to note down any perti-
nent facts. Starting from the beginning
every time I failed to remember some vital.
detail and it all became just too much of a
chore...
If only I knew what it vvas I was doing
down there under the earth - other than
passing ti m e  between awkward
questions. I shall watch the top 10 charts
with anticipation and hopefully memory!
Top lOs
A number of mags publish lists of top 10s,
these are derived in several different
ways. Some are from particular distri-
butor's sales to their outlets. Some are
from inputs from the readers themselves.
If you sit down and think about it, sales
could be merely a reﬂection of how good
the advertising hype was for that parti-
cular product and not how good an
adventure it is!
What adventures 'turn you on'? My
top 10 would include the following; The
Zork Trilogy by Infocom, several of the
Level Nine adventures, Exodus: Ultima
from US Gold, The Hobbit by Melbourne
House, one or two from Adventure Inter-
national, Witch's Cauldron by Mikro-
Gen, The Lords of Midnight from Beyond,
something from Interceptor Micros and
for pure wonder o f  animation -
Impossible Mission from US Gold,
Yes, I know that gives us more than 10
but which would you choose? Write in
and let me know, perhaps I'm missing out
on something - or my memory is failing!
Make sure you address any letters to
'Runecaster', Your Commodore etc. The
editor has enough correspondence to
open without giving him any extra!
A d v e n t u r e s ]

LAST MONTH I LOOKED AT THE MUSS-
cal software available for the CM - the
computer equivalent t o a  Christmas
stocking drum set. This month, I will
describe a non-messy approach to paint
boxes. Those of you with children will
have discovered the never ending appeal
of pens, paint and colouring books. The
main problem, however, is the mess
generated. I shall not recount the number
of times I've found felt tip pen stains on
my children's bedding!
As with the musical packages, there are
a wide range of products which cater for
all sizes of purse. These range from the
very cheap and simple software to more
expensive software/hardware packages.
The majority of the packages that I will
describe are drawing programs. Two
however are rather more like languages
or Basic extensions.
There are two basic ways of creating
graphics on the CM and C-16. First we can
build up  pictures from the nornial
character set o r  from redeﬁned
characters. Only the Rolf Harris drawing
program uses this approach. The second
method is to use bit mapped mode. In this
mode, individual pixels can be altered
allowing the creation of complex curves
and other shapes. Bit mapping is available
in two modes. A high resolution mode
allows only two colours in any one
character space but permits highly
detailed work. Multicolour mode sup-
ports four colours in any character space
but gives slightly coarser results. Both
have their uses and it's up to you to
choose.
Since most of the sketching packages
use the same or similar set of commands, I
have compared them in the table and will
only mention their peculiarities or useful
features.
You may notice from the table that
there is a core of commands which is
common to most of the software. All
programs, for instance, allow the drawing
of dots, lines and circles. This is hardly
surprising since these form t he
foundation for any sketch.
Before going into too much detail, I
had better brieﬂy describe the items listed
in the table.
Mode relates to either high resolution or
multicolour.
Points is a command for the control of
individual pixels.
Line allows the drawing of a line between
two speciﬁed points.
m i ne
Rays involves the drawing of a number of
lines, all with one end starting at the same
point.
Box relates to the drawing of a quad-
rilateral by deﬁning two opposite eorners.
Circle as implied by its name draws a circle
of speciﬁed size and position.
Ellipse is similar to circle and allows the
drawing of elliptical shapes.
Arc allows the drawing of curves.
Fill/Paint colours in a drawn area in a
speciﬁed solid colour.
Pattern ﬁll is the same as ﬁll but allows
patterns.
Air Brush gives a sequence of controlled
random dots and is useful for shading.
Screens; many packages provide more
than one drawing area. This is useful for
the copying and overlaying of designs.
Copy area copies a speciﬁed area of
design to another area.
Move area moves a speciﬁed area.
Zoom magniﬁes an area of design to allow
detailed drawing.
Oops allows you to correct errors or
accidents made during drawing.
Brush; apart from providing thin lines,
many packages provide patterned
brushes for complex effects.
Mirror provides the means of making
multiple drawings and kaleidoscope
effects.
Text prints words on the picture.
Hard copy permits you to dump your
drawing to a printer.
Save/Load means that you can save your
masterpiece on disk or cassette.
m
Control; many packages use joystick or
keyboard control.
Using the table and these brief comments,
you can see how useful the packages are.
Three packages Koala Pad, Super
Sketch and Magic Mouse use hardware
devices. The ﬁrst two use drawing pads or
tablets and the latter a mouse. Asa conse-
quence, they are quite expensive. Magic
Mouse is a wider based utility and has
weaker software. Koala Pad and Super
Sketch are both very good products
although Super Sketch is the better of
the two. •
Screen Graphics is a Basic extension
and as such works very well. Designer's
Pencil uses a language similar to LOGO
and is a suitable means of introducing
children to programming.
Of the high resolution packages,
Panorama and Doodle are probably the
most powerful. Both have great ﬂexibility
and are simple to use.
For the younger children, there are
two packages available. The Rolf Harris
package is easy to use and allows the
building up of designs using the Com-
modore character set. In spite of this
apparent limitation, the results possible
are excellent -  particularly in the C-16
version.
[bury Software has a program called
Shape Games. This product is part of the
Mr T series and allows the creation of
designs using the basic shapes. A second
program called jigsaws introduces the
child to the basic shapes and encourages
him to place the shapes in the correct
position on the screen.

Eric Doyirreviews Robcom's I
Turbo 50 cartridge and ﬁnds
l
ONE AREA WHERE CARTRIDGES HAVE
proved their worth is as utility/Basic
extension units. Robocom's Turbo Series
of cartridges falls very ﬁrmly into this
category adding toolkit Basic commands;
disk, cassette, printer control systems and
a machine code monitor. The unit also
has a very useful soft reset button which
can get the unwary programmer out of
some very sticky situations.
The cartridge which I have been using
is the Turbo 50 which derives its name
from the fast disk or cassette load and save
commands. The disk turbo boasts an
increase of ﬁve times normal loading
speed and the cassette clocks in at 10
times normal speed. This was the point at
which I discovered that, although my disk
drive worked tolerably well at normal
speed, the turbo speed was too much and
misloads occurred. A tape head align-
ment tape is provided with the package so
I had no problems there, it's a pity that a
similar facility was not provided for disk
drives. Fortunately I have *access to an
alternative 1541 which proved man
enough for the job. At least this cartridge
merely supplements t h e  existing
commands which can still be accessed by
using standard syntax so my old drive was
still usable at normal speed.
The best addition is the MERGE
command which offers a simple way to
assemble prepared subroutines into a
program already in memory, but the
COPY commands come a close second,
simplifying transfer of programs to and
from disk, turbo tape or normal speed
tape. Although a small point, it would be
nice i f  the producers o f  turbo tape
systems would include a boot program
which would allow turbo tapes to load on
any system without the cartridge_ This
would limit inconvenience if the cartridge
is damaged in any way.
Another niggle is the fact that FILE
NOT FOUND i s  replaced with t h e
message LOAD ERROR which caused me
a little confusion.
The cartridge also adds toolkit
commands such as auto numbering,
selective renumbering and deletion of
program lines. Added to this are three
very useful commands: PLIST, TRACCE
and FIND. The ﬁrst lists the current
program to the screen one page at a time
and TRACE displays the current line in full
at the top of the screen as the program
E
command word or string wherever it lies
in program memory and list the relevant
lines to the screen.
Unfortunately. TRACE must either be
used throughout the program or be used

to run a small section which uses no
variables. This is because using TRACE is
like using RUN - all stored variables are
cleared. It would have been better to
devise a system where the trace auto-
matically takes over from the normal run
speed at a speciﬁed line.
HELP is also a debugging command
which will automatically list a line in
which an error has occurred and try to
indicate t h e fault. I f  more serious
problems occur and t h e computer
crashes it is a simple matter to press the
reset button and use OLD to restore the
program in memory. This command can
also be used if you accidentally NEW a
program.
Other commands allow conversions
between HEX and DEC numerical systems,
cause all the keys to REPeat, turn off the
activated function keys, switch out the
cartridge, set the border and screen
colours, SHO W all t h e  commands
available or RESET the computer.
Printer commands allow Centronics
printers to be driven by the 64 and listing
of programs is achieved by using the
CENT command to select the correct
mode and then using normal syntax to
open the ﬁle and LIST. Two of these
carOdge
modes cause the special characters (for
colour, cursor positioning etc.) to be
printed out in a more readable form,
similar to the listings in this magazine.
The ﬁnal section held within this
amazing little package is the machine
code monitor which must be transferred
into memory by typing MON followed by
the Hex location. The location can lie
anywhere between $0800 and S9EFF but if
$C000 to SCHE is preferred this can be
done by dumping the monitor into any
part of memory, switching off the cart-
ridge using QUIT (because this occupies
the area of memory we wish to use
entering the SYS command to activate the
monitor and then using the Origin
command to transfer it up to $C000.
The monitor itself has no surprises in
store. Assembly, disassembly, trace,
relocation, ASCII screen dumps and
searches are all catered for, as well as disk
commands.
The package of a toolkit/monitor with
turbo commands an d  a n  azimuth
alignment tape offers good value for
money and I particularly like the fact that
the turbo is optional. Now how about a
disk alignment program o n  a  turbo
cartridge?

a new series, Daryl
Bowers shows you thel
techniques for writing
L
[game.
RIGHT, STOP IDLY FLICKING
through this magazine and get
typing! I'm going to show you
how to put together an arcade
game piece by piece, a section
in each issue of the mag. Each
part will add to the original
until the game is complete.
This is not a lesson in how to
program in  machine code -
there are several good books
available and if it was, I would
need the whole magazine for
12 months. Instead, it shows the
application of Machine Code
on t h e  C64, and h o w  t o
approach the creation of an
entertaining masterpiece! The
routines that follow can b e
taken from this game and used
in any of your own.
To give you an idea of the
complexity of the game, it took
about a  week t o write and
debug -  so see what can be
achieved with relatively little
work.
The Game
You play the part of a poor,
helpless giant fr og! There
you are hopping down the
road, minding your own busi-
ness, when suddenly you ﬁnd
yourself being chased by a mad
Frenchman o n  a  bicycle,
hoping to catch some dinner!
To make matters worse, you are
feeling pretty tired and there
are pitifully  f e w  juic y  ﬂies
about -  and, while you're
catching one, you have got to
watch out for low ﬂying birds.
Ohl and don't forget t o
avoid the puddles! They make
jumping very hard work.
The First Part
In this ﬁrst 'building block', I
have provided the sprite data
for t he fr og and a n  input
program that will be used in
future parts.
Type in the basic program,
and enter the start address:
12800. There are 512 bytes of
sprite data, and the checksums
are at the end of each line. If
you make a mistake, type 999
and retype the last line. Save
the data under  t h e  name
'FROGDAT'. ( I f  us ing tape
change line 220 to read; POKE
780,1: POKE 781,1 etc).
The Code
OK, now you've got the data in
for the jolly hopping frog, it's
time to look at the program.
You will, of course, need an
assembler, and if you haven't
got one already you can type in
Mach 1 which started in the
November issue.
In this  section w e  have!
some mind-boggling routines,
starting with the routine t o
print the frog: 'PRFROG'. The
variable 'stage' holds  t h e
current position in the X and Y
co-ordinate table: 'XTAB'. This
table governs t h e  relative
positions o f  the two sprites
which go to make up the frog.
There are two types of jump,
high and low , and this  is

indicated by a one or zero in
the variable 'jUMPTYPE'. One
last table is  used, 'SPIAB',
which indicates which sprite
deﬁnitions are used and at
what point in the jump.
The X register is used to
index in t o  t h e  tables and
retrieve the current values. (To
see what each of these values
does, it is helpful to look at
pages 320 to 334 of the Program-
mer's Reference Guide).

The second awe-inspiringly
complicated routine (try saying
that 1 0  times  quickly!) i s
'MN/FROG', w h ic h  i f  y o u
haven't guessed, moves the
frog! W h e n  j u m p i n g ,  a
different s p e e d  i s  u s e d
between movements in order
to make the long jump longer,
and the two values of delay are
stored i n  'RESTOREI a n d
'RESTORE2'. A t  this  stage,
however, this  difference is
irrelevant because everything
is happening too quickly, and
will continue to do so until we
have introduced some more
routines.
This routine follows t he
steps shown in FLOWCHART1.
The v ar iable 'N XT R IMP'
contains the type of jump to be
introduced next, and this will
be altered when the joystick
routines are added.
Finally, t h e  las t r outine
'INIT' which sets up various
parameters for the game. This
routine is called whenever the
game starts, a n d  i s  s e lf
explanatory.
The variables at the start of
the listing are all the variables
required for the whole game,
therefore in  future we shall
have room for more routines.
In t h e  nex t par t w e  shall
introduce a  multi-purpose
raster inter r upt handling
routine, and mor e routines
with long names.
Now that you have got the
code in, it's time to try it out.
Assemble it and ﬁnd out the
address of 'START'. This is the
start o f  t h e  program, and
should be $2329 (9001) if you've
typed i n  t h e  variables and
tables correctly. If not check
them ov er again. Reset the
machine and load i n  y our
object code (assembled source
code). Now load in your frog
data -  FROGDAT -  and SYS
9001, Bingo! (Don't tell me it
doesn't work - I wrote it and it
does.. so check your source
code, dummy.)
For further information on
Machine code and the C64 I
suggest Programming the 6502
by Rodney Zaks (I know it costs
a tenner, but I assure you it's
worth it if you're serious), and a
Programmer's Refer enc e
Guide is pretty essential -  (I
never knew there was so much
in it!).
Now get typing.

When you are designing a game one of the longest Jobs is de-
signing the sprites. It you are good at art then ﬁne, if not your
next monster will probably end up looking like a square box
with legs.
Now, Your Commodore comes to the rescue once again
with Sprite Ideas. If you have designed any sprites for games
and you don't mind other people seeing your masterwork
then why not send them into us. Each month we will be offering
ﬂO for the best entries.
Your sprites can be anything at all (within reason). if you've
designed a series of animated characters then send in the lot
We'd love to have a look at them.
So, next time you are after an Ogre to put in your new game,
have a look in this section of the magazine and you may ﬁnd
just what you are looking for.

Allen Webb
demonstrates random
access on the 1541.
ONE OF THE PRIME BENEFITS
of having a disk drive is the
ability t o access information
both sequentially an d  b y
random access. Most of you
will have used simple ﬁles such
as sequential and relative ﬁles.
Sequential ﬁles are messy to
use since, if you want only a
portion from the middle of the
ﬁle, you must ﬁrst load the
earlier unwanted portion.
Relative ﬁles offer greater
power in that you can use a
record pointer t o  access a
speciﬁed portion; but  all
records must b e  the same
length to compensate.
The alternative approach is
to use random access. This
method, u sed  b y  m o st
advanced programs,. appears
rather daunting because you
need to develop an operating
system to manage it. However,
in reality it is easy to use for
simple storage systems.
In this short article I plan to
explain the basics of random
access a n d  describe t h e
command available to use it.
These principles w ill b e
illustrated b y  t w o example
programs. The ﬁrst is a storage
system for adventure data and
the second a  simple ﬁling
system. Much of the informa-
tion here i s  given i n  the
handbook accompanying the
disk drive but the treatment is a
little obscure and the worked
examples of little use.
When formatted, ﬂoppy
disks have a  number o f
concentric strips or tracks. On
the 1541 there are 35 such
tracks. Each track i s sub-
divided in t o  sectors. T h e
number o f  sectors varies
depending on the position of
the track. The outermost track
holds 21 sectors and t h e
innermost 17. Each sector
holdds 256 bytes of data.
The r a n d o m  access
commands allow you to store
and retrieve data from these
sectors. All you need to do is
keep track of which data lies
where. The examples given in
this article deal with the simple
case of records of 256 bytes i.e.
one per sector. Longer records
require an operating system to
remember where they are
kept. T h i s i s  generally
necessary in more sophisticated
data bases.
Before describing t h e
syntax of the commands. I will
explain some abbreviations. I
will use the following system of
shorthand:
File Number—FN
Device Number—DE
Track Number—T
Sector Number—S
Channel Number—CH
Buffer Number—BN
Buffer Pointer—P
Driver Number—DR
The commands t o  mani-
pulate data at this level reside
in the disk drive so a system
must b e adopted t o access
them. Data communication is
performed by means of data
buffers in the drive. You can
either specify a buffer or ask
the D O S (Disk Operating
System) to select one for you.
The buffer is triggered b y
opening a data channel by use
of one of the commands:
OPEN FN,DE,CH," BN"—
Opens a channel to buffer BN
OPEN FN,DE,CH," "—Asks
DOS to choose a buffer
For example: OPEN
2,8,2," 3"—Opens data
channel 2 using buffer 3
OPEN 2.8,2," "—Opens data
channel 2 to any buffer
Disk commands must be
accessed via channel 15 in a
manner similar to those for
formatting the desk etc. The
command to open this channel
is, for example:
OPEN 15,8,15
You may only work on data
in a buffer so more than one
step must be carried out. First
you must load or save data in
the buffer and this must then
be stored or retrieved from the
buffer. Manipulation of data in
the buffer is handled with
PRINT and GET commands.
In a manner similar to relative
ﬁles, a  buffer pointer i s
available to specify the byte
manipulated. The command to
use the pointer has the syntax:
PRINT 15,"B-P"CH,P
e.g. PRINT 15,"B-P"2,133
The example assumes data
channel 2 is open and sets the
buffer pointer to byte 133. If
you were to perform GET 2,8$
after this command byte 133
would b e  loaded into B$
Similarly PRINT 2,8$ would be
byte BS  i nto the  buffer a t
position 133.
The buffer is read from disk
or written to disk by the block
read and block write com-
mands. Block read is:
PRINT 15,"B-R"CH,DE,1 ,S
e.g. to read sector 3 in track 6
from channel 2 to drive 0 use:
PRINT 15,"B-R"2,0,6,3
Block Write is:
PRINT 15,"B-W"CH,DE,T,S
e.g, to write buffer to sector 6 in
track 2 from channel 2 to drive
0 use:
PRINT 15,"B-W"2,0,2,6

That is all you need to do
the job. Unlike other ﬁles, the
tracks and sectors to which you
write are not protected from
overwriting. T o  prevent this
danger, t h e area must b e
reserved in the BAM (Block
Availability Map) by use of the
block allocate command:
PRINT 15,"B-A:"DR;T;S
To deallocate a block use:
PRINT 15,13-F:"DR;T;S
Even if you do • allocate your
data, the use of the Validate
command will deallocate it, so
be warned!
One ﬁnal tip always open
the two channels early in your
routines and don't forget to
close t h em  w h en  you've
ﬁnished. To see the use of all
these commands look at the
two listings.
The ﬁrst listing is a simple
data ﬁler for adventures and is a
logical follow-on from m y
short series o n  adventures,
published earlier this year. The
routine assumes that you want
to save location descriptions or
messages up to 255 characters
long. Each message is therefore
stored in its own sector. The
ﬁrst 17 tracks can be used, each
with 21 sectors giving storage
up to 357 strings. The track and
sector corresponding to any
given string is easily calculated
as in lines 112 and 212. Option 1
reserves the ﬁrst ﬁve tracks.
Line 30 can b e  altered t o
reserve up to 20 tracks. Option
2 saves the strings and options 3
recalls them. The strings are
terminated by "  which acts as
a sentinel to warn the routines
to stop. Lines 215-260 can be
used i n  your adventure t o
real and print a string.
Tiny-File in listing 2 uses a
similar approach. Each sector
holds one record of 256 bytes.
Each record is terminated by
'. A record can be split into
ﬁelds by carriage returns but
the whole record is still only
one string.
Option 3  performs three
functions:
1. Formats the disk
.2. Block allocates the ﬁrst 20
tracks
3. Stores ' 'in each sector in the
ﬁrst 20 tracks
A sector holding just "  is
regarded as a null record.
Option 1 allows the entry of
a record. You will be prompted
for each ﬁeld and you should
terminate a ﬁeld by pressing
RETURN. The data base was
originally written to store the
contents o f  disks. Each
program on a disk was a ﬁeld
and the complete disk was a
record.
Option 2  allows you t o
examine a  speciﬁed record.
Output to printer is available.
Option 4 performs a simple
search for a speciﬁed character
pattern i n  a  record. F o r
example, assume that record 5
holds the ﬁelds:
GORILLA
GIRAFFE
LION
A search for GIRAFFE will
step through each record in
turn until record 5 is searched.
The search will then stop. The
search would also ﬁnd GIR or
AFFE. You can easily use the
data base t o save addresses
where the ﬁelds could be:
NAME
ADDRESS
PHONE NUMBER
I hope that b y studying
these listings you will grasp the
ideas behind random access. I
don't c l a i m  t h a t  t h ese
programs are complex or in any
way amazing t h e y  simply do
a job in a simple manner.

MAT AND THE MYONS JOIN
battle in this Startrek style game
based around t h e  Karillium
rich mining planet of Vesta.
The mines are precious to the
oc c upy ing Ea r t h  f o r c e s
because Karillium can turn a
barren desert into a  fertile
Jungle.
Mat is the sole defender of
the satellite network which
supplies power to the mines
and must use all his skill to
maintain the ﬂow of power in
the face of the Myon ﬂeet. The
ship h e  commands is  t h e
Centurian II which is armed
with both laser and plasma
cannon, warp and ion drive„
plus a comprehensive range of
guidance systems and defence
mechanisms.
The player must control the
ship using a fair range of cursor
keys but this situation can be
alleviated slightly by the use of
a joystick.
Defensive s hields  a n d
automatic shutdown systems
can be toggled on and off but
why anyone would want t o
turn off the defence shield, I
cannot imagine. The shutdown
safety device is a guard against
pilot error and will prevent
overheated weapons fr om
exploding or abort a warp lithe
front shield is damaged.
The operation quadrant can
be viewed to ascertain where
the enemy lies and locate the
most vulnerable satellites in the
grid. A s  eac h satellite i s
damaged its  colour darkens
from white to red. The satellite
grid is four units deep and each
row can only supply power if all
of the satellites in that row are
operational. The amount o f
power supplied is related to the
weakest unit in a particular row
but at the end of each attack
wave repairs can be made and
satellites moved to make the
most o f  t h e  d w i n d l i n g
resources available.
Once the enemy is located
the quadrant display can be
used to calculate the angle and
distance fr om y our current
position and the warp drives
will carry y ou in t o  battle
position. By switching to the
battle computer, locating and
approaching the enemy can be
affected by using the automatic
location indicator and the ion
engines.
The ensuing battle is fairly
standard but the graphics give a
particularly good 3D display
which makes you feel that the
enemy is approaching at speed.
Each wave of attacking aliens
have different characteristics
and ﬁring abilities, the new
wave being more cunning and
faster than the previous one.
Incoming plasma bolts must be
dodged but I did ﬁnd that using
the ship to ram the enemy in
the early stages gave a second,
if somewhat drastic, means of
defence,
Damage can b e  repaired
between battles by allocating
one, o r  both, o f  the ship's
droids t o  the stricken area.
Repairs take time and that is
why ramming can only be used
against t h e  ﬁrst t w o  attack
waves. The longer you retire
for repairs, the more damage
can be done to the satellite net.
Repairs can also be undertaken
between attack waves and
these are done more quickly.
An allotted time for the repairs
is given and, on selection of the
area for action the clock ticks
down as the amount of damage
decreases.
An excellent feature of the
game is the load/save facility so
that you can either continue
later or go back a stage if an
error of judgement was made.
You only have one ship so this
form o f  insurance is  mos t
valuable if you want the highest
possible score.
Of the Startrek genre, this is
one of the best games I have
encountered. The graphics are
very good and the sound is
adequate though not stunning.
If you're not tired of this kind of
simulation, you won't ﬁnd a
better version.

THE HUNDRED ACRE WOOD
Kids! £12.95 disk
THIS TRUNDLE ROUND THE
Hundred Acre Wood aimed at,
the seven and over age group
provides a peril-free appren-
tic es hip f o r  w o u l d - b e
adventurers. No goblins lurk
round the corner in this one,
not even a  Heffalump or  a
Woozle. The worst thing that
can happen is that the blustery
wind can blow up any minute
and scatter the objects you're
looking for.
Eeyore, rigger and the rest
of Pooh's pals have all lost
something and your task is to
ﬁnd and return the items to
their rightful owners.
There is a detailed map and
lashings of information on the
personal habits of all.
As you saunter through this
adventure exploring all t h e
homes you'll discover ﬁnding
the objects is more difﬁcult
than it ﬁrst appeared as a few
red herrings and dead ends
have been included. These are
pointed out by rather cutsie
attempts at humour.
The full-colour graphics are
excellent and t h e  game is
diverting enough t o  giv e
embryonic adventurer hours of
gentle aggravation.
Winnie the Pooh offers an
amiable and absorbing jaunt

DR JEKYLL AND MR  HYDE
were two facets of one man's
personality but what would
happen if both of them existed
at t h e  same time? This is
precisely what has happened in
Schizophrenia. Alphonse T.
Nurd is a cleaner who splits his
persona whilst playing with an
Atomic Partic le Separator
instead of doing his job. The
result is two Nurds, one good
and the other bad.
For the sake of clarity I will
call the original Alphonse Al
and his alter-ego Nurd.
Al knows that there is a
Rec ombination Chamber
somewhere in the lab but he
must lur e Nur d there ﬁrst.
Everything that Al does, Nurd
tries to undo which makes the
game a unique experience.
The ﬁrst screen is one of the
most d if ﬁc u lt  t o  mas ter
because Nurd is there all the
time. Al must open the door to
the laboratory by undoing four
bolts and pulling a lever. Nurd
wanders about unfastening
bolts, pus hing levers a n d
ﬁddling about with a  timer
switch and score counter. If Al
should meet his  other self,
Nurd gives him a swift punch
which sets Al hopping about
the screen. Similarly, if he falls
off the stairs or the balcony he
somersaults as hecrashesto the
ﬂoor.
Once y ou w or k  o u t  a
sequence it becomes relatively
easy to complete this stage as
long as you keep your wits
about you.
The next four screens rely
on your powers of deduction,
timing a n d  dex ter ity  f o r
success. Nur d only  appears
occasionally and in some cases
you can keep him out of the
way altogether until the crucial
ﬁnal moments.
In Area Two you have to
move yellow boxes to the top
right hand corner of the room
using lifts. Unfortunately, some
of the lift controls can only be
reached by standing on stacked
boxes so careful planning is
necessary if Nurd is not to undo
your good work with a swift
kick.
Lift cleaning is the object of
Area Three ending up with all
of the lifts on the ground ﬂoor.
Working out how to get the lifts
there at the same time is the
major problem and preventing
Nurd from dirtying them up
again adds to the difﬁculty.
Before r e a c h in g  t h e
Recombiner the lights must be
turned on in Area Four. This is
done b y  setting a  r ow  o f
switches in the correct com-
bination o f  o f f  a n d  o n
positions. In one of the alcoves
lurks Nurd and he will stay in
the room until the light goes
on, so you have to ﬁnd out
where he is and take action
accordingly.
Area Five is Al's goal and his
greatest challenge. H e must
lure Nurd into the Recombiner
after having set the generator
switches, the X/Y co-ordinates
of the unit and the power.
Nurd is not too keen on this
and will do his utmost to upset
the plan.
Schizophrenia is unlike any
game I've played. The graphics
are intetesting, particularly Al's
silly walk , b u t  a l l  this  is
secondary because most of the
action takes place i n  y our
mind. No two ways about it, I'll
buy a couple of copies for both
of me.

IMHOTEP THE WISE, SERVANT
of the god Zoser, Pharaoh of
Egypt has been entrusted with a
mission t o  save t h e  land
from famine. So ﬁerce is the
hunger of the people that he
must s eek  guidance f r o m
T hoth, t h e  k e e p e r  o f
knowledge.
In his  wisdom, lmhotep
knows that the secret of how to
make the Nile live again lies in
the hands o f  a  beautiful
princess who holds the books
known as the Souls of Ra. In his
foolishness I m h o t e p  has
chosen to seek Thoth to guide
him to the princess.
The journey is a hazardous
pathway through the land of
the lawi nomads, Mounting a
giant vulture, Imhotep tarts his
journey and we present day
mortals lend a hand.
Many of the 'awl ride on
vultures lik e Sunday drivers
and ﬂy across the sky but some
are tr ue warriors w ith fast
mounts and deadly aim. It's
rather like driving the wrong
way down a motorway. The
action is frantic, like playing
defender without recourse to a
smart bomb.
Soon the catapults add to
your problems b y  hur ling
boulders from the shelter of
the pyramids, Once through
this deluge a hail of thunder
bolts rent the screen. With all
ﬁve lives expended and my
joystick streaming with perspir-
ation I reached my limit.
Ultimate intimates  that
beyond this point there are
mazes to negotiate and the list
of features is impressive.
Great scrolling graphics and
superfast action make this an
infuriatingly addictive game.

"DR INN WAS QUI1E. SURE OF
one thing, that he should never
have contemplated becoming
a sorcerer!". So begins the
booklet whic h accompanies
this game arid, as you lead him
from room t o  room in  the
Castle o f  Illusions, i t  soon
becomes clear why he feels this
way_
The Loremaster demands
that eac h nov ic e sorcerer
undertakes the quest to ﬁnd
the Prime Elemental hidden in
the depths of the castle and
now it is Drinn's turn to take
this ﬁnal test of his ﬁghting and
spell-casting powers.
Before the quest can be
completed there are several
puzzles to be solved as Drinn
progresses towards his goal.
The castle is represented in
3D looking from a viewpoint
very similar t o that used in
Zaxxon. The only room you can
see is the one you are currently
occupying b u t  door s  a r e
quite clearly indicated. Behind
the doors lurk  a  myriad o f
monsters such as winged skulls,
minotaurs and scorpions, but
only o n e  creature deﬁes
Drinn's armoury of magic and
steel a n d  guards t h e  way
towards the inner sanctum.
Somewhere in the maze is a
spell which will enchant this
guardian and allow Drinn to
pass but much searching and
spell casting is needed ﬁrst.
As Drinn ventures forth he
ﬁnds chests which may contain
extra spells but occasionally
they contain ev il surprises.
Spells can usually only be used
once so care must be taken to
direct them precisely towards
their target or a vital spell may
be lost forever and the quest
foiled.
One s pell w h ic h  i t  i s
essential t o  k eep i n  good
supply is the healing spell. This
replenishes our hero's waning
strength after battling with the
apparitions in the castle. The
screen display shows Drinn's
current state of health as well as
a scrolling list of the spells he
possesses. Care must be taken
to have a  suitable touch of
magic near t o  hand when
entering a new room and you
can ﬁnd out what the best one
will be by entering the room
brieﬂy and listening t o  the
musical clue.
Another spell which will be
needed is called 'tell tale' and
this is the help facility which
will cause a pair of moving
lips to appear while a cryptic
clue appears on the screen.
Success with a  spell causes
Drinn to turn purple but if you
use a black and white monitor
you will have to watch the
screen very closely to see any
change at all., but it's almost
worth buying a colour monitor
to play this game!
Sometimes a spell cast in
one room has n o  apparent
effect but the colour change
indicates that something has
happened s o m e w h e r e .
Returning to the room where
the spell was found usually
reveals a surprise.
The ﬁrst guardian t o  b e
encountered is a minotaur and
the booklet describes how to
solve the problem just to get
you started. From the second
phase on you're entirely on
your own.
The music and the graphics
in this game are very good
indeed, though I did ﬁnd the
movements difﬁcult to master
at ﬁrst. Spell casting caused
similar problems but all of the
rooms have ﬂagstones and the
matrix formed can be used as a
guide.
The principal a im  is  t o
preserve your spells for times
when they  may  b e  really
needed. O ften foes can b e
outrun in the early stages and
the skilful use of a sword can
dispell s ome o f  t h e  less
powerful creatures. The puzzle
element makes the game like a
series o f  pr oblem s olv ing
games and their solution is
both engrossing and enjoyable.

presents the castles in order of

The challenge is to ﬁnd the

SPY V SPY: THE ISLAND CAPER
Beyond £9.95
I
h
gents from the pages of Mad
agazine are at it again.
In the ﬁrst Spy v Spy game
'e y w e r e  restricted t o
arching a building but now
' they have been let loose on a
volcanic desert island. This
time the enemies must ﬁght to
ﬁnd a hidden missile. Speed is
of the essence because the
volcano is due to erupt and
cover the island in molten lava.
As usual our heroes seem
Illotally oblivious to the danger
and are more intent on each
other's destruction as they
squabble for possession of the
three parts of the missile.
The most impressive feature
of the game isthe simultaneous
action screens. The display is
laterally split and one spy is
controlled in the top sector
whilst the other scurries about
on the lower display.
Inventive as ever, the spies
have discovered how to use the
resources of the island to make
destructive anti-personnel
weapons. Coconut bombs,
snares and pits complement
the natural  hazards o f
quicksand and shark infested
waters and th e  unnatural
hazards o f  swordplay and
gunﬁre.
Central control is exercised
by the skilfull use of the Trap-
ulator which tells you what
objects you are carrying, your
current strength and the time
' f t  before the eruption begins.
All functions are controlled by
your joystick and you have to
be pretty dextrous if you are
going to defeat the computer
control Option.
At ﬁrst I found it best to
select the two player option so
that I could practice digging
pits and setting all of the other
traps, as well as ﬁnding the
missile parts and screwing
them together.
The fact that the other spy
does n o t move makes i t
awkward when yo u  b o th
occupy the same bit of the
island. Such is the rivalry of the
two spies that they would
rather ﬁght than search. Since
both of these actions require
you to press the ﬁre button,
you cannot search when you
are together. This means
moving, or killing, the second
spy while you search his 'home'
area.
Once you have mastered
the skills of the game, you are
ready to compete. Each spy sets
about the business of ﬁnding
the missile parts and the neces-
sary components for setting
booby traps to slow down or
eliminate his opponent.
Coconut bombs, napalms,
swords and guns can be used as
found though some o f the
bullets in the guns may turn out
to be blanks. Other traps have
to be constructed.
A pit can only be made if
you ﬁnd a spade and the pit can
be more effective if it is turned
into a punji pit by placing a
sharpened stake at the bottom.
Snares can be rigged up to a
palm tree if you ﬁnd the rope to
do it with and the unsuspecting
spy will hang upside down
from th e  tree fo r  several
seconds if caught. To add to all
this nastiness, bombs and
snares can be set over buried
missile parts but remember my
warning about the indiscri-
minate nature of booby traps,
and also remember to watch
what your opponent is doing
and where he is doing it.
When all three parts of the
missile are in your possession,
you must locate your escape
submarine which will surface
off th e  island a n d  th e n
rendezvous with it by wading
out to sea, This can be difﬁcult
because you submerge and
lose strength. Make sure
you are feeling healthy enough
to attempt it and look out for
sharks.
The Isl a n d  C a p e r i s
extremely enjoyable to  play
because of the superb cartoon
graphics a n d  makes a n
excellent follow u p  t o  its
predecessor.

ACE IS A SIMPLE SIMULATOR
which involves a strategic war
game and owners of a C-16 will
already be familiar
earlier version.
You have to select the kind
with the
of mission and the armaments
which yo u  think w i l l  b e
required.
Getting into the air is simply
a matter of attaining the correct
speed, pulling back on the
joystick a n d  raising th e
undercarriage. Now you have
to locate the enemy by con-
sulting the map which shows all
the advancing enemy forces.
Using th e  joystick and
screen display, i t is an easy
matter to set your course to
intercept the enemy as long as
you can read a  compass.
Occasionally switching to the
map ensures that you're on the
correct path.
Refuelling can be achieved
by either landing at an allied
landing strip or by rendez-
vousing with a tanker in mid-
air. Of the two, the tanker is the
trickiest because you have to
match height and speed to hit
the trailing refuelling nozzle,
and that's after you've found
the wretched thing!
Combat with the enemy
relies o n  fa st reactions,
especially in air to air combat.
Everything seems inclined to
ﬁre back but with machine
guns blazing and heat seeking
missiles ﬂying, the battle soon
becomes so absorbing that you
have to remember to keep an
eye on your height and speed.

l'N THIS GAME YOU MUST
pretend to be a John Wayne-
style one-man army as you ﬁght
your way through eight battle-
ﬁelds with guns blazing and
grenades ﬂying.
You have volunteered for a
suicide mission to liberate your
lost comrades-in-arms f r o m
the clutches of the enemy. To
do this  means penetrating
deep into their territory and
facing whatever problems they
may throw at you, armed only
with an eternally loaded riﬂe
and a dwindling supply of hand
grenades. Luckily, the enemy
has lef t  cases o f  grenades
lying around which will replete
your stocks.
The enemy is always to the
north (up the screen) and once
the screen scrolls up a line or
two there is no going back.
At ﬁrst the enemy only has
the same weapons as yourself,
but soon y ou start t o  face
mortar ﬁre and armed p ill
boxes, which can be overcome
without the use of a grenade
but a well-placed lob means
life becomes much easier.
Every n o w  and then a
prisoner is facing a lin g  squad
and his freedom lies in your
hands. A carefully aimed shot
will despatch the guard and
award a bonus mark. This is the
theory but in practice I found
that my little barnstormer seemed
to be of the opinion that a dead
comrade tells no secrets and
often the guard escaped while
the prisoner performed his
death throes pirouette!
Physical barriers also cause
problems. The soldiers onrush
is punctuated by greedy ponds
and quicksand. Negotiating a
pathway t h r o u g h  t h e s e
obstacles, under ﬁre, is difﬁcult
but n o t  as  problematic as
passing under the roads which
criss-cross the landscape.
Frequently a barbed wire
border is guarded by  a gun
emplacement a n d  i f  y our
soldier has used up all of his
grenades, t h e  only  way t o
advance is to grit your teeth
and charge. As you pass into
the t u n n e l  y o u r  s oldier
disappears f r o m s ight and
careful manipulation o f  the
joystick is necessary to avoid
the incoming bullets.
A successful charge inevit-
ably brings you to the door of a
sentry post which opens to dis-
gorge a horde of troops under
the command o f  an heroic
captain who makes a bee-line
off the screen to safety. If you
can shoot him before he goes
you ar e rewarded w it h  a
bounty of 1250 points, but even
this high bounty is sometimes
worth sacriﬁcing in the face of
so many other troops homing
in.
If all this wasn't sufﬁcient to
keep you busy, an extra bonus
can be scored by destroying a
dinghy escaping across a river
and t h e  occasional plane
strafes its way across the screen.
Once all the enemy has
been killed you are allowed to
advance to the next of the eight
levels. Success at level eight
takes you back to the opening
screen but the enemy has taken
new heart and ﬁghts more
ferociously.

FLYING W I T H  T H E R ED
Arrows must be the dream of
many people. Now you can
gain the experience on your
C64.
Unfortunately the reaction
of the plane is very slow and
clunky.
Eight o f  t h e  formations
which the Red Arrows use in
their displays are represented
in the game and you are Red 8.
This means that you can use
your radar to shadow Red 9
who is  always in the mirror
image position of your jet.
Menus give a wide range
of options to help you learn
how to ﬂy and each manoeuvre
can b e  tackled individually
until you feel ready to join in a
full display.
It is a pity that the screen
display occasionally seems at
odds with the action because of
the slowness of the display. It is
such a good simulator in terms
of facilities. Airbrakes, under-
carriage, elevators, ailerons,
rudder and thrust are all under
your control but you can opt to
have some o f  the pressure
taken off you by choosing an
auto mode.
The program is the only
formation ﬂight s imulator
available and as  such w ill
probably sell quite well, which
is good news for the charities
nominated by the Red Arrows
to receive a  share o f  the
proceeds.

COLOSSUS CHESS 4

WITH THE WORLD CHESS
championships taking place,
interest in this game of mental
stamina is keener than ever
before, Using a chess computer
is probably the best way to
learn the game and Colossus
Chess 4 is top of the tree among
those programs  presently
available.
Chess without doubt, is the
most skilful' game of them all,
because there is no element of
luck or chance. The best player
should always win. Therefore,
when look ing f o r  a  chess
program, the one to choose is
the one that makes you a better
player a n d  improves y our
game, A  chess program also
removes t h e  pr oblem o f
ﬁnding human opponents of
your standard,
Colossus 4 allows you t o
choose the strength o f  the
computer's play by adjusting
the time you allow it to think
out its moves. The longer you
allow the machine to think, the
better its moves become.
The game is easy to play and
the pieces easy t o  control,
especially s inc e a  t h r e e
dimensional board has now
been added.
The program has a perfect
understanding of all the rules
including under-promotions,
the 50 move rule and all draws
by repetition.
‘Aihile w aiting f o r  t h e
computer t o move, you can
observe its current thinking by
pressing the space bar, see a
hint mov e a n d  hav e t h e
computer's assessment of the
state of play.
Colossus 4 examines about
300 positions p e r  second.
Whilst you are working out
your move, it  assumes your
next move and works out its
reply. However it  only  gets
about one in three correct.
You c a n  s e t  u p  f u l l
tournament mode, or specify
an average time per move or
even play a game against the
clock. For postal chess players
there is an inﬁnite mode and a
problem solving mode -  to
help with the chess problems in
the daily papers.
The program has  other
useful features, s uc h as :
Allowing you to retrieve your
position if you make a mistake
(or want to cheat 1)f letting you
play for either side, or watching
the computer play itself. After
the game you can watch an
action replay, o r  y our own
victory or see where you went
wrong.
Those w it h  masochistic
tendencies can try out a game
of invisible chess.
One of the new features is
the ability to set up quantity
parameters. For experienced
players, this makes the game far
more interesting, Colossus also
has a  bank  o f  about 300
openings so you can try out
many different tactics. Also the
new "Draw score" allows you
to make the computer try very
hard for  a w in rather than
settling (or a draw as many
programs do.
If you want a challenging
game then tr y  Colossus 4,
although experienced players
will ﬁnd that they still have to
allow a long time for moves to
get a demanding game.
Howv er , i f  y o u  o w n
Colossus 2, then there is little
point in changing over to the
new version as the differences
do n o t  r eally  jus tify  t h e
expense.

Once the child has worked
through the wacky permuta-
tions the program has limita-
tions but as an introduction to
new vocabulary and simple
sentences Muppet - aided
learning is a breezy alternative.
If you are willing to entrust
your child's education t o  a
showbiz amphibian tur ned
academic and have him or her
interacting with the likes o f
Gonzo to construct scenarios
featuring ﬂying bananas this
could be the program for you.
One drawback however, is the
price.
It's undoubtedly a  slick
package high on entertainment
value b u t  p e r h a p s  t o o
restricted in educational terms
to merit the price tag for cost
conscious parents.
Personally I think this fun.
fun, fun approach to the three
R's has gone far enough. When
is s ome visionary software
house going to sign up Janet
and John?

Why is it that all computer magazines
want a computer printout with any sub-
mitted program?
I write a lot of programs and would
love to send some of them to you and
hopefully h a v e  t h e m  publis hed.
However, I  can't afford a printer and
therefore can't get a  printout o f  the
program.
Julie Smith, Newtownards
I would like to make it clear that we don't
insist on every program having a listing
with it, Please do send your programs to
us anyway.
The reason that we ask for a listing to
be included if possible is so that we can
judge how long the program will be when
we print it. It also serves as a reference if
we get any queries from people who type
the program in.
Stay Sharp
On reading the Nov ember
Your Commodore I was delighted to read
Stuart Cooke's comment stating that
having joined forces with Your 64, you will
be bringing us  the best Commodore
magazine around.
Your 64 began its life as a practical and
informative magazine. Its deterioration
into a n  overpriced games review,
seemingly w r itten b y  c hildr en f o r
children, was rapid!
I have noticed with several, now
defunct magazines, that the ﬁrst stage of
their decline was marked by an increase in
games reviews and a  corresponding
decrease in informed editorial.
The second stage was heralded by
letters of complaint about the content of
the later issues. The reply to these has
become infuriatingly predictable -  the
favourite being "we can't publish if you
don't send us". Editors would do well to
remember that we pay for a magazine to
inform us or entertain us, to provide us
with a service. Customer participation is
all very well but should not be to provide
the material.
I h o p e  t h a t  Yo u r  Commodor e
continues to be a good read and does not
L e t t e r s
d e g e n e r a t b  another ab mag with fab
games reviews, brill banter and high
scores.
Eric Pickering, Corwen
am pleased to say that Your Commodore
will certainly n o t  'degenerate in t o
another fab mag', in fact we hope that
quite the opposite will happen. Our aim
as an editorial team is to produce a well
balanced informative magazine for those
people who want to do more than )(1st
play games o n  t h e ir  Commodore
computer.
As f o r  y o u r  c omment  a b o u t
submitting articles to the magazine, a m
afraid that it  is only too true o f  any
magazine that 'we can't publish if you
don't send us'. You, the readers, are the
ones that are discovering new things
about y o u r  computers o r  wr iting
programs that you think will be of use to
other people. How can other people hear
about these things if you don't send them
to the magazine? Don't forget we do pay
for all material that we use.
Merger Moans
Before Your Commodore and Your 64
were joined I used to purchase Your 64,
Looking through the new mag I  was
deeply shocked - I couldn't see anything
on hints and tips, no cheats or POKEs also
there was no software chart.
When I  glanced through the new
magazine I noticed that most of the pages
were given up to listings. Not that I mind
listings, but is it really necessary to have
that many or is it just a cheap way of ﬁlling
up pages?
I also noticed that you were giving
away 10 Compunet modems, how about a
feature on Compu net to go with them?
Andrew Bailey, Horsham
We get quite a number of letters and
phone calls at Your Commodore asking
for the POKEs for certain games so that
you can be made indestructable or have
inﬁnite lives.
Our feeling is that by entering these
POKEs you are spoiling the game. Surely
the whole point of buying a game is to try
and s olv e t h e  puz z les  t h a t  t h e
programmer of the game has set? If you
are going to cheat, what's the point in
buying the game in the ﬁrst place? Unlike
many other magazines we don't publish
maps of games either for exactly the same
reason.
Letter from Oz
=
We do realise that we devote a large
number of pages to listings. This is not a
cheap way of ﬁlling up pages, in fact it is
usually more expensive. The reason that
we have so many pages of listings is quite
simple. We aim to publish programs of as
high a quality as possible, in fact most of
our programs are of commercial quality.
Obviously the better programs are usually
the longer ones and this does take up
space.
We could reduce the amount of space
that we give over to listings by simply
publishing hex  loaders f o r  a ll t h e
programs. At the moment we publish
both a loader and the assembly code.
Many people prefer it this way since they
can follow the program through and ﬁnd
out how it works.
As for your question about Compunet.
We do have a regular article on commun-
ications called Communications Corner
and we also have a number of pages and
programs on Compunet.
I was reading through my back issues of
Your Commodore when I came across an
article in the May issue called Softrock.
What do you mean by saying: "They're
not bad for Aussies". I f  you stopped
whinging and looked around, you'd see
that our country is 10 times better than
yours. Also Rolf Harris is not the only
musician of any note, he is hopeless. If
you want good music then listen to the
Models. Men at Work, Australian Crawl,
INXS, Pseudo Echo, Midnight O il and
Icehouse among others.
And, a l l  Australians d o n ' t  play
didgeredoos, so go stick a pork pie up
your nose.
When y o u  mak e s ome dec ent
software, get a decent cricket team and
win the America's Cup then you can start
knocking other people. Tom Nash is dead
meat.
And you'd better publish this letter,
unless it takes as long to get to England as
your magazine takes to get here, in which
case you'll never get it!
Damien Marsh, Victoria, Australia (and
proud of it!)
We'd like to apologise to Damien and any
other Australian readers who found this
offensive. Our reviewers occasionally get
a bit carried away. However we'd just like
to point out that England now holds the
Ashes!

IN THE LAST THREE ARTICLES
in this series I have given all the
initialis ation a n d  w e d g e
routines needed to add extra
commands to the Basic of a C64
computer.
I have also given the code to
add nine new commands to
Basic. These are; CTL, APPEND,
CHANGE, D U M P ,  F I N D ,
AUTO. CHAIN, DELETE, and
RENUMBER. This month I am
adding a further three com-
mands, they are; MAT, SORT,
and VARPTR.
These commands, •unlike
the previous 'toolk it' ty pe
commands, a r e  u s e d  t o
manipulate and modify data
arrays. D at a manipulation
commands like these can both
save considerable amounts of
Basic program code, and in
addition have the added bonus
of a  considerably shorter
processing time. All three new
commands require that the
wedge and initialisation code
given in the ﬁrst part of the
series are present in memory at
the correct locations, and that
their command names and
entry points are stored in the
correct tables. These c om-
mands are independent of the
previously added commands
and can therefore b e used
without the previous routines.
To ensure that you have the
wedges a n d  n e w  routines
correctly positioned, the Basic
loader at the end of this article
gives only  t h e  initialisation
routines and the three new
commands. T he commands
added in previous issues have
been left out in order to keep
the loader o f  a manageable
size. All the programs used in
this series are extracted from
the book  Advanced Com-
modore 64 Basic Revealed by
Nick Hampshire and published
by Collins.
MAT
Abbreviated entry; M(shift)A
Token: Hex $EE,S11, Decimal
238,17
Modes: Program and direct
Purpose: T o  perform arith-
metic operations o n  entire
arrays, assuming their contents
to be matrices.
Syntax: M AT  array name =
( ar ithmetic  ex pres s ion).
Assigns scalar v alue t o  a ll
elements of the matrix in the
array. Brackets are required
around the expression.
MAT array name = array name
Assigns a l l  corresponding
elements from one array t o
another. Both arrays must be
numeric and o f  t h e  same
dimensions.
MAT array name = array name
operator (arithmetic expres-
sion).
Or MAT array name = (arith-
metic expression) operator
array name. The operator may
be + or * to add or multiply a
matrix with a scalar value.
MAT array name =array name+
array name. All three arrays
must b e  o f  t h e  s a m e
dimensions, and numeric.
MAT array name =array name*
array name. Array sizes must
follow t h e  convention f o r
matrix multiplication ie. (a xc)=
(a x b)*(b x c). Where LID,c are
the array sizes in  the D IM
statement plus 1 (element 01 is
used.

The MAT  command w ill
only accept arrays of 1 or  2
dimensions, of only numeric
type and with not more than
255 e le m e n t s  i n  e i t h e r
dimension.
Errors: Syntax error - when the
expression is not in brackets or
an illegal operator is used.
Type mismatch -  for  string
arrays
Bad subscript -  for arrays of
incorrect size etc.
Use; High speed matrix arith-
metic is approximately eight
times faster than an equivalent
Basic subroutine. Using this
command also saves the use ot
nested FOR N E X T  loops, and
thereby reduces the chances of
an out of memory error due to
the stack being full. As most
versions of Basic on main frame
computers have f u ll matrix
arithmetic this subset of the full
MAT command will be useful
in converting programs to run
on the C64. Matrix arithmetic is
often u s e d  i n  pr ogr ams
handling lar ge amounts o f
numbers in linear equations.
The routine uses the simple
convention that a matrix of size
a x b will be stored in an array
dimensioned by DIM A(a-1,
1). This means that a routine to
read a 5 x 2 matrix from data
statements would be:
DIM A(4,1)
FOR I = 0 TO 4
FOR I = 0 TO 1

Routine entry point: $90AC
Routine operation: the MAT
routine uses t h e  following
Basic ROM calls.
SAEF1 — Evaluate expression in
brackets
$BBD4 — FAC # 1 to memory
(K,Y)
$BBA2 —  Memory (XX) t o
FAC # 1
$1318F -  Float to ﬁxed
$8391 — Fixed to ﬂoat
$8867 —  Memory  ( A M  +
FAC 4 1 to FAC 4 1
$8850 —  Memory (AN) —
FAC # 1 to FAC 1
58A28 —  Memory  ( AN)
FAC tif 1 to FAC 4 1
The routine for assignment
will, for speed, just perform a
block memory move if the two
arrays are both of the same type
e.g. both integer. The multiply
routine works in the same way
as the basic version above. It
calculates the address of the
next element required just by
adding a pre-calculated offset
for speed.
Readers ar e advised t o
consult a standard mathematics
textbook for details of matrix
arithmetic.
SORT
Abbreviated entry: S(shift)0
Affected Bask abbreviations:
None
Token: Hex SEE, $18. Decimal
238,24
Modes: Direct and program
Recommended mode: Either
Purpose: To sort a string array
into alphabetically ascending
order.
Syntax: SORT string array name
- the string array name must be
1 or 2 bytes long, this being the
characters o f  t h e  n a m e
(without the $ character).
Errors: Syntax error -  if  no
name is speciﬁed.
Array not found -  if the string
array speciﬁed does not exist.
Incorrect dimension -  if the
string array speciﬁed has more
than one dimension.
Insufﬁcient elements -  if the
string array has only 1 element.
Use: SORT is a bubble sort
routine that will sort a string
array so that all of the strings in
the array c an b e  read i n
alphabetically as c ending
order. For example:
•
A$O
0 TEST
1 SORT
After SORT A
AFTER
BUBBLE
2 NAME
3 BUBBLE
4 AFTER
5 READING
6 READ
NAME
READ
READING
SORT
TEST
Routine entry point: $9D25
Routine operation: The array
name is ﬁrst read in and stored
away in the Basic's format for
string arrays. The array storage
area is then scanned for that
array and if  not found, the
message array not found is
displayed. If the array is found,
the number of dimensions is
checked and if there is more
than o n e  dimens ion, t h e
message 'incorrect dimension'
will be displayed. If that is OK,
the dimension is checked and if
it is only one value the message
'insufﬁcient elements ' i s
displayed. If all checks are OK
the array is then sorted.

Jayne Coin had a heart to
heart with Commodore's new
RiC-20 and didn't suffer
agonies.
FOR MOST PEOPLE IT  IS HARD TO
believe that it is only ﬁve short years since
the home computer revolution began
with the launch of Sir Clive Sinclair's ZX
range o f  c omputer s . Sinc e t h e n
Commodore has become a household
name but the full title of the company,
Commodore Business Machines, belies its
roots as a major force which changed
attitudes towards computers in business
and paved the way for Sinclair.
Prior to the launch of CBM's PET range
of computers, business machines were
unwieldy beasts and very much the
preserve o f  the larger domestic and
multinational companies. The concept of
a computer on every desk was one which
Commodore made very much its own.
The advantage of the PET was that it
was a  stand alone computer. Each
machine held sufﬁcient memory t o
enable an executive to perform many
tasks in the comfort of the ofﬁce, when
previously he had to book time on the
mainframe machine.
Since these halcyon days Commodore
has seen many changes, including the loss
of its lead to IBM's range of personal
computers. I BM' s  domination has
reached such proportions now that this
company has become something of a
demi-god in business circles and the PC
has become a machine which has set the
standard f o r  s m a ll pr ofes s ional
computers.
Obviously, Commodore has found the
loss of the lion's share in this area a bitter
pill to swallow but the launch of the PC-10
and the PC-20 heralds a new ﬁghting
attitude.
This article is partially a review of the
PC-20 but because PC is a generic term it is
also a review of these systems as a whole.
The implication behind this is that the PC-
20 complies to the standard very closely
and is a worthy contender in the PC
stakes.
The heart of the new machine is the
8088 microprocessor which can be con-
sidered to be the 'executive' chip. This is
the decision maker -
a human executive within the business
world.
In the same way that an executive
increases his  efﬁciency b y  having a
personal assistant to perform the routine
tasks o f  t h e  d a y ,  t h e  8088 i s
complemented by an 8237A controller.
This chip can access memory directly and
can download the contents to a disk or
any other peripheral leaving the main
processor to carry on its main function
ERSONAL
OLUMN
without interruption. The result as far as
the user is concerned is that a program
can run continuously without having to
waste time waiting for the machine to
ﬁnish saving things to disk or typing data
out on a printer.
To take this analogy with business
organisations o n e  stage further, t he
executive needs to carry out calculations
during the working day. Some of these are
relatively simple and can be done by
mental arithmetic, b u t  f o r  others a
calculator must be employed. Not that the
executive is  incapable o f  performing
these calculations himself, it's just that he
can save time this way.
In the PC, a similar situation occurs.
The 8088 can only calculate with whole
numbers, integers. Much of its work relies
on the use of  numbers with decimal
places even if these are just pounds and
pence. in the early days PC software had
routines built  i n  t o  overcome this
problem and muc h o f  the software
produced today is still structured this way.
Greater efﬁciency can be achieved by
giving the 8088 its own 'calculator' in the
form of an 8087 chip which can perform
ﬂoating point calculations.
This facility is catered for in the PC-20
and alongside the 8088 is art IC socket
which can house an 8087 as an optional
extra.
This multitasking organisation is the
basis of the PC, an executive with a PA and
a calculator, a mirror image of the real
world of efﬁcient business.
The PC-20 incorporates this basic
structure in a well designed modular unit,
There are many variations which can be
chosen around this basic theme. Colour,
graphics and sound boards c an b e
plugged into sockets inside the main unit
for specialist applications, RS232 o r
Centronic printers can be attached and
the basic twin disk conﬁguration can be
extended to support four drives in all or
even two Winchester drives.
The standard machine has two disk
drives: a standard 5.25 inch 360K drive
and a 10,M/byte hard disk. The inclusion
of t h e  hard dis k  increases software
security and access because the most
commonly used programs can all be
transferred to this disk for ready use and
the saving in time and on wear and tear
which normal backup copies undergo
during a working day is one of the most
valuable facilities which the PC-20 has to
offer.
 The PC is the closest thing to a 'soft'
machine w hic h c an b e  imagined.

'  4 1 a
Obviously a resident 8K
ROM must be incorporated
to control initialisation of
the system and the loading of the system
disk but the choice of language is entirely
up to the user. MS-DOS is the PC standard
but the sytem disk also has an option to
use GWBASIC which is one of the most
user friendly Basics to date.
A full description of GW would stretch
this article throughout a whole issue of
Your Commodore so a mere taster is all I
can give. Apart from the usual commands
which form the building blocks of any
Microsoft implementation of Basic, there
are also the extended graphics commands
which are to be found in the new 128, with
the exclusion of sprites. Screen windows
can b e created, the memory can be
structured t o  include machine c ode
routines which may be called from Basic
programs and related ﬁles on disk can be
linked by 'pathways' to make selection
easier (obviously an essential with such a
lot of disk memory around).
One o f  the strongest facilities o f
the language is  the SHELL command
which allows the program to slip out of
the current Basic program and into
another program or MS-DOS routine and
then back again to where it left off.

One extra 
-
facility is an integral error
locator which is superb if the very strict
rules o f  syntax are observed (spaces
between commands are essential) but can
give strange results if you don't. Should
you, for example, omit a space between
the FOR in a loop and the variable, it is
quite probable that the indicator will ﬂash
under t h e  wor d TO , giving rise t o
confusion. However. I will accept Micro-
soft's attitude that a PC programmer is not
generally a  beginner  b u t  a  t r u e
professional and that such a rudimentary
error would be spotted. After all there are
many other errors which are not so easily
noticed which this system can locate in
the twinkling of an eye.
For most users Basic is not a vital facility
because they are only interested in appli-
cation software, but the time often comes
when a speciﬁc need arises which is not
covered by an existing software package
and such a valuable facility as this could
R e v i e w
save money when these dire
situations arise.
The technical speciﬁcations of  the
machine ar e initially modest b y  PC
standards but this helps to keep the cost
down and the unit can be expanded from
a basic 256K green screen 80 x 24 text only
model up to a 640K RGB colour graphics
and sound systeem with a screen resolu-
tion of 720 x 350 pixels.
The k ey boar d i s  detac hable,
connected to the main unit by a coiled
cable, and has 10 programmable function
keys and a full numeric keypad. The
power supply has an inbuilt fan which
keeps everything relatively cool during
operation, indicative of the attention of
detail which Commodore has maintained
despite the very modest price of E2795.
What Commodore has produced with
this 16-bit PC-20, is a low-cost, efﬁcient
workstation which can draw on any of the
programs in the extensive PC library. No
doubt the gradual domination of IBM in
the bus ines s  s ec tor  h a s  c aus ed
Commodore's executives to grind their
teeth in despair but, now that they appear
to have swallowed their pride and put
away their PET projects. the PC-20 will
give them a ﬁrm basis to build upon and
maybe one day topple the usurper from
the throne which was once their own.

Allen Webb brings
[you a High ilesoluW
Vaphics Aid to make
[your CM mmore than]
lever  like an electronic]
IF YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE
in for an easy time this month,
you're wr ong. I  w a n t  t o
describe a  mac hine c ode
package whic h w ill provide
you with 12 commands for the
manipulation o f  bit mapped
images. Whilst the commands
are designed to work in high
resolution mode, they  w ill
function in multicolour mode.
The c o lo u r  manipulation
routines w ill not, however,
work as expected.
Before y o u  h o w l  w it h
anguish. this is not just another
drawing package. Apart from a
single c ommand f o r  t h e
drawing of single points, there
are no line drawing or similar
commands. Before I  s pout
forth on the package, here is a
small tutorial which will explain
my reason for developing the
package.
In essence, there are three
basic means  o f  c r eating
pictures on the CM.
1. You can use simple line,
circle and ﬁll commands to
draw pictures. This is the
approach adopted by most
adventure writers and, in my
opinion, doesn't give parti-
cularly detailed results.
2 You can build up pictures
from redeﬁned characters.
Since, without use of raster
interrupts, you are limited
to 256 characters, there are
limitations.
3 You can save pictures drawn
by a Koala Pad or similar
product and store them on
disk.
In this article I  want t o
describe a  slightly different
method o f  creating pictures.
The idea is to set up shape
tables in memory and put them
on the high resolution screen
in a  manner similar t o  the
potato prints used by children.
Using this  approach i t  is
possible t o  create pictures
similar to those used in games
like Lords of Midnight. 1
So what is a shape table?
Well it's a collection of designs
saved in memory which can be
copied to the high resolution
screen. The system I have used
is to mimic the C64's character
set. This, of course, is a shape
table where each entry is a
character design. Each shape is
a rectangle of complete eight
by eight pixels. The design of
each row is stored in sequence
giving eight bytes. Imagine a
square shape:
A
B
C
D
E l  C
H
I J  
K
L
M N  O P
This is stored as:
ANCDEIGHIJKLMNOP
Any shape can be deﬁned
by its start address, width (in
whole characters) a n d  it s
height (in wholt haracters). If
you wanted t  d e ﬁn e  t h e
above example i the character
ROM, its start Iddress would
be 53248, its width would be
four and its height four. Don't
try to use the character ROM
directly, I have provided the
means of copying the ROM to
RAM so that you can play about
with it.
In order to reduce the size
of the code - it's long enough
already -  I'v e limited t h e
printing of shapes to the high
resolution screen t o  whole
'rN4
character positions. This isn't
too muc h o f  a  restriction
because:
1 The colour matrix is limited
to whole character positions
in high resolution mode.
2 w i t h  c areful des ign o f
shapes and the mixing rules
provided, y ou c an over-
come this limitation.
3 I f  you must have single pixel
positioning, y ou can mix
sprites with the picture.
By the way, the reason I've
stuck to high resolution mode
is that I prefer the detail that it
allows and with a bit of cunning
you c an get decent colour
mixing.
So on with the commands.
I've summarised them in Table
1 with the syntax.

In Table 1:
SA has the value 49152
X is the horizontal position of a
dot
Y is the vertical position of a dot
I is the ink colour and P the
paper colour
XS is the horizontal position of
the top left corner of a shape or
zone (0-319)
VS is the vertical position of the
top left corner of a shape or
zone (0-199)
XF is the horizontal position of
the bottom right corner of a
zone (0-319)
YE is the vertical position of the
bottom right corner of a zone
(0-399).
WI is the width of a shape (1-32)
HI is the height of a shape (0-25)
BX is the horizontal position of
the t op left corner o f  the
airbrush area (0-319)
BY is the vertical position of the
top left corner of the airbrush
area (0-399)
BS determines the air brush
size (0=small, 1=large)
DD speciﬁes the number of
dots per air brush "squirt" (0-
255)
AD is  t h e  address o f  t he
character s et t o  b e  down
loaded: AD = 53248 for upper
case, AD = 55296 for lower case
El determines how a dot ir
drawn:
0 clears a dot
1 sets a dot
2 ﬂips a dot
3 changes the paper in the
character holding the dot but
does not plot a dot. This is

F4 toggles text and shapes into

reversed ﬁeld.
Due to limitations of space,
I c annot g iv e  a  detailed
description of the commands. I
hope the following summaries
will sufﬁce.
Command 1 clears the high
resolution s c reen t o  t h e
required ink and paper values
and turns it on. Command 2
changes the ink  and paper
values ov er all t he screen.
Commands 3  and 4  toggle

screens without disturbing
their contents.
Command 5  changes a

Command 8

Command 10 toggles a  ﬂag
which determines whether the
ink and paper are updated by
any drawing command. If this
mode is  disabled, y ou c an
update t he picture without
altering the colours.
Command 11 copies the top
line of the text screen to the
speciﬁed line o n  t h e  high
r es olution s c r e e n .  T h e
character shapes ar e taken
from the character area. This is
the easiest way of printing text.
Command 12 puts a shape
on a speciﬁed area of screen.
You must specify t he start
address of the shape.
So you know where to save
your shape tables, here is the
memory map of the system:
$1000413E8 (1024-2023) — text
screen
$A 000- $B 40 (40960-48960) —
high resolution bit map
$8C00-$EIFE8 (35840-36840) —
colour matrix
SCA00-$CE00 (51712-52736) —
character table
$C000-$C501 (49152-50641) —
machine code
This means that the safest
areas f o r  shape tables ar e
$C5D2 to $C9FF (50642-51711)
and $13FE9-$9FFF (36841-40959).
This totals about SK and should
be sufﬁcient for most purposes
(the demo uses only 424 bytes).
If you want to use sprites. I
recommend that you use the
area $8000 to $8C00. This is
sufﬁcient for 48 sprites. The
sprite pointers occupy 36856 to
36863.
You should take care to
protect the top of RAM and
should u s e  either  o f  t h e
follow ing l i n e s  a t  t h e
beginning of your program:
10 POKE 56,140: CLR
or if you use sprites:
10 POKE 56,128: CLR
Study t h e  accompanying
demonstration program. this
uses many of the commands
and multic olour sprites. I t
should give some hints on how
to use the program.
For those amongst you who
want t o  a d d  d r a w i n g
commands t o  t h e  package,
here are details o f  the dot
drawing routine:
X co-ordinate MSB into $0387
X co-ordinate LSB into $0386
Y co-ordinate into $0388
Fl value into $0389
Entry point $COCS
You may ﬁnd the creation
of large shapes a little awkward.
use Supersoft's Graphics
Designer for such work. Not
only is it the best character/
sprite designer I've used but it
also allows t h e  creation o f
shapes built up from up to 32
characters.
I hope you ﬁnd this package
worth the toil of typing it in. I
believ e y o u  w o n ' t  b e
disappointed.

of lines that cross is counted
twice. The point where, say,
line A crosses line B, is counted
once when all the lines are
paired with line A and a second
time when all the lines are
paired with line B. For this
reason, the value held in CR
after these lines are executed is
twice the number o f  cross-
overs, W e  shall leave t h e
program like this because the
steps have t o  b e  taken t o
ensure that each crossover is
counted only once complicate
it considerably.
It is now a simple matter to
record the position o f  each
crossover because the value of
N, which gives the position, has
been found already_ I f  w e
record the locations o f  the
crossovers by placing their x-
and y-co-ordinates respect-
ively, in the elements of the
arrays XC and VC, then we
need only modify lines 10 and
210 as follows.
10 D I M X(5), Y(5), C(5, 5),
XC(10), YC(10)
210 IF N 0  AND N 1  THEN
CR=CR+1: XC(CR)=N*X1 + (1-
N)*X2: VC(CR)=N*Y1 +  ( 1-
N)tY2
Finally, we can mark the
position of each crossover with
a square block composed of
dots by using the subroutine,
starting at line 1000, which plots
a dot in column C and row R,
repeatedly.
240 FOR j=1 TO CR
250 FOR R=YC(J)-3 TO YC(J)+3
260 FOR C=XC(I)-3 TO XC(J)43

280 NEXT C: NEXT N E X T
The complete program listing,
with the subroutines, is listed as
Figure 3.
Further Developments
You can gain some conﬁdence
in the program by drawing a
different network connecting
ﬁve 'places', recording it in C,
and seeing that the program
can mark its crossovers. The
program can be extended to
deal w it h  networks having
more than ﬁve 'places' in them,
but this is straightforward. It is
somewhat mor e difﬁcult t o
amend the program so that it
does not count, and mark,
every crossover twice. T he
crossovers c an b e  marked
more effectively, perhaps with
a ﬂashing block., like a cursor.
Some way o f  displaying the
number o f  crossovers would
also enhance the program.

COMMODORE LISTINGS ARE RATHER
well known for the horrible little black
blobs that always abound. Unfortunately
the graphics characters which are used to
represent graphic and control characters
do not reproduce very well and they are
also difﬁcult to ﬁnd on the Commodore
keyboard.
in future all control and graphics
commands will be replaced by a mnemonic
within square brackets. This mnemonic is
not typed out as printed in the magazine
but rather the corresponding key or keys
on the keyboard are pressed. For example
[RIGHT] means press the cursor right key.
you do not type in [RIGHT]. All of the
keywords, what keys to press and how
they are shown on the screen are shown
below.

THE WORST THING ABOUT
Machine Code programming is
entering thousands of numbers
and then ﬁnding that t h e
program will not work. There is
nothing else that you can do
apart from go through all of the
listing trying t o  locate that
mistyped character w hic h
prevents the program fr om
working correctly.
Now there's an easier way
to enter your machine code
programs. With the Your Com-
modore machine code entry
program, each line of numbers
is checked as soon as you press
return, I f  you have made a
mistake you will be asked to re-
type the last line. Another
added bonus is that you can
save what you have entered at
any time to tape or disk and
carry on where you left off next
time y o u  c o m e  t o  y o u r
computer.
Using the Loader
Before you type in any machine
code program you must have
typed in  the machine code
entry program and have i t
saved onto tape or disk, When
you want to enter any of the
machine code programs that
are printed out in the form
used by this program you must
LOAD it into your computer.
When you RUN the program
you will be asked for the start
address of the program. The
start address is the ﬁrst number
in any machine code listing that
appears before the colon (e.g.
49152* You simply type in this
number and press return.
All that you have to do from
then o n  is  type in  all the
numbers on a line. Do not type
any spaces and do not type
return, the program will do all
of that for you. If you have
made a mistake on any line the
computer will ask you to type
the line again. Once the line is
enter ed c o r r e c t l y  t h e
computer w ill automatically
prompt you for the next line of
data.
Saving and Loading
You can save your data to tape
or disk at any time by simply
entering the Fl key as the ﬁrst
character on any line. You will
then be asked for the start and
end address of the save. The
start address is the ﬁrst number
in t h e  lis ting a s  already
mentioned. The end address is
the number of the last line plus
11. Don't forget to add 11 or the
last line entered will not be
saved,
To load back a program that 8 3
you have saved y ou simply
have to enter the F3 key as the
ﬁrst' item on a line. You will
then be asked for the name of
the program.

will save you money. By Bob

LIST AID OPENS UP A NEW WORLD FOR
programmers. No longer are you limited
to using standard paper for your listing.
Instead you can list your Basic programs to
any desired width (between one and 80
columns) and as a bonus, you can choose
either standard or double size characters
and set the print head's start position.
There are several advantages using List
Aid. For a start, listing a program 60
columns wide, with the print head offset
to 10 columns, gives a nice margin either
side of the listing to make any notes etc.
How about listing in 40 column mode, so
the listing looks exactly as it would on the
screen. Yo u  c ould us e double size
characters for any one with poor eyesight.
List Aid itself requires 5K of memory to
operate. Therefore, the only limitation is
that your program must not occupy more
than 33K, when the program is initially
loaded into the computer. I t  doesn't
matter if your program requires more
than 33K to run.
Using List Aid
First, type in the program exactly. You can
leave the REMs out if you wish. Don't
forget to SAVE it. Now run it. There are
three questions to be answered.
First, the character size. It's preset for
standard size. For double size press 'D'
and 'return', otherwise just press 'return'.
Next select the width. This is the actual
column size to be listed. Enter any size
between one and 80 and press 'return'.
Finally the print head's TAB setting is
required. This is preset for now. If all goes
well, List Aid will list itself!
To list your program the following
instructions must be followed exactly.
First reset the computer by switching
OFF and ON, or type in SYS 64738 and
'return'. Now load the program you wish
to list. Remember, your program must not
occupy more than 33K. Now type in the
following one line direct statement and
press return. Do make sure it is exact or
you will have to load all over again.
POKE 4  3,1:POKE 4  4,1 4 0:POKE
140*256,0:NEW
New? But, I just loaded it, I hear you say.
Don't worry, all will be revealed later. If
you've done that correctly the computer
will respond with 'READY'. Now load List
Aid, run it and your program will be listed.
Don't for get t o  have y our  printer
switched on and the paper all aligned.
To list another program you will have
to switch off and start again.
So, what's the NEW all about then?
Well, ﬁrst y ou loaded your program.
When a Basic program is loaded into the
computer (which is just switched on), it is
placed in  memory from address 2049
onwards. The computer knows, or thinks
it knows, where to place the program by
looking a t  locations 43 and 44. The
contents o f  these locations indicate
where the Basic's memory 'BOTTOM' is.
In this case 2049. Before loading any
program in, try this in direct mode:
PRINT PEEK (43) + (44) * 256
The result will be 2049. By raising the
'BOTTOM' of memory above the area
your program occupies, we can load a
second program, lis t Aid, and run it,
thereby not affecting the contents of your
program. We do this by pokeing beatings
43 and 44 with values t o  make the
computer 'think' that the Basic memory
now begins at address 35841, The 'NEW'
command resets all t he other Basic
pointers accordingly. The values poked to
43 and 44,1 and 140, ensure that the maxi-
mum permissable RAM is available for
your program, 33K. Before actually
loading List Aid (after the pokes to 43 and
44) type in: PRINT FRF(0) and 'return'. You
will see a return of 5119 bytes free, The
POKE 140*256,0 ensures location 35840
contains a zero, The ﬁrst byte of Basic ram
must be a zero.
List Aid works progressively, following
four ﬁelds.
1. Work out the current line number and
the link address pointing to the next
line.
2. Starting w i t h  i t s  l i n e  number ,
concatenate a string variable repre-
senting that line. Detect end of line
upon reaching link address.
3. Print routine. Send contents of string
to printer, one character at a time,
appropriately limited the print width,
set TAB and Character size if required.
4. Check f o r  ' d o u b le  z e r o  b y t e '
indicating end of program. If not go to
1.
50-110 p r i n t s  TITLE
130 c h e c k s  if printer is switched on.
150-510 i n i t i a l i s e .  Set up Link Address, Keyword and Cursor Control
Character strings.
560-690 g e t  print mode, width and tab values.
710-760 s e t  up print mode and customise 'QUOTE' character. Sending
a normal 'quote mark i.e. CHR$(34) to the printer is OK but if
you follow this with any cursor control character, then funny
things happen! So, why not send a 'customised' quote character.
Same difference - no problems!
780 F i e l d  1. Find current line number, link address to next line.
790-910 F i e l d  2. Add line number to string. Peek current address. If
Keyword, add appropriate Keyword string. if 'quote' mark then
enter loop (lines 840-890). If detected add Cursor Control
characters. Eke, add standard ASCII code. Leave loop when
second quote or end of line is detected. If not Keyword or quote
character, add normal ASCII character. Increment peek address,
if not same as link address, start again.
930-1000 F i e l d  3. Print routine. Calls SUB 1080. Set up loop for length Of
program string. Print count = O. Print string, one character at a
time. If print count = print width or end of line is reached, print a
carriage return. If a 'quote mark' CHRS(34) is detected, send
customised 'quote' instead (sub 1050). When all characters are
sent, send a carriage return.
1020 F i e l d  4. Last line check. If the contents of (Link Address) AND
(Link Address + 1) is 0 then the end of program is detected.
Else goto 780.
1050-1060 Subroutine. Print customised 'quote' character. If print mode is
double size characters then print two quotes. Note the quote
character is different for double size.
1080-1090 Subroutine. Print 'TAB' many spaces to set the printer head.
1130-1140 E n d  routine. Flash 'printer not on'. Close channel to printer.

hexadecimal system.
Hex-Calculator
SOONER OR LATER. OWNERS
of Commodore machines start
to get tired of Basic and wish to
penetrate the mysterious world
of machine code. A ﬁrst step
along this road entails getting
to grips with the hexadecimal
system in which the machine
code is written.
The hexadecimal system is
based around a unit of 16 rather
than the 10 that we are familiar
with i n  our  '10s and units'
system. I n  t h e  hexadecimal
system, the numbers zero to
nine are represented by the
digits 0-9 but the numbers 10-
15 ar e represented b y  the
letters A- 1. Sixteen i n  t h e
hexadecimal system is there-
fore o n e  hexadecimal u n it
(corresponding to our 10s) fol-
lowed by no other units: hence
16 decimal is 10 hex,17 decimal
is 11 hex, 34 decimal is (2 x16 +
2) 2 2  and s o  on. I t  is

such as 11 meant 11 in  the
decimal system or 17 in the
hexadecimal system. T h e
decimal notation is sometimes
characterised by a # sign but
very often by no sign at all - this
means that if you see a number
by itself it is nearly always a
decimal number but a  hex
number should always be pre-
ceded by the $ sign.

written into the ROM which
enabled one to get to grips with
hex fairly easily but this facility
was denied to the generation
of C64 and Vic 20 owners who
had to buy or get a machine-
language monitor f o r  their
machines like Supermon.
This month, t h e  lis ting
shows you how you can add a
hexadecimal converter to your
machine so that you can very
quickly and easily input a
decimal number and get its hex
equivalent or input a hex num-
ber a n d  g e t  i t s  dec imal
equivalent. The whole routine
is written to be as compact as
possible and is  designed t o
occupy the space from $02A7-
$0277 - a total of 89 bytes which
are absolutely safe and will not
be corrupted by  any other
operations including loading in
a new program on tape. In fact,
the routine only just squeezes
into the available space and is a
result of my passion for nice
tight and compact routinesthat
just ﬁt into the few spare safe
locations.
The listing actually contains
two m a c h i n e  la n g u a g e
programs and requires a little
explanation s o that you can
follow what is going on!
Lines 17-20 contain t h e
decimal value for a short (i.e. 30
byte) hex -loading r outine
which greatly speeds up the
process o f  converting hex
values to decimal within the
context of a Basic program such
as this. As you can see, the main
body o f  t h e  pr ogr am i s
contained in DATA statements
from lines 200-240 and each
line of DATA has one to three
hexadecimal numbers  fol-
lowed by a 6502 mnemonic or
op-code, a n  addressd and
ﬁnally a comment. This is to
enable t h e  ex per ienc ed
machine c ode programmers
amongst you to understand the
construction process -  I ﬁnd
that I always learn a lot from
studying how  other people
have c ons t r uc t ed t h e i r
programs. These hex values are
read into a variable FIS in line 70
and then the ﬁrst hex-loading
routine is called at location 320.
This is actually the bottom part
of the stack and should be fairly
safe u n l e s s  y o u  h a v e
mathematical routines with lots
of brackets and/ or  many
indented loops, all of which
require a lot of stack space. The
hex-loading routine, read in
lines 17-20, leaves the single
byte decimal value that w e
require in the Accumulator. To
access it, we merely PEEK(780)
which the designers of the Vic
and the C64 thoughtfully put in
to enable us to access the 6502
registers directly. L in e  8 0
obviously POKEs the converted
hex value into the value of
LOC+I where LOC is decided
by you, the user.
So here, you actually have
two decimal-hex converts
within a single program. The
main converter is designed to
sit in  a  safe location where
SYS(700),$---- o r  SYS(700),----
will do the conversion job for
you. I f  y ou precede y our
number by the s ign then the
converter will assume a hex
number a n d  w i l l  c onv er t
accordingly. This hex number
can b e  o f  any (reasonable)
length e.g. one to four digits. If
you d o  n o t  precede y our
number by a $S sign, then the
converter will assume that you
are in p u t t in g  a  dec imal
number and will convert it to
hex for you.
The initial hex-loader which
is located in the stack is purely a
reﬁnement b u t  processes
numbers a t  four  times the
speed of the Basic equivalents.
If you are still wedded to Basic
then lines 300-450 show how to
use fairly standard conversion
routines. All routines, whether
Basic or machine code have to
cope with the fact that the
ASCII values for A-F do not
immediately follow the ASCII
values for the digits 0-9 but are
some eight locations later.
Hence the necessity to engage
in a process which works out
whether the values A-F are
involved in  any part o f  the
conversion process and then to
make whatever additional
adjustments are necessary.

system series with the
raiembler.
The Assembler
Now we come to the third and
ﬁnal program of the series, the
Assembler. This is a two pass
assembler which will accept
source code from either the
Macro Processor or direct from
the Ed it o r  (assuming n o
MACRO deﬁnitions or calls are
present) and will produce an
executable machine code ﬁle.
This means that all you will
have to do to run your program
will be to LOAD it by name and
call i t  w i t h  a  bas ic  SYS
command. For example:
LOAD "ﬁlename",I3,1
SYS (start address)
During assembly, a listing is
generated giving the object
code and a list of symbols and
their values. This may be sent to
a printer by executing the TTY
command before calling the
Assembler.
Entering the Code
There are ﬁve Basic listings
given here. As  before, type
them all i n  and save them
before running. To save the
code, use either the Monitor S
command giving ASSEMBLER,
9000 a n d  9 E 0 0  a s  t h e
parameters, or use:
POKE43,0:POKE44,144:POKE
45,0:P0KE46,158:SAVE"
AS5EMBLER",8,1
P0KE43,1:P0KE44,8:NEW
To call the Assembler from
the Monitor, you should use
either:
ASSEMBLER or
ASSEMBLER (s ourc e ﬁle )
(object ﬁle)
If you use the ﬁrst option. the
Assembler w ill prompt y ou
with ENTER FILENAME(s). You
should then enter the names of
the ﬁles in the same format as
the second option above.
Assembler Instructions
There now follows a list of
PSEUDO INSTRUCTIONS that
are entered in ﬁeld three.
Instruction Func ti on
ORG S e t s  code origin in memory. This can be any
memory address since the object code is
written to disk and on into memory. This
should be the ﬁrst instruction in a program.
Other assemblers may use the symbol " "
EQU S e t s  value of a symbol inﬁeld 2 to an
expression in ﬁeld 4. In other assemblers
the equivalent symbol may simply be "=''
END I n d i c a t e s  end of a source code program.
MACRO deﬁnitions may follow.
TXT P u t s  a text string in ASCII into memory.
BYT P u t s  single byte value(s) into memory.
WRD P u t s  2-byte number(s) into memory in 6502
lo-byte, hi-byte order.
DRY S a m e  as WRD but in reverse order.
MAC T h e  opening MACRO deﬁnition delimiter.
MND T h e  closing MACRO deﬁnition delimiter.
EXT F
o r
 future use. Actually deﬁnes a GLOBAL
symbol for use with a future LINKER program.
Assembler Operand
Conventions
Field 4 operands have several
symbols associated with them,
Some may b e  familiar, but
others may not.
< and > : These may be used to
specify which byte of a two-
byte number is to be loaded
into a n  6- bit register. F or
example:
LOOP1 LDA#< LABEL
LDY#>LABEL
loads the A-register with the
low-byte of ihe 16 bit value
LABEL, while the Y-register
is loaded with the high-byte.
The apostrophe is used
to signify that a n ASCII
character is to be used as an
operand e.g.
LOOP2LDA # 'A
loads the A-register with 41
HEX. the ASCII code for A.
%: T h e  per c ent s y mbol
signiﬁes t h a t  a  binar y
number f o l l o w s .  F o r
example:
LOOP3 LDX # %00000001
loads the X-register with 1.
$: The dollar signiﬁes that a
hex adec imal n u m b e r
follows. For example:
LOOP7 LDA tit $30
LOOPS LDX $30
If no symbol is used as a
preﬁx then t h e  number is
assumed to be decimal and will
be treated as such. Note that
the "# " in the above examples
is the standard 6502 notation
for an immediate number.
When symbols are being
used in ﬁeld four, it is possible
to add or subtract an offset
using the - and + symbols. For
example:
VICII E Q U  $131000
BORDER EQU VIC11+$20
SCREEN EQ U  VIC:11421
LDA
STA V I C I 1 + 2
ASL
etc
This completes the descrip-
tion of the assembler symbols
Cill
and instruction. Next, we will
assemble o u r  M A C O U T
program which was generated
with the Macro Processor.

Example Program
With all three utility programs

you are ready to assemble.
Enter the monitor and type:
ASSEMBLER MACOUT

The dis k  dr iv e w ill begin
working. After a few moments,
the message:
COMMODORE 6 4 UTILITY
SERIES
ASSEMBLER VI.0
(C) 1985 S.D.C.
will appear. If all goes well, the
machine will generate a listing
on the screen (or printer if you
used TTY). After  this , t h e
machine w ill re-enter t h e
Monitor. You now have a disk
ﬁle called MACOBJ.
Exit the Monitor using the X
command and type:
NEW
LOAD"MACOBJ",t3,1

The program should act as
described below:
1 Clear the screen.
2 O ut put  a  "y our-name"
prompt.
3 Wait for keyboard input.
4 Print what was input.
5 Exit to Basic.

Next, I will give a program-
ming example for you to tryout
using this series of programs.
Enter it using the Editor, call the
Macro Processor and Assem-
bler to work on it and try the
program out. It will have a start
address o f  $C000 o r  49152
decimal. Simply use a Basic SYS
49152.
A Programming
Example for the Utility
Program Series
There now follows a program-
ming example designed t o
show h o w  y o u  c a n  u s e
MACROs in programs. Delete
the p r e v i o u s  p r o g r a m
MACTEST, MACLIB, MACOUT
and MACOBI (unless you want
to k eep them)  us ing t h e
Monitor SCRATCH command.
First, type in the following
MACRO library ﬁle whic h
contains t w o  d i f f e r e n t
MACROs. Call it MACLIB or
something similar. This will be
the name y ou use for  the
(macrolibraryﬁle) in the Macro
Processor call. There is a ﬁeld guide to help you.
The ﬁrst MACRO LOAD
SUB generates a  subroutine
which uses KERNAL R O M
routines to perform a LOADing
operation v ia  logic al ﬁle
number LEN, device DEV with
secondary address SEC. The ﬁle
has a name NAME of length
LEN. On return, a set carry ﬂag
indicates an error condition.
The X and Y registers hold the
highest address loaded to by
the LOAD routine SEEDS.
The s e c o n d  M A C R O
DOLOAD uses the MACRO
LOADSUB as a subroutine. This
is really not much different to
LOADSUB on its own but is
included here to show how
MACRO calls can be nested.

This program shows how
MACRO deﬁnitions are tagged
onto the end of source code
programs. The MACRO HELLO
is called i n  line 45 and
generates code to clear the
screen and print "HI". The
program then goes on to load
the ﬁle on disk called MACRO
and reports an error if it is not
found. On c e  again, th e
MACRO DOLOAD generates a
subroutine, while HELLO
generates in-line code.
Processing the Program
Now call the Macro Processor
with the following command:
MACRO tyoursourceﬁle) (your
outputﬁle) (yourlibraryﬁle)
substituting the names of your
ﬁles for the different para-
meters. Assuming the ﬁles have
been successfully processed,
run t he assembler with the
command:
ASSEMBLER (youroutputﬁle)
(yourobjectﬁle)
once again substituting your
ﬁle names in the command. If
you want to list your ﬁle to the
printer, give the command
ITY b e fo re  calling t h e
Assembler.
If you get an error during
Macro Processing or  during
Assembly, check it against the
error tables. The errors given
by the Assembler are pretty
reliable as are the Macro Pro-
cessor er r or s . T h e  o n l y
problem m a y  o ccu r d u rin g
Macro Processing because of
the fact that mo re  than one
source ﬁle is being used and
the line-numbers don't often
correspond. However, if  the
error occurs in the source ﬁle
(not the macro library ﬁle) then
the number given in the error
message should be accurate.
hope that you will ﬁnd
these programs useful to have
and that they help any of you
who are just starting out in
machine code programming
on the Commodore 64. The
three programs took about
four weeks to write (and about
two weeks to debug!) and I am
pretty sure that they are, for the
most part, error free. I  am
starting work o n  another
version o f  t h e  u tility series
which will allow both tape and
multiple disk operation. If you
encounter any bugs i n  the
program, don't hesitate t o

Choosing the right computer
is a good start — but can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT we're very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet' Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all, for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works. Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a  space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because —
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!
SUPERSOFT, Winchester House, Canning Road,
Wealdstone, Harrow, Middlesex HA3 7SJ
Telephone; 01-861 1166
Other SUPERSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!). The VICTREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands, or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really com-
prehensive package for the keen prog-
rammer.
Of course, we do also publish games
programs, and with classics like STIX, OUINX
and KAMI-KAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders. But we most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer—
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket. But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order). However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card.
