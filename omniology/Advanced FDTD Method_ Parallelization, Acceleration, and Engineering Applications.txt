Preface 
 
 
Due to its flexibility and universality, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) 
method has become a major computational electromagnetic tool for various 
electromagnetic problems and phenomena. A large number of publications have 
reported on the FDTD method and engineering applications. Unlike existing 
books, this book introduces the optimization and acceleration techniques based 
on the vector arithmetic logic unit  (VALU) that is a vector unit inside the regular 
CPU, and, demonstrates the difference of commercial software packages based 
on FDTD, finite integration technique (FIT), method of moments (MoM), and 
finite element method (FEM) methods for some typical problems in terms of 
accuracy, computer resource requirement, and performance. In addition, this 
book shows readers how to analyze and obtain the most important characteristics 
when the FDTD method is applied to solve practical problems.  
Each core in the modern CPU has at least one VALU that can handle four 
operations simultaneously besides the floating-point unit (FPU) that can handle 
only one operation at one time. All the traditional electromagnetic software can 
only use floating-point unit or only one element of the VALU today. The VALU 
can accelerate the simulation four times without requiring any extra hardware 
devices. Since the VALU is a regular element inside a CPU, the FDTD code 
based on the VALU can fully use the L1, L2, and L3 caches in the CPU to achieve 
the best performance. This book introduces practical FDTD simulation 
techniques and shows how to develop a high-performance FDTD code that is 
accelerated by using the VALU.   
There exist a large number of commercial electromagnetic simulation 
software packages on the market, including popular electromagnetic software 
packages including GEMS based on the parallel conformal FDTD method, HFSS 
based on FEM, CST based on FIT, and FEKO based on MoM. Although they 
have their own strong areas, they overlap in various electromagnetic problem 
simulations. Though most electromagnetic software manufacturers have their 
own white book to introduce the background of their software packages, none of 
the current electromagnetic books compare the difference between existing 
software packages from the user’s point of view. This book will fill this gap by 
comparing the performance of different software packages. This book starts with 
the basic concepts of the FDTD, MoM, FEM, and FIT methods, and is followed 
by the FDTD acceleration technique using the VALU and the benchmarks of the 
VALU and GPU. In Chapter 3, we introduce the parallel FDTD method and 
hardware systems. In Chapter 4, we present the important considerations in the

electromagnetic simulations through some representative examples. In Chapter 5, 
we present typical examples, which are used as the benchmarks simulated by 
using the commercial software based on the FDTD, FEM, MoM, and FIT 
methods. The authors do not take any responsibilities for the accuracy and 
performance experienced by the user. Finally, in Chapter 6, we present several 
large examples that are simulated by using the parallel conformal FDTD method.  
The appendixes present some FDTD-related techniques that can help readers 
understand the results generated by using commercial software packages, or help 
extend the ability of the home-grown FDTD code.

Computational Electromagnetic Methods 
 
 
Developed with computer technology, computational electromagnetics (CEM) has 
become the primary tool for the design of antenna and microwave circuit 
components, EMC/EMI analysis, and the prediction of radio propagation. A wide 
variety of packages are currently available, and some of the popular commercial 
EM software packages include high frequency simulation solver (HFSS) 
(http://www.ansoft.com) that is based on the finite element method (FEM); 
computer simulation solver (CST) (http://www.cst.com) microwave studio that 
utilizes the finite integration techniques (FIT); general electromagnetic solver 
(GEMS) (http://www.2comu.com) that is built on a parallelized conformal FDTD 
algorithm; and, FEKO (http://www.feko.com) that is based on the method of 
moments (MoM) and the fast multiple method (FMM). In addition, many 
wonderful home-grown CEM codes, for example, Professor Allen Taflove’s group 
at Northwestern University, Professor Raj Mittra’s group at Pennsylvania State 
University, Professor Qin Liu’s group at Duke University, and Professor Yang 
Hao’s group at Queen Mary University of London, have been successfully applied 
to the various practical problems. 
1.1  FDTD METHOD 
The FDTD method utilizes the central difference approximation to discretize the 
two Maxwell’s curl equations, namely, Faraday’s and Ampere’s laws, in both the 
time and spatial domains, and then solves the resulting equations numerically to 
derive the electric and magnetic field distributions at each time step using an 
explicit leapfrog scheme. The FDTD solution, thus derived, is second-order 
accurate and is stable if the time step is chosen to satisfy the certain condition.  
1.1.1  FDTD Update Equations 
In Yee’s scheme [1], the computational domain is discretized by using a 
rectangular grid. The electric fields are located along the edges of the electric 
elements, while the magnetic fields are sampled at the centers of the electric 
element surfaces and are oriented normal to these surfaces, this being consistent 

2                                            Advanced FDTD Methods 
with the duality property of the electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations. 
A typical electric unit is shown in Figure 1.1.      
 
Figure 1.1    
Positions of the electric and magnetic fields defined in Yee’s FDTD scheme. 
The FDTD utilizes rectangular pulses as base functions in both the time and 
spatial domains, implying that the electric field is uniformly distributed along the 
edge of electric element, while the distribution of the magnetic fields is uniform on 
the surface of the electric unit. In addition, in the time domain, the electric fields 
are sampled at times n∆t, and are assumed to be uniform in the time period of 
(n−1/2)Δt to (n+1/2)Δt. Similarly, the magnetic fields are sampled at (n+1/2)Δt, 
and are assumed to be uniform in the period of nΔt to (n+1)Δt. The FDTD 
algorithm constructs a solution to the following two Maxwell’s curl equations:

where ε and σ, μ and σM are the electric and magnetic parameters of the material, 
respectively. The anisotropic material can be described by using different values of 
dielectric parameters along the different directions. Equations (1.2a) to (1.2f) form 
the foundation of the FDTD algorithm for modeling interaction of the 
electromagnetic waves with arbitrary three-dimensional objects embedded in 
arbitrary media and excited by a given excitation source. Using the conventional 
notations, the discretized fields in the time and spatial domains can be written in

It is useful to note that the electric and magnetic fields in the discretized 
version are staggered in both time and space. For instance, the electric and 
magnetic fields are sampled at the time steps nΔt and (n+1/2)Δt, respectively, and 
are also displaced from each other in space, as shown in Figure 1.1. Therefore, we 
need to interpolate the sampled electric and magnetic fields in order to measure the 
electric and magnetic fields in the continuous spatial and time domains. Ignoring 
this field-sampling offset in the Fourier transforms may result in a significant error 
at high frequencies.

 (1.4f) 
 
We point out that, for simplicity, we have omitted the explicit indices for the 
material parameters, which share the same indices with the corresponding field 
components. Equations (1.4a) through (1.4f) do not contain any explicit boundary 
information, and we need to augment them with an appropriate boundary condition 
in order to truncate the computational domain. In the FDTD simulation, some of 
the commonly used boundary conditions include those associated with the perfect 
electric conductor (PEC), the perfect magnetic conductor (PMC), the absorbing 
boundary condition (ABC), and the periodic boundary condition (PBC). In 
addition to the above boundary conditions, we also need to handle the interfaces 
between different media in an inhomogeneous environment. In accordance with the 
assumption of the locations of the electric and magnetic fields, the magnetic field 
is located along the line segment joining the two centers of adjacent cells. 
Consequently, the effective magnetic parameter corresponding to this magnetic 
field is the weighted average of the parameters of the material that fills the two 
adjacent cells. Unlike the magnetic field, the loop used to compute the electric field 
is likely to be distributed among four adjacent cells; therefore, the effective electric 
parameter corresponding to this electric field is equal to the weighted average of 
electric parameters of the material that fills these four cells. In addition, the curved 
PEC and dielectric surfaces require the use of conformal FDTD technique [5, 6] 
for accurate modeling.        
In recent years, research on the FDTD method has focused on the following 
three topics: improving the conventional FDTD algorithm and employing the 
conformal version instead in order to reduce the error introduced by the staircasing 
approximation; using a subgridding scheme in the FDTD technique to increase the 
local resolution [7−9]; and employing the alternative direction implicit (ADI) 
FDTD algorithm [10, 11] to increase the time step. In addition, new FDTD 
algorithms such as the multiresolution time-domain (MRTD) method [12] and the 
pseudospectrum time-domain (PSTD) technique [13] have been proposed with a 
view to lowering the spatial sampling. Yet another strategy, which has been found 
to be more robust as compared to the MRTD and PSTD, is to parallelize the 
conformal code [4, 14−16] and enhance it with either subgridding, the ADI 
algorithm, or both. The parallel FDTD algorithm gains the computational 
efficiency by distributing the burden on a cluster. It also enables one to solve large 
problems that could be beyond the scope of a single processor because of CPU 
time limitations.

1.1.2  Stability Analysis 
One of the critical issues that we must address when developing a code that utilizes 
the marching-on-time technique is the stability of the algorithm. The stability 
characteristic of the FDTD algorithm depends upon the nature of the physical 
model, differencing technique employed, and the quality of the mesh structure. To 
understand the nature of the stability characteristic, we express the dispersion 
relationship as follows [4]:

in order for the solution to be stable. The criterion above is called the stability 
condition for the FDTD method, and it is referred to as Courant condition (or the 
Courant, Friedrichs, and Lewy criterion) [17]. Equation (1.7) indicates that the 
time step is determined by the cell sizes in the x-, y-, and z-directions, and the 
speed of light in the medium. 
To help the reader gain further physical insight into (1.7), we simplify (1.7) to 
a 1-D case, where the Courant condition is simplified to Δt≤Δx/c. The time 
required for the field to propagate from the nth to (n+1)th node is obviously 
Δt=Δx/c.  In the FDTD simulations, let us suppose we choose a time step Δt≥Δx/c, 
then the algorithm yields a nonzero field value before the wave can reach the 
(n+1)th node, traveling at the speed of light. This would violate causality and result 
in an unstable solution.

1.1.3  Boundary Conditions 
It is well known that boundary conditions play a very important role in FDTD 
simulations, because they are used to truncate the computational domain when 
modeling an open region problem. Though the original FDTD algorithm was 
proposed as early as 1966, it was not really used to solve practical problems until 
the early 1980s when Mur’s absorbing boundary [18] was proposed. Though Mur’s 
absorbing boundary condition is relatively simple, and while it has been 
successfully used to solve many engineering problems, it has room for 
improvement in terms of accuracy of the solution it generates. To improve its 
accuracy, Mei and Fang [19] introduced the so-called superabsorption technique, 
while Chew [20] proposed to employ Liao’s boundary condition—both of which 
exhibit better characteristics than Mur’s, especially for obliquely incident waves. 
However, many of these absorbing boundary conditions were found to suffer from 
either an instability problem or inaccurate solution, and the quest for robust and 
effective boundary conditions continued unabated until the perfectly matched layer 
(PML) was introduced by J. P. Berenger [21], and several other versions [22−24] 
have been proposed since then. In contrast to the other boundary conditions such as 
those of Mur and Liao, the PML can absorb the incoming waves at all frequencies 
as well as for all incident angles. The perfect electric conductor (PEC) is a natural 
boundary for electromagnetic waves, since it totally reflects the waves falling upon 
it. When the PEC condition is applied to truncate the FDTD computational domain, 
it simply forces the tangential electric fields on the domain boundary to be zero. In 
common with the PEC, the perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) also is a natural 
type of boundary condition for electromagnetic waves, and it is also totally 
reflecting. However, unlike the PEC, the PMC is not physical, but it is merely an 
artifice. Both the PEC and PMC are often used to take advantage of the symmetry 
of the object geometry with a view to reducing the size of the computational 
domain. In this section, we focus on the time convolution PML [25], one of the 
most popular PML formats. Although the PML is named to be an absorbing 
boundary condition, in fact, it is an anisotropic material—albeit mathematical—
which is inserted in the periphery of the computational domain in order to absorb 
the outgoing waves.           
Before introducing the PML boundary conditions, we first investigate their 
role in the FDTD simulations. In the FDTD, Maxwell’s equations that govern the 
relationship between the electric and magnetic fields in the time and spatial 
domains are translated into difference equations, which do not explicitly contain 
any boundary information. It is necessary, therefore, to combine the difference 
equations with the appropriate boundary conditions in order to carry out the mesh 
truncation as a preamble to solving these equations. Generally speaking, there are 
two types of boundary conditions that we require in the FDTD simulations: the 
interface condition between different media, and the outer boundary condition for 
mesh truncation. In this chapter, we only discuss the latter, namely, the boundary 
that is used to truncate the computational domain.

Equation (1.17) is the desirable updated equation that we have been seeking to 
retain the advantages of the unsplit PML, and overcome its drawback at the same 
time. In common with the conventional FDTD, the electric field updating inside 
the PML region only requires the magnetic fields around it and the value of ψ at 
the previous time step. The same statement is true for the magnetic field update as 
well. The time convolution PML does not require additional information exchange 
in the parallel FDTD simulation, over and above that in the conventional FDTD.

1.2  METHOD OF MOMENTS 
During the last several decades, there has been a proliferation of numerical 
methods in electromagnetics. In 1968, Harrington identified a unifying concept for 
them and called it the method of moments (MoM) [26, 27], which we will briefly 
summarize next. The MoM is a widely used numerical technique for electro-
magnetic problems such as radiation and scattering problems. In this method, we 
solve the problem by first casting it into an operator equation, usually of the 
integral or integro-differential type. The unknowns are then expanded in terms of a 
finite number of well-chosen basis functions; this process is called discretization. 
A set of matrix equations is then generated by performing a symmetric or scalar 
product between the operator equation and a set of selected testing functions. The 
resulting matrix equation is solved by using a direct or iteration method. The latter 
is often the preferred choice for large matrices.  
A typical operator equation can be expressed as: 
 
h
Lf =
                                                                        (1.24)

where L is a linear operator, which may be either a differential or integral type, or a 
combination thereof; h is a known function; and f is an unknown function that will 
be solved for.  These functions can be either a scalar or a vector, and their domain 
can be 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D space. The basic steps used to solve the electromagnetic 
problems using MoM are described as follows:  
 
1. Select f1, f2, …, fN as a set of basis functions, and let the unknown function

2. Select a set of weight functions, w1, w2, …, wn, and multiply each term in 
(1.25) with these functions, and integrate them in the domain space to 
generate a set of linear equations:

We can calculate the unknown function ( )x
f
 when the coefficients an (n =1, 2, 
…, N) in (1.25) is solved. 
If a problem only includes the PEC objects, the unknown current functions are 
located on the surface of objects, MoM actually solves a 2-D problem though the 
objects are 3-D. For a problem involved with dielectric, MoM will not be efficient 
since the unknown functions will be distributed in a 3-D region. Though some 
commercial software packages today claim that the unknown functions can be on 
the surface of dielectric objects for the simple shaped objects, the simulation time 
spent on the dielectric objects will be increased significantly. Generally speaking, 
MoM is good for the scattering problems of pure PEC objects. 
In the MoM method, the memory usage is in direct proportion to the N2 if the 
number of unknowns is N, namely, O(N2). The number of floating operations using 

Computational Electromagnetic Methods                            13 
 
 
the Gaussian elimination algorithm to solve the matrix equations will be in direct 
proportion to N3, namely, O(N2). However, the number of floating operations using 
the conjugate method or other iteration techniques to solve the matrix equations 
will be O(N2), where the index i is the preset number for the error control. 
Compared to the finite-difference methods, MoM is relatively simulation time and 
memory consuming.   
The fast multiple method (FMM) is a mathematical technique that was 
developed to speed up the calculation of long-ranged forces in the N-body 
problem. It does this by expanding the system’s Green function using a multiple 
expansion, which allows one to group sources that lie close together and treat them 
as if they are a single source. 
The FMM has also been applied in accelerating the iterative solver in MoM as 
applied to computational electromagnetics problems. FMM was first introduced in 
this manner by Greengard and Rokhlin and is based on the multiple expansion of 
the vector Helmholtz equation. By treating the interactions between faraway basis 
functions using the FMM, the corresponding matrix elements do not need to be 
explicitly stored, resulting in a significant reduction in required memory. If the 
FMM is then applied in a hierarchical manner, it can improve the complexity 
matrix-vector product in an iterative solver from O(N 2) to O(N log N). This has 
expanded the area of applicability of the MoM to far greater problems than were 
previously possible. 
FMM, introduced by Greengard  and Rokhlin, has been acclaimed as one of 
the top ten algorithms of the twentieth century. The FMM algorithm dramatically 
reduces the complexity of matrix-vector multiplication involving a certain type of 
dense matrix, which can arise out of many physical systems.     
1.3  FINITE ELEMENT METHOD 
The finite element method [28, 29] has become a powerful tool throughout 
engineering for its flexibility and versatility, being used in complicated structural, 
thermal, fluid flow, semiconductor, and electromagnetic problems. This method is 
particularly advantageous for electromagnetic field problems, because of its 
applicability to waveguides with arbitrary shape, arbitrary refractive index profile, 
and even anisotropy. However, FEM is more suitable for the closed space 
problems such as waveguide and cavities because it does not have a high 
performance absorbing boundary as FDTD does.   
Finite element formulations are usually established via a variational or a 
Galerkin approach. The latter is more flexible, but when it is possible, it is 
advantageous to take a variational approach, especially when one global parameter 
(like propagation constant) is needed. Steps of the finite element method are listed 
here: 
 
1. Find an equivalent variational equation for the differential equation. 
2. Discretize the whole domain of the problem into a number of sub-
domains (for the region where the function changes sharply, the lattice 

14                                            Advanced FDTD Methods 
should be densified). Number the elements and the nodes sequentially.  
3. Interpolate the function within each subdomain by the function values at 
the surrounding nodes.  
4. Derive the linear equations from the equivalent variational problem. 
5. Solve the linear equations. 
We will briefly introduce the basic idea of finite element methods; namely, 
scalar finite element method and vector finite element method.  
1.3.1  Scalar Formulation 
Several different variational formulations have been proposed for use with the 
finite element method. The simplest is a scalar one. In the finite element 
approximation, the primary dependent variables are replaced by a system of 
discretized variables over the domain of consideration. We first divide the entire 
domain into the elements, usually triangles or quadrilaterals. Triangles are 
commonly used because they are easy to adapt to complex shapes. Using many 
elements, any cross section with a complex boundary and with arbitrary 
permittivity distribution can be accurately approximated. The simplest triangular 
element assumes a linear interpolation between the field values at the vertices of 
the triangle. By expressing the fields in terms of nodal values and with the assumed 
shape functions, the resulting field components are continuous over the whole 
domain.  For example, to calculate the potential ϕ generated by a charge ρ 
distributed in the domain Ω,  we need to solve the Poisson equation 
 
(
)

                                                                (1.30) 
 
To find these nodal fields, the usual (Rayleigh-Ritz) procedure is to force 
stationarity of the functional with respect to each nodal variable. This yields a 
matrix eigenvalue equation, with vector x of nodal variables: 
 
b
K
=
ϕ
                                                                      (1.31) 
 
where K is an N×N symmetric matrix; ϕ is an N×1 vector, which is unknown; and 
b is a known vector, which is determined by the charge and boundary condition. 
This equation can be solved by one of various standard subroutines to get K. 
 
1.3.2  Vector Formulation 
 
The single scalar formulation can be generalized to vector formulation, which is 
very important because most 3-D problems need to be expressed in a vector field.  
However, some vector formulations are affected by spurious or nonphysical 
solutions that appear mixed with the correct ones in the computations. 

Computational Electromagnetic Methods                            15 
 
 
For example, we calculate the field distribution in the domain Ω generated by 
a current density 
imp
J
, and the domain Ω  is filled with the material ε and μ. The 
field in the domain Ω should be satisfied with the equation:

where E
r
is the unknown vector that will be solved, K
r
 is the matrix associated 
with the system, and the b
r
 is the known vector that is determined by the charge 
and boundary condition.    
1.4  FINITE INTEGRATION TECHNIQUE 
The finite integration technique (FIT) is a consistent formulation for the discrete 
representation of Maxwell’s equations on spatial grids. First proposed by Weiland 
[30] in 1977, the finite integration technique can be viewed as a generalization of 
the FDTD method. It is also similar to the finite element method. Weiland 
proposed an exact algebraic analog to Maxwell’s equations that guarantee physical 
properties of computed fields and lead to a unique solution. By discretizing the 
integral form of Maxwell’s equations on a pair of dual interlaced discretization 
grids, the finite integration technique generates so-called Maxwell’s grid equations 
(MGEs) that guarantee the physical properties of computed fields and lead to a 
unique solution.

where e is the electric voltage between the grid points and hÂ is the magnetic 
voltage between dual grid points. d, b, and jÂ are fluxes over grid or dual grid faces.

The allocation of the voltage and flux components on the dual grids is shown in 
Figure 1.2.

Due to the consistent transformation, the analytical properties of the fields are 
maintained resulting in corresponding discrete topological operators on the 
staggered grid duplet. The topology matrices C, C~ , A
Sˆ , and 
A

 correspond to 
the curl- and the div-operators. The tilde means that the operator is performed on 
the dual grid.

                                                                 (1.38)

where Mε, Mμ, and Mk are matrices describing the material properties. The relations 
in (1.34) through (1.37) are exact on a given mesh; however, the material matrices 
contain the unavoidable approximations of any numerical procedure. In addition, 
these matrices have diagonal form. 
Employing a so-called leapfrog scheme that samples values of e and h at times 
separated by a half time step, the MGEs can be rewritten as a set of two recursion 
formulas:

The calculation of each further time step only requires one matrix-vector  
multiplication. Thus, it has the advantage of being an explicit algorithm. FIT can 
be applied to different mesh types. On Cartesian grids, the time-domain FIT is 
equivalent to FDTD.

FDTD Optimization and Acceleration 
 
 
In this chapter, we introduce the FDTD acceleration technique based on the vector 
arithmetic logic unit (VALU) [1−4] that is built in the regular CPU. Unlike other 
hardware acceleration techniques, the VALU acceleration technique does not 
require any extra hardware device for the acceleration.  Each core in the regular 
CPU includes one floating-point unit (FPU) and one VALU. A regular FDTD code 
in C or FORTRAN only uses the FPU or one element in the VALU. The FDTD 
code can be accelerated significantly if we can use the VALU for the FDTD 
simulation since the VALU can work on the four operations simultaneously.   
The performance of a regular computer has been dramatically improved in the 
past several years [5−9]. Due to the use of 64-bit operating systems, today we can 
easily install 8-GB or 16-GB memory in a regular computer to solve the larger EM 
problems. However, the simulation speed for the practical problems becomes one 
of the major bottlenecks. The multiple core processor, computer cluster, and 
special GPU are designed for the simulation acceleration. In this chapter, we 
investigate the performance of the parallel FDTD method on the different hardware 
platforms such as the CPU with VALU acceleration, computer cluster, and GPU. 
Among the computational electromagnetic techniques, the FDTD method is 
parallel in nature since it requires only the field exchanging on the interface 
between the adjacent subdomains; therefore, the FDTD method has the higher 
parallel efficiency than other methods that require 3-D data exchanging. The 
parallel performance depends not only on the way we develop the FDTD code and 
physics model, but also on the hardware platform such as CPU type, network 
system, input/output (I/O) system, and the operating system as well. The parallel 
FDTD code is developed based on either open multiple processing (OpenMP) [10, 
11] or message passing Interface (MPI) library [12, 13]. OpenMP is developed for 
the efficient use of multicore processors and the MPI library is developed to use 
the distributed resource. The single instruction and multiple data (SIMD) [14−19] 
combined with OpenMP and MPI are used for accelerating the FDTD code on both 
the GPU [20−23] and VALU.  
Multicore processor and computer cluster have been successfully used for 
various large and complex electromagnetic problems for many years. Although a 

20                                            Advanced FDTD Methods 
large number of publications have been focused on the GPU acceleration, there are 
many challenging issues today for GPU to solve practical electromagnetic 
problems. In this chapter, we focus on a new acceleration technique that is based 
on the VALU built in the regular CPU. The readers who desire to learn the detailed 
computer cluster and GPU acceleration techniques can refer to the literature on 
those topics. Each core in the modern computer processor includes one FPU and 
one VALU. The VALU is operated by using the streaming SIMD extensions (SSE) 
in the Intel processor. Intel introduced the SSE in early 1999 with the Prescott 
revision of their Pentium 3 CPU. In April 2005, AMD introduced a subset of SSE3 
in revision E of Athlon 64 CPUs. The regular FDTD code without using the 
VALU acceleration only uses FPU or one of four VALU components; however, 
the VALU in principle will accelerate the FDTD code four times since the VALU 
can handle four operations simultaneously. The performance of FDTD code with 
the VALU acceleration strongly depends on the FDTD structure including the 
update equations, boundary condition, material array structure, near-to-far-field 
transformation, dispersive medium types, periodic boundary condition, and 
conformal technique.  
2.1  INTRODUCTION TO CPU ARCHITECTURE 
Each core in the multicore processor has its own cache, FPU and VALU, as shown 
in Figure 2.1. Unlike FPU, VALU allows us to operate on four blocks of data at 
the same time. We use the VALU through the SIMD instruction set to accelerate 
the parallel FDTD method.  
 
Figure 2.1    
CPU architecture including the floating-point unit (FPU) and the vector arithmetic logic 
unit (VALU).  
The Pentium 4 processor, and each core on a Pentium D CPU, could execute 
one SIMD instruction every two clock cycles. Intel streamlines the SSE execution 
unit, making it 128 bits wide throughout. In addition, Core 2 offers three SSE 
execution units. The net result is that 128-bit-wide SSE instructions can be

executed in a single clock cycle. This can substantially speed up the FDTD 
simulation that uses Intel’s streaming SIMD (SSE/SSE2/SSE3) instruction set.  
2.2  SSE INSTRUCTION SET 
SSE is a newer SIMD extension to the Intel Pentium III and AMD AthlonXP 
microprocessors. SSE [4] adds a separate register space to the microprocessor. 
Because of this, SSE can only be used on operating systems that support it. All 
versions of Windows since Windows 98 support SSE, as do Linux kernels since 
2.2. 
SSE adds eight new 128-bit registers, divided into four 32-bit (single 
precision) floating-point values. These registers are called XMM0−XMM7. An 
additional control register, MXCSR, is also available to control and check the 
status of SSE instructions. 
SSE gives us access to 70 new instructions that operate on these 128-bit 
registers, MMX registers, and sometimes even regular 32-bit registers.

FZ mode causes all underflowing operations to simply go to zero. This saves 
some processing time, but loses precision. 
The R+, R-, RN, and RZ rounding modes determine how the lowest bit is 
generated. Normally, RN is used. 
PM, UM, MM, ZM, DM, and IM are masks that tell the processor to ignore 
the exceptions that happen, if they do. This keeps the program from having to deal 
with problems, but might cause invalid results. 
DAZ tells the CPU to force all denormals to zero. A denormal is a number that 
is so small that FPU cannot renormalize it due to limited exponent ranges. They are 
just like normal numbers, but they take considerably longer to process. Note that 
not all processors support DAZ. 
PE, UE, ME, ZE, DE, and IE are the exception flags that are set if they 
happen, and are not unmasked. Programs can check these to see if something 
interesting happened. These bits are “sticky,” which means that once they are set, 
they stay set forever until the program clears them. This means that the indicated 
exception could have happened several operations ago, but nobody bothered to 
clear it. 
DAZ was not available in the first version of SSE. Since setting a reserved bit 
in MXCSR causes a general protection fault, we need to be able to check the 
availability of this feature without causing problems. To do this, one needs to set 
up a 512-byte area of memory to save the SSE state to, using fxsave, and then one 
needs to inspect bytes 28 through 31 for the MXCSR_MASK value. If bit 6 is set, 
DAZ is supported; otherwise, it is not.

With prefetching, it is okay to access an invalid memory location (i.e., off the end

2.3  CACHE OPTIMIZATION 
Cache optimization plays an important role in the FDTD code optimization, which 
will decide how we can efficiently use the CPU calculation units. In the cache, L1 
cache is faster than any other cache and memory, as shown in Figure 2.2. It is the 
large L1, L2, and L3 caches that make the CPU with several cores faster than a 
GPU in the general FDTD applications.    
 
Figure 2.2    
Memory and cache priority levels in the CPU during the simulation. The cache closer to 
the calculating unit is faster.

2.4    TASK PARALLELIZATION AND BUNDLING 
Using OpenMP, the FDTD simulation will be split into the several segments based 
on the available number of cores that are assigned to each core. However, the 
processes will be switched among the cores, as shown in Figure 2.3.   
 
Figure 2.3    
OpenMP working diagram on the multicore processor. The jobs are switched between 
the cores, namely, the operating system needs to allocate the job distribution 
dynamically.   
 
The working way shown in Figure 2.3 has a very low efficiency because the 
jobs are switched from one core to another one. We can allocate each thread to a 
specified physical core, respectively, with processor affinity. The efficiency is 
much higher than the way shown in Figure 2.4 by improving the cache hit ratio. 
 
Figure 2.4    
After the job bundling treatment, the jobs are bundled on the specified cores during the 
simulation.  
2.5  PREFETCH 
In addition to the SIMD instructions, both Intel and AMD also provide the 
instructions that let us specify how we want the data to interact with the system 
cache. The prefetching allows us to preload a specific address into a special

nontemporal area of the L1 cache, which is guaranteed not to displace any data that 
was loaded into the cache due to more legitimate reasons. Essentially, we use 
prefetching to indicate that we want the data at the specified address to be in the 
cache, so we can read to (or write from) it exactly once, at which point it will not 
be used again. For example, we load the magnetic fields into the cache before 
calculating the electric fields at the first step, as shown in Figure 2.5. When the 
CPU calculates the electric fields we load the magnetic fields for the calculation of 
the next electric fields.  
 
Figure 2.5   
Prefetching reduces the executing time by preparing the calculation data during the 
simulation to reduce the memory transfer time since the memory transfer time is 
dominating in the FDTD simulation. 
2.6  READING OR WRITING COMBINATION 
Reading or writing two objects from memory one right after the other is faster than 
reading or writing one object, then running a lot of code, then reading or writing 
the other object. With a bit of reorganization, we can apply a similar method to the 
VALU multiplier to accelerate the simulation, as shown in Figure 2.6.

writing operations.

Writing data to memory during the simulation is a common operation. If each 
communication setup is only for one data writing and the communication setup is 
only one time for each data, the efficiency will be extremely slow. For example, if 
we are doing things like transforming entire data into memory, this will be much 
faster than if we write the data one by one.  
CPU accesses to memory by cache line unit, especially to write memory. CPU 
tries to write data to cache and then the memory control will write it at an 
appropriate time.  
2.7  MATERIAL LOOP-UP TABLE 
The material distribution for each component is expressed as a sparse 3-D array. 
This representation has two major disadvantages: (1) the memory usage is 
expensive, and (2) the cache hit rate is relatively low. An efficient way is to 
express the material distribution as a table plus an integer 3-D array, as shown in 
Figure 2.7. 
 
  
 
Figure 2.7    
Create a material chain table and map the material type into the table to improve the 
cache hit rate.  
2.8  NUMA OPTIMIZATION 
The memory priority in the symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) system is in the 
same level to all the processors in the system, as shown in Figure 2.8. The 
OpenMP and MPI assign each subdomain to the cores in the system and the 
performance will be desired but the high-performance system is very costly.  
In contrast to the SMP system, the nonuniform memory access or nonuniform 
memory architecture (NUMA) [24−30], as shown in Figure 2.9, is a computer 
memory design used in multiple processors, where the memory access time 
depends on the memory location relative to a processor. Under the NUMA 
architecture, a processor can access its own local memory faster than nonlocal 
memory, that is, memory local to another processor or memory shared between

processors. To achieve better software performance, the multiple processor 
workstations today use the NUMA architecture.  
 
Figure 2.8    
In an SMP system, each processor has the same priority to access to all the memory 
installed in the system.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.9    
Each processor has its own memory in the nonuniform memory access system, and the 
local memory is much faster than the memory that is accessed through the network.  
 
In the FDTD simulation, we need to place the data associated with one 
processor in its own memory to achieve the best simulation performance. The 
special memory allocation technique is required for this type of memory 
optimization control in the multiple processor computer. 
Intel and AMD use the different NUMA architecture. Intel QuickPath 
technology, as shown in Figure 2.10, is a platform architecture that provides high 
speed (up to 25.6 GB/s), point-to-point connections between processors, and 
between processors and the I/O hub. Each processor has its own dedicated memory 
that it accesses directly though an integrated memory controller. In cases where a 
processor needs to access the dedicated memory of another processor, it can do so 
through a high-speed Intel QuickPath interconnect (Intel QPI) that links all the 
processors.         
Unlike Intel QuickPath technology, AMD uses the 16-bit Hyper Transport 3 
technology (H3) links, up to 6.4 GT/s per link, as shown in Figure 2.11.

2.9  IMPLEMENTATION OF VALU FDTD METHOD 
In this subsection, we use the electric field component update as an example to 
explain how the FDTD code is accelerated by using VALU. For example, the 
electric field Ez can be expressed as follows [8, 9]:

where  Ez_Coeff, Hx_Coeff, and Hy_Coeff are coefficients in the field update 
equations [4]. Using the following procedure VALU can be used to compute four 
Ez at the same time to accelerate the simulation, which is described as follows: 
• Load the coefficient of the magnetic field Hy into the SSE registers. 
• Load the coefficient of the magnetic field Hx into the SSE registers. 
• Convert the float pointer to the SSE 128-bit pointer.   
• Calculate the difference of magnetic fields. 
• Multiply the difference of magnetic fields and their coefficients. 
• Calculate the contribution of magnetic fields to the electric fields. 
• Multiply the previous electric fields and their coefficients.  
• Calculate the electric fields and write them to memory. 
for( i = 0; i <= nx; i ++ ) { 
  vHi_Coeff =_mm_load1_ps( &Hi_Coeff ); //load single float value to vector 
  for( j = 0; j <= ny; j++) { 
      vHj_Coeff =_mm_load1_ps( &Hj_Coeff ); //load single float value to 
//vector 
      vEz  = (__m128 * )Ez[i][j]; 
      vHy  = (__m128 * )Hy[i][j]; 
      vHx  = (__m128 * )Hx[i][j]; 
      vHy_minus = (__m128 * )Hy[i-1][j]; 
      vHx_minus = (__m128 * )Hx[i][j-1]; 
      for( k = 0, vk = 0; k < nz; k += 4, vk ++ ) { 
          vEk_Coeff = _mm_load1_ps( &Ek_Coeff ); 
          xmm0 = _mm_sub_ps( vHx[vk], vHx_minus[vk] ); 
          xmm0 = _mm_mul_ps( vHj_Coeff, xmm0 ); 
          xmm1 = _mm_sub_ps( vHy[vk], vHy_minus [vk] ); 
          xmm1 = _mm_mul_ps( vHi_Coeff, xmm1 ); 
          xmm0 = _mm_sub_ps( xmm1, xmm0 ); 
          xmm1 = _mm_mul_ps(vEk[vk], vEk_Coeff); 
          vEk[vk] = _mm_add_ps(xmm1, xmm0); 
               }   }     } 
Using the VALU and this procedure can significantly accelerate the 
multiplication operation compared to the traditional FDTD code. In any case, the 
data continuity in the FDTD code and memory bandwidth are the most important 
factors for the VALU acceleration. To evaluate the performance of the FDTD 
code, we define the performance as follows:

For example, the performance of a regular parallel conformal FDTD code on 
an Intel Core i7-965 3.2GHz is 87 Mcells/sec, as shown in Figure 2.12. If we apply 
the optimized synchronization technique on the parallel FDTD code, the 
performance increases to 124 Mcells/sec. When we implement the VALU 
acceleration technique on the parallel conformal FDTD code, the performance 
increases to 191 Mcells/sec. Besides the field update module, further optimization 
on the material list table, cache usage, dispersive medium, and near-to-far-field 
transformation will also significantly improve the FDTD performance, as shown in 
Figure 2.12.  
 
 
Figure 2.12    Performance improvement of the parallel FDTD code using the optimized VALU 
acceleration technique.  
 
Now we use the parallel conformal FDTD code to simulate an ideal test case 
that is a hollow box with the simplest excitation and output; its domain is truncated 
by using the perfect electric conductor (PEC). We ran the problem with the 
different sizes using the regular FDTD code (Intel Core i7-965), and the FDTD 
code with the VALU (Intel Core i7-965 with four VALUs, the total memory 
bandwidth is 32 GB). The simulation summary is plotted in Figure 2.13. It is 
observed from Figure 2.13 that the peak performance of the VALU FDTD code is 
four times faster than the FDTD code on a regular CPU for the ideal test case.  
In contrast to the Intel processor, we need to make the slight changes on the 
parallel FDTD code to fit the AMD architecture. We investigate the performance 
of the parallel conformal FDTD code on the AMD Opteron 6128 processor and 
Intel Xeon X5550 processor. For the same ideal test case, the problem size 
increases from 8 Mcells to 125 Mcells and the performance of parallel conformal

FDTD code on NVIDIA Tesla C1060 (30 SMs (Streaming Multiprocessor) /240 
cores and the memory bandwidth is 109 GB/s), two AMD Opteron 6128 2.0 GHz 
processors (total memory bandwidth is 85 GB/s) with total 16 VALUs, and two 
Intel Xeon X5550 2.7-GHz processors (the total memory bandwidth is 64 GB/s) 
with total 8 VALUs. It is observed from Figure 2.14 that the performance of 
parallel conformal FDTD code on two AMD Opteron 6128 CPUs or on two Intel 
Xeon X5550 CPUs is just slightly slower than NVIDIA Tesla C1060. Now we use 
two computers (each of them includes two Intel Xeon X5550 CPUs, and the total 
memory bandwidth is 128 GB and the total number of VALUs is 16) to run the 
parallel FDTD code with the VALU acceleration, and its maximum performance 
can reach more than 840 Mcells/second, which is much faster than the GPU Tesla 
C1060 (www.nvidia.com, 240 cores) for all the sizes of problems, as shown in 
Figure 2.14. Two computers are connected through the Ethernet network with the 
bandwidth of 10 Gbps.  
 
 
Figure 2.13   FDTD performance on the Intel CPU and Intel CPU plus VALU for the ideal test case. 
 
Due to the discontinuous data in the PML boundary, the PML boundary [31, 
32] will reduce 50% performance of the GPU code. However, the PML boundary 
only reduces 20% performance of the FDTD code on the VALU due to the large 
available cache in the CPU. For the same reason, the FDTD code on the VALU is 
much faster than that on the GPU for handling dispersive medium and conformal 
cells.  
For the practical problems, the project model handling, material preprocessing, 
mesh generation, far-field pattern calculation, and large range of surface current 
outputs are the major bottleneck of GPU code; hence, they are extremely time- 
consuming for the GPU code. However, all those options match very well to the 
CPU architecture and especially for the CPU cluster with the domain 
decomposition techniques.

Parallel FDTD Method and Systems 
 
 
In this chapter, we introduce the parallel FDTD method and parallel processing 
system including the network system. The brief introduction to the parallel systems 
helps the readers understand the electromagnetic simulation performance.  
3.1  PARALLEL FDTD METHOD 
In the parallel processing technique, the original problem is divided into small 
pieces, and the FDTD code assigns each piece to each computer. Each computer in 
the cluster only needs to simulate the specified subdomain, as shown in Figure 3.1. 
 
 
Figure 3.1    Basic idea of parallel processing FDTD simulation on a computer cluster, in which the 
original job is split into small pieces that are then  assigned to each core/processor/node.  
A complete FDTD simulation is carried out in two steps, namely, project 
preprocessing and project simulation. In the first step, the FDTD code generates 
the material distribution based on the geometry information and the specified 
mesh. In this procedure, each core in a cluster does not have to wait for others, 
since it does not need to borrow any information from its neighbors. Due to the 
complexity of the need to mesh and the fact that the object structure in each 
subdomain may be different, the processing time needed in each subdomain may 
vary for different cores. In order to speed up the preprocessing procedure, we do 
Computer Cluster
Single Computer

38                                            Advanced FDTD Methods 
not have to let the number of subdomains equal to the number of cores and the 
cores carrying on the simple subdomains can work on more subdomains without 
the need to wait for the other cores, as illustrated in Figure 3.2. In contrast to the 
project preprocessing, the FDTD update processing in each subdomain must be 
synchronized at each time step. Therefore, we will not allow the core to switch 
from one subdomain to another during the simulation.      
 
Figure 3.2    
Break the original job into small pieces, each core in the cluster will handle one piece at 
one time. Since all the related information is localized, the project preprocessing 
including material distribution and mesh generation is more efficient. 
The field update in the FDTD method only requires the information around it, 
namely, it is one of the highly parallelized methods. Let us start from one 
component of Maxwell’s equations [1, 2]:

Parallel FDTD Methods and Systems                          39 
 
 
However, for the parallel code, the fields on the boundary of each subdomain are 
unknown, but they are calculated by borrowing some information from the 
adjacent subdomains. Therefore, we need the high-performance network to 
transform the information from one computer to another one at each time step. In 
contrast to other electromagnetic simulation techniques, the parallel FDTD method 
only requires passing the fields on the interface between the adjacent computers. 
For example, considering (3.2) in Figure 3.3, the electric field Ez is located on the 
interface between the processors 1 and 2. Update of this electric field needs two 
magnetic fields Hy1, namely,

3.2  OPENMP FOR MULTICORE PROCESSORS 
All processing units are now following a many-core architecture trend. A major 
challenge to address is the fact that parallel hardware requires parallel 
programming to take advantage of multiple available resources. OpenMP [3] is an 
implementation of multithreading, in which the master thread splits a specified 
number of slave threads and runs the threads concurrently on different processors. 
During simulation, the operating system will assign the compute resource to the 
FDTD code depending on the processor status. For example, when you run a 
parallel FDTD code on a quad core processor, if all four cores are available, the 
FDTD code will use all cores; otherwise, the FDTD code will share the compute 
cores with other application codes.  
The parallel processing is carried out on a multiple core processor via the use 
of OpenMP algorithm. The cores inside one processor share the same host name; 
hence, we do not need to divide the domain into a number of subdomains or to 
assign the job to an individual core for the simulation. 
Like the multiple core processor, the multiple processor computer also uses 
the OpenMP to speed up the simulation (see Figure 3.4). Today, we can easily 
place four processors in one computer. AMD company has released the 12-core 
processor, namely, one 4-CPU computer can include 48 cores and 48 VALUs. Intel 
has released its 8-core processor, which has a similar performance to the AMD 
processor. The Intel processor has a higher clock frequency than the AMD; it can 
process more operations in the same cycle than the AMD and it optimizes the 
cache hit rate better than the AMD. However, since the AMD has a greater number 
of VALUs in a similar-level CPU than the Intel, the VALU-based FDTD code on 
the AMD is more cost-efficient than the Intel.

can easily place four CPUs with 48 cores and 48 VALUs inside one computer. 
 
Though OpenMP has slightly lower performance than MPI on the same 
platform, the FDTD code based on OpenMP is much simpler than the MPI.

3.3  MPI TECHNIQUE 
Cluster computing, such as that possible with Beowulf class clusters, offers great 
potential for increasing the amount of computing power and communication 
resources available to large-scale applications. It is likely that the combined 
computational power of a cluster of powerful PCs connected to a high-speed 
network may exceed a stand-alone high-performance supercomputer. 
The MPI library [4] is one of the most widely used parallel processing 
standards, and it is a library description rather than a new programming language, 
and its functions can be called from a C, C++, or Fortran program. Prior to the 
development of the MPI between the 1980s and early 1990s, developers of parallel 
codes had to choose between portability, efficiency, price, and functionality. The 
situation improved dramatically, however, when in April 1992, a meeting was held 
at the American Parallel Research Center, where the basic contents of the MPI 
library were approved. Next, in a meeting of the MPI working group held in 
Minneapolis in November 1992, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory submitted a 
report on the parallel MPI for the very first time. This conference also created an 
MPI forum that included 175 scientists and engineers from 40 research institutes 
and universities. The first version of the MPI library was introduced in a 
supercomputer conference in 1993 and the freely downloadable versions of this 
library became available from the Web site in May 1994.  
A PC-based cluster (see Figure 3.5) is usually connected through a gigabit 
Ethernet switch. For a two-node cluster, one can directly connect two PCs together 
through a regular network cable, and the performance of the cluster would be good 
if the number of nodes is less than 4. There are no master or slave nodes in a PC 
cluster, and one can submit a job from any node in the cluster. The project input 
parameters can either be read from each node or from the node that is used for the 
job submission. This type of cluster is much cheaper than the high-performance 
cluster and each node in the cluster can be used either as an independent PC or as a 
compute node.    
One of the major advantages of the PC cluster is that the computers in the 
cluster can be used as a compute node for the parallel computing, and each 
computer in the cluster can also be used as a regular computer if necessary.   
The PC cluster connected by using the regular Gigabit Ethernet can usually 
have four computers at a reasonable parallel efficiency. When the number of 
computer nodes is more than four, we should use the faster network such as 10 
Gigabit Ethernet, InfiniBand network, or Myrinet network to achieve the better 
performance, as shown in Figure 3.6. Although the bandwidth of the network 
system may be very important, we care more about latency than the bandwidth 
because the latency is important in the implementation of the parallel FDTD 

42                                            Advanced FDTD Methods 
algorithm. Since only the fields on the interface will be exchanged between the 
adjacent neighbors in the parallel FDTD method, the burden on the network is 
relatively light compared to the methods that require the 3-D data exchanging 
between the adjacent neighbors. The popular cluster management software (PBS 
and SGE) [5, 6] requires an extra node as the master node for the cluster 
management, and this node does not participate in the simulation. The master node 
is usually installed on a fast and large hard drive to improve the system I/O. Its 
performance is very good even if the number of nodes is more than hundreds or 
thousands. 
 
 
Figure 3.5    
A four-port network switch can connect four regular PCs together to form a typical PC 
cluster. The network cost can be ignored compared to the computer price. 
 
The main features of the high-performance cluster include the high-
performance servers or workstations with ECC memory and fast network system.     
 
Figure 3.6    
A cluster with the high-performance servers installed with the ECC memory allows us 
extremely stably to run the projects for a long time [7]. 
 
We can also connect the lab or office computers through a high-performance 
network system to form a powerful cluster, as shown in Figure 3.7. This type of 
cluster can easily have over 20 computers with more than 100-gigabit memory.

intermediate-sized cluster.   
3.4  NETWORK CARD, SWITCH, AND CABLE 
Running large-scale parallel applications on a cluster imposes heavy demands on 
the communication network. Therefore, in the early 1970s, one of the design goals 
for cluster computing was to limit the amount of communication between hosts. 
However, due to the features of some applications, a certain degree of 
communication between hosts may be required. As a result, the performance 
bottleneck of the network severely limited the potential of cluster computing. 
Recent developments in the high-speed networks such as 10-Gb Ethernet, 
InfiniBand, and Myrinet, change the situation somewhat. These high-speed 
networks offer the minimum 10,000 megabits per second (Mbps). However, the 
maximum achievable bandwidth at the application level is still far away from the 
theoretical peak bandwidth. This major roadblock to achieving high-speed cluster 
communication is caused by the time required for the interaction between software 
and hardware components. 
Compared to the performance improvement on the CPU and memory, the 
progress on the network system including the network card, network cable, and 
network switch is not as fast as the CPU and memory. The bandwidth is an 
important factor for the high-performance computing; however, it is not so 
important for parallel FDTD software since the transform data is only on the 
interface of the adjacent subdomains. The most important factor in the parallel 
FDTD method is the latency that decides the parallel performance of the parallel 
FDTD method. Latency is the time taken for a sent packet of data to be received at 
the other end. It includes the time to encode the packet for transmission and 
transmit it, the time for that data to traverse the network equipment between the 
nodes, and the time to receive and decode the data. 
Gigabit Ethernet [8] is a basic network device that offers a cost-efficient 
design for simple PC cluster. The required network card is either integrated or 
independent, which is quipped in the most computers, as shown in Figure 3.8. The 
required cable can be either the Category 5 or Category 6 that is available in most 
electronics stores. However, its latency is about 120 μs to 160 μs.

Ethernet networking technology is now virtually ubiquitous; it has evolved 
from 10Base-T (IEEE 802.3) in 1983, Fast Ethernet (IEEE 802.3u) in 1995, and  
1-gigabit Ethernet (802.3z) in 1998 to 10-gigabit Ethernet (802.3ae) [9] in 2002. 
The 10-gigabit Ethernet standard provides a significant increase in bandwidth 
while maintaining compatibility with the installed base of 802.3-standard 
interfaces, to protect existing investments in Ethernet technology. The 10-gigabit 
Ethernet (see Figure 3.9) has been developed to support a wide range of 
applications from the enterprise network, through the edge and metro network, and 
into the wide area network. Its latency is from 2.6 μs to 4.0 μs.

Myrinet, as shown in Figure 3.10, is a high-speed local area networking 
system designed by Myricom to be used as an interconnect between multiple 
machines to form computer clusters. Myrinet has much lower protocol overhead 
than standards such as Ethernet, and therefore provides better throughput, less 
interference, and lower latency while using the host CPU. The end-to-end latency 
range ranges from 2.0 μs MPI latency to 3.2 μs [10].

InfiniBand, as shown in Figure 3.11, is a switched fabric communications link 
used in high-performance computing with high throughput and low latency. The 
InfiniBand architecture specification defines a connection between processor nodes 
and high-performance I/O nodes such as storage devices. The end-to-end latency 
range ranges from 1.07 μs MPI latency to 2.6 μs.

The cost of the network cable is relatively cheap compared to the expensive 
computers and high-performance network devices. However, if the network cable 
becomes a bottleneck, the system performance will be significantly degraded. 
There are two types of popular network cables, Category 5 and 6 cables, as shown 
in Figure 3.12. Compared with Category 5, Category 6 features more stringent 
specifications for crosstalk and system noise.

Electromagnetic Simulation Techniques  
 
 
In this chapter, we will introduce some key techniques in the FDTD simulation 
such as the mesh generation and boundary condition selection. Several typical 
examples such as antenna, antenna array, microwave filter, and signal integrity are 
employed to explain how to use the FDTD method to solve the practical 
electromagnetic problems.  
4.1  MESH GENERATION TECHNIQUES   
The mesh generation technique plays a key role in the FDTD simulation [1−3]. A 
proper mesh distribution can significantly accelerate the simulation process and 
can also reduce memory requirements. Even though we have a good 
electromagnetic tool at our disposal, as well as a powerful cluster on hand to carry 
out the simulation, it is still necessary to use the proper initial cell size to reduce 
the simulation time and the memory requirement without sacrificing accuracy. For 
example, a small gap or a narrow strip line, which is regarded as a fine structure, 
requires at least two cells to describe the field variation within it, as shown in 
Figure 4.1. This is true regardless of whether the gap is parallel or antiparallel to 
the FDTD coordinates.

It is not uncommon to have a fine structure in the problem model, which only 
serves as a bridge that connects two parts of the geometry. In this case, we do not 
need to use a small cell size to describe the field variation in the connecting 
structure. However, we must ensure the continuity of the geometry when modeling 
this type of structure. Figure 4.2(a) shows the model of a cell phone, which 
includes some fine structures, for instance, a thin connector that has a very small 
thickness and is slightly slanted, as shown in Figure 4.2(b). We need not use a 
small cell size to model its thickness, because it just functions as a connection. 
Since there may be many fine structures nearby, the adaptive mesh generation may 
not capture this fine feature. To circumvent this problem, we add a “key” point at 
one corner of the thin structure, so as to guarantee that the adaptive mesh model 
will capture the fine feature and ensure that the structure is not discontinuous, as 
shown in Figure 4.2(c).  Choosing the key point will force the mesh to pass 
through this point, as shown in Figure 4.3. However, we will still need to ensure 
that the mesh inside the fine structure is continuous.

Using a key point for a specially shaped structure can significantly reduce the number of   
unknowns. 
 
If a thin structure is parallel to the FDTD coordinates, the mesh generation 
scheme can capture it without having to use a small cell size. If the fine feature is 
oriented as shown in Figure 4.4(a), we cannot use just one or two key points to

describe this thin structure. If the conductance of the metal is not infinite, we are 
using the conductance of copper to model it, we should ensure that the intersection 
of the copper and mesh edges form a continuous path, as shown in Figure 4.4(b). If 
we are able to ignore the loss inside the structure, we can model it as a PEC, and 
the PEC shell model will guarantee that the structure is continuous. To generate a 
PEC shell, we select the surfaces of the thin structure and reduplicate one while 
specifying them as PECs. The PEC path is shown in Figure 4.4(c).

Figure 4.4    
Modeling of a thin connecting conductor structure. (a) The thin slanted structure may be 
PEC or copper. (b) If the thin slanted structure is copper, the conformal scheme shown 
in the black line will ensure that the thin structure is continuous using a relatively coarse 
mesh. (c) If the thin slanted structure is PEC, the parallel conformal FDTD code will 
convert it to the PEC shell and then model it using the conformal technique.    
Next, we consider a geometry that includes thin planar structures as shown in 
Figure 4.5(a). In this case we need not use the PEC ground thickness as a reference 
for the mesh generation scheme, provided we ignore the skin depth, and the 
conformal technique can handle this thin PEC structure. For example, if the 
thickness of the thin PEC plane is 0.01 mm, we can choose the minimum cell size 
to be 0.5 mm, as shown in Figure 4.5(b), and the simulation result will still be 
accurate. The mesh distribution for the thin copper structure is shown in Figure 
4.5(c). 
We should point out that the PEC and finite-conductor conformal techniques 
utilize different strategies to model the structures. If an edge intersects with a 
conductor in the finite-conductor model, this edge will also be a finite-conductor. 
However, the PEC conformal technique will only include the contribution of the 
PEC part. For example, if the two thin plates are modeled by using the finite-
conductor model, and we model the dielectric between the two conductors by using 
only two cells, the dielectric layer would be replaced by the conductor. To avoid 
this scenario, we need to use the PEC to model the two thin plates, or else use more 
than two cells inside the dielectric. However, if we increase the number of cells

inside the dielectric, this will not only degrade the efficiency of the simulation, but 
will require more memory as well.

4.2  BASIC SIMULATION PROCEDURE 
We should follow the procedure below in the FDTD simulations [3, 4] to achieve a 
good result for the practical problem solving.  
 
1. Specify a project unit. The project unit is determined by the problem size. 
For example, if the geometry dimensions are measured in millimeters, 
millimeter is a proper unit. In any case, we should avoid using a number 
like 0.000001 to describe a dimension that may introduce an 
approximation error into the problem geometry. Most commercial EM 
software tools require specifying the project unit before generating a new 
project. 
2. Draw the project model, or, import the CAD model into the EM solver. If 
the problem geometry has been in the CAD file, we can import it into the 
EM software directly. Otherwise, you need to draw it in the EM software. 
When importing a CAD file, we should check the file format and the 
version number of the modeling software built in the EM software.  
3. Specify the material and assign a proper name and color to each object. 
Material information is usually provided by the users according to the 
actual project. Most CAD files do not contain the material information. In 
the CAD file, the parts with different types of materials cannot be united 
as a single object since we need to assign them the different materials in 
the EM software.    
4. Draw and specify the excitations and outputs. Most EM software requires 
drawing an object in the domain first and then assigning a property 
(excitation or output). For example, we can draw a line and then assign a 
line as a lumped port, wave port, field output and voltage excitation, or 
output.   
5. Specify the excitation pulse. For an open port, the pure Gaussian pulse 
will introduce the DC component into the time-domain signal, and in turn

it may introduce the error into the frequency-domain results. In any case, 
we cannot use the pure Gaussian pulse in the plane wave source, mode 
excitation such as TEM, TE, and TM modes, and aperture field excitation.   
6. Specify the domain size and boundary condition. In some EM software 
packages, the domain size is an option for the users, and it can be adjusted 
in some special applications. For example, the users are allowed to 
specify the unit size in the periodic structures. Generally speaking, the 
simulation of the finite or infinite structure is controlled by the white 
space between the structure and absorbing boundary. Any structure 
touched by the absorbing boundary will be extended to the infinity, 
namely, the edge effect will be ignored.   
7. Design mesh distribution. Although the FDTD method allows us to use 
cell size as large as one tenth of the wavelength corresponding to the 
highest frequency of interest, in fact, the cell size is determined by the 
dimension of the fine structure in the practical problem. It is a safe rule to 
use two cells in the fine structure. The larger ratio between the adjacent 
cells may introduce the error into the result; however, we need to balance 
the accuracy, simulation time, and memory usage.  
8. Specify the parallel setting for the cluster simulation. For the parallel 
processing solver, we can split the domain into small pieces equal to the 
number of available cores in the cluster. The different distribution of the 
subdomains may affect the simulation performance.  
9. Generate simulation project file and specify the convergence criterion. 
We need to tell the EM solver when the simulation is terminated, for 
example, based on the convergent criterion or the width of the time 
window. 
10. Submit the job to cluster for simulation. Submit the project to the cluster 
for simulation for the parallel processing. 
11. Open the display window to visualize the simulation results. Visualize the 
simulation results in the display window, or export the results to the text 
file to do the data postprocessing in other software. 
4.3  DIPOLE ANTENNA   
The dipole [4] is one of the simplest antennas, which is often used as the test case 
to check the accuracy electromagnetic software. In this section, we use the FDTD 
code to simulate the dipole antenna and describe the most important considerations 
for the simulation. The length of dipole is 100 mm with a small gap (1 mm) at the 
center, and the size of rectangular cross section is 1 mm × 1 mm, as shown in 
Figure 4.6. The dipole is located in free space, and there is no interference with any 
other objects. Therefore, the absorbing boundary should be applied to truncate the 
computational domain. The absorbing boundary in the FDTD simulation just 
functions as the absorbing wall in the microwave chamber, which is used to erase 
the reflection from the environment. Today, the most popular absorbing boundary 

52                                            Advanced FDTD Methods 
is the PML that includes several artificial material layers and it perfectly matches 
to the free space for all the frequencies and at all incident angles.  
In this case, the absorbing boundary is used to truncate all six walls around the 
dipole. The dipole is a finite size, and hence, the absorbing boundary cannot touch 
the dipole; namely, we need a white space between the absorbing boundary and the 
dipole. The smaller the white space used and the less memory required, the faster 
the simulation is. If the absorbing boundary is too close to the dipole, some 
nonphysical reflection may be caused by the absorbing boundary, and, in turn, the 
simulation result may be inaccurate. The popular absorbing boundary, PML, 
requires the number of layers to be six.

You can also put an absolute distance between the dipole and the absorbing 
boundary as the white space. However, the number of cells inside white space will 
vary with the local cell size. It is not a good choice for the practical applications

since we need to know the number of cells to estimate the accuracy, simulation 
time, and memory usage.  
Since the shape of the dipole is a long cylinder, the computational domain will 
have a similar shape if we use the same size of white space around the dipole. For 
an irregular domain (the size in one direction is much larger than the other two), 
the simulation is stable but may not be accurate, especially for the far-field results. 
The reason is that the nonphysical reflection from the absorbing boundary is 
involved in the electric and magnetic currents on the surface of Huygens’ box.   
The excitation of a dipole antenna can be a simple voltage located in the small 
feed gap that points from the top of the lower arm to the bottom of the upper arm. 
In order to speed up the convergence, we need to place a lumped element (say, the 
resistance is 50 ohms) along the excitation path. We select the resistance to be 50 
ohms because the return loss will be normalized to 50 ohms.  
The output parameters in this example is the return loss, impedance, and far- 
field pattern. Both return loss and impedance are in a specified frequency range 
(say, from 1 to 5 GHz), however, the far-field patterns are generated only at the 
frequencies of interest. It is worthwhile to mention that the number of far-field 
patterns will significantly affect the performance of the FDTD simulation. Usually, 
we only generate the far-field patterns at the necessary frequencies. Unlike the far- 
field pattern, the return loss and impedance are near field parameters, which are 
calculated from the port voltage and current in the time domain through discrete 
Fourier transform, and, hence, their output bandwidth does not increase the 
simulation burden.    
  Mesh distribution plays an important role in the FDTD simulation, and will 
decide the result accuracy and simulation performance. In this example, the fine 
structure is the cross section of the dipole. The thickness of the dipole is not critical 
if it is relatively small compared to its length. Though one cell is sufficient for the 
accurate result, we like to use two cells here since the excitation can easily be set to 
be symmetric. The mesh distribution in the vertical direction is independent, which 
can be uniform or nonuniform, however, the ratio of cell size must be in the 
vertical and horizontal directions smaller than 20 to get a good simulation result. 
The nonuniform mesh in the vertical direction may slightly influence the 
simulation result; however, it will be acceptable in most cases. The number of cells 
in the vertical direction inside the feed gap is between two and four. The feed gap 
of dipole cannot be too large; otherwise, the higher mode in the port voltage and 
current will introduce error into the return loss and impedance. If possible, we 
usually select the size of the feed gap in the vertical direction to be two cells 
regardless of the cell size.  
Generally speaking, the simulation result is independent from the type of 
excitation pulse. However, it may affect the convergence and the accuracy as well. 
Pure Gaussian pulse has the largest DC component in its spectrum. However, if 
there is no resistance used in the excitation source, the pure charges left on the two 
dipole arms that are caused by the pure Gaussian pulse will introduce the DC 
component into the time signature in both the port voltage and current. This DC 
component will not allow us to directly use the DFT or FFT to generate the correct 

54                                            Advanced FDTD Methods 
return loss and impedance. For the same reason, the far field is not accurate either. 
If a resistance is used along the excitation voltage, either a pure Gaussian or a 
differential Gaussian pulse will generate the accurate result. One of the best 
choices to select the 3-dB beamwidth in both the pure and differential Gaussian 
pulses is equal to the highest frequency of interest (say, 6 GHz). The return loss 
and impedance of the dipole antenna are plotted in Figures 4.7 and 4.8. The 2-D 
directivity pattern and 3-D far-field pattern are plotted in Figures 4.9 and 4.10.

4.4  VIVALDI ANTENNA SIMULATION 
A Vivaldi antenna [5] is shown in Figure 4.11, which is often used as a test case to 
validate the EM software. The antenna includes three pieces of Vivaldi-shaped 
metals and two layers of dielectrics. Due to the complex shape, this type of antenna 
is usually designed in the modeling software and imported into the EM simulation 
software. Before importing it into the EM simulation software, we need to know if 
the file format matches to the required format. If not, we can use other software to 
convert the format to the required one. In addition, the pieces with the different

materials should not be united in the original CAD file; otherwise, we cannot 
specify the material to different structures. If the model is correctly imported into 
the EM software, we assign the proper material and color to each structure.   
 
Figure 4.11    Configuration of the Vivaldi antenna and the feed structure. 
 
The first thing we need to do in the simulation is to find a way to excite the 
Vivaldi antenna. Since the model does not have a feed structure, we must add one 
for it. It appears that there are an inner conductor and an outer conductor at the 
feed port; and we can extend the inner conductor, dielectric, and outer conductor to 
a proper length, as shown in Figure 4.12. The extend length is usually 10 to 20 
cells to get accurate results. We should have an idea about the cell size when we 
extend the length of the feed structure. For example, it is equal to 10 times the 
width of the inner conductor if the cell size is about half the width of the inner 
conductor.   
 
 
Figure 4.12    Extended feed structure of the Vivaldi antenna. 
 
Next, we will describe the simulation procedure to generate a good result. The 
output parameters in the problem are the return loss and far-field pattern. 
Therefore, the antenna structure including the feed structure must be finite to apply 
a closed Huygens’ surface to calculate the far-field pattern.

For the antenna problem, the metal pieces can be either the perfect electric 
conductor (PEC) or good conductor (say, copper). If the metal structure has no 
thickness, it can be only assigned to be PEC since the actual structure should have 
a finite thickness. If the metal structure has a finite thickness, it can be assigned to 
be either the good conductor or PEC.   
For a finite structure problem, absorbing boundary is applied to truncate the 
six walls of the computational domain. The white space between the antenna and 
absorbing boundary is equal to six cells. The domain size in the vertical direction is 
much smaller than those in the horizontal directions, which is also an irregular 
domain and may result in an unstable solution. In case the solution is unstable, we 
need to increase the size of the white space in the vertical direction to get a stable 
solution. 
Generally speaking, we use two to three cells in the substrate and superstrate 
and two cells across the feed line (inner conductor). However, the nonuniform 
mesh should capture the key points to describe the field variation around these 
points. 
We need to terminate the end of the feed structure using the match load inside 
the domain since any structures of the antenna must be enclosed inside the 
Huygens’ surface. The PML is one of the best candidates to terminate the feed 
structure without nonphysical reflection. However, we need to use the PML to 
create a virtual boundary that serves as the match load to terminate the excitation 
port inside the domain. The virtual boundary connects to the main domain though a 
field distribution on the excitation port.  
Since this feed structure whose cross section is a rectangular coax supports the 
TEM mode, we can extract the mode pattern supported by the coax through the 
numerical approach, as shown in Figures 4.13 and 4.14. The patterns will be 
applied to excite the Vivaldi antenna.

58                                            Advanced FDTD Methods 
The FDTD simulation is to extract the system properties, which is not related 
to the excitation pulse. However, the excitation pulse will affect the simulation 
convergence and accuracy as well. Since the match load in this example is realized 
by the PML layers, which is unlike the internal resistance of the excitation source, 
the pure Gaussian pulse will introduce the DC component into the time signature in 
the time-domain results. In turn, it will cause the truncation error in either DFT or 
FFT. Therefore, in this example, we should use the differential Gaussian pulse and 
the 3-dB beamwidth frequency is taken to be 10 GHz, which is equal to the highest 
frequency of interest.    
The return loss is also for the TEM mode from 1 GHz to 10 GHz. We need to 
measure the field distribution on the cross section of the feed coax, which should 
be two cells from the excitation source. To calculate the return loss, we need to 
extract the mode voltage and current from the measured field distribution to the 
extracted TEM mode pattern. The return loss is calculated by using the mode 
voltage and current. The bandwidth of the return loss will not increase the burden 
on the computer. However, the accuracy at the higher frequencies is determined by 
the maximum cell size. For example, the maximum cell size should be smaller than 
λ/10 of the highest frequency of interest to get an accurate result. The minimum 
cell determined by the fine structures in the problem geometry will affect the size 
of the time step in the simulation; in turn, it will significantly degrade the 
simulation performance and increase the simulation time. Therefore, in the 
practical applications, we first find the minimum structure of interest and then 
select the minimum cell size to be one-half the dimension of the fine structure. The 
return loss of the Vivaldi antenna is plotted in Figure 4.15, which demonstrates the 
wideband property.

  To calculate the far-field pattern, we need to define a closed surface, 
Huygens’ surface, and to calculate the electric and magnetic current distribution on 
it. The far-field pattern will be calculated by using the equivalent electric and 
magnetic currents. During the calculation of the equivalent currents, the spatial and 
time-domain downsampling techniques will be applied to reduce the simulation 
time and memory requirement. For example, the size of the time step in the FDTD 
simulation is much smaller than the time step for the DFT from the time-domain 
currents to the frequency-domain currents. Therefore, we can take the DFT on the 
much coarser time interval than the FDTD time step. Similarly, we do not need to 
sample the electric and magnetic currents on the Huygens’ surface on the FDTD 
grids because the near-to-far-field transformation requires much coarser grid than 
it. Using the downsampling techniques above, we can dramatically reduce the time 
on the near-to-far-field transformation for the large antenna problems.  
The far-field patterns at 6 GHz in the X0Z and Y0Z planes are plotted in 
Figure 4.16. The symmetric feature along the z-direction is obvious in both planes 
from Figure 4.16.  The far-field patterns at 6 GHz in the X0Y plane is plotted in 
Figure 4.17, which is not symmetric due to the asymmetric Vivaldi structure.

4.5   BANDED MICROWAVE CONNECTOR 
Connectors are the most frequently used microwave components in the various 
microwave devices [6]. In this part, we introduce the simulation techniques for a 
microwave connector (see Figure 4.18) using the FDTD method.

For the complex structure problems, the model is in the CAD file and is 
usually created from the other commercial modeling software. We need to import 
it into the EM simulation software and assign the material and color to each piece. 
We follow common sense to go through the simulation procedure next.  
In this example, the output parameters of interest are the time-domain 
reflectometry (TDR) and the field distribution inside the connector. For the TDR 
calculation, the excitation pulse must be a narrow pure Gaussian. The width of the 
pure Gaussian pulse should be narrow enough that it allows us to separate the 
incident pulse from the reflected signature measured at the excitation port.   
This is not an open space problem since we are only interested in the TDR and 
the field distribution inside the connector. The size of the computational domain 
equals the range occupied by the connector. We use the absorbing boundary to 
terminate the two open ports to extend them to infinity, and the other four walls 
can be terminated by using the PEC that is the simplest boundary. The white space 
is zero; namely, both absorbing and PEC boundaries should touch the connector.  
To generate the mesh distribution, we need to check the size of fine structures 
of interest in the structure; for example, the dimensions of fine structures marked 
in Figure 4.19(a) are 0.1 mm, and hence, the minimum cell size is selected to be 
0.05 mm. The local mesh distribution is shown in Figure 4.19(b), and the key 
points of the fine structure are on the FDTD grids. For the TDR calculation, we do 
not have to wait until the measured signal converges, but we can stop the 
simulation when the Gaussian pulse completely passes the connector, as shown in 
Figure 4.20.

Figure 4.20    Time signature measured at the excitation port of the microwave connector. The incident 
pulse should be separated from the reflected signal for the TDR calculation.   
 
Supposing that the top port serves the excitation port, we need to extract the 
mode supported by the cross section. We can generate the mode pattern, TEM 
mode, supported by the coaxial structure by the analytic approach. However, if the 
shape of the inner or outer conductors is not perfectly circular, the error will be 
introduced into the simulation. Therefore, we can use the numerical method to 
extract the mode pattern if we know the material distribution in the cross section. 
The mode pattern (TEM) [1] is shown in Figure 4.21.

define two rectangles inside the connector and specify the field components we 
would like to output, as shown in Figure 4.23. Since the output file will be large if 
the rectangles are large, we limit the output region inside the connector. The field 
distribution at the specified time is shown in Figure 4.24.

4.6  PARALLEL LINES  
This is a simple model that is taken from the real chip model [2], as shown in 
Figure 4.25. Two parallel lines are embedded inside four layers of anisotropic 
media, as shown in Figure 4.26.  The medium has the different permittivity in the 
vertical direction from that in the horizontal directions.  
The four layers of dielectric are finite and backed by a thin metal ground. If 
the PEC ground has no thickness, we should draw the dielectric layers first and 
then the PEC ground; otherwise, the PEC ground will be erased by the touched 
dielectric layers.  
The structure is finite and the problem is an open problem. The absorbing 
boundary is used to truncate the six walls. The size of the white space is six cells 
around the structure.

The parallel lines include the slanted surfaces, and it is impossible for us to 
use FDTD grids to capture all the edges with using the extremely small cells. In 
this example, the bottoms of the parallel lines are important since the distance of 
bottoms will affect the coupling between two parallel lines. There are two 
important factors to generate the mesh distribution: (1) there are at least two cells 
between the parallel lines, and (2) the FDTD grids should capture the bottom 
corner of the parallel lines. The proper mesh distribution around the parallel lines 
is shown in Figure 4.27.

To calculate the S-parameters, we need to terminate the four ports using the 
match loads at the ends of the parallel lines. The match load can be a surface 
whose width and height should be the bottom width of the signal line and the 
height from the ground to the signal line, respectively. Also, we can simply use a 
line from the ground to the signal line and assign it to a resistance (say, 50 ohms), 
as shown in Figure 4.28.

One of the ports is excited with the pure Gaussian pulse or differential 
Gaussian pulse. The port voltage is measured at the same location as the excitation. 
The current is calculated from the magnetic field loop around the excitation source 
and measured at the middle of the ground and signal line. Using the same method, 
we can define the output port voltages and currents at three output ports. The  
S-parameters are plotted in Figure 4.29.

4.7  TWO-PORT ANTENNA 
This antenna includes two ports [personal communication with Niels Schutten, 
2009], as shown in Figure 4.30. The thin PECs are located at both sides of the 
dielectric slab. The dielectric slab has the finite size, and two ports are located at 
one side of the dielectric slab.   
 
 
Figure 4.30    Configuration of the two-port antenna and the port definition. 
 
If the distance between the ports is far away and there is no other structure 
closed to the port, we can define a mode port, as shown in Figure 4.31. The height 
of the mode port is about four times larger than the thickness of the dielectric slab, 
and its width is in a proper value; for example, three to four times the width of the 
signal line.

The domain size in the vertical direction is much larger than the thickness of 
the dielectric slab. The result is usually better than that by using the voltage 
excitation. If we use the frequency-domain method such as the finite-difference 
frequency-domain (FDFD) method that is based on the same mesh, we should 
extract the mode pattern after the mesh generation to avoid the spatial 
interpolation. The boundary in the FDFD method in this case is the absorbing 
boundary. The mode pattern is shown in Figure 4.32.

layer, microstrip line, and ground plane in the mode pattern. 
 
Since there are two ports in this antenna, to calculate the S-parameters, we 
need to run the FDTD code twice by switching the excitation and output ports. We 
can run it one time and switch the port internally; specifically, we can generate the 
mesh and material distributions one time. The S-parameters are plotted in Figure 
4.33.

Though most structures in this antenna are in a rectangular shape, we show 
you how to generate the mesh for the good results. The fine structure in the 
antenna is marked in Figure 4.34. We need to use two cells in the fine gap. In the 
FDTD mesh generation, we need to pay the special attention to the small gap 
formed by the PEC objects, especially formed by the thin PEC objects. Any 
approximation in the gap will short two PEC objects and the results will be 
incorrect.

variation inside the fine structure. 
4.8    SLOT COUPLING  
Two slots are cut on an infinitely large PEC sheet, as shown in Figure 4.35. The 
geometry of this example is provided by Professor Junho Yeo of Daegu University, 
Korea. In this example, the plane wave illumines on the slots and we need to 
calculate the transmitted power through the slots. If the PEC sheet is finite, this 
problem is relatively easy. However, it is difficult to apply the plane wave source 
on the infinitely large object since it is in conflict with the definition of the plane 
wave. We can use the Gaussian beam inside the PML to reduce the truncation error 
of the plane wave source.

However, this problem can be solved by solving its dual problem, namely, 
switch the PEC and slot part, as shown in Figure 4.36. We need to switch the 
excitation polarization of electric and magnetic fields. If the PEC sheet has a finite 
thickness, we cannot use the dual method any more. 
 
 
 
Figure 4.36    Dual problem of the slot array that is solved by using the MoM method. Its solution is 
the same as the original problem. 
 
The PEC sheet extends to infinity in the horizontal directions. The absorbing 
boundary is used to truncate the PEC sheet without the white space (the domain 
size is four to five times larger than the slot dimension) between the PEC sheet and 
absorbing boundary. In this way, the absorbing boundary will extend the PEC 
sheet to infinity. The vertical direction of domain is also truncated by using the 
absorbing boundary and a proper size of white space is applied (say, 20 cells).  
 The fine structure is the small gap inside the slot. Following the general rule, 
there must be two cells inside the small gap to get a good result. However, in this 
problem, the coupling is relatively low and the accuracy of field inside the small 
gap is critical. The numerical experiments have demonstrated that we need at least 
four cells in the small gap to get accurate results, as shown in Figure 4.37.

The plane wave source located between the top boundary and slot is incident 
from the z-direction with the Ex polarization, as shown in Figure 4.38.

structure.  
 
The output is the transmitted power through the slots when the plane wave is 
incident in the normal direction. A box without the top surface below the PEC 
sheet captures the transmitted power [2]. The variation of transmitted power with 
the distance (11 mm, 20 mm, and 29 mm) of the slots is plotted in Figure 4.39 
together with those obtained by using the MoM code. The excellent agreement 
between the FDTD and MoM is evident from Figure 4.39.

Due to the symmetric structure, we may only need to simulate one quarter of 
the structure using the PEC boundary in the minimum x-direction and the PMC 
boundary in the minimum y-direction. We can also use an alternative way to 
validate the FDTD simulation results. For example, we change the shape of slot to 
be a square with 4-mm side length, as shown in the inset of Figure 4.40. For the 
same plane wave source and polarization, the variation of the transmitted power 
with the frequencies is plotted in Figure 4.40. As we can see from Figure 4.40, the 
transmitted power obtained by using the FDTD method approaches 1.6 mW when 
the frequency increases, which is exactly what we expect.     
 
 
 
Figure 4.40    Transmitted power through a square slot using the FDTD method, which should 
approach 1.6 when the frequency increases. 
 
It is worthwhile to mention that the excitation pulse in the plane wave source 
case cannot be the pure Gaussian pulse; otherwise, the DC component will 
introduce the error into the simulation results. Once again, the 3-dB beamwidth 
frequency of the differential Gaussian pulse is 10 GHz, which is the highest 
frequency of interest. 
4.9    MICROWAVE FILTER  
This example is a microwave filter [6], as shown in Figure 4.41. The feed 
waveguide is not a regular rectangle. The model is in the STEPS file format and 
can be imported into the FDTD code. In some cases, the problem modeling is even 
more difficult than the simulation. For example, this model is a solid in its original 
format. To generate a hollow waveguide, we select all the surfaces of the model 
and duplicate the surfaces and then delete the original model. The actual 
waveguide model does not include the two end surfaces, and hence, we deselect 
the two end surfaces, and assign the PEC material to the waveguide. The two end 
surfaces are directly defined as the input and output ports.

This is not an open space problem and the two ports are extended to infinity in 
the propagation direction. We use the absorbing boundary to truncate the two ports 
and the PEC boundary to truncate the other four walls. Since the waveguide wall 
has no thickness, any reasonable cell size can generate a closed waveguide surface. 
If the waveguide wall has a finite thickness, we have to select the cell size to be 
smaller than the half dimension of waveguide thickness to ensure the waveguide 
not leaking.

We select the two end surfaces and use the PEC boundary to truncate the 2-D 
domain in the FDFD method. The first mode is the transverse electric (TE) mode, 
as shown in Figures 4.42 and 4.43 whose cutoff frequency is 2.37 GHz. The 
reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted in Figure 4.44.

For a high Q system, the solution converges relatively slowly. Once again, the

the highest frequency of interest. 
4.10   OPTIMIZATION AND PARAMETER SCAN 
This example is a patch antenna array [7], as shown in Figure 4.45. The substrate 
and ground plane are finite in the horizontal directions. The four patches sit on the 
top surface of the substrate. There is a free space gap between the substrate and the 
ground PEC plane. In this example, the output parameters are the return loss and 
far-field pattern, and their variation with the height of free space gap. The antenna 
is fed by a coaxial cable in the original design, as shown in Figure 4.46.

Figure 4.46    Antenna array fed by a coaxial cable used in the experiment. 
 
If we directly simulate the antenna with the coaxial cable, the cell size will be 
small and the simulation time will be much longer. Hence, we replace the coaxial 
cable with a simplified probe, as shown in Figure 4.47. A large number of 
numerical experiments have demonstrated that the simplified model can generate 
the very good results for both the return loss and far-field pattern. Using the 
simplified probe model, the simulation is much faster with the much lower 
memory requirement.   
 
 
 
Figure 4.47    Antenna array fed by the simplified probe to avoid meshing the coaxial cable. 
 
If we properly select the thickness of probe and feed gap between the probe 
and ground, as shown in Figure 4.48, the simulation results will be accurate using 
lesser computer resources. The best choice is that the cross section of probe is 2×2 
cells and two to four cells are between the probe and ground, as shown in Figure 
4.49. In this example, we need to investigate variation of the output parameters 
with the distance change between the dielectric and ground. The probe length and 
ground position will vary accordingly but the feed gap remains the same in each 
case.

We like to vary the mesh and material distributions only in the region where 
the structures vary in each simulation. Mesh and material distributions in the rest 
area remain the same in each simulation. It is the partial reason why the cells inside 
the variation region must match to those in its neighboring regions.  
To investigate the variation of the output parameters with the specified 
dimensions, we usually define a parametric variable (say, H) by which the mesh 
and material vary each time, as shown in Figure 4.50.

The 3-D far-field pattern at 2.3 GHz is plotted in Figure 4.52 together with the 
problem model. The S-parameters at different sizes of the free space gap are 
plotted in Figure 4.53. Though we do not show the measurement data here, the 
simulation results match very well with the measurement data.

4.11    PERIODIC STRUCTURE SIMULATION 
A periodic structure [8, 9] has a configuration shown in Figure 4.54. Its element 
includes four layers of dielectrics and two open rings, as shown in Figure 4.55. The 
dimension of the open ring is indicated in Figure 4.56. The distance between two 
open rings is 0.5 mm, as shown in Figure 4.57. We need to calculate the reflection 
and transmission coefficients when a plane wave illumines from the z-direction 
with Ey polarization, as shown in Figure 4.58.

Figure 4.58    Relative position of the reference planes of the plane wave, reflection and transmission 
measurements. 
 
Since the periodic structure is in the x- and y-directions, we only need to 
simulate one element in the X-Y plane and the PBC (periodic boundary) is applied 
to truncate the four directions in the X-Y plane. The domain size should be equal 
to the element size, and there is no white space in the four directions in the X-Y 
plane. The absorbing boundary is applied to truncate the two vertical directions 
(say, along the z-direction). There are six cells between the absorbing boundary 
and the periodic structure. The plane wave reference is located between the 
absorbing boundary and the periodic structure. The reflection coefficient reference 
plane is located above the plane wave reference plane, and the transmission 
coefficient reference plane is located below the periodic structure.   
In this example, the width of the ring is 1.27 mm. Following the general rule, 
we select the cell size to be 0.0635 mm, namely, two cells across the ring width. 
The resonant frequency occurs about 10.2 GHz. When the cell size decreases to 
0.05 mm, the resonant frequency moves to 10.5 GHz. However, when the cell size 
decreases to 0.025 mm (see Figure 4.59), the resonant frequency is 11 GHz, as 
shown in Figure 4.60. However, when further decreasing the cell size, the resonant 
frequency does not change any more.

4.12    GROUND PENETRATING RADAR MODEL 
A ground penetrating radar (GPR) [10−12] model is shown in Figure 4.61. A pair 
of antennas are used as the transmitter and receiver, respectively. The bow-tie 
antenna is installed inside the PEC box without the bottom surface. The four 
corners of the bow-tie antenna connect to the PEC box through four 200 resistor-
ohms, as shown in Figure 4.62.

Figure 4.62    Wideband bow-tie antennas that are mounted inside the PEC box. 
 
The ground soil is extended to infinity in the horizontal directions and in the  
–z-direction as well. The absorbing boundary is applied to truncate the x-, y-, and  
–z-directions and there is no white space between the absorbing boundary and 
ground soil in the x-, y-, and –z-directions. The absorbing boundary is used to 
truncate the z-direction and the white space with six cells in between the absorbing 
boundary and bow-tie antenna. This example is different from other examples in 
this chapter because the soil is a dispersive medium, as shown in Figure 4.63. 
Therefore, the absorbing boundary is able to handle the dispersive medium. In this 
example, we need to extract the reflected signal by the buried pipe that includes the 
plastic shell and fill-in water, as shown in Figure 4.63.

the plastic pipe. 
 
The length and thickness of the feed structure between two elements of the 
bow-tie antenna are not important for this problem; however, their selections will 
affect the simulation time and memory usage. To be smart, we select the thickness 
of the feed structure to be rectangular and its cross section to be 2×2 cells 
regardless of the cell size.   
To generate the field distribution on a specified plane, we need to draw a 
surface on which we like to generate the field, as shown in Figure 4.64. For this 
example, the interesting output is the scattered field from the buried pipe. To this 
end, we need to simulate the problem two times; in the first time, we remove the 
buried pipe from the domain and measure the time-domain signal at the receiver. 
In the second simulation, we simulate the original problem and measure the time- 
domain signal at the receiver. The subtract of the two signals is the scattered signal 
from the buried pipe, as shown in Figure 4.65.

4.13  MICROWAVE CONNECTOR 
We finally apply the parallel conformal FDTD to simulate a microwave connector 
[6], as shown in Figure 4.66(a). The connector includes a cylindrical dielectric 
structure with six small holes. The coaxial feed is excited by using a TEM mode, 
as shown in Figure 4.66(b). This is a transformation structure, and the two ports are 
extended to infinity. We apply the absorbing boundary to truncate the two ports 
without any white space between the connector and absorbing boundary. The PEC 
boundary is used to truncate the other four walls of the computational domain 
without any white space.

We notice that the connector has fine features (0.329 mm) between the small 
holes and the inner conductor. A small gap in the model, 0.01095 mm, is located 
between the inner conductor and the filled dielectric, which does not affect the 
result. We also notice that the geometry with the minimum dimension is not 
parallel to either the x- or y-axis, and we can obtain accurate results if we use a 
minimum cell size in the range of 0.1 mm to 0.1645 mm in the x- and y-directions. 
Since there is a small gap (0.2 mm) in the z-direction, we use 0.2 mm as the 
minimum cell size in that direction, as shown in Figure 4.67. 
 
 
 
Figure 4.67    Local mesh distribution to describe the fine structures. 
If the output parameters include the TDR or time impedance, we must use the 
narrow pure Gaussian pulse as the excitation pulse to ensure no overlapping of the 
incident pulse and reflected signal.  
If we are only interested in the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and time-
domain impedance of a connector, we can stop the simulation when the excitation 
pulse goes through the connector. However, to get the accurate frequency 
response, we need to wait until the simulation is convergent. 
The inner conductor of the connector is gold, whereas the outer conductor is 
PEC. The reflection coefficient for this conductor is computed using the FDTD 
code and the results are plotted in Figure 4.68. Even when we run the simulation 
up to a frequency of 50 GHz, we find that the return loss is lower than −27 dB over 
the entire frequency range.  
The incident pulse we have chosen is a pure Gaussian pulse with a 3-dB 
beamwidth frequency of 65 GHz, which corresponds to a rise time of 0.538 ps 
(=0.35/65e9), and a time-step resolution of 0.27 ps. The TDR [13, 14] response is 
simulated by using the time-domain signal, and the result is shown in Figure 4.69. 
The time-domain impedance, computed by using the reflected and incident signals, 
is shown in Figure 4.70.

Figure 4.68    Reflection coefficient of the microwave connector when one side is excited. 
 
There are different ways that we can calculate the TDR response. One 
possibility is to use a narrow Gaussian pulse as the incident wave, measure the 
total time-domain signal at the excitation port, and then separate the incident and 
reflected signals from the total time-domain signal. The TDR response can then be 
calculated by using the incident and reflected time-domain signals. If we use this 
method, we do not have to wait until the signal converges to derive the TDR 
response. The TDR can also be calculated by using the frequency-domain 
reflection coefficient via Fourier transformation.

EM Simulation Software Benchmarks 
 
 
In this chapter, we use four of the most popular commercial software packages to 
simulate some typical problems; all can be simulated using a regular PC installed 
with 2-GB memory. In order to present a complete simulation idea, we analyze and 
discuss the most important steps for each example based on our best knowledge. 
We give GEMS simulation more detailed explanation because we are familiar with 
GEMS. To be fair to other software packages, note that they do not use any 
hardware acceleration including the GPU and VALU.    
5.1  BASIC STEPS IN EM SIMULATION 
In this section, we introduce the basic steps the users should follow when they use 
the popular commercial software packages for EM problem solving. The procedure 
summarized here may not be optimized, and hence it is only used to demonstrate 
the project design and procedure in different software packages. Once again, the 
interpolation for each software package is based on our best knowledge; please 
refer to the manufacturer’s manual or Web site for any further questions and 
detailed information. Next, we explain the main features in each software package. 
5.1.1  HFSS 
High Frequency Simulation Solver (HFSS) [1] (http://www.ansoft.com) is 
developed based on the finite element method (FEM). The basic simulation steps 
are described as follows: 
 
1. Select a project unit. 
2. Generate the project model or import the project model through the CAD 
files, and then specify the material type to each part. 
3. Specify the boundary condition.  
4. Generate port objects, and then assign the port property. 
5. Provide the frequency band of interest and frequency step size. 
6. Validate project to check the project settings. 
7. Simulate the project. 
8. Process and generate results.  

90                                            Advanced FDTD Methods 
The main features include:  
 
1. Three-dimensional modeling is developed based on ACIS that supports 
the most popular CAD file formats. 
2. Parametric design and optimization. 
3. Adaptive mesh generation. 
5.1.2  CST 
Computer Simulation Tool (CST) [2] (http://www.cst.com) was developed based 
on the finite integration technique (FIT). The basic simulation steps are described 
as follows: 
 
1. Select a project unit. 
2. Select the background properties. 
3. Generate the project model or import the project model through the CAD 
files, and then specify the material type to each part.

distribution and see if the fine structures are properly captured.  
9. Select solver and specify the convergence criterion. 
10. Simulate the project. 
11. View the simulation results.  
 
The main features include:  
 
1. Three-dimensional modeling is developed based on ACIS. 
2. Parametric design and optimization. 
3. Adaptive mesh generation. 
5.1.3  FEKO 
FEKO [3] (http://www.feko.info) was developed based on the method of moments 
(MoM). The basic simulation steps are described as follows: 
 
1. Select a project unit. 
2. Generate the project model or import the project model through the CAD 
files, and then specify the material type to each part. 
3. Create a port that cannot be located on the dielectric surface. 
4. Assign the port property. 
5. Specify the frequency band of interest.  
6. Set up the output parameters.

9. View the simulation results.  
 
The main features include:  
 
1. Three-dimensional modeling is developed based on PARASOLID. 
2. Parametric design and optimization. 
3. Adaptive mesh generation. 
5.1.4  GEMS 
GEMS [4] (http://www.2comu.com) was developed based on parallel conformal 
FDTD method, which can be used to simulate the extremely large problems using 
the computer cluster at a relatively high parallel efficiency. Since FDTD is a time- 
domain technique, we can obtain a broadband frequency response in one GEMS 
simulation. The conformal technique allows us to simulate the curved surfaces 
using a relatively large cell size. In GEMS simulation, we need to provide the 
highest frequency of interest, minimum cell size that usually equals half of the fine 
structure of interest and the ratio between adjacent cells, number of processors for 
the parallel version. The basic simulation steps are described as follows: 
 
1. Select a project unit.  
2. Create a new GEMS project. 
3. Generate the project model in GEMS interface or import the project 
model through the CAD files in the SAT, STEP, IGES, ProE, Catia, and 
DXF, and then specify the material type to each part. 
4. Set the excitation source, and output options. 
5. Specify the highest frequency. 
6. Specify the boundary condition. 
7. Provide the minimum cell sizes. 
8. Setup the output parameters for the far-field patterns. 
9. Design the processor distribution for the parallel processing. 
10. Specify the convergence criterion and check the project settings. 
11. Simulate the project on a PC through GEMS solver or on a cluster 
through GEMS WBI. 
12. Open GEMS display window to view the simulation results and derive the 
results through the GEMS data postprocessing center.   
 
The main features include:  
 
1. Three-dimensional modeling is developed based on ACIS that supports 
the most popular CAD file formats including DXF. 
2. Parametric design and optimization. 
3. Adaptive mesh generation. 
4. Support 32-bit and 64-bit Windows and Linux platforms. 
5. Support MPI and distributed computing techniques. 
6. Support IBM BlueGene platform.

7. Support Web job submission, job status checking, and result view. 
8. Provide the combination of parallel software and hardware system. 
5.2  HARDWARE PLATFORMS 
In order to be fair to the other four software packages, when we compare the 
simulation time, memory usage, and the accuracy of HFSS, CST, FEKO, and 
GEMS, all the numerical experiments are carried out on the same hardware 
platform, and its configuration is listed here: 
 
 
 
Lenovo ThinkPad T400 
CPU: Intel dual core 2.4 GHz (L2 Cache: 3 MB) 
Memory: 2 GB (PC3-850 DDR3 1067 MHz) 
Operating system: 32-bit Microsoft Windows XP 
 
 
Since the basic version of GEMS supports the multicore processor without any 
extra cost, we also use the quad core processor to give readers an idea of the 
performance of GEMS on the GEMS workstation. The configuration of the GEMS 
workstation is listed here:      
 
 
EM simulation workstation 
CPU: Intel quad core 2.4 GHz (L2 Cache: 6 MB) 
Memory: 8 GB (DDR2-667 800 MHz) 
Operating system: GEMS Linux/Windows 
 
 
 
Since the GEMS workstation is specially optimized for the GEMS simulation 
software, the excellent performance of the GEMS workstation is evident compared 
to the other software and systems. 
5.3  PATCH ANTENNA 
The patch antenna includes a rectangular patch, one-quarter match line, and a feed 
line, as shown in Figure 5.1. The dimensions of the antenna and material are 
indicated in Table 5.1.  The output parameters will be the return loss. Since the far- 
field pattern is not sensitive to the approximation in the EM simulation, we only 
compare the return loss in this example. 
Although both the ground plane and substrate are finite, this antenna is still a 
relatively simple problem. The basic parameter settings in different software 
packages and performance are summarized in Table 5.2.

Once again, all the numerical experiments are carried out based on the same 
hardware platform. During the simulation, we have noticed that the two cores of 
the dual core processor were used for the simulation in all four software packages. 
Unlike CST, HFSS and FEKO, GEMS can realize the communication between the 
compute cores through either OpenMP or MPI in a single processor. OpenMP is 
the default option in GEMS, and the operating system will organize the jobs 
between the cores automatically regardless of the number of cores in the computer. 
During the simulation, we can observe two applications of “GEMS_Solver.exe.” 
One of “GEMS_Solver.exe” uses all cores to solve the electric and magnetic fields 
and second one is used for the job management to reach a good code performance. 
In contrast, MPI option in GEMS will automatically break the whole domain into 
two pieces of subdomains for a dual core processor and four pieces of subdomains 
for a quad core processor, and each core only simulates its own subdomain. Except 
for the simple geometry problems, the MPI option will significantly improve the 
simulation performance. When we use the MPI option, during the simulation we 
will observe that the number of applications of “GEMS_Solver.exe” is equal to 3 
for the dual processor and 5 for the quad core processor. Two “GEMS_Solver.exe”

in the dual core processor are used for field solving, and one for the job 
management. Four “GEMS_Solver.exe” in the quad core processor are used for 
field solving, and one for the job management. Besides “GEMS_Solver.exe,” we 
can see one more application during GEMS simulation, “Solver.exe,” which is the 
process for the GEMS solver window. Unlike HFSS, CST, and FEKO, GEMS 
does not need to keep the designer open during the GEMS simulation, therefore the 
memory requirement of the GEMS designer should not be counted into the GEMS 
simulation. It is worthwhile to mention that the graphical interface of HFSS, CST, 
and FEKO may use a large amount of memory for the complex geometries.

For the same problem and number of unknowns, we use the GEMS 
workstation to simulate it, and the performance is demonstrated in Table 5.3.

GEMS can detect the number of cores in the current computer and break the 
problem domain into the same number of subdomains and then apply the MPI on it 
automatically. We can see more “GEMS_Solver.exe” applications in the Task 
Manager window. Each GEMS MPI option will require about 10 MB of memory 
excluding the memory for the field solving.  
Besides the GEMS solver engine, GEMS environment memory requirement 
totals about 25 MB, including about 11 Mb for the GEMS controller and 14 MB 
for GEMS simulation window.     
Although HFSS allows the user to close the model during the simulation, it 
does not allow the user to close the designer window. HFSS designer without 
model loading has a memory usage of about 101 MB.  
Both CST and FEKO do not allow the user to close the designer window and 
project model during the simulation. Hence, the memory usage of their designer 
depends on the problem size and complexity. For this simple case, CST designer 
and modeler require 135 MB memory, and FEKO designer requires 104 MB 
memory.  
The mesh design in FEKO strongly depends on the user’s experience. Here, to 
avoid involving the detailed mesh design, we adjust the global mesh parameters to 
reduce the number of unknowns to compare with other three software packages. 
Further reducing the number of cells will result in an inaccurate result. Since this 
structure is rather simple, we do not need to get involved in the mesh design in 
other three software packages. We adjusted the mesh in GEMS to match the 
number of cells used in CST because CST and GEMS use the similar method. The 
simulation results using different software packages are plotted in Figure 5.2. 
Though we do not show the far-field pattern here, they match very well from 
different software packages.  
It is a little difficult for us to compare the time spent on the far-field pattern 
calculation. The reason is that the far-field pattern is calculated during the 
simulation in GEMS, CST, and FEKO, but it is calculated in the data 
postprocessing in HFSS.

We have a chance to compare the performance of GPU and CPU for this 
simple case, namely, the case does not require the far-field pattern, dispersive 
medium, and 3-D field or current distributions, which will be not efficient for 
GPU. The output parameter is the return loss only. It means that the GPU only 
carries out the field update and absorbing boundary (PML). The GPU data is 
provided by Professor Atef Elsherbeni of the University of Mississippi 
(atef@olemiss.edu). The problem domain is discretized into 105,924 (97×80×14) 
cells for both GPU and CPU (GEMS) codes. The simulation information is 
summarized in Table 5.4, in which the simulation time is for 2,700 time steps.

Summary: The ground plane and substrate of the patch antenna are finite and four 
software packages can simulate it accurately. The software performance strongly 
depends on the user’s experience, and the readers should simulate it using the 
different software packages and draw their own conclusions.  
5.4  VIVALDI ANTENNA 
The Vivaldi antenna [5], as shown in Figure 5.3, is a good benchmark for the 
commercial EM simulation software packages. There are some publications on this 
topic, but these benchmarks only show the simulation result and brief summary 
without the detailed simulation procedure, therefore, the readers cannot repeat the 
results by themselves. In this part, we will present detailed simulation information 
for the different software packages. Due to the similarity of GEMS and CST, we 
first use CST to simulate the Vivaldi antenna and then use GEMS for the same 
number of cells. FEKO and HFSS are based on the frequency-domain techniques, 
so we try to use their default input parameters to simulate the Vivaldi antenna.

The dimensions of the Vivaldi antenna are indicated in Figure 5.4. We can 
simulate half of the antenna taking the benefit of the symmetric structure about the 
central element. However, if the superstrate and substrate have a different 
dielectric constant, we cannot use the symmetric property. Hence, here we simulate 
the whole structure directly. Since four software packages provide the features to 
handle the symmetric structure, therefore the simulation time will be reduced to the 
half if we simulate the half structure. Readers can generate the Vivaldi structure 
based on the information in Figure 5.4, or can find the SAT model for this Vivaldi 
antenna online.

This Vivaldi antenna has a special feed structure, as shown in Figure 5.5, so 
we need to find a way to excite the antenna in different software packages.  
 
Figure 5.5     Feed port configuration of the Vivaldi antenna.  
When we calculate the return loss or S-parameter, the excitation port must be 
terminated by a matched load. There are several ways to terminate the port of 
Vivaldi antenna: (1) extend the feed structure to a coaxial cable, (2) let the feed 
port touch the absorbing boundary, and (3) add a terminator at the feed port.   
1. Extend the feed structure to a coaxial cable, as shown in Figure 5.6. Four 
software packages provide this technique to extend the feed structure to a 
coaxial cable. However, it is a relatively complicated procedure.  
(a) Draw a block that has the same cross section as the feed port. 
(b) Select the four surfaces to form a hollow guide, or directly draw four 
surfaces that are used as the walls of guide. 
(c) Draw a dielectric block (superstrate) to extend the upper dielectric into the 
guide.

(d) Draw a dielectric block (substrate) to extend the lower dielectric into the 
guide. 
(e)  Draw a strip line to extend the strip into the guide. 
(f) Specify the guide, strip line and dielectric parameters. 
We can use the TEM mode to excite the feed guide port. In addition, the guide 
structure will increase the burden of the simulation.  
2. Let the feed port touch the absorbing boundary, as shown in Figure 5.7. We 
can let the feed port touch the absorbing boundary of the computational 
domain to extend the port structure to infinity. In this case, we do not need to 
do any extra work on the model, and directly let the antenna port touch the 
absorbing boundary. Then, we can use a regular wave port to excite the port to 
calculate the return loss. There is a big problem when we need to calculate the 
far-field pattern because we cannot have information in the feed side. Though 
we did not try this model, we believe both GEMS and CST have this feature.

It is a relatively easy job to add this matched load.  
(a) Draw rectangle at the feed port. 
(b) Assign it to be a matched load. 
In this feed model, we can use a regular wave port to excite the port, as shown 
in Figure 5.9. A six-layer CPML is applied to truncate all six walls of the 
computational domain in GEMS simulation.

The simulation results are summarized in Figure 5.10.  To get the matched 
result from HFSS, we tried to use different feed ports, and  different boundary 
conditions, and different sizes of the domain, however, we could not match the 
result. The results from HFSS we did get are plotted in Figure 5.11. We observed 
from Figure 5.11 that the results from different settings are consistent.  We tried to 
use FEKO to simulate this antenna; however, we could not get a result that is close 
to those from GEMS, CST, and HFSS.

Summary: Due to the special feed structure of the Vivaldi antenna, it is important 
to find a correct way to excite the Vivaldi antenna in different software packages. 
The software performance strongly depends on the user’s experience, and the 
readers should use their own methods to excite the Vivaldi antenna in the different 
software packages and draw their own conclusions.  
5.5  SCATTERING OF DIELECTRIC SPHERE 
In this section, we present one example for the 3-D radar cross section (RCS) 
calculation. A dielectric sphere (see Figure 5.13, its radius=30 mm, relative 
dielectric constant = 4) is illuminated by a plane wave along θ=0o. The output 
parameter is the bistatic RCS at the frequency = 9.368 GHz (wavelength in free 
space = 32 mm, and 16 mm in dielectric). The cell size is selected to be 0.75 mm.  
 
 
Figure 5.13    A dielectric sphere with the dielectric constant = 4. 
We picked the dielectric sphere as a benchmark because it is simple and has 
the MIE solution [6] so that we can check if the simulation result is accurate. Since 
there is no fine structure inside the computational domain, we can select the cell 
size in the time-domain method based on the highest frequency of interest. 
However, we need to take the dielectric constant 4 into account. We select the 
input parameters as follows in different software packages: 
 
HFSS: 
1. Cell sizes: ∆x=∆y=∆z=0.75 mm. 
2. Boundary: radiation boundary, one-half wavelength white space. 
3. Excitation: Plane wave source. 
4. Convergence criterion: 0.042. 

EM Simulation Software Benchmarks                               109 
 
 
5. Outputs: RCS (process in the postprocessing). 
CST: 
1. Min. mesh step: 0.71; Max. mesh step: 1.5. 
2. Boundary: Open (add space). 
3. Number of cells: 52×52×52. 
4. Excitation: Plane wave source. 
5. Convergence criterion: −40 dB. 
6. Outputs: RCS (process in the postprocessing). 
 
FEKO: 
1. Edge length = 1.5 mm, which is λ/10 inside the sphere at the 9.368 GHz. 
2. Excitation: Plane wave source. 
3. Output: RCS (direct output parameter). 
 
GEMS: 
1. Cell sizes: ∆x=∆y=∆z=0.75 mm. 
2. Boundary: 6-layer CPML. 
3. Number of cells: 52×52×52 (not include PML layers). 
4. Excitation: Plane wave source. 
5. Output: RCS (direct output parameter). 
 
The 3-D far-field pattern calculated using GEMS is plotted in Figure 5.14. 
Though we cannot compare the difference of 3-D far-field pattern, from their shape 
and level we know they are in good agreement from the different software 
packages. GEMS and CST can generate both RCS (dB) and RCS (dBsm); 
however, we cannot find a way to generate the RCS (dB) in both FEKO and HFSS 
when we do the data postprocessing.  
 The simulation results are plotted in Figures 5.15 and 5.16. We have observed 
from Figures 5.15 and 5.16 that the bistatic RCS of the dielectric sphere using 
different software is almost the same except for the HFSS results. We tried to 
change the domain size in HFSS, and though the result is improved when the 
domain gets larger, its result is still not close to that obtained by using the other 
three software packages.

HFSS does not require the users to select the mesh size for a given problem. 
We picked up the mesh size in FEKO, CST, and GEMS based on our best 
understanding. For example, in CST and GEMS, the cell size is selected to be 0.75 
mm (about 20 cells per wavelength). For the sake of comparison, we intentionally 
use the same number of cells in CST and GEMS. For the dielectric cavity problem 
the field inside the cavity attenuates very slowly. For the antenna problems, the far- 
field pattern is not sensitive to the near-field and current distribution inside the 
domain. However, in this example, −30 dB convergence criterion may not be 
sufficient to reach the convergence result in both CST and GEMS. We may need to 
decrease the criterion to achieve a good result, as shown in Figures 5.17 and 5.18.

In the frequency-domain method such as MoM and FEM, the convergence 
criterion is forced on each frequency, therefore, the simulation result will reach the 
convergent value when the convergence criterion is satisfied. In contrast, the 
convergence criterion is on a wide frequency band, the convergence criterion is a 
statistical concept. Even if the convergence criterion is reached, it does not mean 
that the result is convergent for each individual frequency. In fact, it may depend 
on the shape of the excitation pulse. 
The same thing may happen in CST, the RCS difference between a −30 dB 
and a −40 dB convergence criterion is shown in Figures 5.19 and 5.20.

Each software package will generate a simulation report that includes the 
simulation information such as simulation time, memory usage, preprocessing time, 
and computer status. It is hard to compare the resource usage for different methods. 
Here, we show the typical report of each software package. Besides the simulation 
information, GEMS also lists the computer name and available memory in the 
project report. The simulation information is summarized in Table 5.8. 
GEMS: 
The memory usage of GEMS includes the memory for GEMS solver engine, 
GEMS controller, and GEMS solver window. When GEMS is running, we 
can read the memory usage for each module from the Windows Task 
Manager. The memory usage for the GEMS solver window does not vary 
with the problem size. The memory usage for the GEMS controller may 
change a little bit with the problem options such as problem size excitation 
and output parameters. However, the memory usage for the GEMS solver 
engine strongly depends on the problem size. 
Simulation time of GEMS includes the following parts: (1) GEMS 
solver engine that includes the field update and far-field pattern calculation; 
(2) the mesh and material generations, namely, project preprocessing; and 
(3) the domain decomposition, launching MPI, and so forth. The time spent 
on this part can usually be ignored. Though we may use the GEMS PC 
version, GEMS still allows us to use the multiple cores through MPI. For 
the complex problems, GEMS performance on a multiple core processor can 
be improved significantly using MPI.   
The approach to calculate the far-field pattern is different in the 
different methods. In MoM, FEM, and FIT, the mesh is generated on the 
surface of objects; therefore, the electric and magnetic surface currents are 
located on the object surface. Once we get the surface current distributions 
inside the domain, we can calculate the far field easily. In the time-domain 
solvers, we cannot keep all the history of the surface current distribution in 
each time step, and then calculate the far-field pattern using either DFT or 
FFT. Instead, we need to take DFT at each time step to count the 
contribution of the surface current at the each time step. In contrast, GEMS 
based on the FDTD method will not calculate the surface current 
distribution on the object surface, but GEMS calculates the equivalent 
current distributions on the surface of the Huygens’ box that encloses the 
entire antenna structure. The far-field pattern is calculated from this surface 
current. We can store the frequency-domain surface current on the Huygens’ 
surface and calculate the far field in the data postprocessing, or calculate the 
far-field pattern following the FDTD update, in which the far field will have 
direct output parameters. In GEMS, both 2-D and 3-D far fields will have 
direct output parameters.

The peak memory of “Matrix calc” and “solver” in CST may not be reached at

We select −40 dB in this example, because we cannot select a number between −30 
dB and −40 dB in CST. 
For the same problem and the same number of unknowns, we use GEMS

Summary: Since the RCS of a dielectric sphere can be expressed as MIE series, 
we can compare the simulation result with the analytic solution. Once again, the 
software performance strongly depends on the user’s experience, and the readers 
should simulate it using the different software packages and draw their own 
conclusions.  
5.6  CELL PHONE ANTENNA 
In this section, we present one cell phone antenna, whose configuration [7] is 
shown in Figures 5.21 and 5.22. The antenna structure includes a PEC ground (it is 
treated as PEC since it has no thickness in the original design), dielectric (relative 
permittivity = 4.4), antenna and two feed ports. The antenna model in the SAT 
format was exported from FEKO. When this SAT model was imported to HFSS, 
HFSS showed the error message in the dielectric object, and the simulation was 
terminated. When this SAT model was imported to GEMS, GEMS returned an 
error message from an ACIS function and the simulation was terminated.  
 
 
Figure 5.21   MIMO antenna configuration with two antennas at the corners. 
Since the model is simple, we manually redrew the dielectric model. HFSS, 
CST, and GEMS can simulate and generate the correct results.  
The small bridge structure of feed strip line and the hole in Figure 5.23 are 
very inconvenient to all the software packages because it forces us to use a small 
cell size, and in turn, the time step in the time-domain method will be dramatically 
reduced. A similar problem will happen using the frequency-domain method.

Figure 5.23    Excitation port structure of the MIMO antenna, which is created in FEKO software.  
We first use GEMS to simulate this problem. In GEMS, we select the cell size 
based on the following rules: (1) find the dimension of the minimum structure of 
interest, for example, the minimum dimensions are 0.5, 0.5, and 0.1 mm in the x-, 
y- and z-directions; and (2) generally speaking, we need to put two cells in the 
minimum structure to describe the field variation inside it. In this problem, the 
dimension in the z-direction is relatively small, and we do not need to describe the 
field variation in the z-direction. Basically, we can select the cell sizes to be 0.25 
mm, 0.25 mm, and 0.1 mm, in the x-, y-, and z-directions, respectively. If the 
region except this feed structure does not contain many fine structures, we can 
select the cell size to be up to 60% of the minimum structure. For example, the cell 
sizes can be 0.3 mm and 0.3 mm in the x- and y-directions, respectively. Both the 
memory usage and simulation time will reduce by 12% when the cell sizes are 
reduced from 0.3 mm to 0.25 mm in the x- and y-directions. However, we cannot 
observe any changes in the S-parameters and far-field patterns.

In this example, we do not need to draw any objects in the EM simulation 
software since all parts have been included in the SAT model. What we need to do 
is to specify the material type for each part of SAT model, and set up the excitation 
and output parameters. The fine structure in this problem is the feed part, and no 
matter what method is selected, we should ensure the excitation path touches the 
center point of the square part of the feed structure. This problem can be simulated 
by using a single PC with 2-GB memory. In the four EM packages, we can import 
the SAT model into the graphical interface. Next, we introduce the basic procedure 
when we simulate it using four software packages. 
  
The basic steps using GEMS to simulate this antenna are given here: 
 
1. Import the SAT model into GEMS interface, and specify the material type to 
the antenna (PEC), ground plane (PEC), and substrate (relative permittivity is 
4.4). 
2. Draw two lines from the ground to the feed line at the two feed ports and then 
assign them to be the lumped ports. 
3. Specify the highest frequency = 6 GHz in the differential Gaussian pulse.  
4. Set the initial cell sizes (Δx=Δy=0.3 mm, Δz=0.1 mm, ratio=1.05) to generate 
the adaptive mesh. 
5. Specify the convergence criterion = −30 dB. 
6. Simulate the project on the laptop through GEMS solver. 
 
The basic steps using HFSS to simulate this antenna are given here: 
 
1. Import the SAT model into HFSS interface, and specify the material type to 
the antenna (PEC), ground plane (PEC), and substrate (relative permittivity is 
4.4). 
2. Draw two rectangular integration lines from the ground to the feed line at the 
two feed ports as the lumped ports. 
3. Specify the frequency band of interest from 0.5 to 6 GHz, and the frequency 
step is 0.1 GHz.  
4. Set the convergence criterion = 0.02. 
5. Simulate the project on the laptop (only one core is used for the simulation). 
6. Process the results.

1. Import the SAT model into CST interface, and specify the material type to the

120                                            Advanced FDTD Methods 
2. Draw two lines from the ground to the feed line at the two feed ports and then 
assign them to be the lumped excitation ports. 
3. If we specify the highest frequency = 6 GHz and 20 cells per wavelength, the 
mesh cannot capture the fine feed structure, and hence, the simulation result is 
not correct. To capture the fine feed structure, we need to specify the highest 
frequency = 20 GHz.  
4. Set the convergence criterion = −30 dB. 
5. Simulate the project on the laptop (two cores are used for the simulation). 
 
The basic steps using FEKO to simulate this antenna are given here: 
 
1. Import the SAT model into the FEKO interface, and specify the material type 
to the antenna (PEC), ground plane (PEC), and substrate (relative permittivity 
is 4.4). 
2. Draw two lines from the ground to the feed line at the two feed ports and then 
assign them to be the lumped ports. 
3. Specify the frequency band of interest from 0.5 to 6 GHz, and the frequency 
step is 0.1 GHz.  
4. We tried FEKO; however, we could not get the correct results. 
 
The simulation results including S11, S21, S12, and S22 are plotted in Figures 
5.24 to 5.26. We can see from Figures 5.24 and 5.25 that there is a strange 
behavior at 1.8 GHz in the CST result and strange behavior between 4.5 to 6 GHz 
in the HFSS result. Other than that, the results generated by three software 
packages are good and acceptable.

Figure 5.25    S22 of the MIMO antenna using different software packages. 
The result of CST between 1.6 to 1.9 GHz in Figure 5.25 jumps to about −6 
dB and it is not obviously physical. We tried to increase or decrease the cell size 
and the behavior remained. The S22 difference in Figure 5.25 between the different 
packages may be caused by the feed model that is treated in different ways in 
different packages.

packages. We use the method described before to record the memory usage and 
simulation time.

When the Cartesian mesh is used in CST, the finite integration technique 
becomes the FDTD method, and hence we can compare CST and GEMS in 
memory usage, simulation time, and accuracy. Here, we use this example to 
investigate the capacity of different software packages to handle the ill-conditioned 
model. The antenna model in the SAT format was exported from FEKO. When it 
is imported to HFSS, HFSS shows the error message in the substrate and the 
simulation stops. When the same model is imported to CST, CST does not show 
any error message and can simulate it, but its result is obviously wrong. When the 
same model is imported to GEMS and if the cell size is selected to be 0.1 mm in 
the x-, y-, and z-directions, the simulation stops due to the ill-conditioned dielectric 
model. However, if the cell size is selected to be other values (not 0.1 mm, 0.1 
mm, and 0.1mm) such as 0.3 mm, 0.3 mm, and 0.1 mm in the x-, y-, and z-
directions, respectively, for the same ill-conditioned SAT model, GEMS can 
simulate and generate the correct result. The simulation result is summarized in 
Figure 5.27, the HFSS result is used as a reference, and we can observe that 
besides the strange behavior in CST at low frequency (<1.3 GHz), the S11 and S22 
have a big deviation from HFSS and GEMS.  
 
 
Figure 5.27    S11 parameter of the MIMO antenna using different software packages. 
We cannot simply compare GEMS and HFSS in terms of the memory usage 
and simulation time since the methods used in the two software packages are 
different. If the number of unknowns in HFSS reduces, can we still get a good 
result? To this end, we reduce the number of unknowns in HFSS to 25,000 
tetrahedrons, and the number of cells in GESM in the similar ratio. At this point, 
the GEMS simulation time is almost the same as that used in the HFSS simulation. 
The simulation results using GEMS and HFSS are plotted in Figures 5.28 to 5.32. 
We can observe from Figures 5.28 to 5.32 that the GEMS simulation result 
does not change much when the number of cells is reduced from 2.4 to 7.4 Mcells.

However, the significant variation in the HFSS simulation result is observed when 
the number of unknowns is reduced to one-third and the HFSS result is not 
acceptable when the simulation time is reduced the level of GEMS.

Summary: The antenna geometry is not large in terms of wavelength; however, it 
is a little complex due to the fine structure inside the antenna. The software 
performance strongly depends on the user’s experience, and the readers should 
simulate it using the different software packages and draw their own conclusions.  
5.7  ELECTROMAGNETIC BANDGAP STRUCTURE 
In this section, we use the periodic boundary condition to simulate an  
electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure [8], as shown in Figure 5.33. The EBG 
structure is constructed by using the infinitely long dielectric cylinder (radius = 2 
mm and the relative dielectric constant = 4.2). The EBG is periodic in the 
transverse directions and there are six layers in the propagation direction.

Using the periodic boundary condition, we only need to simulate the six 
dielectric cylinders (one periodic element) along the propagation direction, as 
shown in Figure 5.34.  
 
 
.  
Figure 5.34    Simulation configuration of the EBG structure. 
 
The domain is truncated in the cylinder axis direction by using the periodic 
boundary condition (PBC). However, the PML should be used to truncate the 
domain in the propagation direction. Suppose the periodic boundary is used to 
truncate the domain in the transverse directions; the distance between the periodic 
boundary to the dielectric cylinder should be equal to one-half distance between 
the two adjacent cylinders. The periodic boundary should touch the cylinder 
because the cylinder is infinitely long along the cylinder axial direction. In the 
propagation direction, there should be 10 cells of white space to leave sufficient 
room to place the plane wave surface.  
Due to the periodic structure of EBG in the transverse directions, the plane 
wave box will be degenerated to be one surface, which is located at the incident 
side of EBG structure. In the GEMS simulations, the plane wave surface is always 
parallel to the X-Y plane regardless of the normal or oblique incidence.    
We just need to simulate one element of the EBG structure, and hence, the 
domain is relatively small. To be safe, we can use the uniform and fine mesh to 
reach good simulation results. In this example, the frequency band of interest is up 
to 25 GHz (the wavelength in dielectric at 25 GHz is 6 mm), and we can use the 
cell size equal to 0.25 mm (about 24 cells per wavelength).  
The outputs in the EBG structure simulation are the time-domain reflected and 
transmitted fields in GEMS. The time-domain reflected field of the higher-order 
Floquet modes includes the real and imaginary parts; however, the transmitted 
field of the main modes only has the real part, and the reflected and transmitted 
fields of main mode have a zero imaginary part.  
The simulation information is summarized in Table 5.12. We tried to use the

the result tree after the simulation was completed. We use the “Unit Cell” and 
frequency-domain solver to simulate the EBG structure.

In HFSS, we tried to use the different options for the periodic structure 
simulation, however there is no option to calculate the reflection and transmission 
coefficients for the periodic structure (to the best of our knowledge).   
We tried to use the FEKO to simulate the periodic structure; however, the 
manual told us that the periodic boundary in FEKO is only good for perfect 
conductor (to the best of our knowledge).

For the same problem and mesh distribution, we use the GEMS workstation to 
simulate it  and the simulation is summarized in Table 5.13.

It is a rather straightforward job for us to use the PBC boundary to simulate a 
periodic structure using GEMS. Its procedure is exactly same as that used in the 
regular problem. The basic steps in GEMS are described as follows: 
 
1. Specify a new unit and then create a new project. 
2. Draw one cylinder and assign the material to it. 
3. Use the hardclone or softclone option to generate a cylinder array. 
4. Select the no DC differential Gaussian pulse and input the highest frequency 
in the excitation pulse setting window. 
5. Specify the element size in the “Computational Domain” window, and select 
the PBC boundary in the x- and y-directions. There should be no white space 
between the PBC boundary and simulation area. Select the PML boundary in 
the z-direction, and have 10 cells of white space in the z-direction.  
6. Design the mesh and the cell size selected to be 0.75 mm. 
7. Validate the project and then simulate it on the laptop by clicking on the 
“Simulate” button. 
8. Click on the “Start” button in the GEMS solver window and click on the 
“DataProcessing” button after the simulation is completed, or we can open a 
project result file by clicking the “*.GPV” file in the project folder. 
9. Open the “Output” folder in the result tree in the GEMS display window. Go 
to the PBC folder and click on the either “AMP” or “AMP(dB)” in the 
“FreqDomain” folder to display the reflection or transmission coefficient. 
10. In addition to the frequency results, GEMS also generates the time- domain 
data so we can derive further parameters when it is necessary. For example, 
we can view and export the time-domain data by clicking the option in the 
“TimeDomain” folder. We can calculate the reflection and transmission 
coefficients in any frequency band, which is different from the prespecified 
one.

The simulation results obtained from GEMS and CST are plotted in Figure 
5.35. Although CST uses the unit cell boundary (frequency-domain solver) and 
GEMS (time-domain solver) uses the periodic boundary condition, the results from 
CST and GEMS matches very well. If we put the measurement data [21] in Figure 
5.35, we will observe that it is in an excellent agreement with the simulation result.

Summary: We only need to simulate one element of the periodic structure taking 
benefit from the periodic structure. The performance strongly depends on the 
user’s experience, and the readers should simulate it using the different software 
packages and draw their own conclusions.

5.8  STANDARD SAR TEST 
In this part, we use GEMS and CST to simulate the test case used in IEEE 
Standard 1528 [9]. The phantom configuration is shown in Figure 5.36. 
The reference SAR value in the IEEE Standard is also generated by using the 
FDTD method. We tried to use HFSS and FEKO for the same problem, both of 
which showed the memory shortage error message. In CST, the SAR calculation is 
carried out in the data postprocessing. The simulation time in the postprocessing 
should be taken into account.

box. 
 
In IEEE Standard 1528, the plastic box is filled with the tissue-equivalent 
liquid, and the dipole is used an excitation outside the plastic shell. The plastic 
shell has the relative permittivity = 3.7 and the loss tangent = 0.05 for all the test 
frequencies from 300 to 3,000 MHz. The parameters of tissue-equivalent liquid are 
listed in Table 5.14.

frequency 300 MHz and 3.6 mm for frequencies from 900 to 3,000 MHz.

We plot the SAR difference between CST and GEMS for 1-g SAR, 10-g 
SAR, and local peak SAR in Figures 5.37 to 5.39. It is evident from Figures 5.37 
to 5.39 that GEMS is much more accurate than CST. The x- and y-axes in Figures 
5.37 to 5.39 stand for the frequencies and the relative SAR error to the reference 
given in the IEEE Standard 1528, respectively. The relative error in Figures 5.37 to

5.9  WAVEGUIDE FILTER 
In this section, we introduce the simulation method for the high Q systems using 
the time-domain solver. One waveguide filter, as shown in Figure 5.42, whose 
dimensions were taken from the literature [10], includes five open cavities and is a 
very good passband filter in the frequency range from 11.8 to 12.3 GHz. The 
original paper shows five poles; however, following the dimensions given in the 
paper, we can only see four poles.    
It is a challenging problem for the time-domain solver since it may require 
running the time-domain solver very long to get the convergence solution. There 
exist two techniques that can be used to efficiently achieve the convergence 
solution. In the first technique, a window function such as the Hamming window 
function or Kaiser function is used to truncate the time-domain signatures. We can 
get very good results for the S-parameters and impedance. The main problem 
caused by the window functions is that the power conservation will not be satisfied 
in the passband, for example, the summation of |S11|2 and |S21|2 for a two-port filter 
is smaller than 1 in the passband. In the second technique, we only need to run the 
simulation in a short time period to get the major information of the resonant 
structure, and then the extrapolation technique is applied to get the complete 
system time-domain response. However, this approach strongly depends on the 
system property and the user’s experience. GEMS provides both methods, but their 
performance may vary from case to case.  
In this part, we introduce the detailed simulation procedure for the waveguide 
filter, and present the simulation results from HFSS and CST as the reference. As 
the statements in the previous examples shown, the results from other software

packages were carried by the independent third party. The results may vary from 
user to user and from version to version.

The design of the waveguide filter is in the SAT format rather than in a solid 
structure. To generate a hollow waveguide filter model, we can select one surface 
of the solid model and copy and paste the selected surfaces. Since the two ends of 
filter are opened, we deselect the two end surfaces to get a group of surfaces. We 
then delete the original model, and unite the surfaces as a single object and then 
assign it to be a perfect electric conductor (PEC). We can use GEMS to simulate it 
directly since GEMS allows us to simulate the infinitely thin shell. Use the PML 
boundary to truncate the two opened ports and use the PEC boundary condition to 
truncate the four sides of waveguide. We do not need any white space between the 
filter to the domain boundary since the boundary should touch the filter in the six 
directions.         
We use TE10 mode to excite one port of filter and measure the transmission on 
TE10 mode at the output port. The cutoff frequency of WR75 (width=19.5 mm and 
height=9.525 mm) extracted in GEMS is 7.868 GHz. The domain is discretized 
into 57×26×288 nonuniform cells with the minimum cell size 0.3 mm and ratio 
1.03. The convergence criterion is chosen to be −50 dB. The S-parameters are 
plotted in Figure 5.43 with HFSS and CST results together for the sake of 
comparison.

The power conservation is plotted in Figure 5.44. We can observe from Figure 
5.44 that both CST and HFSS show better power conservation than GEMS. That is 
a greater number of cells to describe the mode pattern accurately. In addition, we 
plot the field variation along the central line of the filter at frequency 12 GHz. The 
field distributions at the different frequencies are shown in Figure 5.45. The field 
distribution inside the filter at the different frequencies is shown in Figure 5.46.

In GEMS, we use three ways to terminate the simulation: (1) check the time- 
domain signature, (2) check the S-parameters in frequency domain, and (3) check 
the power level (advanced option). For example, if you use −50 dB as a 
convergence criterion and the number of time steps for one domain period along 
the longest direction is N, we will pick the maximum absolute value in the last N 
steps and compare to the global peak value, the code will stop if the ratio is less 
than −50 dB. We also compare the frequency-domain result at each frequency and 
the simulation will stop when the maximum difference is less than −50 dB. The 
power conservation checking option is designed for the lossless system, in which 
we use the formula 1−|S11|2−|S21|2 to check the power convergence for a two-port 
network system. Without a window function, we directly run it until reaching the 
convergence criterion −50 dB. GEMS achieved the convergence solution at about 
35,000 time steps. 
Unlike the discussion in the previous examples, we will not show the detailed 
comparison here since the simulation time may be hugely different using a 
different mesh size for similar results. In CST, when using the original CAD file to 
generate a waveguide that has an infinitely thin waveguide wall, the CST results

have a significant shift from both GEMS and HFSS. When the waveguide is 
changed to be a finite thickness or the background is filled with PEC, the CST 
results are close to the HFSS and GEMS. 
Once again, the examples presented in this chapter are used to help the readers 
get a basic idea of how to apply the different computational approaches to simulate 
some simple examples. The performance, ability, accuracy, and memory usage of 
each EM software package on different practical applications may vary 
significantly. For example, HFSS can generate the adaptive mesh without requiring 
any experience in these simple examples, and HFSS can generate reasonable 
results except the dielectric sphere and Vivaldi antenna. However, for most 
practical applications such as the cell phone antenna in Section 5.6, using the 
default mesh in HFSS, you can either simulate them limited to the available 
memory or take a very long time to get the results, or you are required to work on 
the model modifications for days or weeks before the simulation. Therefore, the 
best way to generate an adaptive mesh in GEMS is that based on the problem you 
are solving, you can directly provide the EM software the minimum cell size that is 
equal to the dimension of interest or half, and then adjust the mesh ratio according 
the available memory and expected simulation time.        
Before closing this chapter, we do a standard test for the time-domain solvers, 
in which a hollow box is truncated by using the PEC boundary and discretized into 
the uniform mesh. Using a computer installed with 2-GB memory (Windows XP 
OS), GEMS can solve a domain size with 54 million unknowns (300×300×600), 
but CST on the same computer can only solve a domain size with 8 million 
unknowns (200×200×200). Now let us test the performance of GEMS and CST for 
a hollow domain with 1 million unknowns (100×100×100). The simulation time 
and memory requirement are summarized in Table 5.25.

Large Multiscale Problem Solving 
 
 
In this chapter, we present several practical applications that are simulated by 
using the FDTD method on either a powerful workstation or a cluster. We use 
these examples to introduce the key simulation techniques that will significantly 
affect the simulation performance and the computer resource requirements [1−4].     
6.1  RADIO FREQUENCY PROTECTION 
A SAM head model [5] with a smart cell phone aside is shown in Figure 6.1. The 
human model includes a plastic shell (relative permittivity = 5 and the conductivity 
= 0.0125 S/m) and is filled with a liquid whose properties are similar to that of the 
human tissue. It has a relative permittivity of 39 and a conductivity of 1.89 S/m.

There are several important factors we need to consider when we design the 
simulation: (1) two fine structures, the antenna and shell of the human model, as 
shown in Figures 6.2 and 6.3, (2) antenna orientation, and (3) the distance between 
the cell phone and human model. The fine features in the cell phone will determine 
the minimum cell size, which will decide the simulation performance and 
accuracy. The antenna ports must be oriented along with the system axis to 
generate the correct simulation results. Even if we cannot do it in some special 
case, we have to add an extension part to meet the requirement. The distance 
between the cell phone and human model will demonstrate the correct SAR level.

Now we explain how to set the correct simulation options in the FDTD 
simulation. We first set the cell phone in the proper orientation so that the antenna 
ports are parallel to the system axis. If possible, the major antenna pieces are also 
set to be parallel to the system axis. Since there is no fine structure inside the 
human head model, the orientation of the head model is not so important. 
However, if we like to plot the 3-D far-field pattern referring to the human head 
model, we may need to rotate the 3-D far field according to the requirements. The 
shell of the human head model is in a complex shape, but the conformal technique 
can handle it regardless of the orientation. Therefore, we set the position and 
orientation of the cell phone in the desired way, and then change the position and 
orientation of the human head model accordingly. 
In order to set the distance between the cell phone and the head model, we can 
define two points, one on the cell phone and the other on the human model, as 
shown in Figure 6.3. The distance between the cell phone and the human head 
model can be adjusted by controlling the distance of the two points.  
 
 
Figure 6.3    
Reference points defined in the cell phone and the head model to set up the phone 
relative position. 
 
This is an open space problem, and the absorbing boundary is applied to 
truncate the six walls, and there are six cells of white space between the objects 
and absorbing boundary. For this SAM head model, both the plastic shell and inner 
equivalent material are not dispersive, and hence the simulation performance is 
relatively good compared to the dispersive case.  
We select the cell size based on the fine structure in the phone model. In this 
example, we need to use two to three cells inside the excitation gap to get good 
results. In some cases, there are many fine features around the feed port, and we 
may not capture the key points in the feed structure. To let the grids capture the 
key points in the feed structure, we can define some key points on the port

Point 2 (x2,y2,z2)

structure, and force the grids to pass these key points when we use the automesh 
generation procedure, as shown in Figure 6.4.  
For the antenna problems, the antenna material can be copper (good 
conductor) or PEC that does not affect much on the return and far-field pattern. We 
smartly use the copper or PEC material only when we would like to reduce the 
simulation time or memory requirement. In general, the PEC is good for the most 
cases.

We can use the pure Gaussian pulse or differential pulse as the excitation 
pulse for this problem. The 3-dB beamwidth frequency is selected to be 2.7 GHz, 
which is the highest frequency of interest. The 3-D SAR distributions at 2.4 GHz, 
2.6 GHz, and 3.0 GHz inside the head model are shown in Figures 6.5 to 6.7, 
which enable us to check to see if the phone is compliant.

To calculate the SAR, we need to assign the material density to the structure; 
otherwise, the FDTD code cannot generate the SAR output directly. The SAR is 3-
D data that is usually big and its output is time-consuming. To improve the 
simulation performance, we can select a small region where the SAR value is 
interesting. The FDTD code only calculates the SAR distribution, 1-g SAR, 10-g 
SAR, peak SAR, and average SAR in the specified region.     
We compare the simulated results in Figure 6.8 for mean effective gain 
(MEG) with the measured data to show that the comparison between the two is 
good. The S-parameters of the cell phone structure are plotted in Figure 6.9,

two.

6.2  COMB-SHAPED ANTENNA ARRAY 
The comb-shaped element of antenna array [7−12] is shown in Figure 6.10. This is 
an open space problem and the absorbing boundary is applied to truncate all the six 
walls without any white space between the antenna and absorbing boundary. The 
frequency band of interest is from 2 to 11 GHz. The differential Gaussian pulse 
with the 3-dB beamwidth of 11 GHz is used as the excitation pulse. The project 
model is shown in Figure 6.11.

We use three cells inside the gap between two arms, as shown in Figure 6.12. 
The return loss and peak gain of a pair of comb elements obtained from both the 
measurement and simulation are plotted in Figure 6.13. It is observed from Figure 
6.13 that the deviation between the measurement and the simulation at the higher 
frequencies occurs because the measurement is not accurate at the higher 
frequencies. The good agreement between the simulation and measurement is 
evident from Figure 6.14. It is worthwhile to mention that the peak gain plotted in 
Figure 6.14 is in the E-plane and H-plane since the measurement was carried out in 
the two major cuts.

6.3  TACKING REFLECTOR ANTENNA 
A high gain antenna [13] includes a parabolic reflector antenna, as shown in Figure

The diameter of the main reflector is 700 mm, which is about 49 wavelengths 
at 21 GHz. The fill-in material inside the feed coaxial cable is Teflon (dielectric 
constant is 2.08). Hence, the wavelength inside the fill-in dielectric is shorter than 
that in free space.  
The antenna dimension in the vertical direction is 316 mm, that is, about 22 
wavelengths. The fine structure dimension in both the horizontal and vertical 
directions is 0.4 mm, as shown in Figure 6.21.

The basic mode supported by the coaxial cable is the transverse 
electromagnetic (TEM), therefore, we first use the TEM mode to excite the 
antenna and calculate its return loss and far-field pattern. If we use the minimum 
cell size to be 0.4 mm in the three directions and the ratio between adjacent cells to 
be 1.05, the total number of cells will be 1,450×1,450×930 (1,955 Mcells) that 
requires at least 40 GB of memory. Using its symmetric property, we can only 
simulate the quarter domain and then reduce the problem size to the one quarter of 
the original problem. The return loss and 2-D and 3-D directivity patterns are 
shown in the Figures 6.22 to 6.24.

Although we do not show the experimental results here, the return loss and 
far-field pattern match well with what the designer expects. Next, we use TE21 
mode [3, 12] to excite the reflector antenna, as shown in Figure 6.25(a). The TE21 
mode is also symmetric about the x- and y-axes, and the one-quarter mode pattern 
is shown in Figure 6.25(b).

numerical method FDFD. 
 
TE21 mode has two degenerated patterns and the cutoff frequencies of the two 
degenerated modes are 11.93 and 12.22 GHz, respectively. The two modes will 
generate similar far-field patterns and return loss. However, the far-field patterns 
will rotate 45 degrees for two degenerated excitation modes. 
The TEM mode pattern in the coaxial cable can be expressed in the analytic 
formula. However, the electric field pattern of TE21 mode cannot be obtained by 
the analytic method. The finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) method can  
be used to extract the TE21 mode patterns numerically [3].  
In order to avoid the interpolation operations, we use the same mesh in both 
the FDTD and FDFD methods. Unlike the FDTD method, the FDFD method 
requires solving the matrix equations that have lower efficiency than the FDTD 
method. If the cross section is larger, the mode extraction procedure will take a 
while.  
In order to show the accuracy of the symmetric simulation method, we 
simulate both the full structure and one-quarter geometry. The directivity patterns 
at f=20.74 GHz and in φ=0o plane for the symmetric and full structures are shown 
in Figure 6.26. The difference only happens in the very low level due to the 
different mesh distributions, namely, excellent agreement is between the

excellent agreement between the one-quarter and full structures. Since the 
excitation mode is not symmetric, it is necessary for us to check the far-field 
pattern at the different φ. The directivity patterns in φ=0o, 45o, 90o, and 135o planes

6.4  PARTIAL SYMMETRIC PROBLEM SIMULATION 
A reflector antenna fed by a patch array that includes 32 patch elements, as shown 
in Figure 6.30. The diameter of the reflector is 12,000 mm and the distance from 
the feed array to the reflector is 6,600 mm. The frequency band of interest is from 
0.5 to 2 GHz. Because the fine structures are involved in the feed support and 
patch array, it is very hard or impossible to simulate it using a single computer. 
The feed structure is a patch array, and hence, it cannot be directly simulated by 
using the symmetric method. In the regular symmetric simulation method, the 
excitation ports should be at least four (if it is not on the axis) if we use the PEC or 
perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) boundary to truncate the structure. In order to 
calculate the S-parameters, we need to excite one port at one time and terminate all 
other ports using the match loads. To this end, we need to simulate the symmetric 
structure four times to remove the contribution from the three images in the near 
field and far fields. We can combine the results from the four simulations to get the 
final result that is generated by the one-port excitation. To validate this method, 
first we simulate the entire patch array (without the reflector) that is excited by 
using a single port and the rest of the ports are terminated by using the match 
loads, as shown in Figure 6.31. Then we simulate the one quarter of the structure 
four times, in which the boundary condition is different in each simulation, for 
example, PEC at the Xmin and Ymin walls in the first simulation, PMC at the Xmin and 
Ymin walls in the second simulation, PEC at the Xmin wall and PMC at the Ymin wall 
in the third simulation, and PMC at the Xmin wall and PEC at the Ymin wall in the 
fourth simulation, as shown in Figure 6.32.

We can get the port voltage and current directly by calculating the vector 
summation of the four results obtained in the four simulations and divided by a 
factor 4, as shown in Figure 6.32. However, for the S-parameters and far-field 
patterns, we cannot simply calculate them by adding the four results together. For 
the S-parameters, we need to calculate the total port voltages and currents, and then 
calculate the S-parameters from the total voltages and currents. For the far-field 
patterns, we need to calculate one far-field component at each time.

In the patch array, each patch is connected to two probes, and the excitation 
source or match loads are located in the small gap between the probe and ground

Follow a similar procedure to calculate the far-field patterns. As mentioned 
above, we need to calculate the summation of Eθ and Eφ, respectively. The slight 
difference between the entire and symmetric structure simulations is caused by the 
spatial downsampling used in the far-field pattern calculation, as shown in Figure 
6.34. It is evident from Figure 6.34 that we can get the solution of the large 
problems without simulating the entire structure if the geometry is symmetric.

6.5  FLAT REFLECTOR ANTENNA

TE10 mode, as shown in Figure 6.38.

Figure 6.38    (a) Flat reflector antenna configuration, (b) the pattern of the holes, and (c) the zoomed 
hole pattern. The holes have different depth to force the wave to focus on the focal 
point. 
 
The diameter of the reflector is 300 mm and the distance from the feed horn to 
the reflector is 210 mm. The frequency band of interest is 71 to 86 GHz. It is very 
hard to simulate it using a single computer since it is a relatively electrically large 
problem (86×86×60 wavelengths). Since the structure is symmetric about the x- 
and y-axes, we only need to simulate one-quarter of the structure and can get the 
solution of the original problem. The PEC and PMC boundary at the Xmin and Ymin 
walls are determined by the polarization of the excitation. For example, if the 
excitation is Ey inside the horn, the PMC and PEC boundary should be applied to 
the Xmin and Ymin walls, respectively. 
In the original design, the feed horn has a finite thickness that is 0.01 mm. 
Since the thickness of the horn does not affect much on both the return loss and 
far-field pattern, we can ignore it to reduce the memory requirement and

match load in the practical applications. Here we use a match load to terminate the 
feed port and then add the TE10 mode excitation. The feed horn configuration and

The fine structure in the problem geometry is the thickness of the adhesive 
material (0.012 mm) and the gap (0.029 mm) between the strip lines and the top 
surface. Hence, the minimum cell size in the vertical direction is taken to be 0.012 
mm. The minimum dimension in the horizontal direction is the width of the strip 
lines. Since part of the strip line is slanted, we need to use at least two cells inside 
the strip line to ensure that the strip line is not broken in the slanted part. The 
domain is discretized into 794,000 (254×194×15) cells. The mesh distribution 
across the strip lines is shown in Figure 6.45. The slanted strip lines and the 
trapezoidal cross section are modeled using the conformal technique.

6.7  CARD READER EMI ANALYSIS 
Configuration of a card reader is shown in Figure 6.49. In this example, we need to 
calculate the field strength behind the card reader coupled from the outside when a 
plane wave is incident from the z-direction. Since the card reader is installed in the 
electronic device (say, a computer), the card reader is surrounded by the PEC 
walls, and hence, the power can only come to the card reader through the card inset 
slot in the front face, as shown in Figure 6.49.  The coupled power needs to pass 
the front slot and signal connecting pieces to reach the surface behind the card, as 
shown in Figure 6.50.

The absorbing boundary is applied to truncate four walls without the white 
space in the −x-, −y-, x-, and y-directions, and with the white space in the −z- and z-
directions. Since there is no white space in the −x-, −y-, x- and y-directions, there is 
no direct power going through the card reader except through the slot, as shown in 
Figure 6.51.

In this example, the frequency band of interest is from 10 MHz to 1 GHz. The 
differential Gaussian pulse is used as the excitation pulse and the 3-dB beamwidth 
is 1 GHz. The fine structure inside the card reader is the connecting piece, as 
shown in Figure 6.52, and the minimum dimension is 0.4 mm. The minimum cell 
size is taken to be 0.2 mm, namely, there are two cells across the connecting piece. 
The mesh size ratio of the adjacent cells is not important; however, the interesting 
region or structures should be meshed properly. During the mesh generation, if we 
need to describe the field exactly, we can define some key points on the important 
position and ensure that the mesh can capture the field variation at the important 
points.  
The output parameter in this example is the coupling level of the power 
through the card reader. We define an observation surface behind the card, as 
shown in Figure 6.53. In the FDTD simulation, we calculate the field distribution 
on the observation surface at the specified frequencies. The field distribution at 1 
GHz is shown in Figure 6.54. We search and store the maximum value on the 
surface. When the simulation is convergent, we output the maximum values on the 
observation surface into a data file and plot it in Figure 6.55.

6.8  CLOAKING STRUCTURE 
The cloaking structure [14−16] consists of a copper kernel and 10 layers of open 
split rings, as shown in Figure 6.56. The relative permittivity, loss tangent, and 
thickness of the dielectric layers on which the rings are mounted are 2.33, 
0.001555, and 0.38 mm, respectively. The width and length of the open split rings 
are 3,985 μm and 3,000 μm, respectively. The width of the ring strip is 200 μm. 
The radius of the cylindrical kernel is 25 mm. We can take advantage of its 
symmetry and only simulate half structure to reduce the computational burden, 
although the problem still remains large, as is evident from Table 6.2.

This problem has not been simulated in the past, except by using a simplified 
equivalent model for the structure. However, such a model does not take into 
account the anisotropic nature of the spit-ring elements that form the cloak, and 
what is needed to accurately predict its performance for the case of oblique 
incidence. Note that the actual physical structure is much too large to be handled 
by a single processor, for both the normal as well as oblique incidence cases.  
For our simulation, we assume an illuminating plane wave that is incident on 
the cloaking structure at an angle of θ=135o. We observe from Figure 6.57 that 
there is low reflection from the cloaking structure as the plane wave hits the 
cloaked surface. We observe, therefore, the performance of the cloaking structure, 
which has been designed for normal incidence, is less than ideal when the angle of 
incidence is oblique. Incidentally, this is also true when the frequency of the 
incident wave differs from the one for which the cloak was originally designed. 
We point out, once again, that it is not possible to predict the performance of the 
cloaking structure when operating under general conditions by using the effective 
medium approach.

Summary 
 
 
In this chapter, we summarize the important factors in the FDTD method, FDTD 
software development, and simulation techniques. This summary is based on the 
authors’ experiences during the past 20 years of FDTD method research. Due to 
different backgrounds, readers may have different opinions on some factors. 
However, no matter which way we choose, the final goal is to use the FDTD 
method efficiently to solve practical problems. 
7.1   FDTD METHOD 
The FDTD method is one kind of numerical technique that is used to solve 
Maxwell’s equations in the time domain [1]. Due to its explicit recursive format, it 
is not necessary to solve Green’s function and matrix equations in the FDTD 
method. Using the central difference formulation with the uniform mesh, the first-
order difference formulation has the second-order accuracy [1]. Higher-order 
difference formulation [2] can reduce the numerical dispersion; however, it will 
dramatically increase the simulation time and memory requirement. The FDTD 
update equations do not contain the boundary information; therefore, the boundary 
to truncate the computational domain is required. For the open space problems, the 
desired absorbing boundary condition is PML [3, 4] today. Among the different 
versions of PML, the CPML [4] is the best choice today because its formulation is 
not related to the type of materials inside the computational domain. For the closed 
space problems, the selection of boundary is based on the property of problems.  
To solve the practical problems, it is not sufficient for us to have only the 
FDTD update equations and boundary condition. We need to consider the 
following factors: 
 
1. The size of the time step is chosen to meet the Courant condition [5] to 
achieve a stable solution. 
 
2. Cell size must be small enough to satisfy the requirement of numerical 
dispersion level [1].  

188                                            Advanced FDTD Methods 
3. Spectrum of the excitation pulse should cover the frequency band of 
interest. The too narrow pulse will influence the convergence property 
and the time-domain signature may become meaningless due to the 
serious numerical dispersion. 
 
4. The boundary of the dielectric objects requires special treatment 
regardless of the object shapes due to the singularity of the tangential 
component. 
 
5. Plane wave excitation implementation is selected to be either scattering 
formulation or scattering/total formulation [1]. The scattering formulation 
is more accurate in the incident wave than the scattering/total formulation, 
especially for the large space problems; however, it is more time-
consuming due to its reality is in the 3-D space. 
 
6. Far-field calculation is realized by the near-to-far-field transformation.  
The downsampling in the space and time domain will significantly reduce 
the simulation time and memory requirement. The surface for near field 
calculation can be one surface and two surfaces [6]. In the one surface 
case, both the magnetic and electric fields are averaged to the selected 
surface. However, in the two surface case, the electric and magnetic fields 
are averaged to the two different surfaces. The far field using the two 
surfaces is usually more accurate than using the one surface.  
 
7. The direct output parameters of the FDTD method are electric and 
magnetic fields, which have one-half cell shift in the space and one-half 
time step shift in the time domain. Ignoring this shift will cause the 
approximation error at higher frequencies.      
 
8. Parallel processing techniques [7] are divided into the method based on 
OpenMP [8] or MPI [9]. OpenMP is designed to use the multiple cores 
inside one CPU or multiple CPUs that share the same host name. 
However, MPI allows us to use the distributed resources, but we need to 
develop the FDTD code using the MPI library. 
 
9. Hardware acceleration techniques include multiple core processor, VALU 
[10], GPU [11], and FPGA [12]. The FDTD code developed using 
OpenMP is simple and can use all the compute cores inside the multiple 
core processor. VALU acceleration requires the developers be familiar 
with the SSE instruction set. GPU acceleration requires the developers to 
be familiar with the CUDA development kit and a separate GPU card. 
FPGA acceleration requires the developers to have some hardware and 
circuit knowledge. 
Besides these factors, there are a lot of techniques in the FDTD method that are 
important for us to use the FDTD method to solve the practical problems, such as 

Summary                                                       189 
 
 
conformal techniques, subgridding techniques, nonuniform mesh technique, ADI 
techniques [13], lumped element modeling, dispersive medium simulation [14], 
periodic structure simulation, nonlinear material simulation, body of revolution 
technique, metamaterial simulation techniques [15], and so on.  
7.2   FDTD CODE DEVELOPMENT 
The performance of the FDTD code will be different for the different programmers 
even if they use the same language. In any case, the key is for the developers to 
fully understand the data structure inside the memory. For example, the data of a  
3-D array is continuous in the X-Y plane. The update loop in FORTRAN language 
should be written in the following way to reach better code performance: 
 
Do k=0, Nz 
Do j=0, Ny 
Do i=0, Nx 
E_update;  
End do  
End do 
End do 
 
The update loop in C/C++ language should be written in the following way to 
reach the better code performance: 
 
For (i=0; i<= Nx; i++) { 
For ( j=0; j<= Ny, j++) { 
For (k=0; k<=Ny; k++) { 
E_update;  
               } 
       } 
 } 
 
Considering the parallel processing and hardware acceleration, the update loop of 
electric fields should be placed in one loop. In this way, we can reuse the magnetic 
fields for the electric field update. For example, in C/C++ language, 
 
For (i=0; i<= Nx; i++) { 
For ( j=0; j<= Ny, j++) { 
For (k=0; k<=Ny; k++) { 
Ex_update; 
Ey_update; 
Ez_update; 
              } 
        } 
 } 

190                                            Advanced FDTD Methods 
In addition, considering the large amount of memory and memory price, we 
would rather achieve the best performance that may require increasing the memory 
usage. In any case, we should reduce the number of multiplications and divisions 
to the minimum inside the three layer loops.   
Assemble language has a higher performance compared to FORTRAN and 
C/C++, but the code will be complex and not easy to debug. Both SIMD and SSE 
require developers to understand the hardware architecture.   
7.3   FDTD SIMULATION TECHNIQUES 
FDTD simulation technique is a bridge between the FDTD method and the 
engineering applications. The FDTD simulation technique will tell us how to use 
FDTD method to solve the practical problems. The main context of the simulation 
technique is how we can use the limited resource to solve one problem in a 
reasonable time frame.  We summarize the main points in the simulation technique 
as follows: 
 
1. Mesh design. In principle, the smaller the cell size, the more accurate the 
result. However, we cannot afford the price caused by the smaller cell size. 
For example, the simulation complexity is inversely proportional to h4, 
where h is the cell size. We have to find a balance between the simulation 
time, memory usage, and accuracy.  
In practical applications, nonuniform mesh is helpful to balance the 
simulation time, memory usage, and accuracy. The proper ratio of 
adjacent cells is important to reach the best code performance. The 
subgridding is also a solution to reduce the simulation and memory usage, 
however the explicit differential technique is usually late time unstable, 
and the implicit technique has a low efficiency.  
Actually, the mesh design is the trickiest part in the FDTD simulation. 
The important points in complex objects or interface of the different 
materials may significantly affect the simulation results. We define them 
as the key points during the mesh design. These points are detectable 
during the mesh generation by checking the geometrical shapes and 
material distribution. If they are too close to each other, we cannot use the 
too small cell size to discretize the computational domain limited to the 
computer resource, and we need to decide the most important key points 
manually and force the mesh passing these selected points.    
 
2. Boundary condition. Application of the boundary condition is a relatively 
simple job in the FDTD simulation since there exist several typical 
boundary conditions in the FDTD method such as absorbing boundary, 

Summary                                                       191 
 
 
PEC and PMC boundary, and periodic boundary. For the regular 
computational domains where the length, height, and width of the 
computational domain are equal or very close, we only need to set a 
proper white space between the objects and the domain boundary. The 
problem will become complex when the domain shape is irregular; for 
example, if the width and length of the domain are much larger than its 
height, the small white space in the height direction may result in the late 
time instability. 
For the symmetric structures, we can use PEC or PMC to reduce the 
computational domain to half, quarter, or one-eighth of the original 
domain size if the excitation satisfies certain requirements.    
 
3. Excitation pulse. The frequently used excitation pulse includes the pure 
Gaussian and differential Gaussian. The integral of the pure Gaussian 
pulse with respect to time is larger than zero, namely, the pure Gaussian 
excitation will move the pure charge from one pole to another one during 
the simulation, which will generate the DC component in the result time 
signature. However, if the port constructs a loop in some ways, the charge 
cannot be accumulated after the excitation disappears. Since the pure 
Gaussian contains more low frequency components, we usually select the 
pure Gaussian pulse as the excitation source when the frequency band of 
interest is very low. In contrast to the pure Gaussian pulse, we use the 
differential Gaussian pulse in most applications. 
 
4. Excitation. In some cases, the excitation port has a clear definition and we 
know exactly how to excite it. But, in some cases, there exist several ways 
to excite an excitation port. A simple example is a patch antenna fed by a 
microstrip line. There are at least three ways to excite the excitation port: 
(1) we can use a match load to terminate the port first and then add a 
voltage excitation between the ground plane to the microstrip line, (2) we 
can terminate the microstrip line at the port at the absorbing boundary if 
the ground plane is infinity and then use a voltage or current to excite the 
port, and (3) we can treat it as a port that is excited by a TEM mode. The 
mode can be extracted by using different frequency-domain techniques.  
For the output ports we can follow a similar idea to extract the port 
voltage and current. 
 
5. Thin PEC sheet. The conformal techniques for PEC and dielectric objects 
are different, so selecting the ideal material type can significantly improve 

192                                            Advanced FDTD Methods 
the FDTD performance. Dielectric conformal technique is realized 
through averaging the dielectric parameters. However, the PEC conformal 
technique requires modifying the field update procedure. For a thin PEC 
sheet, if the skin depth is important, we need to use at least two cells 
inside the thin PEC to describe the field variation. Otherwise, we can 
ignore its thickness and treat it as the infinitely thin PEC structure so that 
a coarse mesh can be employed.   
7.4   HARDWARE PLATFORM 
No matter how the FDTD code is developed, its performance must be realized on a 
better hardware platform. Here we present several guidelines on how to select the 
simulation hardware platforms. Generally speaking, a faster computer with the 
maximum memory is desired for the FDTD simulation. However, we frequently 
have to make a choice between the performance and cost.  
The CPU speed must match the amount of memory. If too much memory is 
installed inside a computer, though we can simulate large problems, the simulation 
time may be beyond what we can afford. If we install a small amount of memory 
inside a powerful computer, the computer cannot be used to solve the large 
problems limited to the memory.  
Multiple core processor and multiple CPUs have become a trend in hardware 
platform development [16, 17]. Multiple cores inside one computer can be fully 
used by OpenMP (multicore CPU), MPI (multiple CPUs), or a combination.  
Multiple CPU computers today are developed based on the NUMA 
architecture, which allows us to improve the memory performance. To use the 
NUMA system, we usually need to modify the configuration file.  
If we develop the FDTD code based on the Qt technique, the FDTD code will 
be cross platforms, namely, we do not need to modify the FDTD code when we 
change the operating system. The operating system can be Windows or Linux, and 
can reach similar performances of OpenMP and MPI.        
The network speed in a cluster must match with the computer speed and 
number of computing nodes. The network is still the bottleneck today in the high 
performance cluster. For the parallel FDTD code, the latency of a network is one 
of the most important factors since the data exchanging happens at each time step.  
Besides the network performance, the memory bandwidth and hard disc 
performance are also very important factors. Namely, to achieve a better cluster 
performance, the performance of the network, CPU, memory, and hard drive must 
be well matched.

Antenna Power and Efficiency 
 
 
Suppose an excitation source has an electric current density J
r
 and a magnetic 
current density M
r
; we calculate the power  supplied to an antenna system when it 
is connected to an antenna system. If the electric and magnetic fields inside the 
source region V are E
r
 and H
r
, respectively, the power supplied by the excitation 
source to the system can be expressed as [1, 2]:

where 
incident
P
 is the total incident power that the excitation source has when it is 
connected to an antenna. This total power includes the dissipation power on the 
source resistance and accepted power. The accepted power represents that the pure 
power passes the input port of antenna regardless of match or mismatch at the 
input port. For a lossless antenna, the accepted power should be equal to the 
radiation power. The matched radiation efficiency of an antenna, namely, accepted 
efficiency, is defined as:

Total Active Reflection Coefficient 
 
 
An n-port antenna array is an (N+2)-port network if considering the radiation as 
two ports for two polarizations. A complete S-parameter matrix should be an 
 (N+2)×(N+2) matrix. However, the two ports corresponding to two polarizations 
cannot be handled as a regular port. According to the literature [1], we define a 
total active reflection coefficient for the multiport antenna array.   
For a desired port excitation, the total active reflection coefficient (TARC) of 
the antenna is defined as the square root of the available power generated by all 
excitation minus the radiated power, divided by the available power as follows [1, 
2]:

=
Γ
                                                 (C.1) 
 
The incident power, radiation power, and dissipation power are known, and the 
accepted power is equal to the incident power subtracting the dissipation power. 
According to the definition above, the available power is the forward power, but 
the forward is unknown in a multiport antenna array. For a lossless antenna, 
TARC can be calculated by using S-parameter matrix. For a given excitation [a], 
the

We do not need to define TARC as a complex number because the phase reference 
plane does not have any physical meaning for a multiport antenna.  TARC is a real 
number between zero and one. When the TARC equals zero, all the delivered 
power is radiated and when it equals one, all the power is either reflected back or 
goes to the other ports.

MEG and ECC  
 
 
The performance of a mobile phone is determined by both the antenna quality and 
the environment in which the mobile device is embedded. Both the mean effective 
gain (MEG) and envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) depend on the distribution 
of the incoming power and the orientation of the antenna relative to this 
environment  [1, 2]. 
D.1  PROPAGATION ENVIRONMENTS 
To calculate the ECC and the MEG, we need to take into consideration the 
incident radio wave. The propagation effects are defined as the power spectrum of 
the polarized incoming waves

MEG is a statistical measurement of the antenna gain in a mobile environment [2]. 
In a particular environment, MEG is defined as the power received by an antenna

efficiency, and the propagation effects, as in the following equation:

Lossy Dielectric Simulation Technique  
 
 
In practical applications, if we do not mind the variation of dielectric loss with the 
frequency, we can specify the conductivity value in the FDTD method such as in 
most antenna problems. However, if the variation of dielectric loss cannot be 
ignored in the applications, we need to simulate the loss tangent in the FDTD 
method. Generally speaking, the input parameters of a dielectric material are 
permittivity and loss tangent, and both are constant in the selected frequency range. 
It is a well-known fact that the dispersion relationship in the frequency domain 
must be converted into the time domain in order to simulate it in the FDTD 
method [1, 2]. In this appendix, we introduce a simple but efficient technique to 
handle the loss tangent in the FDTD method  [3].   
We can use the approaches in the literature [1, 4] to extract the poles of the 
dispersive material using the Cauchy technique through the singular value 
decomposition technique. In this method, you need to provide the measurement 
dielectric parameters at more than two frequencies and go through a complex 
procedure.  
A complex permittivity can be expressed as [3]:

Circular Polarization Decomposition  
 
 
A circular polarization wave can be split into the summation of a left and a right 
polarization wave. The co- and cross-polarization levels are important parameters 
that need to be estimated when designing circularly polarized antennas. For the 
more general case of an elliptical polarization, the axial ratio (AR) and the circular 
polarization index (CPI) are often employed as indirect measures of cross 
polarization. However, sometimes the co- and cross-polarization levels are needed 
for circularly polarized antennas, and this information cannot be readily obtained 
from the existing EM simulation tools. In this appendix, we describe an approach 
for computing the co- and cross-polarization levels of circularly polarized 
antennas. 
In general, the fields radiated by an antenna are elliptically polarized, which 
can be resolved into a pair of orthogonal, circular polarized components at each 
point on the radiation sphere. The two components are EL and ER, whose senses 
are left- and right-handed rotations, respectively. Obviously, the dominant one 
corresponds to the copolarization, or the primary polarization that the antenna is 
designed to transmit (or receive). The other one is the cross-polarization, which is 
orthogonal to the copolarization and should have a low intensity as compared to 
the primary polarization. Thus, the instantaneous field of an elliptically polarized 
wave, traveling in the (θ, ϕ) direction, can be written as [1, 2]:

Vector Fitting Technique  
 
 
In most frequency-domain methods, we need to solve the problem one frequency 
at each time, namely, the solutions are only at the discrete frequencies. It is 
necessary for us to have a robust interpolation technique to generate a smooth 
curve from the discrete points. In this appendix, our objective is to calculate the 
unknown poles aj, residues cj, and the constant term d in the expression:

where ( )s
h
 is a vector or a scalar. To explain the method, we now assume that 
( )s
h
 is a scalar. The summation limit N is the order of the approximation, 
assumed to be known. 
We recall that the difficulty in fitting ( )s
h
 is due to the (unknown) poles aj, 
which appear in the denominator, thus causing (G.1) to become a nonlinear 
problem in the unknowns. However, if the poles had been known, then (G.1) 
would have been linear in the unknowns cj, d, which could then have easily been 
calculated by solving a linear, least-squares problem. Vector fitting solves (G.1) in 
two steps. Each step amounts to solving a linear system of the same form as (G.1), 
but with known poles. The vector fitting technique includes two steps. 
 
Step 1:  Pole identification. 
 
Instead of fitting ( )s

 directly, ( )s

It is seen from (G.5) that the initial poles aj cancel out, and that the zeros 
jzˆ  of 
( )s
θ
become the poles of ( )s
h
! The zeros of ( )s
θ
 are calculated by input/output 
interchange from its state equation obtained from (G.2).  
 
Step 2: Residue identification. 
 
With the poles of ( )s
h
 known from Step l, (G.1) is solved with respect to the 
unknown residues Cj and constant term d by solving a linear least-squares problem 
of the type Ax = b. Steps 1 and 2 may have to be repeated several times with the 
new poles as starting poles, in order for the method to converge. As convergence 
is achieved, ( )
s
θ
 becomes unity (i.e., all Cj become zero). With a good set of 
starting poles, we usually need fewer than five iterations for our applications. Thus, 
vector fitting solves (G.1) as follows.

Partially Symmetric Problem Simulation  
 
 
If both the problem geometry and excitation source are symmetric, we can use the 
proper PEC or PMC boundary to reduce the problem size to half, one-quarter, or 
one-eighth of the original problem. The selection of the PEC or PMC boundary at 
each side is determined by the polarization of the excitation source [1, 2]. The 
basic idea is described in Figure H.1.

Since the electric and magnetic fields are half cell offset in the FDTD mesh 
definition, the PEC and PMC boundaries are also half cell offset. However, the 
position of the PMC boundary varies with the cell size that is not desired for the 
practical problems. We can apply the PMC boundary on the edge of FDTD cell 
using the following idea: 
In Figure H.2, the electric fields on the PMC boundary are calculated by using 
the magnetic fields inside the simulation area and the corresponding images. If the 
problem structure is symmetric but the excitation source is not symmetric, for 
example, one case is shown in Figure H.3.

If we apply the PEC or PMC boundary to reduce the problem size, the 
excitation source is also imaged, and hence, there are four excitations in the 
original problem domain, as shown in Figure H.4. In order to obtain the solution of 
the original problem, we need to simulate the problem (only one-quarter of the 
original problem) four times in which the PEC and PMC boundaries should be 
changed properly. For example, the boundary should be PEC and PMC in the first 
simulation, PEC and PEC in the second simulation, PMC and PMC in the third 
simulation and PMC and PEC in the fourth simulation. The near-field result, such 
as electric and magnetic fields, voltage, and current, is equal to the summation 
divided by a factor of 4. The far-zone field can be calculated by the vector

Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR)  
 
 
Signal integrity is a growing priority as digital system designers pursue ever-
higher clock and data rates in computer, communications, video, and network 
systems. At today’s high operating frequencies, anything that affects a signal rise 
time, pulse width, timing, jitter, or noise content can impact reliability at the 
system level. To ensure signal integrity, it is necessary to understand and control 
impedance in the transmission environment through which the signals travel. 
Mismatches and variations can cause reflections that decrease signal quality as a 
whole.  
Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) [1, 2] indicates the reflections that result 
from a signal travelling through a transmission environment of some kind: a 
circuit board trace, a cable, a connector, and so on. The excitation source sends a 
narrow Gaussian pulse through the medium and compares the reflections from the 
unknown transmission environment to those produced by a standard impedance.  
The TDR display is the voltage waveform that returns when a fast step signal 
is propagated down a transmission line. The resulting waveform is the 
combination of the incident step and reflections generated when the step 
encounters impedance variations. 
The mathematical foundation of TDR measurements is elementary but 
important. Fundamentally, TDR value is based on a series of impedance ratios and 
are described in terms of a reflection coefficient, ρ. The coefficient ρ is the ratio of 
the reflected pulse amplitude to the incident pulse amplitude:

where Vincident is the integral of the incident pulse with respect to time and Vreflected 
is the integral of the reflected pulse with respect to time. The excitation pulse in 
FDTD simulation must be the narrow Gaussian that ensures there is no 
overlapping between the incident pulse and reflected pulse.  
For a fixed termination ZL, ρ can also be expressed in terms of the 
transmission line characteristic impedance, Z0 and the load impedance ZL.

Now that we have the formulas, if we plug in numbers representing a matched 
load, a short circuit, and an open load, we can see that ρ  has a range of values 
from +1 to −1, with 0 representing a matched load.  
When ZL is equal to Z0, the load is matched. Vreflected, the reflected wave, is 
equal to 0 and ρ is 0. There are no reflections:

A ZL reading of zero (0) implies a short circuit. The reflected wave is equal to 
the incident wave, but opposite in polarity. As seen below, the reflected wave 
negates part of the incident wave. The ρ  value is −1.

When ZL is infinite, an open circuit is implied. The reflected wave is equal to 
the incident wave and of the same polarity. As seen below, the reflected wave 
reinforces part of the incident wave. The ρ  value is +1.

S-Parameter Extraction   
 
 
The S-parameter is one of most important parameters in antennas, microwave 
circuits, EMC/EMI, and signal integrity. In this appendix we introduce the 
extraction techniques of the S-parameters for different types of applications.  
J.1  MATCHED S-PARAMETER 
For a multiple-port network system, we need to terminate all ports using the match 
loads and excite one port each time to calculate the S-parameter matrix. To 
calculate the S-parameters at the match status, we need to measure at least four 
voltages at the excitation port and one voltage at each output port. Without 
knowing the port impedance, we can calculate the S-parameters using the 
following procedure [1]: 
 
1. Measure four voltages at the excitation port along the feed structure V1, V2, V3, 
and V4.   
2. Assume the measured total voltage at the excitation port at position r includes 
two waves, namely, incident and reflected waves,

Another advantage of S-parameters springs from the simple relationship between 
the variables a1, a2, b1, and b2, and various power waves:

from a source impedance Z0.

:  Power reflected from the input port of the network, or power 
available from a Z0 source minus the power delivered to the input 
of the network.

J.3   MODE S-PARAMETER 
For the waveguide and coaxial structures, the excitation and output are usually the 
field distribution inside the structure. To calculate the S-parameters for this type of 
problem, we need to define a mode voltage and current that are used to derive the 
S-parameters [1].

Debye Model Construction   
 
 
In practical applications, the material manufacturers usually provide a parameter 
list that shows the variation of dispersive material parameters with the frequencies, 
as shown in Table K.1. We need to fit them into an analytic formulation that can 
be transformed to the time-domain expression through Fourier transformation, and 
then the material can be simulated in the FDTD simulation for the broadband 
results.

To handle the dispersive medium in the FDTD simulation, we can convert the 
model in the listed format in Table K.1 into the Debye model, which has been 
proved having the time-domain expression. The typical Debye model is expressed 
as follows [1, 2]:

Geometry Mapping Technique   
 
 
The project modeling is not related to the FDTD method directly; however, it 
plays a critical role in the FDTD simulation [1, 2]. In this appendix, we introduce a 
way that a complex model, for example, a cylinder FSS or cone FSS structure, can 
be mapped from a simple planar FSS structure, as shown in Figure L.1.

The width and length of the planar FSS structure are H and L, respectively 
(see Figure L.1(b)). The axis of cylindrical FSS structure that we will construct is 
along the x-direction. The radius of cylinder is r, as shown in Figure L.2.

where (x0, y0) is a point on the planar FSS sheet and h is the height of the point

Using (L.2), we can map the planar FSS structure to a cylindrical FSS 
structure. If the constructed cylinder is along the z-direction, we need to switch the 
variables x and z in (L.1).  For example, if the planar FSS structure is located in 
the X0Y plane, the width H and length L are taken to be 50 mm and 86.6 mm, 
respectively. We can get the cylindrical FSS structure, as shown in Figure L.3.

Next, we show you how to map a planar FSS structure in the X0Y plane to a 
conical FSS structure, as shown in Figure L.4. To this end, we need to know the 
geometry information marked in Figure L.4 for the FSS structure mapping.

For example, if the conical FSS structure is located in the X0Y plane, the 
geometry parameters are listed in Table L.1. We can get the conical FSS structure, 
as shown in Figure L.6.

Finally, we map a planar FSS structure in the X0Y plane to a circular frustum 
FSS structure, as shown in Figure L.7. To this end, we need to know the geometry 
information marked in Figure L.8 for the FSS structure mapping.

When we do the geometry mapping, the ill-conditioned cases may occur if the 
geometry parameters are selected improperly. Sometimes, to avoid the ill-
conditioned geometry such as in the case divided by zero, we may cut a small 
circle around the point (x0, y0) or set the angle ϕ from 0o to 359o.  Sometimes, we 
may need to split the transform procedure into two steps to get the desired pattern. 
For example, to get a conical FSS structure, we need to do the first transform using 
the following formulas: 
 
x = cos((arctan((y-43.3)/x)+1.0455)/1.0455*π)*16.6389*sqrt(x*x+(y-43.3) 
*(y-43.3))/50 
 
y = sin((arctan((y-43.3)/x)+1.0455)/1.0455*π)*16.6389*sqrt(x*x+(y-43.3) 
*(y-43.3))/50 
 
z = (1-sqrt(x*x+(y-43.3)*(y-43.3))/50) 
The conical FSS structure is the desired shape in the z-direction. The second 
transform using the following formula will allow us to get the desired conical FSS 
pattern. 
   
x = x 
y = y 
z = z*47.15

PC Cluster Optimization   
 
 
As benefits from the MPI, OpenMP, and high-performance network devices, the 
parallel processing techniques [1, 2] have been applied in many software packages 
including 
most 
commercial 
electromagnetic 
software 
and 
home-grown 
electromagnetic simulation codes. However, there still exist two major challenging 
issues in the parallel processing applications. First, a user-friendly interface 
including the project design and data postprocessing through a Web browser is the 
most important, and we have to ensure the data and cluster security when the users 
can be access to the cluster through the Internet. Second, for the required 
performance, the cost should be reduced to an affordable level. Next, we use a 
simple example to demonstrate the performance of parallel conformal FDTD 
method on the different hardware platforms that are installed with different 
network systems, as shown in Table M.1.

For example, if we use DELL computers with the integrated or independent 
Gigabit network card and Gigabit Ethernet switch (http://www.dell.com), the 
performance of the parallel FDTD code is shown as the curve “Regular Gigabit 
Ethernet” in Figure M.1. If we select an ASUS computer (http://www.asus.com) 
installed with D-Link Gigabit network card and Ethernet (http://www.dlink.com), 
the performance of the parallel FDTD code is shown as the curve “Optimized 
Gigabit Ethernet” in Figure M.1. The InfiniBand network system gets much better 
performance when the number of nodes becomes larger. It is observed from Figure 
M.1 that we can reach only slightly less optimal performance than the InfiniBand 
network system using the optimized Gigabit Ethernet network system at a much 
lower cost. The acceleration factor in Figure M.1 is related to the performance of 
the parallel FDTD code on one quad core computer. For example, if the simulation 
time of the parallel FDTD code is 100 seconds on one computer and 50 seconds on 
two computers for the same problem, the acceleration factor of the parallel FDTD 
code on the computer cluster is 2.
