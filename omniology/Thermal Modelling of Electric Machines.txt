Abstract
ABSTRACT
This book focuses on the development of a thermal modeling with analytical models for the 
design of electrical machines. It concerns more particularly machine with permanent magnets. 
The methods used to determine the critical parameters of thermal modeling are presented first. 
We then present the complete thermal model that has been developed and confronted with 
experimental results. This model has very good accuracy and has allowed us to study the effect 
of different topological variations on the thermal behavior. It was also possible to analyze and 
compare different cooling strategies. This model can easily be integrated into an optimization 
process to determine the maximum permissible losses of a given configuration, or to define the 
cooling method to use. Based on the same principles, we proposed a new model to simulate the 
thermal exchanges between the conductors in the slots. This model allows us to appreciate the 
randomness of the arrangement of the conductors in the coil. It can be paired with a more 
comprehensive model of the machine in order to refine the resolution of the latter and ensure a 
more accurate analysis of the thermal behavior of the coils.

General Introduction
GENERAL INTRODUCTION
Permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSM) gain more and more importance for 
special drive applications. Up to recent years, PMSM were known for small drives, e.g. for 
servo applications. In the last years, PMSM are increasingly applied in several areas such 
as traction, automobiles, etc. Therefore, development of different machine types requires 
attention to the thermal aspects since, at the end; it is always the thermal constraints 
that will determine the power rating of the machine. To insure a successful design of the 
electrical machines, it is necessary to be able to predict an accurate temperature distribution 
in the most sensitive parts of the machine to prevent the damages that can occur either 
by breakdown of the stator winding insulation or by the demagnetization of the magnets. 
Knowledge of thermal behavior in different situations can prevent overheating, but can also 
improve the utilization of the system at normal operation.
As is known, different calculation methods can be used to analyses the thermal behavior of 
electrical machines: exact analytical calculation (“distributed loss model”), numerical analysis, 
and the lumped-parameter or nodal method (“concentrated loss model”). Compared with 
other methods, the lumped-parameter thermal method is simple and attractive which can 
give accurate representation of the thermal conditions within the machine. This method has 
been used for a long time by many authors for calculation of the temperature rises in electric 
machines, which solves the thermal problems by applying thermal networks in analogy to 
electrical circuits. Generally, the lumped-parameter thermal model is composed of thermal 
resistances, thermal capacitances and power losses inside the system. Such a model is based 
on the hypothesis that the system, under the thermal point of view, can be divided into 
several parts that are connected to each other by means of thermal resistors and capacitors. 
In the equivalent thermal network, all the heat generation in the component is concentrated 
in one point. This point represents the mean temperature of the component. In many 
literatures [1, 2], during calculation of thermal characteristics using the lumped-parameter 
method, as heat generators are taken the corresponding power losses in the components. 
In spite of being popular, generally this method is not applied correctly for elements with 
distributed heat generation. From the thermal analysis presented in [3,4] it is shown that 
solving the thermal problems with this method leads to wrong results if the total power 
losses are taken as heat sources in the thermal network (conventional lumped-parameter 
method). In the past, this systematic mistake was unknown, but intrinsically eliminated by 
the fitting procedure. Based on the analysis presented in [1, 2], the required change to the 
conventional lumped-parameter thermal method to omit this systematic mistake is simple, 
but decisive:

METHOD OF THE 
ELECTRIC MOTORS
1.1	
INTRODUCTION
The usage of electric drive systems in vehicles has undergone a rapid increase of popularity 
for some time now and is here to stay. One area where efforts are being directed at technical 
improvements is the bridge between the electrical and the thermodynamic aspects of electric 
machines. There are potential benefits to draw from knowing more about the behavior and 
the effects of the heat that is generated in the machine during operation.
It is of great importance to make sure that its temperature does not reach levels above what 
is tolerable, especially for sensitive parts such as permanent magnets and winding insulation. 
For machines used in environments where cooling is an especially challenging task, which 
is the case for electric vehicles, this understanding is perhaps of even greater importance.
1.2	
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
The thermal limits set the constraints of the machine. Go beyond them and you will 
decrease the life time of the machine. Do not go near them, and some of the potential 
of the machine is wasted. If the thermal constraints can be taken into account at an early 
stage in the optimisation process of the machine design, it is possible to achieve a more 
homogenous temperature distribution and avoid hot spots in the machine. The information 
could be useful for improving the overall design in terms of efficiency, torque/power density, 
overload time capability [5], and requirements on the cooling.
Having a good knowledge of the actual levels means being able to design without having 
to resort to unnecessary large safety margins, which are usually costly.
A number of existing publications describe different aspects of the thermal modelling of 
electric motors. On synchronous machines with interior magnets however, it has not been 
written much. Having a detailed model opens up for a lot of possible questions to be 
investigated. A closer investigation of the modelling of an IPMSM is of particular interest, 
as it is the type of electrical motor used in the new Electric Vehicle (EV).

The models should be parametric, and the parameters swept within reason- able intervals 
based on the uncertainty of and sensitivity to the parameter in question. From this data, 
the most relevant parameters should be identified, and thus criteria for thermal aspects of 
designing an electric drive can be formulated.
The model has been based on a PMSM machine situated at Chalmers, upon which thermal 
measurements will be carried out in the future. Since the model is parameterised, it is general 
enough to be applicable for investigating changes for a number of different motor designs.

THERMAL ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF 
ELECTRIC MACHINE
In high-performance applications such as hybrid electric vehicles and aerospace, there is a 
growing need for electric machines with high torque/power densities. A higher power density 
can be achieved by applying higher current densities to the electric machine windings and/or 
running the machine at higher speeds. A high current density in the stator winding results 
in significant copper losses and, in turn, high hot-spot temperatures [1, 2]. Also, high 
rotor speeds lead to higher current and voltage frequencies that increase the iron losses in 
the stator and rotor steel laminations and the permanent magnet segments in permanent 
magnet (PM) machines. The increase in copper and iron losses may, if the resulting heat is 
not properly dissipated, cause increased temperatures which may be particularly problematic 
in parts of the machine that are difficult to cool down (e.g. the rotor). 
From the beginning of the twentieth century, considerable efforts have been put on dealing 
with thermal issues of electric machines [3–6]. In this regard, a considerable amount of work 
has been carried out on the development of complex cooling systems that effectively extract 
losses from critical parts of the machine [7–9]. Forced air-cooling has been employed to 
enhance the heat transfer from the housing fins and often from the end winding and rotor 
surfaces [12, 13]. However, for high current densities, air-cooling may not be sufficient and 
some form of liquid cooling is required [11]. A housing water jacket enables an effective 
heat transfer from the active part of the stator winding to the coolant [14, 15].

However, water-cooling does not provide a successful cooling of the end windings which 
can be particularly problematic for machines with long end windings, e.g. in machines 
with low pole numbers. Instead of water, oil may also be used as a cooling medium and 
different oil cooling methods for electric machinery have been proposed [7, 14–15]. In 
directly-oil-cooled machines, oil is in direct contact with the inner parts of the machine and 
an effective cooling of both the stator and the end winding body can be realized. A variety 
of work has been done and published on improvements in the electromagnetic design of 
different kinds of electric machines to reduce losses, e.g. the iron losses in the stator and 
rotor laminations, and eddy current losses in the permanent magnets [13–19]. In order to 
improve the thermal behavior of electric machines, a good knowledge of heat transfer in 
different parts of the machine is required. Lumped parameter (LP) thermal analysis and 
numerical methods are the major approaches proposed to model thermal effects in electric 
machines [12].

THERMAL EFFECTS OF USING DIFFERENT 
IMPREGNATION MATERIALS
In this part, thermal effects of different materials used in electric machines are investigated. 
The materials considered are the impregnation material, filling the stator slots and the 
end winding bodies, and the steel laminations used to build the stator and rotor parts of 
the machine.
In addition to thermal conductivity, the thermal impact of different impregnation materials 
is also dependent on the quality of the impregnation process, the cooling conditions and 
the loss levels. A winding impregnation process with high quality results in less air pocket 
in the impregnation body and a higher rate of heat transfer [20]. Moreover, thermal effects 
of the impregnation material in machines operating under different cooling conditions and 
levels of loss production are not identical. In this section, first a comparison between the 
thermal, electrical and mechanical properties of the studied materials is presented and then 
thermal effects, considering the above mentioned parameters, are studied.
1.4.1	 LAWS GOVERNING MODES OF HEAT TRANSFER
Heat, by definition, is the energy in transit due to temperature difference. Whenever exists 
a temperature difference in a medium or between media, heat flow must. Different types 
of heat transfer processes are called modes. These modes are shown in Figure I.1. When a 
temperature gradient exists in a stationary medium, which may be a solid or a fluid, heat 
flows under the law of conduction heat transfer. On the other hand if the temperature 
gradient exists between a surface and a moving fluid we use the term Convection [20]. The 
third mode of heat transfer is termed Radiation and it needs no medium to transfer through 
since it is driven by electromagnetic waves emitted from all surfaces of finite temperature, 
so there is a net heat transfer by radiation between two surfaces at different temperatures.

1.4.1.1  Thermal conduction 
Conduction is the mechanism of heat transfer whereby energy is transported between parts 
of a continuum by the transfer of kinetic energy between particles or groups of particles at 
the atomic level [22]. We should conjure up the concept of atomic and molecular activity 
In gases, conduction is caused by elastic collision of molecules; consider a gas in which 
there exist a temperature gradient and assume there is no bulk motion. The gas may occupy 
the space between two surfaces which are maintained at different temperatures as shown in 
Figure I.2. We associate the temperature at any point with the energy of gas molecules in 
proximity to the point. This energy is related to the random translational motion as well as 
to the internal rotational and vibrational motions of the molecules. As shown in Figure I.3. 
The hypothetical plane at xo is constantly being crossed by molecules from above and 
below due to their random motion. However, molecules from above are associated with a 
larger temperature than those from below, causing net transfer of energy in the positive x 
direction. We may speak of the net transfer of energy by the random molecular motion as 
a diffusion of energy.

In liquids and electrically non conducting solids, it is believed to be caused by longitudinal 
oscillations of the lattice structure; it is called also lattice waves. Thermal conduction in 
metals occurs, like electrical conduction, through the motion of free electrons. Thermal energy 
transfer occurs in the direction of decreasing temperature, a consequence of the second law of 
thermodynamics. In solid opaque bodies, thermal conduction is the significant heat transfer 
mechanism because no net material flows in the process [23]. With flowing fluids, thermal 
conduction dominates in the region very close to a solid boundary, where the flow is laminar 
and parallel to the surface and where there is no eddy motion. Examples of conduction heat 
transfer are tremendous. On a summer day there is a significant energy gain from outside 
air to a room. This gain is principally due to conduction heat transfer through the wall 
that separates room air from outside air. Also in electronics cooling process conduction is 
a heat transfer mechanism used in every electronics design. Even if a system is designed 
for convection cooling of the circuit boards, conduction is still the dominant heat transfer 
mechanism within the component devices and on the circuit board. This is especially true 
for power electronics, where concentrations of heat are developed in. components such as 
power silicon and magnetic. This heat must be transferred via conduction to the component 
case, the circuit board or a heat sink before it can be handled by the systemlevel cooling 
mechanism(s). Consequently, all electronics designers must be aware with the techniques 
of thermal conduction and its analysis.

It is possible to quantify heat transfer processes in terms of appropriate rate equations. 
These equations may be used to compute the amount of energy being transferred per unit 
time. For heat conduction, the rate equation is known as Fourier’s law. Fourier’s law is a 
phenomenological; that is developed from observed phenomena rather than being derived 
from first principles. The general rate equation is based on much experimental evidence. 
For the one dimensional plane wall shown in Figure I.4 having a temperature distribution 
T(x), the rate equation is expressed as The heat flux q" (W/m2) is the heat transfer rate in 
the x direction per unit area perpendicular to the direction of transfer, and it is proportional 
to the temperature gradient, dT/dx, in this direction. The proportionality constant k is a 
transport property known as the thermal conductivity (W/m. K) and is a characteristic of 
the wall material. The minus sign is a consequence of the fact that heat is transferred in 
the direction of decreasing temperature.

1.4.1.2  Thermal Convection
This mode of heat transfer involves energy transfer by fluid movement and molecular 
diffusion. Consider heat transfer to a fluid flowing over flat plate as in Figure I.5.
If the Reynolds number is large enough, three different flow regions exist. Immediately 
adjacent to the wall is a laminar sublayer where heat transfer occurs by thermal conduction; 
outside the laminar sublayer is a transition region called the buffer layer, where both eddy 
mixing and conduction effects are significant; beyond the buffer layer is the turbulent region, 
where the dominant mechanism of transfer is eddy mixing.

Figure I.5. Thermal Convection
Convection heat transfer may be classified according to the nature of the flow for free 
or natural convection the flow is induced by buoyancy forces, which arise from density 
differences caused by temperature variations in the fluid. An example is the free convection 
heat transfer that occurs from hot components on a vertical array of circuit boards in still 
air as shown in Figure I.6. Air that makes contact with the components experiences an 
increase in temperature so that the density is reduced. For a forced convection; the flow is 
caused by external means, such a fan, a pump, or atmospheric winds. An example of which 
is the use of a fan to provide forced convection air cooling of hot electrical components on 
printed circuit boards as shown in Figure I.6.

1.4.2	 THERMAL BEHAVIOR OF MATERIALS
As noted previously, thermal conductivity is a thermodynamic property of a material. From 
the State Postulate given in thermodynamics, it may be recalled that thermodynamic properties of 
pure substances are functions of two independent thermodynamic intensive properties, say 
temperature and pressure. Thermal conductivity of real gases is largely independent of pressure and 
may be considered a function of temperature alone. For solids and liquids, properties are 
largely independent of pressure and depend on temperature alone.

Thermal Characterization Method of the Electric Motors

In rotating machinery, changes in the thermal properties of the materials used are low and 
very little influence the final result. Here it is assumed that the thermal conductivity, density 
and heat capacity are constant.2
1.4.3	 ELECTROMAGNETIC AND THERMAL PHENOMENA
While electromagnetic-thermal interaction plays a crucial role in the operation of electrical 
machines, it is often avoided to perform such coupled simulation, due to the complex 
modeling challenges and the computational cost of the problem. In most cases the thermal 
and electromagnetic domains can be separated in the simulation easily and in a straightforward 
manner as the electromagnetic phenomena is typically much faster than the thermal. Thermal 
effects are usually modeled as a “boundary condition” for the electromagnetic domain and 
temperatures of dependent components (e.g.: those effecting the conductivity) are updated 
only after modeling several electrical periods, or several seconds of operation, or even several 
minutes or hours. This approach is a popular and reasonable one for most electrical machine 
problems also.

Thermal Characterization Method of the Electric Motors
There are however a few problem types where the thermal effect could have a more direct  
and quicker impact on the electro-magnetic behaviour of the system, e.g.: like the case of 
direct online synchronous machine start up transients. Synchronous motors with starting 
capabilities often experience large thermal stress in a short period of time – especially in 
the damper bars – during starting. 
In the followings, different approaches for the simulation of synchronous motor start up 
phenomena with electromagnetic thermal coupling is presented and discussed. Starting from a 
simple 2D model [1] and finishing with 3D directly coupled electromagnetic thermal model 
[2], the benefits and difficulties of the approaches are discussed and results are presented.
1.5	
THERMAL MODELING OF ELECTRICAL MACHINERY
In high-performance applications such as hybrid electric vehicles and aerospace, there is a 
growing need for electric machines with high torque/power densities. A higher power density 
can be achieved by applying higher current densities to the electric machine windings and/or 
running the machine at higher speeds. A high current density in the stator winding results 
in significant copper losses and, in turn, high hot-spot temperatures [1, 2]. Also, high 
rotor speeds lead to higher current and voltage frequencies that increase the iron losses in 
the stator and rotor steel laminations and the permanent magnet segments in permanent 
magnet (PM) machines. The increase in copper and iron losses may, if the resulting heat is 
not properly dissipated, cause increased temperatures which may be particularly problematic 
in parts of the machine that are difficult to cool down (e.g. the rotor).
From the beginning of the twentieth century, considerable efforts have been put on dealing 
with thermal issues of electric machines [3–6]. In this regard, a considerable amount of work 
has been carried out on the development of complex cooling systems that effectively extract 
losses from critical parts of the machine [7–11]. Forced air cooling has been employed to 
enhance the heat transfer from the housing fins and often also from the end winding and 
rotor surfaces [12, 13].
However, for high current densities, air cooling may not be sufficient and some form of 
liquid cooling is required [11]. A housing water jacket enables an effective heat transfer 
from the active part of the stator winding to the coolant [14, 15].

Thermal Characterization Method of the Electric Motors
However, water cooling does not provide a successful cooling of the end windings which 
can be particularly problematic for machines with long end windings, e.g. in machines with 
low pole numbers. Instead of water, oil may also be used as a cooling medium and different 
oil cooling methods for electric machinery have been proposed [7, 16–18]. In directly-oil-
cooled machines, oil is in direct contact with the inner parts of the machine and an effective 
cooling of both the stator and the end winding body can be realized.
A variety of work has been done and published on improvements in the electromagnetic 
design of different kinds of electric machines to reduce losses, e.g. the iron losses in the 
stator and rotor laminations, and eddy current losses in the permanent magnets [19–22].
In order to improve the thermal behavior of electric machines, a good knowledge of heat 
transfer in different parts of the machine is required. Lumped parameter (LP) thermal 
analysis and numerical methods are the major approaches proposed to model thermal effects 
in electric machines [23].
1.5.1	 THERMAL MODELING OF ELECTRIC MACHINES: NUMERICAL METHODS
Finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are commonly used 
numerical methods for thermal analysis of electric machines [23]. In a thermal finite element 
(FE) model, conduction in solid elements with specified conductivities can be modeled 
accurately but convection and radiation must be approximated with boundary conditions 
based on empirical correlations [12, 23]. Therefore, FEA can provide a fairly accurate picture 
of temperature distribution in complex solid parts of the electric machine, e.g. the winding, 
provided the boundary conditions are introduced accurately. The thermal FE model of the 
stationary part of a sample electric machine, implemented using the software JMAG3, is 
shown in Figure I.7.

As can be seen, the solid elements including the stator steel laminations (grey), conductors 
(yellow), liner (dark blue), impregnation (light blue) and end winding ring (green) are 
implemented in the FE software and convective heat transfers are modeled using the 
boundary conditions.
CFD analysis can be used to accurately model convective heat transfer and also fluid flows 
of the coolant in the electric machines equipped with different kinds of cooling systems 
[24, 25]. However, implementing and solving CFD and/or thermal FE models of electric 
machines can be very time-consuming [24, 26]. Therefore, using these numerical methods 
for example in design optimization procedures, where many design iterations are commonly 
required, is not recommended.
1.5.2	 THERMAL MODELING OF ELECTRIC MACHINES: ANALYTICAL APPROACHES
From the time that thermal issues of electric machines first raised, engineers have tried to 
develop analytical methods to estimate the temperature distribution in electric machinery 
[24, 25]. An early attempt made to implement a functioning analytical thermal model to 
predict the temperatures in different parts of an electric machine is presented in [26, 27] 
where a simple thermal network is developed for totally enclosed non-ventilated induction 
motors. Following this work, the thermal model of a totally enclosed fan cooled electric 
machine was developed and tested by Mellor et al. on a medium (75 kW) and two small 
size (5.5 kW) induction machines [18].
1.5.2.1  Analogy between Heat Transfer and Electric Circuits
There exists an analogy between the diffusion of heat and electrical charge. Just as an 
electrical resistance is associated with the conduction of electricity, a thermal resistance 
may be associated with the conduction of heat. Defining resistance as the ratio of a driving 
potential to the corresponding transfer rate, it follows from Figure 3.4 that the thermal 
resistance for conduction is:

Figure I.8. Series circuits
Figure I.8 shows a plane wall subjected at its end to convective heat transfer. So in this 
case the heat is first transferred from the hot fluid to the wall surface by convection, then 
through the wall by conduction, and finally by convection from the second wall surface to 
the cold fluid. Here the heat quantity in each phase is the same so as current flowing in a 
series of electric resistances. Then from this analogy we may conclue thar:

Most of the practical cases under investigations, heat is transferred by more than one mode; 
as for examples heat may be transferred by combined convection and radiation, combined 
convection and conduction, etc.

Since these two modes of heat transfer are completely independent, there would be no

This hypothetical approach seems to be similar to the parallel electrical resistances as shown 
previously, but the problem here is that no radiation resistance has been defined yet. So 
let us use a radiant heat transfer in order to express the radiation heat transfer, q rad, as 
a linear function in the temperature difference between the surface temperature and the 
fluid temperature.

CONCLUSION
In this chapter, thermal effects of using different winding impregnation materials and steel 
lamination qualities were evaluated. Two commonly used impregnation materials were first 
compared with a silicone based thermally conductive impregnation material. Significant 
reductions in the hot-spot temperature of winding were achieved which is promising for 
thermal management of electric machines and also the resulting efficiency particularly in 
high-performance applications.
Electromagnetic – thermal coupling in the simulation of electrical machines is a very 
important research topic with strong academic and industrial interests. The simulation of 
the direct online starting of a synchronous machine provides a great basis of comparison 
for different computation methods. The 2D electromagnetic analysis with averaged thermal 
model is faster than the 3D Electromagnetic Thermal simulation it cannot provide the detail 
of possible hot spots.
After analyzing the possible methods, we used the nodal method that fits well with our 
approach. To validate this approach we propose to establish the equivalent thermal diagram 
of the actuator. We thus end up in chapter three a pattern consisting of some capacitive 
and resistive elements can be determined by calculation. 
The next chapter is devoted to the implementation of the model and the identification of 
these parameters and the simulation of the thermal behavior of the actuator.

INTRODUCTION
Electrical machines are very sensitive to temperature increase of the parts which are especially 
due to the fragility of their windings [1], [2]. This heating can cause deterioration and the 
changing characteristics of electrical, magnetic, and mechanical drive system. It is necessary 
to correctly determine the temperature of the different parts that constitute them. Although 
all electric machines are the exposed to heat losses [3], those supplied by a static converter 
deserve special attention. Indeed, recent developments in power electronics and automation 
as well as the increase in computing power industrial computing systems allow the design 
of electromechanical actuators which are highly specialized engines strained.

The losses in the machine then increase due to the injection of current harmonics and the 
temperature rises even more than during normal operation. In this context, a study of the 
thermal behavior of the motor permanent magnets is useful to fight against the problems 
already mentioned, and to take into account its influence on the design and control system 
of traction.
This article tries to solve the issue of development of tools for modeling and simulating 
the behavior of electro thermal actuator permanent magnet axial flux (PMAF) devoted to 
electrical attraction.
Our objective requires the development of models for the various components used in the 
actuator: coil, rotor, stator…etc. The models developed must allow wind to account for the 
electrical behavior but also the thermal behavior of components. 
2.2	
OBJECTIVE
The main objective of modeling electro thermal is to respect the thermal constraints related 
to the functioning of PMSMAF. In fact, the exceeding of the melting temperature of the 
insulation of the coils is set at 90°C leads to the deterioration of the coils and subsequently to 
the damage the motor. In addition to that knowledge of the temperatures in different active 
areas of the engine allows at first to take into account the change of the BH characteristic 
of the magnets (critical temperature is not to exceed 60°C), and the variation of resistance 
of MSAPFA phases, strongly influencing the electrical, magnetic and mechanical behavior 
of the engine. This knowledge of temperatures determines the nature and power of the 
cooling system to be integrate to PMSMA Fin order to stabilize the operation of the engine 
in optimum speed.
We set a goal not to exceed the limits of the following temperatures:
-- 60°C for the permanent magnets.
-- 70°C for the insulation of the coils. 
Under these conditions, a model (Figure II.1) will assess from the losses temperature with 
an accuracy of a few degrees Celsius.

CHOICE OF MODELING METHOD
The conventional analytical methods allow the description of heat transfer with acceptable 
complexity. However these methods require precise knowledge of many coefficients (thermal 
conductivity, heat transfer coefficient, and emissivity) which is often difficult to obtain.
Methods of finite elements require memory resources and computation time that are not 
compatible with our approaches which have to allow the modeling of a magnetic component 
in its environment that is integrated into a power line. Moreover, the models developed 
should make account of all the phenomena involved in the magnetic component (electrical, 
magnetic and thermal phenomena).

THERMAL MODELING OF A PERMANENT MAGNET 
SYNCHRONOUS MACHINE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE
The nodal method provides the best accuracy of results and simulation time [25–27]. 
It is therefore compatible with optimization approaches such as performance of electric 
vehicles. However, it seems best suited to our concerns and to our experimental approach. 
The component model is divided into zones connected by insulated thermal resistance, the 
center of an area is called a node. A thermal capacity and a heat source associated with each 
zone. A system of differential equations is obtained by writing the heat balance at different 
nodes. A first approximation is to consider the thermal resistances as constants (for better 
precision thermal resistances can be modeled using analytical relations).
For the components of our synchronous motor, the equivalent circuit can be summed up 
in a few resistors and capacitors whose values ​can be obtained by calculation.
2.5	
MOTOR THERMAL MODEL
Thermal modeling of electrical machines is a crucial issue, and many studies have been 
devoted [8]. Several approaches are used to describe the heat transfer and to achieve a 
satisfactory estimate of operating temperatures. Some approaches lead to a detailed mapping 
of temperature calculated in all points of the component, others may provide only the 
calculated temperature at some points of the component.
2.5.1	 ASSUMPTIONS USED IN MODELING
We first recall our assumptions about the thermal modeling of magnetic components to justify 
the principles of adopted measures that lead to the measurement of average temperatures. 
Temperatures are assumed to be uniform in the material and in the different coils [29]. 
We consider an ambient temperature of 27°C and we assume a maximum warm-up the 
allowable to 70°C for the stator winding and insulation. This heating is determined by the 
temperature resistance of conductors and insulators bottom notches. Similarly, the maximum 
heating of the magnets (Sm-Co) must be taken into account and we assume a temperature 
rise of about 60°C.
The heat exchange is assumed to be in the axial direction as the length of the structure in 
this direction is much lower than that in the radial direction, moreover, the heat exchange 
sections perpendicular to the axis of the motor, is much greater than those radials [9].
We, also, assume that the heat flux (iron losses) propagates the center of gravity of the head 
and the stator teeth as for the stator coils (Joule losses) in the axial direction [31].

The thermal model will be set up to represent as closely as possible and simply the active 
parts of the machine (stator windings, stator and rotor magnetic circuits) and the links 
between them and with the outside. The thin elements such as insulation sheets will be 
represented by simple thermal resistance.
2.5.4	 TRANSIENT THERMAL MODEL
We used a modeling using thermal-electrical analogy. The machine is divided into volume 
elements exchanging heat between them by conduction or convection. The calculated Joule 
losses include losses of Joule slots and winding heads. The iron losses are localized at the 
center of gravity of the head and of the stator teeth. 
The thermal model of the PMSMAF transient structure can be represented by a similar 
electricity network, as described in figure II.6.

We assign the center of gravity of each area as well as a node power sources Pj, Pfc and Pfd 
corresponding total Joule losses in the coils and iron losses of the stator yoke and teeth. 
The variables correspond to the temperatures Ti at the different points of the machine. The 
expressions of the thermal resistances are deduced from the resolution of the equation of 
the heat-border areas.
2.5.5	 CALCULATING CONDUCTION RESISTANCES 
For the sake of simplification, the conduction along the transverse axis of the stator is not 
taken although it may be crucial in the windings in particular. Heat transfer in a stator 
element therefore allows one preferred direction, the axial direction. 
This is reflected by the following heat equation [30].

SIMULATIONS RESULTS 
2.6.1	 MODEL SIMULATION WITHOUT COOLING FINS
The simulation is based on the model established from a preliminary analysis. The analysis 
and study of the system components, modeling and simulation are the three basic steps of 
our approach to evaluate the heat transfer in the actuator. 
The thermal model developed for the various components of the motor is important 
implemented MATLAB SIMULINK to estimate the temperatures of the materials.
The simulation of the thermal model of the PMSMAF structure with natural ventilation 
(convection coefficient equal to 30W.K-1.m) and for operation at steady speed of 80 km/h, 
shows the evolution of temperatures in the different active parts of the motor (Figure II.7).

This figure shows that there’s an overshoot of 47°C for copper and resin, which proves 
the need for a cooling system. Several simulations are run for several values of convection 
coefficient for a system of forced ventilation cooling system, led to the establishment of 
this coefficient at 300 WK-1.m. 
Changes in temperature in the different active parts of the engine for operation with a 
cooling system with forced ventilation of the convection coefficient h = 300WK-1.m is 
illustrated in Figure II.8.

us to consider setting out another cooling system.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

CONCLUSION
Our objective modeling components PMSMAF require the development of comprehensive 
models capable of taking into account with the same degree of approximation magnetic, 
electrical and thermal phenomena. Given these objectives, we have established a set of 
specifications on the thermal model. This allows to calculate with perecision of few degrees 
the operating temperature of the component (temperature of the magnetic material and 
temperature of the windings). The simplicity of therequired pattern is an essential criterion 
of choice.
And we arrive at a model consisting of some capacitive and resistive elements, the calculation 
of thermal resistance used to characterize the different heat exchanges within the various 
components of the thermal model.
Temperature measurements are obtained by simulation in MATLAB. SIMULINK, results 
have shown the need to consider a system of cooling. The operation of the latter provided 
protection engine running on missions urban traffic data type.

General conclusion
GENERAL CONCLUSION
Permanent Magnet Motors are popular choices for electric vehicle powertrain applications. The 
effects of the excessive heat in the magnets can degrade the performance of these machines 
if not dealt properly. It is therefore critical to develop a complete and representative model 
of the heat processes in the electric motors. In this book, a simplified analytical model is 
developed as a thermal circuit with a network of interconnected nodes and thermal resistances 
representing the heat processes within the PMSM. Both losses induced by sinusoidal and 
PWM waveform voltage supplies are calculated respectively as heat sources in the thermal 
circuit. Because temperature-rise inside the magnets caused by eddy current loss can lead 
to the unpredictable deterioration of the magnets, the circuit takes into consideration the 
eddy current loss developed in the permanent magnets. The thermal circuit is then solved 
in MATLAB through a system of linear equations. The results of the analytical model are 
confirmed through 1-D finite element analysis simulation in software.
The thermal analysis of permanent magnet synchronous motor is presented. The lumped circuit 
approach is employed in this investigation. The proposed model is compatible with circuit 
simulators Simulations by MATLAB SIMULINK software performed in order to study the 
variations of the temperature at any part of the motor, according to the copper losses and 
the iron losses injected in the motor and the boundary conditions at the cooling systems.
