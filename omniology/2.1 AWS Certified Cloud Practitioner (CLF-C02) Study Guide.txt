● Benefits of Cloud Computing 
o Cloud Computing 
▪ 
Technology that allows for the delivery of computing resources, such as 
servers, storage, and software, over the Internet 
o According to the National institute of Standards and Technology (or NIST) in their 
Special Publication 800-145 entitled “The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing”, 
there are five key benefits or features of cloud computing 
▪ 
On-demand Self-service 
● Key characteristic of cloud computing that enables users to 
quickly and easily provision computing resources as needed, 
without the need for human interaction 
● On-demand self-service provides more agility and flexibility by 
giving the ability to quickly scale up or down 
● Also provides the ability to control the resources by allowing users 
to easily provision additional resources 
▪ 
Broad Network Access 
● Allows users to access cloud computing resources from anywhere 
with an Internet connection 
● The increased mobility also allows organizations to change their 
business models from a purely in-person model to a hybrid or 
remote work capable organization 
● Data can be accessed from anywhere which means the businesses 
can maintain operations at all times 
▪ 
Resource Pooling 
● Enables cloud providers to dynamically allocate and reallocate 
resources, such as servers and storage, as needed 
● This leads to increased cost savings, more efficiency, improved 
scalability, better disaster recovery, and additional flexibility for 
the operations 
● This resource pooling also allows for better performance and 
faster service delivery 
▪ 
Rapid Elasticity 
● Enables resources to quickly and easily scale up or down in 
response to changes in demand 
● With traditional IT environments, businesses often have to plan 
ahead and make large upfront investments in infrastructure 
● This can be especially beneficial for businesses that experience 
seasonal fluctuations in demand

https://www.DionTraining.com 
▪ 
Measured Service 
● Allows cloud providers to track and bill users for the resources 
they consume, based on usage 
● Measured service in cloud computing provides businesses with 
the ability to better track, manage, and optimize their resource 
usage 
● Businesses can optimize their resource usage patterns to ensure 
efficient and cost-effective utilization 
 
● Cloud Service Models 
o Cloud Service Models 
▪ 
Determine the level of control, flexibility, and management required 
from the user’s side 
o 4 Cloud Service Models 
▪ 
Software as a Service (SaaS) 
● The service provider is going to give the organization a complete 
solution, including the hardware, as well as the operating system, 
the middleware, the runtime, the data processing, and the 
application or software that's needed for the service to be 
delivered to your end user 
▪ 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 
● The service provider is going to give the organization the 
hardware that is needed, including networking, storage, and 
servers, but they're not going to provide any of the software 
▪ 
Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
● The service provider will provide only the hardware, including the 
networking, storage, servers and virtualization, as well as the 
operating system, middleware, and runtime applications 
▪ 
Function as a Service (FaaS) 
● The service provider handles all of the infrastructure, including 
servers, networking, and storage 
● With FaaS, there is no need to set up or manage servers, 
configure networks, or handle any of the other infrastructure 
concerns 
● With function as a service, you get to focus entirely on your 
application logic, while the service provider handles everything 
else 

   
 
 
AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner 
(CLF-C02) (Study Notes)

https://www.DionTraining.com 
● A great example of a function as a service solution is the AWS 
Lambda service 
• AWS Lambda create functions in a variety of programming 
languages, deploy them, and then set up triggers such as 
API Gateway endpoints, S3 bucket events, or DynamoDB 
stream events 
 
● Service Model Selection 
o 3 Main Service Models 
▪ 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 
● Provides organizations with access to virtualized computing 
resources, such as servers, storage, and networking 
● IaaS is a cost-effective way for organizations to access computing 
resources, and it offers scalability and flexibility 
▪ 
Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
● Builds on top of IaaS and provides organizations with a platform 
for developing, testing, and deploying applications 
● PaaS is a cost-effective way for organizations to develop and 
deploy applications, and it offers scalability and flexibility 
▪ 
Software as a Service (SaaS) 
● The most advanced of the three service models and provides 
organizations with access to software applications that can be 
accessed over the Internet 
● SaaS is a cost-effective way for organizations to access software 
applications, and it offers scalability and flexibility 
o When selecting a service model, organizations should consider their specific 
needs, such as scalability, security, and cost 
o Service model selection is not a one-time decision and it can be changed as per 
the organization's needs 
 
● Deployment Models 
o Each model has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the right 
model for an organization will depend on its specific needs and requirements 
o 6 Types of Cloud Deployment Models 
▪ 
Public 
● A third-party service provider makes resources available to the 
end users over the Internet

● There are numerous public cloud solutions available today 
including those from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and 
the Google Cloud Platform 
● Public clouds can often be an inexpensive way for an organization 
to gain a required service quickly and efficiently 
● Several advantages of public clouds 
• Lower costs 
• Ability to scale resources quickly and easily 
● Public clouds can be less secure than private clouds 
▪ 
Private 
● Cloud computing environment that is dedicated to a single 
organization that the infrastructure, resources, and data are all 
exclusively used by that organization 
● With a private cloud, the organization is responsible for the 
design, implementation, and operation of the cloud resources and 
the servers that host them 
● AWS also offers Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for users who want 
the scalability of the cloud while maintaining a private, isolated 
environment 
● The advantages of private clouds include 
• Increased security and compliance 
• Greater control over the infrastructure and resources 
▪ 
Hybrid 
● Combines the benefits of both the public cloud and the private 
cloud options 
● Strict rules should be applied for what type of data is hosted in 
each portion of the hybrid cloud 
● Hybrid clouds have several advantages 
• Increased security and compliance 
• Scale resources quickly and easily 
● Hybrid clouds can be complex to set up and maintain, and 
organizations may need to invest in additional resources such as 
hardware and staff 
● This model offers the flexibility of the public cloud with the 
control and security of a private cloud 
▪ 
Community 
● Cloud computing environment that is shared by a group of 
organizations with similar requirements 

   
 
 
AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

https://www.DionTraining.com 
● The resources and costs are shared among several different 
organizations who have common service needs 
● AWS GovCloud is a specialized region designed to host sensitive 
data and regulated workloads in the cloud, meeting U.S. 
government compliance requirements 
● Community clouds have several advantages 
• Increased security and compliance 
• Ability to share resources and costs among the community 
● The security challenge here is that each organization may have 
their own security controls 
▪ 
Multi-tenancy 
● Under this model, the same resources are used by multiple 
organizations 
● When two or more organizations share the same resources, there 
are some security concerns 
▪ 
Single tenancy 
● Under this model, a single organization is assigned to a particular 
resource 
● Single tendency is much less efficient than multi-tendency, and it 
is also more expensive because it requires more hardware to run 
properly 
 
● Deployment Model Selection 
o The choice of model significantly influences the cost, control, scalability, and 
security of applications and services 
o On-premise Deployment 
▪ 
Involves hosting applications and data on the infrastructure located 
within the organization's premises 
▪ 
It requires significant upfront capital investment and ongoing 
maintenance costs 
▪ 
Private cloud deployment model is usually paired with an on-premise 
deployment solution 
o Cloud Deployment 
▪ 
Involves hosting applications and data on a cloud platform 
▪ 
Public cloud deployment is also referred to as a cloud deployment 
o Hybrid Deployment 
▪ 
Combines on-premises and cloud-based infrastructures into one 
deployment model

https://www.DionTraining.com 
▪ 
If an organization has substantial on-premise infrastructure but wants to 
leverage the benefits of the cloud, a hybrid model could be a good fit 
o Multi-cloud Deployment 
▪ 
Involves using more than one cloud service from different providers 
▪ 
Organizations that are seeking to avoid vendor lock-in or to meet specific 
geographic or service requirements may opt for a multi-cloud approach 
o Remember, the choice of deployment model depends on various factors 
▪ 
Business needs 
▪ 
Budget 
▪ 
Compliance requirements 
▪ 
Technical capabilities 
o The key to successful deployment model selection is aligning the model with 
your organization's strategic objectives and operational needs 
 
● Shared Responsibility Model 
o Shared Responsibility Model 
▪ 
Framework used in cloud computing to define the roles and 
responsibilities of the cloud service provider and the customer when it 
comes to security and compliance in the cloud 
▪ 
Cloud Service Provider 
● Responsible for the security of the cloud itself 
▪ 
Customer 
● Responsible for the security of their own data and applications 
o Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
▪ 
Cloud service provider that provides a variety of cloud services, including 
storage, computing power, and databases 
▪ 
Customer is responsible for securing their own data and applications 
▪ 
AWS is responsible for the security of the underlying infrastructure 
● Network security 
● Physical security of the data centers 
● Security of the virtualization layer 
▪ 
As Amazon Web Services puts it, the customer is responsible for security 
“in” the cloud, while AWS is responsible for the security “of” the cloud 
▪ 
AWS must manage the security of the cloud, ensuring the robustness and 
reliability of the provided infrastructure 
 
 

   
 
 
AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner 
(CLF-C02) (Study Notes)

https://www.DionTraining.com 
o Customers are responsible for the security of their usage of the AWS Cloud 
services 
▪ 
Customers need to handle aspects like 
● Client and endpoint protection 
● Encryption of data at rest and in transit 
● Network traffic protection 
● Managing access control to AWS resources 
o For services that are more abstracted, such as Amazon's S3 and DynamoDB, AWS 
manages the infrastructure layer, the operating system, and the platform 
o There are also some shared responsibilities between AWS and the customer 
o The division of responsibilities can shift depending on the AWS service used 
o Customers retain responsibility for the security of their applications and data 
o The shared responsibility model can also help to reduce the overall cost of 
security 
o Some disadvantages of the shared responsibility model 
▪ 
It can be difficult for customers to fully understand their responsibilities 
and to properly secure their own data and applications 
▪ 
It can create confusion or ambiguity about who is responsible for specific 
security tasks 
o The shared responsibility model can be an effective way of ensuring that both 
the cloud service provider and the customer are taking the necessary steps to 
secure their respective parts of the cloud environment

● Fixed vs Variable Costs 
o There are two main categories of expense 
▪ 
Fixed Expenses 
● Costs that remain constant over a given period, regardless of the 
level of usage or production 
▪ 
Variable Expenses 
● Costs that change based on usage or production levels 
o Return on Investment (ROI) 
▪ 
Calculated by subtracting the total cost of the project from the total 
benefits and dividing the result by the total cost of the project 
o Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) 
▪ 
Takes into account both fixed and variable costs and ongoing costs 
associated with maintaining and supporting the project 
o Process Transformation 
▪ 
Allows businesses to streamline and automate business processes 
o Business Transformation 
▪ 
Allows businesses to create new revenue streams and business models 
o Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) 
▪ 
Expenses incurred by a company for the acquisition of long-term assets, 
(land, buildings, equipment, and technology) 
▪ 
CAPEX is used to improve the company's operations and grow its 
business

is allowed to enter for free 
o Outgoing Data Transfer 
▪ 
The transfer of data from an AWS service to a destination that could be 
located on-premise or in another AWS service 
▪ 
AWS charges for outgoing data transfer on a tiered basis which means 
that the cost actually goes down as your usage increases 
▪ 
Conducting an outbound data transfer between two AWS services in the 
same region and the same availability zone is considered non-chargeable 
▪ 
These cross-availability zone data transfers are charged at the lowest 
level of any outbound data transfer type 
o Inter-region Data Transfer 
▪ 
Transferring data between two different AWS regions, and this would be 
a chargeable event 
▪ 
It's important to consider these costs when designing an AWS 
architecture, especially if the application involves significant data transfer 
between regions 
o While all incoming data transfers are free, costs can be incurred for outgoing 
data transfers 
o Free outbound data transfer between two AWS services hosted within the same 
region and the same availability zone 
 
● Storage Options and Tiers 
o Some of the different storage options available within Amazon Web Services

attempts to break into the root user's account 
▪ 
Use the AWS CloudTrail tool to monitor and log account activity 
▪ 
Use the principles of least privilege when creating the cloud-based 
architectures 
● Least Privilege 
• Computer security concept where a user is provided the 
minimum levels of access necessary to perform their job 
functions 
o The root user is the only user who has the ability to terminate and close the AWS 
account on behalf of the organization 
o The root user is also the only user who can create, view, or delete CloudFront 
key pairs 
o The root user is the only one who can delete a service-linked role if the linked 
service allows it 
o Due to the extensive access provided to the root user account, it is imperative to 
safeguard the root user

● Users and Groups 
o User and group management is primarily handled through the AWS Identity and 
Access Management service 
o Identity and Access Management (IAM) Service 
▪ 
Allows to create and manage AWS users and groups and use permissions 
to allow and deny their access to AWS resources and to enforce the 
principle of least privilege 
▪ 
A user in AWS consists of a name, a password and up to two access keys 
▪ 
When you create an IAM user, the user is not granted permission to 
access AWS resources by default 
o IAM Group 
▪ 
An IAM group is simply a collection of IAM users 
o When a user is added to a group, the user automatically is assigned the 
permissions that are attached to that group 
o Always apply the principle of least privilege when working with permissions and 
access rights in IAM 
o Best practices to consider when working with users and groups 
▪ 
Always create individual IAM users for each person who needs to use the 
AWS services and applications 
▪ 
Assign permissions to groups whenever possible 
▪ 
Always use the principle of least privilege 
▪ 
Use conditions for fine-grained control of the user's permissions 
▪ 
Regularly review and rotate credentials 
o IAM users can be assigned to multiple groups, and each group can contain 
multiple users 
 
● Policies 
o IAM Policies 
▪ 
Documents that act as a formal set of permissions to define who has 
what kind of access to each specific resource in AWS 
▪ 
IAM policy is written in JSON format 
● JSON (Javascript Object Notation) 
• Specially formatted text file that contains key-value pairs 
that specify what permissions are being provided 
o Policies are attached to IAM identities, which could be a user, group, or role 
o IAM policies play an important role in implementing the principle of least 
privilege

Authorization: IAM determines what actions or resources the 
authenticated entity is allowed to access and interact with 
o To configure identity and access management in the cloud, use the AWS Identity 
and Access Management service 
o In addition to setting up users for each individual service, you can also perform 
federation for your users and their permissions 
▪ 
Enable identity federation to allow existing identities in the enterprise to 
access the AWS Management Console, call AWS APIs, and access 
resources 
o You can also create a larger federation in AWS by linking to a non-AWS directory, 
like your company's own Active Directory on its Windows servers, to your own 
AWS services in the cloud 
o AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the backbone of security and 
access control within the AWS environment

and from a router such as those used in sharing information and 
building routing tables 
▪ 
Data Plane 
● Used to carry user traffic on the network 
● It's the data plane that's actually moving the data around the 
network 
▪ 
Management Plane 
● Used to administer the routers and switches inside of the network 
o In a traditional or conventional network, these different planes all exist in a 
physical piece of hardware 
o With SDN, these functions are incorporated into a virtualized device or 
decoupled device that focuses on a single plane’s functions at a time using APIs 
provided by the vendors to communicate between these three planes 
o Using an SDN has some advantages over conventional networks, such as having 
the ability to mix and match products from different vendors 
o SDN also provide organizations with increased choices in their network 
development 
o The best benefit of an SDN is that it can allow for fully automated deployment of 
a network within the cloud 
o Losing connectivity to the SDN controller could cause the entire network to go 
down 
o The use of a centralized controller in SDNs creates a real target for attackers to 
focus on

Security Capabilities 
 
● Security Groups 
o Security Groups 
▪ 
Function as virtual firewalls designed specifically to protect EC2 instances 
o If you are familiar with firewalls in a traditional computer network, you probably 
know that there are two basics types 
▪ 
Host-based Firewall 
● Installed on individual servers or devices and controls incoming 
and outgoing network traffic specific to that machine, based on a 
set of configured rules 
▪ 
Network-based Firewall 
● Positioned at a strategic point within a network, usually at the 
boundary between internal and external networks, and it controls 
traffic entering or leaving the entire network 
o In the AWS cloud, security groups act as a host-based firewall for EC2 instances 
o Security groups function on the principle of rules 
▪ 
These rules dictate which traffic can enter or leave a particular EC2 
instance 
▪ 
2 Types of Rules 
● Inbound Rules 
• Dictate which incoming traffic is allowed into a given 
instance 
• Don't always block all traffic that is destined for an EC2 
instance 
● Outbound Rules 
• Used to regulate the outgoing traffic from an EC2 instance 
o To protect these EC2 instances from any malicious Internet-based threats, we 
could define Security Group rules that only allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic to be 
received by the EC2 instances and all other types of traffic would be blocked by 
default 
o Set Security Group rules to only allow traffic from specific EC2 instances or IP 
addresses to that managed database 
o Security groups cannot filter traffic based on domain names, it can only allow or 
deny traffic based on ports and IP addresses 
o Security groups are essentially a virtual firewall that can be used with EC2 
instances

▪ 
Use a cheat sheet 
• You're not allowed to actually carry anything into the exam with 
you, but if you're at a local testing center, they will give you a 
whiteboard or a dry erase sheet that's about the size of a normal 
piece of paper 
• Once the clock starts on the exam, you can brain-dump anything 
you want onto that paper 
• Use the sheet and spend the first 1-2 minutes writing down those 
important things you may forget later on

▪ 
Skip any questions that are giving you trouble 
• If you find yourself struggling with a really hard question, just 
mark it for review and skip it 
• Students who do this end up increasing their score by at least 5% 
to 10% over their peers who try to do the simulations at the 
beginning of their exam 
▪ 
Take a guess 
• If you're in doubt, I want you to take a guess from the possible 
answer choices 
• There is no penalty for guessing incorrectly on the exam 
• If you are in doubt of the right answer, try to eliminate as many 
choices as possible and guess between the remaining answer 
options 
▪ 
Pick the best time for your exam 
• Pick the time of day that works best for you 
• Don’t try to squeeze the exam in after working a long day at the 
office 
▪ 
Be confident 
• You’ve got this! 
• You should already know you're going to pass! 
• You should have already studied all the information in this course, 
you've watched the videos, you've taken the quizzes, you've 
studied your downloadable study notes 
• If you're not confident right now, then wait a few days to 
schedule your exam 
• Take a bunch of practice exams and build up your confidence 
o When you take a practice exam, your goal is not to memorize the answer key 
▪ 
You need to understand why the right answer was right and the wrong 
answers are wrong 
o Good luck, and I hope to see you again in a future course as you continue 
upwards in your cloud computing career and continue to climb up the 
certification ladder!
