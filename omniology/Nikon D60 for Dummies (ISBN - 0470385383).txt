Author’s Acknowledgments
I am extremely grateful to the team of talented professionals at John Wiley
and Sons for all their efforts in putting together this book. Special thanks go
to my awesome project editor, Kim Darosett, who is the type of editor that 
all authors hope for but rarely experience: supportive, skilled, and amazingly
calm in the face of any storm, including my not infrequent freakouts.
I also owe much to the rest of the folks in both the editorial and art depart-
ments, especially Heidi Unger, Rashell Smith, Shelley Lea, Steve Hayes, Andy
Cummings, and Mary Bednarek. Thanks, too, to my friends at Nikon for their
assistance, to Jonathan Conrad for providing the awesome nighttime shot 
for Chapter 7, and to agent extraordinaire, Margot Maley Hutchison, for her
continuing help and encouragement.
Last but oh, so not least, I am deeply indebted to technical editor Chuck
Pace, whose keen eye and vast experience set me on the right track when-
ever I mistakenly thought I should go left. Thank you, thank you, for sharing
your time and your expertise — the book would not have been the same
without it.

Nikon D60 For Dummies 

Introduction
O
nce upon a time, moving up from a point-and-shoot digital camera to an
SLR model meant adding significant weight and bulk to your camera 
bag — and removing a significant amount from your bank account. But all that
changed a few years ago with the introduction of the Nikon D40. Finally, here
was a camera that offered the power and flexibility of a digital SLR but in a rev-
olutionary, compact size and at an equally compact price. Combine those ben-
efits with the legendary quality for which Nikon is known, and it’s no surprise
that the D40, along with its sibling, the D40x, quickly became best-sellers.
Now, Nikon has taken a great thing and made it even better with the follow-up
to those two models, the D60. Amazingly, this model is slightly more diminu-
tive than its predecessors, weighing in at just over 16 ounces, yet it offers an
even greater array of features. 
In fact, the D60 offers so many features that sorting them all out can be more
than a little confusing, especially if you’re new to digital photography, SLR
photography, or both. For starters, you may not even be sure what SLR
means or how it affects your picture taking, let alone have a clue as to all the
other techie terms you encounter in your camera manual — resolution, aper-
ture, white balance, file format, and so on. And if you’re like many people, you
may be so overwhelmed by all the controls on your camera that you haven’t
yet ventured beyond fully automatic picture-taking mode. Which is a shame
because it’s sort of like buying a Porsche and never actually taking it on the
road.
Therein lies the point of Nikon D60 For Dummies: Through this book, you can
discover not just what each bell and whistle on your camera does, but also
when, where, why, and how to put it to best use. Unlike many photography
books, this one doesn’t require any previous knowledge of photography or
digital imaging to make sense of things, either. In classic For Dummies style,
everything is explained in easy-to-understand language, with lots of illustra-
tions to help clear up any confusion.
In short, what you have in your hands is the paperback version of an in-depth
photography workshop tailored specifically to your Nikon picture-taking
powerhouse.

Nikon D60 For Dummies 
A Quick Look at What’s Ahead
This book is organized into four parts, each devoted to a different aspect of
using your camera. Although chapters flow in a sequence that’s designed to
take you from absolute beginner to experienced user, I’ve also tried to make
each chapter as self-standing as possible so that you can explore the topics
that interest you in any order you please.
The following sections offer brief previews of each part. If you’re eager to find
details on a specific topic, the index shows you exactly where to look.
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps
Part I contains four chapters that help you get up and running with your D60:
 Chapter 1, “Getting the Lay of the Land,” offers a tour of the external
controls on your camera, shows you how to navigate camera menus to
access internal options, and walks you through initial camera setup and
customization steps.
 Chapter 2, “Taking Great Pictures, Automatically,” shows you how to get
the best results when using the camera’s fully automatic exposure
modes, including the Digital Vari-Program scene modes such as Sports
mode, Portrait mode, and Child mode.
 Chapter 3, “Controlling Picture Quality and Size,” introduces you to two
camera settings that are critical whether you shoot in automatic or
manual modes: the Image Size and Image Quality settings, which control
resolution (pixel count), file format, file size, and picture quality.
 Chapter 4, “Reviewing Your Photos,” explains how to view your pictures
on the camera monitor and also how to display various types of picture
information along with the image. In addition, this chapter discusses
how to delete unwanted images and protect your favorites from acciden-
tal erasure.
Part II: Taking Creative Control
Chapters in this part help you unleash the full creative power of your D60 by
moving into semiautomatic or manual photography modes.
 Chapter 5, “Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting,” covers the all-
important topic of exposure, starting with an explanation of three criti-
cal exposure controls: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. This chapter
also discusses your camera’s advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, and M),
explains exposure options such as Active D-Lighting, metering modes,
and exposure compensation, and offers tips for using the built-in flash.

 Chapter 6, “Manipulating Focus and Color,” provides help with control-
ling those aspects of your pictures. Look here for information about
your D60’s manual and auto-focusing features as well as details about
color controls such as white balance and the Optimize Image options.
 Chapter 7, “Putting It All Together,” summarizes all the techniques
explained in earlier chapters, providing a quick-reference guide to the
camera settings and shooting strategies that produce the best results for
specific types of pictures: portraits, action shots, landscape scenes,
close-ups, and more.
Part III: Working with Picture Files
This part of the book, as its title implies, discusses the often-confusing aspect
of moving your pictures from camera to computer and beyond.
 Chapter 8, “Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos,”
guides you through the process of transferring pictures from your
camera memory card to your computer’s hard drive or other storage
device. Look here, too, for details about using the D60’s built-in tool for
processing files that you shoot in the Nikon Raw format (NEF). Just as
important, this chapter explains how to organize and safeguard your
photo files. 
 Chapter 9, “Printing and Sharing Your Photos,” helps you turn your digi-
tal files into “hard copies,” covering both retail and do-it-yourself print-
ing options. This chapter also explains how to prepare your pictures for
online sharing, turn a series of photos into a stop-motion movie, and, for
times when you have the neighbors over, how to display your pictures
on a television screen.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
In famous For Dummies tradition, the book concludes with two “top ten” lists
containing additional bits of information and advice.
 Chapter 10, “Ten Fast Photo-Retouching Tricks,” shows you how to fix
less-than-perfect images using features found on your camera’s Retouch
menu, such as automated red-eye removal. In case you can’t solve the
problem that way, this chapter also explains how to perform some basic
retouching by using tools found in most photo editing programs.
 Chapter 11, “Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day,”
presents information about some camera features that, while not found
on most “Top Ten Reasons I Bought My D60” lists, are nonetheless inter-
esting, useful on occasion, or a bit of both.

Nikon D60 For Dummies 
Appendix: Firmware Notes and Menu Map
Wrapping up the book, the appendix explains how to find out what version of
the Nikon firmware, or internal software, is installed in your camera and how
to find and download updates.
If the information you see on your camera menus and other displays isn’t the
same as what you see in this book, and you’ve explored other reasons for the
discrepancy, a firmware update may be the issue. This book was written using
version 1.00 of the firmware, which was the most current at the time of publi-
cation. Firmware updates typically don’t carry major feature changes —
they’re mostly used to solve technical glitches in existing features — but if
you do download an update, be sure to read the accompanying description of
what it accomplishes so that you can adapt my instructions as necessary.
(Again, changes that affect how you actually operate the camera should be
minimal, if any.) 
On a less technical note, the appendix also includes tables that provide brief
descriptions of all commands found on the camera’s five menus.
Icons and Other Stuff to Note
If this isn’t your first For Dummies book, you may be familiar with the large,
round icons that decorate its margins. If not, here’s your very own icon-
decoder ring: 
A Tip icon flags information that will save you time, effort, money, or some
other valuable resource, including your sanity.
When you see this icon, look alive. It indicates a potential danger zone that
can result in much wailing and teeth-gnashing if ignored.
Lots of information in this book is of a technical nature — digital photography
is a technical animal, after all. But if I present a detail that is useful mainly for
impressing your technology-geek friends, I mark it with this icon.
I apply this icon either to introduce information that is especially worth stor-
ing in your brain’s long-term memory or to remind you of a fact that may have
been displaced from that memory by some other pressing fact.

Additionally, I need to point out two other details that will help you use this
book:
 Other margin art: Replicas of some of your camera’s buttons, dials, con-
trols, and menu graphics also appear in the margins of some paragraphs. I
include these to provide a quick reminder of the appearance of the button
or option being discussed. 
 Software menu commands: In sections that cover software, a series of
words connected by an arrow indicates commands that you choose from
the program menus. For example, if a step tells you to “Choose
File➪Print,” click the File menu to unfurl it and then click the Print com-
mand on the menu.
About the Software Shown in This Book
Providing specific instructions for performing photo organizing and editing
tasks requires that I feature specific software. In sections that cover file
downloading, archiving, printing, and e-mail sharing, I selected Nikon ViewNX
and Nikon Transfer, both of which ship free with your camera and work on
both the Windows and Mac operating systems.
However, because those programs don’t offer any photo-retouching tools, I
also feature Adobe Photoshop Elements for some discussions. The version
shown in the book is Elements 6 for Windows, but the tools covered here
work mostly the same in versions 4 and 5, and for Mac as well as Windows,
unless otherwise specified. 
Rest assured, though, that the tools used in both ViewNX and Elements work
very similarly in other programs, so you should be able to easily adapt the
steps to whatever software you use. (I recommend that you read your soft-
ware manual for details, of course.)
Practice, Be Patient, and Have Fun!
To wrap up this preamble, I want to stress that if you initially think that digital
photography is too confusing or too technical for you, you’re in very good
company. Everyone finds this stuff a little mind-boggling at first. So take it
slowly, experimenting with just one or two new camera settings or techniques
at first. Then, each time you go on a photo outing, make it a point to add one
or two more shooting skills to your repertoire.

Nikon D60 For Dummies 
I know that it’s hard to believe when you’re just starting out, but it really
won’t be long before everything starts to come together. With some time,
patience, and practice, you’ll soon wield your camera like a pro, dialing in the
necessary settings to capture your creative vision almost instinctively.
So without further ado, I invite you to grab your camera, a cup of whatever it
is you prefer to sip while you read, and start exploring the rest of this book.
Your D60 is the perfect partner for your photographic journey, and I thank
you for allowing me, through this book, to serve as your tour guide.

M
aking sense of all the controls on your 
D60 isn’t something you can do in an 
afternoon — heck, in a week, or maybe even a
month. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t 
take great pictures today. By using your camera’s
point-and-shoot automatic modes, you can cap-
ture terriﬁc images with very little effort. All you
do is compose the scene, and the camera takes
care of almost everything else.
This part shows you how to take best advantage
of your camera’s automatic features and also
addresses some basic setup steps, such as adjust-
ing the viewﬁnder to your eyesight and getting
familiar with the camera menus, buttons, and
dials. In addition, chapters in this part explain
how to obtain the very best picture quality,
whether you shoot in an automatic or manual
mode, and how to use your camera’s picture-
playback features.

I
still remember the day that I bought my first SLR film camera. I
was excited to finally move up from my one-button point-
and-shoot camera, but I was a little anxious, too. My new
pride and joy sported several unfamiliar buttons and
dials, and the explanations in the camera manual clearly
were written for someone with an engineering degree.
And then there was the whole business of attaching
the lens to the camera, an entirely new task for me. I
saved up my pennies a long time for that camera —
what if my inexperience caused me to damage the
thing before I even shot my first pictures?
You may be feeling similarly insecure if your Nikon D60
is your first SLR, although some of the buttons on the
camera back may look familiar if you’ve previously used a
digital point-and-shoot camera. If your D60 is both your first
SLR and first digital camera, you may be doubly intimidated.
Trust me, though, that your camera isn’t nearly as complicated as its exterior
makes it appear. With a little practice and the help of this chapter, which
introduces you to each external control, you’ll quickly become as comfort-
able with your camera’s buttons and dials as you are with the ones on your
car’s dashboard.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
This chapter also guides you through the process of mounting and using an
SLR lens, working with digital memory cards, and navigating your camera’s
internal menus. And for times when you don’t have this book handy, I show
you how to access the Help system that’s built into your camera.
Getting Comfortable with Your Lens
One of the biggest differences between a point-and-shoot camera and an SLR
(single-lens reflex) camera is the lens. With an SLR, you can swap out lenses
to suit different photographic needs, going from an extreme close-up lens to
a super-long telephoto, for example. In addition, an SLR lens has a movable
focusing ring that gives you the option of focusing manually instead of relying
on the camera’s autofocus mechanism. 
Of course, those added capabilities mean that you need a little background
information to take full advantage of your lens. To that end, the next four
sections explain the process of attaching, removing, and using this critical
part of your camera.
Attaching a lens
Whatever lens you choose, follow these steps to attach it to the camera body:
1. Remove the cap that covers the lens mount on the front of the camera.
2. Remove the cap that covers the back of the lens.
The cap is the one that doesn’t say Nikon on it, in case you aren’t sure. 
3. Hold the lens in front of the camera so that the little white dot on the
lens aligns with the matching dot on the camera body.
Official photography lingo uses the term mounting index instead of little
white dot. Either way, you can see the markings in question in Figure 1-1.
Note that the figure (and others in this chapter) shows you the D60 with
its so-called “kit lens” — the 18–55mm Vibration Reduction (VR) zoom
lens that Nikon sells as a unit with the body. If you buy a lens from a
manufacturer other than Nikon, your dot may be red or some other
color, so check the lens instruction manual.
4. Keeping the dots aligned, position the lens on the camera’s lens
mount as shown in Figure 1-1.
When you do so, grip the lens by its back collar as shown in the figure,
not the movable, forward end of the lens barrel.

Figure 1-1: When attaching the lens, align the index markers as shown here.
5. Turn the lens in a counter-clockwise direction until the lens clicks
into place.
To put it another way, turn the lens toward the side of the camera that
sports the shutter button, as indicated by the red arrow in the figure. 
6. On a lens that has an aperture ring, set and lock the ring so the aper-
ture is set at the highest f-stop number.
Check your lens manual to find out whether your lens sports an aper-
ture ring and how to adjust it. (The D60 kit lens doesn’t.) To find out
more about apertures and f-stops, see Chapter 5.
Always attach (or switch) lenses in a clean environment to reduce the risk 
of getting dust, dirt, and other contaminants inside the camera or lens.
Changing lenses on a sandy beach, for example, isn’t a good idea. For added
safety, point the camera body slightly down when performing this maneuver;
doing so helps prevent any flotsam in the air from being drawn into the
camera by gravity. See Chapter 3 for tips on cleaning your lens.

Removing a lens
To detach a lens from the camera body, take these steps:
1. Locate the lens-release button,
labeled in Figure 1-2.
2. Grip the rear collar of the lens.
In other words, hold onto the
stationary part of the lens that’s
closest to the camera body and
not the movable focusing ring or
zoom ring, if your lens has one.
3. Press the lens-release button
while turning the lens clock-
wise until the mounting index
on the lens is aligned with the
index on the camera body.
The mounting indexes are the
little guide dots labeled in
Figure 1-1. When the dots line
up, the lens should detach from
the mount. 
4. Place the rear protective cap
onto the back of the lens.
If you aren’t putting another
lens on the camera, cover the
lens mount with the protective
cap that came with your
camera, too.
Using a VR (vibration reduction) lens
If you purchased the D60 camera kit — that is, the body-and-lens combination
put together by Nikon — your lens offers a feature called vibration reduction.
On Nikon lenses, this feature is indicated by the initials VR in the lens name.
Vibration reduction attempts to compensate for small amounts of camera
shake that are common when photographers handhold their cameras and use
a slow shutter speed, a lens with a long focal length, or both. That camera
movement during the exposure can produce blurry images. Although vibra-
tion reduction can’t work miracles, it does enable most people to capture
sharper handheld shots in many situations than they otherwise could.
VR On/Off
Lens-release button
Figure 1-2: Press the lens-release button to
disengage the lens from the mount.

However, when you use a tripod, vibration reduction can have detrimental
effects because the system may try to adjust for movement that isn’t actually
occurring. That’s why your kit lens — and all Nikon VR lenses — have an
On/Off switch, which is located on the side of the lens, as shown in Figure 1-2.
When you do shoot with a tripod, remember to set that switch to the Off
position.
If you use a non-Nikon lens, the vibration reduction feature may go by another
name: image stabilization, optical stabilization, anti-shake, vibration compensa-
tion, and so on. In some cases, the manufacturers may recommend that you
leave the system turned on or to a special setting when you use a tripod, so be
sure to check the lens manual for information.
Chapter 6 offers more tips on achieving blur-free photos, and it also explains
focal length and its impact on your pictures. See Chapter 5 for an explanation
of shutter speed.
Focusing and zooming the lens
When paired with a compatible lens, your camera offers autofocusing capa-
bilities, which you can explore in detail in Chapter 6. But with some subjects,
autofocusing can be slow or impossible, which is why your camera also
offers manual focusing. The process is quick and easy: You just turn the
focusing ring on the lens until your subject comes into focus. To try it out,
take these steps:
1. Locate the A-M (Auto/Manual) focusing switch on the side of the lens.
Figure 1-3 shows the switch as it appears on the D60’s kit lens. The
switch should be in a similar location on other Nikon lenses; if you use a
lens from another manufacturer, check the lens instruction manual.
2. Set the switch to the M position, as shown in the figure.
Don’t try to move the focusing ring on the kit lens with the switch set to
the A (autofocus) position; doing so can damage the lens.
3. While looking through the viewfinder, twist the focusing ring to adjust
focus.
If you have trouble focusing, you may be too close to your subject; every
lens has a minimum focusing distance. (See Chapter 6 for more tips on
focus issues.) You may also need to adjust the viewfinder to accommo-
date your eyesight; see the next section for details.
13
Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land

14
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 1-3: Set the focusing mode switch to M before turning the manual focus ring.
Again, the option to switch between autofocusing and manual focusing
depends on matching the D60 with a fully compatible lens, as I mentioned in
the introduction to this section. The short story is this: The D60 doesn’t have
an autofocusing system built into the camera body, which means that the
lens itself must sport that mechanism in order for you to autofocus. You can
still use the lens if it doesn’t have an autofocusing system; you simply have to
focus manually at all times. When you use such a lens, visit Chapter 6 to find
out how to set the camera’s Focus mode option, found on the Custom Setting
menu, to Manual.
In addition, some lenses (although not the one sold with the D60 kit) enable
you to use autofocusing to set the initial focusing point and then fine-tune
focus manually. Check your lens manual for information on how to use this
option, if available.
If you bought a zoom lens, a movable zoom barrel lies behind the focusing
ring, as shown in Figure 1-3. To zoom in or out, just move that zoom ring 
forward and backward.
The numbers on the zoom ring, by the way, represent focal lengths. I explain
focal lengths in Chapter 6. In the meantime, just note that when the lens is
mounted on the camera, the number that’s aligned with the lens mounting
index (the white dot) represents the current focal length. In Figure 1-3, for
example, the focal length is 55mm.

Adjusting the Viewfinder Focus
Tucked behind the right side of the rubber eyepiece that surrounds the
viewfinder is a tiny vertical switch, called a diopter adjustment control. With
this control, labeled in the left image in Figure 1-4, you can adjust the focus of
your viewfinder to accommodate your eyesight.
Figure 1-4: Use the diopter adjustment control to set the viewfinder focus for your eyesight.
If you don’t take this step, scenes that appear out of focus through the
viewfinder may actually be sharply focused through the lens, and vice versa.
Here’s how to make the necessary adjustment:
1. Remove the lens cap from the front of the lens.
2. Look through the viewfinder and concentrate on the three pairs of
brackets shown on the right side of Figure 1-4.
The brackets are officially called focus brackets, but don’t worry about
focusing the actual picture now; just pay attention to the brackets.
3. Slide the diopter adjustment control up or down until the brackets
appear to be in focus.
The Nikon manual warns you not to poke yourself in the eye as you per-
form this maneuver. This warning seems so obvious that I laugh every
time I read it — which makes me feel doubly stupid the next time I poke
myself in the eye as I perform this maneuver.

Working with Memory Cards
Instead of recording images on film, digital cameras store pictures on memory
cards. Some people, in fact, refer to memory cards as digital film, but I hate
that term because film and memory cards actually have little in common.
Film must be developed before you can view your pictures, a process that
involves time and some not-so-nice chemicals. Film can be damaged when
exposed to some airport security scanners; memory cards are immune to
those devices. The cost per picture is also much higher for film: You have to
develop and print each negative, whether the shot is a keeper or a clunker.
With digital, you print only the pictures you like — and you can reuse your
memory cards over and over and over, saving even more money.
Whatever term you prefer, your D60 uses a specific type of memory card
called an SD card (for Secure Digital), shown in Figures 1-5 and 1-6. Other card
types — CompactFlash, Memory Stick, or any others — aren’t compatible
with your camera. However, if you use SD cards in your cell phone, portable
music player, or other device, you can use the same cards in your camera.
Safeguarding your memory cards — and the images you store on them —
requires just a few precautions:
 Inserting a card: First, be sure
that the camera is turned off.
Then put the card in the card
slot with the label facing the
back of the camera, as shown in
Figure 1-5. Push the card into
the slot until it clicks into place;
the memory card access light
(circled in Figure 1-5) blinks for
a second to let you know the
card is inserted properly.
 Formatting a card: The first
time you use a new memory
card, take a few seconds to
format it by choosing the
Format Memory Card option on
the Setup menu. This step
simply ensures that the card is
properly prepared to record
your pictures. See the upcoming
section “Cruising the Setup
menu” for details.
 Removing a card: After making sure that the memory card access light
is off, indicating that the camera has finished recording your most

recent photo, turn the camera
off. Open the memory card
door, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Depress the memory card
slightly until you hear a little
click and then let go. The card
should pop halfway out of the
slot, enabling you to grab it by
the tail and remove it.
 Handling cards: Don’t touch
the gold contacts on the back of
the card. (See the left card in
Figure 1-6.) When cards aren’t in
use, store them in the protective
cases they came in or in a
memory card wallet. Keep cards
away from extreme heat and
cold as well.
 Locking cards: The tiny switch
on the left side of the card,
labeled lock switch in Figure 1-6, enables you to lock your card, which
prevents any data from being erased or recorded to the card. Press the
switch toward the bottom of the card to lock the card contents; press it
toward the top of the card to unlock the data.
You can protect individual images from accidental erasure by using the
camera’s Protect feature, covered in Chapter 4.
Exploring External Camera Controls
Scattered across your camera’s exterior are a number of buttons, dials, and
switches that you use to change picture-taking settings, review and edit your
photos, and perform various other operations. Sometimes a single twist of a
dial gets the job done; other times, you press several buttons in sequence.
In later chapters, I discuss all your camera’s functions in detail and provide
the exact steps to follow to access those functions. This section provides just
a basic road map to the external controls plus a quick introduction to each.
You may want to put a sticky note or other bookmark on this page so that
you can find it for easier reference later. (The cheat sheet at the front of the
book offers a similar guide, albeit with less detail.)
With that preamble out of the way, the next three sections break down the
external controls found on the top, back, and front-left side of the camera.

Topside controls
Your virtual tour begins at the top of the camera, shown in Figure 1-7. There
are four controls of note here, as follows:
 On/Off switch and shutter
button: Okay, I’m pretty
sure you already figured
this combo button out. 
But check out Chapter 2 
to discover the proper
shutter-button-pressing
technique — you’d be sur-
prised how many people
mess up their pictures
because they press that
button incorrectly.
 Active D-Lighting button:
Your D60 offers an expo-
sure feature called Active
D-Lighting, which is
designed to help you get
better results when you
shoot high-contrast
scenes — a dark subject
against a bright back-
ground, for example. To
turn the feature on and
off, you press this button
while rotating the
Command dial, covered in
the next section. Chapter 5 explains Active D-Lighting in detail.
 Exposure Compensation button: This button activates a feature that
enables you to tweak exposure when working in three of your camera’s
autoexposure modes: programmed autoexposure, aperture-priority auto-
exposure, and shutter-priority autoexposure, represented by the letters
P, S, and A on the camera Mode dial. Chapter 5 explains.
 Mode dial: With this dial, you set the camera to fully automatic, semi-
automatic, or manual photography mode. The little pictographs, or
icons, represent the Nikon Digital Vari-Program modes, which are auto-
matic settings geared to specific types of photos: action shots, portraits,
landscapes, and so on. Chapter 2 details the Digital Vari-Program and
Auto modes; Chapter 5 explains the four others (P, S, A, and M).

Back-of-the-body controls
Traveling over the top of the camera to its back side, shown in Figure 1-8, you
encounter the following controls:
Figure 1-8: You use the Multi Selector to navigate menus and access certain other camera
options.
 Command dial: After you activate certain camera features, you rotate
this dial, labeled in Figure 1-8, to select a specific setting. For example,
when you shoot in the A exposure mode (aperture-priority autoexpo-
sure, detailed in Chapter 5), rotating the Command dial changes the
aperture (f-stop).
 AE-L/AF-L and Protect button: Like several buttons, this one serves mul-
tiple purposes. When you’re taking pictures in some automatic modes,
you can lock in your focus and exposure settings by pressing and holding
this button. Chapter 5 explains why you may want to do so. In picture
playback mode, pressing the button locks the picture file — hence the
little key symbol that appears on the camera body next to the button —
which protects the picture so that you can’t accidentally delete it. See
Chapter 4 for details on that option.

You can adjust the performance of the button as it relates to locking
focus and exposure, too. Instructions in this book assume that you stick
with the default setting, but if you want to explore your options, see
Chapter 11.
 Eye sensor: See those two tiny black bars under the viewfinder? (Refer
to Figure 1-8.) They enable the camera to automatically shift from dis-
playing critical shooting data on the monitor to showing it in the
viewfinder. As soon as you put your eye to the viewfinder, the monitor
shuts down, and the viewfinder is activated. Take your eye away from
the viewfinder, and the reverse happens. This setup saves battery life
because both displays aren’t active at once. But if you prefer, you can
disable the eye sensor via the Setup menu, covered later in the chapter.
The viewfinder then remains on while the shooting data is displayed on
the monitor.
 Multi Selector: This dual-natured control plays a role in many camera
functions. You press the outer edges of the Multi Selector left, right, up,
or down to navigate camera menus and access certain other options. At
the center of the control is the OK button, which you press to finalize a
menu selection or other camera adjustment. See the next section for
help with using the camera menus.
 Delete button: Sporting a trash can icon, the universal symbol for
delete, this button enables you to erase pictures from your memory
card. Chapter 4 has specifics.
 Playback button: Press this button to switch the camera into picture
review mode. Chapter 4 details the features available to you in this
mode.
 Menu button: Press this button to access five menus of camera options.
See the next section for details on navigating menus; see the appendix
for a complete listing of all menus and menu options.
 Thumbnail/Help button: In playback mode, pressing this button changes
the number of picture thumbnails displayed on the monitor. You also can
reduce the magnification of a thumbnail — zoom out, in other words.
(The minus sign in the magnifying glass is the universal symbol for zoom
out.) In other modes, the button accesses the camera’s built-in help
system. See “Asking Your Camera for Help,” later in this chapter, for
details.
 Zoom/Setting/Reset button: Even more multifunctioned, this button has
three main roles:
• In playback mode, pressing this button magnifies the currently dis-
played image and also reduces the number of thumbnails displayed
at a time. Note the plus sign in the middle of the magnifying glass —
plus for zoom in.
MENU
MENU
OK
OK

• When you’re in picture-taking mode, the button enables you to dis-
play the Shooting Info screen or the Quick Settings screen (both
covered later in this chapter) or turn the LCD monitor off. (The I
marking below the button reminds you of the button’s connection
to the Shooting Info screen.) See the upcoming section “Using the
Shooting Info and Quick Settings Displays” for details.
• The little green dot that appears under the button indicates the
button’s Reset function. Pressing this button and the Active D-
Lighting button — which is also neighbored by a green dot —
simultaneously for more than two seconds restores the most criti-
cal picture-taking options, such as Image Quality and Image Size, to
their default settings. See “Browsing the Custom Setting menu,”
later in this chapter, for more on this topic.
In this book, I refer to these last two buttons as the Thumbnail button and
the Zoom button, respectively. This isn’t the approach that Nikon takes in its
manuals — instructions therein call the button by the name that’s relevant
for the current function. I think that’s a little confusing, so I always refer to
each button by one name only.
Front-left buttons
On the front-left side of the camera body, you find two final external controls,
labeled in Figure 1-9. These work
as follows:
 Fn/Self-Timer button: The
Fn is short for function, in
case you were wondering.
By default, pressing this
button puts the camera into
Self-Timer mode, in which
the camera snaps the pic-
ture automatically a few
seconds after you press and
release the shutter button.
This feature allows for
hands-free picture taking —
useful for times when you
want to include yourself in
the shot, for example.
If you don’t use the Self-
Timer mode often, you can
set the button to control
one of four other functions
instead. Chapter 11 shows
you how.

 Flash/Flash compensation: Pressing this button pops up the camera’s
built-in flash (except in automatic shooting modes, in which the camera
decides whether the flash is needed). By holding the button down and
rotating the Command dial, you can adjust the flash mode (normal, red-
eye reduction, and so on). In advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, and M),
you also can press this button, along with the Exposure Compensation
button, and then rotate the Command dial to adjust the flash power. See
Chapter 5 for all things flash related.
Ordering from Camera Menus
You access many of your camera’s features via internal menus, which, con-
veniently enough, appear when you press the Menu button. Features are
grouped into five main menus, described briefly in Table 1-1.

After you press the Menu button, you see on the camera monitor a screen 
similar to the one shown in Figure 1-10. Along the left side of the screen, you
see the icons shown in Table 1-1, each representing one of the five available
MENU
MENU

menus. The icon that is highlighted or appears in color is the active menu;
options on that menu automatically appear to the right of the column of
icons. In the figure, the Shooting menu is active, for example.
I explain all the important menu options elsewhere in the book; for now, just
familiarize yourself with the process of navigating menus and selecting
options therein. The Multi Selector, shown in the margin here, is the key to
the game. You press the edges of the Multi Selector to navigate up, down, left,
and right through the menus.
In this book, the instruction “Press the Multi Selector left” simply means 
to press the left edge of the control. “Press the Multi Selector right” means to
press the right edge, and so on.
Here’s a bit more detail about the process of navigating menus:
 To select a different menu: Press the Multi Selector left to jump to the
column containing the five menu icons. Then press up or down to high-
light the menu you want
to display. Finally, press
right to jump over to the
options on the menu. 
 To select and adjust a
function on the current
menu: Again, use the
Multi Selector to scroll
up or down the list of
options to highlight the
feature you want to
adjust and then press
OK. Settings available for
the selected item then
appear. For example, if
you select the Image
Quality item from the
Shooting menu, as
shown on the left in Figure 1-11, and press OK, the available Image
Quality options appear, as shown on the right in the figure. Repeat the
old up-and-down scroll routine until the choice you prefer is highlighted.
Then press OK to return to the previous screen.
In some cases, you may see a right-pointing arrowhead instead of the OK
symbol next to an option. That’s your cue to press the Multi Selector
right to display a submenu or other list of options.

Again, I present this information just as a general introduction, so don’t
worry about memorizing it. I tell you exactly which Multi Selector actions to
take whenever I explain a function that requires its use.
Using the Shooting Info and Quick 
Settings Displays
As you advance in your photography and begin to move beyond the auto-
matic settings, you need a way to keep track of what camera settings are cur-
rently active. That’s the purpose of the Shooting Info display, shown in Figure
1-12. The figure shows the display in its normal, horizontal orientation; if you
rotate the camera to shoot a picture in the vertical orientation, the display
automatically rotates on the monitor, too, so that the information is always
easily readable.
If what you see in the figure looks like a big confusing mess, don’t worry.
Most of it won’t mean anything to you until you make your way through later
chapters. The figure does label the following two key points of data that are
helpful even in fully automatic mode, though:
 Battery status indicator: A “full” battery icon like the one in the figure
shows that the battery is fully charged; if the icon appears empty, go
look for your battery charger.
 Pictures remaining: The number you see here indicates how many
additional pictures you can store on the current memory card. If the
number exceeds 999, the value is presented a little differently. The ini-
tial K appears above the value to indicate that the first value represents
the picture count in thousands. For example, 1.0 K means that you can
store 1,000 more pictures (K being a universally accepted symbol indi-
cating 1,000 units). The number is then rounded down to the nearest
hundred. So if the card has room for, say, 1,230 more pictures, the value
reads as 1.2K.

After viewing current camera settings in the Shooting Info display, you can
switch to the Quick Settings display, shown on the left in Figure 1-13. From
here, you can adjust the most critical picture-taking settings via the screen
instead of digging through menus.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Follow these steps to try it out:
1. Display the Shooting Info screen, if it isn’t already visible on the
monitor.
The display appears automatically when you first turn on the camera
and then turns itself off after about eight seconds of camera inactivity.
Use either of these techniques to bring the display back to life:
• Press the Zoom button.
• Press the shutter button halfway and then release it.
The screen also appears automatically in a couple of other situations,
such as when you press the Flash button, or if you set the camera to the 
P, S, or A exposure mode and then press the Exposure Compensation
button. But I find the first two techniques the easiest to remember, espe-
cially because the Zoom button is labeled with the little I (for information).
2. Press the Zoom button again to switch to the Quick Settings display.
In this display, the center area of the screen is dimmed and bordered on
the right and below by a variety of options, as shown on the left in
Figure 1-13.
3. Press the Multi Selector to highlight the camera setting that you want
to change.
In Figure 1-13, for example, I highlighted the Image Quality setting. The
name of the selected setting appears in the upper-left corner of the
screen.
4. Press OK.
Now you’re taken to a screen that contains all the available options for
the setting that you selected in Step 3. For example, the right image in
Figure 1-13 shows the screen that appears if you select the Image Quality
setting and press OK.
5. Use the Multi Selector to select the option you want to use.
I selected Raw in Figure 1-13.
6. Press OK to apply the change and return to the Quick Settings display.
If you want to change other settings, just repeat Steps 3 through 6.
7. Press the Zoom button once to turn the monitor off; press it twice to
return to the Shooting Info screen.
The monitor turns itself off automatically when you put your eye to the
viewfinder — or if you don’t press any other buttons or perform any
camera functions for about eight seconds.

Again, don’t worry now about what any of the symbols or options in the
Shooting Info and Quick Settings displays mean — I explain all of that in later
chapters. For now, just familiarize yourself with this method of adjusting
camera settings.
Through the Setup menu, you can adjust the appearance and behavior of the
Shooting Info screen. The section “Cruising the Setup menu,” later in this
chapter, spells out two of the pertinent options (Auto Shooting Info and
Shooting Info Auto Off). Chapter 11 discusses how to change the look of the
display. But while working with this book, I recommend that you stick with
the default settings so that things look and work as described in these steps
and elsewhere. 
Decoding Viewfinder Data
When the camera is
turned on, you can view
some camera settings and
other critical information
in the viewfinder as well
as on the Shooting Info
display. The viewfinder
data changes depending
on what action you’re 
currently undertaking.
For example, if you simply
turn on the camera and
look through the
viewfinder without 
pressing the shutter
button, you see the data
labeled in Figure 1-14.
When you depress the
shutter button halfway to
initiate autofocusing — a
topic that I discuss in
Chapter 2 — you see a slightly different set of information.
Rather than give you a full guide to all the possible viewfinder readouts
here, which would only boggle your mind and cause lots of unnecessary
page-flipping, I show you the relevant viewfinder displays as I cover the var-
ious photographic topics later in the book.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Asking Your Camera for Help
Programmed into your camera’s internal software is a handy information 
help line — a great tool for times when you forget the purpose of a particular
feature or would like a little picture-taking guidance. This digital 411 offers
assistance in two ways: 
 Press and hold the Thumbnail
button to display information
about the current shooting mode
or selected menu option. For
example, Figure 1-15 shows the
Help screen associated with the
Image Quality setting. If you
need to scroll the screen to view
all the Help text, keep the
Thumbnail button depressed
and scroll by using the Multi
Selector. Release the Thumbnail
button to close the information
screen.
 If the camera thinks you’re
headed for a picture problem, it may display a blinking question mark on
the monitor or in the viewfinder. Again, press and hold the Thumbnail
button to see what’s up.
Reviewing Basic Setup Options
You know how sometimes you visit someone’s house, and their kitchen cabi-
nets are arranged in a way that doesn’t make sense to you? Why are the mugs
above the microwave instead of above the coffeepot? And wouldn’t it be
better if the serving spoons were next to the stove instead of by the dish-
washer? Well, that’s how I feel about the two menus discussed in this section,
the Setup menu and the Custom Setting menu.
Both menus contain options that control basic camera functions, such as
how long the monitor displays a recorded image after you press the shutter
button and how certain information appears on the monitor. But mixed in
with those options are totally unrelated controls, such as those that adjust
the exposure metering mode, covered in Chapter 5.
Well, I can’t rearrange the menus for you any more than I can put those mugs
near the coffeemaker, so instead, the following sections describe in detail
only the basic setup options found on each menu. For options related to
other aspects of camera operation, I list the chapter where you can find more
information.
Figure 1-15: Press and hold the Thumbnail
button to display onscreen help.

The figures in this section show only the first handful of options on each
menu, again in the interest of saving page space for more critical information.
Note, too, that I cover the Setup menu first, even though it’s listed after the
Custom Setting menu on the camera; the Setup menu contains the bulk of the
basic settings and also contains one setting that affects the appearance of the
Custom Setting menu. (See the earlier note about kitchen reorganization.)
If you don’t yet know how to select options from the menus, see the earlier
section, “Ordering from Camera Menus,” for help.
Cruising the Setup menu
Start your camera customization by
opening the Setup menu. It’s the menu
marked with the little wrench icon, as
shown in Figure 1-16.
Here’s a quick rundown of each menu
item, with those related to basic oper-
ations listed first:
 CSM/Setup Menu: Guess what?
You can even customize the
Setup menu and its neighbor, the
Custom Setting menu! At the
default setting, Simple, some
options are hidden on both
menus. Choose Full to access the hidden settings. You can also choose
My Menu and select exactly which options appear and which are
hidden.
While working with this book, choose Full so that what you see in your
menus matches my figures. When you’re ready to head off on your own,
though, see Chapter 11 for details on how to establish your own, custom
menus.
 Format Memory Card: The first time you insert a new memory card,
you should use this option to format the card, a maintenance function
that wipes out any existing data on the card and prepares it for use by
the camera. If you previously used your card in another device, such as
a digital music player, be sure to copy those files to your computer
before you format the card.
 Info Display Format: With this setting, you can alter the visual design of
the Shooting Info display, covered earlier in this chapter. You can estab-
lish this setting independently for the Digital Vari-Program modes and
the other shooting modes (manual, aperture-priority autoexposure, and
so on). Use the default setting, Graphic, for both categories so that your
display matches what you see in this book. Chapter 11 gives you a look
at the other modes.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 Auto Shooting Info: When you turn this option on, as it is by default, the
Shooting Info display automatically appears when you depress the shut-
ter button halfway. The camera is smart enough, however, not to acti-
vate the display when your eye is close to the viewfinder. As with the
preceding option, you can establish different settings for the two cate-
gories of shooting modes; I suggest that you keep both categories set to
On while working with this book. See the earlier section “Using the
Shooting Info and Quick Settings Displays” for details about the display.
If you do turn the option off, you can still use the Zoom button to acti-
vate the Shooting Info display.
 Shooting Info Auto Off: Also related to the Shooting Info display, this
option determines whether the camera turns off the Shooting Info dis-
play and fires up the viewfinder display when you put your eye to the
viewfinder. In other words, it enables or disables the little eye sensor
under the viewfinder. I suggest that you leave this option turned on, as it
is by default.
 World Time: When you turn on your camera for the very first time, it auto-
matically displays this option and asks you to set the current date and time.
Keeping the date/time accurate is important because that information is
recorded as part of the image file. In your photo browser, you can then see
when you shot an image and, equally handy, search for images by the date
they were taken. Note that the date and time are not imprinted on your pic-
ture; however, if you want that to happen, you can make it so via the Date
Imprint option on the Custom Settings menu, covered in the next section.
Also, if you see the message “Clock Not Set” on the camera monitor, the
internal battery that keeps the clock running is depleted. Simply charg-
ing the main camera battery and then putting that battery back in the
camera sets the clock ticking again, but you need to reset the camera
time and date.
 LCD Brightness: This menu selection offers two options, as shown on the
left in Figure 1-17. If you select LCD brightness, you can make the camera
monitor brighter or darker, as shown on the right image in the figure.
Figure 1-17: You can adjust the brightness of the camera monitor.

If you take this step, keep in mind that what you see on the display may
not be an accurate rendition of the actual exposure of your image. Crank
up the monitor brightness, for example, and an underexposed photo
may look just fine. So I recommend that you keep the brightness at the
default setting (0). As an alternative, you can display the histogram, an
exposure guide that I explain in Chapter 4, when reviewing your images.
When the second monitor control, Auto Dim, is turned on, as it is by
default, the monitor gradually dims after a few seconds when the Shooting
Info screen is displayed. You can disable that feature by setting the option
to Off.
 Video Mode: This option is related to viewing your images on a television,
a topic I cover in Chapter 9. Select NTSC if you live in North America or
other countries that adhere to the NTSC video standard; select PAL for
playback in areas that follow that code of video conduct.
 Language: You’re asked to specify a language along with the date and
time when you fire up your camera for the first time. Your choice deter-
mines the language of text on the camera monitor. Screens in this book
display the English language, but I find it entertaining on occasion to
hand my camera to a friend after changing the language to, say, Swedish.
I’m a real yokester, yah?
 File No. Sequence: This option controls how the camera names your
picture files. When the option is set to Off, as it is by default, the camera
restarts file numbering at 0001 every time you format your memory card
or insert a new memory card. Numbering is also restarted if you create
custom folders (an advanced option covered in Chapter 11). 
Needless to say, this setup can cause problems over time, creating a 
scenario where you wind up with multiple images that have the same 
file name — not on the current memory card, but when you download
images to your computer. So I strongly encourage you to set the option
to On. Note that when you get to picture number 9999, file numbering is
still reset to 0001, however. The camera automatically creates a new
folder to hold for your next 9999 images.
As for the Reset option, it enables you to assign the first file number
(which ends in 0001) to the next picture you shoot. Then the camera
behaves as if you selected the On setting.
 And the rest: The remaining functions on this menu, listed below, relate
to image playback, organization, and camera maintenance:
• Image Comment: See Chapter 11 to find out how to use this feature,
which enables you to add text comments into a picture file. You
then can read that information in Nikon ViewNX, the software that
shipped with your camera. (The text doesn’t actually appear on
the image itself.)
31
Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land

32
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
• Folders: This feature is an advanced file-organization option; leave
the option set at the default until you read about it in Chapter 11.
• Clean Image Sensor: Your D60 is set up at the factory to perform an
internal cleaning routine each time you turn the camera on or off.
This cleaning system is designed to keep the image sensor — that’s
the part of the camera that actually captures the image — free of
dust and dirt.
By choosing the Clean Image Sensor command, you can perform a
cleaning at any time, however. Just choose the command, press
OK, select Clean Now, and press OK again. You also can tell the
camera to perform automatic cleaning only at startup, only at shut-
down, or never; to do so, select Clean At instead of Clean Now.
Then press the Multi Selector right, highlight the cleaning option
you prefer, and press OK.
• Mirror Lock-Up: This feature is necessary when cleaning the camera
interior — an operation that I don’t recommend that you tackle
yourself. See Chapter 3 for more information on camera cleaning.
And if you’ve used mirror lock-up on a film camera to avoid camera
shake when shooting long-exposure images, note that in this case,
the lock-up feature is provided for cleaning purposes only. You
can’t take pictures on the D60 while the mirror lock-up is engaged.
• Firmware Version: This screen is informational in nature only; it
tells you the current version of the camera firmware (internal oper-
ating software). The appendix explains how to check which ver-
sion is installed in your camera and how to update it via Nikon’s
Web site if needed.
• Dust Off Ref Photo: This specialty feature enables you to record an
image that serves as a point of reference for the automatic dust-
removal filter available in Nikon Capture NX. I don’t cover this
accessory software, which must be purchased separately, in this
book.
• Auto Image Rotation: Keep this option set at the default setting
(On) so that the image is automatically rotated to the correct ori-
entation (horizontal or vertical) in playback mode. The orientation
is recorded as part of the image file, too, so the auto-rotating also
occurs when you browse your image thumbnails in ViewNX. Note,
though, the rotation data may not be accurate for pictures that you
take with the camera pointing directly up or down.
Browsing the Custom Setting menu
Figure 1-18 shows the Custom Setting menu, whose icon, for reasons I can’t
figure out, is a little pencil. At any rate, many options here involve photo-
graphic functions, such as using the flash, selecting an exposure metering
mode, and so on.

As with the Setup menu, some 
options are hidden unless you set the
CSM/Setup Menu option to Full, as
requested in the preceding section. 
Go ahead and take that step now if
you haven’t already.
With that task out of the way, the fol-
lowing list describes just the Custom
Setting menu items related to basic
camera operations:
 Reset: Select this option to
restore all features on the Custom
Setting menu to their default set-
tings. Note that the two-button reset technique I describe earlier in the
chapter, in the section “Back-of-the-body controls,” affects only a few
options on this menu, all of which fall in the category of critical image-
capture settings (such as focus mode and shooting mode). If you’re inter-
ested, you can find a complete list of all the camera’s default settings in
the back of the camera manual.
 Beep: By default, your camera beeps at you after certain operations,
such as after it sets focus when you shoot in autofocus mode. If you’re
doing top-secret surveillance work and need the camera to hush up, set
this option to Off. On the Shooting Info display, a little musical note icon
appears to the left of the battery icon when the beep is enabled. (Refer
to Figure 1-12.) Turn the beep off, and the icon appears in a circle with a
slash through it.
 No Memory Card?: Keep this one set at the default (Release Locked),
which disables the shutter button when no memory card is in the
camera. If you set it to Enable Release, you can take a temporary picture,
which appears in the monitor with the word “Demo” but isn’t recorded
anywhere. (The feature is provided mainly for use in camera stores,
enabling salespeople to demonstrate the camera without having to keep
a memory card installed.)
 Image Review: Leave this option set to On if you want the camera to
automatically display each picture briefly in the monitor after you press
the shutter button.
If you’re shooting fast-paced action and you want to speed up shot-to-
shot time — how long the camera makes you wait after taking one pic-
ture before you can take another — try turning this feature off. You can
then review your pictures by pressing the Playback button.
 AF-Assist: On the front of your camera, there’s a little light tucked right
below the Mode dial. This light is the autofocus-assist illuminator. In dim
lighting, it shoots out a beam of light to help the camera’s autofocus
system find its target. In general, leaving the AF-Assist option enabled is
33
Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Figure 1-18: The Custom Setting menu
contains additional basic options.

34
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
a good idea, but if you’re doing a lot of shooting at a party, wedding, or
some event where the light from the lamp may be distracting, you may
want to disable it.
Regardless of the setting you choose here, however, the illuminator 
doesn’t light in manual focus mode or in the Sports or Land-scape Digital
Vari-Program modes. In addition, the feature doesn’t operate incontinuous-
servo autofocus mode or when the center autofocus area mode is not
selected. You can explore those two focus options in Chapter 6.
 Self-Timer/Fn Button: Here’s where you establish the operation you
want to assign to this button, introduced in the earlier section “Front-left
buttons.” See Chapter 11 for more details.
 Auto-Off Timers: When your camera is turned on but idle for a period of
time, it conserves battery power by automatically turning off the moni-
tor and exposure meter. Options on this menu determine how much
time must pass before this occurs: 
• Short: The monitor turns off after eight seconds of inactivity; the
exposure meter, after four seconds. After you take a picture, it is
displayed on the monitor for four seconds, assuming that the
Image Review option, explained earlier, is enabled.
• Normal: The monitor goes dark after 12 seconds; the exposure meter,
eight seconds. The image-review period remains at four seconds.
• Long: Monitor shutdown occurs after 20 seconds; the exposure
meter turns off after one minute. The image-review period is 20
seconds.
• Custom: Choose this option to specify your own timing for monitor
and meter shutdown and for the image-review period.
If you know you’re perilously close to complete battery drainage, select
the Short auto-off settings and turn off Image Review altogether.
 Date Imprint: If you want the shooting date and time to appear on your
image, this feature provides that option. By default, it’s turned off; you
can choose instead to print the date or the date and time. You also can
imprint a date counter, which indicates the number of days between the
shooting date and a date that you select. Whichever data you choose, it
appears in the lower-right corner of your photo.
This information is permanently imprinted in your image and can’t be
removed after the fact. So I suggest that you leave the option disabled
and instead add date information in your photo editing program. Some
programs can even automatically add that data when you print the
image. Chapter 8 shows you how to determine the shooting date and
time for a photo by looking at its internal file data, or metadata.
That wraps up all the basic customization settings. For details about other
items on the Custom Setting menu, flip to the appendix, which points you to
the chapter where I cover each option.

re you old enough to remember the Certs television commercials from
the 1960s and ’70s? “It’s a candy mint!” declared one actor.
“It’s a breath mint!” argued another. Then a narrator declared
the debate a tie and spoke the famous catchphrase: “It’s
two, two, two mints in one!”
Well, that’s sort of how I see the Nikon D60. On one
hand, it provides a full range of powerful controls,
offering just about every feature a serious photo-
grapher could want. On the other, it offers auto-
mated photography modes that enable people with
absolutely no experience to capture beautiful images.
“It’s a sophisticated photographic tool!” “It’s as easy as
‘point and shoot!’” “It’s two, two, two cameras in one!”
Now, my guess is that you bought this book for help with
your camera’s advanced side, so that’s what other chapters
cover. This chapter, however, is devoted to your camera’s simpler
side. Because even when you shoot in automatic exposure and focus modes,
following a few basic guidelines can help you get better results. For example,
your camera offers a variety of automatic exposure modes, some of which may
be new to you. The mode affects the look of your pictures, so this chapter
explains those options. In addition, this chapter reviews flash options available
to you in automatic modes and covers techniques that enable you to get the
best performance from your Nikon’s autofocus and autoexposure systems. 

36
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Getting Good Point-and-Shoot Results
Your D60 offers several automatic photography modes, all of which I explain
later in this chapter. But in any of those modes, the key to good photos is to
follow a specific picture-taking technique.
To try it out, set the Mode dial on top of the camera to Auto, as shown in the
left image in Figure 2-1. Then set the focusing switch on the lens to the A (auto-
focus) position, as shown in the right image in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1: Choose these settings for fully automatic exposure and focus.
Unless you are using a tripod, also set the VR (vibration reduction) switch to
the On setting, as shown in Figure 2-1. This feature is designed to produce
sharper images by compensating for camera movement that can occur when
you handhold the camera. Note that Figure 2-1 features the Nikon lens that is
bundled with the D60; if you own a different lens, check your lens manual for
details about switching from auto to manual focusing and for tips on using its
vibration reduction feature, if provided.
Your camera is now set up to work in the most automatic of automatic
modes. Follow these steps to take the picture:
AF-assist illuminator
Auto/Manual focus switch
VR On/Off switch

1. Looking through the
viewfinder, frame the image
so that your subject appears
under one of the three 
focus brackets, as shown 
in Figure 2-2.
2. Press and hold the shutter
button halfway down.
The camera’s auto-focus
system begins to do its thing.
In dim light, a little lamp
located on the front of the
camera, just beneath the
Mode dial, may shoot out a
beam of light. That lamp,
called the autofocus-assist illu-
minator, helps the camera
measure the distance
between your subject and
the lens so that it can better
establish focus. You can see
the lamp in the left image in
Figure 2-1, which shows a
top view of the camera.
At the same time, the autoex-
posure meter analyzes the
light and selects initial aper-
ture (f-stop) and shutter
speed settings, which are
two critical exposure con-
trols. These two settings
appear in the viewfinder; in
Figure 2-2, the shutter speed
is 1/250 second, and the f-
stop is f/5.6. (Chapter 5
explains these two options
in detail.) The built-in flash
may pop up if the camera
thinks additional light is
needed.
When the camera has estab-
lished focus, the focus indicator in the viewfinder lights, and one of the
focus brackets turns red, as shown in Figure 2-3. The red bracket indi-
cates the area of the frame that the camera used to establish focus. The
auto-exposure meter continues monitoring the light up to the time you
take the picture, so the f-stop and shutter speed values in the viewfinder
may change if the light shifts.

3. Press the shutter button the rest of the way down to record the image.
While the camera sends the image
data to the camera memory card, the
memory card access lamp lights, as
shown in Figure 2-4. Don’t turn off the
camera or remove the memory card
while the lamp is lit, or you may
damage both camera and card.
When the recording process is fin-
ished, the picture appears briefly on
the camera monitor (assuming that
you enable the Image Review feature,
as explained in Chapter 1). See
Chapter 4 to find out how to switch
to playback mode and take a longer
look at your image.
I need to add one important note about
Step 2: Which focusing brackets the camera
uses to establish focus depends on the cur-
rent AF-area mode setting (the AF stands
for autofocus). There are three possibilities: 
 Closest Subject: The camera locks
focus on the pair of brackets that
contains the object closest to the
camera lens.
 Dynamic Area: In this mode, you use the Multi Selector to specify which
pair of brackets you want the camera to use when focusing. But if the
object within those brackets moves after you press the shutter button
halfway to lock in focus, the camera looks for focus information from the
other brackets. This mode is designed for subjects that may be moving
unpredictably; the idea is that the subject is likely to wind up within one
of the three focus areas.
 Single Point: In this mode, you use the Multi Selector to select a single
pair of focus brackets, and the camera then bases focus only on that area.
The default AF-area setting varies depending on which automatic exposure
mode you use (Auto, Portrait, and so on); I spell out that detail when describ-
ing each mode later in this chapter. If you want to change the AF-area mode,
Chapter 6 explains how. But even if you do so, your camera may not be able
to lock focus where you intend. Some subjects just give autofocusing systems
fits: Highly reflective objects, subjects behind fence bars, and scenes in
which little contrast exists between the subject and the background are just a
few potential problem areas.
My advice? If the autofocus mechanism can’t lock onto your subject after a
few seconds, just switch to manual focusing and be done with it.
Figure 2-4: The memory card access
lamp lights while the camera sends the
picture data to the card.

A few final points about working in the point-and-shoot modes covered in this
chapter: 
 The built-in flash unit is disabled in Sports, Landscape, and Auto Flash
Off modes. For other modes, you can choose from a couple of flash
options; see the upcoming section “Using Flash in Automatic Exposure
Modes” for details.
 Instructions I give in the steps here assume that you are using the
camera’s default Release Mode setting, which records a single image 
with each press of the shutter button. For a look at your other options —
continuous (burst mode) shooting, self-timer shooting, and remote-
control shooting — see the last section in the chapter.
Using Flash in Automatic Exposure Modes
The built-in flash on your Nikon offers a variety of different modes. Table 2-1
offers a quick-reference guide to the six basic modes. In addition to these
basic modes, the camera also offers some combo modes, such as Auto with
Red-Eye Reduction, Slow Sync with Red-Eye Reduction, and the like.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
To select a flash mode, press and hold the Flash button on the side of the
camera as you rotate the Command dial. I highlighted both controls in 
Figure 2-5. An icon representing the currently selected mode appears in the
Shooting Info display, shown in the left image in Figure 2-6. (Press the shutter
button halfway or press the Zoom button, if needed, to activate the display.)
The viewfinder display doesn’t advise you of the specific flash mode but
instead just shows the universal lightning bolt icon when the flash is enabled,
as in the right image in the figure, and turns off the icon when the flash is

Now for the bad news: Your flash flexibility is limited when you use any of 
the automatic exposure modes covered in this chapter. In Portrait mode, 
for example, you can’t use a flash unless the camera thinks the lighting is
suitably dim. That restriction becomes problematic for outdoor, daytime 
More focus factors to consider
When you focus the lens, either in autofocus or
manual focus mode, you determine only the point
of sharpest focus. The distance to which that
sharp-focus zone extends from that point —
what photographers call the depth of field —
depends in part on the aperture setting, or f-stop,
which is an exposure control. Some of the D60’s
Digital Vari-Program autoexposure modes are
designed to choose aperture settings that deliver
a certain depth of field. 
The Portrait setting, for example, uses an aper-
ture setting that shortens the depth of field so
that background objects are softly focused — an
artistic choice that most people prefer for por-
traits. On the flip side of the coin, the Landscape
setting selects an aperture that produces a large
depth of field so that both foreground and back-
ground objects appear sharp.
Another exposure-related control, shutter speed,
plays a focus role when you photograph moving
objects. Moving objects appear blurry at slow
shutter speeds; at fast shutter speeds, they
appear sharply focused. On your D60, the Sports
shooting mode automatically selects a high shut-
ter speed so that you can “stop” action, produc-
ing blur-free shots of your favorite soccer player,
flying bird, or other object in motion.
A fast shutter speed can also help safeguard
against allover blurring that results when the
camera is moved during the exposure. The faster
the shutter speed, the shorter the exposure time,
which reduces the time that you need to keep the
camera absolutely still. If you’re using the Nikon
D60 kit lens, you can also improve your odds of
shake-free shots by enabling the vibration reduc-
tion (VR) feature. (Set the switch on the lens to the
On position.) For a very slow shutter speed, using
a tripod is the best way to avoid camera shake;
be sure to turn the VR off when you do so. 
If you want to manipulate focus and depth of
field to a greater extent than the automated
exposure modes allow, visit Chapter 6. For an
explanation of the role of shutter speed and
aperture in exposure, check out Chapter 5.

portraits, which almost always benefit from using flash to better illuminate
subjects’ faces. (Chapter 7 offers an illustration.) Additionally, you don’t have
access to flash compensation, which enables you to diminish or strengthen
the burst of light the flash produces. Bummer, as the youngsters say.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
The upcoming sections tell you which flash modes are available in each of
the fully automatic exposure modes. For more details about flash photo-
graphy, including information about flash compensation, see Chapter 5.
Exploring Your Automatic Options
You can choose from eight fully automatic 
exposure modes, all of which you access via the
Mode dial on the top of the camera, shown in
Figure 2-7.
The next sections provide details on each of these
options. For information about the four other 
settings on the Mode dial — P (programmed auto),
S (shutter-priority autoexposure), A (aperture-
priority autoexposure), and M (manual exposure),
see Chapter 5.
Auto mode
In this mode, represented by the green camera
icon you see in the margin here, the camera selects all settings based on the
scene that it detects in front of the lens. Your only job is to lock in focus,
using the two-stage auto-focus technique that I outline at the beginning of the
chapter, or by setting the lens to manual mode and using the focus ring on
the lens barrel, as explained in Chapter 1.
Auto mode is great for casual, quick snapshooting. But keep these limitations
in mind:
 AF-area (autofocus area) mode: This mode uses the Closest Subject 
AF-area mode setting. That is, the camera calculates the distance of
objects that fall within the three focus brackets in the viewfinder and
then bases focus on the nearest object. The only way to override this
decision is to switch to manual focusing.
 Flash: You have three flash mode choices: Auto, Auto with Red-Eye
Reduction, and Off. You can’t enable the flash if the camera’s autoexpo-
sure meter doesn’t sense that additional light is needed. Nor can you
adjust the intensity of the flash, a feature I cover in Chapter 5.
 Color: You can’t adjust color. If the image displays a color cast, you must
switch to a mode that enables you to adjust the White Balance setting,
covered in Chapter 6.
 Exposure: You have access to two exposure-adjustment options:
• Active D-Lighting: This feature adjusts exposure in a way that
improves pictures that include both very dark areas and very
Auto
Digital Vari-
Program modes

eight fully automatic, point-and-
shoot photography modes.

bright areas. Chapter 5 covers this option in detail, along with
other exposure features, but in short, Active D-Lighting is designed
to brighten shadow areas but leave the highlight areas alone so
that they don’t become too bright.
When you shoot a high-contrast scene, such as a dark object
against a bright background, experiment by taking some photos
with Active D-Lighting enabled and some with it turned off. To
enable the feature, press and hold the Active D-Lighting button,
located on top of the camera and shown in the margin here. You
then can view the status of the option in the Shooting Info display
or in the viewfinder, as shown in Figure 2-8. Rotate the Command
dial while keeping the button pressed to turn the feature on or off.
(When you release the button, the viewfinder display returns to
showing the normal shooting data.)
Again, Chapter 5 provides a full explanation of this feature, along
with some examples of its impact on your pictures. For information
about a related feature, the D-Lighting filter on the Retouch menu,
see Chapter 10.
• ISO Sensitivity: This setting determines the light sensitivity of the
camera — or, to put it another way, how much light is needed to
properly expose the image. By default, this option is set to Auto,
and the camera adjusts the ISO Sensitivity as needed. For more
information about how ISO affects your pictures — and why you
may want to select a specific ISO setting — visit Chapter 5. Be
aware, though, that even if you do so, the camera has the final say:
If the ISO you select isn’t workable given the available light, the
camera overrides your decision when you shoot in Auto exposure
mode or any of the Digital Vari-Program modes.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
I purposely didn’t include an example of a photo taken in Auto mode
because, frankly, the results that this setting creates vary widely depending
on how well the camera detects whether you’re trying to shoot a portrait,
landscape, action shot, or whatever. But the bottom line is that full auto is a
one-size-fits-all approach that may or may not take best advantage of your
camera’s capabilities. So if you want to more consistently take great pictures
instead of merely good ones, I encourage you to explore the exposure, focus,
and color information found in Part II so that you can abandon this mode in
favor of modes that put more photographic decisions in your hands.
Digital Vari-Program modes
In Auto mode, the camera tries to figure out what type of picture you want to
take by assessing what it sees through the lens. If you don’t want to rely on
the camera to make that judgment, your D60 offers seven Digital Vari-Program
modes that are designed for popular categories of pictures.
Most people in the photography community refer to these modes as scene
modes or creative scene modes. I prefer the latter term because that’s what
the Digital Vari-Program modes enable you to do: automatically capture spe-
cific scenes in ways that are traditionally considered best from a creative
standpoint. For example, most people prefer portraits that have softly
focused backgrounds. So in Portrait mode, the camera selects settings that
can produce that type of background. 
All the Digital Vari-Program modes share a few limitations — or benefits,
depending on how you look at things: 
 Exposure: As with Auto mode, the camera takes complete control of expo-
sure, with the exception of the Active D-Lighting and ISO Sensitivity set-
tings, both introduced in the preceding section and detailed in Chapter 5.
 Color: You can’t tweak color, either. Some modes manipulate colors in
ways that you may or may not appreciate, and you’re stuck if you have a
color cast problem.
 Flash and AF-area mode: Available flash options vary depending on the
Digital Vari-Program mode you select, as does the AF-area (autofocus
area) setting. But none of the Digital Vari-Program modes offers com-
plete flexibility over these functions.
In the next sections, you can read about the unique features of each of the
Digital Vari-Program modes. To see whether you approve of how your camera
approaches the different scenes, take some test shots. If you aren’t happy
with the results, you can switch to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, S,
A, or M) and then check out Chapters 5–7 to find out how to manipulate
whatever aspect of the picture isn’t to your liking.

Auto Flash Off mode
The Auto Flash Off mode delivers the same results as Auto mode but ensures
that the flash doesn’t fire. In other words, think of this mode as a faster alter-
native to selecting Auto mode and then changing the flash setting to Off.
From a practical standpoint, this mode provides an easy way to ensure that
you don’t break the rules when shooting in locations that don’t permit flash:
museums, churches, and so on.
Portrait and Child modes
The Portrait and Child modes are so closely related that it makes sense to
consider them together.
45
Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
What does [r 12] in the viewfinder mean?
When you look in your viewfinder to frame a
shot, the initial value shown in brackets at the
right end of the viewfinder display indicates the
number of additional pictures that can fit on
your memory card at the currently selected
Image Size and Image Quality settings. (Chapter
3 explains those settings.) For example, in the
left viewfinder image below, the value shows
that the card can hold 22 more images.
As soon as you press the shutter button halfway,
which kicks the autofocus mechanism into action,
that value changes to instead show you how
many pictures can fit in the camera’s memory
buffer. In the right image here, for example, the “r
12” value tells you that 12 pictures can fit in the
buffer. This number also varies depending on the
size and quality settings you use.
So what’s the buffer? It’s a temporary storage
tank where the camera stores picture data until
it has time to fully record that data onto the
camera memory card. This system exists so that
you can take a continuous series of pictures
without having to wait between shots until each
image is fully written to the memory card. 
When the buffer is full, the camera automati-
cally disables the shutter button until it catches
up on its recording work. Chances are, though,
that you’ll very rarely, if ever, encounter this sit-
uation; the camera is usually more than capa-
ble of keeping up with your shooting rate. 
For more information about rapid-fire photogra-
phy, see the section on action photography in
Chapter 7.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
First, Portrait mode. This mode selects
an aperture setting designed to produce
a short depth of field, which results in a
slightly blurry background and thus
puts the visual emphasis on your sub-
ject. Figure 2-9 offers an example.
However, this effect occurs only if your
subject is at least a few feet from the
background. The extent to which the
background blurs also depends on the
other depth-of-field factors that I dis-
cuss in Chapter 6. Portrait mode also
selects settings designed to produce
natural skin tones. 
If you use autofocusing, the camera sets
the AF-area mode option to Closest
Subject, which makes sense because 
the closest thing to the lens in most 
portraits is, in fact, the subject. If your
subject is posed behind some object 
and the camera mistakenly locks focus
on that object, you can either adjust 
the AF-area mode setting, as covered in
Chapter 6, or just switch to manual focus.
Child mode, represented by the toddler
icon you see in the margin here, also
attempts to produce a soft-focus back-
ground and bases autofocus on the
closest subject. But in Child mode, the
camera renders hues that are tradition-
ally found in clothing and backgrounds
more boldly than in Portrait mode. In
Figure 2-10, for example, notice that the
football and the little boy’s shorts are
noticeably more vivid than in the por-
trait example in Figure 2-9. Skin tones
are left natural, although they, too, can
appear a little more saturated, depend-
ing on the subject and the lighting.
Child mode also softens focus just a
tiny bit; the idea is to keep baby-soft
skin looking, er, baby soft.
From my viewpoint, the decision to use
Child mode doesn’t have anything to do
with the age of the subject — heck, most
adults appreciate being rendered with
Portrait mode
Figure 2-9: Portrait mode produces a softly
focused background.
Child mode
Figure 2-10: Child mode renders non-skin
colors more vividly than Portrait mode.

softer skin, too. A more important consideration is how colors are rendered. 
I prefer Portrait mode because the strengthened background colors in Child
mode can easily distract the eye from the subject’s face, which should be the
point of emphasis in any portrait.
Keep in mind, too, that you can use these modes any time you want a short
depth of field, not just for people pictures. Try both modes when shooting stat-
ues, still-life arrangements (such as a vase of flowers on a kitchen table), and
the like. Do note, though, that the short depth of field produced by Portrait and
Child modes may result in softer focus on objects set in front of your subject,
not just those behind it. And one more tip: If the particular child you’re pho-
tographing seems to be in perpetual motion, both modes may select a too-slow
shutter speed, resulting in a subject that appears even blurrier than the back-
ground. In that situation, Sports mode may deliver better results.
Landscape mode
Like the Child and Portrait
modes, Landscape mode bases
autofocus on the closest subject.
But whereas Child and Portrait
modes aim for a very shallow
depth of field (small zone of
sharp focus), Landscape mode,
which is designed for capturing
scenic vistas, city skylines, and
other large-scale subjects, goes
the other route, selecting an
aperture setting (f-stop) that 
produces a large depth of field.
As a result, objects both close to
the camera and at a distance
appear sharply focused. Figure
2-11 offers an example. For this
picture, I set focus on the tree on
the far right side of the frame.
Notice that the tree on the far left
appears nearly as sharp, despite
its distance from my established
focus point.
In addition, this mode boosts
colors slightly to produce the
kind of bold, rich hues that most
people prefer in landscape pic-
tures. The built-in flash is dis-
abled, which is typically no big
deal: Because of its limited range,
a built-in flash is of little use when shooting most landscapes anyway.

Landscape mode
Figure 2-11: Landscape mode produces a large
zone of sharp focus and also boosts color intensity
slightly.

48
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
However, if you attach an external flash unit, you can use it in this mode.
(Chapter 5 discusses external flash units.)
Again, think beyond the Landscape moniker when you look for good ways to
put this mode to use: Try it when shooting long-range pictures of animals at
the zoo, for example, so that critters both near and far appear sharp.
Chapter 6 shows you more ways to extend depth of field and get more control
over your photo colors.
Sports mode
Sports mode activates a
number of settings that can
help you photograph any
moving object, whether it’s an
athlete or a romping dog like
the one in Figure 2-12, without
blur. First, the camera selects a
fast shutter speed, which is
needed to “stop motion.” 
In addition, this mode sets the
AF-area (autofocus area) mode
to Dynamic Area. That is, you
use the Multi Selector to indi-
cate which pair of focus brack-
ets you want the camera to use
when calculating the focusing
distance. But if the object
moves beyond those brackets
before you capture the image,
the camera tries to draw focus
information from the other
brackets. With luck, your sub-
ject will move within one of the
focus areas before you record
the image. (If not, you can
always simply switch to manual
focusing.)
Finally, the built-in flash is dis-
abled. That can be a problem in
low-light situations, but it also enables you to shoot successive images more
quickly because the flash needs a brief period to recycle between shots. If
you own an external flash unit, however, you can use it in Sports mode if you
like; just be aware that you may sacrifice in the speed-shooting department
Sports mode

try Sports mode.

because of the necessary flash-recycle time. Additionally, the fastest shutter
speed you can use with flash is 1/200 second, which may be too slow to cap-
tures some subjects without blur.
Even without flash, whether the camera can select a shutter speed fast
enough to stop motion depends on the available light and the speed of the
subject itself. The available light also determines what aperture setting the
camera uses, which, as noted earlier in this chapter, affects the depth of field,
or zone of sharp focus. In Figure 2-12, the camera selected a shutter speed
that did, in fact, catch my furkid in mid-romp, although if you look very
closely, you can see some slight blurring of his beard. Because of the very
bright light, the camera also selected a small aperture setting, which pro-
duces a large depth of field — so the grass in the background is as sharply
focused as that in the foreground. To fully understand these issues, explore
Chapters 5 and 6.
Sometimes, allowing a moving object to blur can actually create a heightened
sense of motion — an artistic choice that you can’t make in Sports mode. 
For more control over shutter speed, try out S mode (shutter-priority auto-
exposure), explained in Chapter 5.
Close Up mode
Switching to Close Up mode doesn’t enable you to focus at a closer distance
to your subject than normal (as it does on some non-SLR cameras). The close-
focusing capabilities of your camera depend entirely on the lens you bought.
But the settings of Close Up mode do affect focus in other ways. First, the
camera sets the AF-area mode to Single Area and then bases focus on the
subject that falls within the center focus brackets. (If you like, you can use
the Multi Selector to base focus on the left or right pair of focus brackets
instead of the center brackets, however).
Second, Close Up mode selects an aperture setting designed to produce short
depth of field, which helps keep background objects from competing for
attention with your main subject. As with Portrait and Child modes, though,
how much the background blurs varies depending on the distance between
your subject and the background, as well as a few other factors, all outlined
in Chapter 6.
As for flash, you can set its mode to Auto, Auto with Red-Eye Reduction, and
Off. (I urge you, though, to be very careful about using the built-in flash when
you’re shooting a person or animal at close range — that strong burst of light
isn’t healthy for the eyes.)
Chapter 7 offers additional tips on close-up photography.

Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Night Portrait mode
As its name implies, the Night Portrait mode is designed to deliver a better-
looking portrait at night (or in any dimly lit environment). It does so by con-
straining you to using Slow Sync, Slow Sync with Red-Eye Reduction, or No
Flash modes. In all three flash modes, the camera selects a shutter speed that
results in a long exposure time. That slow shutter speed enables the camera
to rely more on ambient light and less on the flash to expose the picture,
which produces softer, more even lighting.
I cover the issue of long-exposure and slow-sync flash photography in detail
in Chapter 5. For now, the critical thing to know is that the slower shutter
speed means that you probably need a tripod. If you try to handhold the
camera, you run the risk of moving the camera during the long exposure,
resulting in a blurry image. Enabling the vibration reduction (VR) feature of
your lens, if available, can help, but for nighttime shooting, even that may not
permit successful handheld shooting. Your subjects also must stay perfectly
still during the exposure, which can also be a challenge.
Changing the (Shutter Button) Release Mode
In addition to all its other mode settings — exposure modes, focus modes,
flash modes, and the like — your D60 offers a generically named but critical
setting called Release mode.
This setting simply determines what happens when you completely depress
the shutter-release button, known by most people as simply the shutter
button. You have five options, as follows:
 Single Frame: This setting, which is the default, records a single image
each time you press the shutter button completely. In other words, this
is normal-photography mode.
 Continuous: Sometimes known as burst mode, this setting records a con-
tinuous series of images as long as you hold down the shutter button.
On the D60, you can capture a maximum of about three images per
second. Obviously, this mode is great for capturing fast-paced subjects;
see Chapter 7 for details and more action-photography tips.
 Self-Timer: Want to put yourself in the picture? Select this mode and then
press the shutter button and run into the frame. As soon as you press the
shutter button, the autofocus-assist illuminator on the front of the camera
starts to blink, and the camera emits a series of beeps (assuming that you
didn’t disable its voice, a setting I cover in Chapter 1). A few seconds later,
the camera captures the image.

The default delay time between your shutter-button press and the image
capture is 10 seconds, but you can change it to 2, 5, or 20 seconds. Just
pull up the Custom Setting menu and highlight the Self-Timer option, as
shown in Figure 2-13. Press OK to display the four time options, as
shown on the right screen in the figure, highlight your preference, and
press OK again.
I also often use the self-timer function when I want to avoid any possibil-
ity of camera shake. The mere motion of pressing the shutter button can
cause slight camera movement, which can blur an image. So I put the
camera on a tripod and then activate the self-timer function. This
enables “hands-free” — and therefore motion-free — picture-taking.
 Delayed Remote and Quick Response Remote: The final two Release
mode settings relate to the optional Nikon wireless remote-control unit.
If you select Delayed Remote, the camera snaps the picture two seconds
after you press the shutter-release button on the remote unit. If you
select Quick Response Remote, the image is captured immediately.
Figure 2-13: You can adjust the self-timer capture delay via the Custom Setting menu.
You can change the Release mode via the Custom Setting menu. But a more
convenient method is to use the Quick Settings display. Use the Multi
Selector to highlight the Release mode option, as shown in the left image in
Figure 2-14. Press OK to display the available modes, as shown on the right,
and then highlight your choice and press OK again. (Chapter 1 explains more
about using the Quick Settings display, if you need help.)
If you want to use Self-Timer mode, you have an even easier option: Just
press the Fn/Self-Timer button on the left-front side of the camera. By default,
pressing the button automatically switches the camera to Self-Timer mode. 
51
Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically

52
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 2-14: You can change the Release mode via the Quick Settings display.
Unfortunately, after you take your picture or turn off the camera, the Release
mode automatically reverts to either Single Frame or Continuous mode,
depending on which of the two you previously selected. So if you want to
take a series of self-timer pictures, you must press the Fn/Self-Timer button
between each shot. In addition, the camera also cancels out of the remote-
control modes if it doesn’t receive a signal from the remote after a period of
time. You can specify how long the camera should wait to take this step by
using the Remote On Duration option on the Custom Setting menu. (A shorter
delay saves battery life.)

A
lmost every review of the D60 contains glowing reports about the
cameras’ top-notch picture quality. As you’ve no doubt dis-
covered for yourself, those claims are true, too: This baby
can create large, beautiful images.
What you may not have discovered is that Nikon’s
default Image Quality setting isn’t the highest that
the D60 offers. Why, you ask, would Nikon do such 
a thing? Why not set up the camera to produce the
best images right out of the box? The answer is that
using the top setting has some downsides. Nikon’s
default choice represents a compromise between
avoiding those disadvantages while still producing
images that will please most photographers.
Whether that compromise is right for you, however,
depends on your photographic needs. To help you decide,
this chapter explains the Image Quality setting, along with the
Image Size setting, which is also critical to the quality of images that you
print. Just in case you’re having quality problems related to other issues,
though, the first section of the chapter provides a handy quality-defect diag-
nosis guide.

54
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
A word of warning before you dive in: This stuff may be a little confusing at
first. In fact, I pretty much guarantee it. Some math is even involved, which is
usually against my principles. On top of that, discussions of picture quality
and size involve lots of technical terms, such as pixels, resolution, JPEG 
compression, and the like.
So take it slowly, and if your eyes start to glaze over, put the book down and
come back later for another go-round. It may require a few reads of this chap-
ter, but before long, you’ll feel confident about controlling these important
aspects of your pictures.
Diagnosing Quality Problems
When I use the term picture quality, I’m not talking about the composition,
exposure, or other traditional characteristics of a photograph. Instead, I’m
referring to how finely the image is rendered in the digital sense.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the concept: The first example is a high-quality image,
with clear details and smooth color transitions. The other examples show
five common digital-image defects.
Figure 3-1: Refer to this symptom guide to determine the cause of poor image quality.
High quality
Pixelation
JPEG artifacts
Noise
Color cast
Lens/sensor dirt

Each of these defects is related to a different issue, and only one is affected
by the Image Quality setting on your D60. So if you aren’t happy with your
image quality, first compare your photos to those in the figure to properly
diagnose the problem. Then try these remedies: 
 Pixelation: When an image doesn’t have enough pixels (the colored tiles
used to create digital images), details aren’t clear, and curved and diago-
nal lines appear jagged. The fix is to increase image resolution, which
you do via the Image Size control. See the next section, “Adjusting
Resolution (Image Size),” for details.
 JPEG artifacts: The “parquet tile” texture and random color defects that
mar the third image in Figure 3-1 can occur in photos captured in the
JPEG (jay-peg) file format, which is why these flaws are referred to 
as JPEG artifacts. This is the defect related to the Image Quality setting;
see “Changing the File Type (JPEG or Raw)” to find out more.
 Noise: This defect gives your image a speckled look, as shown in the
lower-left example in Figure 3-1. Noise can occur with very long expo-
sure times or when you choose a high ISO Sensitivity setting on your
camera. You can explore both issues in Chapter 5.
 Color cast: If your colors are seriously out of whack, as shown in the
lower-middle example in the figure, try adjusting the camera’s White
Balance setting. Chapter 6 covers this control and other color issues.
Note, though, that you can control white balance only when you shoot 
in the advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, and M).
 Lens/sensor dirt: A dirty lens is the first possible cause of the kind of
defects you see in the last example in the figure. If cleaning your lens
doesn’t solve the problem, dust or dirt may have made its way onto the
camera’s image sensor. See the sidebar “Maintaining a pristine view,”
elsewhere in this chapter, for information on safe lens and sensor 
cleaning. 
When diagnosing image problems, you may want to open the photos in ViewNX
or some other photo software and zoom in for a close-up inspection. Some
defects, especially pixelation and JPEG artifacts, have a similar appearance
until you see them at a magnified view. (See Part III for information about using
ViewNX.)
I should also tell you that I used a little digital enhancement to exaggerate the
flaws in my example images to make the symptoms easier to see. With the
exception of an unwanted color cast or a big blob of lens or sensor dirt, these
defects may not even be noticeable unless you print or view your image at a
very large size. And the subject matter of your image may camouflage some
flaws; most people probably wouldn’t detect a little JPEG artifacting in a 
photograph of a densely wooded forest, for example.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
In other words, don’t consider Figure 3-1 as an indication that your D60 is
suspect in the image quality department. First, any digital camera can pro-
duce these defects under the right circumstances. Second, by following the
guidelines in this chapter and the others mentioned in the preceding list, you
can resolve any quality issues that you may encounter.
Adjusting Resolution (Image Size)
Like other digital devices, your D60 creates pictures out of pixels, which is
short for picture elements. You can see some pixels close up in the right exam-
ple of Figure 3-2, which shows a greatly magnified view of the eye area in the
left image.
Figure 3-2: Pixels are the building blocks of digital photos.
You specify the pixel count of your images, also known as the resolution, via
the Image Size control, accessible through both the Shooting menu and the
Quick Settings display. The D60 offers three Image Size settings: Large, Medium,
and Small; Table 3-1 lists the resulting resolution values for each setting.

In the table, the first pair of numbers shown for each setting represents the
image pixel dimensions — that is, the number of horizontal pixels and the
number of vertical pixels. The values in parentheses indicate the total resolu-
tion, which you get by multiplying the horizontal and vertical pixel values.
This number is usually stated in megapixels, abbreviated MP for short. One
megapixel equals 1 million pixels. (I rounded off the MP values in the table.)
Note, however, that if you select Raw (NEF) as your file format, all images are
captured at the Large setting. You can vary the resolution only if you select
JPEG as the file format. The upcoming section “Changing the File Type (JPEG
or Raw)” explains file formats, which you specify via the Image Quality setting. 
So how many pixels are enough? To make the call, you need to understand
how resolution affects print quality, display size, and file size. The next sec-
tions explain these issues, as well as a few other resolution factoids. If you’re
already schooled on the subject, skip to “Accessing the Image Size control,”
later in this chapter, for specifics on how to adjust this option.
Pixels and print quality
When mulling over resolution options, your first consideration is how large
you want to print your photos, because pixel count determines the size at
which you can produce a high-quality print. If you don’t have enough pixels,
your prints may exhibit the defects you see in the pixelation example in
Figure 3-1, or worse, you may be able to see the individual pixels, as in the
right example in Figure 3-2.
Depending on your photo printer, you typically need anywhere from 200 to
300 pixels per linear inch, or ppi, of the print. To produce an 8-by-10-inch
print at 200 ppi, for example, you need 1600 horizontal pixels and 2000 verti-
cal pixels (or vice versa, depending on the orientation of your print).
Table 3-2 lists the pixel counts needed to produce traditional print sizes at
200 ppi and 300 ppi. But again, the optimum ppi varies depending on the
printer — some printers prefer even more than 300 ppi — so check your
manual or ask the photo technician at the lab that makes your prints. (And
note that ppi is not the same thing as dpi, which is a measurement of printer
resolution. Dpi refers to how many dots of color the printer can lay down 
per inch; most printers use multiple dots to reproduce one pixel.)
Even though many photo-editing programs enable you to add pixels to an
existing image, doing so isn’t a good idea. For reasons I won’t bore you with,
adding pixels — known as resampling — doesn’t enable you to successfully
enlarge your photo. In fact, resampling typically makes matters worse. The
printing discussion at the start of Chapter 9 includes some example images
that illustrate this issue.

Pixels and screen display size
Resolution doesn’t affect the quality of images viewed on a monitor, televi-
sion, or other screen device as it does printed photos. What resolution does
determine is the size at which the image appears.
This issue is one of the most misunderstood aspects of digital photography,
so I explain it thoroughly in Chapter 9. For now, just know that you need way
fewer pixels for onscreen photos than you do for printed photos. For exam-
ple, Figure 3-3 shows a 450-x-300-pixel image that I attached to an e-mail 
message.
For e-mail images, I recommend a maximum of 640 pixels for the picture’s
longest dimension. If your image is much larger, the recipient can’t view the
entire picture without scrolling the display.
In short, even if you use the smallest Image Size setting on your D60, you’ll
have more than enough pixels for most onscreen uses. The only exception
might be an image that you want to display via a digital projector that has 
a very large screen resolution. Again, Chapter 9 details this issue, and also
shows you how to prepare your pictures for online sharing.
Pixels and file size
Every additional pixel increases the amount of data required to create a digi-
tal picture file. So a higher-resolution image has a larger file size than a low-
resolution image.

Figure 3-3: The low resolution of this image (450 x 300 pixels) ensures that it can be viewed
without scrolling when shared via e-mail.
Large files present several problems:
 You can store fewer images on your memory card, on your computer’s
hard drive, and on removable storage media such as a CD-ROM.
 The camera needs more time to process and store the image data on the
memory card after you press the shutter button. This extra time can
hamper fast-action shooting.
 When you share photos online, larger files take longer to upload and
download.
 When you edit your photos in your photo software, your computer
needs more resources and time to process large files.
59
Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size

60
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
To sum up, the trade-off for a high-resolution image is a large file size. But note
that the Image Quality setting also affects file size. See the section “Changing
the File Type (JPEG or Raw)” for more on that topic. The upcoming sidebar
“How many pictures fit on my memory card?” provides details on the file-
storage issue.
Resolution recommendations
As you can see, resolution is a bit of a sticky wicket. What if you aren’t sure
how large you want to print your images? What if you want to print your
photos and share them online? 
Personally, I take the “better safe than sorry” route, which leads to the follow-
ing recommendations about the Image Size setting: 
 Always shoot at a resolution suitable for print. You then can create a
low-resolution copy of the image in your photo editor for use online.
Chapter 9 shows you how.
Again, you can’t go in the opposite direction, adding pixels to a low-
resolution original in your photo editor to create a good, large print.
Even with the very best software, adding pixels doesn’t improve the
print quality of a low-resolution image.
 For everyday images, Medium (5.6 MP) is a good choice. I find 10.2 MP,
which you get at the Large setting, to be overkill for most casual shoot-
ing, which means that you’re creating huge files for no good reason.
Even at the Medium setting, you get enough pixels (2896 x 1944) to 
produce a 5-x-7-inch print at 300 ppi or an 8-x-10-inch print at 200 ppi.
 Choose Large (10.2 MP) for an image that you plan to crop, print very
large, or both. The benefit of maxing out resolution is that you have the
flexibility to crop your photo and still generate a decent-sized print of
the remaining image. For example, I shot the left photo in Figure 3-4 at
the zoo. (What, you think I can afford an arctic safari or something?)
Even with a powerful zoom lens, I couldn’t get close enough to fill the
frame with the bear’s head, which was my compositional goal. Shooting
at the highest resolution enabled me to crop the photo and still have
enough pixels left to produce a great print, as you see in the right image.
 Reduce resolution if shooting speed is paramount. If you’re shooting
action and the shot-to-shot capture time is slower than you’d like — that
is, the camera takes too long after you take one shot before it lets you
take another — dialing down the resolution may help. Also see Chapter 7
for other tips on action photography.

Figure 3-4: Capture images that you plan to crop and enlarge at the highest possible Image 
Size setting.
Accessing the Image Size control
When you choose an Image Quality setting that captures your image in the
Raw (NEF) format, you don’t need to worry about the Image Size setting —
the camera captures all Raw images at the Large resolution. (You can explore
the issue of format in the next section.)
If you capture images in the JPEG format, you can choose any of the three
Image Size options. You can make your selection via the Quick Settings dis-
play or from the Shooting menu, as follows: 
 Quick Settings display: First, display the Shooting Info screen, if it isn’t
already visible, by pressing the shutter button halfway or by pressing
the Zoom button. Then press the Zoom button to shift to the Quick
Settings display and use the Multi Selector to highlight the Image Size
option, as shown on the left in Figure 3-5. Press OK to display the screen
shown on the right in the figure, highlight the resolution setting that you
want to use, and press OK again.
 Shooting menu: Display the Shooting menu and highlight the Image Size
option, as shown on the left in Figure 3-6. Press OK to access the resolu-
tion options, as shown on the right in the figure. Highlight your choice
and press OK again.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 3-5: The Image Size control is positioned at the top of the Shooting Info display.
Figure 3-6: You can also adjust Image Size through the Shooting menu.
When you change the Image Size setting, the file size changes, which changes
the number of new shots you can fit on the current memory card. If you
change the resolution via the Quick Settings display, you can view the
number of shots remaining and the file size when you select Large, Medium,
or Small on the second screen, as shown in the right image in Figure 3-5. In
the figure, for example, the current file size is 4.1MB (megabytes), and the
number of remaining shots is 361.
Changing the File Type (JPEG or Raw)
When you display the Shooting Menu, you see an option named Image
Quality right above the Image Size control. (Refer to Figure 3-6.) If I had my
druthers, the Image Quality option would instead be called File Type,
because that’s what the setting controls.

The file type, more commonly known as a file format, determines how your
picture data is recorded and stored. Your choice does impact picture quality,
but so do other factors, as outlined at the beginning of this chapter. In addi-
tion, your choice of file type has ramifications beyond picture quality.
At any rate, your D60 offers the two file types common on most of today’s
digital cameras: JPEG and Camera Raw, or just Raw for short, which goes by
the specific moniker NEF on Nikon cameras. You can choose from five Quality
options, three of which deliver JPEG files, one which produces a Raw file, and
one which creates the same image twice, once in each format. 
The next sections explain the pros and cons of the five Image Quality set-
tings. If your mind is already made up, skip ahead to “Adjusting the Image
Quality setting” for specifics on making your selection.
Don’t confuse file format with the Format Memory Card option on the Setup
menu. That option erases all data on your memory card; see Chapter 1 for
details.

Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
How many pictures fit on my memory card?
That question is one of the first asked by new
camera owners — and it’s an important one
because you don’t want to run out of space on
your memory card just as the perfect photo-
graphic subject presents itself.
As explained in the Image Size and Image
Quality discussions in this chapter, image reso-
lution (pixel count) and file format (JPEG or
Raw) together determine the size of the picture
file which, in turn, determines how many photos
fit in a given amount of camera memory.
The table below shows you approximately how
many pictures fit on a 1GB (gigabyte) memory
card at each of the possible resolution/format
combinations on the D60. If you have a 2GB
card, double the picture counts; for a 526MB
(megabyte) card, expect to fit half the number
of pictures.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
JPEG: The imaging (and Web) standard 
Pronounced jay-peg, this format is the default setting on your D60, as it is for
most digital cameras. JPEG is popular for two main reasons:
 Immediate usability: All Web browsers and e-mail programs can display
JPEG files, so you can share them online immediately after you shoot
them. The same can’t be said for NEF (Raw) files, which must be con-
verted to JPEG files before you can share them online. And although you
can print Raw files directly from Nikon ViewNX, you must convert them
to a standard format to view or print them from most other photo pro-
grams. You can read more about the conversion process in the upcom-
ing section “NEF (Raw): The purist’s choice.”
 Small files: JPEG files are smaller than NEF (Raw) files. And smaller files
means that your pictures consume less room on your camera memory
card and in your computer’s storage tank.
The downside — you knew there had to be one — is that JPEG creates smaller
files by applying lossy compression. This process actually throws away some
image data. Too much compression leads to the defects you see in the JPEG
Artifacts example in Figure 3-1.
Fortunately, your camera enables you to specify how much compression
you’re willing to accept. The Image Quality menu offers three JPEG settings,
which produce the following results: 
 JPEG Fine: At this setting, the compression ratio is 1:4 — that is, the file
is four times smaller than it would otherwise be. In plain English, that
means that very little compression is applied, so you shouldn’t see
many compression artifacts, if any.
 JPEG Norm: Switch to Norm (for Normal), and the compression ratio
rises to 1:8. The chance of seeing some artifacting increases as well.
 JPEG Basic: Shift to this setting, and the compression ratio jumps to
1:16. That’s a substantial amount of compression and brings with it a 
lot more risk of artifacting.
Note, though, that even the JPEG Basic setting on your D60 doesn’t result in
anywhere near the level of artifacting that you see in my example in Figure 3-1.
Again, that example is exaggerated to help you be able to recognize artifacting
defects and understand how they differ from other image-quality issues.
In fact, if you keep your image print or display size small, you aren’t likely to
notice a great deal of quality difference between the Fine, Normal, and Basic
compression levels, although details in the Fine version may appear slightly
crisper than the Normal and Basic options. It’s only when you greatly enlarge
a photo that the differences become apparent.

Take a look at Figures 3-7 and 3-8, for
example. I captured the scene in
Figure 3-7 four times, keeping the res-
olution the same for each shot but
varying the Image Quality setting. 
For the photo you see in Figure 3-7, I
used the JPEG Fine setting. I thought
about printing the three other shots
along with the JPEG Fine example, 
but frankly, you wouldn’t be able to
detect a nickel’s worth of difference
between the examples at the size that
I could print them on this page. So
Figure 3-8 shows just a portion of
each shot at a greatly enlarged size.
The first three images show the JPEG
Fine, Normal, and Basic shots; for the
fourth image, I used the NEF (Raw)
setting, which applies no compres-
sion. (Note that during the process of
converting the Raw image to a print-
ready file, I tried to use settings that
kept the Raw image as close as possi-
ble to its JPEG cousins in all aspects
but quality. But any variations in
exposure, color, and contrast are a
result of the conversion process, not
of the format per se.)
Even at the greatly magnified size, it takes a sharp eye to detect the quality
differences between the Raw and Fine images. When you carefully inspect the
Normal version, you can see some artifacting start to appear; it’s most visible
in how well the red dots and number are rendered. The boundaries of the red
dot, for example, aren’t as well defined, and the color appears to “bleed” a
little outside the dot. Jump to the Basic example, however, and compression
artifacting becomes more apparent. (Note that the jagginess of the letters is
not a function of compression but a result of blowing the picture up way
beyond what the original pixel count can support.)
Nikon chose to use the Normal setting as the default on the D60. And for
everyday images that you don’t plan to print or display very large, that’s
probably just ducky. And because file size shrinks as you apply more com-
pression, Normal enables you to fit more photos on your memory card than
Fine or NEF (Raw). As a point of reference, Table 3-3 shows you the approxi-
mate file size, in megabytes (MB), of an image captured at each of the D60’s
resolution options (Large, Medium, and Small) and using each of the Image

Quality settings. Elsewhere in this chapter, the sidebar “How many pictures
fit on my memory card?” shows you how many images you can store on a
1GB (gigabyte) storage card at each of the various combinations of Image
Size and Image Quality settings. Keep in mind that in both cases, the numbers
you see in the table are rough averages; depending on the image, your pic-
ture files may be smaller or larger.

For my money, though, the file size benefit you gain when going from Fine to
Normal isn’t worth even a little quality loss, especially with the price of
camera memory cards getting lower every day. You never know when a
casual snapshot is going to turn out to be so great that you want to print or
display it large enough that even minor quality loss becomes a concern. And
of all the defects that you can correct in a photo editor, artifacting is one of
the hardest to remove. So if I shoot in the JPEG format, I stick with Fine.
I suggest that you do your own test shots, however, carefully inspect the
results in your photo editor, and make your own judgment about what level
of artifacting you can accept. Artifacting is often much easier to spot when
you view images onscreen than I can reproduce here in print because the
print process itself obscures some of the tiny defects caused by compression.
If you don’t want any risk of artifacting, bypass JPEG altogether and change
the file type to NEF (Raw), explained next.
Whichever format you select, however, be aware of one more important rule
for preserving the original image quality: If you retouch pictures in your
photo software, don’t save the altered images in the JPEG format. Every time
you alter and save an image in the JPEG format, you apply another round of
lossy compression. And with enough editing, saving, and compressing, you
can eventually get to the level of image degradation shown in the JPEG exam-
ple in Figure 3-1, at the start of this chapter. (Simply opening and closing the
file does no harm.)
Always save your edited photos in a non-destructive format. TIFF, pronounced
tiff, is a good choice and is a file-saving option available in most photo-editing
programs. Should you want to share the edited image online, create a JPEG
copy of it when you’re finished making all your changes. That way, you always
retain one copy of the photo at the original quality captured by the camera.
You can read more about TIFF versus JPEG in Chapter 8, in the section related
to processing Raw images. Chapter 9 explains how to create a copy of your
photo for online sharing.

Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
NEF (Raw): The purist’s choice
The other picture-file type you can create on your Nikon is called Camera
Raw, or just Raw (as in uncooked) for short.
Each manufacturer has its own flavor of Raw. Nikon’s is called NEF, so you 
see the three-letter extension NEF at the end of Raw file names if you use a
Windows computer. In addition, the Raw format setting on your camera is
officially called NEF (Raw), although it appears without the NEF on the
Shooting Info display.
Raw is popular with advanced, very demanding photographers, for two 
reasons:
 Greater creative control: With JPEG, internal camera software tweaks
your images, making adjustments to color, exposure, and sharpness as
needed to produce the results that Nikon believes its customers prefer.
With Raw, the camera simply records the original, unprocessed image
data. The photographer then copies the image file to the computer and
uses special software known as a raw converter to produce the actual
image, making decisions about color, exposure, and so on at that point.
The upshot is that “shooting Raw” enables you, and not the camera, to
have the final say on the visual characteristics of your image.
 Best picture quality: Because Raw doesn’t apply the destructive com-
pression associated with JPEG, you don’t run the risk of the artifacting
that can occur with JPEG. 
But of course, as with most things in life, Raw isn’t without its disadvantages.
To wit:
 You can’t do much of anything with your pictures until you process
them in a Raw converter. You can’t share them online, for example, or
put them into a text document or multimedia presentation. You can print
them immediately if you use Nikon ViewNX, but most other photo pro-
grams require you to convert the Raw files to a standard format first. So
when you shoot Raw, you add to the time you must spend in front of the
computer instead of behind the camera lens.
 To get the full benefit of Raw, you need software other than Nikon
ViewNX. The ViewNX software that ships free with your camera does
have a command that enables you to convert Raw files to JPEG or 
to TIFF, introduced in the preceding section. However, this free tool 
automates the process, making all those color, exposure, and other 
decisions for you — which pretty much defeats the purpose of shoot-
ing Raw.

Nikon Capture NX offers a sophisticated Raw converter, but it costs
about $150. If you own Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, how-
ever, you’re set; both include the converter that most people consider
one of the best in the industry. Watch the sale ads, and you can pick up
Elements for well under $100.
Of course, the D60 also offers an in-camera Raw converter, found on the
Retouch menu. But although it’s convenient, this tool isn’t the easiest to
use because you must rely on the small camera monitor when making
judgments about color, exposure, sharpness, and so on. The in-camera
tool also doesn’t offer the complete cadre of features available in Capture
NX and other converter software utilities.
Chapter 8 offers more information on the in-camera conversion process
and also offers a look at the Adobe converter found in Photoshop
Elements. 
 Raw files are larger than JPEGs. The type of file compression that Raw
applies doesn’t degrade image quality, but the tradeoff is larger files. In
addition, Nikon Raw files are always captured at the maximum resolution
available on the camera, even if you don’t really need all those pixels. For
both reasons, Raw files are significantly larger than JPEGs, so they take
up more room on your memory card and on your computer’s hard drive
or other picture-storage device. (See the sidebar “How many pictures can
I fit on my memory card” for details.)
Are the disadvantages worth the gain? Only you can decide. But before you
make up your mind, refer to Figure 3-8 and compare the JPEG Fine example
with its NEF (Raw) counterpart. Be sure that you judge the two on the basis of
quality rather than color, contrast, and exposure, which are due to adjustments
I may have made during the conversion process and not the choice of file
format. You may be able to detect some subtle quality differences when you
really study the two, but a casual viewer likely would not, especially if shown
the entire example images at normal print sizes rather than the greatly magni-
fied views shown in the figure. I took Figure 3-7, for example, using JPEG Fine.
That said, I do shoot in the Raw format when I’m dealing with tricky lighting
because doing so gives me more control over the final image exposure. For
example, if you use a capable Raw converter, you can specify how bright you
want the brightest areas of your photo to appear and how dark you prefer
your deepest shadows. With JPEG, the camera makes those decisions, which
can potentially limit your flexibility if you try to adjust exposure in your
photo editor later.
I also go Raw if I know that I’m going to want huge prints of a subject. But keep
in mind: I’m a photography geek, I have all the requisite software, and I don’t
really have much else to do with my time than process scads of Raw images.
Oh, and I’m a bit of a perfectionist, too. (Although I’m more bothered by imper-
fections than I am motivated to remove them. A lazy perfectionist, if you will.)
69
Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
If you do decide to try Raw shooting, you can select from two options on
your camera’s Image Quality menu: 
 NEF (RAW): This setting produces a single Raw file. Again, you don’t
have a choice of Image Size settings; the camera always captures the 
file at the maximum resolution (10.2MP).
 NEF (RAW)+JPEG Basic: This setting produces two files: the standard
Raw file plus a file stored in the JPEG Basic format. At first glance, this
option sounds great: You can share the JPEG online or get prints made
and then process your Raw files when you have time.
The problem is that, like the Raw file, the JPEG copy is captured at that
very high pixel count — which is too large for onscreen viewing. That
means that you have to edit the JPEG file anyway to trim down the pixel
count before online sharing, so the time savings is reduced. And
although the JPEG copy contains enough pixels for generating a good
print, the high level of compression applied at the basic setting may lead
to disappointing print quality. So in my mind, this combo format option
is a washout. But do your own tests to see whether these print quality
or display size issues are a concern to you.
My take: Choose JPEG Fine or NEF (Raw)
At this point, you may be finding all this technical goop a bit much — I recog-
nize that panicked look in your eyes — so allow me to simplify things for you.
Until you have time or energy to completely digest all the ramifications of
JPEG versus Raw, here’s a quick summary of my thoughts on the matter:
 If you require the absolute best image quality and have the time and
interest to do the Raw conversion, shoot Raw. See Chapter 8 for more
information on the conversion process.
 If great photo quality is good enough for you, you don’t have wads of
spare time, or you aren’t that comfortable with the computer, stick 
with JPEG Fine. 
 Stay away from JPEG Normal and Basic. The tradeoff for smaller files
isn’t, in my opinion, worth the risk of compression artifacts. As with my
recommendations on image size, this fits the “better safe than sorry” 
formula: You never know when you may capture a spectacular, enlarge-
ment-worthy subject, and it would be a shame to have the photo spoiled
by compression defects.
Adjusting the Image Quality setting
The easy part of understanding the Image Quality option is actually selecting
the setting you want to use. As with the Image Size options, you can access
the Image Quality options in two ways:

 Quick Settings display: First, display the Shooting Info screen by press-
ing the shutter button halfway or by pressing the Zoom button. Then
press the Zoom button again to get to the Quick Settings display.
Highlight the Image Quality option, as shown on the left in Figure 3-9,
and then press OK to display the screen shown on the right in the 
figure. Highlight the option you want to use and press OK again. Note
that as when you change the Image Size via the Quick Settings display,
the second screen shows you the file size that will result from your
selected quality setting. In the right image in Figure 3-9, for example, the
file size is 7.3MB. The other value indicates how many more pictures will
fit on your memory card at the current setting.
 Shooting menu: Press the Menu button, highlight the Shooting menu,
and then highlight Image Quality, as shown on the left in Figure 3-10.
Press OK to access the quality options, as shown on the right, select
your choice, and press OK again.
Figure 3-9: You can set the file type (JPEG or Raw) via the Quick Settings display.
Figure 3-10: The Shooting menu also offers access to the Image Quality option.

Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size

72
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Don’t be confused by the fact that the format names presented via the Quick
Settings display differ from the “official” names on the Shooting menu; the
Quick Settings display simply uses shortened versions of those names. The
top and bottom format options on the Quick Settings screen deliver Raw files;
the three middle choices are the JPEG format options.
As you adjust format, remember that this setting and the resolution (Image
Size) setting together determine file size and picture quality. As a reminder,
notice that the two are listed together in the Quick Settings display with the
category labeled Qual (for Quality), as shown on the left in Figure 3-9.
If you combine low resolution with the JPEG Basic setting, expect teeny files
but not-so-hot picture quality. On the flip side, selecting JPEG Fine or Raw
together with the Large resolution setting produces the best quality but also
larger files.
Maintaining a pristine view
Often lost in discussions of digital photo
defects — compression artifacts, pixelation,
and the like — is the impact of plain-old dust
and dirt on picture quality. But no matter what
camera settings you use, you aren’t going to
achieve great picture quality with a dirty lens.
So make it a practice to clean your lens on a
regular basis, using one of the specialized
cloths and cleaning solutions made expressly
for that purpose.
If you continue to notice random blobs or hair-
like defects in your images (refer to the last
example in Figure 3-1), you probably have a dirty
image sensor. That’s the part of your camera
that does the actual image capture — the digi-
tal equivalent of a film negative, if you will.
Your D60 offers an automated, internal sensor-
cleaning mechanism. By default, this automatic
cleaning happens every time you turn the camera
on or off. You also can request a cleaning session
at any time via the Clean Image Sensor command
on the Setup menu. (Chapter 1 has details on this
menu option.)
But if you frequently change lenses in a dirty
environment, the internal cleaning mechanism
may not be adequate, in which case a manual
sensor cleaning is necessary. You can do this
job yourself, but . . . I don’t recommend it. Image
sensors are pretty delicate beings, and you can
easily damage them or other parts of your
camera if you aren’t careful. Instead, find a local
camera store that offers this service. In my area
(central Indiana), sensor cleaning costs from
$30–$50. 
One more cleaning tip: Never — and I mean
never — try to clean any part of your camera
using a can of compressed air. Doing so can not
only damage the interior of your camera, blow-
ing dust or dirt into areas where it can’t be
removed, but also crack the external monitor.

ithout question, my favorite thing about digital photography is being
able to view my pictures on the camera monitor the instant after I
shoot them. No more guessing whether I captured the image I wanted or 
I need to try again; no more wasting money on developing and printing 
pictures that stink. In fact, this feature alone was reason enough for me to
turn my back forever on my closetful of film photography hardware
and all the unexposed film remaining from my predigital days.
But simply seeing your pictures is just the start of the
things you can do when you switch your D60 to play-
back mode. You also can review all the camera set-
tings you used to take the picture, display graphics
that alert you to serious exposure problems, and
add file markers that protect the picture from acci-
dental erasure. This chapter tells you how to use all
these playback features and more.
After you explore these playback functions, be sure to
also visit Chapter 9, which covers some additional ways
to view your images, including how to create slide shows,
display your photos on a television screen, and turn a series
of photos into a stop-motion movie.
Inspecting Your Pictures
After you take a picture, it automatically appears briefly on the camera moni-
tor. (At least, it does if you enable the Image Review option found on the
Custom Setting menu, as I suggest in Chapter 1.)

74
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
To get a longer look at your photos, switch the camera to playback mode. The
next sections explain how to enter and exit said mode, review your photos,
and customize a few aspects of how the camera displays your images.
Setting Playback menu options
Figure 4-1 introduces you to the
Playback menu, which offers only six
options. Of those six, only the first
three specifically relate to viewing
your pictures on the camera monitor.
The final three relate to creating digi-
tal slide shows, viewing stop-motion
movies, and printing directly from a
memory card, all of which you can
explore in Chapter 9.
The next two sections discuss the
Playback Folder and Rotate Tall
options, both of which work in con-
junction with related options on the
Setup menu. For details on the Delete
option, see “Deleting Photos,” near the end of this chapter.
To access menus, press the Menu button. Then use the Multi Selector and 
the OK button to navigate through the menus and select options therein.
Chapter 1 has more information, if you need help.
Selecting a playback folder 
When your camera records images onto your memory card, it organizes the pic-
tures into folders that are assigned generic names: 100NCD60, 101NCD60, and so
on. By using the Folders option on the Setup menu, you can create your own,
customized folder storage system. I cover this advanced feature in Chapter 11.
If you do create custom folders, you then must select the folder you want to view
when you switch to playback mode. You do this via the Playback menu, like so:
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight the Playback Folder, as
shown in the first screen in Figure 4-2.
2. Press OK to display the Playback Folder options, shown in the second
screen in the figure.
You get two choices:
Figure 4-1: The Playback menu contains just
a handful of options.

• Current: With this option enabled, you can view only images stored
in the folder that’s currently selected for the Folders option on the
Setup menu.
• All: Choose this option to view all images in all folders.
Figure 4-2: Specify which folder of images you want to view.
3. Highlight the option you want to use and press OK to return to the
Playback menu.
Again, you don’t need to worry about this whole thing unless you create
custom folders, as covered in Chapter 11. If you stick with the default folder
structure, you can view all your pictures regardless of whether you set the
Playback Folder option to Current or All.
Enabling automatic picture rotation
When you take a picture, the camera can record the image orientation — that
is, whether you held the camera normally, creating a horizontally-oriented
image, or turned the camera on its side to shoot a vertically-oriented photo.
This bit of data is simply added into the picture file.
During playback, the camera reads the data and automatically rotates the
image so that it appears in the upright position in the monitor, as shown on
the left in Figure 4-3. The image is also automatically rotated when you view it
in Nikon ViewNX, Capture NX, and some other photo programs that can inter-
pret the data. Your other option is to disable this feature, in which case the
image appears sideways in the monitor, as shown in the right example, and
when you view it in the aforementioned photo software.
75
Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos

76
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Official photo lingo uses the term portrait orientation to refer to vertically-
oriented pictures and landscape orientation to refer to horizontally oriented
pictures.
Figure 4-3: You can display vertically-oriented pictures in their upright position (left) or
sideways (right).
Enabling auto image rotation requires a trip to both the Setup menu and the
Playback menu. Take these steps:
1. On the Setup menu, enable Auto Image Rotation, as shown in the left
image in Figure 4-4.
Don’t see Auto Image Rotation on the menu? Scroll to the very beginning
of the Setup menu and set the CSM/Setup Menu option (not shown in the
figure) to Full. As covered in Chapter 1, some menu items are hidden
unless you take this step.
Figure 4-4: Visit the Setup and Playback menus to enable image rotation.

2. Display the Playback menu.
Again, Chapter 1 explains the process of using menus, if you need help.
3. Enable the Rotate Tall option, as shown in the right image in Figure 4-4.
Now your camera displays vertically oriented pictures as shown in the
left image in Figure 4-3.
If you shoot pictures with the lens pointing directly up or down, the camera
may incorrectly sense the picture orientation. If that issue is a bother to you,
just turn off Auto Image Rotation on the Setup menu before you shoot the pic-
tures. The camera then won’t record the orientation information as part of
the picture file.
Displaying your pictures: The basics
After you establish the two playback preferences covered in the preceding
sections, the following steps walk you through the basics of viewing your 
pictures:
1. Press the Playback button, found on the left side of the monitor and
shown in the margin here.
The monitor displays the last picture you took, along with some picture
data, such as the frame number of the photo.
To find out how to interpret the picture information and specify what
type of data you want to see, see the upcoming section “Viewing picture
data.” If you’re curious now, though, or if the picture data is hampering
your ability to see the picture itself, press the Multi Selector up or down
to cycle through the picture data display formats.
2. To scroll through your pictures, rotate the Command dial or press the
Multi Selector right or left.
I highlighted the Command dial and Multi Selector in Figure 4-5. Press the
Multi Selector right or rotate the Command dial to the right to advance to
the next picture; go the other direction to view previous pictures.
3. To return to picture-taking mode, press the shutter button halfway
and then release it.
These steps assume that the camera is currently set to display a single photo
at a time, as shown in Figure 4-5. You can also display multiple images at a
time; the next section tells all.

Figure 4-5: Navigate and inspect your photos using these controls.
Viewing multiple images at a time
If you want to quickly review and compare several photos, you can set the
camera to display thumbnails of four photos, as shown in the top image in
Figure 4-6, or nine photos, as shown in the lower image. The key is the
Thumbnail button, found just under the Menu button and shown in the
margin here. Just press the button to cycle from single-picture view to four-
picture view; press again to switch to nine-picture view.
To reduce the number of thumbnails from nine to four, press the Zoom
button, located one step down from the Thumbnail button and shown cling-
ing to the margin here. To go from four thumbnails to the single-picture view,
press the button again.
You can also just press the OK button to shift from four- or nine-image view
to single-frame view.
Playback button
Multi Selector
Command dial

While you’re viewing images in the
four- or nine-thumbnail mode, use
these techniques to navigate your
photo collection:
 Scroll through your pictures.
Rotate the Command dial or
press the Multi Selector right 
or left.
 Select an image. As you scroll
through your pictures, a yellow
highlight box indicates the cur-
rently selected image. For exam-
ple, in the top image in Figure
4-6, Image 18 is selected. To
select a different image, just
keep using the Command dial 
or Multi Selector to scroll the
display until the highlight box
surrounds the image.
 View the selected image at the
full-frame size. Again, either
press the OK button or press 
the Zoom button to return to
full-frame view.
Zooming in for 
a closer view
By pressing the Zoom button, posing here in the margin, you can more closely
inspect a portion of the onscreen image. This feature comes in especially
handy for checking small details, such as whether anyone’s eyes are closed in
a group portrait, for example, and for determining whether the subject of your
picture is sharply focused.
Here’s the scoop on this feature:
 Zoom in. You can enlarge an image display to a maximum of 13 to 25
times its original size, depending on the resolution (pixel count) of the
photo. Just keep pressing the Zoom button until you reach the magnifi-
cation you want.
 View another part of the picture. Whenever the image is magnified, a little
navigation thumbnail showing the entire image appears briefly in the
lower-right corner of the monitor, as shown in Figure 4-7. The yellow out-
line in this picture-in-picture image indicates the area that’s currently
consuming the rest of the monitor space.

Figure 4-6: You can view four or nine
thumbnails at once.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 4-7: Use the Multi Selector to move the yellow outline over the 
area you want to inspect.
Use the Multi Selector to scroll the display to view a different portion of
the image. Press up to scroll up, left to scroll left, and so on. After a few
seconds, the navigation thumbnail disappears; just press the Multi
Selector in any direction to redisplay it.
 View more images at the same magnification. Here’s an especially neat
trick: While the display is zoomed, you can rotate the Command dial to
display the same area of the next photo at the same magnification. So,
for example, if you shot that group portrait several times, you can easily
check each one for shut-eye problems.
 Zoom out. To zoom out to a reduced magnification, press the Thumbnail
button.
 Return to full-frame view. When you’re ready to return to the normal
magnification level, you don’t need to keep pressing the Thumbnail
button until you’re all the way zoomed out. Instead, just press the 
OK button, which quickly returns you to the standard view.
Viewing picture data
In playback mode, the camera monitor displays one of five different styles of
picture information along with the image. The next sections explain the
details you can glean from each of the picture information display modes.
To cycle between the picture information modes, press the Multi Selector up
or down. (In case you missed it, the Multi Selector is the round, four-way
toggle switch with the OK button in the middle, shown earlier in Figure 4-5.)

File Information mode
In this display mode, the monitor offers a data readout similar to what you
see in Figure 4-8. The following three bits of info may appear at the top of 
the monitor:
 Retouch Indicator: This icon appears in the upper-left corner of the
monitor if you used any of the Retouch menu options to alter the image.
(I cover the Retouch features in Chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11.)
 Protect Status: If you see the little key icon, shown in Figure 4-8 to the
right of the Retouch Indicator icon, you previously used the camera’s
file-protection feature to prevent the image from being accidentally
deleted. See “Protecting Photos,” later in this chapter, to find out how 
to accomplish that feat.
 Frame Number/Total Pictures: In the upper-right corner of the display,
you see two numbers separated by a slash. The first value indicates the
frame number of the currently displayed photo; the second tells you 
the total number of pictures on the memory card.
Jumping to the data underneath the image, you can view these details:
 Folder Name: Folders are named automatically by the camera unless you
create custom folders, an advanced trick you can explore in Chapter 11.
 Filename: The camera also automatically names your files. Filenames
end with a three-letter code that usually represents the file format,
which is either JPG (for JPEG) or NEF (for Camera Raw) and depends 
on the Image Quality setting you select. Chapter 3 discusses these two
formats. If you create a dust-off reference image, an advanced feature
explained in Chapter 1, the camera instead uses the extension NDF. And
if you create a stop-motion movie, a project you can tackle in Chapter 9,
the file extension is AVI, which represents a digital-movie file format.
The first three letters of the assigned filenames also vary. Here’s what
the possible three-letter codes indicate:
• DSC: This code means “normal, plain-old picture file.” 
• SSC: This trio appears at the beginning of files that you create 
with the Small Picture option on the Retouch menu. Chapter 9 
discusses this feature, which creates a copy of an image in a size
that’s suitable for Web use.
• ASC: Stop-motion movie files begin with this three-letter code.
• CSC: This code is used for images that you alter using other Retouch
menu features. For example, I applied the Quick Retouch feature to
the image in Figure 4-8, so the filename begins with CSC, and the
Retouch Indicator appears in the top-left corner of the monitor.
81
Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos

82
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
• _ (underscore): If you change the Color Mode setting on the
Optimize Image menu to the Adobe RGB color profile, a topic you
can investigate in Chapter 6, an underscore character precedes the
filename. (The exception is for dust-off reference photos, which
don’t use the underscore.)
 Date and Time: Just below the folder and filename info, you see the date
and time that you took the picture. Of course, the accuracy of this data
depends on whether you set the camera’s date and time values correctly,
which you do via the Setup menu. Chapter 1 has details.
 Image Quality: Here you can see which Image Quality setting you used
when taking the picture. Again, Chapter 3 has details, but the short story
is this: Fine, Normal, and Basic are the three JPEG recording options,
with Fine representing the highest JPEG quality. The word Raw indicates
that the picture was recorded in the Nikon Camera Raw format, NEF.
 Image Size: This value tells you the image resolution, or pixel count. See
Chapter 3 to find out about resolution and how it affects print quality,
onscreen display size, and the picture file size.

Shooting Data display mode
This mode actually presents you with two screens of information, which you
toggle between by pressing the Multi Selector up and down. Figure 4-9 shows
you the two screens, referred to in the Nikon manual as Shooting Data Page 1
and Shooting Data Page 2.
The two screens list all the critical camera settings you used to take the pic-
ture: shutter speed, aperture, white balance, and so on. Chapters in Part II
give you the background you need to decode all of this data, but I do want to
call your attention to a couple of factoids now:
Figure 4-9: You can view the camera settings used to capture the image in Shooting Data
display mode.
 The top-left corner of the monitor shows the Protect Status and Retouch
Indicator icons, described in the preceding section. If you don’t see these
icons, don’t worry; it simply means that you didn’t protect or retouch the
photo.
 The current frame number, followed by the total number of images on
the memory card, appears in the lower-right corner of the display.
 The Comment item, which is the final item on the second screen, con-
tains a value only if you used the Image Comment feature on the Setup
menu. I cover this option in Chapter 11. The data screen displays only
the first 15 letters of any comment you create.
 If the ISO value (on screen 2) appears in red, the camera is letting you
know that it automatically overrode the ISO setting that you selected in
order to produce a good exposure. This flag occurs only when you shoot
in an advanced exposure mode (P, S, A, or M) and only if you enabled
auto-ISO adjustment through the Custom Setting menu. See Chapter 5
for details on ISO and automatic ISO adjustment.
83
Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Active D-Lighting and Retouch History display mode
This mode simply adds a third page
of information, shown in Figure 4-10,
to the two that you can display in the
Shooting Data mode. The first item on
the page lets you know whether you
took the picture with Active D-
Lighting enabled; if so, the word Auto
appears. Otherwise, the word Off
appears, as shown in the figure. The
Retouch item lists any editing fea-
tures that you may have applied from
the Retouch menu. You also see the
Protect Status, Retouch Indicator, and
Frame Number/Total Pictures values
that are standard in all view modes.
(See the earlier section “File
Information display mode” for details.)
Highlight display mode
One of the most difficult photo problems to correct in a photo editing pro-
gram is known as blown highlights in some circles and clipped highlights in
others. In plain English, both terms mean that highlights — the brightest
areas of the image — are so overexposed that areas that should include a
variety of light shades are instead totally white. For example, in a cloud
image, pixels that should be light to very light gray become white due to
overexposure, resulting in a loss of detail in those clouds.
In Highlight display mode, areas that
fall into this category blink in the
camera monitor. This warning is a
great feature because simply viewing
the image isn’t always a reliable way
to gauge exposure; the relative
brightness of the monitor and the
ambient light in which you view it
affect the appearance of the image
onscreen.
Along with the blinking highlight
warning, you see the standard bits of
information in this mode: the Protect
Status, Retouch Indicator, and File
Number/Total Pictures values. The
label Highlight also appears to let you know the current display mode, as
shown in Figure 4-11.
For details on correcting this exposure problem, visit Chapter 5.
Figure 4-11: In Highlight mode, blinking areas
indicate blown highlights.
Figure 4-10: Check this screen to see whether
Active D-Lighting was enabled when you took
the picture.

Histogram display mode
This display mode offers an even more detailed analysis of the image expo-
sure. A histogram — that chart-like thing labeled in Figure 4-12 — indicates
the distribution of shadows, highlights, and midtones (areas of medium
brightness) in your image. Photographers use the term tonal range to
describe this aspect of their pictures.
The horizontal axis of the graph represents the possible picture brightness
values, from the darkest shadows on the left to the brightest highlights on
the right. And the vertical axis shows you how many pixels fall at a particular
brightness value. A spike indicates a heavy concentration of pixels. For 
example, in Figure 4-12, the histogram shows that most of the image pixels
are clustered in the range just above medium brightness. 
As with the Highlight display, the histogram is provided to give you a way to
gauge exposure that’s a little more reliable than simply eyeballing the image
on the monitor. Remember, if you adjust the brightness of the monitor or the
ambient light affects the display brightness, you may not get the real story on
exposure.
Figure 4-12: The histogram indicates the tonal range of your image, 
ranging from shadows on the left to highlights on the right.

85
Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos

86
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
I suggest that you check both the histogram and the Highlight display, though,
when you’re concerned about overexposure. If an image contains only a small
area of blown highlights, the histogram may indicate only a very small pixel
population at the brightest end of the spectrum, leading you to assume that
you’re okay in the exposure department. But if those blown highlights happen
to fall in an important part of your image — someone’s face, for example —
they can wreck your picture.
Also keep in mind that there is no one “perfect” histogram that you should
try to achieve. Instead, you need to interpret the histogram with respect to
the amount of shadows, highlights, and midtones that comprise your subject.
For example, an initial look at the histogram in Figure 4-12 might lead you to
worry that your image is lacking in contrast because most of the pixels are
clustered in one area, and there aren’t a lot of strong shadows or very bright
highlights. But the histogram actually makes sense for this particular image.
(Refer to Figure 4-11 for a look at the whole scene.) The subject contains very
few dark areas, so you wouldn’t expect to see many pixels showing up in the
shadows range. And because a large portion of the scene is that medium-
bright sky, the number of pixels that fall at the highlight end of the histogram
is low by comparison. You should pay attention, however, if you see a very
high concentration of pixels at the far right or left end of the histogram, which
can indicate a seriously overexposed or underexposed image, respectively.
For more information about exposure, visit Chapter 5.
Deleting Photos
You can erase pictures from the memory card in your camera in three ways,
as explained in the following sections.
If you “locked” a picture file by using the Protect feature described later in
this chapter, you must remove the protection before you can delete the
image, no matter which of these three methods you choose.
Deleting the currently displayed photo
In full-frame view, you can erase the image that’s currently on the screen by
pressing the Delete button, labeled in Figure 4-13 and shown in the margin
just for good measure. You see a message asking whether you really, really
want to erase that picture, as shown in the figure. If you do, press the Delete
button again. Or to cancel out of the process, press the Playback button.
This technique also works in multiple-thumbnail view. In the latter view, 
use the Multi Selector to highlight the picture you want to erase before you
press the Delete button.

Figure 4-13: Press the Delete button to display this confirmation screen; 
press again to dump the picture for good.
If you accidentally erase a picture, don’t panic — you may be able to restore
it by using data-restoration software such as MediaRecover ($30, www.media
recover.com) or Lexar Image Rescue (also $30, www.lexar.com). But in order
to have a chance, you must not take any more pictures or perform any other
operations on your camera while the current memory card is in it. If you do,
you may overwrite the erased picture data for good and eliminate the possi-
bility of recovering the image.
Deleting all photos
For this operation, you need to display the Playback menu and highlight
Delete, as shown in the first image in Figure 4-14. Press OK to display the two
options shown in the second image. Select the All option and then press the
Multi Selector right. You then see a confirmation screen that asks you to
verify that you want to delete all of your images. Select Yes and press OK.
This step deletes only the pictures in the folder that is currently selected via
the Playback Folder option on the Playback menu. See the section “Selecting
a playback folder” earlier in this chapter for information. (Unless you created
custom folders, a feature I cover in Chapter 11, you don’t need to worry
about this issue.)

Figure 4-14: To delete all photos, use the Delete option on the Playback menu.
Deleting a batch of selected photos
To delete several selected pictures at once, take these steps:
1. Display the Playback menu, highlight Delete, and press OK.
You see the Delete screen shown in the second image in Figure 4-14, in
the preceding section.
2. Highlight the Selected option and press the Multi Selector right.
You see a screen that displays thumbnails of your images, as shown in
Figure 4-15.
3. Select the first image that you want to mark for deletion.
The image surrounded by the yellow box is the currently selected image.
Press the Multi Selector right or left to scroll through your images until
the highlight appears on the first one you want to delete. (You can also
rotate the Command dial, but in this case, doing so jumps you to the
next screenful of images instead
of simply highlighting the next
image.)
4. To mark an image for deletion,
press the Multi Selector up.
A little trash can icon, the universal
symbol for delete, appears on the
thumbnail, as shown in Figure 4-15.
5. To remove the delete marker
from an image, highlight the
image and press the Multi
Selector down.
The trash can icon disappears,
and your image is no longer
scheduled for deletion.
Delete icon
Figure 4-15: Press the Multi Selector up and
down to select and deselect images.

By pressing the Zoom button, you can get a temporary, full-frame view of
the highlighted image. When you release the button, the display reverts
to thumbnail view.
6. After marking all the images you want to delete, press OK.
You see a confirmation screen telling you the total number of pictures
marked for deletion and asking permission to zap those images to digital
oblivion.
7. Select Yes from the confirmation screen and press OK.
The camera trashes those photos and returns you to the Playback menu.
Protecting Photos
You can protect pictures from accidental erasure by giving them protected
status. After you take this step, the camera doesn’t allow you to erase a pic-
ture by using either the Delete button or the Delete option on the Playback
menu.
Formatting your memory card, however, does erase even protected pictures.
See the nearby sidebar for more about formatting.
The picture protection feature comes in especially handy if you share a
camera with other people. You can protect pictures so that those other
people know that they shouldn’t delete your super-great images to make
room on the memory card for their stupid, badly photographed ones. (This
step isn’t foolproof, though, because anyone can remove the protected 
status from an image.)
Perhaps more importantly, when you protect a picture, it shows up as a “read
only” file when you transfer it to your computer. Files that have that read-
only status can’t be altered. Again, anyone with some computer savvy can
remove the status, but this feature can keep casual users from messing
around with your images after you’ve downloaded them to your system. Of
course, you have to know how to remove the read-only status yourself if you
plan on editing your photo in your photo software. (Hint: In Nikon ViewNX,
you can do this by clicking the image thumbnail and then choosing
File➪Protect Files➪Unprotect.)
Anyway, protecting a picture is easy: Just display the picture you want to pro-
tect in full-frame view — or in thumbnail view, use the Multi Selector to scroll
the display until the image is surrounded by the yellow box. Then press the
AE-L/AF-L button, labeled in Figure 4-16 and superglued to the margin here.
See the tiny key symbol that appears above the button on the camera? That’s
your reminder that you use the button to “lock” a picture. After you do, the
same symbol appears on the image display, as shown in Figure 4-16. To remove
the protection, display the image and then just press the button again.

Deleting versus formatting: What’s the diff?
In Chapter 1, I introduce you to the Format
Memory Card command, which lives on the
Setup menu and erases everything on your
memory card. What’s the difference between
erasing photos by formatting and by choosing
Delete from the Playback menu and then select-
ing the All option?
Well, in terms of pictures taken with your Nikon,
none. But if you happen to have stored other
data on the card, such as, say, a music file or a
picture taken on another type of camera, you
need to format the card to erase everything on
it. You can’t view those files on the monitor, so
you can’t use Delete to get rid of them.
Also keep in mind that the Delete function
affects only the currently selected folder of
camera images. As long as you use the default
folder system that the camera creates for you,
however, “currently selected folder” is the
same as “all images.” The section “Selecting a
playback folder,” earlier in this chapter, talks
more about this issue; Chapter 11 explains how
to create your own, custom folders.
One final — and important — note: Although
using the Protect feature (explained elsewhere
in this chapter) prevents the Delete function
from erasing a picture, formatting erases all 
pictures, protected or not.

A
s nice as it is to be able to set your Nikon to
automatic mode and let the camera handle
most of the photographic decisions, I encourage
you to also explore the advanced exposure modes
(P, S, A, and M). In these modes, you can make
your own decisions about the exposure, focus,
and color characteristics of your photo, which 
are key to capturing an image as you see it in your
mind’s eye. And don’t think that you have to be a
genius or spend years to be successful — adding
just a few simple techniques to your photographic
repertoire can make a huge difference in how
happy you are with the pictures you take.
The ﬁrst two chapters in this part explain every-
thing you need to know to do just that, providing
both some necessary photography fundamentals
as well as details about using the advanced expo-
sure modes. Following that, Chapter 7 helps you
draw together all the information presented ear-
lier in the book, summarizing the best camera 
settings and other tactics to use when capturing
portraits, action shots, landscapes, and close-up
shots.

y using the Auto and Digital Vari-Program exposure
modes, all covered in Chapter 2, you can take great
pictures with your D60. But to fully exploit your
camera’s capabilities — and, more important, to
exploit your creative capabilities — you need to
explore your camera’s four advanced exposure
modes, represented on the Mode dial by the letters
P, S, A, and M. 
This chapter explains everything you need to know
to start taking advantage of these four modes. First,
you get an introduction to the critical exposure con-
trols known as aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Adjusting
these settings enables you to not only fine-tune image expo-
sure but also affect other aspects of your image, such as depth
of field (the zone of sharp focus) and motion blur.
Following a review of those basics, you can explore specific D60 exposure fea-
tures, such as Exposure Compensation, metering modes, and flash options
available to you in the advanced exposure modes. In addition, this chapter

94
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
details the Active D-Lighting feature, which you can use in any of your
camera’s exposure modes to get better results when shooting high-
contrast scenes.
If you’re worried that this stuff is too complicated for you, by the way, don’t
be. Even in the advanced exposure modes, the camera provides you with
enough feedback that you’re never truly flying without a net. Between the 
in-camera support and the information in this chapter, you can easily master
aperture, shutter speed, and all the other exposure features — an important
step in making the shift from picture-taker to photographer.
Kicking Your Camera into Advanced Gear
The first step to taking the exposure reins is to set your camera’s Mode dial
to one of the four shooting modes highlighted in Figure 5-1: P, S, A, or M. You
also need to shoot in one of these modes to use certain other camera fea-
tures, such as manual white balancing, a color feature that you can explore 
in Chapter 6.
Each of the four modes offers a dif-
ferent way to control two critical
exposure settings, aperture and
shutter speed. Later in this chapter,
I explain these controls fully, but
here’s a quick introduction:
 P (programmed autoexpo-
sure): In this mode, the
camera selects both the aper-
ture and shutter speed for
you. But you can choose from
different combinations of the
two, which gives you creative
flexibility not possible in the
fully automatic exposure
modes discussed in Chapter 2. 
 S (shutter-priority autoexpo-
sure): In this mode, you select
a shutter speed, and the
camera chooses the aperture
setting that produces a good
exposure.
Advanced exposure modes
Figure 5-1: You can control exposure and other
picture properties fully only in P, S, A, or M mode.

 A (aperture-priority autoexposure): The opposite of shutter-priority
autoexposure, this mode asks you to select the aperture setting. The
camera then selects the appropriate shutter speed to properly expose
the picture.
 M (manual exposure): In this mode, you specify both shutter speed and
aperture. 
To sum up, the first three modes are semi-automatic exposure modes that are
designed to help you get a good exposure while still providing you with some
photographic flexibility. Note one important difference between P and the
other two semi-auto modes, however: Although you can select from different
combinations of aperture and shutter speed in that mode, the choices pre-
sented to you are limited to those that will properly expose the picture. In 
A and S modes, you can dial in settings that will result in an under- or over-
exposed image. (The camera will warn you about the potential problem, 
however.)
Manual mode puts all exposure control in your hands. But even in Manual
mode, the camera assists you by displaying a meter that tells you whether
your exposure settings are on target.
Again, I realize that the descriptions of these modes won’t make much sense
to you if you aren’t already schooled in the basics of exposure. If you are and
you just want to know the specifics of using these modes on your D60, flip
ahead to the section “Setting ISO, f-stop, and Shutter Speed,” later in this
chapter. For details about the aforementioned exposure warnings and meter,
see “Monitoring Exposure Settings” instead. Otherwise, the next several sec-
tions provide you with the fundamentals you need to make good use of the
advanced modes.
Introducing the Exposure Trio: Aperture, 
Shutter Speed, and ISO
Any photograph, whether taken with a film or digital camera, is created by
focusing light through a lens onto a light-sensitive recording medium. In a
film camera, the film negative serves as that medium; in a digital camera, 
it’s the image sensor, which is an array of light-responsive computer chips.
Between the lens and the sensor are two barriers, known as the aperture and
shutter, which together control how much light makes its way to the sensor.
The actual design and arrangement of the aperture, shutter, and sensor vary
depending on the camera, but Figure 5-2 offers an illustration of the basic
concept.
95
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

96
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
The aperture and shutter, along with
a third feature known as ISO, deter-
mine exposure — what most of us
would describe as the picture’s
overall brightness and contrast.
This three-part exposure formula
works as follows:
 Aperture (controls amount of
light): The aperture is an
adjustable hole in a diaphragm
set just behind the lens. By
changing the size of the aper-
ture, you control the size of 
the light beam that can enter
the camera. Aperture settings
are stated as f-stop numbers, 
or simply f-stops, and are
expressed with the letter f fol-
lowed by a number: f/2, f5.6,
f/16, and so on. The
lower the f-stop number,
the larger the aperture,
and the more light is
permitted into the
camera, as illustrated
by Figure 5-3.
The range of possible 
f-stops depends on your
lens and, if you use a
zoom lens, on the zoom
position (focal length)
of the lens. When you
use the kit lens sold
with the D60, you can
select apertures from
f/3.5–f/22 when zoomed all the way out to the shortest focal length
(18mm). When you zoom in to the maximum focal length (55mm), the
aperture range is f/5.6–f/36. (See Chapter 6 for a discussion of focal
lengths.)
 Shutter speed (controls duration of light): Set behind the aperture, the
shutter works something like, er, the shutters on a window. When you
aren’t taking pictures, the camera’s shutter stays closed, preventing light
from striking the image sensor, just as closed window shutters prevent
sunlight from entering a room. When you press the shutter button, the
shutter opens briefly to allow light that passes through the aperture to
hit the image sensor.

Figure 5-3: A lower f-stop number means a larger
aperture, allowing more light into the camera.

The length of time that the shutter is open is called the shutter speed and
is measured in seconds: 1/60 second, 1/250 second, 2 seconds, and so
on. Shutter speeds on the D60 range from 30 seconds to 1/4000 second
when you shoot without flash. If you do use a flash, the range is more
limited; see the sidebar “In sync: Flash timing and shutter speed,” near
the end of the chapter, for information. 
Should you want a shutter speed longer than 30 seconds, manual (M)
exposure mode also provides a feature called bulb exposure. At this set-
ting, the shutter stays open indefinitely as long as you press the shutter
button down.
 ISO (controls light sensitivity): ISO, which is a digital function rather
than a mechanical structure on the camera, enables you to adjust how
responsive the image sensor is to light. The term ISO is a holdover from
film days, when an international standards organization rated each film
stock according to light sensitivity: ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 800, and so on.
Film or digital, a higher ISO rating means greater light sensitivity, which
means that less light is needed to produce the image, enabling you to
use a smaller aperture, faster shutter speed, or both.
On the D60, you can select ISO settings of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, and
3200. Note that the ISO 3200 setting is called Hi 1.
Distilled down to its essence, the image-exposure formula is just this simple: 
 Aperture and shutter speed together determine the quantity of light that
strikes the image sensor.
 ISO determines how much the sensor reacts to that light.
The tricky part of the equation is that aperture, shutter speed, and ISO set-
tings affect your pictures in ways that go beyond exposure. You need to be
aware of these side effects, explained in the next section, to determine which
combination of the three exposure settings will work best for your picture.
Understanding exposure-setting side effects
You can create the same exposure with many combinations of aperture, shut-
ter speed, and ISO. You’re limited only by the aperture range allowed by the
lens and the shutter speeds and ISO range offered by the camera.
But as I hinted in the preceding section, the settings you select impact your
image beyond mere exposure, as follows:
 Aperture affects depth of field. The aperture setting, or f-stop, affects
depth of field, which is the range of sharp focus in your image. I intro-
duce this concept in Chapter 2, but here’s a quick recap: With a shallow
depth of field, your subject appears more sharply focused than faraway
objects; with a large depth of field, the sharp-focus zone spreads over a
greater distance.
97
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

98
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
As you reduce the aperture size — or stop down the aperture, in photo
lingo — by choosing a higher f-stop number, you increase depth of field.
As an example, take a look at the two images in Figure 5-4. For both
shots, I established focus on the foreground grass. Notice that the back-
ground in the first image, taken at an aperture setting of f/5.6, appears
noticeably softer than in the right example, taken at f/13. Aperture is 
just one contributor to depth of field, however; see Chapter 6 for the
complete story.
 Shutter speed affects motion blur. At a slow shutter speed, moving
objects appear blurry, whereas a fast shutter speed captures motion
cleanly. Compare the tall foreground grass in the images in Figure 5-4, for
example. A brisk wind was blowing when I took these pictures, and as a
result, the foreground grass is captured without blur only at the 1/160
second shutter speed used for the left image. How fast a speed you need
to freeze action depends on the speed of your subject, of course.
Figure 5-4: Stopping down the aperture (by choosing a higher f-stop number) increases depth 
of field, or the zone of sharp focus.
If your picture suffers from overall image blur, as in Figure 5-5, where
even stationary objects appear out of focus, the camera itself moved
during the exposure. As you increase the exposure time (by selecting a
slower shutter speed), you increase the risk of this problem because
f/5.6, 1/160, ISO 200
f/13, 1/60, ISO 400

you have to keep the camera still
for a longer period of time. Most
people enter the camera-shake
zone at speeds slower than about
1/50 second, although some
people have steadier hands than
others. I’m not one of them, as
my 1/20 second handheld exam-
ple in Figure 5-5 shows.
Some Nikon lenses, including the
18–55mm zoom lens sold in the
D60 kit, offer vibration reduction,
which is designed to help com-
pensate for small amounts of
camera shake. If you’re using a
lens from another manufacturer,
the feature may go by the name
image stabilization or something
similar. Whatever you call it, this
option can enable you to capture
sharp images at slightly slower
shutter speeds than normal when
handholding the camera. On the
D60 kit lens, just set the VR
switch on the side of the lens to
the On position to enable vibra-
tion reduction.
You also can use a tripod or otherwise steady the camera to lower the
chances of camera shake. If you do, however, turn off vibration reduc-
tion, if your lens offers it; the mechanism that makes the feature work
sometimes tries to adjust for movement that isn’t occurring, thereby
messing up your shot. (Note that some lenses have a special tripod set-
ting, too, so check your lens manual.)
See Chapter 6 for tips on solving other focus problems and Chapter 7 for
more help with action photography.
 ISO affects image noise. As ISO increases, making the image sensor more
reactive to light, you increase the risk of producing a defect called noise.
This defect looks like sprinkles of sand and is similar in appearance to
film grain, a defect that often mars pictures taken with high ISO film.
Noise can also be caused by very long exposure times.
Ideally, then, you should always use the lowest ISO setting on your
camera — 100 — to ensure top image quality. But sometimes, the light-
ing conditions simply don’t permit you to do so and still use the aper-
ture and shutter speeds you need. As an example, when I shot the
images in Figure 5-6, the lighting was so dim that I needed a shutter
speed of 1/15 second to properly expose the picture at ISO 100, even
with the aperture opened to f/5.6, the maximum for the lens I was using.

risk of all-over blur caused by camera shake.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
That shutter speed was much too slow for me to be able to successfully
handhold the camera, especially since this particular lens didn’t offer a
vibration reduction feature. Having no tripod with me, I had no choice
but to raise the ISO. Moving up to ISO 400 enabled me to use a shutter
speed of 1/80 and capture a sharp image.
Figure 5-6: Raising the ISO enabled me to use a fast enough shutter 
speed to get a sharp handheld shot.
f/5.6, 1/15 second, ISO 100
f/5.6, 1/80 second, ISO 400

Fortunately, you usually don’t encounter serious noise on the D60 until
you really crank up the ISO. Take a look at Figure 5-7, for example, which
shows you the same scene captured at ISO 100 and ISO 1600. I shot these
images in bright light that allowed a fast shutter — meaning, any noise
should be due to ISO rather than long exposure time. At this size, it’s dif-
ficult to detect much difference between the two images. And in fact,
you may even be able to get away with one step up the ladder, to the
max of ISO 3200, as I did for Figure 5-8, if you keep your print or display
size small — although some quality loss is noticeable in Figure 5-8 if you
compare it closely with the ISO 100 version in Figure 5-7.
But as with other image defects, noise becomes more apparent as you
enlarge the photo. To prove the point, Figure 5-9 shows you magnified
views of a bit of my statue scene captured at each of the D60’s ISO set-
tings. Noise also is easier to spot in areas of flat color, such as the sky
in my example, than in an area of busy detail, where the noise can hide
a little more. An object with a rough or textured surface, such as the
portion of the statue’s hand that you see in the figure, disguises noise
somewhat as well. 
Figure 5-7: When you keep the image print size small, the quality difference between ISO 100 
and ISO 1600 isn’t easy to detect.

Putting the f (stop) in focus
One way to remember the relationship between
f-stop and depth of field, or the range of dis-
tance over which objects remain in sharp focus,
is simply to think of the f as standing for focus.
A higher f-stop number produces a longer depth
of field, so if you want to extend the zone of
sharp focus to cover a larger distance from your
subject, you set the aperture to a higher f-stop.
Higher f-stop number, greater zone of sharp
focus.
Please don’t share this tip with photography
elites, who will roll their eyes and inform you
that the f in f-stop most certainly does not stand
for focus but for the ratio between the aperture
size and lens focal length — as if that’s helpful
to know if you’re not an optical engineer.
(Chapter 6 explains focal length, which is help-
ful to know.)
As for the fact that you increase the f-stop
number when you want a smaller aperture, well,
I’m still working on the ideal mnemonic tip for
that one. But try this in the meantime: Lower 
f-stop, larger aperture. Or maybe the opposite:
Raise the f-stop to reduce the aperture size and
restrict the light. (As I said, I’m working on it.)

Figure 5-9: Noise becomes more visible as you enlarge your images.
Long story short, understanding how aperture, shutter speed, and ISO 
affect your image enables you to have much more creative input over the
look of your photographs — and, in the case of ISO, to also control the qual-
ity of your images. (Chapter 3 discusses other factors that affect image 
quality.)
Doing the exposure balancing act
As you change any of the three exposure settings — aperture, shutter speed,
and ISO — one or both of the others must also shift in order to maintain the
same image brightness. If you want a faster shutter speed, for example, you
have to compensate with either a larger aperture, to allow in more light
during the shorter exposure, or a higher ISO setting, to make the camera
more sensitive to the light — or both. And as the preceding section explains,
changing these settings impacts your image in ways beyond exposure. So
when you boost that shutter speed, you have to decide whether you prefer
the shorter depth of field that comes with a larger aperture or the increased
risk of noise that accompanies a higher ISO. Figure 5-10 offers an illustration
to help you envision this balancing act.

Figure 5-10: When adjusting exposure, remember the side effects produced by different
aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings.
Everyone has their own approach to finding the right combination of aper-
ture, shutter speed, and ISO, and you’ll no doubt develop your own system as
you become more practiced at using the advanced exposure modes. In the
meantime, here’s how I handle things:
 I always use the lowest possible ISO setting unless the lighting condi-
tions are so poor that I can’t use the aperture and shutter speed I want
without raising the ISO.
 If my subject is moving (or might move, as with a squiggly toddler 
or antsy pet), I give shutter speed the next highest priority in my expo-
sure decision. I might choose a fast shutter speed to ensure a blur-free
photo or, on the flip side, select a slow shutter to intentionally blur 
that moving object, an effect that can create a heightened sense of
motion. (The waterfall photo in Chapter 7 offers an example of the 
latter technique.)
 For images of a non-moving subjects, I make aperture a priority over
shutter speed, setting the aperture according to the depth of field I have
in mind. For portraits, for example, I use a wide-open aperture (low

f-stop number) so that I get a short depth of field, creating a nice, soft
background for my subject. For landscapes, I go the opposite direction,
stopping down the aperture as much as possible to capture the subject
at the greatest depth of field.
I know that keeping all this straight is a little overwhelming at first, but the
more you work with your camera, the more the whole exposure equation will
make sense to you. You can find tips for choosing exposure settings for spe-
cific types of pictures in Chapter 7; keep moving through this chapter for
details on how to actually monitor and adjust aperture, shutter speed, and
ISO settings. And for specifics on selecting exposure settings in each of the
four advanced exposure modes, jump ahead to the section “Setting ISO, 
f-stop, and Shutter Speed.”
Monitoring Exposure Settings
You can view the current f-stop and
shutter speed in the viewfinder dis-
play, as shown in Figure 5-11, and in
the Shooting Info display, as shown in
Figure 5-12. (Remember, you can dis-
play the Shooting Info screen by
simply pressing the shutter button
halfway and then releasing it.
Pressing the Zoom button also cycles
the monitor from Shooting Info mode
to Quick Settings mode to off.) For the
ISO setting, you must look to the
Shooting Info display; the current set-
ting appears in the middle of the right
column of the display, as labeled in
Figure 5-12.
In the viewfinder, shutter speeds are
presented as whole numbers, even if
the shutter speed is set to a fraction
of a second. For example, for a shut-
ter speed of 1/125 second, you see
just the number 125 in the viewfinder, as in Figure 5-11. When the shutter
speed slows to 1 second or more, you see quote marks after the number — 
1” indicates a shutter speed of 1 second, 4” means 4 seconds, and so on. 
That inch-mark system is used both in the viewfinder and in the Shooting 
Info display.

Note also the gold, circular graphic
on the left side of the Shooting Info
display, labeled Aperture icon in
Figure 5-12. That circle is a visual 
representation of the aperture set-
ting, just like the ones you see in
Figure 5-3, earlier in the chapter. As
you choose a lower f-stop number,
the circle expands, indicating that
you’re opening up the aperture.
Choose a higher f-stop number, and
the circle shrinks, indicating that
you’re stopping down the aperture.
(If you don’t see this graphic, visit
Chapter 11 to find out how to set the
Shooting Info display to the Graphic
option, which is what I use in figures
in this book.)
In addition to showing you the current shutter speed and f-stop, the view-
finder and Shooting Info screen offer a couple of other exposure cues, which
vary depending on whether you’re using P, S, A, or M exposure mode, as 
follows: 
 Exposure meter: An exposure meter is a little linear graphic that indi-
cates whether your current settings will properly expose the image.
Figure 5-13 gives you three examples. The minus-sign end of the meter
represents underexposure; the plus sign, overexposure. So if the little
notches on the meter fall to the right of 0, as in the left example in the
figure, the camera is alerting you that the image will be underexposed. If
the indicator moves to the left of 0, as in the middle example, the image
will be overexposed. The farther the indicator moves toward the plus or
minus sign, the greater the potential exposure problem.
As you adjust shutter speed, aperture, or ISO, the exposure meter
updates accordingly. When the meter shows a balanced exposure, as in
the third example in the figure, you’re good to go.

Figure 5-12: The gold circle is a graphical
representation of the aperture size.

The exposure meter appears only in the S, A, and M exposure modes.
And in S and A modes, the meter appears in both the viewfinder and
Shooting Info display only if the camera anticipates an exposure prob-
lem. In M exposure mode, the meter appears regardless. The meter 
does turn off in all three cases if you don’t press the shutter button for 
a period of time — 8 seconds, by default. (You can adjust that shut-off
time through the Auto Off Timers option on the Custom Setting menu if
you prefer.)
It’s also important to note that your D60 enables you to replace the
exposure meter with a rangefinder display, which is a focusing-distance
scale that may be helpful when you focus manually. When the Range-
finder option is turned Off, as it is by default, the display is used for
exposure metering and appears as shown in Figure 5-13. Chapter 6
explains more about the rangefinder display, which you enable via an
option on the Custom Setting menu.
 Exposure warning messages: In S and A exposure modes, a warning like
the one you see in the left screen in Figure 5-14 appears in the Shooting
Info display if the camera anticipates an exposure problem. In S, A, and
M modes, a blinking question mark also appears both at the bottom of
the Shooting Info display and in the viewfinder. The blinking question
mark indicates that if you press the Thumbnail button (located just
below the Menu button), you can display a Help screen that provides
possible solutions — usually, the camera suggests that you add flash, 
as in the right screen in Figure 5-14.
In addition, you may also see the letters Hi or Lo next to the exposure
meter to reinforce the message that your exposure will be too bright 
or dark.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Why no exposure meter in P mode? Well, remember that in P mode — 
programmed autoexposure — you can select from different combinations of
aperture and shutter speed that the camera presents to you. But the combi-
nations are limited to those that will produce a correct exposure, so the
meter would always reflect a proper exposure, thereby rendering it a little
pointless. You do get the under- or overexposure warnings in the Shooting
Info display and viewfinder if the light is such that the camera can’t select
any combination of aperture or shutter speed that will properly expose the
image, however.
One more word of advice about the exposure meter: Keep in mind that the
meter’s take on the issue may not always be the one you want to follow. First,
the meter bases its call on the current exposure metering mode. As covered
next, you can choose three different metering modes, and each one calcu-
lates exposure on a different area of the frame. So you need to review those
modes and see whether you and the meter agree as to which area of the pic-
ture is the most important in making the exposure calculation. Second, you
may want to purposely choose exposure settings that leave parts of the
image very dark or parts very light for creative reasons. For example, you
may want to shoot a backlit subject in silhouette, in which case you want
that subject to be underexposed. Again, depending on the metering mode,
the camera may not understand your creative intent and report an exposure
problem in the exposure meter. In other words, the meter is a guide, not a
dictator.
Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode
To fully interpret what your exposure meter tells you, you need to first know
which metering mode is active. (I know, there’s lots more to this whole expo-
sure thing than you thought, but hang with me — this particular bit of busi-
ness needn’t stress you out too much.)
Anyway, the metering mode determines which part of the frame the camera
analyzes to calculate the proper exposure. The metering mode affects the
meter reading you see in the viewfinder and Shooting Info display, as well as
the exposure settings that the camera chooses in any fully automatic shoot-
ing modes — as well as in the semi-auto modes (P, S, and A).
Your D60 offers three metering modes, described in the following list and rep-
resented in the Shooting Info display by the icons you see in the margins:
 Matrix metering: The camera analyzes the entire frame and then selects
an exposure that’s designed to produce a balanced exposure.
 Center-weighted metering: The camera bases exposure on the entire
frame but puts extra emphasis — or weight — on the center of the frame.

 Spot metering: The camera bases exposure only on the light that falls in
the currently active autofocus area. (Chapter 2 introduces autofocus
areas, which are indicated by the three brackets you see in the view-
finder.) For example, if the left focus bracket is active, exposure is based
on that area of the frame. However, if you set the autofocus area mode to
Closest Subject, your Nikon always meters exposure on the center focus
bracket.
As an example, Figure 5-15 shows the same image captured thee times, with
no changes to exposure settings between shots except to the metering mode.
In the Matrix example, the bright background caused the camera to select an
exposure that left the statue quite dark. Switching to center-weighted meter-
ing helped somewhat, but didn’t quite bring the statue out of the shadows.
Spot metering produced the best result as far as the statue goes, although the
resulting increase in exposure left the sky and background monument a little
washed out.
Figure 5-15: The metering mode determines which area of the frame the camera considers 
when calculating exposure.
You don’t have a choice of metering modes in Auto mode or any of the Digital
Vari-Program scene modes; the camera automatically uses matrix mode for
all shots. But in P, A, S, or M modes, you can specify which metering mode
you prefer. You can do so in two ways:
 Via the Quick Settings display: First, display the Shooting Info screen by
pressing the shutter button halfway or pressing the Zoom button. Then
press the Zoom button to shift from Shooting Info display mode into
Quick Settings display mode. Use the Multi Selector to highlight the
Metering Mode option, as shown in the left screen in Figure 5-16. Press
OK to display the second screen in the figure, highlight your metering-
mode choice, and press OK again.

Highlight the Metering option, as

In theory, the best practice is to
always check the metering mode
before you shoot and to choose the
one that best matches your exposure
goals. But in practice, that’s a bit of a
pain, not just in terms of having to
adjust yet one more capture setting
but in terms of having to remember
to adjust one more capture setting.
So here’s my advice: Until you’re really comfortable with all the other controls
on your camera, just stick with the default setting, which is matrix metering.
That mode produces good results in most situations, and, after all, you can
see in the monitor whether you disagree with how the camera metered or
exposed the image and simply reshoot after adjusting the exposure settings 
to your liking. This option, in my mind, makes the whole metering mode issue
a lot less critical than it is when you shoot with film.
The one exception to this advice might be when you’re shooting a series of
images in which a significant contrast in lighting exists between subject and
background, as in my examples here. Then, switching to center-weighted
metering or spot metering may save you the time of having to adjust the
exposure for each image.
Don’t forget that the Active D-Lighting feature, explained next, can also be a
huge help in properly exposing a high-contrast image. And if that’s not enough,
you can tweak the exposure even more after the fact using the D-Lighting filter
on the Retouch menu; see Chapter 10 for details on that option.
Figure 5-17: Or change the metering mode
via the Custom Setting menu.

Taking Advantage of Active D-Lighting
A scene like the one in Figure 5-18 presents the classic photographer’s chal-
lenge: Choosing exposure settings that capture the darkest parts of the sub-
ject appropriately causes the brightest areas to be overexposed. And if you
instead “expose for the highlights” — that is, set the exposure settings to
capture the brightest regions properly — the darker areas are underexposed.
Figure 5-18: Active D-Lighting enabled me to capture the shadows without blowing out the 
highlights.
In the past, you had to choose between favoring the highlights or the shad-
ows. But thanks to a feature than Nikon calls Active D-Lighting, you have a
better chance of keeping your highlights intact while better exposing the
darkest areas. In my seal scene, turning on Active D-Lighting produced a
brighter rendition of the darkest parts of the rocks and the seals, for exam-
ple, and yet the color in the sky didn’t get blown out as it did when I captured
the image with Active D-Lighting turned off. The highlights in the seal and 
in the rocks on the lower-right corner of the image also are toned down a 
tad in the Active D-Lighting version.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
To try out this feature, press and hold the Active D-Lighting button, located
near the shutter button and shown in the margin here. If you’re looking
through the viewfinder, the display temporarily reports the status of the fea-
ture, as shown on the left in Figure 5-19. And in the Shooting Info display, the
icon representing Active D-Lighting, labeled in the right image in the figure,
also becomes highlighted. While keeping the button pressed, just rotate the
Command dial to switch the feature on or off. When you release the Active 
D-Lighting button, the viewfinder display and Shooting Info display return to
their normal state.
Figure 5-19: Press the Active D-Lighting button while rotating the Command dial to turn the 
feature on and off.
Active D-Lighting actually does its thing in two stages. First, it selects expo-
sure settings that result in a slightly darker exposure than normal. This half
of the equation guarantees that you retain details in your highlights. Without
that adjustment, the brightest areas of the image might be overexposed, leav-
ing you with a batch of all-white pixels that really should contain a range of
tones from light to lighter to white. So a cloud, for example, would appear as
a big white blob, with no subtle tonal details to give it form.
After you snap the photo, the second part of the process occurs. During this
phase, the camera applies an internal software filter to brighten only the
darkest areas of the image. This adjustment rescues shadow detail, so that
you wind up with a range of dark tones instead of a big black blob.
This second stage of the process leads to the one drawback of using Active 
D-Lighting: The camera needs a few seconds to do its shadow-recovery work.
And during that time, you can’t take another shot. Unfortunately, that makes
Active D-Lighting a hindrance when you’re capturing action or otherwise
need to fire off shots in rapid succession.
Active D-Lighting icon

All isn’t necessarily lost, however, if the time lag imposed by Active D-Lighting
forces you to turn the feature off. After you finish shooting, you can apply the
D-Lighting filter from the Retouch menu, which also attempts to restore hidden
shadow details. Some photo editing programs, such as Adobe Photoshop
Elements and Photoshop, also have good shadow and highlight recovery fil-
ters. In either case, you’re better off setting the initial exposure settings to
record the highlights as you want them. It’s very difficult to bring back lost
highlight detail after the fact, but you typically can unearth at least a little bit 
of detail from the darkest areas of the image.
Setting ISO, f-stop, and Shutter Speed
If you want to control ISO, aperture (f-stop), or shutter speed, you must set the
camera Mode dial to either programmed autoexposure (P), shutter-priority
autoexposure (S), aperture-priority autoexposure (A), or manual exposure (M).
I explain each of these modes at the start of the chapter, but Table 5-1 offers 
a quick recap, along with a recommendation of when to use each mode. The
next sections provide specifics (finally, you say) on how to adjust ISO, aper-
ture, and shutter speed in all four modes.
The table uses the abbreviation AE for autoexposure. Most photography mag-
azines and other resources use this same abbreviation, so try to find a place
in your memory bank to store this little bit of camera lingo.

modes, or you simply want to
dial in specific aperture and
shutter speed settings as
quickly as possible.
Controlling ISO
The ISO setting, introduced at the start of this chapter, adjusts the camera’s
sensitivity to light. At a higher ISO, you can use a faster shutter speed or a
smaller aperture (higher f-stop number) because less light is needed to
expose the image. On the D60, the range of possible ISO settings is 100 
to 3200.
In addition to the main ISO control, you get two related features, Auto ISO
adjustment and a noise-reduction filter. The next three sections spell out 
the details on all three options.
Selecting an ISO value
First, the simple stuff: You can change the ISO setting either through the
Quick Settings display or the Shooting menu, as follows:
 Via the Quick Settings display: Display the Shooting Info screen, press
the Zoom button to shift to Quick Settings mode, and then navigate 
to the ISO setting, highlighted in the left image in Figure 5-20. Press 
OK to display the second screen in the figure. Select the setting you
want to use and press OK.
Figure 5-20: You can adjust ISO quickly via the Quick Settings display.

 Via the Shooting menu: Press
the Menu button, navigate to the
Shooting menu, and highlight 
the ISO Sensitivity option, as
shown in Figure 5-21. Press OK 
to display the available ISO set-
tings, highlight your choice, and
press OK again.
A couple of brief notes on this option:
 You can adjust ISO in any of the
camera’s exposure modes. But
you get different ISO options for
the Auto and Digital Vari-Program
modes than you do in the advanced exposure modes.
 In the fully automatic modes, the list of ISO options includes a setting
called Auto, which automatically adjusts ISO as needed as lighting condi-
tions change. This setting is the default for all the fully automatic modes,
and if you choose to shoot in those modes, Auto ISO isn’t a bad idea
because it ensures that the camera can select an appropriate shutter
speed and aperture for the mode you’re using. Say that you set the Mode
dial to the Sports setting to capture action, for example. If you’re shoot-
ing in dim lighting and you set the ISO to 100, the camera may be forced
to use a very slow shutter speed, thereby leaving your subject blurry. In
Auto mode, the camera will raise the ISO high enough to allow a fast
shutter speed. Of course, the downside in that scenario may be that the
high ISO will create a noisy image, but a noisy image is probably better
than a blurry image.
Note that any time you rotate the Mode dial from the P, S, A, or M setting
to one of the fully automatic modes, the camera resets the ISO setting to
Auto. 
 In the advanced exposure modes, the Shooting menu and Quick Settings
display don’t offer an Auto setting for ISO. But you can enable Auto ISO
adjustment through the Custom Setting menu if you want. In this case,
you can specify the circumstances in which you want the camera to play
with your ISO setting. See the next section for details.
 The highest ISO setting, ISO 3200, is called Hi 1 in the camera menus and
displays. You must scroll past the initial screenful of settings to get to
this option.
Choosing Hi 1 pretty much ensures that you’re going to have a noisy
image, which is why the camera also applies a noise-reduction filter to
your image after you shoot it — a feature that has its pros and cons, as
explained in the section after next. Again, if cranking the camera up to
ISO 3200 is the only way to capture the image, and you’d rather have a
noisy image than no image, Hi 1 is the answer. Otherwise, pass this one

Figure 5-21: You can also access the ISO

by and adjust shutter speed and aperture to get the exposure you want
instead. Even with the noise-removal feature, ISO 3200 images look
pretty ugly — just flip back to Figure 5-9 to see what I mean.
Considering Auto ISO adjustment
Although the ISO options available in the Shooting menu and Quick Settings
display don’t include an Auto setting when you work in the advanced expo-
sure modes, you do have the option of using that feature. It’s just buried a bit:
Specifically, you have to visit the Custom Setting menu. Highlight ISO Auto, as
shown on the left in Figure 5-22, and press OK to display the second screen in
the figure. Then just highlight On and press OK again. 
Figure 5-22: Visit the Custom Setting menu to disable automatic ISO adjustment.
After you take this step, the camera uses the ISO setting that you specify via
the Shooting menu or Quick Settings display if it determines that the setting is
appropriate. If not, it will adjust the ISO setting in the background as needed
to produce a good exposure. Depending on the light, the camera may bump
the setting as high as ISO 1600.To remind you that Auto ISO adjustment is
enabled, the letters ISO-A appear near the top of the Shooting Info display; in
the viewfinder, the words ISO Auto appear. If you see either of those reminders
blinking at you, the camera’s telling you that it plans on adjusting the ISO from
your selected setting. After taking a picture, you can tell whether any adjust-
ment was made by setting the playback display mode to Shooting Data. If the
ISO value appears red in the shooting data that’s displayed over the image,
the camera tweaked the ISO setting for you. (See Chapter 4 for details on view-
ing shooting data during image playback.)
Personally, I don’t turn on automatic ISO adjustment, however. Because
increasing ISO brings a higher risk of image noise, I don’t want the camera
making this decision for me. I prefer to be the one deciding whether to 

accept the possibility of noise or adjust the shutter speed or f-stop in
response to the lighting conditions.
If you do want to enable automatic ISO override for the advanced exposure
modes, at least take advantage of the two other controls on the ISO Auto
menu (refer to the right screen in Figure 5-22): Max Sensitivity and Min
Shutter Speed. With these options, you can specify the highest ISO setting the
camera may select when it does its thing; your choices are ISO 400, 800, and
1600. You can also set the minimum shutter speed at which the camera can
even adjust the ISO. Note that these settings affect only the P, A, S, and M
shooting modes.
Enabling the noise-reduction filter
A high ISO setting is just one cause of image noise. When you use a very slow
shutter speed — say, 1 second or more — the long exposure time can also
produce noise. Whatever the cause, your camera offers a built-in noise-
reduction filter, which is akin to the noise-correction filters found in some
photo editing software. This filter is applied after you take the picture, as 
the camera processes the image data and records it to your memory card.
Noise-reduction filters work primarily by applying a slight blur to the image.
Don’t expect this process to totally eliminate noise, and do expect some
resulting image softness. You may be able to get better results in a photo
editor because you can apply the noise-removal blurring just to the areas
where the problem is most noticeable — usually in areas of flat color or little
detail, such as skies. In addition, the noise filter slows down capture time
slightly, which can be problematic when you’re trying to shoot at a rapid pace.
If you want to experiment with noise
reduction, you enable it via the
Shooting menu, as illustrated in 
Figure 5-23.
Two key points on this feature:
 Even if you turn it on, the camera
applies noise reduction only
when you shoot at ISO 400 or
higher or set the shutter speed 
to 8 seconds or slower, or both.
 Even if you turn the feature off,
some noise reduction occurs
when you select ISO settings
above 800.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Adjusting aperture and shutter speed
To select aperture and shutter speed, start by pressing the shutter button
halfway. In P mode, the camera’s autoexposure mechanism does its thing and
presents its recommended aperture and shutter speed combination, which
you can see in the viewfinder display. In S mode, you see the f-stop that the
camera selects to go with the currently selected shutter speed; in A mode,
the opposite occurs. In manual (M) exposure mode, the meter simply reports
its take on the currently selected aperture and shutter speed. (See the earlier
section, “Monitoring Exposure Settings” for details.) Assuming that you’re
using autofocus, focus is established with your half-press of the shutter
button as well.
To adjust the aperture and shutter speed, you use the Command dial. Figure
5-24 labels the Command dial and also reminds you of where to find the cur-
rent aperture and shutter speed settings in the viewfinder.
Figure 5-24: As you use the Command dial to adjust settings (left), monitor them in the
viewfinder display (right).
The specific techniques for adjusting the settings vary depending on the
exposure mode (P, S, A, or M), as follows:
 P (programmed auto): Rotate the Command dial to select a different
combination of aperture and shutter speed.
Exposure Compensation button
Command dial
Shutter speed and f-stop

• To select a higher f-stop number (smaller aperture) and slower
shutter speed, rotate the dial to the left.
• To select a lower f-stop number (larger aperture) and faster shutter
speed, rotate the dial to the right.
The P* symbol that appears in the viewfinder and Shooting Info display
after you rotate the Command dial indicates that you adjusted the 
aperture/shutter speed settings from those the camera initially suggested.
To get back to the initial combo, rotate the Command dial until the symbol
disappears.
 S (shutter-priority autoexposure): Rotate the Command dial to the right
for a faster shutter speed; nudge it to the left for a slower speed.
As you change the shutter speed, the camera automatically adjusts the
aperture as needed to maintain what it considers the proper exposure.
Remember that as the aperture shifts, so does depth of field — so even
though you’re working in shutter-priority mode, keep an eye on the 
f-stop, too, if depth of field is important to your photo. Also note that in
extreme lighting conditions, the camera may not be able to adjust the
aperture enough to produce a good exposure at your current shutter
speed — again, possible aperture settings depend on your lens. So you
may need to compromise on shutter speed (or, in dim lighting, raise 
the ISO).
 A (aperture-priority autoexposure): Rotate the Command dial to the right
to stop down the aperture to a higher f-stop number. Rotate the dial to the
left to open the aperture to a lower f-stop number. As you do, the camera
automatically adjusts the shutter speed to maintain the exposure.
When you stop down the aperture, be careful that the shutter speed
doesn’t drop so low that you run the risk of camera shake if you hand-
hold the camera — unless you have a tripod handy, of course. And if
your scene contains moving objects, make sure that when you dial in
your preferred f-stop, the shutter speed that the camera selects is fast
enough to stop action (or slow enough to blur it, if that’s your creative
goal).
 M (manual exposure): In this mode, you select both aperture and shut-
ter speed, like so:
• To adjust shutter speed: Rotate the Command dial left for a slower
shutter speed; rotate right for faster shutter. 
• To adjust aperture: Press and hold the Exposure Compensation
button on top of the camera, shown in Figure 5-24, as you rotate
the Command dial. (See the little aperture symbol above the
button? That’s your cue as to the aperture-related function of the
button.) Rotate the dial to the right for a higher f-stop (smaller
aperture); rotate left to select a lower f-stop. Don’t let up on the
button as you rotate the Command dial; if you do, you instead
adjust shutter speed.
119
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

120
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Keep in mind that when you use P, S, or A modes, the settings that the camera
selects are based on what it thinks is the proper exposure. If you don’t agree
with the camera, you have two options: You can switch to manual exposure
mode and simply dial in the aperture and shutter speed that deliver the expo-
sure you want; or if you want to stay in P, S, or A mode, you can tweak the
exposure using the feature explained in the very next section.
Overriding Autoexposure Results 
with Exposure Compensation
When you set your camera to the P, S, or A modes, you can enjoy the benefits
of autoexposure support but still retain some control over the final, overall
exposure. If you think that the image the camera produced is too dark or too
light, you can use a feature known as Exposure Compensation.
This feature enables you to tell the camera to produce a darker or lighter
exposure than what its autoexposure mechanism thinks is appropriate. Best
of all, this feature is probably one of the easiest on the whole camera to
understand. Here’s all there is to it:
 Exposure Compensation settings are stated in terms of EV values, as in
+2.0 EV. On your D60, possible values range from +5.0 EV to –5.0 EV. 
(The EV stands for exposure value.)
 A setting of EV 0.0 results in no exposure adjustment.
 For a brighter image, you raise the EV value. The higher you go, the
brighter the image becomes.
 For a darker image, you lower the EV value. The picture becomes pro-
gressively darker with each step down the EV scale.
As an example, take a look at the first image in Figure 5-25. The initial expo-
sure selected by the camera left the balloon a tad too dark for my taste. So I
just amped the Exposure Compensation setting to EV +1.0, which produced
the brighter exposure on the right.
In Figure 5-26, I had the opposite problem. The exposure selected by the
camera left parts of the dog’s fur overexposed — notice the front legs and the
haunches. This time, an Exposure Compensation value of EV –0.7 provided a
better image.

Figure 5-25: For a brighter exposure than the autoexposure mechanism chooses, dial in a 
positive EV value.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Whatever your reason for adjusting the Exposure Compensation setting, you
can get the job done in two ways. Here’s the method that I find easiest:
1. Hold down the Exposure Compensation button on top of the camera.
As soon as you press the button, the Shooting Info display appears, 
with the Exposure Compensation setting active, as shown on the left in
Figure 5-27. Additionally, the current EV value appears in the viewfinder,
as shown on the right.
2. While keeping the button pressed, rotate the Command dial to change
the EV value.
• Rotate the dial to the right to lower the value and produce a darker
exposure.
• Rotate the dial to the left to raise the value and produce a brighter
exposure.
As you adjust the EV value, the exposure meter reflects the effect on the
exposure. Of course, if you agreed with the meter (which itself reflects
the camera’s autoexposure decision), you wouldn’t be fooling with EV
compensation, so don’t be alarmed that the meter indicates an under- or
overexposed photo. (See “Monitoring Exposure Settings,” earlier in this
chapter, for more about meter-reading.)
If you select a positive EV value, the little EV +/– symbol in the
viewfinder shows a plus sign; if you select a negative value, you see a
minus sign instead.
Figure 5-27: These symbols show the current Exposure Compensation and exposure status.
Shutter speed and f-stop
Exposure Compensation value

3. Release the EV Compensation button after you select the value you
want to use.
Your Exposure Compensation setting remains in force until you change
it, even if you power off the camera. So you may want to make a habit of
checking the setting before each shoot.
Here are a few other tips about Exposure Compensation:
 How the camera arrives at the brighter or darker image you request
through your Exposure Compensation setting depends on the exposure
mode:
• In A (aperture-priority autoexposure) mode, the camera adjusts
the shutter speed but leaves your selected f-stop in force. Be sure
to check the resulting shutter speed to make sure that it isn’t so
slow that camera shake or blur from moving objects is problematic.
• In S (shutter-priority autoexposure) mode, the opposite occurs:
The camera opens or stops down the aperture, leaving your
selected shutter speed alone.
• In P (programmed autoexposure) mode, the camera decides
whether to adjust aperture, shutter speed, or both.
However, the camera can adjust the aperture only so much, according
to the aperture range of your lens. And the range of shutter speeds,
too, is limited by the camera itself. So if you reach the ends of those
ranges, you either have to compromise on shutter speed or aperture or
adjust ISO.
 Exposure compensation isn’t the only tool available to you if you’re not
happy with the results produced by the camera’s autoexposure meter.
You also can change the exposure metering mode, which tells the camera
which part of the frame to consider when calculating exposure. I shot
the example images of the balloon and the dog using matrix mode, for
example; switching to center-weighted or spot metering probably would
have produced a better exposure of the subjects. I usually find it easier
to simply change the Exposure Compensation setting than to fiddle with
the metering mode, however.
 Some photographers use a slightly lower Exposure Compensation 
value — say, EV –0.3 — for all their shots. The thinking is that while this
setting may underexpose some images, resulting in a little necessary
retouching work later, it helps protect against blown highlights, which
are usually not easy to repair.
As an alternative, you can enable Active D-Lighting, which also produces
a slightly darker exposure and offers the additional benefit of applying a
post-capture process that brightens the darkest areas of a scene. The
downside of that choice is that the camera needs a longer time to cap-
ture each image. See the earlier section “Taking Advantage of Active 
D-Lighting” for details.
123
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

124
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 Finally, you can always simply switch to Manual exposure mode — M, on
the Mode dial — and select whatever aperture and shutter speed set-
tings produce the exposure you’re after. When you do shoot in Manual
mode, the current Exposure Compensation setting has no effect; again,
that exposure adjustment is made only in the three advanced auto-
exposure modes (P, S, and A).
Using Autoexposure Lock
To help ensure a proper exposure, your camera continually meters the light
in a scene until the moment you depress the shutter button fully and capture
the image. In autoexposure modes — that is, any mode but M — it also keeps
adjusting exposure settings as needed to maintain a good exposure.
For example, say that you set your camera to shutter-priority autoexposure
(S) mode and set the shutter speed to 1/125 second. The camera immediately
reports the f-stop that it considers appropriate to expose the scene at that
shutter speed. But if the light in the scene changes or you reframe your shot
before snapping the picture, the camera may shift the f-stop automatically to
compensate. 
For most situations, this approach works great, resulting in the right settings
for the light that’s striking your subject at the moment you capture the
image. But on occasion, you may want to lock in a certain combination of
exposure settings. Here’s one such scenario: Suppose that you’re shooting
several images of a large landscape that you want to join together into a
panorama in your photo editor. Unless the lighting is even across the entire
landscape, the camera’s autoexposure brain will select different exposure set-
tings for each shot, depending on which part of the scene is currently in the
frame. That can lead to weird breaks in the brightness and contrast of the
image when you seam the image together. And if it’s the f-stop that’s
adjusted, which is what could happen in P or S exposure modes, you may
notice shifts in depth of field as well.
The easiest way to lock in exposure settings is to switch to M (manual) expo-
sure mode and use the same f-stop, shutter speed, and ISO settings for each
shot. In manual mode, the camera never overrides your exposure decisions;
they’re locked until you change them. 
But if you prefer to stay in P, S, or A mode, you can lock in the current auto-
exposure settings by pressing the AE-L/AF-L button, highlighted in Figure 5-28.
By default, this step locks both exposure and focus for as long as you press the
button, even if you release the shutter button. (AE-L stands for autoexposure
lock; AF-L, for autofocus lock.) You see the letters EL in the viewfinder when
autoexposure lock is in effect.
AE-L
AF-L

By combining autoexposure lock
with spot metering, you can ensure 
a good exposure for photographs in
which you want your subject to be
off-center, and that subject is signifi-
cantly darker or lighter than the
background. Imagine, for example, 
a dark statue set against a light blue
sky. First, select spot metering, so
that the camera only considers the
object located in the selected auto-
focus point. Frame the scene initially
so that your statue is located within
that autofocus point. Press and hold
the shutter button halfway to estab-
lish focus and then lock exposure
and focus on the statue by pressing
and holding the AE-L/AF-L button.
Now reframe the shot to your
desired composition and take the
picture. (See Chapter 6 for details on selecting an autofocus point.)
Again, holding down the AE-L/AF-L button locks both exposure and focus by
default. But if you dig into the Custom Setting menu, you can change the
button’s function. You can set the button to lock only exposure, for example,
or only focus, instead of locking both as it does by default. Chapter 11 offers
details.
Using Flash in Advanced Exposure Modes
Sometimes, no amount of fiddling with aperture, shutter speed, and ISO pro-
duces a bright enough exposure — in which case, you simply have to add
more light. The built-in flash on your D60 offers the most convenient solution.
When you shoot in the advanced exposure modes, you have much more con-
trol over your flash than when you use the fully automatic modes covered in

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Choosing a flash mode
When you shoot in the P, S, A, or M exposure modes, the list of available flash
modes doesn’t include Auto, in which the camera makes the decisions about
when to fire the flash. Instead, if you don’t want the flash to fire, you simply
keep the flash unit closed. No need to select the Off flash mode, as when you
shoot in the fully automatic exposure modes.
If you do want to add flash, press and release the Flash button on the left side
of the camera. Then, press the button a second time, but this time, hold it
down as you rotate the Command dial to select a flash mode. I labeled both
controls in Figure 5-29.
Note that in the viewfinder, you see only a little lightning bolt graphic to indi-
cate that flash is enabled. To see the specific flash mode, you must check the
Shooting Info display; look for the flash icon in the lower-left corner of the
screen, as shown on the left in Figure 5-30. As soon as you press and hold the
Flash button, the Flash Mode setting automatically becomes active, as shown
on the right in Figure 5-30. Again, just rotate the Command dial to cycle
through the available flash modes, keeping the Flash button pressed as 
you do so.

adjust the flash mode.

Figure 5-30: The current flash mode is indicated in the Shooting Info display.
Your flash mode choices break down into three basic categories, described
in the next sections: fill flash; red-eye reduction flash; and the “sync” modes,
slow-sync and rear-sync, which are special-purpose flash options.
Fill flash: The outdoor photographer’s best friend
The fill flash setting on your D60 is represented by plain-old lighting bolt
symbol you see in the margin here. You can think of this setting as “normal
flash” — at least in the way that most of us think of using a flash.
You may also hear this mode called force flash because the flash fires no
matter what the available light, unlike in the Auto flash mode (provided for
the fully automatic exposure modes), in which the camera decides when flash
is needed. In Fill flash mode, the flash fires even in the brightest daylight —
which, by the way, is often an excellent idea.
Yep, you read me correctly: Adding a flash can really improve outdoor
photos, even when the sun is at its sunniest. Just as an example, Figure 5-31
shows a floral image taken both with and without a flash. The small pop of
light provided by the built-in flash is also extremely beneficial when shooting
nature or larger subjects that happen to be slightly shaded, such as the
carousel horses featured in the next section. For outdoor portraits, a flash 
is even more important; Chapter 7 discusses that subject.
Using a flash in bright sunlight also produces a slight warming effect, as illus-
trated in Figure 5-31. This color shift occurs because when you enable the
flash, the camera’s white balancing mechanism warms color slightly to com-
pensate for the bluish light of a flash. But because your scene is actually lit
primarily by sunlight, which is not as cool as flash light, the white balance
Current flash mode

Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

adjustment takes the image colors a step warmer than neutral. If you don’t
want this warming effect, see Chapter 6 to find out how to make a manual
white balance adjustment.
Figure 5-31: Adding flash resulted in better illumination and a slight warming effect.
Do note, however, that when you use flash, you’re restricted to a top shutter
speed of 1/200 second. That means that in very bright sun, you may need to
stop down the aperture significantly to avoid overexposing the image. See
the sidebar “In Sync: Flash timing and shutter speed,” later in this chapter, 
for details on shutter-speed ranges available for flash photography.
Red-eye reduction flash 
Red-eye is caused when flash light bounces off a subject’s retinas and is
reflected back to the camera lens. Red-eye is a human phenomena, though;
with animals, the reflected light usually glows yellow, white, or green.
Man or beast, this issue isn’t nearly the problem with the type of pop-up flash
found on your D60 as it is on non-SLR cameras. The D60’s flash is positioned
in such a way that the flash light usually doesn’t hit a subject’s eyes straight
on, which lessens the chances of red eye. However, red-eye may still be an
issue when you use a lens with a long focal length (a telephoto lens) or you
shoot subjects from a distance.

If you do notice red eye, you can try the red-eye reduction mode represented
by the icon shown in the margin here. In this mode, the camera fires a small
preflash light before the actual flash. The subject’s pupils constrict in response
to that preflash, allowing less flash light to enter the eye and cause that glowy
red reflection. Be sure to warn your subjects to wait for the real flash, or they
may step out of the frame or stop posing after the preflash.
For an even better solution, try the flash-free portrait tips covered in Chapter 7.
If you do a lot of portrait work that requires flash, you may also want to con-
sider an external flash unit, which enables you to aim the flash light in ways
that virtually eliminate red-eye.
If all else fails, check out Chapter 10, which shows you how to use the built-in
red-eye removal tool on your camera’s Retouch menu. Sadly, though, this fea-
ture removes only red-eye, not the yellow/green/white eye that you get with
animal portraits.
Slow-sync and rear-sync flash
In fill flash and red-eye reduction flash modes, the flash and shutter are syn-
chronized so that the flash fires at the exact moment the shutter opens.
Technical types refer to this flash arrangement as front-curtain sync.
Your Nikon also offers four special-sync modes, which work as follows:
 Slow-sync flash: This mode, available only in the P and A exposure
modes, also uses front-curtain sync but allows a shutter speed slower
than the 1/60 second minimum that is in force when you use fill flash
and red-eye reduction flash.
The benefit of this longer exposure is that the camera has time to
absorb more ambient light, which in turn has two effects: Background
areas that are beyond the reach of the flash appear brighter; and less
flash power is needed, resulting in softer lighting.
The downside of the slow shutter speed is, well, the slow shutter speed.
As discussed earlier in this chapter, the longer the exposure time, the
more you have to worry about blur caused by movement of your subject
or your camera. A tripod is essential to a good outcome, as are subjects
that can hold very, very still. I find that the best practical use for this
mode is shooting nighttime still-life subjects such as the one you see in
Figure 5-32.
Some photographers, though, turn the downside of slow-sync flash to an
upside, using it to purposely blur their subjects, thereby emphasizing
motion.
129
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

130
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 5-32: Slow-sync flash produces softer, more even lighting than normal flash in
nighttime pictures.
 Rear-curtain sync: In this mode, available only in shutter-priority (S)
and manual (M) exposure modes, the flash fires at the very end of the
exposure, just before the shutter closes. The classic use of this mode 
is to combine the flash with a slow shutter speed to create trailing-light
effects like the one you see in Figure 5-33. With rear-curtain sync, the
light trails extend behind the moving object (my hand, and the match, 
in this case), which makes visual sense. If instead you use slow-sync
flash, the light trails appear in front of the moving object.
 Slow-sync with rear-curtain sync: Hey, not confusing enough for you
yet? This mode enables you to produce the same motion trail effects as
with rear-curtain sync, but in the P and A exposure modes.
 Slow-sync with red-eye reduction: In P and A exposure modes, you can
also combine a slow-sync flash with the red-eye reduction feature. Given
the potential for blur that comes with a slow shutter, plus the potential
for subjects to mistake the red-eye preflash for the real flash and walk
out of the frame before the image is actually recorded, I vote this flash
mode as the most difficult to pull off successfully.
Slow-sync flash
Normal flash

Note that all of these modes are some-
what tricky to use successfully, how-
ever. So have fun playing around, but
at the same time, don’t feel too badly
if you don’t have time right now to
master these modes plus all the other
exposure options presented to you in
this chapter. In the meantime, do a
Web search for slow-sync and rear-
sync image examples if you want to
get a better idea of the effects that
other photographers create with these
flash modes.
Adjusting flash output
When you shoot with your built-in
flash, the camera attempts to adjust
the flash output as needed to produce
a good exposure in the current lighting
conditions. On some occasions, you
may find that you want a little more 
or less light than the camera thinks is
appropriate.
You can adjust the flash output by using a feature called Flash Compensation.
This feature works just like Exposure Compensation, discussed earlier in the
chapter, except that it enables you to override the camera’s flash-power deci-
sion instead of its autoexposure decision. As with Exposure Compensation,
the Flash Compensation settings are stated in terms of EV (exposure value)
numbers. A setting of 0.0 indicates no flash adjustment; you can increase the
flash power to EV +1.0 or decrease it to EV –3.0.
As an example of the benefit of this feature — again, available only when you
shoot in the P, S, A, or M exposure modes — take a look at the carousel horse
images in Figure 5-34. The first image shows you a flash-free shot. Clearly, I
needed a flash to compensate for the fact that the horses were shadowed 
by the roof of the carousel. But at normal flash power, as shown in the same
image, the flash was too strong, creating glare in some spots and blowing out
the highlights in the white mane, as shown in the middle image. By dialing
the flash power down to EV –0.7, I got a softer flash that straddled the line
perfectly between no flash and too much flash.
As for boosting the flash output, well, you may find it necessary on some
occasions, but don’t expect the built-in flash to work miracles even at a Flash
Compensation of +1.0. Any built-in flash has a limited range, and you simply
can’t expect the flash light to reach faraway objects. In other words, don’t
even try taking flash pictures of a darkened recital hall from your seat in the
balcony — all you’ll wind up doing is annoying everyone.

With that preface in mind, you can view the current Flash Compensation
setting in the Shooting Info screen, shown in Figure 5-35. It’s located just to
the right of the Exposure Compensation setting. The little flash symbol in
the Flash Compensation setting reminds you which is which.

To adjust the flash power, you have
three options, as follows:
 Via the Quick Settings display:

press the Zoom button to shift
into Quick Settings mode,
and then highlight the Flash
Compensation setting, as shown
on the left in Figure 5-36. Press
OK to display the screen shown
on the right in the figure, where
you can select the flash power
you want to use. Press OK again
to return to the Shooting Info dis-
play. (Chapter 1 offers help with
using the Shooting Info and Quick
Settings displays if you need it.) 
133
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
In sync: Flash timing and shutter speed
In order to properly expose flash pictures, the
camera has to synchronize the timing of the
flash output with the opening and closing of the
shutter. For this reason, the range of shutter
speeds available to you is more limited when
you use flash than when you go flash-free.
When you use the built-in flash, the maximum
shutter speed is 1/200 second. That means that
you may not be able to capture blur-free images
of fast-moving subjects when a flash is
required. In addition, using flash in very bright
light (as in outdoor daytime shots) may require
a very high f-stop setting to avoid overexposure.
The minimum shutter speed varies depending
on your exposure mode, as follows:
 P, A, Auto, Portrait, Child modes: 1/60 second
 Close Up mode: 1/125 second
 Nighttime Portrait mode: 1 second
 S, M modes: 30 seconds
Note that in P and A exposure modes, setting
your flash to slow-sync mode does enable you
to go even slower than the 1/60 second mini-
mum shown here. In addition, manual exposure
mode also enables you to combine flash with
bulb exposure, in which the shutter stays open
indefinitely as long as you keep the shutter
button depressed.

Flash Compensation setting.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 5-36: You can adjust the setting through the Quick Settings display.
 Via the Shooting Info display: If you press and hold the Flash button
together with the Exposure Compensation button, the Flash Compensa-
tion setting in the Shooting Info display becomes active, and a little flag
bearing the message “Flash Compensation” appears at the top of the
screen. Keeping the buttons pressed, rotate the Command dial to change
the setting. I find any technique that involves coordinating this many fin-
gers a little complex, but you may find it easier than I do.
 Via the Custom Setting menu: If you don’t see the Flash Compensation
setting on the menu, toggle over to the Setup menu and change the
CSM/Setup Menu option to Full, as explained in Chapter 1.
As with Exposure Compensation, any flash-power adjustment you make
remains in force, even if you turn off the camera, until you reset the control.
So be sure to check the setting before you next use your flash.
Using an external flash unit
In addition to its built-in flash, your camera has a hot shoe, which is photo-
geek terminology for a connection that enables you to add an external flash
head like the one shown in Figure 5-37. The figure features the Nikon
Speedlight SB-600, which currently retails for about $200. (The hot shoe is
covered by a little cap when you first get the camera; you have to remove it
to add your flash.)
Although certainly not the cheapest of camera accessories, an external flash
may be a worthwhile investment if you do a lot of flash photography, espe-
cially portraits. For one thing, an external flash offers greater power, enabling
you to illuminate a larger area than you can with a built-in flash. And with
flash units like the one in Figure 5-37, you can rotate the flash head so that
the flash light bounces off a wall or ceiling instead of hitting your subject
directly. This results in softer lighting and can eliminate the harsh shadows

often caused by the strong, narrowly
focused light of a built-in flash.
(Chapter 7 offers an example of the
difference this lighting technique can
make in portraits.)
Whether the investment in an exter-
nal flash will be worthwhile depends
on the kind of photography you want
to do. However, if you simply want a
softer, more diffused light than your
built-in flash produces, you have
another option: You can buy a flash
diffuser attachment like the one
shown in Figure 5-38. This diffuser,
made by LumiQuest (www.lumi
quest.com), sells for just $13 and is 
a heck of a lot lighter and smaller to
tuck into your camera bag than a
flash head. This is just one of many
diffuser designs, so visit your
camera store to compare all 
your options.
If you do decide to purchase an
external flash, I highly recommend
that you visit a good camera store,
where the personnel can help you
select the right flash model for the
kind of flash work you want to do.
You don’t necessarily need to stick
with a Nikon-brand flash, but be
aware that third-party flash units
may not be fully compatible with
your D60. In addition, some Nikon
flash units support some advanced
features that are part of the so-called
Nikon Creative Lighting System. These
advanced flash features are beyond
the scope of this book — in fact,
entire books have been written
about the system — but you can
learn more about them on the Nikon
Web site. You may also want to dig
into some of the many books that
concentrate solely on flash photo-
graphy. There’s a lot more to that
game than you may imagine, and
you’ll no doubt discover some great

T
o many people, the word focus has just one interpretation when applied
to a photograph: Either the subject is in focus or it’s blurry. And it’s true,
this characteristic of your photographs is an important one. There’s not
much to appreciate about an image that’s so blurry that you can’t make 
out whether you’re looking at Peru or Peoria.
But an artful photographer knows that there’s more to
focus than simply getting a sharp image of a subject. 
You also need to consider depth of field, or the dis-
tance over which objects remain sharply focused.
This chapter explains all the ways to control depth
of field, discusses how to use your D60’s advanced
autofocus options, and offers some tips on manual
focusing.
This chapter also dives into the topic of color, explain-
ing your camera’s white balance control, which com-
pensates for the varying color casts created by different
light sources. Finally, a section near the end of the chapter
introduces you to the Optimize Image feature, which enables
you to take even greater control over image sharpness and color.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Reviewing Focus Basics
I touch on various focus issues in Chapters 1, 2, and 5. But just in case you’re
not reading this book from front to back, here’s a recap of the basic process
of focusing with your D60:
1. If you haven’t already done so, adjust the viewfinder diopter to your
eyesight.
Look through the
viewfinder and pay
attention only to the
three focus brackets,
labeled in Figure 6-1.
Then nudge the
diopter slider until
the brackets them-
selves appear 
sharp — don’t worry
about the scene in
front of the lens. 
The diopter slider 
is located just to 
the right of the
viewfinder, tucked
behind the little
rubber eyepiece;
Chapter 1 details
this step if you need
more help.
2. Set the focusing switch on the lens to manual or automatic focusing.
If you want to focus manually, set the switch to the M position, as shown
in Figure 6-2. For autofocusing, set the switch to the A position.
These directions are specific to the kit lens sold with the D60, shown in
the figure. On other lenses, the switch may look or operate differently,
so check the product manual. And note that not all lenses provide auto-
focusing when paired with the D60; if your lens offers only manual focus-
ing, be sure to set the Focus mode to MF (manual focus), as explained in
the upcoming section “Changing the Focus mode.”
3. To set focus in autofocus mode, press and hold the shutter button
halfway down.
Focus brackets
Focus indicator
Figure 6-1: The viewfinder offers these focusing aids.

Figure 6-2: Select A for autofocus or M for manual focus.
When focus is established, the focus indicator in the viewfinder lights,
and one of the focusing brackets turns red, as shown in Figure 6-1. Focus
is maintained as long as you continue to hold the shutter button down
halfway. (Press the button the rest of the way when you’re ready to snap
the picture.)
The red bracket indicates the active autofocus area, which is the portion
of the frame the camera uses to establish focus. The autofocus area
varies depending on the current autofocus area mode, or AF-area mode,
in the lingo of your camera manual. To find out more about this issue,
including how to select the autofocus area you want to use, check out
the next section.
4. To set focus manually, twist the focusing ring on the lens.
I labeled the focusing ring in Figure 6-2.
Even in manual mode, you can confirm focus by pressing the shutter
button halfway. If the object in the active autofocus area is in focus, the
viewfinder’s focus indicator lights up. In addition, you can enable the
D60’s rangefinder display, which provides additional focus feedback.
Check out the section “Taking advantage of manual-focusing aids,” later
in this chapter, for tips.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Adjusting Autofocus Performance
You can adjust two aspects of your camera’s autofocusing system: the AF-area
mode and the Focus mode. The next two sections explain these features.
Changing the AF-area mode
Chapter 2 introduces the three AF-area mode options, which determine what
area of the frame the camera uses when establishing autofocus. Here’s a
quick reminder about how each mode works:
 Closest Subject: The camera bases focus on the pair of brackets that
contain the object closest to the camera. This is the default setting for
all exposure modes (Auto, P, A, and so on) except the Sports and Close
Up Digital Vari-Program modes.
 Dynamic Area: In this mode, you select one of the focus brackets by
using the Multi Selector, and the camera sets focus based on that area 
of the frame. If the object within the focus brackets moves before you
press the shutter button the rest of the way down to take the picture,
the camera looks at the other brackets to try to find an object on which
to focus. This setting is the default for Sports mode.
 Single Point: You use the Multi Selector to choose one of the three focus-
ing brackets, and the camera bases focus only on that area. This mode is
the default setting for Close Up mode.
If you want to change the mode from the default setting, the easiest way is to
use the Quick Settings display. First, display the Shooting Info screen by
pressing the Zoom button or by pressing the shutter button halfway. (You
can release the shutter button after the screen appears.) Next, press the
Zoom button to shift to the Quick Settings display and then use the Multi
Selector to highlight the AF-area mode option, highlighted in yellow in 
Figure 6-3. Press OK to display the second screen in the figure, highlight your
choice, and press OK again. The three modes are represented in the display
by the icons you see in the margins here.
Shutter speed and blurry photos
A poorly focused photo isn’t always related to the
issues discussed in this chapter. Any movement
of the camera or subject can also cause blur.
Both of these problems are related to shutter
speed, an exposure control that I cover in
Chapter 5. Be sure to also visit Chapter 7, which
provides some additional tips for capturing
moving objects without blur.

Figure 6-3: You can change the AF-area mode via the Quick Settings display.
If you prefer, you can also adjust the
AF-area mode via the Custom Setting
menu, shown in Figure 6-4.
A few other things to know about the
AF-area mode setting:
 Monitoring the AF-area mode
setting. You can check the AF-
area mode setting in the
viewfinder as well as in the
Shooting Info display. In the
viewfinder, a little icon at the far
left end of the display, just to the
right of the focusing confirmation
dot, indicates the AF-area mode.
However, note that in the viewfinder, the icon representing Closest Subject
mode and Dynamic Area mode look a little different than they do in the
Shooting Info display and menus. Figure 6-5 shows you how the icons for
all three AF-area modes appear in the viewfinder; Figure 6-6 points out
the position of the AF-area mode icon in the Shooting Info display. In that
figure, the mode is set to Dynamic Area.
Figure 6-5: In the viewfinder, these symbols represent the current AF-area mode.

142
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 Confirming the active autofocus
area. See those little plus signs
that I labeled “Selected autofocus
area” in Figure 6-6? They repre-
sent the three autofocus areas,
just like the brackets that appear
in the viewfinder. If you set the
AF-area mode to Dynamic Area or
Single Point, the plus sign that’s
surrounded by brackets indicates
which of the three focus areas is
selected. For example, the display
in Figure 6-6 indicates that the
leftmost autofocus area is
selected. The same brackets
appear in the viewfinder,
although they’re a little hard 
to see, at least for my middle-
age eyes.
And guess what: There’s even more to this bracket/plus sign coding: In
Dynamic Area mode, all three plus signs in the Shooting Info display are
black, telling you that the autofocus area may shift if your subject moves
out of the selected area, as explained earlier. In Single Point mode, only
the selected area’s plus sign is black; the others are gray, indicating that
they won’t come into play for your next shot. In Closest Subject mode,
the brackets go away entirely. All three plus signs appear bold, and the
viewfinder icon shows you all three dots, as in the first example in
Figure 6-5. That’s your reminder that the camera may focus on any of 
the three areas, depending on where the object closest to the camera is
positioned in the frame.
I share this nugget of detail with you because I feel certain that some
hard-working group at Nikon spent time coming up with this elaborate
symbol system. But if you can’t remember all these intricacies — or you
can’t see the little brackets in the viewfinder either — just look through
the viewfinder and press the shutter button halfway; again, the brackets
that appear red show you the selected autofocus area. You do need to
know which AF-area mode is enabled, though, to predict whether the
camera will stick with that selected point or not.
 Reverting to the default AF-area mode. When you use the advanced
exposure modes (P, S, A, and M), your selected AF-area mode stays in
force until you change it. But in the other modes, the AF-area setting
reverts to the default when you switch to a different exposure mode. So
you may find it more convenient to simply use manual focusing instead
of adjusting the AF-area mode when you shoot in those exposure modes.

Figure 6-6: You can verify which
focus point is selected as well.

 Simplifying things with center-point autofocusing. If you want to sim-
plify your autofocus routine, try this option: Just leave the AF-area mode
set to Single Point, with the center focus bracket selected. Now the
camera will always set focus based on whatever is at the center of the
frame — a setup that may be familiar to you if you’ve worked with some
point-and-shoot cameras. If you want your subject to appear off-center,
you still can: Frame the picture initially so that the subject is centered,
depress the shutter button halfway to establish focus, and then reframe
the image before pressing the shutter button the rest of the way. 
Do be careful about autoexposure if you use this technique, however. If
the exposure metering mode is set to either spot- or center-weighted
metering, and you reframe the image so that your subject isn’t at the
center of the frame, exposure may be off. The best solution is to lock
autoexposure before you reframe, using the AE-L/AF-L lock button. In
matrix metering, which bases exposure on the entire frame, this issue
shouldn’t be a big problem unless your subject is significantly brighter
or darker than the rest of the scene — in which case, I suggest changing
to spot- or center-weighted metering and locking autoexposure as just
described. Chapter 5 provides details about metering modes, autoexpo-
sure lock, and other exposure issues. 
Changing the Focus mode setting
Throughout this book, I use the term focusing mode generically to refer to the
lens switch that shifts your camera from autofocusing to manual focusing — at
least, on the kit lens sold with the D60. But there also is an official Focus mode
setting, which controls another aspect of your Nikon’s focusing behavior.
There are four Focus mode options, which work as follows:
 AF-S (single-servo autofocus): In this autofocus mode, which is geared
to shooting stationary subjects, the camera locks focus when you
depress the shutter button halfway.
 AF-C (continuous-servo autofocus): In this autofocus mode, which is
designed for moving subjects, the camera focuses continuously for the
entire time you hold the shutter button halfway down. So if your subject
moves before you take the shot, but you adjust framing to keep that 
subject within the active autofocus area, focus should be correct. If 
the subject moves out of the active autofocus area, the camera looks for
something else on which to establish focus. If you want to lock focus at 
a certain distance, you must press the AE-L/AF-L button, as described in
the section, “Using autofocus lock,” later in this chapter.
143
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color

144
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 AF-A (auto-servo autofocus): In this autofocus mode, the camera analyzes
the scene and, if it detects motion, automatically selects continuous-servo
mode (AF-C). If the camera instead believes you’re shooting a stationary
object, it selects single-servo mode (AF-S).
 MF (manual focus): If you use a lens that does not offer an external switch
to shift from auto to manual focus, you need to select this setting to focus
manually. You also need to choose this setting if your lens doesn’t offer an
autofocus motor at all. (You can still use the lens, but you get autofocus-
ing capabilities only with lenses like the D60 kit lens, which has its own
autofocus motor. Unlike some SLRs, the D60 does not have an autofocus
mechanism in the camera body; instead, it relies on the lens to provide
that feature.)
On the D60 kit lens featured in this book, simply setting the switch on
the lens to M automatically sets the Focus mode to MF. However, choos-
ing this Focus mode setting does not free the focusing ring so that you
can actually set focus manually; you still must set the switch to the M
position.
As for the autofocus options, single-servo mode (AF-S) works best for shoot-
ing still subjects, and continuous-servo (AF-C) is the right choice for moving
subjects. But frankly, auto-servo (AF-A), which is the default setting, does a
good job in most cases of making that shift for you. So, in my mind, there’s no
real reason to fiddle with the setting unless you’re shooting moving objects
(in which case the camera shifts to continuous-servo mode) and want to be
able to lock focus at a specific position without using the AE-L/AF-L button.
Another potential hangup might be if your subject is stationary but back-
ground objects are moving, causing the camera to sense motion and shift to
continuous-servo mode and try to focus on those moving objects. In either
case, you would need to shift to single-servo mode (AF-S) so that you can
lock focus by depressing the shutter button halfway — although I think it’s
simpler to focus manually in that situation.
In fact, the camera restricts you to using either auto-servo (AF-A) or manual
mode (MF) if you shoot in any of the fully automatic exposure modes. You
can choose from all four Focus modes only when you shoot in P, S, A, or M
exposure modes.
At any rate, the quickest way to adjust the Focus mode is via the Quick
Settings display. Follow the usual path: Fire up the Shooting Info display,
press the Zoom button to shift to the Quick Settings display, and then use 
the Multi Selector to highlight the Focus mode icon, as shown in Figure 6-7.
Press OK to display the second screen in the figure, highlight your choice,
and press OK again.

Figure 6-7: Auto-servo mode (AF-A) works fine in most cases.
You can also access the focus mode
setting from the Custom Setting menu,
as shown in Figure 6-8.
Using autofocus lock
When you set your camera’s Focus
mode to AF-C (continuous-servo auto-
focus), pressing and holding the shut-
ter button halfway initiates autofocus.
But focusing is continually adjusted
while you hold the shutter button
halfway, so the focusing distance may
change if the subject moves out of the
active autofocus area before you press
the shutter button the rest of the way to take the picture. The same is true 
if you set the Focus mode to AF-A (auto-servo autofocus) and the camera
senses movement in front of the lens, in which case it shifts to AF-C mode
and operates as I just described. Either way, the upshot is that you can’t 
control the exact focusing distance the camera ultimately uses.
Should you want to lock focus at a specific distance, you have a couple of
options:
 Focus manually. 
 Change the Focus mode to AF-S (single-servo autofocus). In this mode,
focus is locked when you press and hold the shutter button halfway.
Unfortunately, you can’t select this mode unless you shoot in the
advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, and M). Also, the press-and-hold
method doesn’t work if you set the Release mode to Continuous.
(Remember, the Release mode determines whether you capture a single
image or a series of images each time you press the shutter button;
Chapter 2 has details.)

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 Use autofocus lock. First set focus by pressing the shutter button half-
way. When the focus is established at the distance you want, press and
hold the AE-L/AF-L button,
located near the viewfinder and
labeled in Figure 6-9. Focus
remains set as long as you hold
the button down, even if you
release the shutter button.
Keep in mind, though, that by
default, pressing the AE-L/AF-L
button also locks in exposure if
you’re shooting in the P, S, or A
autoexposure modes. (Chapter
5 explains.) You can change this
behavior, however, setting the
button to lock just one or the
other. Chapter 11 explains this
option as well as a couple other
ways to customize the button’s
function.
For my money, manual focusing is by far the easiest solution. Yes, it may take
you a little while to get comfortable with manual focusing, but in the long
run, you really save yourself a lot of time fiddling with the various autofocus
settings, remembering which button initiates the focus lock, and so on. Just
be sure that you have adjusted the viewfinder diopter to your eyesight, as
explained in Chapter 1, so that there’s not a disconnect between what you
see in the viewfinder and where the camera is actually focusing. After a little
practice, focusing manually will become second nature to you. And, as the
next section explains, you still get some focusing assistance from the camera.
Taking Advantage of Manual-Focusing Aids
Today’s autofocusing systems are pretty remarkable. As long as you follow
the suggested techniques for autofocusing and use the right settings for the
situation, you can expect a nice, sharply focused subject.
However, some subjects baffle even the most capable autofocus system:
objects behind fences, highly reflective objects, dimly-lit subjects, and scenes
in which very little contrast exists between the subject and background. For
those times when your camera can’t seem to lock focus on a subject, don’t
waste time trying to adjust autofocus settings or otherwise maneuvering the
camera to make autofocusing work. Just switch to manual focus and do 
the job yourself.
Autoexposure/autofocus lock
Figure 6-9: Press the AE-L/AF-L button to lock
focus when using autofocusing.

Of course, if the lens you use on your D60 doesn’t offer an autofocus motor,
you must focus manually. But many SLR photographers (including me) prefer
to focus manually most of the time even if they do own an autofocus lens.
With manual focus, you don’t have to worry that you’ve forgotten to select
the appropriate autofocus modes, and, after you become familiar with
manual focusing, you often can achieve focus faster than the camera’s auto-
focus brain can do the job, especially with a moving subject.
Manual focus doesn’t mean that you don’t get some focusing assistance from
the camera, however. The camera offers two indicators to let you know
whether it thinks you’ve achieved focus, as explored in the next two sections.
Verifying focus with the focus indicator lamp
When you press the shutter button halfway, one of the three pairs of focus
brackets in the viewfinder turns red. In autofocus mode, this signals you as 
to the AF-area that the camera will use when establishing focus. When focus
is set, the green focus indicator lamp in the viewfinder lights.
You can take advantage of
this same focusing cue
when you switch to
manual focusing. First,
press the shutter button
halfway to see which pair
of focus brackets turns
red and is thus currently
active. If you want to
select a different set of
focus brackets, you can
do so by pressing the
Multi Selector right or
left. Now just position
your selected brackets
over your subject, as illus-
trated in Figure 6-10, twist
the lens focusing ring to
set focus, and then press
the shutter button half-
way. If the camera agrees
that you focused correctly
on the object in the active
brackets, the green focus
indicator lights.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Using the rangefinder to verify manual focus
Normally, the area to the right of the shutter speed and f-stop readout in the
viewfinder display is reserved for the exposure meter, introduced in Chapter 5
and shown in Figure 6-10. (It’s the little bar graph to the right of the f-stop
value.) But if you prefer, you can replace the exposure meter with a focus-
distance meter, called the rangefinder.
Here’s how it works: You
take the same manual
focusing approach as
mentioned in the preced-
ing section, first selecting
a pair of focus brackets,
positioning the brackets
over your subject, and
then dialing in focus by
twisting the focusing ring
on the lens. When you
press the shutter button
halfway, the rangefinder
display indicates whether
focus is set on the object
in the selected focus
brackets. (Remember,
those are the ones that
appear red when you
press the shutter button
halfway.)
If you see just the 0 and a
single bar on either side, as in Figure 6-11, the rangefinder is telling you that
you’re locked on your target. If bars appear to the left of the 0, as shown in
the left example in Figure 6-12, focus is set in front of the subject; if the bars
are to the right, as in the middle example, focus is slightly behind the subject.
The more bars you see, the greater the focusing error. As you twist the focus-
ing ring, the rangefinder updates to help you get focus on track.
Figure 6-12: These rangefinder readouts indicate a focus problem.
Focus front of subject
Focus behind subject
Unable to focus
Rangefinder
Figure 6-11: When the rangefinder looks like this, focus is
set on the object in the active focus brackets.

Before I tell you how to activate this feature, I want to point out a couple of
issues:
 You can’t use the rangefinder in Manual exposure mode. In that mode,
the viewfinder always displays the exposure meter. (You can still con-
firm focus by checking the focus-indicator lamp, as outlined in the 
preceding section.)
 Your lens must offer a maximum aperture (f-stop number) of f/5.6 or
lower. To understand f-stops, head back to Chapter 5. The kit lens sold
with the D60 meets this qualification.
 With subjects that confuse the camera’s autofocus system, the range-
finder may not work well either; it’s based on the same system. If the
rangefinder readout looks like the final example in Figure 6-11, the
camera can’t track focus, so you should just rely on your eyes to make
the focus judgment. (Again, adjusting the viewfinder diopter to your 
eyesight is critical; see Chapter 1 for how-to’s.)
If none of those caveats concern you,
you can enable the rangefinder dis-
play via the Custom Setting menu.
Scroll down the menu to highlight the
Rangefinder option, as shown in
Figure 6-13. Press OK to move to the
next screen, highlight On, and press
OK again. (If you don’t see the
Rangefinder option, switch to the
Setup menu and set the CSM/Setup
Menu option to Full. Only then can
you access all the available menu
items.) 
After you turn the Rangefinder option
to On, the rangefinder automatically replaces the exposure meter in the
viewfinder when you switch to manual focusing, assuming that you set the
Mode dial to any exposure setting but M (for Manual exposure). Again, you
don’t have the option to replace the exposure meter with the rangefinder in
M exposure mode. 
Do you need to worry about not having the exposure meter in the other
modes? Well, remember that in the P mode, you don’t get an exposure meter
anyway, for reasons explained in Chapter 5. The same holds true for the Auto
and Digital Vari-Program modes; you don’t see an exposure meter for those
modes, either. And in A and S modes, the meter still appears in the Shooting
Info display if the camera anticipates an exposure problem. So you can always
check exposure in the Shooting Info display and then monitor focus through
the rangefinder.
149
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color

the Custom Setting menu.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
That said, I typically leave the Rangefinder off and just rely on the focus indi-
cator lamp to verify focus. I shoot in the S and A exposure modes frequently,
and I just find it a pain to have to monitor exposure in the Shooting Info dis-
play rather than in the viewfinder. That’s not a recommendation to you either
way — it’s just how I prefer to work. 
Manipulating Depth of Field
Getting familiar with the concept of depth of field is one of the biggest steps
you can take to becoming a more artful photographer. I introduce you to
depth of field in Chapters 2 and 5, but here’s a quick recap just to hammer
home the lesson:
 Depth of field refers to the distance over which objects in a photograph
appear sharply focused.
 With a shallow, or small, depth
of field, distant objects appear
more softly focused than the
main subject (assuming that
you set focus on the main 
subject, of course).
 With a large depth of field, the
zone of sharp focus extends to
include objects at a distance
from your subject.
Which arrangement works best
depends entirely on your creative
vision and your subject. In portraits,
for example, a classic technique is
to use a short depth of field, as I did
for the photo in Figure 6-14. This
approach increases emphasis on
the subject while diminishing the
impact of the background. But for
the photo shown in Figure 6-15, I
wanted to emphasize that the fore-
ground figures were in St. Peter’s
Square, at the Vatican in Rome, so I
used a large depth of field, which
kept the background buildings
sharply focused and gave them equal weight in the scene.
Aperture, f/5.6; Focal length, 300mm
Figure 6-14: A shallow depth of field blurs the
background and draws added attention to 
the subject.

So exactly how do you adjust depth of field? You have three points of control:
aperture, focal length, and camera-to-subject distance, as spelled out in the
following list:
 Aperture setting (f-stop): The aperture is one of three exposure set-
tings, all explained fully in Chapter 5. Depth of field increases as you
stop down the aperture (by choosing a higher f-stop number). For 
shallow depth of field, open the aperture (by choosing a lower f-stop
number). Figure 6-16 offers an example; in the f/22 version, focus is
sharp all the way through the frame; in the f/13 version, focus softens 
as the distance from the center lure increases. I snapped both images
using the same focal length and camera-to-subject distance, setting
focus on the center lure.
Figure 6-15: A large depth of field keeps both foreground 
and background subjects in focus.
Aperture, f/14; Focal length, 42mm
151
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color

152
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 6-16: A lower f-stop number (wider aperture) decreases depth of field.
 Lens focal length: In lay terms, focal length determines what the lens
“sees.” As you increase focal length, measured in millimeters, the angle
of view narrows, objects appear larger in the frame, and — the impor-
tant point for this discussion — depth of field decreases. Additionally,
the spatial relationship of objects changes as you adjust focal length. As
an example, Figure 6-17 compares the same scene shot at a focal length
of 127mm and 183mm. I used the same aperture, f/5.6, for both examples.
Aperture, f/22; Focal length, 92mm
Aperture, f/13; Focal length, 92mm

Figure 6-17: Zooming to a longer focal length also reduces depth of field.
Whether you have any focal length flexibility depends on your lens: If
you have a zoom lens, you can adjust the focal length — just zoom in or
out. (The D60 kit lens, for example, offers a focal range of 18–55mm.) If
you don’t have a zoom lens, the focal length is fixed, so scratch this
means of manipulating depth of field.
For more technical details about focal length and your D60, see the side-
bar “Fun facts about focal length.”
 Camera-to-subject distance: As you move the lens closer to your sub-
ject, depth of field decreases. This assumes that you don’t zoom in or
out to reframe the picture, thereby changing the focal length. If you do,
depth of field is affected by both the camera position and focal length.

Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color

154
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Together, these three factors determine the maximum and minimum depth of
field that you can achieve, as illustrated by my clever artwork in Figure 6-18
and summed up in the following list:
 To produce the shallowest depth of field: Open the aperture as wide 
as possible (the lowest f-stop number), zoom in to the maximum focal
length of your lens, and get as close as possible to your subject.
 To produce maximum depth of field: Stop down the aperture to the
highest possible f-stop number, zoom out to the shortest focal length
your lens offers, and move farther from your subject.
Figure 6-18: f-stop, focal length, and your shooting distance determine depth of field.
Just to avoid a possible point of confusion that has arisen in some of the
classes I teach: When I say zoom in, some students think that I mean to twist
the zoom barrel in toward the camera body. But in fact, the phrase zoom in
means to zoom to a longer focal length, which produces the visual effect of
bringing your subject closer. This requires twisting the zoom barrel of the
lens so that it extends further out from the camera. And the phrase zoom out
refers to the opposite maneuver: I’m talking about widening your view of the
subject by zooming to a shorter focal length, which requires moving the lens
barrel in toward the camera body.
Here are a few additional tips and tricks related to depth of field:
Greater depth of field:
Select higher f-stop
Decrease focal length (zoom out)
Move farther from subject
Shorter depth of field:
Select lower f-stop
Increase focal length (zoom in)
Move closer to subject

 When depth of field is a primary concern, try using aperture-priority
exposure mode (A). In this mode, detailed fully in Chapter 5, you set the
f-stop, and the camera selects the appropriate shutter speed to produce
a good exposure. The range of aperture settings you can access depends
on your lens.
 Some of the Digital Vari-Program modes are also designed with depth of
field in mind. Portrait, Child, and Close Up modes produce shortened
depth of field; Landscape mode produces a greater depth of field. You
can’t adjust aperture in these modes, however, so you’re limited to the
setting the camera chooses.
 The extent to which background focus shifts as you adjust depth of field
also is affected by the distance between the subject and the background.
For increased background blurring, move the subject farther in front of
the background.
 If you adjust aperture to affect depth of field, be sure to always keep an
eye on shutter speed as well. To maintain the same exposure, shutter
speed must change in tandem with aperture, and you may encounter a
situation where the shutter speed is too slow to permit hand-holding of
the camera. Lenses that offer optical image stabilization, or vibration
reduction (VR lenses, in the Nikon world), do enable most people to use
a slower shutter speed than normal, but double-check your results just
to be sure. Or use a tripod for extra security.
Controlling Color
Compared with understanding some aspects of digital photography — 
resolution, aperture and shutter speed, depth of field, and so on — making
sense of your camera’s color options is easy-breezy. First, color problems
aren’t all that common, and when they are, they’re usually simple to fix with 
a quick shift of your D60’s white balance control. And getting a grip on color
requires learning only a couple of new terms, an unusual state of affairs for an
endeavor that often seems more like high-tech science than art.
The rest of this chapter explains the aforementioned white balance control,
plus a couple of menu options that enable you to fine-tune the way your
camera renders colors. For information on how to use the Retouch menu’s
color options to alter colors of existing pictures, see Chapters 10 and 11.
Correcting colors with white balance
Every light source emits a particular color cast. The old-fashioned fluorescent
lights found in most public restrooms, for example, put out a bluish-greenish
light, which is why our reflections in the mirrors in those restrooms always
look so sickly. And if you think that your beloved looks especially attractive by
candlelight, you aren’t imagining things: Candlelight casts a warm, yellow-red
glow that is flattering to the skin.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Fun facts about focal length
Every lens can be characterized by its focal
length, or in the case of a zoom lens, the range
of focal lengths it offers. Measured in millimeters,
focal length determines the camera’s angle of
view, the apparent size and distance of objects
in the scene, and depth of field. According to
photography tradition, a focal length of 50mm is
described as a “normal” lens. Most point-and-
shoot cameras feature this focal length, which is
a medium-range lens that works well for the type
of snapshots that users of those kinds of cam-
eras are likely to shoot.
A lens with a focal length under 35mm is char-
acterized as a wide-angle lens because at that
focal length, the camera has a wide angle of
view and produces a long depth of field, making
it good for landscape photography. A short focal
length also has the effect of making objects
seem smaller and farther away. At the other end
of the spectrum, a lens with a focal length
longer than 80mm is considered a telephoto
lens and often referred to as a long lens. With a
long lens, angle of view narrows, depth of field
decreases, and faraway subjects appear closer
and larger, which is ideal for wildlife and sports
photographers.
Note, however, that the focal lengths stated here
and elsewhere in the book are so-called 35mm
equivalent focal lengths. Here’s the deal: For rea-
sons that aren’t really important, when you put a
standard lens on most digital cameras, including
your D60, the available frame area is reduced, as
if you took a picture on a camera that uses 35mm
film negatives (the kind you’ve probably been
using for years) and then cropped it.
This so-called crop factor, sometimes also called
the magnification factor, varies depending on the
digital camera, which is why the photo industry
adopted the 35mm-equivalent measuring stick as
a standard. With the D60, the cropping factor is
roughly 1.5. So the 18–55mm kit lens, for exam-
ple, actually captures the approximate area you
would get from a 27–82mm lens on a 35mm film
camera. In the figure here, for example, the red
outline indicates the image area that results from
the 1.5 crop factor.

Science-y types measure the color of light, officially known as color tempera-
ture, on the Kelvin scale, which is named after its creator. You can see the
Kelvin scale in Figure 6-19.
When photographers talk about “warm light”
and “cool light,” though, they aren’t referring to
the position on the Kelvin scale — or at least
not in the way we usually think of tempera-
tures, with a higher number meaning hotter.
Instead, the terms describe the visual appear-
ance of the light. Warm light, produced by 
candles and incandescent lights, falls in the
red-yellow spectrum you see at the bottom of
the Kelvin scale in Figure 6-19; cool light, in the
blue-green spectrum, appears at the top of 
the Kelvin scale. 
At any rate, most of us don’t notice these fluc-
tuating colors of light because our eyes auto-
matically compensate for them. Except in very
extreme lighting conditions, a white tablecloth
appears white to us no matter whether we view
it by candlelight, fluorescent light, or regular
houselights.
Similarly, a digital camera compensates for different colors of light through a
feature known as white balancing. Simply put, white balancing neutralizes
light so that whites are always white, which in turn ensures that other colors
are rendered accurately. If the camera senses warm light, it shifts colors
slightly to the cool side of the color spectrum; in cool light, the camera shifts
colors the opposite direction.
The good news is that, as with your eyes, your camera’s Auto white balance
setting tackles this process remarkably well in most situations, which means
that you can usually ignore it and concentrate on other aspects of your pic-
ture. But if your scene is lit by two or more light sources that cast different
colors, the white balance sensor can get confused, producing an unwanted
color cast like the one you see in the left image in Figure 6-20.
157
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Note that although the area the lens can cap-
ture changes when you move a lens from a
35mm film camera to a digital body, depth of
field isn’t affected, nor are the spatial relation-
ships between objects in the frame. So when
lens shopping, you gauge those two charac-
teristics of the lens by looking at the stated
focal length — no digital-to-film conversion
math is required.

Figure 6-20: Multiple light sources resulted in a yellow color cast in Auto white balance 
mode (left); switching to the Incandescent setting solved the problem (right).
I shot this product image in my home studio, which I light primarily with a
couple of high-powered photo lights that use tungsten bulbs, which produce
light with a color temperature similar to regular household incandescent
bulbs. The problem is that the windows in that room also permit some pretty
strong daylight to filter through. In Auto white balance mode, the camera
reacted to that daylight — which has a cool color cast — and applied too
much warming, giving my original image a yellow tint. No problem: I just
switched the white balance mode from Auto to the Incandescent setting. 
The right image in Figure 6-20 shows the corrected colors.
There’s one little problem with white balancing as it’s implemented on your
D60, though. You can’t make this kind of manual white balance selection if
you shoot in the Auto mode or the Digital Vari-Program scene modes. So if
you spy color problems in your camera monitor, you need to switch to either
P, S, A, or M exposure mode. (Chapter 5 details all four modes.)

The next section explains precisely how to make a simple white balance cor-
rection; following that, you can explore some advanced white balance options.
Changing the white balance setting
To switch from automatic to manual white balancing, follow these steps:
1. Set the camera Mode dial to the P, S, A, or M exposure mode.
Again, you can tweak white balance only in these advanced exposure
modes.
2. Display the Shooting Info screen.
You can either press the Zoom button or press the shutter button half-
way and then release it. (Chapter 1 offers more explanation about using
the Shooting Info screen.)
3. Press the Zoom button to switch from the Shooting Info display to the
Quick Settings display.
You see the screen shown on the left in Figure 6-21.
Figure 6-21: WB stands for white balancing.
4. Use the Multi Selector to highlight the white balance option.
The control is the one highlighted in yellow in the left screen in 
Figure 6-21.
WB is the standard abbreviation for white balancing, in case you were
wondering. The abbreviation AWB is often used for auto white balancing
(but not on your D60).

Use the Multi Selector to scroll through the list of manual white balance
settings. You have seven choices, including a Preset option, which is an
advanced setting I discuss in the next section. (You can see only part of
the list of choices in Figure 6-21.)
6. Select the option that most closely matches your primary light source.
Table 6-1 deciphers the icons used to represent the different light sources;
the little example image in the monitor also can help you select the right
option.
7. Press OK.
You’re returned to the Quick Settings display and are now set to take
your picture at the selected white balance setting.
I need to share a few more bits of information about this setting:
 You also can change the white balance setting from the Shooting menu.
Highlight White Balance and then press OK to display the left screen 
you see in Figure 6-22. Highlight your choice and press OK again.
 If you select Fluorescent as the White Balance setting, as shown in
Figure 6-22, you can go a step further and specify which type of fluores-
cent bulb is in use. To do so, you must work through the Shooting menu
instead of the Quick Settings display. After highlighting Fluorescent, as
shown on the left in Figure 6-22, press the Multi Selector right to display
the second screen in the figure. Scroll through the list to highlight the
option that most closely matches your bulbs and then press OK. Press
OK again, and you’re taken to a screen where you can fine-tune the set-
ting even more. If you need to do so, the next section explains; if not,
just press OK once more to return to the Shooting menu.
Figure 6-22: You can select a specific type of fluorescent bulb.

 Your selected white balance setting remains in force for the P, S, A, and
M exposure modes until you change it again. So you may want to get in
the habit of resetting the option to the Auto setting after you finish
shooting whatever subject it was that caused you to switch to manual
white balance mode.

Fine-tuning white balance settings
If you can’t get the right amount of color correction from one of the six prefab
manual white balance settings, you can do a little fine-tuning via the Shooting
menu. Through the White Balance control on that menu, you can adjust the
amount of warming or cooling that is applied at the various white balance
settings. In fact, you can even specify that you want the camera to apply a
little more warming or cooling even in the Auto white balance mode.
Here’s how it works:

Figure 6-23: You can fine-tune the white balance settings via the Shooting menu.
2. Press OK to display a list of the available white balance settings, as
shown in the right image in Figure 6-23.
3. Highlight the setting you want to adjust and press the Multi Selector
right.
Now you’re taken to a screen where you can do your fine-tuning, as
shown in the left image in Figure 6-24.
If you select Fluorescent, you first go to the screen shown in Figure 6-22,
where you start the fine-tuning process by selecting a specific type of
bulb, as covered in the preceding section. After you highlight your
choice, press OK to get to the fine-tuning screen shown in Figure 6-24.
Figure 6-24: The asterisk next to the icon in the Shooting menu indicates that you fine-tuned
the setting.
White balance adjustment marker

4. Fine-tune the color adjustment that’s applied by the white balance
option you chose in Step 3.
You do this by moving the little black square, labeled “White Balance
adjustment marker” in Figure 6-24, in the color grid. The grid is set up
around two color pairs: Green and Magenta, represented by G and M;
and Blue and Amber, represented by B and A. By pressing the Multi
Selector, you can move the adjustment marker around the grid. 
As you move the marker, the A–B and G–M boxes on the right side of the
screen show you the current amount of color shift. A value of 0 indicates
the default amount of color compensation applied by the selected white
balance setting. In Figure 6-24, for example, I moved the marker two
levels toward blue to specify that I wanted colors to be a tad cooler.
If you’re familiar with traditional colored lens filters, you may know that
the density of a filter, which determines the degree of color correction it
provides, is measured in mireds (pronounced my-redds). The white bal-
ance grid is designed around this system: Moving the marker one level 
is the equivalent of adding a filter with a density of 5 mireds.
5. Press OK to return to the Shooting menu.
Notice the asterisk that appears next to the white balance symbol in the
menu, as shown in the right screen in Figure 6-24. That’s your reminder that
you tweaked the white balance setting. The asterisk also appears with the
white balance icon in the Shooting Info display.
Creating a white balance preset
If you can’t get the results you want from any of the standard white balance
options, even after adjusting them as described in the preceding section, you
can go one step further and take advantage of the Preset option on the White
Balance menu.
This feature enables you to do two things:
 You can base white balance on a direct measurement of the actual light-
ing conditions, which you accomplish by taking a picture of a white or
neutral gray card. This method is usually a faster way to get accurate
white balancing than fine-tuning one of the standard settings.
 You can match white balance to an existing photo. 
The next two sections provide you with the step-by-step instructions for
using both of these Preset options.
163
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color

164
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Setting white balance with direct measurement
To use this technique, you need a small piece of card stock that’s either neu-
tral gray or absolute white — not eggshell white, sand white, or any other
close-but-not-perfect white. (You can buy reference cards made just for this
purpose in many camera stores for under $20.)
Position the reference card so that it receives the same lighting you’ll use for
your photo. Then take these steps:
1. Set the camera to the P, S, A, or M exposure mode.
If the Shooting Info display or viewfinder reports that your image will be
under- or overexposed at the current settings, make the necessary
adjustments now. (Chapter 5 tells you how.) 
2. Display the Shooting menu, highlight White Balance, and press OK.
3. Highlight PRE (Preset Manual) and then press the Multi Selector right.
You need to scroll through the first screen of White Balance settings to
get to this option. After you press the Multi Selector right, you see the
screen shown on the left in Figure 6-25.
Figure 6-25: You can create a Preset white balance based on a direct measurement of the
current light.
4. Highlight Measure and press the Multi Selector right.
Now the screen shown on the right in Figure 6-25 appears.
5. Highlight Yes and press OK.
The camera instructs you to take a picture of your reference card, as
shown in the left screen of Figure 6-26. After a second or so, the message
disappears, and the screen and the viewfinder display begin to flash.
That’s your cue to move forward to Step 6.
6. Aim your lens at your reference card and frame the card so that it
completely fills the viewfinder.

Figure 6-26: After you take a picture of a white or gray reference card, the camera creates
your new white balance Preset.
7. Press the shutter button all the way down.
You don’t have to worry about focusing for this project.
If all went well, the message “Data Acquired” appears in the top left corner
of the Shooting Info display, as shown in the right screen in Figure 6-26.
(No picture is actually recorded.) If you see a message saying that the
camera couldn’t establish white balance, go back to Step 1 and try again.
Your custom white balance setting remains stored until the next time you
work your way through these steps. So anytime you’re shooting in the same
lighting conditions and want to apply the same white-balance correction, just
select PRE from the list of white balance settings.
Matching white balance to an existing photo
Suppose that you’re the marketing manager for a small business, and one of
your jobs is to shoot portraits of the company big-wigs for the annual report.
You build a small studio just for that purpose, complete with a couple of pho-
tography lights and a nice, conservative beige backdrop.
Of course, the big-wigs can’t all come to get their pictures taken in the same
month, let alone on the same day. But you have to make sure that the colors
in that beige backdrop remain consistent for each shot, no matter how much
time passes between photo sessions. This scenario is one possible use for an
advanced white balance feature that enables you to base white balance on 
an existing photo.
Basing white balance on an existing photo works well only in strictly con-
trolled lighting situations, where the color temperature of your lights is con-
sistent from day to day. Otherwise, the white balance setting that produces
color accuracy when you shoot Big Boss Number One may add an ugly color
cast to the one you snap of Big Boss Number Two.

To give this option a try, follow these steps:
1. Copy the picture that you want to use as the reference photo to your
camera memory card, if it isn’t already stored there.
You can copy the picture to the card using a card reader and whatever
method you usually use to transfer files from one drive to another. 
Copy the file to the folder named DCIM, inside the main folder, named
100NCD60 by default. (See Chapter 8 for help with working with files and
folders.)
2. Open the Shooting menu, highlight White Balance, and press OK.
3. Select PRE (Preset Manual) and press the Multi Selector right.
Again, you must scroll to the second page of White Balance settings to
uncover the PRE setting. After you press the Multi Selector right, the
screen shown on the left in Figure 6-27 appears.
Figure 6-27: You can base white balance on an existing photo.
4. Highlight Use Photo and press the Multi Selector right.
Now you see the second screen shown in Figure 6-27.
5. Highlight Select Image and press the Multi Selector right.
You then see a list of the folders on your memory card, as shown on the
left in Figure 6-28. (The folder name appears just as NCD60 on this screen.)
6. Highlight the folder named NCD60 and press the Multi Selector right.
You then see thumbnails of all images in the selected folder. (My folder
name reference here assumes that you stick with the default naming
system used by your camera. If you create custom folders, a trick you
can discover in Chapter 11, select the folder into which you stored 
your reference image.)

Figure 6-28: Select the folder containing your reference photo (left) and then scroll through
your images until your reference photo is highlighted (right).
7. Highlight your reference photo.
Just press the Multi Selector right and left as needed to scroll through
the thumbnails until the yellow highlight box surrounds the photo.
8. Press OK. 
White balance is established, and you’re returned to the Shooting Info
display.
A couple of notes about this feature:
 If you later do a direct white balance measurement by shooting a white or
gray card, that white balance setting becomes your new preset — the one
the camera applies when you select PRE as your white balance setting. 
 After you go through these steps, the white box shown in the second
screen in Figure 6-27 is replaced by the photo you selected as your refer-
ence photo. To reload that photo as your white balance preset, just
select This Image from that same screen and press OK.
 Only photos that you shoot with your D60 can serve as reference photos.
 Like the other white balance adjustments, this feature is available only
in the P, S, A, or M exposure modes.
Optimizing Image Sharpening and Color
Perched at the top of the Shooting menu, an option called Optimize Image
offers you one more way to tweak image sharpening, color, and contrast. 
167
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color

168
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Sharpening, in case you’re new to the digital meaning of the term, refers to a
software process that adjusts contrast in a way that creates the illusion of
slightly sharper focus. I explain sharpening fully in Chapter 10, but the impor-
tant thing to note for now is that sharpening produces a subtle tweak and is
not a fix for poor focus.
In fact, many of the adjustments that you can make through the Optimize
Image menu are pretty subtle, at least to my eye. The impact of any of these
settings varies depending on your subject, but on the whole, if you want to
make large-scale changes to color, contrast, or sharpening, you’re probably
going to need to use your computer and photo editing software.
Again, though, your mileage may vary, as they say, as may your opinion of
what constitutes the optimum color and sharpening characteristics. I happen
to think that the Nikon default settings are just ducky, but I leave it to you to
do your own testing and decide for yourself. (Inspect your test shots on your
computer monitor, where the differences produced by the various optimization
settings are easier to spot than on the camera monitor or on these pages.)
To explore your options, set your camera Mode dial to one of the advanced
exposure modes (P, S, A, or M). Then open the Shooting menu and highlight
Optimize Image, as shown in the left screen in Figure 6-29. Press OK to dis-
play the menu items you see in the right screen in the figure.
Figure 6-29: You can get even more control over color and sharpness via the Optimize Image
menu.
The menu offers you seven options, which produce the following results:
 Normal: The default setting, this option captures the image normally —
that is, using the characteristics that Nikon offers up as suitable for the
majority of subjects.
 Softer: This setting reduces image sharpening and contrast a little. 

 Vivid: In this mode, the camera amps up color saturation, contrast, and
sharpening. It’s designed for users who like bold, big colors and images
with sharp edges.
 More Vivid: This mode does about the same thing as Vivid, but to a
higher degree.
 Portrait: This mode reduces sharpening slightly less than the Softer
mode. Nikon recommends this mode for portraits, but either this mode
or Softer should work for that purpose. Contrast isn’t adjusted in this
mode, but colors are tweaked slightly to produce pleasing skin tones.
 Black-and-White: This setting produces, er, black-and-white photos.
Only in the digital world, they’re called grayscale images because a true
black-and-white image contains only black and white, with no shades of
gray.
 Custom: In this mode, you can get even more detailed about how you
want your image rendered, tweaking five different characteristics indi-
vidually. Explaining these options requires drilling down to a whole
’nother level of detail, so I cover them in their very own bulleted list,
coming up shortly.
Again, the extent to the settings affect
your image depends on the subject as
well as the exposure settings you
choose and the lighting conditions.
But just to give you a general idea of
what to expect, Figure 6-30 shows a
scene captured at the Normal setting,
and Figures 6-31 and 6-32 show how
the other settings rendered the same
subject. 
As for the Black-and-White setting, 
I’m not altogether keen on creating
grayscale images this way. I prefer 
to shoot in full color and then do 
my own grayscale conversion in my
photo editor instead of handing the
job over to the camera. Assuming that
you work with a decent photo editor,
you can control what original tones
are emphasized in your grayscale ver-
sion. Just as one example, Figure 6-33 shows you the camera-produced
grayscale version of my example photo compared with one that I created in
Adobe Photoshop Elements.

Image set to Normal mode.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 6-31: The Softer and Portrait modes produce slightly softer images.
Figure 6-32: Vivid and More Vivid modes increase contrast, saturation, and sharpness.
Also, you can always convert a color image to grayscale, but you can’t go the
other direction. So if you shoot in the black-and-white mode and then decide
you want a color image later, you’re out of luck. You do also have the option
to create a black-and-white copy of your color image right in the camera, too;
Chapter 11 shows you how. Again, though, you don’t have control over the
conversion as you do in a photo editor.

And now the promised details about the Custom optimization mode: If you
highlight this option, as shown on the left in Figure 6-34, and press the Multi
Selector right, you display a whole new menu, as shown on the right side of
the figure. Here’s a look at what each menu option enables you to do:
Figure 6-34: You can even create your own custom set of optimization settings.
 Image Sharpening: You can increase or decrease sharpening slightly via
this option. The Auto setting results in normal sharpening.
I really, really advise against cranking up sharpening. An oversharpened
image looks grainy and can even exhibit noticeable sharpening halos
(little strips of light and dark pixels along the edges of high-contrast
areas). You can’t get rid of these defects easily in a photo editor (if at
Camera black-and-white mode
Conversion done in photo software

Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color

172
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
all), so it’s best to stick with a low level of sharpening and then boost it a
little in your photo editor if needed. You can also control exactly where
and how the sharpening is applied in your photo editor, which you can’t
do with in-camera sharpening. See Chapter 10 for the full scoop on
sharpening.
That said, even images taken at the High sharpening setting, which
applies the maximum amount, don’t look drastically different from those
shot in the Normal setting. Only if you compare the None setting, which
applies no sharpening, and the High setting, do the levels of sharpening
appear distinct — and even then, the variations are subtle. For my pur-
poses, the Normal setting seems to work out just fine, but I do regularly
sharpen my photos slightly in my photo editor.
 Tone Compensation: This option adjusts allover contrast. Choose the 
–1 setting to reduce contrast slightly; select –2 for even more contrast
reduction. To go the other direction, choose +1 or +2. Select the 0 set-
ting, Auto, to let the camera handle the decision.
You also can select a Custom setting, but this option is designed to work
only with Nikon’s Camera Control Pro software. That program enables
you to control your camera by using your computer. (See Chapter 8 for
details.) If you do buy the software, you can use it to create and store a
custom tone compensation setting, or tone curve, that you can then
apply to your image.
 Color Mode: Normally, your camera captures images using the sRGB
color mode, which simply refers to an industry-standard spectrum of
colors. (The s is for standard, and the RGB is for red-green-blue, which
are the primary colors in the digital imaging color world.) This color
mode was created to help ensure color consistency as an image moves
from camera (or scanner) to monitor and printer; the idea was to create
a spectrum of colors that all these devices can reproduce.
However, the sRGB color spectrum leaves out some colors that can be
reproduced in print and onscreen, at least by some devices. So as an
alternative, your camera also enables you to shoot in the Adobe RGB
color mode, which includes a larger spectrum (or gamut) of colors.
Figure 6-35 offers an illustration of the two spectrums.
Note that in the camera menu, you actually get three options. Ia and IIIa
both give you sRGB, but the first is customized just a tad to better render
portraits. And the second, which is the default, is customized to capture
landscapes and nature shots. Choose II for Adobe RGB.
 Saturation: You get three options here: Normal, Moderate, and Enhanced.
Choose Moderate for less saturated colors; go with Enhanced for greater
saturation; select Normal for no saturation adjustment. At the default set-
ting, Auto, the camera determines the appropriate saturation level based
on the subject. 

Figure 6-35: Adobe RGB includes some colors not found in the sRGB spectrum.
Here again, I recommend that you don’t crank up saturation. Doing so
can actually rob your image of subtle details. Where you should have 
an expanse of pixels that range from medium-high to full saturation, 
for example, you instead get a big blob of fully saturated pixels. And as
with sharpening, you can control saturation adjustments, if needed, with
greater precision in a photo editing program.
 Hue Adjustment: This option is based on the RGB color wheel, which
plots out hues on a 360-degree circle. The Hue Adjustment option
enables you to shift colors around the wheel from –9 degrees to +9
degrees. 
In plain English, that means that if you choose a positive value, reds shift
toward orange, greens become a little bluer, and blues take on a touch of
purple. If you go the other direction, reds become more purple, blues get
a little greener, and greens become more yellow. At the default setting, 0,
no adjustment is made. Just for fun, Figure 6-36 shows you the result of
shooting my example image at –9 and +9, respectively.

Figure 6-36: The Hue control enables you to shift all colors around the RGB color wheel.
After you select your choice for each of these settings, press OK to return to
the main Custom menu. Then scroll up the menu to highlight Done (as shown
in Figure 6-34) and then press OK. Don’t skip the Done step, or your settings
aren’t saved, by the way.
Remember that all of these settings apply only to pictures that you take in
the P, S, A, and M exposure modes, too; you give up control of these and
other picture characteristics when you shoot in full auto or the Digital 
Vari-Program modes.

arlier chapters of this book break down each and every picture-taking
feature on your D60, describing in detail how the various controls affect
exposure, picture quality, focus, color, and the like. This chapter pulls all that
information together to help you set up your camera for specific types of
photography.
The first few pages offer a quick summary of 11 critical pic-
ture-taking settings that should serve you well no matter
what your subject. Following that, I offer my advice on
which settings to use for portraits, action shots, land-
scapes, and close-ups. To wrap things up, the end 
of the chapter includes some miscellaneous tips 
for dealing with special shooting situations and 
subjects.
Keep in mind that although I present specific recom-
mendations here, there are no hard and fast rules as
to the “right way” to shoot a portrait, a landscape, or
whatever. So don’t be afraid to wander off on your own,
tweaking this exposure setting or adjusting that focus con-

part of the fun of photography, after all — and thanks to your camera
monitor and the Delete button, it’s an easy, completely free proposition.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Recapping Basic Picture Settings
Your subject, creative goals, and lighting conditions determine which settings
you should use for some picture-taking options, such as aperture and shutter
speed. I offer my take on those options throughout this chapter. But for the
basic options shown in Table 7-1, I recommend the same settings for almost
every shooting scenario, with the few caveats mentioned in the following
descriptions:

 Optimize Image: Through this option, you can adjust image sharpness,
color, and contrast. I suggest that you stick with the default setting,
Normal, and make such adjustments in your photo software, where you
have more control over the outcome. Chapter 6 details the settings if
you want to try them out for yourself, however.
 Image Quality: This setting, introduced in Chapter 3, determines the file
format, or type, of picture file the camera creates. For best quality,
choose JPEG Fine or NEF (Raw). Keep in mind that you must process
NEF files in a raw converter; Chapter 8 explains that issue.

 Image Size: Also covered in Chapter 3, this setting determines resolution
(pixel count). The Medium setting (5.6 MP) is fine for everyday photos;
select Large (10.2 MP) if you may want to crop the photo, print it very
large, or both.
 White Balance: White balance compensates for the color casts produced
by different light sources. Auto mode usually does the trick unless you’re
dealing with multiple light sources; in that case, you may need to switch
to manual white balance control. Chapter 6 tells you how.
 ISO Sensitivity and ISO Auto: These two settings relate to the light sen-
sitivity of the camera’s image sensor. Increasing the ISO Sensitivity value
can create noise defects, so stick with the lowest setting possible given
the available light. I also recommend that you turn off Auto ISO so that
you, and not the camera, control this critical setting. Chapter 5 details
both issues.
 Noise Reduction: This in-camera software filter attempts to remove
noise, a defect that can occur when you use a high ISO Sensitivity setting
or a very slow shutter speed. I keep this option turned off because it can
result in slight loss of image sharpness and adds to the time the camera
needs to record the picture to the memory card. For more information,
see Chapter 5.
 Focus mode: Chapter 6 details this option, which affects the autofocus
system. In the AF-A (auto-servo) mode, the camera chooses the best 
autofocus mode based on whether it thinks you’re shooting a still or
moving subject. In most cases, this setting works well.
 Release mode: This setting enables you to shift from single-shot 
shooting — in which you record a single image each time you press the
shutter button — to continuous, self-timer, or remote-control shooting.
Single mode is the best choice in most cases, but continuous can come
in handy for action shots, as covered later in this chapter. And self-timer
mode enables you to get into the shot. Chapter 2 explains all the Release
mode settings.
 Metering: This option determines what part of the frame the camera
analyzes when calculating exposure. Matrix metering takes the whole
frame into account, which produces good results for most scenes. See
Chapter 5 for the scoop on the other two options, Center-Weighted and
Spot metering.
 Active D-Lighting: This feature, covered in Chapter 5, is designed to
help you capture high-contrast scenes in a way that brightens the dark-
est areas without simultaneously making the highlights too hot. It can
work wonders in the right lighting conditions, but because it also
increases the time that the camera needs to process and store the pic-
ture file, preventing you from shooting at a quick pace, I recommend
that you keep it turned off until you need its help.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
A few final reminders:
 As indicated in Table 7-1, you can’t adjust the Optimize Image, White
Balance, ISO Auto, or Metering settings if you shoot in Auto or the Digital
Vari-Program scene modes. If you want to tweak these settings, you must
set the camera Mode dial to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, S,
A, or M).
 You can check the status of all settings except Noise Reduction by look-
ing at the Shooting Info display. Figure 7-1 offers a reminder of where to
find the various options. Note that the ISO Auto icon doesn’t appear if
you disable the feature, which is why the icon isn’t included in Figure 7-1.
If you do turn on the option, you see the letters ISO-A just to the left of
the Optimize Image indicator.
 After activating the Shooting Info display, you can press the Zoom button
to shift to Quick Settings mode and then adjust most settings through that
display instead of digging through the menus. See Chapter 1 for details on
adjusting settings this way. The exceptions are the ISO Auto and Optimize
Image options, which can be changed only through the menus.
 You can quickly enable and disable Active D-Lighting by rotating the
Command dial while pressing the button shown in the margin here. The
button’s on top of the camera, near the shutter button. As long as you
hold down the Active D-Lighting button, the viewfinder reports the
on/off status of the feature. See Chapter 5 for details.

Setting Up for Specific Scenes
For the most part, the settings detailed in the preceding section fall into the
“set ’em and forget ’em” category. That leaves you free to concentrate on a
handful of other camera options, such as aperture and shutter speed, that
you can manipulate to achieve a specific photographic goal.
The next four sections explain which of these additional options typically
produce the best results when you’re shooting portraits, action shots, land-
scapes, and close-ups. I offer a few compositional and creative tips along the
way — but again, remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and for
every so-called rule, there are plenty of great images that prove the exception.
Shooting still portraits
By “still portrait,” I mean that your subject isn’t moving. For subjects who
aren’t keen on sitting still long enough to have their picture taken — children,
pets, and even some teenagers I know — skip ahead to the next section and
use the techniques given for action photography instead.
Assuming that you do have a subject willing to pose, the classic portraiture
approach is to keep the subject sharply focused while throwing the back-
ground into soft focus. This artistic choice emphasizes the subject and helps
diminish the impact of any distracting background objects in cases where
you can’t control the setting. The following steps show you how to achieve
this look: 
1. Set the Mode dial to A (aperture-priority autoexposure) and select the
lowest f-stop value possible.
As Chapter 5 explains, a low f-stop setting opens the aperture, which not
only allows more light to enter the camera but also shortens depth of
field, or the range of sharp focus. So dialing in a low f-stop value is the
first step in softening your portrait background. (The f-stop range avail-
able to you depends on your lens.) Also keep in mind that the farther
your subject is from the background, the more blurring you can achieve.
I recommend aperture-priority mode when depth of field is a primary
concern because you can control the f-stop while relying on the camera
to select the shutter speed that will properly expose the image. Just
rotate the Command dial to select your desired f-stop. (You do need to
pay attention to shutter speed also, however, to make sure that it’s not
so slow that any movement of the subject or camera will blur the image.)
If you aren’t comfortable with this advanced exposure mode, Child and
Portrait modes also result in a more open aperture, although the exact 
f-stop setting is out of your control. Chapter 2 details these two modes.
179
Chapter 7: Putting It All Together

180
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Whichever mode you choose, you can monitor the current aperture and
shutter speed both in the Shooting Info display, as shown on the left in
Figure 7-2, and in the viewfinder display, as shown on the right. 
Figure 7-2: You can view exposure settings in the Shooting Info display or viewfinder.
2. To further soften the background, zoom in, get closer, or both.
As covered in Chapter 6, zoom-
ing in to a longer focal length
also reduces depth of field, as
does moving physically closer
to your subject.
Avoid using a lens with a short
focal length (a wide-angle lens)
for portraits. They can cause
features to appear distorted —
sort of like how people look
when you view them through 
a security peephole in a door.
3. For indoor portraits, shoot
flash-free if possible.
Shooting by available light
rather than flash produces
softer illumination and avoids
the problem of red-eye. To get
enough light to go flash-free,
turn on room lights or, during
daylight, pose your subject next
to a sunny window, as I did for
the image in Figure 7-3.
Shutter speed and aperture (f-stop)
Figure 7-3: For more pleasing indoor portraits,
shoot by available light instead of using flash.

In the A exposure mode, simply keeping the built-in flash unit closed dis-
ables the flash. In Child or Portrait mode, hold the Flash button on the
side of the camera and rotate the Command dial until you see the flash-
off symbol (the lightning bolt with a slash) in the Shooting Info display.
If flash is unavoidable, see my list of flash tips at the end of the steps to
get better results.
4. For outdoor portraits, use a flash.
Even in bright daylight, a flash adds a beneficial pop of light to subjects’
faces, as discussed in Chapter 5 and illustrated here in Figure 7-4.
In the A exposure mode, just press the Flash button on the side of the
camera to enable the flash. For daytime portraits, use the fill flash set-
ting. (That’s the regular, basic flash mode.) For nighttime images, try
red-eye reduction or slow-sync mode; again, see the flash tips at the end
of these steps to use either mode most effectively.
Unfortunately, Child and Portrait modes both employ Auto flash, and if
the ambient light is very bright, the flash may not fire. Switch to an
advanced exposure mode (A, S, P, or M) to regain flash control.

5. Press and hold the shutter button halfway to establish and lock focus.
Make sure that the active autofocus area falls over your subject. In the
viewfinder, the active focus area is indicated by the pair of brackets 
that turns red when you depress the shutter button halfway. Chapter 6
explains more about using autofocus, but if you have trouble, simply 
set your lens to manual focus mode and then twist the focusing ring 
to set focus.
6. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to capture the image.
Again, these steps just give you a starting point for taking better portraits. 
A few other tips can also improve your people pics:
 Pay attention to the background. Scan the entire frame looking for
intrusive objects that may distract the eye from the subject. If neces-
sary, reposition the subject against a more flattering backdrop. Inside, a
softly textured wall works well; outdoors, trees and shrubs can provide
nice backdrops as long as they aren’t so ornate or colorful that they
diminish the subject (for example, a magnolia tree laden with blooms).
 Pay attention to white balance if your subject is lit by both flash and
ambient light. If you set the white balance setting to Auto, as I recom-
mend in Table 7-1, enabling flash tells the camera to warm colors to com-
pensate for the cool light of a flash. If your subject is also lit by room
lights or sunlight, the result may be colors that are slightly warmer than
neutral. This warming effect typically looks nice in portraits, giving the
skin a subtle glow. But if you aren’t happy with the result or want even
more warming, see Chapter 6 to find out how to fine-tune white balance.
Again, you can make this adjustment only in P, S, A, or M exposure modes.
 When flash is unavoidable, try these tricks to produce better results.
The following techniques can help solve flash-related issues:
• Indoors, turn on as many room lights as possible. With more ambient
light, you reduce the flash power that’s needed to expose the pic-
ture. This step also causes the pupils to constrict, further reducing
the chances of red-eye. (Pay heed to my white balance warning,
however.)
• Try setting the flash to red-eye reduction or slow-sync mode. If you
choose the first option, warn your subject to expect both a pre-
flash, which constricts pupils, and the actual flash. And remember
that slow-sync flash uses a slower-than-normal shutter speed,
which produces softer lighting and brighter backgrounds than
normal flash. (Chapter 5 has an example.) This mode is available 
in P and A exposure modes and is also the default setting in Night
Portrait mode.

Remember that the slow shutter speed of slow-sync mode means
that you should use a tripod and ask your subject to stay very still
to avoid blurring.
• Soften the flash light by attaching a diffuser to the flash head. This
inexpensive tool both softens and spreads the light. You can see a
picture of one type of diffuser in Chapter 5. You may need to bump
up exposure slightly to compensate for the light filtering that
occurs; the camera doesn’t know that you attached the diffuser
and therefore doesn’t adjust the exposure on its own. In the P, S,
and A autoexposure modes, you can use exposure compensation
to adjust the image brightness. As an alternative, you can increase
the flash power slightly. Chapter 5 details these exposure features.
• For professional results, use an external flash with a rotating flash
head. Then aim the flash head upward so that the flash light
bounces off the ceiling and falls softly down onto the subject. An
external flash isn’t cheap, but the results make the purchase
worthwhile if you shoot lots of portraits. Compare the two por-
traits in Figure 7-5 for an illustration. In the first example, the built-
in flash resulted in strong shadowing behind the subject and
harsh, concentrated light. To produce the better result on the
right, I used the Nikon Speedlight SB-600 and bounced the light off
the ceiling. 
Figure 7-5: To eliminate harsh lighting and strong shadows (left), I used bounce flash and
moved the subject farther from the background (right).
183
Chapter 7: Putting It All Together

184
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
• To reduce shadowing from the flash, move your subject farther from
the background. I took this extra step for the right image in Figure
7-5. The increased distance not only reduced shadowing but also
softened the focus of the wall a bit (because of the short depth of
field resulting from my f-stop and focal length).
A good general rule is to position your subjects far enough from
the background that they can’t touch it. If that isn’t possible,
though, try going the other direction: If the person’s head is smack
up against the background, any shadow will be smaller and less
noticeable. For example, you get less shadowing when a subject’s
head is resting against a sofa cushion than if that person is sitting
upright, with the head a foot or so away from the cushion.
 Frame the subject loosely to allow for later cropping to a variety of
frame sizes. Your D60 produces images that have an aspect ratio of 3:2.
That means that your portrait perfectly fits a 4-x-6-inch print size but
will require cropping to print at any other proportions, such as 5 x 7 or 
8 x 10. Chapter 9 talks more about this issue.
Capturing action
A fast shutter speed is the key to capturing a blur-free shot of any moving
subject, whether it’s your tennis-playing teen, a spinning Ferris wheel, or, as
in the case of Figure 7-6, a butterfly dancing from flower to flower. In the left
image, a shutter speed of 1/125 second was too slow, resulting in some slight
blurring of the butterfly. For the right image, I bumped the shutter speed up
to 1/320 second, which “froze” the butterfly.
Figure 7-6: Raising the shutter speed produced the blur-free image on the right.
1/125 second
1/320 second

Along with the basic capture settings outlined in Table 7-1, try the techniques
in the following steps to photograph a subject in motion:
1. Set the Mode dial to S (shutter-priority autoexposure).
In this mode, you control the shutter speed, and the camera takes care
of choosing an aperture setting that will produce a good exposure. 
If you aren’t ready to step up to this advanced exposure mode,
explained in Chapter 5, try using Sports mode, detailed in Chapter 2. But
be aware that you have no control over any other aspects of your picture
(such as white balance, flash, and so on) in that mode.
2. Rotate the Command dial to select the shutter speed.
Refer to Figure 7-7 to locate shutter speed in the Shooting Info display.
After you select the shutter speed, the camera selects an aperture 
(f-stop) to match.
What shutter speed do you need exactly? Well, it depends on the speed
at which your subject is moving, so some experimentation is needed. But
generally speaking, 1/500 second should be plenty for all but the fastest
subjects (race cars, boats, and so on). For very slow subjects, you can
even go as low as 1/250 or 1/125 second.
Figure 7-7: Changing the Release mode to Continuous allows rapid-fire shooting.
3. Raise the ISO setting or add flash to produce a brighter exposure if
needed.
In dim lighting, you may not be able to get a good exposure at your
chosen shutter speed without taking this step. Raising the ISO does
increase the possibility of noise, but a noisy shot is better than a blurry
shot. Figure 7-7 reminds you of where to find the current ISO setting in
the Shooting Info display. (Note that in Sports mode, the camera auto-
matically overrides your ISO setting if it deems it necessary. For more on
this automatic ISO adjustment, see Chapter 5.)

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Adding flash is a bit tricky for action shots, unfortunately. First, the flash
needs time to recycle between shots, so try to go without if you want 
to capture images at a fast pace. Second, the built-in flash has limited
range — so don’t waste your time if your subject isn’t close by. And
third, remember that the fastest shutter speed you can use with flash 
is 1/200 second, which may not be high enough to capture a quickly
moving subject without blur.
If you do decide to use flash, you must bail out of Sports mode, though;
it doesn’t permit you to use flash.
4. For rapid-fire shooting, set the Release mode to Continuous.
In this mode, you can capture multiple images with a single press of the
shutter button. As long as you hold down the button, the camera contin-
ues to record images, at a pace of up to three frames per second.
To achieve the maximum frames-per-second rate, you need to focus
manually and select a shutter speed of 1/250 second or higher. Also, you
can’t take advantage of flash; as soon as you enable the flash, you’re lim-
ited to taking one shot at a time even if you select Continuous as your
Release mode.
To adjust the Release mode, display the Shooting Info screen, and press
the Zoom button to switch to the Quick Settings display. Highlight the
Release mode option (look for it in the position labeled in Figure 7-7),
press OK, select a mode, and press OK again.
5. For fastest shooting, switch to manual focusing.
Again, manual focusing helps you get the fastest frames-per-second rate
because you then eliminate the time the camera needs to lock focus in
autofocus mode. Chapter 1 shows you how to focus manually, if you
need help.
If you do use autofocus, try these two autofocus settings for best 
performance:
• Set the AF-area mode to Dynamic Area. 
• Set the Focus mode to AF-C (continuous-servo autofocus).
Chapter 6 details these autofocus options, which you can select via the
Quick Settings display. The options appear set to my recommended set-
tings in Figure 7-7. You may not actually need to change the Focus mode,

though; in the auto-servo mode, AF-A, which is the default setting, the
camera automatically shifts to continuous-servo autofocus if it senses
movement from the subject.
6. Turn off Image Review and Active D-Lighting to speed up the camera
even more.
You turn off Image Review via the Custom Setting menu. Turning the
option off can help speed up the time your camera needs to recover
between shots. Active D-Lighting also increases the time the camera
needs to record the image; you can turn off this feature via the Shooting
menu or by simply pressing the Active D-Lighting button on top of the
camera as you rotate the Command dial.
7. Compose the subject to allow for movement across the frame.
In my example images, for instance, I zoomed out to a wide view so that
my subject wouldn’t fly out of the frame.
8. Lock in autofocus (if used) in advance.
Press the shutter button halfway to do so. Now when the action occurs,
just press the shutter button the rest of the way. Your image-capture
time is faster because the camera has already done the work of estab-
lishing focus.
Using these techniques should give you a better chance of capturing any fast-
moving subject. But action-shooting strategies also are helpful for shooting
candid portraits of kids and pets. Even if they aren’t currently running, leap-
ing, or otherwise cavorting, snapping a shot before they do move or change
positions is often tough. So if an interaction or scene catches your eye, set
your camera into action mode and then just fire off a series of shots as fast 
as you can.
For example, one recent afternoon, I spotted my furball and his equally fluffy
new neighbor introducing themselves to each other through the fence that
separates their yards. I ran and grabbed my camera, flipped it into shutter-
priority mode, and just started shooting. Most of the images were throw-
aways; you can see some of them in Figure 7-8. But somewhere around the
tenth frame, I captured the moment you see in Figure 7-9, which puts a whole
new twist on the phrase “gossiping over the backyard fence.” Two seconds
later, the dogs got bored with each other and scampered away into their
respective yards, but thanks to a fast shutter, I got the shot that I wanted.

Figure 7-8: I used speed-shooting techniques to capture this interaction between a pair of pups.
Figure 7-9: Although most of the shots were deletable, this one was a keeper.

Capturing scenic vistas
Providing specific capture settings for landscape photography is tricky
because there’s no single best approach to capturing a beautiful stretch 
of countryside, a city skyline, or other vast subject. Take depth of field, for
example: One person’s idea of a super cityscape might be to keep all build-
ings in the scene sharply focused. But another photographer might prefer to
shoot the same scene so that a foreground building is sharply focused while
the others are less so, thus drawing the eye to that first building.
That said, I can offer a few tips to help you photograph a landscape the way
you see it:
 Shoot in aperture-priority auto-
exposure mode (A) so that you
can control depth of field. If
you want extreme depth of field,
so that both near and distant
objects are sharply focused, 
as in Figure 7-10, select a high 
f-stop value. For short depth of
field, use a low value.
You can also use the Landscape
Digital Vari-Program scene
mode to achieve the first objec-
tive. In this mode, the camera
automatically selects a high f-
stop number, but you have no
control over the exact value 
(or any other picture-taking 
settings).
 If the exposure requires a slow
shutter, use a tripod to avoid
blurring. The downside to a
high f-stop is that you need a
slower shutter speed to pro-
duce a good exposure. If the
shutter speed drops below 
what you can comfortably 
hand-hold — for me, that’s
about 1/50 second — use a tripod to avoid picture-blurring camera
shake. No tripod handy? Look for any solid surface on which you can
steady the camera. Of course, you can always increase the ISO
Sensitivity setting to allow a faster shutter, too, but that option brings
with it the chances of increased image noise. See Chapter 5 for details.
189
Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
Figure 7-10: Use a high f-stop value (or
Landscape mode) to keep foreground and
background sharply focused.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 For dramatic waterfall shots,
consider using a slow shutter to
create that “misty” look. The
slow shutter blurs the water,
giving it a soft, romantic appear-
ance. Figure 7-11 shows you a
close-up of this effect. Again, use
a tripod to ensure that the rest of
the scene doesn’t also blur due to
camera shake.
 At sunrise or sunset, base expo-
sure on the sky. The foreground
will be dark, but you can usually
brighten it in a photo editor if
needed. If you base exposure on
the foreground, on the other
hand, the sky will become so
bright that all the color will be
washed out — a problem you usu-
ally can’t fix after the fact.
As an alternative, turn on Active
D-Lighting. With this feature
enabled, the camera brightens
dark areas but doesn’t alter the
highlights, leaving your sky colors
intact. Chapter 5 explains more
about this feature. (Remember, you can turn Active D-Lighting on and off
by pressing the button you see in the margin here as you rotate the
Command dial.)
 For cool nighttime city pics, experiment with slow shutter. Assuming
that cars or other vehicles are moving through the scene, the result is
neon trails of light like those you see in the foreground of the image in
Figure 7-12, taken by my friend Jonathan Conrad. Shutter speed for this
image was 5 seconds.
Instead of changing the shutter speed manually between each shot, try
bulb mode. Available only in M (manual) exposure mode, this option
records an image for as long as you hold down the shutter button. So
just take a series of images, holding the button down for different
lengths of time for each shot. In bulb mode, you also can exceed the
standard maximum shutter speed of 30 seconds.
 For the best lighting, shoot during the “magic hours.” That’s the term
photographers use for early morning and late afternoon, when the light
cast by the sun is soft and warm, giving everything that beautiful, gently
warmed look.
Figure 7-11: For misty waterfalls, use a slow
shutter speed (and tripod).

Can’t wait for the perfect light? Tweak your camera’s white balance set-
ting, using the instructions laid out in Chapter 6, to simulate magic-hour
light.
 In tricky light, bracket expo-
sures. Bracketing simply means to
take the same picture at several
different exposures to increase
the odds that at least one of them
will capture the scene the way
you envision. Bracketing is espe-
cially a good idea in difficult light-
ing situations such as sunrise and
sunset.
In manual exposure mode, simply
adjust the aperture or shutter
speed between each shot to do
this. In P, S, or A autoexposure
modes, you instead must use the
Exposure Compensation control
to achieve a brighter or darker
exposure than what the camera
considers appropriate. Chapter 5
details this control. Unfortunately,
you can’t take advantage of
Exposure Compensation in any 
of the fully automatic exposure
modes, but you can choose 
to enable or disable Active 
D-Lighting.
 Worry about wide-
angle distortion
later. Shooting with
a wide-angle lens can
cause vertical struc-
tures to appear to
tilt either inward 
or outward, as in
Figure 7-13. You can’t
do anything to avoid
this problem, known
as convergence,
unless you buy a
very expensive lens
designed especially
to avoid it.

Fortunately, many

grams enable you to

tive of your images
to straighten things
out again. I used the

Photoshop Elements
to produce the cor-
rected image in
Figure 7-14.
Capturing dynamic close-ups
For great close-up shots with your Nikon, start with the basic capture set-
tings outlined in Table 7-1. Then try the following additional settings and
techniques:
 Check your owner’s manual to
find out the minimum close-
focusing distance of your lens.
How “up close and personal”
you can get to your subject
depends on your lens, not the
camera body itself. 
 Take control over depth of
field by setting the camera
mode to A (aperture-priority
autoexposure) mode. Whether
you want a shallow, medium, or
extreme depth of field depends
on the point of your photo. In
classic nature photography, for
example, the artistic tradition is
a very shallow depth of field, as
shown in Figure 7-15, and
requires an open aperture (low
f-stop value). For this image, 
the f-stop was f/5.6. But if you
want the viewer to be able to

to straighten things out.
Figure 7-15: Shallow depth of field is a classic
technique for close-up floral images.

clearly see all details throughout the frame — for example, if you’re
shooting a product shot for your company’s sales catalog — you need to
go the other direction, stopping down the aperture as far as possible.
Not ready for the advanced exposure modes yet? Try the Close Up scene
mode instead. (It’s the one marked with the little flower on your Mode
dial.) In this mode, the camera automatically opens the aperture to
achieve a short depth of field and bases focus on the center of the frame.
 Remember that zooming in and getting close to your subject both
decrease depth of field. So back to that product shot: If you need depth
of field beyond what you can achieve with the aperture setting, you may
need to back away, zoom out, or both. (You can always crop your image
to show just the parts of the subject that you want to feature.)
 When shooting flowers and other nature scenes outdoors, pay atten-
tion to shutter speed, too. Even a slight breeze may cause your subject
to move, causing blurring at slow shutter speeds.
 Use flash for better outdoor lighting. Just as with portraits, a tiny bit of
flash typically improves close-ups when the sun is your primary light
source. However, keep in mind that the maximum shutter speed possible
when you use flash is 1/200 second. So in very bright light, you may
need to use a high f-stop setting to avoid overexposing the picture. If
you shoot in an advanced exposure mode (M, P, S, or A), you can also
adjust the flash output via the camera’s Flash Compensation control.
Chapter 5 offers details about flash and flash compensation.
 When shooting indoors, try not to use flash as your primary light
source. Because you’ll be shooting at close range, the light from your
flash may be too harsh even at a low Flash Compensation setting. If flash
is inevitable, turn on as many room lights as possible to reduce the 
flash power that’s needed — even a hardware-store shop light can do in
a pinch as a lighting source. (Remember that if you have multiple light
sources, though, you may need to tweak the white balance setting.)
 To really get close to your subject, invest in a macro lens or a set of
diopters. A true macro lens, which enables you to get really, really close
to your subjects, is an expensive proposition; expect to pay around $200
or more. But if you enjoy capturing the tiny details in life, it’s worth the
investment. 
For a less expensive way to go, you can spend about $40 for a set of
diopters, which are sort of like reading glasses that you screw onto your
existing lens. Diopters come in several strengths — +1, +2, + 4, and so on —
with a higher number indicating a greater magnifying power. I took this
approach to capture the extreme close-up in Figure 7-16, attaching a +2
diopter to my lens. The downfall of diopters, sadly, is that they typically
produce images that are very soft around the edges, as in Figure 7-16 —
a problem that doesn’t occur with a good macro lens.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Coping with Special
Situations
A few subjects and shooting situa-
tions pose some additional chal-
lenges not already covered in earlier
sections. So to wrap up this chapter, 
here’s a quick list of ideas for tack-
ling a variety of common “tough-
shot” photos:
 Shooting through glass: To cap-
ture subjects that are behind
glass, try putting your lens right
flat against the glass. Then
switch to manual focusing; the
glass barrier can give the 
autofocus mechanism fits.
Disable your flash to avoid cre-
ating any unwanted reflections,
too. I used this technique at the
zoo to capture the snake image
you see in Figure 7-17.
 Shooting out a car window: Set
the camera to shutter-priority
autoexposure or manual mode
and dial in a fast shutter speed to
compensate for the movement of the
car. Oh, and keep a tight grip on your
camera. 
 Shooting in strong backlighting:
When the light behind your subject is
very strong, the result is often an
underexposed subject. You have a
couple of options: You can turn on
your flash, assuming that the subject
isn’t beyond its reach. Or you can
turn on Active D-Lighting, which cap-
tures the image in a way that retains
better detail in the shadows without
blowing out highlights. (Chapter 5
offers an example.)
But for another creative choice, you
can purposely underexpose the sub-
ject to create a silhouette effect, as
Figure 7-16: To extend your lens’ close-focus
ability, you can add magnifying diopters.
Figure 7-17: He’s watching you . . . 

shown in Figure 7-18. Just base your exposure on the sky and turn off
Active D-Lighting so that the darker areas of the frame remain dark. (For
indoor silhouettes, you must disable your flash.) 
 Shooting fireworks: First off, use a tripod; fireworks require a long expo-
sure, and trying to handhold your camera simply isn’t going to work. If
using a zoom lens, zoom out to the shortest focal length. Switch to
manual focusing and set focus at infinity (the farthest focus point possi-
ble on your lens). Set the exposure mode to manual, choose a relatively
high f-stop setting — say, f/16 or so — and start a shutter speed of 1 to 3
seconds. From there, it’s simply a matter of experimenting with different
shutter speeds.
Be especially gentle when you
press the shutter button — with
a very slow shutter, you can
easily create enough camera
movement to blur the image. If
you purchased the accessory
remote control for your camera,
this is a good situation in which
to use it.
You also may want to enable
your camera’s noise-reduction
feature because a long exposure
also increases the chances 
of noise defects. See Chapter 5
for details. (Keep the ISO
Sensitivity setting low to further
dampen noise.)
 Shooting reflective surfaces: In
outdoor shots taken in bright
sun, you can reduce glare from
reflective surfaces such as glass
and metal by using a circular
polarizing filter, which you can
buy for about $40. A polarizing
filter can also help out when
you’re shooting through glass, 
as I did for my snake image.
But know that in order for the filter to work, the sun, your subject, and
your camera lens must be precisely positioned. Your lens must be at a
90-degree angle from the sun, for example, and the light source must
also be reflecting off the surface at a certain angle and direction. In addi-
tion, a polarizing filter also intensifies blue skies in some scenarios,
which may or may not be to your liking. In other words, a polarizing
filter isn’t a surefire cure-all.

A more reliable option for shooting small reflective objects is to invest 
in a light cube or light tent such as the ones shown in Figure 7-19, from
Cloud Dome (www.clouddome.com) and Lastolite (www.lastolite.com),
respectively. You place the reflective object inside the tent or cube and
then position your lights around the outside. The cube or tent acts as a
light diffuser, reducing reflections. Prices range from about $50 to $200,
depending on size and features.

or many novice digital photographers (and even some experienced
ones), the task of moving pictures to the computer and then keeping
track of all of those image files is one of the more confusing aspects
of the art form. In fact, students in my classes have more ques-
tions about this subject than just about anything else.
Frankly, writing about the download and organizing
process isn’t all that easy, either. (I know, poor me!)
The problem is that providing you with detailed
instructions is pretty much impossible because the
steps you need to take vary widely depending on
what software you have installed on your computer
and whether you use the Windows or Macintosh
operating system.
To give you as much help as possible, however, this
chapter shows you how to transfer and organize pictures
using the free Nikon software that came in your camera box.
After exploring these discussions, you should be able to adapt
the steps to any other photo program you may prefer.
This chapter also covers a few other aspects of handling your picture files,
including converting pictures taken in the NEF (Raw) format to a standard
image format. Finally — and perhaps most important — this chapter explains
how to ensure that your digital images stay safe after they leave the camera.

One note before you dig in: Most figures in this chapter and elsewhere feature
the Windows Vista operating system. If you use some other version of
Windows or own a Mac, what you see on your screen may look slightly differ-
ent but should contain the same basic options unless I specify otherwise.
Sending Pictures to the Computer
You can take two approaches to moving pictures from your camera memory
card to your computer:
 Connect the camera directly to the computer. For this option, you need
to dig out the USB cable that came in your camera box. Your computer
must also have a free USB slot, or port, in techie talk. If you’re not sure
what these gadgets look like, Figure 8-1 gives you a look.
The little three-pronged icon, labeled in Figure 8-1, is the universal symbol
for USB. Be sure to check for this symbol because a different type of slot,
called a FireWire slot, looks very similar to a USB slot, and your USB cable
can even seem to fit (sort of) into a FireWire slot.

 Transfer images using a memory card reader. Many computers now
also have slots that accept common types of memory cards. If so, you
can simply pop the card out of your camera and into the card slot
instead of hooking the camera up to the computer.
As another option, you can buy
stand-alone card readers such
as the SanDisk model shown in
Figure 8-2. This particular
model accepts a variety of
memory cards, including the
SD Card used by your D60.
Check your printer, too; many
printers now have card slots
that serve the purpose of a
card reader.
I prefer to use a card reader, for two
reasons: First, when you transfer via
the camera, the camera must be
turned on during the process, wast-
ing battery power. Second, with a
card reader, I don’t have to keep
track of that elusive camera cable.
And third, when I copy photos to
my desktop system, transferring via
the camera requires that I get down
on all fours to plug the cable into
the computer’s USB slot, which is of
course located in the least convenient spot possible. The card reader, by con-
trast, stays perched on my desk, connected to my computer at all times, so
there’s very little physical activity involved in transferring pictures, which is
how I prefer to live my life.
If you want to transfer directly from the camera, however, the next section
explains some important steps you need to take to make that option work. If
you choose to use a card reader, skip ahead to the section “Starting the trans-
fer process” to get an overview of what happens after you insert the card into
the reader.
Connecting the camera and computer
You need to follow a specific set of steps when connecting the camera to your
computer. Otherwise, you can damage the camera or the memory card.
Also note that in order for your camera to communicate with the computer,
the computer must be running one of the following operating systems:

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 Windows Vista 32-bit Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, Enterprise,
or Ultimate edition
 Windows XP with Service Pack 2, Home or Professional edition
 Mac OS X 10.3.9 or 10.4 and higher
If you use another OS (operating system, for the non-geeks in the crowd),
check the support pages on the Nikon Web site (www.nikon.com) for the
latest news about any updates to system compatibility. You can always
simply transfer images with a card reader, too.
With that preamble out of the way, here are the steps to link your computer
and camera:
1. Assess the level of the camera battery.
Just look at the little battery-status indicator in the top-right corner of
the Shooting Info display. If the battery is low, charge it before continu-
ing. Running out of battery power during the transfer process can cause
problems, including lost picture data. Alternatively, if you purchased 
the optional AC adapter, use that to power the camera during picture
transfers.
2. Turn the computer on and give it time to finish its normal startup 
routine.
3. Turn the camera off.
4. Insert the smaller of the two
plugs on the USB cable into
the USB port on the side of
the camera.
The slot is hidden under a
little rubber door just around
the corner from the four but-
tons that flank the left side of
the monitor, as shown in
Figure 8-3. Gently pry open the
little door and insert the cable
end into the slot.
5. Plug the other end of the
cable into the computer’s 
USB port.
Be sure to plug the cable into a
port that is actually built into
the computer, as opposed to
one that’s on your keyboard 
or part of an external USB hub.
Those accessory-type connec-
tions can sometimes foul up the transfer process.
USB port
Figure 8-3: The USB slot is hidden under the little
rubber door on the left rear side of the camera.

6. Turn the camera on.
What happens now depends on whether you connected the camera to 
a Windows-based or Mac computer and what photo software you have
installed on that system. The next section explains the possibilities and
how to proceed with the image transfer process.
7. When the download is complete, turn off the camera and then discon-
nect it from the computer.
I repeat: Turn off the camera before severing its ties with the computer.
Otherwise, you can damage the camera.
Starting the transfer process
After you connect the camera to the computer (be sure to carefully follow the
steps in the preceding section) or insert a memory card into your card
reader, your next step depends, again, on the software installed on your 
computer and the computer operating system.
Here are the most common possibilities and how to move forward:
 On a Windows-based computer, a Windows message box similar to the
one in Figure 8-4 appears. Again, the figure shows the dialog box as it
appears on a computer
running Windows Vista.
Whatever its design,
the dialog box suggests
different programs that
you can use to down-
load your picture files.
Which programs
appear depend on what
you have installed on
your system; if you
installed Nikon Transfer,
for example, it should
appear in the program
list, as in the figure. In
Windows Vista, just
click the transfer pro-
gram that you want to
use. In other versions
of Windows, the dialog
box may sport an OK
button; if so, click that
button to proceed.
203
Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
Figure 8-4: Windows may display this initial boxful of
transfer options.

204
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
If you want to use the same program for all of your transfers, select the
Always Do This for This Device check box, as shown in the figure. The
next time you connect your camera or insert a memory card, Windows
will automatically launch your program of choice instead of displaying
the message box.
 An installed photo program automatically displays a photo-download
wizard. For example, the Nikon Transfer downloader or a downloader
associated with Adobe Photoshop Elements, Picasa, or some other
photo software may leap to the forefront. On a Mac, the built-in iPhoto
software may display its auto downloader. (Apple’s Web site, www.apple.
com, offers excellent video tutorials on using iPhoto, by the way.)
Usually, the downloader that appears is associated with the software
that you most recently installed. Each new program that you add to your
system tries to wrestle control over your image downloads away from
the previous program.
If you don’t want a program’s auto downloader to launch whenever you
insert a memory card or connect your camera, you should be able to
turn that feature off. Check the software manual to find out how to dis-
able the auto launch.
 Nothing happens. Don’t panic; assuming that your card reader or
camera is properly connected, all is probably well. Someone — maybe
even you — simply may have disabled all the automatic downloaders on
your system. Just launch your photo software and then transfer your
pictures using whatever command starts that process. (I show you how
to do it with Nikon Transfer later in the chapter; for other programs,
consult the software manual.)
As another option, you can use Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder to
simply drag and drop files from your memory card to your computer’s
hard drive. Whether you connect the card through a card reader or
attach the camera directly, the computer sees the card or camera as 
just another drive on the system. So the process of transferring files is
exactly the same as when you move any other file from a CD, DVD, or
other storage device onto your hard drive.
In the next sections, I provide details on using Nikon Transfer to download
your files and Nikon ViewNX to view and organize your pictures. Remember,
if you use some other software, the concepts are the same, but check your
program manual to get the small details. In most programs, you also can find
lots of information by simply clicking open the Help menu.

Downloading and Organizing Photos 
with the Nikon Software
Remember unpacking your camera box when you first brought home your
D60? Did you notice a CD-ROM called Nikon Software Suite? If you haven’t
already done so, dig out that CD and pop it into your computer’s CD drive.
Then install the following two programs:
 Nikon Transfer: This program assists you with the process of transfer-
ring pictures from your camera or memory card to the computer.
 Nikon ViewNX: After downloading your files, you can view and organize
your picture files using this program. You also can print and e-mail your
photos from ViewNX.
205
Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
Safeguarding your digital photo files
To make sure that your digital photos enjoy a
long, healthy life, follow these storage guidelines:
 Don’t rely on your computer’s hard drive for
long-term, archival storage. Hard drives
occasionally fail, wiping out all files in the
process. This warning applies to both inter-
nal and external hard drives.
 Camera memory cards, flash memory keys,
and other portable storage devices are sim-
ilarly risky. All are easily damaged if
dropped or otherwise mishandled. And
being of diminutive stature, these portable
storage options also are easily lost.
 The best way to store important files is to
copy them to nonrewritable CDs. (The label
should say CD-R, not CD-RW.) Look for qual-
ity, brand-name CDs that have a gold coat-
ing, which offer a higher level of security
than other coatings.
 Recordable DVDs offer the advantage of
holding lots more data than a CD. However,
as of today, no DVDs offer the longer-life,
archival gold coating that you can get with
some CDs. In addition, the DVDs you create
on one computer may not be playable on
another because multiple recording formats
and disc types exist: DVD minus, DVD plus,
dual-layer DVD, and so on. So I use DVDs
only for noncritical images; precious family
photos go on CDs.
 Online photo-sharing sites such as
Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and the like aren’t
designed to be long-term storage tanks for
your images. Consider them only a backup
to your backup, and read the site terms
carefully so that you understand how long
the site will hold onto your files if you stop
buying prints and other products. Also
investigate whether the terms of member-
ship give the site permission to use and dis-
tribute your photos without your say-so. In
other words, the fine print is important.

206
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
The CD also contains a copy of Apple QuickTime, which you can use to play
any stop-motion movies that you create using the process that I cover in
Chapter 9, and Microsoft DirectX, which is a Windows tool. Your system may
already have these latter two programs; if so, check to see whether the ver-
sion on the CD is more current than what you already have. (Ask your local
computer nerd to help if you’re not sure how to make the call.)
Note that this book features Nikon Transfer version 1.0.2 and Nikon ViewNX
version 1.0.4, which were the most current at the time of publication. If you
own an earlier version of these programs, visit the Nikon Web site to install
them. (To find out what versions you have installed open the program in
question. Then, in Windows, choose Help➪About. On a Mac, choose the
About command from the Nikon Transfer or Nikon ViewNX menu.)
The next five sections give you the most basic of introductions to using Nikon
Transfer and ViewNX. If you want more details, just look in the Help system
built into the programs. (Click the Help menu to access the system.)
Before you move on, though, I want to clear up one common point of confu-
sion: You can use the Nikon software to download and organize your photos
and still use any photo-editing software you prefer. And to do your editing,
you don’t need to re-download photos — after you transfer photos to your
computer, you can access them from any program, just as you can any file
that you put on your system. In fact, you can set things up so that you can
select a photo in ViewNX and then open that picture in your chosen photo
editor with a click or two. (I explain how to do this in aforementioned
“Linking ViewNX to a photo editor.”)
Downloading with Nikon Transfer
The following steps explain how to download new pictures to your computer
using Nikon Transfer:
1. Attach your camera or insert a memory card into your card reader, as
outlined in the first part of this chapter.
Depending on what software you have installed on your system, you
may see the initial Nikon Transfer window, as shown in Figure 8-5. Or, 
in Windows, you may see a dialog box similar to the one shown in 
Figure 8-4. In that case, click the item that has the Nikon Transfer logo,
as shown in Figure 8-4.
If nothing happens, start Nikon Transfer by using the same process you
use to launch any program on your computer. (If some other photo soft-
ware pops up, close it first.)
2. On the Source tab, click the icon for the camera or memory card drive
that holds your pictures.

Figure 8-5: Nikon Transfer makes transferring images to your computer a painless process.
If you’re transferring directly from the camera, you see a D60 icon, as in
Figure 8-5. If you’re transferring images from a memory-card reader, the
icon title should either bear the name of your card reader or have a
generic label such as Removable Disk plus a drive letter — E, F, or the
like — instead of carrying the D60 moniker.
3. Click the Thumbnails arrow to expand the dialog box, as shown in
Figure 8-6.
I labeled the arrow in Figure 8-6. After you click it, you can see thumbnail
previews of all the images on your memory card. (You may want to maxi-
mize or enlarge the program window so that you can see more previews
at a time.)
4. Select the images that you want to download.
A check mark in the little box under a thumbnail tells the program that
you want to download the image. Just click the box to toggle the check
mark on and off.
You also can select images quickly by using these tricks:
• Select all images. Click the little icon labeled Select All in Figure 8-6. 
• Select protected images. If you used the in-camera functions to pro-
tect pictures (see Chapter 4), you can select just those images by
clicking the Protected icon, also labeled in Figure 8-6. 
• Deselect all images. Click the Deselect icon, labeled in Figure 8-6.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 8-6: Select the check boxes of the images that you want to download.
5. Click the Primary Destination tab at the top of the window.
When you click the tab, the top of the transfer window offers options
that enable you to specify where and how you want the images to be
stored on your computer. Figure 8-7 offers a close-up look at these 
controls. 
6. Choose the folder where you want to store the images from the
Primary Destination Folder drop-down list.
If the folder you want to use isn’t in the list, choose Browse from the
bottom of the list and then track down the folder and select it.
By default, the program puts images in a folder titled Nikon Transfer,
which is housed inside a folder named My Pictures in Windows XP and
Pictures in Windows Vista and on a Mac. That My Pictures or Pictures
folder is itself housed inside a folder that your system creates automati-
cally for each registered user of the computer.

Figure 8-7: Specify the folder where you want to put the downloaded images.
You don’t have to stick with this default location — you can put your
pictures anywhere you please. But because most photo programs auto-
matically look for pictures in these standard folders, putting your pic-
tures there just simplifies things a little down the road. Note that you
can always move your pictures into other folders after you download
them if needed, too. The upcoming section “Organizing pictures”
explains how to do so in Nikon ViewNX.
7. Specify whether you want the pictures to be placed inside a new 
subfolder.
If you select the Create Subfolder for Each Transfer option, the program
creates a new folder inside the storage folder you selected in Step 6.
Then it puts all the pictures from the current download session into that
new subfolder. You can either use the numerical subfolder name the 
program suggests (001, in Figure 8-7) or click the Edit button to set up
your own naming system. If you created custom folders on the camera
memory card, an option you can explore in Chapter 11, select the Copy
Folder Names from Camera check box to use those folder names instead.

8. Tell the program whether you want to rename the picture files during
the download process.
If you do, select the Rename Photos During Transfer check box. Then
click the Edit button to display a dialog box where you can set up your
new filenaming scheme. Click OK after you do so to close the dialog box.
9. Click the Preferences tab to set the rest of the transfer options.
Now the tab shown in Figure 8-8 takes over the top of the program
window. Here you find a number of options that enable you to control
how the program operates. Most of the options are self-explanatory, 
but a couple warrant a few words of advice:
• Launch automatically when device is attached. Deselect this check
box if you don’t want Nikon Transfer to start every time you con-
nect your camera to your computer or insert a memory card into
your card reader.
• Transfer new photos only. This option, when selected, ensures that
you don’t waste time downloading images that you’ve already
transferred but are still on the memory card.
Figure 8-8: Control other aspects of the program’s behavior via the Preferences tab.

• Delete original files after transfer. Turn this option off, as shown in
Figure 8-8. Otherwise, your pictures are automatically erased from
your memory card when the transfer is complete. You should
always check to make sure the pictures really made it to the 
computer before you delete them from your memory card. (See
Chapter 4 to find out how to use the Delete function on your
camera.)
• Open destination folder with other application after transfer. By
default, Nikon Transfer shuts itself down when the file download 
is complete, and Nikon ViewNX then starts automatically so that
you can view and organize your images. If you want to use a pro-
gram other than ViewNX for that task, open the drop-down list,
click Browse, and select the program from the dialog box that
appears. Click OK after doing so.
Your choices remain in force for any subsequent download sessions, so
you don’t have to revisit this tab unless you want the program to behave
differently.
10. When you’re ready to start the download, click the Start Transfer
button.
It’s located in the lower-right corner of the program window. After you
click the button, the Process bar in the lower-left corner indicates how
the transfer is progressing. Again, what happens when the transfer is
complete depends on the choices you made in Step 9; by default, Nikon
Transfer closes, and ViewNX opens, automatically displaying the folder
that contains your just-downloaded images.
Browsing images in Nikon ViewNX
Nikon ViewNX is designed to do exactly what its name suggests: enable you
to view and organize the pictures that you shoot with your D60. Of course,
you can also view images that weren’t captured by your D60 — photos 
that you scanned, received from friends via e-mail, or took with a different
model of digital camera, for example. The only requirement is that the file
format is one that ViewNX can read; for still photos, that means JPEG, TIFF, 
or NEF, which is the Nikon flavor of Camera Raw. (Chapter 3 explains file for-
mats.) The program also can play the stop-motion movie files that you create
with your D60. For a complete rundown of supported file formats, check the
Appendix section of the built-in program Help system.
Figure 8-9 offers a look at the ViewNX window as it appears by default in
Windows Vista. The Mac version is nearly identical, although it features the
usual Mac “look and feel” instead of the Microsoft Windows design.
On either type of system, you can customize a variety of aspects of the
window layout by using the options on the View and Window menus.

212
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 8-9: You can browse and organize your photos using Nikon ViewNX.
To start viewing your pictures, first display the File Directory panel along the
left side of the program window, as shown in Figure 8-9. You can display the
panel by choosing Window➪File Directory or simply clicking the File Directory
tab, labeled in the figure. Now open the folder that holds the photos you want
to view. (If you came to ViewNX directly after downloading pictures via Nikon
Transfer, the folder that holds the new images should already be selected for
you.) Thumbnails of those images should then appear on the right side of the
program window, as in the figure.
By opening the View menu, you can choose from three different viewing
options, which work as follows:
 Thumbnail Grid: This is the default layout, shown in Figure 8-9. You can
adjust the size of the thumbnails by dragging the Zoom slider, labeled in
the figure.
 Image Viewer: This option displays your images as shown in Figure 8-10.
Small thumbnails appear along the top of the pane; the selected thumb-
nail appears in the larger preview area underneath. Use these maneuvers
to inspect your images:
File Directory tab
Zoom slider

• To select an image, just click its thumbnail.
• Magnify or reduce the size of the thumbnails and the preview by
using the Zoom sliders labeled in Figure 8-10.
• Drag in the large preview to scroll the display as needed to view
hidden parts of the photo.
• To scroll through your images, click the little arrows atop the large
preview, labeled Previous Image and Next Image in the figure.
• You can display a histogram for the current image by choosing
Window➪Histogram➪RGB. To hide the histogram, choose Off from
the same menu. This histogram is a little more complicated than
the one you can display on the camera monitor, which I explain in
Chapter 4, however, because it breaks down the image brightness
values into the core red, green, and blue components that comprise
a digital photo. If you want to learn about this type of histogram,
the ViewNX Help system offers a good background lesson.

 Full Screen: Want to see a photo at full-screen size, as shown in 
Figure 8-11? If you’re working in Thumbnail Grid view, just double-click
the picture thumbnail. In Image Viewer view, first click the thumbnail to
display it in the large preview. Then double-click the large preview. Or, 
in either view, click the thumbnail and then press the letter F.
In Full Screen view, as in the other views, you can magnify the image by
dragging the Zoom slider. To view additional photos at full-screen size,
click the Previous Image and Next Image arrows at the top of the window.
(See Figure 8-11.) To return to the main browser window, just click the
window’s close button or press Esc on your keyboard.
Figure 8-11: Use the arrows to scroll images in full-screen view.
In addition to seeing the images themselves, you also can inspect the picture
metadata, which refers to extra data that the camera stores in the picture file.
This metadata shows you all the settings that you used to capture the image,
along with the capture date and time. For details, see the next section.
Previous Image Next Image
Zoom slider

Viewing picture metadata
When you snap a picture with your D60, the camera includes in the picture
file some extra data that records all the critical camera settings that were in
force. This data, known by nerds as metadata, also includes the capture date
and time. And, if you take advantage of the Image Comment feature that I
cover in Chapter 11, you can even store a brief bit of custom text, such as 
the shooting location.
Reviewing this data is a great way to better understand what settings work
best for different types of pictures, especially when you’re just getting up to
speed with aperture, shutter speed, white balance, and all the other digital
photography basics. To get the full story on how each setting affects your
pictures, see Chapters 5 and 6.
To view the metadata in ViewNX, first select an image by clicking its thumb-
nail in the ViewNX browser window. Then click the Camera Settings tab on
the left side of the window or choose Window➪Camera Settings. The meta-
data information then replaces the File Directory information, as shown in
Figure 8-12.
Within the Camera Settings panel, the metadata is divided into several sections
of related capture settings: File Info 1, File Info 2, Camera Info, Exposure, Flash,
and so on. To hide or display a section, click the triangle next to its name — I
labeled one of the little guys in Figure 8-12. You may need to use the scroll bar
along the right side of the panel to view all the available information. (Note that
Nikon supplies ViewNX with cameras other than the D60, and some categories
of data apply only to those other models.)
In addition to the information on the Camera Settings panel, you can glean
one other bit of shooting information by clicking the Focus Point button on
the toolbar. When you do, a red bracket appears on the image thumbnails
and previews. That bracket serves the same purpose as the one that appears
in the camera viewfinder when you lock focus: It indicates which part of the
frame the camera used to establish focus. To turn off the focus indicator,
click the Focus Point button again. Check out Chapter 2 for an introduction 
to how the camera decides which bracket to use when you use autofocusing;
Chapter 6 offers more focus tips.
Organizing pictures
When you download pictures from your camera using Nikon Transfer, you
can specify where on your computer’s hard drive you want to store those
images. After you get the images on the system, you can further organize
them in ViewNX. You can create new folders and subfolders, move images
from one folder to another, rename and delete images, and more.

216
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 8-12: Inspecting metadata is a great way to see what settings work best for different subjects and
lighting conditions.
To begin organizing your images, first display the File Directory panel by click-
ing its tab on the left side of the program window. In this panel, you can see
and manage the contents of all the drives and folders on your computer. From
here, you can set up and rearrange your image storage closet as follows:
 Hide/display the contents of a drive or folder. See a little plus sign
(Windows) or right-pointing triangle (Mac) next to a drive or folder?
Click it to display the contents of that storage bin. A minus sign
(Windows) or a down-pointing triangle (Mac) means that the drive 
or folder is open; click that minus sign or triangle to close the drive or
folder.
Camera Settings tab
Hide/Display panel

 Create a new folder. First, click the drive or folder where you want to
house the new folder. For example, if you want to create it inside your
Pictures or My Pictures folder, click it. Icons representing all the folders
and files currently found within that folder then appear in the image
thumbnail area.
Next, choose File➪New Folder. An icon representing the new folder
should then appear, with the name box activated, as shown in 
Figure 8-13. Type the folder name and press Enter.
You can create as many new folders and subfolders as you like. I prefer
to organize my images according to subject matter — for example, in
Figure 8-13, I created a folder called Indianapolis and then created two
folders inside, one to hold pictures from our local zoo and one to hold
pictures of downtown landmarks. But you can set up any system that
makes sense to you.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 Move a photo from one folder to another. First, display that photo’s
thumbnail in the browser. Then just drag the thumbnail to the destina-
tion folder in the File Directory pane.
 Delete a photo. In Windows, click the image thumbnail and then choose
Edit➪Delete or press the Delete key. On a Mac, choose Edit➪Move to
Trash or press Ô+Delete. You then see a message asking you to confirm
that you really want to trash the photo. Click Yes if you want to move
forward.
 Protect or unlock photos. If you used the Protect feature on your
camera’s Playback menu to “lock” a photo, a process you can explore 
in Chapter 4, you need to remove the protection if you want to edit the
image in your photo software. To do so, choose File➪Protect
Files➪Unprotect.
You also can protect images in ViewNX; just choose Protect from the
File➪Protect Files submenu. A little key icon then appears on the image
thumbnail to remind you that the image is now protected from editing or
erasing. If you later want to delete the file, you must first unprotect it.
 Select multiple files for moving, deleting, or other actions. Click the
thumbnail of the first image and then Ctrl+click (Windows) or Ô+click
(Mac) the rest. To select all images in the current folder, press Ctrl+A
(Windows) or Ô+A (Mac.)
As your image collection grows, also investigate the ViewNX keywords, tags,
and rating functions. You access these options via the XMP/IPTC tab on the
left side of the program window. These functions, along with the program’s
search feature, provide you with various tools that make locating specific 
pictures easier, including the option to search for pictures based on the
shooting date.
In case you’re curious about the name of that third tab, IPTC refers to text
data that press photographers are often required to tag onto their picture
files, such as captions and copyright information. XMP refers to a data format
developed by Adobe to enable that kind of data to be added to the file. IPTC
stands for International Press Telecommunication Council; XMP stands for
Extensible Metadata Platform.
Linking ViewNX to a photo editor
Nikon ViewNX offers no photo editing or retouching tools. So if you want to
crop your photos, correct exposure or color, or make any other changes, you
need a different program. The next section offers some advice on picking the
right program for the type of photo editing you want to do.
After you choose a photo editing program, you can open your pictures in that
program through ViewNX. Here’s how: Select a thumbnail in ViewNX and then
choose File➪Open With Another Application. A submenu pops up, listing any

programs on your system that have already been set up as the default pro-
grams for handling the type of file you selected. (Some programs establish
this setting upon installation.) If your photo editor appears on the submenu,
just select that program. Your photo editor starts up, and your file is opened
in that program, ready for editing.
If your photo editor doesn’t appear on the submenu, follow these steps to
put it there:
1. Choose File➪Open with Another Application➪Register.
You see the Options dialog box, where you can establish all sorts of pro-
gram preferences. The Open with Application part of the dialog box is
displayed automatically, as shown in Figure 8-14.

in this box.

Exploring Other Software Options
If all you want to do with your digital photos is organize, print, and share
them online, Nikon ViewNX may suit your needs just fine. But if you want to
retouch your photos or use them in creative projects such as digital scrap-
book pages or greeting cards, you need to invest in another program.
Here are just some of the products to consider:
 Beginning/consumer programs: Unless you’re retouching photos for
professional purposes or want to get into photo editing at a serious level
for other reasons, a program such as Adobe Photoshop Elements ($100,
www.adobe.com) is a good fit. Elements has been the best-selling con-
sumer photo editor for some time, and for good reason. With a full com-
plement of retouching tools, onscreen guidance for novices, and an
assortment of tools and templates for creating artistic photo projects,
Elements offers all the features that most consumers need, including a
built-in photo organizing tool.
Figure 8-16 offers a look at Elements 6 for Windows; the Mac version
looks similar, although it follows the usual Mac design conventions for
window controls and the like.
Figure 8-16: Adobe Photoshop Elements offers a good balance of power and ease of use.

For other candidates in this category and price range, visit the Web sites
of Corel (www.corel.com) and ArcSoft (www.arcsoft.com). Both compa-
nies offer multiple programs aimed at the beginner-to-intermediate user.
 Advanced/professional tools: The best-known option in this category is
Adobe Photoshop (www.adobe.com). Photoshop offers professional-
grade photo editing tools and, unfortunately, carries a professional-grade
price of $650. If that seems like too big a hit on your budget, Nikon’s own
Capture NX software, pictured in Figure 8-17 and priced at $150, may be a
good alternative. You can check it out further at www.nikon.com.
Both programs offer powerful photo retouching tools plus built-in photo
organizers; Photoshop also provides tools needed by people preparing
images for commercial printing, Web design, and other high-end uses.
Expect to spend lots of time getting up to speed with either program,
however, as you don’t get the friendly interfaces and guidance offered by
the beginner-level programs. Nor do these advanced programs offer the
automated photo-creation features, such as greeting card templates and
clip art, that you find in consumer programs.
Other programs aimed at the professional market include Apple
Aperture ($300, www.apple.com) and Adobe Lightroom (also $300,
www.adobe.com). These two programs are geared toward users who
routinely need to process lots of images but who typically do only light
retouching work. Figure 8-18 offers a look at Aperture.
Figure 8-17: Nikon Capture NX offers powerful tools but can be intimidating to novices. 

Figure 8-18: Apple Aperture is geared to users who need to quickly process lots of images.
A few important tips before you buy:
 Check the software’s system requirements to make sure that your com-
puter can run the program. Some of the products I mention here aren’t
available for Macintosh computers; Apple Aperture, on the other hand,
isn’t available for Windows-based systems. Also make sure that your
computer offers the system memory (RAM), processor speed, and 
other components that the software requires.
 If you shoot in the Raw format (NEF, on your Nikon), be sure that the
software you choose includes a good Raw converter tool. You need this
tool to process your Raw images and then save them in a standard
image format (JPEG or TIFF). See the next section for details on this
process.
 You also can buy stand-alone photo organizing programs if you aren’t
interested in serious photo editing but want a more powerful image-
management tool than ViewNX. Check out the offerings in this category
from ACDSee (www.acdsee.com), ThumbsPlus (www.thumbsplus.com),
and Extensis (www.extensis.com).

You may be amused, as I am, to know that the photo industry uses the
term DAM software — for digital asset management — to refer to the
function provided by image-organizing programs. (I dare you to walk
into your local computer store and ask where you can find the DAM 
software. Wait; I double-dare you.)
 Many software companies enable you to download free trials from their
Web sites so that you can actually use the software for a short period to
make sure that it fits your needs. 
Processing Raw (NEF) Files
Chapter 3 introduces you to the Camera Raw file format, which enables you
to capture images as raw data. The advantage of capturing Raw files, which
are called NEF files on Nikon cameras, is that you make the decisions about
how to translate the raw data into an actual photograph. You can specify
attributes such as color intensity, image sharpening, contrast, and so on —
all of which are handled automatically by the camera if you use its other file
format, JPEG.
The bad news: You have to specify attributes such as color intensity, image
sharpening, contrast, and so on before you can do much with your pictures.
You can’t share them online, print them from most programs other than
Nikon ViewNX, or edit them in your photo software until you process them
using a tool known as a Raw converter. At the end of the conversion process,
you save the finished file in a standard file format, such as JPEG or TIFF.
With the D60, you have a couple of Raw processing options:
 Use the in-camera processing feature. Through the Retouch menu, you
can process your Raw images right in the camera. You can specify only
limited image attributes (color, sharpness, and so on), and you can save
the processed files only in the JPEG format, but still, having this option
is a nice feature. See the next section for details.
 Process and convert in ViewNX. ViewNX also offers a Raw processing
feature. Again, the controls for setting picture characteristics are a little
limited, but you can save the adjusted files in either the JPEG or TIFF
format. The last section of this chapter walks you through this option.
 Use Nikon Capture NX or a third-party Raw conversion tool. For the
most control over your Raw images, you need to open up your wallet

and invest in a program that offers a truly capable converter. Several of
the programs described in the preceding section, including Capture NX,
offer good Raw converters.
As mentioned earlier, though, Capture NX is a little pricey and can be
overwhelming in terms of learning curve for beginners. Figure 8-19
shows an alternative that’s less expensive and, in my experience, easier
for novices to understand: the converter found in Adobe Photoshop
Elements 6. The Adobe Camera Raw converter, known in the industry 
as ACR, is widely considered one of the best available, and buying
Elements is a low-priced way to access that tool. (Note that the con-
verter in Elements doesn’t offer all the bells and whistles of the version
of ACR provided with Photoshop, however.)
Figure 8-19: Adobe Photoshop Elements offers a very good Raw converter.

226
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
If you do opt for a third-party conversion tool, check the program’s Help
system for details on how to use the various controls, which vary from pro-
gram to program. The following general tips apply no matter what converter
you use, however:
 Whenever possible, save your processed files in a nondestructive format,
such as TIFF, or in Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, save them
in the PSD format. For top quality, don’t save originals in the JPEG format,
which applies lossy compression. You can read about the potential damage
to image quality that lossy compression creates in Chapter 3. If you need a
JPEG image to share online, Chapter 9 shows you how to create a dupli-
cate of your original, converted image in that format.
 Some Raw converters give you the option of creating a 16-bit image file.
(A bit is a unit of computer data; the more bits you have, the more colors
your image can contain.) Many photo editing programs either can’t open
16-bit files or limit you to a few editing tools, so I suggest you stick with
the standard, 8-bit image option. Your image will contain more than
enough colors, and you’ll avoid potential conflicts caused by so-called
high-bit images.
 Resist the temptation to crank up color saturation too much. Doing so
can actually destroy image detail. Likewise, be careful about overdoing
sharpening, or you can create noticeable image defects. Chapter 10
offers some additional information about sharpening and saturation to
help you find the right amounts of each.
Using your mouse as a shutter button
Along with ViewNX and Capture NX, Nikon
offers a piece of specialty software known as
Nikon Camera Control Pro, which sells for about
$70. Whereas ViewNX and Capture NX are
designed for working with pictures after you
shoot them, Camera Control Pro enables you to
use your computer to operate your camera.
While your camera is connected to your com-
puter, the software displays a window that con-
tains clickable controls for adjusting all the
standard camera settings, from aperture to
white balance. When you get those options
established, you click another button to record
whatever scene is in front of your camera lens.
What’s the point? Well, Camera Control Pro is
great in scenarios that make having a live pho-
tographer close to the subject either difficult or
dangerous — for example, trying to get a shot
of a chemical reaction in a science lab or to
capture an image of an animal that’s shy around
humans. Additionally, the software enables
easy time-lapse photography, enabling you to
set the camera to take pictures automatically at
specified intervals over a period of minutes,
hours, or even days.

Processing Raw images in the camera
Scroll past the initial screen of options on the Retouch menu, and you come
to a menu item called NEF (Raw) Processing, as shown in Figure 8-20. With
this feature, you can process Raw files right in the camera — no computer 
or other software required.
I do want to share two reservations about this option:
 First, you can save your proces-
sed files only in the JPEG format.
As discussed in Chapter 3, that
format results in some quality
loss because of the file compres-
sion that JPEG applies. You can
choose the level of JPEG compres-
sion you want to apply during Raw
processing; you can create a JPEG
Fine, Normal, or Basic file. Each of
those settings produces the same
quality as you get when you shoot
new photos in the JPEG format
and select Fine, Normal, or Basic
from the Image Quality menu.
Chapter 3 details the JPEG options, but, long story short, choose Fine
for the best JPEG quality. And if you want to produce the absolute best
quality from your Raw images, use a software solution and save your
processed file in the TIFF format instead.
 You can make adjustments to exposure, color, and image sharpness as
part of the in-camera Raw conversion process. Evaluating the effects of
your adjustments on the camera monitor can be difficult because of the
size of the display, so for really tricky images, you may want to forgo in-
camera conversion and do the job on your computer, where you can get
a better view of things. If you do go the in-camera route, make sure that
the monitor brightness is set to its default position so that you aren’t
misled by the display. (Chapter 1 shows you how to adjust monitor
brightness via the Setup menu.)
That said, in-camera Raw processing offers a quick and convenient solution
when you need JPEG copies of your NEF images for immediate online sharing.
(JPEG is the standard format for online use.) Follow these steps to get the 
job done:
1. Display the Retouch menu and highlight NEF (RAW) Processing, as
shown in Figure 8-20.
Again, you need to scroll past the first screen of menu items to get to
this option.

2. Press the OK button.
Now you see a screen similar to
the one in Figure 8-21, with
thumbnails of Raw images that
are stored on your memory card.
JPEG images are hidden from
view.
3. Navigate to the image that you
want to process.
Just use the Multi Selector to
move the yellow highlight box
over the image.
4. Press OK.
Up pops the screen shown in Figure 8-22, only with a thumbnail showing
your image instead of mine. This screen is command central for specify-
ing what settings you want the camera to use when creating the JPEG
version of your Raw image.
Figure 8-22: After setting the conversion options, highlight EXE and press OK.
5. Set the conversion options.
Along the right side of the screen, you see a vertical column offering five
conversion options, which I labeled in Figure 8-22. To establish the set-
ting for an option, use the Multi Selector to highlight it and then press
OK. You then see the available settings for the option. For example, if you
highlight the first option, Image Quality, and press OK, you see the screen
shown in Figure 8-23. Use the Multi Selector to highlight the setting you
want to use and press OK to return to the main Raw conversion screen.

Rather than detailing all the
options here, the following list
points you to the chapter where
you can explore the settings
available for each:
• Image Quality: See the
Chapter 3 section related to
the JPEG quality settings for
details on this option.
• Image Size: The first part of
Chapter 3 explains this one.
• White Balance: Check out
Chapter 6 for details about
White Balance options.
• Exposure Compensation: With this option, you can adjust image
brightness by applying exposure compensation, a feature that I
cover in Chapter 5.
• Optimize Image: This option enables you to adjust color, contrast,
and image sharpness. For an in-depth discussion of the available
settings, see the last part of Chapter 6.
6. When you finish setting all the
conversion options, highlight
EXE and press OK.
The camera records a JPEG copy
of your Raw file and displays the
copy in the monitor, as shown in
Figure 8-24. To remind you that
the image was created with the
help of the Retouch menu, the
top-left corner of the display
sports the little Retouch icon,
and the filename of the image
begins with CSC rather than the
usual DSC. (See Chapter 4 for
details about filenaming conven-
tions used by the D60.)
Processing Raw files in ViewNX
In ViewNX, you can convert your Raw files to either the JPEG format or, for
top picture quality, to the TIFF format. (See Chapter 3 if you’re unsure about
the whole concept of file format and how it relates to picture quality.)

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Although the ViewNX converter isn’t as full-featured as the ones in Nikon
Capture NX, Adobe Photoshop Elements, and some other photo-editing 
programs, it does enable you to make the same sort of adjustments to your
Raw images as you can apply using the in-camera processing option.
The ViewNX Converter gives you three basic adjustment controls:
 Exposure Compensation, which enables you to adjust image brightness.
 White Balance, which you can use to remove any unwanted color cast.
 Picture Control, which enables you to apply some prefab settings that
each affect the color, sharpness, and contrast of the image in specific
ways. For even more control, you can dig into the Picture Control Utility,
which you can use to create your own groups of settings so that you can
quickly apply the same adjustments to a batch of images.
For now, I suggest that you skip the Picture Control options and instead con-
centrate on the first two options. Because the exact changes made by the
Picture Control settings aren’t really obvious, it’s hard to predict how they will
affect your image. Creating your own Picture Control setting via the Picture
Control Utility requires some knowledge of photo editing tools, such as a
Curves filter, and you can just as easily mess things up as improve them. If 
you do want to experiment, the Help system offers some assistance to get you
started. Note, though, that one feature described in the Help system — the
option to copy your custom settings to your camera memory card and apply
them in-camera — doesn’t apply to the D60. (Again, ViewNX is designed for
use with other cameras, so some of its features aren’t relevant to D60 users.)
With that recommendation in mind, the following steps show you how to
process your Raw images, sans the aforementioned Picture Control options:
1. Click the thumbnail of the NEF (Raw) image to select it.
You may want to set the program to Image Viewer mode, as shown in
Figure 8-25, so that you can see a larger preview of your image. Just
choose View➪Image Viewer to switch to this display mode.
2. Display the Camera Settings panel by clicking its tab on the left side of
the program window.
I labeled the tab in Figure 8-25.
3. Display the Quick Adjustment area of the panel, as shown in 
Figure 8-25.
Look at the very bottom of the Camera Settings panel. Click the little
Quick Adjustment triangle to open up that part of the panel, as shown 
in the figure. 

Figure 8-25: Display the Quick Adjustment panel to tweak Raw images before conversion.
4. Adjust image brightness by dragging the Exposure Compensation
slider.
Drag to the right to make the picture brighter; drag to the left to make it
darker. This control is designed to mimic the effects of the Exposure
Compensation option on your camera. You can explore that feature in
Chapter 5.
5. To adjust color, choose a setting from the White Balance drop-down list.
In addition to six preset values geared to specific light sources, you have
three other options:
• Recorded Value: This one reapplies the White Balance value that
the camera initially used when you took the picture. In other words,
choose this option to return to the original colors if you choose
some other setting in ViewNX and then don’t like the results.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
• Calculate Automatically: If you select this option, the program ana-
lyzes the image and adjusts colors as it deems fit, with the intent of
removing any perceived color cast.
• Use Gray Point: This option enables you to click an area in your
image that you think should be neutral gray. After you do, the pro-
gram makes whatever color adjustment is needed to make that
area neutral gray, which also should remove any color cast from
the rest of the photo as well.
To use this option, click the Start button that appears under the
drop-down list when you select Use Gray Point. Then click in the
image preview on the object that should be neutral gray. If you
don’t like the results, just click on another spot in the preview.
When you’re happy with the image colors, click the Finish button
that appears under the drop-down list. (It replaces the Start button
as soon as you click in the preview.)
For more information about white balance and how light sources affect
your picture colors, see Chapter 6.
6. Click the Apply button at the bottom of the Quick Adjustment area.
7. To save the processed file, choose File➪Convert Files.
Or just click the Convert Files button on the toolbar at the top of the
program window. You see the Convert Files dialog box, shown in 
Figure 8-26.
8. Select TIFF (8 Bit) from the File Format drop-down list.
You also can opt for TIFF (16 Bit) and JPEG, but I don’t recommend it.
TIFF (16 Bit) can cause problems when you try to open the file in certain
photo editing and organizing programs. And saving in the JPEG format
applies lossy compression, thereby sacrificing some image quality. If you
need a JPEG copy of your processed Raw image for online sharing, 
you can easily create one from your TIFF version by following the steps
laid out in Chapter 9.
9. Deselect the Use LZW Compression option, as shown in the figure.
Although LZW Compression reduces the file size somewhat and does not
cause any quality loss, some programs can’t open files that were saved
with this option enabled. So turn it off.
10. Deselect the Change the Image Size check box.
This step ensures that you retain all the original pixels in your image,
which gives you the most flexibility in terms of generating quality 
prints at large sizes. For details on this issue, check out Chapter 3.
One note here for Mac users: Your dialog box contains a Compression
Ratio slider beneath the Change Image Size options. But this slider
becomes active only when you select JPEG as your file format; for TIFF
images, it has no use. See the bullet point related to converting directly
to JPEG, following these steps, for details.

Figure 8-26: To retain the best image quality, save processed Raw files in the TIFF 
format.
11. Deselect the three Remove check boxes.
If you select the check boxes, you strip image metadata — the extra text
data that’s stored by the camera — from the file. Unless you have some
specific reason to do so, clear all three check boxes so that you can con-
tinue to access the metadata when you view your processed image in
programs that know how to display metadata.
The first two check boxes relate to data that you can view on the
Camera Settings tab and XMP/IPTC tab in ViewNX; earlier sections of
this chapter give you the lowdown. The ICC profile item refers to the
image color space, which is either sRGB or Adobe RGB on your D60.
Chapter 6 explains the difference.
Current drive and folder
233
Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
12. Select a storage location for the processed TIFF file.
In Windows, the current drive and folder location appear in the area
labeled in Figure 8-26. On a Mac, the location is displayed inside a white
box in the same general area of the dialog box. On either type of system,
you can change the storage destination by clicking the Browse button
and then selecting the drive and folder where you want to put the file.
By selecting the Create a New Subfolder for Each File Conversion check
box, you can put your TIFF file into a separate folder within the destina-
tion folder. If you select the box, click the Naming Options button and
then specify how you want to name the subfolder.
13. Specify whether you want to give the processed TIFF a different file-
name from the original Raw image.
To do so, select the Change File Names check box and then click the
Naming Options button and enter the name you want to use.
If you don’t change the file name, ViewNX gives the file the same name
as the original Raw file. But you don’t overwrite that Raw file because
you are storing the copy in a different file format (TIFF). In Windows, the
filename of the processed TIFF image has the three-letter extension .TIF.
14. Click the Convert button.
A window appears to show you the progress of the conversion process.
When the window disappears, your TIFF image appears in the storage
location you selected in Step 10.
A few final notes on the issue of processing Raw files in ViewNX:
 Saving time with batch processing: Batch processing is the nerdy way 
of saying “converting a bunch of Raw images together,” which can be a
time and energy saver. To go this route, first apply any exposure and
color adjustments you want to make to each image. (You don’t have to
use the same settings for every picture.) Then select the thumbnails of
all the Raw images you want to convert: In Windows, click the first
thumbnail and then Ctrl+click the others; on a Mac, click the first thumb-
nail and then Ô+click the others. Finally, choose File➪Convert Files and
set up the conversion options as outlined in Steps 7 through 13.
 Converting from NEF (Raw) directly to JPEG: Although saving your
converted files in the TIFF format retains the images at their highest
quality, you can’t share TIFF files online because Web browsers and
e-mail programs can’t display them. Again, you can always use the steps
provided in Chapter 9 to convert your TIFF files to JPEGs. But if you
want to skip that step and go directly from Raw to JPEG, just select JPEG
as the file format in Step 7.
When you do, the Convert Files dialog box changes slightly, offering a
Compression Ratio slider, as shown in Figure 8-27. (Again, on a Mac, the
slider is always present but becomes active only when you select JPEG

as your file format.) Drag the slider all the way to the right to apply the
least amount of JPEG compression and therefore retain the best possible
image quality.
Of course, as you reduce the compression amount, the file size increases.
If you’re concerned about file size, you may want to compromise on qual-
ity a bit. Unfortunately, the Convert Files box doesn’t indicate the esti-
mated file size of your soon-to-be JPEG file; the only way to find out the file
size is to go through with the conversion and then look at the size of the
resulting JPEG file. Remember, too, that for onscreen viewing, you don’t
need lots of pixels, so you may also want to reduce the image size, using
the Change the Image Size option, when you save directly to JPEG. Refer
to Chapters 3 and 9 for more about JPEG and onscreen image viewing.
Figure 8-27: If you instead use JPEG as the format, you can set the level of file compression.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 Creating a black-and-white version of your Raw photo: Here’s one
exception to my earlier recommendation to bypass the Picture Control
option until you’re an advanced user: By selecting the Monochrome set-
ting from the Picture Control drop-down list (in the Quick Adjustments
area of the Camera Settings panel), you can easily turn your full-color
image into a black-and-white photo. You can then use the other Quick
Adjustments options to tweak the look of your black-and-white image.
Or click the Launch Utility button, found under the Picture Control drop-
down list. Clicking the button opens the Picture Control Utility dialog
box, shown in Figure 8-28, where you find more controls for adjusting
how colors are translated to black and white.
You can create a tinted monochrome image by selecting an option other
than B&W from the Toning drop-down list on the right side of the Picture
Control Utility dialog box. Again, check out the program’s Help system
for details. And be sure to also check out Chapter 11, which shows you
how to produce monochrome images using your camera’s Retouch menu.

conversion adjustments.

W
hen my first digital photography book was published, way back in the
1990s, consumer digital cameras didn’t offer the resolution needed to
produce good prints at anything more than postage-stamp size — and
even then, the operative word was “good,” not “great.” And if you
did want a print, it was a pretty much a do-it-yourself propo-
sition unless you paid sky-high prices at a professional
imaging lab. In those days, retail photo labs didn’t offer
digital printing, and online printing services hadn’t
arrived yet, either.
Well, time and technology march on, and, at least in
the case of digital photo printing, to a very good
outcome. Your D60 can produce dynamic prints
even at large sizes, and getting those prints made is
easy and economical, thanks to an abundance of digi-
tal printing services now in stores and online. And for
home printing, today’s printers are better and cheaper
than ever, too.
That said, getting the best output from your camera still requires
a little bit of knowledge and prep work on your part. To that end, this 
chapter tells you exactly how to ensure that your picture files will look as
good on paper as they do in your camera monitor.
In addition, this chapter explores ways to share your pictures electronically.
First, I show you how to prepare your picture for e-mail — an important step

if you don’t want to annoy friends and family by cluttering their inboxes with
ginormous, too-large-to-view photos. Following that, you can find out how to
create digital slide shows and stop-motion movies, view your pictures on a
television, and join online photo-sharing communities.
Preventing Potential Printing Problems
Boy, I love a good alliteration, don’t you? Oh, just me, then. Anyway, as I say
in the introduction to this chapter, a few issues can cause hiccups in the
printing process. So before you print your photos, whether you want to do it
on your own printer or send them to a lab, read through the next three sec-
tions, which show you how to avoid the most common trouble spots.
Match resolution to print size
Resolution, or the number of pixels in your digital image, plays a huge role in
how large you can print your photos and still maintain good picture quality.
You can get the complete story on resolution in Chapter 3, but here’s a quick
recap as it relates to printing:
 On your D60, you set picture resolution via the Image Size option, which
you can access either via the Shooting menu or the Quick Settings dis-
play. You must select this option before you capture an image, which
means that you need some idea of your ultimate print size before you
shoot. And remember that if you crop your image, you eliminate some
pixels, so take that factor into account when you do the resolution math. 
 For good print quality, the minimum pixel count (in my experience,
anyway) is 200 pixels per linear inch, or 200 ppi. That means that if 
you want a 4-x-6-inch print, you need at least 800 x 1200 pixels.
 Depending on your printer, you may get even better results at 200+ ppi.
Some printers do their best work when fed 300 ppi, and a few (notably,
some from Epson) request 360 ppi as the optimum resolution. However,
going higher than that typically doesn’t produce any better prints.
Unfortunately, because most printer manuals don’t bother to tell you what
image resolution produces the best results, finding the right resolution 
is a matter of experimentation. (Don’t confuse the manual’s statements
related to the printer’s dpi with ppi. DPI refers to how many dots of color
the printer can lay down per inch; many printers use multiple dots to
reproduce one image pixel.)
 If you’re printing your photos at a retail kiosk or at an online site, the
printing software that you use to order your prints should determine 
the resolution of your file and then guide you as to the suggested print
size. But if you’re printing on a home printer, you need to be the resolu-
tion cop. (Some programs, however, do alert you in the Print dialog box
if the resolution is dangerously low.)

So what do you do if you find that you don’t have enough pixels for the print
size you have in mind? You just have to decide what’s more important, print
size or print quality.
If your print size does exceed your pixel supply, one of two things must happen:
 The pixel count remains constant, and pixels simply grow in size to fill
the requested print size. And if pixels get too large, you get a defect
known as pixelation. The picture starts to appear jagged, or stairstepped,
along curved or digital lines. Or at worst, your eye can actually make out
the individual pixels, and your photo begins to look more like a mosaic
than, well, a photograph.
 The pixel size remains constant, and the printer software adds pixels to
fill in the gaps. You can also add pixels, or resample the image, in your
photo software. Wherever it’s done, resampling doesn’t solve the low
resolution problem. You’re asking the software to make up photo infor-
mation out of thin air, and the result is usually an image that looks worse
than it did before resampling. You don’t get pixelation, but details turn
muddy, giving the image a blurry, poorly rendered appearance.
Just to hammer home the point and remind you one more time of the impact
of resolution picture quality, Figures 9-1 through 9-3 show you the same
image as it appears at 300 ppi (the resolution required by the publisher of
this book), at 50 ppi, and resampled from 50 ppi to 300 ppi. As you can see,
there’s just no way around the rule: If you want the best quality prints, you
need the right pixel count.

Allow for different print proportions
Unlike many digital cameras, your D60 produces images that have an aspect
ratio of 3:2. That is, images are 3 units wide by 2 units tall — just like a 35mm
film negative — which means that they translate perfectly to the standard 
4-x-6-inch print size. (Most digital cameras produce 4:3 images, which means
the pictures must be cropped to fit a 4-x-6-inch piece of paper.)
If you want to print your digital original at other standard sizes — 5 x 7, 8 x 10,
11 x 14, and so on — you need to crop the photo to match those proportions.
Alternatively, you can reduce the photo size slightly and leave an empty
margin along the edges of the print as needed.
As a point of reference, Figure 9-4 shows you a 3:2 original image. The red
outlines indicate how much of the original can fit within a 5-x-7-inch frame
and an 8-x-10-inch frame.
See Chapter 10 for information on two cropping methods: using your photo
software and doing the job in-camera, using the Trim function on the Retouch
menu.

frame sizes.

You also can usually crop your photo using the software provided at online
printing sites and at retail print kiosks. But if you plan to simply drop off your
memory card for printing at a lab, be sure to find out whether the printer
automatically crops the image without your input. If so, use your photo soft-
ware to crop the photo, save the cropped image to your memory card, and
deliver that version of the file to the printer. 
To allow yourself printing flexibility, leave at least a little margin of back-
ground around your subject when you shoot, as I did for the example in
Figure 9-4. Then you don’t clip off the edges of the subject no matter what
print size you choose. (Some people refer to this margin padding as head
room, especially when describing portrait composition.)
Get print and monitor colors in synch
Your photo colors look perfect on your computer monitor. But when you
print the picture, the image is too red, or too green, or has some other nasty
color tint. This problem, which is probably the most prevalent printing issue,
can occur because of any or all of the following factors:
 Your monitor needs to be calibrated. When print colors don’t match
what you see on your computer monitor, the most likely culprit is actu-
ally the monitor, not the printer. If the monitor isn’t accurately calibrated,
the colors it displays aren’t a true reflection of your image colors.
To ensure that your monitor is displaying photos on a neutral canvas, you
can start with a software-based calibration utility, which is just a small
program that guides you through the process of adjusting your monitor.
The program displays various color swatches and other graphics and
then asks you to provide feedback about what you see on the screen.
If you use a Mac, the operating system offers a built-in calibration utility,
called the Display Calibrator Assistant; Figure 9-5 shows the welcome
screen that appears when you run the program. (Access it by opening
the System Preferences dialog box, clicking the Displays icon, clicking
the Color button, and then clicking the Calibrate button.) You also can
find free calibration software for both Mac and Windows systems online;
just enter the term free monitor calibration software into your favorite
search engine.
Software-based calibration isn’t ideal, however, because our eyes aren’t
that reliable in judging color accuracy. For a more accurate calibration,
you may want to invest in a hardware solution, such as the Pantone
Huey ($90, www.pantone.com) or the ColorVision Spyder2express ($80,
www.datacolor.com). These products use a device known as a colorime-
ter, which you attach to or hang on your monitor, to accurately measure
your display colors.

Figure 9-5: Mac users can take advantage of the operating system’s built-in calibration tool.
Whichever route you go, the calibration process produces a monitor
profile, which is simply a data file that tells your computer how to adjust
the display to compensate for any monitor color casts. Your Windows or
Mac operating system loads this file automatically when you start your
computer. Your only responsibility is to perform the calibration every
month or so, because monitor colors drift over time.
 One of your printer cartridges is empty or clogged. If your prints look
great one day but are way off the next, the number-one suspect is an
empty ink cartridge or a clogged print nozzle or head. Check your
manual to find out how to perform the necessary maintenance to keep
the nozzles or print heads in good shape.
If black-and-white prints have a color tint, a logical assumption is that
your black ink cartridge is to blame, if your printer has one. But the
problem is usually a color cartridge instead. Most printers use both
color and black inks even for black-and-white prints, and if one color
is missing, a tint results.
When you buy replacement ink, by the way, keep in mind that third-
party brands, while they may save you money, may not deliver the 
performance you get from the cartridges made by your printer manufac-
turer. A lot of science goes into getting ink formulas to mesh with the
printer’s ink-delivery system, and the printer manufacturer obviously
knows most about that delivery system.

 You chose the wrong paper setting in your printer software. When you
set up your print job, be sure to select the right setting from the paper-
type option — glossy, matte, and so on. This setting affects how the
printer lays down ink on the paper.
 Your photo paper is low quality. Sad but true: The cheap, store-brand
photo papers usually don’t render colors as well as the higher-priced,
name-brand papers. For best results, try papers from your printer manu-
facturer; again, those papers are engineered to provide top performance
with the printer’s specific inks and ink-delivery system.
 Your printer and photo software are fighting over color management
duties. Some photo programs offer color management tools, which are
features that enable the user to control how colors are handled as an
image passes from camera to monitor to printer. Most printer software
also offers color-management features. The problem is, if you enable
color-management controls both in your photo software and your printer
software, you can create conflicts that lead to wacky colors. So check your
photo software and printer manuals to find out what color-management
options are available to you and how to turn them on and off.
Even if all the aforementioned issues are resolved, however, don’t expect per-
fect color matching between printer and monitor. Printers simply can’t re-
produce the entire spectrum of colors that a monitor can display. In addition,
monitor colors always appear brighter because they are, after all, generated
with light.
Finally, be sure to evaluate your print colors and monitor colors in the same
ambient light — daylight, office light, whatever — because that light source
has its own influence on the colors you see.
Printing Online or In-Store
Normally, I’m a do-it-yourself type of gal. I mow my own lawn, check my own
tire pressure, hang my own screen doors. I am woman; hear me roar. Unless,
that is, I discover that I can have someone else do the job in less time and for
less money than I can — which just happens to be the case for digital photo
printing. Although I occasionally make my own prints for fine-art images that
I plan to sell or exhibit, I have everyday snapshots made at my local retail
photo lab.
Unless you’re already very comfortable with computers and photo printing, I
suggest that you do the same. Compare the cost of retail digital printing with
the cost of using a home or office photo printer — remember to factor in the
required ink, paper, and your precious time — and you’ll no doubt come out
ahead if you delegate the job.
You can choose from a variety of retail printing options, as follows:

 Drop-off printing services: Just as you used to leave a roll of film at the
photo lab in your corner drug store or camera store, you can drop off
your memory card, order prints, and then pick up your prints in as little
as an hour.
 Self-serve print kiosks: Many photo labs, big-box stores, and other retail
outlets also offer self-serve print kiosks. You insert your memory card
into the appropriate slot, follow the onscreen directions, and wait for
your prints to slide out of the print chute.
 Online with mail-order delivery: You can upload your photo files to
online printing sites and have prints mailed directly to your house.
Photo-sharing sites such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Snapfish are
well-known players in this market. But many national retail chains, such
as Ritz Cameras, Wal-Mart, and others also offer this service.
 Online with local pickup: Here’s my favorite option. Many national
chains enable you to upload your picture files for easy ordering but 
pick up your prints at a local store.
This service is a great way to share prints with friends and family who
don’t live nearby. I can upload and order prints from my desk in
Indianapolis, for example, and have them printed at a store located a 
few miles from my parents’ home in Texas.
Printing from Nikon ViewNX
If you prefer to print your own pictures on a home or office printer, the process
is much the same as printing anything from your computer: You open the pic-
ture file in your photo software of choice, choose File➪Print, and specify the
print size, paper size, paper type, and so on, as usual.
The next sections explain how to print from Nikon ViewNX, the free photo-
organizer software provided with your camera. (You must download your 
pictures from your camera to your computer first, a process you can read
about in Chapter 8.) If you use some other software, the basic concepts are
the same, but you should check your program’s manual for details about 
specific printing options.
Printing a single image
To print a single image from ViewNX, first click the thumbnail of the image
that you want to print. (Chapter 8 explains all about viewing and selecting
images, if you need help.) Then take these steps:
1. Click the thumbnail for the image that you want to print. 
2. Click the Print icon on the toolbar or choose File➪Print.
Either way, you see the Print dialog box, shown in Figure 9-6.
245
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos

246
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 9-6: Click the Page Setup button to select a different paper size or orientation.
3. Check the printer information in the lower-left corner of the dialog box.
Look in the area labeled “Current printer setup” in Figure 9-6. This infor-
mation tells you the currently selected printer, paper size, and print ori-
entation (vertical or horizontal). If needed, you can change the setup as
follows:
• Change the paper size or orientation. Click the Page Setup button.
You’re then taken to the standard Windows or Mac Page Setup
dialog box, which works just the same as when you set up any
print job.
• Select a different printer on a Mac or in Windows XP. Click the Printer
button at the bottom of the Page Setup dialog box. After making
your selections, click OK to return to the Print dialog box.
• Select a different printer in Windows Vista. You must exit the Page
Setup dialog box, close ViewNX, and then use the Windows Control
Panel’s Printers utility to make the printer the default printer. Then
restart ViewNX and choose File➪Print again; the printer should
then appear selected in the ViewNX Print dialog box. (Sorry, I just
report the rules, I don’t make ’em.)
Current printer setup

4. Select an option from the Print As drop-down list.
You get three choices: 
• Full Page: Choose this option if you want to devote the entire sheet
of paper to your photograph.
• Index Print: You can use this option to print tiny thumbnails of a
batch of photos; see the next section for details.
• Standard Photo Sizes: Choose this option to print your image at
common print sizes: 4 x 6 inches, 5 x 7 inches, and the like.
5. Select an option from the Format list.
Your choices depend on whether you selected Full Page or Standard
Photo Sizes in Step 4:
• Full Page options: Choose Fit to Page to automatically reduce or
enlarge the image as needed to fit the selected paper size. Or, if
you want the photo to spread across the entire sheet of paper,
select Fill Page. Choosing this option may mean that your photo
has to be cropped to fit the proportions of the paper. (See the 
earlier section “Allow for different print proportions” to better
understand this issue.)
By using the Resize Photo slider, you can reduce the image size if
you select Fit to Page from the Format list. If you select Fill Page
from the list, you can enlarge the image; any areas that expand
beyond the page boundaries are cropped away. Either way, the 
preview updates to show you the results of the slider setting. 
Select the Rotate to Fit box to automatically adjust the orientation
of the image to best fit the page.
• Standard Photo Sizes options: Select a photo size from the Format
list. When you do, the dialog box preview updates to show you the
size and positioning of the image with respect to the selected
paper size.
If the selected paper size is large enough to accommodate multiple
copies of your photo at the chosen print size, the preview displays
dotted rectangles to indicate the orientation you must use to
achieve that print size. For example: When you set the paper size
to 8 x 10 inches and select 4 x 6 as your print size, you must orient
the photo with the long side running horizontally and the short
side running vertically, as shown in Figure 9-7. Select the Rotate to
Fit check box to tell the program to automatically adjust the orien-
tation of your image if needed to maintain the print size.
Select the Crop Photos to Fit check box if you want the program to
automatically enlarge and crop your image as necessary to match
the proportions of the chosen print size. The preview updates
show you the results of the adjustment.

Figure 9-7: The dotted outline represents the appropriate image orientation for the selected 
layout.
6. Specify the number of copies per page via the Print drop-down list.
You can print as many as five copies per page. If your print size is too
large for all copies to fit on a single page, the program creates additional
pages to hold the overflow.
This setting determines only how many duplicates of the image appear
on a single piece of paper. You set up the number of copies of your print
job via the Printer dialog box, in Step 11.
7. To print camera metadata and other text with the image, select the
Print Photo Information check box.
Metadata, introduced in Chapter 8, is simply extra data that is stored
with your image file when you snap a picture. The metadata records
camera settings such as aperture, shutter speed, date, and more.
8. Click the Settings button to specify what data to include with the print.
When you click the button, you see the Advanced Print Information
Settings dialog box shown in Figure 9-8. On the Photo Information tab,
select the boxes for the metadata you want to print with the image. Click
the Header/Footer tab to add custom text to the top of every page

(header text) or to the bottom of every page (the footer text). Click 
OK when you’re done to close the dialog box.
Figure 9-8: You can print picture metadata along with the image.
9. From the Printer Type drop-down list, select the print technology that
matches your printer.
You get only two choices: Inkjet and All Others. (This option should
automatically be selected for you, but double-check just in case.)
10. When printing NEF (Raw) images, select a Print Priority option.
This setting determines whether the program outputs the image using
the actual Raw data or a temporary preview that is created to enable
you to view your images before converting them to a standard format.
(Chapter 8 explains this process.) For best results, select Quality.
Although you can print Raw images directly from ViewNX, you may not
be able to do so from other photo software. If the program you want to
use for printing can’t deal with Nikon Raw images (NEF files), follow the
instructions in Chapter 8 to convert the images to a standard format
before printing.
11. Click the Print button.
The standard Windows or Mac Print dialog box opens. Set up the remain-
ing print options as you see fit — the options vary depending on your
printer. Do be sure to choose the right paper type (glossy, matte, and so
on). Check your printer manual for other settings recommended for out-
putting photo prints.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
The printing features of ViewNX are designed to give you a quick and conve-
nient way to print original images from your D60. But if you use your photo
software to crop an image to some nonstandard dimensions — maybe 4 inches
by 4 inches to fit a square photo frame, for example — you’re better off print-
ing from your photo software because ViewNX doesn’t offer a custom print-size
option. You can either fill an entire sheet of paper or print at the established,
common print dimensions. Most photo editors, on the other hand, enable you
to precisely control print output size and resolution as well as position images
on the page.
Printing multiple images and index prints
You also can use ViewNX to print several different images at the same time.
The steps are just as outlined in the preceding section, except that you select
all the thumbnails for the images you want to print in Step 1. You can choose
to put each picture on its own piece of paper or put multiple images on the
same page. 
To select multiple thumbnails, click the first one and then Ctrl+click (Windows)
or Ô+click (Mac) the others. To select all photos in a folder, press Ctrl+A
(Windows) Ô+A (Mac).
ViewNX offers one other handy option: You can create an index print that con-
tains thumbnails of a batch of photos, as shown in Figure 9-9. Again, follow
the steps in the preceding section, but select in Step 1 all the image thumb-
nails you want to include in the index print. Then, in Step 4, choose Index
Print. You then can specify the layout and design of the index print by using
the other options in the dialog box.
DPOF, PictBridge, and computerless printing
Your Nikon offers two technologies, called DPOF
(dee-poff)and PictBridge, that enable you to print
images directly from your camera or memory
card, without using the computer as middle-
machine. In order to take advantage of direct
printing, your printer must also support one of the
two technologies, and you must capture the
images in the JPEG file format, which I explain in
Chapter 3. (You can also capture the photo in the
Raw format and then use your D60’s in-camera
conversion tool to make a JPEG copy suitable for
direct printing.)
DPOF stands for Digital Print Order Format. With
this option, accessed via your camera’s Playback
menu, you select the pictures on your memory
card that you want to print, and you specify how
many copies you want of each image. Then, if
your photo printer has an SD Card slot and sup-
ports DPOF, you just pop the memory card into
that slot. The printer reads your “print order” and
outputs just the requested copies of your
selected images. (You use the printer’s own con-
trols to set paper size, print orientation, and other
print settings.)

Figure 9-9: For a handy record of all photos in a folder, create an index print.
251
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
PictBridge works a little differently. If you have a
PictBridge-enabled photo printer, you can con-
nect the camera to the printer using the USB
cable supplied with your camera. A PictBridge
interface appears on the camera monitor, and
you use the camera controls to select the pic-
tures you want to print. With PictBridge, you
specify additional print options, such as page
size and whether you want to print a border
around the photo, from the camera as well.
Both DPOF and PictBridge are especially useful
in scenarios where you need fast printing. For
example, if you shoot pictures at a party and
want to deliver prints to guests before they go
home, DPOF offers a quicker option than firing
up your computer, downloading pictures, and so
on. And if you invest in one of the tiny portable
photo printers on the market today, you can
easily make prints away from your home or
office — you can take both your portable printer
and camera along to your regional sales meet-
ing, for example. 
For the record, I prefer DPOF to PictBridge
because with PictBridge, you have to deal with
cabling the printer and camera together. Also, the
camera must be turned on for the whole printing
process, wasting battery power. But if you’re
interested in exploring either printing feature,
your camera manual provides complete details.

Preparing Pictures for E-Mail
How many times have you received an e-mail message that looks like the one
in Figure 9-10? Some well-meaning friend or relative has sent you a digital
photo that is so large that it’s impossible to view the whole thing on your
monitor.
The problem is that computer monitors can display only a limited number of
pixels. The exact number depends on the monitor’s resolution setting and the
capabilities of the computer’s video card, but suffice it to say that the aver-
age photo from one of today’s digital cameras has a pixel count in excess of
what the monitor can handle. Figure 9-10, for example, shows you how much
of a 6-megapixel image is viewable when displayed in a typical e-mail program
window. And the image you see in Figure 9-10 contains far fewer pixels than
the 10 megapixels produced by your D60’s top Image Size setting!
In general, a good rule is to limit a photo to no more than 640 pixels at its
longest dimension. That ensures that people can view your entire picture
without scrolling, as in Figure 9-11. This image measures 640 x 428 pixels. 
As you can see, it’s plenty large enough to provide a decent photo-viewing
experience. On a small monitor, it may even be too large.
Figure 9-10: The attached image has too many pixels to be viewed without scrolling.

This size recommendation means that even if you shoot at your D60’s lowest
Image Size setting (1936 x 1296 pixels), you need to dump pixels from 
your images before sending them to the cyber post office. You have a couple
of options for creating an e-mail-sized image:
 Use the Small Picture feature on your camera’s Retouch menu. This 
feature enables you to create your e-mail copy right in the camera.
 Downsample the image in your photo editor. Downsampling is geekspeak
for dumping pixels. Most photo editors offer a feature that handles this
process for you. Use this option if you want to crop or otherwise edit
the photo before sharing it.
The next two sections walk you through the steps for both ways of creating
your e-mail images. You can use the same steps, by the way, for sizing images
for any onscreen use, whether it’s for a Web page or multimedia presentation.
You may want your copies to be larger or smaller than the recommended
e-mail size for those uses, however. 
Figure 9-11: Keep e-mail pictures to no larger than 640 pixels wide or tall.

One last point about onscreen images: Remember that pixel count has
absolutely no effect on the quality of pictures displayed onscreen. Pixel 
count determines only the size at which your images are displayed.
Creating small copies using the camera
To create small, e-mailable copies of your images without using a computer,
use your camera’s Small Picture feature. Here’s how:
1. Display the Retouch menu and highlight Small Picture, as shown on
the left in Figure 9-12.
2. Press OK to display the screen shown on the right in Figure 9-12.
3. Highlight Choose Size and press the Multi Selector right.
Now you see a list of three picture-size options, as shown in Figure 9-13.
Figure 9-12: You can create a low-resolution copy of your image via the Retouch menu.
4. Highlight the size you want to
use for your copy.
For pictures that you plan to send
via e-mail, choose either 640 x
480 or 320 x 240 pixels unless 
the recipient is connected to the
Internet via a very slow, dial-up
modem connection. In that case,
you may want to go one step
down, to 160 x 120 pixels. (The
display size of the picture may 
be quite small at that setting
however, depending on the reso-
lution of the monitor on which
the picture is viewed.)
Figure 9-13: The medium size option is good
for e-mail images.

The largest option, 640 x 480
pixels, is more suitable to creat-
ing pictures for multimedia pre-
sentations or for viewing on a
television screen, an option you
can explore at the end of this
chapter.
5. Press OK to return to the main
Small Picture screen (shown on
the right in Figure 9-12).
6. Highlight Select Picture and
press the Multi Selector right.
Now you see thumbnails of all the
images on your memory card, as
shown in Figure 9-14.
7. Use the Multi Selector to select an image (or images) for copying, as
follows:
• Press right or left to scroll the display until the yellow highlight
box surrounds the image you want to copy and resize.
• Press up to tag the image for copying. A little Small Picture icon
like the one you see on the top left thumbnail in Figure 9-14
appears on the image.
• Press down to deselect the image. The Small Picture icon 
disappears.
8. After selecting all the photos
you want to copy, press OK.
The camera displays a screen like
the one in Figure 9-15, asking you
to confirm that you want small
copies created. 
9. Highlight Yes and press OK.
The camera duplicates the
selected images and downsam-
ples them to achieve the size you
specified in Step 4.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
When you view your small-size
copies on the camera monitor, they
appear surrounded by a gray
border, as shown in Figure 9-16. 
A tiny Retouch icon appears on the
display as well, as labeled in the
figure. Note that you can’t zoom in
to magnify the view of small-size
copies as you can your original
images.
The camera automatically names
the small copies using the file
number of the original image but
with the letters SSC at the start of
the name. So, for example, if the
original filename is DSC_0143.jpg,
the small copy is named SSC_0143.jpg. 
If you’re a math lover, you may have noticed that the Small Copy function cre-
ates pictures that have an aspect ratio of 4:3, while your original images have
an aspect ratio of 3:2. The camera trims the small-copy image as needed to fit
the 4:3 proportions.
Downsizing images in Nikon ViewNX
You can also create a low-resolution copy of your image in ViewNX. However,
be aware that the program restricts you to a minimum size of 640 pixels along
the photo’s longest side.
If you need a smaller version, use the in-camera Small Picture option to
create the copy instead. Or, if you own a photo editing program, investigate
its image-resizing capabilities; you likely can create the small copy at any
dimensions you like.
That said, if the 640-pixel restriction isn’t a problem, follow these steps to
create your small-size copy in ViewNX:
1. Select the image thumbnail in the main ViewNX window.
Chapter 8 explains how to view your image thumbnails, if you need help.
Just click a thumbnail to select it.
2. Choose File➪Convert Files.
You see the dialog box shown in Figure 9-17. (As with other figures, this
one shows the box as it appears in Windows Vista; it may appear slightly
different on a Mac or in other versions of Windows, but the essentials
are the same.)
Retouch icon
Figure 9-16: The gray border indicates a small-
size copy.

Figure 9-17: You also can reduce photos to e-mail size in Nikon ViewNX.
3. Select JPEG from the File Format drop-down list, as shown in the figure.
The other format option, TIFF, is a print format. Web browsers and
e-mail programs can’t display TIFF images, so be sure to use JPEG.
4. Select the Change the Image Size check box.
Now the Short Edge and Long Edge text boxes become available. 
5. Type the desired pixel count of the longest side of your picture into
the Long Edge box.
The program automatically adjusts the Short Edge value to keep the
resized image proportional.
Again, to ensure that the picture is viewable without scrolling when
opened in the recipient’s e-mail program, I suggest that you keep the
Long Edge value at 640 pixels or less, which is the minimum size permit-
ted by the Convert Files feature.
6. Adjust the Compression Ratio slider to set the amount of JPEG file
compression.
As Chapter 3 explains, a greater degree of compression results in a
smaller file, which takes less time to download over the Web, but
reduces image quality. Notice that as you move the slider to the right,
257
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos

258
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
the resulting quality level appears above the slider. For example, in
Figure 9-17, the level is Excellent Quality.
Because the resolution of your image already results in a very small file,
you can probably use the highest quality setting without worrying too
much about download times. The exception is if you plan to attach mul-
tiple pictures to the same e-mail message, in which case you may want
to set the slider a notch or two down from the highest quality setting.
7. Select the next three check boxes (Remove Camera Setting Information,
Remove XMP/IPTC Information, and Remove ICC Color Profile) in the
dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-17. 
When selected, the three options save the resized picture without the
original image metadata, the extra text data that your camera stores
with the image or you enter when organizing your files. (Chapter 8
explains.) Including this metadata adds to the file size, so for normal
e-mail sharing, strip it out. The exception, of course, is when you want
the recipient to be able to view the metadata in a photo program that
can do so.
8. Set the file destination.
In layman’s terms, that just means to tell the program the location of the
folder or drive where you want to store your downsized image file. 
The current destination appears just to the left of the Browse button. 
To choose a different folder, click that Browse button.
By selecting the Create a New Subfolder for Each File Conversion check
box, you can create a new subfolder within your selected storage folder.
If you do, the resized file goes into that subfolder, which you can name
by clicking the Naming Options button.
9. Specify a filename for the resized copy (optional).
By default, ViewNX names the small copy using the original filename
plus a two-number sequential tag: If the original filename is DSC_186.jpg,
for example, the small-copy filename is DSC_186_01.jpg. You can change
a couple of aspects of this filenaming routine by selecting the Change
File Names check box and then clicking the Naming Options button and
adjusting the settings in the resulting dialog box. After making your
wishes known, click OK to return to the Convert Files dialog box.
10. Click the Convert button to finish the process.
ViewNX also offers an e-mail wizard that enables you to resize and send
photos by e-mail in one step. If you use this feature, however, you don’t
create an actual small-size copy of your file; the program simply reduces the
size of the file temporarily for e-mail transmission. Also, the wizard works
only with certain e-mail programs. On the plus side, the wizard permits you
to send a photo at a much smaller size than you can create with the Convert
Files feature. For more details, check out the ViewNX Help system.

Creating a Digital Slide Show
Many photo-editing and cataloging programs offer a tool for creating digital
slide shows that can be viewed on a computer or, if copied to a DVD, on a
DVD player. You can even add music, special transition effects, and the like to
jazz up your presentations.
But if you just want a simple slide show — that is, one that simply displays all
the photos on the camera memory card one by one — you don’t need a com-
puter or any photo software. You can create and run the slide show right on
your camera. And by connecting your camera to a television, as outlined in
the last section of this chapter, you can present your show to a whole room-
ful of people.
Follow these steps:
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Slide Show, as shown on the
left in Figure 9-18.
2. Press OK to display the Slide Show screen shown on the right in
Figure 9-18.
Figure 9-18: Choose Slide Show to set up automatic playback of all pictures on your memory
card.
3. Highlight Frame Interval and press the Multi Selector right.
You see the screen shown on the left in Figure 9-19. Here, you can spec-
ify how long you want each image to be displayed. You can set the 
interval to 2, 3, 5, or 10 seconds.
4. Highlight the frame interval you want to use and press OK.
Now you see the right screen in Figure 9-19.
5. To start the show, highlight Start and press OK.
The camera begins displaying your pictures on the camera monitor
(and, if the camera is connected to your TV, on the TV set as well).

Figure 9-19: You can adjust the display time for each image.
When the show ends, you see a screen
similar to the one in Figure 9-20. You
can choose to restart the show, adjust
the frame interval, or exit to the
Playback menu. Highlight your choice
and press OK.
During the show, you can control play-
back as follows:
 Pause show: Press OK. Select
Restart and press OK to begin
displaying pictures again.
Online photo sharing: Read the fine print
If you want to share more than a couple of
photos, consider posting your images at an
online photo-album site instead of attaching
them to e-mail messages. Photo-sharing sites
such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Picasa all
enable you to create digital photo albums and
then invite friends and family to view your pic-
tures and order prints of their favorites.
At most sites, picture-sharing is free, but your
albums and images are deleted if you don’t
order prints or make some other purchase from
the site within a specified amount of time.
Additionally, many free sites enable you to
upload high-resolution files for printing but then
don’t let you retrieve those files from the site. (In
other words, don’t think of album sites as
archival storage solutions.) And here’s another
little bit of fine print to investigate: The mem-
bership agreement at some sites states that you
agree to let the site use your photos, for free, for
any purpose that it sees fit.
Figure 9-20: This message appears after the
last image in the show.

 Exit show: You’ve got three options: 
• To return to full-frame, regular playback, press the Playback
button.
• To return to the Playback menu, press the Menu button.
• To return to picture-taking mode, press the shutter button halfway.
 Display next/previous image: Press the Multi Selector left to display the
previous image; press right to advance to the next image.
 Change the information displayed with the image: Press the Multi
Selector up or down to cycle through the info-display modes. (See
Chapter 4 for details on what information is provided in each mode.)
Turning Still Photos into a Stop-Motion Movie
By using the Stop-Motion Movie feature on the Retouch menu, you can com-
bine a series of still images into your very own movie. More precisely, you
can create brief, animation-style digital videos that can be played on the 
computer. You also can connect your camera to a TV for playback; see the
next section for details.
One popular use of this feature is to animate still objects, similar to what
Hollywood types do when producing so-called “claymation” movies. Here’s
an example: You take 50 shots of a riderless tricycle on your driveway. Before
each shot, you rotate the pedals slightly to move the bike forward so that
each image captures the bike at a different spot on the driveway. In your fin-
ished movie, the individual images are displayed sequentially, at a pace rapid
enough to create the illusion that the bike is moving across the driveway by
itself, as if it had a ghost rider. 
You can also use the Stop-Motion Movie feature to reanimate a subject that
was actually moving of its own volition during your shoot. For example, on 
a recent trip to a local garden, I spotted a butterfly posing on a leaf. As he
opened and closed his wings, I clicked off a rapid-fire series of images so that
I could capture his wings at different positions. Turned into a stop-motion
movie, the images blended together to reproduce the fluttering of the butter-
fly’s wings.
Lest you get the wrong idea here, I should stress that the Stop-Motion Movie
feature isn’t designed to replace a real video or movie camera. First, the
movies you can produce on your D60 can be recorded and played at a maxi-
mum of 15 frames per second, whereas the standard for motion-picture films
is 24 frames per second; video, at 30 frames per second. The difference means
261
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos

262
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
that your stop-motion movies appear a little jerky — more like what you see
when you fast-forward through a movie on DVD — and not like the smooth,
seamless scenes you watch on your TV or at the local cineplex.
Second, the D60 limits the number of images in a movie to 100. So if you have
100 frames, played back at 15 frames per second, the maximum length of
your stop-motion movie is just shy of 7 seconds. If you want a longer movie,
you need to create separate movie files and then join them together in a
video-editing program. (If you have such a program, you may find it easier to
just import your images into it and join them together there instead of doing
the job in the camera.) 
Despite its limitations, though, the Stop-Motion Movie feature provides an
interesting creative option for a slow day. And if all this frames-per-second
and other movie talk has you a little confused, don’t worry. After you create
your first movie, which I show you how to do in the upcoming steps, every-
thing should become clear. It’s one of those things that’s much easier to do
than to describe in text, especially since I can’t provide a little sample movie
player and movie on this page.
To get started, first record a series of images of a moving subject. You can
either stage the movement, as in my tricycle illustration, or capture a real
moving object like my butterfly.
Try setting your camera’s Release mode to Continuous if you’re shooting a
moving subject. In this mode, explained at the end of Chapter 2, you can
record multiple images with one press of the shutter button. See Chapter 7
for more tips on capturing action.
After you have your images recorded, take these steps to turn them into a
movie:
1. Open the Retouch menu and
highlight Stop-Motion Movie, as
shown in Figure 9-21.
You see the three options shown
on the left in Figure 9-22.
2. Press OK.
3. Highlight Frame Size and press
the Multi Selector right.
Now you see the screen shown on
the right in Figure 9-22. Here, you
set the pixel dimensions — that is,
the size of the movie frames, in
pixels. The larger the size, the
larger you can view the finished
Figure 9-21: The Stop-Motion Movie feature
enables you to animate a series of still photos.

movie. But a larger frame size also means a larger data file needed to store
the movie. So for online sharing, consider using one of the two smaller
sizes to reduce the time people must spend downloading the file.
Figure 9-22: The frame dimensions affect the size of the data file needed to store the movie on 
your memory card.
To understand how pixels display onscreen, whether it’s a TV or com-
puter monitor, see “Preparing Pictures for E-Mail,” earlier in this chapter.
Chapter 3 offers some additional tips about pixels.
4. Select a frame size and press OK.
5. Highlight Frame Rate, as shown on the left in Figure 9-23, and press
the Multi Selector right.
You’re presented with the screen shown on the right in the figure. Here,
you specify the number of frames per second in your movie. The higher
the frame rate, the smoother the playback, but the shorter the movie
duration.
Figure 9-23: For the smoothest playback, choose 15 frames per second (fps).
263
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos

6. Select a frame rate and press OK.
You’re returned to the main Stop-motion movie screen.
7. Highlight Create Movie, as shown on the left in Figure 9-24, and 
press OK.
You see a screen similar to the one on the right in Figure 9-24, with
thumbnails of the images on your memory card.
Figure 9-24: Select the image that you want to use as the starting frame of the movie.
8. Highlight the image that you want to use as the starting shot in the
movie.
Notice that one thumbnail is sur-
rounded by a yellow box and is
marked with the word Start — in
Figure 9-24, it’s image 155. Press
the Multi Selector right or left
until that Start icon lands on the
image that you want to use to
kick off your movie.
9. Press OK to select the high-
lighted image.
The highlight is then replaced
with a version that says End
instead of Start, as shown in
Figure 9-25.
10. Highlight the image that will be the last one in the movie and press OK.
Figure 9-25: Then select the ending frame of
the movie.

Again, just press the Multi Selector right or left to move the highlight
over the ending image. Don’t worry if there are frames between the Start
and End images that you don’t want to include in the movie; you can
exclude them in the next step.
The little “filmstrip” at the bottom of the screen displays thumbnails of
the images you selected as the Start and End pictures, as shown on the
left in Figure 9-26.
Figure 9-26: Select Edit to exclude frames or change the start or end frame.
11. Edit out any unwanted intermediate frames (optional).
If you don’t want to include one
or more of the frames that fall
between your start and end
frame, highlight Edit, as shown on
the left in Figure 9-26, and press
OK. You then see the screen
shown on the right in the figure.
Highlight Middle Image and press
OK to return to a thumbnail view
that displays all the frames
between your start and end
images, as shown in Figure 9-27.
Images marked with a check
mark are tagged to be included 
in the movie. Press the Multi
Selector left or right to highlight a frame and then press up or down to
toggle the check mark on or off.
265
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
Figure 9-27: Frames with a check mark are
included in the movie.

266
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Should you decide to change the start or end frame, select Starting
Image or End Image instead of Middle Image when you see the screen
shown on the right in Figure 9-26. Then simply re-choose your start or
end frame and press OK.
12. Highlight Save, as shown on the left in Figure 9-28, and press OK.
Now you see the screen shown on the right in the figure.
Figure 9-28: Choose Preview to take a look at your movie before you actually save the file.
13. Highlight Preview and press OK.
The camera plays a preview of your movie. If you’re not happy with the
results, you can take two routes:
• Adjust the Frame Rate. Highlight Frame Rate and press OK to adjust
the frame rate that you selected in Step 5. You must do this before
you save the movie file, or the camera saves the file at the original
frame rate.
• Select different images for the movie. Highlight Edit and press OK to
return to the Edit screen (see the right figure in Figure 9-26) to
change the start, end, or intermediate images in the movie. After
you do so, press OK to return to the Create Movie screen you see
on the right in Figure 9-28.
14. Highlight Save and press OK.
The camera takes a few seconds to process and store the movie file,
which is recorded in a standard digital movie format known as AVI. Then
the first image in the movie appears in full frame on the monitor, as
shown in Figure 9-29.

To play the movie, press OK when you
see the screen shown in Figure 9-29.
Or display the Playback menu and
highlight Stop-Motion Movie, as 
shown on the left in Figure 9-30, and
press OK.
You then see a screen that displays
thumbnails representing the starting
image of all stop-motion movies on the
memory card. In the right image in
Figure 9-30, for example, you see the
starting image of the butterfly movie
that I created. (This movie was the
only one on the card, so just one
thumbnail is displayed.) Use the Multi Selector to highlight the thumbnail
that represents the movie you want to play (again, only if you created multi-
ple movies on the card) and press OK.
Figure 9-30: You can play movies on the memory card by choosing Stop-Motion Movie from
the Playback menu.
During playback, a little control bar appears at the bottom of the screen,
looking something like the pause, forward, reverse and stop buttons found 
on most video and DVD players. To use those playback buttons, press the
Multi Selector right or left to highlight the control you want to use and 
then press OK. 
After you transfer your image files to the computer, you also can view your
movie in any program that can handle AVI files.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Viewing Your Photos on a Television
Your Nikon is equipped with a video-out port, which is tucked under the little
rubber cover on the left-rear side of the camera, as shown on the left in
Figure 9-31. That feature means that you can output your pictures for display
on a television screen.
To take advantage of this option, you need to purchase a special video cable;
the one that fits your D60 goes by the Nikon part name Video Cable EG-D100.
Unfortunately, the cable isn’t provided in the camera box, but at a price of
around $10, it’s worth adding to your equipment bag.
Figure 9-31: You can connect your camera to a television for big-screen playback.
The cable has little yellow plug ends like those you see in Figure 9-31. Turn
the camera off and then plug the end of the cable that’s shown in the left
image in the figure into the camera’s video-out port. Next, plug the other end
of the cable into the video-in port on your television, as shown in the right
half of the figure. (You can also insert the plug into the video-in port on a VCR
or DVD player that’s connected to your TV.)
When the two devices are connected, turn the camera and TV (or VCR or
DVD) on. At this point, you need to consult your TV/VCR/DVD manual to 
find out what channel to select for playback of signals from auxiliary input
devices like your camera. After you sort that issue out, you can control play-
back using the same camera controls as you normally do to view pictures on
your camera monitor. You can also run a slide show by following the steps
outlined earlier in this chapter, in the section “Creating a Digital Slide Show.”

And if you create a stop-motion movie,
following the process laid out in the
section just before this one, you can
view that creative work on the TV as
well.
Note that you may need to adjust one
camera setting, Video Mode, which is
found on the Setup menu, as shown in
Figure 9-32. You get just two options
here: NTSC and PAL. Select the video
mode that is used by your part of the
world. (In the United States, Canada,
and Mexico, NTSC is the standard.)

some minor picture touchups, such as cropping
and adjusting exposure, by using a combination of
tools on your camera’s Retouch menu and those
in most photo-editing programs. Following that,
Chapter 11 introduces you to ten camera func-
tions that I consider specialty tools — bonus

very photographer produces a clunker image now and then. When it hap-
pens to you, don’t be too quick to reach for the Delete button on your
camera. Many common problems are surprisingly easy to fix, either by using
the Retouch menu on your camera or the tools in your photo editing software.
This chapter shows you both options for rescuing a less-than-perfect
photo. Look here for the step-by-step instructions for using the
quick-and-easy in-camera tools for removing red-eye, trim-
ming away excess background, adjusting exposure, and
tweaking color. For times when the in-camera retouch-
ing features aren’t enough, this chapter also intro-
duces you to some of the retouching tools found in
most photo editing programs.
For computer-based repairs, the steps in this chap-
ter feature Adobe Photoshop Elements, a popular
program that’s available for both Windows and Mac
systems. The figures feature version 6 for Windows,
so if you use another version of the program, what you
see on your computer screen may look different than
what you see here. The basics of using the tools that I
cover, however, are the same from version to version unless 
I state otherwise. In fact, even if you use some program other than
Elements, you should be able to translate the steps easily to your software,
as these retouching tools work in a fairly standard fashion no matter where
you find them.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Two Ways to Repair Red-Eye
From my experience, red-eye is not a major problem with the D60. Typically,
the problem occurs only in very dark lighting, which makes sense: When little
ambient light is available, the pupils of the subjects’ eyes widen, creating
more potential for the flash light to cause red-eye reflection.
If you spot a red-eye problem before you transfer photos to your computer,
you can try removing it with the built-in red-eye remover on your camera’s
Retouch menu. On occasion, that tool may not recognize that you have a 
red-eye issue, however, or may not repair the eye in a way you approve.
Sometimes, the camera’s red-eye filter can mistake ordinary red pixels for
red-eye pixels. In that case, or if you don’t realize a problem until you view
your image close-up on your computer monitor, most photo editing programs
have red-eye removal tools that enable you to specify exactly which areas of
the photo need correction.
The next two sections show you each method for fixing the problem. For tips
on avoiding red-eye in the first place, visit the portrait-shooting section of
Chapter 7.
Unfortunately, no red-eye remover works on animal eyes. Red-eye removal
tools know how to detect and replace only red-eye pixels, and animal eyes
typically turn yellow, white, or green in response to a flash. The only solution
is to use the paintbrush tool found in most photo editors to paint in the
proper eye colors. Be careful not to paint over the white specular highlight
that naturally occurs in the eye. (Or if you do, replace it with a small dab of
white paint.)
Using the in-camera red-eye remover
Follow these steps to use the red-eye repair tool found on the camera’s
Retouch menu:
1. Display the Retouch menu and highlight Red-Eye Correction, as
shown on the left in Figure 10-1.
2. Press OK to display thumbnails of the images on your memory card,
as shown on the right in Figure 10-1.
An X appears over any photos that weren’t taken with a flash — meaning
that red-eye shouldn’t be a problem for those images.
3. Scroll the display until the thumbnail for the picture you want to fix is
surrounded by the yellow highlight box.
Press the Multi Selector left and right to scroll the thumbnail display.

Figure 10-1: An automated red-eye remover is built right into your camera.
4. Press OK.
If the camera can detect
red-eye, it applies the
removal filter and dis-
plays the results in the
monitor, as shown in
Figure 10-2. Move on to
Step 5 to evaluate and
approve the change.
If the camera can’t find
any red-eye, it displays
a message telling you
so. Skip to the next sec-
tion, where you can
find out how to repair
red-eye in your photo
editing software.
5. Carefully inspect the repair.
Press the Zoom button to magnify the display so that you can check the
camera’s work. To scroll the display, press the Multi Selector up, down,
right, or left. The yellow box in the tiny navigation window in the 
lower-right corner of the screen indicates the area of the picture that
you’re currently viewing.
If your image contains red objects or areas other than the eyes, pan
around the frame to check those parts of the image, too. The automated
red-eye remover can sometimes get confused and try to repair red areas
that it shouldn’t.
275
Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Retouching Tricks
Figure 10-2: Zoom in to inspect the repair.

276
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
6. If you’re satisfied with the repair, press OK.
The camera creates a retouched copy of your original image and saves
the copy in the JPEG format. The filename of the repaired image begins
with the letters CSC instead of the usual DSC to differentiate it from an
original. During image playback, the top-left corner of the screen also
displays the Retouch icon (the tiny paintbrush, visible in the icon
column of the screens in Figure 10-1).
One more tip regarding this and the other Retouch menu options: You can
also access them from full-frame Playback mode. When the image you want
to retouch is displayed, just press the OK button to display a miniaturized
version of the Retouch menu over the image. Then select the menu option 
as usual. If you choose to go this route, you don’t see the image-selection
thumbnails that I discuss in Step 3 and show in Figure 10-1 and in other fig-
ures in the chapter.
Removing red-eye in a photo editor
Most photo editing programs offer a red-eye removal tool. Typically, you
either click a single button, after which the software attempts to automati-
cally detect and repair red-eye, or you click in the red-eye area to tell the 
program exactly what pixels to fix. The Photoshop Elements version of 
this tool offers both approaches. I prefer to bypass the first option, though;
it’s just not as reliable (or fast) as the other method. As with the in-camera
red-eye filter, fully automated red-eye correctors — in Elements and in other
programs — sometimes “correct” the wrong red pixels.
Here are the steps that I find work the best:
1. Select the Zoom tool, labeled in Figure 10-3.
Now drag around the first set of eyes you want to fix so that you can get
a close-up view, as shown in the figure.
2. Select the Red-Eye Removal tool, also labeled in Figure 10-3.
3. Click on the red pixels in the first eye.
(The tool cursor looks like a little white plus sign, as shown in the left
eye in Figure 10-3.) After you click, the program attempts to replace the
red pixels with the proper eye colors. If you’re happy with the results,
rinse and repeat to fix the remaining red eyes. 
If you aren’t happy with the repair, choose Edit➪Undo and try again.
Before you reclick in the eye, try adjusting the values for the Pupil Size
and Darken Amount options, found on the options bar (that horizontal
bar just above the image window). The first option adjusts the area that
is affected by the repair; the second, the brightness of the replacement
pixels.

Figure 10-3: To repair red-eye in Elements, just click on the red pixels.
Most red-eye removal tools, including the one in Elements, are pretty capable.
But if the eyes are very bright, the tool simply may not be able to make the
repair. As with animal eyes, the best solution is to just paint in the correct eye
colors by using your software’s paintbrush tool.
A Pair of Cropping Options
To crop a photo simply means to trim away some of its perimeter. Cropping
away excess background can often improve an image, as illustrated by my
original butterfly scene, shown in Figure 10-4, and its cropped cousin, shown
in Figure 10-5. When shooting this photo, I couldn’t get close enough to the
butterfly to fill the frame with it, and as a result, the original composition suf-
fers. Not only is there too much extraneous background, you can see the foot
of another photographer in the upper right corner. So I simply cropped the
image to the composition you see in Figure 10-5.

Figure 10-4: The original contains too much extraneous background.
Figure 10-5: Cropping creates a better composition and eliminates 
background clutter.
You may also want to crop an image so that it fits a specific frame size. As
Chapter 9 explains, the original images from your D60 fit perfectly in 4-x-6-
inch frames, but if you want a 5 x 7, 8 x 10, or other standard print size, you
need to crop your image to those new proportions. (If you don’t, the photo
printer software or retail print lab will crop for you, and the result may not 
be the composition that you’d choose.)
As with red-eye removal, you can crop your image using a command on the
camera’s Retouch menu or do the job in your photo editor. The next two 
sections explain both methods.

Whether you crop in your camera or on your computer, remember that crop-
ping eliminates pixels. If you crop too tightly, you may not wind up with
enough remaining pixels to produce a good print of the cropped photo. So
keep the original image resolution in mind as you make your cropping deci-
sions. For details on resolution and print size, see Chapters 3 and 9.
Applying in-camera cropping
With the Trim function on the Retouch menu, you can trim away excess back-
ground right in the camera. However, do note a few things about this feature:
 You can crop to only five specific sizes: 2560 x 1920 pixels, 1920 x 1440
pixels, 1280 x 960 pixels, 960 x 720 pixels, and 640 x 480 pixels. All these
sizes produce an image with proportions of 4:3. So if your purpose for
cropping is to prepare your image for a frame size that has different 
proportions, crop in your photo software instead.
 After you apply the Trim function, you can’t apply any other fixes from
the Retouch menu. So be sure to make trimming the last of your retouch-
ing steps.
Keeping those caveats in mind, trim your image as follows:
1. Display the Retouch menu and highlight Trim, as shown on the left in
Figure 10-6.
2. Press OK to display a screen showing thumbnails of your images, as
shown on the right in Figure 10-6.
Figure 10-6: You can perform limited cropping using the Trim function.
3. Scroll the display until the image you want to crop is surrounded by
the yellow highlight box.
Press the Multi Selector right or left to scroll the display.

4. Press OK.
Now you see a
screen similar to the
one in Figure 10-7. In
the lower-right
corner, the tiny
window shows you
the entire image. The
yellow highlight box
indicates the current
crop boundary.
Anything outside
that boundary is set
to be trimmed away.
The larger preview
shows you the image
as it will appear
when trimmed. In the
upper-left corner of
the preview, you see
the image dimensions (in pixels) that will result if you crop at the cur-
rent setting.
5. Adjust the crop boundary by using the Zoom button, Thumbnail
button, and Multi Selector.
Use these techniques:
• Press the Zoom button to zoom in on your image, which results in
a tighter crop.
• Press the Thumbnail button to zoom out, which expands the size
of the crop boundary, leaving more of your original image intact.
• Press the Multi Selector up, down, right, and left to shift the crop
boundary so that it falls over a different portion of the image.
As you zoom in or out, the image dimension values in the top-left corner
of the screen change to reflect how many pixels remain within the crop
boundary.
6. When you’re happy with the crop boundary, press OK to trim the
image.
The camera saves the cropped image as a new file, leaving your original
untouched. As with all retouched copies, the file is stored in the JPEG
file format, with a filename that begins with the letters CSC.

Cropping in a photo editor
Doing your picture cropping in a photo editor gives you much more say-so
over the result than using the Trim function in your camera. Whereas the
Trim function limits you to a few crop sizes and final proportions of only 4:3,
the Crop tool in most photo editors enables you to crop to any size or shape.
The following steps show you how to crop in Photoshop Elements. If you use
another program, the tool likely operates much the same way, but check your
software manual if you encounter tool options that are unfamiliar to you.
1. Select the Crop tool, labeled in Figure 10-8.
2. Select the desired crop proportions via the Aspect Ratio drop-down
list at the left end of the options bar, as shown in the figure.
Again, the options bar is the horizontal strip of controls across the top
of the image window. (Each time you select a tool, the options bar
changes to show you controls available for that tool.)
Figure 10-8: Choose the desired crop proportions from the Aspect Ratio drop-down list.
Crop tool
281
Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Retouching Tricks

282
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
You can select several standard print sizes from the drop-down list or, if
you don’t want to limit the tool to any particular size or shape, select No
Restriction.
Don’t choose the Use Photo Ratio option from the list. This option adds
pixels to, or resamples, your image after cropping so that you wind up
with the same number of pixels in your trimmed image as you had in
your original. Resampling almost always degrades picture quality, so
avoid doing so. (Chapter 9 offers an example.)
3. Check the Width and Height values.
If you chose a standard print size in Step 2, Elements automatically enters
the crop dimensions in the Width and Height boxes. If you want to reverse
those values, click the little pair of arrows between the two boxes.
4. Make sure that the Resolution box is empty.
If the box contains a value, the program will resample your image after
cropping — again, Not a Good Thing.
5. Drag across the image to create a dotted crop box, as shown in 
Figure 10-9.
Anything outside the crop box
appears dimmed to indicate the
image area that will be cropped
away.
6. Adjust the crop box if needed.
Use these techniques:
• To change the size of the crop
box: Drag the tiny squares, or
handles, that appear around its
perimeter. (See Figure 10-9.) If
you chose a specific crop size
in Step 2, you can drag the box
to any size, but you can’t
change the original propor-
tions. If you chose No
Restriction in Step 2, you can
adjust width and height inde-
pendently.
• To move the crop box: Place
your cursor inside the dotted
crop boundary and drag to
reposition it. Or after putting
your cursor inside the box,
press the arrow keys on your
keyboard to nudge the box one
pixel in the direction of the
arrow key.
Handle
Crop boundary
Accept
Cancel
Figure 10-9: After dragging an initial crop
box, drag the handles to adjust its size.

If you position your cursor outside a corner handle, the cursor changes
to a curved, double-headed arrow. Dragging while this cursor is active
tells the program that you want to rotate and crop the image at the same
time. In Elements, you get more control over image rotation if you use
the Image➪Transform➪Free Transform command, and you can preview
the rotation, which isn’t possible if you rotate while cropping. For those
reasons, I suggest that you don’t rotate as you crop. (If you do use Free
Transform, you see a bounding box that looks much like the crop box,
complete with handles. Just place your cursor outside a corner handle
and drag to rotate the photo.)
7. When you’re happy with the crop box, click the green Accept check
box (labeled in Figure 10-9).
The neighboring button, labeled Cancel in the figure, gets rid of the crop
box and cancels out of the operation without changing your image. (The
exact position of these two buttons varies slightly depending on the
position of the crop box with respect to the image margins.)
8. Choose File➪Save As to save your cropped image under a new 
filename.
If you choose the plain-old Save command, you overwrite your original
image, and you may want those original pixels back some day. Choose
TIFF or PSD as the file format; both formats produce the highest image
quality. (PSD is the Photoshop format.) If you need a JPEG copy of your
cropped image to share online, Chapter 9 shows you how to create one.
Focus Sharpening (Sort Of)
Have you ever seen one of those spy-movie thrillers where the good guys
capture a photo of the villain’s face — only the picture is so blurry that it
could just as easily be a picture of pudding? The heroes ask the photo-lab
experts to “enhance” the picture, and within seconds, it’s transformed into 
an image so clear you can make out individual hairs in the villain’s mustache.
It is with heavy heart that I tell you that this kind of image rescue is pure
Hollywood fantasy. You simply can’t take a blurry image and turn it into a
sharply focused photo, even with the most sophisticated photo software on
the market.
There is, however, a digital process called sharpening that can slightly
enhance the apparent focus of pictures that are slightly blurry, as illustrated
by the before and after images in Figure 10-10. Notice that I say “apparent”
focus: Sharpening doesn’t really adjust focus but instead creates the illusion
of sharper focus by increasing contrast in a special way.
283
Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Retouching Tricks

284
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Figure 10-10: A slightly blurry image (left) can benefit from a sharpening filter (right).
Here’s how it works: Wherever pixels of different colors come together, the
sharpening process boosts contrast along the border between them. The
light side of the border gets lighter; the dark side gets darker. Photography
experts refer to those light and dark strips as sharpening halos. You can get 
a close-up look at the halos in the right, sharpened example in Figure 10-11,
which shows a tiny portion of the face and background from the images in
Figure 10-10. Notice that in the sharpened example, the skin side of the
boundary between face and background received a light halo, while the back-
ground received a dark halo.
A little sharpening can go a long way toward improving a slightly soft image,
as shown in Figure 10-10. But too much sharpening does more damage than
good. The halos become so strong that they’re clearly visible and the image
takes on a sandpaper-like texture. And again, no amount of sharpening can
repair a truly out-of-focus image, so all you do when you crank up sharpening
is make matters worse.
To apply sharpening in your photo editor, your best bet is to use a filter called
the Unsharp Mask filter, which is found in advanced photo editing programs
and some beginner-level programs, including Photoshop Elements. Figure 10-12
shows you the filter dialog box from Photoshop Elements 6. To open the dialog
box, choose Enhance➪Unsharp Mask. (In Elements Version 4 and earlier,
instead choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask.)

Figure 10-11: Sharpening adds light and dark halos along color boundaries.
The Elements dialog box contains the
three controls common to most
Unsharp Mask filters. You adjust the
sharpening effect with these controls,
as follows:
 Amount: This slider adjusts the
intensity of the sharpening
halos.
 Radius: This slider adjusts the
width of the halos. Generally
speaking, you should keep the
value under 2 for print pictures
and even lower for pictures that
will be viewed onscreen.
Otherwise, you can create pretty
noticeable sharpening halos.
 Threshold: With this slider, you
can limit the sharpening effect
just to high-contrast color
boundaries. Try raising the value
a few notches up from 0 when
sharpening portraits to sharpen
the image without adding
unwanted texture to the skin.
If your photo software doesn’t have an Unsharp Mask filter, it may instead
offer a single Sharpening control. This type of sharpening filter isn’t as
sophisticated as Unsharp Mask because you can only increase or decrease

the sharpening amount — you can’t fine-tune the effect as you can with the
Amount, Radius, and Threshold options of Unsharp Mask. So keep a close
watch on your image to make sure that you aren’t oversharpening.
Shadow Recovery with D-Lighting
In Chapter 5, I introduce you to a feature called Active D-Lighting. If you turn
on this option when you shoot a picture, the camera captures the image in 
a way that brightens the darkest parts of the image, bringing shadow detail
into the light, while preserving highlight detail as well. It’s a great trick for
dealing with high-contrast scenes or subjects that are backlit.
You can also apply this kind of adjustment after you take a picture by choos-
ing the D-Lighting option on the Retouch menu. I took this approach for the
photo in Figure 10-13, where strong backlighting left the balloon underex-
posed in the original image.
Figure 10-13: An underexposed subject (left) gets help from the in-camera D-Lighting filter (right).
Here’s how to apply the filter:
1. Display the Retouch menu and highlight D-Lighting, as shown on the
left in Figure 10-14.
2. Press OK to display thumbnails of your images, as shown on the right
in Figure 10-14.
3. Highlight the image that you want to adjust.
Just press the Multi Selector right or left to scroll the display until your
image is surrounded by the yellow highlight box.

D-Lighting, High

Figure 10-14: Apply the D-Lighting filter via the Retouch menu.
4. Press OK to display the D-
Lighting screen shown in Figure
10-15.
You see a thumbnail of your origi-
nal image on the left side of the
screen; the “after” thumbnail
appears on the right.
5. Select the level of adjustment by
pressing the Multi Selector up or
down.
You get three levels: Low, Normal,
and High. I used High for the
repair to my balloon image.
6. To go forward with the correction, press OK.
The camera makes a copy of your photo, applies the D-Lighting correc-
tion to the copy, and then saves the copy in the JPEG file format, leaving
your original file intact. The filename of the copy begins with the letters
CSC so that you can easily tell that it has been retouched. You also see
the Retouch paintbrush icon on the image display when you view the
picture on the camera monitor.
Note that you can’t apply D-Lighting to an image if you capture the photo
with the Optimize Image feature set to Black-and-White. (See Chapter 6 for
details on Optimize Image.) Nor does D-Lighting work on any pictures to
which you’ve applied the Monochrome filters. (I cover these filters, also on
the Retouch menu, in Chapter 11.) And, as mentioned earlier in this chapter,
you can’t apply any retouching tools to pictures that you’ve cropped using
the Trim command.

Boosting Shadows, Contrast, 
and Saturation Together
Located at the top of the Retouch
menu, the Quick Retouch filter
increases picture contrast and satura-
tion. If your subject is backlit, the filter
also applies a D-Lighting adjustment
to the image to restore some shadow
detail that otherwise might be lost. In
other words, Quick Retouch is like D-
Lighting Plus. Well, sort of, anyway.
Figure 10-16 illustrates the difference
between the two filters. The first
example shows my original, a close-up
shot of a tree bud about to emerge. I
applied the D-Lighting filter to the
second example, which brightened the
darkest areas of the image. In the final
example, I applied the Quick Retouch
filter. Again, shadows got a slight
bump up the brightness scale. But the
filter also increased color saturation
and adjusted the overall image to
expand the tonal range across the
entire brightness spectrum, from very
dark to very bright. In this photo, the
saturation change is most noticeable
in the yellows and reds of the tree
bud. (The sky color may initially
appear to be less saturated, but in
fact, it’s just a brighter hue than 
the original, thanks to the contrast
adjustment.) 
To try the filter out for yourself, high-
light Quick Retouch, as shown on the
left in Figure 10-17, and press OK.
Select the image that you want to
tweak and press OK again to display
the second screen in the figure. As
with the D-Lighting filter, you can
select the level of adjustment you
want to apply by selecting Low,
Normal, or High. Just press the Multi
Selector up or down to change the 
setting. (For my example photos, I

applied both the D-Lighting and Quick Retouch filters at the Normal level.)
Then press OK to finalize the job. As with other filters, the camera creates a
copy of your original, applies the filter to the copy, and then saves the copy
in the JPEG file format.
Figure 10-17: Quick Retouch lightens shadows and also bumps up contrast and saturation.
If you want to tweak colors without also adjusting shadows, check out the
Filter options on the Retouch menu, explained near the end of this chapter.
Also check out Chapter 5, which discusses using flash to provide additional
lighting for outdoor subjects such as the tree bud. In many cases, a little pop
of flash can also enhance a backlit subject.
Note that the same issues related to D-Lighting, spelled out in the preceding
section apply here as well: You can’t apply the Quick Retouch filter to black-
and-white, monochrome, or trimmed images. Additionally, you can’t apply
the Quick Retouch filter to a retouched copy that you created by applying 
the D-Lighting filter, and vice versa. However, you can create two retouched
copies of your original image, applying D-Lighting to one and Quick Retouch
to the other, and then use the Before and After feature to compare the
retouched versions to see which one you prefer. The last section of this 
chapter details the Before and After feature.
Exposure Adjustment with a Levels Filter
Cool as it is, the D-Lighting filter can’t solve all exposure problems. For times
when you need more powerful exposure correction, search your photo soft-
ware for a tool called a Levels filter.
With this filter, found in many photo programs, you can adjust your picture’s
shadows, midtones (areas of medium brightness), and highlights individually.
This setup offers much better results than the basic Brightness/Contrast fil-
ters offered by some entry-level photo editors, which force you to adjust all
289
Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Retouching Tricks

290
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
pixels in your image to the same degree — meaning that if you brighten shad-
ows, your highlights and midtones get the same change, which isn’t always
(or even very often) a good solution. For example, the original image in Figure
10-18 needs its midtones and highlights brightened but its shadows deepened.
Figure 10-18: To create the improved image, I darkened shadows and brightened midtones and 
highlights using a Levels filter.
Figure 10-19 shows you the Levels filter dialog box as it appears in Photoshop
Elements. To open the dialog box, choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels.
Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Wow, that looks way too complicated for
me.” Trust me, though, that this filter is actually pretty easy to use. First,
ignore everything but the graph in the middle of the box, labeled Histogram
in the figure, and the three sliders underneath, labeled Shadows, Midtones,
and Highlights. See? Easier already.
The histogram works just like the one that appears on your camera monitor if
you view your images in Histogram display mode, which I discuss in Chapter 4.
To recap, the horizontal axis of the graph represents the possible brightness
values in an image, ranging from black on the left side to white on the right.
The vertical axis shows you how many pixels fall at a particular bright-
ness value. So if you have a tall spike, you have lots of pixels at that 
brightness value.
Original image
 Adjusted with the Levels filter

Figure 10-19: The Levels filter isn’t nearly as difficult to use as it appears.
To adjust exposure, you simply drag the three sliders underneath the histo-
gram, as follows:
 Darken shadows: Drag the Shadows slider to the right.
 Adjust midtones: Drag the middle slider to the right to darken midtones;
drag it to the left to brighten them.
 Brighten highlights: Drag the Highlights slider to the left.
Note that as you drag the Shadows or Highlights slider, the Midtones slider
also moves in tandem. So you may need to readjust that slider after you set
the other two.
What if your photo needs the opposite correction from the one you can get
from Levels? That is, instead of darkening shadows and brightening high-
lights, you need to brighten shadows and tamp down your highlights? Well,
the D-Lighting filter, explained in the preceding section, brightens shadows. If
that doesn’t do the job or highlights are the issue, both Photoshop Elements
and Photoshop offer a Shadows/Highlights filter that is designed expressly to

correct too-dark shadows and too-bright highlights. (In Elements, the filter is
located on the same menu as the Levels filter.) If you use some other photo
editor, it may offer a similar tool — although the name may be different, so
check the program’s Help system.
Playing with Color
Chapter 7 explains how to use your camera’s White Balance control to ensure
accurate image colors. But even if you play with that setting all day, you may
wind up with image colors that you’d like to tweak just a tad. You can do
some color adjustments via the Filter Effects features on your camera’s
Retouch menu. Highlight Filter Effects, as shown on the left in Figure 10-20
and press OK to display the list of filters, as shown on the right.
Figure 10-20: The Filter Effects menu offers six color-tweaking controls.
You get a total of six color-retouching filters (the seventh filter on the menu,
Cross Screen, is a special-effects filter that you can explore in Chapter 11).
These color-shifting filters work like so:
 Skylight filter: This option is designed to replicate the effects of a tradi-
tional lens filter that reduces the amount of blue in an image. The end
result is a very subtle warming effect.
 Warm filter: This one produces a warming effect that’s a little stronger
than the Skylight filter, but still pretty subtle.
 Three color intensifiers: You can boost reds, greens, or blues individually
by applying these filters. 
 Color Balance: This filter is more complex than the others, enabling you
to adjust colors with more finesse. You can shift colors toward any part
of the color spectrum. For example, you can make colors a little greener
or a lot greener, a lot more yellow or less yellow, and so on.

As an example of the impact of the filters, Figure 10-21 shows you an original
image and three filtered versions. Again, the Skylight and Warm filters are
both very, very subtle; in this image, the effects are most noticeable in the
sky. For the Color Balance image, I shifted colors the opposite direction that
those two filters move the image, opting to increase the amount of blue.
Figure 10-21: Here you see the results of applying the three Filter Effects color adjustments.
In case you’re wondering, the subject of the image was a huge piece of art
created for the Indiana State Fair the year that corn was the celebrated farm
product. The same year, the fair-food people also introduced Deep Fried
Pepsi — I kid you not — but apparently no one felt the need to create any
kind of giant homage to that foodstuff.
Follow these steps to apply the color filters:
1. Display the Retouch menu, highlight Filter Effects, and press OK.
2. Select a filter effect and then press OK to display thumbnails of your
images.

3. Select the photo that you want to retouch.
As always, just press the Multi Selector left and right to scroll the dis-
play until the yellow selection box surrounds the image that you want to
repair.
4. Press OK.
What happens next depends on the filter you selected. For all filters
except the Color Balance filter, you see a full-frame preview of the effect.
For the Color Balance filter, you instead see a screen similar to the one
in Figure 10-22.
5. To apply the
Skylight or Warm

Or press the

you want to cancel
the filter application.
You can’t adjust the
intensity of these
two filters.
6. To apply one of the
color-intensifier 
filters, use the 
Multi Selector to
specify the amount
of color shift and
then press OK.
Just press the Multi Selector up or down to adjust the filter intensity.
7. To apply the Color Balance filter, use the Multi Selector to shift colors
as needed and then press OK.
As you press the Multi Selector, the little black box in the color grid
moves, indicating the direction that you’re shifting your image across
the color spectrum. Press up to make the image more green, press right
to make it more red, and so on.
The three histograms on the right side of the display show you the result-
ing impact on the red, green, and blue brightness values in the image, a
bit of information that’s helpful if you’re an experienced student in the
science of digital imaging. If not, just check the image preview to monitor
your results.
Whichever filter you apply, the camera makes a copy of your corrected image
and saves it in the JPEG file format, giving it a filename that begins with the
letters CSC. When you view the retouched copy on the camera monitor, a
little Retouch icon appears in the top-left corner of the screen.
Figure 10-22: Press the Multi Selector to shift the tiny black
box within the color grid.

Comparing Before and After Images
After you apply a change to an image through the Retouch menu, you can
compare the original and retouched photos side by side on the camera moni-
tor. Here’s how:
1. Display either the original or edited picture in full-frame view, as
shown on the left in Figure 10-23.
Figure 10-23: Display your image and press OK to display this version of the Retouch menu.
See Chapter 4 if you need help with picture playback.
2. Press OK.
A variation of the Retouch menu appears superimposed on the image, as
shown on the right in Figure 10-23.
3. Highlight Before and After and press OK.
Now you see the original image in
the left half of the frame, with the
retouched version on the right,
as shown in Figure 10-24. The
Retouch options you applied
appear at the top of the screen.
If you created multiple retouched
versions of the same original, you
can compare all the versions with
the original. First, press the Multi

Figure 10-24. Now press the 
Multi Selector up and down to
scroll through all the retouched
versions.

When you release the button, you’re returned to Before and After view.
5. To exit Before and After view and return to full-frame playback,

onsider this chapter the literary equivalent of the end of one of
those late-night infomercial offers — the part where the host
exclaims, “But wait! There’s more!”
The ten features covered in these pages fit the category
of “interesting bonus.” They aren’t the sort of features
that drive people to choose one camera over another,
and they may come in handy only for certain users,
on certain occasions. Still, they’re included at no
extra charge with your D60 purchase, so check ’em
out when you have a few spare moments. Who
knows; you may discover that one of these bonus
features is actually a hidden gem that provides just
the solution you need for one of your photography
problems.
Annotate Your Images
Through the Image Comment feature, found on the Setup menu, you can add
text comments to your picture files. Suppose, for example, that you’re traveling
on vacation and visiting a different destination every day. You can annotate all
the pictures you take on a particular outing with the name of the location or
attraction. You can then view the comments either in Nikon ViewNX, which

298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
ships free with your camera, or Capture NX, which you must buy separately.
The comments also appear in some other photo programs that enable you to
view metadata. (You may need to specify via the program preferences that you
want to see all metadata, and not just the basic categories of information.)
Here’s how the Image Comment feature works:
1. Display the Setup menu and highlight Image Comment, as shown on

Customizing Camera Menus
On the Setup menu, the first item is called CSM/Setup menu. The CSM part
stands for Custom Setup Menu. Through this option, you can customize the
camera menus.
In Chapter 1, I advise you to set this option to Full so that you can access the
entire assortment of menu items while reading this book; at the default setting,
Simple, some items are hidden from view. After getting to know your camera,
though, you may find that you have no use for some menu items. For example,
the Playback menu contains an option that enables you to establish a print
order for a direct printing option called DPOF, which I cover in Chapter 9. If
your printer doesn’t support DPOF printing, that command does you no good.
To customize your menus, follow these steps:
1. Display the Setup menu and highlight CSM/Setup Menu, as shown on
the left in Figure 11-5.
2. Press OK to display the three options shown on the right in Figure 11-5.
Image Comment

Figure 11-5: The CSM/Setup option enables you to hide or display selected menu items.
3. Highlight My Menu and press the Multi Selector right.
Now you see a list of all camera menus, as shown on the left in Figure 11-6.
4. Highlight the menu that you want to customize and press the Multi
Selector right.
Now you see a list of all options on that menu, with a box next to each
item, as shown on the right in Figure 11-6. A check mark in a box indi-
cates that the item is currently displayed on the menu.
5. Highlight a menu item and then press the Multi Selector right to
toggle its display check mark on and off.
6. When you finish marking or unmarking check boxes, highlight Done
and press OK.
You’re returned to the list of menus (as shown on the left in Figure 11-6).
To edit another menu, just repeat Steps 4-6.
7. When you finish customizing all menus, highlight Done in the main
menu list.
(Again, that’s the one on the left in Figure 11-6.)

8. Press OK.
Now your menus show you only the items you deemed important.
To return to the default menu setup, choose Simple in Step 3. Or to return to
the complete menu listings, choose Full. Then press OK to apply the change.
Creating Custom Image Folders
By default, your camera initially stores all your images in one folder, which it
names 100NCD60. Folders have a storage limit of 999 images; when you
exceed that number, the camera creates a new folder, assigning a name that
indicates the folder number — 101NCD60, 102NCD60, and so on.
If you choose, however, you can create your own, custom-named folders. For
example, perhaps you sometimes use your camera for business and some-
times for personal use. To keep your images separate, you can set up one
folder named DULL and one named FUN — or perhaps something less incrim-
inating, such as WORK and HOME.
Whatever your folder-naming idea, you create custom folders like so:
1. Display the Setup menu and highlight Folders, as shown on the left in
Figure 11-7.
This option appears on the menu only if you first set the CSM/Setup
option at the top of the Setup menu (not shown in the figure) to Full.
2. Press OK to display the screen shown on the right in Figure 11-7.
3. Highlight New and press the Multi Selector right.
You see a keyboard-style screen similar to the one used to create image
comments, as described at the start of the chapter. The folder-naming
version appears in Figure 11-8.
Figure 11-7: You can create custom folders to organize your images right on the camera.

4. Enter a folder name up to 5
characters long.
Use these techniques:
• To enter a letter, highlight it
by using the Multi Selector.
Then press OK.
• To move the text cursor,
rotate the Command dial.
• To delete a letter, rotate the
Command dial to move the
cursor under that letter.
Then press the Delete
button on the camera back.
5. After creating your folder name, press the Zoom button to complete
the process and return to the Setup menu.
If you take advantage of this option, you must remember to specify where
you want your pictures stored each time you shoot. To do so, display the
Setup menu, highlight Folders, and press OK to display the screen shown on
the left in Figure 11-9. Highlight Select Folder and press the Multi Selector
right to display a list of all your folders, as shown on the right in Figure 11-9.
Highlight the folder that you want to use and then press OK.
Figure 11-9: Remember to specify where you want to store new images.
Your choice also affects which images you can view in Playback mode. By
default, the camera displays only the images in the currently selected folder,
which is shown in the Playback Folder area of the Playback menu, as shown on
the left in Figure 11-10. To view images in all folders instead, highlight Playback
Folder and press OK to display the screen shown on the right in the figure.
Select All and press OK again. (This step isn’t necessary unless you create
custom folders; the camera automatically displays all images if you stick with
the default folder-naming scheme, even if the card contains multiple folders.)

Figure 11-10: To view pictures in all folders, change the Playback Folder option to All.
If necessary, you can rename a custom folder by returning to the Setup menu.
Select the Folders option and then select Rename. (See the left image in
Figure 11-9.) The Delete option on the same screen enables you to get rid of
all empty folders on the memory card.
Changing the Function Button’s Function
When your camera ships from the
Nikon factory, the Function button
on the side of the camera, high-
lighted in Figure 11-11, is set up to
provide you with a shortcut to the
self-timer feature. Just press the
button, and the camera shifts into
self-timer mode. (I discuss self-timer
shooting in Chapter 2.)
However, you can change this
behavior so that the Function button
instead provides quick access to one
of these other settings:
 Release mode: The Release
mode setting controls whether
the camera is set to single-
frame shooting, continuous
capture, self-timer mode, or
remote-control mode. Again,
Chapter 2 covers these options.
 Image Quality and Image Size:
These settings affect the file
format (JPEG or NEF), the JPEG quality, and the image pixel count, or
resolution. Chapter 3 contains details on these issues.
Figure 11-11: You can change the feature that’s
activated by the Function button.

 ISO Sensitivity: This setting adjusts the sensitivity of the camera’s image
sensor, making it more or less responsive to light. Chapter 5 fully
explains the impact of ISO.
 White Balance: This control, covered in Chapter 6, is designed to ensure
accurate colors in any light source.
If you set the Function button to any of these four options, you change the
selected setting by rotating the Command dial as you press the button. You
monitor the setting adjustment in the Shooting Info display, introduced in
Chapter 1.
To select the setting that you want the Function button to control, take these
steps:
1. Display the Setup menu and make sure that the CSM/Setup option is
set to Full.
Otherwise, you can’t access the Function button adjustment.
2. Now display the Custom Setting menu and highlight the Fn Button
option, as shown on the left in Figure 11-12.
3. Press OK to display the options shown on the right in Figure 11-12.
You see the four options described in the preceding list, plus the default
Self-Timer option.
4. Highlight your choice and press OK.
If you choose any option but Self-Timer, the letters Fn appear next to the
control in the Quick Settings display to remind you which option can be
adjusted by rotating the Command dial while pressing the Function
button. To find out how to use the Quick Settings display, head for
Chapter 1. (Note that the Fn marker doesn’t appear in the Shooting Info
screen, only in the Quick Settings display.)

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Limiting the AE-L/AF-L Button’s Impact
Set just to the right of the viewfinder,
as shown in Figure 11-13, the AE-L/
AF-L button enables you to lock
focus and exposure settings when
you shoot in autoexposure and
autofocus modes, as explored in
Chapters 5 and 6. 
Normally, focus and exposure are
locked when you press the button
and remain locked as long as you
keep your finger on the button. But
you can change the button’s behav-
ior. To access the available options,
take these steps:
1. Open the Setup menu and
ensure that the CSM/Setup
option is set to Full.
As with the Function button control, the AE-L/AF-L button control is
available only if you set the CSM/Setup option to Full.
2. Display the Custom Setting menu and highlight AE-L/AF-L, as shown
on the left in Figure 11-14.
3. Press OK to display the options screen shown on the right in 
Figure 11-14.
The options produce these results:
• AE/AF Lock: This is the default setting. Focus and exposure remain
locked as long as you press the button.
• AE Lock Only: Exposure is locked as long as you press the button;
autofocus isn’t affected. (You can still lock focus by pressing the
shutter button halfway.)
• AF Lock Only: Focus remains locked as long as you press the
button. Exposure isn’t affected.
• AE Lock Hold: This one locks exposure only with a single press of
the button. The exposure lock remains in force until you press the
button again or the exposure meters turn off.
• AF-ON: Pressing the button activates the camera’s autofocus mech-
anism. If you choose this option, you can’t lock autofocus by press-
ing the shutter button halfway.
4. Highlight your choice and press OK.
Autoexposure/autofocus lock
Figure 11-13: You can adjust the function of the
AE-L/AF-L button, too.

Figure 11-14: You get four button options in addition to the default setting.
The information that I give in this book with regard to using autofocus and
autoexposure assumes that you stick with the default setting. So if you change
the button’s function, remember to amend my instructions accordingly.
On a related note, all my instructions also assume that the AE Lock function,
found on the Custom Setting menu, is set to its default, which is Off. At that
setting, pressing the shutter button halfway locks focus but not exposure. If
you turn the feature on, your half-press of the shutter button locks both
focus and exposure. 
Changing the Shooting Info Display Style
When you’re first learning about photography, using the Shooting Info design
that you see throughout this book and in the top-right example in Figure 11-15
can be helpful: The large gold circle on the left side of the screen is a graphi-
cal representation of the aperture and is designed to help you remember the
relationship between the f-stop setting and the size of the aperture opening.
As you choose a higher f-stop number, the circle shrinks to indicate that
you’re reducing the size of the aperture opening. (If the word aperture is new
to you, Chapter 5 explains it.)
After you have that concept down cold, however, you may want to see
whether one of the other two display styles suits you better. You can change
to the Classic style or Wallpaper style, both also shown in Figure 11-15. With
Wallpaper style, you can display the shooting data against a default sky
image already stored in the camera or against one of your own images. My
personal favorite is Classic, though, because the size of some of the display
data is larger, making it easier to read.
307
Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day

308
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Figure 11-15: You can choose from three designs for the Shooting Info display.
Whatever your choice, follow this path to change the display style:
1. Display the Setup menu and highlight Info Display Format, as shown
on the left in Figure 11-16.
2. Press OK to reveal the options shown on the right in the figure.
The first two options enable you to choose the shooting modes that you
want to affect with your change. You can specify a different display for
the Digital Vari-Program exposure modes (and Auto mode) than for P, S,
A, or M exposure modes.
3. Highlight one of the exposure mode options and press the Multi
Selector right.
Now you see a screen listing the three display styles: Classic, Graphic,
and Wallpaper.
4. Highlight your preferred display style and press the Multi Selector right.
Now you’re taken to a screen where you can choose from a few other
options.
Classic
Graphic
Wallpaper

5. If you selected Graphic or Classic, choose one of the three available
background colors and press OK.
You’re returned to the screen shown on the right in Figure 11-16. 
6. If you selected Wallpaper, choose a type scheme and then select your
wallpaper image.
First, specify whether you want light type with a dark outline or vice
versa. Press OK to return to the main Info Display Format screen, shown
on the right in Figure 11-16. 
Next, highlight Select Wallpaper and press the Multi Selector right. You
see thumbnails of your images. Scroll the display (press the Multi
Selector right and left) until the image you want to use is surrounded by
the yellow box. Then press OK to select that image.
The camera saves a copy of your wallpaper image and stores it inter-
nally so that the wallpaper isn’t stripped when you remove your
memory card. If you later choose a new wallpaper image, the old one is
deleted from the camera’s internal memory.
7. Repeat Steps 3 through 6 to set the display style for the other expo-
sure mode.
Figure 11-16: And you can choose a different style for different shooting modes.
Controlling Flash Output Manually
By default, your camera automatically adjusts the output of its built-in flash
based on the ambient light so that you wind up with a proper exposure. But if
you’re experienced in the way of the flash, you do have the option of manu-
ally setting the flash output.
To take advantage of this option, you must use one of the advanced exposure
modes (P, S, A, or M). After setting the camera to one of those modes, open the
Custom Setting menu, highlight the Built-In Flash option, and then press OK.
(The control is available only if you first set the CSM/Setup option on the Setup
menu to Full.) You see the screen shown on the left in Figure 11-17. Then
309
Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day

310
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
change the setting from TTL (which stands for through the lens) to Manual.
Press OK to display the available flash-power settings, as shown on the right in
Figure 11-17. Highlight the power you want and press OK.
Adjusting flash power this way is a little cumbersome and, again, requires
some lighting expertise to use properly. So remember that you can also keep
the flash in auto mode (TTL mode) and then use the Flash Compensation
control to bump the flash power up or down a few notches from what the
camera’s metering system thinks is appropriate. See Chapter 5 for details.
Figure 11-17: For experienced flash photographers, the camera offers manual control over
flash output.
Combining Two Photos with Image Overlay
Found on the Retouch menu, the Image Overlay feature enables you to merge
two photographs into one, creating the digital equivalent of a multiple expo-
sure. I used the feature to combine a photo of a werewolf friend, shown on the
top left in Figure 11-18, with a nighttime garden scene, shown on the top right.
The result is the ghostly image shown beneath the two originals. Oooh, scary!
On a more serious note, some photographers use this feature when trying to
capture a scene that has both very dark and very bright areas, such as a sunset
scene. They take two shots of the same scene, exposing one for the highlights
and one for the shadows. Then they combine the two images to produce a
composite that contains more shadow and highlight detail than would be pos-
sible with a single exposure. For this technique to work, however, you must use
a tripod and manual focusing so that the only difference between the two
images is exposure. Otherwise, the photos won’t blend seamlessly.
Additionally, the Image Overlay feature works only with pictures that you
shoot in the Camera Raw (NEF) format. For details on Raw, see Chapter 3.
The resulting image is also created in the Raw format, which means that you
have to use a Raw processor to convert it into an actual image file before you
can print or share it. Chapter 8 has details on that issue.

Figure 11-18: Image Overlay merges two Raw (NEF) photos into one.
To be honest, I don’t use Image Overlay for the purpose of serious photo com-
positing, however. I prefer to do this kind of work in my photo editing software,
where I have more control over the blend. In addition, previewing the results of
the overlay settings you use is difficult given the size of the camera monitor.
That said, it’s a fun project to try, so give it a go when you have a spare
minute. Take these steps:
1. Display the Retouch menu, highlight Image Overlay, and press OK.
You see the screen shown on the left in Figure 11-19, with the preview
area for Image 1 highlighted. (The yellow border indicates the active pre-
view area.)
2. Press OK to display thumbnails of your images.
3. Select the first of the two images that you want to combine.
A yellow border surrounds the currently selected thumbnail. Press the
Multi Selector right and left to scroll the display until the border appears
around your chosen image. Then press OK.
The Image Overlay screen now displays your first image as Image 1.

Figure 11-19: Preview the overlay image by pressing the Zoom button.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to select the second image.
Now you see both images in the Image Overlay screen, with the combined
result appearing in the Preview area, as shown on the right in Figure 11-19.
5. Press the Multi Selector right to move the yellow selection box over
the Preview thumbnail.
6. In the Preview thumbnail area, highlight Overlay and press OK to get
a full-frame view of the merged image.
If you aren’t happy with the result, press the Thumbnail button to exit
the preview. Then adjust the gain setting underneath the image thumb-
nails to manipulate the combined image. Press the Multi Selector right
or left to highlight Image 1 or Image 2 and then press up or down to
adjust the gain for that image. To see the results of your adjustment in
full-frame view, just highlight Overlay and press OK again. Press the
Thumbnail button to exit the full-frame preview.
7. To save the merged image, highlight Save (in the Preview thumbnail
area) and press OK.
Again, the combined image is created in the Camera Raw (NEF) format. 
Creating Monochrome Images
The D60 enables you to either shoot black-and-white images, by using the
Optimize Image feature, or turn an existing color image to black-and-white by
applying the Monochrome option on the Retouch menu. You can also create
sepia and cyanotype (blue and white) images via the Monochrome option.
Figure 11-20 shows you examples of all three effects.

Figure 11-20: You can create three monochrome effects through the Retouch menu.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
I prefer to always shoot in color and then create black-and-white copies or
apply other color effects in my photo editor. Going that route simply gives
you more control, not to mention the fact that it’s easier to preview your
results on a large computer monitor than on the camera monitor. Still, I know
that not everyone’s as much of a photo editing geek as I am, so I present to
you here the steps involved in applying the Monochrome effects to a color
original in your camera:
1. Display the Retouch menu and highlight Monochrome, as shown on
the left in Figure 11-21.
Figure 11-21: Select a filter and press OK to start the process. 
2. Press OK to display the three effect options, as shown on the right in
the figure.
3. Highlight the effect that you want to apply and press OK.
The monitor now displays thumbnails of your images.
4. Select your photo.
Take the usual tack here: Press the Multi Selector right or left to scroll
through your thumbnails until the yellow border surrounds the image
that you want to select. Then press OK.
You then see a full-frame preview of the image with your selected photo
filter applied, as shown in Figure 11-22.
5. To adjust the intensity of the sepia or cyanotype effect, press the Multi
Selector up or down.
No adjustment is available for the black-and-white filter.
6. To save a copy of the image with the filter applied, press OK.
The camera creates your copy, stores it in the JPEG file format, and
assigns a filename that begins with the letters CSC. When you view the
image on the camera monitor, the little Retouch icon — a tiny paint-
brush symbol — appears at the top of the screen.

Figure 11-22: Press the Multi Selector up or down to adjust
the intensity of the color filters.
Adding a Starburst Effect
Want to give your photo a little extra sparkle? Experiment with your D60’s
Cross Screen filter. This filter adds a starburst-like effect to the brightest
areas of your image, as illustrated in Figure 11-23.
Figure 11-23: The Cross Filter option on the Retouch menu adds a starburst effect.
315
Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day

316
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Traditional photographers create this effect by placing a special filter over
the camera lens; the filter is sometimes known as a Star filter instead of a
Cross Screen filter. With your D60, you apply it to an existing image, via the
Retouch menu, as follows:
1. Display the Retouch menu, highlight Filter Effects, as shown on the
left in Figure 11-24, and press OK.
You see the list of available filters. (For details about the color filters,
see Chapter 10.)
2. Highlight Cross Filter, as shown on the right in Figure 11-24, and 
press OK.
Figure 11-24: The Cross Filter effect is grouped with the color filters.
You’re presented with thumbnails of the images on your camera
memory card.
3. Select the image to which you want to add the star effect and press OK.
Just press the Multi Selector to move the yellow highlight box around
the image. After you press OK, you see the screen shown in Figure 11-25.
The preview shows you the results of the Cross Screen filter at the cur-
rent filter settings.
4. Adjust the filter settings as needed.
You can adjust the number of points on the star, the strength of the
effect, the length of the star’s rays, and the angle of the effect. Just use
the Multi Selector to highlight an option and then press the Multi
Selector right to display the available settings. Highlight your choice
and press OK. I labeled the four options in Figure 11-25.

Figure 11-25: You can play with four filter settings to tweak the effect.
To update the preview, highlight Confirm and press OK. 
You can also press and hold the Zoom button to temporarily view your
image in full-screen view. Release the button to return to the normal pre-
view display.
5. Highlight Save and press OK to create your star-crossed image.
The camera makes a copy of your original image, applies the Cross Screen
filter to the copy, and then saves the retouched copy in the JPEG format.
The filename begins with the letters CSC to indicate a retouched photo.
Keep in mind that the number of starbursts the filter applies depends on
your image. You can’t change that number; the camera automatically adds
the twinkle effect wherever it finds very bright objects. If you want to control
the exact placement of the starbursts, you may want to forgo the in-camera
filter and find out whether your photo software offers a more flexible star-
filter effect. (You can also create the effect “manually” by painting the cross
strokes onto the image in your photo editor.)

F
irmware is the internal software that runs your camera. On occasion, the
camera manufacturer updates this software, either to fix recently discov-
ered problems or to enable minor new features. You can find out which
firmware version your camera is running via the Setup menu, as explained 
in the next section.
Speaking of menus, the second part of this appendix provides a handy summary
of all the commands on the Setup menu, as well as the other four camera
menus. For each menu option, I provide a quick description and, where rele-
vant, a cross-reference to the chapter where you can find any additional details.
Firmware Facts
Keeping your camera’s firmware current can help you avoid problems down
the road, so periodically visit the Nikon Web site to find out whether any
updates have been posted. Start from the Nikon home page (www.nikon.com)
and just follow the product support links to the firmware updates. (The actual
link names vary depending on which of Nikon’s international sites you use.)
To check your firmware version, follow these steps:
1. Display the Setup menu.
2. Highlight Firmware Version, as shown on the left in Figure A-1, and
press OK.
If you don’t see the Firmware Version item, scroll to the top of the menu
and set the CSM/Setup menu option to Full. Some menu items are hidden
until you take that step.
3. Press OK.
You see a screen similar to the one on the right in Figure A-1, with both
an A and B firmware file number shown.

Nikon D60 For Dummies 
At the time I write this, the current firmware version number for both A and B
is 1.00, as shown in the figure. If a check of the Nikon site uncovers an even
more recent version than 1.00, follow the instructions on the firmware 
download site to update your camera. These instructions vary depending on
your computer operating system and the firmware release itself, and because
the instructions on the Nikon site are very detailed, I won’t waste space
repeating them to you here.
Figure A-1: Check your firmware version via the Setup menu.
Menu Quick Reference
To help you locate all the features on your D60, the following sections list the
options found on each of the camera’s five menus. Chapter 1 details the
process of using menus, if you need help.
The settings shown for the menu items here may or may not be the best
choice, depending on your subject and other photographic conditions. So
visit the chapters referenced in the table for details that will help you lock
in the right settings.
The Playback menu
Shown in Figure A-2 and detailed in
Table A-1, this menu contains options
related to picture playback but also
contains controls for deleting, protect-
ing, and printing images.

The Shooting Menu
Menu Option
Choose This Option To . . . 
Optimize Image1
Apply preset adjustments to image sharpness, contrast, and
color or create a custom setting that applies your own
adjustments to sharpness, contrast, color mode (Adobe RGB
or sRGB), saturation, and hue. See Chapter 6.
Image Quality
Choose the image file format. Select from three JPEG set-
tings (Fine, Normal, and Basic); NEF (Raw); or NEF (Raw) +
JPEG Basic. For the best image quality, choose JPEG Fine or
NEF (Raw). See Chapter 3 for details.
Image Size
Set the image resolution (number of pixels). See Chapter 3
for help deciding what resolution you need.
White Balance1
Eliminate unwanted color cast caused by a particular light
source. Chapter 6 explains.
ISO Sensitivity
Adjust the light sensitivity of the camera’s image sensor so
that you can capture an image with less light. Choosing a
higher ISO setting increases sensitivity but can produce
noise. Chapter 5 tells all.
Noise Reduction
Apply a filter to reduce the appearance of noise in images
shot at a high ISO or with a slow shutter speed. Some soft-
ening of image sharpness may result. See Chapter 5.
Active D-Lighting
Enable or disable Active D-Lighting, a feature that can help
produce better exposure results when you shoot high-con-
trast subjects. Chapter 5 covers this feature.
1Available only in P, S, A, and M exposure modes.
The Custom Setting menu
This lengthy menu, the first page of
which is shown in Figure A-4, contains
options that enable you to customize
various aspects of your camera’s basic
operation as well as adjust some
advanced picture-taking options. Table
A-3 describes the function of each
option.
Figure A-4: Some options on this menu are
hidden by default.

By default, many of this menu’s options are hidden, as indicated in the table.
To display them, you must change the CSM/Setup menu option on the Setup
menu (explained in the next section) to Full.
Table A-3
The Custom Setting Menu
Menu Option
Choose This Option To . . . 
Reset
Reset all options on this menu to their default settings. See
Chapter 1 for other ways to restore default settings.
Beep
Enable or disable the beep that the camera emits during some
autofocus operations and when you use self-timer mode and
some remote-control modes.
Focus mode
Select from three autofocus modes — AF-A (auto-servo) 
AF-S (single-servo), or AF-C (continuous-servo) — or select
manual focusing (MF). Chapter 6 provides details.
AF-Area mode
Choose from three autofocus options that determine which part of
the frame the camera uses when setting focus: Closest Subject,
Dynamic Area, and Single Point. Chapter 6 covers each option.
Release mode
Choose from Single Frame shooting, to take one picture at a
time; Continuous, to record multiple images with one press of
the shutter button; or Self-Timer, to record the image a few
moments after the shutter button is pressed. Two options are
also provided for adjusting the shutter response if you use the
optional Remote Control unit. See Chapter 2 for details on using
the Release mode option.
Metering1
Choose one of three settings that control what part of the frame
the camera analyzes when determining exposure: Matrix (entire
frame), Center-Weighted (entire frame, but with emphasis to the
middle), or Spot (one of three specific areas selected by the
user). Chapter 5 details these options.
No Memory Card? Specify whether you want the camera to disable the shutter
release when no memory card is inserted. See Chapter 1 for
memory card information.
Image Review2
Control whether images appear automatically on the monitor for
a few seconds after they’re captured. Chapter 1 has details.
Flash 
Adjust the intensity of the built-in flash. See Chapter 5 for more 
Compensation1,2
information.
AF-Assist2,3
Enable or disable the auto-focus assist illuminator, the tiny light
that shoots out from the front of the camera to help the autofo-
cus mechanism find its target in dim lighting. See Chapter 6 for
other autofocus information.

1Not displayed on menu by default; change the CSM/Setup menu option on the Setup menu to Full
to access.

The Retouch menu
This menu, the first screen of which
you can see in Figure A-6, accesses the
camera’s built-in photo-retouching
tools, which you apply to images that
you’ve already taken. In all cases, the
camera creates a copy of the original
image and applies the retouching
effect to the copy only. Table A-5
describes each retouching process.
