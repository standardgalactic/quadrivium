Introduction
CCNA Routing and Switching Practice Tests is a companion volume to the CCNA Routing
and Switching Complete Study Guide, Second Edition. If you’re looking to test your
knowledge before you take the CCNA exam, this book will help you by providing a
combination of 1,500 questions that cover the CCNA objectives.
If you’re just starting to prepare for the CCNA exam, I highly recommend that you use the
CCNA Routing and Switching Complete Study Guide, Second Edition by Todd Lammle
(Sybex, 2016) to help you learn about each of the objectives covered in the CCNA exam.
Once you’re ready to test your knowledge, use this book to help find places where you
may need to study more or to practice for the exam itself.
Since it is a companion to the CCNA Routing and Switching Complete Study Guide,
Second Edition, this book is designed to be similar to taking the CCNA Routing and
Switching exam. It contains scenarios and standard multiple-choice questions similar to
those you may encounter in the certification exam itself. The book contains nine
chapters: seven objective-centric chapters with 140 to 320 questions, weighted by the
objectives, and two chapters that contain 50-question practice tests to simulate taking the
exam itself. The bulk of the questions are in the routing and switching objectives.

Cisco’s Network Certification
It used to be that to secure the holy grail of Cisco certifications—the CCIE—you passed
only one written test before being faced with a grueling, formidable hands-on lab. This
intensely daunting, all-or-nothing approach made it nearly impossible to succeed and
predictably didn’t work out too well for most people. Cisco responded to this issue by
creating a series of new certifications, which not only made it easier to eventually win the
highly coveted CCIE prize, it gave employers a way to accurately rate and measure the
skill levels of prospective and current employees. This exciting paradigm shift in Cisco’s
certification path truly opened doors that few were allowed through before!
Beginning in 1998, obtaining the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification
was the first milestone in the Cisco certification climb, as well as the official prerequisite
to each of the more advanced levels. But that changed in 2007 when Cisco announced the
Cisco Certified Entry Network Technician (CCENT) certification. And then in May 2016,
Cisco once again proclaimed updates to the CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching
(R/S) tests. Now the Cisco certification process looks like Figure I.1.
Cisco Certified Entry Network Technician (CCENT)
Don’t be fooled by the oh-so-misleading name of this first certification because it
absolutely isn’t entry level! Okay—maybe entry level for Cisco’s certification path, but
definitely not for someone without experience trying to break into the highly lucrative yet
challenging IT job market! For the uninitiated, the CompTIA A+ and Network+
certifications aren’t official prerequisites, but know that Cisco does expect you to have
that type and level of experience before embarking on your Cisco certification journey.
All of this gets us to 2017, when the climb to Cisco supremacy got much harder again. The
innocuous-sounding siren’s call of the CCENT can lure you to some serious trouble if
you’re not prepared, because it’s actually much harder than the old CCNA ever was. This
will rapidly become apparent once you start studying, but be encouraged! The fact that
the certification process is getting harder really works better for you in the long run,
because that which is harder to obtain only becomes that much more valuable when you
finally do, right? Yes, indeed!
Another important factor to keep in mind is that the Interconnection Cisco Network
Devices Part 1 (ICND1) exam, which is the required exam for the CCENT certification,
costs $150 per attempt, and it’s anything but easy to pass! However, there is one way to

skip the CCENT exam and still meet the prerequisite before moving on to any other
certification track, and that path is through the CCNA R/S Composite exam. First, I’ll
discuss the Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices Part 2 (ICND2) exam, and then I’ll tell
you about the CCNA Composite exam, which will provide you, when successful, with both
the CCENT and the CCNA R/S certification.
Cisco Certified Network Associate Routing and Switching (CCNA R/S)
Once you have achieved your CCENT certification, you can take the ICND2 (200-105)
exam in order to achieve your CCNA R/S certification, which is the most popular
certification Cisco has by far because it’s the most sought-after certification of all
employers.
As with the CCENT, the ICND2 exam is also $150 per attempt—although thinking you can
just skim a book and pass any of these exams would probably be a really expensive
mistake! The CCENT/CCNA exams are extremely hard and cover a lot of material, so you
have to really know your stuff. Taking a Cisco class or spending months with hands-on
experience is definitely a requirement to succeed when faced with this monster!
And once you have your CCNA, you don’t have to stop there—you can choose to continue
and achieve an even higher certification, called the Cisco Certified Network Professional
(CCNP). There are various ones, as shown in Figure 1.1. The CCNP R/S is still the most
popular, with Voice certifications coming in at a close second. And I’ve got to tell you that
the Data Center certification will be catching up fast. Also good to know is that anyone
with a CCNP R/S has all the skills and knowledge needed to attempt the notoriously
dreaded but coveted CCIE R/S lab. But just becoming a CCNA R/S can land you that job
you’ve dreamed about, and that’s what this book is all about: helping you to get and keep
a great job!
Still, why take two exams to get your CCNA if you don’t have to? Cisco still has the CCNA
Routing and Switching Composite (200-125) exam that, if passed, will land you with your
CCENT and your CCNA R/S via only one test priced at only $295. Some people like the
one-test approach, and some people like the two-test approach. Part of this book covers
the ICND2 exam topics.
Why Become a CCENT and CCNA R/S?
Cisco, like Microsoft and other vendors that provide certification, has created the
certification process to give administrators a set of skills and to equip prospective
employers with a way to measure those skills or match certain criteria. And as you
probably know, becoming a CCNA R/S is certainly the initial, key step on a successful
journey toward a new, highly rewarding, and sustainable networking career.
The CCNA program was created to provide a solid introduction not only to the Cisco
Internetwork Operating System (IOS) and Cisco hardware but also to internetworking in
general, making it helpful to you in areas that are not exclusively Cisco’s. And regarding
today’s certification process, it’s not unrealistic that network managers—even those

without Cisco equipment—require Cisco certifications for their job applicants. Rest
assured that if you make it through the CCNA and are still interested in Cisco and
internetworking, you’re headed down a path to certain success!
What Skills Do You Need to Become a CCNA R/S?
This ICND1 exam (100-105) tests a candidate for the knowledge and skills required to
successfully install, operate, and troubleshoot a small branch office network. The exam
includes questions on the operation of IP data networks, LAN switching technologies,
IPv6, IP routing technologies, IP services, network device security, and basic
troubleshooting. The ICND2 exam (200-105) tests a candidate for the knowledge and
skills required to successfully install, operate, and troubleshoot a small- to medium-size
enterprise branch network. The exam includes questions on LAN switching technologies,
IP routing technologies, security, troubleshooting, and WAN technologies.
How Do You Become a CCNA R/S
If you want to go straight for your CCNA R/S and take only one exam, all you have to do is
pass the CCNA Composite exam (200-125). Oh, but don’t you wish it were that easy?
True, it’s just one test, but it’s a whopper, and to pass it you must possess enough
knowledge to understand what the test writers are saying, and you need to know
everything I mentioned previously, in the sections on the ICND1 and ICND2 exams! Hey,
it’s hard, but it can be done!
What does the CCNA Composite exam (200-125) cover? Pretty much the same topics
covered in the ICND1 and ICND2 exams. Exam 200-125 tests a candidate’s knowledge and
skills required to install, operate, and troubleshoot a small to medium-size enterprise
branch network.
While you can take the Composite exam to get your CCNA, it’s good to know that Cisco
offers the two-step process I discussed earlier in this introduction. And this book covers
both those exams too! It may be easier than taking that one ginormous exam for you, but
don’t think the two-test method is easy. It takes work! However, it can be done; you just
need to stick with your studies.
The two-test method involves passing the following:
Exam 100-105: Interconnecting Cisco Networking Devices Part 1 (ICND1)
Exam 200-105: Interconnecting Cisco Networking Devices Part 2 (ICND2)

Where Do You Take the Exams?
You may take the ICND1, ICND2, or CCNA R/S Composite or any Cisco exam at any of the
Pearson VUE authorized testing centers. For information, check www.vue.com or call
877-404-EXAM (3926).
To register for a Cisco exam, follow these steps:
1. Determine the number of the exam you want to take. (The ICND1 exam number is
100-105, ICND2 is 100-205, and CCNA R/S Composite is 200-125.)
2. Register with the nearest Pearson VUE testing center. At this point, you will be asked
to pay in advance for the exam. At the time of this writing, the ICND1 and ICND2
exams are $150 each, and the CCNA R/S Composite exam is $295. The exams must be
taken within one year of payment. You can schedule exams up to six weeks in advance
or as late as the day you want to take it—but if you fail a Cisco exam, you must wait
five days before you will be allowed to retake it. If something comes up and you need
to cancel or reschedule your exam appointment, contact Pearson VUE at least 24
hours in advance.
3. When you schedule the exam, you’ll get instructions regarding all appointment and
cancellation procedures, the ID requirements, and information about the testing-
center location.
Tips for Taking Your Cisco Exams
The Cisco exams contain about 40–50 questions and must be completed in about 90
minutes or less. This information can change per exam. You must get a score of about 85
percent to pass this exam, but again, each exam can be different.
Many questions on the exam have answer choices that at first glance look identical,
especially the syntax questions! So remember to read through the choices carefully
because close just doesn’t cut it. If you get commands in the wrong order or forget one
measly character, you’ll get the question wrong. So, to practice, do the hands-on exercises
at the end of this book’s chapters over and over again until they feel natural to you.
Also, never forget that the right answer is the Cisco answer. In many cases, more than one
appropriate answer is presented, but the correct answer is the one that Cisco
recommends. On the exam, you will always be told to pick one, two, or three options,
never “choose all that apply.” The Cisco exam may include the following test formats:
Multiple-choice single answer
Multiple-choice multiple answers
Drag-and-drop
Router simulations
Cisco proctored exams will not show the steps to follow in completing a router interface

configuration, but they do allow partial command responses. For example, show run, sho
running, or sh running-config would be acceptable.
Here are some general tips for exam success:
Arrive early at the exam center so you can relax and review your study materials.
Read the questions carefully. Don’t jump to conclusions. Make sure you’re clear about
exactly what each question asks. “Read twice, answer once,” is what I always tell my
students.
When answering multiple-choice questions that you’re not sure about, use the process
of elimination to get rid of the obviously incorrect answers first. Doing this greatly
improves your odds if you need to make an educated guess.
You can no longer move forward and backward through the Cisco exams, so double-
check your answer before clicking Next since you can’t change your mind.
After you complete an exam, you’ll get immediate, online notification of your pass or fail
status, a printed examination score report that indicates your pass or fail status, and your
exam results by section. (The test administrator will give you the printed score report.)
Test scores are automatically forwarded to Cisco within five working days after you take
the test, so you don’t need to send your score to them. If you pass the exam, you’ll receive
confirmation from Cisco, typically within two to four weeks, sometimes a bit longer.

Using This Book to Practice
This book is composed of nine chapters. Each of the first seven chapters covers a domain,
with a variety of questions that can help you test your knowledge of real-world, scenario,
and best practices–based networking knowledge. The final two chapters are complete
practice exams that can serve as timed practice tests to help determine if you’re ready for
the CCNA exam.
I recommend taking the first practice exam to help identify where you may need to spend
more study time, and then using the domain-specific chapters to test your domain
knowledge where it is weak. Once you’re ready, take the second practice exam to make
sure you’ve covered all of the material and are ready to attempt the CCNA exam.
The book is separated into nine chapters, seven chapters to reflect the major objectives
and two chapters with practice tests:
Chapter 1: Network Fundamentals (Domain 1)
Chapter 2: LAN Switching Technologies (Domain 2)
Chapter 3: Routing Technologies (Domain 3)
Chapter 4: WAN Technologies (Domain 4)
Chapter 5: Infrastructure Services (Domain 5)
Chapter 6: Infrastructure Security (Domain 6)
Chapter 7: Infrastructure Management (Domain 7)
Chapter 8: Practice Test 1
Chapter 9: Practice Test 2

Appendix
Answers to Review Questions

Chapter 1: Network Fundamentals (Domain 1)
1. D. The OSI reference model was created to divide the network communication
process into smaller components for standardization, design, and troubleshooting
purposes. It also allows for a nonproprietary standardization of components and
prevents a change at one layer from affecting other layers.
2. A. The Presentation layer is responsible for encryption and decryption. Web servers
use SSL to encrypt data and the client uses SSL to decrypt the data. SSL processing for
both server and client is done at the Presentation layer.
3. D. Switches primarily function at the Data Link layer. They inspect frames to direct
traffic to the appropriate port by employing source MAC address learning and
forward/filter decisions.
4. C. A simple way of remembering the order of the OSI layers is with a mnemonic
such as All People Seem To Need Drinking Parties or All People Seem To Need Data
Processing.
5. B. The Network layer is responsible for logical addressing. Routers use logical
addressing for path determination to remote networks the same way the post office
uses zip codes and street addresses to route mail.
6. A. Connection-oriented communication happens at the Transport layer with TCP.
TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection. Once it is established,
sequences and acknowledgments make sure that data is delivered. Both server and
client have a virtual circuit during the establishment.
7. D. The Presentation layer is responsible for compression and decompression.
Compression methods can be MP3, JPG, and ZIP, which reduce the number of bits
that need to be transmitted over the network. Often web servers use gzip to speed up
page delivery. One end compresses and the other end decompresses the data.
8. C. Applications are found in the upper three layers and dialog control is found in the
session layer. An example of dialog control is how an application such as instant
messaging sends messages with half-duplex conversations like a walkie-talkie.
9. B. DTE and DCE interfaces are defined at the Physical layer. The original interfaces
referred to computers and modems, respectively. However, today the DTE and DCE
interfaces define the equipment such as hosts and switches, respectively.
10. B. Telnet, TFTP, SNMP, and SMTP all function at the Process/Application layer
according to the DoD model. The Process/Application layer is a macro layer combining
the Application, Presentation, and Session layers of the OSI model.
11. A. Since SNMP is an application, if it returns back successfully, then we can
conclude that the Application layer on the client successfully made a connection to the
Application layer on the server.

12. B. The Data Link layer is responsible for checking the FCS, or Frame Checking
Sequence, which is a checksum of the frame. This occurs on the MAC sublayer of the
Data Link layer.
13. C. The Internet layer of the DoD model maps to the Network layer of the OSI
model. The Network layer is where routing occurs.
14. D. Switches create collision domains by isolating the possibility of a collision to the
segment it is transmitting to or receiving frames from. This in turn raises effective
bandwidth for the rest of the segments.
15. B. A hub is a multiport repeater. When a hub receives a frame, it will repeat the
frame on all other ports, regardless of whether or not the port is the destination host.
16. D. The segment PDU is found at the Transport layer of the OSI. TCP/IP comprises
two protocols at this layer: TCP and UDP, which create segments.
17. C. A router will stop broadcasts by default. If you add a router to a flat network,
which is a single broadcast domain, you effectively raise bandwidth by reducing the
number of broadcasts.
18. D. When the Individual/Group (I/G) high order bit is set to 1, the frame is a
broadcast or a multicast transmission. The OUI assigned by the IEEE is only partially
responsible for MAC uniqueness. The vendor is responsible for the last 24 bits of a
MAC address.
19. B. Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) is a contention
method that allows multiple devices to share the access media and detect collisions of
frames.
20. C. The correct order of encapsulation starting with the Application layer is user
datagrams, segments, packets, frames, and bits.
21. B. Telnet is used for terminal emulation over a network to a device expecting
terminal emulation, such as a router or switch.
22. A. Logical Link Control (LLC) is responsible for identifying network protocols at
the Data Link layer. This allows the Data Link layer to forward the packet to the
appropriate upper-layer protocol.
23. C. The Presentation layer is responsible for translation such as ASCII to EBCDIC.
All translation, encryption/decryption, and compression/decompression happens at
the Presentation layer.
24. C. Broadcasts, multicasts, and multiple hubs for connectivity are all common
causes of LAN congestion. Adding switches for connectivity has no direct relationship
to LAN congestion, since switches create collision domains and raise effective
bandwidth.
25. A. The Transport layer is responsible for flow control via the TCP/IP protocols of
TCP and UDP.

26. C. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) does not guarantee segments are delivered.
Therefore, the programmer must account for segments that are never received or out
of order.
27. D. TCP is a connection-based protocol via the three-way handshake. It is not faster
than UDP. However, it allows for the retransmission of lost segments because of
sequences and acknowledgments.
28. A. The sender allocates a port dynamically above 1024 and associates it with the
request through a process called a handle. This way if a web browser creates three
requests for three different web pages, the pages are loaded to their respective
windows.
29. D. The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) uses TCP port 25 to send mail.
30. D. TCP guarantees delivery of segments with sequence and acknowledgment
numbers. At the Transport layer, each segment is given a sequence number that is
acknowledged by the receiver.
31. A. When a programmer decides to use UDP, it is normally because the programmer
is sequencing and acknowledging datagrams already. The redundancy of
acknowledgments at the Transport layer is not needed.
32. B. When a daemon or server process starts, it binds to a port number on which to
listen for a request. An example is when a web server binds to the port number of
TCP/80.
33. A. The window size, which is a buffer, is established and agreed upon by the sender
and receiver during the three-way handshake.
34. C. DNS requests are usually small and do not require the overhead of sequence
and acknowledgment of TCP. If a segment is dropped, the DNS protocol will ask again.
35. A. A three-way handshake is required between sender and receiver before TCP can
begin sending traffic. During this three-way handshake, the sender’s window buffer
size is synchronized with the receiver’s window buffer size.
36. C. When more than one WAP covers the same SSID, it is called an extended service
set (ESS). A wireless LAN (WLAN) controller coordinates the cell or coverage area so
the same SSID is on two different channels.
37. D. Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points is a protocol that’s
responsible for provisioning of LWAPs and forwarding of data to the wireless LAN
controller.
38. C. The wireless LAN controller (WLC) is responsible for centralized authentication
of users and/or computers on a wireless network. When a wireless device is roaming,
the WLC is responsible for maintaining the authentication between access points.
39. A. Centralized authentication of clients is a valid reason to implement a WLC.
Although a WLC makes it easier to implement multiple SSIDs and VLANs, this task

can be performed with autonomous WAPs, each performing its own authentication.
40. B. To achieve density and/or bandwidth in a relatively small area, you will need to
deploy lightweight WAPs with a WLC. Although autonomous WAPs without a WLC
would work, it would be problematic due to frequency coordination and roaming.
41. C. The 5 GHz band for 802.11 a/n/ac has 24 non-overlapping channels. The 2.4
GHz band for 802.11 b/g/n has only 3 non-overlapping channels. If the clients are
compatible with 802.11 a/n/ac, it is desirable to use 5 GHz.
42. D. A wireless LAN controller keeps track of which LWAP a client has associated to
and centrally forwards the packets to the appropriate LWAP.
43. C. In the 2.4 GHz spectrum for 802.11, there are three non-overlapping channels—
1, 6, and 11, each of which is 22 MHz wide. Although channel 14 technically is non-
overlapping, it is only allowed in Japan.
44. B. When WAPs are introduced to the wireless LAN controller, the WLC is
responsible for synchronizing the WAPs to a standardized IOS. This allows for
uniform support and features of the wireless system and is dependent on the model of
WAP.
45. A. 802.11 uses a contention method of Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision
Avoidance. 802.11 implements a Request to Send/Clear to Send mechanism that
avoids collisions.
46. C. The demilitarized zone (DMZ) is where Internet-facing servers/services are
placed.
47. B. Firewalls should always be placed at key security boundaries, which can be the
Internet and your internal network. However, proper placement is not exclusive to the
boundaries of the Internet and internal networks. For example, it could be placed
between two internal networks, such as R&D and guest networks.
48. B. Firewalls cannot provide protection from internal attacks on internal resources.
They are designed to protect networks from external attacks or attacks emanating
from the outside or directed toward the Internet.
49. A. All physical access to a firewall should be controlled tightly so that it is not
tampered with, which could allow external threats to enter the network. This control
should include vendors and approved administrators. Physical access to the firewall is
a security principal and therefore not a consideration for the management of a
firewall.
50. C. Firewalls keep track of the TCP conversation via the SYN-SYN/ACK-ACK three-
way handshake. This is done so that a DoS attack such as a SYN flood can be
mitigated.
51. A. ASA allow for zones to be created and the connections applied to the zones. This
methodology allows for security rules to be applied uniformly to the outside zone.

52. B. Servers should be placed in the DMZ so they can access both the inside zone and
outside zone. This will allow a server such as a web server to allow client access from
the Web (outside). Rules could also be applied so that the server (for example, a
database server) could allow access to data from within the internal network (inside).
53. C. An IDS, or intrusion detection system, will detect unauthorized access.
However, it will not prevent unauthorized access. It is a form of audit control in a
network.
54. A. When a firewall matches a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), such as a URL, it
is operating at layer 7. This is known as a web application firewall, or WAF.
55. D. Since the email server needs access to the Internet to send and receive mail, it
should be placed in the demilitarized zone (DMZ). This will also allow access to
internal clients in the inside zone.
56. A. AWS and Microsoft Azure are examples of public cloud providers. Private clouds
are internally created, and hybrid clouds are a combination of services between your
private cloud and the public cloud.
57. B. If you were looking to create a fault tolerant colocation site as a cloud provider,
you would be searching for an Infrastructure as a Service provider. This would allow
you to install your own operation system and applications.
58. B. The hypervisor allows for multiple operating systems to share CPUs, RAM,
network, and storage of a physical server.
59. D. A virtual machine, or VM, is an operating system that is running on hardware
but is not directly attached to the hardware. It is decoupled from the hardware
through the use of a hypervisor. The hypervisor creates an abstraction layer between
the hardware and the operating system.
60. A. The physical hardware (such as a server) used in virtualization is the host.
61. C. A virtual switch connects the virtual machine NIC to the physical network.
62. B. The End of Row (EoR) switch acts as a distribution switch for the Top of Rack
(ToR) switches.
63. C. Automated billing is not a NIST criteria for cloud computing. It is essential for
the cloud computing vendor, but is not relevant if you are hosting it yourself. The five
NIST criteria for cloud computing are on-demand self-service, broad network access,
resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.
64. C. When an internal IT department hosts the virtualization for a company, it is
called a private cloud.
65. B. A cloud services catalog satisfies the self-service aspect of cloud computing. It
does this by listing all of the available VMs that can be created in the cloud
environment, such as web servers, application server, databases, and so on.

66. C. A hosted medical records service is an example of a SaaS, or Software as a
Service, model. The customer cannot choose variables such as vCPU or RAM. The
cloud provider is responsible for the delivery of the software, maintenance of the OS,
and maintenance of the hardware.
67. A. A hosted service that allows you to develop upon it is an example of the
Platform as a Service (PaaS) model. The cloud provider is responsible for the delivery
of APIs that developers can use to create programs.
68. C. An intercloud exchange is a service that connects multiple public clouds
through a common private WAN connection. This allows a network engineer to
configure the private WAN once and be able to transition between the public clouds on
the service side without reconfiguration of the private WAN.
69. A. Internal bandwidth usage is not a consideration after conversion to a SaaS
application. External bandwidth should be considered since internal users will access
the application through the Internet. Location of the users should also be a deciding
factor in moving to a SaaS model. Branch office connectivity to the Internet should be
considered also when converting.
70. B. A virtual firewall or virtual router is an example of a VNF. These devices are
typically network functions that are found in internal networks such as firewalls and
routers. These devices perform basic network functionality and run as a virtual
machine or virtual instance.
71. C. You will need a virtual router running static NAT to translate the two different
IP networks. This type of service is called a virtual network function, or VNF.
72. C. Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a standardized protocol for network time
synchronization.
73. D. If you wanted to scale a web server out to several other web servers, you would
use Server Load Balancing as a Server (SLBaaS) from your cloud provider.
74. C. Lowering bandwidth between the premises and your VMs on the public cloud is
a direct benefit if locating NTP on the public cloud for VM time synchronization.
75. A. Bandwidth is the primary decision factor for moving DNS closer to the
application in the public cloud. However, if the majority of DNS users are on premises,
then it should remain on premises for bandwidth reasons.
76. B. Access layer switches connect to users and are edge network devices.
77. A. Distribution layer switches connect to access layer switches and core switches to
provide redundancy.
78. C. Core layer switches connect campuses together via the distribution layer
switches.
79. C. The two-tier, or collapsed-core, model contains only the distribution and access
layer switches.

80. A. Based on the layout of your network, the collapsed-core model is the most
appropriate model to design. If at a later time other campuses are joined to the
network, the core layer can be added.
81. B. Based on the layout of your network the three-tier model is the most
appropriate model to design. Since there are four campuses, the core layer is
recommended for connectivity.
82. D. Only switching between campus (distribution) switches should be performed at
the core layer. Nothing should be done to slow down forwarding of traffic, such as
using ACLs, supporting clients, or routing between VLANs.
83. B. The distribution layer is where redistribution of routing protocols should be
performed. It should never be performed at the core or access layer.
84. C. The access layer is where collision domains should be created. This is called
network segmentation.
85. C. The collapsed-core design model is best suited for small enterprises. It can later
be expanded out to a three-tier model as an enterprise grows in size. It has no effect
on bandwidth if designed right.
86. A. A star topology has a centralized switch connecting all of the devices outward
like a star.
87. B. Increased redundancy of connections is a direct benefit of a full mesh topology.
Although bandwidth will increase because of multiple paths, additional dynamic
routing protocols will need to be implemented to achieve this.
88. C. The hybrid topology is most often seen at the access layer. The devices are
connected in a star topology and the access layer switches are partially meshed to the
distribution layer switches.
89. B. Distribution layer switches are fully meshed for redundancy. The number of
links can be calculated with the formula of N(N – 1). So if you had four distribution
switches, the ports required for a full mesh would be 4(4 – 1) = 4 × 3 = 12 ports among
the four switches. The formula of N (N – 1) / 2 would give you the number of links
(connected ports): 4(4 – 1) / 2 = 4 × 3 / 2 = 6 links.
90. A. Core layer switches are commonly set up in a star topology. This is because core
layer switches connect multiple campuses via distribution layer switches.
91. A. The collapsed core layer switch uses a star topology connecting outward to the
access layer switches. This design is often found in small enterprise and single campus
design.
92. B. All links between switches are connected redundantly. This allows for both the
forwarding plane and control plane to have multiple paths and redundancy. The
forwarding plane forwards traffic, and the control plane controls routing between
VLANs.

93. A. In a star topology, the central switch is connected outward to all edge switches.
This is commonly seen at the core layer switch.
94. A. An autonomous WAP acts similarly to an access layer switch. However, WAPs
normally do not have redundant links back to the distribution switches. So it acts
more like a star topology, connecting the Ethernet and wireless clients together.
95. C. Generally, office buildings do not have direct runs to each switch closet from the
other closets. Although a full mesh is desirable, sometimes only a partial mesh is
achievable.
96. A. 1000Base-T is short for 1000 Baseband – Twisted pair. 1000Base-T utilizes all
four pairs over standard Cat5e, whereas 100Base-T utilizes only two pairs of Cat5.
97. C. Single-mode fiber is 9 microns at its core. With proper transceivers, the signal
can span 10 km to 70 km without needing to be retransmitted.
98. A. A straight-through cable would be used since routers are DTE, or data terminal
equipment, and switches are DCE, or data communications equipment. DTE to DCE
requires a straight-through cable.
99. A. 1000Base-T can be run up to 100 meters, or 328 feet, per its specification.
100. B. You connect to Cisco switches and routers via 900 baud, 8 data bits, no parity,
and 1 stop bit.
101. B. You would use a crossover cable because a switch is a DCE device. When
connecting DCE to DCE, you would need to cross the connection with a crossover
cable. Newer switches have MDI-X capabilities to detect the need for a crossover cable
and will automatically switch the cable over if a straight-through cable is used.
102. B. Multi-mode fiber can be either 50 microns or 62.5 microns at its core. The
maximum distance for 50 micron fiber is 550 meters utilizing the 1000Base-LX
specification.
103. C. Although operation of computers connected to a switch uses a straight-through
cable, management via the console port requires a rolled cable and an EIA/TIA 232
adapter.
104. C. 10GBase-CX is commonly used in data centers. It is referred to by its nickname
of Twinax. It is a fixed, balanced coaxial pair that can be run up to 25 meters.
105. C. Cat5e can support up to 1 Gb/s via the 1000Base-T specification. Since 10Base-
T, 100Base-T, and 1000Base-T can be run up to 100 meters in length, it allows for
interchangeability with speeds. It was very common when Cat5e came out 16 years ago
for installers to future-proof wiring installations with it.
106. B. It is most likely, since the interface was working before, that someone “shut
down” the interface with the shutdown command. This can be seen in the show
interface serial 0/0 command; the interface is reporting it is administratively shut
down.

107. C. Traceroute should be used from the originating IP when the problem is to the
destination IP. When the traceroute times out is most likely where the problem is
located.
108. C. When you’re checking for speed and/or duplex issues, the show interface
status command will detail all of the ports with their negotiated speed and duplex.
109. B. When you’re diagnosing frame forwarding on a switch, the MAC address table
needs to be inspected to see if the switch has learned the destination MAC address.
110. A. When you’re trying to diagnose port security, the first command should be show
port-security. This will detail all of the ports with port security and their expected
behavior when port security is violated.
111. D. After isolating the problem, performing root cause analysis, and ultimately
solving the problem, the implemented solution should be monitored or verified.
112. A. The first step to troubleshooting a problem is isolating the problem. This can be
done various ways and can sometime include documenting the problem to understand
the root cause.
113. B. The first command used to diagnose a VLAN forwarding issue is the show vlan
command. This command will show all of the VLANs that are defined on the switch
either manually or dynamically through the VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP).
114. C. Since you only have access to the local switches at your facility and you have
checked the local user’s connection status, your only option is to escalate the problem.
115. A. The command that you should begin with is show interfaces fast 0/0
switchport. This command will show the trunk status of the port as well as the
operational status.
116. B. The IP address of 172.23.23.2 is a Class B address.
117. A. The default subnet mask of a Class A address is 255.0.0.0.
118. C. The multicast range begins with 224 to 239 in the first octet. Therefore, only
the IP address 238.20.80.4 is correct.
119. B. The IP address 135.20.255.255 is a Class B broadcast address.
120. B. The CIDR notation for 255.255.240.0 is /20. The first two subnets are 8 bits (8
× 2 = 16), and the 240 is 4 more bits (16 + 4 = 20).
121. A. The mask you will need to use is 255.255.255.252. This will allow for two hosts
per network for a total of 64 networks. The formula for solving for hosts is: 2X – 2 is
equal to or greater than 2(hosts), which in this case is (22 – 2) = (4 – 2) = 2. So 2 bits
are used for the host side, leaving 6 bits for the subnet side. 6 bits + 24 bits (original
subnet mask) = /30, or 255.255.255.252.
122. D. The mask you will need to use is 255.255.255.224. This will allow for 30 hosts

per network for a total of eight networks. The formula for solving for hosts is: 2X – 2 is
equal to or greater than 22 hosts, which in this case is (25 – 2) = (32 – 2) = 30. So 5
bits are used for the host side, leaving 3 bits for the subnet side. 3 bits + 24 bits
(original subnet mask) = /27, or 255.255.255.224.
123. A. The valid IP address range for the 192.168.32.0/26 network is 192.168.32.1 to
192.168.32.62, 192.168.32.65 to 192.168.32.126, etc. Therefore, 192.168.32.59 is within
the valid IP range of 192.168.32.61/26.
124. B. The subnet mask will be 255.255.240.0. Since you need to solve for the number
of networks, the equation is: 2x is equal to or greater than 15 networks. 24 = 16
completed the equation; the 4 bits represent the subnet side; you add the 4 bits to the
16 bits of the class B subnet mandated by the IETF. 16 + 4 = /20 = 255.255.240.0.
125. C. The valid IP address range for 209.183.160.45/30 is 209.183.160.45–
209.183.160.46. Both IP addresses are part of the 209.183.160.44/30 network.
209.183.160.47/30 is the broadcast address for the network.
126. C. Computer A’s default gateway address is 192.168.1.63. This address is the
broadcast address for the 192.168.1.0/26 network and cannot be used as that network’s
gateway.
127. A. Computer A needs to have its IP address changed to align with the network that
its gateway is in. Computer A is in the 192.168.1.32/27 network, while its gateway
address is in the 192.168.1.0/27 network. Although changing the gateway address
would work, the least amount of effort needs to be done. Changing the gateway
address, which is a valid IP address, would create more work for other clients.
128. B. The /21 subnet mask has subnets in multiples of 8. So the networks would be
131.50.8.0/21, 131.50.16.0/21, 131.50.32.0/21, and 131.50.40.0/21. The IP address of
131.50.39.23/21 would belong to the 131.50.32.0/21 network with a valid range of
131.50.32.1 to 131.50.39.254.
129. D. The network for the computer with an IP address of 145.50.23.1/22 is
145.50.20.0/22. Its valid range is 145.50.20.1 to 145.50.23.254; the broadcast address
for the range is 145.50.23.255.
130. B. The valid IP address range for the network of 132.59.34.0/23 is 132.59.34.1 to
132.59.35.254. The first address of 132.59.34.0/23 is the network ID and the last
address of 132.59.35.255 is the broadcast ID.
131. B. The /20 CIDR notation written out is 255.255.240.0. The first two 8 bits are
255.255, and the last 4 bits make up the subnet mask of 250 to make a complete mask
of 255.255.240.0.
132. C. The network mask of 255.255.255.248 borrows 5 bits for the network mask.
Using the formula of 2x = subnets, 25 = 32 subnets.
133. D. The valid number of hosts for a network with a subnet mask of

255.255.255.224 is 30. If 224 uses 3 bits of the 8 bits available for the network ID,
then 5 bits remain for the host portion of the IP address. Using the formula of 2x – 2 =
valid hosts, 25 – 2 = 32 – 2 = 30 valid hosts.
134. D. The valid IP range for the network of 141.23.64.0/19 is 141.23.64.1 to
141.23.95.254. The IP address of 141.23.90.255/19 is a valid IP address within this
range.
135. C. Summarization is similar to subnetting, with the exception that you are
grouping IP addresses together. Think of it as reverse subnetting. Since /22 is
multiples of 4, the statement of 141.24.4.0/22 would give the following range of IP
addresses to be blocked: 141.24.4.1 to 141.24.7.254.
136. B. Summarization is similar to subnetting, with the exception that you are
grouping IP addresses together. Think of it as reverse subnetting. Since /21 is
multiples of 8, the statement of 132.22.24.0/21 would give the following range of IP
addresses to be blocked: 132.22.24.1 to 132.22.31.254.
137. A. Using the subnet of 198.33.20.0/25 will give you 126 nodes. Since you are using
1 bit of the 8 bits in the 4th octet for the network ID, you have 7 bits left for the hosts.
Using the formula of 2x – 2 = valid hosts, 27 – 2 = 128 – 2 = 126 valid hosts.
138. C. Using the subnet of 198.33.20.0/26 will give you 62 nodes. Since you are using
2 bits of the 8 bits in the 4th octet for the network ID, you have 6 bits left for the
hosts. Using the formula of 2x – 2 = valid hosts, 26 – 2 = 64 – 2 = 62 valid hosts.
139. D. Using the subnet of 198.33.20.0/28 will give you 16 nodes. Since you are using
4 bits of the 8 bits in the 4th octet for the network ID, you have 4 bits left for the
hosts. Using the formula of 2x – 2 = valid hosts, 24 – 2 = 16 – 2 = 14 valid hosts.
140. D. The computer had an IP address of 172.18.40.5/12 and it belongs to the
172.16.0.0/12 network, which has a range of 172.16.0.1 to 172.31.255.254. Therefore,
the internal server is within the same network as the computer, and the default
gateway has no effect on the problem. The conclusion is that the network is not the
problem.
141. C. The computer and the gateway address are correct; the IP address of the remote
server is wrong. It is a loopback address and can only be internally used by the local
computer. The valid range for loopback is 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.254.
142. B. A layer 3 broadcast is always all ones in the host portion of the IP address.
When the IP stack see this, it puts all Fs in the destination Ethernet MAC address.
143. A. A unicast address is a single valid IP address for direct communications
purposes between two hosts.
144. D. Anycast is a way of allowing the same IP address on multiple machines in
different geographical areas. The routing protocol is used to advertise in routing tables
the closest IP by the use of metrics. Currently this is how DNS root servers work.

145. C. Multicast is used to allow computers to opt into a transmission. Examples of
uses for multicast are imaging of computers, video, and routing protocols, to name a
few.
146. D. The multicast address range is 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. The /4 depicts a
subnet of 16.
147. B. IGMP, or Internet Group Messaging Protocol, allows switches to join
computers to the multicast group table. This allows the selective process of snooping
to occur when a transmission is sent.
148. B. DHCP uses a packet called a Discover packet. This packet is addressed to
255.255.255.255. Although ARP uses a broadcast, it is a layer 2 broadcast, not a layer 3
broadcast.
149. B. A broadcast will forward a message to all computers in the same subnet.
150. C. The multicast address range is 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.
151. C. RFC 1918 defines three private address ranges, which are not routable on the
Internet.
152. A. The private IP address space was created to preserve the number of public IP
addresses.
153. D. Network Address Translation (NAT) is required to communicate over the
Internet with private IP addresses.
154. A. The Class A private IP address range is defined as 10.0.0.0/8. The address
range is 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255.
155. C. The Class B private IP address range is defined as 172.16.0.0/12. The address
range is 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255.
156. C. Although a Class C address has a classful subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, the
private IP address range put aside for Class C addresses is 192.168.0.0 to
192.168.255.255, written in CIDR notation as 192.168.0.0/16.
157. D. Any address in the range of 169.254.0.0/16 is a link-local address. It means that
the computer has sensed that a network connection is present, but no DHCP is
present. The network only allows local communications and no routing. Microsoft
refers to this as an APIPA address.
158. C. The network seems to be configured properly. You have received a valid
address in the Class A space of the RFC 1918 private address range.
159. D. 198.168.55.45 is a valid IPv4 public address. All of the other addresses are RFC
1918 compliant and thus non-routable on the Internet.
160. A. IANA, or the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, is the governing body,
which distributes public IP addresses and registers them to ISPs.

161. B. IPv4 allows for 232 = 4.3 billion addresses. However, only 3.7 billion are usable,
because of reservations and classful addressing. The current IPv4 address space is
exhausted and IPv6 allows for 2128 = 3.4 × 1038.
162. C. An IPv6 address is 128 bits: 64 bits is the network ID, and 64 bits is the host
ID.
163. D. A 6to4 tunnel can be achieved between the routers. This encapsulates the IPv6
header in an IPv4 header so that it can be routed across the Internet.
164. D. In order to enable IPv6 on a router, you must globally configure the router
with the command ipv6 unicast-routing. Although ipv6 enable will work, it will
allow only link-local addressing.
165. D. When you configure routers, always use the rule of major/minor. The major
protocol is ipv6, and the minor command is address. So the correct command is ipv6
address 2001:0db8:85aa:0000:0000:8a2e:1343:1337/64. The additional rule is to
specify the network portion with a /64.
166. A. The first 4 bits of an IPv6 header contain the version number. In an IPv4
packet, this is set to 0100, but in an IPv6 packet, this number is set to 0110. This
allows for the host to decide which stack to process the packet in.
167. D. When you configure routers, always use the rule of major/minor. The major
protocol is ipv6 and the minor command is route. So the correct command is ipv6
route ::0/0 s0/0, specifying the ::0/0 s0/0 to mean everything out of the existing
interface of s0/0.
168. A. When you use a show command, always follow it with the major protocol and
then the parameters. The show ipv6 interfaces brief command would show all of
the interfaces configured with an IPv6 address.
169. D. RIPng, OSPFv3, and EIGRPv6 are all dynamic routing protocols that work with
IPv6.
170. C. The command show ipv6 route will display only the IPv6 routes in the routing
table.
171. D. You can remove leading 0s in the quartet, and you can condense four zeros to
one zero. However, you can use the :: to remove zeros only once.
172. C. Expanding out the IP of 2001::0456:0:ada4, you first expand the :0: to four
zeros. Then expand the remainder of the quartets to 0s to make a 32-digit number
again.
173. B. The first 48 bits of an IPv6 address is the global prefix; the next 16 bits is the
subnet portion of the IPv6 address. 48 bits + 16 bits = 64 bits for the network ID.
174. A. The network prefix is 2001:db8::/64. Expanded it is written as
2001:0db8:0000:0000/64. However, the condensed version written in the answer is

valid.
175. C. The command to ping an IPv6 address is ping6. The valid condensed address
for fc00:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0004 is fc00::4. You cannot condense
trailing zeros such as fc00. You can only condense leading zeros.
176. B. The address 2001:db8::2435 is a valid IP address. It is shortened by removing
leading zeros and condensed. You cannot clip off the trailing zeros in an address like
fe80::1. Also, ff02::1 is a multicast address and cannot be used for host addressing.
177. C. A single interface can be configured with multiple addresses. Most host
interfaces will have a link-local address for duplicate address detection.
178. B. The answer is 4,096 subnets. You have been given the first 52 bits from your
ISP. However, the complete network ID is 64 bits. You subtract 52 bits from 64 bits =
12 bits, then 212 = 4,096.
179. B. The answer is 16,384 networks. You subtract 34 bits from 48 bits = 14 bits, then
214 = 16384.
180. D. In between each set of colons or field there are four hex numbers, and each
hex number represents 4 bits. Four numbers × 4 bits = 16 bits. In an IPv6 address,
there are eight fields of 16 bits. Eight fields x 16 bits = 128 bit address.
181. D. The correct command to configure Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is ipv6
address autoconfig. Although ipv6 address dhcp is a valid command, it requires a
stateful DHCP server.
182. B. Router solicitations are sent on a multicast address of ff02:2. This address is a
local scope multicast to all IPv6 routers.
183. D. Router advertisements are sent on a multicast address of ff02:1. This address
is a local scope multicast to all IPv6 hosts.
184. A. The Neighbor Discovery Protocol uses Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor
Advertisements messages to look up an IP address from a MAC address through the
use of multicast.
185. C. The layer 3 protocol that Neighbor Discovery Protocol uses to process Stateless
Address Autoconfiguration are ICMPv6 messages.
186. D. Stateless DHCPv6 servers are used to configure DHCP options only. The one
option that all clients need is the DNS server.
187. D. You can set the IPv6 DHCP relay agent on the interface for a stateful DHCPv6
server using the command ipv6 dhcp relay destination 2001:db8:1234::1.
188. B. Duplicate Address Detection, or DAD, uses Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor
Advertisement messages to avoid duplicate addresses when SLAAC is being used.
189. B. Stateful DHCPv6 uses a process similar to DORA for IPv4. However, IPv6 uses
multicast in lieu of broadcasts via the DHCPv6 Solicit multicast address.

190. C. Before a host can communicate via an RS packet, it first needs a valid IP
address. The first address is a link-local address so that it can send an RS packet and
receive an RA packet. The client performs DAD on both the link-local address and the
proposed address.
191. B. The global unicast address is defined as 2000::/3. This provides a valid range of
2000:: to 3fff::.
192. A. The link-local address is defined as fe80::/10. Any address starting with fe80 is
non-routable.
193. A. The first 23 bits are allotted to the ISP by the RIR for the region of the world
for which the ISP is requesting the prefix.
194. C. The unique-local address is defined as fc00::/7. Unique-local addresses have
replaced site-local addresses as of 2004 and are non-routable. The valid IPv6 range is
fc00:: to fd00:: despite IANA reserving fc00::/7 as the fc00:: range. The range should
not be used since the 8th bit is considered the “local bit” and is required to be a 1, as
in, for example, 1111 1101 = fd.
195. D. The multicast address is defined as ff00::/8. Multicast addresses always start
with ff.
196. A. IPv4 RFC 1918 addresses are defined as private non-routable IP addresses. In
IPv6, link-local addresses are the equivalent to RFC 1918 addresses and are non-
routable.
197. D. The command to configure an anycast address on an interface would be ipv6
address 2001:db8:1:1:1::12/128 anycast. The /128 defines a single IP to advertise in
routing tables.
198. A. When converting a MAC address to an EUI-64 host address, the first step is to
split the MAC address into 6-byte sections of f42356 and 345623 and place fffe in
between them, f423:56ff:fe34:5623. This gives you a 64-bit value comprised of a 48-bit
MAC address and a 16-bit filler. You must then invert “flip” the 7th bit. Example: f4 =
1111 010 = flipped = 1111 0110 = f6.
199. C. The EUI-64 address can always be found by looking at the last 64 bits. In
between the last 64 bits of the address, you will always find fffe.
200. C. The command to set an EUI-64 address for the host portion of the IPv6
address on an interface is ipv6 address 2001:db8:1234::/64 eui-64.
201. C. When converting a MAC address to an EUI-64 host address, the first step is to
split the MAC address into 6-byte sections of e5eef5 and 562434 and place fffe in
between them: e5ee:f5ff:fe56:2434. This gives you a 64-bit value comprised of a 48-bit
MAC address and a 16-bit filler. You must then invert “flip” the 7th bit. Example: e5 =
1110 011 = flipped = 1110 0111 = e7.
202. B. The output of show ipv6 interface gi 0/1 shows the multicast groups the

interface has joined.
203. A. A one-to-many IPv6 address is a multicast address. One multicast address will
allow many IPv6 clients to receive the transmission.
204. D. The ::1 address is a special address called a loopback address, similar to
127.0.0.1 in IPv4.
205. B. A one-to-closest IPv6 address is an anycast address. Many routers or services
can have the same address. However, routing protocols allow for the client to be
directed to the closest resource.
206. C. Stateful DHCPv6 addressing will not allow EUI-64 addressing. This is because
the DHCPv6 server is responsible for allocating an IPv6 address from a predefined
pool.
207. A. Link-local addresses starting with fe80::/10 always configure the host portion
of the address with an EUI-64 address. Note that Microsoft products default to a
random host ID and can be configured to generate the host ID with EUI-64.
208. C. The IPv6 address has been given to you by the ISP with your company’s
unique identifier. The first 32 bits are allocated to the ISPs, and they in turn add a
unique 16-bit address for your company. This makes 32 bits + 16 bits = 48 bits. You
have 16 bits for subnetting after the first 48 bits to make a full 64-bit network ID.
209. B. When converting a MAC address to an EUI-64 host address, the first step is to
split the MAC address into 6-byte sections of 401e32 and e4ff03 and place fffe in
between them: 401e:32ff:fee4:ff03. This gives you a 64-bit value comprised of a 48 bit
MAC address and a 16 bit filler. You must then invert “flip” the 7th bit. Example: 40 =
0100 000 = flipped = 0100 0010 = 42.
210. C. Although the unique-local address scope is defined as fc00::/7, RFC 4193 states
that the 8th bit must equal a one for the local (L) bit. This requires the address to
always start with fd which in binary is 1111 = f and 1101 = d or 1111 1101 = fd.

Chapter 2: LAN Switching Technologies (Domain 2)
1. B. Switches break up collision domains by allowing full-duplex. Switches are set to
auto-negotiate duplex and speed by default, and they do not force full-duplex.
2. C. MAC address tables, also called CAM tables, are always built and stored
temporarily in RAM. When the switch is turned off or the clear command is issued,
the table no longer exists.
3. A. Switches allow for low latency because frames are forwarded. They utilize ASIC
hardware-based switching and have low cost.
4. A. Switches make forward/filter decisions based upon the MAC address to port
association in the MAC address table.
5. B. The mechanism that switches use for loop avoidance is STP, or Spanning Tree
Protocol.
6. B. Switches learn MAC addresses by inspecting the frame’s source MAC address on
the incoming port. They then associate the source MAC address with the port it came
in on.
7. A. In the exhibit, only one broadcast domain exists because a PC on the left hub can
send an ARP request, and the PC on the right hub can hear it. If you wanted to create
multiple broadcast domains, you would need to create VLANs and route them.
8. C. In the exhibit, there are three collision domains present.
9. C. Computer A will create an ARP (broadcast) request. When that request is

received on port Fa0/0, the switch will record Computer A’s MAC address on Fa0/0.
Then it will forward the message to all ports.
10. B. Since the MAC address table has the MAC address for Computer B, the switch
will direct the frame to port Fa0/1 only.
11. B. The command to see the MAC address table is show mac address-table.
However, on some 4000 and 6500 series switches, show cam dynamic will perform the
same function.
12. A. Computer A will no longer forward traffic because the static entry will override a
dynamic entry.
13. C. Computer A’s frames will be forwarded to its new port of Fa0/3, since the
entries will be cleared out when the cables are disconnected and relearned.
14. B. The destination MAC address for broadcasts are always all Fs, such as
ffff.ffff.ffff.
15. D. The show interfaces status command will display the port number, connected
status, VLAN, duplex, speed, and type of interface.
16. D. When loop avoidance such as STP is not employed and loops exist, you will get
duplicate unicast frames and broadcast storms. This will inevitably thrash the MAC
address table and degrade bandwidth to nothing.
17. C. The default MAC address aging time for dynamic entries is 300 seconds, or 5
minutes.
18. A. The replacement of hubs with switches increases collision domains and
effectively increases bandwidth.
19. C. The computer is connected to either another switch or hub on Gi0/1, since there
are multiple MAC address entries on Gi0/1.
20. B. The command to show the current MAC address entry count in the MAC
address table is show mac address-table count. This command will also show the
maximum number of entries the table can hold.
21. A. Forward filter decisions are made upon the destination MAC address in the
frame.
22. C. Store-and-forward mode is the default mode for mode edge switching
equipment. Store-and-forward receives the frame, calculates the CRC, and then makes
a forwarding decision.
23. A. A collision domain is defined as a group of computers that can potentially have a
frame collision. Adding switches that can negotiate full-duplex and forward/filter fixes
these issues.
24. B. When a MAC address is unknown by the switch, the switch will forward the
frame to all ports; this is also called flooding the frame. When the destination system

acts upon it, the switch learns its MAC address through source MAC address learning.
25. B. Fragment-free mode reads the first 64 bytes and deems the frame intact and
forwardable. This is because most collisions that would create frame fragments
happen within the first 64 bytes of a frame. This method of switching is often found
on SOHO switching equipment.
26. B. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to map remote IPs on the current
LAN to MAC addresses. It does this by broadcasting at layer 2 to all nodes for a
response for the MAC address. Thus, it is a mapping of IP address to MAC address.
27. D. The collisions vs. packets shows a high number of collisions. In a full-duplex
network connection, there should be no collisions. This would suggest that the port on
the switch or the NIC card in the computer is set to half-duplex. Half-duplex causes
collisions, which can degrade bandwidth by 40% to 60%.
28. A. Currently all of the computers are within one giant collision domain. Replacing
the hub with a switch will create four separate potential collision domains. Switches
create micro-segmentation, which increases the number of collision domains and
increases bandwidth.
29. C. In the exhibit there are two broadcast domains, VLAN 1 and VLAN 2. In each of
the broadcast domains there exists a single collision domain, along with the collision
domain between the switch and router.

30. C. Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is used to map MAC addresses on
the current LAN to IPs. BOOTP also uses this method to allocate an IP address via the
MAC address. Thus, it is a mapping of MAC address to IP address.
31. B. The command used to reset the MAC address table is clear mac-address-table
dynamic.
32. A. In the exhibit, duplicate frames are being delivered to a router on segment 1.
This is because Spanning Tree Protocol is not configured for loop avoidance.
33. A. The command to see all of the MAC addresses on a single interface is show mac
address-table interfaces fast 0/1. This command can be entered in either
privileged exec mode or user exec mode.
34. A. Cut-through mode copies the first 6 bytes after the preamble into memory and
makes a switching decision on the destination MAC address. Many data center
switches use this method of switching to provide low latency while assuming no
collisions will exist.
35. B. Latency in switching is the total time it takes to forward an incoming frame to
its destination interface. Latency of frame forwarding adversely affects total
bandwidth.
36. C. Hardware-based bridging uses specialized application-specific integrated circuits
(ASICs) to provide low latency in switching frames.
37. B. Flooding occurs only when the destination MAC address is not in the current
MAC address table.
38. C. Wire speed is the switch’s ability to process packets both incoming and outgoing
on the same port at wire speed. However, this is not the switch’s ability to switch at
that speed; the speed of the switch is limited by its backplane bandwidth.
39. D. Switches learn MAC addresses based upon incoming ports and examination of
the source MAC address. It will build a MAC address table for future lookups. It then
determines forwarding interfaces based upon the destination MAC address contained
in the frame.
40. D. A switch creates micro-segmentation, which in turns isolates traffic between
two talking computers from other computers that are not part of the communications.
This in turn increases bandwidth for the computers that are not part of the
communications between the two talking computers.
41. B. The store and forward method of switching allows the switch to receive the
entire frame and calculate the CRC against the data contained in the frame. If the CRC
does not match, the frame is dropped, and the sending node must retransmit after an
expiry timer or upper-protocol timer times out.
42. B. When a frame is received on an incoming port, both the incoming port and the
source MAC address are added to the MAC address table and set with an aging timer.

43. A. Since there is nothing in the current MAC address tables or either switch, the
incoming frame on Switch A will be flooded to all ports. This will include the port
connecting Switch B. Switch B in turn will flood the frame to all ports. However,
nothing will respond on Switch B since the host is on Switch A. Although this is
wasted traffic, it is minimal since it is only the initial communications.
44. A. Wire speed of a single port on a 48-port gigabit switch would be 1 Gb/s, or 1,000
Mb/s.
45. C. MAC address aging time can be configured via the command mac-address-table
aging-time 400. You can additionally specify a VLAN ID.
46. A. Since there is nothing in the current MAC address tables or either switch, the
incoming frame on Switch A will be flooded to all ports. This will include the port
connecting Switch B. Switch B in turn will flood the frame to all ports.
47. C. Each port on a switch creates its own collision domain. An increase in collision
domains raises bandwidth since each port creates its own segment (micro-
segmentation) and isolates possible collisions on other ports.
48. B. Since the MAC address table is empty on Switch A, Switch A will flood the frame
to all ports on the switch. This will include the router attached to interface Fa0/3.
However, a router does not perform forward/filter decisions, so the frame will not be
flooded any further on Router A.
49. C. The only time a frame is dropped is when the cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
calculated against the frame’s payload deems the frame corrupt. If the destination
MAC address is not known, it will be flooded to all active ports on the switch, but it
will not be dropped.
50. A. In the exhibit, a broadcast storm is occurring due to improper configuration of
STP for loop avoidance.
51. A. The 6-byte destination MAC address is after the preamble/SFD so that it can be
read by the switch for forwarding.
52. C. The preamble allows for the source computer to sync its timing of the physical
media independent interface with the destination computer. It achieves this via an
alternating 1 and 0 pattern at a specific frequency, depending on data transfer speed.
The Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) has an extra bit to let the destination computer know
anything that follows is data.
53. C. The organizationally unique identifier, or OUI, is 24 bits, or the first 3 bytes of
the MAC address.
54. B. The Frame Check Sequence is a 4-byte cyclical redundancy check (CRC)
calculation. Its only function is to detect erroneous frames; it will not correct data and
contains no parity to do so.
55. C. When the I/G bit is set, it means that the MAC address is intended to be a

broadcast or multicast for a group of recipients.
56. B. When the G/L bit (sometimes referred to as the U/L bit) is set, it means that the
MAC address is locally governed. This means that the user has manually set the MAC
address.
57. C. MAC addresses are physical addresses that are burned into every NIC card and
network device. They are unique at the Data Link layer for direct communication
purposes.
58. A. The nominal MTU size is 1,500 bytes of data. It may also be advertised as 1,518
bytes, which is calculated from 1,500-bytes (payload) + 6 bytes (source MAC address)
+ 6 bytes (destination MAC address) + 2 bytes (type field) + 4 bytes (FCS) = 1,518
bytes. If 802.1Q VLAN tagging is being used, it can be advertised as 1,522 bytes to
allow for 4 bytes for tagging. If ISL VLAN tagging is being used, ISL requires 30 bytes
+ 1,518 bytes = 1,548 bytes.
59. B. The Ethernet type field is 2 bytes and it identifies at layer 2 which upper-layer
protocol to send the data to. When IPv4 is used, the type field is 08-00. When IPv6 is
used, the type field is 86-dd.
60. C. The preamble is 7 bytes of alternating 1s and 0s at a frequency that matches the
bandwidth of the link. It is important to note that the 1s and 0s pattern starts with a 1
and ends with a 0 for 7 bytes (10101010). The SFD has an extra lower bit signaling the
end of timing and the start of data (10101011).
61. C. Although cabling could create an issue similar to this, it would not disable the
interface. The most probable cause is that there is a duplex mismatch since there are a
good number of late collisions. The most probable scenario is that the far end is set to
half-duplex and the interface is set to full-duplex.
62. A. The interface has been administratively down, which means that the interface
has been “shutdown”. To resolve the problem a no shutdown command must be
configured on the interface.
63. C. In order to clear the counters for a single interface, you would use the command
clear counters interface fast 0/1. After it’s entered, you will need to confirm
clearing of the counters. Then you can monitor the solution provided on the interface.
64. D. The counters on this interface are all nominal, but the interface and line
protocol are down/down. This most likely suggests that the cable is disconnected.
65. A. It is recommended to set all servers and networking hardware statically for
speed and duplex. If a network interface flaps (transitions between up and down),
auto-negotiation of speed and duplex will be performed again, which could create a
service outage.
66. D. The txload and rxload counters are extremely high. This depicts that the
interface is not fast enough for the data being transferred. The speed and duplex

currently is 10 Mb/s and full-duplex. However, the interface on the switch is capable
of 100 Mb/s. It is recommended to upgrade the node’s NIC.
67. A. The commands to set the port back to auto-negotiation are speed auto and
duplex auto. You can also negate the command with no speed and no duplex
commands. Both methods will set auto-negotiation back on the port.
68. B. Cisco switches can auto-detect speed, so the speed sensed will be 100 Mb/s.
However, if the switch cannot detect the speed, then it will fall back to 10 Mb/s.
Duplex is decided upon bandwidth when IEEE auto-negotiation is turned off. If the
speed is 10 Mb/s or 100 Mb/s, then the duplex will be half-duplex; otherwise it will be
full-duplex on 1000 Mb/s links.
69. B. Hubs do not participate in IEEE negotiation, and therefore the speed will be
detected. However, since duplex cannot be negotiated, 10 Mb/s and 100 Mb/s
connections will be half-duplex and 1000 Mb/s connections will be full-duplex.
70. C. The show interfaces status command will display the port number,
description, connected status, VLAN, duplex, speed, and type of interface.
71. D. The vlan.dat is the database for VLANs configured on a switch either manually
or through VTP. It is persistent even if config.text (startup-config) is deleted. You
must manually delete the vlan.dat.
72. D. All switches are configured by default with all interfaces in VLAN 1. This
simplifies configuration if the switch is to be used as a direct replacement for a hub
since nothing needs to be configured.
73. A. The normal VLAN range is 1 through 1001 before you must use the extended
VLAN range.
74. C. The flexibility of design for workgroups of people and the ongoing management
of moving and adding people is a benefit of a routed VLAN-enabled network.
75. C. When you’re configuring an interface for a VLAN, only the VLAN number can be
used. The correct command is switchport access vlan 9.
76. A. The switchport voice vlan 4 command will configure the interface to switch
traffic with a COS value of 5 set by the phone to the voice VLAN of 4.
77. C. The switchport is configured as a trunk, but since the computer was originally in
VLAN 1 and the native VLAN of the interface is VLAN 1 by default, all traffic untagged
was directed to the native VLAN.
78. A. All VLAN tagging is removed from the frame before it egresses an access port to
the end device.
79. C. VLANs 1 and 1002 through 1005 are protected by the IOS and cannot be
changed, renamed, or deleted.
80. B. By default, the VTP mode is server. VTP v1 and v2 do not support storage and

propagation of extended VLANs. However, when the switch is put into transparent
mode, it does not participate in VTP, so the VLANs can be configured.
81. C. The extended VLAN range is VLAN 1006 to 4094.
82. C. The port needs to be changed from trunk mode to access mode, via the
command switchport mode access. Although switchport native vlan 12 would
remedy the problem, it would be an improper configuration since you are expecting
tagged traffic and directing untagged traffic to VLAN 12.
83. D. For security concerns, it should not be used in production. It is the default
VLAN configured on all switches. Potentially, a computer can be plugged into an
interface defaulted to VLAN 1 and expose resources such as the switch management
network.
84. B. Configuration of jumbo frames requires creation of the VLAN from a global
configuration prompt and then setting the maximum transmission unit (MTU). The
value of the MTU will differ from switch to switch but is usually 9,000 bytes or higher.
85. B. The command to verify that a VLAN is created and the port(s) it is associated
with is show vlan.
86. C. The command to delete VLAN 9 is no vlan 9 performed from a global
configuration prompt.
87. D. Frames with MAC addresses that are not in the MAC address table are flooded
only to the ports in the respective VLAN.
88. B. When the command is invoked inside of the interface, it will create the VLAN
automatically.
89. D. The normal range of VLANs on a default Cisco switch is VLAN 1 to 1001.
However, VLAN 1 cannot be modified.
90. C. Static VLANs are VLANs that have been manually configured vs. dynamic
VLANs that are configured via a VLAN Membership Policy Server (VMPS). A node will
not know which VLAN it is assigned to when it is statically set via the command
switchport access vlan 3.
91. D. The addition of another VLAN will increase the effective bandwidth by adding
additional broadcast domains. A router is required to route between VLANs. However,
it will not be required if you are logically partitioning the switch via VLANs.
92. B. When adding VLANs, you immediately increase the number of broadcast
domains. At the same time you increase collision domains. If a switch had 12 ports
and they all negotiated at 100 Mb/s half-duplex (one collision domain), when a VLAN
is added you will automatically create two collision domains while adding an
additional broadcast domain.
93. C. Dynamic VLANs are deprecated, but you may still see them in operations. A
switch configured with dynamic VLANs checks a VLAN Management Policy Server

(VMPS) when clients plug in. The VMPS has a list of MAC addresses to their
respective VLANs. It is now recommended that dynamic VLAN installations are
converted to 802.1x.
94. D. To verify a VLAN name change, you would use the command show vlan id 3.
This would only show you the one VLAN configured in the database. show vlans is
incorrect because the command is not plural; it is singular, show vlan. It will give you
a complete listing of all VLANs.
95. A. Creating the new VLAN will logically segment this work group. Creating a
Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) will allow routing on the layer 3 switch. The ACLs
should only be applied to VLAN interfaces. Although the other solutions achieve a
similar goal, they do not provide flexibility.
96. A. The Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is required for Cisco VoIP phones. It allows
the switch to learn capabilities and power requirements.
97. D. The command show interfaces switchport will display a detail of all ports in
respect to VLAN operational status. The command will show the operational mode of
the interface, such as trunk or access mode.
98. D. The proper way to enable a VLAN to forward traffic is to first enter the VLAN
database for ID 3 and then issue the no shutdown command. On some IOS versions,
this can also be done via the command no shutdown vlan 3 from global config mode.
99. C. The command show interfaces FastEthernet 0/3 switchport will show the
switchport details for only Fa0/3, to include its operational mode. This command is
similar to show interfaces switchport, which will show all ports.
100. B. The VLAN is disabled from forwarding traffic in the VLAN database. The no
shutdown vlan 5 must be performed in global config. The VLAN interface being shut
down would have no effect on traffic being forwarded on the VLAN, only routed.
101. C. The client computer connected to an access port cannot see any VLAN tagging
information. It is removed before egress of the interface.
102. D. When the MTU is changed on the VLAN, it has little consequence to normal
MTU communications. However, if you are going to utilize the new MTU for
something like iSCSI, it must be supported end to end or it can actually decrease
performance. All switching equipment between the two end devices must support
jumbo frames.
103. B. Since the remote office has no onsite IT personnel, there is a risk of workers
plugging in unauthorized equipment such as a WAP. If port security is implemented,
the interface can be secured to allow only the MAC address of the computer to pass;
all other traffic can be dropped.
104. C. When layer 3 or routed VLANs are implemented, it allows for a more secure
network with the use of ACLs applied to the VLAN interface.

105. B. Wireless LAN controllers allow trunks to be used so that multiple VLANs can
be used. Once the VLANs are accessible to the WLC, you need to create one SSID tied
to the VLAN configured for production and another SSID tied to the VLAN configured
for guests.
106. A. The default VLAN for all switches is VLAN 1. It is the default configuration for
all access ports from the factory.
107. D. The extended VLAN database will be stored in the startup-config. Only normal
VLANs are stored in the VLAN database (vlan.dat). When configuring extended
VLANs, you must have the switch in VTP transparent mode.
108. A. You should first create the VLAN in the VLAN database and add its name. Then
you need to enter the interface and configure the port for the VLAN.
109. B. VLAN 4 is an active VLAN. However, it has not been given a name, so the
default name is VLAN0004.
110. B. You must manually configure the VLAN on the Cisco switch(s). VTP is a
protocol that allows for VLAN autoconfiguration in the VLAN database. However, only
Cisco switches support it.
111. D. A router will not function as a switch and a router. You cannot configure two
router interfaces for the same network. The recommended change is that Switch A and
Switch B are trunked together. Then a single connection from either Router A or
Router B is connected to Router A.
112. B. When a VLAN is created, so is a broadcast domain. The broadcast
domain/VLAN requires its own unique IP network addressing and a router to route
between the networks.
113. D. Only one switch in the network needs to provide routing functionality. Since
Computers A and C can ping each other, the SVI is configured properly for routing.
The most probable cause is that a trunk does not exist between the switches.
114. B. In global configuration, you first need to enter the entry of the VLAN in the
VLAN database. Then you can issue a name command to overwrite the existing entry.
Negating the VLAN 4 and re-creating it would also work but would create interruption
when it was destroyed.
115. C. The command used to configure an access port for VLAN 8 is switchport
access vlan 8, and the command to configure the VOIP phone is switchport voice
vlan 6.
116. D. The port is set up as a trunk. Since the phone is normally configured for 801.Q
tagging of COS values, it will work in this diagram. However, since the computer is not
tagging traffic for data, the communications will be directed to the native VLAN on the
configured trunk.
117. C. One of the prerequisites for configuring extended VLANs is that the VTP mode

must be transparent.
118. B. VLAN 1 is the default VLAN and it is not permitted by the IOS to change the
VLAN in any way. This includes name changes.
119. C. The computer is on another switch connected via a trunk link, since there are
multiple VLANs on the interface of Gi0/1.
120. A. Although the MTU is configured on the VLAN, all switches and devices
connected end to end must be configured to support jumbo frames. If you fail to do
this, you can expect to see a performance decrease. An MTU of 9128 is defined as a
jumbo frame.
121. B. Since the Dell switch cannot support the proprietary protocol of ISL, both
switches need to be set up to use 802.1Q.
122. B. The command to specify 802.1Q encapsulation on a trunk interface is
switchport trunk encapsulation 802.1q.
123. D. This error is very common when configuring Cisco switches, since many
switches only support 802.1Q and configuration is not necessary. The ISL trunking
protocol is not supported on certain platforms, such as the 2900 series switches.
124. B. The command show interfaces trunk will display all of the configured trunks
on the switch.
125. C. When a frame traverses a trunk and does not have VLAN tagging information
in the 802.1Q encapsulation format (untagged), it is sent to the native VLAN
configured on the trunk.
126. A. All switches are configured by default as a VTP server.
127. B. The command to display the mode settings for VTP is show vtp status.
128. B. When setting up VTP on a new switch connected to your existing VTP
infrastructure, you need to change the mode of the switch. Then you must configure
the VTP domain that is serving the VTP information.
129. C. The 802.1Q protocol is supported by all switches’ vendors for trunking. It is an
open standard that was developed by the IEEE.
130. C. The command show interface fastethernet 0/15 switchport will show the
operational mode, and if configured as a trunk, it will show the native VLAN.
131. A. The command to change the native VLAN of a trunk to VLAN 999 is switchport
trunk native vlan 999.
132. B. This error is normal if it is the first interface to be changed over to the new
native VLAN since the other interface has not been changed yet. However, if the other
interface was changed already and you received this error, then CDP is letting you
know that the other side is mismatched.

133. B. The VLAN is not allowed over the trunk because of the switchport trunk
allowed vlan 4,6,12,15 command.
134. D. The Dynamic Trunking Protocol can be turned off with the command
switchport nonegotiate, which when configured states not to negotiate trunks via
DTP.
135. C. The command switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 2-4 will remove
VLANs 2 through 4 from the trunk.
136. D. The command switchport trunk allowed vlan all will restore the allowed
VLAN list back to default.
137. A. Switch B will need to either have its interface set to switchport mode trunk or
switchport mode dynamic desirable for Switch A to turn its interface into a trunk.
138. A. The command switchport trunk allowed vlan add 4 will add VLAN 4 to the
existing list of VLANs already allowed on the interface.
139. C. The command will not complete because the interface is set to dynamic auto,
which implies the trunk protocol will be negotiated. You cannot set it to switchport
mode trunk until you statically set the encapsulation via the command switchport
trunk encapsulation dot1q.
140. D. On Switch A, DTP is turned on and the encapsulation is set to 802.1Q.
However, on Switch B, DTP is turned off and ISL encapsulation is manually set.
Switch B will need to have 802.1Q configured in order to have trunking complete.
141. B. VLAN Trunking Protocol, or VTP, propagates the VLAN database from an initial
master copy on the “server” to all of the “clients.”
142. A. Inter-Switch Link, or ISL, is a proprietary protocol used for trunking of
switches. If you need to connect non-Cisco switches to a Cisco switch, you must use
802.1Q, the IEEE standard.
143. C. 802.1Q inserts a field containing the 16-bit Tag Protocol ID of 0x8100, a 3-bit
COS field, a 1-bit drop-eligible indicator (used with COS), and the 12=bit VLAN ID,
which equals 32 bits, or 4 bytes.
144. B. A switch in VTP transparent mode will not participate in VTP. However, if the
VTP is v2, the switch will forward and receive VTP advertisements.
145. D. Both switches have a native VLAN mismatch. Since Switch B has an inactive
VLAN, it would be recommended to change the native VLAN back to 1 on Switch B.
146. A. You must first set the encapsulation to 802.1Q, then you can statically set the
mode to trunk. An alternative would be to set the port to dynamic desirable via the
command switchport mode dynamic desirable. However, it is recommended to
statically configure the link to trunk on one or both sides if possible.
147. B. VTP VLAN pruning removes forwarding traffic for VLANs that are not

configured on remote switches. This saves bandwidth on trunks because if the remote
switch does not have the VLAN configured on it, the frame destined for the VLAN will
not traverse the trunk.
148. B. The command “vtp pruning in global configuration mode will enable VTP
VLAN pruning.
149. D. The problems will not be apparent since the trunk will still function for tagged
traffic. However, any traffic that is not tagged will be directed to the opposite side’s
native VLAN. So traffic expected for VLAN 1 will be directed to VLAN 10, and VLAN 10
traffic will be directed to VLAN 1 when not tagged.
150. A. VTP pruning needs to be configured only on the VTP server. The clients will
receive the update and turn on VTP pruning automatically.
151. B. VLAN Trunking Protocol allows for conformity of VLANs across all Cisco
switches. The protocol uses a master-slave database with a revision control of +1. If
the server is 5 and the clients are 4, they will update the database to the latest revision.
152. C. Native VLANs are only used for traffic that is not tagged, which is placed on a
trunk link. A common use for native VLANs is management traffic between switches,
before both sides are configured as a trunk.
153. D. The VTP domains must match on both switches. Switch A has a VTP domain of
Cisco, and Switch B has a VTP domain of cisco. The VTP domain, just like a password,
is case sensitive.
154. B. The native VLAN on Switch A is set to VLAN 2, and the native VLAN on Switch
B is VLAN 1. This will cause mismatch errors with CDP, although CDP will still
function, it will continue to generate errors.
155. D. The switch is set up with a VTP mode of transparent. When a switch is set up
with a mode of transparent, the VLAN information is stored in the running-config in
lieu of the vlan.dat file.
156. B. If you issue the command switchport nonegotiate, the switch will not send
Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) frames for trunk negotiation. The default
configuration for a port is the mode of access, so the port will remain in an access port.
157. A. You want Switch B to become a member of VLAN 5. So Switch A must change
its interface to an access port, which will force Switch B to remain an access port. Then
you configure the access VLAN of 5 on Switch A. If you tried to configure this with a
native VLAN, you would result in a native VLAN mismatch and improper
configuration.
158. D. The command switchport mode dynamic desirable is similar to switchport
mode dynamic auto with the exception that it is desirable to become a trunk. So if the
neighboring port is set to auto, desirable, or trunk, it becomes a trunk.
159. A. The command switchport mode dynamic auto will cause the port to remain an

access port if the neighboring port is configured the same. However, if you configure
the neighboring port as a trunk, it will become a trunk.
160. C. The command show interfaces switchport will show greater detail about the
trunk than the command show interfaces trunk. Alternatively, you can specify a
single port using the command show interfaces Fa 0/5 switchport, for example.
161. A. Configuring servers like VMware ESXi is no different than configuring other
switches. The exception is that the VMware server will not participate in DTP. So we
first configure the command to set the interface statically to a trunk. Then we turn off
DTP with the command switchport nonegotiate since DTP is not needed.
162. B. Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) will alert you to a native VLAN mismatch. You
will receive the error “%CDP-4-NATIVE_VLAN_MISMATCH: Native VLAN mismatch
discovered….” When a trunk is configured, the native VLAN is always used for CDP
exchanges.
163. C. The VTP clients track changes via a 32-bit number inside of the VTP frame
called the revision number. By default, every 5 minutes a summary advertisement is
sent from the server. However, when an update occurs, a new VTP frame called a
subset advert message is sent.
164. B. The show interfaces gi 0/1 switchport on Switch B shows the interface in a
static access mode. This means that you have an interface mismatch. Switch A is set to
a mode of trunk, and Switch B is set to a mode of access.
165. A. Since the VTP clients in the network check the revision number in VTP, if a
client is changed to a server, the database remains intact. So when a change is made,
the revision number will increment and propagate to the rest of the network. Even if
an existing server exists, its revision number will be lower.
166. D. The command show interfaces trunk will show the details of allowed VLANs.
The show running-config command will also show you the allowed VLANs.
167. C. When trunking to a non-Cisco product, you cannot rely on DTP to form the
trunk link. The port must explicitly be set to a trunk via the command switchport
mode trunk. It is also advisable to turn off DTP via the command switchport
nonegotiate.
168. A. The command show vtp status will tell you if VTP pruning is enabled or
disabled.
169. C. VLAN 1002 is reserved for use with an FDDI VLAN and not allowed for
Ethernet traffic. All Ethernet traffic must be a VLAN between 1 to 1001. You cannot
use 1002 to 1005 because they are used for legacy applications.
170. D. Although switchport trunk allowed vlan all and switchport trunk allowed
vlan 1-1001 would rectify the problem, it would cause network interruption if those
VLANs were blocked for security concerns. The proper way to add a VLAN is

switchport trunk allowed vlan add 9.
171. C. The original version of STP was created by Digital Equipment Corporation
(DEC). The IEEE ratified the specification of STP as 802.1d in 1990.
172. B. Spanning Tree Protocol runs as a distributed process on each switch. Each
switch creates and maintains its own topology database referencing the root bridge.
173. A. STP monitors all interfaces for BPDUs, which carry switches’ identities. When
it sees the same switch ID in BPDUs on multiple interfaces, a redundant link is
detected.
174. C. The root bridge is elected by all of the switches and has the lowest MAC
address and priority of them all.
175. B. The original STP specification was revamped in 2004 with RSTP 802.1w. This
revamping of STP was to fix problems with the original specification.
176. A. The root bridge is a point of perspective for the rest of the STP network. It is
important to have a point of perspective to calculate which ports are blocked and
which remain in a forwarding mode.
177. C. The bridge ID is made up of a 2-byte bridge priority and a 6-byte MAC address
for a total of 8 bytes.
178. D. The link cost is a numeric value that represents the cost in speed of a link. The
higher the numbers, the lower the speed of the link, thus a higher cost.
179. B. The RSTP path cost is the calculation of all of the link costs that lead back to
the root bridge. The link cost is a numeric value that signifies the speed. The lower the
number “cost,” the higher the speed of the link.
180. D. 802.1d STP convergence takes 50 seconds to complete before the port is put
into a state of forwarding or blocking. This is dependent on the STA, or spanning-tree
algorithm.
181. C. When a computer is connected to an STP-enabled interface, the port will
transition between blocking, listening, learning, and forwarding. The time between the
states of blocking and forwarding is called the convergence and is 50 seconds.
182. A. A designated port is a port that has the lowest cost compared to the higher cost
of the redundant ports. It is placed into a forwarding state for a network segment.
183. A. Every switch in the network segment must have at least one root port. This is
the port that leads back to the root bridge. The root bridge will have a designated port
on the adjacent link.
184. C. The root port is the port that leads back to the root bridge on the adjacent
switch. It has the lowest cost of the redundant ports.
185. C. An STP blocked port will block all frames from being forwarded. The blocking
excludes BPDUs, which it will continue to listen for and calculate future topology

decisions.
186. B. Per-VLAN Spanning Tree+ elects a root bridge for each VLAN and creates a
topology table for each VLAN. It is a Cisco proprietary protocol due to the bridge ID
calculation it must perform for each VLAN.
187. A. The designated port is the port with the lowest cost of the redundant links to
the network segment. The adjacent port is normally the root port leading back to the
root bridge.
188. D. RSTP has three transitions when a computer is plugged in (no loops). The
transitions are discarding, learning, and forwarding, which allow for rapid convergence
times.
189. C. The PVST+ bridge ID comprises a 4-bit bridge priority calculated in blocks of
4096, a 12-bit sys-ext-id that is the VLAN ID for the segment, and a 6-byte MAC
address for the switch.
190. C. The default bridge priority for STP is 32,768.
191. A. Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree+ elects a root bridge for each VLAN. It allows
for fast convergence times and logical placement of the root bridge. However, it
requires the most CPU and RAM of all implementations.
192. B. Common Spanning Tree elects a single root bridge for the entire network and
all of the VLANs. This creates a problem when the center of your network may vary
upon VLAN placement.
193. B. RSTP has three transition modes and converges faster than STP, which is 50
seconds. It is, however, backward compatible with STP 802.1d.
194. B. Each switch is responsible for sensing changes to the topology. Whenever the
topology changes, a Topology Change Notification (TCN) is sent out all root ports and
an acknowledgment is sent back. This happens until the root bridge sends back a
notification.
195. B. 802.1s, which is called Multiple Spanning Tree (MST), is a standard based upon
PVST+. It is an open standard created by the IEEE that will allow Per-VLAN Spanning
Tree in multi-vendor switched networks. However, it is not fully supported on all
Cisco platforms as of yet.
196. D. The root bridge always has all of its ports in a designated mode or forwarding
mode. If there are redundant links, the adjacent switch to the designated port on the
root bridge must be a non-designated or blocking state.
197. A. RSTP has three port states: discarding, learning, and forwarding. Blocking and
listening are both mapped to discarding in RSTP. When a port is in a state of
discarding, it means the interface is discarding all frames except for BPDUs.
198. B. The switch with the MAC address of 0011.03ae.d8aa will become the root
bridge. Its MAC address is the lowest out of the four switches.

199. D. All Cisco switches are defaulted to the Cisco proprietary STP protocol of
PVST+.
200. D. An alternate port is a port that is in a discarding state. If the root port fails on
the switch with the alternate port, then the alternate port becomes the root port for
that switch.
201. A. A backup port is a port in a discarding state. It receives BPDUs from another
port on the same switch. If the forwarding port fails, then the backup port will become
designated so that connectivity to the segment can be restored.
202. D. Although 00f8.034e.bede is the highest MAC address of the four switches, the
priority is the lowest of the four. Since the priority and MAC address are added
together, the priority allows the switch to win the election.
203. A. The command to set the STP priority for VLAN 5 is performed from a global
config prompt. The full command is spanning-tree vlan 5 priority 16384.
204. D. The command show spanning-tree summary will show all of the VLANs for
which the current switch is a root bridge.

205. C. Enabling Rapid PVST is super simple. From a global config prompt you use the
command spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst.
206. B. The command show spanning-tree vlan 6 would only show the spanning-tree
configuration for VLAN 6.
207. D. The new port state that RTSP has is discarding, which replaces the blocking
state of STP.
208. B. Switch B is the root bridge, therefore Switch A Fa0/0 is a root port and Switch
C Fa0/4 is a root port.
209. D. Switch B is the root port, therefore Switch A Fa0/0 and Switch C Fa0/4 are
root ports. Between Switch A Fa0/1 and Switch C Fa0/5, one of the ports needs to be
blocking. Since Switch C Fa0/5 has the highest MAC address, its port is put into a
blocking state.
210. C. From the output of the show spanning-tree vlan 1 command, we see that the
root bridge ID is a different MAC address from this bridge’s ID. At the bottom of the
output you can see the port role, which is root. This means that the port is connected

to the root bridge.
211. D. Since Switch A is the root bridge because of the lower priority, the adjacent
switch’s interfaces become the root ports.
212. B. All of the switches have the same priority. However, Switch C has the lowest
MAC address and has become the root bridge. The link between Switch A and Switch B
is not a redundant connection. Since Switch A has a higher MAC address, its port of
Fa0/0 will go into a blocking state and become non-designated.
213. D. Nothing needs to be changed in this network because RSTP is backward
compatible with STP. On some versions of IOS/models or switches, RSTP is not
supported and therefore cannot be configured.
214. A. All switches have the default priority, so Switch A has the lowest MAC address
of the four switches and becomes the root bridge.
215. C. All three switches will have a root port leading back to the root bridge since
Switch A is the root bridge. The total path cost is lower for Switch D Gi0/8 than it is
for Switch D Fa0/10.

216. B. All switches have the default priority. The lowest MAC address is Switch C, so
the adjacent interfaces of Switch A Gi0/0 and Switch D Gi0/10 become root ports.
Next we need to calculate the total path cost, and since the total path cost is higher
between Switch B and Switch D, we turn the furthest port into a blocking state.
217. A. The network is running Rapid PVST+ since this is the default when you
configure RSTP via the command spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst. The correct
command is spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 16384. Priorities must always be
configured in increments of 4,096.
218. B. The first switch you must configure as a root bridge is Switch A for VLAN 2

with a priority of 16,384. Then configure Switch C as a root bridge for VLAN 7 with a
priority of 16,384.
219. B. With RSTP, path cost is the total calculated value of costs along the path to the
root bridge. If another switch has a lower path cost to the root bridge for the VLAN,
then its port will become the root port and any redundant links will become alternate
ports.
220. C. Switch A is the root bridge for VLAN 1 because all of the interfaces are in a
designated state. Only the root bridge has all of the interfaces in a designated state for
a VLAN.
221. D. The command spanning-tree portfast” entered into the interface will turn on
PortFast mode. This will allow the interface to forward first.
222. B. PortFast should only be configured on access links where end devices are
plugged in because these devices will not typically create loops in the switch topology.
223. B. This command turns on PortFast globally for only access ports on the switch.
This command should be used on access switches because end devices are connected
at this level in the hierarchy.
224. A. You will create a temporary switching loop until the BPDUs are heard from
each interface over the hub. However, during this period you will have a switching
loop and degrade traffic over the entire switching topology until convergence happens.
225. A. BPDU Guard will turn the interface to err-disable as soon as a BPDU is heard
on the interface. This feature should be enabled on access switches when configuring
PortFast.
226. A. PortFast mode allows an interface to bypass the blocking state and begin
forwarding immediately. It then listens and learns of BPDUs on the interface and can
make a decision to continue to forward frames or enter into a blocking state.
227. C. The correct command to configure BPDU Guard on a single interface is
spanning-tree bpduguard entered into the interface you want to turn it on for.
228. C. BPDU Guard was turned on the trunk link. When the BPDU of the adjacent
switch was seen, the switch turned the port into err-disabled mode.
229. B. Configuring BPDU Guard along with PortFast ensures that the end device will
always be forwarding. BPDU Guard ensures that in the event a BPDU is heard on the
interface, the interface will enter into an err-disable mode.
230. D. Using the command show spanning-tree interface fa 0/1 will show the
spanning tree configuration for an interface. If PortFast has been configured, the last
line will read, “The port is in the PortFast mode.”
231. D. One way to disable BDPU Guard is to enter the command spanning-tree
bpduguard disable. Another way is to negate the command with no spanning-tree
bpduguard.

232. C. The switch’s interface will become err-disabled immediately. Once it is in err-
disable mode, an administrator is required to reset the interface.
233. B. The show spanning-tree summary command will show you which features are
turned on globally or by default.
234. D. BPDU Guard will protect the edge switch from someone accidentally plugging
in another switch to a port dedicated for end devices.
235. A. The command spanning-tree portfast default will configure all access ports
on the switch as PortFast enabled.
236. B. Link Layer Discovery Protocol is an IEEE standard of 802.1ab. Most Cisco
devices can perform LLDP.
237. D. The command to turn off CDP globally on a switch is no cdp run.
238. B. CDP frames are sent out all active interfaces every 60 seconds.
239. C. Cisco Discovery Protocol, or CDP, is a Cisco proprietary protocol used for
gathering information from neighboring switches and routers.
240. D. The default holddown timer for CDP entries is three times the advertisement
timer of 60 seconds. So entries have a holddowntimer value of 180 seconds.
241. B. To turn off or suppress CDP advertisements on a single interface, you would
enter the interface and enter the command no cdp enable.
242. D. The sh cdp entry * command will give output that’s identical to that of the
show cdp neighbors detail command.
243. B. The command lldp run entered in global config mode will enable LLDP on all
interfaces. When enabled, LLDP-MED, or LLDP for Media, will read capabilities on
the phone such as name and power level.
244. C. The command show lldp neighbor detail will show output identical to the
output of show cdp neighbor detail.
245. A. The default LLDP advertisement interval is 30 seconds. When turned on, it will
advertise out all active interfaces every 30 seconds.
246. B. When you use the command no lldp transmit, it will suppress LLDP
messages from exiting the interface it is configured on.
247. D. The default value of the LLDP holddown timer for entries is 120 seconds. This
holddown timer is set every time the switch hears an advertisement for a device. The
holddown is four times the advertisement interval.
248. C. Switch B is connected to Switch A via Gi0/2. Switch A Gi0/1 is the adjacent
interface connecting the two switches.
249. D. The command no cdp enable will turn off CDP advertisements on the
interface that you configure it on.

250. B. The command show cdp interface will display all of the interfaces CDP is
enabled on along with their advertisement intervals.
251. B. EtherChannel can aggregate 2 interfaces to 8 interfaces together on a single
switch when using PAgP.
252. D. When EtherChannel bonds interfaces together, they act as a single Ethernet
link. Therefore, layer 2 and layer 3 sees it as a single link.
253. A. The highest configurable bandwidth is going to be 2 Gb/s. This is because you
cannot mix speeds and duplex.
254. A. The Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is the IEEE standard 802.3ad.
255. B. LACP is an IEEE standard that is supported by non-Cisco devices to create
aggregation links and negotiate the configuration.
256. C. EtherChannel can aggregate 2 interfaces to 16 interfaces together on a single
switch when using LACP. Only eight ports can be used at any one time; the others are
placed in standby mode.
257. C. If you configure the EtherChannel to on mode, it forces the aggregation of
links together without the use of a control protocol.
258. A. The term EtherChannel is a Cisco-centric term. Most vendors will not
recognize the term.
259. C. Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) is a Cisco proprietary control negotiation
protocol.
260. A. PAgP sends control notifications every 30 seconds to the adjacent switch.
261. A. Using active mode on both sides assures us that the switches will start
negotiation with only Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP).
262. C. When you use passive on one side and active on the other side of a port
channel, the result is that Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) will be used.
263. A. The command show etherchannel will display all EtherChannels on the switch
along with their negotiated protocols.
264. B. Since both interfaces are set to passive mode, neither side will initiate the
LACP control notifications. Although the port channel is configured on the switch, it is
not communicated between the switches.
265. D. When both sides of the port channel are configured with the On mode, an
unconditional port channel is created. This means there is no control protocol
assisting the port channel.
266. C. When you configure the channel group command interfaces, it automatically
creates a port channel interface. This pseudo interface should be used for all
configurations of the collective ports.

267. A. When one side of the port channel is configured with the auto mode and the
other is configured with desirable mode, the EtherChannel is formed with PAgP.
268. A. When the on mode is used, it means that no aggregation protocol will be used.
On the adjacent switch, you must use the on mode.
269. D. By default, load balancing is performed on frames by the source MAC address.
270. B. When configuring PAgP, you will use either the auto and desirable mode or the
desirable mode on both sides. When you use desirable mode on both sides, desirable
mode will unconditionally configure the EtherChannel with PAgP.
271. B. When changing the EtherChannel load-balancing criteria, you must change it
in global configuration mode via the port-channel load-balance dst-ip command.
272. A. Since the load-balancing method is globally configured, you use the show
etherchannel load-balance command to verify the criteria load balancing is
performed with.
273. C. When you want optimal load balancing, you would configure the source and
destination IP address. On some versions of Cisco IOS, you can configure the source
and destination IP address as well as the source and destination ports. Although this
creates the most optimal load balancing, it creates a high amount of latency since layer
4 information must be calculated.
274. B. This option forces an interface, if configured with desirable or auto, to forcibly
send notifications. When a port is configured in auto mode, it requires another
adjacent switch to send PAgP notifications. This option forces the notifications with
the desirable mode.
275. B. When configuring an access port for use with an EtherChannel, it is
recommended to configure the switchport access vlan # command in each interface
where the channel-group command has been configured.
276. C. The EtherChannel has been configured with no control protocol, which is a
result of configuring each side of the EtherChannel with the command channel-group
1 mode on.
277. B. Since the auto mode was used on the first switch (Switch A), desirable should
be used on the second switch to assure forming of an EtherChannel.
278. D. If the other switch is set to passive mode, an EtherChannel will not form. The
recommended mode for the other side is active mode.
279. A. When one side is configured with on mode, it uses no control protocol. If a
control protocol is sensed from the adjacent switch, the port will enter err-disable
mode to protect it from a loop.
280. C. When you configure the channel-group 1 mode active command on the first
interface, a pseudo interface is created called port-channel 1. All statistics and
configuration should be referenced by this interface.

281. B. Switch stacking allows for all of the switches to be tied together so the uplink
port can be shared at a nominal bandwidth of 32 Gb/s for the backplane loop.
282. C. Cross-stack EtherChannel allows you to configure EtherChannels between
physical switches to act as one EtherChannel. If one switch or SPF transceiver goes
bad, the rest of the switching will be supported by the other physical switches.
283. B. Cisco will support a maximum of 9 switches in a switch stack configuration.
284. D. When you create a switch stack, the subordinate switches will upgrade or
downgrade the IOS software according to the master switch’s IOS. Legally, you must
purchase the highest IOS the master switch contains or downgrade the license the
master contains.
285. C. The StackWise 3750 has a backend loop of two counter-rotating rings. Each
ring supplies 16 Gb/s in each direction. This allows for up to 32 Gb/s total traffic flow
and also allows for redundancy.
286. B. When you create a switch stack, you assign the IP address to the master
switch. This IP address is used for the entire switch stack. If a master fails, a new
master is elected and the original master IP is used.
287. C. Switches participating in stacking can be added, deleted, or replaced without
powering the stack off. The provisioned switch that is being replaced must match the
replacement’s stack member number via the switch {stack-member-number}
provision command.
288. D. The master switch is responsible for forwarding tables, ACL distribution, QOS,
and multicast routing. The master switch is elected by the criteria of configured
priority, hardware and software priority, configuration, uptime, and MAC address.
289. A. Configuration is downloaded to the replacement switch automatically when it
is replaced. The switch responsible for hosting the configuration is the master switch.
290. A. Only the master switch needs to be upgraded. Once the master switch is
upgraded, it will download the IOS to all other members of the switch stack.
291. B. The subordinate switch, often referred to as the slave switch, downloads all of
its IOS, configuration, and forwarding tables from the master switch.
292. B. Switch stacking cables come in lengths of 50 centimeters, 1 meter, and 3
meters. The maximum length of the switch stack cable is 3 meters, or about 10 feet.
293. D. The command used to verify cabling of the switch stack is show switch stack-
ports. This command will display a table of how the switches are connected.
294. B. The command show switch will display all switches in the stack along with
their role. Within this information will be a switch labeled master.
295. D. Priority values can be configured from 1 to 15. The higher the priority, the
better the chances of winning an election. If the switch is set to a priority of 15, it will

always win the election and become the master.

Chapter 3: Routing Technologies (Domain 3)
1. B. All routing decisions are based upon destination IP address. The router examines
the IP address and routes the packet to the next closest hop for the network it belongs
to.
2. C. Static routing requires a network administrator to intervene and create a route in
the routing table.
3. D. When an IP address is configured on a router’s interface, the network is
automatically put into the routing table. The IP address is also added to the routing
table. When the routing table changes, this normally tells the routing protocol it
should perform an update.
4. A. The subnet mask is used by the host to determine the immediate network and
the destination network. It then decides to either route the packet or try to deliver
itself without the router’s help.
5. C. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is employed by the host or router when a
packet is determined to be local on one of its interfaces.
6. C. The destination MAC address is changed to the router’s MAC address and the
destination IP address is untouched.
7. B. The TTL, or time to live, is decremented usually by one. When the TTL reaches
zero, a packet is considered un-routable. This prevents packets from eternally routing.
8. B. When an IP address is configured on an interface, the entry in the routing table is
called the local route. The local routes always have a prefix of /32.
9. B. When a packet is determined to be local to the sending host, ARP is used to
resolve the MAC address for the IP address of the destination host, and the frame is
sent directly to the host.
10. B. The sending host ANDs its subnet mask against the destination IP address, then
against its IP address, and this give a frame of reference for where it needs to go and
where it is.
11. D. The current method of packet forwarding used by Cisco routers is Cisco Express
Forwarding (CEF). CEF creates several cache tables used for determining the best
route for the destination network.
12. B. The layer 2 process is called frame rewrite. When a packet hops from router to
router, the destination frame is rewritten for the next destination MAC address.
13. C. When a MAC address is unknown for the destination IP address or the default
gateway, the ARP request is sent in the form of a broadcast.
14. A. Every host contains an ARP cache. This cache allows for lookups of MAC
addresses for destination IP addresses when the host frequently sends packets to the

destination. Therefore, there are fewer ARP packets.
15. B. After the frame is verified to be addressed to the router and the FCS has been
checked, the router decapsulates the packet and strips off the frame.
16. D. The command to display the router’s ARP cache is show ip arp.
17. B. By default, all entries have a time to live, or TTL, of 240 seconds. They will be
removed after that period if not used during the 240 seconds.
18. C. When traffic is remote to the immediate network, the host sends an ARP packet
for the IP address of the default gateway. This determines the destination MAC
address for the frame.
19. A. The command to view the routing table is show ip route.
20. D. Dynamic routing allows for the population of routing tables from
advertisements of other routers. There are several dynamic routing protocols, such as,
for example, EIGRP, RIP, OSPF.
21. B. When a route is found in the routing table, the router will find the gateway for
the next hop and change the packet’s destination MAC address for the next router.
22. D. The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a layer 3 protocol that allows
for end-to-end testing with a command such as traceroute.
23. C. The command clear arp cache will clear the ARP cache of a router. It is notable
that the command clear arp-cache will clear the ARP cache of the local router as well
as send a gratuitous ARP (GARP) for other devices to relinquish the ARP cache of the
router’s address.
24. B. The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a distance-vector protocol.
25. C. The ping command uses ICMP to check the status of a router. It also gives the
round-trip time of the packet.
26. D. The last router will send an ICMP packet back to the originating host, which has
the result code of destination unreachable.
27. C. When you’re using the ping command, the exclamation marks signify that the
ping was successful and the router is responding.
28. B. A routing loop occurs when packets are routed between two or more routers and
never make it to their destination. Routing loops can occur with more than two
routers; it is in effect making the packet travel in a loop till its TTL expires.
29. A. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state protocol. A link-state protocol
tracks the state of a link between two routers and chooses the most efficient routes
based upon the shortest path. EIGRP is an advanced distance-vector protocol.
30. A. Dynamic routes are stored in RAM. When the power is taken away from a
router, all routes must be repopulated by neighboring routers.

31. A. Static routes are highly trusted routes since an administrator created them.
Therefore, they have the lowest administrative distance with a number of 1.
32. B. Although this is a static route, it is a very special static route called a default
route or gateway of last resort. The S signifies that it is static and the * signifies that it
is the default route.
33. C. The 4 represents the metric for this route statement. Since this is a RIP entry,
the metric is the number of hops for this particular route.
34. C. The destination address of 0.0.0.0/0 is a special route called the default route or
gateway of last resort. The 0.0.0.0/0 addresses all hosts, and if a specific route is not
matched in the routing table, then this route is the last resort.
35. B. The top line in the exhibit is the summarization of all three routes below. This is
also called a supernet, since it is opposite of a subnet. It groups the networks that are
independently routable into one statement, summarizing them.
36. C. The number represents the time the route had been in the routing table and
signifies when the route had last been updated. This route is populated via a dynamic
routing protocol, when the protocol updates the route, it will be reset to zero.
37. B. The correct command sequence is ip route, followed by the network ID, the
subnet mask, and then the gateway. In this case, the gateway is a serial line.
38. B. The command ip default-gateway allows the management plane of the router
to egress the network in which the router is configured upon through a different
gateway.
39. C. Router A needs to be pointed to the adjacent router’s far IP address. Imagine a
hall with two doors; one door leads to Network A and the other leads to Network B. To
get to Network B, you need to get to the router’s IP interface (door).
40. A. In the routing table there is a static route for 192.168.4.0/24 via Serial 0/0/1.
41. D. Your packets are most likely making it to the destination host. However, there is
no route back to your host on the other network’s router.
42. D. When an IP address of 192.168.1.1/24 is configured, for example, the router will
create a summary route for 192.168.1.0/24 as well as a route for 192.168.1.1/32. Both
of these changes to the routing table will trigger an update depending on which
dynamic routing protocol is being used.
43. B. The command show ip interfaces brief will display all of the interfaces and
their configured IP addresses.
44. A. A route for the interface will not be populated in the routing table until the
interface is in an up/up status. If the link was disconnected, this would create the
same symptoms.
45. C. The route will exit the Serial 0/2/0 interface, since the gateway of last resort is

set to Serial 0/2/0. This statement is identified by the S* 0.0.0.0/0 entry.
46. C. Static routing is suited for small networks, where the central admin has a good
understanding of the network layout. It does reduce router-to-router communications
because the overhead of routing dynamic protocols will not use up bandwidth.
47. C. When you configure a static route, it is stored in the startup-config, which is
located on the NVRAM. When a router loads, the routes are held in RAM.
48. C. The easiest way to accomplish this is to super-net the addresses together. The
network of 192.168.0.0/30 or 255.255.240.0 would capture traffic for the range of
192.168.0.1 to 192.168.3.254.
49. B. Secondary routes with higher administrative distance are used for failover. If
the physical interface fails, the route statement will be taken out of the routing table.
Then the second route will become active.
50. A. The IP address of 208.43.34.17/29 belongs to the network of 208.43.34.16/29. In
addition to the statement for the network which owns the IP address, the individual IP
address will be configured as a local route with a /32.
51. D. The 192.168.4.0/24 network is routable via the Serial 0/0/1 interface.
52. A. Serial interfaces are point-to-point connections. Any traffic directed down the
interface will automatically appear on the adjacent router. Routers will not process
traffic normally unless Proxy ARP is configured for the interface.
53. C. When routers select the next hop, the rule of most specific first is always used.
Since there are three routes to 192.168.4.0/24 (including the gateway of last resort),
the most specific of 192.168.4.0/24 via Serial 0/0/1 is selected.
54. D. The route you will need should address the 198.44.4.0/24 network with the
network mask of 255.255.255.0. The exit interface is Serial 0/1, which is directly
connected to the other router.
55. B. The IP address of 203.80.53.22/19 belongs to the network of 203.80.32.0/19.
56. D. Nothing needs to be done since the IP address of 198.44.4.5/24 is configured on
Fa0/1. This shows that the network of 198.44.4.0/24 is connected to Fa0/1.
57. A. The IP address of 194.22.34.54/28 belongs to the network of 194.22.34.48/28.
58. B. The network of 205.34.54.85/29 is written out as 205.34.54.85 255.255.255.248.
The next hop is 205.34.55.2, so the command would be ip route 205.34.54.85
255.255.255.248 205.34.55.2.
59. C. When entering IPv6 routes. you must use the command ipv6 route. It is then
followed by the IPv6 prefix and mask and then the gateway. The default route would
be ipv6 route ::/0 serial 0/0.
60. B. When configuring an IPv6 route, you use the ipv6 route command. You then
must specify the network and mask using CIDR notation. Last, you specify the exit

interface or next hop of serial 0/0/0. The complete command will be ipv6 route
fc00:0:0:1/64 serial 0/0/0.
61. A. The packet will be routed to the IP address of 192.168.4.2. This will occur
because the administrative distance is lower than the route for the gateway of
192.168.4.5.
62. D. The administrative distance of the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is 120.
63. B. Administrative distance is an order of reliability between dynamic routing
protocols and static routes.
64. A. A directly connected network has an administrative distance of 0 and is the
most highly reliable.
65. A. Internal EIGRP has an administrative distance of 90.
66. B. The network of 192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected via Serial 0/0. The packet
will be delivered out the exit interface of Serial 0/0. The administrative distance is the
lowest on directly connected routes.
67. C. The administrative distance of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is 110.
68. C. The routing protocol with the lowest administrative distance is always chosen.
Within that protocol, if there are multiple routes to the same network, then the lowest
metric is chosen.
69. B. The administrative distance can be added to the end of the route statement.
Since RIP has an administrative distance of 120, 130 will be chosen if the RIP route is
not present.
70. A. Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) has the lowest
administrative distance of the three protocols. Therefore, regardless of the metric, the
lowest AD will always be chosen.
71. A. Latency is lower with SVI inter-VLAN routing because of the use of ASICs. This
is usually why IVR switches are more expensive.
72. C. The scalability of ROAS is a major disadvantage. It does not scale well when a
large number of VLANs are configured.
73. D. The command no switchport does the opposite of configuring a port as a switch
port. It turns the port into a routed interface in which an IP address can be configured.
74. A. The use of VLANs requires a unique IP network for each VLAN. This is how
broadcast domains are increased, since all VLANs are behind a router interface
(default gateway).
75. B. Router on a stick is created by configuring a trunk between the switch and the
router. ROAS will receive tagged frames and route them, then send them back down
the interface to the respective connected VLAN.

76. C. The ip routing command must be entered in global config. When this
command is entered, a routing table will be created and populated.
77. B. When a router’s interface is used to allow routing, the method is called router
on a stick, or ROAS.
78. B. 802.1Q is the trunking protocol that should be used for tagging VLANs when
you are routing between VLANs on a router.
79. B. Bandwidth is often a consideration because everything you send to the router
must come back on the same port for routing to work. Routing between two VLANs on
a 1 Gb/s interface will allow for the bandwidth of 1 Gb/s up and 1 Gb/s down. When a
third VLAN is introduced they must all share the 1 Gb/s.
80. C. When you perform inter-VLAN routing on a layer 3 switch, it is called Switched
Virtual Interface (SVI) VLAN routing.
81. D. The command encapsulation dot1q 2 will associate the subinterface with
VLAN 2. If you specify the native tag after the command, it will make this
subinterface the native VLAN for the trunk.
82. A. When configuring an IP address on an SVI, you must enter the interface of the
VLAN. Once in the pseudo interface, you enter the ip address command and then
enter no shutdown.
83. A. When you are configuring a router on a stick, the switch port of the switch must
be in trunk mode. This is so that traffic can be tagged as it gets sent to the router,
which will see the tag and route it accordingly by the destination IP address.
84. B. A best practice is to always name the subinterface the same as the VLAN
number you are going to route. An example is if you are connected to Fa0/1 on the
router, and you want to create an IP address on the subinterface for VLAN 2. Then you
would name the subinterface Fa0/1.2.
85. C. The command encapsulation dot1q 5, when configured inside of the
subinterface, will program the subinterface to accept frames for VLAN 5.
86. B. On 2960-XR switches you must enable the Switching Database Manager (SDM)
for LAN Base routing to enable routing. The switch then requires a reload before you
can configure routable SVIs.
87. A. The same command used to verify physical interfaces on a router, is used to
verify SVI interfaces on a switch. The command show ip interface brief will pull up
the configured IP address on each VLAN interface.
88. C. The command ip address 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 only defines the
192.168.2.0 network. It does not specify a valid host IP address for the SVI.
89. B. The LAN Base feature supports IP routing between SVIs. However, it must be
enabled first via the Switching Database Manager (SDM) by using the sdm prefer
lanbase-routing command.

90. C. The no switchport will configure a physical port of a switch to act as a routed
interface. Once the physical port is configured as a non-switch port, you will be able to
configure an IP address directly on the interface.
91. A. The command show interface gi 0/2 switchport will show the state of a port.
It will display if the port is switched or routed among several other attributes.
92. C. You can build an EtherChannel between routers and switches to obtain more
bandwidth when using ROAS. It is supported on certain models of routers, such as
7000, 7200, and 7500 routers.
93. D. The command encapsulation isl 5 configured in the subinterface will achieve
this. It specifies the encapsulation as ISL and a VLAN of 5 that it will be tagged with.
94. B. After configuring a VLAN and the respective SVI interface, a route will not show
until at least one port is configured with the new VLAN.
95. B. Using Router On A Stick is a cheaper alternative to IVR if the current switch
does not support layer 3 routing.
96. B. When configuring ROAS on a router’s interface, you should always issue the no
ip address command. No IPs can be configured on the main interface. All IPs are
configured on the subinterfaces.
97. C. Verifying the proper operation of the switch would start with verifying that the
port is correctly set as a trunk to the router. If it is not set as a trunk, it would not be
able to tag frames for the router to direct to the proper interfaces.
98. C. When you’re configuring a router interface to accept VLAN tagging, the
subinterface numbering does not matter. It is recommended that the subinterface
match the VLAN for readability. However, encapsulation dot1q 10 is the command
that allows the subinterface to accept the frames for VLAN 10.
99. A. When ROAS is implemented, only the physical interface has a unique MAC
address. All ARP requests for the IP addresses configured on the subinterfaces
respond with the same MAC address. They are not unique MAC addresses, but on each
VLAN they are unique in the sense that no other machines on the VLAN share the
same MAC address.
100. A. Each IP address on a subinterface is the routed gateway for the VLAN on that
subinterface. The main interface should be configured with the no ip address
command when ROAS is configured. The default native VLAN of 1 is configured on the
switch side only unless you explicitly configure a native VLAN on the router.
101. D. The scalability of routes between routers should always be considered when
choosing a static routing design vs. a dynamic routing design. A few VLANs over many
routers creates a lot of work when a new VLAN is created and static routing is being
used. However, when one router is being used, the administrative overhead is low.
102. C. Default routing is a form of static routing. It is used on the edge of a network

to direct all traffic to the inner core of the network.
103. B. Static routing is extremely secure, because it does not need to broadcast or
multicast routing updates. These updates can be intercepted or injected into a network
to create problems.
104. D. Static routing has the lowest bandwidth overhead because there is no
bandwidth required to maintain static routes.
105. A. Dynamic routing does not require any administrator intervention when routes
go down. This is because dynamic routes send route notifications and recalculate the
routing tables of all participating routers.
106. C. Static routing requires increased time for configuration as networks grow in
complexity. You will need to update routers that you add with all of the existing routes
in the network. You will also need to update all of the existing routers with the new
routes you add with the new router.
107. D. Default routing requires the least amount of RAM consumption because one
routing statement is required for every route. This type of routing technique is best
used on stub network routers.
108. C. Routing Information Protocol (RIP) has the lowest overhead of all of the
routing protocols. However, it is not very scalable, the maximum number of hops is
15.
109. A. The benefits of a dynamic routing protocol is that it creates resiliency when
routes become unavailable. It does this by recalculating the best route in the network
around the outage.
110. A. Most dynamic routing protocols will summarize routes. They do this for
efficiency, so the least number of route statements will need to exist in the routing
table.
111. D. Static routing requires administrator intervention when a route goes down.
Default routing is generally used for stub networks where the only route out of the
network is the default route.
112. A. The Routing Information Protocol version 1 (RIPv1)broadcasts updates for
routing tables.
113. B. Optimized route selection is a direct advantage of using dynamic routing
protocols. A protocol such as OSPF uses the shortest path first algorithm for route
selection.
114. C. The show ip routes static command will display all of the routes that are
configured as static routes.
115. C. Static routing is best suited for small networks in which there is not a lot of
change. It should be chosen when administrators want absolute control over the
routing process.

116. A. The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a distance-vector routing protocol.
This is because RIP only advertises the discovered distance of a route and the metric is
the number of hops.
117. B. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a true link-state protocol. Link-state
protocols keep track of the state of the links as well as the bandwidth the link reports.
118. C. The Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is a hybrid protocol.
It has features of a vector-based protocol and a link-state protocol, hence it is
considered a hybrid protocol.
119. B. Protocols such as RIP re-advertise routes learned. This can be problematic
since it is the equivalent of gossiping about what they have heard and nothing is
checked.
120. B. RIP, which is a distance-vector protocol, is best suited for networks containing
fewer than 15 routers. This is because RIP is limited to a 15 hop count. Any route that
is more than 15 hops away is considered unreachable.
121. C. EIGRP metrics are bandwidth, delay, load, reliability, and MTU, while RIP is a
distance-vector protocol and only takes hop count into consideration for the metric.
BGP is not suited for optimal performance since a large amount of resources need to
be dedicated for the protocol.
122. A. Routing loops are the most common problem when you’re using a distance-
vector routing protocol. Although they can occur with any dynamic routing protocol,
distance-vector protocols are most susceptible due to how they converge routes.
123. C. The Dijkstra algorithm is used by OSPF to calculate the shortest path based on
a cost calculation of the bandwidth of the link vs. distance vector, which is based on
hop count.
124. A. Link-state protocols such as OSPF require all routers to maintain their own
topology database of the network. This topology database is why routing loops are less
likely to occur. Distance-vector protocols don’t really have a topology of the network
and thus suffer from routing loops.
125. B. The Diffusing Update Algorithm, or DUAL, is used by EIGRP to calculate the
best route for the destination network.
126. B. Slow convergence of routing tables is a major disadvantage for distance-vector
protocols like RIP. It could take several announcement cycles before the entire
network registers a routing change.
127. D. OSPF employs Link-State-Announcement (LSA) flooding and triggered
updates. When these occur, every participating router will recalculate its routing
tables.
128. C. Link-state protocols, such as OSPF are best suited for large hierarchical
networks such as global networks, since they can separate out the participating

routers with areas and border area routers.
129. A. The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) use the Bellman-Ford routing
algorithm to calculate the shortest path based on distance. The distance is computed
from the shortest number of hops.
130. B. The use of holddown timers allows the convergence of the network routing
tables. This is used to hold down changes to the routing table before convergence can
happen and a routing decision is hastily made by RIP.
131. D. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an exterior gateway routing protocol,
which is used on the exterior of your network.
132. C. Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is a Cisco proprietary
interior gateway protocol.
133. C. Interior routing protocols are used internally inside of a network. The
functional difference is that IGPs exchange information within an autonomous
system, and EGPs exchange information between autonomous systems.
134. A. Routers are grouped into the same autonomous system (AS). When they are
within the same AS, they can exchange information such as routes to destination
networks and converge their routing tables.
135. B. Interior gateway protocols function within an administrative domain. This
administrative domain is defined with a common autonomous system number or area
ID.
136. D. The only time you need to use an exterior gateway protocol such as Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP) is when you have a dual-homed connection between two
ISPs. An example of this would be routing between the Internet and Internet 2. You
would need to know the fastest path to the destination network via the Internet
connection.
137. A. In order to use BGP to advertise a route, you must obtain an ASN, or
autonomous system number, from IANA.
138. C. BGP uses the entire database of entries to calculate the entire autonomous
system path to the destination. Then it routes the packet to the next router, which
performs the same calculation using the shortest AS path or the least number of ASs
the packet must traverse.
139. B. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is an interior gateway protocol and a
nonproprietary standard.
140. B. Although you have different administrative units, all of the administrative
units are in the same company. In this situation, it is recommended to use an interior
gateway protocol that can segment each administrative unit. OSPF will perform this
requirement with the use of area IDs.
141. C. The command show ipv6 interfaces brief will show all of the IPv6 addresses

configured for each of the interfaces on the router.
142. C. The network ID of 2000:0db8:4400:2300::/64 will be calculated and assigned
to the directly connected route of Serial 0/0.
143. B. The second address on an interface with the prefix of ff80::/64 is the link-local
address for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) and Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration (SLAAC). Link-local addresses are non-routable, so they will not get
added to the routing table.
144. A. The command show ipv6 route will display only the entries in the routing
table for IPv6. The command show ip route will only display the entries in the routing
table for IPv4.
145. C. You will need two route statements, one on each router. Each route should
point to the far side network through the serial interface. Since the IP address is an
IPv6 address, the easier way to configure the routes is to direct the packets to the exit
interface of Serial 0/3/0.
146. B. The command show ipv6 route connected will display only the directly
connected routes on the router.
147. C. The route statement ipv6 route ::/0 serial 0/3/0 will route any network
that is unknown by Router B to Router A via the exit interface of Serial 0/3/0.
148. D. You will need two route statements, one on each router. Each route points to
the far side network through the gateway in the ff80::/64 network. Router A has a
gateway of ff80::ff:f200:2/64 to the 2001:db8:4:/64 network, and Router B has a
gateway of ff80::ff:f200:1/64 to the 2001:db8:400/64 network.
149. B. The backup route to network 192.168.3.0/24 is though the gateway of
192.168.2.6. However, the administrative distance of a normal static route is 1. So the
AD must be higher than RIP, which is 120. An AD of 220 is higher than 90, so the RIP
route will be the main route and the static route will become the backup floating
route.
150. C. The command ipv6 address autoconfig default configures the interface of
Serial 0/3/0 with an IP address via SLAAC. When the default subcommand is used, it
allows the router to inherit the default route discovered via NDP RS/RA messages.
151. A. Area 0 must be present in an OSPF network. It is the backbone area and all
other areas must connect to it.
152. C. Router A is on the boundary of the autonomous system, which OSPF manages,
therefore it is an autonomous system boundary router, or ASBR.
153. B. OSPF uses 224.0.0.5 for neighbor discovery via Link-State Advertisements
(LSAs).
154. A. Routers C, D, and E are called area border routers, or ABRs. They border both
the backbone area and areas 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

155. D. OSPF updates are event triggered. These events could be a neighbor router not
responding or a route going down.
156. B. The highest IP address configured on all of the loopback interfaces is chosen
first. If a loopback is not configured, then the highest IP address on an active interface
is chosen. However, if a RID is statically set via the OSPF process, it will override all of
the above.
157. C. A link is a routed interface that is assigned to a network and participates in the
OSPF process. This link will be tracked by the OSPF process for up/down information
as well as the network it is associated with.
158. B. Adjacencies are formed between the designated router (DR) and its neighbors
on the same LAN. This is done to ensure that all neighbor routers have the same Link
State Database (LSDB).
159. D. The designated router is elected by the highest priority in the LAN. If the
priorities are all the same, then the highest RID becomes the tiebreaker. OSPF will
elect a DR for each broadcast network, such as a LAN. This is to minimize the number
of adjacencies formed.
160. B. The neighborship database is where all of the routers can be found that have
responded to hello packets. The neighborship database contains all of the routers by
RID, and each router participating in OSPF manages its own neighborship database.
161. C. OSPF uses areas to create a hierarchal structure for routing. This structure
begins with the backbone area of 0. All other areas connect to it to form a complete
autonomous system. This enables scalability with OSPF, since each area works
independently.
162. D. A LAN is an example of a broadcast multi-access network. All nodes in a
network segment can hear a broadcast and have common access to the local area
network. In OSPF, a broadcast (multi-access) network requires a DR and BDR.
163. C. The multicast address of 224.0.0.6 is used to communicate between the
designated router and the adjacencies formed. This multicast address is used for LSA
flooding on broadcast networks.
164. A. Cisco uses a metric for OSPF which is calculated as 108/bandwidth. This cost
value is of 100 Mb/s (reference bandwidth) divided by the interface bandwidth.
165. A. The command router ospf 20 configures a process ID of 20. This process
identifies the databases for an OSPF process as well as its configuration. The process
ID is only locally significant to the router on which it is configured. It can be an
arbitrary number from 1 to 65535.
166. B. The command show interface will display the reported bandwidth or
configured bandwidth of an interface. The command show ospf interface will only
display the calculated cost.

167. D. When you’re configuring Cisco routers to participate in OSPF with non-Cisco
routers, each interface on the Cisco router needs to be configured. The ip ospf cost
command can be tuned between 1 to 65,535 and will need to be matched with the
other vendor.
168. D. The first command sets up the process ID of 1 via router ospf 1. The next
command advertises the network of 192.168.1.0 with a wildcard-mask of 0.0.0.255 and
specifies area 0 via network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0.
169. A. By default, Cisco routes will load-balance four equal-cost routes with OSPF.
170. C. The wildcard mask is 0.0.31.255 for a network advertisement of 131.40.32.0/27.
A wildcard mask is a bitwise calculation that matches the bits that change. The /27 has
subnets with multiples of 32. The easiest way to calculate wildcard masks for
configuration is to subtract 1 from the subnet you are trying to match; for example,
matching a subnet of 32 in the third octet minus 1 equals 31, and you want to match
all bits in the fourth octet with 255.
171. D. The command maximum-paths 10 will configure a maximum of 10 routes of
equal-cost for load balancing. This command must be entered under the OSPF router
process.
172. D. The maximum number of equal-cost routes that can be configured for load
balancing with OSPF on a Cisco router is 32.
173. A. The command show ip ospf will allow you to verify the currently configured
router ID (RID) or the IP address acting as the router’s RID.
174. C. The wildcard mask is 0.0.0.15 for a network advertisement of 192.168.1.16/28.
A wildcard mask is a bitwise calculation that matches the bits that change. The /28 has
subnets with multiples of 16. The easiest way to calculate wildcard masks for
configuration is to subtract 1 from the subnet you are trying to match; for example,
matching a subnet of 16 in the fourth octet minus 1 equals 15.
175. A. The command show ip ospf neighbor will show all of the adjacencies formed
as well as the routers discovered.
176. B. The default hello interval is 10 seconds for a broadcast (multi-access) network
such as a LAN.
177. B. The command passive-interface gigabitethernet 0/1 must be configured
under the router process. This command will suppress hello packets from exiting the
Gi0/1 interface.
178. C. The command show ip ospf interface will show all interfaces in which OSPF
is configured and sending hello packets.
179. D. Although all of these are valid methods of possibly setting the router ID (RID)
of the router for OSPF, the configuration of router-id 192.168.1.5 will override all
others.

180. C. The command passive-interface default configured under the OSPF process
will cease hello packets by default on all interfaces. The command no passive-
interface gigabitethernet 0/2 will allow hello packets to exit the interface and allow
Gi0/2 to become a neighbor.
181. A. After the OSPF configuration is changed, OSPF needs to be restarted. This is
achieved at the privileged exec prompt by typing clear ip ospf.
182. D. Type 3 Link-State Advertisements contain summary information about the
networks on the other side of the ABR. These LSA announcements are called
Summary Link Advertisements, or SLAs.
183. B. The network IDs of 128.24.1.0/24, 128.24.2.0/24, 128.24.3.0/24, and
128.24.4.0/24 can be summarized as 128.24.1.0/22. The wildcard-mask for /22 is
0.0.252.255.
184. A. The command show ip ospf database will show you a summary count of all
the LSAs in the database.
185. D. Interface GigabitEthernet 0/0 is not participating because it is in a different
network than what the wildcard mask is advertising. The wildcard mask of 0.0.0.63 is
a /26 network mask with the range of 197.234.3.0 to 197.234.3.63. The interface Gi0/0
is in the 197.234.3.64/26 network and therefore will not participate.
186. C. The default hello interval on a LAN is 10 seconds. If a router is configured with
a hello timer of 30, the hello/dead interval will not match. In order to form an
adjacency, the hello/dead intervals must match.
187. A. Fast convergence of the Link State Database (LSDB) that feeds the routing
tables, is a direct result of a hierarchical OSPF design. The use of areas allows for
routers within an area to converge and send Summary Link Advertisements to other
areas.
188. B. Designated routers are only elected on broadcast (multi-access) networks such
as a LAN. The router with the highest IP address will become the designated router.
Since Router B has an IP address of 192.168.10.2/30, 192.168.10.5/30, and
192.168.2.1/24, it will become the DR.
189. B. Router B is called the area border router since it sits between two areas of area
0 and area 1.
190. C. The wildcard mask is incorrect because it is a bitmask, which is the opposite of
a subnet mask. The 1s in the host section, rather than 1s in the network section, define
the wildcard. The correct wildcard mask is 0.0.0.255 for this configuration.
191. A. In order to form an adjacency, the area IDs must match as well as the hello and
dead timers. If the hello timer is changed on one router, it must be changed on the
other router to form an adjacency.
192. A. The FULL state is only achieved after the router has created an adjacency with

a neighbor router and downloaded the LSAs to form its topological database.
193. D. Both routers have formed an adjacency. However, the LSDB on each router has
not yet been fully synchronized. Once the LSDBs have been synchronized, the state
will become FULL and OSPF will calculate costs.
194. C. The command ip ospf cost 25 should be configured on the interface that will
act as the backup route. This adjustment of cost will allow the router to prefer the
other route first.
195. D. The router ID of 192.168.2.2 is neither a designated router nor a backup
designated router. Since it is neither, it will only form an adjacency with the DR or
BDR and will participate in future elections.
196. B. The command ip ospf priority 10 will change the interface’s default priority
of 1 to 10. This router will always become the designated router on the LAN.
197. A. The command show ip ospf interfaces will display the interface details of
each interface for OSPF. In this information, the DR and BDR router ID will be
displayed.
198. D. In order to form an adjacency, the area IDs must match. In this exhibit, Router
A has an area of 0 and Router B has an area of 1 configured.
199. C. The command default-information originate will propagate a default route
originating from router 172.16.1.1. All OSPF routers will calculate their default routes
back to this router.
200. A. Bandwidth is always specified in kilobits per second (Kb/s), so 2.048 Mb/s
would be 2,048,000 bits per second, or 2,048 Kb/s.
201. C. Both routers have passive interfaces for OSPF. In order to fix this, the
command no passive-interface serial 0/0 would need to be entered. This
command would need to be configured in the OSPF router process.
202. A. The command show ip protocols will list the router ID of the current router
as well as the networks that are being advertised via OSPF on the current router.
203. C. An area defines a topology inside of the OSPF hierarchy. Since each router in
an area calculates its own costs, they all contain the same topological database, or
LSDB.
204. D. All routers by default have an OSPF priority of 1. If you set the priority to 0,
the router will never become a designated router. This command must be set in the
interface.
205. A. It identifies the administrative distance of 110 for OSPF. The cost calculation is
the reference bandwidth of 100 Mb/s divided by the link bandwidth. This calculation
would result in a cost of 1.
206. C. The command ipv6 router ospf 4 will start an IPv6 process with an ID of 4.

Most IPv6 commands will start with ipv6.
207. A. OSPFv3 used the multicast address ff02::6 to send communications to
designated routers.
208. C. When an OSPFv3 process is configured, the process will handle IPv6.
However, the router ID is still configured as an IPv4 address.
209. B. With OSPFv3 IPv6 configuration, the duplication of long IPv6 network
addresses can cause erroneous entries. So OSPFv3 is configured directly on the IPv6
link with the command ipv6 ospf 4 area 0.
210. A. Configuring OSPFv3 for a passive interface it is similar to configuring OSPFv2.
However, the configuration prompt for IPv6 is Router(config-rtr)#.
211. B. The easiest way to achieve this is to change the reference bandwidth from 100
Mb/s to 10 Gb/s. This is done as a command in the OSPFv3 router process with the
command auto-cost reference-bandwidth 10000. This will adjust the reference-
bandwidth for all links associated with this process ID.
212. B. OSPFv3 used the multicast address ff02::5 to send hello packets to neighbor
routers.
213. D. The command show ipv6 route ospf will display only the OSPFv3 routes.
214. B. The command show ipv6 ospf interface will display numerous stats about
the interfaces participating in OSPFv3. One of the stats is the hello/dead timers.
215. B. IPv4 allows for packet fragmentation. However, IPv6 does not fragment
packets because at the layer 3 header there is no fragmentation functionality. So close
attention needs to be made to link MTUs on adjacent neighbors.
216. D. The configuration of OSPFv3 for IPv6 is always done on the interface. Area 0
can be represented as 0.0.0.0, because the area as defined by the RFC is a 32-bit value.
The Cisco IOS allows you to enter the last octet of the area or the whole 32-bit value.
217. C. You must enable IPv6 routing via the command ipv6 unicast-routing in order
to use OSPFv3.
218. B. The command show ipv6 ospf 5 will only show the OSPFv3 process ID of 5.
219. A. The hello interval timer is configured per the interface, since broadcast (multi-
access) would apply to a LAN interface vs. a non-broadcast multiple access (NBMA)
network interface. The command no ipv6 ospf hello-interval will set the hello
timer back to the original default value.
220. A. The command to restart the OSPFv3 process is performed at the privileged
exec command prompt. The command to be entered for OSPFv3 would be clear ipv6
ospf process. You will then be asked to confirm it.
221. C. When you’re configuring an area border router, only one OSPF process is
required. Both areas are added to the same process ID.

222. B. Router C is misconfigured. If it was configured properly, it would show as a
neighbor when the show ipv6 ospf neighbors command is used.
223. C. When you configure the command ipv6 ospf 1 area 0 on an IPv4 interface,
the IP address on the interface is used as the router ID.
224. A. Unlike OSPFv2, OSPFv3 will advertise all of the networks that are configured
on a link in which OSPFv3 is configured. This replaces the need to use the network
command, which is used in OSPFv2.
225. B. Both routers have the same router-ID configured and therefore cannot become
neighbors and form an adjacency.
226. D. Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is a Cisco proprietary
dynamic routing protocol. Only Cisco routers can participate in EIGRP.
227. A. EIGRP can use bandwidth, delay, load, reliability, and MTU as the cost metrics.
Default configuration of EIGRP only uses bandwidth and delay as the cost metrics,
although others can be configured.
228. C. A requirement for routers to become neighbors is matching K metrics. The K
metrics are values that can be adjusted for the EIGRP metrics of bandwidth, delay,
load, reliability, and MTU.
229. C. The Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP), which is part of EIGRP, uses 224.0.0.10
to send hello messages.
230. A. The default metric calculation for EIGRP is metric = ((107 / least-bandwidth)
+ cumulative-delay) * 256.
231. B. A neighbor requirement is matching autonomous system numbers. The
autonomous system number is EIGRP’s scalability mechanism.
232. B. EIGRP has a default hop count of 100 hops before a packet is considered
unroutable.
233. D. EIGRP uses AS numbers to segment routing updates to an autonomous
system. This provides scalability of the EIGRP routing protocol.
234. A. The default hello timer for EIGRP is 5 seconds. This is performed by RTP.
235. C. Upon forming an adjacency with its neighbor, EIGRP neighboring routers will
send their entire database. After the initial load of the database, each router will watch
for updates.
236. C. The default hop count is 100 for EIGRP. However, the maximum stable hop
count is 255 hops before a route is considered undeliverable.
237. A. Hello packets and the RTP table help to build the neighbor table. In return, the
neighbor table sends this information to the topology table.
238. B. If an established neighbor does not respond to its multicast hello packet, the

router will send unicast packets. After 16 missed unicast packets, the neighbor will be
declared dead. This process is called reliable multicast.
239. C. When the hold interval has expired and a hello message has not been seen, the
neighboring router is considered down or failed.
240. A. By default, EIGRP can load balance up to 4 equal-cost links.
241. D. EIGRP uses the Diffusing Update Algorithm to calculate route cost.
242. B. After the neighbor process has been established, the routers will exchange full
topology tables with each other. These topology tables are sent in full, then
maintained only by partial updates if a route changes.
243. B. The cost of the link between routing protocols is irrelevant. The administrative
distance (AD) of EIGRP is 90, and the AD of OSPF is 110. Therefore, the lowest AD
routing protocol is used. If the EIGRP route becomes invalid or is removed from the
routing table, then OSPF will be used.
244. B. The EIGRP hold interval by default is three times the hello interval. Since the
hello interval is 5 seconds, the hold interval is 15 seconds. Hold intervals are usually
three times the initial discovery interval.
245. D. EIGRP metrics are not based on hops. EIGRP metrics are based on bandwidth
and delay as a composite metric. The metric can be a very large number, but the limit
to this metric in which the route is considered invalid is 232 – 1.
246. D. EIGRP only sends updates if a route has changed. Updates happen only after
two routers have become neighbors and originally send their full route database and
converge. If changes have not occurred, then the neighbor believes the route is still
valid, under the condition that they are still neighbors.
247. A. When a router acknowledges a hello packet from a neighboring router, the
router is added to the neighbor table of the router that sent the hello packet.
248. B. Although two routers can have different hello/hold intervals, they could still
become neighbors. However, to do so they must be on the same subnet.
249. B. The reported distance is the remote router’s calculated metric for the remote
network. EIGRP uses this reported distance in its calculation for a feasible successor
route.
250. C. After DUAL calculates the metrics of the topology table, a successor route is
calculated using the feasible distance. This route is populated into the routing table. A
feasible successor route is also calculated based upon the reported distance and
feasible distance.
251. B. The topology table is used to calculate the feasible distance of a remote
network. The DUAL routing algorithm interacts with the topology table to calculate
this metric.

252. A. Serial interfaces will default to 1.544 Mb/s. They will not auto-correct the
actual bandwidth. Therefore, changing the bandwidth between Router A and Router B
will allow EIGRP to calculate the best route through Router C. This is done by using
the bandwidth command and specifying bandwidth in Kb/s.
253. C. The command to configure EIGRP with an ASN of 20 is router eigrp 20.
254. B. The default variance is a value of 1 by default. This is because the variance is a
multiplier that is applied to the feasible distance. All EIGRP routers multiply the
feasible distance by 1 by default.
255. B. The command eigrp router-id 2.2.2.2 configured in the sub-command of
the router process will change the router ID to 2.2.2.2.
256. B. The command no auto-summary will stop the router process of EIGRP from
auto-summarizing network addresses. In a discontiguous network, this is problematic
and should be turned off.
257. A. The command network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 will advertise the network of
192.168.1.0/24 for EIGRP with an ASN of 20. The .0.0.255 is a wildcard mask and
matches bits in the last octet of the IP address.
258. D. The autonomous system numbers do not match. Router A has an ASN of 10
and Router B has an ASN of 20.
259. D. The command show ip eigrp neighbors will allow you to inspect the routers
that have created an adjacency with the current router you are working on.
260. A. The command show ip protocols will allow you to see specifics about the
configured routing protocols. In the details of the output will be the K metrics for
EIGRP.
261. C. The command passive-interface serial 0/0 configured inside the router
process for EIGRP will set the Serial 0/0 as a passive interface. This will suppress
EIGRP hello packets exiting the interface.
262. B. The command show ip eigrp topology will allow you to see the calculated
metrics for routes inside of the EIGRP topology table. For each network, the number
of successors will be displayed. This information will help verify a feasible successor
for a particular network.
263. B. The variance command is configured in the router instance of EIGRP. The
command variance 2 configures the router variance with a multiplier of 2.
264. C. The command no passive-interface serial 0/0 is used when either passive-
interface serial 0/0 or passive-interface default has been used in the router
instance.
265. B. The K metrics must match to allow Router A and Router B to form an
adjacency. Router A has a K metric of K2=0 and Router B has a K metric of K2=1.

266. B. The routing table shows a path on Router A to 192.168.4.0/24 via 192.168.2.6.
The IP address is configured on Router C, therefore the path will be Router A to
Router C to Router B to the destination network.
267. D. Auto-summarization is configured by default with EIGRP. Since there are
several networks in the 172.16.0.0/22 address range on Router A, they will be
summarized. On Router B there is the network 172.16.4.0/24, which would be part of
the summarization of the 172.16.0.0/22 network. Since the serial connection is a
noncontiguous network, auto-summarization will prohibit proper routing operation.
268. B. The protocol-dependent module (PDM) allows for multiple protocols to be
supported with EIGRP. This allows for the same algorithm and methodology to be
applied and for PDM-compliant modules such as IPv6, IP, and IPX to be used.
269. C. The command to configure the K metrics back to their default setting is no
metric weights. This command should be entered in the router instance. The default
metrics are K1=1, K2=0, K3=1, K4=0, K5=0.
270. A. The command show ip protocols will display the networks that are being
advertised on the current router.
271. C. The multicast address for neighbor discovery for EIGRPv6 is ff02::a.
272. C. The ipv6 unicast-routing command must be entered first to enable the IPv6
protocol stack for routing.
273. A. The command no shutdown must be entered in the router instance to start
EIGRPv6. By default, it is shut down.
274. C. When configuring EIGRPv6 to avoid erroneous duplication of IPv6 addresses,
the interface is added to the EIGRPv6 routing process. This advertises all networks
that are configured on the interface.
275. C. The command router-id 1.1.1.1 is required for EIGRPv6 operations. This
command must be configured in the EIGRPv6 routing instance. The IPv4 address is
the router’s ID, since EIGRPv6 requires an IPv4 router ID.
276. B. The command to restrict hello packets from exiting the serial 0/0 interface is
passive-interface serial 0/0 entered in the EIGRPv6 router instance.
277. D. The command show ipv6 protocols will display the routing protocols running
with IPv6. In the output of the EIGRPv6 instance, the K metrics will be displayed.
Although show running-configuration will display the configured K-metrics, it will
not show the default configuration.
278. D. The command show ipv6 eigrp neighbors will display the adjacencies the
router has made with other EIGRPv6 routers.
279. B. The command show ipv6 route eigrp will display only the EIGRPv6 routes.
280. D. The command show ipv6 protocols will display the routing protocols for

IPv6. Included in this output are the interfaces participating in EIGRPv6.
281. D. The command ipv6 hello-interval eigrp 10 5 will change the hello timer. It
must be entered in the interface on which you want to change the hello interval.
282. A. Interfaces for EIGRP must be on the same subnet for an adjacency to form.
However, that is not a requirement for EIGRPv6.
283. B. The command show ipv6 eigrp topology will allow you to verify the metrics.
From this, you can calculate the variance multiplier for unequal-cost load balancing.
284. A. The packets will take the path of Router A to Switch A to Switch B to Router B,
since the feasible distance is lower, by taking the path of the switches. Although
interface Gi0/0 on Router A and Gi0/0 on Router B are not in the same subnet, the
link-local interfaces are used for routing the packets.
285. B. By configuring the command passive-interface gi 0/0 in each router
instance, you can prohibit the two routers from creating an adjacency across the
Ethernet link. This will not hinder the advertisement of networks attached to the
interface as long as the command ipv6 eigrp 10” is configured on the interfaces.
286. A. The maximum hop count for RIP is 15. A hop count over 15 hops is considered
unroutable or unreachable.
287. C. By default, RIPv2 multicasts the full routing table on all active interfaces every
30 seconds.
288. C. RIPv2 uses hop count to calculate routes. When a router sends its routing
table, the next router adds a +1 to the metric for the entries in the table.
289. B. RIPv2 uses the multicast address of 224.0.0.9 to advertise routes.
290. D. When you’re configuring RIP on a router, the RIP process will default to
RIPv1, which is classful. The command version 2 must be configured in the router
instance of RIP to allow for RIPv2.
291. A. The command network 192.168.1.0 will configure the RIPv2 route process to
advertise the network 192.168.1.0.
292. A. The command show ip protocols will display the next interval when RIPv2
advertisements are sent out.
293. B. The command show ip rip database will display all of the discovered routes
and their calculated metrics.
294. D. The command default-information originate will advertise the default route
to all other RIPv2 routers.
295. D. The command debug ip rip will allow you to see advertisements in real time.
296. B. The three Class C networks need to be advertised separately. RIPv2 uses the
default class network mask when configuring networks.

297. C. The command passive-interface serial 0/0 configured in the router
instance will suppress updates from exiting interface Serial 0/0.
298. C. The default invalid timer for RIP is 180 seconds. This holddown timer is six
times the advertisement interval of 30 seconds.
299. B. RIPv2 has extremely slow convergence time. This is because the advertisement
of routes is every 30 seconds. So a router four hops away potentially could take 120
seconds before discovering the route.
300. A. Split horizons are used to stop routing loops with RIPv2. Split horizons
prevent a router from advertising a route to a router in which the original route was
discovered.
301. C. RIPv2 uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to calculate its metrics.
302. D. The command no auto-summary will stop the router process of RIPv2 from
auto-summarizing network addresses. In a discontiguous network, this is problematic
and should be turned off.
303. B. Configuring RIPv2 begins with configuration of the router instance of RIP via
the command router rip. RIPv2 is configured inside of the router instance with the
command version 2. Then the network of 192.168.20.0/24 is advertised with the
command network 192.168.20.0.
304. B. The holddown timer’s job is to allow the network to stabilize after a route had
become unreachable via an update. This limits the potential problems related to a
flapping port and allows RIPv2 to converge route updates in the entire network.
305. B. To route packets over the higher-speed link, you would need to configure a
static route for both Router A and Router B. If these links would go down, then the
lower-speed link would become active. This is due to administrative distance.
306. B. The default number of routes that RIPv2 will load balance is a total of 4.
307. D. RIPng is the next generation of the RIP protocol for use with IPv6.
308. B. The command show ip rip database will display the routes being advertised
by RIPv2. These routes will be identified with the directly connected statement.
309. B. The command ip spilt-horizon configured on the interface will configure
split-horizon processing for RIPv2.
310. D. The route will be flushed from the routing table after 240 seconds. The flush
timer should be 60 seconds higher than the invalid timer of 180 seconds.
311. B. The ping command will allow basic connectivity testing at layer 3.
312. D. The command traceroute will allow you to verify the path on which a packet
gets routed.
313. C. The ARP request took time for the ARP reply, and during this time, the ICMP

timeout threshold was exceeded. This is common on a router, and the following pings
should not time out unless the ARP entry is cleared after its TTL expires.
314. C. The command ipconfig /all will help you verify the IP address, subnet mask,
default gateway, and MAC address of your computer. The command of ipconfig
doesn’t show the MAC address.
315. A. The Windows command for tracing a route is tracert.
316. B. When you see an exclamation mark, it means that the packets were
successfully acknowledged on the other side and an ICMP response was received.
317. C. The extended ping command allows you to specify a number of parameters
such as repeat count, datagram size, and source address or exit interface. There are
several other parameters that can be adjusted.
318. C. The three times are the minimum response time, average response time, and
maximum response time of the ICMP Echo and Reply.
319. A. The IP address or hostname entered in privileged exec mode will create a direct
Telnet request. Alternatively, you can specify the command telnet 198.56.33.3.
320. D. The command show ip interface brief will display only the necessary
information of interface, IP, and status to aid in the diagnostic process.
321. A. The normal ping command will achieve this task. Originally in Windows XP,
the commandping6 was used in lieu of the command ping. The command ping6 is also
found in Linux. However, today, most operating systems have extended the ping
command to both IPv4 and IPv6.
322. A. The command show ipv6 neighbors will display all of the neighboring routers
that have sent a Router Advertisement message. This cache will normally contain the
link-local addresses of the neighboring routers.

Chapter 4: WAN Technologies (Domain 4)
1. B. High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) is the default encapsulation on a serial
connection for Cisco.
2. B. The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is an open standard. Cisco routers default to
the HDLC protocol. However, HDLC is a proprietary standard for Cisco. So PPP should
be used for compatibility.
3. B. The Network Control Protocol (NCP) works at layer 3 tagging the network
protocols from end to end when PPP is used. This gives PPP the ability to offer multi-
protocol transport.
4. A. The command encapsulation ppp configures the serial interface with the Point to
Point Protocol (PPP). PPP is an encapsulation protocol.
5. C. The Link Control Protocol (LCP) provides the authentication phase of a PPP
connection.
6. B. The High-Level Data Link Control protocol is used as the encapsulation method
for serial links. This protocol is the open standard HDLC compared to the native
Cisco-proprietary version.
7. C. The Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) works by sending a
random number called the challenge. This challenge is received by the authenticating
router and used to hash the password. The password is transferred to the challenging
router and authenticates the authenticating router.
8. C. The Link Control Protocol provides the facility for multilink connections.
9. A. MultiLink PPP simplifies layer 3 configuration. It does this by bundling the
connections together at layer 2. It provides a pseudo interface representing the
individual interface where all layer 3 configuration is applied.
10. A. The pseudo interface must be created first with the command interface
multilink 1. Then the encapsulation must be set to PPP with encapsulation ppp. The
ppp multilink command configures the ability to use multilink for the encapsulation
of PPP. Then the IP address is configured. Last, the ppp multilink group 1 command
associates the interface multilink 1 with the multilink group to be used for bundling.
11. B. The command show ppp multilink will display the active links of a multilink
connection.
12. B. The first step is to set the username of RouterB to use for authentication via
username RouterB password cisco. Then enter the interface and configure
authentication with the command ppp authentication chap pap.
13. A. The command debug ppp authentication will allow you to watch the
authentication exchange between two routers in real time. This will help you diagnose
an authentication problem between two routers.

14. B. The command show ppp all will show the current authentication protocol used
between two routers. The output will look similar to this:
Se0/3/0 LCP+ CHAP+ IPCP+ CDPC> LocalT 192.168.1.1 RouterB
15. D. The LCP closed line states that the LCP process has not completed. This could
be due to numerous reasons, such as conflicting options or authentication failure.
16. B. The command ppp authentication chap pap will configure PPP authentication.
The first authentication protocol is preferred, and if that protocol is not supported,
then authentication will fall back to PAP.
17. C. Serial interface 0/3/1 has a mismatched multilink group. All multilink group
numbers should match the multilink group specified in the multilink interface.
18. D. This configuration has an encapsulation mismatch. Router A is configured to
use the PPP encapsulation protocol. Router B is defaulted to the HDLC protocol
because no encapsulation is configured.
19. C. Layer 2 functionality such as authentication is configured on the interfaces in
the bundle. Layer 3 configuration is on the multilink interface, such as the IP address
of the bundle.
20. D. The passwords do not match on both routers. Passwords configured on routers
are case sensitive. Router A’s password begins with a lowercase c and Router B’s
begins with an uppercase C. The IP addresses on Router A and Router B do not match,
but this will not hinder the PPP link to be formed.
21. A. Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) is used for DSL connections.
PPPoE allows CHAP to be used to authenticate users over an Ethernet network that is
configured on the customer side.
22. B. The MTU for PPPoE should be set to 1,492 bytes. Normal MTU size is 1,500, but
when PPPoE is used, there is an overhead of 2 bytes for PPP and 6 bytes for the PPPoE
headers. 1500 bytes – 8 overhead bytes = 1,492 bytes MTU for data.
23. A. Internal connections between the customer router and the ISP router do not get
configured with IP addresses. The customer-side interface can be configured with an
IP address or it can be configured via DHCP from the ISP side.
24. D. When PPPoE is configured, the dialer interface serves as the exit interface. The
command ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 dialer 1 will configure the gateway of last
resort to the ISP.
25. C. The command show pppoe session will display all of the interfaces involved
with the PPPoE establishment and shows the status of each interface.
26. C. The Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) is an NCP protocol that is
responsible for configuring the IP address on the PPPoE client.
27. A. The PPP authentication is configured on the interface Dialer1 for PPPoE. The

interface Dialer1 passes the LCP authentication information to the ISP router during
the authentication phase of PPPoE.
28. A. Router A does not have the correct hostname configured. The hostname that the
aggregation router (Router B) is expecting is client with a password of ccna. The
hostname of the aggregation router is only locally significant to the aggregation
router.
29. C. The command show pppoe summary entered on the aggregation router (ISP
router) will show you how many PPPoE sessions are terminated (active) on the router.
30. D. The state of PTA stands for PPP Termination Aggregation. This means that the
client has successfully created and terminated a PPPoE session with this router.
31. C. The dialer pool value configured on the interface Dialer1 must match the
pppoe-client dial-pool-number value configured on interface GigabitEthernet 0/2.
The interface of Dialer1 does not need to match the dialer pool and dial-pool-number.
32. B. The command ip local pool poolname 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.254 configures
a local IP pool with a name of poolname. The address range is configured first with the
starting address of 192.168.1.2 (leaving 192.168.1.1 for the router) to 192.168.1.254, the
end of the range.
33. D. The passwords on Router A and Router B do not match. Router A has a
password of ccna and Router B (aggregation router) expects CCNA. Passwords are case
sensitive and therefore the two routers will not create a session.
34. B. When using PPPoE, the MTU is smaller than the standard 1,500 MTU on
Ethernet. If attention is not taken to the MTU, it can be problematic.
35. C. The authentication protocol on Router A and Router B does not match. Router A
has an authentication protocol of PAP, and Router B (aggregation router) has an
authentication protocol of CHAP configured. The authentication protocols must match
or the two routers will not create a session.
36. D. GRE tunnels provide packet-in-packet encapsulation. It takes the original IP
packet and encapsulates it, adding another IP packet for the GRE tunnel. GRE tunnels
alone do not provide any encryption.
37. A. Generic Routing Encapsulation is a Cisco proprietary standard for encapsulating
layer 3 protocols over an IP network, such as the Internet.
38. C. GRE uses the layer 3 protocol 47, which is the protocol that is stated in the layer
3 header.
39. C. The network is un-routable, since interface G0/1 on Router A is configured with
a 192.168.1.0/24 network, and interface G0/1 on Router B is configured with a
192.168.1.0/24. The route statement that needs to be configured will not pass any
traffic since 192.168.1.0/24 is directly configured on both routers.
40. D. The correct route statement is ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0

192.168.2.2, because the network of 192.168.2.0/24 is built between these two
routers. The tunnel acts as a routed interface between the routers.
41. A. The maximum transmission unit of a GRE tunnel is 1,476, because there are 24
bytes of overhead for the GRE header—20 bytes are used by the public IP header and 4
bytes are used for GRE.
42. B. The command show interface tunnel 0 will show in the output the source and
destination of the tunnel.
43. A. If a traceroute is performed to 192.168.3.50 on Router A, it will show one hop.
This is because the 192.168.3.0 network is on the other side of the tunnel interface,
which is one hop away.
44. C. The routes are wrong. They should be set to the destination of the opposite
tunnel IP address.
45. B. The Next Hop Router Protocol (NHRP) is responsible for resolving and directing
traffic for Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN) traffic.
46. C. The default keepalive time is 10 seconds. The keepalive allows both adjoining
routers to know when the connection should be turned to a down state so routing
protocols can choose a new route.
47. B. A T1 is a leased line from the phone company that is a dedicated point-to-point
connection between two facilities. T1 lines are serial communications lines, which
guarantees a bandwidth of 1.544 Mb/s between two locations.
48. C. The problem is a layer 2 problem because both routers are in an UP/DOWN
state for the connecting serial interfaces. Router A has a protocol of HDLC configured
and Router B has a protocol of PPP configured.
49. B. A fault-tolerant connection to a single ISP would be a dual-homed connection.
With a dual-homed connection, two dedicated lines will terminate from the ISP to
your facility. If one line were to fail, the other would be the fault-tolerant line.
50. A. A single-homed connection will provide no fault tolerance in the event of an
outage of the line itself at the ISP.
51. C. The keepalive function on a serial interface helps the router notice when a
connection no longer functions. The router can then bring the interface to a DOWN
status and recalculate routes.
52. D. The problem is a layer 3 problem because both routers are in an UP/UP status
for the connecting serial interfaces. Therefore, the problem must be a mismatch of IP
addresses.
53. B. MultiLink Point-to-Point Protocol is used as a point-to-point connectivity
method. Although there are multiple connections, they are dual-homed to the same
locations.

54. A. The E-Tree services of Metro Ethernet allows for a root to be established to
serve the remote sites or leaf endpoints. The root can communicate to the leaf
endpoints and the leaf endpoints can communicate to the root. However, the leaf
endpoints cannot communicate to each other.
55. C. Ethernet Line services, or E-Line services, provided with Metro Ethernet, is a
dedicated point-to-point topology. This is commonly done with the use of an Ethernet
Virtual Circuit defined at the service provider.
56. D. E-LAN is a service of Metro Ethernet. It provides a full mesh capability between
endpoints. E-LAN services perform this by allowing all endpoints participating in E-
LAN to communicate with each other. This type of communication is normally found
on a common network LAN. This allows all sites to communicate with each other
while only requiring a single line to the point of presence (PoP).
57. B. The most common hub-and-spoke WAN design is the way an Internet service
provider is connected to their customers. The Internet connection is centrally located
in a common physical location of the Internet provider called the point-of-presence or
meet-me-room. All lines connect out from this point in a hub-and-spoke design.
58. B. The line status and the protocol status are both in a DOWN state. Since the
interface does not explicitly state it is administratively shut down, it is either a wiring
problem or a physical problem.
59. A. The command show controllers serial 0/0 will show the controller
configuration and status. If clocking is detected, you will see DTE V.35 TX and RX
clocks detected.
60. C. A T1 or DS1 comprises 24 DS0 channels at 64 kb/s. 24 × 64 = 1.536 Mb/s
(advertised as 1.544 Mb/s).
61. A. Point-to-Point over Ethernet (PPPoE) is a point-to-point technology. It creates a
connection between two facilities.
62. C. The command clock-rate 64000 will set the interface as a DCE interface and
provide a clock rate of 64000 bits per second.
63. D. The Telco provider network is responsible for providing clocking for data
alignment. If clocking is not detected, then the status of the interface will show as
DOWN/DOWN since this is considered a layer 1 requirement.
64. B. MultiLink Point to Point Protocol (MLPPP) is an example of a dual-homed
topology. This is because there are two links to the same location for aggregation of
bandwidth and failover.
65. B. Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN) is an example of a hub-and-spoke or point-
to-multipoint topology. All of the satellite connections terminate back to the central
location.
66. B. The requirement for multiple protocols is a compelling reason to use MPLS. The

protocols moving across MPLS nodes are irrelevant to the technology. This is because
layer 3 information is not examined to route packets.
67. C. The term customer edge defines the edge of the customer’s network. The router
at the customer’s edge is usually only responsible for routing packets to the provider
edge.
68. B. The field in the layer 3 header is called Differentiated Services, or DiffServ. The
value is an 8-bit Differentiated Services Code Point. This DSCP value helps classify
QoS for MPLS.
69. A. The term provider edge router is the router closest to the customer edge router.
This router is responsible for labeling traffic and redistribution of routing protocols
for the customer edge router.
70. D. Metro Ethernet provides a layer 2 connection between sites defined by the MEF
services. Distances are overcome by the use of fiber optics.
71. B. MPLS is referred to as a layer 2.5 protocol. This is because it shims a header
between the layer 2 and layer 3 protocols; the header contains the label for the traffic.
72. B. Date integrity is one of the benefits of using a secure VPN protocol. To ensure
its integrity, a packet is sealed with a hash which must equate to the same hash on the
other side when it is received and decrypted.
73. C. Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) devices are used to create VPN tunnels
between sites. ASA devices run the Cisco ASA software, which allows for firewall,
intrusion prevention, and VPNs among other security-related functions.
74. C. Since you have several remote workers who telecommute, the best connectivity
option would be client SSL/VPN connectivity. A product called Cisco AnyConnect
Secure Mobility Client allows for SSL encryption for VPN tunnels back to the main
site.
75. B. Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) connectivity typically uses PPPoE
to authenticate subscribers. The subscriber’s credentials are often relayed to a
RADIUS server for subscription checks.
76. C. The central office, sometimes referred to as the CO, is the local switching office.
The CO is where your data lines meet the public network for data and voice.
77. B. Private WANs secure transmissions of their clients by providing isolation
between them. It is up to the customer to use encryption for an added level of security,
depending on the nature of the business.
78. A. An EVC defines the endpoints inside of a Metro Ethernet network. These
endpoints are the customers’ sites in which traffic will flow.
79. B. Point of presence (PoP) is the term that defines the access point of the
provider’s services. These services might be Internet, private WAN, or cloud resources.

80. A. A Metro Ethernet E-LAN service allows for a full-mesh topology between all of
the sites. Since all of the sites are connected in a method similar to a layer 2 (LAN)
network, all of the routers will become neighbors. This is similar to having multiple
routers on a LAN.
81. A. MPLS providers typically use Multiprotocol-Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP)
internally. This is because MP-BGP can advertise multiple routes while allowing
logical separation between customers’ routes.
82. A. DSL access multipliers, or DSLAMs, share the local loop with analog phone
traffic to intercept communications from the DSL modem. DASLAMs provide the
switching of data to the Internet.
83. B. IPSec uses the Encapsulating Security Payload protocol to encrypt data.
84. C. Site-to-site IPSec VPNs offer scalability as a benefit. This is because each remote
office only needs an Internet connection to create a VPN tunnel back to the main
office.
85. A. Multiprotocol Label Switching allows for varied access links such as serial
leased lines, Frame Relay, Metro Ethernet, and so on. You can leverage the existing
connectivity methods to form a private WAN.
86. D. E-Tree services allow the root to talk to the leafs in the tree. The leafs cannot
forward traffic to each other without going through the root. Routing protocols are no
different in traffic patterns.
87. C. CE routers do not form adjacencies or neighbors (depending on protocol) with
other CE routers. They depend on PE routers and route redistribution of routing
protocols to receive their routing updates and tables.
88. B. Every area must connect back to the backbone area, or area 0. However, CE
routers cannot create neighborships with other sites. So the MPLS PE routers can
either extend area 0 or create the area 0 network, which is called a super backbone.
89. B. Service providers use policing on Ethernet virtual circuits to allow the customer
to burst up to the line’s potential bandwidth yet only allow sustained data rates
according to the contracted committed information rate (CIR).
90. B. Although all of these can be considerations for the customer, the largest impact
can be the access link technology used between the PE and CE routers. If the customer
uses Frame Relay, the QOS can be unusable because of discarded frames due to
congestion.
91. A. IPSec uses the Authentication Header protocol to check data integrity. This is
done by creating a numerical hash of the data via SHA1, SHA2, or MD5 algorithms.
92. B. ACLs are a major consideration since they are neither TCP nor UDP; they are a
layer 3 protocol of their own. The ACL required for the tunnel creation is permit gre
{source} {destination}, which would be for a named access list.

93. C. The CIR, or committed information rate, is the sustainable speed that the
customer can communicate on the Ethernet virtual circuit. This CIR is directly tied to
the price of the Monthly Recurring Charge (MRC), since the service provider must
dedicate this bandwidth for the customer agreement.
94. D. Metro Ethernet service providers employ policing of traffic on Ethernet virtual
circuits according to the committed information rate (CIR). The policing of traffic
discards any traffic over the CIR without prejudice to the type of traffic. Therefore, the
customer should shape traffic according to their preference of QoS on important
traffic so that important packets are not discarded by the provider during high
utilization.
95. B. The customer has the option to configure each site with a different Autonomous
System Number (ASN) for EIGRP, or they can configure all sites with the same ASN.
Regardless, the routes would be route redistributed from the internal Multiprotocol-
Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) process on the Provider Edge (PE) routers.
96. C. eBGP stands for external Border Gateway Protocol. It is the only protocol used
on the Internet to route traffic from one edge of the Internet to the other.
97. B. A major difference between iBGP and eBGP is that iBGP routers peer with other
iBGP routers in the same Autonomous System (AS), whereas eBGP routers peer with
other eBGP routers in different Autonomous Systems (ASs). iBGP routers will not
advertise routes learned within their common AS number.
98. C. BGP neighbors are formed via static neighbor assignment. BGP neighboring
routers will not form a neighborship without manual intervention.
99. A. EBGP is not very fast in terms of convergence, due to the volume of routes it
must handle and calculate. However, it is extremely scalable and that is why it is used
specifically for the routing functionality of the Internet.
100. B. EBGP uses path attributes to calculate best path selection. Rather than relying
on one metric, a number of calculations are derived from the path attributes, which
are updated with the network prefixes.
101. A. Best path algorithm is used with EBGP for path selection. The algorithm is a
path-vector-based algorithm. Path-vector algorithms closely resemble distance-vector
algorithms. However, with EBGP, there are about 14 pieces of criteria examined rather
than just hop count, although AS path count is weighted heavily in the decision
process.
102. C. Single-homed EBGP connections are found on the Internet edge. It is the link
connecting the enterprise structure with a single ISP.
103. C. EBGP tables are initially loaded and updated via TCP port 179 by peer routers
in a neighborship as well as by messages for peer setup. This is different than other
routing protocols that use layer 3 protocols. EBGP uses the layer 4 protocol TCP to
move data.

104. D. Only public address blocks such as 180.45.65.0/24 should be advertised with
EBGP. Subnets can be advertised, but often policies with your ISP will prohibit it.
Private IPs should not be advertised with EBGP and are usually filtered at the ISP.
105. B. In a single-homed Internet edge design, the default gateway will always be the
ISP’s router. Therefore, to reduce the load on the enterprise router, the default
gateway can be advertised as the ISP router.
106. A. The command router bgp 2001 will start a router process of BGP for the AS
number of 2001.
107. A. The administrative distance of external BGP is a value of 20. The AD of internal
BGP is a value of 200.
108. D. The network address 120.187.230.0 is a Class B address. Therefore, the mask
of 255.255.255.0 must be specified, via the command network 120.187.230.0 mask
255.255.255.0.
109. C. The command show ip bgp neighbors will display all of the BGP neighbors
that the router is peered with. The command will also show statistics about the
peer(s).
110. B. The command clear ip bgp 198.23.45.2 soft in will soft-reset the BGP
neighbor of 198.23.45.2 for inbound connections. This will soft-refresh the BGP table
for the peer of 198.23.45.2 and cause a new set of inbound updates.
111. D. The command neighbor 207.178.17.1 remote-as 2002 configured in the BGP
router process will configure the neighbor as a peer. You first specify the remote IP of
the peer and then the remote-as (autonomous system) of the peer.
112. C. The command show tcp brief will allow you to see TCP terminated
connections on the router. Since BGP uses TCP 179 for BGP messages, there should be
an “established” connection on the router from the remote peer.
113. C. The command neighbor 198.45.32.2 shutdown will put the neighbor into an
Administratively Shutdown status. When you are ready to reestablish the peer, the no
neighbor 198.45.32.2 shutdown command will return BGP back to normal. This is
done to retain neighbor configuration while being able to disable the neighbor.
114. B. Using a route statement of ip route 194.56.32.0 255.255.255.0 null0 will
create a discard route. This route will allow BGP to advertise the network prefix as a
/24. The routing to the /29 networks will be overridden in Router A’s route table since
the connected route is more specific than the /24 route.
115. A. The command show ip route 160.45.23.0 255.255.255.0 longer-prefixes
will detail all of the specific routes contained in the route for 16.45.23.0/24.
116. A. Bandwidth describes the speed of a link in terms of bits per second.
117. A. QoS marking should always be performed closest to the source of the traffic. All
switches and routers in the network should be configured to properly prioritize

markings of traffic in queues.
118. B. Delay is the time it takes for a packet to travel from source to destination,
which is a description of one-way delay. Round-trip delay is the time it takes for the
packet to travel from source to destination (one-way delay) plus the time it takes for
the destination computer to send the packet back to the originating node to form a
round-trip.
119. A. QoS classifies traffic with access control lists and applies markings to the
packets.
120. C. Jitter is the measurement of variation between consecutive packet times from
source to destination (one-way delay). For example, if the first packet takes 10 ms, and
the second, third, and fourth take 10 ms, the jitter or variance is 0 ms. The simple
calculation is an average of packet times. However, data size has an influence on jitter,
so the more accurate calculation is J = J + (D (I – 1 , I) – J) / 16.
121. B. The Class of Service field is only found in layer 2 transmissions, specifically
only across trunks due to the dependency of 802.1Q. The CoS field is a 3-bit field in
the 802.1Q frame type.
122. D. Loss is the measurement of discarded packets. The measurement is a
percentage of transmitted packets. For example, if 100 packets are transmitted and 3
packets are dropped, then the loss is 3%. Loss can be attributed to congestions, faulty
wiring, EMI, or device queue congestion.
123. C. Network Based Application Recognition version 2 is used to classify
applications based on a Protocol Description Language Module (PDLM).
124. A. The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) is a 6-bit value in the Type of
Service (ToS) field of the IP header. The DSCP value defines the importance of packets
at layer 3.
125. A. A malicious user can mark all of his or her traffic as high priority. Therefore, a
trust boundary must be established by the network administrator. A common trust
boundary device is the IP phone, but it is any device that is in control of the network
administrator.
126. B. The standardized marking of DSCP EF, or Expedite Forwarding, is a decimal
equivalent of 46. This marking has the highest priority and should be used for VoIP
traffic and video.
127. C. The maximum delay that VOIP traffic should not exceed is 150 ms. At 150 ms,
you will have call disruption.
128. B. Low Latency Queue (LLQ) overrides Class Based Weighted Fair Queuing
(CBWFQ). CBWFQ uses a weighted round-robin scheduling of packets. LLQ has
priority override when packets come in matching the classification for LLQ.
129. B. QoS queue starvation occurs when the Low Latency Queuing (LLQ) is given

priority over the Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing. Therefore, policing of the LLQ
will help limit queue starvation and allow those queues an equal share of the total
output bandwidth.
130. A. Shaping monitors the bit rate of packets. If the bit rate is exceeded for a
configured queue, then shaping holds packets over the configured bit rate, causing a
delay.
131. C. Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing, or CBWFQ, is driven by a round-robin
scheduler. The queues are weighted for priority in the scheduler and the packets are
put into the queues upon classification.
132. B. Policing monitors the bit rate of packets. If the bit rate is exceeded for a
configured queue, then policing drops packets over the configured bit rate, causing
loss. In some cases it can be configured to re-mark the packets.
133. B. QoS policing should be implemented to adhere network traffic to a contracted
CIR. As an example, if your enterprise contracted a Metro Ethernet connection with an
access link of 1 Gb/s and a CIR of 400 Mb/s, you would need to make sure that traffic
does not exceed the CIR except for occasional bursts.
134. C. Tail drop happens when the QoS queues are full and cannot send packets fast
enough. There is no more room in the queue, and any packets being added to the tail
of the queue are dropped.
135. D. QoS shaping should be used when the service provider is policing traffic. If the
traffic is policed and exceeds the CIR, the ISP will drop packets. Therefore, traffic
shaping can delay the packets to slow the protocols vs. being dropped by the ISP.
136. A. The command auto qos trust cos will configure the interface to be trusted for
the CoS value. This type of QoS will happen at layer 2 with the CoS field. Based upon
the CoS value, the interface will be trusted for QoS. Normally, devices should not be
trusted for QoS since the CoS value could be forged so that the user can gain
preferential treatment of their packets.
137. B. QoS packet shapers work by measuring traffic over a time interval. If the time
interval is too large, the packets will be sent in the initial start of the interval. Then the
router will wait until the interval is over to transmit again. Configuring a small time
interval is desired so that the router is not waiting for the next interval to send
packets. It is recommended to use a time interval of 10 milliseconds (ms) for voice
and video traffic.
138. D. When the queue depth is above the minimum threshold, a percentage of TCP
packets are dropped. This allows the TCP window to shrink and allows a normal
slowdown of TCP transmissions. This is done in hopes that the queue will fall under
the minimum threshold and return to normal.
139. B. The command show mls qos interface will display information related to the
current QoS trust level on the interface along with the default CoS value.

140. B. AF41 marked traffic has a better position in the queue than traffic marked
AF31. During high congestion times, traffic with lower positions in the queues (AF3x,
AF2x, AF1x) would have more chances of being dropped than AF41.

Chapter 5: Infrastructure Services (Domain 5)
1. C. Domain Name Services (DNS) is a distributed database of fully qualified domain
names (FQDNs) to IP addresses.
2. B. Forward lookups resolve fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) to an IP address.
3. A. Domain Name Services direct queries are performed over the UDP protocol to
port 53. The queries do not require the TCP setup and teardown because the queries
are simple request and reply messages, so UDP is used for direct queries.
4. D. Fully qualified domain names are significant from right to left, starting with a
period to signify the root. The period is normally not visible on the FQDN, but it is
processed as the root lookup.
5. B. A reverse lookup is when the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is resolved
from an IP address. This is useful when you want to identify an IP address. From the
IP address, you can derive the FQDN.
6. C. The PTR, or pointer record, is used to look up IP addresses and return FQDNs
that are mapped to them. This is helpful to identify an IP address, and in the case of
SSH, it is used to positively identify the host you are connecting to.
7. A. The configured DNS domain name is appended to the hostname query. As an
example, if you query a hostname of routera and the configured domain name is
network.local, the DNS server will see a query for rotuera.network.local.
8. C. Static hostname entries are the most secure name resolution method for routers
and switches. This is because the switch or router does not need to forward-query a
server. However, static hostname entries are not scalable.
9. A. The A record is the DNS record that is queried when you want to resolve a
hostname to an IP address.
10. B. The time to live, or TTL, limits the amount of time in which a DNS entry will be
available in the DNS cache. The TTL can be defined by the DNS administrator on the
entry, or it can be defined in the SOA record as the default TTL.
11. D. The alternative to DNS lookup on routers is configuring static hostname entries.
This method unfortunately is not scalable.
12. D. The Quad-A (AAAA) record type is used for IPv6 hostname lookup on DNS
servers.
13. B. The protocol TCP and port number 53 are used for DNS domain zone transfers.
UDP port 53 is used for iterative queries, since the message is short. However, zone
transfers require the help of TCP because there is more information than there is in a
query.
14. C. Configuring DNS on a router or switch allows for ease of administration from

the router or switch. It enables DNS resolution from the console. It does not enable
DNS resolution from external sources unless you have configured the hostnames on
the DNS server.
15. D. By default, all routers and switches are set for ip domain-lookup. Because no IP
address is set, the router or switch will try to broadcast the DNS query. If you
configure no ip domain-lookup, the query will just fail, and you will not need to break
out of it.
16. D. The command ip host routerb 10.1.2.3 will configure the local resolution of
the host routerb to an IP address of 10.1.2.3.
17. C. The command ip name-server 172.16.1.5 will configure the router or switch to
query the DNS server of 172.16.1.5 for hostname lookups. You can specify multiple
DNS servers by using a space as a delimiter between each name for fault tolerance.
18. D. The command ip domain-name sybex.com will set the appended domain name
of sybex.com for DNS queries. This command will allow the proper FQDN to be
resolved by DNS.
19. A. A period is always appended to all FQDNs. This is significant because it
represents the root, where all DNS resolution begins. The root or period is not often
visible, but it is part of the DNS recursion process.
20. C. A best practice for security is to always use a trusted DNS server. This is
normally a server under the control of the enterprise, so it is a private DNS server.
21. B. The command show hosts will allow you to verify the statically configured hosts.
22. B. If the cache is cleared after the change has been made to DNS and you still get
the same IP address, the reason is most likely that there is a host entry configured.
The command show running-configuration will show you if there is an entry.
23. C. The command nslookup routerb.sybex.com will allow you to positively verify
name resolution. Ping should not be used because the failure of ICMP echo will make
the command fail, giving you a false result.
24. B. The command to verify DNS server(s) configured for name lookup is show
running-configuration. The line to look for in the output is ip name-server x.x.x.x.
25. D. Options A, B, and C will return the error ““% Unrecognized host or address or
protocol not running.”
26. C. DNS changes can be made on-the-fly. However, the results will not be seen
immediately unless all cache is cleared and routers request the new address. The
problem would be that this router had resolved routerb.sybex.com already and the
entry still exists in the cache, which needs to be cleared.
27. A. RouterB has not accessed the cache in 9 hours. The age represents when the IOS
has last referred to the entry in cache. The age is represented in hours.

28. D. The command to clear only the host routerb.sybex.com from the DNS cache is
clear host routerb.sybex.com. This will remove only that particular host from the
cache.
29. C. The router is pointed to a public DNS server. The domain name of the router is
sybex.local, and .local is not a valid top level domain (TLD). Therefore, the DNS
server should be private, that is hosting the sybex.local DNS zone.
30. B. There is most likely an ACL on Router B that is blocking UDP port 53. The ACL
on Router A would not affect traffic generating from Router A.
31. C. The DHCP Discover packet is a broadcast to discover a DHCP server. The layer 3
packet and layer 2 frame are broadcasts. Since the client does not have an IP address
yet, the layer 3 source address is all zeros. However, the layer 2 source MAC address is
filled out in the frame.
32. C. The command ip address dhcp will configure the router to use DHCP for IP
address assignment. This command needs to be issued on the interface in which you
want the IP address to be configured, similar to static IP address assignment.
33. B. The command show ip interface will display the IP addresses configured on
the router’s interfaces. It will detail which are static and which have been allocated
through DHCP.
34. A. The DHCP client uses the source port UDP/68 to await connections back from
the server. It keeps this protocol and port open in an active state until DHCP is
complete.
35. A. The command show dhcp lease will help you verify the IP address configured
on the router, the DHCP server that served the lease, and the lease time in seconds.
36. C. The DHCP Offer packet is a broadcast packet from the DHCP server to the
DHCP client. The layer 3 packet and layer 2 frame are both broadcasts.
37. D. The command ip helper-address 10.10.1.101 will configure the interface to
become a DHCP relay agent. This command must be configured on the interface in
which you want the DHCP relay agent to listen and respond.
38. B. The Gateway Address (GIADDR) field is filled out by the DHCP relay agent
before the DHCP packet is sent to the DHCP server. This field helps the DHCP server
decide which scope to send an Offer message back for.
39. D. The DHCP server bind port of UDP/67 is used for awaiting connections from
DHCP clients.
40. D. A DHCP relay agent installed on Router A interface Gi0/0 will allow clients on
Host A’s network to obtain IP addressing from DHCP.
41. B. The command ipconfig /all will display the generic information of IP, subnet
mask, and gateway. It will also display the DHCP server that configured the client with
an IP address.

42. A. The DHCP acknowledgment message is sent from the DHCP client to the DHCP
server to acknowledge that the IP address offered will be used by the client.
43. A. DHCP uses layer 3 broadcasts by sending packets to 255.255.255.255 for initial
DHCP discovery.
44. B. DHCP clients request a renewal of the lease halfway through the lease time of
the IP address.
45. C. After the initial Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledge, it is the client’s
responsibility to maintain the lease of the IP address. This includes release and
renewal.
46. A. DHCP uses UDP as a connectionless protocol for the Discover, Offer, Request,
and Acknowledge packets.
47. C. The command debug ip dhcp server packet will show the details of a DHCP
relay agent conversation. It will detail conversation between the client and router and
the router and the DHCP server.
48. C. Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) allows for the client to learn the
network ID and calculate a host ID that is unique. However, SLAAC is lacking the
ability to configure options such as DNS time servers, etc. DHCPv6 allows for the
configuration of these options when used in conjunction with SLAAC.
49. D. They will lose their IP after their entire lease has expired. Until the lease
expires, they will have functioning IP addresses.
50. B. The command ipv6 dhcp relay destination 2001:db8:1:2::2 will configure
the router interface to relay DHCP requests to 2001:db8:1:2::2. This command must
be configured on the interface that is to listen for DHCPv6 requests.
51. A. The command lease 0 4 0 will configure the DHCP pool for a duration of 0
days, 4 hours, and 0 minutes.
52. D. The command ip dhcp exclusion-address 192.168.1.16 192.168.1.31 will
configure an exclusion address range by specifying the low IP address and the high IP
address. This command is configured from the global configuration prompt.
53. D. The command option 66 ip 10.1.1.5 sets the TFTP server to boot from. The
command bootfile boot\x86\wdsnbp.com sets the bootfile on the TFTP server to
boot\x86\wdsnbp.com. Some clients may need other options, such as option 60, which
is the vendor class identifier.
54. B. The default gateway option is configured under the DHCP pool with the
command default-router 10.1.1.1. This will set the default gateway to 10.1.1.1 for
the DHCP clients.
55. A. The DNS server is configured with the command dns-server 10.1.1.5. This
command is used in lieu of the option command so that multiple DNS servers can be
configured on the same line.

56. C. The command network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 will configure the network
ID and subnet mask required for DHCP.
57. A. Stateful DHCPv6 supplies the network ID and host ID. The default router is
discovered through the Neighbor Discovery Protocol.
58. C. The command ipv6 address dhcp will configure the interface to obtain its IP
address via stateful DHCPv6.
59. B. The command show ipv6 dhcp interface will display which mode the client is
in, the address, and the DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) as well as the stateful
DHCPv6 server address.
60. C. When the lease for a node is deleted on the DHCP server, the DHCP server is
free to hand out the lease to another node. This happens independently from the
client, as there is no communication from server to client about the lease. The client
will retain the IP address until the renewal period, which will cause a duplication of IP
addressing.
61. A. At seven-eighths of the lease cycle, the DHCP client will perform a rebinding.
The rebinding process means that the original DHCP server was down at the one-half
mark of the lease, so now the client will try to rebind with any responding DHCP
server.
62. A. The command renew dhcp gi 0/0 will force the DHCP client to renew the
current lease.
63. C. When the DHCP server issues an IP address to a client, it records the MAC
address in the DHCP bindings table. This is recorded along with the lease expiration.
64. B. During the DHCP rebinding process, a DHCP Request is sent. However, it is not
sent to the originating server since rebinding occurs after the renewal period was
missed. So the DHCP Request is broadcast to any listening DHCP server.
65. C. The DHCP pool is configured for the network of 192.168.1.0/24. However, there
is an exclusion range of 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.25. Therefore, the first IP address
handed out via DHCP is 192.168.1.26.
66. C. The DHCP server is not configured properly. When a Windows client configures
itself with an IP address of 169.254.x.x, it is using APIPA, or Automatic Private IP
Addressing (link-local addressing).
67. C. DHCP clients use a protocol called Gratuitous Address Resolution Protocol
(GARP). The GARP packet is a broadcast to the other clients in the network. If no
response is heard, there are no conflicts.
68. B. When DHCP detects a duplicate IP address in the pool, it will remove the
duplicate IP address from the DHCP pool and place it into the conflict table. It will
require manual intervention to reserve the IP address.
69. C. It is recommended that you create an exclusion for the router interface and any

statically configured hosts in the network for the DHCP pool. This will prevent
duplicate IP address conflicts.
70. B. The command show ip dhcp conflict will display the IP address conflicts on
the router or switch. The table will display how the conflict was discovered with GARP
or Ping as well as the detection time.
71. D. The DHCP pool network is incorrectly set to the wrong scope. The DHCP pool
network should be set to 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0.
72. D. The command show ip dhcp pool will allow you to see the current utilization of
the scopes configured on the router.
73. D. The command to remove an IP address from the conflict table is clear ip dhcp
conflict 192.168.1.6. This command will remove a single IP address of 192.168.1.6
from the table and place it back in the DHCP pool. Alternatively, all of the conflicts can
be cleared with an * in lieu of the IP address.
74. B. The exclusions are configured for the entire 254 block of IP addresses in the
network of 192.168.1.0/24. No IP addresses will be served until the exclusions are
corrected.
75. A. The command show ip dhcp bindings will allow you to verify all of the current
DHCP leases served by the router or switch.
76. B. Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) is an IEEE open standard that is
supported freely on many router products.
77. D. The well-known HSRP ID is 07.ac. Anytime you see the 07.ac in the second part
of the MAC address along with the Cisco OUI, you can identify that HSRP is being
employed.
78. C. Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) is a Cisco Proprietary protocol that
supports redundancy and per-subnet load balancing.
79. C. The HSRP group number in the MAC address 0000.0c07.ac05 is 01. After the
Cisco OUI and well-known HSPR ID, the last two digits are the HSRP group identifier.
80. A. The default priority of HSRP is 100.
81. D. You can create up to 256 HSRP groups on a router. This would include group 0
to 255 for a total of 256 groups.
82. B. HSRP routers communicate with each other on port 1985 using UDP.
83. B. Only one router can be active at a time in an HSRP group. All other routers are
standby routers, until the active router fails.
84. C. HSRP uses multicasting to communicate among HSRP group members. For
HSRPv1, the address is 224.0.0.2, and for HSRPv2, the address is 224.0.0.102.
85. A. The virtual router is responsible for host communications such as an ARP

request for the host’s default gateway. Technically, this is served by the active router
since it is hosting the virtual router. However, it is the virtual router’s IP address and
MAC address that are used for outgoing packets.
86. C. The hold timer must expire for the standby router to become an active router.
The hold timer is three times the hello timer, so three hello packets must be missed
before the standby becomes active.
87. D. Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) use the port number 3222 and the
protocol UDP for router communications.
88. D. HSRP version 2 allows for timers to be configured in milliseconds in lieu of
seconds. This allows for quicker failover between active and standby routers.
89. C. The active virtual gateway (AVG) is responsible for responding to ARP requests
from hosts. The AVG will reply with the MAC address of any one of the active virtual
forwarders (AVFs).
90. D. The router with the highest priority will become the AVG. However, if all
routers have the same priority, then the router with the highest IP address configured
becomes the tiebreaker.
91. B. Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) supports up to four active virtual
forwarders per GLBP group.
92. A. The command standby 1 priority 150 will set the HSRP group of 1 on this
router to a priority of 150. As long as all other routers are set to the default of 100, this
router will become the default router on the next election.
93. D. You can create up to 4,096 HSRP groups on a router. This would include group
0 to 4096 for a total of 4,096 groups.
94. C. Hot Standby Router Protocol version 2 (HSRPv2) is being employed. It uses an
OUI of 0000.0c and a well-known identifier of 9f.f, and the last three digits identify
the HSRP group, which has been expanded from two digits in version 1.
95. D. Preemption allows for the election process to happen for a newly added HSRP
router. If preemption is not enabled, then the newly added HSRP router will become a
standby router.
96. B. Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) allows for only one active router per HSRP
group. However, you can configure multiple VLANs with HSRP groups. You can then
alternate a higher-than-default priority to force an active router per VLAN. This will
give you a rudimentary way of balancing traffic.
97. C. The command show standby will allow you to verify the state of the current
router for HSRP.
98. C. The HSRP group is not set for preemption, which is the default behavior for
HSRP. You need to enable preemption, which will allow a reelection when the priority
is changed or if a new standby router comes online. If preemption is disabled, the

active router will have affinity.
99. D. The command standby 1 preempt will configure HSRP group 1 for preemption.
This command must be configured under the interface on which HSRP has been
enabled. The command show standby will allow you to verify this.
100. B. The command vrrp 1 ip 10.1.2.3 will configure the interface with VRRP with
a virtual IP address of 10.1.2.3.
101. C. Interface tracking is configured on the interface in which the HSRP group has
been configured. The command standby 1 track serial 0/0/1 tells the HSRP group
of 1 to track the status of interface serial 0/0/1.
102. B. The command tracert 10.1.2.33 will allow you to see the real IP address on
the router that is responding for the ICMP packet. With HSRP, the virtual MAC
address is returned for the virtual IP address of the default gateway. However, when
ping is used the ping packet enters the real interface, and then the interface responds
with the real IP address.
103. C. The command debug standby will allow you to see real-time information from
HSRP on the router on which you have entered the command.
104. A. GLBP allows for per-host load balancing. It does this by allowing the active
virtual router to respond for the virtual IP address. The AVG then hands out the MAC
address in the ARP request for one of the active virtual forwarders. It does this in a
round-robin fashion.
105. A. The command standby 1 timers msec 200 msec 700 will set the HSRP group
of 1 with a hello timer of 200 milliseconds and a hold timer of 700 milliseconds. This
is configured inside of the interface in which the HSRP group was created.
106. C. Network Address Translation (NAT) was created to slow the depletion of
Internet addresses. It does this by translating RFC 1918 privatized addresses to one or
many public IP addresses. It allows the packets to masquerade as the public IP address
on the Internet until is it translated back to the private IP address.
107. A. Network Address Translation creates packet switching path delay. This is
because each address traveling through the NAT process requires lookup time for the
translation.
108. B. Static Network Address Translation is a one-to-one mapping between a local
(private) and global (public) IP address. This is used for servers, such as web servers
and email servers, so that they are Internet reachable.
109. A. The inside local address is the address local to the enterprise (private), and the
address is inside the enterprise. The inside local address will almost always be an RCF
1918 address, unless NAT is being used for purposes other than enterprise Internet
access. If NAT is used for Internet access, then the inside local address is any host
address destined for the Internet through NAT.

110. A. Dynamic Network Address Translation is a one-to-one mapping on the fly in
which the IP address is allocated from a pool of addresses. This is often called many-
to-many. When a host makes an attempt to go through the NAT process, an IP address
is mapped to the host from the global pool. This type of NAT is useful in network
address overlap situations because there is less latency than NAT Overloading.
111. C. Network Address Translation overloading, sometimes called Port Address
Translation, allows for one public IP address to be used for NAT. The conversations
between local and global IPs are sorted using the source and destination ports for the
various applications. This is the most common NAT and can be found in any home,
small office, or enterprise.
112. C. The inside global address is the address public to the enterprise. The address is
inside of or controlled by the enterprise. The inside global address in this case is the
public side of the NAT which is Router A’s S0/0 IP address.
113. D. The outside global address is the address public to the enterprise. The address
is outside of the enterprise or outside of its control. When using NAT for Internet
access, the outside global address is the destination host on the Internet. The outside
global address in this exhibit is the web server.
114. A. Static NAT translation entries are always present in the NAT table. Static NAT
entries have the same amount of security and latency as dynamic NAT.
115. B. Network Address Translation overloading is also called Port Address
Translation. This is because a single IP address can allow up to 65,535 simulations
inside local connections, which are segregated in the NAT table by source and
destination port number.
116. B. A decrease in public IP address utilization is a direct benefit of using NAT.
Memory utilization will increase, latency of packets will increase, and some network
applications could have problems with NAT.
117. C. Static NAT is mainly used for publishing internal resources on the Internet,
Such services are email servers, web servers, collaboration servers, and so on.
118. A. The inside local address is “inside” the enterprise and under “local” control of
the enterprise. This term is from the perspective of the NAT device.
119. C. The flexibility of Internet connections is usually a driving factor for PAT (NAT
Overloading). Memory is significantly higher with PAT, since the source and
destination port numbers must be recorded in the NAT table. There is no effect on
packet loss, and jitter is marginally affected.
120. D. The command to configure the private side of the network interface for NAT is
ip nat inside. This command is configured on the interface in which you want to
define it as the “inside” of your network.
121. A. The command show ip nat translations will allow you to view the active NAT

translations on the router.
122. D. The command show ip nat statistics will allow you to view the number of
active NAT translations on the router. In addition, it will provide you with the current
inside and outside interfaces.
123. A. After you define the inside and outside per each respective interface, the
command ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.3 179.43.44.1 will statically NAT
(Network Address Translation) the inside local address of 192.168.1.3 to the inside
global address of 179.43.44.1.
124. D. The command ip nat pool EntPool 179.43.44.2 179.43.44.15 netmask
255.255.255.0 will configure the pool called EntPool with the range of IP addresses
from 179.43.44.2 to 179.43.44.15 and the network mask of /24. The /24 is used in lieu
of the /28 because the serial interface is a /24 and therefore all IP addresses in that
network are /24.
125. B. The access list allows the inside local address to pass through the NAT process.
126. C. The command clear ip nat translation * will clear all IP NAT translations
out of the NAT table. The asterisk is used as a wildcard for all addresses. You can
alternatively specify a specific inside or outside NAT address.
127. C. When the NAT table clears, established TCP sessions will need to reestablish
via the three-way handshake. This creates a problem for some secure protocols such
as SSH, which will drop the established connection and not reestablish a new
connection. UDP does not have a state to its connection, so little or no disturbance will
be seen.
128. B. The command debug ip nat will allow you to see real-time NAT translations.
When you issue this command, you should know that each NAT translation will log to
the screen or logging server and will spike CPU usage.
129. C. The first command required is access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255,
which defines the allowed networks. The next command creates the NAT pool with ip
nat pool EntPool 179.43.44.1 179.43.44.1 netmask 255.255.255.0. The last
command, ip nat inside source list 1 pool EntPool overload, ties the access list
together with the pool and defines PAT with the overload command.
130. D. The first command sets up the allowed network to be NATed with access-list
1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255. The next command, ip nat inside source list 1
interface serial 0/0 overload, is where everything is tied together. The access list is
applied and the interface of serial 0/0 is configured to overload.
131. B. The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize time for routers and
switches.
132. C. Time synchronization is important for logging accuracy. Serial communication
frame alignment is timed via DCE clocking and packet queues are timed by how fast

they can respond.
133. A. The command ntp server 129.6.15.28 will configure your router to connect to
the server 129.6.15.28 as an NTP source. This command must be entered in global
configuration mode.
134. B. The command ntp master configures the router or switch to trust its internal
time clock.
135. A. The command show clock detail will result in either no time source or time
source is NTP if the router or switch is configured to slave off a server for time.
136. C. The command show ntp associations detail will allow you to view the NTP
clock details from the master NTP server.
137. D. The Network Time Protocol uses UDP port 123 for time synchronization.
138. C. The command debug ntp packets will allow you to verify packets received
from an NTP server.
139. A. A best practice is to configure the main router in your network to a known good
trusted time source by its DNS address. All devices in your network should then be
configured to point to this trusted router. All time sources should pyramid out from
the central source of time in your network.
140. C. The command show ntp status will allow you to see the current time source,
the precision of the time source, and the drift from your internal time clock.

Chapter 6: Infrastructure Security (Domain 6)
1. B. Port security can restrict a port to a single device by MAC address. This will
effectively make plugging in a wireless access point a non-event for a corporate
network.
2. A. Port security blocks unauthorized access by examining the source address of a
network device.
3. C. Port security is enabled by configuring the command switchport port-security.
This command must be configured on the interface in which you want to enable port
security.
4. A. By default, only a single MAC address is allowed on an interface when port
security is enabled.
5. C. Port security operates at layer 2 by inspecting the source MAC addresses in
frames. It allows the configured number of source MAC addresses to be switched into
the port and onto the switch processor.
6. C. Configuring port security helps a network administrator prevent unauthorized
access by MAC address.
7. C. Port security works best in static environments where there is minimal change to
the environment. It does not require any more memory since the results are pulled
from the MAC address table.
8. B. Both the computer and the VoIP phone have MAC addresses, and therefore you
will need to allow the port to have two MAC addresses, one for the phone to
communicate and the other for the computer to communicate on the port.
9. B. By default, when port security is configured on a port, the violation method is err-
disabled shutdown.
10. C. When port security is configured, the port cannot be in dynamic mode for
Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) mode. You must configure the port as an access
port first, then turn off DTP with the command switchport nonnegotiate. You can
then configure switchport port security.
11. B. The command switchport port-security maximum 2 will configure the port with
a maximum of two MAC addresses that shall pass through the port.
12. D. The command switchport port-security violation restrict will set the
violation mode to restrict. This will drop frames over the maximum number of learned
MAC addresses and will log security violations to the counters.
13. B. The command show port-security interface gi 2/13 will allow you to see a
detailed view of an individual port configured for port security.
14. A. The command switchport port-security violation shutdown puts the

interface into the err-disable state immediately and sends an SNMP trap notification
to a syslog server.
15. C. The command switchport port-security violation protect will set the
violation mode to protect. This will drop frames over the maximum number of learned
MAC addresses but will not log security violations to the counters.
16. C. The command show port-security will show all ports that have logged port
security violations.
17. C. When you configure sticky port security, the first MAC address seen by the
switch will become bound to the port. Any other MAC addresses will trip the access
violation set.
18. B. The default configuration for port security results in an access violation of
shutdown. When a port-security violation occurs, the port will be shut down in an err-
disable status.
19. A. The command switchport port-security mac-address sticky will configure
the port to learn the first MAC address and allow only the first MAC address to pass
traffic.
20. D. One way to clear an err-disable status is to issue the shutdown command and
then the no shutdown command on the port. This will reset the port so that traffic can
flow again. However, if the access violation still exists then it will enter an err-disable
status again.
21. B. The command switchport port-security mac-address 0334.56f3.e4e4 will
configure the interface with a static MAC address of 0334.56f3.e4e4.
22. D. The command show port-security will show all of the ports that are actively
participating in port security. In addition, you can see the maximum number of
addresses configured, current addresses, security violations, and action.
23. D. The global config command errdisable recovery cause psecure_violation
will reset all ports with an err-disable status.
24. A. The command show running-configuration will show you the learned MAC
addresses from port security.
25. B. Sticky MAC addresses become part of the running-configuration. If the running-
configuration is saved to the NVRAM, then the sticky MAC address will become part of
the startup-configuration.
26. D. The command no switchport port-security mac-address sticky
0045.2342.e4c3 will remove the entry for the device. The command no switchport
port-security mac-address sticky will remain, so the next device learned will create
a new sticky entry.
27. C. The port is up and operational in a normal status. The port is configured for a
maximum of two MAC addresses, both of which are sticky MAC addresses.

28. D. The command show port-security address will allow you to see all of the
dynamically learned MAC addresses for port security. The command show running-
configuration would allow you to see only dynamically learned MAC addresses that
are sticky.
29. B. The port is currently in an access violation status. The current access violation
mode is secure-shutdown, and therefore, the interface will require shutdown and no
shutdown to reset the port.
30. C. The command show port-security address will allow you to see all of the MAC
addresses and the ports they are assigned to for port security. In addition, it will show
you the time left before the MAC addresses expire, if they have been obtained
dynamically.
31. B. The interface switchport should be in an access mode before port security is
applied to the interface. Trunks can participate in port security, but it is rare to use
these two functions together.
32. C. The maximum number of MAC addresses is one, which is the default. The
current port-security violation of restrict will restrict frames from any other MAC
addresses by dropping the frames.
33. D. The command show port-security interface gi 2/3 will allow you to see
detailed information about the interface in which port security is configured.
34. A. The default configuration for port security is dynamic port security and a
violation of shutdown. If a new device is connected to the port, it will enter an err-
disable status. Therefore, clearing the dynamic MAC addresses will be required via the
command clear port-security dynamic interface gi 2/3. Alternatively, the
command clear port-security dynamic would clear all dynamically learned MAC
addresses on the entire switch.
35. B. The command switchport port-security aging time 1440 will configure the
port to forget the dynamically learned MAC address after 1,440 minutes. This
command is configured in minutes and saves an admin from entering a clear
command. However, if a violation of shutdown is configured, the port will need to be
manually reset if it enters violation mode within this time period.
36. B. The perimeter area, or perimeter network, is outside of the corporate firewall.
The perimeter area generally holds equipment necessary for routing to the ISP.
37. B. The DHCP binding table tracks all interface, MAC address, VLAN, and IP
information. This database is critical in snooping out other ports from using identical
information.
38. A. The demilitarized zone (DMZ) is an area that is protected by the corporate
firewall. However, it allows servers such as web servers, email servers, and application
servers to be accessible via the Internet.

39. C. An intrusion prevention system, or IPS, can detect and prevent attacks based on
their signature. They are commonly found in firewall systems such as Adaptive
Security Appliance (ASA) devices.
40. A. The internal network is defined by the firewall. Anything protected by the
firewall on the internal network is considered to be the trusted network.
41. B. Distributed denial of service, or DDoS, is a common attack technique used to
deny others of service. It is performed by overwhelming the service with bogus traffic.
When it is performed from multiple hosts on the Internet, it is very difficult to prevent
and stop.
42. B. An intrusion detection system, or IDS, can detect an attack based upon its
signature. They are commonly found in firewall systems such as Adaptive Security
Appliance (ASA) devices.
43. A. By default, all ports are considered untrusted, which means they should never
serve the request of a DHCP client. Only the port put into trusted mode is allowed to
answer client requests.
44. C. Rate limiting is employed to thwart DHCP starvation attacks by limiting the
number of DHCP packets a port can receive per second.
45. A. A spurious DHCP attack is when a rouge DHCP server is started on the network.
It serves clients with incorrect DHCP information. DHCP snooping helps to mitigate
this attack.
46. D. Ping sweep scans are used by attackers to discover hosts on a network. The scan
sends a flood of ICMP echo requests to the perimeter network and awaits echo replies.
When ICMP is blocked at the perimeter, an attacker would not be able to scan the
network via ICMP.
47. C. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) will help mitigate denial of service attacks.
Common features of IPS can be found in the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance.
48. C. IP address spoofing is a common attack method used to attempt to gain access
to a system by spoofing the originating IP address.
49. C. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) communications offer both encryption and
authentication of the data via certificate signing. This would prevent tampering of the
data end to end.
50. D. This attack is called a man in the middle attack. The attacker sits in the middle
of communications and relays it back while capturing it and possibly modifying it.
51. A. Access control lists are an effective way to mitigate spoofing of internal IPs from
outside the trusted network.
52. A. A requirement of DHCP snooping is that the device is on the VLAN that DHCP
snooping is monitoring.

53. D. Any service that allows the user to create a connection or access to information
can be used as an attack vector. In the case of DHCP, the attacker will set the gateway
to their IP address. In the case of DNS, the attacker could spoof a request to redirect
the traffic.
54. D. The default mode of switchports on a switch configured with DHCP snooping is
untrusted. An admin must trust ports manually.
55. A. The default native VLAN for Cisco switches is VLAN 1.
56. C. Ports that are connecting to trusted infrastructure devices such as routers and
switches should be trusted. This is because legitimate DHCP traffic could originate
from these ports.
57. C. The untrusted ports drop Offer and Acknowledgment DHCP messages. The only
device that should offer and acknowledge IP addresses is the DHCP server on a trusted
port.
58. A. Double tagging is an attack that can be used against the native VLAN. The
attacker will tag the native VLAN on a frame and then tag another inside that frame
for the VLAN that the attacker intends to compromise. When the switch receives the
first frame, it removes the default VLAN tag and forwards it to other switches via a
trunk port. When the other switch receives the frame with the second VLAN tag, it
forwards it to the VLAN which the attacker is targeting the attack upon.
59. D. The command show ip dhcp snooping binding will display the DHCP snooping
database. This database will have entries for the MAC address, IP address, lease time,
VLAN, and interface.
60. A. The command ip dhcp snooping trust will configure the interface as a trusted
port.
61. C. The native VLAN is the default configuration on all switches. It is very possible
that a user could be configured by accident for the native VLAN of 1. This would allow
management access to switching and routing.
62. C. 802.1x allows selective access to a network at layer 2. It allows this on the
switch because the switch acts as an authenticator to an AAA server, only allowing
access after the user or device has been authenticated.
63. B. The end device that sends credentials is called the supplicant. The supplicant is
a piece of software in the operating system that supplies the credentials for AAA
authentication.
64. A. The switch is responsible for communicating with the supplicant and sending
information to the authenticating server. This device is called the authenticator.
65. A. The protocol used to communicate between the supplicants (OS) and the
authenticator (switch) is 802.1x. 802.1x is a layer 2 protocol used specifically for
authenticating devices to switch ports.

66. B. VLAN hopping is an attack in which DTP is exploited. The attacker negotiates a
trunk with the switch via DTP and can hop from VLAN to VLAN.
67. C. EAP, or Extensible Authentication Protocol, is used for authentication between
the supplicant and RADIUS server. The EAP frame is first transmitted over the layer 2
connection via EAP over LAN (EAPoL). The switch then sends it to the RADIUS server
encapsulated in a UDP packet.
68. A. The device requesting access is the supplicant. The supplicant is built into the
operating system in which it is authenticating.
69. B. EAP-TLS, or Extensible Authentication Protocol/Transport Layer Security, uses
certificates to authenticate end devices. It also provides a layer of encryption via the
certificate infrastructure.
70. C. The AAA server listens for requests on port 1812 UDP for authentication of
credentials.
71. A. Standard access lists are within the range of 1 to 99.
72. C. Access control lists can be based upon only the source address of the packet.
73. C. Extended access lists are within the range of 100 to 199.
74. B. At the end of every access list there is a deny any any rule. If a permit is not
configured in the access list, the ACL does not serve a purpose. All ACLs must contain
at least one permit statement.
75. B. When packets are compared to an access control list, they are compared in a
sequential order. When the first rule is found to match, the action is acted upon. There
is no further rule processing after the first match.
76. B. An advantage to a standard access control list is that they require less processing
overhead from the ASIC or CPU (depending on the platform). Since they only inspect
layer 3 headers, no further decapsulation is required for layer 4.
77. C. The expanded range of a standard access list is 1300 to 1999.
78. C. A wildcard mask is the opposite of a network mask. The easy way to calculate a
wildcard mask is to figure out what the subnet is and deduct 1 for the octet. For
example, if the network address is 172.16.0.0/12 (Classless Inter-Domain Routing), or
255.240.0.0 (Dotted Decimal Notation), and each network number is a multiple of 16,
the wildcard mask should be 0.15.255.255.
79. A. The command ip access-list 20 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 will configure an
access list of 20, which is a standard access list. The source address of 192.168.1.0 is
wildcard masked with 0.0.0.255.
80. D. A rule with an address or 0.0.0.0 and wildcard mask of 255.255.255.255 defines
all addresses. Effectively, it is another way to specify the “any” source or destination.
81. D. Access lists can be applied per a port, per a protocol, and per a direction. For

example, you could apply only one ACL per the interface of Fast 0/1, per the protocol
of IP in the inbound direction.
82. B. An extended access list allows you to filter traffic by port, which defines an
application being used, since web traffic is communicated on 80 or 443.
83. D. The expanded range of a standard access list is 2000 to 2699.
84. C. A wildcard mask is the opposite of a network mask. The easy way to calculate a
wildcard mask is to figure out what the subnet is and deduct 1 for the octet. For
example, if the network address is 192.168.1.0/25 (Classless Inter-Domain Routing),
or 255.255.255.128 (Dotted Decimal Notation), and each network number is a
multiple of 128, the wildcard mask should be 0.0.0.127.
85. D. A named access control list allows for removing and adding entries by their line
number.
86. B. Once a successful login is performed at the router, the dynamic access control
list is activated. This is also called lock and key security.
87. A. The statement access-list 20 deny 172.16.0.0 0.255.255.255 configures a
standard access list for two reasons: the first is that the access list number is 20,
which falls between the standard access list range of 1 to 99. The second reason is that
you are depicting traffic by source address.
88. C. The command access-list 5 permit host 192.168.1.5 specifies the traffic
coming from the host 192.168.1.5. The statement access-list 5 permit 192.168.1 .5
0.0.0.0 achieves the same thing.
89. B. The command access-list 101 deny tcp host 192.168.2.6 host 192.168.1.3
eq 80 denies access from the host 192.168.2.3 to the host 192.168.1.6 for port 80. The
next command, access-list 101 permit ip any any, allows all IP traffic from any to
any. With extended access lists, the protocol needs to be described.
90. D. Standard access lists only allow you to describe traffic by source address. This
helps the processing of the access list because the router or switch does not need to
de-capsulate packets further than layer 3.
91. D. The command access-list 199 deny tcp any host 192.168.1.5 eq 22 will
create an extended access list of 199 and deny TCP communication from any computer
to the host of 192.168.1.5 for port 22.
92. C. An extended access list is required because you want to block by the destination
address of the HR web application server. If you blocked only by source, then all host
network traffic would be blocked to all servers.
93. C. The command access-list 143 permit tcp host 192.168.8.3 eq 80 any is a
valid statement. All extended access lists that describe a port must also describe the
protocol.
94. D. The command ip access-group 198 in will apply access list 198 to the interface

in which it is configured in the inbound direction.
95. D. The access list must be placed on the Gi0/2 interface outbound. Whenever you
are evaluating access list placement, remember that packets are evaluated as they
leave the interface, which is outbound. When packets enter the interface, they are
evaluated inbound. It is always in the perspective of the router.
96. D. The command show ip access-list will show all access lists with the line
numbers. If the command is specific, such as show ip access-list named_list, you
will see the ACL lines but no line numbers.
97. A. Extended ACLs should always be placed closest to the source of traffic since they
are extremely granular.
98. C. The command ip access-list extended named_list will create an extended
named access list.
99. B. Standard ACLs should always be placed closest to the destination of traffic since
they are broad in the traffic they control.
100. C. The command no 10 when configured under the named access list will remove
only line 10 on the access list.
101. D. The command ip access-list resequence named_list 10 10 will resequence
the line numbers for the named access list called named_list. The numbering will
start with 10 and increment by 10.
102. D. The command ip access-group named_list in configured inside of the
interface will apply an access list called named_list to the interface for the inbound
direction.
103. B. The command ip access-list 6 deny 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 will block the
internal server network. Then the command ip access-list 6 permit any will allow
everything else. We then apply this to the interface Serial 0/0 for the direction of
outbound. The final result is that the servers will be able to talk internally and not
allowed out to the Internet.
104. D. IPv6 access lists are created as named access lists. The command ipv6 access-
list named_list will create an IPv6 named access list.
105. B. IPv6 access control lists implicitly allow Neighbor Discovery packets. This is to
facilitate a number of features that IPv6 has built in, such as SLAAC and DAD.
106. C. The command show ip interface fast 0/1 will show the IP address details of
the interface Fast 0/1. Included with these details you will find any outbound and
inbound ACLs set on the interface.
107. A. Using the command remark followed by the text is a way of adding notes in an
ACL. This particular example is a named access list. However, remarks can also be
used in traditional ACLs using a similar syntax in lieu of the permit and deny.

108. D. The command show access-list will show the number of matches for each
statement. This command also works for IPv6 access lists.
109. B. The command ip access-list 101 permit tcp host 192.168.1.6 any eq 80
log will permit traffic from host 192.168.1.6 to any matching packets on port 80. When
the log attribute is configured on the end of the command, the router or switch will
send a syslog notification each time the packet is matched to the rule.
110. D. Since NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) is used for finding the gateway,
Duplicate Address Detection, and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration, all of these
functions would be impacted.
111. D. The Path Trace tool was first debuted in version 1.0 of the APIC-EM
(Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Enterprise Module). However, the ACL
Analysis tool was not added as an option until version 1.2.
112. B. Before performing a path trace ACL analysis, you must perform an
environment discovery on your network topology.
113. B. The Path Trace ACL Analysis tool is a basic application. Basic applications do
not require licensing, similar to the APIC-EM itself. Solution applications are licensed
apps from Cisco and third parties; both run on top of the base controller.
114. C. The APIC-EM is a Cisco Development Network (DevNet) tool. It requires a
login to the Cisco DevNet site. This is because the APIC-EM is a tool you can use to
create applications for network management.
115. C. The red square X means that router ISR4451X-A is blocking the destination
traffic with an ACL.
116. A. The APIC-EM Path Trace ACL Analysis tool is used for end-to-end analysis of
ACLs via the path an imaginary packet will take.
117. A. When performing path trace ACL analysis, you first start by selecting the Path
Trace option. On the next screen, you select the ACL Analysis option, which will help
you perform the ACL analysis.
118. C. When performing a path trace ACL analysis, you must select the starting device
and end device as well at the egress port and ingress port. The path of analysis will be
calculated by the tool.
119. A. The green square check means that router ISR4451X-A has a matching ACL,
which is permitting the destination traffic.
120. C. If a packet is blocked, the analysis output will show you the access control
entry (ACE) in the ACL that is blocking the packet.
121. C. The command enable secret Password20! will set the enable password and
encrypt the Password20! password.
122. D. The command line vty 0 5 will enter you into the line for the virtual teletype,

which is where you configure your Telnet password.
123. B. If the enable password is set and the enable secret is set, the enable password
will be ignored. Therefore the enable secret is being used to authenticate the user,
and you are typing the wrong password. The command enable password exists for
backward compatibility with pre 10.3 IOS and should no longer be used.
124. C. The command password Password20! will set the login password to
Password20!. The sub-command login will require login for the line.
125. C. The line login password is not set when you receive the error Password
required, but none set. If the enable secret was not set, you would just not be able
to get to a privilege exec prompt, but still be able to get to a user exec prompt.
126. B. The hostname and domain name are required before you attempt to generate
the encryption keys for SSH.
127. A. The command ip ssh version 2 will set your SSH version to 2. This command
is to be entered at a global configuration prompt.
128. C. The command transport ssh telnet will configure the VTY line to accept SSH
as a login protocol and fallback to Telnet.
129. D. SSH is encrypted and Telnet is in clear text. To keep passwords and
configuration safe, SSH should always be used.
130. C. You must first create an access list to permit the host that will manage the
router or switch with the command access-list 1 permit host 192.168.1.5. Then
enter the VTY line in which it will be applied with the command line vty 0 5. Then
apply it with the command ip access-class 1 in, which differs from the command ip
access-group, which is used on interfaces.
131. B. When you’re configuring a switch or router for SSH version 2, the key strength
must be at least 768 bits for the modulus. The default is 512 bits, and it is standard
practice to double the number to 1024 bits.
132. A. The command username user1 password Password20! will create a user
account called user1 with a password of Password20!.
133. B. The command service password-encryption should be entered in global
config. It should not be kept in the configuration as it will use CPU cycles. So after it is
configured, you should perform a show running-configuration to double-check if the
encryption worked and then perform a no service password-encryption to turn it off.
134. B. The command crypto key generate rsa will generate the encryption keys for
SSH. You will be asked for the key strength, called the modulus, which should be over
768 bits to support SSH version 2.
135. A. The command exec-timeout 0 0 will disable auto-disconnect of idle privileged
exec sessions.

136. B. The line on which you are connected is always preceded by an asterisk. In this
example, you are connected to the router via line VTY 0.
137. D. After configuring the username and password combinations that will be used
on the switch or router, you will need to configure the line(s) that will use local
authentication. The command used inside of the line is login local. This will apply to
all the transport methods configured on the line.
138. D. The command enable algorithm-type scrypt secret Password20! will
change the enable password to Password20! and use the scrypt algorithm type.
139. D. The default for encryption method for passwords configured for lines is clear
text. If you want to encrypt the password, you should use the service password-
encryption command.
140. B. The command exec-timeout 30 0 will change the idle time to 30 minutes and
zero seconds. If a privileged exec session is idle for 30 minutes, the network admin
will be disconnected.
141. D. The command clear line vty 2 will disconnect a remote admin connected to
the switch. Nothing stops the admin from reconnecting to the switch again.
142. C. The exec banner will display a message to authenticated users who have
successfully logged in, regardless of whether they are connected via Telnet or SSH.
143. B. The login banner will be displayed during initial connection to a Cisco device
via SSH.
144. C. The command banner login ^CCNA Routing and Switching^ will configure the
login banner to read “CCNA Routing and Switching.” The marks at the beginning and
end of the text are delimiters to mark the beginning and end of the banner.
145. A. When a user is connecting to a router via SSH, the MOTD banner is not
displayed until after the user has authenticated to the router or switch. A login banner
is always displayed pre-login.
146. B. The AAA server will centralize authentication for Cisco routers and switches.
AAA stands for authentication, authorization, and accounting. It is pronounced “triple
A.”
147. B. RADIUS authentication uses the UDP protocol and port 1645 for
communications between the switch or router and the AAA server.
148. B. TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access Control System) is a protocol
used for communications between a switch or router and the AAA server for
authenticating users.
149. D. TACACS+ uses TCP and port 49 for communications between the switch or
router and the AAA server.
150. C. TACACS+ is a Cisco defined protocol. One of the useful features it has is that it

can authenticate a user and only allow that user to access certain commands on the
router or switch.
151. A. The command aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local will
configure AAA authentication for login using the default list and a group of TACACS+
servers for TACACS+ login first and a backup of local for authentication.
152. C. The router will lock you out since you have not provided a local account to log
in with. The password recovery procedure would need to be performed if the
configuration was saved.
153. B. The local second method should always be configured. This will ensure that if
the router’s connection to the AAA server is down, you can still gain access to diagnose
or repair.
154. B. The command radius-server host 192.168.1.5 key aaaauth will configure
the radius server 192.168.1.5 with a secret key of aaaauth.
155. D. The TACACS+ protocol will encrypt the entire packet from the switch or router
to the AAA server.

Chapter 7: Infrastructure Management (Domain 7)
1. C. The introduction of SNMP version 2c added the Inform and Get-bulk messages
for SNMP.
2. A. SNMP uses UDP port 161 for communication from an SNMP network
management station to a network device for information requests.
3. D. SNMP version 3 introduced message integrity, authentication, and encryption to
the SNMP suite.
4. B. The management information base, or MIB, is a database of variables in which
SNMP allows retrieval of information. The attributes in the MIB are the description,
variable type, and read-write status.
5. B. The network management station (NMS) is a server to which SNMP is polled
back or in which SNMP information is trapped. The NMS can escalate problems via
email, text message, or even visual indicators. Examples of NMS systems are Tivoli
Netcool and OpenNMS.
6. D. Trap messages are sent from the network device to the SNMP network
management station when an event has triggered over a set threshold on the device.
An example of an event to be trapped is an interface going down or a restriction by
port security.
7. A. Object IDs are the variables that make up the management information base.
Each object has a unique ID in a hierarchical format in the form of a tree. As an
example, 1.3.6.1.4.9.2.1.58.0 is the object that holds the router CPU utilization variable.
8. D. Inform messages differ from trap messages with respect to acknowledgment.
Trap messages employ a best effort delivery utilizing UDP. Inform messages employ
acknowledgment; while they use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), they rely on the
Application layer for acknowledgment.
9. C. SNMP version 2c is identical to SNMP version 1 with respect to security. Both
transmit information in clear text and use the security of community strings to
authenticate users for access to information.
10. D. The command snmp-server community snmpreadonly ro will configure the
SNMP agent with a community of “snmpreadonly” and set it to read only.
11. B. Standard access control lists can be used in conjunction with the SNMP agent
configuration. First a standard ACL is created containing the NMS IP. Then, when the
snmp-server command is used, it becomes the last argument. For example, a standard
ACL of 2 would be added as follows: snmp-server community snmpreadonly read-only
2.
12. B. The command snmp-server contact Sybex Publishing will configure the
contact information for the device. This information is polled into the network

management station along with the snmp-server location. It is used in case of an
outage so that the responsible person can be notified.
13. C. The command snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 version 2c C0mmun1ty will
configure the SNMP agent to send traps to the host 192.168.1.5. The version 2c
C0mmun1ty sets the SNMP version to 2c and the community to “C0mmun1ty”.
14. B. The command show snmp community will display all of the configured SNMP
community strings along with the applied access control list.
15. C. SNMP uses UDP port 162 for communication from an SNMP agent to the
network management station for trap and inform messages.
16. C. The command show snmp host will display the host that is configured to receive
notifications of trap or inform messages from the router or switch.
17. B. When you begin to configure SNMPv3 for a restricted OID, the first step is
configuring a view. The view allows or restricts what the user will have access to.
18. C. When you’re configuring the SNMPv3 group, the priv parameter will configure
privacy, which defines authentication and encryption. An example of the command is
snmp-server group1 v3 priv read view1 access read.
19. A. The command snmp-server view INT-VIEW ifIndex include will configure an
SNMPv3 view named INT-VIEW. The two parameters ifIndex include will include
the ifIndex OID. This can also be expressed as the numerical OID four, but if it is
expressed in word form, it is case sensitive.
20. C. The command show snmp user will display all SNMPv3 users. In the output you
will find the group name, the authentication protocol, and the encryption protocol.
21. B. The command show snmp group will display all SNMPv3 groups. In the output,
you will find the group name and the defined read view, write view, and notify view.
22. D. The router or switch sends syslog messages to the syslog server on port 514 with
UDP.
23. C. The command logging host 192.168.1.6 will configure all logs to be sent to the
syslog server 192.168.1.6.
24. A. The command show logging will display the configured syslog server and the
current severity level, for logs to be sent to the syslog server.
25. C. The command logging trap debugging will configure syslog events to be sent
to the syslog server for the severity levels of debugging(7) through emergency(0).
26. D. A service-level agreement (SLA) is a contracted agreement between the Internet
service provider (ISP) and the customer. This agreement defines the level of service.
SLAs are based on uptime, quality of service, bandwidth, and any other stipulations
the customer might deem necessary. Uptime is usually the most important when
shopping for a provider.

27. A. The IP service-level agreement (IP SLA) feature in a Cisco router provides the
network administrator with statistics on the performance, uptime, and monitoring of
the provider’s network connections.
28. C. Only Cisco routers contain the IP SLA feature; therefore, it can only be
configured on Cisco routers for statistic collection. Switches with the LAN Base
feature set can be used as responders, but they will lack the ability for the statistic
collection.
29. C. The IP SLA responder in not required for ICMP echo testing. However, having
an IP SLA responder allows for collection of more statistics.
30. D. The term used for the IP SLA router that sends packets and collects and
compiles statistics on the packet is IP SLA source. The IP SLA source sends these
packets to the IP SLA responder.
31. B. When you’re configuring an IP SLA for ICMP echo, the first statement, ip sla
1, will configure the IP SLA operation. This command will present an IP SLA sub-
configuration prompt, where you will enter icmp-echo 192.168.1.2. This command
configures the ICMP echo probe to a destination of 192.168.1.2.
32. A. The default timer for an IP SLA ICMP echo probe is 60 seconds. This can be
overridden with the frequency {time in seconds} command.
33. B. The command ip sla 1 schedule life forever start-time now will configure
the IP SLA operation of 1 to run forever and start immediately. Using this command,
you could create a schedule to start the probe during business hours and run it for a
finite period of time. This command must be configured in global config mode.
34. C. The command show ip sla history 1 will display the historical statistics
collected from the ICMP echo probe for IP SLA operation 1. The command will allow
you to see all of the buckets that were collected. The command ip sla statistics 1
will only show the last collected bucket’s statistical summary.
35. B. The Sense column of the statistics is the result code for the test. There are 10
different response codes, but only a few should be remembered. A result code of 1
means the test was OK, a result of 3 means the test was over the threshold, and a
result code of 4 means the operation timed out and a response was not received.
36. C. The command show file systems will display all of the file storage types
connected to the switch or router. In this output, the size in bits and the free space in
bits will be displayed.
37. B. The start-configuration for the router or switch is stored in non-volatile
random-access memory (NVRAM). This memory is similar to flash memory in that it
retains data well after the power is removed from the device.
38. A. The command copy running-config startup-config will copy the running-
config in RAM to the startup-config in NVRAM.

39. D. The command erase startup-config will erase the startup-config from
NVRAM. The only copy left after that command is configured is in RAM. Once the
power is removed, the RAM will be erased as well.
40. C. The command dir flash: will display all of the IOS images stored in the flash
filesystem. The command show flash: will work also, but read-write attributes will be
omitted.
41. C. The command copy startup-config tftp: will ask for the Trivial File Transfer
Protocol (TFTP) server address, source filename, and destination filename. It will then
proceed to copy the file over the network to the TFTP server.
42. C. The command copy tftp: running-config will ask for the TFTP server address,
source filename, and destination filename. It will then proceed to copy the file over
the network from the TFTP server.
43. A. All Cisco devices by default participate in the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP).
By using CDP, you can begin mapping the network one node at a time, discovering all
the nodes attached.
44. D. The command show cdp neighbors detail will display the IP addresses of the
routers and switches connected to the current router. The show ip route command
will only show the data plane IP addresses and not the management plane IP
addresses.
45. B. By default, Cisco devices do not participate in Link Layer Discovery Protocol
(LLDP). The first command that needs to be configured is lldp run, which starts the
switch participating in LLDP. You then need to enter the command show lldp
neighbors detail in the privileged exec mode prompt. This command will show all of
the neighboring LLDP devices.
46. A. The term used to describe Cisco’s current IOS image naming convention, which
contains all the feature sets, is universal image. The universal image contains all of
the features sets available, and a feature set can be “turned on” by providing a license
key.
47. B. A current SMARTnet contract is required to download the latest IOS for your
Cisco router or switch. SMARTnet contracts provide configuration support, parts
replacement, and software maintenance on Cisco devices.
48. C. An activation key is required to activate the features, which are already installed
in the universal image. SMARTnet agreements only cover you for upgrades to the IP
Base IOS. They do not provide upgrades of features sets called Technology Package
Licenses.
49. B. The Cisco License Manager (CLM) can be installed on Windows, Solaris, or
Linux. It allows for discovery of Cisco devices and inventory of Cisco device licenses
and connects to Cisco for access to current and new licenses purchased. The CLM
allows for management of the software activation process through its user interface.

50. C. The command show license udi will display the product ID (PID) and the
unique device identifier (UDI). Both the PID and UDI are required when activating a
license from Cisco’s license portal. The Cisco license portal will email or display the
license key required to unlock the feature set purchased.
51. A. The command show license feature will display a matrix of all the features in
the IOS, including the enforcement, evaluation, subscription, enabled, and right to use
status.
52. B. A right-to-use license will allow a customer to evaluate a feature set for 60 days.
After the 60-day period is expired, the feature set will remain active. However, after 60
days the customer is in violation of the license agreement if the feature set has not
been purchased.
53. C. The command logging synchronous will configure console logging messages to
synchronize with what is being typed so they will not disrupt the user’s input.
54. B. The command clock timezone pst -8 will set the time zone to Pacific Standard
Time with an offset of –8 from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
55. B. The command logging trap 4 will trap all messages with warnings to the syslog
server.
56. D. The command service timestamps log datetime will configure syslog
messages to be logged with the date and time rather than the arbitrary sequence
number.
57. C. The command clock summer-time EDT recurring will configure the switch for
Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).
58. A. The command logging console 0 will configure the logging to the console for
the severity level of facility 0, which is alerts.
59. C. You should configure a loopback interface on the switch with the IP address of
the NTP server the NTP clients will use. Although a Switched Virtual Interface (SVI)
would work, it is not active until at least one port is configured with the VLAN.
Therefore, the SVI is still tied to a physical interface state.
60. A. The command ntp source loopback 0 will configure the NTP service to respond
to clients from the source address of the loopback 0 interface.
61. B. The command interface loopback 0 will configure and create a pseudo
interface called loopback 0. The loopback number must be specified and the loopback
should not overlap a loopback already configured. The command ip address
192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0 will configure the IP address on the loopback interface.
62. A. The command logging buffered 1 will configure the logs stored in RAM, which
is buffered to a severity of 1. This command will include severity levels 1 and 0.
63. C. The command show history will show the last commands typed, which are kept
in the buffer. The history normally includes the last 10 commands.

64. D. The command history size 30 will extend the buffer to 30 commands for all
users. This command must be configured on the line, such as the console or VTY.
65. A. The command terminal history size 30 will extend the buffer to 30
commands for the current session. This command is configured in the privileged exec
prompt and is only active until the user logs out.
66. C. The command hostname PGH-4-209 will set the name of the router (before the
prompt) to PGH-4-209. It is always advisable to create a name that is least specific to
most specific from left to right. For example, PGH is the city, 4 is the building, and 209
is the room number where the equipment is located.
67. B. Pressing the key combination of Ctrl+A will take you to the beginning of a
command string.
68. C. Pressing the key combination of Ctrl+E will take you to the end of a command
string.
69. A. The command enable, sometimes shortened to en by seasoned Cisco admins,
will allow you to enter into privileged exec mode. In privileged exec mode, you can
change configuration.
70. A. When a router or switch boots and contains no startup-config, it will boot into
setup mode. In setup mode, you can perform a basic setup of the management IP
address and interface IP addresses. It is limited in its step-by-step configuration and
can be useful in adding a quick IP address initially for management.
71. B. The key combination of Ctrl+Z will escape you back to privileged exec mode
from configuration. If you are in a sub-configuration dialog, you would have to type
exit several times to exit back to privileged exec mode. However, if you use Ctrl+Z,
you will immediately exit back to privileged exec mode.
72. C. The command show clock will display the local time of the switch along with the
date.
73. C. The command description Connection to Switch1 will create a note that
describes what the interface is for. The description command is useful in explaining
what an interface connects to or providing service information in the case of an
outage. Only one description can be used per interface.
74. B. The command do show running-config will allow you to “do” a command
outside of the configuration prompt. This command was first introduced in IOS
version 12.3.
75. D. The command show running-config | include snmp will show the running-
config and only include lines that match snmp. Seasoned Cisco admins usually shorten
this to show running-config | i snmp, since there are no other commands that start
with the letter i after the pipe parameter.
76. C. The command show running-config interface gi 3/45 will show the running-

configuration for only interface Gi3/45.
77. B. The command clock set 2:24:00 1 august 2016 will set the clock to 2:24 a.m.
(24-hour format) and August 1, 2016.
78. A. The interface Gig 0/1 is used for the interface of es-switch2, which connects cs-
main .ntw via its interface of Gig 0/40.
79. D. The device has the capability of both a switch and a router. It is most likely a
switch that is performing SVI routing or has routing enabled.
80. C. The command show cdp neighbors detail will display all connected switches
along with their IP addresses, hostnames, and IOS version. If this command is used
from the central switch, you can quickly assess which switches need to be upgraded.
81. D. The command configure terminal allows you to enter global configuration
mode. This command will enable editing of the RAM configuration, also known as the
running-config. The command is usually shortened to conf t.
82. B. The command show terminal will allow you to verify the configured exec
timeout. It will also display the current history size and the size of paging for output.
83. C. The Ctrl+Shift+6 key sequence will cause a break during a network command
such as ping or traceroute.
84. A. The command show version will display the serial number of the switch or
router. This is usually required when calling into support to open a support ticket.
85. D. The command show running-config | begin 4/45 will show the running-
config and begin when the text 4/45 is found. It is important to note that after the |
begin, everything is case sensitive.
86. A. The command copy tftp flash will begin an interactive upgrade dialog. The
dialog will ask for the IP address of the TFTP server, the source filename on the TFTP
server, and the destination filename. It will then begin transferring the image.
87. C. The command dir flash: will display the current images on the flash memory.
It will also display how big the flash memory is and how much space is still free in
bytes.
88. C. The command verify /md5 flash:/c2900-universalk9-mz.SPA.151-4.M4.bin
eef3f723c164f2af84ccfcbd642d121d will verify the image specified for the MD5 hash
included as the last parameter. The MD5 hash is always included with the image from
Cisco’s download center and is unique for each image.
89. B. The default configuration register for a Cisco switch or router is 0x2102. The
configuration register tells the router to boot up normally and check the NVRAM for
the IOS image to boot.
90. B. The command ip scp server enable needs to be configured to enable the SSH
Copy Protocol (SCP). This command is entered in the global configuration.

91. D. The SSH Copy Protocol (SCP) will encrypt the IOS over the network during an
upgrade from the client computer.
92. C. The command username scpadmin privilege-level 15 password sybex must
be configured. This command will configure a user named scpadmin with a privilege
level of 15 (enable access) and a password of Sybex.
93. D. The command more flash:/info will display the contents of the flash:/info
file. This command is similar to the type command in the Windows OS.
94. A. The command boot system flash:/c2900-universalk9-mz.SPA.151-4.M4.bin
will configure the system to boot from flash and load the image c2900-universalk9-
mz.SPA.151-4.M4.bin.
95. C. The command config-register 0x2100 will configure the configuration register
to 0x2100. This command must be entered in global configuration mode.
96. C. The command show version will display the current configuration register. If
you have just set the configuration register, it will state on next reload which will
appear next to the configured configuration register.
97. D. When a router or switch fails to load its primary IOS image, it is reverted to a
basic system called ROMMON, which stands for ROM Monitor. The ROMMON has
very limited functionality, and it’s mainly used for password recovery or diagnostics of
the boot process.
98. A. The bootstrap process checks the startup-config in NVRAM for the boot system
command. Although the startup-config is not loaded into the IOS at this point, the
router or switch uses the startup-config to decide the IOS to load. The bootstrap
process checks the configuration register, but the IOS version to load is not
determined from the configuration register.
99. B. The command boot system flash:/c2900-universalk9-mz.SPA.151-4.M4.bin
needs to be in the startup-config since it is used during the boot process. If you enter
the command in global configuration mode, it is only resident in RAM (running-
config) and needs to be saved before power cycling the router.
100. B. Cisco routers and switches have a built-in archive process, which is not
configured by default. You can specify a time period to process the archive and specify
to write the running-config to NVRAM. An added benefit is the second archive copy,
which is saved with a time and date stamp to flash or a remote server.
101. D. The command boot system c2900-universalk9-mz.SPA.151-4.M4 .bin
192.168.1.2 will configure the router for booting of the image named c2900-
universalk9-mz.SPA.151-4.M4.bin from the 192.168.1.2 TFTP server. Under normal
circumstances this should not be used in production environments since the router
boot process is dependent upon the availability of the TFTP server.
102. B. During the bootstrap process, the IOS is decompressed to RAM. This can be

seen during the boot process as Loading "flash:/c3560-advipservicesk9-mz.122-37
.SE1.bin"...######. Once the image is decompressed, it is executed by the CPU.
103. C. When you’re performing a password recovery, the 6th bit of the configuration
register should be set to a binary value of 1. The configuration register of 0x2142 will
instruct the router to boot into the configured IOS and ignore loading the startup
configuration.
104. B. The command show version will display the current running IOS version.
Although the command show running-config or show bootvar will display the IOS
that should be loaded, only the command show version will display the current
version that actually loaded.
105. B. The IOS is stored on the flash card. Since the flash card is brand-new, nothing
is on it. When the router boots, it will not find the IOS and will boot into ROMMON
mode. From ROMMON mode, you will configure an IP address, subnet mask, gateway,
TFTP server, and image and initiate a TFTP download to flash. Once the IOS is
downloaded to flash memory, you can boot the router and verify operations.
106. B. The command copy flash:/c3560-advipservicesk9-mz.122-37.SE1.bin tftp
will copy the file in flash named c3560-advipservicesk9-mz.122-37.SE1.bin to a TFTP
server. This command will enter an interactive copy procedure. You will have to enter
the TFTP server address and confirm the source image filename and destination image
filename.
107. A. The command show archive will display all of the archived versions of the
running-config, which were archived by the archive timer.
108. B. The command configure replace flash:myconfig-3 will replace the running-
config with the third archive of the running-config, which is stored in flash.
109. D. The command time-period 1440 will specify that the archive command runs
every 1440 minutes, or 24 hours. This command must be configured in the archive
process configuration.
110. A. Cisco routers and switches require any USB flash drive to be formatted in the
FAT filesystem. Any other file system will not be recognized and mounted in the IOS
on the router or switch.
111. A. The command terminal monitor will configure the current connected method
with the ability to monitor console messages. This command is entered in privileged
exec mode and is valid only for the current session.
112. B. The command terminal no monitor when entered in privileged exec mode will
turn off the monitoring of console messages.
113. B. When you are diagnosing a network connectivity issue, you always start testing
the closest IP address. In this case, the default gateway of Router A is the closest IP
address. The switch is irrelevant because it is not a layer 3 device that can be tested at

layer 3. The fact that it has an IP address and can return a ping means that you can
communicate with its management plane, not the data plane.
114. C. The command debug ip packet will turn on debugging for IP packets. The
output will display the exit interface that the traffic is taking, to include the source and
destination IP addresses. This command should be used with caution because it could
create high CPU utilization on the router. It is recommended to be used with an ACL.
115. B. Switch Port Analyzer (SPAN) should be used to mirror the port on the switch so
that the network analyzer can capture the frames. When you use SPAN, you will see
every frame on the switch port you are monitoring.
116. B. The third hop (router) is not responding to ICMP echo requests. The traceroute
completes since the fourth hop responded and the user did not need to perform a
break on the command.
117. B. Wireshark is a popular free packet capture utility. Once the packets are
captured, they can be filtered and analyzed so that you can diagnose a networking
problem.
118. D. An extended ping allows for the source interface or IP address to be specified.
You can access the extended ping by entering the command ping without an IP
address, then following the prompt till it asks if you want extended commands.
119. C. The command monitor session 1 source interface gi 1/11 both will create
a monitor session 1 for SPAN, with the source interface in both directions. This
session will capture and mirror frames for tx (transmit) and rx (receive) on the
interface.
120. B. The command show monitor session all will display all of the SPAN session
configured on the switch. The output will display the source port and destination port
of the SPAN session.
121. A. The command monitor session 1 source vlan 23 will configure the SPAN
session of 1 with a source of VLAN 23. When you’re configuring a VLAN as the source
of a SPAN session, the direction is irrelevant since the parameter of both is implied.
122. B. The sizing of the destination port should be equal to the amount of bandwidth
that the source ports collectively can generate. When performing this calculation, you
must take into account both the RX and TX. For example, five Fast Ethernet ports can
transmit at 5 × 100 Mb/s = 500 Mb/s. They can also receive at 500 Mb/s since you are
capturing both directions. The proper sizing of the destination port should be 1 Gb/s
so that traffic is not lost out of the exit interface for the packet capture device.
123. C. The command no monitor session 1 will remove the currently configured
monitor session of 1 from the configuration.
124. D. The command monitor session 1 destination interface gi 1/14 will
configure the interface of Gi1/14 as the destination interface for the SPAN session.

The direction can be omitted because it is specified on the source interface. The
destination interface will receive a copy of the frames that are configured on the
source interface.
125. D. The details of the output show that monitor session 1 is configured to capture
interface Fa0/1 and VLAN 2 in both directions. The destination interface is Fa 0/2.
126. A. Remote Switch Port Analyzer (RSPAN) should be configured. This will allow a
source port on a remote switch to be monitored for a SPAN session on another remote
switch. An alternative to RSPAN is Encapsulated RSPAN (ERSPAN), which employs
the GRE protocol to create a tunnel.
127. A. The probe count attribute must be changed to allow multiple packets to be sent
to each hop. The default is three packets.
128. B. Line protocol up/down messages are logged to the Notifications severity level.
This can be determined by looking up the 5 that appears after the affected component
of line protocol in the syslog severity chart. For example %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN
specifies the severity level of 5 for the line protocol.
129. C. The command show processes will display the utilization of the CPU. The first
line of the output is broken down by 5 second utilization, 1 minute utilization, and 5
minute utilization.
130. A. The command logging buffered will direct buffering of log messages to RAM.
This command can be undone by using the no directive in front of logging buffered.
The command must be entered in global configuration mode.
131. B. The control plane refers to any mechanism that controls the data plane.
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is used to control the data plane by removing redundant
links.
132. C. The management plane is any mechanism that helps in the management of a
router or switch. Some of the common mechanisms are SSH and Telnet. However, any
mechanism that the router uses for management is considered part of the
management plane.
133. C. The software-defined network (SDN) controller replaces the control plane on
SDN devices. The SDN devices in the network do not contain a control plane locally
and instead are controlled by the SDN controller.
134. B. The southbound interface (SBI) directly communicates with the SDN devices.
This control is done via several different types of SBI protocols, such as OpenFlow,
OpFlex, CLI (Telnet/SSH).
135. C. An application program interface (API) is a method the programmer has
created to allow other programs to communicate with their program. The inter-
programmability is required when another program wants to share data with the API.
136. A. The data plane is responsible for switching and routing data. Any data that is

destined for endpoints is switched or routed on the data plane. For example, when one
computer pings another, the ping is switched and routed on the data plane.
137. C. The northbound interface (NBI) is responsible for allowing communication
between applications and the core of the controller. Applications therefore directly
communicate with the core through the northbound interface.
138. B. Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs normally utilize HTTP for
moving data. It performs this via a get URI and it receives a response in XML, JSON,
or another date transfer language. Although you can encrypt the HTTP traffic with SSL
(HTTPS), its core language is still HTTP.
139. A. The Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) is Cisco’s SDN
controller. This package is freely downloadable from the Cisco DevNet website as of
the writing of this book. It comes with several built-in apps, such as a plug and play
module and a path trace module. Many other apps can be built on top of the APIC to
extend functionality of the controller.
140. B. Routing protocols such as OSPF and EIGRP would perform their function on
the control plane, since they are controlling the routing of the data plane.

Chapter 8: Practice Test 1
1. B. Structured Query Language (SQL) operates at the Session layer of the OSI model.
It uses half-duplex communications to request data and receive the reply. Other
examples of Session layer protocols are Network File System (NFS), Server Message
Block (SMB), and NetBIOS.
2. D. The 802.11ac protocol will be least likely to overlap the wireless channels the
tenants are using. The 802.11ac protocol uses the 5 GHz wireless frequency spectrum.
The 5 GHz spectrum defines 24 non-overlapping wireless channels. The 2.4 GHz
spectrum defines 11 channels, but only 3 of them are non-overlapping. Although
802.11n operates on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, 802.11ac only operates on 5 GHz. Therefore,
802.11ac will have the least likely overlap of current channels.
3. C. Flow control is a function of the Transport layer of the Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) model. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) operates at the
Transport layer. UDP provides a program with a connectionless method of
transmitting segments. TCP is a connection-based protocol and maintains a state
throughout the transfer of data.
4. C. Platform as a Service (PaaS) is commonly used by software developers. It
provides a development platform that the software developer can use to create
applications. An example of this is a web server with PHP and MySQL, which is hosted
in the cloud.
5. D. Crossover cables are wired with the 568B specification on one side, and on the
other side, the 568A specification is used. This change in wiring delivers the TX pair
on pins 4 and 5 to the RX pair on pins 1 and 2. Straight-through cables are wired with
the 568B specification on one side, and on the other side, the 568B specification is
used.
6. A. Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) relies on the Neighbor Discovery
Protocol (NDP). NDP works by using multicast and ICMPv6 message types. The host
will multicast to ff02::1 an ICMPv6 Router Solicitation (RS) message, and the router
will respond with a Router Advertisement (RA) message. This response will allow the
host to obtain the network address and gateway of the network. The host will then
create a host address portion of the IPv6 address and use the Duplicate Address
Discovery (DAD) protocol to check for a duplicate address.
7. B. The IPv6 address 2202:0ff8:0002:2344:3533:8eff:fe22:ae4c is an EUI-64
generated address. The host portion of the address is 3533:8eff:fe22:ae4c, the fffe in
the middle of it depicts that the address was generated from the MAC address. The
MAC address of this host would be 37-33-8e-02-ae-4c. When EUI-64 is used, an ffee is
placed in the middle of the MAC address, and then the 7th bit from the left is flipped.
This changes the first two hex digits of the MAC address from 35 to 37.
8. C. The network 192.168.4.32/27 has a valid IP address range of 192.168.4.33 to

192.168.4.62. The /27 CIDR notation, or 255.255.255.224 dotted-decimal notation
(DDN) defines networks in multiples of 32. Therefore, the address 192.168.4.28/27 is
part of the 192.168.4.32/27 network.
9. B. The first field after the preamble and Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) is the
destination MAC address. The destination MAC address is always first because
switches need to make forwarding decisions upon reading the destination MAC
address.
10. A. The forward/filter function of a switch is used to look up the destination MAC
address in a MAC address table and decide the egress interface for the frame. If the
MAC address is not in the table, the frame is forwarded out all of the interfaces. When
the client responds, its source MAC address will be recorded in the MAC address table
for future lookup.
11. B. Access ports strip all VLAN information before the frame egresses the
destination interface. The endpoint on an access switchport will never see any of the
VLAN information that was associated with the frame.
12. D. The command switchport trunk allowed vlan 12 will remove all other VLANs
and only VLAN 12 will be allowed on the trunk interface. The proper command to add
an additional VLAN would be switchport trunk allowed vlan add 12. This command
will add a VLAN to the already established list.
13. B. Switch A and Switch B are participating in VLAN tagging. Therefore, Switch A
interface Gi0/1 and Switch B interface Gi0/1 are both configured as trunk switchports.
This will allow VLAN tagging across the trunk link.
14. C. Switch B has the lowest MAC address of all of the switches. Therefore, Switch B
will become the RSTP root bridge. All ports leading back to Switch B will become the
root ports. Switch A interface Gi1/8, Switch D interface Fa2/16, and Switch C interface
Gi1/3 will become root ports.
15. B. When you configure the switchport to a mode of access, you are statically
configuring the interface to remain an access switchport. When you configure the
switchport to nonegotiate, you are turning off Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP). The
switch will never negotiate its switchport.
16. A. The command channel-group 1 mode passive configures the port to be placed
in a passive negotiating state. The other switch must be placed into an active
negotiating state for LACP to become the control protocol for the channel group.
17. B. When BPDU Guard is configured on a port, it guards the port from creating a
loop. It also guards STP so that the STP calculation of redundant links is not affected
by the device connect to the interface. If a BPDU is seen on the interface, the interface
will immediately enter into an err-disable state. The most likely cause was that
another switch was plugged into the interface.
18. D. The VLAN Trunking Protocol assists in synchronizing a VLAN database across

all Cisco switches participating in VTP. You must initially configure the VTP domain
on the switch that will hold the master database. Then all other switches must be
configured as clients and the VTP domain must be configured as well.
19. C. The 802.1w Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol defines that designated switchports
always forward traffic. The designated port is a port that is forwarding traffic and is
opposite of the root port or blocking port if it is a redundant link.
20. B. There is a total of three frames that are encapsulated during the process of Host
A sending a packet to Host B. In the exhibit, there are two hubs and two routers. The
first frame is encapsulated from A to Router A. The second frame is encapsulated from
Router A to Router B. The third frame is encapsulated from Router B to Host B.
21. C. The administrative distance (AD) is a rating of trust between different routing
protocols and route methods. This trust scale is important when multiple routes exist
to the same destination. Directly connected routes have ADs with the highest level of
trust.
22. A. Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) uses bandwidth and
delay by default for calculating routes. The bandwidth should be set to the actual
bandwidth of the link so that routing protocols such as EIGRP can calculate the best
route. Delay cannot be set because it is a variable of the interface.
23. C. The administrative distance (AD) of EIGRP is 90. The most common ADs are 90
for EIGRP, 100 for IGRP, 110 for OSPF, and 120 for RIP. The mnemonic of 90 Exotic
Indian Oval Rubies will help you remember the order; then starting with EIGRP with
a value of 90, increment the following values by 10.
24. A. The command network 203.244.234.0 will advertise the 203.244.234.0 network.
When you’re configuring RIP, only the network address needs to be configured with
the network command.
25. C. In the exhibit, packets are being sent to the router via a trunk link. A setup
where the packets for VLANs are sent to a router for routing between VLANs is called
Router on a Stick (ROAS) routing.
26. D. When you want to turn on the layer 3 functionality of a switch, you must
configure the command ip routing in global configuration. This is required when you
want to create switched virtual interfaces (SVIs) for VLANs and want to route on the
switch between the VLANs. This method of routing is much more efficient since the
traffic is routed in the ASICs on the switch.
27. D. The summary route of 172.16.32.0/21 contains 172.16.38.0/24 as a valid network
route. The /21 CIDR mask defines networks in multiples of 8 in the third octet of the
network address. Therefore, the next network address is 172.16.40.0/21.
28. C. The entries with the dash in the Age column represent the physical interfaces of
the router. If the entries were configured statically, their type would reflect a status of
static.

29. B. Link State Advertisement (LSA) packets communicate the topology of the local
router with other routers in the OSPF area. The information contained in the LSA
packet is a summary of links the local router’s topology consists of.
30. C. Time to Live (TTL) is a field in the IP header that prevents packets from
endlessly routing in networks. Each time a packet is routed, the router’s responsibility
is to decrement the TTL by one. When the TTL reaches zero, the packet is considered
unrouteable and dropped.
31. B. Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a layer 2 wide area network (WAN) protocol.
PPP supports Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), which secures
connections. Although Metro Ethernet is built site to site by the service provider, there
is no guarantee of security in the form of authentication.
32. A. The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) is a layer 3 QoS marking for
routers and layer 3 devices. The DSCP markings are located in the Type of Service
(ToS) field in an IP header. Class of Service (CoS) is a layer 2 QoS service marking
found in 802.1Q frames.
33. B. Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) does not support multicast packets. If you
require both, you can set up a GRE tunnel for the multicast and broadcast traffic, then
encrypt only the data over IPSec. However, by itself IPSec does not support multicast
or broadcast traffic.
34. D. Both the customer edge (CE) routers and the provider edge (PE) routers can
host area 0. However, the service provider must support area 0, called the super
backbone, on its PE routers since all areas must be connected to area 0. The customer
chooses whether the CE participates in area 0.
35. C. A trust boundary is the point in the network where the QoS markings are
trusted from the devices connected to it. A network administrator will create a trust
boundary where a VoIP phone will placed. Since the VoIP phone will be trusted, the
markings will be accepted and used for priority throughout the network. The trust
boundary should always be placed closest to the IT-controlled equipment.
36. C. The Cisco Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network (DMVPN) is always
configured in a hub-and-spoke topology. The central router creates a multiport GRE
connection between all of the branch routers.
37. C. The DHCP Negative Acknowledgment (NACK) message is issued by the DHCP
server to the client when a client requests an IP address the DHCP cannot lease. This
often happens when two DHCP servers are misconfigured in the same LAN with two
different scopes. One server will issue the NACK message when it hears the request
destined for the other DHCP server.
38. C. Router C will become the active router since it has the highest priority. The
default priority of HSRP is 100, and therefore, the router with the highest priority will
become the active router. It is important to note that nothing will change if

preemption is not configured on the routers.
39. D. When a DHCP server sends the DHCP Offer message in response to a DHCP
Discover message, the client’s MAC address is used in the response.
40. B. The access list is misconfigured. It must match the address that will be allowed
through the NAT process. The access list is configured for 192.168.2.0/24. The private
IP address network is 192.168.1.0/24. The NAT pool can overlap with a physical
interface. It allows for the IP address configured on the physical interface to also be
used for NAT.
41. C. The computer will not be allowed to communicate, and the port will enter an
err-disable state. The defaults for port security allow for only one MAC address, and
the default violation is shutdown. The violation of shutdown will shut the port down
and place it into an err-disable state, which will require administrative intervention.
42. A. TACACS+ will allow for authentication of users, and it also provides a method of
restricting users to specific commands. This allows for much granular control of
lower-level administrators.
43. C. You can have only one access control list (ACL) per direction, per protocol, and
per interface. Therefore, each of the two interfaces can have both an inbound and
outbound ACL, per the protocol of IPv4. This allows for a total of four ACLs, which can
be used to control access through the router.
44. D. Once the password has been forgotten, a password recovery must be performed
on the router. Although you have the encrypted password, it cannot be reversed since
it is a hash of the password. A hash is a one-way encryption of the password; only the
same combination of letters and number will produce the same hash.
45. B. The command access-list 2 permit 192.168.2.3 0.0.0.0 will perform the
same function as access-list 2 permit host 192.168.2.3. The command configures
the host 192.168.2.3 with a bit mask, which will only match the single IP address.
Although it can be configured as a bit mask, it should be configured via the host
parameter for readability.
46. A. The command license install
usbflash0:FTX3463434Z_2016030415234562345.lic will install the license file to the
router. This command must be entered in privileged exec mode.
47. B. By default, all syslog messages are sent to the console of the router or switch. It
is recommended to configure a syslog server, because once the router or switch is
powered off, the information is lost.
48. C. The configuration register of 0x2142 is used for the password recovery process.
The configuration register will tell the boot process to ignore the contents of NVRAM,
which is where the startup-configuration is located. It will only use NVRAM for the
location of the boot system variable.

49. D. The Cisco Discovery Protocol functions on the management plane of the SDN
model. It helps with management of the routers and switches and does not directly
impact the data plane.
50. D. The network management station (NMS) must be configured with the version
of SNMP, the community, and the management information base (MIB) before it can
access the counters on a router or switch.

Chapter 9: Practice Test 2
1. C. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) functions on layer 2, the Data Link layer.
It helps the Data Link layer resolve the destination MAC address for framing of data.
2. B. During the three-way-handshake, Computer A sends a SYN flag along with its
receiving window size and initial sequence number. Then Computer B sends a SYN
flag and ACK flag along with its receiving window and acknowledgment of the
sequence number. Finally, Computer A sends an ACK flag, which acknowledges the
synchronization of Computer B’s receiving window. Communication begins and is
considered to be in an established state.
3. D. Rapid elasticity is the ability to add and remove compute capability in the cloud.
As demand is needed, compute power can be increased by adding more CPUs or
servers. As demand for compute power decreases, CPUs or servers can be removed.
4. B. The distribution layer is a partial mesh topology. Links between the distribution
switches and core switches are multi-homed to each device for redundancy. Also, the
links between the distribution switches and access switches are multi-homed to each
device for redundancy. Although, this might seems to be a full mesh topology, the
distribution switches are not connected to each other.
5. B. Single-mode fiber is typically used in high-speed long-distance transmission of
data. It can span up to 70 kilometers (km) with the proper transceivers. The speeds of
single-mode fiber can be up the 100 Gb/s with the proper transceivers.
6. C. Documenting the problem is the last step in resolving a problem. After you
monitor the problem for the implementation of the fix, the documentation should
describe the problem, the root cause of the problem, and the resolution. The
documentation can then be used for future problems that match the same criteria.
7. D. The IP address 225.34.5.4 is a multicast IP address. Multicast IP addresses are
defined as Class D addresses in the range 224.0.0.1 to 239.255.255.254.
8. C. In IPv6, the solicited-node multicast message is used for resolution of the MAC
address for an IPv6 address. The first 104 bits of the 128-bit IPv6 address is ff02::1:ff,
and the last 24 bits comprise the last 24 bits of the IPv6 address that needs to be
resolved. The solicited-node multicast message is also used for Duplicate Address
Detection (DAD).
9. B. Field C in the exhibit is the type field. The type field is used to define the upper-
layer protocol the data belongs to.
10. C. When the destination MAC address is not in the MAC address table, the switch
will flood the frame to all ports on the switch. When the computer or device responds,
the switch will memorize the source MAC address with the port on which it sees the
traffic.
11. B. The switch has negotiated with the adjacent switch to become a trunk and set its

trunking protocol to 802.1Q. The letter n in front of 802.1Q specifies it was negotiated.
When a switch is set to auto for the Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP), it will respond
to trunking requests but will not initiate DTP messages. The adjacent switch must be
set to desirable, since the desirable mode will send DTP messages.
12. C. The two switches have a duplex mismatch. The duplex mismatch is a direct
result of statically configuring only one side of the link to full-duplex. Switch A is not
participating in port negotiation. Both sides must be configured statically the same or
set to auto.
13. C. When implementing Router on a Stick (ROAS), you must first create a trunk to
the router. Once the trunk is created, you must create subinterfaces for each VLAN to
be routed and specify the IP address and 802.1Q encapsulation.
14. B. An 802.1Q frame is a modified Ethernet frame. The type field is relocated after
the 4 bytes used for 802.1Q tagging. Two of the bytes are used for tagging the frame,
and two of the bytes are used for controls such as Class of Service (CoS).
15. D. The exhibit shows several MAC addresses that have been dynamically assigned
to the MAC address table. Since all of these MAC addresses have been seen on
interface Gi1/1, it is safe to say that a switch or hub is connected to it. The output does
not depict if the link is an access or trunk link.
16. C. Under normal circumstances, when VLANs are configured, they are stored in a
file separate from the startup or running-configuration. The VLAN database is stored
in a file called vlan.dat on the flash. When decommissioning a switch, if you were to
erase the configuration of a switch, you would also need to delete the vlan.dat.
17. D. Switches that are configured in transparent mode will not process VTP updates.
They will, however, forward the updates to switches that are connected to them.
Transparent mode switches store their VLAN database in their running-configuration
and startup-configuration.
18. B. The long delay for the device to become active on the interface is the wait time
for convergence of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). If the interface will only connect a
device to the port, then the port should be configured with spanning-tree PortFast
mode. This will skip the blocking mode during convergence of STP.
19. A. When both Switch A and Switch B are configured as auto for DTP, the link will
not form a trunk since neither switch is sending negotiation messages. The ports will
remain in access mode.
20. B. When all of the ports on a switch are in designated mode, it means that the
switch is the root bridge for the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).
21. B. Routing Information Protocol (RIP) does not contain a topology table. RIP
compiles its table from multiple broadcasts or multicasts in the network from which it
learns routes. However, it never has a full topological diagram of the network like
OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP.

22. D. The split horizons method prevents routing updates from exiting an interface in
which they have been learned. This stops false information from propagating in the
network, which can cause a routing loop.
23. A. The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) priority for a router is a value of 1. This
priority is used when electing a designated router (DR) and backup designated router
(BDR). The higher the value, the higher the chances of the router becoming a DR or
BDR.
24. D. When configuring OSPF for the designated router (DR), if you configure
another router with a higher priority, the original DR will remain the current DR.
OSPF does not allow for preemption, and therefore you must force the election by
clearing the OSPF process on the DR. This will force the DR to relinquish its status.
25. C. The command of maximum-paths 6 will configure the maximum number of
unequal paths for load balancing with EIGRP to a value of 6. This command must be
entered in the router EIGRP process.
26. A. Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) allows the CPU to initially populate a sort of
route cache called the forwarding information base (FIB). Any packets entering the
router can be checked against the FIB and routed without the help of the CPU.
27. C. The multicast address of ff02::a is the multicast address for IPv6 EIGRP
updates. Updates for routers participating in IPv6 EIGRP will be multicast to the IPv6
address of ff02::a.
28. C. The command no switchport will configure the interface as a layer 3 routed
interface. The command ip routing needs to be configured for routing of the
interface, but it will not hinder assigning an IP address.
29. C. The command passive-interface default when entered in the EIGRP router
process will suppress hello messages for all interfaces. You can then include only the
interfaces on which you want hello messages to be advertised with the command no
passive-interface gi 0/1.
30. B. The command show ip cef will display all of the network prefixes and the next
hop that Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) has in the forwarding information base
(FIB). The command will also display the exit interface for the next hop.
31. C. The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) supports compression, authentication, error
detection, and correction. PPP can detect errors in the transmission and request
retransmission of the packets.
32. C. This is a debug of outgoing packets, and therefore the configuration problem is
on this router. This router’s username must match the adjacent router’s hostname
and both passwords must match.
33. B. The provider edge (PE) router is responsible for adding the MPLS label to a
packet.

34. B. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are extremely scalable because they only
require an Internet connection at each site. We can reuse the existing Internet
connection at each site to create a site-to-site VPN tunnel.
35. C. The command service-policy USER-MAP out will configure the policy map
called USER-MAP on the interface in an outbound direction.
36. D. The web server’s IP address is referred to as the outside global address in
reference to Network Address Translation (NAT).
37. C. The Network Time Protocol (NTP) defines 16 levels of stratums. A stratum of
zero has absolute precision, such as an atomic clock, which also has little or no delay.
When an NTP clock is timed off a stratum zero clock, it becomes a stratum one, and
when an NTP clock is timed off of a stratum one, it becomes a stratum two. The
process continues onward, adding a one to each slave unit, as delay increases and you
move further away from absolute precision.
38. C. When Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) is used, the default gateway the
client is issued is an IP address for the virtual router. The virtual router is not a
physical router, but it is mapped to a physical router via HSRP. The active router
processes requests for the virtual router IP address by responding to the virtual MAC
address associated with the virtual router IP address.
39. C. When interface tracking is turned on and a link that is being tracked fails, the
priority of the active router is lowered, and an election is forced. This will make the
standby router become the active router. However, if the link is repaired, the priority
will recover to its normal value, but the current active router will remain the active
router. Preemption allows for the value to instantly reelect the original router as the
active router.
40. B. The Start of Authority (SOA) record establishes several key pieces of
information, such as the primary DNS server, the timers for refreshing DNS entries,
and a default time to live (TTL). The default TTL is used when a resource record is not
explicitly configured with a TTL.
41. D. An attacker will take advantage of the automatic trunking configuration of
Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP). This will allow the attacker to create a trunk with
the switch and tag packets so that they can hop onto different VLANs.
42. A. When you are configuring port security on an interface, the switchport should
have a mode of access configured. This will also protect the switch from transitioning
into a trunk if another switch is connected.
43. C. Port security can prevent MAC address flooding attacks by restricting the
number of MAC addresses associated to an interface. This will prevent the Content
Addressable Memory (CAM) from being overrun by bogus entries.
44. A. The command access-list 101 deny tcp 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 23
will deny TCP traffic from 192.168.2.0/24 to any address with a destination of 23

(Telnet). The command access-list 101 permit ip any any will permit all other
traffic.
45. B. Conventional access lists lack the ability to edit a single entry. The entire ACL
must be removed and re-added with the correct entry. An alternative to conventional
access lists is named access lists. A named access list is referenced by line numbers,
which allows for removal and additions of single entries.
46. A. Trap messages are sent from Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
agents to the network management station (NMS). This happens when an event that
the router or switch is set to alert the NMS about is triggered. An example of this is
overheating of the switch or an important link going down.
47. B. Simple Network Management Protocol version 2c lacks security. The only
mechanism you can employ for security is complex community names. Security was
introduced in version 3 of SNMP.
48. B. The command interface range gigabitethernet 1/1 - 12 will allow you to
configure the interfaces Gigabit Ethernet 1/1 to 1/12.
49. D. The default syslog facility level is debug 7. All debug messages are logged to the
internal buffer by default.
50. C. The command ip ftp username USER will configure the username USER for
FTP connections. The command ip ftp password USERPASS will configure the
password USERPASS for FTP connections.
