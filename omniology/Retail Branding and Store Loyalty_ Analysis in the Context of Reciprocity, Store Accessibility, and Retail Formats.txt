Th e book series focuses on the fi elds of Retailing and International Marketing. Th e-
se two areas represent the research fi elds of the editors—each of them as a single 
research area, but also in combination.
Both of these research areas are widely understood. Consequently, the series provi-
des a platform for the publication of doctoral theses and habilitations, conference 
proceedings and edited books, as well as related methodological issues that encom-
pass the focus of the series. Th e series is broad in the sense that it covers academic 
works in the area of consumer-oriented marketing as well as the area of market-
oriented management.
In addition to academic works recommended by the editors, the book series also 
welcomes other academic contributions. Th ese may be submitted to the editors and 
will be published in the book series aft er a positive assessment.

Preface 
 
Beside traditionally discussed brand equity models the view of retailers as 
brands is gaining importance. Retail researchers started to focus on the topic 
of retail branding in the nineties and it became a top management research 
priority, as a company’s brand is the most intangible asset also for retailers. 
However, on the one hand, retailers use their brand not only to differentiate 
themselves from their competitors in consumers’ minds but also for brand ex-
tensions. On the other hand, customers benefit in considering retail brands 
due to self-identification and simplification of e.g. store choice. However, con-
sumers perceive the “company-planned” brand position in a specific manner. 
Thus, detailed knowledge on how to create strong retail brands in relation to a 
retailer’s corporate reputation, on how strong brands drive customer purchase 
behavior in the light of local competition of single stores, and how format-
specific attributes drive retail brand equity across countries is of paramount 
relevance to retailers which aim to build on strong retail brands. The objective 
of Bettina Berg’s thesis is to gain a deeper knowledge of retail brands as driv-
ers of loyalty in the aforementioned important retail contexts and to give retail-
ers some advice. Addressing these issues the dissertation of Bettina Berg 
deals with three studies: 
- Reciprocal Effects of the Corporate Reputation and Store Equity of Retailers: 
This study examines the reciprocal interdependencies of the locally perceived 
retail brand in relation to retailers’ corporate or chain reputation, considering 
their mutual influence on customers’ loyalty. Based on cross-sectional, two 
longitudinal surveys as well as an experiment, the findings suggest that retail 
store equity interacts with corporate reputation and is a more important driver 
of store loyalty than corporate reputation. Thus, retailers should pay attention 
to reciprocal effects, especially when deciding on the relative allocation of in-
vestments across corporate and store levels. 
- Retail Branding and Local Competition – The Importance of Retail Brand Equi-
ty and Store Accessibility for Store Loyalty in Local Competition: This study ex-
amines the retail brand effects on store loyalty in the light of local competition 
and in conjunction with store’s locally perceived store accessibility, which is a 
highly relevant mantra in retailing. Based on surveys at 30 store locations of a 

VI 
Preface 
focal retailer and its strongest local competitor the findings show that store loy-
alty benefits more from a strong brand than from location, that location can 
benefit from a strong brand, that a competitor’s brand equity has an negative 
influence on loyalty towards a focal retailer, and that the strength of these ef-
fects depends on the local competitive context. 
- International Transfer and Perception of Retail Formats – A Comparison Study 
in Germany and Romania: This study examines the perception of retail brands 
and the drivers of retail brands in the light of different retail formats, considering 
retailers from developed markets doing business with the same retail formats 
in emerging countries. Based on consumer surveys in two countries the find-
ings suggest that similar core attributes equally affect format-specific retail 
brands and store loyalty in both markets. The findings also suggest that retail-
ers transferring their formats from their home to host countries should place 
particular emphasis on managing the core attributes of a specific format, as 
these attributes are of paramount importance for establishing retailers as a 
strong brand. 
With her work Dr. Bettina Berg makes a significant contribution to retailing re-
search. She significantly disentangles the interrelation of retailers’ corporate repu-
tation and store equities and advances knowledge on retail positioning as strong 
brands in different local competitive situations as well as formats in different coun-
tries. Her work impressed on the one hand with the extent of attention paid to the 
conceptualization but also with the combination of different types of studies and 
methodologies. I’m in particular very happy with her work, as Dr. Bettina Berg 
presents the tenth dissertation at my Chair for Marketing & Retailing at the Uni-
versity of Trier. I thank Bettina Berg for four years of working as research assis-
tant at my chair. I got to know her as honorable and always kind minded person 
and I wish Dr. Bettina Berg very warmly all the best for her carrier as well as her 
private life in her future.

The present thesis was developed as research assistant at the Chair for Mar-
keting & Retailing at the University of Trier. After four years of conceptualiza-
tions and re-conceptualizations, estimations and re-estimations, writing and re-
writing, and asking thousands of people to answer the questionnaires I am 
proud to succeed in finalizing my dissertation project. 
This work would have never been possible without the commitment of my su-
pervisor, colleagues, friends, and family. 
First, I have to thank Prof. Dr. Prof. h.c. Bernhard Swoboda, who gave me the 
opportunity in 2008 to pursue my doctorate. We had a lot of fruitful discussions 
that led to an improvement of my work. I also acknowledge some interesting 
events I was able to attend beside my regular work during my assistantship: I 
had the opportunity to do a two-month research stay in Phoenix (Arizona); I 
had the chance to attend conferences from the most important marketing as-
sociations in Oslo (Norway), Nantes (France), and Saint Petersburg (USA), I 
tought students at the University of Babe܈-Bolyai in Cluj-Napoca (Romania) 
and at the University of Applied Sciences in Trier, I also attended workshops 
and doctoral colloquia and learned much from my participation at several prac-
tice projects.  
Further, I have to thank Prof. Dr. Hanna Schramm-Klein (University of Siegen) 
for the evaluation of my Ph.D. thesis within a short time frame. I also appreci-
ate that Prof. Dr. Lutz Richter (University of Trier) took over the chairmanship 
of the oral examination committee.  
Second, I would like to thank my colleagues that accompanied greater or 
shorter time frames during my doctorate. Dr. Stefan Elsner, Dr. Martin Jager, 
Margot Löwenberg, Dr. Markus Meierer, Edith OIejnik, Dr. Karin Pennemann, 
Cathrin Puchert, Dr. Sandra Sommer, and Julia Weindel enriched my time with 
discussions, ruminations, and amusements. I will also never forget our daily 
browsing through the supermarket in the afternoons, searching for new prod-
ucts and ready-to-eat alternatives for another dinner at University. Memories of 

VIII 
Acknowledgements 
our “French Evenings”, “Cake Mondays”, and yearly visit to the Christmas 
Market always put a smile on my face as does our coffee brakes. Moreover, 
my thanks also go to Dr. Dan-Cristian Dabija, several students that attended 
my seminars, and the students for whom I co-supervised their theses; without 
their help I would have never coped with interviewing thousand of respondents 
myself. 
Third, I would like to thank my friends. I know that they had to enjoy my ab-
sence several times as well as to handle diverse appointment cancellations 
and I appreciate that I can still call them my friends. Nevertheless, thinking 
about “Oktoberfest-Breakfast” and “Wellness-Weekend”, they managed to take 
my mind off my doctoral thesis and I am grateful for their persistence.  
Special gratitude is dedicated to my partner, Dr. Matthias Weimann. His con-
tinuous support and tireless commitment led me to ship around some sharp 
cliff. 
Finally, I emphasize my thanks to my family. Without the education, support 
and love of my parents and my brother, Margit, Gottfried, and Thomas Berg, 
this chapter in my life would have been much harder.

Introduction

Relevance and Focus 
Retail brands are gaining importance and are relevant for retailers and cus-
tomers. Retail scientists and practitioners started to focus on the topic of retail 
branding in the mid-nineties (Ailawadi and Keller 2004, see also the special 
issue of the Journal of Retailing in 2004), although the branding topic was al-
ready relevant for manufacturing firms. It became a top management research 
priority because a company’s brand is the most intangible asset, not only for 
manufacturing firms, but also for retailers (Keller and Lehmann 2006). Brands 
are said to help with differentiation and ease the path of communication. How-
ever, retailers use their brand not only to differentiate themselves from their 
competitors in consumers’ minds, but also for brand extensions (e.g., Wal-Mart 
and Carrefour use their retail brands for different retail formats, and other gro-
cery retailers use their retail brand to brand own products i.e. store brands).1 
Regarding customers’ benefit in considering retail brands, the advantage for 
customers relates to identification, prestige, and ease of choice (Hälsig 2008). 
However, retailers strive to position their retail brand in a specific manner 
(coder), but consumers also perceive the brand in a specific manner (decod-
er). Therefore, “the power of a brand lies in the minds of consumers” (Leone et 
al. 2006), thus the focus of this doctoral thesis is to analyze customers’ inter-
pretation and perception of retail brands and the related effects.  
Retailers are increasingly listed as strong brands in Interbrand’s yearly assess-
ment of the best 100 global brands (see Table A–1), which considers the brand 
value (derived from financial performance, role of the brand, and brand 
strength). However, it becomes apparent that there are very few retailers listed 
that offer products from different manufacturers (e.g., Amazon), whereas the 
world’s biggest grocery retailer, Wal-Mart, is not ranked for example. Most of the 
retail brands listed offer their own apparel, luxury goods, or fast food. Still, there 
is a very high backlog demand for managing retailer brands. The undisputed 
best brands are McDonalds and Nike, who have retained their brand positions

over the years. Louis Vuitton, Apple and Amazon worked continuously on their 
brands over the past decade and achieved quite a good position in 2011 com-
pared to 2001. Newcomers in the list are Zara and H&M, where the latter start-
ed with quite a good position in 2008 and succeeded in maintaining it.

Introduction 
3 
A recent consumer survey reveals the winners and losers in the German retail 
market (Batten & Company 2012). Over 1,400 respondents rated the brand 
strength of retailers from different retail sectors. The strongest brand for Ger-
man customers is Amazon, followed by Aldi, and DM. The German electronic 
retail brands Media-Markt and Saturn (both owned by Metro Group) lost sev-
eral ranking positions, as did Schlecker, and Kik. It must be emphasized that 
the survey took place before Schlecker became insolvent. Thus, it is obvious 
that customers’ positive perception of a retailer’s brand is a strong intangible 
asset for the retailer’s success or failure. 
A retail brand drives consumer behavior and, in turn, retailers’ performance. 
Consumer research was known to be a topic that was dedicated to manufac-
turers of consumer goods, but these days consumer behavior has also gained 
major importance in retailing (Puccinelli et al. 2009). Scholars have started to 
examine the drivers of consumer behavior, i.e., store patronage, store choice 
and store loyalty, and revealed that customers’ positive retail brand percep-
tions enhance consumers’ behavior towards the retailer (Pan and Zinkhan 
2006; Ailawadi and Keller 2004). As already mentioned, a retail brand is a 
strong intangible asset for retailers. This strength becomes apparent as a retail 
brand is able to attract consumers (Jinfeng and Zhilong 2009) and to enhance 
store loyalty, which is viewed as a core predictor of consumer spending 
(Macintosh and Lockshin 1997). In turn, it should be noted that, with a retail 
brand’s influence on customers’ loyalty toward a retailer, a retail brand can en-
hance retailers’ performance (Brown et al. 2006). Thus, this doctoral thesis is 
not only focused on customers’ perceptions of a retail brand, but also on its 
effects on store loyalty in different contexts. 
Retail brands are relevant at different levels. The perception of brands in retail-
ing takes place at different levels (Burt and Davies 2010). Customer percep-
tions may occur at an organizational or chain level, depending on whether a 
non-diversified or diversified retailer is evaluated. Furthermore, customers may 
perceive a brand at a fairly local level, i.e., at the store level (Ou, Abratt, and 
Dion 2006). This occurs within a competitive marketplace and with frequent 
customer visits. A third perceptional level of brands in retailing is dedicated to 
products, i.e. a retailer’s store brand (Martenson 2007). This rising complexity 
of different perceptional levels of a retailer’s brand expands when considering 

4 
Chapter A 
that the focus of consumer perceptions may not be solely directed at the re-
tailer as a brand and the store as a brand, whereas the latter explains that cus-
tomers perceive retailers’ stores also at a very local level with different loca-
tions, physical facilities, and competitors (Ou, Abratt, and Dion 2006). There 
are several forms of consumer perceptions, for example the reputation of a 
retailer (Walsh, Beatty, and Shiu 2009) must also be taken into consideration. 
However, there is a need for clear distinctions between different marketing 
concepts, i.e. between reputation and image (Gotsi and Wilson 2001). Against 
the background of different perceptional levels of customers, it is of interest to 
consider whether and how consumer perceptions relating to different levels, 
i.e. retailer’s reputation and the store as a brand, interact with each other and 
whether they have mutual influence on customers’ store loyalty.  
Is the retail brand de facto the most important asset in retailing? Despite the 
undisputed relevance of retail brands to store loyalty and, in turn, to retailers’ 
performance, it is worth considering whether other important success drivers 
exist in retailing. As consumers can decide when and where (e.g., in store or 
online) they want to shop, “the only location for retail is where the customers 
are” (Interbrand 2012, p. 4). Thus, it is not surprising that the old mantra of “lo-
cation, location, location” is still seen as the key to success in retailing 
(Grewal, Levy, and Kumar 2009). As location has become relevant, real 
(bricks and mortar) and virtual (online) location is still of greatest importance 
for retailers (Interbrand 2012). However, Bell, Ho, and Tang (1998) found at 
the end of the 1990s that the relevance of location for consumers’ store choice 
is decreasing. Thus, at the moment it is not clear whether customer loyalty de-
pends more on a retailer’s brand or its store location. This topic becomes more 
complex as bricks and mortar retailers have stores in local markets with differ-
ent local competitive situations. Against this background of retailers operating 
at different locations and facing different local competitive contexts, it is of in-
terest to establish how strong retail brand and location issues actually drive 
customers’ store loyalty.  
Retail branding is relevant to retail formats in an international context. In addi-
tion to the aforementioned view of different perceptional levels, the scope can 
be expanded by including perceptions of retailers’ executed format, e.g. dis-
ounters, supermarkets, and hypermarkets as traditional retail formats in gro-

Introduction 
5 
cery retailing (Levy and Weitz 2012). In particular, the chosen format or for-
mats also partly transport retailers’ intended brand meaning. Nevertheless, a 
retailer with high quality products would not combine them with discount pric-
ing and less appealing store layouts. The relevance of customers’ brand per-
ceptions regarding formats increases as retailers become international. Pro-
ceeding from the assumption that retail formats can be viewed in the same 
way as the retailers’ products with which they are doing business in their home 
countries and abroad, there is much discussion in retailing literature concern-
ing standardization and adaptation of international operations (Swoboda, 
Zentes, and Elsner 2009). This context specifically gains importance as retail-
ers started doing business in emerging markets after entering developed mar-
kets. Against this background of retailers going into foreign markets and of re-
tail formats that also transport retailers’ intended brand meaning to customers, 
it is of interest to establish which role format characteristics play in the for-
mation of retail brands. 
Summarizing these issues, retailers are confronted with complex branding 
tasks that they have to manage: different levels of consumer perception, a 
possible trade-off between retail brand and store location in local competitive 
contexts, and perception of retail brands considering retail formats in an inter-
national context. In the light of the growing competition in retailing, it becomes 
incrementally important for retailers to analyze retail brand issues in depth, es-
pecially with the focus of consumer perceptions, and thus answer the following 
key questions: 
(1)  Do perceptions regarding a retailer’s reputation and retail store equities in-
teract with each other in determining store loyalty, and how should retailers 
manage both levels, e.g. invest in their reputation or in stores as brands? 
(2)  Against the background of different local competitive contexts, should re-
tailers manage their retail brand or easily accessible stores to attract con-
sumers?  
(3)  Are specific retail format characteristics actually perceived by consumers in 
a similar manner in developed as well as in emerging countries, and do 
they equally influence the respective retail brands within each format in 
both developed and emerging countries?  

6 
Chapter A 
These and further questions are of relevance for researchers and especially 
for managers because, as mentioned before, retail brands are relevant to con-
sumers’ loyalty and, in turn, to retailers’ performance, however research on 
retail branding is still sparse. Furthermore, several complex and under-
researched topics in conjunction with retail brands raise questions that need to 
be answered.

Research Gaps and Questions 
2.1. 
Overview 
The following sections deal with the detection of gaps, looking at literature, 
theory, and method with respect to research on retail branding and store loyal-
ty. Several research domains relevant to retailing arise especially within the 
literature gap considering retail branding, store loyalty, reciprocity, location and 
local competition, and retail formats in an international context. The last sec-
tion of Chapter 2 deals with the general research questions that describe the 
motivation for this doctoral thesis and act as a guide for the following studies 
conducted. 
2.2. 
Literature Gap and Relevant Research Domains 
Small amount of research considers retail branding 
When reviewing past literature streams that deal with relevant concepts 
around the topic of associations with a retailer (i.a. image, brand, equity, repu-
tation), it becomes apparent that there is less empirical research on retail 
branding (i.a. retail/corporate brand, equity, or reputation), but a lot of research 
on store image (see Table A–2).1 
Also Grewal and Levy (2007) recently detected a lack of retail branding re-
search. They reviewed articles that were published in the Journal of Retailing 
between 2002 and 2007 and classified ten topic categories, such as price, 
brand/product, and service. They found that only seventeen articles focused 
on the topics that are related to brand/product. This must be considered a 
small number as this category includes merchandise, assortment, category

management, products, and branding. As the Journal of Retailing is the high-
est ranked journal in the retailing field, the authors detected a lack of studies 
related to product and especially to branding.

Research lacks studies on drivers of store loyalty 
Past research has frequently analyzed the drivers of consumers’ brand choice 
and brand loyalty. Peterson and Balasubramanian (2002), respectively, de-
tected under-researched perspectives in retailing. They mention that more re-
search has to be conducted in the research field considering the drivers of 
consumers’ retail choice or store loyalty. Also, Puccinelli et al. (2009) indicated 

Introduction 
9 
that store loyalty is an important issue for further research, especially with re-
spect to the cues retailers should emphasize to drive consumers’ store loyalty. 
Thus, there is research needed on the drivers of store loyalty, especially as 
retail brands are antecedents of store loyalty and against the background of 
the complex topics in conjunction with retail brands that still raise questions, as 
already mentioned and identified. 
Retail branding and consumer perception levels 
As already mentioned, the perception of retailers occurs at different levels 
(Burt and Davies 2010). Thus, consumers may perceive retailers as a whole 
organization and at a local level (Ou, Abratt, and Dion 2006). But is there any 
relationship between corporate and store perceptions, for example? Atkin 
(1962) already stated that there may be a transfer of perceptions from a store 
to the retail corporation and back to another store. Also, Stanley and Sewall 
(1976) noted a possible reciprocal relationship between perceptions of an indi-
vidual store and a retail corporation. However, a literature review reveals that, 
although there are some ideas and statements about possible reciprocal rela-
tionships in retailing, most studies considered and analyzed rather unidirec-
tional relationships (see Chapter B.2.). Those unidirectional relationships have 
been analyzed either in a top-down relationship or in bottom-up relationship. 
For example, Helgesen, Ivar Håvold, and Nesset (2010) found an effect of 
chain image on store image (top-down effect), and Grewal et al. (1998) found 
an effect of store brands on store image (bottom-up effect). Still, there is no 
clear evidence of how different perception levels interact, especially concern-
ing their possible positive influence on consumers’ store loyalty. This aspect 
would be of importance for retail managers who have to allocate their invest-
ments efficiently in order to enhance performance. 
Retail branding, location, and local competition 
Against the background of past literature that describes retail brand as the 
most intangible asset in retailing (Keller and Lehmann 2006) and emphasizes 
the importance of location for success (Grewal, Levy, and Kumar 2009), the 
questions remains as to which of these elements is the most important driver 
of store loyalty. As already explained above, this topic is specifically relevant 
as local competitive situations may differ for each retailer store. This means 

10 
Chapter A 
that a retailer’s stores have to face different local competitive situations (num-
ber of competitors or distance to next competitor) that in turn influence con-
sumers’ local responses to a particular store. In general, research on location 
started with Reilly (1931) and, therefore, has a longer tradition than research 
on branding. Location research focuses on topics that deal either with the per-
spective of retailers or of consumers: 
- Studies capturing the companies’ view focus, for example, on the choice of 
an optimal location for a store (Huff 1964; Ghosh and Craig 1983). These 
studies try to estimate the attractiveness of a catchment area using aggre-
gated data assuming general behavior of consumers living in this area.  
- Another stream of research deals with location and accessibility of a store in 
terms of the distance between a store and the consumer’s home or office 
(Finn and Louviere 1990), the time it takes for customers to reach a store 
(1982), or adds the perspective of costs for a consumer to reach the store 
(Bell, Ho, and Tang 1998).  
- Further studies that took the consumers’ perspective into account deal spe-
cifically with subjective consumer evaluations of a store’s location in terms 
of perceived accessibility (Gautschi 1981; Severin, Louviere, and Finn 2001) 
to explain store choice or store patronage.  
In summary, location research aims to measure retail potential, to search for 
the optimum location for retailers, and to explain customers’ store choice (see 
Brown (1993) and Craig, Gosh, and McLafferty (1984) for overviews). Alt-
hough scholars have often studied location issues in the past, they have rarely 
focused on the relative importance of retail brands and store locations for store 
loyalty, for example, in different competitive situations. Additionally, Grewal, 
Levy, and Kumar (2009) recently called for more research on location issues.  
Another related research stream that is relevant to retailers operating at a local 
level is dedicated to local competition. Hartman and Spiro (2005), for example, 
conceptualized store equity as the store perceptions of one retailer in relation 
to the store perceptions of competing retailers. Nevertheless, perceptions of 
competitors were incorporated in one measure with perceptions of a focal re-
tailer rather than examining two different variables. However, using consumer 
evaluations of a focal retailer and of its strongest competitor separately would 
allow for additional conclusions, e.g. on how the strong brand equity and store 

Introduction 
11 
accessibility of both the focal retailer and its competitors determine store loyal-
ty intentions toward the focal retailer. Beside this perceptional view of local 
competition, there are studies that consider objective local competitive charac-
teristics in their research, e.g. to explain customers’ cherry-picking behavior 
(Talukdar, Gauri, and Grewal 2010) or as moderating effect between satisfac-
tion, convenience, and repurchase intentions (Seiders et al. 2005). However, 
studies on the effects of objective local competition (i.e., the number of com-
peting stores in the trading area and the distance from the focal retailer to the 
next competitor) on possible relationships between brand, location, and loyalty 
are scarce. It would be of interest, especially for retailers that have to manage 
their local stores successfully, to establish how retail brands and store acces-
sibility of both a particular retailer and its local competitors influence custom-
ers’ store loyalty to a particular retailer, and how objective local competitive 
situations influence these relationships is of more crucial interest. 
Retail branding and retail formats in an international context 
As already mentioned, retailers started to leave their home and saturated 
markets to do business first in developed and then in emerging markets 
(Dawson 2001; Goldman 2001; Goldman, Ramaswami, and Krider 2002). 
The probability of retailers’ success was said to be given if they used retail 
formats abroad that they had already used in their home markets (Gielens 
and Dekimpe 2001). Additionally, retailers often adapt their offers to local 
markets within a format (Goldman 2001). Thus, retailers adopt marketing in-
struments within the boundaries of core attributes that are characteristic of 
the format that is preferred for expansion. As retail marketing instruments are 
also used to create a brand in consumers’ minds, it is interesting to establish 
whether the core attributes that determine retail brands within a format in de-
veloped countries are perceived identically to the core attributes abroad. Ta-
ble A–3 gives a brief overview of the different research streams that deal with 
retail formats, especially retail formats and consumer behavior, the develop-
ment of retail formats, new retailers in a market and the upcoming reaction, 
inter- and intra-format competitions, the success of retail formats, and other 
format-related topics. There has been a lot of research on consumers’ format 
choice, and especially on intra- and inter-format competition. The majority of 
studies that deal with the entry of a new format or retailer abroad focus on 

12 
Chapter A 
the reactions of other retailers in that market or on whether consumers’ be-
havior changes. Studies that deal with the perceptions of formats abroad and 
the effect of those format-specific core attributes on retail brand within a for-
mat are scarce. Only Merrilees, McKenzie, and Miller (2007) examined 
whether the brand formation process applies in both Canada and Estonia, 
focusing on price, store organization, and personal service as brand drivers 
and concentrating on only one type of store format, i.e. low-price stores. They 
found that the personal service provided by the retailer was the most im-
portant attribute influencing the brand in both countries, however price was 
only significant for brand formation in Canada and store organization was on-
ly a significant driver for brand formation in Estonia. The findings are surpris-
ing, as price is seen as a core attribute for low-price stores. However, further 
comparative research is needed, especially with respect to a broader range 
of attributes involved and different retail formats.

Chapter A 
Bringing together the literature on retail branding in conjunction with reciproci-
ty, store accessibility and format perceptions abroad, five major research gaps 
are identified and briefly summarized in the following: 
- There is a lack of research on retail branding (Grewal and Levy 2007) and 
on the drivers of store loyalty (Peterson and Balasubramanian 2002; 
Puccinelli et al. 2009). 
- There is a lack of bidirectional studies, especially considering the relation-
ship between different perception levels of consumers. 
- Research lacks recent location studies (Grewal, Levy, and Kumar 2009). 
- Studies on the effects of objective local competition on possible relation-
ships between brand, location, and loyalty are scarce. 
- There are few studies that deal with the perceptions of formats abroad and 
the effect of format-specific core attributes on retail brand within a format. 
2.3. 
Theoretical Gap 
With respect to theory, there appears to be little schema theoretical and asso-
ciative network theory in conjunction with store loyalty and retail branding. 
As already mentioned, store loyalty is a very relevant topic in retailing, espe-
cially as it is a proxy for retailers’ performance. However, researchers not only 
detected that more retailing research is generally needed on store loyalty (see 
section above). Brown and Dant (2009) categorized the theories and content 
areas from articles published in the Journal of Retailing between 2004 and 
2009 and examined the frequency of theories used for different content areas. 
They found that store loyalty has been explained mostly by general marketing 
theories (37.1%), followed by microeconomic theory, social exchange theory, 
satisfaction theory, and other psychological theories for individuals (all 11.4%) 
(e.g., attitude, emotion, perceived risk, learning, or memory theory). According-
ly, Puccinelli et al. (2009) recently stated that there is need for further research 
in retailing, considering theories in conjunction with mechanisms that took 
place in consumers’ memories and store loyalty. 
Considering the content area of brand/product, the authors found that it has 
been frequently explained using other psychological theories for individuals 
(31.9%), followed by microeconomic theory (19.1%), marketing theory (17%), 
and consumer choice theory (14.9%) (Brown and Dant 2009). Overall, Brown 

Introduction 
15 
and Dant detected that a total of 377 theoretical incidents arose within the 173 
articles reviewed, meaning that 2.18 theories were used per article. Neverthe-
less, the authors clearly stated that the theoretical category of other psychologi-
cal theories for individuals comprises 69 theories that have been used for the 
conceptual framework or hypothesis development or have been mentioned only. 
However, only nine out of the 50 studies that used other psychological theories 
for individuals dealt with branding or image, whereas only two studies used 
memory or schema theoretical theories (Pan and Zinkhan 2006; Ailawadi and 
Keller 2004), four only mentioned them (Barone, Norman, and Miyazaki 2007; 
Brady et al. 2005; Lei, de Ruyter, and Wetzels 2008; Puccinelli et al. 2009), and 
three did not apply any memory or equivalent theory (Kumar and Shah 2004; 
Jones and Reynolds 2006; Yim, Chan, and Hung 2007).  
Summing up, using memory theory or related theories also seems to be a fruit-
ful approach for studying retail branding in addition to store loyalty. Thus, this 
doctoral thesis aims to contribute to theory in applying schema theoretical rea-
soning and associative network theory to the mechanisms that arise in con-
sumers’ minds in conjunction with retail brands and store loyalty.  
2.4. 
Methodological Gap 
Retail brand research lacks an approach to methodology. A review of articles 
that were published in the Journal of Retailing between 2002 and 2007 (Brown 
and Dant 2008) reveals a gap concerning the research design or data base 
used. Although consumer survey data are one of the most popular approaches 
to methodology used in retailing (see Brown and Dant 2008, p. 4), brand and 
product-specific research articles frequently used student survey or secondary 
data (see Table A–4). Thus, research on brands and products using consumer 
data is relatively scarce.  
Retail brand research lacks the use of inferential tools. A second and more 
crucial gap occurs concerning the use of inferential tools or methods used for 
branding research. The articles examined in the Journal of Retailing between 
2002 and 2007 on brand and product frequently used analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), followed by the 
category ‘other techniques’ (comprising 20 techniques) and analytical model-

16 
Chapter A 
ing (see Table A–5). However, retail brand research lacks the causal ap-
proaches of regression analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM).

In summary, breaking up these patterns of research may further existing 
knowledge, broaden our view of retailing phenomena, and raise new problems 
to analyze (Brown and Dant 2008). Thus, this doctoral thesis aims to contrib-
ute to methods due to the methodological gaps detected in reviewing consum-
er survey data and analyzing them with several causal approaches of structur-
al equation modeling. 

Introduction

2.5. 
General Research Objectives 
Having highlighted the relevance of retail brands and store loyalty for retailers 
that have to cope with various complex topics regarding the managing of their 
retail brand, introduced the respective research gaps, and briefly looked at the 
related research domains which remain unanswered in the context of retail 
branding, three general objectives of the present thesis emerge. 
The general research objectives of this thesis aim to gain a deeper knowledge 
of retail brands as drivers of loyalty in several complex retail contexts that 
emerge, to give retailers some advice, and to equip them with tools to better 
understand and effectively manage their brands in the respective situations. 
Thus, the three general research objectives encompass the investigation of 
how retailers should decide on their investments in building the chain’s reputa-
tion or store’s equity, of how retailers should allocate their investments in ex-
pensive, but easily accessible store locations or in building the retail brand 
considering different local competitive situations, and of how retailers should 
shape and manage their retail brand within a specific format when going inter-
national. All these topics deal with the evaluations of consumer perceptions 
that finally result in the development of consumers’ store loyalty.  
To illuminate these complex issues, three studies have been designed to an-
swer three general research objectives: 
- The first objective is to explore the role of the locally perceived retail brand 
in relation to retailers’ corporate or chain reputation, considering their mutual 
influence on customers’ loyalty. 
- The second objective is to explore the retail brand effects in the light of local 
competition and in conjunction with stores’ locally perceived accessibility, 
which is a highly relevant mantra in retailing.  
- The third objective is to explore the perception and drivers of retail brands in 
the light of different retail formats, considering retailers from developed mar-
kets doing business with the same retail formats in emerging countries. 
These three general research objectives are considered and evaluated in 
Chapter E on the basis of three studies. Therefore, each general research ob-
jective is examined separately in depth in one study by answering concrete 
research questions. In the following, a short overview of the motivation, re-

18 
Chapter A 
search questions, conceptual framework, empirical analysis, and contribution 
is provided for each study. 
 
3. 
Structure of and Contributions by the Studies 
3.1. 
Reciprocal Effects in Retailing 
As mentioned, the general objective of Study 1 is to explore the relationship 
between different consumer perception levels, i.e. to explore the relation of the 
locally perceived retail brand in relation to retailers’ corporate or chain reputa-
tion, considering their mutual influence on customers’ loyalty. In detail, Study 1 
analyzes the relationship between retail store equity, which is dedicated to 
consumers’ local perception of the brand, and corporate reputation, which is 
dedicated to consumers’ chain or corporate perception. Additionally, Study 1 
examines the effect of both perception levels on consumers’ store loyalty. Fur-
thermore, the study examines whether retail store equity or corporate reputa-
tion offer a greater contribution to store loyalty. From a theoretical perspective, 
the study refers to schema theoretical reasoning and the associative network 
theory to explain bidirectional relationships of specific store and corporate 
knowledge that is stored in consumers’ memories. The theories also offer an 
explanation for the strength of specific information in consumers’ minds in con-
junction with retrieval of information. From a managerial perspective, this re-
search enhances our understanding of the role of consumers’ local and corpo-
rate brand perceptions in store loyalty, which in turn is a strong driver of retail 
performance. Thus, retail managers may gain insights for use in the allocation 
of investments.  
The motivation for this specific view is threefold. First, branding has become 
more complex in retailing against the background of different perception levels 
(Burt and Davies 2010). Second, retailers knew hitherto that top-down and bot-
tom-up effects emerge in retailing, e.g. between store image and store brands, 
or between store image and mall image. It is still not known, however, whether 
reciprocal effects actually exist, although there were early ideas of a possible 
effect from the store to the chain and vice versa (Stanley and Sewall 1976). 
Third, the question of how strongly different perception levels determine store 

Introduction 
19 
loyalty is still unclear. The latter issue is particularly relevant for retailers to ef-
ficiently manage brand perceptions in order to enhance performance. 
In detail, the following research questions are examined: 
- Is there actually a reciprocal relationship between corporate reputation and 
retail store equity?  
- Does corporate reputation or retail store equity have a stronger effect on 
store loyalty? 
The conceptual framework of Study 1 is twofold. First, the study examines the 
key underlying mechanism of reciprocal connections in consumers’ minds. The 
mechanism is defined by schema activation of one node to another. The ra-
tionale is that retail store equity represents a store node and corporate reputa-
tion represents a corporate node. These two nodes are linked to each other 
directly and indirectly through shared associations. With respect to the direc-
tionality of the link between the two nodes, it is possible to refer to the retrieval 
of information that occurs through spreading activation (e.g., Anderson 1983). 
According to associative network theory, the activation and links between two 
concepts can point in two directions. Second, consumers refer to schemata 
when they have to make choices about where to purchase (Marshall 1995). 
Thus, schemata influence consumers’ shopping decisions. To explain which of 
the nodes predicts loyalty more strongly, it is possible to rely on the strength of 
the linkages of both concepts, which can be explained by the degree of activa-
tion. As the strength of activation and the number of connections between a 
node and its associations increases with practice, it is assumed that the node 
that is related to the store makes a greater contribution to influencing store 
loyalty. 
The analysis is based on three consecutive studies. First, a large consumer 
sample was surveyed at 30 locations of one German do-it-yourself (DIY) re-
tailer (N = 5,600). This study applies a non-recursive structural equation model 
to analyze the cross-sectional data, which allows modeling and analysis of 
feedback relations. Second, two longitudinal designs, one in the fashion (N = 
203) and one in the grocery sector (N = 209), were implemented using three 
waves in one medium-sized German city over a period of eight months. Two 
cross-lagged designs for structural equation modeling were performed to ana-

20 
Chapter A 
lyze the longitudinal data. This approach addresses the shortcomings of a 
cross-sectional analysis for reciprocal relationships (i.e., equilibrium and 
stationarity). Third, an experimental study was conducted using a 2 x 3 design 
(a real or fictional retailer with a corporate, store, or control message). In the 
first setting, respondents first had to read either a corporate, store, or control 
message about the fictional DIY retailer (N = 165) and then respond to a ques-
tionnaire. In the second setting, the respondents had to read either a corpo-
rate, store, or control message about a real DIY retailer (N = 167) and then 
respond to the questionnaire. The data were analyzed using regression analy-
sis. With this approach, it is possible to finally establish whether reciprocity ex-
ists in both fictional and real retail settings. 
The results of Study 1 contribute in several aspects to the current knowledge. 
First, although the marketing rule of reciprocity may result from practical expe-
rience, it is beneficial to provide scientific evidence as to whether there are in-
terrelations between concepts that belong to different perception levels. Thus 
this study goes beyond the scope of other scholars that examine unidirectional 
relationships. Second, this study contributes to theory because the conceptual-
ization of reciprocal relationships for associative concepts can be explained 
using schema theory. Third, the results considering the strength of retail store 
equity and corporate reputation for store loyalty enhance the knowledge of re-
tailers’ possibilities in allocating their investments more efficiently. 
3.2. 
Competition Effects in Local Markets 
The general objective of Study 2 is to explore the retail brand effects in the 
light of local competition and in conjunction with stores’ locally perceived ac-
cessibility. In detail, this study examines whether retail brand equity or store 
accessibility of one focal retailer determines customers’ store loyalty more 
strongly towards the focal retailer. Furthermore, the study explores the re-
spective effects concerning competitors, i.e. the effects of competitors’ retail 
brand equity and competitors’ store accessibility on consumers’ store loyalty 
towards the focal retailer. Additionally, the study aims to analyze how the ef-
fects concerning consumers’ perceptions toward the focal retailer (i.e., be-
tween retail brand equity, store accessibility, and store loyalty) are influenced 
through objective local competition. In detail, the study examines the influence 
of local competitive intensity and distance to the next competitor on the ef-

Introduction 
21 
fects that exist for the focal retailer. From a theoretical perspective, schema 
theoretical reasoning and associative network theory explain the effects, and 
especially the strength of effects, that determine store loyalty, i.e. whether re-
tail brand equity or store accessibility has a greater impact on store loyalty. 
Furthermore, the study draws on the theory of allocation of time (Becker 
1965) and the law of retail gravitation (Reilly 1931) to explain the objective 
competitive effects on the relationships concerning one focal retailer. From a 
managerial perspective, the study aims to add further knowledge on consum-
ers’ local brand and location perceptions affecting store loyalty in different 
competitive situations. Thus, retailers may gain insights concerning future site 
selection and the allocation of investments through building the retail brand 
and location choice.  
The motivation for this specific view is threefold. First, although retail branding 
has gained considerable importance in retailing, the opinions considering the 
relevance of location are contrasting. Whereas Bell, Ho and Tang (1998) 
found that location is no longer the most important attribute in influencing 
store choice, others point out that location is still of incredible importance for 
retailers (Grewal, Levy, and Kumar 2009; Interbrand 2012). Therefore, it re-
mains to be answered which of both constructs has a stronger influence on 
customer store loyalty because store loyalty is an important driver of retailers’ 
success. Second, against the background that a retailer, namely a focal re-
tailer, operates locally, different retail brands are present at each location and 
compete with the retailer’s brand. Thus, in contrast to using relative percep-
tions of retailers (Hartman and Spiro 2005), it would be fruitful to know how 
subjective perceptions of competitors separately influence customers’ local 
store loyalty towards the focal retailer. Third, as not only physical facilities, 
offers, and prices may differ between each store a retailer operates (Ou, 
Abratt, and Dion 2006), the objective local competitive situations, e.g. the 
competitive intensity, also vary between the different locations of a retailer 
(Seiders et al. 2005). Thus, it should be established how the effects determin-
ing consumers’ store loyalty towards the focal retailer vary for different, objec-
tive competitive situations. Retailers’ may need this knowledge to effectively 
allocate their investments through location search and decision and brand 
building actions. 

22 
Chapter A 
In detail, the following research questions are examined: 
 Does retail brand equity or a convenient, accessible store location provide 
a greater contribution to the store loyalty of a focal retailer?  
 To what extent do the retail brand equity and store accessibility of local 
competitors affect store loyalty towards a focal retailer?  
 How do different objective competitive situations affect the brand and loca-
tion effects on a focal retailer? 
The conceptual framework of Study 2 is twofold. First, the key underlying 
mechanism is examined through which retail brand equity and store accessibil-
ity determine store loyalty. The rationale is that general information regarding 
retail brands is stored at the corporate (retail brand) level. Thus, retail brand 
equity refers to superior-level associations (corporate node) rather than store-
level information (store node), such as store accessibility. As consumers refer 
to information stored in their minds when making decisions (Marshall 1995), 
consumers also retrieve corporate and store information concerning different 
local retailers in order to decide where to purchase. Thus, perceptions towards 
the focal retailer’s and competitors’ retail brand and accessibility influence 
store loyalty towards the focal retailer. Second, the study draws on two further 
theories to describe the moderating effects of competitive intensity and dis-
tance to the next competitor on the focal retailer’s effects concerning retail 
brand equity and store accessibility. Therefore, we follow Dellaert et al. (2008), 
who asserted that varying contexts influence mental representations or infor-
mation retrieval and thus also influence the determining effects on store loyal-
ty. In detail, the theory of allocation of time is used to explain the influence of 
local competitive situations on the effect of store accessibility. The law of retail 
gravitation is used to explain the influence of local competitive situations on 
the effects of retail brand equity. 
To illuminate this issue, this analysis draws on a cross-sectional data sample 
from 30 German cities involving 4,151 customer interviews on the perceptions 
considering one focal retailer and its’ local competitors. Additionally, the data 
on the objective local competitive characteristics (number of competitors and 
the relevant distances to the next competitor) were provided by the store 
managers. Two multiple-group structural equation models were applied to an-

alyze the cross-sectional data. With this approach, it is possible to test wheth-
er the effects on consumers change due to different competitive situations. 
The results of this study contribute in several ways to the current knowledge. 
First, these findings contribute to alleviating the recent lack of research on lo-
cation topics that was mentioned by Grewal, Levy, and Kumar (2009). Second, 
the findings enhance the existing knowledge on the relevance of retail brand 
equity and store accessibility for retailers in that empirical evidence consider-
ing the trade-off decision between both constructs for loyalty can be given. 
Third, in analyzing the moderating effect of objective local competitive situa-
tions, this study goes beyond the research that considers direct effects of, e.g., 
the number of competing stores, on consumer behavior (Talukdar, Gauri, and 
Grewal 2010). 
3.3. 
Format Perceptions in Developed Markets and Emerging Countries 
The general objective of Study 3 is to explore the perception and drivers of re-
tail brands in the light of different retail formats, i.e. competing categories that 
are designed to match the needs of consumers (González-Benito, Muñoz-
Gallego, and Kopalle 2005), considering retailers from developed markets do-
ing business with the same retail formats in emerging countries. In detail, the 
study analyzes whether the core attributes of a specific format (format-specific 
attributes) are perceived equally in a developed and therefore saturated mar-
ket and in an emerging market. Furthermore, the study analyzes whether the-
se core attributes are driving the brand equally within a specific format in both 
markets. The study draws on the idea of the stimulus-organism-response  
(S-O-R) framework (Russell and Mehrabian 1976; Thang and Tan 2003) in 
that consumer perceptions of specific retail attributes (stimulus) influence retail 
brand equity (organism), which in turn influences customers’ store loyalty (re-
sponse). From a managerial perspective, this research is of interest to manag-
ers because they frequently use their retail format(s) for foreign expansion and 
need to know whether customers abroad perceive the format in a similar man-
ner. They need to know especially whether the format-characteristic attributes 
are driving the brand equally, whereas the latter is known to determine con-
sumers’ loyalty and retailers’ market success. Thus, retailers gain knowledge 
to efficiently manage their format and retail brand abroad and thus enhance 
performance. 

24 
Chapter A 
The motivation for this specific view is threefold: First, despite the large number 
of retail attributes, only a few of them are involved in format research, e.g. 
choice and price (Tordjman 1994; Burt and Sparks 1995), price and store size 
(González-Benito 2005), or price, choice, and service (Solgaard and Hansen 
2003). Thus, considering a broader range of retail attributes seems to be a fruit-
ful research stream to enhance format knowledge. Second, although retailers 
increasingly enter foreign and especially emerging markets (Swoboda, Elsner, 
and Morschett 2012) with their preferred store formats (Gielens and Dekimpe 
2001), there is still a need to analyze consumers’ perceptions of formats 
abroad as most research on formats does not focus on the perceptions of for-
mats internationally. Third, research on the role of core attributes in the brand-
building process appears to be a fruitful research stream due to the relevance 
thereof for retailers doing business abroad and the lack of studies on this topic. 
In detail, the following research questions are examined: 
- Are the core attributes of a particular retail store format perceived similarly 
by customers in developed and emerging countries? 
- Do the core attributes determine the retail brand equity equally within a spe-
cific format in both developed and emerging countries? 
The conceptual framework of Study 3 is twofold. First, the format-specific core 
attributes are explained and assumed to be equal over saturated and develop-
ing markets. The rationale is that retailers using their preferred formats abroad 
(Gielens and Dekimpe 2001) need especially to adapt their offers in grocery 
retailing. However, this adaptation is assumed to take place within the bounda-
ries of core format attributes. Thus, although offers are adapted, retailers 
adapt in relation to their competitors abroad in order to retain their relative for-
mat position towards competitors. Second, it is assumed that the core attrib-
utes drive the retail brand formation process equally in saturated and develop-
ing countries. Third, it is hypothesized that retail brand equity positively influ-
ences store loyalty. Thus, in the style of a stimulus-organism-response frame-
work, retail attributes are frequently conceptualized as antecedents for retail 
brand equity (Yoo, Donthu, and Lee 2000; Ailawadi and Keller 2004; Jinfeng 
and Zhilong 2009), as is retail brand equity for store loyalty (Pan and Zinkhan 
2006; Finn and Louviere 1996). 

Introduction 
25 
The analysis of Study 3 is based on two consumer data samples concerning 
traditional grocery formats (discounters, supermarkets, and hypermarkets). 
The context of grocery retailing is chosen as it is the most important retail sec-
tor (Zentes, Swoboda, and Foscht 2012). Cross-sectional designs have been 
applied in one medium-sized city in Germany (N = 919) and in one medium-
sized city in Romania (N = 1,540). Each respondent had to evaluate one gro-
cery retailer that is categorized either as discounter, supermarket or hyper-
market. The data were analyzed using multiple-group structural equation mod-
eling. This approach allows testing for differences between brand formation 
processes in Germany and Romania within each format. 
The results of this study contribute in several ways to the current knowledge. 
First, the findings extend the field of retailing research, especially the research 
considering consumer behavior and comparing different countries. In having a 
greater understanding of how a specific format is perceived abroad and how 
the brand formation process is shaped within each format, the results of the 
study further our understanding of consumer behavior in turn. Second, man-
agers gain a tool to explore and understand the perceptions of their customers 
abroad, i.e. for comparing home and emerging countries. Thus, the findings of 
the study and the tool used will help managers to efficiently adjust their mar-
keting efforts in both types of countries.

Further Remarks 
The three studies on retail branding in different retail contexts investigate the 
aforementioned concrete research questions. In the following, each study is 
organized as follows: 
- introduction,  
- conceptual framework, 
- hypothesis development, 
- empirical study,  
- discussion, and finally 
- limitations and further research.

Chapter A 
This structure is given, regardless of the theory applied. Study 1 uses schema 
theoretical reasoning and associative network theory, as does Study 2. How-
ever, to explain the effects of the local competitive situations, Study 2 also us-
es the theory of allocation of time and the law of retail gravitation. Study 3 is 
designed similarly to the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework. 
The structure is also independent of the methods applied, although each re-
search objective requires an individual methodological approach. However, 
each study was also conducted using specific research designs and in differ-
ent retail sectors. Study 1 uses non-recursive structural equation modeling to 
analyze consumer data on stores of a do-it-yourself (DIY) retailer using a 
cross-sectional design, a cross-lagged design for structural equation modeling 
in a longitudinal design with consumer data on fashion and grocery retailers, 
and regression analysis to analyze consumer data on a fictional and a real DIY 
retailer that have been conducted using an experimental design. Study 2 uses 
multiple group structural equation modeling to analyze cross-sectional con-
sumer data on a DIY retailer at 30 locations in conjunction with secondary data 
considering the objective local competition, i.e. number and distance of com-
petitors. Study 3 also uses multiple group structural equation modeling and 
additionally mean value difference tests to analyze consumer data on grocery 
retailers in two countries, where the data was collected in a cross-sectional 
design. 
After exploring the concrete research questions in the three studies, a sum-
mary of the implications is given in response to the general research questions 
in Chapter E and the thesis is finally rounded off with an outline of further re-
search issues considering the three studies. 
 

 
B. 
Study 1: Reciprocal Effects of the Corporate Reputation 
and Store Equity of Retailers 
 
1. 
Introduction 
Retailers are increasingly focused on their corporate reputations and the posi-
tion of their stores as strong brands in local markets. For example, Starbucks 
invests in both its corporate reputation and its retail brand (Pellet 2006) to 
strengthen intangible assets and performance (Jinfeng and Zhilong 2009; 
Brown et al. 2006) as well as to attract consumers (e.g., Nguyen and Leblanc 
2001). Although these investments by retailers such as Starbucks aim to 
strengthen corporate and store perceptions among consumers, Stanley and 
Sewall (1976) noted in the 1970s that the perceptions of a corporation may be 
a function of the perceptions of an individual store and vice versa. Thus, these 
authors address important bidirectional relationships in consumer memory. To 
analyze such relationships, the present study focuses on the reciprocal effects 
of corporate reputation and retail store equity from the consumer’s perspec-
tive. Corporate reputation is defined as the overall evaluation of a retail corpo-
ration by consumers (e.g., responsibility), which is primarily determined by the 
firm’s corporate communications (Van Riel and Fombrun 2007; Walsh and 
Beatty 2007). Retail store equity is defined as consumer perceptions of a re-
tailer’s store as a strong brand in the local market, which is determined by lo-
cal store attributes (Hartman and Spiro 2005; Yoo, Donthu, and Lee 2000; 
Jinfeng and Zhilong 2009); however, consumer perceptions vary for each store 
in a retail chain (Bloemer and De Ruyter 1998; Ou, Abratt, and Dion 2006; 
Jinfeng and Zhilong 2009). The reciprocity between the more general corpo-
rate-related associations and more specific store-related associations is an 
overlooked research topic in retailing. However, this topic is particularly im-
portant for retailers because they have to take reciprocal effects into account 
when allocating resources, for example, promotional investments across cor-
porate and store levels. Furthermore, reciprocity is not easy to manage, as dif-
ferent organizational units may be responsible for reputation and equity (e.g., 
CEO/corporate communication and marketing/sales).

Chapter B 
The retailing literature rarely addresses reciprocal relations. The interdepend-
encies between consumer associations of different perceptional levels are un-
disputed, but only a few studies analyze them bidirectionally. Early conceptual 
references to possible reciprocal relationships are provided by Atkin (1962) 
and Stanley and Sewall (1976). The study by Helgesen, Ivar Håvold, and 
Nesset (2010) addresses two perceptional levels and shows that chain image 
positively influences store image through a top-down relationship. Further 
studies address the bottom-up effects of store brands (private labels) on store 
image (Grewal et al. 1998) and the top-down effect of shopping mall image on 
store images (Chebat, Sirgy, and St-James 2006). However, nearly all existing 
studies adopt a unidirectional empirical approach, although some assume the 
existence of a reciprocal relationship between associative constructs. One ex-
ception is the study by Kwon and Lennon (2009), who analyzed the interde-
pendencies between beliefs and attitudes of offline and online brands for mul-
tichannel retailers. However, these authors addressed a specific context and 
considered a crosswise rather than reciprocal relationship. Nguyen and Le-
blanc (2001) also aimed to test for a relationship between reputation and im-
age but only applied an interaction term. Thus, apart from the undisputed im-
portance of retailer efforts to support associations between a corporation and 
its stores, the directionality of the effects remains unclear, for example, that 
between, corporate reputation and store equity. Building on the theoretical 
reasoning of schemata and associative networks, we believe that a reciprocal 
relationship exists and, more importantly, that the influence of each construct 
on consumer store loyalty differs in strength when comparing direct and total 
(i.e., the sum of direct and indirect/reciprocal) effects.  
Therefore, the objective of this study is to conceptualize and test the reciprocal 
relationships between customer perceptions of corporate reputation and retail 
store equity with regard to their mutual influence on store loyalty. Specifically, 
we aim to analyze the following research questions: Is there actually a recipro-
cal relationship between corporate reputation and retail store equity? Does cor-
porate reputation or retail store equity have a stronger effect on store loyalty? 
By responding to these questions, this study contributes to retailing research, 
particularly with respect to the reciprocal relationships between the percep-
tions of consumers regarding the corporation and the store. From a theoretical 

Study 1: Reciprocal Effects of the Corporate Reputation and Store Equity of Retailers 
29 
perspective, we build on the suggestion of Stanley and Sewall (1976), who 
stated that consumer perceptions of a corporation may influence their percep-
tions of a store and vice versa. Thus, we enhance the existing knowledge con-
cerning unidirectional effects in retailing. Additionally, we address store loyalty 
as an important issue that is still worthy of further research (Peterson and 
Balasubramanian 2002; Puccinelli et al. 2009) but also as a well-researched 
outcome variable, which makes it easier to evaluate our reciprocal observa-
tions. From a methodological perspective, we provide insights into possible 
methods of successfully analyzing bidirectional relationships using studies with 
cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental designs. Finally, this study is of 
interest to managers; because they seek to strengthen corporate and store 
effects on consumer behavior, they can learn what the interrelations between 
these factors look like (i.e., which level more strongly determines consumer 
behavior) beyond their practical experience and thus gain insights on how to 
allocate promotional investments. 
The remainder of the article is structured as follows. Based on a literature re-
view and schema theory, we derive hypotheses that form the basis for three 
subsequent empirical studies with cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experi-
mental designs. The aims, designs and results of these studies will be dis-
cussed and followed by conclusions, limitations and directions for further re-
search.

Literature Review 
Prior research on bidirectional relationships in retailing is sparse and is distinc-
tive from research on unidirectional relationships (see Table B–1). However, 
the literature has been reviewed, by focusing on two perspectives: studies that 
combine two perceptional levels, such as the corporate, store or store brand 
(private label) levels, and studies that consider one perceptional level (e.g., the 
corporate level only). Both types of research consider either bidirectional or 
unidirectional relationships but typically do not empirically study the assumed 
bidirectional relationships.

A positive effect of chain image on store image can be confirmed empiri-
cally. Chain image influences both store image and store satisfaction posi-
tively. Although a direct link between chain image and store loyalty could 
not be detected, an indirect link was identified. Chain image is indirectly 
linked via store satisfaction, via store image and via the relationship be-
tween store image and store satisfaction to store loyalty.

It is stated that the image of a shopping center is influenced by the image 
of the combination of stores within such a center. Thus, obtaining an at-

It is shown that the image and the choice of a shopping area are depend-

rather because of the existence of a particular store within the center.

Bidirectional relationships are assumed on the store as a brand, including 
store image. A retailer brand image can be created in different ways, in-
cluding the attachment of unique associations to service quality, product 
assortment, pricing and/or credit policy. Furthermore, the image of a re-
tailer brand also depends on the manufacturer brands they offer.

When a change of residence occurs, former experience with a certain

The results suggest that the brand and the image of a store are linked to 
each other. In addition, it is concluded that an averaging process is initiat-
ed when brand and retailer images affect each other, so the party with the 
more favorable image will be negatively affected, while the image of the 
party with the less favorable image is improved.

The positive interrelationship of corporate reputation and corporate image 
was confirmed by the positive interaction effect of both constructs on store 
patronage. Adding the interaction between the constructs leads to a better

either corporate image or corporate reputation intervenes as a moderator 
variable and thus enhances the effect of the other variable on the custom-
er’s loyalty.

2.1. 
Studies Considering Concepts at Different Perceptional Levels  
Early references to bidirectional relationships at different perceptional levels 
were introduced by Atkin (1962) and Stanley and Sewall (1976). Atkin (1962) 
analyzed whether a change in supermarket choice can be determined by ad-
vertising or personal communication. In a survey of consumers who had re-
cently moved to a new apartment building, he assumed that former experience 
with a store is related to the company as a whole and then transferred to a 
store at the new place of residence. This linking of associations, from store to 
corporation and from corporation back to store, provides conceptual evidence 
that corporate and store-level associations are bidirectional. Stanley and Se-
wall (1976) focused on the improvement of retail trade forecasts by including 
chain image in the Huff model (Huff 1964). The authors also make conceptual 
references to a possible bidirectional relationship in positing that chain image 
perceptions are related to store perceptions and vice versa. 
More recent studies that assumed bidirectional relationships focused on the 
store as a brand, including store image (Grewal, Levy, and Lehmann 2004) 
and store brands (Ailawadi and Keller 2004). Although Jacoby and Mazursky 
(1984) had previously posited that product brand and store image are linked to 
one another, Martenson (2007, p. 547) suggested the existence of a reciprocal 
relationship between store brand and store image, although she did not test 
this assumption empirically. However, she provided empirical evidence that 
store image has the strongest influence on corporate image, followed by (in 
ranked order) store brands and manufacturer brands. 
Subsequent studies addressed unidirectional relationships between different 
perceptional levels. Helgesen, Ivar Håvold and Nesset (2010) found a positive 
effect of chain image on store image. Grewal et al. (1998) presented empirical 
evidence that a strong store brand has a positive influence on store image. 
However, Bao, Bao and Sheng (2011) described an effect of the opposite 
type: store image had a positive effect on store brands. Further studies ad-
dressed shopping area and shopping mall image. Nevin and Houston (1980) 
suggested that the image and the choice of a shopping area are dependent on 
the presence of a special store in a particular area. Kirkup and Rafiq (1994) 
stated that the image of a shopping center is influenced by the image of the 

34 
Chapter B 
combination of stores within such a center. In contrast, Chebat, Sirgy and St-
James (2006) found that the image of a mall determines store image. 
2.2. 
Studies Considering Concepts at One Perceptional Level 
References to bidirectional relationships at the same perceptional level were 
made by Nguyen and Leblanc (2001) and Kwon and Lennon (2009). Nguyen 
and Leblanc (2001) examined whether corporate reputation and corporate im-
age had a positive effect on store patronage. The positive interrelationship of 
corporate reputation and corporate image was confirmed by the positive inter-
action effect of both constructs on store patronage. Kwon and Lennon (2009) 
conducted two experiments that found positive crosswise effects: offline brand 
beliefs affect online brand attitudes, whereas online brand beliefs influence 
offline brand attitudes.  
Other studies that have considered these effects on one perceptional level fo-
cused on unidirectional relationships, such as the image transference of a 
well-known retailer’s store to an unknown retailer’s store in a shopping area 
(Burns 1992) or the effects of store image on store equity (Jinfeng and Zhilong 
2009). Furthermore, a large body of research can be categorized as being fo-
cused on one perceptional level and unidirectional. For example, all studies 
that have analyzed the effects of different retail marketing attributes on con-
sumer behavior, (e.g., service and store layout perceptions on story loyalty) 
and all studies that have examined on the effect between retail marketing at-
tributes (e.g., price perception on quality perceptions) consider these effects at 
a single level.  
In summary, we draw three conclusions from the literature review. First, the 
number of studies that address concepts at a single perceptional level is 
greater than the number of studies that focus on the effects of concepts at 
multiple perceptional levels. In addition, few studies examine both the corpo-
rate and store levels. Second, only one study examines relationships at differ-
ent perceptional levels for chain store retailers (Helgesen, Ivar Håvold, and 
Nesset 2010). However, it is particularly relevant for chain store retailers to 
determine how concepts at the corporate and store levels interact because 
corporate reputations are managed through corporate communication units at 
headquarters, whereas retail store equity is primarily managed by store man-

Study 1: Reciprocal Effects of the Corporate Reputation and Store Equity of Retailers 
35 
agers. Third, the relevance and the probable existence of bidirectional rela-
tionships have been tested empirically in only two studies: Nguyen and Le-
blanc (2001) tested for a relationship at a single perceptional level but only ap-
plied an interaction term showing that corporate reputation and image are 
positively related to one another in affecting store patronage; Kwon and Len-
non (2009) considered a crosswise rather than reciprocal relationship, as four 
constructs were involved in their study, and thus, they did not test for a direct 
bidirectional relationship between two constructs. Thus we find that both ap-
proaches are not applicable to solve our research question concerning reci-
procity.  
 
3. 
Conceptual Framework and Hypothesis Development 
Scholars have previously examined unidirectional relationships from different 
theoretical perspectives, including the halo effect (Burns 1992), self-congruity 
theory (Chebat, Sirgy, and St-James 2006), signaling theory (Martenson 
2007), and the summative model of attitude, which was used in the only study 
that aimed to test a bidirectional relationship (Kwon and Lennon 2009, p. 
377f.). Addressing our research questions requires the application of a theory 
that is able to explain reciprocal relationships between associative constructs 
and link these relationships to consumer behavior. Following research that ex-
plains the effects of customer-based associative concepts through schemata 
and memory networks (e.g., Krishnan 1996; Hartman and Spiro 2005; Keller 
1993), we use schema theoretical reasoning to explain the reciprocal relation-
ships between corporate and store information stored in consumer memory 
and their effects on store loyalty (see Figure B-1). In the following sections, we 
first hypothesize that corporate reputation and retail store equity are reciprocal 
and then hypothesize concerning the effects of these constructs on store loyal-
ty.

Hypothesis Regarding the Reciprocity between Corporate Reputation 
and Retail Store Equity 
Schemata are organizing mechanisms for cognition (Puligadda, Ross Jr., and 
Grewal 2012; McVee, Dunsmore, and Gavelek 2005). They are based on past 
experience and can refer to situations or objects (Mandler 1979). Although 
schema and memory models differ in their form and underlying assumptions 
(e.g., Anderson 1983; Murdock 1982; Hintzman 1986; Collins and Loftus 
1975), most of them view memory as a network. This network consists of 
nodes or concepts, such as objects and attributes, which represent stored in-
formation (e.g., Nelson et al. 1993) and links between these nodes. For exam-
ple, consumers hold information about a corporation and its stores, as well as 
links between them, as nodes in their minds. Considerable evidence suggests 
that networks can take many forms based on the nature of the cues used to 
access them (e.g., Barsalou 1983). Our examination of reciprocity begins with 
the premise that brand representations are not cognitively independent. In 
general, researchers have conceptualized associations, especially among 
brands, by using both the categorization and associative network theories. 
Categorization theory implies that a consumer’s cognitive representation fol-
lows a hierarchical structure, often assuming a product category node at the 
highest level, followed by subcategories, brands, and, finally, attributes (e.g., 
Hutchinson, Raman, and Mantrala 1994; Nedungadi 1990). Scholars using the 
categorization model mostly focus on analyzing relations between product 
brand and category and product brand and subcategory rather than relation-
ships between brand and brand (e.g., Krishnan 1996; Cowley and Mitchell 
2003; Campbell and Keller 2003; Lei, Dawar, and Lemmink 2008). In our con-

text, corporate reputation may be related to a brand node, whereas retail store 
equity may represent a subcategory, e.g., store node. When consumers are 
confronted with new information, e.g., a new store, they try to integrate it into 
an existing corporate brand node to facilitate the formation of attitudes toward 
the new entity (e.g., Boush and Loken 1991). If categorization is successful, 
consumers transfer their corporate associations to the new entity (the new 
store). Our literature review supports such conceptual reasoning on bidirec-
tional relationships between a retail corporation and a retail store (e.g., Atkin 
1962; Stanley and Sewall 1976). This reasoning might also hold for the con-
tradictory directionalities between store brand and store image (Grewal et al. 
1998; Bao, Bao, and Sheng 2011; Martenson 2007). 
Associative network theory (Collins and Loftus 1975) states that there are 
many types of relations between nodes. In general, knowledge is conceptual-
ized as consisting of a node and a variety of associations that are linked to 
each other, such as attributes, brand claims, and experiences (Keller 1993; 
Morrin 1999; Keller 2003). Scholars using this theory focus, for example, on 
brand portfolio information consisting of a set of interconnected brand nodes 
(e.g., Farquhar and Herr 1993; Lei, Dawar, and Lemmink 2008). In a retail 
context, a brand node, referring to the retailer’s corporate brand, is linked to 
other brand nodes, such as those of chain brands (within diversified retailers) 
or stores as strong brands in local markets (within both diversified and non-
diversified retailers), which may have strong or weak links with each other. In 
our context, the directionality between corporate reputation (chain reputation 
for diversified firms) and stores as strong brands in local markets is of particu-
lar interest. Corporate reputation represents a corporate node and retail store 
equity refers to a store node, and these are linked to each other directly and 
indirectly through shared associations. To understand the directionality of the 
links between both concepts, one can refer to the effects of information re-
trieval, which occurs through spreading activation (Collins and Loftus 1975; 
Anderson 1983; Puligadda, Ross Jr., and Grewal 2012). According to associa-
tive network theory, the activation and links between two concepts can point in 
two directions. Thus, the activation of a corporate node by external information 
spreads to related store nodes through associative network linkages and vice 
versa. For example, the node related to the corporation may be activated if a 

38 
Chapter B 
consumer watches a corporate communication spot on television or reads a 
newspaper article about the corporation. Through spreading activation, other 
related nodes, such as the store-related node, are activated. Thus, a consum-
er may be reminded of the store of the company where he usually shops. 
Conversely, an activation of the store-related node, e.g., through promotion or 
a direct positive shopping experience, results in spreading activation to other 
nodes. For example, talking to a well-trained and courteous sales clerk who 
helps with a product decision may cause the consumer to think about a corpo-
ration that attaches importance to the selection of good employees. Although 
these examples are constructed upon active cognitive thought processes, re-
ciprocal activation across nodes takes place in the minds of consumers. The 
underlying relationship is positive in most of the cases when consumers hold 
positive associations toward the corporation and the store in their minds, 
whereas perceived inconsistencies by consumers are known to activate nega-
tive associations (e.g., Tse et al. 2007; Roehm and Tybout 2006; Lei, Dawar, 
and Lemmink 2008). However, as a first step, we propose to test the existence 
of a positive reciprocal relationship between corporate reputation and retail 
store equity. Thus we hypothesize the following: 
H1. 
Corporate reputation and retail store equity have a positive 
reciprocal relationship. 
3.2. 
Hypothesis Regarding the Effects of Corporate Reputation and Retail 
Store Equity on Story Loyalty 
To understand the effects of corporate reputation and retail store equity on 
store loyalty, it is useful to refer to the early work of Sirgy and Samli (1985), 
who argued that schemata can explain store loyalty, which is defined as the 
intention and readiness to repurchase at a store or to recommend a store 
(Evanschitzky and Wunderlich 2006; Oliver 1999). This understanding de-
scribes conative loyalty as a “deeply held commitment to buy” (Oliver 1999, p. 
35), which forms the penultimate stage in the formation of loyalty (Harris and 
Goode 2004) and is viewed as a core predictor of consumer spending (Macin-
tosh and Lockshin 1997). Schemata are said to help consumers to make 
choices about where to purchase and also influence shopping decisions 
(Crocker 1984; Grewal, Levy, and Kumar 2009; Grewal and Levy 2009). Un-
derstanding corporate reputation and retail store equity as consumer associa-

Study 1: Reciprocal Effects of the Corporate Reputation and Store Equity of Retailers 
39 
tions pertaining to a retailer and its stores will influence consumer loyalty. This 
conclusion is consistent with past research on the positive effects of corporate 
reputation on store patronage (Walsh, Beatty, and Shiu 2009; Nguyen and Le-
blanc 2001) and the positive effects of retail store equity on loyalty (Jinfeng 
and Zhilong 2009). Consequently, associations about a corporation and a 
store determine store loyalty. 
However, whether corporate reputation or retail store equity is responsible for 
a greater contribution to store loyalty is of interest. It is well known that con-
sumers retrieve information stored in memory to make plans, solve problems, 
or make decisions and thus, to decide whether to repurchase at a store. To 
explain which of the concepts more strongly predicts loyalty, it is possible to 
rely on the strength of the linkages of both concepts. The strength of the link-
ages can be explained through the degree of activation. According to some 
scholars (Anderson 1983; Krishnan 1996; Lei, Dawar, and Lemmink 2008), the 
strength of activation and the number of connections between a node and its 
associations increases with practice, e.g., recurring experience with the store. 
Thus, the possibility of the retrieval of a node is reported to be higher the more 
connections it has and the more often it is activated. Following this reasoning, 
and knowing that the strength of the links is related to the degree of repetition, 
practice, and recurring experience (Eckblad 1981; Anderson 1983; Malle and 
Horowitz 1995; Cowley and Mitchell 2003; Campbell and Keller 2003; Lei, 
Dawar, and Lemmink 2008), it seems logical that the concept of the store and 
store-node-related associations are activated and updated more frequently 
and that the concept of the corporation and corporate-node-related associa-
tions are used and activated less frequently. This difference may occur be-
cause the store concept and store associations are activated with each shop-
ping experience or recommendation, whereas the corporate concept is not al-
ways addressed through spreading activation. Another reason is that the cor-
porate concept may be less frequently activated in a direct manner, for exam-
ple, if consumers do not regularly read newspaper articles or watch corporate 
communication spots on television. Because the store node is activated more 
often, it is likely that this node and its associations are retrieved more often by 
consumers. Thus, we propose that retail store equity, in sum, will have a 
stronger influence on store loyalty than corporate reputation:  

40 
Chapter B 
H2. 
The total effect (i.e., the sum of direct and indirect effects) 
on store loyalty will be more positive for retail store equity 
than for corporate reputation. 
 
4. 
Empirical Study 
To analyze our hypotheses, we conducted three consecutive empirical studies, 
including studies with cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental designs. 
First, we used a cross-sectional design on a large sample questioning do-it-
yourselfers to briefly test the applied theoretical framework against alternative 
models. Second, we conducted a longitudinal design in two other retail sectors 
(fashion and grocery) to ensure generalizability and to overcome the statistical 
shortcomings of equilibrium and stationarity concerning the cross-sectional 
design. Third, we applied an experimental design to two different samples that 
study a real retailer and a fictional retailer to prove causality. This procedure 
provides a valid methodology to conduct a detailed analysis of reciprocal rela-
tionships. In the following section, we outline the aims and sample designs, 
measurements, method, the results, and main limitations for each study. 
4.1. 
Study 1: Cross-Sectional Study 
4.1.1 Aims and sample design 
To analyze our hypotheses and test our theorized model for chain store retail-
ers, we applied a cross-sectional sample that was obtained at 30 locations of a 
single retailer. To develop the sample, we collaborated with a chain store re-
tailer in the home improvement and do-it-yourself (DIY) sector. The retailer has 
stores located in suburban areas all over the country and uses a standardized 
retail brand that is centrally coordinated and communicated. Because the cor-
poration and its stores operate under the same brand, the brand name serves 
as a cue for consumers to retrieve corporate and store knowledge from 
memory (Biehal and Sheinin 2007). To ensure the independence of the per-
ceptions of consumers with regard to the retailer’s stores, we asked the CEO 
and sales area managers to suggest stores with varying degrees of success in 
30 different cities. We verified that specific promotional activities were not con-
ducted during or one week prior to the data collection period. Following 

Study 1: Reciprocal Effects of the Corporate Reputation and Store Equity of Retailers 
41 
Verhoef, Langerak, and Donkers (2007), we created a sector-specific quota 
sampling based on age and gender with the aim of interviewing 170-200 con-
sumers per city. The sample distribution of typical DIY consumers was provid-
ed by an independent national DIY organization. 
After pre-tests were administered, the survey was conducted in each city using 
a standardized questionnaire and face-to-face interviews over a one-week pe-
riod, with approximately the same number of interviews conducted each day. 
Every third person who passed the interviewers in the city center and con-
formed to the sample was asked to participate (similar to Orth and Holancova 
2004). Each respondent was first asked to list the local DIY retailers that he or 
she knew. Only the respondents who knew the DIY retailer and the particular 
store under examination participated in the survey. We collected data from a 
total of 5,626 respondents. Then, we applied multivariate detection of outliers 
according to Mahalanobis’ D2 divided by the number of variables involved (Hair 
et al. 2006, p. 75). As 26 cases yielded values above four, we excluded these 
cases from further analysis. This procedure yielded a total of 5,600 respond-
ents, with an average of 186 respondents per city. The realized sample distri-
bution satisfied the planned quota sample (see Table B–2). Prior to the de-
tailed analysis of confirmatory and structural modeling through Mplus, we test-
ed for univariate normality with regard to kurtosis and skewness (Finch, West, 
and MacKinnon 1997) and multivariate normality using Mardia’s coefficient 
(Vlachopoulos 2008). All values indicated that the data are normally distribut-
ed.

Study 1: Reciprocal Effects of the Corporate Reputation and Store Equity of Retailers 
43 
Corporate reputation was measured according to the scale of Walsh, Beatty 
and Shiu (2009) by means of three items for each of the five dimensions (cus-
tomer orientation, good employer, reliable and financially strong company, so-
cial and environmental responsibility, and product and service quality). We 
measured retail store equity according to the scale of Verhoef, Langerak and 
Donkers (2007) with four items (strong, well-known, favorable and unique 
brand). Store loyalty was measured using three items according to the scale of 
Sirohi, McLaughlin and Wittink (1998). The scales were pre-tested by means 
of two consumer focus groups and quantitatively tested in one city using a 
questionnaire (N = 170). The quantitative pre-test provides satisfactory values 
for reliability and validity. We included antecedents of corporate reputation and 
retail store equity as instrumental variables. The inclusion of these instrumen-
tal variables is a methodological requirement in non-recursive models that 
analyze reciprocal relationships (Kline 2011, p. 156). Because corporate 
communication is seen as a core antecedent of corporate reputation (Van Riel 
and Fombrun 2007; Walsh and Beatty 2007), this factor was included as an 
instrumental variable of corporate reputation and was measured with three 
items (adopted from Kelly and Stephenson 1967). Because store attributes are 
seen as the main antecedents of retail store equity (Jinfeng and Zhilong 2009; 
Ailawadi and Keller 2004; Yoo, Donthu, and Lee 2000), we included percep-
tions of store attributes as an instrumental variable and measured it using five 
items (according to Chowdhury, Reardon, and Srivastava 1998). 
We also included some covariates in the study. As the sector-specific sample 
structure does not follow the general distribution of the basic population and as 
consumer behavior might be influenced by gender (0 = male, 1 = female) and 
age (Schenk, Löffler, and Rauh 2007), we controlled for both variables. We al-
so included a variable that describes DIY ability as a covariate (self-reported on 
a four-point scale from beginner to expert) based on the suggestion of Pan and 
Zinkhan (2006), who posit that personality traits, such as self confidence, might 
be important in influencing store patronage. Furthermore, we included competi-
tive intensity as a covariate, following Sloot, Verhoef, and Franses (2005). We 
measured this covariate as the number of competitors within a 2-mile radius, 
which was chosen according to information from the sales managers on rele-
vant competitor distances in the retail sector, applying a median split (Gauri, 

44 
Chapter B 
Sudhir, and Talukdar (2008), with 0 = two or fewer competitors and 1 = more 
than two competitors, according to Talukdar, Gauri, and Grewal (2010)). Final-
ly, we included store familiarity, measured with a single item (according to In-
man, Winer, and Ferraro (2009)), because it might influence store loyalty. 
4.1.3 Method 
To reduce the complexity of the subsequent model (Steenkamp, Batra, and 
Alden 2003), we used item parceling for corporate reputation. Rather than us-
ing five different latent constructs that each represent one dimension of corpo-
rate reputation, we used one item for each dimension, and this method yielded 
one latent construct with five items. The item parceling was performed by av-
eraging the item scores (Bandalos 2002) for each dimension of corporate rep-
utation. Therefore, prior to testing the overall measurement model in conjunc-
tion with corporate reputation in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using 
parcels, we tested the original measurement scale of corporate reputation (i.e., 
the five dimensions) for reliability and validity (see Table B–4).

To confirm the reliability of measurements, we ensured that the corrected item-
to-total correlation was above .5 (Hair et al. 2006, p. 137). To assess construct 
reliability, Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability were computed. These 
values exceeded the recommended thresholds of .7 (Nunnally 1978, p. 245) 
and .6 (Bagozzi and Yi 1988, p. 80), respectively. With respect to validity, face 
validity was assessed by means of pre-tests. For construct validity, all of the 
factor loadings of the CFA were above .5 (Hair et al. 2006, p. 777), and the 
average variance extracted (AVE) values with a threshold of .5 provided sup-
port for convergent validity (Bagozzi and Yi 1988, p. 80).

a For situations in which the criterion of Fornell and Larcker (1981) was violated, we also checked the 
discriminant validity using a chi-square difference test by following the approach of Anderson and 
Gerbing (1988). This procedure yielded satisfactory results because the nested model (the nested 
model is the more restrictive model with more degrees of freedom due to successively fixed correla-
tions at value one) fits significantly more poorly (p < .001) than the comparison model. Thus, discrimi-
nant validity is assured.

We also tested the five latent constructs for discriminant validity (Fornell and 
Larcker 1981, p. 46). As some squared correlations exceeded the AVE values 
of the two respective constructs (see Table B–5), we additionally verified the 
discriminant validity using a chi-square difference test following the procedure 
of Anderson and Gerbing (1988, p. 416). For each violated case, we alternate-
ly compared the fit value of the proposed comparison model with the fit values

of a nested model. The nested model is a more restrictive model with more 
degrees of freedom due to a fixed correlation at value one between the two 
involved constructs. As the fits of all computed nested models were significant-
ly poorer (p < .001) than that of the comparison model, discriminant validity 
can be assured. The fit values for this confirmatory model were satisfactory 
(CFI .975; TLI .967; RMSEA .065; SRMR .029; F²(80) = 1,946.024) despite the 
F²/df value (Hinkin 1995). As the latter fit value is dependent on the sample 
size, a value beyond the recommended thresholds can be considered ac-
ceptable (Wheaton 1987).

We handled common-method bias a priori by employing an appropriate ques-
tionnaire design, including appropriate question order, and a posteriori by cal-
culating a single-factor test using confirmatory factor analysis (Podsakoff et al. 
2003). The model with all items loading on a single factor (CFI .773; TLI .744; 
RMSEA .131; SRMR .072; F²(152) = 14,663.022) showed significantly wors-
ened fit values in comparison to our model (ǻF²(10) = 12206.149, p < .000). 
We further applied the marker variable technique (Lindell and Whitney 2001) 
following the latent variable approach of Williams, Hartman, and Cavazotte 
(2010). We used a variable named job (e.g., self-employed worker, civil serv-
ant, employee, laborer, or unemployed) because this variable is theoretically 
unrelated to the constructs of our model (similar to Rindfleisch, Burroughs, and 
Wong 2009). The results of the first phase (Table B–8) indicate that the corre-
lations between the latent constructs are not biased through the marker varia-
ble (Method-U vs. Method-R).

The results of the second phase (Table B–9) show that the amount of method 
variance, associated with the measurement of the substantive latent con-
structs, is less than 1 percent (between .350 and .946 percent). Because the 
impact of method variance in the study of Williams, Hartman, and Cavazotte 
(2010) was above 12.5 percent, we found that the present results of below one 
percent could be decreased. The results of the third phase (Table B–10) indi-
cate that marker-based method variance has a very low impact on construct 
correlations.

We tested whether structural coefficients change due to the presence of a 
marker variable. This approach was similar to the test for changes in correla-
tion (Phase I). We calculated a baseline model constraining the effects of the 
marker variable to zero. A second model allowed the effects of the marker var-
iable to be freely estimated. The chi-square and degrees of freedom of this 
model were compared with the chi-square and degrees of freedom of a third

model. The third model was calculated like the second model (effects of mark-
er variable are present), fixing the structural effects between the substantive 
constructs of our model to those values of the baseline model. The results in-
dicate that the structural coefficients are not affected by common-method bias 
(ǻF²(6) = .194, no significant difference). In summary, we concluded that 
common-method bias was not a major issue in our study.

As the data have a hierarchical structure (consumers are nested within the 30 
stores), we tested for the requirements of multi-level modeling (Wagner et al. 
2006) and found small intra-class correlations for all items (.034). As the vari-
ance of our dependent variable was not significant between the stores, there is 
no significant variation in consumer perceptions between stores. Therefore, we 
did not test the hypotheses with multi-level modeling, as no additional explana-
tion of variance can be given.  
Prior to testing the hypotheses, we calculated three rival models (see Table B–
11). In consideration of schema theoretical reasoning and schema activation 
(Malle and Horowitz 1995), retail store equity and corporate reputation may 
have a unidirectional relationship. However, applying corporate reputation as 
an antecedent of retail store equity and treating retail store equity as a mediator

Chapter B 
yielded significantly poorer fit values in comparison with those of the proposed 
model (CFI .937; TLI .926; RMSEA .058; SRMR .046; F²(226) = 4,445.446; 
ǻF²(2) = 860.544, p < .001). In addition, treating corporate reputation as a me-
diator and applying retail store equity as an antecedent of corporate reputation 
significantly and negatively affected the fit values (CFI .944; TLI .934; 
RMSEA .054; SRMR .034; F²(226) = 3,947.387; ǻF²(2) = 362.485, p < .001). 
We further calculated a nested model without any effects between retail store 
equity and corporate reputation and therefore analyzed the model without me-
diating effects and thus, only included the two direct paths to store loyalty. The 
fit of this third rival model was also significantly poorer than that of our hypothe-
sized proposed model (CFI .936; TLI .925; RMSEA .058; SRMR .048; 
F²(227) = 4,508.744; ǻF²(3) = 923.842, p < .001). These results therefore sup-
port the proposed theoretical model.

Study 1: Reciprocal Effects of the Corporate Reputation and Store Equity of Retailers 
51 
To test the hypotheses, we applied non-recursive structural equation modeling 
(SEM) using Mplus and including the previously addressed instrumental varia-
bles as well as a required disturbance correlation between the two constructs 
that were assumed to have a reciprocal relationship (Kline 2011; Frone, Rus-
sell, and Cooper 1994). A test of exogeneity of the instrumental variables 
(Frone, Russell, and Cooper 1994; Antonakis et al. 2010) revealed that per-
ceptions of store attributes are exogenous and that corporate communication 
may be endogenous (Hausman 1978). However, the structure of the path es-
timates remained the same, thus still supporting our hypotheses (see Appen-
dix 1 for details). The fit values of the proposed model were all satisfactory 
(CFI .950; TLI .940; RMSEA .052; SRMR .030; F²(224) = 3,584.902).  
4.1.4 Results and limitations 
With regard to the assumption of reciprocity, the effect of corporate reputation 
on retail store equity is positive and significant (E = .274, p < .001), and the 
effect of retail store equity on corporate reputation is also positive and signifi-
cant (E = .635, p < .001). Thus, H1 is supported (see Table B–11). The results 
also support H2, which states that retail store equity has a stronger positive 
influence on store loyalty than corporate reputation. Although the effects of 
corporate reputation (E = .369, p < .001) and retail store equity (E = .338, 
p < .001) on store loyalty are equally positive and significant, the total sum of 
effects that influence store loyalty is greater for retail store equity (E = .692, 
p < .001) than for corporate reputation (E = .559, p < .001). We tested whether 
these effects differ significantly by constraining the respective effects to be es-
timated equally and calculating a chi-square difference test. The test showed 
that retail store equity has the strongest overall effect on store loyalty 
(ǻF²(2) = 69.112, p < .001). Thus, H2 is supported. With respect to the covari-
ates, DIY ability (p < .01) has a significant negative effect on store loyalty, 
whereas store familiarity (p < .001) has a significant positive effect. 
We must mention two crucial limitations of this cross-sectional study. First, be-
cause the data refer to only one retailer and one retail sector, the generaliza-
tion of the results may be limited. However, an analysis of reciprocity that is 
based on 30 locations provides a certain degree of stability, especially when it 
includes perception differences in store brand equities in local markets. Se-

52 
Chapter B 
cond, an analysis of reciprocal effects in cross-sectional SEM might be inap-
propriate in terms of equilibrium and stationarity (Kaplan, Harik, and Hotchkiss 
2001), i.e., the values of the estimates regarding the effects of the reciprocal 
relationship between the two constructs are not dependent on any time point 
of the data collection, and the “structural equation for a variable is not different 
at the two points of measurement” (Kenny 1975, p. 890). Thus, there are ad-
vantages in using a panel design to analyze reciprocal effects (Kline 2011, p. 
109). 
4.2. 
Study 2: Longitudinal Study 
4.2.1 Aims and sample design 
To address the shortcomings of the cross-sectional study, we conducted a 
longitudinal study, specifically a cross-lagged analysis, to test for reciprocity 
(H1) and to determine for whether retail store equity has a stronger effect than 
corporate reputation on store loyalty (H2). Surveying the same respondents at 
three points in time is a more suitable method of testing reciprocal relation-
ships (Menard 2002) compared with a cross-sectional analysis. To make gen-
eralizations regarding the reciprocal relationship of corporate reputation and 
retail store equity, we chose two other retail sectors (fashion and grocery). We 
also expanded the consumer evaluations by including the associations of sev-
eral chain store retailers for each retail sector but analyzing data on only one 
retailer for each sector.  
To develop the two samples, we used quota sampling (national distribution of 
population according to age and gender) for 200-230 consumers per retail 
sector. The sampling was conducted in three waves in one middle-sized city 
over a period of eight months using a standardized questionnaire and face-to-
face interviews at the respondents’ homes. All trained interviewers had to re-
cruit the same number of participants across genders and age groups for both 
the fashion and grocery samples (Patterson and Smith 2003) to reduce the 
possible selection biases of the interviewers. We used a gift coupon lottery as 
incentive for participation, following Ganesh et al. (2010). Each respondent 
was first asked to list the local fashion or grocery retailers he or she knows. 
Respondents were then instructed to name three retailers from which they 
frequently purchase either apparel or groceries. In the first wave, we randomly 

Study 1: Reciprocal Effects of the Corporate Reputation and Store Equity of Retailers 
53 
chose one of the three mentioned retailers for the respondents to evaluate in 
all the subsequent waves. We included the respondents who participated in 
all three waves in the analysis; 82.9 percent of the fashion sample respond-
ents and 84.6 percent of the grocery sample respondents completed all the 
data collection waves. This procedure resulted in a total of 609 observations 
(203 respondents per wave) for the fashion sample and a total of 627 obser-
vations (209 respondents per wave) for the grocery sector. Using the afore-
mentioned procedure to identify outliers (study one), we found no striking 
cases in either sample. With respect to the intended quotas (see Table B–12), 
the under-25 age group is slightly overrepresented in our two samples, 
whereas the over-50 age group is slightly underrepresented. Overall, thirty 
fashion retailers with different fashion orientations and eleven grocery retail-
ers with different retail formats were assessed for their respective samples; 
approximately half of the responses were related to diversified retailers and 
half to non-diversified retailers in each sample.

Tests for normality found that the fashion data are normally distributed. For the 
grocery data, however, we found one variable that shows only a mediocre val-
ue for kurtosis at one time point (the first item of store loyalty at time point 
one). Overall, we concluded that both data samples could be treated as nor-
mally distributed.

4.2.2 Measurement and method 
We used the same measurements and scales that were used in the first study 
to measure corporate reputation, retail store equity, and store loyalty. As in the 
first study, we began by testing the corporate reputation dimensions for both 
the fashion and grocery samples and again used item parceling to reduce 
complexity in this longitudinal design. The values for reliability and validity 
were satisfactory for both the fashion and grocery sectors (see Table B–13). 
With regard to discriminant validity, we separately tested each time point with 
the corresponding five corporate reputation dimensions for each of the sam-
ples (see Table B–14). In situations in which the Fornell and Larcker criterion 
(1981) was violated, we calculated a chi-square difference test that was similar 
to the procedure used in the first study. In sum, we calculated five difference 
tests, all of which indicated that the constructs in all three waves are discrimi-
nating for both samples.  
Following these initial tests, for the corporate reputation dimensions, we deter-
mined the reliability and validity of the measurements of the two overall models 
(corporate reputation with item parcels, retail store equity, and store loyalty; see 
Table B–15) for both the fashion and grocery samples. The uniqueness item of 
the retail store equity construct had to be excluded from the analysis in both 
samples due to a low item-to-total correlation. All other values show satisfacto-
ry values, except that the AVE value for store loyalty at time point one in the 
grocery sector was below .5. We chose to retain this construct in the model for 
two reasons. First, the chi-square test detected that a model without this con-
struct yielded a significantly poorer fit than the model with the construct 
(CFI .944; 
TLI .930; 
RMSEA .065; 
SRMR .060; 
F²(350) = 654.916, 
ǻF²(76) = 99.157, p < .05). Second, this choice enabled us to compare the re-
sults of the fashion and grocery samples with regard to the effects on loyalty.

a For situations in which the criterion of Fornell and Larcker (1981) was violated, we also checked the discriminant validity using a chi-square difference 
test by following the approach of Anderson and Gerbing (1988). This procedure yielded satisfactory results because the nested model (the nested model 
is the more restrictive model with more degrees of freedom due to successively fixed correlations at value one) fits significantly more poorly (p < .001) 
than the comparison model. Thus, discriminant validity is assured.

The tests of discriminant validity were conducted separately for the three corre-
sponding constructs at each time point and for each sample. The results, in-
cluding five calculated chi-square difference tests (see Table B–16), show that 
the constructs are discriminatory. Finally, the fit values for the two confirmatory 
models were satisfactory (CFI .946; TLI .934; RMSEA .065; SRMR .059; 
F²(426) = 796.540 for the fashion sample; and CFI .944; TLI .931; RMSEA .061; 
SRMR .061; F²(426) = 754.073 for the grocery sample).  
Prior to testing the hypotheses, we determined whether the measurements are 
invariant over time (Raykov and Amemiya 2008). The analysis of measure-
ment invariance is performed by applying confirmatory factor analysis. The use 
of this approach requires a sequence of successive tests in which each step is 
a requirement for the following step. The first step assures configural invari-
ance by assessing the model fit of the baseline model in which the factor load-
ings and intercepts are freely estimated for each time point. Second, a factor 
loading invariant model is calculated. In this step, the factor loadings of each 
item are fixed across time points. The goodness-of-fit statistics for the second 
model are then compared with the corresponding values for the first model. 
We applied several differences-in-fit indices to determine the measurement 
invariance (e.g., chi-square difference tests and ǻCFI). The third step is de-
signed to fix the intercepts of each item across all time points. When a good 
comparison between the factor loading invariant model and the third model is 
obtained, measurement invariance is approved. As full measurement invari-
ance was not accomplished for both samples, partial invariance was ascer-
tained (Byrne, Shavelson, and Muthén 1989). This determination was made by 
freeing several intercept and factor loading values (see Table B–17). The re-
sults indicate the good fit of all models and provide support for the proposition 
that partial measurement invariance holds for all constructs of both the fashion 
and grocery samples. The derived partial invariance models of both sectors 
are used in the subsequent analyses of hypotheses testing.

a For situations in which the criterion of Fornell and Larcker (1981) was violated, we also checked the 
discriminant validity using a chi-square difference test by following the approach of Anderson and 
Gerbing (1988). This procedure yielded satisfactory results because the nested model (the nested 
model is the more restrictive model with more degrees of freedom due to successively fixed correla-
tions at value one) fits significantly more poorly (p < .001) than the comparison model. Thus, discri-
minant validity is assured.

To test the hypotheses, we applied a cross-lagged design (Finkel 1995) for 
SEM using Mplus for both samples. As a cross-lagged design includes the 
stability effects of each variable over time (e.g., the modeled path from the 
corporate reputation at time point one to the corporate reputation at time point 
two), we modeled the corresponding effects. A second characteristic of cross-
lagged panel models is the use of disturbance correlations with respect to the 
indicators (Burkholder and Harlow 2003). Thus, we modeled disturbance cor-

62 
Chapter B 
relations of the same indicators across all time points. Third, as the same ef-
fects are said to be equal over time (Finkel 1995, p. 29), we included corre-
sponding constraints (e.g., that the effect of corporate reputation at time point 
one on retail store equity at time point two and the respective effect from time 
point two on time point three are estimated equally). Fourth, we included dis-
turbance correlations between all constructs at time point two and integrated 
them at time point three (Finkel 1995, p. 28). The same disturbance correla-
tions between time points two and three are constrained and thus estimated 
equally (Finkel 1995, p. 30); for example, the disturbance correlation between 
corporate reputation and retail store equity at time point two is equally estimat-
ed at time point three. All of the fit values of the cross-lagged structural model 
are satisfactory for both retail sectors (CFI .946; TLI .940; RMSEA .062; 
SRMR .067; F²(477) = 852.068 for the fashion sector; and CFI .937; TLI .930; 
RMSEA .061; SRMR .074; F²(476) = 846.449 for the grocery sector). 
4.2.3 Results and limitations 
With regard to the assumption of reciprocity, the effect of corporate reputation 
on retail store equity is positive and significant over time in both samples 
(fashion: E1-2 = .202, p < .01; E2-3 = .218, p < .01; grocery: E1-2 = .143, p < .05; 
E2-3 = .152, p < .05). The effect of retail store equity on corporate reputation is 
also positive and significant over time (fashion: E1-2 = .103, p < .1; E2-3 = .100, 
p < .1; grocery: E1-2 = .092, p < .1; E2-3 = .096, p < .1) (see Table B–18). Thus, 
the assumption of reciprocity between corporate reputation and retail store eq-
uity (H1) is supported. The results also provide support for H2, which proposes 
that retail store equity has a stronger positive effect on store loyalty than cor-
porate reputation. Corporate reputation has no significant effect on store loyal-
ty in either sample, whereas the effects of retail store equity are significant 
(fashion: E1-2 = .127, p < .05; E2-3 = .122, p < .05; grocery: E1-2 = .241, p < .01; 
E2-3 = .282, p < .01). Additionally, the sum of the direct and indirect effects on 
store loyalty is significant for retail store equity. This result is applicable to both 
the fashion and grocery samples.

One limitation of the longitudinal study relates to the minor effect of retail store 
equity on corporate reputation. This minor effect may be caused by the small 
sample size or the sampling distribution (with respect to age or gender). A rep-
lication of the study would allow the model to be analyzed using a larger sam-
ple size, and the inclusion of sample weights would address the topic of sam-
pling distribution. The second limitation concerns methodology. Even if panel 
designs offer advantages over cross-sectional designs in analyzing reciprocal 
relationships, Kline (2011, p. 293) remarked that if a structural model is tested 
without an experimental design, one should “not make claims about verifying 
causality”.

Study 3: Experimental Study 
4.3.1 Aims and sample design 
Addressing the shortcomings of the first two studies, we conducted an experi-
mental study using a 2 x 3 design (a real or fictional retailer with a corporate, 

64 
Chapter B 
store, or control message). In the first setting, we used one fictional DIY retail-
er, and in the second setting, we used one real DIY retailer. We chose this ap-
proach to establish whether reciprocity exists in both fictional and real settings. 
Furthermore, the possible effects of shopping experience and brand knowledge 
are excluded in the fictional retailer setting to provide internal validity.

After pre-testing the manipulations with graduate students (N = 23), we con-
ducted DIY-specific quota sampling according to age and gender as done in 
the first study. Each respondent was randomly chosen for either the real or 
fictional retailer setting and was asked to name all local DIY retailers with 
which he or she was familiar at the beginning of the questionnaire. To partici-
pate in the real retailer setting, the respondents had to be familiar with the real 
retailer that we chose for the experiment. This procedure resulted in 332 total 
respondents: 165 respondents for the fictional setting and 167 respondents for 
the real retailer setting. Altogether, the realized samples met the intended 
sampling (see Table B–19), except that the over-64 age group was un-
derrepresented in the real retailer setting. With regard to the survey design, we 
considered visual design and the hierarchy of effects to counteract the possi-
bility of common method bias.

4.3.2 Measurement and method 
We used the same measurements and scale that were used in our two previ-
ous studies to measure corporate reputation, retail store equity, and store loy-
alty. Store loyalty was measured only for the real retailer sample, as the 
measurement of repurchase intentions is not applicable to the fictional retail 
setting. The measurements were tested for reliability and validity (see Table 
B–20). All values for corporate reputation and retail store equity were satisfac-
tory for both the fictional and real samples, and the values for store loyalty 
were satisfactory for the real retailer sample.  
Prior to participating in a face-to-face interview using the standardized question-
naire, each respondent listened to one cover story (a corporate, store, or control 
message) pertaining to a DIY retailer. All of the cover stories (which appeared in 
the form of newspaper cuttings) were structured similarly and contained corpo-
rate and store information pertaining to the (real or fictional) retailer. The neutral 
corporate information was provided through a statement regarding the site of 
the headquarters and the number of stores that belong to the corporation. The 
neutral store information was given by explaining the services and product cat-
egories that are offered in the stores. With the exception of the control group 
(who received the two neutral messages as described above), we further in-
cluded positive manipulations for the corporation or the store, respectively. For 
the corporate manipulation, we positively activated the ‘customer orientation’ 
and ‘good employer’ dimensions (Walsh, Beatty, and Shiu 2009) by writing that 
a well-known national retail association named the corporation as the best DIY 
retailer in the country in 2010 because of its excellent customer orientation and 
outstanding leadership (compared with other leading competitors in the market). 
For the purpose of store manipulation, we positively activated the ‘favorability’ 
and ‘uniqueness’ characteristics of the store (Verhoef, Langerak, and Donkers 
2007). We wrote that a well-known local chamber of commerce named the store 
as the best DIY store in 2010 because of its outstanding attractiveness and 
found the store to be outstanding compared with major competing stores. Thus, 
the manipulated stories differed in their activation of information at the corporate 
and store levels, whereas identical stories were provided for the fictional retailer 
setting (please see Appendix 2 for the presentation of cover stories).

Prior to the manipulation checks and hypothesis testing, we calculated indices 
for all scales. In the manipulation checks, we analyzed the differences in mean 
values between the experimental groups (corporate and store messages) and 
the control group (neutral message) by comparing the corporate reputation 
index between the control message and corporate message groups and by 
comparing the retail store equity index between the control message and store 
message groups. All manipulation checks for the fictional and real retailer 
samples yielded significant differences and proved that the manipulations were 
successful (see Table B–21). We tested the hypotheses using regression 
analysis with SPSS.

4.3.3 Results and limitations 
With regard to the first hypothesis, we chose the corporate message group to 
analyze the effect of corporate reputation on retail store equity in the first step. 
Second, we chose the store message group to examine the effect of retail 
store equity on corporate reputation (see Table B–22). Both effects are signif-
icant and positive for the fictional and real retailer samples (fictional retailer: 
ECRÆRSE = .669, 
p < .001; 
ERSEÆCR = .510, 
p < .001; 
and 
real 
retailer: 
ECRÆRSE = .674, p < .001; ERSEÆCR = .572, p < .001). Thus, the assumption of 
reciprocity between corporate reputation and retail store equity is supported 
(H1). Considering the effects on store loyalty for the real retailer sample, we 
tested the effect of corporate reputation on store loyalty using the corporate 
message group and analyzed the effect of retail store equity on store loyalty 
using the store message group. Corporate reputation and retail store equity 
positively affect store loyalty (ECRÆSL = .514, p < .001; ERSEÆSL = .321, p < .01). 
However, as retail store equity has a weaker effect on store loyalty than corpo-
rate reputation, the results do not support H2. 
One limitation of this experimental study is its restricted external validity. How-
ever, by applying quota sampling (particularly a sector-specific sampling) ra-
ther than convenience sampling, we attempted to address external validity to a 
certain extent. The reciprocity of corporate reputation and retail store equity is 
supported, but we cannot confirm that the effect of retail store equity on store 

68

loyalty is stronger than that of corporate reputation. The cause of the latter re-
sult requires further discussion and investigation.

Discussion and Conclusions 
This article examines the reciprocity between corporate reputation and retail 
store equity as well as their effects on store loyalty by conducting studies with 
cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental designs. This under-researched 
area is relevant because retailers are increasingly focusing on their corporate 
reputations and the positioning of their stores as strong brands and because 
they frequently must decide on actions such as the relative allocation of pro-
motional investments across different levels (e.g., corporation, store, and store 
brands) to attract consumers. We found strong evidence that corporate reputa-
tion and retail store equity have a positive reciprocal relationship and that retail 
store equity has the greatest effect on store loyalty. Thus, we agree with the 
early conceptual conclusions of Atkin (1962) and Stanley and Sewall (1976) 
that reciprocal effects between corporate and store levels exist. These obser-
vations have both theoretical and managerial implications. 

Study 1: Reciprocal Effects of the Corporate Reputation and Store Equity of Retailers 
69 
5.1. 
Theoretical Implications 
This study contributes to theory because the conceptualization of reciprocal 
relationships for associative concepts can be explained using schema theory. 
With respect to the first research question, concerning the reciprocal relation-
ship between corporate reputation and retail store equity, the results strongly 
support the existence of positive reciprocal relationship. Thus, it can be con-
cluded that, in line with schema and associative network theory, schema acti-
vation can occur in both directions (e.g., Malle and Horowitz 1995) in that the 
links between two associative concepts point in two directions (Lei, Dawar, 
and Lemmink 2008). As positive reciprocal relationships exist between associ-
ative concepts in consumer’s memories, the present study provides strong 
empirical evidence for marketing rules that may have previously been founded 
mostly on managerial experience. Furthermore, the relationship and its posi-
tive direction were congruently demonstrated in all three studies, for one re-
tailer with 30 locations (cross-sectional design), for two other retail sectors in 
one city (longitudinal design), and for a real and fictional retailer setting in one 
sector (experimental design); thus, we can conclude that it may be stable. 
However, situational differences may occur because store-level factors may 
not dominate corporate-level factors for all consumers or in all local competi-
tive situations, for example. Thus, we call for further tests of contingencies 
within our or similar reciprocal models. 
With respect to the second research question, concerning the assumed differ-
ences in the strength of effects of corporate reputation and retail store equity 
on store loyalty, the results seems to be not fully consistent. However, two of 
our studies (the studies employing cross-sectional and longitudinal designs) 
show that retail store equity more strongly determines store loyalty than does 
corporate reputation. Consequently, it can be concluded that consumers acti-
vate the store-related node more frequently, i.e., through past and current 
shopping experiences (Anderson 1983; Malle and Horowitz 1995; Lei, Dawar, 
and Lemmink 2008), than the corporate-related node. Hence, consumers’ di-
rect contact with local stores (and thus the stored information about a specific 
store) primarily influences store loyalty among consumers in comparison to 
stored information about the corporation. More importantly, especially in our 
cross-sectional study, the direct effects of corporate reputation and store equi-

70 
Chapter B 
ty on store loyalty are of equal strength, whereas the total effect of store equity 
on store loyalty is significantly stronger. We conclude that this observation un-
derlines the necessity of including reciprocal relations in future studies be-
cause otherwise, the observed isolated effects might bias the results and con-
clusions drawn from such studies. Again, this observation might vary accord-
ing to various contingencies but seems to be stable, applying to 30 local stores 
of a DIY retailer in diverse local markets as well as to a typical local competi-
tive situation of fashion and food retailers in one city. However, the experi-
mental study does not support our assumption that retail store equity more 
strongly affects the store loyalty of consumers. These inconsistent findings 
must be discussed in greater detail. One reason for this contradictory result of 
the experimental study may be related to the study design (e.g., the sampling 
and manipulations). The presence of one underrepresented age group may 
have triggered the unexpected findings. This contradictory result may be also 
related to the abstract nature of the store-related information that was provided 
(i.e., the store was described as attractive and unique compared with other 
stores) in comparison with more specific, manipulated corporate information 
(i.e., excellent customer orientation and outstanding leadership in contrast with 
competing retailers). Although we find positive effects of the relationship be-
tween corporate reputation and retail store equity on store loyalty, the analysis 
of the strength of the effects requires further research. 
According to the methodology, this article provides a valid procedure to test for 
reciprocity assumptions by means of consecutively conducted studies. Alt-
hough each design is associated with the challenges and limitations that were 
discussed above, this procedure is a useful step-by-step approach to conduct 
a detailed analysis of corresponding assumptions and to understand reciproci-
ty.  
5.2. 
Managerial Implications  
This study has managerial implications, highlighting the importance of the re-
ciprocal effects that chain store retailers must take into account to efficiently 
attract consumers through various activities. Although the marketing rule of 
reciprocity may result from practical experience, it is beneficial to provide sci-
entific evidence regarding whether there are interrelations between, for exam-
ple, promotional investments, to determine which investment has a stronger 

Study 1: Reciprocal Effects of the Corporate Reputation and Store Equity of Retailers 
71 
impact on consumer behavior, and how resources can be allocated more effi-
ciently. In our context, the allocation of promotional investments between the 
more general corporate level and the more specific store level seems to be 
particularly challenging because consumer associations related to both levels 
interact in determining store loyalty and because these decisions are in the 
responsibility of different organizational units (e.g., corporate communication 
and sales). Thus, it is advantageous to align decisions so that positive, strong, 
and congruent associations of corporate reputation and store equity are creat-
ed to take advantage of the reciprocal effects of these investments. 
Because the results of our studies suggest that store loyalty is more strongly 
influenced by retail store equity than by corporate reputation (except in the ex-
perimental design), we conclude that retailers should generally focus on build-
ing a positive, strong, and unique retail store equity in the minds of consumers. 
This endeavor will be more effective in ensuring positive feedback on consum-
er store patronage behavior. However, solely focusing on store equity effects 
may be insufficient because corporate communication campaigns may be less 
expensive than campaigns concerning stores or further investments in creating 
attractive or unique stores. In practice, the efficient allocation of promotional 
resources depends on various contextual factors, such as the objectives of a 
retailer (e.g., for attracting more stakeholder groups, corporate communication 
may be more effective), the local competitive landscape (e.g., more effort 
should be placed on local stores in highly competitive communities), and es-
pecially consumer behavior (e.g., attracting consumers with high vs. low store 
experience). Thus, retailers need to consider these contingencies. Finally, our 
study demonstrates that positive relationships between constructs exist, but 
negative communication about the corporation (e.g., due to weak social re-
sponsibility) or negative consumer experiences in a store (e.g., due to weak 
service) may also be transferred and be of consequence. 
 
6. 
Limitations and Further Research 
With respect to the linkage between corporate reputation and retail store equi-
ty as well as their influence on consumer behavior for chain store retailers, 
there is still a need for further research. In addition to the limitations that were 

72 
Chapter B 
briefly mentioned for each study, we identify three further limitations. First, we 
concentrated on two levels of perception in this study: the more general corpo-
rate reputation and the more specific retail store equity. Future studies could 
focus on other levels (e.g., store or products brands, corporate brands or chain 
brands in diversified companies, or e-commerce channels in multichannel re-
tailing). However, there is an absence of common distinctions as well as relat-
ed measures among some related concepts, such as reputation, image, and 
brand equity (Markwick and Fill 1997; Gotsi and Wilson 2001). Second, asso-
ciative, and thus cognitive, schema theoretical reasoning has been used in this 
study. Hence, it may be challenging to apply schema theory to reciprocal ef-
fects concerning more affective concepts (Da Silva and Syed Alwi 2006). 
Third, despite the inclusion of some covariates, the analyses were conducted 
without consideration of further contextual factors. Thus, future research 
should consider the contingencies of reciprocal effects, taking into considera-
tion factors such as consumer shopping motives (Schenk, Löffler, and Rauh 
2007), self-confidence (Pan and Zinkhan 2006), or store and brand familiarity 
(Cowley and Mitchell 2003; Inman, Winer, and Ferraro 2009; Benedicktus et 
al. 2010), as these may influence the analyzed relationships and may provide 
additional insights into the boundary conditions of reciprocal effects on con-
sumer behavior. However, we believe that the reciprocity and relative im-
portance of retail store equity will still be demonstrated because our additional 
analysis (not reported here) on the moderating role of store familiarity (meas-
ured by the item “how often do you visit a particular store” (Inman, Winer, and 
Ferraro (2009)) also supports this conclusion.

Study 2: Retail Branding and Local Competition: The 
Importance of Retail Brand Equity and Store Accessibility 
for Store Loyalty in Local Competition1 
 
1. 
Introduction 
Retailers increasingly aim to position their chains in the minds of consumers 
as strong, attractive, and unique brands (Ailawadi and Keller 2004; Verhoef, 
Langerak, and Donkers 2007). For example, IKEA has built a strong retail 
brand that mobilizes customers to drive substantial distances to their stores 
(Jonsson and Foss 2011), and Aldi’s brand strength is evoked in the memories 
of consumers even before a location opens. However, although the mantra for 
success is still `location, location, location´ for some retailers, Grewal et al. 
(2009; 2004) stated that retail brand equity determines the perceived values of 
local stores and the images of those stores. These authors assigned the pre-
dominant role of retail brand equity to consumer behavior, which is important 
because of the growing overstoring and convenience orientation of consum-
ers, and because firms typically have one retail brand but several stores that 
differ in terms of local competition and access convenience. To analyze the 
relative importance of retail brand equity and store accessibility for store loyal-
ty, this study focuses on two perspectives: 1) consumer evaluations of a focal 
retailer (i.e., a specific chain under investigation) and its local competitors in 
the same type of business and 2) the relationships among a focal retailer’s 
brand equity, store accessibility, and loyalty in different (objective) local com-
petitive situations. Accessibility is crucial in retailing (Reilly 1931; Grewal, 
Levy, and Kumar 2009) and is understood as the perceived convenience of a 
store’s location. Retail brand equity is understood as the qualities that con-
sumers associate with a retail chain, which serve as an important intangible 
asset (Jinfeng and Zhilong 2009). This topic is important for retailers because 
they must consider such effects when they allocate, for example, investments 
for building or supporting a strong retail brand or searching for accessible loca-
tions.

Chapter C 
Although scholars often study location issues, they have rarely focused on the 
relative importance of strong retail brands and store locations. According to 
early research (Reilly 1931; Huff 1964; Rust and Brown 1986; Achabal, Gorr, 
and Mahajan 1982; Durvasula, Sharma, and Andrews 1992), prior studies have 
focused on location as the core antecedent in explaining the store choices of 
consumers (Nakanishi and Cooper 1974; Bell, Ho, and Tang 1998; Finn and 
Louviere 1990; Popkowski Leszczyc, Sinha, and Timmermans 2000), their pat-
ronage, and store image (Mazursky and Jacoby 1986; Lindquist 1974). How-
ever, several studies have highlighted the decreasing relevance of location for 
the store choices of consumers (e.g., Bell, Ho, and Tang 1998), as explained, 
for example, by the increasing mobility of consumers. Furthermore, retail brand 
equity has increasingly garnered interest in recent literature (Grewal, Levy, and 
Lehmann 2004; Hartman and Spiro 2005; Jinfeng and Zhilong 2009; Burt and 
Davies 2010). Previous studies conceptualized the determining role of retail 
brand equity in location and consumer behavior (Grewal, Levy, and Kumar 
2009). However, despite the indisputable relevance of both retail brand equity 
and accessible store location, we found no research that analyses the effects of 
both constructs in explaining store loyalty, either in general or with regard to 
different local competitive situations. Thus, we aim to answer the question of 
whether retail brand equity or store accessibility has a stronger influence on 
store loyalty. Furthermore, two additional research gaps emerge. 
Studies have considered local competition to be an issue of perception, such 
as the perceived value of local competitors (Sirohi, McLaughlin, and Wittink 
1998) or the impression of competitive intensity (Seiders et al. 2005), but have 
not compared the effects of retail brands and location associations on retailers 
with the effects on competitors. For example, Hartman and Spiro (2005) con-
ceptualized store equity as consumer perceptions of one retailer in relation to 
those of other retailers using one variable. But separate evaluations of focal 
retailers and their competitors would allow for advanced conclusions regarding 
how the strong brand equity and store accessibility of both a focal retailer and 
its competitors determine store loyalty towards the focal retailer. For these 
reasons, we analyze the dependence of store loyalty towards a focal retailer 
on its own and the brand equity and store accessibility of its local competitors. 
An analysis of these issues will advance our knowledge of whether the brand 

Study 2: Retail Branding and Local Competition

equity or store accessibility of competitors has a stronger influence on the 
store loyalty of consumers with respect to a focal retailer. This approach will 
further our understanding of the relationship between centrally managed retail 
brand equity and local, conveniently accessible store locations.  
Many studies (e.g., Borgers and Timmermans 1987; Fotheringham 1988; Lo 
1990; Cleeren et al. 2010) have considered the objective characteristics of local 
competition in shopping alternatives and choice or cherry-picking behavior 
(Talukdar, Gauri, and Grewal 2010). These studies have not addressed the ob-
jective differences of local competition within retail brand-location-loyalty rela-
tionships. However, those studies, in addition to research on both multi-
purpose shopping and comparison shopping (e.g., Popkowski Leszczyc, Sinha, 
and Sahgal 2004; Gijsbrechts, Campo, and Nisol 2008; Dellaert et al. 1998), 
suggested that a substantial distance between a focal retailer and a competitor 
may strengthen the relative importance of convenient access to the focal retail-
er’s store because consumers may not wish to drive long distances. In contrast, 
a large number of competing stores may enhance the relative importance of a 
strong brand. Both scenarios are relevant for research and practice because a 
retailer can benefit from knowledge of how consumers are affected by brand 
and accessibility in different competitive situations. This knowledge may assist 
retailers in determining whether future investment allocations should support 
strong retail brands or accessible locations in their store networks. 
In sum, this study aims to answer three research questions. Does retail brand 
equity or a convenient, accessible store location provide a greater contribution 
to the store loyalty of a focal retailer? To what extent do the retail brand equity 
and store accessibility of local competitors affect store loyalty towards a focal 
retailer? How do different objective competitive situations affect the brand and 
location effects on a focal retailer? 
By investigating these questions, this study contributes to the retailing litera-
ture, particularly with respect to brand effects, location, and local competition. 
From a theoretical perspective, we respond to the recommendation of Grewal 
et al. (2004) for further research on retail branding and their call for more cur-
rent studies on the issue of store location (Grewal, Levy, and Kumar 2009). 
Additionally, we present store loyalty as an important issue that remains wor-

76 
Chapter C 
thy of further research (Puccinelli et al. 2009), but loyalty is also a well-known 
outcome variable and thus facilitates our task of interpreting our findings in the 
context of past research. Furthermore, this study provides a detailed perspec-
tive on how retail brands predict the location perceptions and store loyalty of 
consumers, particularly in the context of local competition (subjective and ob-
jective). The latter has not been addressed in the retail literature; thus, central-
ly managed chain brands have not yet been properly studied. The findings of 
this study may further enhance retail managers’ understanding of the current 
roles of strong retail brands and convenient, accessible locations in local com-
petition. The remainder of the article is structured as follows. Based on theory 
and past studies, we derive a set of hypotheses that are tested using a cross-
sectional consumer sample from 30 cities. The results are presented and fol-
lowed by a discussion of the study and its limitations. 
 
2. 
Conceptualization and Hypothesis Development 
2.1. 
Conceptual Framework and Theory 
In this section, we examine the hypotheses proposed in this study. Our con-
ceptual model summarizes the set of relationships examined in this paper (see 
Figure C–1). Using the work of Grewal et al. (2004; 2009) and schema theoret-
ical reasoning, we propose that the brand equity of a focal retailer directly and 
indirectly determines store loyalty via store accessibility. Moreover, we suggest 
that the focal retailer’s store loyalty also depends on the subjective perceptions 
of the retail brand equity and store accessibility (Hartman and Spiro 2005) of 
the competitors (i.e., a retailer within the same business) (Sloot, Verhoef, and 
Franses 2005; Gauri, Trivedi, and Grewal 2008). Finally, we propose that the 
relationships to store loyalty are moderated by the objective characteristics of 
local competition because the literature shows that these characteristics may 
change the scope of the effects considering the focal retailer (Seiders et al. 
2005; Gauri, Trivedi, and Grewal 2008).  
Store loyalty is defined as the intention and readiness to repurchase at a par-
ticular store or recommend a store (Evanschitzky and Wunderlich 2006; Oliver 
1999). Therefore, store loyalty is understood as conative loyalty that repre-
sents the penultimate stage in loyalty formation (Harris and Goode 2004) and 

Study 2: Retail Branding and Local Competition 
77 
is viewed as a core predictor of consumer spending (Macintosh and Lockshin 
1997). Retail brand equity is defined as a consumer’s associations of a focal or 
competing retail chain as a strong, unique, and attractive brand (Verhoef, 
Langerak, and Donkers 2007, p. 100). Retail brand equity refers to a chain-
level retailer (Burt and Davies 2010); therefore, it corresponds to the ‘Gestalt 
view’ of a retail brand (Keaveney and Hunt 1992) and differs from the perspec-
tive of Martineau (1958a), who interpreted store image as the sum of store-
level associations (Ailawadi and Keller 2004). Store accessibility is defined as 
the consumer-perceived convenience of store access in terms of ease, speed, 
and simplicity (Teller and Reutterer 2008).

To address our research questions, we draw from three streams of theory and 
consider how past studies have examined loyalty, location, and competition 
from different theoretical perspectives (for an overview, see Brown and Dant 
2009; Craig, Ghosh, and McLafferty 1984).  
We refer to schema theory (Bartlett 1995; McVee, Dunsmore, and Gavelek 
2005; Puligadda, Ross Jr., and Grewal 2012) and thus rely on network models 
of consumer memory to explain retail brand equity and store accessibility as 
the antecedents of store loyalty. A network consists of nodes or concepts, 
such as objects and attributes, which represent stored information (e.g., Nel-
son et al. 1993), and the links between those nodes that are based on past 
experience (Mandler 1979). For example, consumers possess information re-

garding a chain’s retail brand and its stores as nodes in their minds as well as 
links between them; in hierarchical networks, retail brands are linked to sub-
categories (Cowley and Mitchell 2003), such as store-level information. Thus, 
brand equity and store accessibility represent different levels in a retail brand 
schema. As general information regarding retail brands is stored on the corpo-
rate (retail brand) level, retail brand equity refers to superior-level associations 
rather than store-level information, such as store accessibility. Referring to this 
structure of general retail brand associations and store-level attributes in the 
memories of consumers, we believe that retail brand equity influences the 
store location accessibility perceptions of consumers. This view supports the 
conceptualization provided by Grewal et al. (2004; 2009).  
Further, we draw on the theory of the allocation of time (Becker 1965) and the 
law of retail gravitation (e.g., Reilly 1931) because both notions addressed (ob-
jective) local competition and proposed that competitive intensity and distance 
to the nearest competitor influence relationships with the focal retailer. These 
theories assist in clarifying how the strength of the effects of a focal retailer’s 
retail brand equity and store accessibility differ as a result of varying local 
competitive situations (Seiders et al. 2005). Thus, we follow Dellaert et al. 
(2008), who asserted that varying contexts influence mental representations or 
information retrieval and thus also influence the determining effects on store 
loyalty. Consequently, we focus on two well-established variables: competitive 
intensity (i.e., the number of competitors in the trading area of a focal retailer 
(Sloot, Verhoef, and Franses 2005)) and (geographic) distance to the next 
competitor (Gauri, Trivedi, and Grewal 2008). Both of these variables are 
known to influence store choice and switching behavior (Seiders et al. 2005; 
Gauri, Trivedi, and Grewal 2008). The theory of the allocation of time is used 
to explain the influence of competitive intensity and distance to the next com-
petitor on the effect of a focal retailer’s store accessibility. As an increasing 
number of consumers encounter situations of time poverty, they tend to seek 
an optimal allocation of their time (Jacoby, Szybillo, and Berning 1976). Retail 
gravitation theory implies that there is a trade-off between store attractiveness 
and distance to a store. This theory is used to explain the influence of local 
competitive intensity and distance to the next competitor on the effects of a 
focal retailer’s retail brand equity. 

Study 2: Retail Branding and Local Competition 
79 
In the following sections, we first hypothesize the effects of a focal retailer and 
its competitors, and we then hypothesize the effects of the objective character-
istics of local competition. 
2.2. 
Hypotheses on the Perceptions of a Focal Retailer and its Competitors 
Three relationships are explained based on schema theoretical reasoning in 
this section: 1) the effects of retail brand equity and store accessibility on loyal-
ty, 2) the relationship between retail brand equity and store accessibility, and 
3) the relative strength of both constructs on loyalty. 
As noted previously, schema theory explains how information is stored in and 
retrieved from the memories of consumers (e.g., when deciding whether to 
shop at a store). For example, such brand schemes are stored in the memo-
ries of consumers as associative networks (Anderson 1983). Consumers refer 
to these associations when deciding whether to repurchase. In fact, Sirgy and 
Samli (1985) reported that consumers refer to schemata when deciding where 
to purchase; thus, a focal retailer’s retail brand equity and store accessibility 
can be considered the antecedents of store loyalty.  
The same logic applies to the relationship between the retail brand equity and 
store accessibility of competitors, as consumers consider these elements of 
the brand schemes of competitors when deciding whether to repurchase at a 
specific retailer’s location. Customers tend to compare local retailers (Hoch et 
al. 1995). If local competition is high and competitors are located near the focal 
retailer, then competitive advantages may erode (Seiders et al. 2005).Thus, 
customers tend to be less loyal to a focal retailer when the brand schemes of 
its competitors are more positive (Gounaris and Stathakopoulos 2004), as per-
ceptions of competitors may affect store loyalty towards the focal retailer nega-
tively if equally strong retailers are competing with one another. 
In sum, considering schema theory and empirical studies (Pan and Zinkhan 
2006; Chaudhuri and Ligas 2009; Jinfeng and Zhilong 2009), we argue that a 
focal retailer’s retail brand equity and store accessibility positively affect store 
loyalty towards the focal retailer. Furthermore, as consumer associations with 
a competitor’s retail brand and store accessibility compete with those with a 
focal retailer (James, Durand, and Dreves 1976), we conclude that positive 

80 
Chapter C 
competitor associations will negatively affect loyalty to a focal retailer. There-
fore, we propose the following hypothesis: 
H1a. 
The retail brand equity of a focal retailer has a positive 
effect on its store loyalty. 
H1b. 
The store accessibility of a focal retailer has a positive effect 
on its store loyalty. 
H2a. 
The retail brand equity of competitors has a negative effect 
on store loyalty towards the focal retailer. 
H2a. 
The store accessibility of competitors has a negative effect 
on store loyalty towards the focal retailer. 
Second, to understand the relationship between retail brand equity and store 
accessibility, one can again refer to the hierarchical networks that suggest that 
the cognitive representations of consumers follow a hierarchical structure (e.g., 
Hutchinson, Raman, and Mantrala 1994; Nedungadi 1990), whereas in our 
model, the nodes of the network represent the concepts of the retail brand (on 
the general ‘Gestalt’ level) and a store node, with its attributes (such as store 
accessibility) that are linked in the network as elements of different hierarchical 
levels. The retail brand of a chain store retailer acts as an ‘umbrella’ that com-
prises each individual store. However, each local store generates specific as-
sociations, has individual characteristics, and is thus perceived in an individual 
manner. For example, retailers such as Carrefour have locations that are easy 
or difficult to access from the perspectives of their customers and thus differ 
with regard to store-level associations (i.e., perceptions of store locations). As 
noted previously, associations with a retail brand and those with a store are 
elements of the hierarchically structured network in which consumer associa-
tions are stored in their memories. For our research context, we expect the 
influences to spread (Anderson 1983; Cowley and Mitchell 2003), flowing from 
the hierarchically higher level (i.e., the retail brand level) to the hierarchically 
lower level (i.e., the store level). For example, the retail brand node is activat-
ed through a television image campaign, and this activation allows for the acti-
vation of other related nodes (e.g., information regarding the accessibility of a 
particular store, which accounts for the store’s node). Therefore, we expect 

Study 2: Retail Branding and Local Competition 
81 
retail brand associations (i.e., retail brand equity) to have a positive influence 
on perceived store accessibility. The directionality of this relationship also re-
flects the exposure to new information (e.g., a new store) that consumers at-
tempt to integrate into an existing chain or corporate brand node to facilitate 
attitude formation with respect to the new entity (e.g., Boush and Loken 1991). 
In this case, a retailer’s name serves as a retrieval cue (Biehal and Sheinin 
2007) for information that is stored in consumer memories and for the catego-
rization process if the information is consistent. If categorization is successful, 
then consumers transfer their corporate associations to the new entity (the 
new store). Such behavior has already been observed in early studies that an-
alyzed consumers who had recently moved to a new apartment building and 
used a brand as a retrieval cue to chose a store at the new place of residence 
(e.g., Atkin 1962) as well as more recent studies on store brands (Grewal et al. 
1998; Bao, Bao, and Sheng 2011; Martenson 2007). 
These considerations are consistent with the conceptualization of Grewal et al. 
(2004; 2009), who emphasized the effects of retail brands on the evaluation of 
store attributes (e.g., Bloemer, De Ruyter, and Peeters 1998, for quality per- 
ceptions), which, in turn, influence consumer satisfaction, intention, and word 
of mouth. Thus, we conclude that strong and positive retail brand equity results 
in more positive perceptions of store accessibility. For example, a strong brand 
could induce consumers to drive a relatively long distance even if a store is (on 
an objective level) not easily accessible. The same relationship is expected 
with regard to the retail brand equity and store accessibility of competitors. 
Thus, we propose the following hypothesis: 
H3a. 
The retail brand equity of a focal retailer has a positive 
effect on its store accessibility. 
H3b. 
The retail brand equity of competitors has a positive effect 
on the store accessibility of these retailers. 
Third, it is of interest to analyze whether retail brand equity or store accessibil-
ity offers a greater contribution to store loyalty. It is well known that consumers 
retrieve information that is stored in their memories to plan, solve problems or 
make decisions, and thus to decide whether to repurchase at a store (Marshall 
1995). To explain which of these concepts is a stronger predictor of store loy-

82 
Chapter C 
alty we can rely on the strength of the linkages of both concepts. The strength 
of the linkages can be explained through the degree of activation. According to 
numerous scholars (Anderson 1983; Krishnan 1996; Lei, Dawar, and Lemmink 
2008), the strength of activation and the number of connections between a 
node and its associations increases with practice and thus with repeated acti-
vation. Thus, the possibility of retrieving a node is higher for nodes with more 
connections and with more frequent activation. Following this reasoning and 
knowing that the strength of links is based on the degree of repetition, practice, 
and recurring experience (Eckblad 1981; Anderson 1983; Malle and Horowitz 
1995; Cowley and Mitchell 2003; Campbell and Keller 2003; Lei, Dawar, and 
Lemmink 2008), one may imagine that the retail brand concept is activated 
and updated more frequently and that the store accessibility concept is used 
and activated less frequently. These differences may occur because the retail 
brand concept is activated directly and indirectly (e.g., via a retailer’s advertis-
ing, information in newspapers, personal recommendations or via stores as 
the point of purchase). Furthermore, the accessibility concept may be less fre-
quently activated in a direct manner if consumers do not frequently think about 
convenient accessibility. As the retail brand node is activated more often, it is 
likely that the respective store attribute of accessibility is retrieved less fre-
quently by consumers. Thus, we propose that retail brand equity has a strong-
er influence on store loyalty than does store accessibility.  
H4a. 
The retail brand equity of a focal retailer influences its store 
loyalty more strongly than its store accessibility does.  
H4b. 
The retail brand equity of competitors influences store 
loyalty towards the focal retailer more strongly than the 
competitors’ store accessibility does. 
2.3. 
Hypotheses regarding the Effects of the Objective Characteristics of 
Local Competition 
In the following sections, we first hypothesize the moderating effects of com-
petitive intensity considering the effects on a focal retailer, and we then hy-
pothesize the moderating effects of distance to the next competitor considering 
the effects on the focal retailer. 

Study 2: Retail Branding and Local Competition 
83 
Focusing first on competitive intensity, we assume that greater competitive in-
tensity is associated with a weaker positive effect of a focal retailer’s store ac-
cessibility on store loyalty. The theory of the allocation of time (Becker 1965) 
states that one portion of overall household time is dedicated to consumer 
shopping activities. Thus, transportation and search costs are included in the 
total costs of shopping (Gauri, Trivedi, and Grewal 2008). The search costs for 
a specific product increase if time and money are needed to determine exactly 
what a consumer wants to purchase and where he or she wishes to shop. With 
regard to multi-purpose or comparison shopping and depending on the product 
category, consumers may need to spend time visiting stores in several loca-
tions. Consequently, if a large number of retailers in an area sell the same 
products, then the search costs of customers decrease. A search for a specific 
product entails less time and lower costs because the distances between the 
stores are shortened. Thus, especially in the context of comparison shopping, 
highly competitive situations reduce the costs that consumers pay when 
searching for a specific product because they can easily determine where, for 
example, the product quality, price, or service is best (Gijsbrechts, Campo, 
and Nisol 2008). Thus, high competitive intensity (for example, in retail ag-
glomerations) creates synergy effects for consumers with regard to their shop-
ping tasks, and these effects may attenuate the influence of store accessibility 
on store loyalty. Therefore, a context with numerous retailers in the same area 
with the same accessibility leads consumers to activate the respective retail 
brand nodes rather than retrieving accessibility information to determine where 
to shop. Consequently, we assume that competitive intensity will reduce the 
positive effect of store accessibility on store loyalty.  
Additionally, we suppose that with increasing competitive intensity, the influ-
ence of retail brand equity on store loyalty will increase. We offer this supposi-
tion because if there is a high concentration of competitors, then retail brand 
strength is likely to be more important in forming store loyalty. In situations in 
which customers can easily compare retailers, such as situations with high 
competitive intensity on the local level, competitors react to these or other re-
tailers’ marketing activities, which in turn leads to an alleviation of retailer offer-
ings; thus, the relative advantages of each store are narrow (Seiders et al. 
2005). However, these effects account for only the unsustainable dimensions 

84 
Chapter C 
of the retailer marketing mix that are easy to copy or to compensate (e.g., pric-
ing policy or promotion activities). In such situations, strong retail brands in-
duce differentiation. Thus, the influence of retail brand equity on store loyalty 
increases as competitive intensity increases. Moreover, as retail brand equity 
reflects the overall favorability of a retailer that is transferred to each single 
store, the influence of retail brand equity on consumer perception of store ac-
cessibility increases with the degree of competitive intensity. A higher number 
of shopping alternatives in an area (i.e., a higher competitive intensity) indi-
cates that more retailers sell the same products in the same area, and this 
higher number has a positive influence on comparison shopping scenarios and 
implies that the gravitational effect of an associated retail agglomeration also 
increases (Nelson 1958). In this situation, the relevance of a specific store lo-
cation assessment by a consumer depends less on aspects that include dis-
tance to the store (as it is more or less similar for all stores in an area); rather, 
the gravitational pull is greatest for the most favorable retail brand. This con-
text may in turn lead to a more positive assessment of a single store’s location, 
as the assessment processes include positive, more confirmative effects of 
brand familiarity (Campbell and Keller 2003). Therefore, the presence of nu-
merous retailers in the same area with the same accessibility leads consumers 
to deemphasize the node that considers accessibility because all retailers are 
located near consumers, and brand information is thus retrieved. Consequent-
ly, a focal retailer can use a strong retail brand to overcome the erosion of lo-
cation-specific advantages that may be caused by growing local competition 
(James, Durand, and Dreves 1976). Thus, we hypothesize as follows: 
H5a. 
For a focal retailer’s stores with higher competitive intensity, 
the positive influence of store accessibility on store loyalty 
will decrease. 
H5b. 
For a focal retailer’s stores with higher competitive intensity, 
the positive influence of retail brand equity on store loyalty 
will increase. 
H5c. 
For a focal retailer’s stores with higher competitive intensity, 
the positive influence of retail brand equity on store accessi-
bility will increase. 

Study 2: Retail Branding and Local Competition 
85 
Focusing second on the distance to the next competitor, we assume that a 
larger distance to the next competitor is associated with a stronger positive 
effect of the focal retailer’s store accessibility on store loyalty. Shopping costs 
will increase for consumers if the next closest shopping alternative for a specif-
ic product is located far from the focal retailer. Thus, when the distance be-
tween a retailer and its closest competitor is greater, the convenience and ac-
cessibility of the focal retailer’s store will be more important (both for multi-
purpose and comparison shopping tasks); thus, the focal retailer’s specific 
store location will serve as the base for consumer store loyalty. Therefore, 
consumers retrieve accessibility information rather than brand information 
when considering where to purchase if the next potential competitor is far 
away. This reasoning is supported by Clark and Rushton (1970), who found 
that distance and accessibility play a smaller role in the choice of a competitor 
if the competing store is located far from the focal store. These assumptions 
are also supported by gravitation theory. With growing geographic distance 
between a focal retailer and its competitors, the relevance of a store location 
assessment increases. However, retail brand equity continues to act as an im-
portant element of the gravitational force for stores; nevertheless, with growing 
distance among competitors, consumers who want to patronize a series of 
stores (for example, if they are engaging in multi-purpose or comparison 
shopping tasks) must consider the higher cost of shopping and thus focus 
more strongly on store accessibility.  
In turn, as already argued in the context of the effects of competitive intensity, 
if several shopping alternatives are nearby, then retail brand equity will be 
more important to consumer store choice (Craig, Ghosh, and McLafferty 1984) 
and thus to store loyalty. Accordingly, if the next competitor is nearby, then a 
consumer need not be concerned about the accessibility of a store and may 
then retrieve brand information to decide where to shop. Therefore, consumers 
retrieve brand information rather than accessibility information if the next com-
petitor is nearby. Consequently, the accessibility of a focal retailer increases in 
relevance with a larger distance to the next competitor. Therefore, retail brand 
equity will play a less important role in determining store loyalty and store ac-
cessibility. Thus, we present the following hypothesis: 

86 
Chapter C 
H6a. 
When there is greater distance between a focal retailer’s 
stores and its next closest competitor, store accessibility will 
have a greater influence on store loyalty.  
H6b. 
When there is greater distance between a focal retailer’s 
stores and its next closest competitor, retail brand equity will 
have a lower influence on store loyalty. 
H6c. 
When there is greater distance between a focal retailer’s 
stores and its next closest competitor, retail brand equity will 
have a lower influence on store accessibility.

Empirical Study 
3.1. 
Sample Design 
To analyze our hypotheses, we conducted a consumer survey. To develop the 
cross-sectional sample, we cooperated with a leading European chain store 
retailer in the home improvement and do-it-yourself (DIY) sector. This retailer 
has more than 250 stores located in suburban (downtown) areas and uses a 
standardized retail brand that is coordinated and communicated centrally. To 
ensure the independence of consumer perceptions with regard to the focal re-
tailer’s stores, we asked the chief marketing officer and area sales managers 
to suggest stores with varying degrees of productivity (in terms of rental space) 
in different cities across the country. We randomly chose 30 of the 60 cities 
that they proposed for the survey. We verified that specific promotional activi-
ties were not conducted during or one week prior to the data collection period. 
Following Verhoef et al. (2007), we created a sector-specific quota sampling 
method based on age and gender. Our aim was to interview 120-150 consum-
ers per city. The sample distribution of typical DIY consumers was provided by 
the independent national DIY organization.  
After the pre-tests were administered, the survey was conducted using a 
standardized questionnaire and face-to-face-interviews over the course of one 
week in each city, with approximately the same number of interviews conduct-
ed each day. This method was intended to prevent possible biases, as the 

Study 2: Retail Branding and Local Competition 
87 
number of customers and sales may differ depending on the day of the week. 
Every third person who passed the interviewers in the city centre and con-
formed to the sample was asked to participate (similar to Orth and Holancova 
2004). Each respondent was first asked to list the local DIY retailers with which 
he or she knew. Subsequently, the respondents were asked to describe the 
frequency with which they purchased from each of the retailers. Only the re-
spondents who knew of the focal retailer and had shopped at the particular 
store participated in the survey. The latter procedure was chosen to ensure 
that the conveniently accessible location was known to the consumers and be-
cause the pre-tests underscore the difficulties of consumers in evaluating the 
accessibility of stores that they have never visited before. Additionally, the first 
competitor that was mentioned (top of mind) by each respondent from which 
the respondent had purchased products was used as the second retailer to 
evaluate in this study. Thus, depending on the city, up to seven competitors 
are included in the survey. This procedure provided a total of 4,151 respond-
ents for an average of 138 respondents per city. The actual sample distribution 
satisfied the planned quota sample (see Table C–1).

Measurement 
All of the measurements of the latent constructs were based on previous stud-
ies (see Table C–2) and were obtained from a survey using 7-point Likert-type 
scales (from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). Following Teller and 
Reutterer (2008), we measured store accessibility using three items (speed, 
simplicity, and ease of access to a store). We measured retail brand equity 
according to the scale of Verhoef et al. (2007), who used four items (strong, 
well-known, favorable, and unique brand). Although retail brand equity is un-

88 
Chapter C 
derstood at a superior organizational level, the scale was measured at the 
store level, as other scholars have measured similar constructs (e.g., Jinfeng 
and Zhilong 2009; Arnold, Oum, and Tigert 1983; Jacoby and Mazursky 1984). 
Store loyalty is measured using three items in accordance with the research of 
Sirohi et al. (1998). The store accessibility and retail brand equity of competi-
tors were measured analogically. Specifically, we adapted the store accessibil-
ity measure using a single item with three components (quick, simple, and 
easy). The scales were pre-tested by conducting two consumer focus groups 
and by using a questionnaire in a single city (N = 170). The quantitative pre-
test provided satisfactory values for reliability and validity. The objective 
measures were based on previous studies and have been adapted to our retail 
sector. Competitive intensity (i.e., the number of competitors within a radius of 
two kilometers) and distance to the next competitor (in kilometers) were meas-
ured by following Talukdar et al. (2010). The choices were based on infor-
mation from the focal retailer’s sales managers on relevant competitor dis-
tances in the retail sector and were handled by the median split technique (for 
a similar method, see, e.g., Gauri, Sudhir, and Talukdar 2008). We differenti-
ated between low and high competitive intensity (2 and >2 competitors) and 
between short and long distance to the next competitor (2 and >2 kilometers). 
The information on the number of competitors and the relevant distances was 
provided by the managers and was double-checked using two commercial da-
tabases.  
We controlled for two groups of variables: consumer-related variables and in-
dividual-store variables. As the sector-specific sample structure does not fol-
low the general distribution of the base population and as consumer behavior 
may be influenced by gender (0 = male, 1 = female) and age (Schenk, Löffler, 
and Rauh 2007), we controlled for both variables. We also included a variable 
that describes the DIY ability as a covariate (self-reported on a four-point scale 
ranging from beginner to expert) based on the work of Pan and Zinkhan 
(2006), who suggest that personality traits, such as self-confidence, may influ-
ence store patronage. Finally, we controlled for four store location-related vari-
ables using binary covariates (0 = no, 1 = yes): closeness to a freeway; close-
ness to a national road (Kim and Choi 2007); closeness to a residential area 
(González-Benito, Muñoz-Gallego, and Kopalle 2005); and an agglomeration

(Fox, Postrel, and McLaughlin 2007), which is understood as the proximity of a 
DIY store to other types of retail stores. The data on store-related covariates 
were collected during the study.

Prior to the analysis of confirmatory and structural modeling, we tested for 
univariate normality with regard to kurtosis and skewness (Finch, West, and 
MacKinnon 1997) and multivariate normality using Mardia’s coefficient 
(Vlachopoulos 2008). All values indicated that the data are normally distribut-
ed. 
3.3. 
Method 
The methodical approach that was used was threefold. First, the measure-
ments were tested for reliability, validity, and possible biases. Second, the re-
quirements for multilevel modeling were checked. Third, the hypotheses were 
tested.  

90 
Chapter C 
To confirm the reliability of the measurements (see Table C–3), we ensured that 
the corrected item-to-total correlation was above .5 (Hair et al. 2006, p. 137). 
The threshold was not met for the well-known and uniqueness items of the retail 
brand constructs; thus, these items were excluded from further analysis. To as-
sess construct reliability, we computed Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliabil-
ity. These values exceed the recommended thresholds of .7 (Nunnally 1978, p. 
245) and .6 (Bagozzi and Yi 1988, p. 80), respectively. Face validity was as-
sessed using pre-tests. For construct validity, all of the factor loadings of the 
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were above .5 (Hair et al. 2006, p. 777), and 
the average variance extracted (AVE) values with a threshold of .5 provided 
support for convergent validity (Bagozzi and Yi 1988, p. 80).

We also tested the five latent constructs for discriminant validity (Fornell and 
Larcker 1981, p. 46). As all of the squared correlations were smaller than the 
two respective AVE values, discriminant validity is confirmed (see Table C–4). 
Finally, the fit values for the confirmatory model were satisfactory (Hu and 
Bentler 1999; Browne and Cudeck 1992; Hair et al. 2006) (CFI .956; TLI .930; 
RMSEA .075; SRMR .032; F²(35) = 854.279), despite the F²/df value (Hinkin 
1995). As the latter is dependent on sample size, a value beyond the recom-
mended threshold can be considered acceptable (Wheaton 1987, p. 128; Kline 
2011, p. 204). The probability of non-response bias was controlled only by the 
selection procedure during the data collection process. Regarding common 
method bias we used an appropriate questionnaire design a priori and em-
ployed a successful single-factor test using a confirmatory factor analysis 
(Podsakoff et al. 2003) a posteriori. The model with all items loading on a single 
factor (CFI .625; TLI .532; RMSEA .195; SRMR .119; F²(44) = 6972.673) 
showed significantly poorer fit values in comparison with our model 
(ǻF²(9) = 6,118.394, p < .000). Thus, we can assume that common method bi-
as is reduced within our sample.

Because the data have a hierarchical structure (the consumers are nested 
within the 30 stores), we tested for the requirements of multilevel modeling 
(Wagner et al. 2006) and found small intra-class correlations for all of the 
items (under .038). However, as the variance of our dependent variable was 
not significant among the stores, there is no significant variation in consumer 
perceptions among the stores. Therefore, we did not test the hypotheses with 
multi-level modeling, as no additional explanation of variance can be provided. 

92 
Chapter C 
To test H1 to H4, we applied a structural equation model using a robust max-
imum likelihood estimation (MLR) with Mplus, which showed satisfactory 
global fit values for the proposed model (CFI .937; TLI .911; RMSEA .051; 
SRMR .033; F²(94) = 1,128.450). Additionally, we calculated two rival models. 
Retail brand equity may be affected by store accessibility, and the retail brand 
equity of competitors could be influenced by their store accessibility. Applying 
retail brand equity as a mediator rather than store accessibility resulted in poor-
er fit values (CFI .930; TLI .902; RMSEA .049; SRMR .035; F²(94) = 1,239.394; 
ǻF²(0) = 110.944, ǻBIC = 132.482). We further calculated a nested model 
without effect between retail brand equity and store accessibility (model with-
out mediating effects). The fit measures of this second model were significant-
ly poorer than those of the proposed model (CFI .893; TLI .853; RMSEA .066; 
SRMR .069; F²(96) = 1,848.237; ǻF²(2) = 719.787, p < .001). These results 
supported the proposed model. 
To test H5 and H6, we applied two multiple group analyses (using the median 
split technique (Gauri, Sudhir, and Talukdar 2008)) and considered unstand-
ardized structural coefficients (Singh 1995). We conducted a test of measure-
ment invariance to assess the measurement equivalence among the consid-
ered groups (Cheung and Rensvold 2002) (i.e., between low and high competi-
tive intensity and between short and long distance to the next competitor). The 
results indicated the good fit of the confirmatory models (Chen et al. 2008; Hu 
and Bentler 1999, p. 27). Additionally, the findings showed that partial scalar 
invariance holds for all of the constructs and groups (see Table C–5). The de-
rived partial invariance models of both moderators (competitive intensity and 
distance to the next competitors) are used in the subsequent analyses of hy-
pothesis testing. The global fit measures for the calculated multiple group struc-
tural equation models, which consider the moderating effects of competitive 
intensity (CFI .932; TLI .909; RMSEA .052; SRMR .037; F²(196) = 1,316.823) 
and distance to the next competitor (CFI .929; TLI .905; RMSEA .054; 
SRMR .040; F²(197) = 1,372.049), were satisfactory.

Results 
Because retail brand equity (.634, p < .001) and store accessibility (.361, 
p < .001) have positive and significant effects on store loyalty towards the focal 
retailer (see Table C–6), H1a and H1b are supported. Accordingly, both the 
retail brand equity of competitors (-.226, p < .001) and their store accessibility 
(-.034, p < .05) have negative significant effects on store loyalty towards the 
focal retailer. This finding supports H2a and H2b. H3a and H3b are also sup-

94

ported because retail brand equity has a positive significant effect on store ac-
cessibility (.390, p < .001), and the retail brand equity of competitors has a sig-
nificant positive effect on their store accessibility (.268, p < .001). Furthermore, 
the indirect effect of retail brand equity on store loyalty is positive (.141, 
p < .001) (Sobel 1987), and the indirect effect of the retail brand equity of 
competitors on store loyalty is negative (-.009, p < .01).

Regarding the strength of the effects on store loyalty, H4a and H4b are sup-
ported. The retail brand equity of the focal retailer has a more positive and di-
rect effect on its store loyalty (.634, p < .001) than does its store accessibility 
(.361, p < .001). This finding supports H4a. As the retail brand equity of com-
petitors (-.226, p < .001) has a more negative and direct effect on store loyalty 

Study 2: Retail Branding and Local Competition 
95 
towards the focal retailer than the store accessibility of competitors (-.034, 
p < .05) does, H4b is also supported. Thus, from the consumer perspective, 
store loyalty is primarily determined by the retail brand equity of the focal re-
tailer and its competitors’ rather than by the accessibility of stores.  
With regard to the control variables, gender (.039, p < .01), DIY abilities (.061, 
p < .001), and closeness to a national road (.036, p < .01) significantly affect 
store loyalty. Thus, store loyalty is more positive for women, consumers who 
are experts in DIY, and stores that are close to a national road. The greater 
loyalty of women to the focal retailer’s store is noteworthy. This finding may 
result from the less pronounced DIY experiences and abilities of women and, 
therefore, their diminished seeking behavior. However, a higher level of expe-
rience (DIY experts) also positively supports loyalty. 
With respect to the objective competitive data concerning the effects for the 
focal retailer, the hypotheses are partly supported (see Table C–7). A high 
level of competitive intensity significantly decreases the effect of store acces-
sibility on store loyalty (from .323, p < .001 for low competitive intensity to .228, 
p < .001 for high competitive intensity). This finding supports H5a. Thus, the 
store accessibility of the focal retailer is less important for securing the store 
loyalty of consumers if there are more shopping alternatives in an area. How-
ever, H5b and H5c are not supported. Thus, for the focal retailer’s stores with 
high competitive intensity, there were no increases in the positive influences of 
retail brand equity on store loyalty or on store accessibility. A great distance to 
a retailer’s next competitor significantly increases the effect of store accessibil-
ity on store loyalty (from .240, p < .001 for a short distance to the next competi-
tor to .306, p < .001 for a long distance to the next competitor) and significantly 
decreases the effect of retail brand equity on store loyalty (from 1.035, 
p < .001 for a short distance to the next competitor to .769, p < .001 for a long 
distance to the next competitor). These findings support H6a and H6b. Thus, 
when the distance to the next shopping alternative for a specific product is 
greater, store accessibility is more important, and retail brand equity is less 
important for securing consumers’ store loyalty towards the focal retailer. 
However, H6c is not supported. Thus, for the focal retailer’s stores with longer 
distances to the next competitor, the positive influence of retail brand equity on 
store accessibility does not decrease.

Study 2: Retail Branding and Local Competition

4. 
Discussion and Conclusions 
4.1. 
Summary of Findings 
In this study, we examine whether retail brand equity or store accessibility 
have a greater effect on store loyalty and how these effects are determined 
through local competition (both the subjective perceptions and objective char-
acteristics of local competitors). This under-researched area is relevant be-
cause retailers view location as a core success factor, whereas studies indi-
cate that location is declining in relevance (e.g., Bell, Ho, and Tang 1998) and 
that strong branding is becoming increasingly important (Grewal, Levy, and 
Lehmann 2004; Ailawadi and Keller 2004). With respect to schema theory, the 
results strongly support the argument that both a strong brand and a conven-
ient, accessible store location determine the store loyalty of consumers’, that 
retail brand has a stronger effect on store loyalty than store accessibility, and, 
furthermore, that a strong retail brand strengthens perceptions of location. 
Moreover, the strength of the effects of a focal retailer’s brand and the acces-
sibility of its stores on store loyalty is dependent on the competitive situation. 
The results differ substantially when an objective competitor’s intensity and the 
distance to the next competitor are considered. Furthermore, the loyalty to a 
focal retailer is negatively influenced by the brand strength and location acces-
sibility of the retailer’s local competitors. These observations allow for three 
major theoretical implications and conclusions for managers.  
4.2. 
Theoretical Implications 
With respect to our first research question, which asks whether the retail brand 
equity or store accessibility of a focal retailer offers a greater contribution to 
store loyalty towards a focal retailer, the results show that retail brand equity 
(.634) influences store loyalty towards the focal retailer more strongly than 
store accessibility (.361) does. We will now discuss two conclusions in greater 
depth. 
First, we can conclude that a strong retail brand drives store loyalty almost 
twice as strongly as a convenient store location does; this result corresponds 
to the research of James et al. (1976), who found that a strong retail brand can 
be used to overcome the uncertainties that result from growing local competi-

98 
Chapter C 
tion. This conclusion also supports the findings of Clark and Rushton (1970) 
and their proposition regarding the gravitational pull of a strong retail brand.  
Second, convenient and accessible store locations positively influence loyalty, 
even during periods of high mobility. However, a strong brand induces cus-
tomers to drive longer distances to reach stores and thus positively influences 
store accessibility. The effect of retail brand equity on store accessibility is reli-
able, as this outcome was observed for both the focal retailer (.385) and the 
competitors (.390). This finding both underlines the importance of the relation-
ship between brand and location and supports the conceptualizations of 
Grewal et al. (2004; 2009), who found that a retail brand affects perceptions of 
retail attributes, including location. The alternative model, in which location de-
termines retail brand equity, shows weaker results. Moreover, we do not find 
hierarchical effects among the focal retailer’s 30 stores with regard to the store 
loyalty of consumers, but significant differences among certain groups of 
stores may exist. Thus, further research could, for example, investigate the 
effects with respect to focal retailer store groups with low or high levels of store 
loyalty. 
With respect to our second research question regarding the extent to which 
the retail brand equity and store accessibility of competitors affect store loyalty 
towards a focal retailer, we find that the retail brand equity of competitors influ-
ences store loyalty towards the focal retailer more negatively than the store 
accessibility of competitors does. Thus, we conclude that the stronger effect of 
retail brand equity is also stable, as this effect occurred for the brand equity of 
both the focal retailer and the competitors. Furthermore, we note that a deeper 
understanding of consumer behavior can be obtained if the perceptions of lo-
cal retailers (both a focal retailer and its competitors) are viewed separately 
rather than in comparison with one another (Hartman and Spiro 2005). 
In response to our third research question, the objective characteristics of local 
competition influence the effects of retail brand equity and store accessibility 
on store loyalty towards the focal retailer, we discuss two major conclusions 
below. 
First, a long distance to the next competitor increases the importance of store 
accessibility as a driver of the store loyalty of consumers but decreases the 

Study 2: Retail Branding and Local Competition 
99 
importance of retail brand equity (see the calls of Peterson and Balasub- 
ramanian 2002; and Grewal, Levy, and Kumar 2009). The data provide similar 
results for a situation characterized by low competitive intensity. The enhanced 
importance of store locations in both situations of low competitive intensity and 
situations of great distance to the next competitor clearly indicates the conven-
ience orientation of consumers (i.e., they are more loyal to a convenient, ac-
cessible retailer and prefer not to drive greater distances). However, retailers 
should not rely solely on accessible store locations as a competitive advantage 
because a competitor could build a new store nearby. Thus, a retailer should 
not neglect necessary investments in its own stores, particularly investments in 
building a strong retail brand, because retail brand equity is still a strong de-
terminant of the store loyalty of customers. 
Second, we found that retail brand equity is the primary driver of store loyalty 
in all objective competitive situations. However, in different competitive situa-
tions, the direct effects of retail brand equity on store loyalty vary significantly, 
although the supporting effects on store accessibility are stable in all situa-
tions. Thus, this supporting effect on store accessibility does not depend on 
competition. Hence, retail brand equity may always support perceptions of lo-
cal stores, the accessibility of store locations and other store attributes. We 
can conclude that a strong retail brand is the primary attraction for consumers 
(Craig, Ghosh, and McLafferty 1984). 
4.3. 
Managerial Implications 
This study provides managerial implications by highlighting the differing effects 
of retail brand equity and store accessibility on store loyalty in varying competi-
tive situations. In practice, although expansion managers spend a significant 
amount of time searching for favorable store locations, consumer perceptions 
of retail brand equity always drive consumer behavior more strongly than store 
accessibility does. Thus, although a convenient store location is still a relevant 
driver of long-term success (Ghosh and Craig 1983), a retail brand is more im-
portant for store loyalty and, in turn, retailer success. Consequently, a retail 
brand is an appropriate asset that acts as a competitive advantage in situa-
tions of intensifying competition (James, Durand, and Dreves 1976).  

100 
Chapter C 
However, we believe that not all retailers devote adequate attention to this 
fact. Consequently, unlike well-known brand manufacturers, fewer retailers are 
providing professional retail brand management. Of course, retail branding is 
more complex (Ailawadi and Keller 2004), highly frequented locations are ex-
pensive, and “the disadvantages of a poor location are extremely difficult to 
overcome” (Craig, Ghosh, and McLafferty 1984, p. 5). However, the favorabil-
ity of easily accessible locations (especially locations in which the next com-
petitor is far away) can easily be diminished by the new store openings of a 
competitor. Thus, chain store retailers will profit from a strong and centrally 
managed retail brand. 
 
5. 
Limitations and Further Research 
A better understanding of the effects of retail brand equity and convenient, ac-
cessible store locations on consumer behavior requires further research be-
cause of the limitations of the current study. 
Because we collected data from one retail sector (from the self-selected loca-
tions of only one focal retailer without standardized store layouts and from its 
local competitors), this study is limited in scope. Broadening the database 
would mitigate these limitations and allow for further conclusions. For example, 
the actual distances from customer homes or offices to an evaluated store 
could be studied (Gauri, Trivedi, and Grewal 2008) because it would be 
worthwhile to analyze whether store accessibility or real distances influence 
store loyalty towards a focal retailer in different ways. In addition, we were 
obliged to employ a reduced version of the scale developed by Verhoef et al. 
(2007) for retail brand equity; thus, the validity of this study may be limited. 
Methodologically, a dataset that allows for a multilevel analysis would enable 
the direct use of objective variables rather than a multiple group analysis and 
the inclusion of further measures for each observed store (e.g., financial per-
formance). Furthermore, this study focused on only one facet of store location 
(namely, its convenient accessibility) and on retailers within the same type of 
business. Thus, further analysis can extend these conclusions by, for example, 
considering a more general view, such as the attractiveness of a location, or 
focusing on the effects by means of agglomerations with retailers in other sec-

Study 2: Retail Branding and Local Competition 
101 
tors or nearby shopping centers (Teller and Reutterer 2008). Such analyses 
may assist in differentiating between the reduced and compensated effects of 
location on consumer behavior. Finally, our results may indicate a type of re-
ciprocal relationship between retail brand equity and store location. Addressing 
such bidirectional relationships, which are seldom analyzed in retailing, may 
be advantageous in further research (for methodological issues, see, e.g., 
Nguyen and Leblanc 2001; Kwon and Lennon 2009). However, we believe that 
the dominance of retail brand equity will persist. 
Regarding future research, a high priority should be given to the inclusion of 
additional variables concerning consumer behavior, such as store and brand 
familiarity, because both determine the information processing in memory 
(Cowley and Mitchell 2003; Inman, Winer, and Ferraro 2009; Benedicktus et 
al. 2010) or self-confidence (see the call of Schenk, Löffler, and Rauh 2007; 
and Pan and Zinkhan 2006, which mention self-confidence as an important but 
less observed factor in this context). In conjunction with the chosen sector, 
self-reported DIY abilities as a sector-specific proxy for self-confidence may be 
an interesting topic to research, as the results of the corresponding control var-
iable are positively significant in all of the analyzed models.

Study 3: International Transfer and Perception of Retail 
Formats: A Comparison Study in Germany and Romania 
 
1. 
Introduction 
Retailers have been engaging in aggressive internationalization, first into 
developed countries and then into emerging countries (Swoboda, Zentes, and 
Elsner 2009). In particular, grocery retailers adapt their offers abroad (Gamble 
2010; Goldman 2001) to position their chains as strong brands in the minds of 
consumers. However, retailers primarily use preferred formats for global 
expansion. For example, German Aldi engages in expansion abroad using its 
discount format, and French Carrefour prefers to expand using its strongest 
format, the hypermarket. Retail formats represent a retailer’s product mix, 
constitute competing categories that are designed to match the needs of 
consumers (González-Benito, Muñoz-Gallego, and Kopalle 2005), and are 
considered generic positioning profiles (Dawson 2000). These profiles are 
based on format characteristics known as core attributes, such as low prices in 
the case of discounters or broad assortments in the case of hypermarkets 
(Tordjman 1994). Retailer expansion occurs within the boundaries of these 
core attributes, and these boundaries determine transfer decisions. Thus, 
adaptation is determined by the international strategy and environment within 
a country as well as the chosen format. Therefore, we believe that core 
attributes equally determine the retail brand positioning of a specific format in 
foreign markets. If this assumption is upheld by empirical evidence, then retail 
internationalization indeed occurs with the strong adaptation of offers but 
within the boundaries of core attributes that determine consumer perceptions. 
This issue is relevant for the understanding of retailer behavior in transferring 
offers abroad and particularly for the understanding of consumer preferences 
and the market success of retailers. 
Past research has shown that from a strategic perspective, retailers transfer 
store attributes differently, some of which are adapted and some of which are 
standardized (Goldman 2001), and that successful grocery retailers realize 
high degrees of local responsiveness (Swoboda, Elsner, and Morschett 2012). 
However, researchers have also found that successful retailers tend to use a

format for international expansion that is familiar to them, that determines local 
positioning, and that is innovative for local customers (Etgar and Rachman-
Moore 2008; Gielens and Dekimpe 2001). From the demand perspective, retail 
store attributes are known to be essential for customer store choices in spatial 
competition (for an overview, see Cleeren et al. 2010) and for store image (for 
an overview, see Chowdhury, Reardon, and Srivastava 1998). Combining the 
strategic and consumer perspectives, Burt and Mavrommatis (2006), argued 
that the positioning of a retail chain is similar across countries, whereas the 
perceptions of retailers vary. However, these findings do not describe the role 
that core format attributes play in retail brand building, which is an important 
determining factor of local consumer response (Pan and Zinkhan 2006; Finn 
and Louviere 1996). For retailers that transfer preferred formats to host 
countries but are forced to be locally responsible, knowledge regarding the 
role of core format attributes in brand positioning is important, as their role may 
differ from the host country context, particularly in emerging, distant countries 
(Evans and Mavondo 2002), and different consumer perceptions may 
jeopardize market success.  
Thus, the aim of this study is to analyze the following research questions. Are 
the core attributes of a particular retail format perceived similarly by customers 
in developed and emerging countries? Do the core attributes determine the 
retail brand equity equally within a specific format in both developed and 
emerging countries? 
Two contributions are offered to the current literature. First, we conceptualize 
the relationship between core attributes and retail brand equity as well as store 
loyalty (referring to the calls of Peterson and Balasubramanian (2002) and 
Puccinelli et al. (2009)) by investigating the effects of the core attributes of a 
format in a comparison of Germany (a developed country) and Romania (an 
emerging European country dominated by western European retailers). Prior 
research has provided information on the format transfer and image of retailers 
in host countries but has largely neglected discussing the role of core 
attributes in the positioning of strong retail brands to further our understanding 
of consumer responses to retail formats in emerging and developed countries. 
Second, studying the relationships between core attributes and retailers as 
strong brands in developed and emerging countries, we explore beyond the 

Study 3: International Transfer and Perception of Retail Formats 
105 
argument of whether the adaptation or replication of the core attributes of 
retailers is relevant for format success. We also contribute to the scant 
literature on the foreign market servicing of service firms. The core attributes 
that are examined in this study are specifically tailored to the characteristics of 
traditional retail formats, discounters, supermarkets, and hypermarkets. 
However, although these core attributes are commonly used in retailing, they 
are not exclusive to this sector. Hence, we consider an alternative rationale 
that is discussed in this study to be applicable to certain service firms, and we 
believe that our findings may be relevant for future studies that address the 
transfer of core attributes to a business model abroad. 
In the following section, we first address relevant research streams and derive 
hypotheses regarding the perceptions of core attributes and their effects on 
retail branding to form the basis for two empirical studies of traditional grocery 
formats in Germany and Romania. Subsequently, the results are discussed. 
Finally, the paper concludes by discussing limitations and directions for further 
research. 
 
2. 
Retail Format Transfer and Perception 
International retailers differ considerably from most international manufacturers 
(for differences regarding management, marketing and finance, see Currah 
and Wrigley (2004) and Dawson (1994)). In particular, grocery retailing is the 
largest retail sector, is regarded as multi-domestic, employs international 
strategies with direct, frequent contact with consumers and with high local 
responsiveness (Bianchi and Ostale 2006; Swoboda, Elsner, and Morschett 
2012), transfers retail formats from a home country to a host country (Goldman 
2001), and balances centralized and decentralized decision making (Dawson 
1994). Relatively high levels of investments are required for the inter- 
nationalization of grocery retailers, such as investments in the development of 
store networks and local supply chain processes (Swoboda, Foscht, and 
Cliquet 2008) that represent a high ratio of total retail costs (Einarsson 2008) 
and that are specific to a particular format (e.g., tight in the case of dis- 
counters). Finally, formats are retail products that are offered in a relatively 
homogeneous store network and offer a range of retail-specific marketing-mix 

106 
Chapter D 
instruments, such as assortment, store layout, or location (Currah and Wrigley 
2004). Two relatively unconnected streams of research are relevant for our 
study: a strategic perspective of format transfer and a consumer perspective of 
format perception. 
The transfer of retail formats is linked to combinations of market offers and 
retail knowledge (i.e., processes and firm culture) (Hollander 1970; Kacker 
1985; Kacker 1988), whereas market offers determine consumer responses 
and market success. These offers have been analyzed in several ways: first, 
by comparing foreign and domestic retailers (Goldman 2000); second, by 
demonstrating that international retailers vary their market offers over time 
because of market-based learning (Segal-Horn and Davison 1992; Jonsson 
and Foss 2011); and third, by focusing on the degrees of standardization and 
adaptation of various retail attributes, such as prices and assortments (e.g., 
Fam and Yang 2006; Wigley and Chiang 2009). However, small-N research 
has particularly emphasized that the adaptation of offers is critical for retailer 
success abroad (e.g., Currah and Wrigley 2004; Bianchi and Ostale 2006; 
Evans, Mavondo, and Bridson 2008). Few scholars have shown that some 
elements of a format are transferred in an adapted form, whereas other 
elements are transferred unchanged (e.g., McGoldrick 1998; Goldman 2001; 
Huang and Sternquist 2009). Brown and Burt (1992) and Segal-Horn and 
Davison (1992) have argued that retailers can standardize some instruments 
relatively easily (e.g., store layout), whereas other instruments must be 
adapted (e.g., assortment). We add to this argument and assume that the 
transfer of certain store attributes is related to a particular retail format in that 
the adaptation of retail attributes proceeds within the boundaries of a specific 
format and its core attributes. 
Consumer perceptions of or preferences for retail formats are analyzed by 
scholars focusing on inter- and/or intra-format spatial competition (e.g., Bell, 
Ho, and Tang 1998; Bhatnagar and Ratchford 2004; Popkowski Leszczyc, 
Sinha, and Sahgal 2004; Singh, Hansen, and Blattberg 2006; Gijsbrechts, 
Campo, and Nisol 2008; Cleeren et al. 2010). For example, such studies 
provide comparisons between consumer store choices of supermarkets, 
hypermarkets, and discounters based on attributes that include assortment, 
service, and price (e.g., Solgaard and Hansen 2003) or provide positioning 

Study 3: International Transfer and Perception of Retail Formats

options for retailers using price, convenience, and quality (Morschett, 
Swoboda, and Schramm-Klein 2006). Scholars observing different countries 
have addressed consumer expectations of retail attributes in Europe (White 
and Absher 2007) and in Asia (McGoldrick and Ho 1992; Chaney and Gamble 
2008) and the positioning of domestic and foreign retailers or formats, such as 
discounters within a country (Newman and Patel 2004; Denstadli, Lines, and 
Grønhaug 2005). Few studies have conducted cross-country comparisons. 
Two studies examined customer perceptions of the retailer Marks & Spencer 
in France and Spain (McGoldrick 1998) and in the UK and Spain (Burt and 
Carralero-Encinas 2000). These studies revealed differences and similarities 
in perceptions and concluded that these factors must be managed and 
considered when operating in those markets. Burt and Mavrommatis (2006) 
considered the perceptions of the store image of a chain and found that the 
image of discounters differs between Spain and Greece but that the position of 
a chain is equal if local competitors are considered. These studies share the 
view that there exists a need for adaptation and thus for the analysis of 
consumer expectations and perceptions in foreign countries. However, these 
studies frequently focused on one specific retail chain or format and con- 
sidered only developed countries. 
In sum, two research gaps emerge: the adaptation of core attributes abroad is 
assumed to occur within the boundary conditions of those attributes that are 
characteristic of a format. These attributes are rooted in spatial competition 
research, for example, as the core attributes of a format are especially 
important for success in inter-format competition. However, there is a lack of 
knowledge on the nature of core attributes in developed western European 
markets and in emerging eastern European markets. Both types of countries 
are important; for example, western European retailers prefer to expand from 
their saturated home markets into eastern European countries much more 
frequently than into Asian countries. Second, studies on the positioning of 
retailers across countries have not answered the question of how these 
attributes (apart from the perceptions of such attributes) determine retailer 
positioning and success abroad. In other words, which of these store attributes 
strengthen the ability of retailers to build strong retail brands and to enhance 
consumer patronage?

Conceptualization and Hypothesis Development 
The basic conceptual model (see Figure D–1) draws from the stimulus-
organism-response (S-O-R) framework (Russell and Mehrabian 1976; Thang 
and Tan 2003), in that consumer perceptions of specific retail attributes (stimu-
lus) influence retail brand equity (organism) that in turn influences customer’s 
store loyalty (response). With respect to schema theoretical reasoning and as-
sociative network theory consumers refer to different information that are acti-
vated in memory (considering spreading activation please refer to Anderson 
1983) when they have to decide where to (re)purchase (Marshall 1995). As not 
only abstract retail brand related information come into customers mind facing 
such a decision, but also concrete store relevant information emergence, cus-
tomer perceptions of retail attributes do also have an influence for store loyal-
ty. Thus, our basic conceptual model comprises three constructs: retail attrib- 
utes, retail brand equity, and store loyalty. Retail attributes, or marketing 
instruments, are known to represent the position of a retail company and a 
retail format in the minds of consumers (Martineau 1958a). These attributes 
are frequently conceptualized as antecedents of retail brand equity (Yoo, 
Donthu, and Lee 2000; Ailawadi and Keller 2004; Jinfeng and Zhilong 2009), 
as are the effects of retail brand equity on store loyalty (Pan and Zinkhan 
2006; Finn and Louviere 1996). Thus, our basic conceptual model is based on 
previous research. However, we conceptualize the relationship between retail 
attributes, retail brand and store loyalty for three formats by comparing two 
countries (see Figure D–1). The underlying reasoning is that core attributes 
characterize consumer perceptions of formats, especially in contexts of inter-
format competition (Cleeren et al. 2010) and that core attributes determine the 
retail brand building process in both developed and emerging countries. If 
such a mechanism is sustainable, then the core attributes of a particular 
format should be equally relevant for establishing a strong retail brand in 
developed and emerging countries. 
In the following, the perceptions of format-specific attributes are concep- 
tualized, followed by the conceptualization of format-specific attributes in de- 
termining retail brand equity within a specific retail format. Finally, the influence 
of retail brand equity on store loyalty is conceptualized. The underlying as- 
sumptions are that the perceptions of each format will be similar in developed 

Study 3: International Transfer and Perception of Retail Formats

and emerging countries and that similar attributes determine the position of a 
format as a strong retail brand in both types of countries.

3.1. 
Perceptions of Format-specific Attributes 
Retail attributes refer to the marketing instruments that retailers use to design 
market offers and influence consumers (e.g., McGoldrick 1998; Burt and 
Mavrommatis 2006). Various attribute inventories have been used to charac- 
terize image dimensions of retail chains or retail firms (e.g., Martineau 1958a; 
Fisk 1961; Steenkamp and Wedel 1991; Chowdhury, Reardon, and Srivastava 
1998), to characterize antecedents of retail brand equity (Jinfeng and Zhilong 
2009; Ailawadi and Keller 2004; Yoo, Donthu, and Lee 2000), or to charac- 
terize retail formats in spatial competition (Bhatnagar and Ratchford 2004; 
Cleeren et al. 2010; Levy and Weitz 2012). To characterize formats in spatial 
competition, researchers have primarily focused on price (high vs. low) and 
assortment choice (limited vs. extended) (González-Benito 2001; see also 
Tordjman 1994; Burt and Sparks 1995), although other studies have also 
analyzed other attributes and added single attributes, such as store size, 
service, or location (Zielke 2010; Solgaard and Hansen 2003; Cleeren et al. 
2010; Fox and Sethuraman 2010). Because these variables are highly sub- 
jective, the literature lacks a standardized definition (González-Benito 2005); 
furthermore, other attributes, such as store layout and communication, are 
also relevant to consumer preferences for stores with an appealing atmos- 
phere or informative promotions. Research on store image has often dif- 
ferentiated a broad range of attributes, such as location, assortment, price,

service, store layout, and communication. Each of these attributes is known to 
determine consumer behavior (e.g., Seiders, Simonides, and Tigert 2000; 
Oppewal and Koelemeijer 2005; Binkley and Bejnarowicz 2003; Siu and Chow 
2004; Vrechopoulos et al. 2004; Gedenk and Neslin 2000). Arguing that this 
broader range of attributes determines consumer perceptions of a particular 
format, we conceptualize the core attributes of discounters, supermarkets, and 
hypermarkets below. 
European discounters with roots in Germany are frequently characterized by 
everyday low pricing, limited product choice (Tordjman 1994; Burt and Sparks 
1995; González-Benito 2005), and small stores with functional environments 
and no services (Zielke 2010; Cleeren et al. 2010; Solgaard and Hansen 2003). 
From a consumer perspective, the core attribute characterizing discounters as 
distinct from other formats is low pricing. Furthermore, Cleeren et al. (2010) 
recently noted that discounters tend to locate their stores near consumers and 
increasingly offer convenient and accessible locations within their broadly 
increasing store networks (Morschett, Swoboda, and Schramm-Klein 2006). 
However, because low prices represent the relevant characteristic of discount 
formats, retail firms will persist in using relatively low prices when transferring 
discount formats abroad; therefore, consumer perceptions should also be linked 
to low pricing as a core attribute of discounters across countries. Therefore, this 
study posits that the price as a core attribute will be internationally adapted but 
in relation to the prices of local competitors; thus, the price perceptions of 
discounters in developed and emerging countries should be dominant and 
perhaps equally perceived in developed and emerging countries. 
European supermarkets are frequently viewed as having average prices (high-
low pricing) with an average assortment size (Tordjman 1994; Burt and Sparks 
1995; González-Benito 2005; Cleeren et al. 2010). This description also holds 
for the characterization of supermarkets in the U.S., in which supermarkets also 
present a pleasant store atmosphere and a modest service offering and operate 
as medium-sized stores in comparison with discounters or hypermarkets (Levy 
and Weitz 2012; González-Benito 2005). Supermarket retailers use broad store 
networks to ensure convenient store access for customers. Thus, the core 
attributes of supermarkets are easily accessible locations, large assortments 
(considering assortment breadth) and some services (Solgaard and Hansen 

Study 3: International Transfer and Perception of Retail Formats 
111 
2003). If these three attributes are relevant characteristics of supermarket 
formats, then retail firms that expand their supermarket format abroad will 
persist in using relatively broad and fresh assortments, convenient locations, 
and service skills to assure their positioning in an inter-format competition 
context abroad. We posit that the core attributes of location, assortment, and 
service may be adapted but are preferably used to determine the perceptions of 
supermarket chains in developed countries and emerging countries. 
European hypermarkets, which have roots in France (Levy and Weitz 2012), 
have a price range that falls between those of discounters and supermarkets 
and offer an extended choice of products because of their large assortment 
size (considering breadth and depth) in large stores and car-oriented locations 
(Tordjman 1994; Burt and Sparks 1995; González-Benito 2005; Cleeren et al. 
2010; Solgaard and Hansen 2003). The store layout of hypermarkets is 
sometimes experience oriented (Floch 1988). Similar descriptions also exist for 
the characterization of supercenters in the U.S. (Levy and Weitz 2012), which 
are larger and less experience oriented. However, the core format attributes 
include a large assortment, which allows for one-stop shopping (Morschett, 
Swoboda, and Schramm-Klein 2006); large store size, which allows for an 
experience-oriented layout (Floch 1988) or an appealing store atmosphere 
(Levy and Weitz 2012); and services, which could be regarded as broader than 
those of supermarkets as a result of the specialized stores and services units 
within a hypermarket store. If these attributes are relevant characteristics of 
hypermarket formats, then retail firms that expand their hypermarket format 
abroad will persist in using those attributes to influence consumer perceptions 
concerning broad assortment, store layout, and service. These core attributes 
may be adapted, but they should be characteristically linked with the perception 
of hypermarkets in both developed countries and emerging countries.  
These arguments lead us to develop the following hypothesis: 
H1. 
Consumer perceptions of core format attributes do not 
differ between emerging and developed countries for the 
following attributes: (a) price for discounters; (b) assort- 
ment, location, and service for supermarkets; and (c) 
assortment, store layout, and service for hypermarkets.

3.2. 
Format-specific Attributes as Antecedents of Retail Brand Equity 
We define retail brand equity as the associations of a retailer with a strong, 
unique, and attractive retail chain or retail brand in the mind of consumers 
(Verhoef, Langerak, and Donkers 2007, p. 100). Retail brand equity refers to 
the chain level of a retailer (Burt and Davies 2010) and thus corresponds to 
the ‘Gestalt view’ of a retail chain or format as a brand (Keaveney and Hunt 
1992). This concept differs from Martineau’s (1958a) understanding of store 
image as a sum of store-level associations (Ailawadi and Keller 2004) and 
from store attractiveness in spatial competition research, which is often used 
referring to store size (Nakanishi and Cooper 1974; Craig, Ghosh, and 
McLafferty 1984; González-Benito 2005). Scholars have conceptualized the 
role of retail brand equity in consumer perceptions of various values offered by 
a retail chain (Grewal, Levy, and Lehmann 2004; Grewal and Levy 2009), and 
store attributes are known as antecedents to retail brand equity (Yoo, Donthu, 
and Lee 2000; Ailawadi and Keller 2004; Jinfeng and Zhilong 2009). Because 
it is important for foreign retailers to establish their chains and stores as strong 
brands in foreign countries, it is appropriate to refer to retail brand equity when 
considering a format-specific perspective. A strong retail brand allows retailers 
to expand their store networks, strengthen intangible assets and performance 
(Jinfeng and Zhilong 2009; Brown et al. 2006), and attract consumers (e.g., 
Nguyen and Leblanc 2001). However, we acknowledge that differences 
between strong, unique, and attractive brands exist within particular formats 
(e.g., between Auchan and Carrefour as two hypermarket formats), although 
these differences are not considered in this study. Rather, we assume that the 
core attributes of particular formats determine retail brands within this specific 
format similarly in developed and emerging countries. 
The strength, uniqueness, and attractiveness of the discount format is likely to 
be primarily based on price as the core attribute of this particular format 
(González-Benito 2005; Solgaard and Hansen 2003). Further attributes, such 
as assortment, store layout (Cleeren et al. 2010; Solgaard and Hansen 2003) 
and location (Morschett, Swoboda, and Schramm-Klein 2006; Cleeren et al. 
2010), may or may not affect retail brand equity within the discount format in 
developed and emerging countries. As noted previously, growing store net- 
works in home markets bring discounters closer to customers (Morschett, 

Study 3: International Transfer and Perception of Retail Formats 
113 
Swoboda, and Schramm-Klein 2006; Cleeren et al. 2010), and discounter 
locations may increasingly explain the preferred store choices of customers 
(Fox and Sethuraman 2010). However, although communication is viewed as 
contributing to enhancing retail brands (Sjödin and Törn 2006) and both 
location and communication are gaining importance for discounters, they are 
currently not regarded as core attributes in determining the retail brand equity 
of discount chains. Thus, we conclude that retail brands within the discount 
format are largely determined by the core attribute of price in both developed 
and emerging countries. 
With respect to brand building retail attributes for supermarkets, it is con- 
ceivable that the core attributes of service, location and assortment will 
strongly determine retail brand equity within supermarkets. The service and 
merchandise quality of supermarkets are known to influence store loyalty 
intentions toward supermarket chains (e.g., Sirohi, McLaughlin, and Wittink 
1998), and convenient accessible store locations are known to influence 
customer store choices and are relevant in format competition (Solgaard and 
Hansen 2003; Morschett, Swoboda, and Schramm-Klein 2006; Cleeren et al. 
2010; Fox and Sethuraman 2010). In contrast, because the pricing (Solgaard 
and Hansen 2003; Cleeren et al. 2010), store layout, and communication of 
supermarkets are not regarded as core attributes, these factors may not act as 
brand determinants from a consumer perspective. Thus, we conclude that 
assortment, location, and service have the strongest effect on the retail brand 
equity of supermarkets and that these core attributes may equally drive retail 
brand equity within supermarkets in developed and emerging countries. 
The underlying consideration of core attributes for hypermarkets leads us to the 
conclusion that assortment (González-Benito 2005), service offerings (Solgaard 
and Hansen 2003) and perhaps large stores and appealing store layouts (Floch 
1988) particularly affect retail brand equity within hypermarket chains. The large 
stores of hypermarkets (Fernie and Pierrel 1996) are sometimes regarded as 
contributing to an average or above average store atmosphere (Levy and Weitz 
2012). Because price, car-oriented location, and communication are not con- 
sidered to be core attributes that are specific to hypermarkets, these attributes 
may not act as strong brand determinants within hypermarkets. Thus, concern- 
ing hypermarkets, we hypothesize that the core format attributes of assortment, 

114 
Chapter D 
service, and store layout are equal determinants of the brand-building process 
in developed and emerging countries. 
In sum, we hypothesize as follows: 
H2. 
The core format attributes identically influence retail brand 
equity within the specific format in emerging and developed 
countries, particularly the following: (a) price determines 
the retail brand equity of discounters; (b) assortment, loca- 
tion, and service determine the retail brand equity of super- 
markets; and (c) assortment, store layout, and service 
determine the retail brand equity of hypermarkets. 
3.3. 
Retail Brand Equity and Store Loyalty 
Store loyalty is defined as the intention and readiness to repurchase at a store 
(Evanschitzky and Wunderlich 2006; Oliver 1999), which describes conative 
loyalty and forms the penultimate stage in loyalty formation (Harris and Goode 
2004). Past studies in western countries (Pan and Zinkhan 2006; Chaudhuri 
and Ligas 2009) and in emerging markets (Zhou and Belk 2004; Alden, 
Steenkamp, and Batra 2006; Jinfeng and Zhilong 2009) underline that retail 
brand equity positively affects store loyalty or patronage towards a retailer. 
These relationships are also likely to be observed in format-specific contexts, 
as a retail brand within a particular format is determined by specific core 
attributes, and the constructed retail brand equity in turn influences store 
loyalty within a specific format. The reasoning is that a consumer who per-
ceives a discount format, for example, as being a strong, unique, and attrac- 
tive retail chain or brand will be more loyal to this format than to other formats. 
Therefore, a format-specific retail brand may function as identical drivers of 
store loyalty for both developed and emerging countries. Therefore, we 
propose the following hypothesis: 
H3. 
The relationship between retail brand equity and store 
loyalty within each format (i.e., for (a) discounters, (b) 
supermarkets, and (c) hypermarkets) is identical in devel- 
oped and emerging countries.

Empirical Study 
4.1. 
Context and Sample 
The sample selection procedure is presented below. First, the countries and 
cities in the respective countries were selected; second, the consumer sample 
was developed. 
We chose Germany to represent a developed country and Romania to 
represent an emerging country for theoretical and practical reasons. Germany 
was chosen because it is a large European country with nearly 82 m inhabitants 
and approximately 38,000 Intl. $ GDP per capita (International Monetary Fund 
2012). Furthermore, Germany is known as one of the most competitive 
countries in the grocery retail sector, with the highest concentration in the 
grocery sector, the highest amount of retail space per capita in the world, and 
the highest market shares of discounters (43.4% in 2011), whereas 
supermarkets and hypermarkets have market shares of 24.8% and 23.1%, 
respectively (GfK 2012; Cleeren et al. 2010; Planet Retail 2011). Trier was 
chosen as the city for the German field study because it is a typical medium-
sized city in Germany with approximately 240,000 inhabitants in the region and 
because of the presence of exclusively German grocery retailers. In addition, 
there are no other medium-sized cities within a one-hour driving distance, which 
enables a certain control for grocery consumer streams of inhabitants in the city. 
Trier has 41 discount stores, 50 supermarkets, and 13 hypermarkets, and these 
stores belong to five discounter, three supermarket, and five hypermarket 
brands. Romania was chosen because it represents a medium-sized emerging 
European country with nearly 22 m inhabitants and approximately 12,000 Intl. $ 
GDP per capita (International Monetary Fund 2012). Romania has a relatively 
low concentration rate in the modern grocery retail business, as the top five 
retailers have a market share under 30% of the total volume, compared with 
approximately 70% in Germany, and the local grocery retail market is strongly 
dominated by western European retail chains and formats, despite the presence 
of a few small local and mostly neighborhood store chains (e.g., Oncos reports 
less than 0.5 bn. EUR total sales and is the largest chain) (Planet Retail 2011). 
The traditional grocery formats had market shares of 21% (discounters), 30% 
(supermarkets) and 49% (hypermarkets) in 2011 considering the modern retail 
formats (Metro and GfK 2012). The city of Cluj was chosen for the same 

116 
Chapter D 
reasons that Trier was chosen. Cluj is a medium-sized city with approximately 
290,000 inhabitants, which is slightly greater than that of Trier; there are no 
other medium-sized cities within a one-hour driving distance, and all three retail 
formats are present. Cluj has nine discount stores, 33 supermarkets, and five 
hypermarkets; the first western European grocery retailer entered in 1999, and 
the last retailer entered in 2006. In total, the stores belong to three discounter, 
four supermarket, and four hypermarket brands. 
To develop the consumer samples in Germany and Romania, we used a cross-
sectional design and randomly selected inhabitants at the center of each city 
over a period of two weeks. We created a quota sampling procedure based on 
information provided by the national registration office concerning age and 
gender. After the pre-tests were administered, the survey was conducted by 
trained interviewers using a standardized questionnaire and face-to-face-
interviews. Every third person who passed the interviewers in the city center 
and conformed to the sample quota was asked to participate (similar to Orth 
and Holancova 2004). Each respondent was first asked to list the local grocery 
retailers with which he or she was familiar. Then, the respondents were asked 
to name three different grocery retailers at which they frequently shop 
(Schiffman, Dash, and Dillon 1977). Subsequently, the respondents were asked 
about one specific retail store, which was randomly chosen among the three 
retailers mentioned to be the retailer that would be evaluated in the following 
interview. There was no assessment of the choice of retail formats. Considering 
the Romanian sample, we included only chains that belong to western 
European retailers to ensure that our results are not biased through domestic 
retail chains because we wanted to account for the similarity of western 
European grocery retail formats. Against this background, we collected data 
from a total of 2,531 respondents. After the detection of outliers (22 in the 
German sample and 50 in the Romanian sample) according to Mahalanobis’ D2 
divided by the number of variables involved (Hair et al. 2010), 2,459 cases 
remained, including 919 respondents in Germany and 1,540 respondents in 
Romania. The realized sample distribution satisfied the planned quota sample 
(see Table D–1).

In Germany, 303 respondents evaluated a discounter, 305 respondents eval- 
uated a supermarket, and 311 respondents evaluated a hypermarket; among 
them, stores of six discounters, three supermarkets and five hypermarkets 
were rated. In Romania, 434 respondents evaluated a discounter, 347 re- 
spondents evaluated a supermarket and 759 respondents evaluated a hyper- 
market; among them, stores of four discounters, four supermarkets and four 
hypermarkets were rated.  
4.2. 
Measurement 
All measurements are based on previous studies (see Table 2) and were 
surveyed using seven-point Likert-type scales (from 1 indicating “strongly 
disagree” to 7 indicating “strongly agree”). Store loyalty is measured by adap- 
ting the scales of Chaudhuri and Holbrook (2001) and Harris and Goode 
(2004) with three items. We measured retail brand equity according to the 
scale of Verhoef et al. (2007), who used four items (strong, well-known, 
favorable and unique brands) and referred to store levels that were similar to 
those used by Jinfeng and Zhilong (2009) and Jacoby and Mazursky (1984). 
Because different inventories of retail attributes have been provided by schol- 
ars since the works of Martineau (1958a) and Fisk (1961), we decided to 
measure six retail attributes according to several prior sources (Table D–2).

We applied the translation-back-translation technique to ensure semantic 
equivalence (Hult et al. 2008). A bilingual market researcher translated the 
scales into Romanian, and a bilingual graduate student then translated the 
scales back into German. We compared the two versions and corrected the 
Romanian version until the back-translated German version matched the 
original German version. The scales were also pre-tested with two consumer 
focus groups and quantitatively tested using a questionnaire (N = 160). The 
quantitative pre-test provided satisfactory values for reliability and validity. 

Study 3: International Transfer and Perception of Retail Formats

We also included covariates in the study. Because consumer behavior may be 
influenced by gender (0 = male, 1 = female) and age (Schenk, Löffler, and 
Rauh 2007), we controlled for both variables. To exclude any biases through 
unobserved firm heterogeneity (Beck, Brüderl, and Woywode 2008; Snijders 
and Bosker 1999), we included 26 firm dummy variables to control for any 
higher-order effects resulting from the surveyed retailers within each format 
that was investigated (Vermeulen and Barkema 2001). Because four firm 
dummy variables were significant but did not change the results within each 
group, they are not included in the results section. 
4.3. 
Method 
The methodical approach that we used was threefold. First, the measurements 
were separately tested for reliability, validity, and possible biases for both 
countries. Second, we checked for measurement invariance between the two 
countries. Third, the hypotheses were tested.  
To confirm the reliability of the measurements (Table D–3), we ensured that 
the corrected item-to-total correlation was above .5 (Hair et al. 2010). The 
threshold was not met for the awareness item of the retail brand equity 
construct in Germany; therefore, this item was excluded from further analysis 
(also from the Romanian sample). To assess construct reliability, we 
computed Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability. These values exceed 
the recommended thresholds of .7 (Nunnally 1978, p. 245) and .6 (Bagozzi 
and Yi 1988, p. 80), respectively. Face validity was assessed by means of pre-
tests. For construct validity, all of the factor loadings of the confirmatory factor 
analysis (CFA) were above .5 (Hair et al. 2010), and the average variance 
extracted (AVE) values with a threshold of .5 provided support for convergent 
validity (Bagozzi and Yi 1988, p. 80). We also tested for discriminant validity 
(Fornell and Larcker 1981, p. 46). Because the squared correlation between 
assortment and store layout exceeded the AVE values of the two respective 
constructs for the Romanian sample, we also verified the discriminant validity 
using a chi-square difference test following the procedure of Anderson and 
Gerbing (1988, p. 416). Finally, the fit values for both confirmatory models (see 
Table D–4) were found to be satisfactory (Hu and Bentler 1999; Browne and 
Cudeck 1992; Hair et al. 2010) despite the F²/df value (Hinkin 1995). Because 
the latter value is dependent on the sample size, a value beyond the recom- 

120 
Chapter D 
mended threshold may be considered acceptable (Wheaton 1987, p. 128; 
Kline 2011, p. 204). 
The probability of non-response bias was controlled only by the selection 
procedure during the data collection process. We addressed common method 
bias a priori by employing an appropriate questionnaire design that included the 
appropriate order of questions and a posteriori by calculating a single-factor 
test using a confirmatory factor analysis (Podsakoff et al. 2003). The model 
with all items loading on a single factor (CFI .402; TLI .354; RMSEA .179; 
SRMR .133; F²(350) = 10,624.462) shows significantly worsened fit values in 
comparison with our model (ǻF²(28) = 9,057.072.149, p < .000) in Germany and 
Romania (CFI .631; TLI .602; RMSEA .153; SRMR .091; F²(350) = 13,027.569; 
ǻF²(28) = 10,990.121, p < .000). Thus, we can assume that the possibility of 
common method bias is reduced.

a For each violated case in which the criterion of Fornell and Larcker (1981) was not met, we also 
assessed the discriminant validity using a chi-square difference test by following the approach of 
Anderson and Gerbing (1988). This procedure demands a comparison of the chi-square value of a 
nested model with that of the proposed comparison model. The nested model is a more restrictive 
model with more degrees of freedom, as one correlation was fixed at value one, which indicates a 
perfect correlation between two constructs and thus no discriminatory power. However, each succes-
sively conducted comparison test yielded satisfactory results because the nested model fit was signif-
icantly poorer (p < .001) than that of the proposed comparison model. Thus, discriminant validity is 
ensured.

We conducted measurement invariance tests to assess the measurement 
equivalence between the countries (Cheung and Rensvold 2002) by applying 
a confirmatory factor analysis. The use of this approach requires a sequence 
of successive tests in which each step is a requirement for the following step 
(the baseline, metric-invariant, and scalar-invariant models). We applied 
differences-in-fit indices to determine the measurement invariance (e.g., chi-
square difference tests and ǻCFI) between each step. Because full scalar 
measurement invariance was not accomplished for both samples, partial 
scalar invariance was ascertained (Byrne, Shavelson, and Muthén 1989) by 

Study 3: International Transfer and Perception of Retail Formats

freeing some intercept and factor loading values (see Table D–5). The results 
indicate a good fit for all models and provide support for the proposition that 
partial measurement invariance holds for all constructs in both the German 
and Romanian samples. The partial invariance model is used in the sub- 
sequent hypothesis testing.

Results 
To analyze whether German and Romanian consumers perceive the specific 
format characteristics as expected, we calculated mean values for each retail 
attribute per format and per country.  
The results regarding the discount format perceptions of customers (see Table 
D–6) show that the core attribute is not perceived as being significantly 
different between the two countries; thus, hypothesis 1a is supported. We can 
conclude that the core attribute of discounters is perceived similarly, whereas 
consumer perceptions of other attributes vary (except for the perception of 
location). Furthermore, the results indicate that the mean value of price is the 

124 
Chapter D 
highest compared with other attributes. Because these results were obtained 
for both the developed and emerging countries, they provide strong support for 
price as the core attribute of discounters. Furthermore, location convenience is 
the second strongest attribute after price in both countries, and this result 
underlines the increasing relevance of the store networks of discounters 
(Cleeren et al. 2010).

a Two-tailed t-tests between Germany and Romania of one respective retail attribute in a specific 
retail format.

Among supermarkets, hypothesis 1b is not supported. Although service is 
perceived similarly in both countries, assortment and location are perceived 
significantly differently: they are perceived more strongly in Germany than in 
Romania. However, assortment and location show the highest mean values 
compared with other attributes in both countries. This result may underline the 
perceptions of consumers that assortment and location are the core attributes 
of supermarkets. With respect to the perceptions of hypermarkets, hypothesis 
1c is not supported. Although service is perceived similarly in both countries, 
the differences in the mean values of store layout and assortment vary; 

Study 3: International Transfer and Perception of Retail Formats 
125 
perceptions of store layout are stronger in Germany, and perceptions of 
assortment are stronger in Romania. However, it must be emphasized that 
both assortment and store layout are the two strongest core attributes in both 
countries. This finding indicates that although customer perceptions vary in 
this country comparison, there is strong evidence that assortment and store 
layout may be perceived as core attributes of hypermarkets.  
In sum, our reasoning concerning the unchanged perceptions of core 
attributes for particular retail formats does not hold, but the conceptualized 
core attributes are frequently perceived as being the strongest attributes within 
each format. This finding indicates that core attributes may dominate the 
format perceptions of consumers in both developed and emerging countries. 
To analyze whether the influence of retail attributes on retail brand equity 
differs for the formats between the two countries, we applied a multiple-group 
structural equation model (MG-SEM) using Mplus. The model revealed both 
the indirect and direct effects of retail attributes on store loyalty to draw a 
complete picture of the results and because the retail attributes are actually 
direct drivers of store loyalty (Pan and Zinkhan 2006) (see Table–D7). To 
interpret the results of the format comparison between Germany and Romania, 
we considered unstandardized structural coefficients (Singh 1995). The global 
fit measures of the calculated MG-SEM are satisfactory (CFI .927; TLI .919; 
RMSEA .067; SRMR .058; F²(2042) = 5,820.140).  
With respect to the results for discounters, the determining role of the core 
attribute of price does not significantly differ between the two countries; thus, 
hypothesis 2a is supported. However, price is a significant driver of retail brand 
equity only in Germany. Furthermore, the results show that assortment is the 
strongest driver of the retail brand equity of discounters in both countries. With 
respect to the results for supermarkets, the core attributes of assortment, 
location, and service do not differ significantly between the two countries as 
drivers of retail brand equity; thus, hypothesis 2b is supported. However, only 
assortment and service are significant drivers of retail brand equity in Germany 
and Romania, as location does not significantly contribute to retail brand equity 
but to store loyalty. Furthermore, the results show that communication is a 
relevant driver in both countries. With respect to the results pertaining to 

126 
Chapter D 
hypermarkets, the core attributes of store layout and assortment do not 
significantly differ in their effect on retail brand equity between the two 
countries, and both attributes drive retail brand equity, despite the store 
layouts that are found in Germany. However, service does significantly differ in 
its effect on retail brand equity; thus, hypothesis 2c is only partly supported. 
Furthermore, communication was found to be a driver of retail brand equity in 
both countries.  
In sum, the role of core attributes in retail brand equity within a specific format 
is apparent in both countries, but differences were also revealed. Thus, 
retailers should focus on their core attributes but also consider other effects, 
including country-specific effects, such as store layout in German hyper- 
markets. 
Hypotheses 3a, 3b, and 3c are supported, as the effect of retail brand equity 
on store loyalty is equally significant in both countries. Retail brand equity 
significantly influences store loyalty in Germany and Romania for all retail 
formats, discounters, supermarkets, and hypermarkets. Thus it may be 
concluded that a strong, attractive, and unique retail brand generally 
determines store loyalty in both developed and emerging countries. 
Furthermore, the direct effects of attribute perceptions for store loyalty differ 
between the two countries in three cases: for prices (supermarkets) and for 
store loyalty (supermarkets and hypermarkets). However, these direct effects 
and possible mediation effects are not the subjects of this study. With respect 
to the covariates, only age was significant for the German supermarkets; thus, 
this result indicates that older German consumers are more likely to be loyal to 
supermarkets.

Discussion 
This study builds on research on the increasing internationalization of retailers 
(Swoboda, Zentes, and Elsner 2009), in which grocery retailers are particularly 
likely to adapt their offers abroad (Gamble 2010; Goldman 2001) and 
successfully transfer well-known retail formats from home to host countries 
(Gielens and Dekimpe 2001). Because retail formats are considered retailers 
products and generic retail positioning profiles (Dawson 2000; González-
Benito 2005), this study specifically focuses on the role of the core attributes of 
a particular format for the building of a retail brand within a specific format as a 
determining factor of local consumer responses in Germany and Romania. 
The results show that although most consumer perceptions of core attributes 
differ between each retail format in both markets, when the retail brand equity 
is considered, similar core attributes are often found to be perceptually 
relevant for the position of each format as a strong brand in both markets. 
Therefore, the successful internationalization of grocery retailers occurs 
through local responsiveness and the adaptation of offers (Goldman 2001; 
Swoboda, Elsner, and Morschett 2012), but this adaptation occurs within the 
boundaries of core attributes that are specific to each format. Thus, format-
specific core attributes determine format transfer efforts and consumer-related 
market success. This observation allows for three theoretical and managerial 
suggestions. 
Concerning the first research question regarding format perceptions, we 
observe that the core attributes of a particular retail format are not always 
perceived similarly by customers in developed and emerging countries, 
although the core format attributes often represent the highest mean values 
compared with other store attributes. With respect to hypermarkets, for 
example, perceptions of store layout and assortment are higher than those of 
other attributes. These results support but also contribute additional know- 
ledge to previous observations, such as research on discounters (Burt and 
Mavrommatis 2006). We show that although format-specific core attribute 
perceptions vary between countries, core attributes frequently reach the 
highest values (i.e., the structure of the attributes) within a specific format in 
both countries. Perceptions regarding core attributes may vary because of 
strong adaptation pressures, such as price adaptation resulting from local 

Study 3: International Transfer and Perception of Retail Formats 
129 
income and supply issues (Swoboda, Elsner, and Morschett 2012), but similar 
core attributes determine inter-format competition from the consumer per- 
spective (for an overview, see Cleeren et al. 2010). Thus, retailers must 
consider these attributes when expanding abroad. Scholars should note that 
standardization or adaptation degrees are determined not only by the interna- 
tionalization strategies and local environments of firms but also by the genuine 
formats that are chosen for expansion. 
Concerning our second research question, we observe that the relevance of 
core attributes for strong retail brand positioning within each format does not 
substantially differ between the two countries and that the relationship 
between retail brand equity and store loyalty is significant for all formats and in 
both countries, although the latter result implies that retail brands are also a 
strong predictor of patronage in an international context (Keller and Lehmann 
2006). Thus these format-specific core attributes represent the expected 
boundaries of format transfer abroad and for local consumer responses. This 
finding may indicate the need for a stronger format-specific (rather than 
general) view of international success in retailing (Gielens and Dekimpe 2001; 
Etgar and Rachman-Moore 2008). However, the relevance of other attributes 
for success in different countries should not be neglected. The following list 
includes format-specific implications concerning discounters, supermarkets, 
and hypermarkets as well as attribute-specific implications: 
Strong discount brands generally draw from price perceptions, which imply 
that adaptation and local competition efforts must be based on this particular 
core attribute. This finding contributes to the spatial competition literature (e.g., 
González-Benito, Muñoz-Gallego, and Kopalle 2005; Popkowski Leszczyc, 
Sinha, and Timmermans 2000) and studies on format-specific transfer and 
response to local markets (Goldman 2001; Swoboda, Elsner, and Morschett 
2012). However, the results also show that discount brands strongly draw from 
assortment perceptions in both countries, whereas location effects differ 
between the two countries, perhaps because of differing store networks or 
cultural differences between the countries (Evans and Mavondo 2002). The 
effect of assortment on retail brand equity may indicate that there is a general 
change in the position of discounters in both Germany and Romania. 

130 
Chapter D 
Supermarkets primarily draw from the core attributes of assortment and 
service (Solgaard and Hansen 2003; Sjödin and Törn 2006). Because the 
effects of assortment and service on retail brand equity do not differ between 
the developed and emerging countries in this study, this finding indicates the 
largely similar role of both attributes in the strategy of transferring super- 
markets to foreign countries. Remarkably, there is no influence of the core 
attribute of location on brand equity in either country, although location is a 
driver of store loyalty in both countries. Because communication is also a 
significant driver of retail brand equity, we can conclude that retailers utilizing 
the supermarket format can generate strong brands across countries when 
they focus on assortment, service, and communication.  
Hypermarkets draw from the core attributes of assortment and service in both 
countries (Solgaard and Hansen 2003). The lack of difference between the 
countries considering assortment indicates the largely unchanged role of this 
attribute in the transfer strategies of hypermarkets. The relevance of the third 
conceptualized core attribute (store layout) only for Romanian hypermarkets 
may be explained by two facts: first, Cluj contains three French hypermarket 
retailers, which place greater emphasis on the experience orientation of 
customers compared with the hypermarket retailers in Germany. Second, the 
hypermarket format is innovative for the Romanian grocery retail market, as 
the Romanian grocery sector was dominated by small regional neighborhood 
stores in the past and serves as evidence of the success of innovative formats 
in emerging markets (Gielens and Dekimpe 2001). Hypermarkets also have 
the highest market share in Romanian grocery retailing among the different 
formats. 
In sum, we can conclude that a format-specific view is useful for retailers and 
researchers who observe the foreign expansion of firms. The transfer of retail 
attributes is known to vary in terms of, for example, less adapted store layouts 
or services and stronger adapted assortments or prices (Goldman 2001). 
However, when retailers transfer format elements abroad, they must consider 
both adaptation levels and consumer perceptions. In other words, when the 
core attribute of discounters is price (Solgaard and Hansen 2003), discounters 
encounter specific challenges in adapting their prices in relation to local 
competition or hypermarkets in adapting their assortment. Thus, a simple 

Study 3: International Transfer and Perception of Retail Formats 
131 
observation of single attributes and their adaptation levels without consideration 
of specific formats neglects format-specific boundary conditions. Consequently, 
we call for a format-specific investigation of format transfers into foreign coun- 
tries. 
For retail managers who transfer preferred formats to host countries but are 
forced to be locally responsible, knowledge of the role of core format attributes 
in strong brand positioning in the minds of consumers is of paramount 
importance because this role may differ from the home country experience – 
particularly in emerging countries (Evans and Mavondo 2002) – and because 
different consumer perceptions may jeopardize market success. Our results 
show that Western expectations concerning the effects of core attributes on 
brand building are confirmed in Romania; thus, expected core attributes 
equally determine format positioning, such as price for discounters, service for 
supermarkets, and assortment for hypermarkets. Such mechanisms of brand 
building should be known and carefully observed by retail managers, espe- 
cially in dynamic emerging retailing markets. However, differences between 
countries should also be considered when a format is transferred abroad (e.g., 
a hypermarket’s store layout is only relevant in the emerging country).

Limitations and Further Research 
This study contains certain limitations and provides opportunities for future 
research. Although we devoted special attention to data collection, this study is 
limited in scope. We collected data in two countries, focused on two cities, and 
considered only three retail formats. We did not control for other potential 
differences relating to the brands, store locations or further differences of the 
investigated retailers. Broadening the database would mitigate these 
limitations and allow for further conclusions. For example, although Romania is 
an emerging European country, future studies may target other countries, 
control for country-of-origin effects in retailing (Javalgi, Cutler, and Winans 
2001; Baldauf et al. 2009) and cultural differences in retailing (e.g., De Mooij 
and Hofstede 2002), and compare foreign and domestic retail positions and 
success factors (e.g., Swoboda, Pennemann, and Taube 2013); the latter 
subject was not addressed in this study.  

132 
Chapter D 
Considering changes in the dimensionality of the measurement of certain 
attributes (e.g., placing greater emphasis on the breadth and depth of 
assortments) may influence the role that an attribute may play in explaining 
retail brand equity; thus, a closer investigation of the core attributes (e.g., 
using objective attribute descriptions) may extend the observations that can be 
drawn from such a study. Intra-format competition was not observed in the 
current study, as we summarized retailers under the format-specific retail 
brand and did not observe additional grocery formats, such as convenience or 
neighborhood stores. For example, the inclusion of additional formats or rural 
areas would allow for more detailed investigations (Burt and Mavrommatis 
2006). Finally, the inclusion of moderating factors, such as shopping motives 
(Noble, Griffith, and Adjei 2006) or the degree to which store brands a retailer 
offers (Corstjens and Lal 2000; Woodside and Ozcan 2009), are conceivable, 
and a longitudinal analysis could assist us in understanding changes in 
consumer perceptions of formats in dynamic markets.

Discussion and Conclusions 
1.1. 
Core Results 
Retail branding is an important intangible asset for retailers and one that is 
crucial in determining consumer behavior, e.g. store loyalty, and in turn drives 
consumer spending and retailers’ performance (Keller and Lehmann 2006; 
Jinfeng and Zhilong 2009; Macintosh and Lockshin 1997). Despite the undis-
puted relevance of retail branding and a peak in retail branding studies in 2004 
due to a special issue on retail branding in the Journal of Retailing (Grewal 
and Levy 2007), a literature review depicted that there was much more re-
search on store image than on retail branding (see Chapter A). Specifically, 
several complex branding-related topics emerged, i.e., retail branding and re-
ciprocal relationships, the interplay of retail brands and location in a local com-
petitive context, and retail brand effects within retail formats in an international 
context. These related topics contain fruitful research areas on retail branding 
and aim to further our understanding on retail brand effects in driving store 
loyalty. Thus, this thesis also contributes to the lack of research on the drivers 
of store loyalty (Peterson and Balasubramanian 2002). The present thesis of-
fers new insights on a highly relevant topic for scholars and practitioners. The 
different contexts that arise within the topic of retail branding are examined 
based on established theories (e.g., schema theory) by means of several stud-
ies conducted (e.g. cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental designs), 
and by approaching different methods (e.g., non-recursive structural equation 
modeling, cross-lagged design for structural equation models, and multiple-
group structural equation modeling). Additionally, It must be emphasized that it 
is essential to take the consumers’ view of brand into account, as the retail 
brand’s power exists in consumers’ minds (Leone et al. 2006). The present 
doctoral thesis, therefore, occupies the perspective of behavioral science on 
retail branding. In total, the present research emerges specifically from a lack 
of knowledge (1) on reciprocal effects in retailing, (2) on current insights on 
location issues in conjunction with retail brands, and (3) on the principles of 
managing retail brands within retail formats across countries.

Chapter E 
In detail, the following key questions can be answered with the present re-
search: 
(1)  Do perceptions regarding a retailer’s reputation and retail store equities in-
teract with each other in determining store loyalty, and how should retailers 
manage both levels, e.g. invest in their reputation or in stores as brands? 
(2)  Against the background of different local competitive contexts, should re-
tailers manage their retail brand or easily accessible stores to attract con-
sumers? 
(3)  Are specific retail format characteristics actually perceived by consumers in 
a similar manner in developed as well as in emerging countries, and do 
they equally influence the respective retail brands within each format in 
both developed and emerging countries? 
The main results of the three studies conducted for each of these questions 
are interesting and can be described as follows. 
By answering the first key question, Study 1 explores whether reciprocity ex-
ists between associations at different perception levels (i.e. between corporate 
reputation and retail store equity) and which of both associations is a stronger 
driver of store loyalty. This research enhances our understanding of the role of 
consumers’ local and corporate brand perceptions in store loyalty, which in 
turn is a strong driver of retail performance. Thus, retail managers may gain 
insights for use in the allocation of investments. Study 1 focuses, therefore, on 
the first general research objective. The findings of several studies by using 
cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental designs considering different 
retail sectors identify positive reciprocal effects between associations at differ-
ent perceptions levels, i.e. corporate reputation and retail store equity. All stud-
ies conducted evidence the existence of reciprocity between different percep-
tion levels. Thus, retailers who have created positive associations with their 
corporation and their store in consumers’ minds, and thus created positive as-
sociations at different perception levels, will draw positively from the fact that 
these associations mutually support each other positively. The present re-
search contributes to proving the existence of reciprocal effects empirically 
based on schema theoretical reasoning. Most of the results also support the 
assumption that store loyalty draws most from the consumers’ associations at 

Final Remarks 
135 
store level, i.e. from retail store equity. This knowledge advances the under-
standing of how retailers should manage both levels to attract consumers, e.g. 
to focus on store-related investments. Thus, with the expectation that a retailer 
has created positive associations considering both levels in consumers’ minds, 
it becomes apparent that focusing on the store-related associations may result 
in a promising pay-off for retailers’ performance. However, investments at the 
corporate level should not be neglected. 
By answering the second key question, Study 2 explores the influence of retail 
brand equity and store accessibility of a focal retailer and his competitors on 
store loyalty in consideration of different objective local competitive situations. 
This research aims to add further knowledge on consumers’ local brand and 
location perceptions that affect store loyalty in different competitive situations. 
Thus, retailers may gain insights concerning future site selection and the allo-
cation of investments through building the retail brand and location choice. 
Study 2 focuses, therefore, on the second general research objective. The re-
sults are based on a cross-sectional consumer study at 30 locations of one 
specific DIY retailer and show that the focal retailer’s retail brand equity and 
store accessibility have a positive influence on store loyalty. Additionally, retail 
brand equity was confirmed to be a driver of store accessibility. Second, the 
results also indicate that the retail brand equity and store accessibility effects 
of competitors have a negative influence on store loyalty towards the focal re-
tailer. The findings of Study 2 also support the assumption that the effects vary 
in consideration of different objective local competitive situations, i.e. differing 
local competitive intensities and different local distances to the next possible 
competitor. The impact of an easily accessible store location on store loyalty 
increases with low competitive intensity and a short distance to the next possi-
ble competitor. In turn, retailers profit most from retail brand equity if the next 
competitor is nearby. However, the results of Study 2 also show that retail 
brand equity is always the strongest driver of store loyalty in any competitive 
situation. This knowledge advances our understanding of the importance of a 
retail brand for retailers. Again, retailers should invest in building a strong retail 
brand because retail brand equity drives store loyalty more than store accessi-
bility. Store accessibility and thus, a favorable location, is viewed as an im-
portant retail attribute that determines store choice and follows the old retail 

136 
Chapter E 
mantra “location, location, location”. Thus, retailers should not neglect careful 
location decisions, but also take the retail brand into account when deciding on 
investments in different competitive situations. However, acknowledging the 
immense impact retail brand equity has on store loyalty in comparison to store 
accessibility in any local competitive situation, concentration by retailers on 
building a strong retail brand will result in enhanced performance as the retail 
brand has supporting effects that are independent of weak or strong locations. 
By answering the third key question, Study 3 explores the perceptions of for-
mat-specific core attributes and their influence on retail brand equity, which in 
turn drives store loyalty, against the background of a developed and an emerg-
ing market. In detail, the emphasis of this research lies on western European 
grocery retailers who transfer their traditional retail formats, i.e. discounters, 
supermarkets, and hypermarkets, to emerging countries, e.g. Romania. This 
research is of interest to managers because they frequently use their retail 
format(s) for foreign expansion and need to know whether customers abroad 
perceive the format in a similar manner. They need to know especially whether 
the attributes characteristic of the format drive the brand to an equal extend. 
Thus, retailers gain knowledge to manage their format and retail brand abroad 
efficiently and thus enhance performance. Study 3 focuses, therefore, on the 
third general research objective. The results are based on two cross-sectional 
consumer studies on the grocery sector (Germany and Romania) and show 
that most of the format-specific core attributes differ in consumers’ perceptions 
between the developed and the emerging market, but that the format-specific 
core attributes achieve the highest evaluations in both Germany and Romania. 
Thus, the format-specific attributes are also perceived to be core attributes in 
emerging countries. However, the findings support the assumption that most 
format-specific core attributes drive retail brand equity to an equal extend with-
in the specific format in both the developed and the emerging country. Thus, 
retailers can also retain their format-specific brand positioning in emerging 
countries. This knowledge advances the understanding of how retailers should 
transfer their retail formats to foreign, emerging countries. Emphasizing that 
most core attributes characteristic of the format drive the retail brand to an 
equal extend within a specific retail format in the developed as well as in the 
emerging country, the results implicate that the adaptation of retail offers within 

Final Remarks 
137 
the boundaries of a particular retail format, i.e. assortment and service as core 
elements of supermarkets, may be a successful way to internationalize. In 
turn, the results also demonstrate further instruments that are of relevance for 
a specific country, i.e. the relevance of store layout for Romanian hypermar-
kets, which have to be taken into account. 
In summary, the findings of this doctoral thesis prove the relevance of retail 
branding for customers’ store loyalty and, in turn, retailers’ success. In detail, 
the importance of retail brands was shown (1) for reciprocal effects that occur 
within consumers’ minds as they hold associations with a retailer in their mind 
at different perception levels that interact, (2) at a local level in conjunction with 
a store’s location and different competitive situations, whereas the latter are 
responsible for varying effects of retail brand equity and store accessibility on 
store loyalty, and (3) for retailers who transfer their retail formats to emerging 
countries, where they have to transport a specific retail brand information and 
face a number of complex decisions relating to adaptation and standardization 
within the boundaries of a chosen retail format and its characteristic core at-
tributes. Examination of these results is based on several studies conducted in 
consideration of different retail sectors (i.e., do-it-yourself, fashion, and gro-
cery), local, nationwide, as well as international consumer samples, different 
designs (i.e., cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental designs), and var-
ious methods, (e.g., non-recursive SEM, cross-lagged design for SEM, and 
multiple-group SEM). The innovative observations in the retailing context, es-
pecially with respect to reciprocal relationships in retailing, provide further 
knowledge on how retailers should manage their retail brands in different 
complex contexts. The present thesis provides several research and theoreti-
cal implications as well as managerial conclusions, and points out the direction 
for further research topics, which are presented in the following. 
1.2. 
Research and Theoretical Implications 
The present thesis contributes to research and theory in several ways, which 
are discussed in the following.  
By examining reciprocal relationships, the present research contributes to an 
under-researched topic in retailing – bidirectional effects at different perception 
levels (Atkin 1962; Stanley and Sewall 1976). Thus, the present work expands 

138 
Chapter E 
the present knowledge on unidirectional relationships (Helgesen, Ivar Håvold, 
and Nesset 2010; Grewal et al. 1998). The knowledge on the drivers of store 
loyalty is also enhanced, as Study 1 indicates that consumers’ retailer associa-
tions at different perception levels support each other mutually before influenc-
ing loyalty, although the driving power remains at store level (Peterson and 
Balasubramanian 2002; Puccinelli et al. 2009). These findings are explored 
through the lens of schema theoretical reasoning and associative network the-
ory (Mandler 1979; Anderson 1983). Following theory, information is stored in 
memory using nodes. Regardless of whether these nodes are organized in a 
categorical or fuzzy manner, the theory postulates that nodes are linked to one 
another. Considering the directionality of those links, the present research con-
firms that activation between nodes occurs in both directions. Thus, with its 
several research designs, Study 1 provides scientific evidence to marketing 
rules that may have previously been founded mainly on managerial experi-
ence. Schema theoretical reasoning was also found to be able to explain the 
strength of specific associations for store loyalty. It was noted that these asso-
ciations reveal strengths that are used and updated more frequently. Consider-
ing consumer behavior, this may occur for situations or objects that are used 
and experienced frequently. Furthermore, the methodological implication of 
this study lies in the valid methodology for a detailed analysis of reciprocal ef-
fects by means of successive studies (i.e., cross-sectional, longitudinal, and 
experimental designs), whereas the final conclusion on the existence of recip-
rocal effects is finally drawn by using the experimental design. 
By analyzing how retail brand equity and store accessibility of a focal retailer 
and its local competitors influence store loyalty, the results of Study 2 contrib-
ute to the call of Grewal, Levy, and Kumar (2009) for more research on loca-
tion issues. With this approach and the inclusion of moderating variables such 
as competitive intensity, Study 2 also contributes to the request for further re-
search on the drivers of store loyalty (Peterson and Balasubramanian 2002). 
Thus, the changing effects on store loyalty of the drivers examined, i.e. retail 
brand equity and store accessibility of a focal retailer as well as its local com-
petitors, further our knowledge on consumer behavior due to different local 
competitive situations. The present research, therefore, confirms that the dif-
ferent competitive situations illustrate varying contexts that influence the re-

Final Remarks 
139 
trieval of mental representations (Dellaert, Arentze, and Timmermans 2008). 
Furthermore, as the effect of retail brand equity on store accessibility is posi-
tive for both the focal retailer and its competitors, this result validates the con-
ceptualization of Grewal, Levy, and Lehman (2004), which postulates positive 
brand effects for the value creation of assortment or service, for example. 
Thus, it is found that retail branding also drives consumers’ value creation pos-
itively in terms of easily accessible locations. These results can be shown with 
a sample that comprises consumer evaluations from a nationwide survey con-
ducted at 30 different locations of a focal retailer, including local competition. 
By investigating the perceptions of core attributes of specific retail formats and 
their influence on the retail brand within a particular format, the present re-
search furthers our knowledge of the brand building process for traditional re-
tail formats in developed and emerging countries. The present study contrib-
utes to the research on format transfer to emerging countries and to position-
ing studies that observe whether the retailer’s position in the home and devel-
oped countries can be retained abroad, specifically in emerging countries. 
Thus, the focus of the present research goes beyond studies that consider on-
ly one format, e.g. low-price formats such as discounters (Zhu, Singh, and 
Manuszak 2009; Merrilees, McKenzie, and Miller 2007) or only a few attrib-
utes, e.g. price, assortment, and service (Solgaard and Hansen 2003). The 
findings, therefore, enhance knowledge on retail branding by using three for-
mats (i.e., discounters, supermarkets, and hypermarkets), several retail attrib-
utes (i.e., communication, store layout, assortment, location, price, and ser-
vice), and the implementation of a country comparison between Germany as a 
developed country and Romania as an emerging country. In order to answer 
the third key question, Study 3 followed the idea of the stimulus-organism-
response (S-O-R) framework (Russell and Mehrabian 1976; Thang and Tan 
2003), but using consumer perceptions instead of manifest stimuli and re-
sponse variables. 
In summary, retail brand associations constitute retailer information that is 
stored in consumers’ minds and retrieved from memory to make purchase de-
cisions for example (Marshall 1995). Despite the complex relationships be-
tween information stored in consumer’s minds, i.e., reciprocal relationships, 
the strength of particular associations is responsible ultimately for consumer 

140 
Chapter E 
behavior. Objective local competitive situations and the transfer of retail for-
mats to emerging countries are compound contexts that enhance our know- 
ledge on the effects of retail branding on consumer behavior. 
1.3. 
Managerial Implications 
Since retail branding is still a decisive managerial topic with various complex 
content areas, the consumer-specific view of this doctoral thesis provides ma-
jor managerial implications. 
Mutual supporting effects in retailing. Consumers can be attracted if a retailer 
can establish positive associations in consumers’ minds towards his corporation 
or chain as well as towards his stores. This effect of winning customers occurs 
under the precondition that consumers have positive associations with the vari-
ous aspects concerning a retailer. In this case, the positive associations support 
each other positively in attracting and winning customers (Stanley and Sewall 
1976). This knowledge is valuable for retailer operations in different situations. 
By investing efficiently in their reputation and store brands, retailers are able to 
retain their existing customers and attract new ones. Retailers may also suc-
ceed easily in gaining new customers at a location where they build a new store 
(Atkin 1962). Thus, retailers should invest carefully in building a positive reputa-
tion and store equity. It is of particular interest that the associations in consum-
ers’ minds considering the corporation or the chain and its stores should match 
or fit each other because efficient information storage and retrieval are depend-
ent on the extent of fit between information (Eysenck and Keane 2005). Howev-
er, retailers may focus on the fact that store loyalty may draw more strongly 
from store-related associations than from corporate- or chain-related associa-
tions. Thus, retailers can manage their investments, e.g. promotional invest-
ments in building reputation and store equity, more efficiently with regard to en-
hancing customer loyalty intentions if they consider that those associations and 
links in consumers’ minds that are updated, activated, and retrieved more fre-
quently have the greatest impact on consumers’ behavior. 
Retail brands create value and perform well in different competitive situations. 
Positive perceived retail brand associations are able to create value in terms of 
positively driving the perceptions of a store’s accessibility. Retailers that suc-
ceed in creating positive retail brand associations in consumers’ minds can 

Final Remarks 
141 
draw from this established factor to convey them to other attributes. Thus, re-
tail brands can be used to drive specific retail marketing instruments such as 
accessibility, service, or quality perceptions, positively (Grewal and Levy 2009). 
The gravitational pull of a strong, attractive and unique retail brand may make 
consumers think more positively about the product assortment a retailer offers, 
consumers may consider the prices to be not as expensive, or locations not as 
far away as they really are. Thus, creating a strong and attractive retail brand 
pays off for retailers. For example, retailers with favorable and unique brands, 
such as IKEA, can use their strong retail brand to attract customers to drive a 
long way to their stores. Against the background of the retail brand equity and 
store accessibility that drive customers’ loyalty intentions, it becomes obvious 
that, for low or high competitive intensity or small or large distances to the next 
possible competitor, the retail brand is the most important antecedent for store 
loyalty. Although location was considered to be the most relevant driver of store 
choice and, in turn, of retailers’ success (Grewal, Levy, and Kumar 2009), re-
tailers may learn from the present findings that, with growing mobility of and 
variety seeking by consumers, having a location next to consumers is not the 
only reason for consumers to visit and revisit a specific store because the retail 
brand performs better in influencing store loyalty than store accessibility, in 
spite of different competitive situations. However, having an easily accessible 
location may still be of importance for retailers, and they should not neglect 
careful decisions on location issues. But with respect to investments in location 
or retail brand, retailers should consider the possibility that the retail brand will 
gain significance. 
Retail brands and format-specific attributes across countries. The comparison 
of developed and emerging countries is of relevance specifically as retailers 
increasingly leave their home and saturated foreign markets to do business in 
emerging countries. Retailers may note that although the perceptions consid-
ering the format-specific core attributes vary between the developed and the 
emerging country, i.e. between Germany and Romania, there is strong evi-
dence that consumers evaluate the format-specific core attributes more posi-
tively than the other attributes. Thus, retailers can be sure of their format-
related positioning abroad with respect to inter-format competition when they 
focus on the specific core attributes. With respect to the relevance of the core 

142 
Chapter E 
attributes for the brand building process in developed and emerging markets, 
discounters should take price into account, while supermarkets should focus 
on assortment and service in the same way as hypermarkets. Further relevant 
attributes also emerge depending on the retail format: discounters should also 
focus on their assortments, supermarkets should also focus on communica-
tion, and hypermarkets may additionally focus on communication and store 
layout, although the latter is only relevant for Romanian consumers. Thus, de-
spite the relevance of format-specific core attributes for retail brand, communi-
cation activities frequently try to enhance the brand (Sjödin and Törn 2006). 
However, as store location plays a role mainly in explaining format competition 
(Fox and Sethuraman 2010) and customers’ store choice (Cleeren et al. 
2010), the present findings also reveal that store location does not drive retail 
brand equity in any format or any country, but it does influence store loyalty 
across formats and countries. 
The following points summarize the conclusions for managers: 
- Retailers should consider mutually supporting reciprocal effects in retailing 
in order to manage their investments efficiently, e.g. promotional invest-
ments across corporate and store levels. 
- Consumers’ associations that are activated frequently, e.g. through specific 
advertising, have the greatest influence in attracting and retaining custom-
ers. Thus, if retailers were to promote store level associations frequently, 
these associations would act as strong drivers in attracting customers. 
- Retail brand serves as a gravitational pull for positive evaluations of store 
accessibility and possibly for other retail marketing instruments. 
- The retail brand outperforms store accessibility in influencing consumer be-
havior in spite of low or high competitive intensity and of small or large dis-
tances to the next competitor. 
- With respect to format transfer from developed countries to foreign coun-
tries, perceptions of particular format-specific core attributes vary across 
countries, but the core attributes are still characteristic for each format and 
define the retail brand equally within each format. 
- Depending on the format used, retailers have to focus on additional attrib-
utes in building retail brand building across countries.

Further Research 
In addition to theoretical and managerial implications, this thesis also provides 
issues for further research. Although limitations and further research topics are 
discussed at the end of each study, general fields for further research emerge 
regarding data basis and methodology as well as content relevant to retail 
brand.  
First, although the present doctoral thesis is based on extensive data samples, 
there are still possibilities regarding the data basis for further research. Broad-
ening the data basis to include further sectors, retailers, locations, or countries 
would help to investigate the relationship between brand and loyalty in depth. 
Extension of the nationwide sample to more than 30 locations, for example, 
and considering different retailers would extend analysis of the trade-off be-
tween retail brand equity and store accessibility. Also, the inclusion of second-
ary data would enhance our knowledge on possible moderating and direct ef-
fects, and this extension of the data base would allow for multi-level analysis. 
This kind of analysis using multi-level structural equation modeling is suggest-
ed for analysis of hierarchical data, e.g., the effect of market and firm-specific 
characteristics on consumer-related relationships between brand and loyalty 
(e.g., Schramm-Klein 2008). Furthermore, using a longitudinal design regard-
ing format-specific core attributes, retail brand equity, and store loyalty would 
allow examination of the effects that emerge for new formats in foreign coun-
tries over time. This would contribute to studies that focus on a descriptive in-
vestigation of new formats entering a foreign country (Fernie and Arnold 2002) 
by analyzing how consumer perceptions and effects change over time. Thus, 
broadening the data basis would expand the possibilities for gaining know- 
ledge on retail brand topics as this would also allow for other methodological 
approaches. 
Second, other perspectives relevant to retail brand should be explored. For 
example, several levels emerge for further examination regarding the branding 
of diversified or non-diversified retailers. As there is not only the perspective of 
a corporation and its store, but also store brands (Burt and Davies 2010), the 
research areas considering retail branding expand. For example, various open 
issues emerge with respect to reciprocal effects in grocery retailing. Possible 

144 
Chapter E 
bidirectional relationships with respect to store brands and retail brands, for 
example, are still unanswered (Martenson 2007). The question also remains, 
therefore, as to whether store loyalty intentions draw more on store brands or 
on retail brand equity. This topic would be relevant for retailers as they may 
gain knowledge on how to manage their store brands or for managers who are 
considering the option of developing strong store brands. Especially against 
the background of retailers that operate either with their brand name for store 
brands or without their brand name, possible moderating effects may emerge 
in considering this issue. Furthermore, interesting new insights may emerge by 
examining the corporate, chain, store, and store brand levels when consider-
ing diversified retailers. All in all, further studies may take reciprocal effects in 
their research into account. 
Furthermore, other explanatory variables may add knowledge in relationships 
between retail brand and loyalty. With respect to value creation through retail 
brands, for example, it would be worth considering other retail attributes in ad-
dition to store accessibility that could be influenced by retail brand equity and 
testing the conceptualization of Grewal et al. (2004; 2009). The gravitational 
pull of a retailer’s brand may also force consumers to judge other instruments 
more favorably than they actually are, for example quality, service, and price 
perceptions or store brand evaluations. An examination of other attributes that 
are boosted by the retail brand in determining store loyalty may add 
knowledge on how strongly other attributes are affected by the retail brand. 
Thus, retailers’ knowledge on managing attributes would be enhanced. 
Finally, there are various consumer characteristics, firm-specific variables, and 
market characteristics that can be considered as further boundary conditions 
and thus as moderators in retail branding research. Risk perception, self-
confidence, and store familiarity are relevant consumer characteristics that 
need to be considered (Pan and Zinkhan 2006; Inman, Winer, and Ferraro 
2009). Number of stores, average store size, and country of origin or country 
image are possible values that are specific to the firm and could be taken into 
account (Voss and Seiders 2003; Hsieh, Pan, and Setiono 2004). Examples of 
relevant market characteristics are retail sector and format, level and nature of 
competition, population, and income (Venkatesan, Mehta, and Bapna 2007; 
Zhu, Singh, and Manuszak 2009). For example, an examination of moderating

effects other than competitive intensity and distances to the next competitor, 
e.g., average store size as firm-specific characteristic, on the influence of driv-
ers for store loyalty in conjunction with the conceptualization of Study 2 may 
further our knowledge on consumer behavior. In retail studies, a larger store 
was considered more attractive than a smaller store. Especially for the grocery 
sector, there are several retail formats that differ in terms of average store 
size. Examination of the moderating influence of store sizes of a focal retailer 
and its competitors – specific to intra- as well as inter-format – on the relation-
ship between retail brand equity, store accessibility, and store loyalty forms a 
fruitful area of research with many insights. Another example in conjunction 
with the conceptualization of Study 1 is examination of the moderating effects 
that store familiarity, as a consumer characteristic, has on the reciprocal ef-
fects and their influence on store loyalty. Store familiarity can be understood 
as the frequency with which a consumer visits a particular store (Inman, Winer, 
and Ferraro 2009). It is possible that consumers who are less familiar with a 
specific store draw more from corporate associations because they do not 
have any frequent activations or updates regarding the store level. Thus, in-
cluding such boundary conditions would further our knowledge on how to 
manage retail brands efficiently and enhance customer outcomes.

Exogeneity Test of Instrumental Variables  
To test whether the instrumental variables, corporate communication and store 
attribute perceptions are exogenous (Frone, Russell, and Cooper 1994), we 
considered two further instrumental variables. As an instrumental variable for 
corporate communication we used expectations in corporate communication, 
which represent general expectations in corporate communication (in the sec-
tor). Thus, general expectations in corporate communication directly influence 
the perceptions of a corporation’s corporate communication but are not likely 
to influence perceptions toward corporate reputation. Expectations in corpo-
rate communication is measured by a single item: asking how important corpo-
rate communication is in DIY-retailing on a 7-point Likert-type scale. As an in-
strumental variable for store attribute perceptions, we used shopping motives 
(measured with a 7-point Likert-type scale adopted from Rintamäki et al. 
(2006); see Table G–1 for reliability and validity tests) and argued that general 
shopping motives concerning the sector drives the consumer attribute percep-
tions of a DIY store.

Chapter G 
We checked for the strength of the instrumental variables for corporate com-
munication and store attribute perceptions (Stock and Watson 2011). F-tests 
show that the recommended threshold of 10 is higher for both instrumental 
variables (for expectations in corporate communication, F is 462,336, and for 
shopping motives, F is 550,090). Thus, both instrumental variables can be in-
terpreted to be strong predictors (Antonakis et al. 2012). In addition to our pro-
posed model (efficient model, see Antonakis et al. 2010), we calculated a con-
sistent model using the two additional instrumental variables, expectations in 
corporate communication and shopping motives, using the Hausman (1978) 
test to compare whether there was a change in path estimates. A change in 
path estimates would account for the endogeneity of corporate communication 
and store attribute perceptions. The respective z-value of the comparisons of 
the effect of corporate communication on corporate reputation was 5.480, and 
it was 1.111 for store attribute perceptions on retail store equity. These results 
indicate that store attribute perceptions is exogenous, whereas corporate 
communication may be endogenous.

A solution to this result would be to use the consistent model with expectations 
in corporate communication and shopping motives as additional instrumental 
variables to assure consistent estimated beta values. There are three reasons 
we decided to choose the efficient model instead of the consistent model for 
hypothesis testing: The global fit measures of the consistent model are modest, 
at best (CFI .905; TLI .891; RMSEA .061; SRMR .117; F²(346) = 7,565.256). 
The structure of the results between the consistent model (with expectations in 
corporate communication and shopping motives) and the efficient model (our 
proposed model) is the same (see Table G–2), so the hypotheses would have 
to be accepted in any case. Kline (2011, p. 156) stated that an instrumental 
variable could be endogenous or exogenous. However, the use of exogenous 
instrumental variables is preferred.
