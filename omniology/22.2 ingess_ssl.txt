How To Configure Ingress
TLS/SSL Certificates in
Kubernetes
by Bibin Wilson ¬∑ March 16, 2022
In this blog, you will learn how to configure ingress TLS certificates for Kubernetes
Ingress resources.
This blog is based on an actual demo done using demo.mlopshub.com  public DNS
and its self-signed certificate. If you do not have a domain name, you can use the
workstation host file for DNS resolution or the curl resolve command.

Prerequisites and Assumptions
For this blog, the assumption is you have a working ingress controller setup, and
you want to configure TLS for your ingress resource.
This blog is part of the Kubernetes Ingress series. If you do not have an ingress
controllers setup or want to understand Kubernetes ingress concepts in detail,
please go through the following blogs first.
Obtaining Kubernetes Ingress SSL/TLS
Certificates
The basic requirement for ingress TLS is a TLS/SSL certificate. You can obtain
these certificates in the following ways.
Note: SSL & TLS are the same. SSL is the old name. TLS is the
updated version of SSL. Dont get confused üôÇ

Every SSL certificate comes with an expiry date. So you need to rotate the
certificate before it expires. For example, Letsecrypt certificates expire every three
months. I will talk about automated certificate rotation towards the end of the
article.
Also, if you are working on an internal application, most organizations have their
own PKI infrastructure for providing SSL certificates for internal applications. You
can request the network/security team to provide the certificates.
How Does Ingress TLS/SSL Work?
Adding TLS to ingress is pretty simple. All you have to do is,
Certificage Authority. It is great optionfor development environments
where you can share the rootCA with the team so that browsers can trust
the certificate. Check out create self-signed certificate blog to create
your own certificates.
Purchase an SSL Certificate:¬†You need to buy an SSL certificate from a
well-known certificate authority trusted by browsers & operating systems
for production use cases. Check out the¬†top SSL Providers¬†for more
information.

Use Letsencrpt Certificate:¬†Letsencrypt¬†is a non-profit trusted
certificate authority that provides free TLS certificates.

SSL is handled by the ingress controller, not the ingress resource. Meaning,
when you add TLS certificates to the ingress resource as a kubernetes secret, the
ingress controller access it and makes it part of its configuration.
For example, in the Nginx controller, the SSL certificates are dynamically handled
by the following block in nginx.conf
ssl_certificate_by_lua_block {
certificate.call()
}
The following diagram shows the high-level ingress TLS workflow.
Add the TLS block to the ingress resource with the exact hostname used
to generate cert that matches the TLS certificate.

Configure Ingress TLS/SSL Certificates
Let‚Äôs look a the steps in configuring TLS in ingress.

Deploy a Test Application
Let‚Äôs begin by deploying a sample application. We will use this application to test
our ingress TLS.
Create a dev namespace.
kubectl create -n dev
Save the following YAML as hello-app.yaml . It has a deployment and service
object.
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-app
  namespace: dev
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello
        image: "gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:2.0"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:

  name: hello-service
  namespace: dev
  labels:
    app: hello
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: hello
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    protocol: TCP
Deploy the test application.
kubectl apply -f hello-app.yaml 
Create a Kubernetes TLS Secret
The SSL certificate should be added as a Kubernetes secret. It will be then referred
to the ingress resources TLS block.
Let‚Äôs create a Kubernetes secret of type TLS with the server.crt  and server.key
files (SSL certificates). We are creating the secret in the dev namespace where we
Note: Here the assumption is you have the server.crt  and server.key
SSL files from a Certificate authority or your organization or self-
signed.

have a hello app deployment.
Execute the following kubectl command from the directory where you have the
server.crt  and key files or provide the absolute path of the files . hello-app-tls  is
an arbitrary name.
kubectl create secret tls hello-app-tls \
    --namespace dev \
    --key server.key \
    --cert server.crt
Following is the equivalent YAML  file where you have to add the crt and key file
contents.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: hello-app-tls
  namespace: dev
type: kubernetes.io/tls
data:
  server.crt: |
       <crt contents here>
  server.key: |
       <private key contents here>
Add TLS block to Ingress Object
The ingress resource with TLS has to be created in the same namespace where you
have the application deployed. So we create the example ingress TLS resource in
dev  namespace.

Save the following YAML as ingress.yaml . Replace demo.mlopshub.com  with your
hostname.
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: hello-app-ingress
  namespace: dev
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - demo.mlopshub.com
    secretName: hello-app-tls
  rules:
  - host: "demo.mlopshub.com"
    http:
      paths:
        - pathType: Prefix
          path: "/"
          backend:
            service:
              name: hello-service
              port:
                number: 80
As you can see, I have added the TLS block with the hostname
( demo.mlopshub.com ) and tls secret we created in the previous step. I have created
the self-signed TLS certificate with emo.mlopshub.com  domain.
tls:
  - hosts:
    - demo.mlopshub.com
    secretName: hello-app-tls
The host in the TLS block and rules block should match.

üéâ Congratulations you have deployed Ingress with TLS.
Validate Ingress TLS
You can validate the Ingress TLS using the curl command as well as the browser.
From the CLI, run the curl command as given below with your domain name.
curl https://demo.mlopshub.com -kv
In the output, under server certificate, you can validate the certificate details as
shown below.
From the browser, access the domain and click the Lock icon to view the certificate
details. If you have a valid certificate, you will see the information as shown below.

If you don‚Äôt have a valid certificate or if the ingress TLS configuration is wrong, you
will see ‚ÄúYour connection is not private‚Äù security warning and if you check the
certificate details, you will see the certificate name as ‚ÄúKubernetes Ingress
Controller Fake Certificate‚Äú.
Kubernetes Ingress Controller Fake Certificate is the default SSL certificate that
comes with the Nginx ingress controller. If you check the nginx.conf of the Nginx
controller, you will see the configured default certificates as shown below.

Ingress SSL Termination
By default, SSL gets terminated in ingress the controller
So all the traffic from the controller to the pod will be without TLS (decrypted
traffic)
If you want full SSL, you can add the supported annotation by the ingress controller
you are using. For example, In the Nginx ingress controller, to allow SSL traffic till
the application, you can use the  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol:
"HTTPS"  annotation. For this, your application should have SSL configured.
Conclusion
In this blog, we have learned to configure ingress TLS certificates with
kubernetes¬†ingress¬†TLS¬†example
Also, you can configure more TLS parameters using annotations. The
annotations differ between different ingress controllers.
