eBay and PayPal have many ways of determining your identity. This ebook is designed to help 
prevent your eBay account from being suspended or your PayPal account from being limited 
and help you to better understand why these companies operate the way they do. 
Unfortunately many of you, who are reading this ebook, have already experienced the 
frustration of having your PayPal funds frozen or ebay account suspended.  This ebook will help 
guide you through the process of getting back on eBay and PayPal.  If you’ve already been 
suspended on eBay, there are a lot of ways that eBay can detect if you are trying to open 
another eBay account.  We will show you how to prevent this from happening.  If your PayPal 
funds are being held, this ebook will provide you with some effective methods of compelling 
PayPal to release your funds.  
Before we get into all the other information included in this eBook, we must answer the million 
dollar question: 
Is There Life After PayPal? 
Are there any alternatives out there today that are as "good" as PayPal? When PayPal first 
launched back in 1999, it was obviously just about the only online payment transfer system set 
up that was actually backed by some serious venture capitalist and talented developers. In fact, 
in the beginning, PayPal was offering as much as $20 for people to sign up with them. Today, 
PayPal acts like they don't need your business at all. 
Luckily, there are several viable alternatives to PayPal. Most of these viable PayPal alternatives 
came into existence because it was realized that there was a large pool of people who were 
dissatisfied with PayPal or there were people who simply could not use PayPal anymore due to 
the fact that their accounts will limited by PayPal. All of these people needed a place to go; all 
of these people still have money that they needed to send and money that they needed to 
receive. Inventive (and in some case opportunistic) entrepreneurs saw the need and attempted 
to fill the void with their own startups and services. Over the years we've see several come and 
several go. Today, there are still several PayPal alternatives that started some time ago that are 
still with us today. They have grown, improved, and have gained a reputation for solid 
performance and customer service. 
There is "life after PayPal." First, PayPal is where it is today as THE number one e-commerce 
solution because it was one of the first companies out there to offer the service that they do. 
Second, PayPal ended up being a perfect fit for users of such popular and widely used services 
like eBay. This fact alone propelled PayPal to the number one spot. PayPal remains number one 

3
-- in spite of all their problems -- because they are being protected by eBay and because they 
are going through a phenomenal growth period where new users from around the world keep 
signing up on a daily basis. These new signups make up for the business lost by their horrible 
business practices. 
PayPal -- the company -- is broken. The company shows no willingness to change its criminal 
and fraudulent behavior. In fact, any thing that has happened in the past five years to make 
PayPal a better company, have resulted only because of litigation (a court compelled PayPal to 
make changes). That is not the kind of company you can trust with your money.  
The NoPayPal Network is packed with good reasons as to why you should not use PayPal. The 
fact that you found our network and are reading this ebook, probably means you’re already 
experienced problems with PayPal and have seen first hand the devastating effects PayPal can 
have on your business and your finances.  
PayPal is a company that you cannot rely on. We would be making a grave error in not offering 
alternatives to our members. Why? Because life goes on -- you go on. You still have to sell stuff 
or buy stuff on eBay, you still have to make a living and be able to send and receive money 
easily without a lot of hassles. You have to do all of these things -- without PayPal. The 
NoPayPal Network is pleased to present you with numerous alternatives to PayPal. You don't 
have to spend hours or days searching for a way to replace PayPal in your life. We have done 
the research for you.

INTRODUCTION 
Understanding how PayPal acts, can help you anticipate what their next likely move will be, 
regarding Your Account. 
What makes PayPal the company they are today? 
PayPal's public face is very different from the private PayPal that many of us never see. 
While PayPal denies publicly they have a customer service problem, they admit they have a 
customer service problem in private.  
While PayPal denies publicly they don't make any money off of your money, PayPal admits it in 
legal documents. PayPal publicly says their buyer protection is there for buyers, but in private 
PayPal admits the policy is there to prevent costly chargebacks.

9
Believe it or not, these are all reasons as to why PayPal can and will limit your account. With a 
limited or frozen PayPal account, you have NO access to your own money. There are many, 
many more reasons as to why PayPal will limit your account and deny you access to your 
money. Any number of things unknown to you or I can trigger such an event.  
The reason why this is so disturbing is this: once your account is limited, you have a less than 
10% chance of getting your account unlimited. That means less than a 10% chance of getting 
your account restored to its previous state -- because you made a mistake that you did not 
know was a mistake or PayPal accused you of something without having or offering any 
evidence as to your guilt.  
The simple whim of PayPal can destroy your business and your online reputation. The simple 
whim of PayPal can freeze access to funds that you need to support your family, pay bills, take 
that dream vacation or replace the busted tires on your car. 
Most disturbing of all: PayPal does not need a reason to freeze your funds and limit your 
account. Remember, PayPal says in its User Agreement (that you agreed to) that it can limit and 
freeze your funds for "any reason." 
Maybe PayPal needs a large infusion of cash for whatever reason -- or a short term loan on your 
money. PayPal can freeze accounts on a mass level for no reason at all. 
Why? Because PayPal CAN. 

10
Restoring Your PayPal Account if It Has Been Limited 
In the event that PayPal limits your account as a result of suspected fraud or other problem, 
you can restore it to its original, unrestricted state. 
If PayPal determines that you have been engaging in fraudulent or high-risk activity (such as 
selling fake merchandise or using stolen credit cards) or that you have not been abiding by the 
terms of the user agreement (e.g., you've been using PayPal to sell pornographic material or 
weapons), PayPal will impose limits on your account. Your account might also be limited if you 
initiate a bank transfer that then fails due to insufficient funds or if you accept a payment that 
is later disputed by its sender. 
PayPal often limits the account's access to certain features, such as sending, withdrawing, or 
even receiving money. This helps protect any other PayPal users with whom you've been 
dealing and helps reduce subsequent losses that PayPal would otherwise have to incur. 
You know that PayPal has limited your account when your Account Overview page has a pink 
box that says Account Access Limited. As you might expect, click the "Click here for details" link 
for an explanation. 
PayPal prides itself on being good at spotting high-risk behavior, but they also recognize that 
not all high-risk transactions are necessarily fraudulent or bad and not all disputes are the 
seller's fault. Thus, PayPal has an appeals process for those who have had their accounts 
limited. 
Filing an Appeal 
Needless to say, the best thing you can do if your account has been limited is to precisely follow 
the instructions on the web site and in the notification email you receive. Often, this entails 
completing a sequence of steps to provide PayPal with evidence of ownership of the PayPal 
account, ownership of the financials attached to the account, and verification of your own 
identity and address. 
Only after you have completed all the required steps will a PayPal Account Review 
Representative review your account. For instance, if PayPal asks you to fax several documents, 

11
your account will not be reviewed until you submit all requested documents and have 
completed all the remaining steps. 
In addition, make sure to double-check the email you received notifying you of your account's 
limited access, because the PayPal Account Review Representative might have added extra 
steps for you to complete that are not listed on the web site. For instance, if you are a seller on 
eBay, PayPal will likely request tracking information for items you've delivered and proof of 
inventory for additional items you're currently selling. 
If you lose the email, you might not necessarily be able to find all the steps to complete on the 
PayPal web site; in this case, your best bet is to call PayPal. However, if you no longer have 
access to your email account, you might have bigger problems to deal with than just your 
limited account. 
A Last Resort 
If you're really in a bind and cannot complete the steps requested of you for legitimate reasons, 
you can always escalate your issue by writing a letter to a PayPal executive, contacting the 
Better Business Bureau, or working with a legal representative. 
Escalation in itself is not a guarantee that your issue will be resolved, but if your issue is 
legitimate, it is likely that a new pair of eyes, perhaps with more experience and background, 
will look at your issue and help reach a fair resolution. 
Avoiding Suspicion 
To prevent your account from being limited in the first place, keep your account in order by 
following these guidelines: 
•
Treat your PayPal account as you would your bank account: use secret passwords and
keep them to yourself!
•
Make sure your true name is on your PayPal account and that it matches the name on
your bank and credit card accounts. If you are a business, make sure the bank account
and credit card on your account are also in your business name.
•
Use accurate addresses and phone numbers that match those on your credit card and
bank account, and keep them current. False contact information can raise suspicion on
your account and make it more difficult to regain access.
•
Delete old or obsolete bank accounts and credit cards from your account. If you do not
keep your account up-to-date, you might find yourself in a bind when your account is
limited and PayPal asks you to prove ownership of a bank account with an old address.
•
If you are a seller, always use electronically trackable shipping methods so that if the
shipment or receipt of a physical good is in doubt, you can easily prove your case. Also
make sure to keep proof of inventory or merchandise, such as receipts, invoices, or

12
proof of authenticity for older, collectible items. Maintain good relationships with your 
suppliers so that you can easily access this information when you need it. 
•
If you have any old or abandoned PayPal accounts, make sure to resolve your issues
with those accounts and then close them. If your account has been limited and PayPal
sees linked accounts with issues, such as a negative balance or outstanding buyer
complaints, PayPal will probably ask you to resolve those issues as well before they'll be
willing to lift the limitation on your active account.
Nuke PayPal With Complaints 
If PayPal freezes your account for no reason and denies you access to your money for 6 months 
or more, or even though you were the victim of fraud and PayPal sided with the scammer, your 
options for getting your money back and/or being compensated for your loss boils down to 
three options: You can try to work it out with PayPal, you can take PayPal to court (small claims 
or a higher court) or you can file complaints that will pressure PayPal to see things your way. 
If you are here, that means you are considering filing a complaint against PayPal. If you are 
considering this, be sure that you have exhausted all of your options in terms of negotiating 
with PayPal first. That means, if you are having PayPal problems, do not file a complaint against 
PayPal until you have contacted PayPal and tried to resolve the issue with them.  
This is important for a couple of reasons. First, if you file a complaint against PayPal without 
dealing with them first (even though WE know that does little to no good), you will be informed 
by the persons or agencies that you are making complaints to to contact PayPal first and try to 
resolve the issue with them first. Your complaint will then go nowhere. Second, it is important 
to contact PayPal first because you can gather all of the evidence that you need to do PayPal 
real damage when you file your complaint. Without some kind of evidence showing that you 
attempted to work the problem out with PayPal, your complaint will either be dismissed or 
rendered completely useless. 
When contacting PayPal with your problem, first attempt to communicate with them via email. 
After you have sent them an email, immediately go to the telephone and call PayPal. Do not tell 
PayPal that you have sent them an email on this issue. Write down what time you called, what 
you said, and what the PayPal representative said. If you can get that person's first name, write 
that down as well.  
After you get off the phone with PayPal, evaluate if what transpired helps you or solves 
nothing. Wait an hour or more and call PayPal again. With any luck you will have a different 
customer service representative. Go through your whole problem again WITHOUT 
MENTIONING that you called before about the same problem.  

13
Based on that information, go through the motions of trying to comply with what PayPal wants 
of you. Now, check your email and see if PayPal has replied. If PayPal has replied, write down 
how long it took them to reply. Copy the email and keep it together with your original email 
that you sent them. 
After looking at what you have thus far, I bet that what the people at PayPal told you is 
different than what your email is saying. I bet that what PayPal told you over the telephone is 
different than what somebody else at PayPal told you over the phone! You are now building 
evidence against PayPal to use in your complaints. 
Based on the information that you have thus far, this is how it all pieces together. Here is an 
incomplete complaint letter showing how this fits together: 
I have been a PayPal account holder for 1 year. I recently sold a computer via eBay. I received 
payment for my computer via the PayPal service. After I received the money into my PayPal 
account I shipped the computer to my buyer. When I logged into my PayPal account PayPal told 
me was account was frozen and I could not have access to my money! PayPal accused me of 
"suspicious activity." That is ridiculous! Paypal asked me to fax them a copy of my ID, credit card 
statement and utility bill showing my address. I did this and PayPal still won't let me have my 
money! 
(Here comes the info you just collected) 
I contacted PayPal via email -- it took them three days to reply. When I did get the reply it had 
NOTHING to do with what I had written. They are jerking me around. A copy of my email and 
PayPal's reply is attached. I called PayPal TWICE -- On January 16 at 3PM and January 17 at 
630PM. The first time the customer rep (John -- he would not give me his last name or an 
employee number or anything) told me XXXXXXXXXX. That did not help me in the least. I then 
called PayPal again and this customer service representative (Janice) told me something 
completely different! She told me XXXXXXXXX.  
PayPal will not even provide me with evidence showing me what this "suspicious activity was." 
But I had to supply PayPal with plenty of very private information! In the end the refuse to give 
me my money back!  
Obviously there will be much more to your complaint -- and your complaint will be customized 
towards who you are complaining to (example: your complaint would differ based on if you 
were writing to a federal law enforcement center verses complaining to a state agency 
concerned with money transfer issues).  
Next, you have to decide WHY you are complaining and WHAT YOU WANT. It does not help to 
complain unless you describe what you want. In our above example you are showing that 
PayPal is unfair and conducting questionable and illegal business practices to hold your money 
(for its benefit). You are also describing in your complaint what you want: you want PayPal to 

14
return your money NOW. Not in 6 months, not next week and not tomorrow. You want your 
money now. By saying what you want, it will make it easier for the persons or agencies you are 
complaining to contact PayPal and pressure them to return your money. If, in this example, you 
did not say what you wanted, the persons or agencies that you complained to might only 
contact PayPal about their questionable business practices -- and not the fact that you want 
your money back. So decide WHY you are complaining and decide WHAT YOU WANT. 
Once you have contacted PayPal and gone through the motions of contacting PayPal to resolve 
the issue, and once you have gathered all of your documentation and evidence, you are ready 
to take on PayPal.  
If you want to avoid court or having to file lawsuits to solve your PayPal problem, you have to 
get other people to fight your cause for you -- for free. That is where "federal resources" come 
in. There are government agencies -- and national complaints organizations -- who will take 
your complaint and then take it to PayPal. These government agencies and organizations carry 
far more weight, power and influence than any letter that you could write to PayPal yourself. 
Often times, PayPal will cave in to your demands and solve your problem just from having these 
agencies and organizations contact them and threaten them with further action should they 
continue with their behavior. 
That is the factor that you must count on: The pressure from these organizations and the 
pressure that PayPal will feel from receiving other complaints from thousands of others. It will 
be cheaper and less risky to solve your problem than to have PayPal challenged by a federal 
government agency or court. 
To begin the process of getting your money back you can file your complaint with the following 
federal organizations: 
Your United States Senators 
Every state has two United States Senators. These two people are elected on a state wide basis 
and represent your entire state in Washington D.C.. Your United States Senators have 
enormous power and enormous influence. A simple letter or phone call from a U.S. Senator's 
office can move mountains or force dogs and cats to sleep together. 
Why will they help you? Every United States Senator has an office that deals with constituent 
complaints involving a number of issues -- every problem imaginable are handled by your 
United States Senators' office. Second, they want to get re-elected. Unlike PayPal, your 
government representatives serve at the pleasure of the voters. They figure if they can help 
you, you will be grateful and vote for them in the next election. Fair trade.  
Contact your TWO United States's Senators with your PayPal problem. Don't forget to include 
why you think PayPal was unjust to you and mention the fact that PayPal has a history of 

15
screwing its customers. You may submit your complaint via email or you may write them a 
letter. 
http://www.senate.gov  (When you get there, look in the upper right corner of the page to find 
your U.S. Senator) 
Your United States Congressman/Woman 
Unlike Senators, where every state has two, your state has anywhere from one to over 50 
United States Congressman/woman. These people are elected in districts. In your congressional 
district, you have ONE United States Congressman/woman. Like U.S. Senators, these people 
have a huge amount of power and influence. Like Senators, members of Congress deal with a 
huge amount of voter problems -- you name the topic, and they can and will help you. One 
phone call or letter from them can solver your PayPal problem. 
You can contact your member of Congress via email or write them a letter. 
https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml 
The United States Department of Justice  
The Department of Justice is the federal government's chief law enforcement agency and 
prosecutorial office.  
You can file a complaint with them via email or write them a letter. 
http://www.justice.gov 
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
The FTC deals with issues that touch the economic life of every American. It is the only federal 
agency with both consumer protection and competition jurisdiction in broad sectors of the 
economy. The FTC pursues vigorous and effective law enforcement; advances consumers’ 
interests... In short, these are the guys that PayPal is really afraid of. You can file your complaint 
with them online. 
https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov 

16
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
Why in the world would anybody complaint to these guys? Don't they have something to do 
with the stock market or something? You are correct, they regulate all companies that are 
trading stock publicly. They also are very concerned with companies who engage in fraudulent 
activity which might manipulate their stock price and give investors a false picture of the truth 
of a company's heath. 
Your approach is this: PayPal freezes customer accounts so they can artificially inflate the 
amount of cash reserves that they have (remember, your money is held in pooled bank 
accounts under PayPal's name). This is an issue the SEC would be very interested in. Who 
knows, maybe PayPal is involved in some kind of fishy accounting practices (remember Enron?). 
You can file a complaint with the SEC online. 
http://www.sec.gov/complaint/select.shtml 
The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) 
Report PayPal to this feared and effective government task force. Your aim here is to highlight 
the criminal and fraudulent nature of PayPal's activities. You must be able to detail how PayPal 
wronged you and stole your money. 
http://www.ic3.gov/complaint/default.aspx 
Council of the Better Business Bureau 
The Better Business Bureau is another group that PayPal has to answer to -- first because it has 
enormous influence and second, PayPal is a member. 
http://www.bbb.org

Suing PayPal in Small Claims Court 
So you have decided to sue PayPal. You've got all your papers filled out and you are ready to go 
to the post office. There's just ONE problem: You have no idea where to send your legal papers. 
All states require proper service of your legal papers. Proper service includes sending your 
papers to the right place. If you send your legal papers to the wrong address, PayPal can force 
dismissal of your lawsuit based on the grounds that you "improperly served" them.  
Remember, it's PayPal's goal to stay out of courtrooms -- they know they cannot win if they 
must argue the merits of their case. However, one of the ways they will try to beat you is on a 
technicality. Don't let them beat you because you got the address wrong.

PayPal User Agreement Exposed 
Finally, the PayPal User Agreement EXPOSED (a.k.a. Terms of Service Agreement)! 
From the first sentence to the last, we uncovered all the details for you! Since PayPal became a 
major player in the online payments market, PayPal's user agreement has been modified 
hundreds of times -- and unless ordered by a court or a regulatory body -- the terms are NEVER 
in our favor.  
Read the entire PayPal User Agreement along with our line-by-line commentary; you will be 
shocked by what PayPal expects you to "agree" to.

Protecting Yourself From Buyer Fraud 
Use PayPal's Seller Protection Policy to ensure that you don't lose money to fraudulent 
payments. 
Whether you use PayPal as a buyer or a seller, you need to be on the lookout for fraud. If you 
don't take the proper steps to protect yourself, PayPal might need to retract a payment from 
your account, even after you've filled the customer's order. 
For instance, a credit card holder can dispute any credit card payment, even after you've 
received the payment and delivered the goods or service the customer agreed to buy. This is 
the customer's right and it can be an effective means of buyer protection, but dishonest buyers 
can also abuse this service to intimidate or cheat honest sellers. 
Furthermore, a person using a PayPal account to pay you might have hijacked the account from 
its rightful owner, or someone might have funded a PayPal payment with a stolen credit card. 
Either way, the rightful owner will, understandably, dispute any such charges once she has 
discovered them. 
PayPal's Seller Protection Policy can mitigate the risk, often to the point of allowing you to keep 
disputed funds, but the best way to avoid fraud is to spot it going in. Here are some ways to 
minimize your risk as a seller. 
Qualifying for Seller Protection 
If you are a U.S. or Canadian seller dealing with U.S. buyers or a UK seller transacting with UK or 
U.S. buyers, you might qualify for PayPal's Seller Protection Policy, which covers up to $5,000 
per year of reversals. To qualify, you must do all of the following: 
•
Ship a tangible product.
•
Ship only to a confirmed shipping address.
•
Ship promptly and use some form of package tracking.
•
Respond quickly to any complaints, either from the customer or from PayPal.
•
Meet additional requirements discussed at https://www.paypal.com/sellerprotection
and http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_spp-outside.
If you follow these guidelines diligently, you might be able to avoid losses to buyer fraud 
completely. 

20
Possibly the best indicator of a buyer's reputability is his accounts Status. Holders of verified  
accounts have shown PayPal that they are in fact in control of the email addresses on file with 
PayPal and have legitimate bank accounts. PayPal trusts these members more than unverified 
account holders, so it makes sense for you to trust them as well. 
Your prospective buyer's account creation date tells you how long the buyer has been a PayPal 
member. Buyers using relatively new PayPal accounts or accounts with low reputation numbers 
have a short track record as PayPal members, but this doesn't mean they can't be trusted. 
However, you might want to avoid doing business with buyers until they become better 
established. A long-standing account is less likely to have been set up with the commission of 
fraud in mind. On the other hand, accounts of any age can, and sometimes are, hijacked by 
phishers and crackers. 
Conducting a Little Reconnaissance 
Here are some tips to help you decide whether to do business with any particular person: 
If you're at all suspicious, take it one step further and look for any recent purchasing activity 
that appears out of the ordinary (such as numerous high-value items). At the eBay site, go to 
SearchBy Bidder, type the customer's user ID, indicate that you want to include completed 
items, and click Search. 
Consider the buyer's reputation. In addition to the user status information provided by PayPal, 
do you have other sources you can use to gather information? If you're conducting business via 
eBay or another auction site, check your buyer's feedback rating or community reputation. 
Also, look for a history of fraud or payment disputes in the recent comments from other sellers. 
Contact the buyer. For any item, especially one that is expensive and easily resold, it makes 
sense to contact the buyer directly. Email to confirm purchase details or on the premise of 
confirming that the product will really suit the buyer's needs. Be particularly wary if the buyer 
takes little interest in your questions. Some social engineering and a nose for fraud can save 
major headaches. 
Use common sense. If you sell only Beanie Babies, ball bearings, and body oil on your 
eCommerce web site and a single buyer suddenly orders ten boxes, bushels, and bottles of 
each, ask a few questions before shipping. 
In the end, you will probably choose to do business with most of the customers you encounter. 
But a little common sense and awareness can protect you from most types of fraud. 

21
Protecting Yourself From Chargebacks 
Reduce or eliminate the risk of having disputed payments reversed from your PayPal account. 
A chargeback is the result of a credit card charge being rejected by the credit card holder, 
typically in cases where the credit card was stolen and used fraudulently. But such charges can 
also be disputed by customers who feel that they've been defrauded by sellers. 
If you accept credit cards, in person or through PayPal, you might encounter a chargeback from 
a buyer, just as a seller accepting personal checks might receive an occasional bad check. 
Chargebacks are an unfortunate but realistic cost of doing business, so most sellers factor this 
cost into their business plans. 
When a customer initiates a chargeback with his or her credit card company, PayPal may 
deduct the amount of the transaction from your account if you're not covered under PayPal's 
Seller Protection Policy. All sellers who accept credit card payments run this risk and might be 
liable for chargebacks. 
Even if you have a low-volume online business, you cannot avoid the risk of chargebacks. 
According to a study by the Gartner Group, approximately 1.1% of online transactions are 
estimated to result in fraudulent buyer chargebacks. That's like paying an extra 1.1% fee for 
each and every transaction! Of course, chargeback risk varies a good deal depending on the 
type of goods you sell, but nearly everyone who accepts credit card payments faces some 
chargeback risk. 
Of course, none of this applies to non-credit card transactions, such as payments funded by a 
bank account transfer or PayPal balance. 
Protecting Yourself 
Whereas most merchant account providers and payment companies simply pass all of the 
chargeback risks and associated fees and liabilities on to sellers, PayPal is different. As long as 
you follow PayPal's guidelines (the Seller Protection Policy outlines these guidelines), PayPal 
helps protect you against fraudulent chargebacks. 
Be sure to familiarize yourself with this policy; click the User Agreement link on the bottom of 
any page on the PayPal web site, and then click Seller Protection Policy. When you follow the 
policy's guidelines strictly, PayPal protects you from chargeback liability on all qualified 

22
transactions. In addition, PayPal takes chargeback claims seriously and, when appropriate, 
investigates and vigorously contests chargebacks on your behalf. 
PayPal is able to guarantee protection against reversal of funds only if a chargeback occurs for 
nonreceipt of the product or in the event of an unauthorized charge (resulting from a stolen 
credit card or account takeover). Even then, you're entitled to this protection only if you have 
followed the terms of the Seller Protection Policy. 
Here are some best practices you should follow to prevent chargebacks from occurring: 
•
Make sure the item you're selling is described (on your site or in your eBay listing) in as
much detail and as accurately as possible. You should not assume that simply providing
a picture in your listing will sufficiently answer any quality questions that your
customers might have. Avoid merely stating that the merchandise is being sold "as-is."
This won't protect you as much as you might expect. A detailed item description will
help your defense in the event that a buyer claims that your item was not as described.
•
Get to know your customers. Although selling in an online environment doesn't make it
easy to build a face-to-face rapport, it doesn't have to keep you from learning about
your customers. While the volume of your business might prevent you from contacting
all your buyers, you should make every effort to respond to any customer inquiries
regarding the transaction or the purchased items, both before and after the transaction.
Plus, this practice will help get you more repeat customers.
•
Keep any and all records and correspondence with your customers. This allows you to
provide further evidence that you adequately described the item to the customer or
responded to the customer's inquiries.

23
Getting Back On Ebay/PayPal After Being Suspended 
First, you must understand that eBay records much of your data for later use. Not only do they record 
data you filled out in their seller application form (name, address, phone number, SSN, credit card, 
paypal email), they also logged your IP address, computer hardware code (lan card MAC number), 
computer name, workgroup name etc. You may not even know about these items yourself, but yes eBay 
logs the things you don't know. They have the right to do so because you have agreed it once you 
agreed their terms of service as an eBay member. 
So to rejoin eBay again, you have to renew all items aforementioned. Here is a simple check list for your 
easy reference. 
1.
Change your LAN card AND hard drive so that both hardware codes will go not the same.
2.
Change your login username, either use a common name like "peter" or "mary". Use
"Administrator" is the best because it is default to Windows OS. It is stupid to use your last email
ID registered and shut down on eBay
3.
Change your computer name in your OS (typically Windows XP or Vista). Use some generic name
like "my computer" or "pc at home".
4.
Change your internet service provider, or request a new fixed IP address. If you are connected
with dynamic IP you can skip this step. Ask your ISP if you don't know if you are connecting with
fixed or dynamic IP. To view your IP address visit http://www.whatismyipaddress.com
5.
Call your credit card company and ask for a different card number. It will be even less suspicious
to eBay if you will use a card with different card holder name. (Think about adding a family
member or friend as a user on the bank account. Get them their own check card. Use theirs.)
6.
Get a new mailing address. (you can find companies that do this for a small fee, search online)
7.
Get a new phone number (cell phone number is acceptable). (check google voice, which is free)
8.
Give credit card company your new mailing address for your monthly statement.
9.
Re-register on eBay using your real name, the new address and phone number but ALWAYS a
different email address. Do NOT use email from your private domain. Use those free emails
from Google, Yahoo, MSN, or whatever.
10. Open a new Paypal account with new banking account/credit card/email/mailing address
connected.
11. If at all possible, acquiring a new/different computer, which has never had an ebay or paypal
account associated with it, would be a good idea. The key is covering all your tracks. Becoming a
new entity.
12. Consider using a virtual private network or proxy every time you connect to PayPal or eBay.
* If you have any questions about the items listed above, you can look up the information on any
search engine. 

24
Now when you log in to eBay, their computer sees a different PC, coming from a different service 
provider, with a different home address, and a different email address. 
Ever wonder if eBay server is that powerful to log so many personal data from your computer 
secretly? Do the follow two simple tests in your spare time. 
Test 1: 
1.
Go into DOS mode from your Windows - http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chdos.htm
2.
Enter this line to prompt "ftp -A download.speedtest.com.hk". You don't really need to
download anything. That is a public server in Hong Kong for internet connection speed test.
Purpose of this ftp is to show you how that server will log your entry.
3.
Once you are connected to the FTP server, you will see this line "Anonymous login succeeded
for XXX@YYYcomputer".
4.
You should now understand how your username XXX and computer name YYYcomputer are
logged easily by a server.
Test 2: 
1.
Visit http://whatismyipaddress.com
2.
These are just two simple ways for you to see how your personal data is being recorded by third
parties with relative ease.
At times your local eBay office may call your phone to verify your existence and accessibility. So
your phone number must be real and accessible (Think number forwarding “google voice”).
Remember, eBay is not clairvoyant, just eliminate the traceable factors, and on you go. No
magic solution needed.

Understanding How eBay and PayPal Detect Your Creation of 
Multiple Accounts 
eBay is able to link your accounts based on Your IP Address, Web browser as well as Flash 
cookies, and Private Account Information. Both EBay and PayPal store temporary Internet files 
on your computer every time you login to your account.  That is why it is important to clear 
your cookies and a temporary Internet file is a must prior to accessing your account.    
Additionally, the information that you provide when setting up your eBay or PayPal account 
such as personal information, bank account number, phone number, etc., will flag your 
account.   
Deleting Your Browser and Flash Cookies 
We recommend that you delete your browser cookies and flash objects before proceeding from

How To Change, Renew, and Release Your IP Addresses 
To see your own IP Address, please visit http://www.whatismyipaddress.com 
What exactly is an IP Address?  (Internet Protocol address) The address of a 
device attached to an IP network (TCP/IP network). Every client, server and 
network device is assigned an IP address, and every IP packet traversing an IP 
network contains a source IP address and a destination IP address. 
Remember, EBay always saves your IP address each time you login to your eBay 
or PayPal account so make sure you don’t accidentally login with a suspended IP 

26
address.   We recommend contacting your Internet provider to make certain you 
own a dynamic IP address or changing your IP address.  For those of you that 
have a cable modem, and are directly connected without the use of a network or 
router you must release your IP address.   
Also, keep a log of your IP Address and always verify your IP address at 
http://www.whatismyipaddress.com before you sign in to your EBay/PayPal Accounts. 
Instructions for changing your IP address please visit

PayPal Alternatives 
Screw-PayPal.com recommends the following services for use as a PayPal alternative for eBay 
use. The list used to review all of these services were taken from eBay's own "Accepted 
Payments Policy." Screw-PayPal.com had no choice but to pick from the list that eBay provided. 
While there are a lot of great services out there that would fit very well with eBay, eBay bans 
those services for your use. Therefore, if you want to use eBay WITHOUT using PayPal, you are 
limited in which services you can use to make and receive payments. Again, the following is a 
list of services that Screw-PayPal.com recommends for use with eBay:  
PayPal Alternatives: For use on eBay 
Merchantinc.com -- Recommended for US and International Sellers 
Merchantinc.com Provides eBay Compatible credit card processing services for US and 
International Sellers. The company has been in business for over 10 years and is a well-known 
provider of online payment processing solutions. After researching over 40 U.S. merchant account 
providers, we have Merchantinc.com because of their no setup/no cancellation fees approach. 
Their monthly fees for website processing, along with eBay processing, is only $7.95, a far 
better value than most companies we researched. Additionally, their transaction fees are 
LOWER than PayPal. Included with their services is an eBay compatible shopping cart system, 
Secure Payment Gateway and Merchant Account. The application process takes about 5 
minutes, is completely online, and most people are ready to begin accepting credit cards the 
same day. I have stressed before, the benefits of using a traditional merchant account over 
PayPal, for many reasons, among them, your funds are deposited directly into your bank 
account, NOT a PAYPAL ACCOUNT! This gives you far more control of your money and your 
business. Plus, with a merchant account, your funds are protected by federal banking 
regulations "Since your merchant account is provided by a real US bank". Unfortunately, PayPal 

28
is not considered a bank in the United States, and therefore it does not have to adhere to 
federal banking guidelines. 
PROS: Reliable, Secure Payment processing solution. Accepted on Ebay. No setup fees. No 
cancellation fees. Very low rates. Easy to setup. Perfect for use on websites as well.  
CONS: Only Compatible with eBay for US EBAYERS. International Merchants can still use the 
service to accept all major credit cards OUTSIDE OF EBAY.
OVERALL: Highly recommended as an alternative to PayPal and as an alternative to receiving 
online payments. This is one of my personal favorites. Sign up and take it for a test drive -- you 
won't be sorry!  
 
http://www.merchantinc.com 
Allpay.net -- Recommended for U.K. Only 
This payment service is approved for use on all eBay sites around the world including the 
United States and Europe. This company is based in the United Kingdom. It has a rock solid 
reputation (even collecting payments for various local and state governments) and a customer 
service that is fast, efficient and caring. This should be a top PayPal alternative to residents and 
citizens of the United Kingdom for use on eBay and for general use as well. While it is approved 
for us on eBay, the service is USELESS for residents of the United States and Canada. The service 
can be used in western Europe (Example: The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany) 
THE SERVICE: Allpay.net is an umbrella company providing many e-commerce solutions. Users 
must sign up for services INDIVIDUALLY. The services offered include Swipe card payments, 
direct debit, internet payments, mobile phone payments, general bill payments and their online 
payment service Go&Pay. Go&Pay is what you would sign up for when you want to accept 
payments on eBay, make a payment on eBay or a general online payment that is non-eBay 
related. 
http://www.screw-paypal.com/alternatives/screen_shot_go&pay.html (Screenshot) 
PROS: Backed by a respected and well managed company, merchants can accept cash or debit 
card payments online, gives merchant's customers more online payment options, works 

29
seamlessly with other payment options offered by the company, gives consumers the option of 
paying for online purchases with cash or debit cards, consumers can make online credit card 
payments, buyers and sellers are protected from fraud, and is easy to use. Reasonable fees are 
a major plus.  
CONS: Trying to figure out HOW to sign up can be confusing -- you really have to search. This 
system was not designed for use in major markets like the United States. They do not offer a 
FAQ on how to use their service. You have to learn or contact their customer service. 
OVERALL: Excellent e-commerce solution for those who want to buy and sell on eBay, make 
general online payments and be able to accept online payments for their business -- if you are 
resident of the United Kingdom. NOT recommended for users of the United States, Canada, 
Australia, etc. 
http://www.allpay.net 
CertaPay -- Recommended for CANADA Only 
This service is approved by eBay -- however, it would seem that only eBay Canada would be the 
place where this payment service could be used. All other markets are not available because 
this service is only for persons with Canadian bank accounts. This service is used to send money 
to an email account using money from your bank account. CertaPay is owned by Acxsys 
Corporation. They are a financially solid and reputable company.  
http://www.screw-paypal.com/alternatives/screen_shot_certapay.html (Screenshot) 
THE SERVICE: A person can send money straight from their bank account to a person with an 
email account. To be able to send money, the user must have a Canadian bank account. To be 
able to receive money, the user must have an email address AND a Canadian bank account. The 
service can used to send money to friends and family, pay fees for services, make internet 
auction payments, make online payments to those who accept the service, and so on. 
PROS: Can send money person-to-person, accept auction payments, make online purchases 
including those at auctions, offer it as a web payment solution for your online business and be 
protected by the best seller protection policy I have ever seen: once you get your money, there 
is no way for CertaPay to take it back -- the only way to get the money back is for the seller to 
give it back. In the demo copy this site was able to use (thanks to corporate relations at 
CertaPay), the user interface was easy to use and the whole thing was up and running in 15 
minutes. Customer service is friendly and responsive. Finding their telephone number and 

30
email address for customer support was a breeze. Emails are answered usually within one 
business day. Customer friendly user agreement with no frozen or limited account clauses. Plus 
it is free to receive money with this service. A business person would not have to worry about 
fees eating away at profits.  
CONS: This great service is ONLY AVAILABLE in Canada. It is not clear how much it costs to send 
money. Each bank that allows account holders to use this service charges different fees -- that is 
a con for people wanted to send money. The service does not allow Canadians to send or 
receive money to an international audience -- not even Canada's neighbor, the United States. 
Buyers who use this service must beware as they will have no protection once they send money 
to a seller. Once the money is sent, there is no way to get the money back unless the seller 
agrees to a refund.  
OVERALL: Recommended for ALL Canadian residents. While this service offers a limited 
audience, a seller could make a good living with this or her online business catering only to 
other Canadians. A buyer could benefit from this service by using it to pay for auctions and 
other online businesses located in Canada. As a bonus, this service can be used to send money 
person-to-person. That makes sending money to friends and family really easy. It makes it easy 
to send money to anybody the user wants to do business with (again, as long as they have a 
Canadian bank account).  
http://www.interac.ca 
Nochex -- Recommended for U.K. Residents and Certain Others 
This is another service offered by a company based in the United Kingdom. This company leans towards 
being a merchant account, but also offers personal and seller accounts. Overall, they offer a way to be 
able to send payments as well as receive payments. 
THE SERVICE: This service offers its customers a merchant account, a sellers account or a 
personal account. The merchant account allows sellers to accept payments from the United 
Kingdom and around the world (credit cards, debit cards, etc). The sellers account allows you to 
receive payments only from within the U.K.. The personal account is for sending and receiving 
money between persons (including auction transactions). However, the personal account 
comes with certain limits (such as you cannot receive more than 90 British Pounds per day or 
send more than 300 British Pounds per day). Residents of the United States, Canada, Australia, 
and Western Europe can sign up for the merchant account. You MUST BE a resident of the 

31
United Kingdom to get the sellers account. The personal account -- to send money to make 
purchases -- is available beyond the borders of the United Kingdom. 
http://www.screw-paypal.com/alternatives/screen_shot_nochex.html 
PROS: Offers different accounts to meet different needs. Merchant and personal accounts are 
available to users around the world. Merchant account allows for receiving payments from 
around the world. Fees are surprisingly low and very competitive. The user interface needs a 
little work, but overall you can find what you are looking for fast. Reports can be generated and 
business statistics viewed. Withdrawing your money is easy and hassle free. Easy integration 
into your website or eBay auction. A bonus is each merchant account receives an assigned 
account manager. You'll speak with the same person every time should you have questions or 
concerns about your account. The personal account is also easy to use with no steep learning 
curve. Making online payments with the account is fast and trouble free. Funding the account is 
also simple. Customer service is easy to find through email, online forums, and over the phone. 
The application process is not complicated and you get an answer back within 48 hours.  
CONS: Some U.S. and Canadian users might be scared off because this is a British company. 
None of the services offers instant sign up -- you must apply for the account you are interested 
in. You can either be approved or denied. Not widely used outside of the United Kingdom. 
More U.S. and Canadian users would have to sign up for this service to make a dent in eBay. 
However, buyers from all over the world will still be able to click your Nochex payment button 
and pay you.  
OVERALL: If you are approved for the service, it is excellent. Persons from the United Kingdom 
should definitely be interested in this. Users from the United States and other countries would 
find the merchant account PERFECT for their needs. I like the merchant account I have, and 
would recommend it to almost anybody.  
http://www.nochex.com 
Ozpay.biz -- NOT REVIEWED 
While this service is still listed with eBay as an approved service to use on their site, the company closed 
in late 2006. The website now is only a site in which you can send in payments for Oz Digital Products 
purchased via eBay Australia. NOTE: This company was owned by PayPal -- so if it were still around, we 

32
would have not recommended it because of that. Why? PayPal problems would have followed you to 
Ozpay as well. PayPal makes it very clear in its User Agreement that it shares information with sister 
companies on a regular basis.  
It would be nice if eBay kept their "Accepted Payments Policy" current. 
Paymate -- Recommended for Australia & New Zealand 
This service, Paymate, is an Sydney, Australia based company that has websites for both its Australia 
users and its New Zealand users. This service is approved by eBay for use on all of its websites. However, 
the service is only available to residents of these two countries. This company is fairly solid meeting all 
of the local and federal licensing requirements.  
THE SERVICE: If you are selling something on eBay, another auction site, have an online 
business or website, Australian sellers (and New Zealand) can receive payments from over 37 
different countries. Buyers do not have to register in order to send a payment. As long as a 
seller is accepting Paymate as a payment option, buyers can send their money easily. Paymate 
offers its sellers several different types of seller's accounts -- ranging from the standard account 
to high volume accounts. Money is deposited directly into your Australian bank account. Sellers 
are able to put payment buttons in their auctions and in their websites to initiate a payment 
transaction. 
http://www.screw-paypal.com/alternatives/screen_shot_paymate.html (Screenshot) 
PROS: Sellers from this region have a great alternative to PayPal. Australian sellers can still sell 
items on eBay USA and use Paymate as a payment alternative to PayPal. Sellers can receive 
money from over 37 different countries -- that means buyers from over 37 countries can use 
this service to buy what they are looking for. Fees are very reasonable: a seller could easily 
make a profit using Paymate. The overall payment service is designed to send money email-to-
email. That makes this service even easier. Buyers can register for a buyers account or can 
make payments as a non-registered member. That is a nice choice to have. I got to log into a 

33
friend's seller account from where I am (with no negative consequences from Paymate, i.e., 
frozen or limited account) and check out the user interface. The user interface is stripped down 
and no nonsense. Everything was easy to find.  
CONS: Buyers have to pay to use the service -- I find the fees a little high (fees topping out at 
.50 cents Australian plus 3% of the transaction. That could be high enough to keep buyers away. 
However, if enough sellers start using this, the buyers will come. I found the User Agreement to 
be a little PayPalesque -- but I was able to dig up no significant media reports, court filings, 
consumer complaints or other discord about the service.  
OVERALL: Australians can really use this to make some money and move products. Payments 
come from an international audience -- and there is nothing stopping Aussies from listing on 
Ebay USA and using this service as their accepted form of payment. With all their money being
