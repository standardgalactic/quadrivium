Electrochemical Gradient 

Equilibrium Potential 
ion channels 
Specific, gated, bidirectional 

Equilibrium Potentials 
Na+ moves down its concentration 
gradient until the electrical gradient (+ charges) 
oppose further movement. ENa = + 60mV. 

Equilibrium Potentials 
K+ moves down its concentration 
gradient until the electrical  
gradient (+ charges) oppose  
further movement. EK =  - 90mV.   

Na+/K+ ATPase establishes the 
chemical concentration 
gradient for Na & K and sets  
up a small electrical  
gradient by pumping more 
positive ions (Na) out.   
Greater net movement of K+ leaving (K+ leak) than Na+ entering 
makes the resting membrane potential negative on the inside.

Depolarization = less negative than resting membrane potential (i.e., closer to zero) 
Overshoot = inside more + relative to outside (i.e., reversal of polarity) 
Repolarizing = becoming more negative but still above resting potential 
Hyperpolarization = more negative than resting potential (further from zero) 
Changes in Membrane Potential 

confined to a  
small region &  
decaying over 
distance  
(decremental) 
vary in size &  
proportionate  
to the intensity  
of the stimulus.

Key Concepts 
 
•
The equilibrium potential of an ion is when the chemical 
gradient and the electrical gradient are equal in magnitude 
but opposite in direction.  
 
•
The Na/K+ ATPase re-equilibrates the resting membrane 
potential. Inactivation of the  Na/K+ ATPase will lead to 
depolarization over time as K+ leaks out and Na+ enters, 
dissipating the resting membrane potential.  
 
•
Graded potentials are electrical signals that are local, vary 
with intensity of the stimulus, can summate, can be 
stimulatory or inhibitory, and have no refractory period.
