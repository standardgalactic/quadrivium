About the Author
Joel McNamara first got involved with digital maps in the early
1980s. At the time, he was studying archaeology. Instead of going
out and playing Indiana Jones, he found himself in front of a com-
puter monitor trying to predict where archeological sites were
located based on LANDSAT satellite data.
The lure of computers ultimately led to his defection from academia
to the software industry, where he worked as a programmer, techni-
cal writer, and manager, eventually ending up at a rather large soft-
ware company based in Redmond, Washington. Joel now writes
and consults on technology and other things he enjoys and finds
interesting.
Over the years, he’s had practical experience using GPS and maps
for wildland firefighting, search and rescue, and disaster response
and planning. He geocaches and is an avid user of the great out-
doors (which means there’s always too much gear in his garage),
competes in adventure races and other endurance sports, and
(so far) has always found his way back home.
This is his third book. He is the author of GPS For Dummies (which
happens to be a good companion to this book, especially if you
want to find out more about GPS and digital maps) and Secrets of
Computer Espionage: Tactics & Countermeasures, a reference guide
for computer security practitioners and anyone interested in stop-
ping sneaky spies.

Geocaching For Dummies

Introduction
G
eocaching is a high-tech treasure hunt where you get to play
Indiana Jones and search for hidden booty. (Wearing a fedora
and carrying a whip are completely up to you.)
Things have changed quite a lot since Indy roamed the globe looking
for rare artifacts, and the sport of geocaching relies on two modern-
day technologies:
 The Internet: Instead of translating some old piece of papyrus
to discover the location of the lost city of Tanis, you head out
to the Geocaching.com Web site (or other sites that maintain
geocache databases); enter a ZIP code, state, or country; and
you’re presented with a list of caches you can search for.
Currently, over 100,000 geocaches are located all over the
world, so you can search for caches in your own neighbor-
hood or hop on a Pan Am Clipper to some exotic country
for a real adventure.
 GPS receivers: Although Jones had to figure out how to use the
Staff of Ra to find the resting place of the Ark of the Covenant,
searching for a geocache is usually quite a bit simpler. The list
of geocaches that you can get from the online Geocaching.com
database all have location coordinates associated with them.
By entering the coordinates into a GPS receiver, you can typi-
cally get within about 30 feet of a geocache you’re searching
for (or sometimes even closer).
Dr. Jones searched for priceless artifacts like the Lost Ark, but your
hunt involves looking for containers filled with modern day memo-
rabilia such as souvenirs, toys, and trinkets (some useful and others
not). Don’t count on golden idols, but do expect to encounter some
cool and unique items in caches. You’ll also usually not need to
worry about poison darts, snakes, or Nazis.
If geocaching sounds intriguing, you’ve come to the right place.
This book covers you everything you need to know about geo-
caching. You’ll discover how to
 Select a GPS receiver to use for geocaching.
 Use a GPS receiver.
 Use a map and compass.

Geocaching For Dummies 
2
 Prepare yourself for geocaching trips (including what gear
you’ll need).
 Locate geocaches to search for on the www.geocaching.com
Web site.
 Find geocaches.
 Hide your own geocaches and add them to the Geocaching.
com database.
 Search for benchmarks (U.S. government survey markers).
 Use geocaching for educational purposes.
 Use Internet resources and software to enhance your geo-
caching experience.
About This Book
Because I have acquaintances, friends, and family who geocache,
I often get lots of questions about the sport. One of the reasons
why I wrote this book was to provide an easy-to-use reference that
anyone could pick up; give a quick read; and within no time, be out
in the fresh air enjoying geocaching.
With that in mind, this book is for several types of readers:
 Neocachers: In geocaching jargon, a neocacher is a novice geo-
cacher; you might have just started out and have found a few
caches, or you’ve recently read or heard about the sport and
are interested in giving it a try. If you’re a neocacher, you’re in
luck because you’ll find everything you need to know to get
started with geocaching.
 Experienced geocachers: If you’re an experienced geocacher
with hundreds of finds under your belt, you’ll probably be
familiar with a fair amount of the basic information in this
book. However, in addition to the material designed for the
neocachers, you’re going to encounter some tips and tech-
niques (as well as entertaining and educational stories) that
apply to geocachers of all levels. Also, if you want to get a
friend or family member hooked on the sport, this book
makes a great birthday or Christmas present (especially
wrapped together with a new GPS receiver, if your budget
allows).

Introduction
3
 Land managers: If you work for a federal, state, or local
agency that manages land and have had reports of people
wandering around the land that you’re responsible for —
staring intently at GPS receivers while looking for something,
and you want to know what they’re up to — this book is also
for you. Geocaching is turning into an increasingly popular
form of outdoor recreation. As a land manager, you should
really understand what the sport is all about so you can
develop effective policies and work together with geocaching
groups. (The good news is that most geocachers tend to
be responsible land users.)
What You’re Not to Read
Scattered throughout this book are little anecdotes, historical notes,
and technical details. This information is definitely not necessary
to your understanding of geocaching; it’s completely voluntary that
you read it. For this reason, I put all this information into little gray
boxes or highlight it with a Technical Stuff icon. Feel free to thumb
your nose at this information.
On the other hand, in geocaching, the journey is half the fun. I would
go ahead and read this stuff if I were you. Just keep in mind that you
don’t have to.
Foolish Assumptions
If I had to make some foolish assumptions about you and other
readers of this book, here’s what they’d be:
 You already have a GPS receiver (but might be a little fuzzy on
all its features and whistles and bells).
 You’ve read my other book, GPS For Dummies (which has lots
of information about GPS and digital maps and a single chap-
ter devoted to geocaching). Geocaching For Dummies provides
detailed coverage of geocaching and basic information on GPS
and digital maps.
 You’ve got access to the Internet (home, work, school, library,
an Internet café, wherever), and you can use a Web browser.

 You like to be outside and are looking for a good excuse to get
some fresh air.
 You like challenges and puzzles.
 You always thought hunting for pirate treasure or that infa-
mous Lost Ark would be a cool second career.
So how did I do? If I got three or four correct, you’ve come to the
right place.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is conveniently divided into several different parts. The
content in each part tends to be related, but by all means, feel free
to skip around and read about what interests you the most.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache
Part I is all about getting to geocache. You’ll find chapters devoted
to general information about the sport, how to select and use a
GPS receiver, and how to use a map and compass. (I know, this is
a pretty old-school skill, but trust me, it comes in handy — and
you’ll see why.)
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching
If you can’t wait to head out geocaching, this is likely the part of
the book that you want to read first. Here are chapters that show
you how to use the Geocaching.com database to choose geocaches
to search for, how to go about finding a geocache (and most impor-
tantly, what to do when you find one), and how to hide your own
cache after you get a feel for what geocaching is all about.
Part III: Advanced Geocaching
Geocaching is an evolving new sport, and variations of the basic
concept are already starting to sprout up. This section of the book
examines some advanced and alternative applications of geo-
caching. You’ll find chapters on searching for benchmarks; how
to use geocaching in education (with tips for teachers and par-
ents); and how to get involved with geocaching clubs, including
entering geocaching competitions.

Part IV: The Part of Tens
You can’t have a For Dummies book without a Part of Tens section.
In this part of the book, you’ll find chapters on Internet geocaching
resources and software programs that you can use for geocaching.
Icons Used in This Book
When you go geocaching, you’ll likely be using a paper map or per-
haps one that’s displayed on your GPS receiver. Maps use symbols
to quickly convey information, and this book does the same by
using icons to help you navigate your way around. The icons that
you’ll encounter include the following.
This icon represents some good insider tips — the kind of informa-
tion someone might whisper in your ear (or that you eventually
learn through trial and error and practical experience). Tips are
designed to make your life easier so you can make sure your fun-
meter is always on high while you’re geocaching.
When you see this icon, it’s a gentle reminder about something of
importance. Consider it similar to advice from your favorite uncle
(who always seemed pretty smart and cool).
The sport of geocaching is based on technology. When it comes to
GPS, maps, and compasses, an understanding of some technical
stuff is required. I try to keep the really rocket-scientist things to a
bare minimum, but every now and then, technical stuff does creep
in. When it does, you see this icon. I’ll do my best to either give
you a plain-English explanation or point you to a Web site where
you can get additional details.
The little bomb icon looks pretty scary, doesn’t it? This icon means
warning. It’s kind of like the robot from the old Lost in Space TV
show, saying, “Danger, Will Robinson!” It doesn’t necessarily mean
that you’ll encounter a situation that causes your GPS receiver to
melt or that you’ll accidentally release evil spirits if you open up
a certain geocache. What it does mean is to pay attention: Here’s
some worthwhile information that might save you from some
mental or physical discomfort of one type or the other.

A Few Closing Thoughts
That’s a brief tour of the book, but before I get started with the ins
and outs of geocaching, I’d like to leave you with a few closing
thoughts.
I spend some time discussing GPS receivers. One question that I
often get is, What is the best GPS receiver for geocaching? Like any
consumer electronics product, GPS receiver models are constantly
changing and being updated. Instead of recommending that you
buy a certain brand or model (that could possibly be replaced by
something cheaper and better over the course of a few months),
I tell you what questions to ask when you’re shopping for a GPS
receiver and give you some hints on which features are best for
geocaching. You’ll be able to apply these questions and selection
criteria to pretty much any GPS receiver (no matter how much the
marketplace changes) to pick the right model.
You’ll find a fair number of references to Web sites in this book.
Unfortunately, Web sites sometimes change just about as fast as
the contents of a popular geocache. If a link doesn’t work, you
should have enough information to find what you’re looking for
by using a search engine such as Google.
All the information in this book should set you on your way to
becoming an expert geocacher — that is, if you go out and prac-
tice. Read through the book and then head out into the great out-
doors and play Indiana Jones searching for the lost geocache.
Learn, experiment, and have fun!

In this part . . .

efore you run out the door to give geocaching a try,
you should have a basic understanding of the sport
and some fundamental skills. That’s where this part of the
book comes in. Chapter 1 introduces you to geocaching
and provides a general overview of what it’s all about
(including some good reasons to give it a try). Because
GPS receivers are an essential part of geocaching, in
Chapter 2, I talk about how they work and the types of
features they have — and if you don’t have one yet, how
to choose a GPS receiver suitable for geocaching.
I follow that up with Chapter 3, where you can ﬁnd basic
instructions on how to use a GPS receiver. (Rest assured
that no matter what the brand or model, all GPS receivers
have similar features commonly used for geocaching.) In
Chapter 4, I step you through the basics of using a map
and a compass. I know this seems pretty old school com-
pared with simply pushing a button on a GPS receiver to
ﬁnd out exactly where you are. Trust me: Having funda-
mental map and compass skills can make geocaching
more enjoyable and save you from getting lost if you’re
out in the middle of nowhere and your GPS stops working
(it does happen).

eocaching is a new, popular sport that relies on using a Global
Positioning System (GPS) receiver, the Internet, and your
powers of observation. In a nutshell, you find some stuff, take some
stuff, leave some stuff, record it all in a logbook, and have fun!
To elaborate a little more, someone, somewhere, hides a container
filled with goodies (toys, travel memorabilia, costume jewelry,
you name it). He or she then posts the location coordinates on
the Internet along with a few clues. You visit a Web site database,
get the coordinates, and use your GPS receiver to zero in on the
geocache location. (Your GPS receiver usually won’t lead you
directly to the cache, and this is where your powers of observa-
tion come into play in locating the cache’s hiding place.)
Geocaching is pronounced GEE-oh-cash-ing. It’s not appropriate to
pronounce cache as ca-SHAY, even if you are French. So unless you
want some funny looks, stick with good ol’ cash.
In a few short years, geocaching has grown incredibly popular.
Relatively cheap and accurate GPS receivers and widespread
access to the Internet have helped the sport flourish through-
out the world. As of April 2004, the Geocaching.com site (www.
geocaching.com; one of the first Web sites devoted to the sport
and currently the largest geocaching site on the ’Net) had over
91,000 active geocaches listed in its database, spread out among
201 countries. And that number continues to grow each day. That’s
a lot of caches out there to find!

Although geocaching is based on a fairly simple idea, you need
to understand a number of basic things — or at least be aware
of them — before you get started. That’s what this chapter is all
about. I show you exactly what geocaching is, how the sport got
started, why you should geocache, and what you’ll need to get
started with the sport.
What Is Geocaching?
If you’re reading this book, there’s a good chance you’ve heard
about geocaching (or saw the title on a bookstore shelf, wondered
what the heck it was, and started flipping through pages). The
rising popularity of the sport has gotten a fair amount of media
attention. Maybe you read a newspaper or magazine article about
it or perhaps heard friends talking about some of their geocaching
adventures.
Geocaching technology
Geocaching relies on two technologies:
 The Internet: Various Web sites list the coordinates of geo-
caches that you can search for.
 GPS: The satellite-based Global Positioning System (which
everyone calls GPS for short) is used to help you zero in on
the location of geocaches. (I discuss GPS in depth in Chapter 2.
I even wrote a whole book about it: GPS For Dummies.)
People use these two technologies together for finding and hiding
goodie-filled containers that, by now, you’ve probably guessed are
called geocaches.

How geocaching got started
Until 2000, the U.S. government degraded GPS signals using something called
Selective Availability (SA). SA allowed the U.S. and its allies to use special GPS
receivers to get very accurate location information while preventing civilian GPS
receivers from having as much precision.
In May 2000, SA was officially turned off (mostly because the U.S. government
developed a way to degrade the accuracy of GPS to specific geographic regions).
Suddenly, like magic, civilian GPS receivers that formerly were accurate only to

Geocaching explained
Take a more detailed look at the steps that are involved in
geocaching:
Chapter 1: An Introduction to Geocaching 11
about 300 feet became accurate to 30 feet. This new level of accuracy offered some
interesting, creative possibilities.
Three days after SA was turned off, Dave Ulmer posted a message in the sci.geo.
satellite-nav USENET newsgroup with coordinates of a “stash” he had hidden
that contained software, videos, books, food, money, and a slingshot.
Earlier in the day, in the same newsgroup, Ulmer had proposed a worldwide “stash
hunt,” where people would post GPS waypoints (coordinates saved in a GPS receiver)
on the Internet that would lead searchers to hidden goodies. While Ulmer envi-
sioned thousands of stashes tucked in places all over the world, he had no idea how
popular his idea would become.
By the end of May, in a Yahoo! Group devoted to the new sport, a member named
Matt Stum suggested that the sport be called geocaching in order to avoid some of
the negative connotations associated with drugs and the word stash. (A cache is a
hidden place where goods or valuables are concealed.) Geocaching had a nice ring
to it, and because it didn’t sound like a bad Cheech and Chong movie, the name stuck.
The original cache is long gone, but there’s a newer one at the location and even a
plaque that commemorates the world’s first official geocache (shown here). If
you’ve ever in the Portland, Oregon area, think about making a pilgrimage to the
shrine. (In Chapter 5, I tell you how to get there.)

1. Someone hides a geocache.
The cache consists of a waterproof, element-resistant con-
tainer, such as a surplus ammo can or plastic tub, that’s
filled with small trinkets such as costume jewelry, toys,
flashlights, old coins, fossils, or just about anything else
you could imagine. (Chapter 8 has everything you need to
know about hiding caches.) The container also contains a
logbook and a pen or pencil so whoever finds a cache can
record their discovery. A sample geocache with its goodies
is shown in Figure 1-1.
Figure 1-1: A found geocache with goodies.
2. The geocache hider logs the GPS coordinates of the cache
and a brief description on a Web site.
Several different Web sites list the geocache coordinates.
The largest and most popular site is www.geocaching.com.
I primarily focus on this Web site throughout the book.
3. The prospective geocache finder (that’s you) is interested
in searching for geocaches in a particular area and
queries the Geocaching.com database.
You can do this by entering a ZIP code, state, country, or
other search options. A list of all the geocaches in the general
vicinity is displayed. (Read more about this in Chapter 5.)
4. Look through the list of geocaches, select a few that look
interesting, and enter their coordinates in your GPS
receiver.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache

5. Drive as close as you can to the geocache (unless you
want some additional exercise by walking or hiking a
bit farther) and start your search on foot, using the GPS
receiver to guide you to the cache location.
The GPS receiver won’t take you directly to the geocache —
that would be too simple. Your GPS receiver will typically
get you within 50 feet or so, and then you need to use your
Sherlock Holmes powers of observation and deduction to
locate the hidden cache.
6. Find the hidden container.
If the cache is more deviously hidden, I give you some strate-
gies in Chapter 7.
7. Open it up and see what’s inside.
Whee! It’s Christmas morning, and you get to pick your
present.
8. Exchange a trinket in the container that catches your eye
with something you brought with you to trade.
9. Sign and date the logbook and carefully place the con-
tainer back in its hiding place for the next geocacher to
discover.
10. When you get home, log on to the Geocaching.com Web
site, record your find, and write up a brief account of your
adventures. (This is optional, but most geocachers do it.)
That’s how geocaching works. Repeat the above steps over and
over again, having as much fun as possible each time you go out
looking for geocaches. (I go into a lot more detail with each of
these steps throughout the book.)
Chapter 1: An Introduction to Geocaching 13
The original caches: Letterboxes
The whole geocaching concept isn’t that new. Over 100 years ago, something sim-
ilar developed in England: letterboxing. Letterboxing comprises placing a blank log-
book and a custom-made rubber stamp in a waterproof container and then hiding
it. Clues are distributed with the container’s location, and searchers armed with
inkpads and notebooks try to find the hidden box. If they are successful, they stamp
the logbook in the box with their own personal rubber stamp and also stamp their
logbook with the box’s stamp. This low-tech version of geocaching is still very pop-
ular. Depending on whom you talk to, 10,000–40,000 letterboxes are hidden in
England, and around 5,000 are lurking in the United States. Read more about letter-
boxing at www.letterboxing.org.

Deciding to Geocache
Why should you geocache? That’s a fair question, and I’m going to
give you a number of reasons why you should get involved in the
sport. (If you’re already an experienced geocacher, feel free to use
some of these reasons to convince your friends and family mem-
bers that they should give geocaching a try.)
 Master your GPS receiver: GPS receivers tend to have lots of
different features and whistles and bells. Because successful
geocaching depends on using a GPS receiver, the sport offers
an excellent opportunity for you to get to know your receiver
and how to use it. (I talk about how to use a GPS receiver in
Chapter 3.)
 See new places: It’s pretty easy to get into a rut and never go
anyplace new. People tend to be creatures of habit and always
visit the same places, over and over again. Geocaching breaks
you out of this repetitive cycle. You’ve now got a good excuse
to visit places you’ve never been before, and because new geo-
caches are being added all the time, it’s pretty hard to get
bored. Many people even incorporate geocaching into their
vacations and business trips.
 Get some exercise: Face it; most people don’t get enough
exercise. For whatever reasons, it’s easier just to sit on the
couch and slowly (or quickly) put on the pounds. Geocaching
is a great, low-impact way of increasing your fitness. It gives
you a reason to get off the couch and get out in the fresh air to
do some walking or hiking. Because geocaches are rated as to
how difficult the terrain is and how far you’ll need to walk to
get to a cache, you can select outings that are based on your
current level of fitness.
 Challenge yourself: There’s scientific evidence that just like
you need to exercise your body to be healthy, you also need
to exercise your brain. Geocaching is a great way to do this
because the sport involves a number of mental challenges. It’s
like doing a crossword puzzle, plus you get the extra benefit of
the physical exercise. You need to use
• The Internet: To find geocaches you’d like to search for
• Your GPS receiver: To get to the general vicinity of a cache
• Your brain: To figure out just where the cache is hidden
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache

 Hang out with friends and family: Geocaching can be an indi-
vidual or group activity, and it’s a great excuse to get the family
together or turn it into a social outing for a group of friends.
Geocaching is even pet-friendly. Lots of geocachers take their
dogs out with them on hunts. (Just remember to be consider-
ate to others and bring a leash and a plastic bag.)
 Educate kids (and adults): Geocaching, which is starting to
find its way into the classroom, is a great way to learn about
history, geography, maps, and science. There are a number of
ways how you can apply the basic principles of geocaching in
an educational setting to make learning fun. (I discuss using
GPS and geocaching in education in Chapter 11.)
 Build teams: Geocaching is also showing up as a unique tool
for organizational development in building teams and devel-
oping leadership skills. Small groups are given GPS receivers
and are asked to find geocaches and solve other related chal-
lenges, with effective teamwork a necessary ingredient for
success.
Who Geocaches?
One of the nice things about geocaching is that just about anyone
can do it; your gender, age, or economic status don’t much matter.
(Geocaching is a relatively inexpensive sport when it comes to
required equipment.) The main requirements are a spirit of adven-
ture, a love of puzzles and mysteries, and a good sense of fun. Here
are some of the people you’ll encounter in the sport:
 Computer geeks: Because geocaching involves gadgets (GPS
receivers and the Internet), in the early days of the sport, a
number of computer geeks were initially drawn to the activity.
If you’re not a geek, don’t worry. You definitely don’t need a
computer science degree, and geocaching has become so
popular that the average-Joe non-geeks currently outnumber
the technology geeks.
 Families and friends: Geocaching is a very family-oriented
sport; more often than not, you’ll find couples, friends, and
families out scouring the countryside looking for caches.
Although you can certainly geocache by yourself, the social
aspects of the activity and having more than one set of eye-
balls to look for a well-hidden geocache are well suited to
multiple-person outings.
Chapter 1: An Introduction to Geocaching 15

 Outdoor recreationists: A fair number of hikers, hunters, fish-
ers, rockhounds, and other types of recreationists have been
using the outdoors long before GPS came into being. Because
they typically already own a GPS receiver, many of these out-
doorsmen and -women have added geocaching to their primary
outside interests, getting in a little geocaching while they’re
biking, hiking, fishing, four-wheeling, or engaging in some
other sport or pastime.
 Retired folks: Geocaching is popular with the retired set
because it’s a good excuse to get out of the house and do
something interesting. Geocaches vary in how difficult the
terrain is and how far off the beaten path they are. (Some
caches aren’t even off the beaten path but are in easily acces-
sible urban areas.) You can select geocaches to search for
that match your physical abilities. Geocaching is also well
suited for RVers and people who like to travel because they
can go geocaching where they’re staying or on the way to
their next destination.
What You Need to Geocache
The requirements for geocaching are fairly minimal. In fact, from a
bare-bones standpoint, you need only two things:
 Geocache coordinates: If you don’t know where to look, it’s
pretty hard to find a geocache (at least in most cases) There
are numerous stories of non-geocachers accidentally stum-
bling onto caches, even some that were very well hidden.
Geocachers turn to various Web sites on the Internet where
they find tens of thousands of geocaches listed. Each of these
caches has a set of coordinates associated with it, in a map
grid system such as latitude and longitude or UTM (Universal
Transverse Mercator). I tell you everything you need to know
about how to find geocache location coordinates in Chapter 5.
 GPS receiver: With a GPS receiver, you enter the geocache
coordinates, and the receiver guides you to the general vicin-
ity of the geocache. (If you don’t already have a GPS receiver,
read Chapter 2 for some pointers on selecting one.) You don’t
need an expensive GPS unit with lots of features to geocache;
a basic model priced around $100 will work just fine. (Don’t
forget to bring the GPS receiver user manual, especially if you
just purchased your receiver and are still trying to figure out
how to use it.)
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
16

You can go geocaching without a GPS receiver and use only a map
and compass. (My adventure racing team does this to practice our
navigation skills.) This is more challenging and makes the sport
more like orienteering, where you run around the woods trying to
find control points as fast as you can, using a map and compass.
Although the geocache coordinates and a GPS receiver are the two
basic requirements for geocaching, I won’t kid you and say that’s
all you need. Geocachers also tend to carry things like maps and
compasses (which you can read how to use in Chapter 4), cell-
phones, food and water, and other pieces of gear. In Chapter 6,
I give you a comprehensive and detailed list of other essentials
that are commonly used when geocaching.
Geojargon: Speaking the Lingo
Like any sport or pastime, geocaching has its own language.
Because the sport is so new, the jargon is still evolving, but here
are some terms to be familiar with so when you talk to other
people about geocaching, you’ll sound like a pro.
 Archived: Caches that no longer exist but still appear in a
Web site database for historical purposes. A cache can be
archived because it has been stolen, is no longer maintained,
or does not abide by the guidelines for where caches should
be placed.
 Cache machine: A preplanned event in a local area, where
geocachers look for caches; the event can last hours or days.
This is a marathon-endurance session of geocaching, where
you try to find as many caches as you can in a set amount
of time. The event is named after the dedicated geocacher
BruceS (a true cache machine), who found 28 caches in
24 hours, totaling 86 finds in 5 days.
Chapter 1: An Introduction to Geocaching 17
Orienteering versus geocaching
One big difference between orienteering and geocaching is that in the former, the
control points are marked with very visible, orange and white flags. In geocaching,
the caches tend to be carefully hidden out of sight.

 DNF; Did Not Find: As in, did not find the cache. It happens to
everyone, so don’t worry. If you didn’t find the cache, try
again on another day.
 Event cache: A formal or informal get-together of geocachers.
This can be to search for caches or just sit around and have a
pizza and chat.
 FTF; First to Find: Bragging rights that you were the first
person to find a newly placed cache.
 Geocoins: Custom minted coins or medallions designed to
place in geocaches. Quite the prize if you find one in a cache.
 GPSR/GPSr: GPS receiver. Many people drop the R and just
call a GPS receiver a GPS.
 Hitchhiker: An object that moves from cache to cache. A
hitchhiker is marked with some instructions, telling the find-
ing geocacher to take it and place it in another cache.
 McToys: Cheap trinkets left in a cache, like the toys that
appear in fast-food kids’ meals. There are better things to
leave in caches.
 Muggles: People you encounter on the trail who aren’t geo-
cachers; from the Harry Potter stories.
 Neocacher: An inexperienced or newbie geocacher.
 Signature item: Something unique that a particular geocacher
always places in a cache that he or she finds.
 Spoiler: Information that might give away the location of a
cache.
 Swag: Goodies that you find in a cache; from the marketing
term swag (or schwag) used to describe the promotional trash
and trinkets (tchotchkes) handed out at trade shows.
 TNLN; Took Nothing, Left Nothing: Just what it sounds like.
Also, TNLNSL, which means that the geocacher additionally
signed the cache log.
 Travel Bug (TB): A type of hitchhiker that you mark with a
special dog tag purchased from Geocaching.com. When TBs
are found, their journey is tracked on the Geocaching.com
Web site. Travel Bugs can have specific goals (as in, getting
from point A to point B) or are just released into the world
to see how far they can travel.

Other caching pursuits
In addition to geocaching, a number of other GPS-related activities have sprung up
on the Internet. A few that you might be interested in include
 Geodashing: This is a contest in which random points are selected and players
need to get within 100 meters of the location. There are no caches, hints, or ter-
rain difficulty ratings, and the points can be anywhere on Earth. In fact, some
locations can be impossible to reach. A new contest takes place roughly every
month. The goal of the game is for teams to collect all the points first or to get
as many as they can before the contest ends. For more details, check out
www.geodashing.org.
 The Degree Confluence Project: This is an interesting project in which people
use their GPS receivers to visit places where latitude and longitude lines con-
verge. They take a digital picture, which is then published on a Web site. The
goal is to map all the major latitude/longitude intersections for the entire Earth.
For more information, go to www.confluence.org.
 Benchmark hunting: Benchmarks are permanent markers installed by the gov-
ernment for survey purposes. Over one-half million benchmarks have been
installed in the United States. The most familiar type is a small, brass disk
embedded into rock or concrete. The National Geodetic Survey (www.ngs.
noaa.gov) maintains a list of the benchmarks and their locations. Chapter 9
tells you everything you need to know about getting started in this sport.
 GPS Drawing: This is an interesting form of art based on using your GPS
receiver to record where you’ve been. For some amazing examples, check out
the gallery at www.gpsdrawing.com.

ecause geocaching depends so much on GPS (Global Position-
ing System), you should have a basic understanding of what
GPS is. In a nutshell, by using a special radio receiver that meas-
ures the distance from your location to satellites that orbit the
Earth broadcasting radio signals, GPS can pinpoint your position
anywhere in the world (which is essential to finding geocaches).
Pretty cool, huh? Aside from buying the receiver, the system is
free for anyone to use.
You can purchase an inexpensive GPS receiver, pop some batter-
ies in it, turn it on, and presto! Your location appears onscreen.
No map, compass, sextant (a traditional nautical navigation tool
used to determine position by the angle of the sun or stars), or
sundial is required. Enter the coordinates of a geocache, and the
GPS receiver will guide you directly to the cache (at least get you
pretty close to it), just like magic. It’s not really magic, though, but
an evolution of some great practical applications of science that
have come together over the last 50 years.
In this chapter, I provide you with advice on how to select a GPS
receiver to use for geocaching. But first, I want to spend a little
time giving you some background on how GPS works as well as
additional information on some of the capabilities and limitations
of the system.

Understanding Basic
GPS Concepts
I want to begin by talking about how GPS works and the different
pieces that make up the system. Don’t worry — although the intri-
cacies of GPS are steeped in mathematics, physics, and engineer-
ing, you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to understand how GPS
works. GPS needs three components in order to work (as shown in
Figure 2-1):
 Satellites: Transmit radio signals to Earth
 Ground stations: Precisely control the satellites’ positions
and monitor their status
 GPS receivers: Receive the satellite signals and determine
your location based on satellites’ positions and how far away
they are from the receiver
Figure 2-1: Ground stations, satellites, and receivers are all
necessary for GPS to work.
Read on for a more detailed look at each of these three parts.
Satellites
In GPS jargon, a satellite is the space segment. A constellation of
24 GPS satellites (21 operational and 3 spares) orbits about 12,000
miles above the Earth (as shown in Figure 2-2). The satellites zoom
through the heavens at around 7,000 miles per hour. It takes about
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
22

12 hours for a satellite to completely orbit the Earth, passing over
the exact same spot approximately every 24 hours. The satellites
are positioned where a GPS receiver can receive signals from at
least six of the satellites at any time, at any location on Earth —
that is, if nothing obstructs the signals.
Figure 2-2: GPS satellites orbit the Earth.
Three important pieces of hardware are on each GPS satellite:
 Computer: An onboard computer that controls its flight and
other functions
 Atomic clock: Keeps accurate time within 3 nanoseconds
(around 3-billionths of a second)
A super-accurate clock is required for correctly measuring
the distance between the satellite and a GPS receiver based
on the amount of time it takes for a satellite signal to reach
the Earth.
 Radio transmitter: Sends signals to Earth
The solar-powered GPS satellites have a limited lifespan (around
ten years). When they start to fail, spares are activated, or new
satellites are sent into orbit to replace the old ones. This gives the
government a chance to upgrade the GPS system by putting hard-
ware with new features into space.
GPS satellites don’t just help you stay found. All GPS satellites,
starting with NAVSTAR 8 (in 1980) carry NUDET sensors. No,
this isn’t some high-tech, pornography-detection system. NUDET
is an acronym for NUclear DETonation, and GPS satellites are
equipped with sensors designed to detect nuclear-weapon explo-
sions, assess the threat of nuclear attack, and help evaluate
nuclear strike damage.
Chapter 2: Selecting a GPS Receiver 23

Ground stations
Ground stations are the control segment of GPS. Five unmanned
ground stations around the Earth monitor the satellites. Informa-
tion from the stations is sent to a master control station — the
Consolidated Space Operations Center (CSOC) at Schriever Air
Force Base in Colorado — where the data is processed to deter-
mine each satellite’s ephemeris and timing errors.
An ephemeris is a list of the predicted positions of astronomical
bodies, such as the planets or the moon. Ephemerides (the plural
of ephemeris) have been around for thousands of years because of
their importance in celestial navigation. Ephemerides are compiled
to track the positions of the numerous satellites orbiting the Earth.
The processed data is sent to the satellites once daily with ground
antennas located around the world. This is kind of like syncing a per-
sonal digital assistant (PDA) with your personal computer to ensure
that all the data is in sync between the two devices. Because the
satellites have small built-in rockets, the CSOC can control them
to ensure that they stay in a correct orbit.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
24
GPS radio signals
GPS satellites transmit two types of radio signals: C/A-code and P-code.
Coarse Acquisition (C/A-code) is the type of signal that consumer GPS units receive.
C/A-code is sent on the L1 band at a frequency of 1575.42 MHz. C/A broadcasts are
known as the Standard Positioning Service (SPS).
C/A-code is less accurate than P-code (described next) and is easier to jam and
spoof (to prevent GPS units from receiving signals and to broadcast false signals to
make a receiver think it’s somewhere else when it’s really not).
The one advantage of C/A-code is that it’s quicker to use for acquiring satellites and
getting an initial position fix; some military P-code receivers first track on the C/A-
code and then switch over to P-code.
Precision (P-code) provides highly precise location information. P-code is difficult
to jam and spoof. The U.S. military is the primary user of P-code transmissions, and
it uses an encrypted form of the data (Y-code), so only special receivers can access
the information. The P-code signal is broadcast on the L2 band at 1227.6 MHz. P-code
broadcasts are known as the Precise Positioning Service (PPS).

Receivers
The last part of the GPS system is a receiver. A receiver is just like
the radio in your car except that it receives GPS satellite signals
instead of music. Anyone who has a GPS receiver can receive the
satellite signals to determine where he or she is located.
Satellite data
GPS units receive two types of data from the NAVSTAR satellites.
 Almanac: Almanac data contains the approximate positions of
the satellites. The data is constantly transmitted and is stored
in the GPS receiver’s memory.
 Ephemeris: Ephemeris data has the precise positions of the
satellites. To get an accurate location fix, the receiver has to
know how far away a satellite is. The GPS receiver calculates
the distance to the satellite by using signals from the satellite.
Using the formula Distance = Velocity × Time, a GPS
receiver calculates the satellite’s distance. A radio signal travels
at the speed of light, which is 186,000 miles per second. The GPS
receiver needs to know the amount of time that the radio signal
takes to travel from the satellite to the receiver in order to figure
out the distance. Both the satellite and the GPS receiver generate
an identical pseudo-random code sequence. When the GPS receiver
receives this transmitted code, it determines how much the code
needs to be shifted (by using the Doppler-shift principle) for the
two code sequences to match. The shift is multiplied by the speed
of light to determine the distance from the satellite to the receiver.
Both the satellite and the GPS receiver clocks must be synchro-
nized for accurate measurements to take place. Because putting
a $50,000 atomic clock in each GPS receiver wouldn’t make much
sense, receivers use a much cheaper quartz clock that is kept 
up-to-date and synchronized by the satellite signals.
Multiple satellites
The reason why so many satellites are in orbit is to provide GPS
coverage all over the world. Also, a GPS receiver needs information
from several satellites to tell you where you’re located:
 2-D: A minimum of three satellite signals is required to deter-
mine your location in two dimensions: latitude and longitude.
 3-D: Four satellite signals are required to determine your posi-
tion in three dimensions: latitude, longitude, and elevation.
Chapter 2: Selecting a GPS Receiver 25

Based on the orbits of the satellites — and if the sky is
unobstructed — at any given time, your receiver should be
able to get signals from at least 6 satellites (and up to 12).
GPS Receiver Accuracy
Just how accurate is a GPS receiver? According to the U.S. govern-
ment and GPS receiver manufacturers, you can expect your GPS
unit to be accurate within 49 feet (that’s 15 meters, for metric-
savvy folks). If your GPS reports that you’re at a certain location,
you can be reasonably sure that you’re within 49 feet of that exact
set of coordinates.

A short history of GPS
Military, government, and civilian users all over the world rely on GPS for naviga-
tion and location positioning, but radio signals have been used for navigation pur-
poses since the 1920s. LORAN (Long Range Aid to Navigation), a position-finding
system that measured the time difference of arriving radio signals, was developed
during World War II.
During the 1960s, several rudimentary satellite-positioning systems existed. The U.S.
Army, Navy, and Air Force were all working on independent versions of radio nav-
igation systems that could provide accurate positioning and all-weather, 24-hour
coverage. In 1973, the U.S. Air Force was selected as the lead organization to con-
solidate all the military satellite navigation efforts into a single program. This evolved
into the NAVSTAR (Navigation Satellite Timing and Ranging) Global Positioning
System, which is the official name for the United States’ GPS program.
The U.S. military wasn’t interested in GPS for navigation purposes only. A satellite
location system can be used for weapons-system targeting. Smart weapons such
as the Tomahawk cruise missile use GPS in their precision guidance systems. GPS,
combined with contour-matching radar and digital image-matching optics, makes
a Tomahawk an extremely accurate weapon. The possibility of an enemy using GPS
against the United States is one reason why civilian GPS receivers are less accu-
rate than their restricted-use military counterparts.
The first NAVSTAR satellite was launched in 1974 to test the concept. By the mid-
1980s, more satellites were put in orbit to make the system functional. In 1994, the
planned full constellation of 24 satellites was in place. Soon, the military declared
the system completely operational. The program has been wildly successful and is
still funded through the U.S. Department of Defense.

GPS receivers tell you how accurate your position is. Based on the
quality of the satellite signals that the unit receives, the screen can
display the estimated accuracy in feet or meters: The bigger the
number, the less accurate the position. An example GPS receiver
screen is shown in Figure 2-3. Accuracy depends on
 Receiver location
 Obstructions that block satellite signals
Figure 2-3: GPS receiver screen showing 
current position accuracy.
Generally, the more satellites you’re receiving signals from, the
more accuracy you’ll have. Most GPS receivers display the number
of satellites that you’re receiving data from as well as the signal
strength (also shown in Figure 2-3).
Even if you’re not a U.S. government or military GPS user, you can
get more accuracy by using a GPS receiver that supports corrected
location data. Corrected information is broadcast over radio sig-
nals that come from non-GPS satellites that are part of the Wide
Area Augmentation System (WAAS). I talk more about WAAS in the
following section on GPS receiver features.
Another technology — Differential GPS (DGPS) — uses ground-
based beacons to enhance location accuracy. GPS receivers that
work with DGPS require additional pieces of hardware and aren’t
used that often by geocachers.
Chapter 2: Selecting a GPS Receiver 27

Table 2-1 shows what type of accuracy you can expect from a GPS
receiver. These numbers are guidelines; at times, you might get
slightly more or less accuracy.

Although survey-grade GPS receivers can provide accuracy of less
than two centimeters, they are very specialized and expensive,
require a lot of training, and aren’t very portable. Their accuracy
is achieved with DGPS and post-processing collected data to
reduce location errors. The average geocacher doesn’t need this
level of precision (although at times, it might be nice trying to
locate hard-to-find caches).
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
28
Selective Availability (SA)
The average GPS user didn’t always have 15-meter accuracy. In the 1970s, studies
showed that the less-accurate C/A-code, designated for nonmilitary use, was more
accurate than the U.S. government intended. Originally thought to provide accuracy
within 100 meters, experiments showed that C/A accuracy was in the range of 20–30
meters. To degrade the accuracy of C/A-code, the U.S. government developed
Selective Availability (SA). SA puts errors into data from the NAVSTAR satellites and
prevents consumer GPS receivers from providing an extremely precise location fix.
Selective Availability was temporarily turned off in 1990 during the Persian Gulf War.
There weren’t enough U.S. and allied country military P-code GPS receivers, so the
Coalition troops used thousands of civilian GPS receivers. The Gulf War marked the
first time that GPS was used in large-scale combat operations.
On May 2, 2000, SA was turned off permanently. Overnight, the accuracy of civilian
GPS users all over the world went from 100 meters to 15 meters, and the sport of
geocaching was almost immediately born. Turning off SA on a global scale was
directly related to the U.S. military’s ability to degrade the C/A-code on a regional
basis. For example, during the invasion of Afghanistan, the American military
jammed GPS signals in Afghanistan to prevent the Taliban from using consumer
receivers in operations against American forces.

Factors That Affect GPS Accuracy
A number of conditions can reduce the accuracy of a GPS receiver.
From a top-down perspective (that is, from orbit down to ground
level), the possible sources of trouble look like this:
 Ephemeris errors: Ephemeris errors occur when the satellite
doesn’t correctly transmit its exact position in orbit.
 Ionosphere conditions: The ionosphere starts at about 43–50
miles above the Earth and continues for hundreds of miles.
Satellite signals traveling through the ionosphere are slowed
down because of plasma (a low-density gas). Although GPS
receivers attempt account for this delay, unexpected plasma
activity can cause calculation errors.
 Troposphere conditions: The troposphere is the lowest region
in the Earth’s atmosphere and goes up from ground level to
about 11 miles. Variations in temperature, pressure, and
humidity all can cause variations in how fast radio waves
travel, resulting in relatively small accuracy errors.
 Timing errors: Because placing an atomic clock in every GPS
receiver is impractical, timing errors from the receiver’s less
precise clock can cause slight position inaccuracies.
 Multipath errors: When a satellite signal bounces off a hard
surface (such as a building or canyon wall) before it reaches
the receiver, a delay in the travel time occurs, which causes
an inaccurate distance calculation. An example of a multipath
error is shown in Figure 2-4.
 Poor satellite coverage: When a significant part of the sky is
blocked, your GPS unit has difficulty receiving satellite data.
Unfortunately, you can’t say that if 50 percent (or some other
percentage) of the sky is blocked, you’ll have poor satellite
reception because the GPS satellites are constantly moving
in orbit. A satellite that provides a good signal one day might
provide a poor signal at the exact same location on another
day because its position has changed and is now being blocked
by a tree. The more open sky you have, the better your chances
of not having satellite signals blocked. Building interiors,
streets surrounded by tall buildings, dense tree canopies,
canyons, and mountainous areas are typical problem areas.
If satellite coverage is poor, try moving to a different location to
see whether you get any improvement.
Chapter 2: Selecting a GPS Receiver 29

Figure 2-4: Multipath errors are caused by bounced satellite signals.
Clouds, rain, snow, and weather don’t reduce the strength of GPS
signals enough to reduce accuracy. The only way that weather can
weaken signals is when a significant amount of rain or snow accumu-
lates on the GPS receiver antenna or on an overhead tree canopy.
Discovering GPS Receiver Features
A number of different types of GPS receivers are available, including
precision surveying receivers, car navigation systems, restricted-use
government and military models, and handheld consumer models
designed for outdoor recreational use.
Because most geocachers use handheld GPS receivers, I want to
describe some of the common features that you’ll find in these elec-
tronic products. Lots of GPS receiver models are on the market, and
they all vary, depending on the features they have.
Shells
The outer shells of handheld GPS receivers come in all sorts of dif-
ferent sizes, shapes, weights, and colors. (Figure 2-5 shows a vari-
ety of GPS models.) You have lots of options to select a model

that’s both aesthetically pleasing (such as color and shape) as well
as functional (whether the size and the layout of the buttons work
for you).
Figure 2-5: GPS receivers come in many sizes and shapes.
Although a GPS receiver that’s yellow or a garish fluorescent green
isn’t the most fashionable, it’s a lot easier to find when you set it
down on the ground or on a rock.
Although most GPS receivers are designed to be fairly robust, they
aren’t meant to survive extreme abuse, such as dropping them from
a height down onto rocks. The majority of receivers are waterproof,
though, so you don’t need to worry about operating them in the rain
and snow. Some models even float.
Screen display
GPS receivers have two choices for information display:
 Monochrome LCD screen: Most GPS receivers have a mono-
chrome liquid crystal display (LCD) screen.
 Color screen: Newer GPS models are starting to incorporate
color screens. These are especially useful for displaying maps.
A GPS receiver’s screen size depends on the receiver’s size.
Smaller, lighter models have small screens; larger units sport
bigger screens.
Chapter 2: Selecting a GPS Receiver 31

Generally, a bigger screen is easier to read. Different models of GPS
receiver also have different pixel resolutions. The higher the screen
resolution, the more crisp the display will be. For night use, all
screens can be backlit.
GPS receiver screens can get scratched fairly easily. You can pro-
tect them by using a carrying case or by purchasing plastic screen
protectors sold for PDAs, cutting them to fit the size of the receiver
screen.
Mapping capabilities
Every GPS receiver has a map page (as shown in Figure 2-6) that
shows waypoints and tracks. (Waypoints are marked locations, and
tracks are a record of where you’ve been. I discuss these fully in
Chapter 3.) The page is a simple map that plots travel and loca-
tions. It doesn’t show roads, geographic features, or man-made
structures.
Figure 2-6: Simple and sophisticated 
GPS receiver screens.
Some GPS receivers do display maps that show roads, rivers,
cities, and other features on their screens. You can zoom in and
out to show different levels of detail. The two types of mapping
GPS receivers are
 Basemap: These GPS units have a basemap loaded into read-
only memory that contains roads, highways, water bodies,
cities, airports, railroads, and interstate exits. Basemap GPS
receivers aren’t expandable, and you can’t load more-detailed
maps to the unit to supplement the existing basemap.
Basemaps might not be up-to-date and sometimes show fea-
tures that don’t exist.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
32

 Uploadable map: More-detailed maps can be added to this
type of unit (in either internal memory or an external memory
card). You can install road maps, topographic maps, and
nautical charts. Many of these maps also have built-in data-
bases, so your GPS receiver can display restaurants, gas sta-
tions, or attractions near a certain location.
Refer to Figure 2-6 to see screens from a GPS receiver with a simple
plot map and another GPS unit with an uploadable map.
GPS receivers that display maps use proprietary map data and
software developed by the receiver manufacturer. You can’t load
another manufacturer’s or software company’s maps onto a GPS
receiver. (For example, you can’t load a Garmin or DeLorme map
onto a Magellan receiver.) Many new users think they can load any
old map onto their receiver, but this isn’t the case. Check a GPS
receiver manufacturer’s Web site for information on the types of
maps a certain model can use.
All mapping GPS receivers aren’t created equal. Some units have
faster processors that refresh the map quicker when it scrolls.
A handheld GPS receiver’s screen is only a few inches across. The
limitations of such a small display certainly don’t make the devices
a replacement for traditional paper maps. Also, don’t expect to get
the quality and detail of a paper map on an electronic map that
you can upload to a GPS receiver.
Memory
A GPS receiver’s internal memory holds data such as waypoints,
track logs, routes, and uploadable digital maps (if the model sup-
ports them). The more memory the receiver has, the more data
you can store in it. Just like PDAs and cellphones, all the data
that’s been stored in the GPS receiver is retained when the device
is turned off.
GPS receivers have different amounts of internal memory. Unlike
personal computers, however, you can’t add new memory chips
to a GPS unit to expand its internal memory.
Some GPS receivers aren’t limited to internal memory for storage,
instead using memory cards (such as MMC and SD cards) that are
plugged into the receiver to store data. These receivers are very
versatile.
Chapter 2: Selecting a GPS Receiver 33

PC interface
Most, although not all, GPS receivers support the ability to inter-
face with a PC. A cable is used to connect the GPS receiver to a
PC’s serial port (and with a few receivers, to the PC’s USB port).
With a PC interface, you can
 Upload firmware revisions to the receiver.
 Exchange waypoints, routes, and tracks between the PC and
GPS receiver.
 Upload maps from the PC to the receiver (if it supports this
capability).
 Connect your GPS receiver to a laptop running mapping soft-
ware to provide real-time navigation.
If the GPS receiver supports an external memory card, you can
also use it to move data between the PC and receiver.
Antennas
Well, yes, a GPS unit has to have an antenna to receive radio sig-
nals if it’s going to do you any good. Several types are available,
each with its advantages.
Internal antennas
All GPS receivers have one of two kinds of built-in antennas. One
antenna design isn’t superior to the other. Performance is related
to the receiver’s antenna design and size. (Cough . . . bigger some-
times is better.)
Patch
An internal patch antenna is a square conductor mounted over
a groundplane (another square piece of metal). Patch antenna
models reacquire satellites faster after losing the signal.
For best performance with an internal patch antenna, hold the
receiver face up and parallel with the ground.
Quad helix
An internal quadrifilar helix (quad helix) antenna is a circular tube
wrapped with wire. Quad helix antennas are more sensitive and
tend to work better under tree cover than other types.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
34

For best performance with an internal quad helix antenna, hold the
receiver so that the top is pointing up to the sky.
External antennas
Some GPS receivers have connectors for attaching external anten-
nas. An external antenna is useful if the GPS receiver’s view of the
sky is otherwise blocked, like in a boat, a car, an airplane, or a
backpack.
Reradiating antennas
If a GPS receiver doesn’t have a jack for connecting an external
antenna, you can improve the reception with a reradiating antenna.
These antennas work just as well as conventional external anten-
nas that plug into a GPS receiver.
A reradiating antenna combines two GPS antennas:
 One antenna receives the GPS signal from the satellites.
 The other antenna is connected to the first and positioned
next to the GPS unit’s internal antenna.
Here are a couple of sources for reradiating antennas:
 Roll your own: If you’re handy with a soldering iron, search
Google for reradiating antenna GPS to get tips on how to make
one yourself.
 Buy one: Purchase an assembled reradiating antenna from 
Pc-Mobile at www.pc-mobile.net/gpsant.htm.
External and reradiating antennas aren’t used that often for geo-
caching but can be useful if you’re using your GPS receiver for
other activities.
Batteries
Depending on the model, GPS receivers use two to four AA or AAA
batteries. Garmin has recently introduced receiver models that
have internal, rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries. Battery
life depends on the model and what features you’re using. For
example, leaving the backlight turned on drains batteries quite
rapidly. With the smaller GPS receivers that use AAA batteries,
you can expect roughly 6–10 hours of battery life. Receivers that
use AA batteries will typically last between 10–20 hours, again
depending on the model. I’ve personally found manufacturer
battery-life claims to be relatively optimistic.
Chapter 2: Selecting a GPS Receiver 35

Invest in one or two sets of nickel metal-hydride (NiMH) batteries
and a battery charger. These reusable batteries are cheaper in the
long run than using conventional alkaline batteries and are also
much more environmentally friendly because you can recharge
them hundreds of times before throwing them away.
Some GPS receivers feature a battery saver mode that turns off var-
ious functions to conserve battery life.
Enhanced features
In addition to cases, screen displays, batteries, antennas, and
common features that all GPS receivers share, some models have
enhanced features that further differentiate themselves from other
receivers. Some of these features can be especially useful for
geocaching.
Compass
All GPS receivers can tell you which direction you’re heading —
that is, as long as you’re moving. The minute you stop, the receiver
stops acting as a compass. To address this limitation, some GPS
receivers incorporate an electronic compass that doesn’t rely on
the GPS satellites. This can be handy because some geocaches
require that you follow a certain compass heading to successfully
find the cache.
Operation
Like with an old-fashioned compass, you can stand still and see
which direction your GPS receiver is pointing toward. The only dif-
ference is that you see a digital display onscreen instead of a float-
ing needle.
On some GPS receivers, you need to hold the unit flat and level for
the compass to work correctly. Other models have a three-axis
compass that allows the receiver to be tilted.
Paying attention to these factors can improve the performance and
convenience of an electronic compass:
 Magnetic fields: Metal objects, cars, and other electronic
devices reduce the accuracy of any electronic or magnetic
compass.
 Battery life: Using an electronic compass can affect battery
life. Some GPS receivers have settings that turn off the com-
pass or use it only when the receiver can’t determine a direc-
tion from satellite data.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
36

Calibration
Electronic compasses need to be calibrated whenever you change
batteries. If your GPS unit has an electronic compass, follow your
user guide’s instructions to calibrate it. Usually, this requires being
outside, holding the GPS unit flat and level, and slowly turning in a
circle twice.
Altimeter
The elevation or altitude calculated by a GPS receiver from satellite
data isn’t very accurate. Because of this, some GPS units have
altimeters, which provide the elevation, ascent/descent rates,
change in elevation over distance or time, and the change of
barometric pressure over time. (The rough-and-ready rule is that
if barometric pressure is falling, bad weather is on the way — if
it’s rising, good weather is coming.) If calibrated and used cor-
rectly, barometric altimeters can be accurate within ten feet of
the actual elevation. Knowing your altitude is useful if you have
something to reference it to, such as a topographic map (which
you can read lots more about in Chapter 4).
On GPS units with an electronic altimeter/barometer, calibrating
the altimeter to ensure accuracy is important. To do so, visit a
physical location with a known elevation and enter the elevation
according to the directions in your user’s guide.
Airports are good places to calibrate your altimeter or get an initial
base reading; their elevation is posted for pilots to use while cali-
brating their airplanes’ altimeters. If you’re relying on the altime-
ter/barometer for outdoor recreation use, I recommend always
calibrating it before you head out on a trip.
WAAS
Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) combines satellites and
ground stations to improve GPS position accuracy to potentially
better than three meters. Vertical accuracy is also improved to 3–7
meters. Obviously, this puts you closer to the geocache location.
WAAS is a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) system,
designed so GPS can be used for airplane flight approaches. The
system has a series of ground-reference stations throughout the
United States. These monitor GPS satellite data and then send the
data to two master stations — one on the west coast and the other
on the east coast. These master stations create a GPS message that
corrects for position inaccuracies caused by satellite orbital drift
and atmospheric conditions. The corrected messages are sent to
non-NAVSTAR satellites in stationary orbit over the equator. The
Chapter 2: Selecting a GPS Receiver 37

satellites then broadcast the data to GPS receivers that are WAAS-
enabled. (Just about all GPS receivers manufactured in the past
several years support WAAS.)
GPS units that support WAAS have a built-in receiver to process
the WAAS signals, which means that you don’t need to purchase
additional hardware as you would if you were using DGPS to get
better accuracy. Some GPS receivers support turning WAAS on and
off. If WAAS is on, battery life is shorter (although not as signifi-
cantly as it is when using the backlight). In fact, on these models,
you can’t use WAAS if the receiver’s battery-saver mode is acti-
vated. Whether you turn WAAS on or off depends on your needs.
Unless you need a higher level of accuracy, you can leave WAAS
turned off if your GPS receiver supports toggling it on and off. WAAS
is ideally suited for aviation as well as for open land and marine
use. The system might not, however, provide any benefits in areas
where trees or mountains obstruct the view of the horizon.
If your GPS receiver is WAAS-compatible, it will let you know when
it is receiving WAAS information that makes its position reporting
more accurate.
Under certain conditions — say, when weak WAAS satellite signals
are being received or the GPS receiver is a long way from a ground
station — accuracy can actually worsen when WAAS is enabled. If
your GPS receiver allows you to turn off WAAS, check whether the
EPE (Estimated Position Error) gets better or worse. Check your
receiver user guide for information on EPE and how to view it.
WAAS is available only in North America. Other governments are
establishing similar systems that use the same format radio signals
such as
 European Euro Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service
(EGNOS)
 Japanese Multi-Functional Satellite Augmentation System
(MSAS)
Autorouting
Some handheld GPS receivers support an autorouting feature. You
enter a street address, and the GPS receiver plots a route for you,
providing you with turn-by-turn street directions on how to reach
your destination. A street map appears on the receiver’s screen
showing the route and your current travel path. GPS receivers that
support autorouting are handy because you can use them for off-
road outdoor activities as well as for paved-road navigation.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
38

Accessory programs
Many GPS receivers have built-in accessory programs that display
various handy features such as
 Calendars with the best times to hunt and fish
 Sunrise, moonrise, sunset, and moonset tables
 Tide tables
 Calculators
 Games
Garmin has even included a geocaching logbook program on some
of its newer models of GPS receivers.
Selecting a GPS Receiver
for Geocaching
Before you purchase a GPS receiver, you should spend some time
kicking the proverbial tires. Don’t rush out and buy a receiver
based on one or two good Internet reviews without having a
chance to hold that very GPS receiver in your hands to see how
it works. Spend some time comparing different brands and models
to determine which one works best for you. Because GPS units are
sold in most sporting goods stores and many large retail chains,
you shouldn’t have to buy a receiver sight unseen.
The three largest manufacturers of consumer GPS receivers in the
United States are Garmin, Magellan (a part of Thales Navigation),
and Lowrance. All these manufacturers have extensive Web sites
that provide detailed information about their products (including
the types of maps you can upload to certain receivers). If you’re
in the market for a GPS receiver, definitely spend some time brows-
ing through product literature. The Web site addresses for these
manufacturers are
 Garmin: www.garmin.com
 Magellan: www.magellangps.com
 Lowrance: www.lowrance.com
“The Big Three” all make great GPS receivers, and it’s pretty hard
to go wrong with one of their models.
Chapter 2: Selecting a GPS Receiver 39

All GPS receiver manufacturers offer free Adobe Acrobat PDF ver-
sions of their product user manuals on their respective Web sites. If
you’re in the market for a GPS receiver, these are excellent resources
for comparing features and seeing what the user interface is like,
because the manuals have instructions as well as screenshots.
Friends with GPS receivers are also a good source of information;
ask to take their different brands and models out for a test drive.
Attending a geocaching club get-together is another way to get the
lowdown on what people think about different models. (Chapter 10
has a list of the geocaching club Web sites, organized by state.)
Here are the two big questions that you should ask yourself before
you begin your GPS receiver search:
 What am I going to use it for? It’s a given that you’re going
to use the GPS receiver for geocaching, but is there anything
else you plan on using it for? Maybe you also want to use it
for navigating streets and roads, or for boating, or for making
maps. Think about what activities you’ll be doing with your
GPS receiver. When you get specific with your answers, you
start to identify those features that a GPS receiver should
have to meet your needs.
 How much do I want to spend? How much money you’ve got
in your wallet or purse is obviously going to influence which
models you end up considering. The more features a GPS
receiver has, the more it’s going to cost. If you can figure out
exactly what you’re going to use the receiver for (see the pre-
vious bullet) as well as which features you really need (versus
those that are nice to have), you’ll end up saving some money.
Generally, figure on spending anywhere from a little under
$100–$500 for a handheld GPS receiver that you can use for
geocaching.
Although your budget will narrow down your choices, you’re likely
still going to be faced with a number of models to choose from. The
next step is to further narrow the list of candidates with some more
questions and things to consider, including
 Map display: Do you want to view maps on your GPS receiver?
If so, you definitely need a mapping model — a GPS receiver
that displays maps. See the sidebar, “To map or not to map.”
 Accessories: Does your budget include accessories such as a
carrying case, PC interface cable, vehicle and bike mounting
bracket, rechargeable batteries, and uploadable maps?
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
40

 Battery needs: Consider the following questions:
• How many hours does the GPS receiver run on a set
of batteries, and how long do you plan to be out geo-
caching? Remember two things: Different models (and
their features) have different battery diets, and different
battery types have varying lifespans.
• Will you need to carry spare batteries (always a good
idea), and if so, how many? I recommend always carry-
ing at least one fresh set of spare batteries.
• Will you be using a cigarette lighter power adapter as an
alternative to using batteries?
 Memory: How much memory does the GPS receiver have, and
is it expandable? This is a critical question if you’re interested
in a GPS receiver that supports uploadable maps. Visit the GPS
receiver manufacturers’ Web sites to get an idea of how much
memory the maps can take up.
Chapter 2: Selecting a GPS Receiver 41
To map or not to map
In terms of features, probably the biggest decision you’ll need to make is whether
to get a GPS receiver that displays maps. Quite honestly, no matter what a salesper-
son might tell you, a GPS receiver that uses built-in or uploaded maps isn’t required
for geocaching or other outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, bird watching, or
kayaking. Using waypoints and tracks (see Chapter 3) are all you need to navigate
and successfully stay found. Also, even though your GPS receiver doesn’t display
maps, if it can interface with a PC, you can still download information on where
you’ve been and have it show up in a digital mapping program on your PC.
That said, mapping GPS receivers are pretty handy because they give you a quick,
big-picture view of where you’re located in relation to other features such as moun-
tain peaks, rivers, and roads. And just the sight of a map, even though it’s tiny and
lacks a lot of detail, can be pretty reassuring at times if you get turned around, which
eventually happens to everyone.
Although I’m a firm believer that a mapping GPS receiver should never take the
place of a paper map and compass, if your budget allows a receiver that supports
maps (along with the software and digital maps to load with it), I’d say to buy it. I per-
sonally use a mapping model for geocaching and other outdoor activities, treating
the map feature as just another tool in my bag of navigation tricks.

 Display screen: Find out the following:
• How big is the screen, and how well can you read it?
Make sure to consider visibility at night, in bright sun-
light, and in poor weather conditions. The size of the
screen is directly related to the overall size of the GPS
receiver; so if you want a larger, more readable screen,
expect a larger GPS receiver to go with it.
• Do you really need a color screen? A color screen makes
reading maps easier because different colors are associ-
ated with map features, but this is more of a personal
preference than a requirement.
 User interface: Does operating the GPS receiver make sense
to you? Sure, some learning is required to come up to speed,
but using a GPS receiver should mostly be intuitive. Be sure to
compare different brands and models because user interfaces
are far from standardized.
 External controls: Look at different designs:
• Are the buttons and controls on the GPS receiver easy to
use? Naturally, this is also related to the user interface.
• Are the controls difficult to operate while wearing gloves
or mittens? You’re not planning on being a fair-weather
geocacher, are you?
 Weight, size, and case: Do you want absolutely the smallest
package you can get? Note that there’s only about a 7-ounce
weight difference between the lightest and heaviest handheld
GPS receivers. How rugged does the case construction seem?
 Computer interface: Do you plan to connect your GPS
receiver to a computer to download and upload data? If so,
make sure that the receiver can interface with a computer
to exchange data; I personally think this feature is a must
so you can upgrade the GPS receiver’s firmware.
Geocachers, and GPS users in general, tend to be very brand-loyal
when it comes to their receivers. You’ll encounter lots of online
(and in-person) discussions where the various merits of brands
and models are argued. Keep in mind, though, that you can suc-
cessfully use just about any modern GPS receiver for geocaching.
One of the best Internet GPS information resources is Joe Mehaffey,
Jack Yeazel, and Dale DePriest’s gpsinformation.net Web site.
You’ll find a variety of up-to-date product reviews and both gen-
eral and technical GPS information there. The address is www.

n this chapter, I cover the fundamentals of what you need to
know to use a GPS receiver for geocaching. I start out by dis-
cussing some basic yet important concepts like coordinate sys-
tems, datums, waypoints, and tracks. Understanding these concepts
is essential for successful and enjoyable geocaching. Then I get prac-
tical and talk about how to initialize your GPS receiver, change set-
tings, and enter and navigate to a waypoint, which is an important
skill for finding geocaches.
Although all GPS receivers provide location, speed, and distance
information and use coordinate systems, datums, and waypoints,
how the information is displayed and how you operate the receiver
vary from model to model. Considering this, I try to keep the discus-
sion in this chapter fairly general so it applies to all GPS receivers.
As you read through the sections, keep your receiver user guide
handy so you can see how basic concepts specifically apply to
your model.
Getting Familiar with Basic
GPS Concepts
The sport of geocaching relies on using a GPS receiver. A receiver
displays your current location and provides information about how
to get from where you’re currently located to some other place (like
a geocache). Although that sounds fairly straightforward, you need

to understand a number of underlying principles to effectively use
your GPS receiver. If you don’t have a good grasp of these basic
concepts, your geocaching adventures will likely end up being
frustrating instead of fun.
Understanding coordinate systems
A coordinate system is a way to locate places on a map, usually
some type of imaginary grid laid over a map. Grid systems are a
whole lot easier to use and more accurate than, “Well, all ya gotta
do is take the old dirt road by the broken fence for a mile, then turn
right at the dump, and you’ll find the geocache when the road starts
getting bumpy.”
A simple coordinate system can consist of a vertical row of letters
(A, B, C) on the left side of a map and a horizontal row of numbers
(1, 2, 3) at the bottom of a map. To tell someone where a known
location of a geocache is (for example), you put your finger on the
geocache and then move it in a straight line to the left until you hit
the row of letters. Then put your finger on the geocache again, but
this time move down until you reach the row of numbers. You now
can say confidently that the geocache is located at A12. (Remember
the kids’ game Battleship? It’s the same idea.)
A number of coordinate systems are in use. For the purpose of GPS
receivers and geocaching, you need to be aware of only two sys-
tems: latitude and longitude, and UTM. When a Web site lists a geo-
cache’s location (or someone e-mails you the coordinates), it will
be in one or both of these coordinate systems.
Latitude and longitude
Latitude and longitude is the oldest map-coordinate system for plot-
ting locations on the earth. The Roman scholar Ptolemy devised it
almost 2,000 years ago. Ptolemy wrote about the difficulties of accu-
rately representing the earth on a flat piece of paper and created
latitude and longitude as a way of solving the problem. That’s pretty
impressive for a time way before the age of computers and satellites.
Latitude and longitude are based on math, but they’re not really
complicated. Angles are measured in degrees, and they’re used for
measuring circles and spheres. Spheres can be divided into 360
degrees; because the Earth is basically a sphere, it can also be
measured in degrees. This is the basis of latitude and longitude,
which use imaginary degree lines to divide the surface of the
Earth, as shown in Figure 3-1.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
44

Figure 3-1: Latitude and longitude are imaginary lines.
The equator is an imaginary circle around the Earth — an equal
distance from the north and south poles and perpendicular to the
Earth’s axis of rotation. The equator divides the Earth into the
Northern Hemisphere (everything north of the equator) and the
Southern Hemisphere (everything south of the equator).
Latitude
Latitude is the angular distance measured north and south of the
equator (which is 0 degrees of latitude).
As you go north from the equator, the north latitude increases to
90 degrees when you arrive at the north pole.
As you go south of the equator, the south latitude increases to
90 degrees at the south pole.
In the Northern Hemisphere, the latitude is always given in degrees
north; in the Southern Hemisphere, it’s given in degrees south.
Longitude
Longitude works the same way as latitude, but the angular distances
are measured east and west of the prime meridian (which marks the
0° longitude line that passes through Greenwich, England without
even disturbing traffic).
When you travel east from the prime meridian, the longitude
increases to 180 degrees.
As you go west from the prime meridian, longitude also increases
to 180 degrees. (The place where the two 180° longitudes meet is
the International Date Line.)
Chapter 3: Using a GPS Receiver 45

In the Eastern Hemisphere (which is east of the prime meridian to
180 degrees east), the longitude is given in degrees east.
In the Western Hemisphere (which is west of the prime meridian to
180 degrees west), longitude is expressed in degrees west.
If you see a longitude coordinate preceded by a minus sign, the
coordinate is in the Western Hemisphere. If the coordinate has a
plus sign in front of it, the location is in the Eastern Hemisphere.
Suppose that you’re using latitude and longitude to locate the very
first recorded geocache (which happens to be outside of Estacada,
Oregon). Its coordinates are
45° 17' 27.6" N 122° 24' 47.99" W
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
46
A matter of degree
One degree is actually a pretty big unit of measure. One degree of latitude or longi-
tude is roughly equal to 70 miles. As my technical editor astutely points out, this is
a ballpark number. The distance associated with a degree of latitude remains fairly
constant no matter where you are, but the distance of a degree of longitude
decreases as you head from the equator toward either of the poles.
Degrees are composed of smaller, fractional amounts that sound like you’re telling
time.
 Degree: A degree is composed of 60 minutes.
One minute is about 1.2 miles.
 Minute: A minute is composed of 60 seconds.
One second is around .02 mile.
If you use minutes and seconds in conjunction with degrees, you can describe a
very accurate location.
Latitude and longitude measurement units are abbreviated with the following sym-
bols:
 Degree: °
 Minute: '
 Second: "

That means that the historical, first cache is
 45 degrees, 17 minutes, and 27.6 seconds north of the equator
 122 degrees, 24 minutes, 47.99 seconds west of the prime
meridian
Lots of latitude
Latitude and longitude are pretty straightforward and logical if you
think about it. Unfortunately, over the years, people have muddied
things a bit by coming up with different ways to represent latitude
and longitude coordinates.
Latitude and longitude coordinates can be written as
 Degrees, minutes, and seconds: This is the traditional way,
with the preceding example of the first recorded geocache
expressed as 45° 17' 27.6" N 122° 24' 47.99" W.
 Degrees and decimal minutes: Seconds are dropped, and the
decimal version of minutes is used along with degrees, so now
the cache is at 45° 17.46" N –122° 24.8". (The minus sign, in the
middle, indicates west.) This is probably the most common
format used for listing geocache coordinates.
 Decimal degrees: Minutes and seconds are both dropped, and
only the decimal representation of degrees is used, which puts
the cache at 45.291° N –122.413333°. (Once again, the conjoin-
ing minus sign implies west.)
Although they look different, all these coordinate notations point
to the same location. The math is pretty straightforward if you
want to convert the coordinates from one format to another, but
it’s a heck of a lot easier to point your Web browser to http://
jeeep.com/details/coord for a handy online conversion calcu-
lator if you need to.
UTM
UTM, which stands for Universal Transverse Mercator, is a modern
coordinate system developed in the 1940s. It’s similar to latitude
and longitude, but it uses meters instead of degrees, minutes, and
seconds. UTM coordinates are very accurate, and the system is
pretty easy to use and understand.
Chapter 3: Using a GPS Receiver 47

Although the United States hasn’t moved to the metric system,
the system is widely used by GPS receivers. UTM coordinates are
much easier than latitude and longitude to plot on paper maps.
The two key values to convert metric measurements are
 Meter: 1 meter = 3.28 feet = 1.09 yards.
For ballpark measurements, a meter is a bit over a yard.
 Kilometer: 1 kilometer = 1,000 meters = 3,280 feet = 1,094
yards = 0.62 mile.
For ballpark measurements, a kilometer is a bit more than half
a mile.
The UTM system is based on the simple A, B, C – 1, 2, 3 grid system,
with the world divided into zones. C’mon, c’mon, c’mon, let me tell
you what it’s all about:
 Sixty primary zones run north and south: Numbers identify
the zones that run north and south.
 Twenty optional zones run east to west:
• These zones indicate whether a coordinate is in the
Northern or Southern Hemisphere.
• Letters designate the east/west zones.
Often, the letter is dropped from a UTM coordinate, and only the
zone is used to make things simpler. For example, because most of
Florida is in Zone 17R, if you were plotting geocache locations in
the state, you could just use Zone 17 in your UTM coordinates.
Figure 3-2 shows the UTM zone map.
Figure 3-2: UTM zones of the world.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
48

To provide a precise location, UTM uses two units:
 Easting: The distance in meters to the east from the start of a
UTM zone line
The letter E follows Easting values.
 Northing: The distance in meters from the equator
The letter N follows Northing values.
There’s no such thing as a Southing. Northing is used in the Southern
Hemisphere to describe the distance away from the equator, even
though a location is south of the equator. (Is that weird, or what?)
Continuing with my example of the location of the very first
recorded geocache, if you want to use UTM to locate the cache,
the coordinates look like this:
10T 0546003 E 5015445 N
That means the cache is in Zone 10T, which is 5,015,445 meters
north of the equator and 546,003 meters east of where the zone
line starts. (For those of you without a calculator in front of you,
that’s about 3,116 miles north of the equator, and about 339 miles
east of where the number 10 zone line starts out in the Pacific
Ocean.)
Sometimes, you’ll see UTM coordinates written with the E and N
respectively placed before the Easting and Northing numbers
(notably with geocache coordinates listed at the Geocaching.com
site). Don’t panic; this is just another way of stating the coordi-
nates, and you should still be able to figure out which value is
which.
Understanding datums
A datum is a frame of reference for mapping. Because the Earth
isn’t flat, geographic coordinate systems use ellipsoids (think of
a sphere that’s not perfectly spherical, much like the shape of the
Earth) to calculate positions on our third planet from the sun. A
datum is the position of the ellipsoid relative to the center of the
Earth.
Chapter 3: Using a GPS Receiver 49

If that makes your brain hurt, don’t worry. Here are the only two
important and simple things that you need to know about datums
when it comes to geocaching:
 All maps have a datum.
Hundreds of different datums are in use throughout the
world, with cool names such as the Kerguelen Island,
Djakarta, Hu-Tzu-Shan, or Qornoq datums. Most good maps
used for navigation — and highway maps don’t count —
usually state which datum was used in making the map.
 You can set what datum your GPS receiver uses.
The default datum for GPS receivers is WGS 84, more formally
known as the World Geodetic System 1984. WGS 84 was adopted
as a world standard and is derived from a datum called the North
American Datum of 1983, or NAD 83.
Most United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps
that you use for hiking or serious geocaching are based on an ear-
lier datum called the North American Datum of 1927, or NAD 27.
This datum is divided up into different geographic areas, so if
you’re in the United States — at least in the lower 48 states —
use a version of NAD 27 that mentions the continental U.S.
Why is all this datum stuff so important? Suppose that the coordi-
nates of a geocache use the WGS 84 datum, but your GPS receiver
is set to use the NAD 27 datum. When you go out looking for the
cache, the location can be off as much as 200 meters, and there’s
a good chance you’ll never find the cache. The latitude and longi-
tude or UTM coordinates will be identical, but the location is going
to end up in two different spots because of the different datums.
(The same would hold true if you were trying to find a set of WGS
84 coordinates you recorded on your GPS receiver on a map that’s
based on the NAD 27 datum.)
The moral of the story is to make sure that the datum on your GPS
receiver matches the datum associated with the geocache coordi-
nates. The good news is that geocache coordinates almost always
tell you the datum used, so you won’t end up getting confused.
If you want to find out more about datums and map projections,
check out Peter Dana’s excellent Geographer’s Craft Web site
www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/notes.html.

Understanding waypoints
A waypoint is GPS lingo for a location or point that you store in
your GPS receiver. (Some manufacturers also call them marks or
landmarks.) A waypoint consists of the following information:
 Location: The location of the waypoint in whichever coordinate
system the GPS receiver is currently using. Some receivers also
store the elevation of the location.
 Name: The name of the waypoint. You get to choose your own
name, but the length varies between GPS receiver models from
six characters on up.
 Date and time: The date and time when the waypoint was
created.
 Optional icon or symbol: An optional icon or symbol associ-
ated with the waypoint that appears on the GPS receiver’s
map page when the area around the waypoint is displayed.
This could be a tent for a campground, a boat for a boat
launch, or a fish for a favorite fishing spot.
All GPS receivers can store waypoints, but the maximum number
that you can save varies from model to model. As a general rule,
as the price of a GPS receiver price goes up, so does the number
of waypoints that can be stored. Lower-end consumer GPS receivers
store from 100–250 waypoints, and top-of-the-line models can store
1,000 or more.
Waypoints are important for geocaching because you’ll create a
waypoint on your GPS receiver for each geocache you’re looking
for. After a waypoint is set, your GPS receiver has several features
that help guide you to that waypoint. (I talk more about this in the
upcoming section.)
Understanding routes
A route is a course that you’re currently traveling or plan to take. In
GPS terms, a route is the straight-line course between one or more
waypoints. If multiple waypoints are in a route, the course between
two waypoints is called a leg. A single route can be made up of a
number of legs.
Chapter 3: Using a GPS Receiver 51

After you create your route, the GPS receiver tells you how long
each of the legs will be and also the total distance of the route.
When you activate the route (tell the GPS receiver you’re ready
to use it), the following information is displayed:
 The direction you need to travel in order to reach the next
waypoint in the route
 How far away the next waypoint is
 How much time it’s going to take to get there
After you reach a waypoint in the route, the GPS receiver automati-
cally starts calculating the information for the next leg. This con-
tinues until you reach your final destination.
If you’re trying to find a series of geocaches in the same general
area, you could create a route to guide you to the caches in a
certain order.
A fair number of geocachers don’t use routes and find them to
be an overrated feature. (I happen to fall into that camp.) After
all, when you reach your first cache, you can easily select the
next cache location waypoint and be on your way.
Understanding tracks
Remember the story of Hansel and Gretel, the kids who dropped
breadcrumbs in the forest to try to find their way back home?
Their story would’ve had a different ending if they had a GPS
receiver because all newer GPS receivers leave electronic bread-
crumbs — tracks or trails, which are different names for the same
thing — as you travel. (Of course, in today’s tale, a little Pac-Man
could still leave little Hansel and Gretel stranded at the ginger-
bread house.) Every so often, the GPS receiver saves the coordi-
nates of the current position to memory. This series of tracks is
a track log or track history. (Because various GPS models handle
tracks differently, check your user manual for specific details.)
Note these differences between tracks and waypoints:
 Names and symbols: Although tracks and waypoints are both
location data points, tracks don’t have names or symbols asso-
ciated with them and can’t be edited in the GPS receiver.
 Autocreation: Unlike waypoints — which you need to manu-
ally enter — tracks are automatically created whenever a GPS
receiver is turned on (that is, if you have the Track feature
enabled).
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
52

If track logging is enabled, tracks are shown on the GPS receiver’s
map page while you move, just like a trail of breadcrumbs follow-
ing you. Because the GPS receiver constantly collects tracks while
it’s powered on, you need to clear the current track log before you
start a new trip. Some receivers also allow you to save the current
track log.
If you turn your GPS receiver off or if you lose satellite reception,
the GPS receiver stops recording tracks. When it’s turned back on
again or good satellite coverage resumes, the GPS receiver contin-
ues recording tracks, but it assumes that you traveled in a straight
line between the last track location saved before satellite reception
was lost and your current position.
Some GPS receivers allow you to set how often tracks are saved,
either by time or distance intervals. For example, you could spec-
ify that a track be saved every minute or each time that you travel
a tenth of a mile. Leaving the default, automatic setting for track
collection should work for most occasions.
When you reach your final destination, your GPS receiver can
optionally use the track log to help you navigate back to your start-
ing point by using the track data to guide you in retracing your
steps. Check your user manual for model-specific instructions
on how to do this.
Tracks are probably one of the most useful GPS receiver features if
you’re working with digital maps. From a number of free and com-
mercial mapping programs, you can overlay your tracks on top of
a map to see exactly where you’ve been. Check out Chapters 12
and 13 for some mapping Web sites and programs you can use
with your recorded tracks.
Depending on the model, GPS receivers can store between 1,000–
10,000 tracks and up to 10 track logs. If you exceed the maximum
number of tracks, the GPS receiver will either stop collecting tracks
or begin overwriting the oldest tracks that were collected first with
the most current ones. (Some GPS receivers let you define what
action to take.) The number of tracks collected over time depends
completely on your activity, speed, GPS coverage, and the GPS
receiver’s track settings.
Using Your GPS Receiver
After you have a basic understanding of coordinate systems,
datums, waypoints, routes, and tracks, you’re ready to start using
your GPS receiver.
Chapter 3: Using a GPS Receiver 53

Initializing a GPS receiver
If you just bought a GPS receiver for geocaching, you’ll need to
initialize it first (get an initial location fix and setting variables such
as your time zone). The type of initialization and the amount of
time that this takes depend on what information the GPS receiver
has received from the satellites and when.
The process is mostly all automatic, and you don’t need to do
much as your GPS receiver starts up and begins to acquire satel-
lites. Your GPS user manual might contain model-specific initializa-
tion information.
To initialize a new GPS receiver, take it outside to someplace that
has an unobstructed view of the sky (such as a large field or a
park) and turn on the power. (You did install the batteries first,
right?) After the start-up screen displays, the receiver will begin
trying to acquire satellites.
It can take anywhere from 5–30 minutes for the GPS receiver to
gather enough satellite data to get a position fix for the first time
(usually more toward the 5 minutes end of the scale). Don’t worry;
your GPS receiver isn’t going to be this slow all the time. After the
receiver is first initialized, it usually only takes 15–45 seconds to
lock on to the satellites when you turn it on in the future (if no
obstructions block the view of the sky).
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
54
GPS receiver initialization nitty-gritty
You really don’t need to know this technical information to operate your GPS
receiver, but to start acquiring satellites to get an accurate location fix, a GPS
receiver needs the following satellite data:
 A current almanac (rough positions of all the satellites in orbit)
 The GPS receiver’s current location
 The date and time
 Ephemeris data (precise position of individual satellites)
If some or all of the data is missing or out-of-date, the GPS receiver needs to get
updated information from the satellites before it can accurately fix a current posi-
tion. The types of data that are out-of-date or missing determine how long the GPS
receiver takes to initialize. If the GPS receiver is brand-new, has moved several
hundred miles away from where it was last used, or has been stored for a prolonged
period of time, initialization will take longer.

In order to speed up the location fix for the first time, or when the
GPS receiver has been moved hundreds of miles since it was last
turned on, many GPS receivers have an option where you move a
cursor on an onscreen map of the United States or world to show
your general location. Providing a general location helps the GPS
receiver narrow its search for satellites that are visible from your
present location, thus speeding up the initialization process.
Most GPS receivers have a satellite status page that’s displayed
while the receiver is acquiring satellites; see an example status
page in Figure 3-3. This page typically consists of two circles that
represent a dome of sky above your head. The outer circle is the
horizon, the inner circle is 45 degrees above the horizon, and the
center of the inner circle is directly overhead. The N on the page
represents north.
Figure 3-3: A GPS receiver 
satellite status page.
Based on the almanac information, the GPS receiver shows the
position of satellites within the circles, representing them with
unique numbers. As a signal from a satellite is acquired, the
number is highlighted or bolded.
Underneath the circles are a series of bar graphs with numbers
underneath them that represent signal strength. The numbers cor-
respond to the satellites the GPS receiver has located. The more a
bar is filled in, the stronger the GPS receiver is receiving signals
from that particular satellite.
Try moving your GPS receiver around to watch the satellite signal
strength change. If the signals are weak or you get a message about
poor satellite coverage, move to a different location and change
the position of the receiver to better align it with the satellites that
are shown onscreen. If you’re successful, you’ll see new satellites
Chapter 3: Using a GPS Receiver 55

acquired, the signal strength increase, or both. The more satellites
you acquire and the stronger the signals, the more accurate your
receiver will be.
Depending on your GPS receiver’s antenna type, holding the
receiver properly will optimize signal reception. If your GPS
receiver has a patch antenna, hold it face up, parallel to the
ground. If your GPS receiver has a quad helix antenna, hold it
straight up so that the top of the receiver is pointing toward
the sky. To see the differences between patch and quad helix
antennas, check out Chapter 2.
After the GPS receiver gets enough information from the satellites
to fix your location, the screen typically displays an Estimated
Position Error (EPE) number. Based on the satellite data received,
this is the estimated error for the current position. The smaller the
number displayed, which will either be in feet or meters, the more
accurate your position.
Estimated Position Error is a bit confusing. If you see an EPE of
20 feet, it doesn’t mean that you’re within 20 feet of the actual
coordinates. You’re actually within up to two times the distance
of the EPE (or even more) from the actual location. For example,
if you have an EPE of 50, your location could be 1–100 feet of the
actual coordinates. EPE is not a maximum distance away from
the actual location; it’s only a measurement estimate based on
available satellite data. To complicate things even further, differ-
ent GPS receiver manufacturers use different formulas for deter-
mining EPE. If you set three different GPS receiver brands next to
each other, they’ll all display different EPE numbers. Some manu-
facturers are conservative with their numbers, and others are opti-
mistic. Don’t get too caught up with EPE numbers; just treat them
as ballpark estimates — and remember, the smaller the number,
the better.
Changing receiver settings
After you initialize your GPS receiver for the first time, you should
change a few of the receiver’s default system settings. You only need
to do this once. A few GPS receivers will prompt you to make some
of these changes as part of the initialization process; these changes
mostly customize settings based on your location and needs. Check
your user manual for specific information on how to change the
system settings described here.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
56

Although GPS receivers have a number of system settings that you
can change, here are some of the important settings you’ll want to
initially adjust:
 Time: Your GPS receiver gets very precise time data from
atomic clocks aboard the satellites, but it’s up to you how
the time will be displayed. You need to specify
• Whether to use 24-hour (military time) or 12-hour (AM
and PM) time
• Whether Daylight Savings Time is automatically turned
on and off
• What your time zone is (or your offset from UTC, which
stands for Universal Coordinated Time, the world time
standard)
 Units of measure: Your GPS receiver can display distance
information in statute (such as feet and miles), nautical
(knots), or metric (meters and kilometers) formats. The
default setting for GPS units sold in the United States is
statute, so unless you want to use the more logical metric
system, leave the setting as-is.
 Coordinate system: By default, your GPS receiver displays
positions in latitude and longitude. If you want to use UTM
coordinates for geocaching, now’s the time to change the
setting.
 Datum: The default datum for all GPS receivers is WGS 84.
Unless you’re planning on using your receiver with maps
that have a different datum, leave the default setting.
 Battery type: The default battery setting on most GPS
receivers is alkaline. If you’re using another type of battery,
be sure to select the correct type. The battery type setting
doesn’t affect the GPS receiver’s operation; it only ensures that
the battery life is correctly displayed onscreen because differ-
ent types of batteries have different power characteristics.
 Language: Most GPS receivers are multilingual, so if you’d
rather view the user interface in a language other than English,
it’s as simple as selecting a different language from a menu.
Entering a waypoint
Remember that a waypoint is simply a location you mark in your
GPS receiver. The two types of waypoints that you can enter and
save to your GPS receiver are either a
Chapter 3: Using a GPS Receiver 57

 Known location: If you know the coordinates of a location
that you want to save as a waypoint (like a geocache, hint,
hint), you can manually enter it in the GPS receiver. (In Chap-
ter 5, I show you how to get geocache coordinates from the
Geocaching.com Web site that you can enter as waypoints.)
Again, check your user manual for directions on how to manu-
ally enter a waypoint for your GPS receiver.
or a
 Current location: GPS receivers have a button on the case or
an onscreen command for marking the current location as a
waypoint. (Check your user manual for details about how
waypoints are marked for your unit.) After the waypoint is
marked, the GPS receiver screen displays a waypoint informa-
tion page where you can name the waypoint and associate an
icon with it. A good example of using a current location way-
point is creating a waypoint for where your car is parked
while you’re geocaching so you can find your way back to it.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
58
Power to the people
All batteries are not created equal, and using different types can increase the
amount of time between battery changes on your GPS receiver. Here are some good
Internet resources to get you up to speed on batteries:
 Battery drain for selected GPS receivers: www.gpsinformation.net/
main/bat-5.txt. This site offers the lowdown on just how much juice dif-
ferent GPS receiver models consume.
 The Great Battery Shootout!: www.imaging-resource.com/ACCS/
BATTS/BATTS.HTM. This site is more oriented to digital cameras (not GPS
receiver-specific), but you’ll find some good data on how different types of bat-
teries perform.
 Battery University: www.batteryuniversity.com/index.htm. This
is an educational Web site with lots of information on rechargeable battery
technology.
 Newsgroups: sci.geo.satellite-nav. Do a Google Groups search in this
USENET newsgroup for batteries and be prepared to spend a couple of hours
reading through educational (and sometimes controversial) posts.
When you check out some of these sources, you’ll probably run into a reference to
mAh (milliampere-hours). Most rechargeable batteries like NiMH have the mAh
rating printed on their label. This rating refers to the battery capacity; typically, the
higher the mAh number, the longer the battery will last.

Always use meaningful names when you save a waypoint. GPS
receivers typically assign a sequential number as the default way-
point name. Although numbers and cryptic codes might make
sense when you enter them, I guarantee you that you probably
won’t remember what they mean a couple of weeks down the road.
Note: Some GPS receivers support waypoint names only in upper-
case characters, but others allow you to use both uppercase and
lowercase characters.
All the geocaches listed in the Geocaching.com database conve-
niently have six-character waypoint names that start with GC that
you can use when you enter the coordinates in your GPS receiver.
Using these waypoint names makes it easy to reference exactly
which geocache you’re searching for.
GPS receivers have a number of features that can help you navi-
gate to a waypoint that you’ve entered, which is a good segue to
the next section.
Navigating to a waypoint
Here’s where your GPS receiver plays a very important role in geo-
caching. All receivers have an information page that lists the way-
points that you’ve created and stored. (Again, check your user
manual for information on how to access and use this list.) The
waypoints can be listed by name or those closest to your current
location, and any of the waypoints in the list can be deleted or
edited. An example waypoint list page is shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4: GPS receiver 
waypoint list page.
By selecting a waypoint, no matter where you are, you can find
your way to it.
Chapter 3: Using a GPS Receiver 59

 The distance to the waypoint is shown and decreases or
increases as you get closer to or farther away from the
waypoint.
 The compass direction in degrees that you’ll need to head to
get to the waypoint is also shown. In Figure 3-4, the distance
and compass bearing to the first waypoint in a list, which is
selected, is shown.
GPS receivers designed for outdoor use always assume a straight
line as the route between your current location and a waypoint
(GPS receivers that support autorouting for street navigation are
an exception). That might be convenient for airplanes and boats, but
it doesn’t take into account cliffs, rivers, streams, private property,
and other obstacles on land that you might encounter while trying
to locate a geocache. That’s one of the reasons why a topographic
or other useful type of map is a good thing to have with you.
Depending on the GPS receiver model, other waypoint-related
information that you might be able to display includes
 Travel time: The amount of time it will take you to reach the
waypoint based on your current speed.
 Compass: A picture of a compass that displays the waypoint
direction heading.
 Directional arrow: An arrow that points in the correct direc-
tion that you should be heading.
 Navigational hints: A picture of a road that moves as you
travel. If the road is centered onscreen, your destination is
straight ahead. If the road veers to the right or the left, you
need to correct your course so that the road is centered. A
symbol associated with the waypoint will grow larger as you
get closer to it.
Most GPS receivers support simple plot displays, which are map
pages that show waypoint symbols, tracks, and your current posi-
tion. More advanced (and expensive) GPS receivers support more
sophisticated maps, and your waypoints and tracks appear along
with roads, rivers, bodies of water, and whatever features the map
shows. When the map page is displayed, you can zoom in, zoom
out, and move around the map with an onscreen cursor that you
control with buttons on the GPS receiver.
After you enter a waypoint for a geocache’s location, all these fea-
tures can be used in helping you get close to (or sometimes even
right on top of) the cache you’re looking for.

ompared with GPS technology, traditional maps and compasses
seem like musty old relics from a bygone era. After all, a GPS
receiver can easily tell you exactly where you are with a few button
presses and one glance at the screen. There are even models avail-
able that support digital maps that can show you the surrounding
terrain.
However, I think of maps, compasses, and GPS receivers the same
way I view basic math skills and electronic calculators. You should
know how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide without a calcula-
tor just in case you don’t have one or for some reason it’s not work-
ing. Knowing the fundamentals of using a map and compass is like
being able to do basic math on paper (or by counting your fingers).
When you’re geocaching, having a map and compass with you —
and knowing how to use them — serves two important purposes:
 Provides a navigation insurance policy in case you lose your
GPS receiver or it stops working.
 Helps you plan appropriate routes to get to a geocache.
(Sometimes the straight-line route that the GPS receiver
displays isn’t the best.)

In this chapter, I introduce you to the fundamentals of maps and
compasses. You discover how to select maps and compasses that
are well suited for geocaching, and I also present the fundamentals
of basic land navigation.
All about Compasses
Magnetic compasses are among the oldest navigation tools for get-
ting around on either land or water. In this section, I tell you why
you should carry a compass while you’re geocaching, explain how
compasses work, describe the parts of a compass, and provide
some tips on selecting a compass to use for geocaching.
Why do you need a compass?
You’re probably wondering that if you already have a GPS receiver
(especially if it has an electronic compass), why you should bother
carrying a compass while you’re geocaching. I’m glad you asked
because here are some good reasons why:
 Compasses don’t need batteries to tell you which direction
you’re going.
 Compasses work in deep canyons and under thick tree
canopies. GPS receivers sometimes don’t work under these
conditions.
 Water or extreme temperatures don’t affect compasses. In
general, compasses are far less fragile compared with GPS
receivers.
 Some geocaches require you to take compass bearings to
successfully find a cache.
 Compasses are relatively inexpensive. This makes them a
cheap, backup insurance policy just in case something bad
happens to your GPS receiver.
How compasses work
Compasses rely on the Earth’s magnetic field. The earliest com-
passes can be traced back to around 2500 B.C. During this time,
the Chinese discovered that the mineral we now call magnetite
(also known as lodestone) had magnetic properties and would
align itself in a north-south direction. Spoon-shaped pieces of
crafted magnetite — south-pointers — were used for divination.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
62

A long time went by until magnetite started to be used for naviga-
tion. By the 7th century, Chinese scholars discovered they could
magnetize iron needles with lodestones. These magnetic needles
could be suspended in water on a piece of wood or hung from a
silk thread and orient to a north-south direction. By the 15th cen-
tury, trading ships from China were actively using early compasses
during their voyages.
In addition to magnetic compasses, there are also other types of
compasses, such as gyroscopic and electronic flux gate. In this
chapter, I stick to talking about handheld magnetic compasses,
which is what you’ll be using when you’re geocaching.
Not much has really changed in terms of how a compass works
since the Chinese discovered the properties of magnetite. Modern
materials are used for production, but the basic principle of a mag-
netized needle pointing north remains unchanged.
Magnetic and true north
If you haven’t had much experience with maps and compasses,
you might think that there’s only one north. However, there are
actually two norths, and here is where things can get muddled
up if you don’t know the difference:
 True north: This is the location of the Earth’s axis of rotation
and the basis for lines of latitude and longitude. True north is
also known as geographic north. Most maps are oriented so
that the top of the map is always pointing toward true north.
 Magnetic north: This is the north that’s shown on a compass,
which is determined by the Earth’s internal magnetic field. The
magnetic north pole is currently about 800 miles south of the
true north pole.
In most places, when your compass points north, you need to either
add or subtract from the magnetic north setting to get true north,
and vice versa if you’re going from true north to magnetic north.
When someone gives you a compass direction heading, it will
either be true or magnetic (and ideally, he or she will have told
you which one). If not, I would usually guess magnetic — but
understand that I might end up off course because of the declina-
tion, which is a perfect introduction to the next section.
Understanding declination
Declination is a very important concept when you’re using a com-
pass. Although a compass’ magnetic needle does indeed point
north, the Earth’s magnetic field varies from place to place. Thus,
Chapter 4: Using a Map and Compass 63

if you’re converting between true and magnetic north, the number
of degrees that you need to add or subtract to get the correct value
depends on your location and how you’re using the map and com-
pass. (See the sidebar, “Declination dissected.”) This number is
declination. Figure 4-1 shows a declination map of the United States
to give you an idea of the different declination values throughout
the country.
In the United States, the line of zero declination (the agonic line)
runs from Wisconsin down through Alabama and across the Florida
panhandle. If you’re located along the imaginary agonic line, true
and magnetic north will be the same. The farther east or west you
move, the greater the distance between true and magnetic north.
Most topographic maps have the declination printed at the bottom
of the map so you can correctly adjust your compass. However, the
magnetic fields on the Earth do change over time, so the declination
on older maps might no longer be accurate. For example I have a
United States Geological Survey (USGS) map of Bend, Oregon that
states that the magnetic declination to use with the map is 19° east.
That was the declination recorded in 1981. The USGS hasn’t revised
the map yet, so this particular map is still being sold. In the spring
of 2004, when I was writing this book, the declination for Bend has
changed — it’s now a little less than 17° east.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
64
Declination dissected
Declination values are stated in degrees (either east or west, depending on which
side of the zero declination line you’re on), such as 20° east. Whether you subtract
or add the degrees depends on your location and how you’re using the map and
compass.
 Field compass to map: This means you’re reading a compass direction (a bear-
ing) and want to transfer that bearing (based on magnetic north) to a map that
is oriented to true north. If the declination is east, add the declination value to
the bearing. If the declination is west, subtract the declination value from the
bearing.
 Map to field compass: You’ve got a compass direction plotted on a map (based
on true north) and want to correctly transfer the bearing to a compass (which
is using magnetic north). If the declination is east, subtract the declination value
from the bearing. If the declination is west, add the declination value to the
bearing.
By the way, you can interchange the words outside and field. Surveyors, foresters,
and other folks use field to describe where they are; in the field means doing work
outside instead of work inside the office.

Figure 4-1: Declination map of the United States.
Even if the declination has changed only a few degrees, it can have
a big impact on navigation. For each degree your compass heading
is not correct, your position will be off 92 feet each mile. For exam-
ple, if the declination were 2 degrees off, over the course of 5 miles,
you’d end up 920 feet away from where you thought you’d be. The
farther you travel, the more impact an incorrect declination makes
in successfully reaching your destination.
To find out the current declination for any location, visit www.
ngdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/seg/gmag/declination1.pl.
Parts of a compass
Unlike a GPS receiver, a compass doesn’t have an LCD screen, but-
tons, and lots of electronic circuitry. Despite its rather simple
design, you still need to know about the different parts of a com-
pass and what they do. Take a look at the basic components of a
compass that you’ll use for geocaching (as shown in Figure 4-2).
Base plate
The base plate is a transparent piece of plastic on which the mag-
netic needle and dial are mounted. It has a direction of travel arrow
that you point in the direction you’re heading (or of which you want
to take a bearing, which I talk about more in the “Using a Map and
Compass” section later in this chapter). Many compasses also have
rulers with different scales printed on the base plate, which is handy
for measuring distances on maps. The base plate has a lanyard hole
through which you can thread a piece of small cord and then wear
the compass around your neck or on your wrist.

Figure 4-2: Parts of a compass.
Magnetic needle
The magnetic needle is the brains of the compass and points to
magnetic north. The needle is suspended on a frictionless pivot
point (typically a sapphire bearing). One end of the needle is col-
ored red, which indicates north.
The compass can be dampened or undampened.
 Dampened: The needle is suspended in a liquid. Liquid-
dampened compasses are preferred because they absorb
shock better and there isn’t as much needle bounce.
The fluid inside a compass is usually a mixture of 55 percent
distilled water and 45 percent ethyl alcohol, glycerin, or a
refined petroleum product. This prevents the liquid from
freezing in cold temperatures.
 Undampened: Air surrounds the compass needle, and no
liquid is present for dampening. These compasses are typi-
cally cheaper than dampened compasses but are less rugged.

Dial
The dial (also known as a bezel) is a round housing that is attached
to the base plate and encloses the needle. A series of numbers
from 0–360, with marks between the numbers, is printed on the
outside of the dial. These numbers and marks are compass direc-
tions, which are expressed in degrees.
 North: 360 degrees
 East: 90 degrees
 South: 180 degrees
 West: 270 degrees
The numeric value of the degree marks on a compass varies depend-
ing on the compass model. On more precise compasses, a single
mark represents one or two degrees. With lower-end compasses,
each mark can equal up to 10 degrees. A smaller increment means
the compass is potentially more accurate, but a lot of accuracy
depends on the user.
Compass scales come marked 0–360 degrees (azimuth), and 0–90
degrees (quadrant, with 0–90 degree marks repeated four times).
Although some surveyors favor the quadrant compasses, the aver-
age compass user can easily become confused by the scale. Before
you purchase a new compass, check the scale. For ease of use, I
recommend a 360° azimuth model.
In addition to the numbers and marks, there are also letters. N
(north), E (east), S (south), and W (west) are printed next to their
representative degree settings. Some compasses might also show
SE for southeast, SW for southwest, and so on.
You can rotate the compass dial by turning it clockwise or counter-
clockwise. This is how you take a compass bearing, which I talk
more about in the “Using a Map and Compass” section later in this
chapter.
The transparent bottom of the dial, just below the compass needle,
has a red outlined north alignment arrow printed on it as well as
several north-south orienting lines. When you rotate the dial, the
alignment arrow and the orienting lines move. I discuss how to
use these features when I talk about bearings and courses.
Optional features
In addition to these basic parts of a compass, some models might
have additional features, including
Chapter 4: Using a Map and Compass 67

 Adjustable declination: By turning a small screw, you can set
the correct magnetic declination for your location by moving
the north alignment arrow. With one of these types of com-
passes, you won’t need to manually add or subtract to get
true north.
 Luminous markings: Many compasses feature glow-in-the-
dark marks on the magnetic needle, dial, and direction of
travel arrow so you can use the compass in the dark or low
light.
 Magnifying glass: Some models have an area of the base plate
that serves as a magnifying glass. This is handy for reading
tiny detail on maps.
 Inclinometer: A few compasses, mostly designed for profes-
sional use, have a built-in inclinometer that allows you to
measure the degree of a slope.
 Global compasses: If you use a compass sold in the Northern
Hemisphere in the Southern Hemisphere (the other side of
the equator), the compass’ magnetic needle will dip down
and affect accuracy, and the dip is greater as you get closer
to the South Pole. Some compasses are specifically designed
to work in both hemispheres to avoid this problem.
None of these optional features are absolutely necessary for geo-
caching, and you end up paying a little more for them compared
with the cost of a basic compass.
The one optional figure that I would recommend is adjustable decli-
nation. You just set the declination for your part of the world and
forget about it — no pesky math formulas to remember. Just remem-
ber to change the declination to the correct value if you’re traveling
someplace else that has a different declination from home.
Selecting a compass
If you visit a sporting goods store or an online retailer, you’ll find
all sorts of compasses in different sizes and shapes, with a variety
of features. In this section, I briefly talk you through how to choose
a compass that you can use for geocaching and other outdoor
pursuits.
Types of compasses
Three types of compasses are suitable for geocaching: base plate,
sighting, and pocket. (Examples of these compasses are shown in
Figure 4-3.)
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
68

Figure 4-3: A base plate, sighting, and pocket compass.
Base plate compasses
As its name suggests, a base plate compass has a rectangular base
that’s a bit larger than the round housing that surrounds the com-
pass. You can lay the transparent base plate over a map and use
the markings and edges of the compass to help you navigate. Base
plate compasses are perfect for geocaching. These compasses are
priced in the $10–$35 price range.
Base plate compasses are also known as orienteering compasses
because the design was originally intended for the sport of orien-
teering. The versatility and usefulness of these compasses soon
spread outside the orienteering world, and the base plate compass
is popular for all outdoor pursuits. There are specialized com-
passes for orienteering, such as thumb compasses and competi-
tion models with magnetic needles that settle faster than a
standard compass.
Sighting compasses
A sighting compass is a base plate compass that’s designed so
you can make eye contact with whatever object or terrain feature
you’re pointing the compass toward. Usually, this is accomplished
Chapter 4: Using a Map and Compass 69

with a case with a mirror inside that surrounds the dial and flips
up and down. The mirror allows you to see the compass needle
and dial while you’re looking directly at the feature you have
sighted. Sighting compasses are among the most accurate hand-
held compasses and are designed for people who take their com-
pass work seriously. They range in price between $20 to over $100.
If you’ve served in the military, you’re probably familiar with a
lensatic compass. These compasses are favored by armed forces
for their ruggedness and precision (especially important if you’re
calling in an artillery strike). Quite honestly, lensatic compasses
are overkill for geocaching and hiking; you’re better off with a base
plate compass designed for orienteering because they’re lighter,
easier to use, and more versatile. Expect to pay around $100 for a
military-issue lensatic compass; cheaper knock-off models are
available on the market, but their quality is far below that of the
real thing.
Pocket compasses
These are small compasses that often only have the cardinal com-
pass points (north, south, east, west) or have marks in anywhere
from 10–90° increments. You’ll sometimes find these under-$10
compasses mounted on a thermometer or zipper pull. They’re fine
for giving you a general sense of direction but aren’t well suited for
navigation. Because they’re small and lightweight, they make good
back-up compasses.
Although compasses are very rarely wrong, sometimes outdoors
users mistakenly put trust in their own intuition. “The compass
must be broken because there’s no way that can be north!” Oops.
From my experience in search and rescue, I’ve seen this happen
with both novice and experienced hikers when their compass is
indeed showing the correct direction. If you don’t trust your com-
pass, try carrying two. When both are saying the same thing, it’s a
little harder to rationalize that your intuition is right and both com-
passes are wrong (although I’ve seen that happen on a few occa-
sions, too).
Compass manufacturers
The three main manufacturers of compasses are
 Brunton: www.brunton.com
 Silva: www.silvacompass.com
 Suunto: www.suunto.com
All these companies make excellent compasses that you can’t go
wrong with.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
70

I recommend that you stay away from cheaper, off-brand com-
passes. A compass is something that you should be able to depend
on, and the quality, durability, and dependability of bargain com-
passes are considerably less than those of the models produced
by any of the major compass manufacturers listed here.
The bottom line
To sum up my geocaching compass recommendations:
 Get a Brunton, Silva, or Suunto brand base plate or sighting
compass.
 Spend a few extra dollars to get a model with adjustable
declination.
 Choose a model with markings in 2° intervals (never more
than 5 degrees unless it’s a back-up pocket compass).
 Select an azimuth model with 0–360 degrees marked on the dial.
 Select a model that has easy-to-read numbers and marks on
the dial.
Because a compass relies on the Earth’s magnetic field to work, be
sure when you use it that you keep it away from any metal objects
(like a car hood) or electronic devices that generate an electromag-
netic field (such as a GPS receiver or handheld radio).
All about Maps
Call me old school, but I’m a firm believer that anyone who geo-
caches should know how to use maps. Although some geocachers
head out on their adventures armed with only a GPS receiver, a
map can help you find the best route to a cache as well as keep
you from getting lost if for some reason your GPS receiver stops
working and you’ve wandered too far off the beaten path.
In this section, I tell you why maps are important, discuss how to
select the right types of maps for geocaching, and finish up with
some basic pointers on how to read a map.
Why do you need a map?
If you wondered why you need a compass while you’re geocaching,
you’re probably asking yourself the same question about maps —
and I’m talking about maps printed on paper, not the digital maps
displayed on the screen of a GPS receiver. Guess what? I just happen
to have a list of reasons why maps are important, and here they are:
Chapter 4: Using a Map and Compass 71

 Paper maps can give you the “big picture” (unlike the maps
displayed on the small screen of a GPS receiver) and let you
plan the best route for finding a geocache.
When you enter the coordinates of a geocache in your GPS
receiver, the receiver will give you a straight-line route for get-
ting to the cache. That could be over rivers, down cliffs, and
on top of mountains. With a map, you can plan a potentially
easier and more enjoyable route.
 Many paper maps provide you with considerably more detail
about the terrain than can a map displayed on a GPS receiver
screen.
 Paper maps are easy to read in the bright sunlight, unlike many
GPS receiver screens.
 Paper maps don’t need batteries, and they work in places that
GPS receivers have trouble with, such as under tree canopies
or both natural and urban (tall buildings) canyons.
 Paper maps are lightweight, can be folded, and are easy to
store.
With some urban geocaches or caches that are close to major
roads and trails, taking a map with you probably isn’t required.
Based on the cache description, you should apply some common
sense as to whether you should bring a map with you.
Selecting the right map
Because you spend most of your time with your feet or tires on the
ground while geocaching, land maps are important to know how to
about. In general, the two types of land maps are
 Topographic: These maps show natural land features such as
lakes, rivers, and mountain peaks as well as man-made fea-
tures like roads, railroad tracks, and canals. These maps (see
an example in Figure 4-4) also have contour lines that trace
the outline of the terrain and show elevation. Contour lines
suggest what the land looks like in three dimensions (3-D).
 Planimetric: These maps don’t provide much information
about the terrain. Lakes, rivers, and mountain pass elevations
might be shown, but there isn’t any detailed land information.
A classic example of a planimetric map is a state highway map
or a road atlas. Planimetric maps are perfect in cities or on
highways, but they’re not suited for backcountry use. Figure
4-5 is a planimetric map of The Dalles, Oregon area.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
72

When you’re dealing with planimetric maps, you’ll often
encounter the terms atlas and gazetter.
• Atlas: A collection of maps, usually in a book
• Gazetteer: A geographical dictionary or a book that
gives the names and descriptions of places
Figure 4-4: A topographic map showing contour lines 
and other features.
Figure 4-5: A planimetric map lacks terrain features 
and contours.
Chapter 4: Using a Map and Compass 73

An important point to consider is there’s no single universal map
type for geocaching. Different map types display different features
and details that are suited for a particular use — or user. A skilled
map user always selects a map that meets his or her specific
needs.
USGS topographic maps
The most popular topographic maps for use within the U.S. are
made by the USGS. These maps cover different sizes of area; the
smaller the area, the greater the detail. Topographic maps are
often called topo maps.
The topo maps that show the most detail are sometimes called
quad sheets or 7.5 minute maps because they map just one quadran-
gle (geographer-speak for a rectangular piece of land) that covers
7.5 minutes of longitude and latitude. Figure 4-4, for example, is a
topographic map of The Dalles, Oregon.
Topo maps are perfect when your geocaching adventures involve
off-road hikes and treks. The maps are available in sporting goods
stores that cater to hikers, map retailers, and through online map
stores.
Topo maps can be pretty unwieldy while you’re out geocaching, so
here’s a helpful link on how to fold a large map: www.backpacker.
com/article/0,2646,6927,00.html.
Street maps
Topographic maps are great for when you get off the beaten path,
but when you’re geocaching, you usually end up driving on a paved
road up to some point before you head off on foot. That’s when a
good street map comes in handy. Street maps are also essential if
you’re looking for geocaches hidden in more urban areas (or letter-
boxing). A good source of street maps for an area is through the
local Chamber of Commerce or visitor center.
Digital maps
PCs and the Internet have revolutionized the world of maps. Instead
of heading down to the local map store to buy a map, you can visit a
free Web site or purchase a reasonably priced map software package
from companies such as DeLorme (www.delorme.com) or Maptech
(www.maptech.com) and create your own topographic or street
maps.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
74

Two of my favorite, free Web sites for creating geocaching maps are
 MapQuest (www.mapquest.com): Displays street maps for loca-
tions in the United States based on addresses or ZIP codes.
Here’s a sneaky way to get MapQuest to display a street map
near a geocache’s location. Enter this link in your browser:
www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?latlongtype=
decimal&latitude=44.032817&longitude=-121.330283
Replace the latitude and longitude values with the coordi-
nates for a geocache. The new values will need to be in deci-
mal degrees, so check out Chapter 3 for information on how
to convert from other coordinate formats.
 TerraServer-USA (www.terraserver-usa.com): Displays
USGS topographic maps and aerial photos (which can be
extremely useful in pinpointing geocache locations). You can
enter the coordinates of a cache, and the Web site will gener-
ate a map of the surrounding area that you can print out.
If you want to read more detailed information about the many digi-
tal map programs and Web sites that are available, check out GPS
For Dummies (Wiley), written by yours truly.
If you’re geocaching outside the United States and are looking for
digital maps, pay a visit to oddens.geog.uu.nl/index.html.
Odden’s Bookmarks is one of the most comprehensive collection
of map links on the Internet. This European Web site has over
20,000 links to maps and map sites all over the world. You can
spend hours browsing through links to international map sources.
Understanding parts of a map
Having a map with you while you’re geocaching is a one thing, but
being able to effectively use it is another. In this section, I bring
you up to speed on the types of information that you’ll find on
maps and how to interpret what some of the numbers, symbols,
and squiggly lines mean.
Maps are almost always oriented so the top of the map is facing
north. If a map doesn’t follow this convention, a good mapmaker
places an arrow on the map that points north.
Scale
Most maps have a scale, which is the ratio of the horizontal distance
on the map to the corresponding horizontal distance on the ground.
For example, 1 inch on a map can represent 1 mile on the ground.
Chapter 4: Using a Map and Compass 75

The map scale is usually shown at the bottom of the map in the
legend. Often, rulers with the scale mark specific distances for you.
A scale from a USGS topographic map is shown in Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-6: Scale information in on a USGS 7.5 minute 
topographic map.
Many maps use a representative fraction to describe scale. This is
the ratio of the map distance to the ground distance in the same
units of measure. For example, a map that’s 1:24,000-scale means
that 1 inch measured on the map is equivalent to 24,000 inches
on the ground. The number can be inches, feet, millimeters, cen-
timeters, or some other unit of measure.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
76
Anatomy of a map
Most maps have basic elements in common. Here are some, along with the terms
that cartographers (mapmakers) use to describe them:
 Citation: This is information about data sources used in making the map and
when the map was made.
 Collar: This is the white space that surrounds the neatline (see the upcoming
bullet) and the mapped area.
 Compass rose: A map has either a simple arrow that shows north or a full com-
pass rose (an image that indicates all four cardinal points: North, East, South,
and West) so the user can correctly orient the map to a compass.
 Coordinates: Maps usually have either letters and numbers or coordinates, such
as latitude and longitude values, marked along the borders so users can locate
positions on the map.
 Legend: This is a box that shows an explanation of symbols used on the map.
Some maps show all the symbols; others rely on a separate symbol guide.
 Mapped area: This is the main part of the map, displaying the geographic area.
 Neatline: This is the line that surrounds the mapped area.
 Scale: This distance-equivalence information (such as one inch = one mile) helps
you estimate distances on a map and is typically found at the bottom of a map.
 Title: This is usually the name of the map, but it also tells you which area it’s
mapping.

The units on the top and bottom of the representative fraction
must be the same. You can’t mix measurement units.
When you’re dealing with scale, keep these guidelines in mind:
 The smaller the number to the right of the 1, the more detail
the map has.
A 1:24,000 map has much more detail than a 1:100,000-scale
map. A 1:24,000 map is a large-scale map, showing a small area.
 The smaller the number to the right of the 1, the smaller the
area the map displays.
In Figure 4-7, the 1:100,000-scale map shows a much larger
area than the 1:24,000-scale map. A 1:100,000 map is a small-
scale map and shows a large area.
Figure 4-7: 1:100,000 and 1:24,000 scale maps show different details and areas.
Coordinate marks
Any map that’s suitable for navigation will have coordinate system
marks printed. For topographic maps, these marks are typically in
latitude and longitude, UTM, or both. (For more about the latitude
and longitude and UTM coordinate systems, see Chapter 3.) The
marks are usually found on the map collar with the major intervals
numbered. For example, the top corner of a topographic map
might show the latitude and longitude.
The coordinate marks help you identify specific locations on a
map. For example, if you had the coordinates of a geocache, you
could find its location on a map by lining up the coordinate marks
on the side of the map.

Transparent overlay rulers and grids make plotting positions
and measuring distances on maps a piece of cake. Check out
www.maptools.com for some free PDF files with rulers and grids
that you can print out on transparency sheets. You can also pur-
chase already made rulers and grids.
Citations
A citation contains information about when the map was made and
what datum was used in making the map, although not all maps
have this data. (Check out Chapter 3 for the scoop on datums and
why they’re critical for successful geocaching.) These two bits of
information are important because they give you an idea of how
accurate the map will represent the current terrain (especially in
areas that have experienced a lot of change, such as development)
and which datum you should set your GPS receiver for if you’re
using it with that particular map. The citation usually appears at
the bottom of the map.
Symbols
Symbols — icons, lines, and colored shading, as well as circles,
squares, and other shapes — are important parts of a map’s lan-
guage. They give the map more detailed meaning without clutter-
ing up the picture with too many words. They represent roads,
rivers, railroads, buildings, cities, and just about any natural or
man-made feature you can think of. Symbols definitions are either
shown on the map or are compiled in a separate map symbol
guide. Some common symbols found on USGS topographic maps
are shown in Figure 4-8.
Whether you’re using a paper or a digital map, always familiarize
yourself with its symbols. The more symbols you know, the better
decisions you’ll make when you’re relying on a map for navigation.
Map symbols aren’t universal. A symbol can have different mean-
ings on different maps. For example, the symbol for a secondary
highway on a USGS topographic map is a railroad on a Swiss map.
You can get a small booklet that contains the full list of USGS sym-
bols at most places that sell topographic maps, or you can view all
of the symbols online at http://mac.usgs.gov/mac/isb/pubs/
booklets/symbols.
Contours
Contour lines are continuous lines found on topographic maps that
provide information about elevation. Each line represents a specific
elevation; all locations along that line have the exact same elevation.
On USGS topographic maps, contour lines are brown.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
78

Figure 4-8: Selected USGS topographic map symbols.
To make the contour lines easier to read, every fifth line — an
index contour — is printed darker. If you follow the index contour
line, you’ll eventually find the elevation associated with the line
printed. The thinner or lighter-colored contour lines are intermediate
contours and don’t have printed elevations associated with them.
The contour interval is the difference in elevation between two
adjacent contour lines. Usually, the contour interval is printed on
the legend or collar of a map. For example, if a map reads Contour
Chapter 4: Using a Map and Compass 79
Color my world
USGS topographic maps use colors for map symbols and features to make them
easier to identify and to provide a natural appearance to the maps. The colors include
 Black: Boundaries and most cultural or man-made features
 Blue: Water features such as lakes, rivers, and swamps
 Green: Vegetation such as woods, orchards, and vineyards
 Brown: Relief features such as contours, cuts, and fills
 Purple: Updated information
 Red: Main roads, built-up areas, boundaries, and special features
If you’re making a copy of a colored map, always opt for color instead of black and
white so its features are easier to identify.

Interval 20 Feet, the elevation change between contour lines is
20 feet.
Another way to determine elevation on a USGS topographic map is
to use spot elevation. If you see an X printed with a number next to
it, this is the elevation of the spot marked that’s with the X.
By looking at how closely contour lines are spaced on a map, you
can get a good sense of what the elevation change is going to be like.
If the lines are widely spaced, the elevation doesn’t change much,
and the terrain is mostly flat. If the contour lines are close together,
the elevation change will be greater. In a nutshell, the more contour
lines that are grouped close together, the steeper the terrain.
In addition to getting a sense of elevation change, contour lines can
also clue you as to what the terrain looks like. Think of contour lines
like a layer cake, with each contour elevation defining the height and
shape of the cake layer. Figure 4-9 shows different contour lines that
appear on a map and how the landforms associated with the con-
tours would appear in real life.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
80
Contour clues
How contour lines appear on a map can give you some important clues as to what
kind of terrain you might be traversing to reach a geocache. Here are some general
guidelines for interpreting contour lines on maps:
 Contour lines are V-shaped in streambeds and narrow valleys (stretches of low
land between hills or mountains). The point of the V points uphill or upstream.
 Contour lines are U-shaped on ridges (long narrow sections of land, often
located on a mountainside), with the bottom of the U pointing down the ridge.
 Contour lines form an M or a W shape just before a stream junction.
 Closely spaced contour lines mean steep terrain. Very narrowly spaced con-
tour lines mean a cliff.
 Equally spaced contour lines means that the terrain has a uniform slope.
 A small, closed contour line indicates a depression (a low place in the ground
with no outlet for surface drainage) or a summit. If there are hash marks inside
the circle, it’s a depression.
 Contour lines are typically smooth. When they’re not, it could mean large rock
outcrops, cliffs, or fractured areas of the Earth’s surface.
 The larger the contour intervals, the more difficult it is to figure out what the
terrain is like.

Figure 4-9: Contour lines and associated landforms.
Using a Map and Compass
Maps and compasses go together like bread and butter (or steak
and eggs if you’re on a low-carb diet). Although each can be used
by itself to a certain degree, to get the most out of these two navi-
gation tools, you should use them together. By using a map and
compass in tandem, you can determine your location even when
your GPS receiver can’t.

Chapter 4: Using a Map and Compass 81

In this section, I introduce you to some basic land navigation con-
cepts, including how to orient a map, how to take a bearing and set
a course, and how to use triangulation to determine where you’re
located.
You can’t just a read a book, even this one, and immediately
develop good map and compass skills. It takes time and experi-
ence to become an outstanding land navigator. If you want to fully
develop your map and compass skills, you need to practice. You
might also consider getting involved with a local orienteering club
or taking a community college course. In both cases, you’ll get some
field experience with someone standing over your shoulder show-
ing you the ropes.
Getting familiar with basic
navigation concepts
Before you start using maps and a compass together, you should
be aware of some basic land navigation concepts and terminology.
Holding the compass
Many people new to land navigation think you just look at a com-
pass and go. However, holding a compass incorrectly can affect
its accuracy. Here are some tips to maximize your accuracy:
 Always hold the compass level so that the needle swings
freely. You don’t want the needle moving or tipped down
toward the base plate.
 Bend your elbows close to your sides. This keeps the com-
pass steady and prevents the needle from bouncing around.
 You should hold the compass at a height that lets you take
a line of sight reading, matching up the direction of travel
arrow with the degree marks on the compass dial. You should
be able to turn the dial without causing the needle to move
around too much.
 When you look at the compass, raise and lower your eyes
instead of moving your head.
 Keep the compass away from metal objects and electronic
devices (such as GPS receivers). Both can cause inaccurate
readings because of their magnetic fields.
Never, ever use a map and a compass on a car hood. I’ve seen it
happen a couple of times, and the errors caused by the metal
hood weren’t too pretty.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
82

Understanding degrees
Whenever you use a compass, you need to visualize that you’re
standing in the center of a big imaginary pie (the flavor is up to
you) that’s been divided up into 360 equal pieces. In navigation
terms, each one of these pie slices equals one degree.
A circle that’s divided into 360 degrees allows you to accurately
state a direction of anything that surrounds you, no matter where
it is. (The technical map-speak term for such a direction is an
azimuth.)
The degrees are numbered clockwise and start with 0 degrees
(the same as 360 degrees), which is north, followed by 90 degrees
(east), 180 degrees (south), and 270 degrees (west).
Understanding bearings and courses
A bearing is simply a direction to some object or terrain feature
from your current position, expressed in degrees. (I’ll show you
how to take a bearing with your compass coming up shortly.)
A course is a set direction that you’re traveling. For example, if you
want to head to a geocache that you know is under a radio tower
on a hill, you’d take a bearing to the radio tower. The compass direc-
tion would be the course you would follow to reach the tower.
When you’re using a map and compass, always take magnetic
declination into account. Most topographic maps have the dec-
lination printed at the bottom of the map as an aid to compass
users. However, keep in mind that the declination might have
changed since the map was originally made.
Orienting the map to north
Orienting the map north means positioning the map so that you, the
map, and the compass all are facing north. Doing so lets you read-
ily recognize terrain features on the map. For example, if there were
a river fork on your right, by orienting the map to the north, you
could estimate your position by looking for any river forks on the
map that appeared to the east. To orient a map, follow these steps:
1. Rotate the compass dial so that north is lined up with the
direction of travel arrow.
2. Take the compass and map in your hand and place the
edge of the compass on the margin of the map or on any
line that runs north and south.
Chapter 4: Using a Map and Compass 83

The top of the map is almost always north.
3. Turn your body (while still holding the map and com-
pass) until the magnetic needle is lined up with north
on the compass dial.
The map is now oriented to the north.
Taking a bearing
Bearings (the compass direction of an object or terrain feature) are
pretty straightforward to take. Here’s how:
1. Point the compass’s direction of travel arrow at an object
or terrain feature.
2. Rotate the compass dial until the magnetic needle lines
up with the red, north alignment arrow.
3. Read the degree mark that lines up with the direction of
travel arrow.
Those degrees are your magnetic bearing. (If you want to
transfer that bearing to a map, you’ll need to account for
declination, which I describe in the “Declination dissected”
sidebar earlier in the chapter.)
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
84
Topographic orientation
Another way to orient a map is by using two prominent landmarks. Let me give you
an example. Suppose you’re out geocaching and see a mesa (a table-shaped moun-
tain) off to your right. To your left is a fork in a river. You’d locate these two features
on the map and then turn the map until the features on the map matched the gen-
eral direction in which the actual landmarks appeared.
Congratulations, your map is now oriented so that the top of the map is pointing
north. The technique is terrain association, which is simply associating the map to
fit the terrain. (Check out: www.online-orienteering.net/elevation_
relief/48 for descriptions and illustrations of major terrain features such as hills,
valleys, saddles and ridges.)
Terrain association can also be used for figuring out your current position. By look-
ing for features you see around you and then matching them to features on the map,
you can zero in on your location. This takes some practice and skill in reading the
terrain on a map and then translating it into what it would look like in real life. Even
skilled navigators sometimes “bend the map” — that is, compare the terrain and
map features and force the map to erroneously validate where they think they are.

An old memory jogger for this process is Put Red Fred in the shed —
Red Fred being the magnetic needle, and the shed being the out-
lined, red north alignment arrow that moves when you turn the
compass dial.
Sometimes it’s useful to know the compass direction from some
object or feature back to your current position. This is a back bearing.
Here are the two ways to get a back bearing:
 Find the bearing to the object or feature from your current
position and then add or subtract 180.
The number you get must be between 0 and 360.
or
 Take a bearing to the object or feature, and instead of put-
ting Red Fred in the shed, rotate the compass dial so that
the red magnetic north needle lines the black, opposite side
of the north alignment arrow.
The most common mistake I’ve seen people make when taking a
bearing is to rotate the compass dial so the magnetic needle is
aligned south instead of north. Doing so will give you a bearing
that is off by 180°. Always double-check your alignment and
remember to account for declination.
Setting a course
Sometimes you’ll encounter a geocache that tells you to walk a set
distance (such as 20 paces) following a certain compass bearing
before you can get to the cache. To find the cache, you’ll need to
set a course. Here’s how:
1. Turn the compass dial so that the direction you want
to head in degrees lines up with the direction of travel
arrow.
2. Turn your entire body until the red, magnetic north
needle lines up with the red north alignment arrow.
Put Red Fred in the shed.
The direction of travel arrow now points to your course heading,
which you can follow to the cache.
Breaking a course into legs
If you’re following a fairly long compass course, break the course
up into straight-line legs. A leg is simply a collection of shorter
Chapter 4: Using a Map and Compass 85

segments of a single course. To break up a course into legs, follow
these steps (bad pun intended):
1. Find some readily distinguishable, stationary object on
the course’s compass bearing.
It might be a uniquely shaped tree, rock, or any feature or
object that stands out from the rest of the terrain. After
you select an object, burn it into your memory just in case
something temporarily obscures the object while you’re
walking toward it.
2. Walk to that object or feature.
You don’t need to be looking at your compass or even walk-
ing in a straight line because you know that the feature is
on your course’s compass bearing.
3. When you get to the feature, go through the steps des-
cribed earlier for setting a course, using the same com-
pass bearing you started with.
4. Identify another unique feature (or a readily recognizable
map terrain feature) on the bearing and head toward it.
Repeat these steps until you reach your destination.
Using your compass as a protractor
Say you want to set a course between two known points on a map.
You’re at point A and want to get to point B but need to figure out
the correct compass bearing to set your course. You can easily do
this by using your compass as a protractor. To do so, follow along:
1. Lay your compass flat on a map, placing the back edge of
the base plate on point A.
The back of the compass is the part of the base plate that
doesn’t have the direction of travel arrow.
2. Use the edge of the compass to make a straight line
between point A and point B.
If the edge isn’t long enough, lay a ruler along the compass
edge to extend the edge until it reaches point B.
3. Rotate the compass dial so that the north-south orienting
lines are parallel with the map’s margins.
The north alignment arrow should be facing up. Don’t pay
any attention to the magnetic needle; you don’t need it
when you’re using your compass as a protractor.
The degree value on the compass dial that lines up with the direc-
tion of travel arrow is the bearing between point A and B.
Part I: Getting Ready to Geocache 
86

You did remember declination, didn’t you?
Another navigational skill you might want to develop is pacing.
Pacing is simply counting the number of steps it takes to cover a
certain distance. Use your GPS receiver to measure a set distance
and then count each step you take. Do this several times to come
up with an average. Your pace count will change depending on the
terrain (smooth or rugged, flat, uphill, or downhill).
Using triangulation
Even with a GPS receiver, there are times when you’re going to ask
yourself, “Just where the heck am I?” Triangulation is one way of
using a map and compass to determine your current location. (This
is an especially good skill to have if your GPS receiver stops work-
ing and you end up lost.) It involves identifying at least three promi-
nent and distinct features you can see (such as a mountain summit,
radio tower, or fork in a river), finding them on your map, and then
using your compass to plot your position. Here’s the process:
1. Locate three prominent features you can see that aren’t
close to one another.
You’ll get the most accuracy if the three points are around
120 degrees apart.
Triangulation can also be done with two known landmarks
(technically called biangulation), but three or more points
give you a higher level of accuracy in plotting your location.
2. Use a compass to take a bearing from your current loca-
tion to the first feature.
3. Rotate the compass dial so the bearing to the feature
lines up with the direction of travel arrow.
4. Lay your map flat and locate the feature on the map.
5. Put the compass on the map so that the edge of the com-
pass points towards and is on the feature.
6. While keeping the edge on the feature, rotate the entire
compass so that the north-south orienting lines point
north.
7. Draw a line down the edge of the compass toward your
position. (The edge of the compass should still be on the
feature.)
This line passes through all the locations that have the
bearing you recorded when viewing the feature.
8. Repeat Steps 2–7 for the other two features.
Chapter 4: Using a Map and Compass 87

You’re probably getting tired of me saying this by now, but you did
remember declination, didn’t you? If not, cruise to the “Declination
dissected” sidebar elsewhere in the chapter.
The three lines will intersect and form a triangle. Your approxi-
mate position should be somewhere within that triangle. Figure
4-10 shows a located position by using triangulation.
Figure 4-10: Determine your position by triangulation.
This chapter gives you some basic map and compass skills you
can use while you’re geocaching. It really only scratches the sur-
face when it comes to land navigation, though. To find out more
about this topic, I suggest you pick up a copy of the classic book,

you how to use the Geocaching.com Web site database to
list geocaches that are in your own neighborhood or any-
where in the world. You’ll read about what information
is associated with a geocache, and how to use it to help

also ﬁnd some hints and tips for discovering elusive
caches.
With any luck, you’ll soon locate the hidden cache —
and in Chapter 7, you can read what to do when you do,
including leaving goodies and logging your ﬁnd both in the
cache’s logbook and online. After you’ve geocached for a
while, you might decide you want to hide your own cache.
You’ll ﬁnd everything you need to know about hiding and
maintaining caches in Chapter 8, including what types of
containers to use, clever hiding places, where and where
not to hide caches, and how to list your cache in the

f you were searching for the lost treasure of Captain Jack
Sparrow, you certainly wouldn’t just wander around aimlessly,
looking in every nook and cranny for its hiding place. No, you’d
get yourself a genuine pirate treasure map first, and then proceed
to where X marks the sport. Spot. Whatever. Savvy?
The same holds true for geocaching, but instead of using a faded
sheet of parchment to start your quest for a geocache, you’ll go
much more high-tech with a Web browser and an Internet connec-
tion. Your first port of call is the Geocaching.com Web site (www.
geocaching.com), the ’Net’s largest collection of geocache infor-
mation. There, you specify where you’d like to go treasure hunting,
and a list of nearby geocaches, with descriptions and coordinates,
is displayed. With this in hand, you can start looking for the booty.
(I describe how to go about the actual searching in Chapter 6.)
In this chapter, you discover the different types of geocaches that
you can look for. Then you take a whirlwind tour of the Geocaching.
com Web site, finding out how to use basic and advanced search
features to list geocaches. You also discover all the descriptive
information you can get for a geocache — which is critical when
you set out on foot searching for a cache.

Defining the Types of Geocaches
Before you start searching for geocaches, knowing what types of
caches you might encounter is a good idea (although you needn’t
worry about turning up cursed Aztec gold). In this section, I briefly
describe the different types of caches that the Geocaching.com data-
base contains. When you view a list of geocaches (which I talk about
later in the chapter), each of the caches has an icon associated with
it so you can easily tell what type of cache it is.
The two main types of geocachers are those who search for all
types of caches and those who primarily focus on certain type of
caches. If you’re just getting started in the sport, I suggest that you
initially try to find all different types to caches to increase your
experience and skills. After you put a number of cache notches in
your GPS receiver, you can start specializing if you’re so inclined.
Traditional cache
A traditional geocache hearkens back to the very first cache that
Dave Ulmer hid back in May, 2000: some type of container (such as
a surplus ammo can, bucket, or plastic food storage container), a
logbook for people to sign, and a collection of trinkets that cache
finders can exchange. Look for the single-container icon, as shown
in the margin.
Multicache
A multicache (as in multiple) is a geocache with more than one
location. The two types of these caches are
 Offset caches: An offset cache has a series of hidden contain-
ers or markers. (These types of caches can also incorporate
historical monuments, plaques, or benchmarks. When you
find the first location, there are directions to the next one,
and so on, until you locate the final cache, which has the log-
book and the goodies.
 Clue caches: Clue caches have questions and clues posted
in their description that you must resolve to reach your final
destination. For example, Count the number of rusted bolts on
the post. The latitude coordinate is N 43 degrees, with correct
number of minutes equal to 19 times the number of bolts. So
if you count 28 bolts and multiply that number by 19, you get
532 — and thus you need to head to 43 degrees, 532 minutes
north.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
92

The multicache icon shows two containers, as shown in the margin
here.
Traditional geocaches and multicaches make up the majority of
caches listed in the Geocaching.com database.
Virtual cache
A virtual cache doesn’t have a hidden container, logbook, or good-
ies. The coordinates point to a location with a gorgeous view, an
interesting historical spot, or someplace that catches a geocacher’s
fancy that he or she wants to share. Usually it’s a location where
you couldn’t place a conventional cache, for practical (a paved
scenic overlook where there’s nowhere to really place a cache) or
legal (such as a U.S. National Park site where hiding caches is pro-
hibited) reasons.
The ghost icon for a virtual geocache doesn’t mean that it is a
haunted geocache. A haunted geocache is a cache purposely placed
in a spooky or creepy place — think Blair Witch Project. No icons
are associated with haunted caches, but the description will clue
you in . . . and you can visit them if you dare.
Mystery cache
A mystery or puzzle geocache contains clues on the cache informa-
tion page that you must solve before you can find the cache. Often,
the coordinates of a starting point are given, and you must figure
out the puzzle or puzzle pieces to start out. (Note: Many multi-
caches formally fall into the mystery cache category but are still
labeled as multicaches.) Mystery caches carry a question mark
icon, as shown in the margin.
Locationless cache
When you go geocaching, you normally start with a set of coordi-
nates and try to find a hidden container at that location. A location-
less cache works in reverse. You’re asked to locate a specific object
and feature and then post the coordinates (and usually a digital
photo) to the Geocaching.com site. You might be asked to locate
a certain type of neon sign, an aircraft navigation aid, or a building
with a unique architectural style. There aren’t as many locationless
geocaches as conventional caches, but they are kind of fun.
The icon for a locationless cache is a globe with a flag at the top,
as shown in the margin.
Chapter 5: Selecting Geocaches to Find 93

Letterbox hybrid
Geocaching has its roots in the old British pastime of letterboxing
(see www.letterboxing.org), which uses hidden containers, log-
books, and rubber ink stamps. Some hidden sites are both modern
geocaches and traditional letterboxes. A sealed envelope icon
points you to a letterbox cache, as shown in the margin.
Event cache
An event cache is a posted notice of a geocaching get-together.
It contains the date, time, place and description of an event.
The event could be a group geocaching outing or an informal
meeting at a local pizza place to talk about geocaching. Event
caches expire — that is, after they take place, they’re removed
from the Geocaching.com database just in case someone misreads
the date and shows up wondering where everyone is. If you see a
grayed-out event listing in the site database, the event has already
taken place.
Event caches are denoted by a speech bubble icon, as shown in
the margin.
Webcam cache
Webcam caches aren’t really hidden caches per se but rather the
locations of outdoors Web cams. The cache hider provides the
coordinates of the Web cam and a link to its Web site. Your quest
is to find the Web camera; when you do, you pose for a picture
as your proof. When you then log your find on Geocaching.com,
you’re usually asked to submit a screen capture from the Web cam
site of you posing. This means that you need a cellphone so you
can call someone to go to the Web cam’s site and save the screen
image.
The icon for a Webcam cache looks like . . . um, a Web cam, sort of.
See the margin.
Caches within caches
A few other types of geocaches don’t fall into one of the primary
cache types. These geocaches might be traditional, multicache, or
mystery caches with a unique flavor of their own.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
94

Theme caches
Some geocaches have specific themes, such as a TV show (Star
Trek), book (Harry Potter), or a certain type of animal (penguins,
for example). The cache hider is a fan of the theme and stuffs his
or her cache with associated goodies. Theme caches are identified
in the geocache description. If you visit the cache, you’re asked to
bring something that relates to the theme.
Chapter 5: Selecting Geocaches to Find 95
Travel Bugs
A Travel Bug is a trinket placed in a cache that has a special dog tag attached to it.
Key chains, toy cars, and small dolls are examples of items that have become Travel
Bugs. As their name suggests, Travel Bugs are meant for traveling. If a geocacher
finds one in a cache, he or she is supposed to move it to another cache. Each of the
Travel Bug dog tags has a unique number stamped on it, and their journeys can be
tracked on the Geocaching.com Web site.
For example, a Star Wars Darth Vader action figure Travel Bug started his travels
in an Arkansas geocache in February, 2002. By the time he was returned to his
owner nine months later, he had journeyed 17,534.64 miles, including tagging along
on aerial combat missions in Afghanistan, pub-hopping in England, and working on
his tan in Florida. At last report, Darth was getting some well-deserved R&R in Texas.
When you view a list of geocaches, caches that contain Travel Bugs have an icon
that looks like the bug on the special dog tag pictured here. I tell you more about
Travel Bugs, including how to set your own loose, in Chapter 8.

Microcaches
Microcaches are very small caches that contain only a log or a
single piece of paper that identifies it as a geocache. Microcaches
can be some of the most challenging geocaches to find because of
their small size and large number of possible hiding places. You’ll
typically find microcaches in miniscule containers such as plastic
35mm film canisters or candy tins. Microcache hiders can get dev-
ilishly clever; microcaches have been discovered on the back of
plastic-coated leaves and in hollowed-out bolts. Microcaches tend
to be located in more urban versus rural areas, and the hider will
warn you ahead of time in the online description that you’ll be
looking for one of these itsy, bitsy caches.
Log caches
Log caches have nothing to do with timber or Paul Bunyan. They
contain only a logbook, which you’re asked to sign. There are no
goodies to take, and you’re asked not to leave anything. As with
the other cache types, log caches are identified in the cache
description.
Using Geocaching.com
The Geocaching.com Web site (www.geocaching.com) is where
all the action takes place on the Internet. Anyone can visit the site
and get free, up-to-date information about geocaches all over the
world. You have lots of caches to choose from, too. In April, 2004,
over 91,000 active geocaches were listed in its database, in 201 dif-
ferent countries — and the number grows on a daily basis.
In the remainder of this chapter, I talk about how you can use
Geocaching.com to search for geocaches — online, that is. Read
Chapter 6 for the scoop on searching in the real world. Before I
get into the nitty-gritty of gathering information about geocaches,
I want to talk a little about Geocaching.com and accounts.
Here are the three levels of access to the Geocaching.com site,
each associated with different types of accounts:
 No account: As I mention earlier, the Geocaching.com site
can be used freely by anyone interested in searching for geo-
caches. All you need are a Web browser and an Internet con-
nection to view geocache coordinates and information.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
96

 Basic account: The next level of access is a free, basic account.
By registering with your name and e-mail address, you can
log online geocaches that you find, submit your own hidden
caches to be included in the database, automatically be noti-
fied when new caches are added in your area, use interactive
maps, and participate in online forums devoted to the sport.
This is kind of a no-brainer. You should sign up for a basic
account if you geocache more than once or twice.
 Premium account: Geocaching.com also offers premium
accounts (Groundspeak Premium Membership). These nomi-
nally priced accounts ($3 a month or $30 a year) give you
access to the Pocket Queries feature (you can bulk-download
cache information to use with PDA and PC software and GPS
receivers), enhanced forum features, and member-only caches
(see the icon in the margin). Getting a premium account is a
nice way to support the Geocaching.com site, and all it’s done
for the sport.
If you don’t have an account, I suggest that you get one. (Basic or
premium is your choice.) Some of the Web site features that I talk
about in the book (such as logging finds and adding your own geo-
caches to the database) require an account.
Getting an account is fast and easy. You can sign up for one and
get additional information on the Geocaching.com home page. Just
click the Create an account now link and then fill in some basic
information.
After you have an account, you can log in at the top of the home
page by clicking the log in link. The Web site supports the use of
Web browser cookies, so if you have cookies enabled, you’ll auto-
matically be logged in on subsequent visits to the site.
Chapter 5: Selecting Geocaches to Find 97
Geocaching aliases
Most people who geocache use an alias that’s the same as their Geocaching.com
account username. They use the alias instead of their real name when they sign
cache logs and make Internet posts. The aliases are cool-sounding names like
Navdog, Wiley Cacher, or Moun10Bike. Be imaginative and come up with an alias
that fits who you are. Note: Aliases must be unique. If you try to register a new
account on Geocaching.com and someone else already has registered that user-
name/alias, you’ll need to select another one.

Querying the Geocaching.com
Database
The Geocaching.com Web site provides a simple, easy-to-use inter-
face to a large database containing information on close to 100,000
geocaches. (Just like the number of hamburgers served, this number
increases every day.) The Web site is where you’ll start your search
for a geocache, gathering a variety of information before you step
outside with your GPS receiver and start your hunt.
In this section, I describe how to use the Geocaching.com site to
search for geocache information. You’ll see how to perform basic
and advanced searches, view lists of geocaches that meet your
search criteria, and zero in on a single cache to get detailed infor-
mation you’ll use to find that cache.
Basic search techniques
When you visit the Geocaching.com home page, you can immedi-
ately start searching for caches.
In the upper-right corner of the home page are three basic search
commands (as shown in Figure 5-1). Look at each one of these
search options individually.
Web site designs always change, and the location of the basic
Geocaching.com search commands and their appearance might
change. If Figure 5-1 doesn’t match the current Geocaching.com
Web page, you still should be smart enough to search for caches
(after reading this section). Think of it as good practice for honing
your Sherlock skills.
Searching by ZIP code
The topmost search command on the Geocaching.com site allows
you to search for geocaches by ZIP code. Actually, this is really by
postal code — this option works for caches located in the United
States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.
Enter a valid postal code and then click the Submit button. A list of
geocaches within 100 miles of the approximate center of the postal
code is displayed. (To display the distance in miles or kilometers,
click the Switch link at the bottom of the results page.)
If you enter a postal code that doesn’t exist in the database, you’ll
be taken to the advanced search options page.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
98

Figure 5-1: Begin with the basic search options.
To find a ZIP code for any city or town in the United States, visit
www.usps.com/zip4/citytown_zip.htm.
Searching by state
If you’re looking for geocaches within the U.S., you can search the
Geocaching.com database by state. This option has a drop-down
list box containing all the states. Select the state you’re interested
in, and then click the GO button. A new Web page appears (like
Figure 5-2) that has geocache information for the state you selected.
The following categories are shown:
 Select a local city: A drop-down list box contains all cities
in the state that have populations greater than 20,000 people.
Choose the city (or town), and then click the Get Caches
button to display a list of geocaches within 100 miles of
the city.
Click the Other search options link to further narrow your
search by using keywords, waypoints, and U.S. area codes.
 Events, Past and Present: Upcoming geocaching get-togethers
in the state are listed here; click them to get more information.
Recent past events are colored gray so you don’t get confused
and try to attend them.
Chapter 5: Selecting Geocaches to Find 99

 Latest Caches Hidden: This is a list of new caches in the state
that have been added to the database within the past few
days. The date, cache name (click its name to get detailed
information about it), and the cache hider are displayed.
 Latest Travel Bugs: This is a list of recent Travel Bug sightings
in the state. Click the Travel Bug link to get information about
the bug or click the geocache name to get information about
where the bug is currently residing.
 Local Organizations: These are Web site links for geocaching
clubs, and organizations in that state are shown.
The organization links are not the be-all, do-all lists of geocaching
clubs. Do a Google search for geocaching and your state or local
area to check for other geocaching organization Web sites that
might not be listed.
Searching by country
If you want to look for international caches in the Geocaching.com
database, use the drop-down list box of countries on the site’s
home page. (However, not all countries shown might have geo-
caches present.) Select a country and then click the GO button.
You’re taken to the advanced search page, which I discuss more
in detail in the following section. Click the Seek button to display
a list of geocaches in the selected country.
Figure 5-2: Search for caches by state.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
100

If an asterisk follows a state or country name, one or more new
caches have been added to the database for that state or country
within the past seven days.
Detailed search techniques
Sometimes you might want to perform a more specific, detailed
search, such as displaying only certain types of geocaches or per-
haps caches that are located near a known set of latitude and lon-
gitude coordinates.
At the bottom of the basic search commands is the advanced
search link. When you click this link, you’re taken to the advanced
search page (as shown in Figure 5-3). This page has the basic search
commands as well as some enhanced ones that allow you to narrow
down your search.
Figure 5-3: Run an advanced search here.
The following list explains the various search options:
Searching for type
The first option lets you search for different types of geocaches.
The drop-down list box’s default setting is to search for all types
of caches. Select a cache type from the list, such as virtual cache
or multicache, to display caches of only that type.
Chapter 5: Selecting Geocaches to Find 101

This option is used in conjunction with the other search parame-
ters that I talk about next.
Specifying search parameters
Below the search-by-type drop-down list box is another drop-down
list box that contains different search parameters — for example,
by postal code, country, or coordinates.
When you select one of these parameters from the drop-down list
box, the screen changes, and new entry options appear that are
associated with the search parameter you select. For example, if
you select By Coordinate, text entry boxes are shown, where you
can enter the latitude and longitude.
After you enter the search parameters, click the Seek button to see
whether any geocaches meet your search criteria. If they do, they’ll
be displayed in a list, which I describe in the following section.
The following list explains the parameters that are available:
 Searching by postal code: The By Postal Code parameter
allows to you search for geocaches by postal code in the
United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.
If the postal code can’t be found in the database, an error
message is displayed.
 Searching by latitude and longitude: In the By Coordinate
parameter, you can enter the latitude and longitude to see
whether any geocaches are near the location coordinate.
When you select this parameter, a drop-down list box is
displayed for specifying how you’ll enter the coordinates
(degrees and decimal minutes, degrees and minutes and
seconds, or decimal degrees).
 Searching by state/country: The By State/Country parameter
displays a Country drop-down list box and a State/Province
drop-down list box. Select the country in which you’d like to
search for geocaches. If state or province information associ-
ated with the country is available, it appears in the State/
Province drop-down list box. For example, if you select Canada,
the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and so
on would appear.
 Searching by keyword: The keyword search looks for a word
that appears in the name of the geocache. For example, if
you’re looking for a geocache that has the word fish in its
name, geocaches with fish, fishing, fisherman, whitefish, and
so on would be shown.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
102

 Searching by username: If you know someone’s geocaching
alias (their Geocaching.com account name; see the sidebar
“Geocaching aliases”), you can search for caches they’ve
either found (By Username [Found]) or hidden (By Username
[Hidden]).
 Searching by waypoint name: Each geocache that’s entered
into the database has a unique waypoint name associated
with it. If you enter the coordinates in your GPS receiver for
the cache you’re looking for, you can use this name with the
waypoint. (To read what waypoints are and how to use them,
read Chapter 3.) The waypoint names all start with GC (as in
geocaching). If you know a cache waypoint name, this is
where you can search for it.
You can also access most of the advanced search options by clicking
the Seek a Cache link at the bottom of the Geocaching.com home
page. As an added bonus, you can specify the postal code search
radius — such as show me all the caches within 20 miles of 98002.
Looking at the Search Results
If your basic or advanced geocache search has been successful, a
list of caches that meet your search criteria is displayed. You can
read through the list and select a single cache to get information
on. In this section, I walk you through how to use the list of geo-
caches and also how to get detailed information about a single
cache. You’ll use the detailed information as your pirate treasure
map in tracking down the cache.
Viewing the list of geocaches
If geocaches are present in the Geocaching.com database that
match your search parameters, a list of caches is displayed (see
Figure 5-4). The result list contains the following information,
sorted by how far away the cache is from the search criteria that
you entered.
 Icons: Each listing bears an icon showing the type of cache.
(Read the earlier section, “Defining the Types of Geocaches,”
for the lowdown on identifying these icons.) If a Travel Bug is
present in the cache, a Travel Bug icon is also shown.
If you have a Geocaching.com account (basic or premium)
and are logged in, a check mark will appear to the left of the
icon for any caches that you’ve found and logged online. I
talk more about logging your caches in Chapter 7.
Chapter 5: Selecting Geocaches to Find 103

Figure 5-4: A fruitful search yields lots of caches to search for.
 D/T: D/T stands for Difficulty (how hard to find) and Terrain
(how rugged the terrain is). Each has its own rating, ranging
from 1 (easy) to 5 (hardest).
If you’re just getting started geocaching, I recommend taking
some baby steps first and initially selecting easy-to-find and
easy terrain caches. This will give you a chance to learn the
geocaching ropes and get some successful finds under your
belt before you tackle the more challenging caches. Still,
there’s no reason why you can’t try your hand at some of
the 5/5 caches at first. Just expect a little bit of frustration . . .
and perhaps exhaustion.
 Placed: This is the day, month, and year when the cache was
originally placed.
 Description: The description contains
• The distance and direction the geocache is from the
search parameter you entered
• The cache’s official descriptive name (which you can
click to get detailed information about a cache, which I
talk about in the following section)
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
104

• The cache’s waypoint name (such as GC73E2)
• The alias of whoever placed the cache
• The country and state or province (if applicable) where
the cache is located
If the geocache name has a line through it, the cache is no
longer available. This might be temporary or permanent;
more information can be found on the cache’s detailed infor-
mation page.
 Last Found: This is the last time when someone located the
cache and logged the find online.
If you have an account on Geocaching.com (basic or premium)
and are logged in, a check box is displayed to the right of the Last
Found item. If you mark the check box and click the Download
Waypoints button, information about any geocaches that have
been checked is downloaded to your PC. (Hint: You won’t see this
button if you’re not logged in.) You can upload waypoints to your
GPS receiver or use the downloaded data with geocaching software
that I describe in Chapter 13. There’s more information on down-
loading at the bottom of the geocache list page.
In addition to information about geocaches, the cache list page
also has several navigation commands, including
 Page scrolling: Above the list of caches, Total Records shows
you the number of geocaches that are within 100 miles (by
default). Up to 20 caches are displayed on a page. You can
click the page-scrolling commands that appear above the Last
Found column to jump to other pages.
 Mapping: In the upper-right portion of the page is a MAP IT
button. Clicking the button displays an interactive street map
showing geocaches that appear in the list (as shown in Figure
5-5). You need to have a Geocaching.com account (basic or
premium) and be logged in for many of the map features to
work.
 Detailed geocache information: The official descriptive name
of each geocache has a link to a detailed information page for
the cache. I describe the information that you can get from
the page in the next section.
Chapter 5: Selecting Geocaches to Find 105

Figure 5-5: Get an interactive map of geocaches.
Getting information about 
a geocache
As you look through the list of geocaches, one will catch your eye
sooner or later, and you’ll want to get more information about the
cache. Click the cache’s name to display a page with detailed infor-
mation. An example page is shown in Figure 5-6 and the upcoming
Figure 5-7. (Because there’s so much information that you’ll need
to scroll through the page, I included two figures that show all the
information.)
The detailed geocache information is essential because you’ll be
using it to help you locate a cache after you set out on foot. Take
a look at the types of information that appear on the page.
Geocache name
This is the official name of the geocache — it usually has some-
thing to do with the area where it’s hidden, who hid it, or perhaps
some clever play on words. Bonus: If you hide a cache, you get to
name it. To the left of the name is an icon that shows you what
type of cache it is.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
106

Figure 5-6: Each geocache has an information page.
Who placed the geocache
This is the cache hider’s alias/Geocaching.com username. If you’re
logged in to the site, you can click the profile link to learn more
about the cache hider.
Geocache coordinates
These tell you where the cache is located in latitude and longitude
and UTM coordinates; these coordinates use the WGS 84 datum, so
be sure your GPS receiver is set to this datum. (Read all about
UTM and WGS in Chapter 3.)
You can click the or convert to NAD27 at Jeeep.com link and jump
to the Jeeep.com (www.jeeep.com) site, where the coordinates will
be automatically converted to the NAD 27 datum. (For more about
the importance of datums, check out Chapter 3.)
Download coordinates
Click the download icon to download the geocache’s waypoint
information to your PC. You can then upload the coordinates to
your GPS receiver or use them with geocaching programs. A link
under the icon provides more information about downloading.
Chapter 5: Selecting Geocaches to Find 107

Where and when the geocache was hidden
This shows the country and state or province (if applicable)
where the geocache is hidden. An overview map shows the gen-
eral location of the cache. The date the cache was hidden is also
shown.
Geocache waypoint name
All caches in the Geocaching.com database have a unique way-
point name: They begin with GC, followed by the numeric order
the cache was added to the database. When you manually enter
the coordinates into your GPS receiver, you can use this as the
waypoint point.
Click the Make this page print-friendly (no logs) link to open a new
window with essential information about the geocache that you can
print and take with you on your hunt.
Difficulty
The difficulty rating is how hard the cache placer thinks the cache
will be to find — 1 is easiest, and 5 is the most difficult. Whoever
places the cache decides the difficulty level and bases the rating
on how clever she thinks her hiding job was.
Terrain
The terrain rating is how difficult the terrain is. 1 is flat, easy, and
level; 5 could be very steep and rocky with lots of underbrush and
generally miserable to get to. As with the difficulty rating, it’s up to
the cache hider to rate the terrain.
Unfortunately, the difficulty and terrain ratings can be pretty sub-
jective at times, and I’ve stumbled around some pretty rugged ter-
rain for hours on a couple of caches that were supposedly rated as
easy. This is another reason to read through the logged comments,
described next, to get a better sense of what other geocachers
experienced while searching for the cache.
General description of the geocache
Cache descriptions range from a couple of sentences to lengthy
stories and history lessons about the cache location. Clues often
appear in the description, so be sure to pay attention. Some cache
hiders go beyond words in their descriptions and include digital
photos of the cache area or elaborate artwork that’s related to the
cache.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
108

Hints
The cache placer can optionally add hints to help a geocacher
narrow his search. The hints are typically a brief sentence or a
couple of words that appear in code; I discuss using hints and
how to decode them in detail in Chapter 6.
Find
Under the Find heading (the top of Figure 5-7) are a series of links to
other nearby caches, benchmarks (see Chapter 9 for how to search
for benchmarks), placenames (prominent geographic or cultural
features), and caches that have been hidden and found by the geo-
cacher who placed the cache. Click one of the links to display its
associated information list.
Figure 5-7: More of a geocache’s information page.
Map location of the geocache
At the top of the information page is a small state map that gives
you a general idea of where the cache is located. A larger map with
more detail appears as you scroll down the page. You can click the
large map and go to the MapQuest Web site, where you can zoom
in on the cache site. I show you how to do this in Chapter 6.
Chapter 5: Selecting Geocaches to Find 109

There is also an online map section that contains links to Web sites
that provide topographic maps, aerial photos, and other maps of
the area where the cache is located. Click a link, and a new window
opens up with a map. (Note: Most of these maps are useful only for
geocaches located in the U.S.)
Logged visits
The last part of the page contains log information related to the
geocache. The number of times the cache has been found and
logged online is shown as well as comments from each of the
cache finders. (Only the most recent comments appear on a page,
but you can read all the comments by scrolling to the bottom of
the information page and clicking the View them all on one page
link.)
The comments can range from a single sentence that someone
found the cache to a mini-novel describing the trials and tribula-
tions a geocacher went through during his or her search. Some of
the logged comments are very well written and make entertaining
reading.
Some of the logged visit comments might contain spoilers — hints
that might make it easier to find the cache. Although most cachers
try not to spoil the fun for others, sometimes a clue accidentally
slips in.
Words aren’t the only thing contained in cache logs. Any time you
see an icon that looks like a camera, you can click it to display a
digital photo of the cache that someone posted along with his or
her log comments. There’s also a Visit the Gallery link above cache
logs that will take you to a page with thumbnail images of all the
photos associated with the cache. Just be forewarned: Some of the
digital photos can also act as spoilers.

Chapter 6
Searching for a Geocache
In This Chapter
 Choosing geocaching equipment and gear
 Using online maps to plan driving routes to geocaches
 Searching for geocaches on foot
 Honing your search
A
fter you have your pirate treasure map (the online geocache
description from the Geocaching.com Web site that I describe
in Chapter 5), the next step is to go out and find the booty.
This is where the fun starts, especially because finding the cache
might prove more challenging than you think. Remember, your GPS
receiver will get you only within 10–30 feet of the cache location —
perhaps even farther away if you have poor satellite coverage or
the cache hider’s coordinates are a little off. After your GPS unit
gets you to the general vicinity of the geocache, you need to start
using your eyes and your brain, which at times might be more reli-
able than your GPS receiver.
In this chapter, I cover the basics of searching for a geocache. I dis-
cuss the gear and equipment that you should consider bringing
with you while geocaching, how to use online street maps to get
close to a geocache, and how to start your search on foot. Finally,
I give you some tips and hints that should increase your chances
of finding a hidden geocache.
Deciding What Gear
to Bring Geocaching
Indiana Jones would never set out an adventure without his trusty
fedora and whip, and there are a number of items you should con-
sider bringing with you when you’re out on your own geocaching
adventures.

In Chapter 1, I mention that the two things you absolutely need to
go geocaching are the location coordinates of a cache and a GPS
receiver. That’s the bare-bones minimum, but most geocachers
bring a little more equipment with them on their searches.
You can divide commonly carried geocaching gear into four gen-
eral categories. (Some items overlap in the categories a bit.)
 Cache-related: This is the basic collection of gear that you
need to locate a geocache, log your find, and trade for goodies
that you discover in the cache.
 Food and shelter: No matter how short a planned geocaching
trip is, you should follow the Boy Scout motto and be prepared.
You need to have gear that protects you from the elements and
keeps up your energy and hydration levels.
 Electronic devices: Because geocaching is a high-tech sport,
you’ll sometimes encounter geocachers using electronic
devices such as PDAs, digital cameras, and handheld radios
in addition to GPS receivers.
 Safety equipment: Continuing with the Boy Scout theme,
don’t forget safety-related gear like first aid kits, cellphones,
batteries, and other handy items to have on hand in case of
an emergency.
For each of these categories, see what specific types of gear geo-
cachers bring with them on their hunts. A typical collection of geo-
caching equipment is shown in Figure 6-1.
Cache-related
Cache-related pieces of equipment are things that you need to find
a geocache and also things that you’ll use after you find the cache.
GPS receiver
Because geocaching relies on GPS receivers for finding caches, this
is an essential piece of equipment to own and bring with you. If you
don’t have a GPS receiver, see Chapter 2 for advice on selecting one.
Before you leave home, enter the coordinates in your GPS receiver
(as a waypoint) for the cache you’ll be searching for. Because enter-
ing waypoints differs from model to model, check your user manual
for specific instructions on how to enter and name a waypoint on
your GPS receiver. If you don’t know what a waypoint is, be sure to
read Chapter 3.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
112

Figure 6-1: Common geocaching gear.
You can use the waypoint name on the Geocaching.com cache
information page as the name of the waypoint. (It will start with
the letters GC, for geocaching.) This six-character waypoint name
is compatible with all GPS receivers. Be sure to double-check that
the coordinates you entered are correct. An accidental typo while
manually entering coordinates in a GPS receiver is a common error
that can cause hours of frustration as you unsuccessfully search
for a cache in the wrong location.
You can download a geocache’s coordinates to your PC and then
upload the waypoint directly to your GPS receiver. Doing so helps
eliminate errors caused by typos in manually entering location
coordinates. I talk about downloading coordinates in Chapter 5.
Before heading out on a geocaching trip, I always turn on my GPS
receiver to check how much battery life I’ve got left. There’s noth-
ing more frustrating than getting close to a cache and having your
batteries die — and of course, not bringing spare batteries with
you at the time.
Geocache information
The Geocaching.com Web site has all the information that you
need to find a cache, including the location coordinates, descrip-
tion, maps, and hints. Chapter 5 shows you how to access this
information.
Chapter 6: Searching for a Geocache 113

Print a copy of the cache description Web page so you can bring all
the information you need with you to find the cache.
If you use an inkjet printer, its color ink smears and runs the minute
that a drop of water hits a printed page. Valuable information that
you printed about a geocache can be lost in a matter of moments
during an unexpected rain shower. One-gallon-size, resealable plas-
tic food storage bags enclose an 8.5 x 11" sheet of paper perfectly
and also protect printed cache information and maps from the
elements.
If your printer is out of ink or you’re being frugal, at the very least,
scribble down the geocache coordinates and any other information
you think might be useful in locating the cache. Don’t rely on your
memory, no matter how good it is.
Map and compass
Although a fair number of geocachers use only their GPS receiver to
get them to a cache, a good local map of the area can be extremely
helpful. A GPS receiver can lead you in a straight line directly to a
cache, but it’s probably not going to tell you about the river, deep
canyon, or cliffs between you and your destination. Even GPS
receivers that display topographic maps often won’t show detail
that could help or hinder you on your way to a cache. Additionally,
a map and compass serve as a backup just in case something goes
wrong with your GPS receiver. (Just make sure you know how to
use your map and compass. If you don’t, please spend some time
reading Chapter 4.)
Even if your GPS receiver has a built-in electronic compass, I still
recommend that you bring a small handheld compass with you.
These compasses don’t need batteries, they aren’t as fragile as a
GPS receiver, and they don’t take up much room.
Something to leave in the cache
When you locate a cache, you’ll find all sorts of treasures that
other people have left. Don’t expect diamonds, gold bullion, or
Super Bowl tickets, though. (You’re far more likely to find baseball
cards, costume jewelry, or corporate marketing giveaways.) Just
remember that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure — or,
to quote Captain Jack Sparrow, “Not all treasure is silver and gold,
mate.” The best things to leave in a cache are unique, out-of-the-
ordinary items (perhaps foreign coins, fossils, exotic matchbooks,
or anything that has a high cool factor). And please, avoid leaving
McToys, which is geocaching lingo for plastic junk that you reason-
ably expect to find with a fast-food kid meal. One of the ethics of
geocaching is to try to always trade up — leave something better
than you took.

Pen or pencil and paper
Carry a small pad of paper and a pen or pencil for taking notes
about your route or things you see on the way. Some geocachers
keep an ongoing journal of their adventures; you never know —
you might turn into a geocaching Hemingway.
For a field notebook, I like the Rite in the Rain products (www.
riteintherain.com). Just about every surveyor, forester, or sci-
entist who spends much time outdoors uses them. The specially
treated paper is waterproof and won’t turn into mush when it gets
wet. I carry either a small, stubby pencil (old-school, but very reli-
able) or a more modern pressurized pen like a Space Pen brand
(www.spacepen.com).
Bringing your own pen or pencil is also handy when you encounter a
geocache with a logbook pen that has been left out in the cold too
long and doesn’t work anymore. It’s a bummer when you find some
elusive cache, the pen doesn’t work, and you can’t sign the logbook.
Small pack
Put all your gear in a small daypack while geocaching — stuffing
your pockets full of stuff just doesn’t cut it. Any small-volume pack
(under 800 cubic inches, such as a daypack or school bookpack)
should do the trick. I personally like packs that have a built-in hydra-
tion system (such as those made by CamelBak; www.camelbak.com)
or are a fanny pack design that can carry gear as well as one or two
water bottles.
Food and shelter
Food and shelter items are things that keep you comfy and happy
while you’re out geocaching, no matter what the conditions are
like. Here are some suggestions.
Food and water
If you’re out looking for multiple caches, you can easily spend the
better part of a day searching, so be prepared with enough food
and water. (The warmer the weather, the more water you should
bring.) Some geocachers plan a picnic lunch or dinner around their
outings, especially in scenic areas.
Consider tossing a couple of energy bars, such as PowerBars or
Clif Bars, into your geocaching pack. They’re lightweight and pro-
vide a fair amount of calories if your energy starts to run down.
Most savvy outdoors-folks carry a little bit of emergency food with
Chapter 6: Searching for a Geocache 115

them, just in case. One way to ensure that the emergency food
doesn’t get munched on as a snack is to choose something edible —
but unpalatable enough — that you’d eat it only in an emergency.
For tap water, you can carry it in a hydration pack or bicycle-type
water bottle. Better yet, just stop at the grocery store and pick up
a couple of convenient bottled waters.
No matter how pristine a stream looks, avoid the temptation to
take a drink of the cool, fresh water. Bacteria, viruses, and proto-
zoa that you can’t see are often present, no matter how clean the
water looks. Unless it’s a survival situation, always boil, filter, or
chemically treat water. A bottle of water purification tablets, such
as Portable Aqua, are very lightweight and don’t take up much
room in your pack.
Appropriate clothes and footwear
One of the nice things about geocaching is that you don’t need to
worry about being in style with the latest New York or Paris fash-
ions. Wear clothes that are comfortable and weather-appropriate
and that you don’t mind getting dirty. Even if it’s the middle of
summer, bring along a lightweight jacket in case of an unexpected
rain shower or drop in the temperature.
If you’re geocaching in cold or wet weather, avoid wearing cotton,
such as jeans, a T-shirt, and a sweatshirt. Cotton has very poor
heat-retention properties when it gets wet and contributes to
hypothermia — a lowering of the body’s core temperature — which
can be quite dangerous. There’s an old backcountry saying that
Cotton kills; if you’re lost and wandering around in the cold and
wet, it certainly can.
Also, make sure that you’re wearing sturdy and comfortable
footwear if the cache is outside an urban area. High heels and
wingtip loafers generally aren’t recommended. I personally like
lightweight hiking boots or shoes designed for trail running.
Along with appropriate footwear for rough terrain, a good walking
stick or a set of trekking poles can make life much easier going down
hills and negotiating uneven surfaces. Of the many different brands
of trekking poles on the market, I like those manufactured by LEKI
(www.leki.com). As a bonus, a stick or a pole is useful for poking
around in rock cracks looking for a cache, just in case there’s a
creepy-crawly inside.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
116

Shelter
If you’ve selected the right type of clothes based on the weather
(check the forecast before you head out the door), they should
provide enough shelter from the elements. You should also con-
sider bringing something along that provides a little more shelter
just in case you need to spend a night out. I’m not recommending
that you lug a big tent around with you, though. I’m a big fan of
simple, light, and cheap, such as these two options:
 Yard waste bag: These thick, plastic trash bags are light and
fold up fairly compact. You can punch holes for your head and
arm to make a rain poncho or crawl inside if you’re forced to
hunker down for the night. You can also use a waste bag to
haul out any trash that you find while caching.
 Space blanket: These silver-colored sheets of Mylar and alu-
minum are designed to reflect your body heat back toward
you when you’re wrapped up in one. (They’re called space
blankets because NASA originally created them for space mis-
sions.) The lightweight models fold down to the size of a deck
of playing cards. Larger versions are designed like sleeping
bags so you can crawl inside. Space blankets are available at
sporting goods stores and cost under $5 for the lightweight
versions to around $25 for the heavier (and larger) tarp and
bivvy sack (a bag you put over your sleeping bag to protect
you from the elements) models.
Don’t forget the sunscreen, which I personally consider a form of
shelter for my skin. Dealing with a nasty sunburn takes a lot of the
fun out of a successful day of geocaching, and sunscreen is cheap
insurance against the long-term health affects of ultraviolet radia-
tion. Get SPF 15 and above. Along with sunscreen, don’t forget some
insect repellant if you’ll be caching in areas with mosquitoes and
flies.
Electronic devices
In addition to their GPS receiver, a number of geocachers also tote
other electronic devices with them on their searches for caches.
Digital cameras
Although definitely not a required piece of gear, geocachers often
carry a digital camera to record their adventures or for posting
pictures on the Geocaching.com or a personal Web site. If you’re
hiding a geocache, you might want to use digital photos as part of
your clues.
Chapter 6: Searching for a Geocache 117

PDAs
A fair number of geocachers bring a Palm or Pocket PC PDA with
them that contains information about the geocaches they’re look-
ing for. (I list several PDA programs in Chapter 13 that store and
display geocache information downloaded from the Geocaching.
com Web site.) If you have a PDA, it’s certainly handier than writ-
ing notes on paper. Also, because you’re using data downloaded
directly from the source, it eliminates possible mistakes that some-
times happen when you hand-transcribe information.
PDAs aren’t waterproof and can be fairly fragile. If you’re going to
take one geocaching with you, I suggest that you carry it in some
form of a protective carrier. I like the hard-shell cases made by
OtterBox (www.otterbox.com) and the soft, waterproof padded
pouches made by Voyageur (http://voyageur-gear.com).
FRS Radios
FRS (Family Radio Service) radios have grown extremely popular
over the last several years — in Europe, the radios are known as
PMR (Private Mobile Radio). The small, inexpensive radios have
a range of up to about a mile (longer under the right line-of-sight
conditions) and are great if you’re going geocaching with other
people. A pair of FRS radios ranges from $25 to under $100 depend-
ing on features.
GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service) radios are similar to FRS
radios but use different frequencies, have a greater range, require
an FCC license, and are slightly more expensive. There are hybrid
radios that work with both FRS and GMRS frequencies.
You can use whichever channel you’d like to communicate while
cache hunting, but keep in mind that the geocaching community
has standardized on Channel 2 for the primary FRS and PMR chan-
nel and the alternate Channels 12 for FRS and 8 for PMR.
FRS and GMRS radios aren’t cellphones. You can’t call 911 on these
radios to get help.
For more information on FRS and GMRS radios, check out the FRS
Ultimate Resource Web site at www.ultimatefrs.com.
Spare batteries
I always bring along spare batteries for any device that uses them,
including my GPS receiver and my flashlight. If you’re really safety-
conscious, bring along your cellphone, too. With the exception of
the cellphone, all my electronic devices use the same type of bat-
teries (in my case, AA, although it’s also possible for everything
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
118

to use AAA batteries, depending on the products). That way, I
carry only one type of spare batteries with me. And in a pinch, I
can swap batteries among the FRS radio, flashlight, and GPS
receiver.
Safety equipment
Once a Boy Scout, always a Boy Scout, and that Be Prepared motto
definitely struck a chord with me. That’s where safety-related equip-
ment for geocaching comes in. It’s gear that you should have with
you in case of an emergency. Ideally, you’ll never have to use it, but
if you do, you’ll be glad it’s around.
First aid supplies
Geocaching isn’t a very dangerous sport unless you try to find
caches that are purposely put in risky places. If you’re out tromp-
ing around in the woods, however, there’s always a chance of get-
ting hurt. Carrying a first aid kit allows you to treat yourself or
someone else in your party who gets injured.
Your first aid kit should be able to deal with blisters and small
cuts, scratches, and other common boo-boos as well as more 
life-threatening conditions such as excessive bleeding.
When it comes to first aid kits, you have two options:
 Prepackaged: These kits are stocked with first aid items and
come in a fabric or plastic case. Expect to pay around $10–$30
for a small, lightweight, well-stocked kit. (Advanced kits cost
more.) Adventure Medical Kits sells some of the best, prepack-
aged first aid kits, and you can check out their products at
www.adventuremedicalkits.com. Sporting goods stores
typically carry first aid kits well suited for geocaching.
 Do-it-yourself: Instead of buying a prepackaged kit, you
provide your own container and then stock it with supplies
from the home medicine cabinet or a trip to the drugstore.
Depending on what you’re carrying, the do-it-yourself route
is often cheaper than buying a premade kit. You can base the
contents of your homemade first aid kit on a prepackaged kit
or check out suggestions in any number of outdoors-oriented
medical books. (I personally like Medicine for Mountaineering
& Other Wilderness Activities, edited by James Wilkerson.)
Packing your own kit is essential if you have special medical
needs, such as if you’re allergic to bee/insect stings.
Chapter 6: Searching for a Geocache 119

Having a first aid kit and not knowing how to use it is a little like
carrying around a map and a compass and having no clue how to
use them if you get lost. Although many prepackaged first aid kits
have small how-to booklets, I highly recommend taking a Red Cross
(www.redcross.org) or similar first aid class to get some hands-
on experience.
If you take prescription medicine, I suggest bringing some with you
in case for some reason you get delayed and can’t make it home to
take your scheduled medication.
Flashlight
This is a must-have for looking in cracks and crevices where a
cache might be hidden — and also in case you run out of daylight.
I personally like the newest generation of flashlights that use LED
bulbs. The bulbs take a lot of abuse without breaking, and they’re
power-stingy, which means that your flashlight runs considerably
longer than those using conventional bulbs. For outdoor use, I rec-
ommend a lightweight LED headlamp (yup, on your head) like the
Petzl Tikka (www.petzl.com/petzl/Accueil) or the Princeton
Tec Aurora (www.princetontech.com) (priced between $25–$30).
These lights weigh only a few ounces and provide hands-free oper-
ation. They’re not as bright as conventional bulbs but still work
quite well — if you want the extra brightness, consider a hybrid
LED and conventional bulb model.
Whistle
One safety-related item that’s often overlooked is a good, loud
whistle. Whistles are great signaling devices because the sound
carries over much further distances than the human voice — and
it’s much more efficient and effective than shouting. In addition to
getting someone’s attention when you’re in trouble (the universal
distress signal is three sounds in a row, such as whistle blasts or
gunshots, by the way), whistles are great for group geocaching out-
ings. If you’re spread out all over the countryside looking for a
cache, your group can use whistle blasts to communicate with one
another (such as two whistles meaning, “I’ve found the cache”). I
recommend a Fox40 Classic whistle (www.fox40whistle.com). It’s
by far the loudest small whistle you can buy, is priced under $6,
and is available in most sporting goods stores.
Cellphone
You probably already have a cellphone, so bring it along (prefer-
ably with the battery fully charged). Just a quick note of advice,
though, from my search-and-rescue experiences: I’ve found at
times that people think of their cellphones as a for-certain insur-
ance policy against trouble. Just remember that phones break,
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
120

batteries go dead, and you might have really bad cell coverage out
in the middle of nowhere (like anyplace outside an urban area or
highway corridor). Although a cellphone is great to have along,
be prepared to take care of yourself! (Note: The price of satellite
phones, which don’t have the coverage limitations of cellphones,
is rapidly dropping.)
That’s the basic gear that people use for geocaching. The whole
key with gear lists is to find out what works best for you. You’ll
probably end up carrying too much stuff at first, so after you’ve
geocached for a while, go through your pack and see what you’re
not using so you can lighten up your load. Just don’t toss out the
emergency gear just because you haven’t used it.
Although most geocaches are located in pretty tame, civilized areas
(usually 100 feet or so off a main trail or road), I advise letting some-
one know where you’re going, when you’ll be back, and what to do
if you’re late. Twisted ankles and broken-down cars seem to happen
Chapter 6: Searching for a Geocache 121
The Ten Essentials
If you spend any time in the outdoors, sooner or later, you’ll hear someone talking
about the Ten Essentials, which is a list of gear that was developed by The
Mountaineers (www.mountaineers.org), a large Seattle-based outdoor recre-
ation group. The list includes essential items that should be carried by anyone ven-
turing out into the backcountry. Different versions of the list have been produced
over the years (with various items added and subtracted), but the current version
is pretty comprehensive and makes a lot of sense. You’ll notice some items that I
discuss elsewhere in this chapter. It includes
1. Navigation (map and compass)
2. Sun protection
3. Insulation (extra clothing)
4. Illumination (flashlight/headlamp)
5. First aid supplies
6. Fire
7. Repair kit and tools
8. Nutrition (extra food)
9. Hydration (extra water)
10. Emergency shelter

a lot in areas that don’t have good cellphone service. It’s also not a
bad idea to use the buddy system when you go geocaching so there
are two or more people. That’s not to say you should never go geo-
caching by yourself — only if you do, be prepared.
Getting Close to the Geocache
With most geocaches, you’ll end up using your car or truck (on a
road) to get as close to the cache as you can and then head off on
foot to find the cache. Before you hop in your car, you should plan
the route you’re going to take to get to the vicinity of the cache.
That’s what this section is all about.
Sometimes, a series of caches is located close together — typically
separated by at least a tenth of a mile, per Geocaching.com rules.
Because you’re already in the neighborhood, consider trying to
find several caches instead of just going for one. Check out the
cache information page, as I talk about in Chapter 5, for any nearby
caches and how far away they are.
Sometimes, the cache descriptions give you exact instructions
where to start from, such as a specific parking lot or trailhead
(an established point where a trail starts). The more challenging
caches give you only the coordinates, and it’s up to you to decide
from where you’ll start your search on foot and how best to get
there. One of the pleasures of geocaching is that it’s usually not a
race (although a few timed competitions are starting to crop up
here and there), and you can take as long as you want to reach the
cache site, stopping to smell the roses and enjoy interesting sights.
The best way to figure out a good route for getting close to a 
geocache located in the United States is to use the link to the
MapQuest map Web site on a cache description page. After you 
log in at the Geocaching.com site, you’ll need a basic or premium
account. Here’s how:
1. Select a cache you’re interested in searching for at the
Geocaching.com Web site and display its information
page.
I describe how to do this in detail in Chapter 5.
2. Scroll down the page until you see the general vicinity
map of the geocache.
A pushpin icon identifies the cache’s location (an example
is shown in Figure 6-2).
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
122

Figure 6-2: Use the cache’s map at Geocaching.com to plan your route.
3. Click anywhere on the map.
A new window opens, displaying a map of the geocache
area at the MapQuest (www.mapquest.com) Web site (as
shown in Figure 6-3).
4. Underneath the Get Directions to Above Location From
heading, enter the address of where you’ll be starting
your geocache search (such as your home address).
5. Click the Get Directions button.
A list of driving directions to the cache vicinity is dis-
played, with turn-by-turn street maneuvers, the total dis-
tance, and the estimated time it will take to get there.
The MapQuest database primarily contains improved and
established roads. There might be dirt or unimproved
roads not shown on the map that might get you closer to
the cache. Also, MapQuest won’t tell you the best places to
park, such as a turnoff, wide shoulder, or parking area.
Watch out for traffic!
6. You can also use MapQuest’s map zoom-in and zoom-out
features to help you plan your route.
A zoomed-in version of a map showing more street detail
and the geocache marked with a star are shown in 
Figure 6-4.
Chapter 6: Searching for a Geocache 123

7. Print out the map and/or the driving directions to the
cache area, and you’re ready to start your search.

Starting Your Search
It’s finally time to start searching for that geocache, so gather up
your equipment, including your GPS receiver, map and compass,
food and water, and the other essential items I mention earlier 
in this chapter. Then use the maps and driving directions drive
(bonus points if you walk or bike) to the general vicinity of the 
geocache.
Find a suitable place to park and start your search for the cache.
Here’s what to do:
1. Turn on your GPS receiver and get a satellite lock.
Ideally!
Chapter 6: Searching for a Geocache 125
The trouble with Muggles
In geocaching jargon, a Muggle is someone who doesn’t geocache. This comes
from the Harry Potter stories, in which a Muggle is an ordinary person who isn’t a
wizard or witch.
At some point when you’re out geocaching, you’ll run into Muggles. The trouble
with Muggles is they have no idea what the sport of geocaching is all about. If they
see you find a cache, they might get into the cache after you leave — to see what
you were up to. In the process, the contents of the cache or the entire cache itself
might be taken by an uneducated or malicious Muggle.
Because you probably don’t have an invisibility cloak, if Muggles are around, be
stealthy with your searching. In fact, you might want to stop your search for a cache
until the Muggles leave the area.
There’s a good chance the Muggles will be wondering what you’re doing. If they
ask you, you can tell them about the sport and the Geocaching.com Web site. Some
geocachers have printed up small business cards with the address of the
Geocaching.com site in an effort to educate Muggles.
The other tack in dealing with Muggles is to not let on what you’re up to. One of the
more clever techniques I’ve heard of is holding your GPS receiver up to your ear
and pretending it’s a cellphone as a Muggle approaches. Then carry on a staged
conversation, indignantly telling an imaginary friend he’s over an hour late, asking
where he is, and then reeling off a set of directions on how to get to your current
location so you both can start your hiking trip. The polite Muggle won’t want to inter-
rupt your phone conversation, eavesdropping long enough to think he or she knows
what’s going on, and will then leave. You can use variations of this form of wizardry
if you’re so inclined.

If not, move to a different spot until your GPS receiver
acquires enough satellites to tell you your current position.
Your GPS receiver needs a clear view of the sky with no
obstructions to work best.
2. Save a waypoint for your starting point.
Getting back to your car can sometimes be a challenge
after finding a remote cache, and saving a waypoint that
marks your car’s location can make life much easier (and
get you home in time for dinner). Your GPS manual con-
tains details for setting waypoints for your particular brand
and model.
3. Double-check to make sure that you have the coordi-
nates, cache description, hints, and the rest of your geo-
caching equipment with you.
The pack I talk about earlier in the chapter will come in
handy now. From personal experience, I can tell you it’s
never any fun arriving at a cache and remembering that
you left vital clues described in the cache description print-
out that’s now a couple of miles away in your car.
4. Activate the cache’s waypoint.
Activating a waypoint tells the receiver to locate that spot
and calculate the distance and direction from your current
position to the waypoint’s location. On many GPS
receivers, this is as easy as clicking a Find or GO TO button
and selecting a waypoint from a list displayed on the
receiver’s screen. Your GPS unit will let you know how far
away the cache is and what direction you need to head to
get there. You’re on your way!
5. Follow the direction arrow, road map display, or compass
ring on your GPS receiver toward the cache’s waypoint.
Different GPS receivers use different ways of leading you to
a waypoint.
6. When your receiver says you’re within 30 feet or so of
the cache, move around and find the place that reports
the closest distance to the cache.
Begin your search at that spot. This is where the real fun
starts because you now shift from relying on technology to
using your powers of observation and common sense. A
cache could be inside a cave, tucked in a tree hollow,
hiding behind a rock outcropping, or concealed under a
pile of brush. Some caches are easy to find, and others are
devilishly difficult.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
126

A local map can come in handy as you move toward the cache
because you can use it to figure out what the terrain is like and
whether any rivers, cliffs, or mountains lie between you and the
cache.
Don’t feel compelled to always head in the direction your GPS unit
tells you to go. It might make more sense to walk around a pile of
rocks or downed trees than to go over them. After you get around
an obstacle, you can always check your receiver to get on the right
course again.
Watch your step! As you head toward the cache, don’t get so
caught up in staring at your GPS receiver that you fall off a cliff or
trip over a tree root.
Watch the scenery, too. Sometimes the journey is the reward.
Chapter 6: Searching for a Geocache 127
Geocaching for weight loss and health
You’ve probably heard about 10-step recovery programs, but how about a 10,000-
step program? This one isn’t for addiction recovery but for getting yourself in better
shape.
When it comes to weight loss, the simple rule is that you need to expend more calo-
ries than you take in. Diets just don’t cut it; you need to watch what you eat but also
get enough activity every day to burn all those calories you had for breakfast, lunch,
dinner, and snacks. In addition to taking the pounds off, that additional amount of
activity improves your overall level of fitness in the process.
That’s where the 10,000 steps come in. The goal is to walk 10,000 steps each day. That
doesn’t necessarily mean all at once but totaled throughout the course of the day.
Going grocery shopping, walking to a bus stop, and taking the stairs at work all count
toward your step goal. You keep track of the number of steps you take with a small
electronic device — a pedometer — that you clip on to your belt or waistband. A
pedometer, which costs $10–$30, counts your steps so you can see how close you
are to your 10,000-step goal. (Find a good description of the 10,000-step program
at www.pbs.org/americaswalking/health/health20percentboost.
html.)
What’s all this have to do with geocaching? Geocaching is a great, low-impact way
to tally up those steps you need to meet your weekly goals. The sport gives you a
great excuse to get out and go for a walk; as an added bonus, you get to find (or
hide) all sorts of cool and fun caches while you’re getting in shape.

Geocaching can sometimes look like pretty suspicious. If you’re
approached by a law enforcement officer while searching for a
cache, keep your hands visible, don’t make any sudden move-
ments, be polite, follow all the officer’s commands, tell the officer
what you are doing, and offer to show your him or her your GPS
receiver and cache information. You never know — you might
bring a new convert to the sport.
Search Strategies as 
You Near the Cache
Searching for a geocache is both an art and a science. As you start
looking around for a cache, you can do a few things to help
improve your odds of finding it:
 Determine the accuracy of your GPS receiver. Check the
Estimated Position Error (EPE) to see how accurate your GPS
receiver currently is, based on the satellite coverage. (Refer to
your GPS receiver user manual for information on how to
check EPE.) If the EPE value is high, you should consider
expanding your search area a bit.
EPE is only an estimate of GPS receiver accuracy. It doesn’t
tell you precisely how far away from a cache you might be.
The general rule is that the bigger the EPE number, the less
accuracy there potentially is.
 Follow a magnetic compass. When you’re within 30–100 feet of
the geocache waypoint and your GPS receiver is showing a con-
sistent bearing to the cache (tree cover and poor satellite cov-
erage can cause the distance and direction numbers to jump
around), use a magnetic compass to guide yourself toward the
cache location. As you slow down, unless your GPS receiver
has an electronic compass, the direction that your receiver
reports on how to get to the waypoint becomes less precise —
that means you can easily veer off-course. Handheld magnetic
compasses or electronic compasses built into the GPS unit
don’t rely on satellite signals and won’t have this problem.
 Think about the container. Knowing what kind of container
the cache is stored in can be a big help in identifying and elim-
inating possible hiding spots. Sometimes the cache descrip-
tion lists the container type (ammo can, plastic ware, bucket,
or whatever), which can narrow your search based on the size
and shape of the container. For example, you shouldn’t be
looking for an ammo can in a 3-inch-wide crack in a large rock.
Of course, if you were looking for a microcache, that would be
another story.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
128

Focus more on scanning for the shape of a container versus
the color. Clever cache hiders will camouflage-paint their con-
tainers so they blend in with the surroundings. Just because a
cache description says the container is an ammo can, don’t
expect it to be olive drab. The more geocaching you do, the
more you’ll discover what are natural and unnatural shapes in
nature.
 Think about the terrain. Look at the surrounding environ-
ment to get a general idea of where a cache might be hidden.
What natural (or man-made) features make a good hiding
place? Some common hiding places include
• Stumps
• Downed trees
• Natural depressions covered up with branches
• Thickets
• Caves and cracks
Microcaches can be a big challenge to your observation skills
and persistence. I discuss some of the more creative and
unique hiding places for traditional and tiny caches in
Chapter 8.
Unlike pirate booty hiding, geocaching has a rule against
burying cache containers, so you shouldn’t be burrowing
holes like a gopher.
Be on the lookout for UPR or URP, which are Unnatural Piles
of Rock or Unnatural Rock Piles. Although burying geocaches
in the ground is a no-no, tucking them in piles of stacked
rocks is acceptable.
 Split up the work. If you’re geocaching with other folks, assign
areas for people to check. Although you don’t need to precisely
measure and grid-off squares, divvying up an area to search is
faster and more efficient than randomly wandering around.
 Think like a cache hider. If you were going to hide a cache,
where would you hide it? Sometimes trusting your intuition
can be more effective than trying to apply logic. First check
the ordinary and obvious hiding places and then start looking
in the unordinary spots.
There’s an old safety saying in wildland firefighting that goes like
this: “Look up, look down, look all around.” The same advice applies
to geocaching. I’ve seen caches tucked up in trees and birdhouses,
affixed under picnic tables, and even submerged in shallow water.
Geocaching is an excellent way to improve your overall awareness
and observation skills.

Grid searches
In search and rescue, a grid search consists of lining up a group of people and walk-
ing together in a straight line. The terrain and vegetation dictate how far apart the
searchers are spaced. If you want to get really formal, the two people at each end
of the line both follow a preset compass course to ensure that a straight line is fol-
lowed. After a section of ground is covered, the same technique is applied to an
area that hasn’t been searched. This time- and resource-intensive, detailed way of
searching is typically used for finding evidence in criminal cases (not locating lost
people).
You can apply the basic fundamentals of a grid search to geocaching if you’re out
with a group, especially if you encounter a stubborn cache that you can’t seem to
find.
One of the biggest detriments to finding a cache is that geocachers usually don’t
have a search plan, either when they’re solo caching or while they’re out with
others. There’s often a lot of random searching, checking here and there for a
cache, without any coordination. This often results in a cache DNF (Did Not Find).
I recommend that you come up with a systematic approach to searching, either by
yourself or with others. Walk back and forth in a zigzag pattern to cover an area,
employ some variation of a grid search, and have someone check high and some-
one else check low. Figure out some system that works best for you and increases
your efficiency and effectiveness in finding caches. You’ll need to do some experi-
menting and have some practical experience, but I guarantee that if you start using
a search methodology, you’ll soon acquire a reputation as a geocaching guru.

 When you can’t find a cache
T
he primary goal of geocaching is finding a hidden cache. That’s
simple enough (sometimes) and sounds good on paper, but
what happens when you actually discover a cache? Exactly what
do you do? In this chapter, I answer that question. You’ll read
about signing the cache’s logbook, exchanging goodies, covering
up your tracks so the cache isn’t obvious to find after your visit,
and how to log your find on the Geocaching.com site. I also discuss
what happens when you get skunked and can’t find a cache. Don’t
worry; this happens to the best of geocachers.
What to Do When You 
Find a Geocache
Maybe you immediately stumbled on the geocache that you were
looking for — or perhaps it took you a couple of painstaking hours,
searching high and low to find a particularly devilishly hidden
cache. It really doesn’t matter in the end, though, because you suc-
ceeded and found the cache (such as one shown in Figure 7-1).
Congratulations! Savor the moment. There’s definitely a sense of
accomplishment when you discover a cache, and a little bit of
child-like wonder as you open up the container to see the treas-
ures inside.

Figure 7-1: A found geocache in a plastic container.
Here are some of the things that you should do when you find a
cache.
Opening the cache
When you find a cache, you’re probably going to immediately want
to open it to see what’s inside. But before you do, take a moment
and observe how the cache was placed and hidden. When you
leave, the cache should appear as it did when you found it. I talk
more about this in the upcoming section, “Heading home.”
After you take a mental snapshot of how the cache was placed, you
can open it. If water or dirt is on the lid, brush it off so it doesn’t
get inside the container when you open it.
Surplus military ammunition containers, fondly referred to as
ammo cans or boxes, are popular geocaching containers. The metal
cans are rugged and fairly waterproof. If you’ve never handled an
ammo can before, you might spend a few minutes puzzling over
how to open it. Here’s how:
1. Find the latching mechanism on the narrow side of the
ammo can (see Figure 7-2).
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
132

Figure 7-2: Ammo can latching mechanism.
2. Pull up the bottom of the latch.
The latches are usually tight, so you’ll have to use some
muscle. Be careful, though, because a tight lid can spring
open and really whack your fingers good.
3. After the latch is released, push it up and away from 
the can.
4. Grab the handle on the top and pull up on the hinged lid
to open the ammo can.
It might be a little snug, so again, you’ll need to use some
elbow grease. If it’s really tight, use two hands with one
hand on the lid handle and the other on the wire handle
below the latch mechanism.
To shut an ammo can, do the reverse, first placing the top of the
latch under a metal lip on the side of the can and then pushing
down hard on the bottom of the latch.
Signing the logbook
Inside the cache container, you’ll find a logbook. If the cache hider
was on the ball, the logbook will be in a resealable, plastic food
storage bag just in case the cache container somehow gets water
inside. The logbook is a record of everyone who has found the

cache. It’s typically a small, spiral-bound notebook (such as the
one shown in Figure 7-3) and has a couple of pens and pencils with
it for signing in.
I always like to flip through the logbook pages. It’s fun to read
about other geocachers’ adventures and how long ago the cache
was last visited. The more you geocache in a local area, the more
names you’ll start to recognize of fellow geocachers who have
already visited a cache you just found.
After you’ve read the logbook, go to the last page and write your
own entry. You should jot down the current date (the time is
optional), a few sentences or paragraphs about your experiences
finding the cache, what goodies you took and/or added, and then
sign your geocaching alias. Be sure to mention any pets or fellow
geocachers who accompanied you.

Tough find!!  I Like it.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
134

Some geocachers have rubber stamps made up with their alias
that they stamp a logbook with. Others leave business card-size
geocaching cards or add custom-made stickers with their alias and
a personal logo to logbook pages.
Leaving and trading goodies
One of the guiding principles of geocaching is “take something, leave
something.” A geocache hider places a number of goodies in a con-
tainer when a new cache is first started. As people find the cache,
they exchange goodies that catch their eye with trade items they’ve
brought with them on the search.
A signature item is a unique item that a geocacher leaves in a cache
that’s his or her way of saying, “I was here.” It’s sort of like the Lone
Ranger and his trademark silver bullet. Signature items can be any-
thing from a printed business card to a handmade clay sculpture.
(To give you some ideas, the Michigan Geocaching Organization has
a database of photos of signature items on its Web site at http://
mi-geocaching.org/sigitemdb.)
Chapter 7: Discovering a Geocache 135
IWIDNF
IWIDNF stands for I Wish I Did Not Find. When you’re out geocaching, you might
stumble onto all sorts of things that you really wish you hadn’t. Geocachers have run
across meth labs, marijuana plots, discarded underwear, stolen cars, and amorous
lovers in various states of undress. IWIDNFs have even included dead bodies,
including a skeleton, which solved a decade-old mystery.
In February, 2004, two University of South Carolina students were out geocaching,
looking for one of the many caches hidden in the Aiken-Augusta, South Carolina
area. While trudging through heavy brush, they came upon a human skull and other
bones. They noted the GPS coordinates and immediately hiked out of the area to
contact the authorities.
A subsequent investigation revealed that the remains belonged to a man who dis-
appeared in 1992 and had committed suicide deep in the woods, not wanting his
body to be found.
If you do encounter an IWIDNF that could be part of a crime scene, first ensure your
own safety in case bad guys might still be around. Enter a waypoint for the loca-
tion, don’t touch anything, leave, and then call the local law enforcement agency.
If you think it’s an emergency, dial 911. (Yet another good reason to bring a cell-
phone with you on your outings.)

If you take something from a cache, be sure to leave something. If
you forgot your trade items, just sign the logbook. A number of
geocachers just do this anyway and don’t exchange goodies. To
them, finding the cache is the exciting and rewarding part of the
sport — they’re not really interested in the contents of a cache.
If the treasures inside a cache all seem to be related, such as all
Star Wars trinkets or different kinds of toy frogs, you’ve likely stum-
bled on a theme cache. If you don’t have a trade item that goes with
the theme, just sign the logbook and don’t leave anything.
As you find more geocaches, you’ll get a better idea of what kind of
goodies people leave in caches — it can be just about anything that
will fit in a cache container. There’s always a lot of discussion within
the geocaching community about what is appropriate and not
appropriate to leave in a cache. Here are some quick guidelines:
 Don’t leave food in a cache. Food can attract animals as well
as get smelly and messy, and plastic cache containers have
been chewed through by critters eager to get at a tasty snack.
 Never put anything illegal, dangerous, or possibly offensive
in a cache. Geocaching has turned into a family sport, so be
responsible.
 Always exchange something of at least equal value for what-
ever you take. For example, don’t purloin a cool antique coin
and replace it with a cheap McToy.
 Try to trade up. Trading up means leaving something in the
cache that’s better than what you take. Many times, caches
start out with cool stuff but soon end up filled with junk
(broken toys, beat-up golf balls, cheap party favors, and so
on). Some self-righteous geocachers even take it upon them-
selves to remove anything from a cache that doesn’t meet
their personal quality bar. If you can, always trade up to make
the finds more interesting for everyone.
 Put yourself in the shoes of the next cache visitor. Would
they find whatever item you just left interesting, intriguing,
useful, or fun?
If the cache contains a Travel Bug (a to-be-taken-and-moved item
that has a metal dog tag attached to it with a logo of a bug and a
serial number), feel free to take the Travel Bug but only if you will
remember to turn it loose in another cache that you find. Travel
Bugs are meant for traveling. Go to www.geocaching.com and
click the Track Travel Bugs link for detailed information on logging
your Travel Bug find online and what to do next.

Heading home
After you sign the logbook and trade goodies (if you decided to),
hit the road and head home — or perhaps try to find another
nearby cache. Before leaving the cache, though, here is a checklist
of things to do:
 Make sure that the cache container is sealed. There’s noth-
ing worse than encountering a soggy, waterlogged cache
because the previous finder didn’t seal the lid tightly.
 Put the cache container back where you found it. Make sure
that it’s in the same place and is hidden just as well as it was
before you found it. It’s not polite to relocate a cache to where
you think is a better location.
 Check the area for any of your equipment that’s on the
ground. You really didn’t mean to leave your cellphone, GPS
receiver, or compass as part of the cache — did you?
 Cover your tracks. I’ve been to some caches where I didn’t
even need to use my GPS receiver because there was a well-
worn path right up to the cache hiding spot from so many
geocachers who had previously found it. Do your best to
tread lightly on the land and don’t leave too many signs of
your visit.
 Use the track-back feature of your GPS receiver to follow
your exact path back to your car. Or better yet, activate the
waypoint that you set for your car when you started (but take
a different route back to see some new sights).
Logging your find online
Most geocachers share their experiences with others by reporting
their find online at the Geocaching.com site. When you get back to
your computer (if you’re a member of Geocaching.com), you can
log your find on the Web site so the whole world knows you found
the cache. Note: This is completely optional, and some geocachers
prefer operating in stealth mode, keeping their discoveries and
adventures to themselves.
Here’s how to log your find online:
1. Go to the information page for the geocache you found
and click the Log Your Visit button at the top of the page.
Read Chapter 5 to read how to display and use a cache’s
information page.
Chapter 7: Discovering a Geocache 137

A new page is displayed, where you can log your find (an
example is shown in Figure 7-4).
Figure 7-4: Boast about your find at the Geocaching.com cache logging page.
2. Fill in the requested information and click the Submit
Log Entry button.
It’s as simple as that. Take a look at the types of information that
you’ll need to provide so you know what to expect.
Type of log
This drop-down list box contains different types of log entries,
including
 Found it: You found the cache; good for you. The cache will
be added to the list of caches you’ve found, which is tracked
by the Geocaching.com site. A smiley face icon appears next
to this type of log entry in the comments on a cache informa-
tion page.
 Didn’t find it: You looked for the cache but didn’t find it.
Bummer. That’s okay; go ahead and log it anyway. A frowny
face icon is associated with this type of log entry.
 Write note: You want to add a note to the online cache logs.
(When you view a cache log, notes have a notebook sheet of
paper icon next to them.) If you write a note, it’s not logged as
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
138

a find. Notes are used when you drop off a Travel Bug in a
cache you’ve previously found or for making a comment
about a cache, such as it needs maintenance.
 Needs archived: Select this item if you’ve found a serious prob-
lem with the cache, such as it’s missing or has been destroyed.
An archived cache is currently not active; however, the cache
still remains in the database, and you can view its information
page to learn why it was archived.
There are several other log entry types for specialized types of
caches. For example, a Webcam cache will have a Web Cam Photo
Taken entry instead of Found It. CITO (Cache In, Trash Out) events
will include Will Attend and Attended items in the drop-down 
list box.
Add a waypoint to the log
Sometimes when you find a cache, the coordinates that you get
from your GPS receiver don’t match the coordinates listed on the
cache information page. If two coordinates really seem to differ a
lot, check this box and enter your coordinates, which will then be
listed in the cache’s log comments. (You did first check that you
had the correct datum set on your GPS receiver, didn’t you?)
Date logged
In the appropriate drop-down list boxes, enter the month, day, and
year when you discovered the cache. You can log a cache discov-
ery days or weeks after when you actually found it. However, I’d
recommend logging your find soon after you discover a cache so
you don’t forget about it.
Comments
This text entry box is for entering comments about your search and
(ideally) subsequent discovery of a cache. Let your creative juices
flow if you want. You can be terse or wordy. Just be careful about
entering information that might be a spoiler (way-too-obvious hints
or commentary) and ruin the fun for someone reading the logs who
hasn’t found the cache yet. If you’re just dying to add spoiler infor-
mation, see the following section.
Encrypt this log entry
When this box is checked, the log entry is encrypted, using the
same algorithm used to encrypt hints. If your log comments contain
any information on how to find the cache, please use this option.
Any words that appear between brackets in the comments — for
example, [A fun cache] — won’t be encrypted, so you can mix
readable and encrypted text together.
Chapter 7: Discovering a Geocache 139

After you post a cache log, a preview page is displayed where you
can edit or delete your log entry. In the upper-right corner is the
upload image link. Click this link to upload graphics images, such
as digital photos, that you have stored on your PC. The maximum
size of an image is around 90K.
When You Can’t Find a Geocache
So despite all your best efforts, you couldn’t find the cache. Maybe
you wandered around in circles for a couple of hours, or perhaps
the weather got downright miserable, and you called it a day. It’s
okay; it happens to everyone, and it definitely isn’t the end of the
world.
If you’re still in the hunt but are starting to get frustrated, take a
deep breath and try the following:
 Double-check the coordinates. You did enter them correctly,
didn’t you? And the datums match with the coordinates and
your GPS receiver, don’t they?
 Check the satellite coverage. What kind of satellite reception
are you getting in your search area? If the coverage is poor,
maybe the cache hider didn’t get an accurate set of coordi-
nates when he saved the cache’s location. This means that
you won’t be able to rely on your GPS receiver as much as
normal to get you near the cache.
 Review the logs. If you brought printed copies of the logged
visits with you, you can read comments from people who
have previously found the cache. Although most geocachers
try to avoid including spoilers in their comments, sometimes
enough information leaks through that can help you narrow
your search.
 Use a hint. Most cache information pages have a short hint,
but you have to work for it because it’s encrypted. The reason
for the spy stuff is so the hint doesn’t spoil the fun for another
geocacher who doesn’t want to use the hint as part of his
search. Fortunately, the hint uses a simple substitution code
(for example, A = N, B = O, C = P, and so on), so you don’t need
to work for the NSA to be able to break it. The decoding key is
on the right side of the page, and it’s pretty easy to figure it
out by hand.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
140

How you go about finding the cache is up to you. Some purists will
use only the coordinates and basic description of the cache, never
using the hints or the comments. Other cachers immediately
decrypt the hint and read all the comments before they head out
the door on a search. It’s your decision.
Logging a DNF
In geocaching jargon, a DNF means Did Not Find. Don’t worry; it’s
not a big deal, and you shouldn’t be shy about logging a DNF online
for a cache you couldn’t locate. If a cache owner hasn’t visited the
site in a while, a number of logged DNFs could indicate that the
cache has been moved or stolen. Unfortunately, cache vandalism
and thievery happen: Perhaps the cache you were looking for
might have been removed, and the Geocaching.com database
hasn’t been updated yet.
Try, try again
There’s no shame in a DNF; it happens to everyone — and if some-
one brags about finding every cache he’s searched for on the first
try, don’t trust him. Talk to those who have been geocaching for
awhile, and they’ll tell you DNF stories about taking two, three, or
more visits to an area to find an elusive geocache — especially
frustrating are the ones that everyone else seems to be able to
easily find except you.
If you have a DNF, go back to the cache location another day and
try again. Geocaching is supposed to be fun, so don’t take it too
seriously if you can’t locate a cache. Consider bringing someone
Chapter 7: Discovering a Geocache 141
Geocaching stats
Just like any sport, geocaching has statistics. In this case, stats refer to the number
of caches that you’ve found and hidden. When you sign up for a free or premium
account at Geocaching.com (see Chapter 5), you can log the caches you’ve found
as well as add caches that you’ve hidden. The site’s extensive database tracks your
finds and hides and displays them on a user profile page. Other members can check
out your stats, and the number of caches that you’ve found appears next to your
alias when you log your comments about a cache you’ve visited. Some geocachers
are competitive and are in to racking up as many cache finds as possible. Others are
more blasé about the whole numbers thing and couldn’t care less. Like so many
other aspects of geocaching, it’s up to you how you want to play the game.

else along with you next time: Two heads are always better than
one, and a different set of eyes might find something you over-
looked. Quite often, when you find the cache, you’ll be slapping the
side of your head, trying to figure out how you missed it the first
time around. Treat every find and DNF as a learning experience
that makes you a better geocacher.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
142
Geocaching etiquette
For the most part, there aren’t a whole lot of rules when it comes to geocaching. It
mostly boils down to respecting other geocachers and the land that you play on.
Here are a few etiquette points to consider when you’re out geocaching:
 Always respect private property. Need I say more?
 Always trade up or replace an item in the cache with something of equal value.
Don’t be a Scrooge; what’s the fun in that?
 Be environmentally conscious when searching for and hiding caches. Tread
lightly on the land. Check out the Leave No Trace site at www.lnt.org for
more information.
 Geocaching is a pretty dog-friendly sport. Keep it that way by having Fido teth-
ered in leash-only areas. No matter how good your dog is, have a leash ready
in case other people or animals are around. And for geocaching in urban areas,
don’t forget a plastic bag.
 Cache In, Trash Out (CITO). If you see any litter on your way to or from a cache,
get some additional exercise with a deep-knee bend, pick it up, and pack it out.
 Say thank you, please. After you visit a cache, send a quick e-mail, thank-you
message to the geocacher that placed the cache or acknowledge him or her in
your cache comments when you log your find.

I
f you’ve been geocaching for a while, one day, you’ll probably
get the urge to hide a cache of your own. To many geocachers,
hiding caches is just as fun as — if not more enjoyable than — find-
ing caches. It’s like making a movie or staging a play. You have an
idea, spend some time planning, turn the idea into reality, and then
sit back and see what people have to say about your work.
In this chapter, I show you how to create and hide a cache of your
own. It’s not that difficult and is relatively inexpensive — you can
spend $10 or less to set up their cache, which is some pretty cheap
entertainment these days. Hiding a cache is also a great way to give
something back to the sport. All those individual caches that have
been placed do their part in keeping the sport alive and growing.
Adding your own geocache to the growing list of caches through-
out the world involves selecting the type of cache and an appropri-
ate container, stocking the cache, finding a good hiding place,
submitting the cache to include in the Geocaching.com database,
and then maintaining the cache.
Don’t rush out and hide a geocache until you’ve spent some time
finding caches. Searching for other caches will give you a good idea
of how other people place caches and give you some ideas for cre-
ating and hiding your own. In addition to this chapter, check out the

Geocaching.com site for some FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
lists as well as a complete set of guidelines for placing and hiding
caches.
Deciding What Type of 
Geocache to Create
The first step in setting up your own geocache is to decide what
type of cache you want to hide. Cache types include traditional
caches, microcaches, multicaches, and others. (Read Chapter 5 
for a refresher on the different types of geocaches.)
Just like when you first start searching for geocaches, for hiding
caches, I suggest you begin with a single, relatively straightfor-
ward, traditional cache. I’m sure that you have some great ideas
for creative and challenging caches, but save them for a little later.
To some people, hiding geocaches can be a like a kid getting a
bunny rabbit for Easter. It’s fun at first, but the reality of caring 
and feeding causes the novelty to wear off pretty quick. Beginning
with a basic cache gives you a good idea of what’s involved in
cache management — and I don’t mean the high finance, invest-
ment type. Starting out simple with a single cache lets you test the
waters. If you like everything that’s involved in hiding caches, you
can hide more, making them more complicated as time goes on.
If you don’t want to maintain a cache, be sure to archive it. (I talk
more about archiving — letting other geocachers know that your
cache is no longer active — later in the section, “Physical mainte-
nance”). It’s not fair to other geocachers to neglect your caches (or
your Easter bunny).
Selecting a Container
Obviously, you need something to put your geocache in. The only
real requirement for a cache container is that it needs to be water-
proof although sometimes cachers use plastic bags inside a nonwa-
terproof container, which is a little less than optimal. The size of
the container determines where you’ll be able to hide the cache
and how full you’ll be able to fill it with trading trinkets. Any con-
tainer that you can think of has probably been used for geo-
caching, including
 Plastic buckets with lids
 Breath mint tins
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
144

 Plastic margarine tubs
 35mm film canisters
 Pill bottles
 Plastic Army decontamination kit boxes
 PVC piping (with end caps)
The best cache containers seal tightly and have snug-fitting lids.
You’ve probably got a suitable geocaching container lying around
the house or garage. Just for the record, the two most popular
types of cache containers are ammo cans and household plastic
storage containers.
Ammo cans
Military surplus, steel ammunition (ammo) cans work great
because they’re sturdy and waterproof. They typically come in two
sizes, based on the machine gun ammunition they once held. (The
two types are shown in Figure 8-1.)
 .50 caliber: A large ammo can that’s suitable for housing
bigger trinkets.
 .30 caliber: A narrower ammo can. It doesn’t hold as many
goodies but is good for geocaches in confined spaces.
Depending on the terrain and vegetation, the olive-drab color
makes ammo cans difficult to spot. You can typically get ammo
cans for around $5 or less from local or online Army surplus
stores.
Household plastic storage containers
Plastic storage containers are also popular choices but aren’t quite
as rugged as ammo cans. And they have the downside that some-
times a geocacher won’t reseal the lid very well. Plastic containers
are cheaper and more available than ammo cans, though, and you
can easily match a size to go with any cache.
Some cache hiders spray paint their cache containers to make them
blend better with the surroundings. Figure 8-2 shows an ammo can
that was painted the same color as the local rock formation and
even had stones glued to the outside to aid in the camouflage.
Here’s a great how-to link for painting your ammo can: http://

Selecting a Location
Just like in real estate or retail sales, location is everything when 
it comes to placing a geocache. After you select a container, figure
out where to put it — or sometimes you find a perfect hiding place
and then select an appropriate container to go with it. The location
of your cache usually defines its success and popularity. Take a
look at some hiding place considerations.
Where to hide your cache
Start out by doing some initial research to find a good, general area
to hide your cache. For many geocachers, visiting a new place with
some unique feature, incredible scenery, or just a plain gorgeous
view is every bit as important as finding the cache. Keep this in
mind as you use maps, travel guides, or fond memories from your
own explorations to help you select a good cache location.
An important part of your homework is learning where caches are
and are not permitted. The majority of the geocaching community
tends to be very aware that the continued growth and success 
of the sport depend on good relationships with landowners and
managers.
If you want to place a cache on private property, always first 
ask the owner’s permission. Because geocaching is so new, many
people don’t know what it is, so take the time to explain how the
sport works.
Most geocaches are placed on federal, state, county, or municipal
public land. However, just because it’s public doesn’t necessarily
mean that placing a geocache is permitted.
Always try to verify that the agency that manages the land allows
geocaching. You can contact the agency directly, try a Google search
to see whether its geocaching policies are published on the Web, or
talk with other geocachers in your area to get their experiences in
dealing with different agencies. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) recognizes geocaching as a recreational activity
and tends to be friendly toward cache hiders who want to locate a
cache in places other than wilderness or wilderness study areas.
The U.S. National Park Service, on the other hand, prohibits placing
geocaches on the land that it manages; if you’re caught hiding a
cache on such land, it’s a federal offense. Yipes!
Chapter 8: Hiding Geocaches 147

Many of the problems that geocachers have had with public land
managers stem from a lack of education on the government
employee’s part about geocaching. It’s worthwhile to educate land
managers about the sport so they clearly understand the impacts
and can make informed and wise decisions on whether to allow
geocaching. Although some people in the geocaching community
ardently believe they should have a Constitutional right to hide
and find caches, a little more middle-of-the-road approach is useful
when dealing with land managers.
Where not to hide your cache
There are definitely some places you don’t want to hide your
cache. To be listed in the Geocaching.com database, your cache
needs to meet certain, common-sense criteria. Generally a cache
can’t be
 Buried: Covering it with branches, leaves, or rocks is okay,
but no digging, please.

Post-9/11 geocaching
In November, 2001, outside the small town of Dorris, California, a police bomb squad
exploded a suspicious object near a railroad tunnel. The United States was on alert
for possible terrorist attacks against its transportation infrastructure. The suspi-
cious object wasn’t a bomb but turned out to be a geocache. The FBI got involved
with the investigation, and a geocacher who went by the handle of Hillwilly was
charged with terrorism, criminal trespass, and criminal vandalism for placing the
cache on railroad property — which (by the way) extends within 150 feet of the
rails. The terrorism charges were later dropped, but the judge upheld the other
charges, and Hillwilly ended up with a one-year suspended jail sentence and paying
over $2,000 in fines. Ouch!
There have been other incidents where geocaches stored in obviously military-look-
ing ammo cans have been thought to contain explosives or drugs and were seized
by law enforcement officers. A few geocachers have proposed cutting holes in the
sides of ammo cans and gluing pieces of Lexan (a thick, clear polycarbonate mate-
rial) to the inside of the ammo can to make a window so the suspicious or cautious
can see the contents. Some agencies are starting to require see-through contain-
ers for any geocaches placed on lands that they manage.
Always be sure to clearly label your container as a geocache. And never, ever place
a cache in a location that could get you into trouble. Remember, when it comes to
certain things, the authorities tend not to have a very good sense of humor.

 Placed in environmentally sensitive areas: This includes
areas with endangered plants and animals as well as archaeo-
logical and historic sites. Some things that can clue you in to
an area possibly being environmentally sensitive include
• Waterholes.
• Wetlands.
• Guano- (bat or bird excrement) stained rock outcrops.
• Areas where soil and vegetation will be significantly
impacted by trampling.
• Any place where human activity will distress wildlife. (If
a large bird is screaming at you, that’s a big hint.)
Land management agencies might not publicly identify sensi-
tive environmental areas on the Internet or on paper maps
because it’s an open invitation to poachers and vandals (who
tend to ruin things for the rest of us). However, usually by
applying common sense and observing your surroundings,
you can tell whether an area is sensitive, regardless of
whether it’s marked as such or not.
 Placed in national parks or designated wilderness areas:
This is a no-no. Sorry; them’s the rules.
 Placed within 150 feet of railroad tracks: Umm, this is for
safety reasons as well as some legal ones discussed in the
“Post-9/11 geocaching” sidebar.
 Placed anywhere that might cause concerns about possible
terrorist activities: Use your post-9/11 brain. No-no areas
include near airports, tunnels, bridges, military facilities,
municipal water supplies, and government buildings.
 Placed within one-tenth of a mile of another cache: This is a
rule for adding a cache to the Geocaching.com database as
well as simple geocaching etiquette.
The geocaching community tends to police itself fairly well. If you
try to bend the rules and put a cache where it shouldn’t be, some-
one will probably let the Geocaching.com administrators know
about it, and the cache will be removed from the database.
Hiding for seekers
After you select a good general location to put the geocache (forest,
park, beach, and so forth), look around to find the perfect place to
hide the cache. The simple rule for a hiding place is that the cache
shouldn’t be easily visible to a passerby who’s not looking for the
Chapter 8: Hiding Geocaches 149

cache. Use your creativity to find a challenging hiding place: in 
a tree hollow, underneath bushes, wedged in rocks, and so on.
Remember: The more experience you have finding caches, the
more ideas you’ll have for good hiding places of your own.
When you hide the cache, always watch out for Muggles (non-
geocachers) in the area. Be stealthy so your cache isn’t discov-
ered before you get a chance to submit it to the Geocaching.com
database.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
150
Getting sneaky
Some geocachers take delight in making their caches as difficult to find as possi-
ble. In fact, some of their camouflage jobs would make the military jealous. Here
are some of the more creative and challenging places geocaches have been found:
 Birdhouses
 Fake bricks
 Fake water faucets
 Hollowed-out logs
 Hollowed-out pine cones (as shown here — see the film canister?)
A plastic
film container
 On the back of leaves (microcaches, obviously)
 Plastic rocks designed for hiding house keys
 Soda pop cans
 Rubber cow pies and other practical-joke animal dung
 Rubber rats
If you get really sneaky and create a difficult and challenging-to-find cache, just be
sure to give people a clue about what they’ll be up against in the cache description.

Recording the location
After you locate that perfect, secret hiding spot, you need to deter-
mine the cache’s location coordinates as precisely as possible.
(Remember to use the WGS 84 datum; see Chapter 3 for more on
this.) This can be challenging because of less-than-perfect satellite
coverage. You might find the location’s coordinates changing on
your GPS receiver every few seconds. Many GPS units have an
averaging feature that compares coordinates at a single spot over a
period of time and then averages the result. If your receiver does
do averaging, get it as close to the cache as possible, let it sit for
five or ten minutes, and then copy down the cache coordinates
and enter them as a waypoint.
A manual approach to averaging is to set a waypoint for the cache
location, walk away, and then come back and set another way-
point. Repeat this until you have 6–12 waypoints; then examine the
list of waypoints, and pick the one that looks the most accurate
(generally, the value in the middle of the list).
During certain times of the day, you might have better satellite cov-
erage than others. This is because of the number of satellites that
are in view and the position of a single satellite relative to your 
GPS receiver and the other satellites in the constellation. If you
want to get really precise with recording your cache coordinates,
select a time of the day with optimal satellite coverage. Trimble
Navigation, one of the largest manufacturers of commercial and
professional GPS receivers, has a free Windows program called
Planning, designed for surveyors who need to know when the best
time is to use GPS surveying instruments. To download Planning,
go to www.trimble.com/planningsoftware_ts.asp?
Nav=Collection-8425.
Stocking a Geocache
Finding an empty geocaching container is a big letdown to a cache
hunter, so you’ll need to stock the cache with a few items.
Logbook and writing utensil
At the very minimum, your cache should contain a logbook and a
pen or pencil so other cachers can write about their discovery.
Hint: Pencils work better in cold climates (the ink in most pens
can freeze); mechanical pencils are the best because they don’t
need sharpening. The logbook is usually a spiral notebook with the
name of the cache written on the cover. Some cache hiders paste
Chapter 8: Hiding Geocaches 151

their personal logo or some other graphic to the notebook cover.
As the cache founder, you should write some profound thoughts
about the cache on the first page.
Identifying information
The cache should have some information that identifies it as a geo-
cache, describes what geocaching is, and provides instructions to
the finder. (It’s not uncommon for Muggles to stumble upon a
cache.) The Geocaching.com site has an information sheet in a
number of different languages that you can print out and place in
your cache; laminating this sheet is a good idea. Be sure to record
the cache’s name and its coordinates.
You can also purchase vinyl stickers in different sizes that identify
a geocache. (An example is shown in Figure 8-3.) These stickers are
available from a number of different sources and are priced under
$2. Do a Google search for “geocaching sticker” to find an online
retailer.
Figure 8-3: Geocache identification sticker.
Goodies
You’ll also want to stock your geocache with some goodies for
people to exchange. These should be unique and interesting items.
Because geocaching is a family sport, initially put a mix of things in
it that appeal to both adults and children. You don’t need to fill up
the container like a stocking at Christmas. Many caches start out
with 6–12 small items. If you want, you can add a Travel Bug. (Click
the Track Travel Bugs item on the Geocaching.com home page to
get detailed information about Travel Bugs.)
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
152

A geocoin is a specially minted coin with a serial number that’s
designed to move from cache to cache and be tracked like a Travel
Bug. People get pretty excited about encountering geocoins because
they’re so unique. Do a Google search for geocoin to see examples of
different coins and get information on how to order them from differ-
ent sources. Depending on the quantity, they cost $4–$7.
Food; offensive, illegal, and dangerous items; and anything of a
commercial, political, or religious nature are no-no’s to place in a
cache.
Even though your cache container might be waterproof, always put
your logbook and cache goodies in resealable, plastic storage bags.
This prevents your cache from turning into a soggy mush when
someone inevitably forgets to seal the container’s lid.
Some cache hiders put a disposable camera in their cache and ask
finders to snap pictures of themselves. The cache owner returns to
the cache when all the exposures are shot, develops the photos,
and then places them online for everyone to see.
Submitting a Geocache
After you successfully hide the stocked geocache, it’s time for a
little advertising. It doesn’t do much good if people don’t know
about your cache after you place it. The Geocaching.com Web site
currently maintains the largest database of geocaches in the world
and is where most people go to find information about caches. You
need to have a free or premium account at the site to be able to
post your cache, so if you don’t have an account yet, go to the site
and sign up. (I promise that it’s quick and painless. Read about
how to sign up for these accounts in Chapter 5.)
After you log onto the site, submitting a cache is just a matter of
filling out an online form about your new cache. The form is rather
long, and you need to scroll down a couple of times to enter all the
information. Take a look at the types of information that you’ll
need to enter to get your cache listed in the database. (I’ll walk you
through all the entry fields in Figures 8-4, 8-5, and 8-6.)
Cache type
This is the type of cache that you’ve hidden. Drop-down list
options include
 Traditional cache
 Multicache
Chapter 8: Hiding Geocaches 153

 Mystery/puzzle cache
 Webcam
 Letterbox (Hybrid)
 Virtual
 Geocaching event (Event cache)
 Cache In, Trash Out event
These cache types are described at the beginning of Chapter 5.
Cache size
How big is the cache? Obviously, this is based on the cache con-
tainer size. The drop-down list options include
 Micro: A small container cache, such as a 35mm film canister
 Regular: An ammo can or conventionally sized cache
 Large: A big container cache, such as a five-gallon or larger
bucket
 Virtual: A cache without a container
 Other: Some off-the-wall cache that doesn’t meet any of the
above options that is explained in the description you later
provide
Figure 8-4: Begin your geocache listing here.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
154

Nickname
This is the official name of the cache. Think up something cool. It
often relates to some feature near the cache location or something
that caught your attention or imagination when you were placing
the cache.
Who placed the cache?
This is you. The Geocaching.com user account you are logged in
under appears by default.
Active cache
Because it’s a new cache, it’s active, so make sure this check box is
marked.
Date placed
Use the drop-down list boxes to enter the date you placed the
cache.
Related Web page
If you have a separate Web page you created that’s related to the
cache, this is the place to enter its address.
Coordinates
Use the drop-down list and text entry boxes to enter the coordi-
nates you recorded for the cache. You can select decimal degrees;
degrees and decimal minutes; or degrees, minutes, and seconds. (If
you don’t know the difference between these coordinate formats,
be sure to read Chapter 3.)
Location
Use these drop-down list boxes (top of Figure 8-5) to enter the
country and state or province (if applicable).
Difficulty rating
This is how difficult you think it will be for someone to find the
cache. 1 is the easiest; 5 is the hardest. Compare your cache with
the ratings of similar caches you’ve found to see whether your
rating is in the ballpark.
Terrain rating
The terrain rating ranks how difficult the travel will be to get to
your cache. 1 is the easiest; 5 is the hardest. Again, compare your
cache with the ratings of caches you’ve found with similar terrain
to see whether your rating is close.
Chapter 8: Hiding Geocaches 155

rain ratings, click the this system link to take you to geocacher
ClayJar’s online terrain and difficulty calculator (www.clayjar.
com/gcrs).
HTML
You can use HTML (Web page formatting codes) to pretty up the
appearance of a cache description. Select this check box if you
plan on inserting HTML code in your descriptions.
Here’s a link to a great tutorial on using HTML: www.xsnrg.com/
geocachingwa/tutorial.asp. And here you can find an abbrevi-
ated cheat sheet for HTML formatting codes: http://nozen.com/

Short description
This is a couple of sentences or a short paragraph that has general
information about the cache as well as the terrain and difficulty
levels.
Long description
This is detailed information about the cache, such as the items
that were originally placed inside, what kind of container is being
used, details on accessing the cache, and instructions for multi-
caches and puzzle caches.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
156

Hints/spoiler info
You can optionally provide hints for cache finders. Anything you
enter in this text box (top of Figure 8-6) will be encrypted (unless it
is enclosed in brackets), and a searcher needs to decrypt the text
if he or she wants to read it. It’s good form to leave a short hint.
How much of a hint is up to you.
Note to reviewer
This is any other information about the cache that you think might
be pertinent to the volunteers who review the cache to approve it
for including in the database. This could be a statement about
having gotten permission from a landowner, a description of a vir-
tual cache item, or the final coordinates for a multicache.
Legal stuff
Select the check boxes if you’ve read the guidelines for listing a
cache and if you agree to the terms of service. (There are links to
both of these items.) Both check boxes must be marked to submit
a cache.
Most of the information that you enter when you submit a cache is
displayed in the cache information page. Review some other caches
in the Geocaching.com database to get a better idea of the types of
information that other cachers are including with their caches.
Figure 8-6: The last geocache submission entry fields.
Chapter 8: Hiding Geocaches 157

After you enter all the cache information, submit the form.
Regional and local volunteers (fondly referred to as approvers) will
check things like whether all the information needed is present,
the coordinates are generally correct, and the cache meets the gen-
eral submission guidelines. The approval process can take up to a
couple of days but is usually shorter. If you’re approved, your
cache is added to the database. If you’re not approved, you’ll be
informed why, and you can either address the problem and resub-
mit or discuss the issue over e-mail with the approver.
Keep in mind that volunteers don’t physically visit the cache —
that would require thousands of people all over the world with a
considerable amount of free time on their hands.
Maintaining a Geocache
After you hide your cache and it appears in the database, your
work isn’t finished yet. You need to keep track of what’s happening
with your cache, both in the physical and virtual worlds.
Physical maintenance
Although you might think otherwise, caches aren’t entirely self-
sufficient, and they need some care and nurturing. You shouldn’t
place a cache and then ignore it. In fact, plan on visiting your cache
 Every so often just to check on its condition.
 As soon as possible after receiving an online log comment or
e-mail message that says the cache is missing or in a state of
disrepair.
When you visit your cache, some of the common maintenance
tasks include
 Replacing the logbook: You need a new logbook when the old
one starts to fill up. Don’t forget to bring some spare pencils
and plastic bags in case they’re missing or aren’t in the best of
shape.
 Restocking the cache: Place some new goodies in the cache if
people are taking more than they’re leaving.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
158

 Adding a Travel Bug: Popping a Travel Bug you found in
another cache into your cache drives visits from bug lovers.
 Swapping the cache container for a new one: Sometimes the
original container becomes damaged, stolen, or just isn’t
working out (for example, it’s too small, and the trade items
are overflowing).
Duct tape holds the world together, and it’s worth bringing a roll
with you when you’re visiting your cache to make temporary field
repairs on cracked plastic containers, punctured plastic bags, or
peeling geocache identification labels.
During your visits, check that the area around the cache isn’t being
extremely impacted by people searching for the cache. If the site 
is being disturbed (such as several well-established foot trails that
weren’t there when you first placed the cache), consider relocating
the cache. If you decide to temporarily or permanently remove a
cache, be sure to post an online log entry to let other geocachers
know when they look up information about the cache.
Archiving means making a cache inactive in the Geocaching.com
database. Any time you relocate a cache, you should archive the
original cache and then submit a new one. If you permanently
remove a cache, you should always archive it. (Abandoned caches
are often called geolitter.) You can archive and edit caches that
you’ve hidden by logging onto the Geocaching.com site and clicking
the MY CACHE PAGE button on the home page. This displays lists
of caches you’ve found and hidden as well as account profile infor-
mation. You can also contact the volunteer who originally approved
your cache (his or her e-mail contact is listed at the bottom of the
cache information page) and request to temporarily archive a
cache. Just remember to reactivate it!
Online maintenance
In addition to physically checking the cache, you should also check
your cache online and read the comments posted from people who
have visited the cache. These comments can alert you when it’s time
to make a maintenance visit to the cache. Patience, Grasshopper!
Sometimes, it can take a while for someone to first find your cache
and post about it.
If you click the Watch This Cache button at the top of a geocache
information page, you’ll be notified when someone logs comments
about that cache. As a cache placer, this is a great way to keep a
virtual eye on your hidden caches. You can watch up to 100 caches
(unlimited if you have a premium subscription).
Chapter 8: Hiding Geocaches 159

As the owner of a cache, after you log on with your Geocaching.com
account, you can delete any log entries for caches that you own. It’s
up to you to police log comments associated with your caches, and
you should delete any comments that you think are inappropriate.
Part II: Let’s Go Geocaching 
160
If The Man calls
In the early days of geocaching, most government agencies didn’t know that the
sport even existed. That’s changed, and many land managers now know about the
Geocaching.com Web site and check it on a regular basis to see whether there are
any geocaches on land they’re responsible for.
If you hide a cache where it’s not supposed to be (either unintentionally or on pur-
pose), some land managers might contact you through e-mail, using your
Geocaching.com alias, requesting that you relocate the cache. An example of this
recently happened in central Oregon, where several geocaches were inadvertently
placed near the nesting grounds of a threatened bird species. A government
employee, who also happened to be a geocacher, discovered the nests and then
contacted the cache owners, asking them to archive their caches until after nest-
ing season and then relocate them. (Immediately removing the caches would have
disturbed the already nesting birds.)
If an agency representative does contact you, be respectful, find out the issues that
he or she has with your cache location, and ask for suggestions for a more accept-
able spot. (From a communication standpoint, phone or in-person conversations
are always better than e-mail.) Remember that the future of the sport depends on
geocachers, property owners, and land managers all working together.

Geocaching

In this part . . .
A
fter you become savvy with geocaching, you might
want to take a couple of steps beyond the basics.
That’s what the chapters in this part are all about. In
Chapter 9, I introduce you to the sport of benchmark
hunting. It’s like geocaching in a way, but you search for
permanent survey markers (typically small brass or alu-
minum disks driven into the ground or in rock forma-
tions). Locating benchmarks can sometimes be even
more challenging than ﬁnding a geocache.
For Chapter 10, I take you into the world of organized geo-
caching. For such a young sport, quite a number of geo-
caching clubs have popped up in a short amount of time. I
show you how to ﬁnd geocaching clubs and organizations
in your area, and I also talk about some of the beneﬁts of
joining them. In addition to clubs, I discuss organized geo-
caching competitions that are starting to sprout up here
and there, that pit geocachers against each other and the
clock. I close out this part with Chapter 11, describing
how GPS and geocaching can be used for education. Pay
attention to this chapter if you’re a teacher or know one.
There are some cool ways to incorporate geocaching into
classroom curriculums, and I’ll give you the lowdown and
all sorts of pointers to places on the Internet where you
can download lesson plans and course material.

f you get hooked on geocaching, you’ll also want to give bench-
mark hunting a try. Benchmarks are permanent markers installed
by a government agency in large rocks, concrete, and other immov-
able objects. They serve as control points — known locations — for
surveyors, engineers, and mapmakers. Because the precise location
of many benchmarks are known, you can use your GPS receiver to
find them, just like you’d search for a geocache.
Searching for benchmarks is a great way to hone your GPS and
search skills because unlike caches, benchmarks aren’t hidden
and are much more difficult for vandals to spirit away. Benchmark
hunting is also an alternative to traditional geocaching if you’re
more into the search and really don’t care about trinkets stashed
in an ammo can. And for you history buffs: Because most bench-
marks are stamped with the date they were installed, it’s pretty
cool to find something out in the middle of nowhere that has been
keeping silent watch for 50, 75, or even over 100 years.
In this chapter, I clue you in to the different types of bench-
marks, show you how to look up their location coordinates (the
Geocaching.com Web site offers a free database of benchmarks
that you can query), give you some practical tips on searching
for a benchmark, and tell you what to do when you find one.
Control points in the United States are generically called bench-
marks. In other parts of the world, they have different names. For
example, in Great Britain, they’re called trigpoints. The Geocaching.
com database currently contains information on only NGS (National

Geodetic Survey) benchmarks located within the United States. This
is because the complete collection of NGS benchmark data is pub-
licly available in an electronically accessible format. Geocaching.
com might expand its database to include other benchmarks as
international interest grows and additional data becomes available.
Understanding Benchmarks
In 1807, President Thomas Jefferson established the United States
Coast Survey, which was the first U.S. government agency tasked
with mapping and surveying land. An essential part of performing
any type of a survey is to establish control points — known loca-
tions with very-precisely recorded coordinates. By using a series
of control points as references and measuring the distance and
angles between the points, you can complete very exacting sur-
veys and create very accurate maps. One of the duties of the U.S.
Coast Survey, now known as the NGS, was to establish a series of
control points throughout the U.S. for surveying and mapping pur-
poses. (If you’re into history like this, be sure to check out Andro
Linklater’s book Measuring America, www.measuringamerica.com.)
The word geodetic comes from geodesy, which is the science of
measuring and monitoring the size and shape of the Earth and
the location of points on its surface. To read more about geodesy,
visit http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/geodesy/
welcome.html.
Of the different types of control points, the ones to be most inter-
ested in are
 Vertical: These mark the exact elevation of a point.
 Horizontal: These mark the precise location coordinates of
a point.
Control points can take a number of different forms, including round
brass or aluminum disks (an example is shown in Figure 9-1), bolts,
or rods. A prominent, fixed feature — such as a water tower, radio
antenna, or building — is a landmark.
Technically, the term benchmark applies only to a vertical (eleva-
tion) control point. However, most people outside the geodesy busi-
ness (including the Geocaching.com Web site) refer to both vertical
and horizontal control points as benchmarks. I’ll do the same.

Other benchmarks
The NGS isn’t the only government agency that places benchmarks in the United
States. States, counties, and cities also use control points. Although no one has put
together a single Web-based database of these other benchmarks as of yet,
http://surveymarks.planetzhanna.com/localcontroldata.shtml
has a variety of links organized by state where you can find information about the
locations of different types of benchmarks.
Control points aren’t exclusive to the United States; they’re found all over the world.
If you’re outside the U.S., you’ll need to do a bit of search engine research to see
whether any Web sites are dedicated to survey markers that country. A few inter-
national sites are on the ’Net, such as www.trigpointinguk.com, which is
devoted to finding trigpoints in Great Britain.
If you’d like to place your own benchmarks or just want some cool souvenirs, check

location of each. Hundreds of thousands of these control points
are in existence, with their locations part of the public record and
available to anyone with an Internet connection. What is especially
impressive is the level of precision that horizontal benchmark
coordinates have, especially considering that they were installed
long before GPS technology was available. By using transits (small
telescopes mounted on a tripod used for measuring horizontal and
vertical angles during a survey), measuring rods, and chains, sur-
veyors and engineers were able to achieve measurement errors of
less than 1 inch in 90 miles.
Benchmarks and control points come in all different sizes, shapes,
and types. For an excellent collection of photos and descriptions
of various benchmarks, check out www.dustyjacket.com/
benchmarks.html.
Identifying Benchmarks
in Your Area
If you want to give benchmark hunting a try, the first step is to iden-
tify where benchmarks in an area are located. You can research the
locations of benchmarks in the United States two different ways:
 Use the Geocaching.com Web site (www.geocaching.com;
the same site you use for listing geocache locations).
 Use the National Geodetic Survey Web site (www.ngs.noaa.
gov/cgi-bin/datasheet.prl).
If you start to get serious about benchmark hunting, I recommend
that you pick up a copy of Maptech’s Terrain Navigator Pro. In
addition to providing electronic topographic maps for an entire
state, the program also plots NGS benchmarks on maps that you
can click to display detailed information. To find out more about
the program, which is priced around $300 per state, visit www.
maptech.com.
Benchmarks from Geocaching.com
The Geocaching.com site has an extensive database of NGS control
points that’s quick and easy to search.
The Geocaching.com home page has a Check out benchmark link
that will take you to the benchmark search page, or you can go
directly to it via your Web browser at www.geocaching.com/mark.

166

The benchmark page has two search options:
 By Postal Code: Enter the ZIP code for the area you’re inter-
ested in searching for benchmarks.
The Geocaching.com database currently lists only U.S.
benchmarks.
 By Point ID (PID): All benchmarks have a unique permanent
identifier number associated with them. This number is usu-
ally stamped on metal disk benchmarks.
Click the Other search options link to go to a page where you can
search by state, benchmark designation, or latitude and longitude
coordinates.
After you enter your search parameter and click GO, a list of
benchmarks is displayed, such as the one shown in Figure 9-2.
Figure 9-2: Geocaching.com results of a benchmark search.
The list has the following information:
 Icon: An icon that looks like a metal survey disk provides gen-
eral information about the state of the benchmark. For exam-
ple, an icon with an exclamation mark in the center means that
someone has found and logged that particular benchmark. A
legend with the meanings of the different icons appears at the
bottom of the page.
Chapter 9: Searching for Benchmarks 167

 PID: This is the permanent identifier number assigned to the
benchmark by the NGS.
 Dist: This is the approximate distance and direction that the
benchmark is from the search ZIP code or coordinates you
entered.
 Designation: Here you find a description of a benchmark, using
standardized NGS abbreviations and codes. This information
isn’t critical for benchmark hunting — and in fact, can get
pretty darn confusing because of the numerous abbreviations
and codes. If there’s some plain-English description in the des-
ignation (such as the name of a place or road), make use of it.
If there isn’t, feel free to ignore the description. However, if you
really get into benchmarks and want to know all about designa-
tions, a complete and painfully detailed guide to benchmark
designations can be viewed at www.ngs.noaa.gov/FGCS/
BlueBook/pdf/Annex_D.pdf.

computer to read this document. To download and install
Reader (for free), go to www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/

 State: This is the state where the benchmark is located.
 Type: This lists the type of benchmark, such as horizontal
control survey disk, vertical control disk, or metal rod.
 Found: This is the date a Geocaching.com user last found
the benchmark.
 Last Log: Here you see an icon associated with a log entry
the last Geocaching.com user made about the benchmark.
A smiley face means the benchmark was located. A frowny
face means that the benchmark was searched for but wasn’t
found, and a broken disk icon means someone looked for the
benchmark and assumed or discovered it to be destroyed.
Each benchmark has a check box at the far right. You can down-
load waypoint information for all checked benchmarks to your PC
by clicking the Download Waypoint File command at the bottom of
the page.
To get information about the location of a benchmark, click its PID
link. A new window opens, with detailed information about the
benchmark. An example is shown in Figure 9-3.
The information page contains latitude and longitude coordinates
for the benchmark, its type, a general map of its location — and
more importantly (scroll down to the bottom of the page), a very

168

detailed description of its location. The directions to the bench-
mark are so exact that in most cases, you don’t even need a GPS
receiver to zero in on the benchmark location.
Figure 9-3: Detailed benchmark information page.
If you click the view original datasheet link, a separate window
opens that shows all the NGS data associated with the benchmark.
Some of this is pretty detailed or technical, so don’t get intimidated.
You definitely don’t need this level of in-depth information to search
for benchmarks. However, if you turn into a real benchmark geek,
you’ll probably want to check it out. Better yet, read the next section
on how to get detailed datasheet information right from the source.
Benchmarks from the National
Geodetic Survey
In addition to using Geocaching.com, you can get benchmark infor-
mation directly from the National Geodetic Survey Web site at www.
ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/datasheet.prl. Here’s how, but keep
in mind that using this method isn’t as easy or intuitive as using
Geocaching.com:
1. Click the DATASHEETS button.
2. Click the COUNTY link.
Chapter 9: Searching for Benchmarks 169

You can also search by the benchmark PID, USGS topo-
graphic quad map name, and other search options.
3. Select a state from the list box and then click the Get
County List button.
4. Select the county from the list box.
5. (Optional) You can also select the type of control point to
display. Leave the default Any Horz. And/or Vert. Control
option selected as well as the default setting for Stability
Desired.
6. Click the Get Marks button.
A scrollable list of all the benchmarks is displayed, as
shown in Figure 9-4. You can resort by the PID and other
options that appear above the list.
7. Select the benchmark for which you want to view
detailed information and then click the Get Datasheets
button.
A scrollable datasheet with complete information about
the benchmark appears. An example is shown in Figure 9-5.
Pertinent information includes
• Latitude and longitude coordinates, listed on the same
line as the map datum. (Read Chapter 3 for more on
datums.)
• The type of benchmark and how it is placed.
• Historical information about the benchmark.
• A text description of the benchmark location.
I prefer using the Geocaching.com site for doing general bench-
mark research because its user interface is considerably better
than the NGS site. Geocaching.com uses the same NGS benchmark
information in its database although the NGS benchmark data-
sheets might be more up-to-date in certain cases.
I use the NGS site if I want to take advantage of its advanced search
features or plot benchmarks on a digital map. BMGPX is a free
Windows program that converts the location coordinates found
in NGS benchmark datasheets into the GPX data format (GPS
Exchange, which is a file format that allows mapping and GPS pro-
grams to easily share data). You can then import the benchmark
location data to a map program to overlay the locations of the
benchmarks. BMGPX is available at www.parkrrrr.com.

Finding Benchmarks
After you discover where a benchmark is located based on the
NGS data, it’s time to go find it. But before you head out the door,
though, note these important distinctions between geocaching
and benchmark hunting. With benchmark searches, there are
 No GPS receivers required: Information about most bench-
marks was recorded in the pre-GPS days, and the descriptions
on how to get to the locations are often detailed enough that
you don’t need a GPS receiver. (It’s still not a bad idea to bring
your receiver with you with the benchmark coordinates
entered as a waypoint.)
 No logbooks to sign: However, you can still log your finds
online at the Geocaching.com Web site if you want, just like
when you find a geocache.
 No goodies to exchange: Please don’t try to take a benchmark
with you as a souvenir; doing so is a federal offense.
 No cache containers: Benchmarks, especially the common,
metal disk variety, are weatherproof and are usually encased
in concrete.
 No concealed hiding places: Benchmarks were placed so
someone who knew their location could find them. However,
that doesn’t mean there’s a big neon sign with an arrow point-
ing to their location.
Finding a benchmark can sometimes be just as challenging as
locating a geocache for a number of reasons, including
 Color: The color of the benchmark, especially if it’s a metal
disk, might blend in with the surroundings.
 Hidden: Vegetation or soil might obscure the benchmark.
 Gone: The benchmark might have been taken or destroyed
since the last verified NGS visit.
 On private land: Unlike geocaches, which tend to be on public
land, a number of benchmarks are located on private prop-
erty. (Please respect property owners.)
 Oops: The coordinates might be in error. This is particularly
true with vertical control points, which were used for recording
elevations and didn’t need the high level of precision coordi-
nates found with horizontal control points. Also, there’s always
human error, and sometimes the surveyor just made a boo-boo.
Part III: Advanced Geocaching 
172

Not all benchmarks are located in the middle of nowhere. Some are
in urban areas or next to highways or other busy roads. Be careful
not to get run over in your excitement to log a new benchmark find.
Starting your benchmark search
Starting your search for a benchmark is pretty straightforward.
Here are the steps that you’ll take:
1. Print a copy of the directions from the benchmark
datasheet. Also gather any maps that might be helpful
in locating a benchmark.
Some benchmarks are identified on topographic maps with
the letters BM.
2. Enter the benchmark’s location as a waypoint in your
GPS receiver.
Check out Chapter 3 for more on waypoints if you don’t
know what they are.
3. Drive as close to the benchmark as you can get.
You can use some of the techniques for getting close to a
geocache that are described in Chapter 6.
4. Activate the benchmark’s waypoint and use your GPS
receiver to guide you to the benchmark location.
You did set a waypoint for where your car was parked so
you can find your way back to it, didn’t you?
5. As you head toward the benchmark location, use the
printed directions in conjunction with your GPS receiver
to help you zero in on the location.
Chapter 9: Searching for Benchmarks 173
Waiting for recovery
In benchmark-speak, a recovery happens when the location of a benchmark has
been verified. In a datasheet, if you see that a benchmark has been recovered, the
existence of the benchmark has been confirmed — it doesn’t mean the benchmark
has been removed by the NGS.

6. Keep your eyes open for the benchmark.
Review Web sites that have photos of found benchmarks so
you know what you’re looking for the first couple of times
out. Geocaching.com has a photo gallery devoted to bench-
marks that’s a good resource.
As you search, pay close attention to the benchmark description
and directions. Whoever first placed the benchmark will have pro-
vided detailed information on exactly where the benchmark is
located: for example, “The disk is set in bedrock flush with the
ground. It is 24 feet north of the edge of pavement on Highway 20
and 140 feet west of the centerline of Cooley Road.” (Just remem-
ber that the original or recovery description likely won’t account
for any recent development, like new subdivisions, road widening,
or land clearing.)
Watch for a light bluish color that catches your eye. The elements
will sometimes tarnish older brass survey disks, leaving a blue
patina on the surface that makes them easy to spot.
Documenting a found benchmark
Finding a benchmark is a cool experience because of the history
that’s associated with the marker. Benchmark searchers have
located benchmarks that were monumented (survey-speak for
when the benchmark was first placed) over 100 years ago.
After you find a benchmark, here’s what you should do:
1. If you brought a camera with you, take a digital photo of
the benchmark and the area around it.
2. If you’ve got a GPS receiver with you, record the bench-
mark’s coordinates.
Use the same techniques for recording the location of a
geocache you’ve hidden as described in Chapter 8.
3. Log your find in the Geocaching.com database.
At the top of a benchmark information page is a Log this
benchmark link. If you have a Geocaching.com account and
are logged in (read about this in Chapter 5), click this link
and enter the requested information to record your find.
You can also add digital photos of your finds to the gallery.
Part III: Advanced Geocaching 
174

4. Check the most current NGS datasheet to determine the
last time someone officially visited the benchmark.
If it’s been more than a year, the NGS would be interested
in hearing from you to know that the benchmark is still
there and what condition it’s in to update its records. Check
out the benchmark section in the Geocaching.com forums
(http://forums.groundspeak.com/gc). There’s a perma-
nent thread at the top of the forum with information about
submitting your find to the NGS with the name and e-mail
address of a government employee whom you can contact.
The Geocaching.com forum that’s devoted to benchmarking hunting
has lots of excellent, firsthand information. There’s also an extensive
FAQ on the bottom of the Geocaching.com benchmark search page.
Chapter 9: Searching for Benchmarks 175
Earth Science Corps
If you live in the United States and are into benchmark hunting or geocaching, you
might be interested in joining the USGS Earth Science Corps.
Volunteers update USGS topographic maps to ensure that they are accurate. This
involves walking and driving around and using your GPS receiver to record map
information. There are over 54,000 USGS topographic quadrangle maps that cover
the United States, and there’s a good chance that a map nearby where you live
might need to have a volunteer assigned to update it.

Organized Geocaching Clubs
and Competitions
In This Chapter
 Discovering geocaching clubs
 Finding a local club
 Tracking geocaching stats
 Competing in organized geocaching events
A
s the popularity of geocaching continues to grow, geocaching
clubs and organizations are springing up everywhere. These
clubs provide an outlet for like-minded people to get together and
participate in and learn more about their sport.
In this chapter, I talk about some of the benefits of getting involved
with a geocaching club and how to find one in your area. I also give
you the lowdown on organized caching competitions, in which you
race against the clock or other geocachers.
Geocaching Clubs
As any sport, hobby, or pastime becomes popular, people who
enjoy it are drawn together and eventually form clubs. The same
thing has happened with geocaching, and for such a relatively
young sport, a large number of clubs have appeared in a very
short amount of time.
Because geocaching relies on the Internet, you’ll find most clubs
pretty electronic communications-savvy. Club Web sites, online
forums, e-mail lists, and the use of instant messaging are all very
common.

Why join a club?
Maybe you just started geocaching or perhaps you’ve been at it for
a while. Why should you consider joining a geocaching club? Here
are a number of good reasons:
 Learn the ropes. If you’re new to geocaching and using GPS
receivers, clubs are a good way to get up to speed. You’ll find
geocachers of all levels and abilities eager to share their expe-
riences and skills, either in person or online.
 Find out about local restrictions for placing caches. Clubs
provide a great source of intelligence for anyone interested in
hiding caches. You can learn which public lands allow hiding
caches and which ones have restrictions on them. This can
save you a lot of time researching these issues yourself.
 Participate in group events. Most clubs sponsor events that
combine geocaching with picnics and other outdoor activi-
ties. The events tend to be family-oriented, with some open
only to club members and other events open to the general
public. Many clubs also do volunteer public service work,
such as litter cleanups and park and trail maintenance.
 Hang out with like-minded people. In addition to getting out
in the fresh air to geocache, most clubs have regular scheduled
meetings indoors over coffee or pizza to discuss geocaching
and other related and unrelated topics.
Part III: Advanced Geocaching 
178
Geocaching teams
Another organized form of geocaching involves teams, which are groups of people
who geocache together. They might all live in the same area and go hunting caches
in a group. (If so, they’ll often have a team name and an account for logging their
finds in the Geocaching.com database.) Or, the team’s members might not live any-
where near one another but work together as a virtual team to find particularly chal-
lenging geocaches. A classic example is the notorious Blood & Guts cache located
somewhere in the Eastern United States; so far, only a few people have been able
to locate it. To find the cache, you must solve a series of puzzles. Virtual teams com-
prising geocachers from all over the world have been formed to try to unravel the
clues needed to discover the locations of some of these hard-to-find geocaches.
Team members exchange e-mail and online information so that members who live
near the cache site can zero in on its location. Most of these teams have gotten
together in the regional forums at Geocaching.com.

Like so many other aspects of geocaching, joining a club is a per-
sonal preference. If you like to socialize with people, clubs present
a great opportunity for meeting new friends. If you’re not a people-
person, that’s okay, too. You can still glean a lot of information
about the local geocaching scene by visiting club Web sites and
forums.
Finding a local club
You can use the Internet several different ways to find a local or
regional geocaching club. Take a look at some of the options.
Geocaching.com event calendar
One of your first stops for locating a club should be Geocaching.
com (www.geocaching.com). The Web site has a calendar of
geocaching events — event caches, which are database entries
that have information about upcoming activities and events.
Geocaching clubs and organizations put on most of these events,
and the listings provide contact and other information that you
can use to find a club. To display the event calendar, click the
View the event calendar link on the Geocaching.com home page
(or go to www.geocaching.com/calendar in your Web browser).
See a sample result in Figure 10-1.
Figure 10-1: Find event caches here.
Chapter 10: Organized Geocaching Clubs and Competitions 179

The current month is shown. A list of the countries and U.S. states
where the geocaching events are planned to take place is displayed.
Click the day of the month to view all the events that are scheduled
for that date, as shown in Figure 10-2.
Figure 10-2: Find event caches by date.
Click the name of an event to find out more about it, like the date,
time, and location. An example event cache page is shown in
Figure 10-3.
You can also display recent and current events listed by state or
country. From the Geocaching.com home page, perform a search
by state or country. (See Chapter 5 for details on how to perform
these types of searches.) A list of events, as well as recently hidden
caches, is displayed.
Internet listings and search engines
Many geocaching groups have Web sites and provide up-to-date
information on local geocaching happenings. Table 10-1 has a list
of United States geocaching clubs by state with their Web site
addresses. You can also try doing a Google search for your state
or city along with the word “geocaching” to find clubs that might
not appear on the list.

Competitive Geocaching
It seems that sooner or later, any recreational activity eventually
develops a competitive aspect, and geocaching is no exception.
Although the roots of geocaching are grounded in the personal
challenge of finding a hidden cache, competing against others has
found its way into the sport. Don’t worry, though. This simply adds
another element to geocaching, and you’ll always have a choice of
getting involved in competition or simply enjoying the fun of the
sport.
If you have a competitive nature, take a quick look at several areas
of geocaching that you might be interested in.
Geocaching stats
To some people, geocaching stats (as in statistics) are a way of
measuring their own and others’ ability and credibility within the
sport. Geocaching.com’s account profile pages make it easy to
track how many caches you’ve found and hidden, and some
cachers take these numbers pretty seriously.
Part III: Advanced Geocaching 
184

If geocaching stats are important to you, that’s great. Just don’t get
carried away with inflated feelings of grandeur at your cache num-
bers. Remember, a whole lot of cachers could not care less about
stats but are into the sport for the challenge, enjoyment, and qual-
ity of the experience — all of which are pretty hard to assign mean-
ingful numbers.
If you’re a competitive type and insist on comparing your geocache
finds and hides against others, check out this Web page, which
maintains a leader board based on Geocaching.com stats: http://
zinnware.com/HighAdv/Geocaching/most_caches_found.html.
For the record, at this point in time, CCCooperAgency is leading with
over 5,000 finds, and King Boreas has hidden over 400 caches. That’s
a lot of caches.
Organized competitions
Keeping track of stats has been around since the early days of geo-
caching, but more recently, organized caching competitions have
started to crop up. These events pit geocachers against one another
and the clock, with awards and prizes.
Many geocaching events are modeled after traditional orienteering
competitions and include courses. (Orienteering is a sport in which
you use a map and compass to locate flags.) A course is a single
race. There are usually several courses during an event, each with
a varied level of difficulty. One course might be more suited for
beginning geocachers, while another would be appropriate for
cachers with intermediate to advanced skills.
A series of geocaches or tags with coordinates is hidden on the
course. The competitors are given the coordinates and must find
as many caches or tags as possible within a certain amount of
time. (Sometimes the tag directs competitors to the next tag loca-
tion, like a multicache.) The participants might be given punch
cards to validate each find; each cache or tag has a unique paper
punch used to punch the card.
That’s basically how a competition works although you can find all
sorts of different variations. Individuals or teams compete against
one another, often in separate divisions, such as classes divided by
age group.
Competitive geocaching is currently in its infancy. Although I don’t
foresee professional cachers with multimillion-dollar contracts and
product endorsements, I do think competitive events will become
more widespread and popular.
Chapter 10: Organized Geocaching Clubs and Competitions 185

If you’re interested in trying your hand at competitive caching,
check the Geocaching.com events listings that I describe earlier
in this chapter for any upcoming races.
You’ve heard of football, baseball, basketball, and bowling leagues,
but how about one for geocaching? The Cache League pits organ-
ized geocaching teams against one another for prizes. The team
members don’t even need to all be in the same place because
points are accumulated by individual team member finds. The
league got started in the spring of 2004; find out more about it at
www.cacheleague.com.
Part III: Advanced Geocaching 
186
Speed caching
You don’t need to enter an organized geocaching competition to get the adrenaline
rush associated with racing against others. Athletically inclined geocachers can
try speed caching.
Speed caching simply involves finding one or more caches as fast as you can. From
some set starting point, you hit the stopwatch button on your watch; using your GPS
receiver as a guide, you then run or jog toward the cache location. (The route you
select is up to you.) When you find the cache, press the stopwatch button again
and record your time.
The added pressure of the clock ticking away helps you hone your GPS and navi-
gation skills under stress. (Plus you get a pretty good workout in the process.) You
can either speed cache by yourself as an individual form of exercise or tell your
friends your times and challenge them to find a cache faster than you did.

In This Chapter
 Discovering the benefits of GPS in education
 Reviewing examples of GPS and geocaching in the classroom
 Adding GPS and geocaching to course materials
 Acquiring GPS receivers for classroom use
 Accessing GPS educational resources on the Internet
U
sing GPS receivers and heading out on geocaching trips is a
lot of fun. In addition to the recreational aspects, the whiz-
bang location technology and high-tech, treasure hunt capabilities
offer some intriguing and cool educational possibilities. Creative
teachers who think outside the box are starting to recognize that
GPS can be used in the classroom to enhance learning in a number
of different subjects.
That’s what this chapter is all about. I want to introduce you to
some ideas on using GPS and geocaching in the classroom or for
home schooling. I discuss how GPS can be used when teaching
various subjects, give you some pointers on incorporating GPS
and geocaching into a curriculum, and provide you with all sorts
of Internet resources where you can get lesson plans and student
and instructor materials devoted to using GPS for education. (I
even clue you in on some excellent forums where you can discuss
GPS topics with other educators.)
My goal with this chapter is to get you thinking about how GPS
and geocaching can be used in the classroom. If you’re interested
in using GPS in one of your courses, you’ll find all the information
and pointers to resources you need to get started.

Part III: Advanced Geocaching 
188
GPS in the Schools
In many cases, GPS has snuck in through the back door of school
systems. An educator who has experience with a GPS receiver (such
as a geocacher or outdoor recreator) decides to incorporate GPS
into his or her class.
As the price of GPS receivers continues to drop and they become
easier to use and more common, teachers and students in primary
and secondary schools will have greater access to GPS receivers as
educational tools.
Some of the benefits that GPS receivers offer include
 Providing technology training: Students gain technology
skills that can be used in the instruction of traditional sub-
jects such as math, history, and geography.
 Giving students practical hands-on and real world applica-
tions: Understanding that math and geography have applica-
tions in addition to standard textbook theory can motivate
students in these areas.
 Capturing student attention: Students are interested in the
unique and different. (Bonus: You get them outside.)
 Decreasing new course material development time: A grow-
ing number of lesson plans and resources related to GPS are
available on the Internet.
 Providing value for your resource dollar: GPS receivers are
relatively inexpensive compared with other high-tech hard-
ware. (You can purchase four or five low-end GPS receivers for
the price of a single, low-end PC.) Additionally, receivers don’t
become obsolete as quickly as other computer technologies.
Take a look at some examples of how GPS and geocaching can be
used in teaching different types of subjects. (This isn’t meant to
be an exhaustive list, and its main purpose is to get some ideas of
your own percolating.)
Geography
Because the purpose behind GPS purpose is to provide accurate
location data, you probably guessed that GPS and geography go
hand-in-hand. You have lots of topical possibilities for using GPS
in a geography class.

 Latitude and longitude: With a GPS receiver, you can clearly
show students the basics of latitude and longitude by having
them watch the coordinates change as they walk in a straight
line. (A football field is a perfect spot for kids to get a handle
on the distances associated with latitude and longitude min-
utes and seconds.)
 Coordinate systems: Setting up geocaches gives students a
better spatial understanding of latitude and longitude and
teaches them practical applications of coordinate systems.
 Map reading: By using GPS receivers in conjunction with
widely available, free and low-cost Geographic Information
System (GIS) and digital mapping software, you can make
maps come alive by taking advantage of a digital map’s inter-
active nature.
One of my favorite Web sites for learning about world geography is
the Degree Confluence Project (www.confluence.org). The goal
of this project is to collect digital photos of all the primary latitude
and longitude line intersections on Earth. This is a remarkable tool
for relating to the rest of the world outside your own backyard.
History and sociology
Although it seems logical to use GPS in geography-related courses,
the technology is equally at home in history and other classes that
are people-oriented.
Using GPS receivers to locate old trails, city boundaries, and sig-
nificant historical sites helps students better relate to the past and
present. For example, the Project Alternative Learning High School
in Helena, Montana received a National Geographic Educational
Foundation grant, part of which involved using GPS and GIS soft-
ware to confirm or correct longitude and latitude measurements
originally documented by Lewis and Clark.
You can choose how ambitious you want your project to be. A rela-
tively simple activity could involve setting up a series of virtual
geocaches that takes students on a walking tour of local historic
sites. When students reach the waypoints associated with the
sites, they answer questions about what they find.
Ecology
One of the primary uses for GPS receivers in ecology-related
classes is as data loggers. Students use a GPS receiver to record
the locations of plants and animals and then plot the locations
Chapter 11: GPS and Geocaching in Education 189

on digital maps. A good example is the 7th-grade students in Nancy
Spencer’s Earth Sciences class in Waitsfield, Vermont, who used
GPS and GIS to investigate the role of wildlife tracking and habitat
mapping in landscape conservation and stewardship.
National Geographic has hundreds of teacher-used and -approved
lesson plans for many different subjects; including a number that
incorporate GPS. To check out the free online lesson plans, visit
www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions.
Mathematics
The technology that makes GPS work relies on mathematics, and
GPS can be used to teach time, distance, and speed concepts.
With a GPS receiver, students can learn about basic principles
such as determining the area of a polygon. Or they can get into
more complex math, such as learning how the Pythagorean theo-
rem, inverse trigonometric functions, and equations relating to
circles and spheres all are used in making the GPS system work
correctly. Basic math skills can be incorporated into a multicache
or mystery cache (see Chapter 5 for more about these types of
caches), such as completing an equation to get the correct coordi-
nates of the cache.
For some excellent examples of using GPS and geocaching to teach
various math concepts, see David Royster’s GPS: Global Positioning
Systems and Mathematics presentation and handout at www.math.
uncc.edu/~droyster.
Physical education
I talk about health and fitness benefits that geocaching can bring
to adults in Chapter 6, and the same holds true with kids. Setting
up multicaches, dividing up a PE class into teams, and having the
teams find the caches as quickly as possible is one possible appli-
cation. GPS receivers can also measure the distance of jogging
courses and average speeds to give students an idea of how fast
they are going when they run a set distance in a certain amount
of time. One unique use of GPS took place in a middle school in
Howland, Maine, as part of its PE and health classes. Teacher Barb
Hamlin received a grant for students to use GPS receivers and map-
ping software to create maps of local snowmobile trails. Previous
maps of the area weren’t very accurate. Along with the educational
aspects, the activity was also a public service project because the
new maps were to be made available to local snowmobilers.
Part III: Advanced Geocaching 
190

As you can see, GPS receivers can be used in teaching a number of
different subjects. If a school can acquire GPS receivers for student
use, it makes sense to have them available for multiple teachers
and classes. Don’t get locked into the idea that GPS receivers can
be used only for geography classes.
Incorporating GPS in a Class
Incorporating GPS into a class takes a little bit of thought and plan-
ning. In this section, I highlight some of the issues that you’ll need
to address when using GPS in the classroom. I discuss some cur-
riculum considerations, give you some ideas on how and where to
get GPS receivers for your students, and talk a little about evaluat-
ing your success.
Chapter 11: GPS and Geocaching in Education 191
Containerless caches
When it comes to geocaching and education, caches don’t always consist of ammo
cans and plastic containers. Virtual caches (which don’t have a cache container
associated with them) and locationless caches (which also don’t have containers
but sort of work in reverse where you locate something and then record its coordi-
nates) are well suited for educational caches. (Read about all the different types of
caches in Chapter 5.)
Some excellent locationless caches have been developed by New York educator
Anton Ninno and appear in the Geocaching.com database. Here are a few caches
that should give you some ideas.
Know your birds:

Women of Courage:
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=36018
Native American History Lesson:
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=26263
Unfortunately, the Geocaching.com staff put a moratorium on locationless caches
a while back, so for the time being, you can’t add new caches of this type to the
database. However, that doesn’t stop you from creating your own locationless
caches for your students and publishing them on a school Web site so they are
available to anyone with an Internet connection.

Developing the curriculum
Because this book primarily focuses on geocaching and GPS, I’m not
going to get into the fine points of curriculum and course material
development. (If you’re an educator, I’m sure you’re already have
that dialed in.) Rather, I cover a few issues to think about if you’re
considering adding a GPS or geocaching component to an existing
curriculum or developing a new one wrapped around GPS.
Is there a fit?
First off, you should determine whether GPS or geocaching fits into
the subject matter that you’ll be teaching. Although I’m a techno-
geek at heart, I don’t believe in using technology for technology’s
sake. Trying to shoehorn technology into a curriculum when it
really doesn’t make sense is not a good idea — such as if you’re
not comfortable with the technology (which is okay) or if it doesn’t
significantly contribute to the educational goals of your class.
I’m also a big believer in applying a cost/benefit model to curriculum
development. Educators are usually faced with limited time and
small budgets, and I’m a fan of maximizing time and money invest-
ments to get the most educational bang for your buck. That means
you should carefully estimate how much time, effort, and money it
will cost to add a GPS component to a curriculum and then deter-
mine what the probable return will be on your investment.
Teaching students how to use GPS receivers
If you incorporate geocaching or GPS use in the classroom, both
you and your students will need to know how to use a GPS receiver.
If at a quick glance, you can’t tell the difference between a cell-
phone and a GPS receiver (although some of them do look the
same) and have never used a receiver before, don’t worry. You can
find some excellent lesson plans and instructional materials that
other educators have already developed that can bring you and
your students up to speed. I list a number of different Internet
resources at the end of this chapter that you can consult and
download files from.
Adding geocaching to subject matter
If you already have course material developed for one of the sub-
ject you teach, you can add geocaching-related activities to engage
students and reinforce topics you’ll be covering.
Part III: Advanced Geocaching 
192

For an example of incorporating geocaching into a 6th-grade Social
Studies class, check out some of activities that Mike Seavert (a
teacher at Whitnall Middle School in Greenfield, Wisconsin) came
up with at www.whitnall.com/teachers/6th_grade/seavert/
geocaching.htm.
Reading through the ideas and activities mentioned in this chapter
should start you thinking about how to set up your own educational
geocaches. Skim through the rest of the book to get a better under-
standing of the nuances of geocaching. Here are some general steps
to help you get rolling:
1. Determine what you want to get out of a geocaching
activity.
This could be a better understanding of latitude and longi-
tude, tracking the progress of a Travel Bug as it moves from
cache to cache, or setting up a puzzle cache that relies on
historical facts to find.
2. Identify appropriate cache locations.
This could be a traditional cache hidden in a container or
a virtual cache with a location and no cache container. You
need to record the location coordinates of the cache, which
I describe how to do in Chapter 8.
3. Set up the cache.
This involves getting the cache ready. It could mean select-
ing a cache container (if you decide to use one), inserting
goodies into the container, or coming up with clues that are
associated with the cache.
4. Announce the cache so your students can use it.
Here are the two ways to accomplish this:
• Use the Geocaching.com site: Add your educational
caches to the Geocaching.com database. Students will
need to know how to access the Internet and use a Web
browser to get the cache information — both very good
skills to have. This approach makes the educational
cache available to the general public.
• Provide cache information to students: Use handouts or
the school’s Web site. This makes the cache a little more
private and more under your control.
5. Get your students geocaching!
It’s the moment of truth — time to see how your activity
turns out.
Chapter 11: GPS and Geocaching in Education 193

Acquiring GPS receivers
Obviously, you’re going to need GPS receivers if you want to incor-
porate GPS or geocaching into a curriculum or class material. In
terms of cost, you can currently purchase GPS receivers for around
$100 that are more than adequate for educational use. (Check out
Chapter 2 for some guidance on selecting a GPS receiver.)
You certainly don’t need to purchase one GPS receiver for every
student in a class. In fact, GPS receivers really work well in small
group activities. Depending on your class size and budget, you can
develop activities in which 2–7 students share a GPS receiver and
work together as a team.
Some possible ways to acquire GPS receivers for classroom use
include
 Technology-in-education grants
 Fund raising events
 Loaned units from recreational businesses (ski resorts, guide
services, and other companies that might use GPS receivers)
 Education-friendly GPS retailers that might make you a great
deal on GPS receivers
 GPS receivers loaned from your students’ parents
If at all possible, try to standardize the GPS receiver models you’ll
be purchasing and using in the classroom. Although all receivers
have the same basic features, their user interfaces vary consider-
ably from model to model and even within a brand. Using a single
model is much easier to teach (and troubleshoot).
Evaluating your success
After you’ve used a GPS or geocaching activity in a class, at some
point, take a few moments to evaluate its success. Here are some
questions to ask yourself:
 Did you incorporate pre- and post-testing to measure instruc-
tional effectiveness? What were the outcomes?
 Were there any differences in grades associated with past
classes that didn’t use GPS as part of the course?
Part III: Advanced Geocaching 
194

 How did your students respond to the activity?
 Was the activity worth the time it took to develop and imple-
ment, and will you use it again?
Regardless of the results, share the outcome with other educators.
By incorporating GPS in your class, you’re something of a pioneer,
and sharing your experiences with others is beneficial so they can
learn from your efforts. In the next section, I list some Internet
resources, including a great e-mail list where you can interact
with other educators who use or are interested in using GPS in
the classroom.
Educational Internet Resources
If using GPS and geocaching for education interests you, you don’t
need to be the Lone Ranger in figuring everything out. The Internet
has a wealth of resources where you can download lesson plans,
interact with other educators, and come up to speed on GPS tech-
nology. Here is a list of essential resources:
 NYGPS (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nygps):
NYGPS is a Yahoo! Group started by New York educator
Anton Ninno. Its purpose is to serve as a clearinghouse for
information on GPS-related educational material. You’ll find
articles, lesson plans, lively discussion, and an extensive col-
lection of resources on using GPS in the classroom. I highly
recommend joining this group. Don’t just rely on group e-mail
messages. The collection of links and documents that Ninno
has available through the group home page is remarkable.
 Lane Education Service District (www.lane.k12.or.us/
insttech/vtc/gps.html): The Lane Education Service
District (Lane County, Oregon) has an excellent GPS in educa-
tion Web page. Educator Lynn Lary has given workshops and
written articles that promote the use of GPS as an educational
tool. This Web page contains many of Lary’s resources and is
a great starting place for anyone interested in including GPS
and geocaching in K–12 curriculums.
 Louisiana Center for Educational Studies (www.doe.state.
la.us/lde/lcet/398.html): The Louisiana Department of
Education INTECH 2 Social Studies CD is a complete series of
lesson plans and classroom materials for teaching students
about GIS and GPS; including a section on geocaching. The
original contents of the CD were placed on this Web site and
provide a great resource for teachers.
Chapter 11: GPS and Geocaching in Education 195

 Institute for the Application of Geospatial Technology (IAGT)
at Cayuga Community College (www.iagt.org): The IAGT is
a not-for-profit organization that specializes in the application
of Geographic Information Technologies (GIT) — science-speak
for activities relating to GPS, GIS, and remote-sensing. Part
of IAGT’s mission is to help teachers incorporate GIT in
their classrooms. Every year, the IAGT sponsors CORSE
(Conference on Remote Sensing Education), which teaches
educators about geospatial technology and how to include it
in course material. In addition to sponsoring the conference,
the IAGT also maintains a collection of GPS-related lesson
plans and resources on its Web site.
 GPS In Education Geocaching.com forum (http://forums.
groundspeak.com/gc): One of the Web discussion groups
in the Geocaching.com forums is GPS In Education, which is
devoted to educators and using GPS, including geocaching,
in the classroom. Anyone can browse through past messages,
but you need a free account to post messages.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he foundations of geocaching are based on slick tech-
nology, and this is the techie part of the book. No,
not the high-level math that makes GPS work but rather
the more practical applications that anyone can use. In
Chapter 12, I list ten of what I consider to be the best geo-
caching resources on the Internet. You’ll ﬁnd Web sites
with how-to information, cool historical facts, and a few
surprises thrown in as well. In Chapter 13, I clue you in
to some of the most popular free and shareware programs
that geocachers use. You’ll ﬁnd programs that serve as
cache databases on PCs and PDAs, software that plots
cache locations on aerial photos and topographic maps,
and utilities that convert different format types of GPS-
related data.

ecause geocaching relies so much on the Internet, it shouldn’t
come as too much of a surprise that a number of Web sites
are devoted to the sport. In this chapter, I give you the lowdown
on ten great geocaching Web sites (plus a bonus GPS site) that you
should definitely check out.
Geocaching.com
www.geocaching.com
This is the primary geocaching site on the ’Net — you might have
already guessed that from me talking about the site so much in this
book. In addition to an extensive database of caches and FAQs
about the sport, the site also has a large number of forums dedi-
cated to different geocaching topics.

Navicache.com
www.navicache.com
This is the second-largest Web site dedicated to geocaching; but
it’s still quite a bit smaller than Geocaching.com in terms of caches
listed. The site has many of the same features as Geocaching.com
and is viewed by some geocachers as an alternative to the larger,
more mainstream site. You’ll note some duplication in the cache
listings between the two sites, but you should always check them
both when you’re checking out lists of caches hidden in an area.
The more caches to search for, the better.
The geocaching community is not immune to politics. Small skir-
mishes and large-scale battles can break out between individuals
and rival Web sites. It’s best just to duck your head, look at your
GPS receiver, and head to a cache waypoint.
Buxley’s Geocaching Waypoint
http://brillig.com/geocaching
This Web site has an extensive collection of world maps that pro-
vide a bird’s-eye view of geocaches. Dots on the maps represent
caches; when you click a dot, you go to the Geocaching.com infor-
mation page associated with that cache. This is a great way to scout
caches by area. The site also has geocaching statistics, event list-
ings, and other information related to the sport.
GPS Visualizer
www.gpsvisualizer.com
Okay, it’s not geocaching-specific, but it is a very cool and useful
Web site. GPS Visualizer generates maps based on GPS data that
you upload to the site. You can overlay GPS waypoints, including
Geocaching.com LOC files (a file format that contains waypoint
information), onto aerial and satellite photos and topographic
and street maps to plot exactly where a cache is located. GPS
Visualizer is perfect if you don’t want to (or for some reason can’t)
install mapping programs on your PC. One of its benefits to inter-
national users is that it can create maps of areas both inside and
outside the United States. GPS Visualizer is currently free although
the author does ask for a small donation if you find the site useful.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
200

Today’s Cacher
www.todayscacher.com
Today’s Cacher is an online magazine devoted to geocaching. The
Web site debuted in the spring of 2004 and includes first-person
geocaching accounts, descriptions of cool caches, editorials, and
miscellaneous hints and tips. The articles are well written, informa-
tive, and entertaining. You should definitely put this site in your
Web browser’s bookmarks to check every month.
Geocacher University
www.geocacher-u.com
The goal of this Web site is to provide educational material to both
new and experienced geocachers. The site features an excellent Let’s
Go Geocaching! brochure that you can download and print to give
to people who are interested in the sport. (One geocacher claims
that the brochure saved him from getting arrested when he showed
it to a law enforcement officer who wondered what he was up to.)
Markwell’s FAQs
http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/marklent60544/
myhomepage/Geocaching/markwellcachemain.htm
When you need information that goes beyond the Geocaching.com
FAQ, this Web site is the place to visit for a comprehensive collec-
tion of facts. Markwell is a longtime geocacher out of the Chicago
area who has gained a reputation as a font of knowledge as well as
having a near-photographic memory for topics discussed in the
Geocaching.com forums. In fact, his name has been turned into a
verb on the forums and is synonymous with citing a thread (or
threads) where a topic was already talked about, ending the need
to discuss it again.
KeenPeople.com
www.keenpeople.com
This Web site is a friendly, open community of geocachers and out-
doors enthusiasts. You’ll find geocaching news, stats, and some
great map and GPS resources.
Chapter 12: Ten Internet Geocaching Resources 201

The First 100 Geocaches
http://members.cox.net/pkpublic/index.html
If you’re a geocache history buff, this Web site is for you. It contains
a list of the 100 oldest geocaches, including who hid them, their
location, and whether they’re still active or not. This site is fun just
to see how the sport got started only a few short years ago.
Letterboxing North America
www.letterboxing.org
Letterboxing is a forerunner of geocaching that has British roots.
It involves hiding logbooks and specially made rubber stamps in
waterproof boxes. The hider gives clues to a box’s location (no
GPS receivers are required). When a searcher finds the box, she
stamps the box’s logbook with her personal stamp and then stamps
her personal logbook with the box’s stamp. Every box and letter-
boxer has unique stamps (some very much works of art), so the
logbooks turn into an aesthetic historical record. Letterboxing has
a certain elegance and Old World charm to it and can even be more
challenging than geocaching. This Web site tells you everything
you need to know to get started with letterboxing in the U.S. (It
also has references to international letterboxing sites.)
GPSInformation.net
www.gpsinformation.net
Finally, because geocaching is so dependent on GPS, I’ve got
to mention the best source of information on the Internet,
GPSInformation.net. This comprehensive Web site has GPS
receiver reviews, technical data, and addresses just about any
question about GPS you might have. If you’re in the market for
a new GPS receiver or want to get the most out of your current
receiver, this is the place to visit.

hen it comes to computers, geocaching doesn’t mean just
using Internet and Web sites. You can use a number of
standalone programs on your PC or PDA to assist with your geo-
caching hobby. In this chapter, I present ten programs that are
especially useful for geocachers. All these software programs are
free or are nominally priced shareware titles, so you don’t need
to come up with a lot of cash to use them. (Sorry, I’ve been waiting
the entire book to include that pun.)
You can purchase GPS receiver cards to use with a Palm or Pocket
PC PDA. In fact, some geocachers rely on GPS-equipped PDAs
instead of conventional handheld GPS receivers. Using a PDA
with an integrated GPS receiver provides some slick benefits,
including the ability to use detailed topographic maps and geo-
caching software in the field away from your PC. However, remem-
ber that PDAs aren’t waterproof, are considerably more fragile
than handheld GPS receivers, and have a significantly shorter bat-
tery life than a GPS receiver. Expect to spend roughly $150–$250
for a GPS card.

Geocaching Swiss Army Knife
(GSAK)
http://gsak.net
The popular Geocaching Swiss Army Knife (commonly known by
its abbreviation, GSAK) lives up to its name of being one of the most
multi-purpose, do-everything, geocaching programs around. This
free Windows program serves as a database for caches you’ve found
or are looking for; an interface to GPS receivers for uploading and
downloading waypoints; and a utility for exporting cache location
information to digital mapping programs such as DeLorme Street
Atlas USA (www.delorme.com), Microsoft Streets & Trips (www.
microsoft.com/streets/default.asp), and National Geographic
TOPO! (http://maps.nationalgeographic.com/topo).
GPXSonar
http://gpxsonar.homeip.net/default.aspx
GPXSonar is a free program for Pocket PC PDAs for those whose
goal is zero-paper geocaching. The utility manages cache data that
you download from Geocaching.com. You can view cache informa-
tion, log finds, generate reports, and export cache waypoints to
GPS receivers.
CacheMate
www.smittyware.com/palm/cachemate
If you’re a Palm PDA user, check out CacheMate, a cache informa-
tion manager and database. The big advantage to programs like
GPXSonar and CacheMate is that you don’t need to constantly
print out geocache information pages every time you go hunting
for a cache. Just load cache data from Geocaching.com onto your
PDA, and you’re ready to go. CacheMate is priced at $7.
If you use a database program on your PDA for keeping track of
caches, instead of just loading the next cache you plan on looking
for, consider loading a number of caches you haven’t located yet.
This allows you to be spontaneous with your geocaching adven-
tures. When you have some free time, just grab your PDA and GPS
receiver, and you can go after caches that aren’t on your found
list yet.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
204

Watcher
http://clayjar.com
One of the benefits of becoming a Premium Member of Geocaching.
com (see Chapter 5) is the ability to download Pocket Queries —
information about up to 500 geocaches saved to a single GPX format
file. (GPX stands for GPS Exchange, which is a format that makes it
easy for mapping and GPS programs to exchange data.) Watcher is
a popular and free Windows program that manages Pocket Query
cache information. After you download a Pocket Query for selected
caches, Watcher provides you with all the cache information that
you’d normally find on the Geocaching.com site without the need
for an Internet connection. The program has a number of powerful
filtering options that display only those caches that meet your
search criteria.
Plucker
http://plkr.org
Plucker is a free offline Web browser that works with Palm OS PDAs.
That is, it can access saved HTML Web pages so you can view the
Web pages at some later time without an Internet connection. You
can use Plucker to view geocache information pages that have
been saved from Geocaching.com.
To get the HTML files into a format that Plucker understands,
Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X desktop versions of Plucker are
available (http://desktop.plkr.org) that save Web pages on
your PC and then sync them with your Palm.
Better yet are geocaching-specific programs such as GPX Spinner
(www.gpxspinner.com) and GPX2HTML (a free utility available
at http://home.comcast.net/~fizzymagic/gpx2html.html),
which create HTML files on your PC from GPX data that you can
then upload to your Palm PDA.
GPSBabel
http://gpsbabel.sourceforge.net
GPSBabel is a free, must-have utility for any GPS receiver owner
who deals with digital maps and software programs that interface
with GPS data. One of the big challenges for a GPS user is the wide
Chapter 13: Ten Geocaching Programs 205

array of waypoint, route, and track log data formats. For example,
trying to transfer waypoints stored in one map program to another
can be extremely frustrating. As its name suggests (from the Biblical
Tower of Babel), GPSBabel eliminates many of the communication
problems that you encounter when you try to get two programs or
different brands of GPS receivers to work with the other’s GPS data.
GPSBabel can convert waypoints, tracks, and routes from one
format to another. Windows, Linux, and Mac versions of the pro-
gram are available.
Find an online version of GPSBabel available at http://wayhoo.
com/index/a/gpsbabel, where you can do all your conversions
with a Web browser and Internet connection.
USAPhotoMaps
http://jdmcox.com
TerraServer-USA (www.terraserver-usa.com) is a cool Web site
that displays aerial photos and topographic maps of the United
States. USAPhotoMaps is a free, standalone Windows program that
downloads TerraServer-USA images to your PC, creating scrollable
maps on your hard drive that you can zoom in and out. Even better
yet, the program interfaces with GPS receivers and can download
a waypoint that you’ve created for a geocache, overlaying its loca-
tion on a map or an aerial photo. Although USAPhotoMaps is free,
the author asks for a small donation if you find the program useful.
TopoFusion
www.topofusion.com
TopoFusion is another Windows program that uses TerraServer-
USA data to display aerial photos and topographic maps. In addi-
tion to being able to plot geocache waypoint locations on maps,
TopoFusion also has a number of powerful features, such as creat-
ing three-dimensional maps based on terrain elevation, extensive
waypoint and track point management, and the ability to link digi-
tal photos with GPS coordinates. The extensive feature list and the
fast image display speed make this one of my favorite PC mapping
programs. TopoFusion is priced at $40, but you can download a
trial version of the software (fully functional but prints “DEMO”
