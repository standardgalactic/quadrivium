Universitext is a series of textbooks that presents material from a wide variety
of mathematical disciplines at master’s level and beyond. The books, often well
class-tested by their author, may have an informal, personal, even experimental
approach to their subject matter. Some of the most successful and established
books in the series have evolved through several editions, always following the
evolution of teaching curricula, into very polished texts.
Thus as research topics trickle down into graduate-level teaching, ﬁrst textbooks
written for new, cutting-edge courses may make their way into Universitext.

Preface to the German Edition
This textbook is based on lecture notes for courses on mathematical logic and model
theory that I have been giving in recent years at the University of Konstanz. A goal
of the model theory course was to give a thorough and self-contained presentation
of the model theoretic aspects of a series of algebraic theories. This was motivated
especially by the intent to write a book using the lecture notes that would allow
interested mathematicians not trained in this special ﬁeld to get to know and un-
derstand the best known model theoretic results in algebra common at the time. As
probably the most interesting example, let us mention only J. Ax and S. Kochen’s
treatment of “Artin’s conjecture” on p-adic number ﬁelds.
Since the character of model theoretic results and constructions differs quite pro-
foundly from that commonly found in algebra, because of the treatment of formulae
as objects, it seems to me indispensable, for a deeper understanding, to become
familiar with the problems and methods of mathematical logic. I have therefore pre-
ceded the treatment of model theory with an introduction to mathematical logic.
From this results a distinct partition of the book into three parts: mathematical logic
(Chapter 1), model theory (Chapters 2 and 3) and the model theoretic treatment of
several algebraic theories (Chapter 4).
Because of the special goal of this book, I have not aspired to completeness in
either the logical or the model theoretic part – this book makes no claim to present
either of these two ﬁelds as completely as is nowadays common. Instead, I have tried
to be as complete and detailed as possible while pursuing the goal stated above.
(This explains, among other things, the limited number of exercises.) For further
reading I refer the reader to [Shoenﬁeld, 1967] and [Chang–Keisler, 1973–90].
I thank Dr U. Friedrichsdorf and Messrs J. Dix and J. Schmid for a careful read-
ing of the entire text and for numerous suggestions. And I thank Mrs Edda Polte for
the careful preparation of this manuscript.

Preface to the English Edition
The original purpose of the German edition, written in 1986, was to give an in-
troduction to basic model theory and to the model theoretic treatment of several
algebraic theories – in particular, the theory of Henselian valued ﬁelds, presenting
J. Ax and S. Kochen’s result on the “Artin conjecture” on p-adic number ﬁelds. It
was considered indispensable, for a deeper understanding, to base this introduction
to model theory on a presentation of formal logic.
The purpose of this new book is to make this kind of introduction available to
a larger audience of mathematicians (as German is sometimes considered to be a
difﬁcult language). The English version of the 1986 German book is essentially just
a translation. It was not our intention to include subsequent developments, since we
did not want to add a new book to the many good books that concentrate mainly on
model theory, such as [Hodges, 1997], [Marker, 2002] and [Tent–Ziegler, 2011].
Compared with the German version, there are only two major changes: we have
considerably increased the number of exercises, and we have added a second ap-
pendix, in which we try to explain to the reader the difference between ﬁrst- and
second-order logic.
There are several possible ways to use this book in a course, either for ﬁrst- or
second-year graduate students or for advanced undergraduates. For a course in logic
alone (with no model theory), one could cover Chapter 1 and Appendix A (and
possibly also Appendix B); for such a course, the student would need little prior
knowledge of speciﬁc areas of mathematics, but only some mathematical maturity,
i.e. some experience in proving theorems. For a course in model theory alone, one
can skip Chapter 1 with the exception of the deﬁnitions of a formula (Section 1.2), a
structure and the satisfaction of a formula by a structure (Section 1.5).1 For a short
course in model theory, Chapters 2 and 3 will sufﬁce (here some familiarity with
cardinal and ordinal numbers is required). For a longer course, one could include
1 In skipping most of Chapter 1 (i.e. formal proofs), the proof of Theorem 2.1.1 will have to rely,
instead, on Theorems 2.6.4 and 2.3.3.

Chapter 4 as well; in Sections 4.3–4.6, the student should have some prior acquain-

Introduction
In the middle of the 1960s, several model theoretic arguments and methods of con-
struction captured the attention of the mathematical world. J. Ax and S. Kochen suc-
ceeded, in joint work, in achieving a decisive contribution to the “Artin conjecture”
on the solvability of homogeneous diophantine equations over p-adic number ﬁelds.
This and other results led to an inﬁltration of certain model theoretic concepts and
methods into algebra. Because of their strangeness, however, very few algebraists
could become comfortable with them. This is not so astonishing once one traces the
historical development of model theoretic concepts and methods from their origin
up to their present-day applications: their applicability to algebra is not the result
of a goal-directed development (more precisely, a development directed toward the
goal of these applications), but is, rather, a by-product of an investigation directed
toward a quite different goal, namely, the goal of getting to grips with the founda-
tions of mathematics. The need to secure these foundations had become urgent after
various contradictions in mathematics were discovered at the end of the nineteenth
and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.
The attempt to lay a foundation for analysis had led to the development of set
theory at the end of the nineteenth century. This development was more and more
connected with the use (and, a fortiori, the assumption of the existence) of inﬁnite
sets that were less and less comprehensible. From a modern-day perspective it is
not surprising that contradictions eventually arose from such existence assumptions.
Here we may recall Russell’s antinomy, in which a contradiction arose from the
assumption of the existence of a set whose elements are precisely those sets that do
not contain themselves as elements.
One of the most signiﬁcant proposals for a new foundation of mathematics –
besides Brouwer’s intuitionism, which in this connection we do not wish to enter
into – is David Hilbert’s proof theory.
Hilbert proposed taking as the objects of consideration not the mathematical ob-
jects themselves, but rather the “statements about these objects”. This is to be un-
derstood as follows: The objects of our consideration are “sentences” that represent
certain mathematical statements, e.g. the statement that some object A with certain
properties exists. What is considered, however, is not the object A whose existence

Introduction
this “sentence” asserts, but rather the “sentence” itself, written as a ﬁnite sequence
of letters and symbols in a formal language (assumed to possess only ﬁnitely many
letters and symbols). The usual “methods of reasoning” in logic are applied to such
“sentences”. In such an application, however, the content of the “sentences” should
not be referred to, but rather only their syntactical structure. Finally, a given set of
“sentences” (possibly intended as a set of axioms) should be counted as consistent
if no “sentences” that contradict each other (e.g. a “sentence” and its negation) can
be deduced from them by means of the above mentioned “methods of reasoning”.
If one manages, somehow, to prove the consistency of axioms that imply (among
other things) the existence of some inﬁnite totality, one has not thereby actually con-
structed this totality; rather, one has proved only that its existence can be assumed
without harm.
An essential point in this “program” of Hilbert was to declare the permissible
means by which the proof of the consistency of the given set of axioms is to be
carried out: namely, he required that only ﬁnitary reasoning be used, and such rea-
soning was to be applied to the given axioms, treated as ﬁnite strings of symbols,
and to any deductions from those axioms (which are themselves ﬁnite strings of
symbols). The proof of consistency must itself transpire via ﬁnitary means; it may
not rely upon a “realization” of the axioms, which would possibly again assume the
proof of the existence of certain inﬁnite sets that the axioms may stipulate.
In order to capture the entirety of ordinary mathematics in “Hilbert’s program”,
the following would have to be accomplished:
(1) the speciﬁcation of a (formal) language that allows us to express everything in
ordinary mathematics;
(2) the speciﬁcation of a complete system of universally valid forms of logical rea-
soning;
(3) the speciﬁcation of a complete system of mathematical axioms (assumptions);
and
(4) a proof of the consistency of the formal system given in (1)–(3).
In this program, all objects must be ﬁnitarily or at least effectively constructible,
i.e. we require:
for (1): effective constructibility of the alphabet and all syntactical concepts;
for (2): effective constructibility of the system of forms of logical reasoning;
for (3): effective constructibility of the system of mathematical axioms; and
for (4): a proof (of consistency) by “ﬁnitary methods”.
“Completeness” of the means of logical reasoning means that the addition of
further, universally valid forms of logical reasoning would not allow one to deduce
more from the given axioms than before. “Completeness” of the axioms means,
analogously, that the addition of further axioms likewise would not allow one to
deduce more than before (unless this addition causes the set of axioms to become
inconsistent). This last implies, in particular, that every sentence α (of the language

Introduction
3
speciﬁed in (1)), or its negation ¬α, is deducible from a complete axiom system.
Indeed, otherwise one could properly extend this system by the addition of α or
¬α.
If the program delineated above could actually be carried out, then a truly inge-
nious reduction of all of mathematics to “the ﬁnite” would be achieved, and thus
an unchallengeable foundation for mathematics would be guaranteed. The works of
K. G¨odel in the 1930s showed, however, that only certain parts of this program are
realizable, while others, particularly (4), cannot be realized even in principle.
Task (1) above is relatively simple to carry out. One need only recognize the fact
(which is nowadays a commonplace) that all of mathematics can be expressed in the
language of set theory. Thus, in order to realize (1), one simply uses the language of
set theory. We shall elaborate on this in Section 1.6.
Task (2) was accomplished by G¨odel. He showed the completeness of (essen-
tially) the system of logical reasoning used by Hilbert. This is the content of Chap-
ter 1 of our book.
Regarding task (3), G¨odel proved that there can be no complete (effectively enu-
merable) axiom system for the entirety of mathematics, and thus1 also not for set
theory. G¨odel’s incompleteness proof shows this even for most subﬁelds of mathe-
matics, e.g. arithmetic (the theory of the natural numbers) (the ﬁrst G¨odel incom-
pleteness theorem). This means that for each effectively enumerable system of ax-
ioms for arithmetic, there is always a sentence α (in the speciﬁed language therefor)
such that neither α nor its negation ¬α is deducible from this system. We shall go
more deeply into this in Appendix A.
Regarding task (4), G¨odel proved that under certain minimal requirements about
the formal system, its consistency cannot be proved “by means of this system”
(G¨odel’s second incompleteness theorem). Without going more precisely into it
here, let us only mention that “ﬁnitary methods”, in the usually understood sense,
can be carried out in the system of arithmetic and hence naturally in every stronger
system, including those that might comprehend the entirety of mathematics. In this
sense task (4) cannot be carried out even in principle. However, if we extend our
understanding of “ﬁnitary methods”, then task (4) can indeed be carried out in some
cases: in 1936 Gentzen carried this out for the usual Peano axiom system of arith-
metic (this system is, however, incomplete by G¨odel’s ﬁrst incompleteness theo-
rem).
Regarding our discussion of tasks (3) and (4), the interested reader may refer
to more advanced literature, such as [Barwise, 1977], [Hilbert–Bernays, 1934–68],
and [Shoenﬁeld, 1967].
Although, as was just mentioned, many ﬁelds of mathematics admit no com-
plete, effectively enumerable system of axioms, there are, here and there, ﬁelds that
do. Two such examples are the algebra of the real numbers and the algebra of the
complex numbers. The algebraic theory of the complex numbers can be completely
axiomatized by the axioms of an “algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic 0”. The
1 Here we regard the entire ﬁeld of mathematics as being a subﬁeld of set theory, as we began doing
two paragraphs above. During everyday life, however, most mathematicians take the opposite view,
that set theory is a subﬁeld of mathematics.

Introduction
completeness of this axiom system means precisely that every sentence α (in the
language of ﬁelds), or its negation ¬α, is deducible from this axiom system. Since
a sentence that is deducible via pure logic from an axiom system naturally holds in
every realization (model) of this system, it immediately follows that α holds either
in all algebraically closed ﬁelds of characteristic 0, or in none of them. This means,
in other words, that every sentence α that holds in C holds in every algebraically
closed ﬁeld of characteristic 0 (and conversely). This is a very simple form of the
so-called “Lefschetz principle”, a principle for the “transfer” of sentences from one
model to another.
Two structures A and B that cannot, as in the example given just above, be dis-
tinguished by sentences α of a given (suitable) formal language L , are called ele-
mentarily equivalent (with respect to L ). Two models of a complete axiom system
are therefore always elementarily equivalent (in the language of the axiom system).
The concept of elementary equivalence, and the methods that allow one to con-
struct structures B elementarily equivalent to a given structure A, became central
concepts and methods of a subdiscipline of mathematical logic – model theory. This
subdiscipline was, over the years, further developed and came into its own more and
more. It has its roots, however, for the most part in the controversy over Hilbert’s
program.
The discussions above should sufﬁce to highlight the central role of the concept
of formal sentences for model theory.
In Chapter 1 we shall give an introduction to formal systems, and we shall carry
out a proof of G¨odel’s theorem on the completeness of the system of logical reason-
ing given in Chapter 1. In the course of this proof we shall, at the same time, become
acquainted with the ﬁrst methods for the construction of elementarily equivalent
structures. In Chapters 2 and 3 we shall introduce further typical model theoretic
construction methods and concepts, mainly with the goal of proving (in Chapter 4)
the completeness of a series of (algebraic) axiom systems. Besides the transfer prin-
ciples obtained thereby (as indicated above), yet a further result follows from the
completeness of an (effectively enumerable) axiom system, namely – as we shall
work out in Appendix A – the decidability of the corresponding theory; i.e. it gives
the existence of an algorithm which, to each sentence α (in the language of the ax-
iom system considered), decides, in ﬁnitely many steps, whether or not α can be
deduced from the axiom system.

Chapter 1
First-Order Logic
In this chapter we introduce a calculus of logical deduction, called ﬁrst-order logic,
that makes it possible to formalize mathematical proofs. The main theorem about
this calculus that we shall prove is G¨odel’s completeness theorem (1.5.2), which
asserts that the unprovability of a sentence must be due to the existence of a coun-
terexample. From the ﬁnitary character of a formalized proof we then immediately
obtain the Finiteness Theorem (1.5.6), which is fundamental for model theory, and
which asserts that an axiom system possesses a model provided that every ﬁnite
subsystem of it possesses a model.
In (1.6) we shall axiomatize a series of mathematical (in particular, algebraic)
theories. In order to show the extent of ﬁrst-order logic, we shall also give within
this framework the Zermelo–Fraenkel axiom system for set theory, a theory that
allows us to represent all of ordinary mathematics in it.
1.1 Analysis of Mathematical Proofs
In this section we try, by means of an example, to come closer to an answer to the
question, “What is a mathematical proof?”. For the example to be considered, we
assume that we ﬁnd ourselves in an undergraduate mathematics course in which the
ﬁeld of all real numbers is being introduced axiomatically. Let us further assume
that the ﬁeld properties have already been covered and the order properties are just
now being introduced by the following axioms:
(0) ≤is a partial order;
(1) for all x,y, either x ≤y or y ≤x;
(2) for all x,y with x ≤y, we have x+z ≤y+z for all z; and
(3) if 0 ≤x and 0 ≤y, then also 0 ≤x·y.
Then we want to give a proof for the following
Claim: 0 ≤x·x for all x.

A proof of this could look something like the following:
Proof: 1. From (1) we obtain 0 ≤x or x ≤0.
2. If 0 ≤x, then (3) gives 0 ≤x·x.
3. If, however, x ≤0, then from (2) follows 0 ≤−x (where we set z = −x).
4. Now (3) again gives 0 ≤(−x)·(−x) = x·x.
5. Therefore 0 ≤x·x holds for all x.
⊓⊔
In view of this example of a proof, several remarks are now in order with regard
to an exact deﬁnition of the concept of “mathematical proof”.
Remark 1.1.1 (on the level of detail in a proof). The level of detail of a proof is as
a rule geared toward the background of those for whom the proof is intended. In
our example, this was the background of undergraduate mathematics students. For
experts, a proof at this level of detail would not be necessary – usually a proof in
such a case would consist of the single word “trivial”. For nonmathematicians, on
the other hand, the above proof might be too short, hence hard to understand. A
nonmathematician might not be able to follow it, since certain intermediate steps
that are clear to the mathematician are simply omitted, or certain conventions are
used that only mathematicians are familiar with. For example, the mathematician
writes 0 ≤(−x)·(−x) = x·x, and actually means the expression:
0 ≤(−x)·(−x) and (−x)·(−x) = x·x imply 0 ≤x·x.
It should be clear that for an exact deﬁnition of proof, we must strive for the great-
est possible fullness of detail, so that the question of whether a given sequence of
sentences is a proof is checkable by anyone who knows this deﬁnition. Moreover, it
should even be possible for a suitably programmed computer to make this determi-
nation.
Remark 1.1.2 (on the choice of a formal language). The language used to write a
proof out is, as a rule, likewise chosen according to the intended audience. In math-
ematics it is common to care less about good linguistic style, and much more about
unique readability. The example of a proof above can well be taken as typical. From
the standpoint of unique readability, however, let us attempt some improvements.
Thus, the words “also” (in Axiom 3) or “however” (in line 3 of the proof) can be
viewed as purely ornamental. They possess no additional informational content. On
the contrary, such ornamental words often cause ambiguities. In the above proof one
could also complain that sometimes a generalization “for all x” is missing from the
beginning of a sentence, and sometimes it appears at the end of such a sentence.
This especially can easily lead to ambiguities. In order to be able to give an exact
deﬁnition for the concept of proof, it is therefore indispensable to agree once and
for all upon linguistic conventions that guarantee unique readability.
Remark 1.1.3 (on the layout of a proof). Normally a proof consists of a ﬁnite se-
quence of statements. Often additional hints are given, as, for example, in line 4 of

1.1 Analysis of Mathematical Proofs
7
the above proof. An exact deﬁnition of proof should, however, make such things
superﬂuous. Such hints should serve only to promote readability, and should have
no inﬂuence on whether a given sequence of sentences is a proof or not. As to the
utilization of the given space for writing out the proof, it should also be immaterial
whether the sequence of these sentences is arranged in a series within one line, or (as
in the example above) there is only one sentence per line. For the sake of readability,
we shall stick to the latter form.
Considering the criticisms in Remark 1.1.2 above, and using symbolism that is
widespread in mathematics (which we shall make precise in the next section), we
shall now repeat the above proof. First, however, we want to “formalize” those ax-
ioms that occur in the proof:
(1) ∀xy (x ≤y ∨y ≤x)
(2) ∀xyz (x ≤y →x+z ≤y+z)
(3) ∀xy (0 ≤x ∧0 ≤y →0 ≤x·y)
Now to the claim and the proof:
Claim: ∀x 0 ≤x·x
Proof: 1.
(1) →(0 ≤x ∨x ≤0)
2.
0 ≤x ∧(3) →0 ≤x·x
3.
x ≤0 ∧(2) →0 ≤−x
4.
0 ≤−x∧(3) →0 ≤(−x)·(−x) = x·x
5.
∀x
0 ≤x·x
⊓⊔
In order to take the criticism in Remark 1.1.1 into account somewhat, we could
formulate the proof in more detail – say, as follows:
1.
(1) →(0 ≤x ∨x ≤0)
2.
0 ≤x ∧(3) →0 ≤x·x
3.
0 ≤x →0 ≤x·x
4.
x ≤0 ∧(2) →x+(−x) ≤0+(−x)
5.
x+(−x) ≤0+(−x) ∧x+(−x) = 0 →0 ≤0+(−x)
6.
0 ≤0+(−x) ∧0+(−x) = −x →0 ≤−x
7.
0 ≤−x ∧(3) →0 ≤(−x)·(−x)
8.
0 ≤(−x)·(−x) ∧(−x)·(−x) = x·x →0 ≤x·x
9.
x ≤0 →0 ≤x·x
10.
(0 ≤x ∨x ≤0) →0 ≤x·x
11.
∀x 0 ≤x·x
⊓⊔
Now we can discuss several typical characteristics of our by now already some-
what formalized proof.
A proof is a sequence of expressions, each of which either contains a universally
valid, logical fact, or follows purely logically (with the help of the axioms) from

8
1 First-Order Logic
earlier sentences in the proof. Thus, the ﬁrst line contains a universally valid fact.
Namely, it has (if we suppress the variable x for a moment) the form
∀y ϕ(y) →ϕ(0),
where ϕ(y) is an expression that, in our case, speaks about arbitrary elements y of
the real number ﬁeld. Likewise, lines 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 represent universally valid
implications. Using the axioms (1)–(3) and also the identities x + (−x) = 0, 0 +
(−x) = −x and (−x)·(−x) = x·x (which are also to be used as axioms), lines 3 and
9 result from previous statements by purely logical deductions. Thus, for example,
we obtain line 3 from the rule of inference that says: if we have already proved
(α ∧β) →γ and, in addition, β, then we have also thereby proved α →γ. In our
case, β is axiom (3), which, as an axiom, needs no proof, or, in other words, can be
assumed to have been proved. We obtain line 10 by applying to lines 3 and 9 the
rule of inference: from α →β and γ →β follows (α ∨γ) →β. From lines 1 and 10
we actually obtain, at ﬁrst, only 0 ≤x·x. However, since this has been proved for a
“ﬁxed but arbitrary” x, we deduce ∀x 0 ≤x·x. Thus, line 11 is likewise a universally
valid logical inference.
In the next two sections we want, ﬁrst, to ﬁx the linguistic framework exactly,
and, second, to give an exact deﬁnition of proof. Since we shall later have very much
to say about formulae and proofs, and must often use induction to prove metatheo-
rems about them, it behooves us to proceed very economically in our deﬁnitions of
formula and proof. Therefore, we shall not take a large number of rules of inference
as a basis, but rather try to get by with a minimum. This has a consequence that gap-
free (formal) proofs become very long. Thus the above proof, for example, would,
in gap-free form, swell to about 50 lines. However, once we give an exact deﬁnition
of proof, we shall agree to relax that deﬁnition so as to allow the use, in proofs,
of so-called “derived” rules of inference. These methods correspond exactly with
mathematical practice: in new proofs one refers back, possibly, to already known
proofs, without having to repeat them. All that is important is that all gaps could, if
necessary, be ﬁlled (at least theoretically!).
1.2 Construction of Formal Languages
For the deﬁnition of proof, it is necessary to describe the underlying formal lan-
guage more precisely; this is the goal of the present section. The objects of our
consideration will be an alphabet, and the words and statements formed therefrom.
The formal language itself therefore becomes an object of our investigation. On the
other hand, we use informal (mathematical) colloquial language (which we might
describe as “mathematical English”) to formulate everything that we establish in
this investigation of the formal language. This is necessary in order for us to com-
municate these stipulations and results to the reader. Therefore we must deal with
two languages, one being the object of our considerations (which we therefore call

1.2 Construction of Formal Languages
9
the object language, or, in other contexts, the formal language), and the other being
the language in which we talk about the object language (we call this second one
the metalanguage).
The metalanguage will always be the mathematical colloquial language, in
which, for example, we occasionally use common abbreviations (such as “iff” for
“if and only if”). In the metalanguage, we shall also use the set theoretical concep-
tual apparatus, as is usual in mathematics. And especially in the second part of this
book (the model theoretic part, Chapters 2 and 3), we shall reason in set theory.
When the considerations make it necessary, it is, however, also possible to return to
the “ﬁnitist standpoint”, in which one speaks only of ﬁnite sequences (or “strings”)
of symbols (built up from the alphabet of the object language) or of ﬁnite sequences
of such strings of symbols.
The object language will depend on the subject being considered at the time. For
example, if we want to talk about the consistency of mathematics, then we adopt
the ﬁnitist standpoint and therefore require that the alphabet of the object language
considered be ﬁnite. If, however, we adopt the model theoretic standpoint, then the
alphabet may be an arbitrary set.
Before we come to the deﬁnitions, we give yet another hint, this time about a fun-
damental difﬁculty. The issues that we pursue here are not common in mathematics.
Ordinarily one utilizes only one language: the language in which one communicates
something, such as a proof. For a mathematician, writing out a sentence is usually
tantamount to claiming that that sentence is true. Thinking about the real numbers,
for example, one might write (using the usual abbreviations)
∀x ∃y x < y,
rather than
the statement
∀x ∃y x < y
holds.
But if we want to speak about a language, then we must necessarily distinguish
between the symbol-sequence ∀x ∃y x < y and its possible meaning. This and the
next section will deal only with syntactical questions, i.e. questions such as whether
a string of symbols is correctly formed with reference to certain rules of formation.
The alphabet of the object language that we consider consists of the following
fundamental symbols:
logical symbols:
¬ (not)
∧(and)
∀(for all)
.= (equals)
variables:
v0
v1
v2
...
vn
...
(n ∈N := {0,1,2,...})
relation symbols:
Ri
(for i ∈I)
(1.2.0.1)
function symbols:
f j
(for j ∈J)
(1.2.0.2)
constant symbols:
ck
(for k ∈K)
(1.2.0.3)
punctuation:
,
)
(

10
1 First-Order Logic
Here I, J and K are arbitrary index sets, which may even be empty. If we wish to
adopt the ﬁnitist standpoint, we can generate the inﬁnitely many variables vn (n ∈N)
by means of ﬁnitely many basic symbols, say, v and ′ : then instead of the symbol
vn, we would write
v′′′′···′

n times
.
One could rewrite the relation, function and constant symbols in an analogous way,
in which case the index sets I, J, K would naturally be at most countable.
From these basic symbols we now want to construct certain strings of symbols,
which we call terms. Terms will, via a semantical interpretation given later, des-
ignate things; they are, therefore, possible names. If one keeps this in mind, the
following deﬁnition of terms becomes understandable:
(a) All variables vn and all constant symbols ck are terms.
(b) If t1,...,tμ(j) are terms, then so is f j(t1,...,tμ(j)).
(c) No other strings of symbols are terms.
Here μ is a function that, to each j ∈J, assigns the “arity” (= number of arguments)
μ(j) of the function symbol f j; thus, μ(j) ≥1.
Then Tm, the set of all terms, is the smallest set of strings of symbols that con-
tains all vn and ck and that, for each j ∈J, contains f j(t1,...,tμ(j)) whenever it
contains t1,...,tμ(j).
By convention, we may sometimes write t1 f j t2 instead of the ofﬁcial f j(t1,t2),
in case μ(j) = 2; for example, t1 +t2 instead of +(t1,t2), if + is a binary function
symbol.
Next, we construct formulae:
(a) If t1 and t2 are terms, then t1 .= t2 is a formula.
(b) If t1,...,tλ(i) are terms, then Ri(t1,...,tλ(i)) is a formula.
(c) If ϕ and ψ are formulae and v is a variable,
then ¬ϕ and (ϕ ∧ψ) and ∀vϕ are formulae.
(d) No other strings of symbols are formulae.
Here λ is a function that, to each i ∈I, assigns the “arity” λ(i) of the relation symbol
Ri; again, λ(i) ≥1.
Then Fml, the set of all formulae, is the smallest set of strings of symbols that
contains all strings of the form t1 .= t2 and Ri(t1,...,tλ(i)) (these are also called the
atomic formulae), and that contains ¬ϕ and (ϕ ∧ψ) as well as ∀vϕ whenever it
contains ϕ and ψ.
From now on, the notations
t1,t2,...
will denote terms,
ϕ,ψ,ρ,τ,α,β,γ (possibly with subscripts)
will denote formulae, and
u,v,w,x,y,z
(possibly with subscripts)
will denote variables.
We further employ the following abbreviations:

1.2 Construction of Formal Languages
11
(ϕ ∨ψ)
stands for
¬(¬ϕ ∧¬ψ)
(or)
(ϕ →ψ)
stands for
¬( ϕ ∧¬ψ)
(implies)
(1.2.0.4)
(ϕ ↔ψ)
stands for
(¬(ϕ ∧¬ψ)∧¬(ψ ∧¬ϕ)) (equivalent)
∃vϕ
stands for
¬∀v¬ϕ
(there exists)
And we adopt the following conventions, which are customary:
1. ∨and ∧bind more strongly than →and ↔;
2. ¬ binds more strongly than ∨and ∧;
3. t1 ̸= t2 stands for ¬ t1 .= t2;
(1.2.0.5)
4. t1 Ri t2 often stands for Ri(t1,t2), in case λ(i) = 2;
5. ∀u,v,w,... stands for ∀u∀v∀w ...;
6. ∃x,y,... stands for ∃x∃y ...;
7. (ϕ1 ∧ϕ2 ∧ϕ3) stands for ((ϕ1 ∧ϕ2)∧ϕ3)
(1.2.0.6)
(i.e. we group left parentheses together);
8. (ψ1 ∨ψ2 ∨ψ3 ∨ψ4) stands for (((ψ1 ∨ψ2)∨ψ3)∨ψ4); and
(1.2.0.7)
9. we drop outside parentheses when this can lead to no ambiguity.
Thus, according to these conventions, the string of symbols
∀x,y (¬ϕ ∧ψ →α ∨β ∨γ)
stands for
∀x ∀y ((¬ϕ ∧ψ) →((α ∨β)∨γ)).
Now we wish to enter into the role of variables in formulae. As an example, we
consider a formal language (object language) with a relation symbol and a constant
symbol. Thus I = {0}, J = /0 and K = {0}, say. For R0 we write < , and for c0 we
write 0, for short. Let ϕ denote the formula
∃v0 (0 < v0 ∧v0 < v1) ∧∀v0 (v0 < 0 →v0 < v1).
If we think of the usual ordering on the real numbers, then we see that the variables
v0 and v1 play different roles in ϕ. First, it makes little sense to ask whether ϕ is
true in the real numbers. This would begin to make sense only if for v1 we think of a
particular real number. Obviously ϕ is true if we think of a positive real number for
v1. Consider the case where we think of v1 as 1; then ϕ remains true if we replace
v0 by, say, v13. The “truth value” of ϕ does not change if we replace the v0s in the
ﬁrst part of the formula by v13 and the v0s in the second part by v17. This is so not
only in the case where v1 is 1, but also in every case. On the other hand, we may
not replace the two occurrences of v1 in ϕ by two distinct variables; this would alter

12
1 First-Order Logic
the “sense” of ϕ in an essential way. This distinction involving the occurrence of a
variable in a formula is captured formally by the following deﬁnitions.
In the recursive construction of a “for all” (or “universal”) formula ∀v ϕ, we refer
to the subformula ϕ as the scope (or effective range) of the “quantiﬁer” ∀v. We call
an occurrence of a variable v in a formula ψ bound if this occurrence lies within
the scope of a quantiﬁer ∀v used in the construction of ψ. Every other occurrence1
of the variable v in the formula ψ is called free. We denote by Fr(ψ) the set of
variables that possess at least one free occurrence in ψ. The following equations are
easily checked:
Fr(ψ) = {v | v occurs in ψ }, if ψ is atomic;
Fr(¬ψ) = Fr(ψ);
Fr(ϕ ∧ψ) = Fr(ϕ)∪Fr(ψ); and
Fr(∀u ϕ) = Fr(ϕ)\{u}.
The elements of Fr(ϕ) are called the free variables of ϕ.
For example, in the formula
∀v0 (v0 < 0 →v0 < v1) ∧∃v2 (0 < v2 ∧v2 < v0),
the variable v2 has only bound occurrences, the variable v1 has only free occurrences
and the variable v0 occurs both bound (in the ﬁrst half) and free (in the second half).
Note that the scope of ∀v0 is only (v0 < 0 →v0 < v1), and not everything after that
∀v0 symbol.
Later we shall need yet another syntactic operation: the replacement of a variable
v in a string of symbols ζ by a term t. Let
ζ(v/t)
(1.2.0.8)
denote the string obtained by replacing each free occurrence of v in ζ by t. If a free
occurrence of v in the formula ϕ falls within the scope of a quantiﬁer ∀u, and if
u occurs somewhere in t, then after replacement of v in ϕ by t, the variable u will
obviously fall within the scope of ∀u. If this does not happen for any variable u in t,
then t is called free for v in ϕ. In other words, t is free for v in ϕ if no free occurrence
of v in ϕ lies within the scope of a quantiﬁer ∀u used in the construction of ϕ, where
u occurs in t.
By analogy with the replacement of a variable, we deﬁne the replacement of a
constant ck in ζ by a variable v to mean that every occurrence of ck in ζ is replaced
by v. We denote the result of this replacement by
ζ(ck/v).
(1.2.0.9)
This, too, is a syntactic operation, i.e. a manipulation of strings of symbols.
1 We do not count the “occurrence” of v in ∀v as a true occurrence.

1.2 Construction of Formal Languages
13
If the formula ϕ possesses no free variables (i.e. if Fr(ϕ) = /0), then we call ϕ a
sentence. We write Sent for the set of sentences:
Sent = {ϕ ∈Fml | Fr(ϕ) = /0}.
The following syntactic operation transforms a given formula ϕ into a sentence:
letting n denote the greatest natural number such that vn occurs free in ϕ, we write
∀ϕ for the formula ∀v0,v1,...,vn ϕ, which we call the universal closure of ϕ. Ob-
viously, then, ∀ϕ is a sentence.
The concepts of our formal language that we have introduced in this section
depend upon three quantities, which we ﬁxed earlier in this section:
the “arity” function λ : I →N,
the “arity” function μ : J →N, and
(1.2.0.10)
the index set K.
The entire construction of the language depends, therefore, on the triple
L = (λ,μ,K).
(1.2.0.11)
(Observe that the index sets I and J can be recovered as the domains of deﬁnition of
λ and μ.) When we wish to emphasize this dependence on L, we write
Tm(L), Fml(L), Sent(L)
instead of
Tm, Fml, Sent.
Since all of these concepts are already determined by L, we shall often refer to L
itself as the “language.” By an extended language L′ of L we mean a triple
L′ = (λ ′,μ′,K′)
such that
1. The function λ ′ : I′ →N extends λ, i.e. I ⊆I′ and λ ′(i) = λ(i) for all i ∈I.
2. The function μ′ : J →N extends μ.
3. K ⊆K′.
The following inclusions follow immediately from the deﬁnitions:
Tm(L) ⊆Tm(L′),
Fml(L) ⊆Fml(L′),
Sent(L) ⊆Sent(L′).
Observe further that the variables are the same in both languages. We write Vbl for
the set of variables. We shall write L ⊆L′ to indicate that L′ is an extended language
of L.

14
1 First-Order Logic
In the following chapters we shall often use the following abbreviations: For a
ﬁnite conjunction
(ϕ1 ∧···∧ϕn )
we write
n
i=1
ϕi,
and for a ﬁnite disjunction
(ψ1 ∨···∨ψm)
we write
m

j=1
ψj
(1.2.0.12)
(recall (1.2.0.6) and (1.2.0.7), respectively). If a formula ϕ has the forms
n
i=1
mi

j=1
ϕij
or
n
i=1
mi

j=1
ϕij,
where each mi ≥1 and each ϕij is an atomic or a negated atomic formula, then ϕ is
said to be in conjunctive normal form or in disjunctive normal form, respectively. A
formula ϕ is in prenex normal form if ϕ is of the form
Q1x1 ···Qnxn ψ,
where each Qi is either the symbol ∀or the symbol ∃, and ψ is quantiﬁer-free.
1.3 Formal Proofs
Given a (formal) language L = (λ,μ,K), we now want to deﬁne the concept of a
(formal) proof.
Let Σ be a set of formulae: Σ ⊆Fml(L). In a proof, we shall allow the elements
of this set to appear as “axioms” so to speak. A sequence ϕ1,...,ϕn of formulae is
called a proof (or deduction) of ϕn from Σ if, for each i ∈{1,2,...,n}:
ϕi belongs to Σ,
(1.3.0.1)
or
ϕi is a logical axiom,
(1.3.0.2)
or
ϕi arises from the application of a logical rule
to members of the sequence with indices < i.
(1.3.0.3)
The last line, ϕn, is sometimes called the end-formula of the proof.
The concepts “logical axiom” and “logical rule” used in this deﬁnition must now
be made precise. We subdivide the logical axioms into three categories:
tautologies,
quantiﬁer axioms and

1.3 Formal Proofs
15
equality axioms.
As logical rules, we shall allow:
modus ponens and
the generalization rule.
We shall now deﬁne these various axioms and rules one by one.
In order to be able to deﬁne the concept of a tautology precisely, we must ﬁrst
give a brief introduction the language of sentential logic. Its alphabet consists of
→
∧
)
(
A0
A1 ... An ...
(n ∈N).
From this alphabet we construct sentential forms:
(a) A0,A1,... are sentential forms.
(b) If Φ,Ψ are sentential forms, then so are ¬Φ and (Φ ∧Ψ).
(c) No other strings of symbols are sentential forms.
The symbols A0,A1,... are called sentential variables. By a truth assignment H
of the variables A0,A1,... we mean a function from the set {A0,A1,...} to the set
{T,F} of truth values T (= true) and F (= false). Thus, for every n ∈N, either
H (An) = T or H (An) = F. This truth assignment extends canonically from the set
of variables to the set of all sentential forms, as follows:
H (¬Φ) = −H (Φ)
(1.3.0.4)
H (Φ ∧Ψ) = H (Φ)∩H (Ψ).
(1.3.0.5)
Here −and ∩are operations deﬁned on the set {T,F} by the following tables:
−
T F
F T
∩
T F
T
T F
F
F F
A sentential form Φ is called a tautological form if Φ receives the value T for every
truth assignment H . If the sentential form Φ contains exactly n distinct sentential
variables, then for a proof that Φ is a tautological form, there are exactly 2n cases to
consider: for each variable there are just the two values T and F to “plug in”. This
calculation can be carried out in general according to the schema of the following
example. We test the sentential form
¬((A0 ∧A1)∧¬A0)
(1.3.0.6)
by means of the following table:

16
1 First-Order Logic
A0
A1
(A0 ∧A1)
¬A0
(A0 ∧A1)∧¬A0
¬((A0 ∧A1)∧¬A0)

Here the ﬁrst line says that for each truth assignment H with H (A0) = H (A1) =
T, the above sentential form receives the value T. The subsequent lines are to be read
similarly. Since the last column has all Ts (and no Fs), we conclude that (1.3.0.6)
is, indeed, a tautological form.
Returning to our formal language L, an instance of a tautological form, or simply
a tautology, is the formula obtained from a tautological form Φ by simply replacing
each sentential variable in Φ by a formula of L. It should go without saying that
different occurrences of the same sentential variable in Φ must be replaced by the
same formula. Thus, if ϕ,ψ ∈Fml(L), then the formula
¬((ϕ ∧ψ)∧¬ϕ)
is an example of a tautology (in view of (1.3.0.6)), and hence of a logical axiom. If
we still employ the abbreviations introduced in Section 1.2 (speciﬁcally, (1.2.0.1)),
then this axiom takes the form
(ϕ ∧ψ) →ϕ.
It is advisable to utilize such abbreviations whenever one has to check for a tauto-
logical form. The following table follows from the deﬁnitions:
ϕ
ψ
(ϕ ∨ψ)
(ϕ →ψ)
(ϕ ↔ψ)
T
T
T
T
T
T
F
T
F
F

T
T

With the help of this table, the calculations needed to test for tautological forms are
shortened considerably. Another reason to employ such abbreviations is that they
enable mathematicians (who are already familiar with most tautologies) to see them
in their well-known form.
Next, the quantiﬁer axioms are:
(A1)
∀xϕ →ϕ(x/t), in case t is free for x in ϕ
(1.3.0.7)
(A2)
∀x(ϕ →ψ) →(ϕ →∀xψ), in case x /∈Fr(ϕ)
(1.3.0.8)
Here ϕ and ψ are formulae, x is any variable and t is any term. Actually, (A1) and
(A2) each represent inﬁnitely many axioms (just as each tautological form gives rise
to inﬁnitely many tautologies).
Next, the equality axioms are:

1.3 Formal Proofs
17
(I1)
x .= x
(I2)
x .= y →(x .= z →y .= z)
(I3)
x .= y →(Ri(v,...,x,...,u) →Ri(v,...,y,...,u))
(1.3.0.9)
(I4)
x .= y →f j(v,...,x,...,u) .= f j(v,...,y,...,u)
Note that (I3) and (I4) are actually families of axioms, one for each i ∈I and j ∈J,
respectively. The arity of Ri is λ(i), and that of f j is μ(j) (recall p. 10). In (I3) and
(I4), x (which is an arbitrary variable) may be the variable in any position (even the
ﬁrst or last) in the list of variables of Ri or f j, respectively; the variables in the other
positions remain unchanged when x gets replaced by y.
Having thus completed our description of the logical axioms, we now describe
the logical rules. First, modus ponens is a logical rule that can be applied to two
lines of a proof in the event that one of those two lines has the form ϕ →ψ and the
other has the form ϕ, where ϕ,ψ ∈Fml(L). The result of the application is then the
formula ψ. We display this rule in the following form:
ϕ →ψ
ϕ
ψ
(MP)
The line ϕi of a proof ϕ1,...,ϕn arises from application of modus ponens in case
there are indices j1, j2 < i such that ϕj1 has the form ϕj2 →ϕi.
The generalization rule allows us to pass from a line of the form ϕ to a line
∀xϕ, where x is an arbitrary variable. The line ϕi of a proof ϕ1,...,ϕn arises from
application of the generalization rule in case there is an index j < i such that ϕi has
the form ∀xϕj. We display this rule in the following form:
ϕ
∀xϕ
(∀)
Here, ﬁnally, the deﬁnition of a formal proof (from an axiom system Σ) is con-
cluded. To elucidate this concept, we give a series of examples. The ﬁrst examples
all have the form of derived rules (with a single premise); that is, given a proof with
a certain end-formula, these rules show how one could, independent of how the end-
formula was obtained, append additional lines to the proof so as to obtain a proof of
a certain new line.
First we prove the following derived rule:
ϕ ∧ψ
ϕ
(∧B1)
Assume we have a proof of (ϕ ∧ψ) (from some set Σ); let this proof be, say,

18
1 First-Order Logic
ϕ1
...
ϕn−1
(ϕ ∧ψ)
;
then we extend this proof in the following manner:
ϕ1
...
ϕn−1
(ϕ ∧ψ)
(ϕ ∧ψ) →ϕ
(1.3.0.10)
ϕ
(1.3.0.11)
(1.3.0.10) above is an instance of a tautological form. (1.3.0.11) arises from its two
predecessors via an application of modus ponens.
By the same argumentation one obtains, in succession, the following derived
rules:
(ϕ ∧ψ)
ψ
(∧B2)
from the tautology
(ϕ ∧ψ) →ψ
ϕ
(ϕ ∨ψ)
(∨B1)
from the tautology
ϕ →(ϕ ∨ψ)
ψ
(ϕ ∨ψ)
(∨B2)
from the tautology
ψ →(ϕ ∨ψ)
ϕ →ψ
¬ψ →¬ϕ
(CP)
from the tautology
(ϕ →ψ) →(¬ψ →¬ϕ)
ϕ ↔ψ
ϕ →ψ
(↔B1)

The last two derived rules above are obtained using the logical axioms (A1) and
(A2), respectively, in just the same way that we obtained (∧B1)
The following derived rules each have two premises; i.e. we assume that we have
already proved two lines – the premises. First we consider the important rule of
“chain implication”:

1.3 Formal Proofs
19
ϕ →ψ
ψ →σ
ϕ →σ
(KS)
This derived rule can be established as follows.
Suppose
ϕ1
...
ϕn−1
(ϕ →ψ)
and
ψ1
–––
ψm−1
(ψ →σ)
are proofs (say, from Σ1 and Σ2, respectively). Then we obtain the following proof
(from Σ1 ∪Σ2):
ϕ1
...
ϕn−1
(ϕ →ψ)
(1.3.0.12)
ψ1
–––
ψm−1
(ψ →σ)
(1.3.0.13)
(ϕ →ψ) →((ψ →σ)→(ϕ →σ))
(1.3.0.14)
(ψ →σ) →(ϕ →σ)
(1.3.0.15)
(ϕ →σ)
(1.3.0.16)
Here (1.3.0.14) is a tautology, (1.3.0.15) is obtained by applying modus ponens to
(1.3.0.12) and (1.3.0.14), and (1.3.0.16) is obtained by applying modus ponens to
(1.3.0.13) and (1.3.0.15).
In a similar way one obtains the following derived rules (each with two premises):
ϕ →ψ
ψ →ϕ
ϕ ↔ψ
(↔)
from the tautology
(ϕ →ψ) →((ψ →ϕ) →(ϕ ↔ψ))
ϕ

(ϕ ∧ψ)
(∧)
from the tautology
ϕ →(ψ →(ϕ ∧ψ))
ϕ →σ
ψ →σ
(ϕ ∨ψ) →σ
(∨)
from the tautology
(ϕ →σ) →((ψ →σ) →((ϕ ∨ψ) →σ))

One could extend the list of derived rules arbitrarily. In fact, this is the method
to make proofs more “bearable”. Again and again, arguments crop up that one does
not want to repeat every time; rather, one incorporates them gradually into the log-
ical system (as derived rules). The more advanced a mathematician is, the more he
masters such rules, and the shorter his proofs become.
Before we give a formal proof of our example in Section 1.1, we wish to state,
ﬁnally, the following derived rules:
t1 .= t2
t2 .= t1
(S)
t1 .= t2
t2 .= t3
t1 .= t3
(Tr)
(1.3.0.17)
t′ .= t′′
Ri(t1,...,t′,...,tλ(i)) →Ri(t1,...,t′′,...,tλ(i))
(Ri)
(1.3.0.18)
t′ .= t′′
f j(t1,...,t′,...,tμ(j)) .= f j(t1,...,t′′,...,tμ(j))
(fj)
We leave the proofs of (S), (Tr) and (fj) to the reader; we now present that of (Ri).
We shall carry out the replacement of t′ by t′′ in the ﬁrst argument of Ri. It will be
clear that we shall be able to carry out the replacement of every arbitrary argument
of Ri by the same method. Thus we assume that we are given a proof of t′ .= t′′:
...
t′ .= t′′
(1.3.0.19)
We extend this proof by the following lines, where we choose the variables x,y,u2,
...,uλ(i) so that they do not appear in any of the terms t′,t′′,t2,...,tλ(i):
x .= y →(Ri(x,u2,u3,...) →Ri( y ,u2,u3,...))
(1.3.0.20)
∀x(x .= y →(Ri(x,u2,u3,...) →Ri( y ,u2,u3,...)))
t′ .= y →(Ri(t′,u2,u3,...) →Ri( y ,u2,u3,...))
∀y(t′ .= y →(Ri(t′,u2,u3,...) →Ri( y ,u2,u3,...)))
t′ .= t′′ →(Ri(t′,u2,u3,...) →Ri(t′′,u2,u3,...))
∀u2 (t′ .= t′′ →(Ri(t′,u2,u3,...) →Ri(t′′,u2,u3,...)))
t′ .= t′′ →(Ri(t′, t2 ,u3,...) →Ri(t′′, t2 ,u3,...))
...
...
...
t′ .= t′′ →(Ri(t′, t2 , t3 ,...) →Ri(t′′, t2 , t3 ,...))
(1.3.0.21)
Ri(t′, t2 , t3 ,...) →Ri(t′′, t2 , t3 ,...)
(1.3.0.22)

1.3 Formal Proofs
21
Here (1.3.0.20) is an equality axiom (I3) (1.3.0.9). Thereafter we alternatingly used
the rules (∀) and (∀B), until (1.3.0.21). We applied modus ponens to this line and
(1.3.0.19) to obtain (1.3.0.22).
Now we want to give a formal proof of ∀x 0 ≤x ·x from the axiom system Σ =
{(1),...,(5)}:
(1)
∀x,y
(x ≤y ∨y ≤x)
(2)
∀x,y,z(x ≤y →x+z ≤y+z)
(3)
∀x,y
(0 ≤x ∧0 ≤y →0 ≤x·y)
(4)
∀x,y
(x+(−x) .= 0 ∧0+y .= y)
(5)
∀x
(−x)·(−x) .= x·x
These axioms are sentences of a language L whose symbols are speciﬁed as follows:
The index set I contains only one element (say, I = {0}), and λ(0) = 2; i.e. R0
is a binary relation symbol. For the sake of readability we write ≤for R0. Here one
thinks instinctively of the “less-than-or-equal-to” relation between real numbers,
which brings with it the temptation to reason semantically. As agreed, however, we
wanted to give a purely formal proof whose correctness could be checked even by a
computer.
We want to retain for the function symbols the suggestive notation that we have
begun to use for the relation symbol. Here J has three elements, say, J = {0,1,2},
and μ(0) = 1, μ(1) = μ(2) = 2. For f0, f1, f2 we write −,+,·, respectively. Fur-
thermore, we make use of the convention that x + y is written for the term +(x,y).
Without these agreements, Axiom (2) would take the following form:
(2)
∀x,y,z(R0(x,y) →R0(f1(x,z), f1(y,z))).
The index set K is again a singleton – say, K = {7}. For c7 we write 0, for short.
When we now ﬁnally give a formal proof of ∀x 0 ≤x·x from Σ, we shall number
the lines, and at the end of each line point out how it arose. Thus, for example,
“(MP 3, 29)” in line 30 indicates that this line came about via an application of
modus ponens to lines 3 and 29.

We have thus, ﬁnally, transformed the proof given in the usual mathematical
style in Section 1.2, into a formal proof. That this transformation has substantially
increased the length of the proof is, as already explicitly mentioned earlier, due to
the fact that we have presented derived rules only to a limited extent. Our ambition
now, however, is not to gain further familiarity with formal proofs or to simplify
them step by step until they are, ﬁnally, practicable. We want to leave this example
as it is. Instead, we now occupy ourselves with the “reach” of such proofs. This will
lead us to make claims in our metalanguage about formal proofs, which we then
have to prove. The proofs will be carried out in the usual, informal mathematical
style. In this section we wish to prove only a couple of small claims and the so-
called deduction theorem.
First another deﬁnition. Let ϕ be an L-formula and Σ a set of L-formulae. Then
we say that ϕ is provable (or derivable) from Σ, and write
Σ ⊢ϕ,
if there is a proof ϕ1,...,ϕn from Σ whose last formula ϕn is identical with ϕ.
It is clear that if Σ ⊢ϕ holds, then for every set Σ′ of formulae with Σ ⊆Σ′,
Σ ′ ⊢ϕ also holds. In the following claims and their proofs, we become acquainted
with further properties of the metalinguistic relation ⊢.
Lemma 1.3.1. Let ϕ,ψ ∈Fml(L), Σ ⊆Fml(L) and x ∈Vbl. Then the following
hold:

1.3 Formal Proofs
23
(a) Σ ⊢ϕ if and only if Σ ⊢∀xϕ
(b) Σ ∪{ψ} ⊢ϕ if and only if Σ ∪{∀xψ} ⊢ϕ.
Proof: (a) One reasons from left to right, thusly:
If
...
ϕ
is a proof from Σ, then so is
...
ϕ
∀xϕ
.
From right to left we use (∀B):
If
...
∀xϕ
is a proof from Σ, then so is
...
∀xϕ
ϕ
.
Observe here that ϕ(x/x) is identical with ϕ, and that (∀B) may be used, since x is
naturally free for x in φ.
(b) One reasons from left to right, thusly:
If
...
ψ
–––
ϕ
is a proof from Σ ∪{ψ}, then
...
∀xψ
ψ
–––
ϕ
is a proof from Σ ∪{∀xψ}.
Here the rule (∀B) is again used. The reasoning from right to left goes as follows:
If
...
∀xψ
–––
ϕ
is a proof from Σ ∪{∀xψ}, then
...
ψ
∀xψ
–––
ϕ
is a proof from Σ ∪{ψ}.
⊓⊔
By repeated use of Lemma 1.3.1(a), we see that the derivability of a formula ϕ
from Σ is equivalent to the derivability of its universal closure ∀ϕ (p. 13) from Σ.
Similarly, repeated use of Lemma 1.3.1(b) permits us to replace all formulae in Σ
by their universal closures. On the basis of this, we shall often, in the future, limit
ourselves to the case where Σ is a set of sentences, and ϕ is a sentence.
Now, however, again let ϕ,ψ ∈Fml(L) and Σ ⊆Fml(L). If
Σ ⊢(ϕ →ψ)
holds, then one obtains immediately via (MP):

24
1 First-Order Logic
Σ ∪{ϕ} ⊢ψ.
Indeed, if
...
ϕ →ψ
is a proof from Σ, then
...
ϕ →ψ
ϕ
ψ
is a proof from Σ ∪{ϕ}. Here it is immaterial whether ϕ contains free variables
or not. If, however, one knows that Fr(ϕ) = /0, then the above implication can be
reversed. We have the following theorem, which is very important for applications:
Theorem 1.3.2 (Deduction Theorem). Let Σ ⊆Fml(L), ϕ,ψ ∈Fml(L) and Fr(ϕ) =
/0. Then from Σ ∪{ϕ} ⊢ψ we obtain Σ ⊢(ϕ →ψ).
Proof: We shall show, by induction on n:
if
ϕ1
...
ϕn
is a proof from Σ ∪{ϕ}, then the sequence of formulae
ϕ →ϕ1
...
ϕ →ϕn
can be completed so as to become a proof from Σ whose last line remains ϕ →ϕn.
It is clear that the claim of the Deduction Theorem will follow from this.
Induction basis step: Since n = 1, we are given a one-line proof from Σ, consist-
ing of the line ϕ1.
Case 1: ϕ1 is a logical axiom or a member of Σ. In this case,
ϕ1
ϕ1 →(ϕ →ϕ1)
ϕ →ϕ1
is clearly a proof from Σ. Here we obtained the last line from ϕ1 and the tautology
ϕ1 →(ϕ →ϕ1) via (MP).
Case 2: ϕ1 is identical with ϕ. In this case the implication ϕ →ϕ1 is a tautology,
and hence in particular a proof from Σ.
Step from n to n+1: Assume that
ϕ1
...
ϕn
is a proof from Σ ∪{ϕ}, and the sequence of formulae
ϕ →ϕ1
...
ϕ →ϕn
has already been completed to a proof from Σ, with end-formula ϕ →ϕn.

1.4 Completeness of First-Order Logic
25
Case 1: ϕn+1 is a logical axiom or a member of Σ. In this case we extend the
right-hand proof with the lines
ϕn+1
ϕn+1 →(ϕ →ϕn+1)
ϕ →ϕn+1,
and again obtain a proof from Σ.
Case 2: ϕn+1 is identical with ϕ. In this case we simply add the tautology ϕ →
ϕn+1 as the last line.
Case 3: ϕn+1 is obtained by (MP). In this case there are i, j ≤n such that the
formula ϕj has the form ϕi →ϕn+1. But then the lines ϕ →ϕi and ϕ →(ϕi →ϕn+1)
occur in the right-hand proof. We extend the right-hand proof with the following
lines:
(ϕ →(ϕi →ϕn+1)) →(ϕ →ϕi) →(ϕ →ϕn+1))
(1.3.2.1)
(ϕ →ϕi) →(ϕ →ϕn+1)
(1.3.2.2)
ϕ →ϕn+1.
(1.3.2.3)
Here (1.3.2.1) is a tautology, and (1.3.2.2) and (1.3.2.3) are obtained via applications
of (MP).
Case 4: ϕn+1 is obtained via (∀). In this last case there exists i ≤n such that ϕn+1
has the form ∀xϕi, where x is a variable. If we extend the right-hand proof with the
lines ∀x(ϕ →ϕi) and ϕ →ϕn+1 (in that order), then we shall again obtain a proof
of ϕ →ϕn+1 from Σ, since these two new lines are justiﬁed by the rule (∀) and the
derived rule (K ∀), respectively. This application of (K ∀) is correct, since obviously
x /∈Fr(ϕ) (by the hypothesis that Fr(ϕ) = /0) and ϕn+1 is ∀xϕi.
⊓⊔
1.4 Completeness of First-Order Logic
The preceding sections have shown that it is possible to give a strict, formal deﬁ-
nition of the concept of a mathematical proof. It remains to clarify the question of
whether this deﬁnition really captures what one ordinarily understands by a proof.
The unwieldiness that came to light in our earlier example (proving 0 ≤x · x from
the axioms for ordered ﬁelds) can, in principle, be eliminated by the introduction
of more and more derived rules. Thus, this unwieldiness is no genuine argument
against our formal system. A further possible objection could be that the formal
languages we use have inadequate expressive power. But this objection can also be
refuted: in Section 1.6 we shall formalize set theory in such a language. Set theory
has enough expressive power to express every reasonable mathematical concept.
A completely different objection could be brought against the strength of such
formal proofs. It is conceivable that the deﬁnition of proof that we gave in the previ-
ous section overlooks some valid form of logical reasoning. We wish to show now

26
1 First-Order Logic
that this is not the case – i.e. that our concept of proof completely comprehends all
valid forms of logical reasoning. A heuristic reﬂection should elucidate this claim.
Let Σ ⊆Sent(L) and ϕ ∈Sent(L). We ask:
How might it happen that ϕ is not provable from Σ – i.e. Σ ̸⊢ϕ?
(1.4.0.1)
One possibility could be that there is a “counterexample”. This should mean that a
domain (a mathematical structure – cf. Section 1.5) could exist in which all axioms
σ ∈Σ hold, but not ϕ. Here we implicitly assume that formal proofs are sound, i.e.
that everything that is provable holds wherever the axioms hold. (In Section 1.5 we
shall make this precise and prove it.) Another possible reason for the unprovability
of ϕ from Σ could be that we forgot some method of reasoning when we deﬁned
“proof”, in which case ϕ could be unprovable even though there is no “counterex-
ample”. We shall show that this second case cannot arise:
Any unprovability rests necessarily on a counterexample.
(1.4.0.2)
We shall prove this claim in Theorem 1.5.2 (G¨odel’s Completeness Theorem) in
the next section, but we shall need several technical preparations, which we would
like to carry out in this section. Although we postpone to the next section a precise
description of the concept of a structure, and of the deﬁnition of the satisfaction of
a formula in such a structure, the “counterexample” that we shall construct from the
assumption that Σ ̸⊢ϕ will take on a clear form already by the end of this section.
First we would like to undertake a small reformulation of the hypothesis. For this
we call a set Σ ⊆Sent(L) consistent if there is no L-sentence α for which both
Σ ⊢α
and
Σ ⊢¬α
hold simultaneously. If there is such an α, then Σ is called inconsistent. Then obvi-
ously:
Σ is inconsistent if and only if one can prove every sentence β from Σ. (1.4.0.3)
Indeed, if Σ is inconsistent, then there is a proof of (α ∧¬α) from Σ, by rule (∧).
We extend this proof by the lines
(α ∧¬α) →β
(1.4.0.4)
β.
(1.4.0.5)
Here (1.4.0.4) is a tautology, and (1.4.0.5) is obtained with (MP). Using (1.4.0.3)
we now show:
Lemma 1.4.1. Let Σ ⊆Sent(L) and ϕ ∈Sent(L). Then Σ ̸⊢ϕ if and only if Σ ∪{¬ϕ}
is consistent.
Proof: We show that Σ ⊢ϕ is equivalent to Σ ∪{¬ϕ} being inconsistent. First
suppose Σ ⊢ϕ. Then Σ ∪{¬ϕ} ⊢ϕ on the one hand, and in any case Σ ∪{¬ϕ} ⊢¬ϕ
on the other, whence Σ ∪{¬ϕ} is inconsistent.

1.4 Completeness of First-Order Logic
27
Now suppose Σ ∪{¬ϕ} is inconsistent. Then Σ ∪{¬ϕ} ⊢ϕ, by (1.4.0.3). Using
the Deduction Theorem (1.3.2) we obtain
Σ ⊢(¬ϕ →ϕ).
We take some particular proof of (¬ϕ →ϕ) from Σ, and extend it with the lines
(¬ϕ →ϕ) →ϕ
(1.4.1.1)
ϕ.
(1.4.1.2)
Here (1.4.1.1) is a tautology, and (1.4.1.2) is obtained via (MP). Thus Σ ⊢ϕ holds.
⊓⊔
Our assumption Σ ̸⊢ϕ is therefore equivalent to the consistency of the set Σ ∪
{¬ϕ} of sentences. On the other hand, a “counterexample” to Σ ⊢ϕ is exactly a
domain in which all σ ∈Σ ∪{¬ϕ} hold. (If ϕ does not hold, then obviously ¬ϕ
holds.) In order to produce the “completeness proof” of (1.4.0.2) that we seek, it
therefore clearly sufﬁces to do the following:
to construct, for any consistent set2 Σ of sentences,
a domain in which all σ ∈Σ hold.
(1.4.1.3)
This is what we would like to do now. For this, we shall pursue the following strat-
egy. By means of a systematic, consistent expansion of the set Σ, we wish to deter-
mine the desired domain as far as possible. The steps toward this goal are of a rather
technical nature and will be completely motivated and clear only later.
In the ﬁrst step of (1.4.1.3) (which is also the most difﬁcult), we wish to arrive
at a stage in which, whenever an existence sentence holds in the domain to be con-
structed, this can be veriﬁed by an example. One such example should be capable
of being named by a constant symbol ck in our language. To achieve this, we shall
be forced to extend the given language L by the addition of new constant symbols.
We prove the following:
Theorem 1.4.2. Let Σ ⊆Sent(L) be consistent. Then there is a language L′ ⊇L with
I′ = I and J′ = J, and there is a consistent set Σ ′ ⊆Sent(L′) with Σ ⊆Σ′, such that
to each L′-existence sentence3 ∃xϕ, there exists a k ∈K′ such that
(∃xϕ →ϕ(x/ck)) is a member of Σ′.
For the proof of this theorem we need the following:
Lemma 1.4.3. Let L(1) ⊆L(2) be two languages with I(1) = I(2), J(1) = J(2) and
K(2) = K(1) ∪{0}, where 0 /∈K(1). Further, let ϕ1,...,ϕn be a proof in L(2) from
Σ := {ϕ1,...,ϕm}, with m ≤n. Then, if y is a variable not occurring in any ϕi (1 ≤
i ≤n), then ϕ1(c0/y),...,ϕn(c0/y) is a proof in L(1) from {ϕ1(c0/y),...,ϕm(c0/y)}.
2 Previously Σ ∪{¬ϕ}.
3 Note that this notion differs from that of an “∃-sentence” introduced in Theorem 2.5.4.

28
1 First-Order Logic
Proof (of Lemma 1.4.3):
We apply induction on the length n of the given formal
proof.
Basis step: If, in the case n = 1, also m = 1, then there is nothing to show. If,
on the other hand, m = 0 (i.e. Σ = /0), then ϕn must be a logical axiom. In the case
of an equality axiom, there is again nothing to show, since such an axiom contains
no constant symbols. If ϕn is an instance of a tautological form, then ϕn(c0/y) is,
likewise, clearly an instance of the same tautological form. There remains the case
where ϕn is a quantiﬁer axiom. So let ϕn be of the form (A1) (1.3.0.7):
∀xψ →ψ(x/t),
where t is a term free for x in ψ. Now one can easily convince oneself that:
ψ(x/t)(c0/y)
is just
ψ(c0/y)(x/t(c0/y)).
Since y does not occur in ϕn by hypothesis, t(c0/y) is free for x in ψ(c0/y). There-
fore ϕn(c0/y) takes the form of an axiom (A1), namely,
∀xψ(c0/y) →ψ(c0/y)(x/t(c0/y)).
If φn has the form of (A2) (1.3.0.8), one may convince oneself just as easily that
ϕn(c0/y) is again an axiom of type (A2).
Step from n−1 to n: Already we know that ϕ1(c0/y),...,ϕn−1(c0/y) is a proof in
L(1) from ϕ1(c0/y),...,ϕm(c0/y), where we can assume, without loss of generality,
that m ≤n −1. Now if ϕn is a logical axiom, then, as we saw above, ϕn(c0/y) is
again a logical axiom. Two cases remain, in which ϕn is obtained by a rule.
Case 1: ϕn is obtained by (MP). In this case there are i, j ≤n−1 such that ϕj has
the form (ϕi →ϕn). Then ϕj(c0/y) has the form ϕi(c0/y) →ϕn(c0/y). Therefore
ϕn(c0/y) is likewise obtained by (MP).
Case 2: ϕn is obtained via (∀). In this case there is an i ≤n −1 such that ϕn
has the form ∀xϕi. Then ϕn(c0/y) has the form ∀xϕi(c0/y). Therefore ϕn(c0/y) is
likewise obtained via (∀).
We observe, ﬁnally, that for every L(2)-formula ψ, the replacement of c0 by a
variable leads to an L(1)-formula. Thus it is clear that the resulting proof is in L(1).
⊓⊔
Proof (Theorem 1.4.2): We shall obtain the language L′ and the set Σ′ of sentences
by a countable process. For each n ∈N, we recursively construct a language Ln in
the following way: let L0 be the language L. For n ≥1, if Ln−1 has already been
constructed, then we obtain Ln by setting In = In−1, Jn = Jn−1 and Kn = Kn−1 ∪Mn.
Here Mn is a set disjoint from Kn−1 such that there is a bijection
gn : Mn →{∃xϕ | ∃xϕ is a member of Sent(Ln−1)}
(1.4.3.1)
from Mn to the set of all existence sentences in the language Ln−1. This means
nothing more than that we “enumerate” all existence sentences in Ln−1 with new

1.4 Completeness of First-Order Logic
29
indices in a one-to-one and onto manner. Sets Mn and bijections gn of the required
kind always exist.
We thereby obtain an ascending chain
L0 ⊆L1 ⊆··· ⊆Ln−1 ⊆Ln ⊆···
(1.4.3.2)
of languages. Finally we set L′ = 
n∈N Ln, i.e. we set I′ = I, J′ = J and K′ =

n∈N Kn. From this one sees immediately that
Sent(L′) =
	
n∈N
Sent(Ln)
also holds. Therefore if ∃xϕ is an L′-sentence, then it lies already in a set Sent(Ln−1)
for some n ∈N.
Suppose
Σ = Σ0 ⊆Σ1 ⊆··· ⊆Σn−1 ⊆Σn ⊆···
(1.4.3.3)
is an ascending chain of sets such that for each n ∈N:
(1) Σn ⊆Sent(Ln), and
(2) for each k ∈Mn, (∃xϕ →ϕ(x/ck)) is a member of Σn,
(1.4.3.4)
where ∃xϕ is gn(k). Once we have such a chain, we shall be able to take Σ′ to be

n∈N Σn. Then it will remain only to check that Σ′ is consistent.
We obtain a chain (1.4.3.3) with satisfying (1.4.3.4) by setting
Σn := Σn−1 ∪{(∃xϕ →ϕ(x/ck)) | k ∈Mn, gn(k) is ∃xϕ }.
(1.4.3.5)
Since gn is surjective, each existence sentence ∃xϕ in Sent(Ln−1) gets counted in
(1.4.3.5) – ∃xϕ is, say, gn(k). Since Fr(ϕ) ⊆{x}, ϕ(x/ck) is again a sentence (but
now in Ln, not Ln−1). Therefore Σn ⊆Sent(Ln). The most important property of Σn
is now its consistency. This results by induction on n.
For n = 0, the consistency of Σ0 is the hypothesis. For n ≥1, suppose that Σn−1
is consistent, but not Σn. Then we would obtain an α in Sent(Ln) with
Σn ⊢(α ∧¬α).
Since any single proof from Σn can be traced back to only ﬁnitely many axioms of
Σn, (α ∧¬α) would already be provable from Σn−1, together with ﬁnitely many
sentences
(∃x1 ϕ1 →ϕ1(x1/ck1)), ..., (∃xr ϕr →ϕr(xr/ckr)),
(1.4.3.6)
where gn(ki) is ∃xi ϕi, which is a member of Sent(Ln−1) for 1 ≤i ≤r. We brieﬂy
write σ1,...,σr for the r sentences in (1.4.3.6). Then we have
Σn−1 ∪{σ1,...,σr} ⊢(α ∧¬α).

30
1 First-Order Logic
By means of a possible (still ﬁnite) expansion of the set {σ1,...,σr} we can ensure,
in addition, that there is a proof of (α ∧¬α) already in the sublanguage L(2) of Ln
deﬁned by
I(2) = In,
J(2) = Jn,
and
K(2) = Kn−1 ∪{g−1
n (∃x1 ϕ1),...,g−1
n (∃xr ϕr)}.
Note that r ≥1, since otherwise Σn−1 would be inconsistent. Thus, by the Deduction
Theorem 1.3.2, we obtain
Σn−1 ∪{σ2,...,σr} ⊢(σ1 →(α ∧¬α)),
and, by use of the tautology
((β →γ) →(α ∧¬α)) →(β ∧¬γ)
and (MP) it follows, ﬁnally, that
Σn−1 ∪{σ2,...,σr} ⊢(∃x1 ϕ1 ∧¬ϕ1(x1/ck1)).
If one bears in mind that ∃x1 is an abbreviation for ¬∀x1¬, then we obtain via
(∧B1), on the one hand,
Σn−1 ∪{σ2,...,σr} ⊢¬∀x1 ¬ϕ1,
(1.4.3.7)
and, via (∧B2) on the other hand,
Σn−1 ∪{σ2,...,σr} ⊢¬ϕ1(x1/ck1).
(1.4.3.8)
The provabilities asserted in (1.4.3.7) and (1.4.3.8) are meant in the language L(2).
If we now deﬁne L(1) by
I(1) = In,
J(1) = Jn,
and
K(1) = Kn−1 ∪{g−1
n (∃x2 ϕ2),...,g−1
n (∃xr ϕr)},
then we recognize that ¬∀x1 ¬ϕ1 as well as the set of sentences
Π := Σn−1 ∪{σ2,...,σr}
already lie in Sent

L(1)
. Applying (a suitable version of) Lemma 1.4.3 to the proofs
whose existence is asserted by (1.4.3.7) and (1.4.3.8), we obtain, on the one hand, a
deduction
Π ⊢¬∀x1 ¬ϕ1
in L(1), and, on the other hand, a deduction

1.4 Completeness of First-Order Logic
31
Π ⊢¬ϕ1(x1/ck1)(ck1/y)
likewise in L(1). Here y is a suitably chosen “new” variable (i.e. a variable not oc-
curring in the proof of ¬ϕ1(x1/ck1) or in the proof of ¬∀x1 ¬ϕ1 from Π, to which
we applied Lemma 1.4.3). Now it is obvious that
ϕ1(x1/ck1)(ck1/y) is ϕ1(x1/y),
since ϕ1 is a member of Fml(Ln−1). We therefore have
Π ⊢¬ϕ1(x1/y).
Via an application of (∀) on y and (∀B) we obtain, ﬁrst,
Π ⊢∀y¬ϕ1(x1/y)
and then
Π ⊢¬ϕ1(x1/y)(y/x1).
If one considers that y is new for ϕ1, then one understands immediately that
ϕ1(x1/y)(y/x1) is ϕ1.
Thus we have Π ⊢¬ϕ1 and thus we ﬁnally obtain
Π ⊢∀x1 ¬ϕ1.
This derivability, together with the derivability
Π ⊢¬∀x1 ¬ϕ1
shows that Π is inconsistent in L(1).
Just as we have reduced the inconsistency of Σn−1∪{σ1,...,σr} to that of Σn−1∪
{σ2,...,σr}, we can, through iteration, ﬁnally deduce a contradiction already in
Σn−1. Since this contradicts our hypothesis, the consistency of Σn follows. In this
way, all the Σn are recognized as consistent.
Now the consistency of Σ′ = 
n∈N Σn is seen as follows: since the proof of a
contradiction from Σ ′ is a ﬁnite sequence of formulae, and both the languages Ln as
well as the sets Σn form ascending chains, there is an n ∈N such that this proof is
already a proof from Σn in the language Ln. This is, however, impossible, because
of the previously proved consistency of Σn.
⊓⊔

32
1 First-Order Logic
We shall carry out the second step in determining a domain in which all sentences
in our consistent set Σ will hold (1.4.1.3), in the extension language L′ constructed
just above. For this we shall apply the following theorem, which we formulate for
an arbitrary language (again denoted by L).
Theorem 1.4.4. To each consistent set Σ ⊆Sent(L) there is a maximal consistent
extension Σ ∗⊆Sent(L) of Σ; this means that Σ ⊆Σ∗, Σ∗is consistent, and when-
ever Σ ∗⊆Σ1 ⊆Sent(L) and Σ1 is consistent, Σ ∗= Σ1.
Proof: We consider the system
M = {Σ1 ⊆Sent(L) | Σ ⊆Σ1, Σ1 consistent}.
Since Σ ∈M, M is not empty. If we are given a subsystem M′ ⊆M that is linearly
ordered by inclusion (i.e. for Σ1,Σ2 ∈M′, either Σ1 ⊆Σ2 or Σ2 ⊆Σ1), then the set
Σ′ :=
	
Σ1∈M′
Σ1
is clearly an upper bound for M′ in M. To see this, note ﬁrst that for each Σ1 ∈M′,
Σ1 ⊆Σ ′, trivially. The consistency of Σ′ rests simply on the ﬁniteness of a proof
of a hypothetical contradiction from Σ′: such a proof can utilize only ﬁnitely many
axioms σ1,...,σn ∈Σ ′. Each of the σi lies in a member of the system M′, say,
σi ∈Σi. Since, however, the sets Σ1,...,Σn are comparable, one of them, say Σn,
must contain all the others as subsets. Then the hypothetical contradiction would be
deducible already from Σn, which is impossible.
We have therefore shown that the system M fulﬁls the hypotheses of Zorn’s
lemma. Therefore there is a maximal element Σ∗in M. Then, according to the
deﬁnition of M, Σ ⊆Σ∗and Σ∗is consistent.
⊓⊔
Remark 1.4.5 If the language L is countable, i.e. the sets I, J and K are (ﬁnite or)
countable, then Zorn’s lemma can be avoided in the proof of the above lemma.
Proof (of 1.4.5):
In this case we can start with an enumeration (ϕn)n∈N of all
L-sentences. Then we recursively deﬁne
Σ0 = Σ
Σn+1 =

Σn
in case Σn ∪{ϕn} is inconsistent, and
Σn ∪{ϕn}
otherwise.
(1.4.5.1)
Thus we obtain an ascending chain
Σ0 ⊆Σ1 ⊆··· ⊆Σn ⊆Σn+1 ⊆···
of consistent sets of sentences. From this it follows, as before, that also
Σ ∗:=
	
n∈N
Σn

1.4 Completeness of First-Order Logic
33
is consistent. Because of Σ = Σ0 ⊆Σ∗, it remains only to show the maximality of
Σ ∗. Assume there were a ϕ ∈Sent(L) such that Σ∗∪{ϕ} were still consistent. This
sentence ϕ occurs in the enumeration (ϕn)n∈N of all L-sentences. Let us say ϕ is ϕn.
From the consistency of Σ∗∪{ϕ} follows that of Σ∗∪{ϕn} and, a fortiori, that of
Σn ∪{ϕn}. Therefore
Σn ∪{ϕn} = Σn+1 ⊆Σ∗,
by (1.4.5.1). From this follows ϕn ∈Σ ∗. Thus Σ∗is maximal (as well as consistent).
⊓⊔
Now we apply Theorem 1.4.4 to the consistent set Σ′ ⊆Sent(L′) obtained in
Theorem 1.4.2, in order to obtain a maximal consistent extension Σ∗⊆Sent(L′) of
Σ ′. For such a Σ∗we have:
(I)
Σ ∗is maximal consistent in Sent(L′);
(II)
for each ∃xϕ in Sent(L′) there is a k ∈K′ with (∃xϕ →ϕ(x/ck)) in Σ ∗.
These two properties of Σ∗canonically determine a domain in which all sentences
σ ∈Σ ∗hold, as we shall see. In particular, all σ ∈Σ will hold there.
We ﬁrst consider the set of constant L′-terms:
CT := {t ∈Tm(L′) | no variable occurs in t }.
(1.4.5.2)
CT contains, in particular, all ck with k ∈K′. We deﬁne a binary relation ≈on CT:
for t1,t2 ∈CT, we set
t1 ≈t2
iff
Σ∗⊢t1 .= t2.
(1.4.5.3)
With the help of axiom (I1) (1.3.0.9) and Rules (S) and (Tr), we recognize immedi-
ately that ≈is an equivalence relation on CT, i.e. for t1,t2,t3 ∈CT:
(i)
t1 ≈t1,
(ii)
if t1 ≈t2, then t2 ≈t1, and
(iii)
if t1 ≈t2 and t2 ≈t3, then t1 ≈t3.
Now the sought-for domain is the set
A := CT/≈
(1.4.5.4)
of all equivalence classes t of constant terms. Here, as usual, we deﬁne for t ∈CT:
t = {t1 ∈CT | t ≈t1 }.
(1.4.5.5)
Then
t1 = t2
iff
t1 ≈t2.
(1.4.5.6)
In order to be able to speak meaningfully of the truth of a sentence in the domain
(something that we shall make precise only in the next section), we must say which
relations, functions and individuals the symbols Ri, f j and ck name – i.e. we must
give an interpretation of these symbols.
To each i ∈I we deﬁne a λ(i)-place relation Ri on the domain A, by declaring,
for term-classes t1,...,tλ(i), that

34
1 First-Order Logic
Ri(t1,...,tλ(i)) holds if and only if Σ∗⊢Ri(t1,...,tλ(i)).
(1.4.5.7)
Here the notation Ri(t1,...,tλ(i)) means, as usual, that the relation Ri holds at the
λ(i)-tuple (t1,...,tλ(i)) of term-classes; i.e. that (t1,...,tλ(i)) ∈Ri. One should ob-
serve, however, that the above deﬁnition of Ri refers back to a particular choice of
representatives tν of the term-classes tν. It must be shown that a choice of other
representatives leads to the same deﬁnition. Thus, suppose t1 ≈t′
1, ..., tλ(i) ≈t′
λ(i);
then we must show:
Σ∗⊢Ri(t1,...,tλ(i))
iff
Σ ∗⊢Ri(t′
1,...,t′
λ(i)).
(1.4.5.8)
By symmetry, it obviously sufﬁces to show only one direction. So let us assume that
Σ∗⊢Ri(t1,...,tλ(i)).
Along with this deducibility we have, according to the hypothesis, the deducibilities
Σ∗⊢tν .= t′
ν,
for 1 ≤ν ≤λ(i).
By piecing these λ(i) + 1 deductions together, we assemble a deduction from Σ∗
that ends with the following lines:
t1 .= t′
1
...
tλ(i) .= t′
λ(i)
Ri(t1,...,tλ(i)).
Now we extend this proof with the following lines:
Ri(t1,t2,...,tλ(i)) →Ri(t′
1,t2,...,tλ(i))
Ri(t′
1,t2,...,tλ(i))
Ri(t′
1,t2,t3,...,tλ(i)) →Ri(t′
1,t′
2,t3,...,tλ(i))
Ri(t′
1,t′
2,t3,...,tλ(i))
...
...
...
Ri(t′
1,t′
2,...,t′
λ(i)−1,tλ(i)) →Ri(t′
1,t′
2,...,t′
λ(i)−1,t′
λ(i))
Ri(t′
1,t′
2,...,t′
λ(i)−1,t′
λ(i)).
These lines arise from alternating application of (Ri) (p. 20) and (MP). Altogether
we obtain
Σ∗⊢Ri(t′
1,...,t′
λ(i)),
proving (1.4.5.8).

1.4 Completeness of First-Order Logic
35
Next, for each j ∈J we deﬁne a μ(j)-place function Fj : Aμ(j) →A by deﬁning,
for term-classes t1,...,tμ(j),
Fj(t1,...,tμ(j)) := f j(t1,...,tμ(j)).
(1.4.5.9)
Here, too, we must show that this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of rep-
resentative tν of the class tν. By application of the Rules (Fj) and (Tr) (p. 20), we
obtain, following the above pattern of argument, a proof from Σ∗of
f j(t1,...,tμ(j)) .= f j(t′
1,...,t′
μ(j)),
if one assumes
Σ∗⊢tν .= t′
ν
for 1 ≤ν ≤μ(j).
Finally, for every k ∈K,
we take the class ck to be the interpretation of ck.
(1.4.5.10)
The content of the next theorem is that, under the above interpretations, all L′-
sentences σ ∈Σ∗, and only those, hold in the domain A. This will become con-
clusively clear, however, only after we have, in the next section, made the notion of
satisfaction precise. We place a small technical lemma before the promised theorem.
Lemma 1.4.6. The maximal consistent set Σ∗of sentences is deductively closed; i.e.
for each α ∈Sent(L′) with Σ∗⊢α, α ∈Σ∗.
Proof: In view of the maximal consistency of Σ∗, it sufﬁces to show that Σ∗∪
{α} is consistent whenever Σ ∗⊢α. But this is clear: namely, if Σ∗∪{α} were
inconsistent, then we would have, in particular,
Σ ∗∪{α} ⊢¬α,
which, together with the Deduction Theorem 1.3.2, would lead to
Σ∗⊢(α →¬α).
Because of the tautology
(α →¬α) →¬α,
this would lead, ﬁnally, to Σ ∗⊢¬α, contrary to the assumption that Σ∗is consis-
tent.
⊓⊔
Theorem 1.4.7. Suppose Σ∗is an arbitrary subset of Sent(L′) possessing properties
(I) and (II) (p. 33). Then, for every α, β, and ∀xϕ in Sent(L′), we have:
(a)
¬α ∈Σ∗
iff
α /∈Σ ∗;
(b)
(α ∧β) ∈Σ∗
iff
(α ∈Σ ∗and β ∈Σ∗); and
(c)
∀xϕ ∈Σ∗
iff
ϕ(x/t) ∈Σ∗for all t ∈CT (1.4.5.2).

36
1 First-Order Logic
Proof: (a) (⇒) Since Σ∗is consistent (I), α and ¬α cannot both lie in Σ ∗.
(⇐) From α /∈Σ∗we deduce immediately that Σ∗̸⊢α, by Lemma 1.4.6. From
this it follows that Σ∗∪{¬α} is consistent, by Lemma 1.4.1. But since Σ∗is maxi-
mal consistent (I), Σ∗∪{¬α} = Σ ∗, whence ¬α ∈Σ ∗.
(b) (⇒) From (α ∧β) ∈Σ ∗it follows trivially that Σ∗⊢(α ∧β). Then Σ ∗⊢α
and Σ ∗⊢β, by Rules (∧B1) and (∧B2). Now use Lemma 1.4.6.
(⇐) Use Rule (∧) (p. 19) followed by Lemma 1.4.6.
(c) (⇒) If ∀xϕ ∈Σ∗, then Σ∗⊢∀xϕ. Then for any t ∈CT, Σ∗⊢ϕ(x/t), by
Rule (∀B) (p. 18), which applies here since every constant term t is, vacuously, free
for x in ϕ. By (1.4.6), we get ϕ(x/t) ∈Σ∗.
(⇐) Assume ∀xϕ /∈Σ∗. Then ¬∀xϕ ∈Σ∗, by (a). From this we would like to
deduce ∃x¬ϕ ∈Σ∗. Σ ∗⊢(¬¬ϕ →ϕ), since ¬¬ϕ →ϕ is a tautology. From this,
Σ ∗∪{¬¬ϕ} ⊢ϕ follows immediately, and thence (with Lemma 1.3.1)
Σ∗∪{∀x¬¬ϕ} ⊢∀xϕ.
Since ∀xϕ is a sentence by hypothesis, so is ∀x¬¬ϕ. Therefore we may apply the
Deduction Theorem 1.3.2 to obtain
Σ∗⊢(∀x¬¬ϕ →∀xϕ).
From this we obtain, using (CP) (p. 18),
Σ∗⊢(¬∀xϕ →¬∀x¬¬ϕ),
and, using ¬∀xϕ ∈Σ∗, ﬁnally ∃x¬ϕ ∈Σ∗. By hypothesis (II) there is at least one
t ∈CT (in fact, t may even be taken to be a constant symbol) such that
Σ∗⊢(∃x¬ϕ →¬ϕ(x/t)).
Therefore for this t we conclude ¬ϕ(x/t) ∈Σ∗. But then ϕ(x/t) /∈Σ∗, by (I).
⊓⊔
1.5 First-Order Semantics
In this section we want to deﬁne what it means for a formula ϕ of a formal language
L to hold in, or to be satisﬁed by, a particular mathematical structure, and, more gen-
erally, what it should mean for such a structure to be a model of an axiom system Σ.
In order to be able to carry this out meaningfully, we must ﬁrst ﬁx the boundaries of
a domain of objects to which our quantiﬁers ∀u and ∃v should refer, i.e. over which
the variables v0,v1,... should “vary”. After that we must deﬁne the interpretation of
each relation symbol Ri (i ∈I), each function symbol f j (j ∈J), and each constant
symbol ck (k ∈K).

1.5 First-Order Semantics
37
Suppose we are given a formal language L = (λ,μ,K). An L-structure A is de-
termined by the following data:
|A|:
a nonempty set, the universe of A;
RA
i :
a λ(i)-place relation on |A| (i.e. a subset of |A|λ(i)), for each i ∈I;
f A
j :
a μ(j)-place function deﬁned on all of |A|
(i.e. a function |A|μ(j) →|A|), for each j ∈J;
cA
k :
a ﬁxed element of |A|, for each k ∈K.
We summarize this with the notation
A =

|A|;

RA
i

i∈I;

f A
j

j∈J;

cA
k

k∈K

.
If we again consider the language L (p. 21) used in our example of a formal proof
in Section 1.3, with the relation symbol ≤, the function symbols −, +, · , and the
constant symbol 0, then the following is an L-structure:
R =

R; ≤R; −R, +R, ·R; 0R
.
(1.5.0.1)
Here R is the set of real numbers; ≤R is the usual “less-than-or-equal-to” relation
on R; −R, +R, and ·R are the usual operations “negative” (unary), “plus” (binary),
and “times” (binary) on R; and 0R is the real number “zero”.
Let us pursue this example further by considering the formula
∃v0 (0 ≤v0 ∧v0 ≤v1).
(1.5.0.2)
Then the question whether this formula holds in (or is satisﬁed by) R – presup-
posing for now a deﬁnition of satisfaction that agrees with our intuition – can be
meaningfully answered only after we assign to v1 a deﬁnite value in R: for a nega-
tive value of v1, the answer is no; for other values, the answer is yes. Thus we see in
this example that for a meaningful deﬁnition of the satisfaction of a formula ϕ in R,
each of the free variables of ϕ must be assigned a value in R. For certain technical
reasons we assign values not only to the free variables of one formula, but to the
free variables of all formulae; i.e. to all variables. However, in the deﬁnition of sat-
isfaction we must make sure that in the case of the bound variables of the formula
ϕ under consideration, the ﬁxed assignment by h is “unﬁxed”.
An assignment of values in |A| for all variables will be called an evaluation of
the variables in A. Thus, an evaluation in A is a function
h : Vbl →|A|.
If h is an evaluation in A, then the value h(x) ∈|A| is assigned to the variable x.
For each a ∈|A|, each x ∈Vbl, and each evaluation h, the function h

x
a

, deﬁned as
follows, is again an evaluation:

38
1 First-Order Logic
h

x
a

(v) =

h(v)
for v ̸= x
a
for v = x.
(1.5.0.3)
The evaluations h and h

x
a

agree with each other at all variables other than x. At x,
the value of h is h(x), while that of h

x
a

is a. Obviously, h

 x
h(x)

= h.
Next we deﬁne, by recursion on the construction of a term, the value tA [h] of the
term t under the evaluation h (or simply the h-value of t) in A:
vA [h] := h(v)
cA
k [h] := cA
k
f j(t1,...,tμ(j))A [h] := f A
j

tA
1 [h],...,tA
μ(j) [h]

.
(1.5.0.4)
It is clear that these equations determine the h-value (in |A|) of each term, by starting
the recursive process with the h-values of its simplest subterms – the variables and
constant symbols occurring in it.
The satisfaction of a formula ϕ under an evaluation h in A will be a ternary
relation of our metatheory. If this relation between A, ϕ, and h holds, then we shall
write A |= ϕ [h] (pronounced: “ϕ holds in A under h”, “ϕ is true in A under h”,
or “ϕ is satisﬁed by A under h”); if this relation does not hold, then we shall write
A ̸|= ϕ [h]. This relation will likewise be deﬁned by recursion on the construction
of formulae, starting with the simplest formulae, the atomic formulae, and indeed
simultaneously for all evaluations.
For atomic formulae t1 .= t2 and Ri(t1,...,tλ(i)), we declare, for an arbitrary eval-
uation h in A:
A |= t1 .= t2 [h]
iff
tA
1 [h] = tA
2 [h];
(1.5.0.5)
A |= Ri(t1,...,tλ(i))[h] iff
RA
i

tA
1 [h],...,tA
λ(i) [h]

.
(1.5.0.6)
Thereafter, for formulae ϕ and ψ we continue our recursive deﬁnition as follows:
A |= ¬ϕ [h]
iff
A ̸|= ϕ [h];
(1.5.0.7)
A |= (ϕ ∧ψ) [h]
iff
(A |= ϕ [h]
and
A |= ψ [h]);
(1.5.0.8)
A |= ∀xϕ [h]
iff
A |= ϕ

h

x
a

, for all a ∈|A|.
(1.5.0.9)
Observe that in the last case, where x is certainly bound, the prescription by h of
a particular value in |A| for x is unﬁxed, since in this case we consider, instead of
h itself, an alteration of h at the point x; here every such alteration is taken into
consideration. In this way we ensure that the deﬁnition of satisfaction really agrees
with our intuition.
Using the deﬁnitions of ∨, →, ↔, and ∃from Section 1.2, and the deﬁnition of
satisfaction, one obtains immediately the following equivalences:

1.5 First-Order Semantics
39
A |= (ϕ ∨ψ) [h]
iff
(A |= ϕ [h]
or
A |= ψ [h]);
A |= (ϕ →ψ) [h]
iff
(A |= ϕ [h] implies A |= ψ [h]);
(1.5.0.10)
A |= (ϕ ↔ψ) [h]
iff
(A |= ϕ [h]
iff
A |= ψ [h]);
A |= ∃xϕ [h]
iff there is an a ∈|A| such that A |= ϕ

h

x
a

.
(1.5.0.11)
Here, the words “and”, “or”, “implies”, “iff”, “for all a” and “there exists an a” are
to be understood in the usual mathematical sense; in particular, “or” is not used in
the exclusive sense, and “implies” is regarded as false only when the premise is true
and the conclusion is false; cf. the truth table on page 16.
For the structure R in (1.5.0.1) above (with the set of real numbers as universe),
and the formula ∃v0 (0 ≤v0 ∧v0 ≤v1) (1.5.0.2), we have the following translation:
R |= ∃v0 (0 ≤v0 ∧v0 ≤v1)[h]
iff there exists an a ∈R such that R |= (0 ≤v0 ∧v0 ≤v1)

h

v0
a

iff there exists an a ∈R such that

0 ≤R a ∧a ≤R h(v1)

.
This example shows yet again that the deﬁnition of satisfaction has fulﬁlled its pur-
pose: it translates, using the prescription of values of the free variables given by
an evaluation h, a string ϕ of symbols into an assertion in the metalanguage – the
interpretation of ϕ in R under h.
In this example we see, in addition, that for the relation |= to hold, the only
variables whose h-values are material are the free variables of ϕ. This can be shown
in general:
Lemma 1.5.1. Let h′ and h′′ be evaluations in the L-structure A. Then:
(a) If h′ and h′′ agree on the variables in the L-term t, then tA [h′] = tA [h′′].
(b) If h′ and h′′ agree on the free variables occurring in the L-formula ϕ, then
A |= ϕ [h′]
iff
A |= ϕ [h′′].
(1.5.1.1)
Proof: (a) The following equations prove this by induction on the recursive con-
struction of terms:
vA [h′] = h′(v) = h′′(v) = vA [h′′]

tion of formulae:

. Note that these two evaluations agree with each other
on all free variables of ϕ, due to the common alteration of h′ and h′′ at x.
⊓⊔
From Lemma 1.5.1 we see, in particular, that the satisfaction of a sentence ϕ
in A does not depend on the evaluation h considered. That is, for ϕ ∈Sent(L) and
evaluations h′ and h′′ in A, we always have
A |= ϕ [h′]
iff
A |= ϕ [h′′].
(1.5.1.3)
We say that a formula ϕ holds in, or is true in, or is satisﬁed by, A (and we write
A |= ϕ), in case A |= ϕ [h] holds for all evaluations h in A. One easily sees that
A |= ϕ
iff
A |= ∀ϕ (p. 13).
This follows, by induction, from the equivalence
A |= ϕ
iff
A |= ∀xϕ
(1.5.1.4)
(for any variable x), which is proved as follows:

If Σ is a set of L-sentences, then an L-structure A is called a model of Σ if every
σ ∈Σ holds in A, i.e. A |= σ for all σ ∈Σ. In this case we write A |= Σ.
Now we come back to the starting point (1.4.0.1) of our inquiry in Section 1.4:
How can an “undeducibility” Σ ̸⊢ϕ occur? The answer is given by the following
theorem (which is the promised, precise version of (1.4.0.2)):
Theorem 1.5.2 (G¨odel’s completeness theorem). Let Σ ⊆Sent(L) and ϕ ∈Sent(L).
Then from Σ ̸⊢ϕ follows the existence of a “counterexample”, i.e. an L-structure A
that is a model of Σ but in which ϕ does not hold (thus A is a model of Σ ∪{¬ϕ}).
Proof: By Lemma 1.4.1, the condition Σ ̸⊢ϕ is equivalent to the condition that
the set Σ1 := Σ ∪{¬ϕ} is consistent. Thus we must show that every consistent set
Σ ⊆Sent(L) possesses a model. (Here we have replaced Σ ∪{¬ϕ} by Σ.)
So let Σ ⊆Sent(L) be consistent. We apply ﬁrst Theorem 1.4.2 and then Theo-
rem 1.4.4 to this Σ. We obtain thereby a Σ∗⊆Sent(L′) with properties (I) and (II)
on page 33. Here, L′ is the extension language of L constructed in Theorem 1.4.2.
Let
A = CT/≈
(1.5.2.1)
be the set of equivalence classes of constant terms of the language L′, constructed
in (1.4.5.4). Further, let Ri (for i ∈I), Fj (for j ∈J) and ck (for k ∈K′) be the
interpretations of the relation symbols Ri, the function symbols f j and the constant
symbols ck, given in (1.4.5.7), (1.4.5.9) and (1.4.5.10), respectively. Then
A = ⟨A; (Ri)i∈I; (Fj) j∈J; (ck)k∈K′⟩
(1.5.2.2)
is, ﬁnally, an L′-structure. By deﬁnition,
Ri = RA
i ,
Fj = f A
j ,
ck = cA
k .
(1.5.2.3)
From our special deﬁnition of functions, we even have
tA [h] = t
(1.5.2.4)
for all t ∈CT and all evaluations h in A. Indeed, by induction on the construction of
a constant term we have
f j(t1,...,tμ(j))A [h] = f A
j

tA
1 [h],...,tA
μ(j) [h]

by (1.5.0.4)
= Fj(t1,...,tμ(j))
by (1.5.2.3) and ind. hyp.
= f j(t1,...,tμ(j))
by (1.4.5.9).
Now we show that for every ϕ ∈Sent(L′) and every evaluation h in A,

42
1 First-Order Logic
A |= ϕ [h]
iff
ϕ ∈Σ ∗.
(1.5.2.5)
Then, in particular, A will be a model of Σ∗. We shall prove (1.5.2.5) by induction
on the construction of ϕ – more precisely, by induction on the number of logical
symbols ¬, ∧and ∀used in the construction of ϕ.
If this number is 0, then we are dealing with an atomic formula. But in this case
the deﬁnitions furnish us with the required equivalence, since for constant terms
t1,t2,... we have, ﬁrst,
A |= t1 .= t2 [h]
iff tA
1 [h] = tA
2 [h]
by (1.5.0.5)
iff t1 = t2
by (1.5.2.4)
iff t1 .= t2 ∈Σ∗
by (1.4.5.6), (1.4.5.3),
and (1.4.6),
and, second,
A |= Ri(t1,...) [h] iff RA

by (1.5.0.6)
iff Ri(t1,...)
by (1.5.2.3) and (1.5.2.4)
iff Ri(t1,...) ∈Σ∗
by (1.4.5.7) and (1.4.6).
Next, if the sentence ϕ is of the form ¬α or (α ∧β), then α and β are likewise
sentences. We have:
A |= ¬α [h]
iff A ̸|= α [h]
by (1.5.0.7)
iff α /∈Σ∗
by ind. hyp. (1.5.2.5)
iff ¬α ∈Σ∗
by (1.4.7)(a),
and
A |= (α ∧β) [h] iff (A |= α [h] and A |= β [h])
by (1.5.0.8)
iff (α ∈Σ∗and β ∈Σ∗)
by ind. hyp. (1.5.2.5)
iff (α ∧β) ∈Σ∗
by (1.4.7)(b).
Finally, if the sentence ϕ is of the form ∀xψ, then for t ∈CT, ψ(x/t) is obviously
again a sentence, since Fr(ψ) ⊆{x}. And ψ(x/t) is more simply built than ϕ, as far
as the number of logical symbols. Therefore, using Lemma 1.5.3, proved just below,
we have:
A |= ∀xψ [h]

iff ∀xψ ∈Σ∗

We have proved, ﬁnally (modulo Lemma 1.5.3 below), that all L′-sentences ϕ ∈
Σ ∗(and only those) hold in the L′-structure A (1.5.2.2). It is therefore clear that all
L-sentences ϕ ∈Σ hold in the L-structure
A|L := ⟨A; (Ri)i∈I; (Fj)j∈J; (ck)k∈K⟩.
Thus, Σ possesses a model.
⊓⊔
The following lemma (used in (1.5.2.6) above) is of a technical nature.
Lemma 1.5.3. Let A be L-structure, h an evaluation in A, ϕ an L-formula, x a
variable and t an L-term that is free for x in ϕ. Then, writing a = tA [h] (1.5.0.4),
we have:
A |= ϕ

A |= ϕ(x/t)[h].

= t1 (x/t)A [h].
(1.5.3.2)
Now we shall prove (1.5.3.1) by induction on the construction of the formula ϕ.
In the atomic formula t1 .= t2, for example, we have:
A |= t1 .= t2

by (1.5.3.2)
iff
A |= (t1 .= t2) (x/t) [h] by (1.5.0.5).
(1.5.3.3)
In (1.5.3.3) we have enclosed t1 .= t2 in parentheses in order to indicate the scope of
application of the syntactic operation (x/t). (Note that the notation (x/t) (1.2.0.8)
belongs not to the object language, but to the metalanguage!) It is clear that (t1 .=
t2)(x/t) is t1 (x/t) .= t2 (x/t).
The other case (1.5.0.6) of atomic formulae ϕ is handled analogously.
The cases in which ϕ is of the form ¬ϕ or (α ∧β) are likewise easily handled,
by referring back to the components α, or α and β, respectively.
There remains only the case where ϕ is of the form ∀yψ. Here we distinguish
two (sub)cases:
Case 1: Either y is x, or x /∈Fr(ψ). Under either of these assumptions, x /∈
Fr(∀yψ). Therefore, using Lemma 1.5.1,
A |= ∀yψ


A |= ∀yψ [h].
This, however, is (1.5.3.1), since (∀yψ)(x/t) is clearly ∀yψ.
Case 2: y is not x, and x ∈Fr(ψ). In this case y cannot occur in t, since, by
hypothesis, t is free for x in ∀yψ (p. 12). It follows, using Lemma 1.5.1(a), that for
every a′ ∈|A|,
a = tA [h] = tA 

⊓⊔
The next theorem assures us of the correctness or soundness of the concept of
proof developed in Section 1.3. It asserts that everything that can be proved from
an axiom system Σ also holds in every model of Σ. Thus, if we have a model of
Σ ∪{¬ϕ}, then obviously ϕ cannot be proved from Σ. Considered formally, this is
the converse of the implication asserted in G¨odel’s Completeness Theorem (1.5.2).
Theorem 1.5.4 (Soundness Theorem). Suppose Σ ⊆Sent(L), ϕ ∈Sent(L) and Σ ⊢
ϕ. Then ϕ holds in every model of Σ.
Proof: Let A be a model of Σ, and ϕ1,...,ϕn be a proof from Σ. We shall show
that A |= ϕi for i ∈{1,2,...,n}, by induction on i. This will, in particular, prove the
theorem.
Basis step of the induction: Let i = 1. Then either ϕi ∈Σ (1.3.0.1), or ϕi is a
logical axiom (1.3.0.2). In the ﬁrst case, ϕi holds in A by hypothesis.
In the second case, suppose, ﬁrst, that ϕi is an instance of a tautological form
Φ in the sentential variables A0,...,Am, arising by the replacement of Aj by the
L-formula ψ j, for 0 ≤j ≤m (p. 16). Let h be any evaluation in A. Deﬁne a truth
assignment H on the variables A0,...,Am as follows:
H (A j) =

T
if A |= ψ j [h],
F
if A ̸|= ψ j [h].
Then H (Φ) = T iff A |= ϕi [h], since the equations (1.3.0.4) and (1.3.0.5) giving
the recursive deﬁnition of H on arbitrary sentential forms Φ agree, respectively,
with the equations (1.5.0.7) and (1.5.0.8) giving (the relevant part of) the recursive
deﬁnition of A |= ϕi [h]. But H (Φ) = T, since Φ is tautological; therefore A |=
ϕi [h]. Since h was arbitrary, we conclude that A |= ϕi (p. 40).
In the case where ϕi is one of the equality axioms (1.3.0.9), one may convince
oneself just as easily that A |= ϕi.
There remain the cases where ϕi is an instance of the quantiﬁer axioms (A1)
(1.3.0.7) or (A2) (1.3.0.8).
First let ϕi be of the form
∀x(α →β) →(α →∀xβ),
where x is not free in α. According to the deﬁnition of satisfaction (p. 40), we must
show, for every evaluation h, that:

proving (1.5.4.2), as required in this “(A2)” case.
Second, let ϕi be of the form

where t is free for x in α. For each evaluation h we must show that:
the hypothesis
A |= α

h

x

(1.5.4.3)


h

x


with a = tA [h]. But this is
a special case of (1.5.4.3).
Induction step: Assume, for all j < i, that we have already proved A |= ϕj. We
must show A |= ϕi.
If ϕi is a member of Σ or a logical axiom, then we obtain A |= ϕi as in the basis
step of the induction, above. If ϕi comes about by means of (MP), then there are
j,k < i with ϕk being ϕj →ϕi. For each evaluation h we then have A |= (ϕj →ϕi)[h]
and A |= ϕ j [h]. This immediately gives A |= ϕi [h], using (1.5.0.10). Since h was
arbitrary, A |= ϕi.
Finally, if ϕi comes about by means of (∀), then there exists a j < i and a variable
x such that ϕi is ∀xϕj. The inductive hypothesis is that A |= ϕj. From this follows
A |= ∀xϕj (1.5.1.4).
⊓⊔
Corollary 1.5.5. A set Σ ⊆Sent(L) is consistent if and only if it possesses a model.
Proof: If Σ is consistent, then Σ possesses a model by G¨odel’s Completeness Theo-
rem 1.5.2. Conversely, if Σ possesses a model, then no contradiction can be deduced
from Σ, according to Theorem 1.5.4.
⊓⊔
From this corollary, which actually summarizes Theorems 1.5.2 and 1.5.4, we
obtain the most important theorem of model theory (later named the Compactness
Theorem):

46
1 First-Order Logic
Theorem 1.5.6 (Finiteness Theorem). A set Σ ⊆Sent(L) possesses a model if and
only if every ﬁnite subset Π of Σ possesses a model.
Proof: If Σ possesses a model, then every ﬁnite subset of Σ possesses the same
model. It remains to show the converse. Assume that Σ possesses no model. Then Σ
would be inconsistent, by (1.5.5). However, since only ﬁnitely many elements of Σ
can occur in any proof of any contradiction from Σ, some ﬁnite subset Π ⊆Σ would
already be inconsistent. By (1.5.5) again, Π would have no model. This proves the
converse.
⊓⊔
Remark 1.5.7 (Model theoretic proofs of the Finiteness Theorem). The above proof
of the Finiteness Theorem made essential use of G¨odel’s Completeness Theorem,
and hence of the concept of proof. In the above argument we see immediately how
the ﬁniteness of the concept of proof has an impact. Observe, however, that the
statement of the Finiteness Theorem makes no reference to the concept of proof.
In fact, there are other proofs of this theorem, which are purely model theoretic.
They can be expressed using only the concepts of “formal language” and “model.”
In Section 2.6 we shall carry out such a proof, by means of ultraproducts. For a
deeper understanding of the Finiteness Theorem, however, the proof using G¨odel’s
Completeness Theorem seems to us to be better.
1.6 Axiomatization of Several Mathematical Theories
In this section we wish to axiomatize several mathematical theories in the frame-
work of the formal languages introduced here. In particular, we shall give an axiom
system (in a suitable language) for set theory. First, however, we shall clarify what
we mean by a mathematical theory.
The word “theory” in mathematics has many uses, and cannot easily be deﬁned
comprehensively. Consider “number theory”, as an example: what can be said with
certainty is that in this “theory” one investigates the set N of natural numbers (or
also the set Z of integers) and the properties of the operations “addition” and “mul-
tiplication” deﬁned on those numbers. Usually one also associates with a certain
mathematical “theory”, implicitly or explicitly, the methods that are applied in it;
for example, one speaks of “analytic number theory” or “algebraic number theory”
or even “modern number theory”. In the case of the attribute “modern”, other or
new methods are not necessarily meant; often it is just a matter of a representation
in a new, “modern” language. All these methods of investigation have one goal in
common:
One wishes to produce, as far as possible, all sentences true in N (or in Z).
Analogously, in “group theory” one wants to produce, as far as possible, all sen-
tences true in a speciﬁed class of groups. We take this goal as the motivation for the
following deﬁnition.

1.6 Axiomatization of Several Mathematical Theories
47
Let L = (λ,μ,K) be a formal language and M a nonempty class of L-structures.
Then we deﬁne the L-theory of M to be the set
Th(M ) := {α ∈Sent(L) | A |= α, for all A ∈M }.
(1.6.0.1)
Thus, Th(M ) consists exactly of all L-sentences that hold in all structures in M .
The set Th(M ) of sentences possesses two important properties:
(1) Th(M ) is consistent, and
(2) Th(M ) is deductively closed.
Here, a subset Σ ⊆Sent(L) is called deductively closed (cf. Lemma 1.4.6) if, for
every L-sentence α, Σ ⊢α implies α ∈Σ. Property (1) follows from Corollary 1.5.5
and the nonemptiness of M . Property (2) is derived as follows: Suppose Th(M ) ⊢
α. Since every A ∈M is obviously a model of Th(M ), A is also a model of α, by
Theorem 1.5.4. Therefore α belongs to Th(M ), by (1.6.0.1).
More generally, we call a subset T of Sent(L) an L-theory if T is consistent and
deductively closed. Every L-theory in this sense is actually the L-theory of a class
of L-structures, namely, just the class M of all models of T, i.e. the class
M = {A | A is an L-structure and A |= T }.
This is easy to see: by (1.6.0.1), T ⊆Th(M ) holds trivially, since each α ∈T nat-
urally holds in all models of T. If, conversely, α holds in all models of T, then the
Completeness Theorem 1.5.2 immediately yields T ⊢α. Therefore α ∈T, by the
deductive closedness of T.
While for any given nonempty class M of L-structures we can, indeed, deﬁne the
set T = Th(M ) purely abstractly, as a rule this set will be completely intractable.
We shall return to this problem in Appendix A. Sometimes, however, it is possible
to give a reasonable system Σ of axioms for T. Here we call Σ an axiom system for
T if
T = {α ∈Sent(L) | Σ ⊢α }.
Observe that the set {α ∈Sent(L) | Σ ⊢α }, which we wish to denote also by
Ded(Σ), is deductively closed. Indeed, if α1,...,αn ∈Ded(Σ) and {α1,...,αn} ⊢α,
then we have n proofs of α1,...,αn from Σ, and a proof of α from {α1,...,αn};
from these n + 1 proofs we can easily assemble a proof of α directly from Σ. By
a “reasonable” axiom system Σ for T we mean one that is effectively enumerable,
e.g. ﬁnite. Appendix A will explain more precisely how the concept of “effective
enumerability” can be given a deﬁnition. In the following examples we shall write
down the corresponding axiom systems concretely.
Usually the most interesting case of a possible axiomatization of the L-theory of
a class M is that in which M has exactly one L-structure A. In this case we also
write Th(A) for Th(M ), and (1.6.0.1) simpliﬁes to
Th(A) = {α ∈Sent(L) | A |= α }.

48
1 First-Order Logic
Here we also speak of the “L-theory of A”. For example, if
N =

N; +N; ·N
,
then Th(N) is what we want to be understood by the phrase “number theory”,
namely, simply the set of all sentences (of the formal language L appropriate for
A) that are true in N.
For an L-structure A, the L-theory T := Th(A) has an excellent property: since
for every L-sentence α,
A |= α
or
A |= ¬α,
we obtain, correspondingly,
α ∈T
or
¬α ∈T.
We call an arbitrary L-theory T with this property complete. More generally we
want to call an arbitrary set Σ of L-sentences complete if, for every L-sentence α,
Σ ⊢α
or
Σ ⊢¬α.
(1.6.0.2)
The latter deﬁnition does not clash with the former in the case where Σ itself is
already an L-theory, since in that case Σ would be deductively closed. And the latter
deﬁnition is more general, as one sees by considering either the consistency, or the
deductive closedness, of an L-theory T. If Σ is consistent and T = Ded(Σ), then
clearly T is complete in the ﬁrst sense if and only if Σ is in the second sense.
With this we have ﬁnally arrived at a purely syntactical concept, which is then
also meaningful when one adopts the ﬁnitist standpoint. If L is a language permitting
us to express all reasonable mathematical concepts, and if some set Σ is a concrete,
consistent axiom system in L (we shall, further below, present the Zermelo–Fraenkel
axiom system for set theory as one such system), then the completeness of Σ would
mean that one could prove (from Σ) every “true” mathematical sentence. Then the
truth of a sentence would be nothing other than its provability. In Appendix A we
explain that such an axiom system cannot exist. There we shall see that, for example,
the Zermelo–Fraenkel axiom system is incomplete, i.e. that there exist sentences α
that are neither provable nor refutable from it (where “α is refutable” means that
¬α is provable).
Just below we shall introduce a series of axiom systems whose completeness we
shall prove in Chapter 3. If Σ ⊆Sent(L) is complete, and A is a model of Σ, then,
in particular,
Th(A) = Ded(Σ),
(1.6.0.3)
i.e. Ded(Σ) is the theory of the L-structure A. Indeed, since A is a model of Σ, we
have, on the one hand, Σ ⊆Th(A) and hence Ded(Σ) ⊆Th(A). On the other hand,
both T1 := Ded(Σ) and T2 := Th(A) are, ﬁrst, L-theories (for T1 this requires notic-
ing that Σ is consistent), and second, complete; and whenever we have an inclusion

49
T1 ⊆T2 between two complete L-theories, we even have equality. Indeed, if α ∈T2
and α /∈T1, then ¬α ∈T1 and thence ¬α ∈T2, contradicting the consistency of T2.
We record this as a Lemma:
Lemma 1.6.1. If T1 and T2 are complete L-theories with T1 ⊆T2, then T1 = T2.
⊓⊔
Now we want to introduce a series of L-theories; for each one, we shall, either
in this section or in Chapters 3 or 4, investigate whether it is complete. Each the-
ory considered here will be presented as the deductive closure of a concrete axiom
system. While setting up this axiom system, we shall usually have a particular L-
structure A in view. We usually begin with several general properties of A, which
we make into axioms, and then we try, by a systematic enlargement of this system,
to arrive, ﬁnally, at an axiomatization of Th(A), i.e. at a complete axiom system.
1. Dense linear orderings with no extrema
The ﬁrst structure whose theory we want to axiomatize is
R =

R; <R
.
This is a structure in the language L, for which J = /0, K = /0 and I consists of a
single element i with λ(i) = 2 (recall (1.2.0.10)–(1.2.0.11)). For the relation symbol
Ri we write <. The following are L-sentences that hold in R:
O1:
∀x
¬ x < x
O2:
∀x,y,z
(x < y ∧y < z →x < z)
O3:
∀x,y
(x < y ∨x .= y ∨y < x)
O4:
∀x,y
(x < y →∃z(x < z ∧z < y))
O5:
∀x ∃y,z (y < x ∧x < z)
O1 and O2 are called the axioms of a partial ordering; O1–O3 are the axioms of a
linear ordering. The addition of O4 says that this linear ordering is dense; and the
addition of O5 says that it possesses no extrema.
In Section 3.2 we shall see that O1–O5 is complete. O1–O4 is not complete, since,
for example, the sentence O5 is true in R, but not in R+ := ⟨R+; <R+⟩, where R+
denotes the set of nonnegative real numbers.
2. Torsion-free, divisible, Abelian groups
Next, let us consider the structure
R =

R; +R; 0R
,
which we have, for the sake of simplicity, again denoted by R. This time, L has a
binary function symbol + and the constant symbol 0. The following L-sentences
hold in R:

50
1 First-Order Logic
G1:
∀x,y,z(x+y)+z .= x+(y+z)
G2:
∀x
x+0 .= x
G3:
∀x ∃y x+ y .= 0
G4:
∀x,y x+ y .= y+x
G5,n:
∀x
(nx .= 0 →x .= 0)
G6,n:
∀x ∃y ny .= x
Here, for each natural number n ≥1, the (informal) expression nx abbreviates the
term x+x+···+x, the n-fold sum of x.4 G1–G3 are usually called the group axioms;
G4 says that this group is Abelian. The set {G5,n | n ≥1} of axioms expresses the
torsion free property of a group; the set {G6,n | n ≥1} expresses its divisibility. In
Section 3.2 we shall prove the completeness of the axiom system
{G1,G2,G3,G4}∪{G5,n | n ≥1}∪{G6,n | n ≥1}∪{∃x x ̸= 0}
of nontrivial, torsion-free, divisible, Abelian groups.
3. Ordered, divisible, Abelian groups
If we consider both the additive group structure and the ordering on R simultane-
ously, then one arrives, in the correspondingly extended language, at the structure
R =

R; <R; +R; 0R
.
This is an ordered, divisible, Abelian group, i.e. it is a model of all of the above-
listed O-axioms, all G-axioms, and additionally the axiom
OG:
∀x,y,z (x < y →x+z < y+z).
The totality of all these axioms is, as we shall show in Chapter 4, complete. One sees
easily that here the axioms O4 and G5,n are superﬂuous, and O5 can be replaced by
∃x x ̸= 0. We shall also show that the axiom system
{O1,O2,O3,G1,G2,G3,G4,OG}∪{G6,n | n ≥1}∪{∃x x ̸= 0}
is complete. Models of the ﬁrst part of the above union are called ordered Abelian
groups.
4 More precisely, this term should be written as (···((x+x)+x)+···)+x, since the arity of + is
2. No ambiguity will result from dropping these parentheses, thanks to G1.

1.6 Axiomatization of Several Mathematical Theories
51
4. Discrete ordered Abelian groups
Another ordered Abelian group whose theory interests us is
Z =

Z; <Z; +Z; 0Z
.
In order to axiomatize its theory, we observe, ﬁrst, that it is not divisible: it possesses
a smallest, positive element, namely the natural number 1. An ordered Abelian
group, which, like Z, satisﬁes the axiom
DO:
∃x(0 < x ∧∀y(0 < y →x .= y ∨x < y))
is called discrete ordered. The element x whose existence DO asserts is unique, by
O1 and O2.
5. Z-groups
To obtain a complete axiomatization of Z, it is advisable to add to the language of
ordered groups a constant symbol for the smallest positive element. Let this constant
symbol be 1. Thus, we now consider the structure
Z =

Z; <Z; +Z; 0Z, 1Z
.
Besides the axioms for discrete ordered Abelian groups, Z satisﬁes the following
family of axioms:
Dn:
∀x∃y
 n
ν=1
x+ν1 .= ny

.
(1.6.1.1)
Here n = 1,2,..., and for 1 ≤ν ≤n, the (informal) expression ν1 abbreviates the
term 1+1+···+1, the n-fold sum of 1. As in (1.2.0.12), the (informal) expression

n
ν=1 ϕν

is an abbreviation for the formula
(ϕ1 ∨···∨ϕn).
A discrete ordered Abelian group that is, in addition, a model of {Dn | n ≥1} is
called a Z-group. The reason for this name is the fact (proven later, in Chapter 4)
that the axiom system for Z-groups is complete, and Z is a model of it.
6. Ordered ﬁelds, real closed ﬁelds
Next we consider the structure
R =

R; +R, −R, ·R; 0R, 1R
,
which we wish again to denote by the letter R, even though this structure extends
previous structures by the same name. Now R satisﬁes the following axioms:

52
1 First-Order Logic
the ﬁeld axioms:
K1:
0 ̸= 1
(1.6.1.2)
K2:
∀x,y,z
x+(y+z) .= (x+y)+z
K3:
∀x
x+0 .= x
K4:
∀x
x+(−x) .= 0
K5:
∀x,y,z
x·(y·z) .= (x·y)·z
K6:
∀x
x·1 .= x
K7:
∀x∃y
(x .= 0 ∨x·y .= 1)
K8:
∀x,y
x·y .= y·x
K9:
∀x,y,z
(x+y)·z .= x·z+y·z;
the order axioms O1, O2, O3, together with:
OK1:
∀x,y,z
(x < y →x+z < y+z)
OK2:
∀x,y
(0 < x ∧0 < y →0 < x·y);
and ﬁnally, in addition,
RK1 :
∀x ∃y
(x < 0 ∨x .= y2)
RK2n:
∀x0,x1,...,x2n ∃y y2n+1 +x2n ·y2n +···+x1 ·y+x0 .= 0.
In RK1 and RK2n (where n = 1,2,...), the (informal) expression ym, for m = 1,2,...,
abbreviates the term y · y · ··· · y, the m-fold product of y.5 And in RK2n we utilize
the convention in algebra that the operation · is performed before the operation +,
unless parentheses indicate otherwise. A model of the axioms K1–K9, O1–O3, OK1
and OK2 is called an ordered ﬁeld. If the axioms RK1 and RK2n join in (for all
n ≥1), then one speaks of a real closed ﬁeld. The reason for this name is the fact
(to be proved in Section 4.2) that the theory of real closed ﬁelds is complete, and R
is a model of it. It is easy to see that RK1 and RK2n hold in R, by reﬂecting on the
fact that a polynomial with real coefﬁcients that has a sign-change in R also has a
zero in R, by the intermediate-value theorem for continuous functions.
7. Algebraically closed ﬁelds
We wish to close out the round of structures for whose theories we explicitly give
an axiom system, by considering the ﬁeld
C =

C; +C, −C, ·C; 0C, 1C
5 More precisely, this term should be written as (···((y·y)·y)····)·y, since the arity of · is 2. No
ambiguity will result from dropping these parentheses, thanks to K5.

1.6 Axiomatization of Several Mathematical Theories
53
of complex numbers. C satisﬁes not only the ﬁeld axioms K1–K9, but also the family
of axioms
AKn:
∀x0,x1,...,xn ∃y
yn+1 +xn ·yn +···+x0 .= 0,
(1.6.1.3)
for n = 1,2,.... The satisfaction of AKn by C is equivalent to the “Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra”, which asserts that every non-constant polynomial with co-
efﬁcients in C has a zero in C. Fields that satisfy AKn for all n ≥1 are called
algebraically closed ﬁelds. The axiom system for algebraically closed ﬁelds is not
yet complete. But, as we shall show in Chapter 3, it will become complete as soon
as we specify the characteristic of the ﬁeld, i.e. when we adjoin as further axioms
either, for some single prime number p, the sentence
Cp:
p1 .= 0
(1.6.1.4)
(where p1 again denotes the p-fold sum 1+···+1), or the set
{¬Cq | q ∈N, q prime}.
In the latter case one obtains a complete axiomatization of the theory of C.
8. The natural numbers
For all hitherto considered structures A, we were able to give an axiom system
Σ ⊆Sent(L) that, ﬁrst, axiomatized Th(A) (i.e. had the property that Ded(Σ) =
Th(A)), and, second, was “decidable”. This should mean that there is an effective
procedure that allows us, for an arbitrary, given L-sentence α, to decide whether α
is an axiom in Σ or not. A glance at the various axiom systems we have given will
easily convince the reader of the truth of this statement.
As we shall explain in Appendix A, there can be no decidable system of axioms
for the structure
N =

N; +N, ·N; 0N, 1N
.
This means, in other words, that every “decidable” system Σ ⊆Sent(L) of sentences
that hold in N must necessarily be incomplete. One such system is the following:
P1:
∀x
x+1 ̸= 0
P2:
∀x,y
(x+1 .= y+1 →x .= y)
P3:
∀x
x+0 .= x
P4:
∀x,y
x+(y+1) .= (x+y)+1
P5:
∀x
x·0 .= 0
P6:
∀x,y
x·(y+1) .= x·y+x
Pϕ:
ϕ(v0/0) ∧∀v0 (ϕ(v0/v0) →ϕ(v0/v0 +1)) →∀v0 ϕ(v0/v0).
The axiom system

54
1 First-Order Logic
ΣPA = {P1,...,P6}∪{∀Pϕ | ϕ ∈Fml(L)}
is usually called the system of Peano axioms of arithmetic. The fact that ∀Pϕ holds
in N simply means that for every evaluation h in N, the set

a ∈N
 N |= ϕ

h

v0
a

has the following property: if 0 belongs to this set, and if whenever n belongs to it,
so does n+1, then every natural number belongs to it.
9. Set theory
Finally, we wish to present an axiom system for set theory – in fact, for Zermelo–
Fraenkel set theory. The underlying language L has (as in our ﬁrst axiom system
above, namely, in the case of orderings) only one, single relation symbol, of arity
2, which we write here as ε .6 The following axioms are oriented toward the mem-
bership relation between sets. In order to prevent the axioms from becoming too
unreadable, we shall at times introduce common abbreviations:
ZF1:
Axiom of extensionality
∀x,y (∀z(z ε x ↔z ε y) →x .= y)
If we write x ⊆y for ∀z(z ε x →z ε y), then ZF1 is clearly equivalent to
∀x,y (x ⊆y ∧y ⊆x →x .= y).
ZF1 says that two sets possessing the same elements are equal.
ZF2:
Null set axiom
∃x ∀z ¬z ε x.
This axiom says that a set possessing no elements exists.
ZF3:
Pair set axiom
∀u,v ∃x ∀z (z ε x ↔(z .= u ∨z .= v))
ZF4:
Union set axiom
∀u ∃x ∀z (z ε x ↔∃v(v ε u ∧z ε v))
6 Note the distinction between the symbol ε, which belongs to the object language of set theory,
and the symbol ∈, which we reserve for the metalanguage.

1.6 Axiomatization of Several Mathematical Theories
55
ZF5:
Power set axiom
∀u ∃x ∀z (z ε x ↔z ⊆u)
These last four axioms assert the existence of certain sets x. By ZF1, each of these
sets is uniquely determined, though in the case of ZF3–ZF5, x depends on one or
two other sets (or “parameters”) u and v. The x in ZF2, ZF3, ZF4 and ZF5 is usually
“denoted” by /0 (the “empty set” or “null set”), {u,v}, u and P(u), respectively.
This means that one adjoins to the language names (i.e. a constant symbol in the
case of ZF2, and function symbols in the cases of ZF3–ZF5) for these uniquely de-
termined objects. This corresponds exactly to the usual progression in mathematics;
it contributes to a faster and better understanding of formulae. But it is, in principle,
not necessary. Instead of using the name of such a set, one could simply utilize a
uniquely characterizing property of it, as follows.
Let ψ be a formula in which x occurs free, and for which we can prove from the
axioms that ψ holds for exactly one x (though possibly depending on other variables
occurring free in ψ, as mentioned above). For this uniquely determined set we in-
troduce a new symbol, such as /0 or {u,v}, as above. But we do not adjoin this new
symbol to the language of set theory – the ε-language. Then, if ϕ is an ε-formula
with free variable y, we shall write ϕ(y//0) to stand for the following ε-formula:
∃x (ψ(x) ∧ϕ(y/x)),
where ψ(x) is the formula ∀z ¬z ∈x. Here we assume that x is free for y in ϕ;
otherwise, instead of x we would utilize some variable that occurs in neither ψ nor
ϕ. In the case of {u,v}, ψ would be ∀z (z ε x ↔(z .= u ∨z .= v)). As the last example
shows, ψ can have, besides x, additional free variables, as mentioned above. In the
following axioms we shall make use of these abbreviations.
From the previous axioms it follows that if x and y are sets, then so are {x,x} and
{x,y}. In the case of {x,x} we also write {x}, and in the case of {x,y} we also
write x∪y. Furthermore, it is customary to write x′ for x∪{x}. Now the next axiom
can be formulated using these notations:
ZF6:
Inﬁnity axiom
∃x (/0 ε x ∧∀z(z ε x →z′ ε x)).
This axiom ensures the existence of an inﬁnite set. This set is, however, not uniquely
determined.
The next axiom says that the image of a set under a function is again a set.
Here the function is described (implicitly) by a formula ϕ, in which the variables
u and v occur free. Here and elsewhere we shall use notation such as ϕ(u,v) to
emphasize the possibility that u and v occur free in ϕ; this notation does not exclude
the possibility that other variables might also occur free in ϕ.

56
1 First-Order Logic
ZF7:
Replacement axiom
∀y

∀u

u ε y →∃=1v ϕ(u,v)

→∃x∀v(v ε x ↔∃u(u ε y∧ϕ(u,v)))

.
Thus x is the image of y under the mapping described by ϕ. By ZF1, this x is
uniquely determined. If ψ is a formula in which the variable v occurs free, then
the abbreviation ∃=1v ψ(v), used in ZF7 above, stands for
∃v (ψ(v) ∧∀u(ψ(v/u) →u .= v)),
where u is a variable not occurring in ψ.
The last axiom of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory is usually
ZF8:
Foundation axiom
∀x (x ̸= /0 →∃z(z ε x ∧z∩x .= /0)).
Here the notation z∩x (for “intersection”) denotes a set whose existence is proved
using ZF7, and whose uniqueness is guaranteed by ZF1.
Usually the so-called Axiom of Choice is added to the above ZF-axioms; we
present it in the following form.
ZF9:
Axiom of Choice
∀y,u

u ⊆P(y)∧∀z1,z2 (z1 ε u∧z2 ε u →z1 ̸= /0∧(z1 .= z2 ∨z1 ∩z2 .= /0))
→∃x (x ⊆y∧∀z(z ε u →∃vx∩z .= {v}))

.
This axiom says that to every system u of nonempty, pairwise disjoint subsets of
a given set y, there exists a “system x of representatives”, i.e. x contains, for every
element z of u, exactly one element v ε z, the representative for z.7
By consulting the appropriate literature (e.g. [Levy, 1979–2002]), the reader
should be able to convince himself that the entirety of mathematics may actually
be built up in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.

Hint: First consider prime formulae ϕ of the form t .= x, with t a term and x a variable, and
deﬁne ϕ′ recursively according to the construction of t. Then we deﬁne the assignment ϕ →ϕ′

Chapter 2
Model Constructions
In this chapter we shall introduce various methods for the construction of models
of an axiom system Σ of sentences in a formal language L. In Chapter 1 we have
already encountered a method, in the form of the so-called term-models, for obtain-
ing at least one model of Σ. Having presented that “absolute” construction, we shall
now present a series of “relative” constructions. These relative methods allow us to
start with one or more given models of Σ, and to produce a new model. The methods
considered here do not (as often occurs in mathematics) depend on the particular ax-
iom system Σ (e.g. the direct product of groups is again a group, while the analogue
of this for ﬁelds does not hold); rather, our methods will work in every case. This
will be guaranteed by the fact that an L-structure A′ obtained by these methods from
an L-structure A is elementarily equivalent to A; i.e.
every L-sentence ϕ that holds in A also holds in A′, and conversely.
(2.0.0.1)
Therefore, if A is a model of Σ, then so is A′, independent of which axiom system
Σ ⊆Sent(L) we are working with.
Elementary equivalence between two L-structures A and A′ (written A ≡A′) is
obviously an equivalence relation on the class of all L-structures; i.e. for L-structures
A, A′, A′′ we have:
A ≡A
A ≡A′
implies
A′ ≡A
A ≡A′ and A′ ≡A′′
imply
A ≡A′′.
For L-structures A and A′, we shall introduce the notion of an L-isomorphism,
A ∼= A′, generalizing the usual concept of isomorphism in algebra. We shall see that
isomorphism always entails elementary equivalence, i.e.
A ∼= A′
implies
A ≡A′,

while the converse is false in general. For “ﬁnite” L-structures (i.e. those whose uni-
verse is ﬁnite), the converse always holds, but not for inﬁnite ones. We shall see that
the ≡-equivalence class of an inﬁnite L-structure contains L-structures of arbitrarily
large cardinality. (Observe that isomorphism, by contrast, naturally implies equality
of cardinality of the universes.)
The set-theoretic concepts used in this part of the book can be found in any book
on set theory (e.g. [Levy, 1979–2002]). We denote the cardinal number of a set A by
card(A).
2.1 Term Models
Let L = (λ,μ,K) be a formal language, as introduced in Section 1.2. We call the
cardinal number
κL := max{ℵ0, card(I), card(J), card(K)}
(2.1.0.1)
the cardinality of the language L. If A is an L-structure, then the cardinality of A
will be understood to be the cardinality of the universe |A| of A.
Our goal in this section is to prove the following theorem:
Theorem 2.1.1. If the set Σ ⊆Sent(L) of sentences has a model of inﬁnite cardinal-
ity, then for every cardinal number κ ≥κL, Σ has a model of cardinality κ.
Before we prove this theorem, we wish to make some preliminary observations.
For a language L = (λ,μ,K) with arity-functions λ : I →N and μ : J →N, we
have
card( Tm (L)) = max{ℵ0, card(J), card(K)}
(2.1.1.1)
card(Sent(L)) = card(Fml(L)) = κL.
(2.1.1.2)
These follow from the well-known fact that the set of all ﬁnite sequences with values
in an inﬁnite set M has the same cardinality as M. For (2.1.1.1) we apply this fact to
the set
M := Vbl∪{ f j | j ∈J }∪{ck | k ∈K }∪{,}∪{)}∪{(},
whose cardinality is just max{ℵ0, card(J), card(K)}. Now (2.1.1.1) follows, since,
on the one hand, every term is a ﬁnite sequence from M (proving ≤in (2.1.1.1)),
and, on the other hand, every vn, every ck, and every f j(v0,...,v0) (for j ∈J) is a
term (proving ≥).
For (2.1.1.2) we apply the above-mentioned fact to the set
M := Tm(L)∪{Ri | i ∈I }∪{¬}∪{∧}∪{∀}∪{ .=}∪{,}∪{)}∪{(},
whose cardinality is just κL, by (2.1.1.1) and (2.1.0.1). On the one hand, Sent(L) ⊆
Fml(L), and every formula is a ﬁnite sequence of elements of M. From this we get

2.1 Term Models
63
card(Sent(L)) ≤card(Fml(L)) ≤κL.
On the other hand, ∀t .= t and ∀v0 Ri(v0,...,v0) (for i ∈I) are sentences in L, from
which we get
κL ≤card(Sent(L)).
⊓⊔
Using these observations we now wish to give an upper bound on the cardinality
of the term model constructed (in Section 1.4) from a set Σ ⊆Sent(L) of sentences.
Thus, we must bound the cardinality of the set
CT/≈
of equivalence classes of constant terms in the extended language L′ (1.4.5.4). Since
card(CT/≈) ≤card(Tm(L′)) ≤κL′,
by (2.1.1.1), it sufﬁces to calculate κL. Recall (1.4.3.2) that the language L′ was
constructed as the union of an ascending chain
L = L0 ⊆L1 ⊆··· ⊆Ln−1 ⊆Ln ⊆···
of languages. If we can succeed in showing that
κLn ≤κL
(2.1.1.3)
for every n ∈N, then we will obviously have κL′ ≤κL and thus κL′ = κL. We obtain
(2.1.1.3) by induction on n. For n = 0 it is trivial. If it holds for n −1, then it also
holds for n: the language Ln is constructed from Ln−1 by expanding the index set
Kn−1 by a set Mn, which is equipotent to a subset of Sent(Ln−1) (recall (1.4.3.1)).
Therefore
κLn ≤max{κLn−1, card(Mn)} ≤κLn−1 ≤κL,
using (2.1.1.2). We have proved:
card(CT/≈) ≤κL.
⊓⊔
(2.1.1.4)
We are now in a position to give the proof of Theorem 2.1.1.
Proof (of Theorem 2.1.1):
Starting with the given language L and any cardinal
number κ ≥κL, we deﬁne an extension language Lκ by
Iκ = I,
Jκ = J,
Kκ = K ∪{ν | ν < κ },
where we assume the last union is disjoint. An Lκ-structure is then an L-structure
together with the interpretations of the new constant symbols cν for ν < κ.
In the language Lκ we consider the set of sentences
Σκ := Σ ∪{cν ̸= cμ | ν < μ < κ }.

64
2 Model Constructions
This set is consistent by the Finiteness Theorem 1.5.6: every ﬁnite subset Π of Σκ
is contained in a set of the form
Σ ∪{cν1 ̸= cμ1,...,cνn ̸= cμn},
for various ordinal numbers νi < μi < κ, i = 1,2,...,n. This set has a model, since
by hypothesis Σ has an inﬁnite model A. Indeed, it sufﬁces to adjoin to A an in-
terpretation of the new constant symbols cν, for ν < κ, in such a way that for
i = 1,...,n, the two constant symbols cνi and cμi are interpreted differently. This
is possible, since the universe |A| is inﬁnite.
Now we let A′ be the term model constructed from Σκ and Lκ (rather than from
Σ and L, respectively) in (1.5.2.2) (actually, the main steps of the construction were
presented already in Section 1.4). Then A′ is an L-structure together with interpreta-
tions of the constant symbols cν (for ν < κ) as well as of the new constant symbols
arising in the passage from Lκ to L′ in (the proof of) Theorem 1.4.2. The restriction
B of A′ to the language Lκ, which is obtained simply by dropping the interpreta-
tions of the additional constant symbols, is then clearly a model of Σ. It remains to
prove that |B| has cardinality κ.
Since A′ is a model of {cν ̸= cμ | ν < μ < κ }, the interpretation
cν →cA′
ν
induces an injection from {cν | ν < κ }, and thus from {ν | ν < κ }, into the universe
of A′, which is at the same time the universe of B. Therefore
κ ≤card(|B|).
(2.1.1.5)
On the other hand,
card(|B|) ≤κLκ
by (2.1.1.4)
= max{ℵ0,card(I),card(J),card(K ∪{ν | ν < κ }}
≤max{κL,κ} = κ.
(2.1.1.6)
From (2.1.1.5) and (2.1.1.6) we obtain card(|B|) = κ.
⊓⊔
From this theorem we obtain easily that the ≡-equivalence class of any inﬁnite
L-structure A contains L-structures of arbitrarily large cardinality. To prove this,
simply consider the following set of L-sentences:
Th(A) = {ϕ ∈Sent(L) | A |= ϕ }.
(2.1.1.7)
Th(A) was in (1.6.0.1) called the L-theory of A. Every model B of Th(A) is obvi-
ously elementarily equivalent to A (2.0.0.1). Indeed, from A |= ϕ follows ϕ ∈Th(A)
and hence B |= ϕ. Conversely, from A ̸|= ϕ follows naturally ¬ϕ ∈Th(A) and
hence B ̸|= ϕ. Now applying Theorem 2.1.1 to the set Σ = Th(A), we get

2.2 Morphisms of Structures
65
Corollary 2.1.2. For every L-structure A of inﬁnite cardinality, and for every cardi-
nal number κ ≥κL, there is an L-structure B of cardinality κ that is elementarily
equivalent to A.
⊓⊔
As we show in the next section, this has the consequence that no inﬁnite L-
structure can be characterized, up to isomorphism, by means of an axiom system
Σ ⊆Sent(L).
2.2 Morphisms of Structures
Given two L-structures A and A′, we call a mapping τ : |A| →|A′| an L-isomorphism
(or simply an isomorphism, if the language is clear) if the following conditions are
satisﬁed:
(I1)
τ : |A| →|A′| is bijective;
(I2)
RA
i (a1,...,aλ(i)) ⇔RA′
i (τ(a1),...,τ(aλ(i)))
for all i ∈I and for all a1,...,aλ(i) ∈|A|;
(I3)
τ

f A
j (a1,...,aμ(j)

= f A′
j (τ(a1),...,τ(aμ(j)))
for all j ∈J and for all a1,...,aμ(j) ∈|A|;
(I4)
τ

cA
k

= cA′
k for all k ∈K.
If all of these conditions are fulﬁlled, then we also write
τ : A ↔A′,
for short. If τ : |A| →|A′| fulﬁls conditions (I2), (I3) and (I4), and is injective
(but not necessarily surjective), then we speak of an (L-)monomorphism or an
(L-)embedding, and we write
τ : A →A′.
If there is an isomorphism between A and A′, then we call A and A′ (L-)isomorphic,
and we write
A ∼= A′.
If there is an embedding from A into A′, then we call A (L-)embeddable in A′, and
we write
A →A′.
An isomorphism from A to itself is usually called an (L-)automorphism.
For later reference we remark that we can bring conditions (I3) and (I4) into a
form analogous to that of (I2), namely:

66

(I′
3)
f A
j (a1,...,aμ(j)) = d
implies
f A′
j (τ(a1),...,τ(aμ(j))) = τ(d),
for all j ∈J and a1,...,aμ(j),d ∈|A|;
(I′
4)
cA
k = d
implies
cA′
k = τ(d)
for all k ∈K and d ∈|A|.
The equivalence with (I3) and (I4) is immediately clear. The reason that an implica-
tion sufﬁces here (in contrast to the equivalence needed in (I2)) is that the d in (I′
3),
for example, is already uniquely determined by the arguments a1,...,aμ(j).
Theorem 2.2.1. Let A and A′ be L-structures, and τ : A ↔A′ an isomorphism. Then
for every L-formula ϕ and every evaluation h in A,
A |= ϕ [h]
iff
A′ |= ϕ [τ ◦h].
(2.2.1.1)
In particular, A and A′ are elementarily equivalent.
Proof: Since h is an evaluation in A, τ ◦h is an evaluation in A′. Set h′ = τ ◦h. We
begin by proving, for terms t ∈Tm(L),
τ

tA [h]

= tA′ [h′],
(2.2.1.2)
by induction on the construction of t: When t is a constant symbol ck, (2.2.1.2) is
just the condition (I4). When t is a variable x, (2.2.1.2) is trivial, in view of
τ

xA [h]

= τ(h(x)) = h′(x) = xA′ [h′].
When t is f j(t1,...,tμ(j)) we prove (2.2.1.2) as follows:
τ(f j(t1,...,tμ(j)))A [h] =

by ind. hyp. (2.2.1.2)
=
f j(t1,...,tμ(j))A′ [h′]
by (1.5.0.4).
We can now prove (2.2.1.1) by induction on the construction of the formula ϕ. For
the atomic formula t1 .= t2 we have:
A |= t1 .= t2 [h]
iff
tA
1 [h] = tA
2 [h]
by (1.5.0.5)
iff

1 [h′] = tA′
2 [h′]
by (2.2.1.2)
iff
A′ |= t1 .= t2 [h′]
by (1.5.0.5).
For the atomic formula Ri(t1,...,tλ(i)) we have:

2.2 Morphisms of Structures

A |= Ri(t1,...,tλ(i))[h] iff

by (2.2.1.2)
iff
A′ |= Ri(t1,...,tλ(i))[h′]
by (1.5.0.6).
For the formula ¬ψ we have:
A |= ¬ψ [h]
iff
A ̸|= ψ [h]
by (1.5.0.7)
iff
A′ ̸|= ψ [h′]
by ind. hyp. (2.2.1.1)
iff
A′ |= ¬ψ [h′]
by (1.5.0.7).
For the formula (ψ1 ∧ψ2) we have, analogously:
A |= (ψ1 ∧ψ2)[h]
iff (A |= ψ1 [h ] and A |= ψ2 [h ])
by (1.5.0.8)
iff (A′ |= ψ1 [h′] and A′ |= ψ2 [h′])
by ind. hyp. (2.2.1.1)
iff
A′ |= (ψ1 ∧ψ2)[h′]
by (1.5.0.8).
Finally, in the case of a formula ∀xψ we have:
A |= ∀xψ [h]
iff
A |= ψ

h′ x

for all a′∈|A′| τ surjective (I1)
iff
A′ |= ∀xψ [h′]
by (1.5.0.9).
This completes the proof of (2.2.1.1).
To prove the ﬁnal claim of the theorem, that A ≡A′, recall that if ϕ is a sen-
tence, then the satisfaction of ϕ in A does not depend on the evaluation h consid-
ered (1.5.1.3). Thus (2.2.1.1) implies that for any L-sentence ϕ, A |= ϕ if and only
if A′ |= ϕ, which is the deﬁnition of A ≡A′.
⊓⊔
We have thus proved that for L-structures A and A′:
A ∼= A′
implies
A ≡A′.
(2.2.1.3)
A condition for the converse of (2.2.1.3) to hold will be given in Theorem 2.2.3
below. But ﬁrst we wish to make a remark on the proof of Theorem 2.2.1.
Remark 2.2.2 Let τ : |A| →|A′| be a mapping from A into A′. If τ is a monomor-
phism, then for every quantiﬁer-free formula ϕ and every evaluation h in A, we
have:
A |= ϕ [h]
iff
A′ |= ϕ [τ ◦h].
(2.2.2.1)

68
2 Model Constructions
Conversely, if (2.2.2.1) holds for all quantiﬁer-free formulae ϕ, then τ is a monomor-
phism.
Proof: Since, in the proof of Theorem 2.2.1, the surjectivity of τ was used only in
the last case, where ϕ was of the form ∀xψ, it is clear that (2.2.2.1) holds for all
formulae ϕ in whose recursive construction no quantiﬁer ∀x is used. These are just
the quantiﬁer-free formulae.
Conversely, if we assume (2.2.2.1) for all quantiﬁer-free ϕ, and apply it (with a
suitable evaluation h) to the quantiﬁer-free formulae
Ri(v1,...,vλ(i))
for i ∈I,
f j(v1,...,vμ(j)) .= v0
for j ∈J, and
ck .= v0
for k ∈K,
then one obtains conditions (I2), (I′
3), and (I′
4), respectively. Finally, applying it to
the formula
v0 ̸= v1
gives the injectivity of τ.
⊓⊔
Theorem 2.2.3. The L-structures of ﬁnite cardinality, and only those, can be “char-
acterized” up to L-isomorphism; i.e. there is a set Σ ⊆Sent(L) such that for every
L-structure A′:
A′ |= Σ
iff
A′ ∼= A.
(2.2.3.1)
Proof: First assume that A is inﬁnite. If there were a set Σ ⊆Sent(L) such that
for all A′, (2.2.3.1) holds, then, in particular, Σ ⊆Th(A). Now, since A is inﬁnite,
Corollary 2.1.2 implies that there is an elementarily equivalent A′ with some cardi-
nality κ > card(|A|). Therefore A′ |= Th(A), and, a fortiori, A′ |= Σ, but A′ ̸∼= A,
disproving (2.2.3.1).
Second, assume A is ﬁnite, i.e. the universe |A| is ﬁnite – say, of cardinality n.
We begin by considering the case where the index sets I, J and K (1.2.0.1)–
(1.2.0.3) of L are likewise ﬁnite. In this case we shall ﬁnd a single sentence α ∈
Th(A) such that for all L-structures A′,
A′ |= α
implies
A ∼= A′.
(2.2.3.2)
Our sentence α will be the conjunction of two L-sentences, each of which holds in
A. As the ﬁrst conjunct, we wish to take a sentence that ensures that |A′| has no
more elements than |A|. For this, we use the cardinality-sentence α≤n, deﬁned as
∃v1,...,vn ∀v0 (v0 .= v1 ∨···∨v0 .= vn).
(2.2.3.3)
If α≤n holds in A′, then |A′| obviously has at most n elements. Now let a1,...,an be
the elements of |A|. Fix an evaluation h in A with h(vi) = ai for i = 1,2,...,n. We
consider the set Φ of all formulae that, on the one hand, hold in A under h, and, on
the other hand, are of one of the following ﬁve types:

2.2 Morphisms of Structures
69
x0 ̸= x1
Ri(x1,...,xλ(i))
with
i ∈I
¬Ri(x1,...,xλ(i))
with
i ∈I
f j(x1,...,xμ(j)) .= x0
with
j ∈J
ck .= x0
with
k ∈K,
for any x0,x1,... ∈{v1,...,vn}. One sees easily that Φ is a ﬁnite set. Write Φ for
the conjunction of all formulae in Φ. We claim that the desired sentence α is then
(α≤n ∧∃v1,...,vn

Φ).
If α holds in A′, then, ﬁrst, |A′| has at most n elements, and, second, there is an
evaluation h′ in A′ such that for each ϕ ∈Φ, A′ |= ϕ [h′], by (1.5.0.11) and (1.5.0.8).
If we now set τ(ai) = h′(vi) for i = 1,2,...,n, then we get a mapping
τ : |A| →|A′|
such that for each formula ϕ of one of the ﬁve types above,
A |= ϕ [h]
implies
A′ |= ϕ [τ ◦h],
(2.2.3.4)
since on the free variables of ϕ, the evaluations h′ and τ ◦h agree with each other.
But (2.2.3.4) has as consequences exactly the injectivity of τ and the conditions (I2),
(I′
3), and (I′
4). Therefore τ is a monomorphism of A into A′. And since |A′| has at
most n elements, τ is even an isomorphism.
Finally, we consider the case of arbitrary index sets I, J and K. We claim that we
may take Σ in (2.2.3.1) to be Th(A). For this, assume A′ is a model of Th(A). Then
since α≤n ∈Th(A), |A′| has at most n elements. And since
∃x1,...,xn

i< j
xi ̸= x j
	
∈Th(A),
|A′| has at least n elements. Thus there are exactly n! bijections from |A| onto |A′|;
we denote them by τ1,...,τn!. Suppose, for the sake of a contradiction, that none
of these bijections is an L-isomorphism. Then for every ν ≤n!, there is at least one
index i ∈I or j ∈J or k ∈K such that one of the conditions (I2), (I3), or (I4) is
violated for τν. For each ν, ﬁx one such “troublesome index”. Altogether we ﬁx at
most n! troublesome indices; they lie in certain ﬁnite subsets I1 of I, J1 of J and K1 of
K. These subsets determine a sublanguage L1 of L. Let A1 and A′
1 be the restrictions
of the L-structures A and A′, respectively, to the language L1 (they result from A and
A′ simply by dropping the interpretations of Ri for i ∈I \I1, of f j for j ∈J \J1 and
of ck for k ∈K \ K1). By (2.2.3.2) there is an L1-isomorphism τ : A1 ↔A′
1. Since
|A| = |A1| and |A′| = |A′
1|, τ must coincide with one of the mappings τν. But then τ
could not be an L1-isomorphism of A1 onto A′
1, since τν’s troublesome index lies in

70
2 Model Constructions
I1, J1 or K1. This contradiction shows that (at least) one of the mappings τ1,...,τn!
must, indeed, be an L-isomorphism of A onto A′.
⊓⊔
Now we would like to introduce a suggestive notation for A |= ϕ [h], which
makes use of the fact (Lemma 1.5.1(b)) that the satisfaction of a formula ϕ in A
under an evaluation h depends only on the values of h at the free variables of ϕ. If
Fr(ϕ) ⊆{v0,...,vn} and a0,...,an ∈|A|, then we wish to write simply
A |= ϕ [a0,...,an]
for A |= ϕ [h], where h is any evaluation in A with aν = h(vν) for ν = 0,1,...,n.
And for A |= ϕ

h
x
a

we write
A |= ϕ [a0,...,an,
x
a

].
Using this notation, the conclusion (2.2.1.1) of Theorem 2.2.1 may now be ex-
pressed as follows: for every L-formula ϕ with Fr(ϕ) ⊆{v0,...,vn} and all a0,...,
an ∈|A|,
A |= ϕ [a0,...,an]
iff
A′ |= ϕ [τ(a0),...,τ(an)].
2.3 Substructures
In this section we shall become acquainted with a “relative” construction method
that goes back to L¨owenheim and Skolem. It allows us to construct, from any inﬁnite
L-structure A, a so-called elementary substructure B that satisﬁes certain secondary
conditions. B will, in particular, be elementarily equivalent to A. But ﬁrst to the
deﬁnitions of “substructure” and “elementary substructure”!
An L-structure B is called a substructure of an L-structure A if |B| ⊆|A| and the
inclusion mapping id : |B| →|A| is an embedding. This means that for a1,a2,... ∈
|B| we have:
RB
i (a1,...) iff RA
i (a1,...)
for
i ∈I
f B
j (a1,...) = f A
j (a1,...)
for
j ∈J
cB
k = cA
k
for
k ∈K.
If B is a substructure of A, then A is also called an extension structure of B; we
write B ⊆A for this.
For a substructure B of A, the subset B := |B| of |A| has the following properties:
(i) B is closed under the functions f A
j ;
i.e. for all a1,...,aμ(j) ∈B, f B
j (a1,...,aμ(j)) ∈B;
(ii) the A-interpretations cA
k of the constant symbols lie in B; i.e. cA
k ∈B.

is clearly also an L-structure, and indeed a substructure of A, called the substructure
of A deﬁned by B. Here RA
i |B and f A
j |B are the restrictions to B of the relations RA
i
and the functions f A
j .
Let us brieﬂy consider an example. Let
R :=

R; +, ·, −; 0⟩,
where +, ·, and −are understood as (the usual) 2-place operations on R, and 0 and
1 have their usual meaning. Then the subset of integers Z ⊆R deﬁnes, by (2.3.0.1),
a substructure of R. The subset of natural numbers N does not deﬁne a substructure,
since it is not closed under subtraction (i). The subset 2Z of even integers likewise
does not deﬁne a substructure, since it does not contain the number 1 (ii).
A substructure B of A is called an elementary substructure if for all L-formulae
ϕ and all evaluations h in B, we have
B |= ϕ [h]
iff
A |= ϕ [h].
(2.3.0.2)
If B is an elementary substructure of A, then we write B ⪯A. Obviously,
B ⪯A
implies
B ≡A.
The converse of this does not hold, as the following example shows. Let N+ =
N\{0}. Then
⟨N+; ≤⟩⊆⟨N; ≤⟩,
where the two occurrences of the relation ≤are to be understood on their corre-
sponding domains. We have, in addition,
⟨N+; ≤⟩∼= ⟨N; ≤⟩,
where the isomorphism is given by a →a−1. Therefore, by Theorem 2.2.1,
⟨N+; ≤⟩≡⟨N; ≤⟩.
The substructure ⟨N+; ≤⟩of ⟨N; ≤⟩is, however, not an elementary substructure,
since, under any evaluation h with h(v0) = 1, the formula ∀v1 v0 ≤v1 holds in
⟨N+; ≤⟩, but not in ⟨N; ≤⟩.
The following sufﬁcient condition for the elementary substructure relation easily
yields
⟨Q; <⟩⪯⟨R; <⟩.
Lemma 2.3.1. Let B be a substructure of A. If, to every ﬁnite set of elements
a1,...,am ∈|B| and every a ∈|A| there is an automorphism τ of A with τ(ai) = ai
for i = 1,2,...,m and τ(a) ∈|B|, then B is an elementary substructure of A.

Proof: We show by induction on the recursive construction of formulae that
(2.3.0.2) holds for all formulae ϕ and all evaluations h in B. This proof is com-
pletely analogous to that of Theorem 2.2.1, upon taking the A, A′, and τ : A ↔A′
in (2.2.1) to be B, B, and id : B ↔B (so that h′ = τ ◦h = h in (2.2.1)).1 The only
part of the induction step that is different here is the part where we assume that ϕ is
of the form ∀xψ. We separate this part of the proof of (2.3.0.2) into two cases:
Case 1: A |= ∀xψ [h]. Then we have A |= ψ

(2.3.1.1)
Let Fr(∀xψ) = {x1,...,xn} (p. 12) be the set of all the free variables in ∀xψ.

⊓⊔
Remark 2.3.2. A ﬁnite structure A cannot have a proper elementary extension B, as
every cardinality sentence α≤n carries over from A to B.
Just as the concept of a substructure can be understood as a special case of the
concept of an embedding, so also the concept of an elementary substructure can be
understood as a special case of an elementary embedding. An embedding τ : A →A′
of L-structures is called an elementary embedding if for every formula ϕ and every
evaluation h in A, we have
A |= ϕ [h]
iff
A′ |= ϕ [τ ◦h].
(2.3.2.1)
Applied to L-sentences ϕ, this implies, in particular, A ≡A′.
Now we come to the previously announced construction method of L¨owenheim
and Skolem.
Theorem 2.3.3. Let A be an L-structure with inﬁnite cardinality, and B0 a subset of
|A|. Then there is an elementary substructure B of A with B0 ⊆|B| and card(|B|) ≤
max{κL,card(B0)}. If, in addition, κL ≤card(B0), then card(|B|) = card(B0).
1 Note that the τ mentioned in the hypothesis of Lemma 2.3.1 plays no role at this stage of the
proof; it will appear only in “Case 2” below.

2.3 Substructures
73
Proof: If one examines the proof of Lemma 2.3.1, it becomes clear that one must
construct the universe B of B so that, ﬁrst, it deﬁnes a substructure of A, and, sec-
ond, for every “existence claim” in A (with parameters from B), an example can be
found in B. This will be guaranteed by the following construction.
For each existence formula ϕ of the form ∃xψ,2 let nϕ be the highest index of
a free variable of ϕ; if ϕ is a sentence, we set nϕ = −1. We deﬁne an (nϕ + 1)-
place function gϕ on A = |A| in the following way: if a0,...,anϕ ∈A and if h is an
evaluation with h(vi) = ai for 0 ≤i ≤nϕ,
let gϕ(a0,...,anϕ ) be an a ∈A with A |= ψ

h
x
a

,
if there is such an a, i.e. if A |= ∃xψ[h]. Otherwise, let
gϕ(a0,...,anϕ) = d0,
where d0 is an element of A that is ﬁxed for all existence formulae. Then we deﬁne
B =

m∈N
Bm,
(2.3.3.1)
where we set
Bm+1 = Bm∪

ϕ
gϕ

B
nϕ+1
m

.
(2.3.3.2)
The union in (2.3.3.2) runs over all existence formulae ϕ. And Dnϕ+1 denotes, as
usual, the (nϕ + 1)-fold Cartesian product of D; for nϕ = −1, D0 = /0. (A 0-place
function from D into D consists, as usual, of a single element d ∈D.)
We claim that the subset B constructed in (2.3.3.1) deﬁnes a substructure of A.
For this we must show that all cA
k lie in B, and B is closed under all functions f j. For
k ∈K we choose as our existence formula ϕ the formula ∃v0 v0 .= ck. There is an
a ∈A with A |= v0 .= ck

h
v0
a

for every evaluation h – namely, a = cA
k . Therefore
the 0-place function gϕ consists of such an a. However, since there is only one such
a, gϕ = cA
k . Therefore we have
cA
k = gϕ ∈B1 ⊆B.
For j ∈J we choose the existence formula ϕ to be
∃vμ(j) vμ(j) .= f j(v0,...,vμ(j)−1).
The arity of the function gϕ is then nϕ +1 = μ(j). If a0,...,anϕ ∈B, say a0,...,anϕ ∈
Bm, then we have, by construction,
aμ(j) = gϕ(a0,...,anϕ ) ∈Bm+1 ⊆B.
2 Note that this notion differs from that of an “∃-sentence” introduced Section 2.5.

Here aμ(j) is an element a in A with A |= vμ(j) .= f j(v0,...,vμ(j)−1)

, where
h is an evaluation with h(vi) = ai for 0 ≤i < μ(j). There is, however, exactly one
such a, namely, f A
j (a0,...,aμ(j)−1). It therefore follows that
f A
j (a0,...,aμ(j)−1) = gϕ(a0,...,anϕ ) ∈B.
We carry out the proof that the substructure B is an elementary substructure of
A again by induction on the construction of formulae, analogously to the proof
of Lemma 2.3.1. Here all that remains to show is that in the case of a “universal
formula” ∀xψ, its falsity (for an evaluation h in B) transfers from A to B. For this,
suppose A ̸|= ∀xψ [h]. Then we have A |= ϕ [h], where ϕ is the existence formula
∃x¬ψ. If, say,
h(v0),...,h(vnϕ) ∈Bm,
then, by construction,
a = gϕ(h(v0),...,h(vnϕ )) ∈Bm+1
is an element of B with A |= ¬ψ

h

a

. Now since h
x
a

is an evaluation in B, by the
induction hypothesis we obtain B |= ¬ψ

h
x
a

. Hence, in particular, B |= ¬ψ [h].
Thus the proof of B ̸|= ∀xψ [h] is achieved.
It remains to give an upper bound on B. We show
card(Bm) ≤max{κL,card(B0)} = κ;
the claim then follows with the usual cardinality estimates. For B0 this is clear. Let
us now assume that the upper bound above holds for Bm. Then
card(Bm+1) ≤max{κ,card(Fml(L))} = κ,
since every set gϕ

Bnϕ+1
m

of the union in (2.3.3.2), as well as Bm, has cardinality
≤κ, and the union is indexed with a subset of Fml(L).
⊓⊔
If one compares this construction, say, with the construction of the algebraic
closure of a ﬁeld F in an extension ﬁeld L of F, one easily recognizes the similarity.
In the ﬁeld case we arrange, by adjunction of roots of polynomials with coefﬁcients
in F, that certain existence sentences that hold in L hold also in the closure of F in
L – namely, precisely those sentences that assert the existence of a root. In the case
of the construction in Theorem 2.3.3, all existence sentences are considered.
Corollary 2.3.4. Let κL = ℵ0, i.e. let L be a countable language. Then every L-
structure A with inﬁnite cardinality possesses a countable elementary substructure
B. Moreover, every elementary substructure B of A is inﬁnite.
Proof: We choose B0 = /0 in Theorem 2.3.3. Then card(|B|) ≤ℵ0. |B|, however,
cannot be ﬁnite, since otherwise a cardinality-sentence α≤n (2.2.3.3) would hold in
B, which naturally fails in A.
⊓⊔

2.4 Elementary Extensions and Chains

2.4 Elementary Extensions and Chains
Let A and B be L-structures. B is called an elementary extension of A if A is an ele-
mentary substructure of B. This not so profound deﬁnition will serve as a transition
to another “relative” construction: from an L-structure A we shall construct an ele-
mentary extension. We shall see that it is useful to ﬁrst treat “constant extensions”
of a language L somewhat more systematically.
Let the language L := (λ,μ,K) be given (1.2.0.11). A constant extension of L
will be a language L′ = (λ,μ,K′), where K′ = K ∪K and K ∩K = /0 (recall that
such extensions were constructed in the proof of Theorem 1.4.2). The set K serves
as an index set for “new” constant symbols. An L′-structure A′ is an L-structure A
together with an interpretation
σ : K →|A|
of the new constant symbols. For k ∈K, cA′
k = σ(k). For this we also write
A′ = (A,σ);
we call A the restriction of A′ to L.
The next lemma will prove to be very useful:
Lemma 2.4.1. Let A′ = (A,σ) be an L′-structure, and ϕ an L-formula with Fr(ϕ) ⊆
{v0,...,vn}. Then for all k0,...,kn ∈K and for all evaluations h in A with h(vi) =
σ(ki) for 0 ≤i ≤n,
A |= ϕ [h]
iff
(A,σ) |= ϕ(v0/ck0,...,vn/ckn).
(2.4.1.1)
Proof: We prove this lemma by iterated application of Lemma 1.5.3 to A′. First,
for v0 we obtain, using h(v0) = cA′
k0 [h]:
A′ |= ϕ [h]
iff
A′ |= ϕ(v0/ck0)[h].
Iterating, we obtain, ﬁnally,
A′ |= ϕ [h]
iff
A′ |= ϕ(v0/ck0,...,vn/ckn)[h].
This, however, is equivalent to (2.4.1.1), since, on the one hand, ϕ is an L-formula,
and, on the other hand, ϕ(v0/ck0,...,vn/ckn) is an L′-sentence.
⊓⊔
An especially useful special case of a constant extension L′ of L presents itself
when L′ is constructed with reference to a given L-structure A, as follows: suppose
A′ is a subset of |A|. We assume that K ∩|A| = /0, and we set K = A′. In this case
we write a := ca for a ∈K. The canonical interpretation in A of the new constant
symbol a is, then, a itself; that is, we use a as a name for a. The canonical L′-
structure corresponding to A is then
(A,A′) := (A,idA′).

76
2 Model Constructions
In order to make explicit the dependence of this constant extension on A′, we also
write L(A′) for L′ in this case. If A′ = |A|, then every element a ∈|A| possesses
at least the name a in the language L(|A|). In this case, we write, brieﬂy, L(A) for
L(|A|). Then (2.4.1.1) can now be written as follows:
A |= ϕ [a0,...,an]
iff
(A,|A|) |= ϕ

v0/a0,...,vn/an

.
If A is an L-structure, then we deﬁne the diagram of A to be the set D(A) consist-
ing of those atomic L(A)-sentences and negated atomic L(A)-sentences that hold in
(A,|A|). The diagram of A is, therefore, a subset of the theory of (A,|A|) (2.1.1.7),
the latter consisting precisely of all L(A)-sentences that hold in (A,|A|).
Lemma 2.4.2 (Diagram Lemma). Let A be an L-structure, and (B,σ) an L(A)-
structure. If (B,σ) is a model of D(A), then σ is an L-embedding of A into B. If
(B,σ) is a model of Th(A,|A|), then σ is an elementary L-embedding of A into B.
Proof: By the deﬁnition of an embedding (recall the beginning of Section 2.2), we
must show that the mapping σ : |A| →|B| satisﬁes the conditions (I2), (I′
3) and (I′
4)
there, and is, moreover, injective.
The proof of the injectivity of σ goes as follows: if a1,a2 ∈|A| are unequal, then
the sentence a1 ̸= a2 belongs to the diagram D(A). Since (B,σ) is a model of D(A),
we have
(B,σ) |= a1 ̸= a2.
If one observes that the interpretation of ai in (B,σ) is just σ(ai), it follows that
σ(a1) ̸= σ(a2).
Now the proofs of (I′
3) and (I′
4) go completely analogously, by considering the
sentences f j

a1,...,aμ(j)
 .= d and ck .= d, respectively. For (I2), we utilize the sen-
tence Ri

a1,...,aλ(i)

if RA
i

a1,...,aλ(i)

holds, and the sentence ¬Ri

a1,...,aλ(i)

otherwise; together we then obtain:
RA
i

a1,...,aλ(i)

iff
RB
i

σ(a1),...,σ

aλ(i)

.
Therefore σ : |A| →|B| is an embedding if (B,σ) is a model of D(A).
If (B,σ) is a model of Th(A,|A|), then it is, in particular, a model of D(A).
Therefore σ is again an embedding. In order to show that σ is even an elementary
embedding of A into B, we consider an L-formula ϕ with Fr(ϕ) ⊆{v0,...,vn}, and
an evaluation h in A. We must then show:
A |= ϕ [h]
iff
B |= ϕ [σ ◦h].
For this it sufﬁces to prove
A |= ϕ [h] implies B |= ϕ [σ ◦h],
(2.4.2.1)
since we could then apply (2.4.2.1) to ¬ϕ, which would furnish us with the converse
of (2.4.2.1).

2.4 Elementary Extensions and Chains
77
We set ai = h(vi) for 0 ≤i ≤n. From A |= ϕ [h] we then obtain (A,|A|) |=
ϕ

v0/a0,...,vn/an

, by Lemma 2.4.1. Thus the sentence ϕ

v0/a0,...,vn/an

is an
element of Th(A,|A|), and thus holds in (B,σ). If we now apply Lemma 2.4.1 to
the evaluation σ ◦h in B, we ﬁnally obtain B |= ϕ [σ ◦h], since (σ ◦h)(vi) = σ(ai).
⊓⊔
If now A is an L-structure of inﬁnite cardinality, then we can apply Theo-
rem 2.1.1 to the set of L(A)-sentences Σ = Th(A,|A|), and obtain thereby a
model (B,σ) of Σ with cardinality κ, where κ is a prescribed cardinal number
≥κL(A) = max{κL,card(|A|)}. By Lemma 2.4.2, σ is an elementary embedding of
A into B. If we identify A with its σ-image in B, we have thus proved:
Theorem 2.4.3. Let A be an L-structure of inﬁnite cardinality. Then for every car-
dinal number κ ≥max{κL,card(|A|)}, there exists an elementary extension B of A
with cardinality κ.
⊓⊔
Besides this consequence of the second part of Lemma 2.4.2, we would like to
record two additional consequences of Lemma 2.4.2 that are very important for the
applications. First a consequence of the second part:
Corollary 2.4.4. Let A and B be L-structures, and τ : A →B an embedding. The
embedding τ is elementary if and only if (A,id|A|) ≡(B,τ). In particular, A ⪯B if
and only if (A,|A|) ≡(B,|A|).
Proof: Applying the second part of Lemma 2.4.2 to σ = τ, we get that τ is an
elementary embedding if (B,σ) is a model of Th(A,|A|). This last is equivalent to

A,id|A|

≡(B,τ).
Now, conversely, let τ be an elementary embedding, and ϕ′ an L(A)-sentence.
We can think of ϕ′ as arising from an L-formula ϕ by substitution of constant sym-
bols a0,...,an for the variables v0,...,vn:
ϕ′ = ϕ

v0/a0,...,vn/an

.
Of course, for this we use only variables vi that otherwise do not occur in ϕ′, in
order to perform the substitution without problems. Now if we have

A,id|A|

|=
ϕ′, then by Lemma 2.4.1, we get A |= ϕ [h] for every evaluation h with h(vi) =
ai. Since the embedding τ is, by hypothesis, elementary, we have B |= ϕ [τ ◦h];
using Lemma 2.4.1 again we get, ﬁnally, (B,τ) |= ϕ′. Since this holds for all L(A)-
sentences ϕ′, we obtain

A,id|A|

≡(B,τ).
⊓⊔
Next we would like to derive a consequence of the ﬁrst part of Lemma 2.4.2. For
this we introduce brieﬂy the substructure generated by a subset A′ of an L-structure
A.
It is easy to see that the intersection of arbitrarily many substructures of A is
again a substructure of A (unless it is empty). The universe of such an intersection
is deﬁned to be just the intersection of the universes of all those substructures. On

78
2 Model Constructions
this intersection (of the universes) we then consider the common restriction of all
relations and functions (under which, naturally, this intersection is closed). The in-
terpretation cA
k of each constant symbol lies in every substructure of A, and hence
in our intersection. If /0 ̸= A′ ⊆|A|, we deﬁne the substructure of A generated by A′
to be the intersection of all substructures of A whose universes include A′. Here we
can also allow A′ to be empty provided the language contains at least one constant
symbol. A ﬁnitely generated substructure of A is a substructure that is generated by
a ﬁnite subset A′ of |A|.
As a corollary to the ﬁrst part of Lemma 2.4.2, we now have:
Corollary 2.4.5. Let A be an L-structure, and Σ ⊆Sent(L). If every ﬁnitely gener-
ated substructure of A is embeddable in a model of Σ, then A is embeddable in a
model of Σ.
Proof: It sufﬁces to show that the set Σ ∪D(A) of L(A)-sentences has a model
(B,σ), for then, ﬁrst, B will be a model of Σ, and, second, σ will be an embedding
of A in B, by Lemma 2.4.2. By the Finiteness Theorem (1.5.6), it will now, in turn,
sufﬁce to show that every ﬁnite subset Π of Σ ∪D(A) has a model.
Such a set Π can contain only ﬁnitely many sentences δ1,...,δn of the diagram
D(A). Let the “new” constant symbols (i.e. the constant symbols not already in L)
occurring in the δi be a1,...,am, where each aj ∈|A|. Then the substructure A′ of
A generated by A′ := {a1,...,am} is a model of {δ1,...,δn}. By hypothesis there is
a model B of Σ and an embedding of A′ into B. After identiﬁcation, B is therefore
a model of Σ ∪{δ1,...,δn}, and hence, in particular, of Π.
⊓⊔
A further possible construction for elementary extensions, of which we shall
make extensive use in the next section, is based upon the concept of an elementary
chain of L-structures. We call a sequence (An)n∈N of L-structures an elementary
chain if An+1 is an elementary extension of An, for each n ∈N. We shall show that
the soon-to-be-deﬁned union structure 
n∈N An is an elementary extension of each
An. In a generalization of this situation, we shall consider not only sequences of
length ω, with order-type being that of the natural numbers, but also sequences of
length α, where α is an arbitrary ordinal number.
We call a sequence (Aν)ν<α of L-structures an α-chain if Aν ⊆Aμ holds for
ν < μ < α. The union structure of the chain (Aν)ν<α is the L-structure A deﬁned as
follows: we set |A| = 
ν<α |Aν|, and for i ∈I, j ∈J, k ∈K, and all a1,a2,... ∈|Aν|,
we deﬁne:
RA
i (a1,...,aλ(i)) ⇔RAν
i
(a1,...,aλ(i))
f A
j (a1,...,aμ(j)) = f Aν
j
(a1,...,aμ(j))
cA
k = cAν
k .
In view of Aν ⊆Aμ for μ < ν and μ < α, this is actually a correct deﬁnition, i.e. it
is independent of the index ν for which all the a1,a2,... lie in |Aν|. We also write

ν<α
Aν

2.4 Elementary Extensions and Chains

for the union structure A. Observe that in the case of a successor ordinal number
α = β +1, we have:

ν<α
Aν = Aβ;
(2.4.5.1)
i.e. in this case the union is exactly equal to the maximum member of the chain.
Theorem 2.4.6. Let α be an ordinal number, and (Aν)ν<α be an α-chain of L-
structures. Suppose Aβ ⪯Aβ+1 for β +1 < α, and Aλ = 
ν<λ Aν for limit ordinal
numbers λ < α. Then the union structure A = 
ν<α Aν is an elementary extension
of Aν for each ν < α. In particular, A0 ⪯A.
Observe that for the case of an ω-chain (An)n∈N, the hypothesis for the case of
limit ordinals is vacuously satisﬁed. Only the condition An ⪯An+1 remains.
Proof: We carry out an ordinal-induction proof on the length α of the chain. There
are three cases to distinguish.
α = 0: In this case both the chain and the claim are empty.
α = β +1: In this case the chain (Aν)ν<β is of shorter length, and still satisﬁes
the hypotheses of the theorem. By the inductive hypothesis, then, Aμ ⪯
ν<β Aν
for all μ < β. It therefore remains to show that 
ν<β Aν ⪯Aβ (= 
ν<α Aν, by
(2.4.5.1)), since, by the obvious transitivity of the elementary substructure rela-
tion, Aμ ⪯Aβ will then also hold. If β is a limit ordinal, then 
ν<β Aν = Aβ
by hypothesis. If β = γ + 1, then 
ν<β Aν = Aγ (2.4.5.1), and since γ + 1 < α,
Aγ ⪯Aγ+1 = Aβ, by hypothesis.
α is a limit ordinal: By the inductive hypothesis, we have Aμ ⪯Aν for μ < ν <
α. We must show Aμ ⪯A for μ < α. We prove this by proving, via induction on
the construction of ϕ ∈Sent(L), that for all μ < α and all evaluations h in Aμ:
Aμ |= ϕ [h]
iff
A |= ϕ [h].
As in the corresponding proofs in Section 2.3, this induction is purely routine up
until the case of the transfer of the falsity of a formula ∀xψ from A to Aμ under the
evaluation h. So let A ̸|= ∀xψ [h]. Then there is an a ∈|A| with A ̸|= ψ

. Let
Fr(ψ) ⊆{v0,...,vn} and ai = h(vi) for 0 ≤i ≤n. Since |A| is an increasing union,
a,a0,...,an lie already in a member |Aν| of this union, where we may assume, with-
out loss of generality, that μ ≤ν. For the simpler formula ψ and the evaluation h

this gives Aν ̸|= ∀xψ [h]. Using Aμ ⪯Aν we obtain, ﬁnally, Aμ ̸|= ∀xψ [h].
⊓⊔
We call an α-chain satisfying the hypothesis of Theorem 2.4.6 an elementary α-
chain. If an α-chain is not elementary, then the truth of a sentence in the members of
the chain does not in general transfer to the union. For especially simple sentences,
however, this is right.
Remark 2.4.7 Let α be an ordinal number, and (Aν)ν<α be an α-chain of L-
structures. If an ∀∃-sentence ϕ holds in each member Aν of the chain, then it holds
also in 
ν<α Aν = A.

Here, by an ∀∃-sentence we mean a sentence of the form ∀x1,...,xn ∃y1,...,ym ψ,
where ψ is quantiﬁer-free.
Proof: Let ϕ be of the given form. Further, let h be an evaluation in 
ν<α Aν,
and a1,...,an ∈
ν<α |Aν|, so that a1,...,an ∈|Aν| for a certain ν < α. Let h′ be
an evaluation in Aν with h′(xi) = ai for 1 ≤i ≤n. By hypothesis we have Aν |=

2.5 Saturated Structures
In this section we wish to introduce a concept that is fundamental to model theory:
the concept of a saturated structure. The existence (and in a certain sense unique-
ness) of saturated elementary extensions of a given, inﬁnite structure is very helpful
for the investigation of the theory. In the investigations in Chapter 3, we shall use

2.5 Saturated Structures
81
saturated structures only very rarely (the simplicity of the theories considered there
makes this unnecessary); however, we especially wish to point out their usefulness
in the investigation of, say, valued ﬁelds (see Chapter 4). At the end of this section
we wish to discuss several examples of saturated structures.
Let A be an L-structure, where, as always, L = (λ,μ,K) is a given language. We
denote the cardinality of L again by κL (cf. (2.1)). As described in (2.4), we extend
L by the addition of a new constant symbol a for each a ∈A′, where A′ is some
subset of A := |A|. We had denoted the resulting language by L(A′). If Φ is a set of
formulae, the notation Φ(v0) will be used only when Fr(ϕ) ⊆{v0} for all ϕ ∈Φ.
We call a set Φ(v0) of L(A′)-formulae a(n elementary) type of A, or, more precisely,
of (A,A′), if there is an elementary extension A1 of A and an a ∈A1 := |A1| with
(A1,A1) |= Φ(a) (i.e. (A1,A1) |= ϕ(a) for all ϕ ∈Φ). We say, then, that Φ(v0) is
realized or satisﬁed in (A1,A1) by a.
From now on, instead of writing ψ(x1/c1,...,xn/cn), we shall always write,
more brieﬂy, ψ(c1,...,cn), when it is clear which variables are being replaced by
the given constants.
Lemma 2.5.1. A set Φ(v0) of L(A)-formulae is a type of A if and only if every ﬁnite
subset {ϕ1,...,ϕn} of Φ(v0) is realizable in (A,A), i.e. (A,A) |= ∃v0 (ϕ1∧···∧ϕn).
Proof: If Φ(v0) is a type of A and, say, A ⪯A1 with (A1,A1) |= Φ(a) for some
a ∈A1, then naturally, for all ϕ1,...,ϕn ∈Φ, (A1,A) |= ∃v0 (ϕ1 ∧···∧ϕn) as well,
and hence (by elementariness of the extension) (A,A) |= ∃v0(ϕ1 ∧···∧ϕn).
Conversely, suppose every ﬁnite subset of Φ(v0) is realizable in (A,A). Then we
consider the set
Σ = Th(A,A)∪Φ(c),
of sentences, where c is a new constant symbol. A model of Σ would obviously
furnish an elementary extension A1 of A by Lemma 2.4.2, and an interpretation
a = cA1 of c, so that we thereby obtain (A1,A ∪{a}) |= Φ(c). This would imply,
trivially, that (A1,A1) |= Φ(a).
To show that Σ has a model, it sufﬁces, by the Finiteness Theorem 1.5.6, to show
that every ﬁnite subset of Σ has a model. Such a ﬁnite subset is, however, contained
in a set of the form
Th(A,A)∪{ϕ1(c),...,ϕn(c)},
(2.5.1.1)
for certain ϕ1,...,ϕn ∈Φ(c). In view of (A,A) |= ∃v0 (ϕ1 ∧··· ∧ϕn), however,
(2.5.1.1) has a model, whence the given, ﬁnite subset of Φ(v0) has one, too.
⊓⊔
Even when every ﬁnite subset of a type Φ(v0) of A is satisﬁable in (A,A), this
need not in general hold for Φ(v0) itself. The simplest counterexample is probably
the following. Suppose A is an inﬁnite structure, and
Φ(v0) = {v0 ̸= a | a ∈A}.
(2.5.1.2)
By the inﬁnitude of A, every ﬁnite subset of Φ(v0) is satisﬁable in (A,A), while
Φ(v0) itself is not.

82
2 Model Constructions
In a “saturated” structure A we shall realize as many types of A as possible. For
an inﬁnite cardinal number κ, we call an L-structure A κ-saturated if every type
Φ(v0) of (A,A′) with card(A′) < κ can be realized in (A,A). By Remark 2.3.2, a
ﬁnite structure A is always κ-saturated. For inﬁnite A we obtain immediately from
κ-saturation that
κ ≤card(A);
(2.5.1.3)
otherwise, the type (2.5.1.2) would have to be realizable in (A,A). A further con-
sequence is that each κ-saturated structure A is also κ′-saturated for every inﬁnite
cardinal number κ′ ≤κ. Furthermore, the concept of κ-saturation is obviously in-
variant under extensions of L by fewer than κ constant symbols. This is clear, since
types of A are sets of formulae in the language L(A). New constant symbols can
always be replaced with constant symbols a of the language L(A), by (2.5.1.3).
(Observe that an element a ∈A can be denoted not only by a, but by additional
constant symbols, as well, naturally.)
We shall now show that to every inﬁnite structure, there are always sufﬁciently
saturated elementary extensions. For a cardinal number κ, we denote the successor
cardinal by κ+; thus, κ+ ≤2κ.
Theorem 2.5.2 (Existence Theorem). To every cardinal number κ ≥κL and ev-
ery inﬁnite L-structure A with card(A) ≤2κ, there is a κ+-saturated elementary
extension A∗with card(A∗) ≤2κ.
Proof: We shall construct an elementary κ+-chain (Aν)ν<κ+ with A0 = A and
such that, for all ν < κ+:
(1)
card(Aν) ≤2κ, and
(2)
Aν+1 realizes all types Φ(v0) of Aν with card(Φ) ≤κ.
Let A∗= Aκ+ be the union of this chain. By Theorem 2.4.6, A∗will be an elemen-
tary extension of A. From (1) will follow, in addition:
card(A∗) = card
 
ν<κ+
Aν
	
≤max{κ+,2κ} = 2κ.
Finally, it will follow that A∗is κ+-saturated. Namely, if Φ(v0) is a type of (A∗,A′)
with card(A′) ≤κ, then A′ ⊆Aν must hold for some ν < κ+, by the regularity of
the successor cardinal κ+. From the fact that Aν ⪯A∗will follow, then, that Φ(v0)
is also a type of Aν. In view of
card(Φ) ≤max{κL,card(A′)} ≤κ,
we may apply (2) to conclude that an element a ∈Aν+1 will realize this type in
Aν+1, i.e. Φ(a) holds in (Aν+1,Aν+1). This will imply, however, using Aν+1 ⪯A∗,
that (A∗,A∗) |= Φ(a), as desired.
Thus, it remains only to construct the elementary κ+-chain (Aν)ν<κ+ satisfying
(1) and (2). We begin with A0 = A. In the case of a limit ordinal, we set Aλ =

2.5 Saturated Structures
83

ν<λ Aν. In the case of a successor ordinal, Aν+1 will itself be obtained as the union
of an elementary chain. For this, we index all types Φ(v0) of Aν with card(Φ) ≤
κ by means of ordinal numbers μ < 2κ; we obtain (Φμ)μ<2κ . This is possible,
since, ﬁrst, card(Fml(L(Aν))) ≤2κ, and, second, the set of subsets of Fml(L(Aν)) of
cardinality ≤κ can be bounded from above by the cardinality of the set of mappings
from κ into Fml(L(aν)). These two inequalities give:
card(Fml(L(Aν))κ) ≤(2κ)κ = 2κ·κ = 2κ,
as claimed. Now we set
Aν+1 =

μ<2κ
A(μ)
ν ,
where we deﬁne the sequence A(μ)
ν
as follows:
A(0)
ν
= Aν.
A(λ)
ν
=

μ<λ
A(μ)
ν
for limit ordinals λ < 2κ.
A(μ+1)
ν
= an elementary extension B of A(μ)
ν
(2.5.2.1)
that realizes Φμ(v0), with card(B) ≤2κ.
The existence of an elementary extension B as in (2.5.2.1) follows immediately
from the deﬁnition of a type of A(μ)
ν , together with Theorem 2.3.3.
By Theorem 2.4.6, Aν+1 is now an elementary extension of Aν. Condition (2)
is obviously fulﬁlled, since for a type Φ(v0) of Aν with card(Φ) ≤κ, there is a
μ < 2κ with Φ = Φμ. By construction (2.5.2.1) there is, then, an a ∈A(μ+1)
ν
that
satisﬁes Φ in A(μ+1)
ν
. But then Φ(a) holds also in (Aν+1,Aν+1), since A(μ+1)
ν
⪯
Aν+1. Condition (1) follows from
card(Aν+1) = card
 
μ<2κ
A(μ)

≤max{2κ,2κ} = 2κ.
⊓⊔
Remark 2.5.3 (Existence of “same-cardinality”-saturated, elementary extensions un-
der GCH). We call an inﬁnite L-structure A saturated if it is card(|A|)-saturated. If
we assume the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH), 2κ = κ+, for inﬁnite
cardinal numbers κ, then Theorem 2.5.2 says that to every structure A and to every
successor cardinal κ+ with
max{κ+
L , card(|A|)} ≤κ+,
there is a saturated, elementary extension of cardinality κ+. This structure is
uniquely determined up to isomorphism, as Theorem 2.5.7 will show.
In order to make the proof of the isomorphism theorem easier to understand, we
would like to insert the embedding theorem before it.

84
2 Model Constructions
Theorem 2.5.4 (Embedding Theorem). Let A and A′ be L-structures. Let A′ be κ-
saturated, where κ is an inﬁnite cardinal ≥card(|A|). Then if every ∃-sentence that
holds in A holds also in A′, then A can be embedded in A′.
Here, by an existential or ∃-sentence we mean an L-sentence of the form
∃x1,...,xn δ, where δ is quantiﬁer-free.3 The notation
A ∃⇝A′
will denote the theorem’s hypothesis that for every ∃-sentence, its truth in A trans-
fers to A′. We use this notation analogously in extension languages of L.
Proof: Let A = |A|, A′ = |A′|, and α = card(A). We well-order the elements of A
by the transﬁnite sequence (aν)ν<α. We shall construct an α-sequence (a′
ν)ν<α of
elements of A′ such that
(A,(aν)ν<α) ∃⇝(A′,(a′
ν)ν<α).
(2.5.4.1)α
The language Lα of this extension is just the extension of L by constant symbols cν
for ν < α, where we assume that K ∩α = K ∩{ν | ν < α } = /0 (1.2.0.3). In the
course of the proof we shall consider, analogously, the constant extensions Lβ of L
for all β ≤α.
The embeddability of A in A′ will now follow from (2.5.4.1)α, by Lemma 2.4.2.
Indeed, (A′,(a′
ν)ν<α) is a model of D(A), by (2.5.4.1)α. One need only be careful
to notice that this time our constant symbols are not indexed by a ∈A, but rather by
the ordinal index ν of a = aν.
We shall construct the sequence (a′
ν)ν<α so that for all β < α,
(A,(aν)ν≤β) ∃⇝(A′,(a′
ν)ν≤β).
(2.5.4.2)β
This implies (2.5.4.1)α immediately, as follows. If α is a ﬁnite cardinal number, this
is immediately clear (take β = α −1). If α is an inﬁnite cardinal number, then α is
a limit ordinal. Therefore, since only ﬁnitely many constant symbols cν can occur in
any one ∃-formula ϕ in the language Lα, ϕ is already an ∃-formula in the language
Lβ for some β < α. Therefore, from (2.5.4.2)β and the hypothesis (A,(aν)ν<α) |= ϕ
we immediately obtain (A′,(a′
ν)ν<α) |= ϕ.
Now to the deﬁnition of the sequence (a′
ν)ν<α. Let γ < α. We assume that the
sequence (a′
ν)ν<γ has already been deﬁned so that for all β < γ, (2.5.4.2)β holds.
Then for aγ we must ﬁnd an a′
γ ∈A′ such that (2.5.4.2)γ holds.
Let Φ(v0) be the set of all ∃-formulae ϕ of the language Lγ with Fr(ϕ) ⊆{v0}
and (A,(aν)ν≤γ) |= ϕ(cγ). Obviously, Φ(v0) is a type of (A,(aν)ν<γ). So for each
ﬁnite subset {ϕ1,...,ϕn} of Φ(v0) we have
3 The case n = 0 thus includes quantiﬁer-free sentences. Note also that this concept differs from
the “existence sentences” introduced in Theorem 1.4.2; the latter require n > 0 and do not require
δ to be quantiﬁer-free.

2.5 Saturated Structures
85
(A,(aν)ν<γ) |= ∃v0 (ϕ1 ∧···∧ϕn)
(2.5.1). Let β be the maximum of the indices of the constants cν occurring in
∃v0 (ϕ1 ∧··· ∧ϕn). Obviously, β < γ, and hence ∃v0 (ϕ1 ∧··· ∧ϕn) is logically
equivalent to an ∃-sentence in the language Lβ+1. By hypothesis we also thereby
conclude
(A′,(a′
ν)ν<γ) |= ∃v0 (ϕ1 ∧···∧ϕn).
Therefore Φ(v0) is also a type of (A′,(a′
ν)ν<γ), again using (2.5.1). By the κ-
saturation of A′ we obtain the κ-saturation of (A′,(a′
ν)ν<γ), as already mentioned
just after the deﬁnition of κ-saturation (p. 82). Since card(γ) < α ≤κ (2.5.1.3),
Φ(v0) is realized in this structure, i.e. there is an a′
γ ∈A′ with (A′,(a′
ν)ν≤γ) |=
Φ(cγ). But this shows (2.5.4.2)γ. Indeed, writing an ∃-sentence ϕ in the form
∃x1,...,xn δ with δ quantiﬁer-free, we can always, without loss of generality, as-
sume v0 /∈{x1,...,xn} and thereby obtain ϕ = ϕ(cγ/v0)(v0/cγ).
⊓⊔
Before we come to the Isomorphism Theorem, we would still like to deduce
several consequences of the above theorem. Here we call an L-substructure A of A′
existentially closed if every ∃-sentence of the language L(A) that holds in A′ also
holds in A.
Corollary 2.5.5. Let the L-structure A with universe A be a common substructure
of the L-structures A∗and A′.

@
@
A
A∗
A′
(1) If A′ is κ-saturated with κ > card(|A∗|), and either
(a) A is existentially closed in A∗or
(b) every ﬁnitely generated L(A)-substructure of A∗is embeddable in A′,
then A∗is embeddable in A′ as an L(A)-structure.
(2) If A∗is embeddable in A′ as an L(A)-structure, and A ⪯A′, then A is existen-
tially closed in A∗.
Proof: (1) By Theorem 2.5.4, it sufﬁces to show (A∗,A) ∃⇝(A′,A). Observe that
the structure (A′,A) is also κ-saturated, since card(A) ≤card(A∗) < κ (where we
write A∗= |A∗|). Now let ϕ be an ∃-sentence of L(A) with (A∗,A) |= ϕ. If A is
existentially closed in A∗, then (A,A) |= ϕ, whence (A′,A) |= ϕ by the existential
character of ϕ. Thus we are done in this case.
Now assume the embeddability of ﬁnitely generated L(A)-substructures of A∗
in A′. Writing ϕ in the form ∃x1,...,xn δ with δ quantiﬁer-free, from (A∗,A) |= ϕ
follows the existence of elements a∗
1,...,a∗
n ∈A∗with (A∗,A∗) |= δ(a∗
1,...,a∗
n). Let
B be the substructure of A∗generated by A ∪{a∗
1,...,a∗
n}. Then A ⊆B ⊆A∗,
and B is a ﬁnitely generated L(A)-substructure of A∗. By hypothesis there is an
embedding τ : B →A′ with τ(a) = a for all a ∈A. Then according to Remark 2.2.2
and Lemma 2.4.1, (A′,A) |= δ(τ(a∗
1),...,τ(a∗
n)), whence, in particular,

86
2 Model Constructions
(A′,A) |= ∃x1,...,xn δ.
(2.5.5.1)
(2) If ϕ is an existential L(A)-sentence with (A∗,A) |= ϕ, then from the L(A)-
embeddability of A∗in A′ follows naturally (A′,A) |= ϕ, by analogy with (2.5.5.1).
This, however, gives (A,A) |= ϕ, using A ⪯A′.
⊓⊔
The next corollary follows immediately from the proof of the Embedding The-
orem 2.5.4, along with Lemma 2.4.2, when one takes for Φ(v0) not the set of all
∃-formulae, but rather all formulae ϕ of the language Lγ with Fr(ϕ) ⊆{v0} and
(A,(aν)ν<γ) |= ϕ(cγ).
Corollary 2.5.6. Let A and A′ be L-structures. Let A′ be κ-saturated, where κ is an
inﬁnite cardinal ≥card(|A|). Then if A and A′ are elementarily equivalent, then A
can be elementarily embedded in A′.
Now we come to the important:
Theorem 2.5.7 (Isomorphism Theorem). Let A and A′ be inﬁnite, saturated L-
structures of equal cardinality κ. Then A and A′ are isomorphic if and only if they
are elementarily equivalent.
Proof: If A and A′ are isomorphic, then it follows immediately that they are ele-
mentary equivalent, by Theorem 2.2.1. So suppose, now, that A and A′ are elemen-
tarily equivalent. We shall well-order the elements of A := |A| and A′ := |A′| by the
transﬁnite sequences (aν)ν<κ and (a′
ν)ν<κ, respectively, in such a way that
(A,(aν)ν<κ) ≡(A′,(a′
ν)ν<κ)
(2.5.7.1)κ
holds in the language Lκ with constants cν for ν < κ. (Without loss of generality, we
assume, further, that K ∩κ = K ∩{ν | ν < κ } = /0 (1.2.0.3).) Then by Lemma 2.4.2,
the mapping τ(aν) = a′
ν will deﬁne an embedding of A into A′, which is obviously
surjective, i.e. τ is an isomorphism of A onto A′. This follows as in the proof of
Theorem 2.5.4, since A is a model of D(A), by (2.5.7.1)κ. We shall therefore alter
the proof of the Embedding Theorem 2.5.4 in such a way that (2.5.7.1)κ holds.
We begin with well-orderings (bν)ν<κ and (b′
ν)ν<κ of A and A′, respectively.
From these well-orderings we shall construct the well-orderings (aν)ν<κ and
(a′
ν)ν<κ so that
(A,(aν)ν≤β) ≡(A′,(a′
ν)ν≤β)
(2.5.7.2)β
holds for all β < κ. From this (2.5.7.1)κ will follow immediately: indeed, since κ,
being a cardinal number, is a limit ordinal, and every Lκ-sentence ϕ can contain
only ﬁnitely many constant symbols cν with ν < κ, ϕ is already an Lβ-sentence for
some β < κ.
We shall deﬁne the transﬁnite sequences (aν)ν<κ and (a′
ν)ν<κ so that eventually
every bν and every b′
ν occurs in these sequences. In order to achieve this, we shall
switch back and forth between the structures A and A′ (compare Theorem 3.2.3(1)
below). Here we shall use the fact that every ordinal number γ can be represented
uniquely in the form

2.5 Saturated Structures
87
γ = λ +m,
(2.5.7.3)
where λ is either 0 or a limit ordinal, and m ∈N.
Now suppose, using deﬁnition by recursion, that γ < κ and the sequences (aν)
and (a′
ν) have already been deﬁned for ν < γ so that (2.5.7.2)β holds for all β < γ.
We shall deﬁne aγ and a′
γ so that (2.5.7.2)γ holds. Write the ordinal γ as in (2.5.7.3).
Case 1: m is even; let us write m = 2n.
In this case let aγ be that element bν of the set
{bν | ν < κ }\{aν | ν < γ }
with smallest index ν. In order to deﬁne a′
γ, we consider the type of aγ in
(A,(aν)ν≤γ), i.e. the set Φ(v0) of formulae of the language Lγ for which
(A,(aν)ν≤γ) |= Φ(cγ)
holds. Thus if ϕ1,...,ϕr ∈Φ(v0), then (A,(aν)ν<γ) |= ∃v0 (ϕ1 ∧··· ∧ϕr). Let β
be the maximum of the indices of the constant symbols cν in (ϕ1 ∧···∧ϕr). Since
β < γ, (2.5.7.2)β holds, and thus (A′,(a′
ν)ν<γ) |= ∃v0 (ϕ1 ∧··· ∧ϕr). Therefore
Φ(v0) is a type of (A,(aν)ν<γ) (2.5.1). From the κ-saturation of A′ and card(γ) < κ
follows, then, that there is a b′
μ ∈A′ that realizes Φ(v0) in (A′,(a′
ν)ν<γ). Let a′
γ be
such a b′
μ with smallest index μ. Then obviously
(A′,(a′
ν)ν≤γ) |= Φ(cγ).
(2.5.7.4)
From this, (2.5.7.2)γ follows. Indeed, if ϕ is an Lγ+1-sentence, then one easily ﬁnds,
by possibly renaming bound variables, an Lγ+1-sentence ϕ′ such that ϕ and ϕ′
are logically equivalent and cγ does not lie anywhere inside the scope of a quan-
tiﬁer ∃v0. Therefore, we may assume, without loss of generality, that ϕ equals
ϕ(cγ/v0)(v0/cγ). Then if (A,(aν)ν≤γ) |= ϕ, then ϕ(cγ/v0) ∈Φ(v0), and this im-
plies (A′,(a′
ν)ν≤γ) |= ϕ, using (2.5.7.4).
Case 2: m is odd; let us write m = 2n+1.
In this case let a′
γ be that element b′
ν of the set
{b′
ν | ν < κ }\{a′
ν | ν < γ }
with smallest index ν. We now deﬁne aγ completely analogously to our deﬁnition
of a′
γ in Case 1, and we again obtain
(A,(aν)ν≤γ) ≡(A′,(a′
ν)ν≤γ).
Now one sees immediately, from the alternating character of the deﬁnitions of the
sequences (aν)ν<κ and (a′
ν)ν<κ, that in Case 1, the smallest index ν with bν /∈
{aμ | μ < γ } must obviously satisfy ν ≥λ +n. In the second case, analogously, the
smallest index ν with b′
ν /∈{a′
μ | μ < γ } satisﬁes ν ≥λ + n. Therefore all bν and
b′
ν will, eventually, be chosen.
⊓⊔

2 Model Constructions
To close out this section, we would like to consider several examples of saturated
structures.
Let A =

A;<A
be a dense linear ordering without extrema, i.e. a model of the
axioms O1 through O5 in Section 1.6(1). For <A we shall simply write < here. Let
A be κ-saturated, where κ = ℵα. In this case, we claim that A has “order-type ηα”,
a property introduced by Hausdorff; namely, if B and C are subsets of A with B < C
(this means that b < c for all b ∈B and c ∈C) and cardinalities < ℵα, then there
exists an a ∈A with
b < a < c for all b ∈B, c ∈C.
To see this, we consider the set
Φ := Φ(v0) = {b < v0 | b ∈B}∪{v0 < c | c ∈C}
of formulae. Since A = ⟨A;<⟩is a dense linear ordering without extrema, every
ﬁnite subset of Φ can obviously be realized in A. Thus, since card(Φ) < ℵα = κ, Φ
itself can be realized in A. Then a realizing element a ∈A satisﬁes exactly b < a < c
for every b ∈B and c ∈C. (Let us point out that both B and C may be empty.)
The order-type η0 is clearly just the type of dense orderings without extrema. The
order-type η1, however, cannot be illustrated so easily with examples: the orderings
of Q and R, respectively, are only of type η0.
In Chapter 4 we shall see that a linear ordering A = ⟨A;<⟩of order-type ηα is
always ℵα-saturated. We shall establish the analogous result for divisible, ordered
Abelian groups and for real closed ﬁelds. If, say, A =

A;<A;+A;0A
is a divisible,
ordered Abelian group (recall Section 1.6), then the ℵα-saturation of A will imply
the order-type ηα of

A;<A
, as above. As we shall see, order-type ηα is, on the
other hand, also sufﬁcient for the ℵα-saturation of A. Likewise we shall see that a
real closed ﬁeld A =

A;<A;+A,·A;0A,1A
(recall Section 1.6(6)) is ℵα-saturated
if and only if

A;<A
has order-type ηα.
The statements just made are (as the reader will easily see later) direct conse-
quences of the fact that the theories referred to admit “elimination of quantiﬁers”
(see Section 3.4).
2.6 Ultraproducts
In this section we shall introduce a very algebraically appealing construction of
an L-structure from one or more given L-structures. This method will allow us to,
among other things, “weld” models of the ﬁnite subsets of a set Σ of L-sentences
together into a model of Σ itself. By means of this we obtain a proof of the Finiteness
Theorem 1.5.6 that does not rely upon the Completeness Theorem.
As preparation we must introduce the concept of an ultraﬁlter on a set. Let S be
a nonempty set, and P(S) the power set of S, i.e. P(S) = {A | A ⊆S}. A nonempty
subset F of P(S) is called a ﬁlter on S if

/0 /∈F,
(2)
U,V ∈F implies U ∩V ∈F, and
(2.6.0.1)
(3)
U ∈F, U ⊆A ⊆S implies A ∈F.
Examples of ﬁlters include the set of all co-ﬁnite subsets A of S (i.e. those A such
that S\A is ﬁnite; here S is assumed to be inﬁnite), or, for each a ∈S, the set
H (a) = {A ⊆S | a ∈A}.
(2.6.0.2)
The ﬁlter F = H (a) has the additional property
(4)
A ⊆S, A /∈F implies S\A ∈F.
(2.6.0.3)
A ﬁlter on S satisfying (4) is called an ultraﬁlter on S. Filters of the form H (a)
are called principal ultraﬁlters. One can see easily that an ultraﬁlter F that contains
(as an element) a ﬁnite set, is necessarily principal. If S is inﬁnite, then the ﬁlter of
co-ﬁnite subsets of S is obviously not an ultraﬁlter (cf. Exercise 2.7.8). However,
the following lemma holds:
Lemma 2.6.1. Let F0 be a system of nonempty subsets of S that is closed under
(ﬁnite) intersection. Then there is an ultraﬁlter D on S with F0 ⊆D.
Proof: Let D ⊆P(S) \ {/0} be a maximal, intersection-closed extension of F0.
Zorn’s lemma guarantees the existence of such a system D. We shall show that D
is an ultraﬁlter on S.
If we form the set
F(D) = {A ⊆S | there exists a U ∈D with U ⊆A},
(2.6.1.1)
then we see immediately that F(D) is an intersection-closed subset of P(S) \ {/0}
extending D. Therefore
F(D) = D,
(2.6.1.2)
by the maximality of D. And since F(D) obviously satisﬁes (3), we conclude that
D is a ﬁlter on S. Now suppose A ⊆S and A /∈D. Set B = S\A and form the set
F[B] := D ∪{U ∩B | U ∈D },
which is obviously intersection-closed. If /0 were a member of F[B], then U ∩B
would be empty for someU ∈D. Then we would haveU ⊆A = S\B, which, in view
of (2.6.1.1) and (2.6.1.2), would contradict A /∈D. So we may invoke the maximality
of D to conclude that F[B] must again be equal to D. Since S ∈F(D) = D, we
conclude that
S\A = B = S∩B ∈F[B] = D.
Thus we have proved that D is an ultraﬁlter.

Now let a nonempty system A(s) of L-structures, for s ∈S, be given. Further let
an ultraﬁlter D on S be given. Then we shall deﬁne the ultraproduct of the A(s) with

as one may easily check. Then we have the following theorem of Łos:
Theorem 2.6.2 (Łos’ Theorem). Let A be the ultraproduct of the L-structures A(s),
for s ∈S, with respect to the ultraﬁlter D. Then for every L-formula ϕ and every

(2.6.2.1)
Proof: We prove (2.6.2.1) by induction on the recursive construction of ϕ.
First suppose ϕ is atomic. If ϕ is Ri(t1,...,tλ(i)), then (2.6.2.1) follows from
(2.6.1.4), (1.5.0.6), and
tA
h(s)

which one proves by a routine induction on the recursive construction of terms (re-
calling (1.5.0.4)). When ϕ is the other kind of atomic formula, t1 .= t2, (2.6.2.1)
follows similarly.
If ϕ is of the form ¬ϕ1, then

Here we used the induction hypothesis as well as the ultraﬁlter properties (4) and

But this contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore, the proof of the equivalence is com-

A(s) = B for all s ∈S. In this case we call

94

the ultrapower of B with respect to D.
With ultrapowers we have another method to construct elementary extensions:
Corollary 2.6.3. Let B be an L-structure and D an ultraﬁlter on S. Then the map-
ping τ(b) = (b)s∈S for b ∈|B| deﬁnes an elementary embedding of B in the ultra-
power A = BS/D.
Proof: Let h be an evaluation in B. From h we construct the sequence of evalua-
tions h in the ultrapower A by setting
h(x) = (h(x))s∈S = τ(h(x)).
Then for every L-formula ϕ and every evaluation h in B we have, by Theorem 2.6.2,
A |= ϕ

h

iff
{s | B |= ϕ [h]} ∈D.
Since the condition B |= ϕ [h] does not depend on s, the set {s | B |= ϕ [h]} can
only be empty, or equal to S. Since /0 /∈D and S ∈D, we therefore obtain
{s | B |= ϕ [h]} ∈D
iff
B |= ϕ [h].
All together we therefore have
A |= ϕ [τ ◦h]
iff
B |= ϕ [h].
But this means exactly that τ is an elementary embedding of B in A.
⊓⊔
As a ﬁrst application of ultraproducts, we would like to prove the Finiteness The-
orem 1.5.6 (which is fundamental for model theory) without relying on the Com-
pleteness Theorem of ﬁrst-order logic; such a proof was promised in Remark 1.5.7.
For this, let Σ be a set of L-sentences, every ﬁnite subset Δ of which possesses
a model. First we consider the system S of all ﬁnite subsets Δ of Σ. The set S
is partially ordered by set-theoretic inclusion. Next, we deﬁne the system F0 of
(nonempty) sets
SΔ = {Δ′ ∈S | Δ ⊆Δ′ },
where Δ runs through all elements of S. F0 is closed under (ﬁnite) intersection, since
SΔ1 ∩SΔ2 = SΔ1∪Δ2.
By Lemma 2.6.1, there is an ultraﬁlter D on S that contains F0. We then have:
Theorem 2.6.4. Let Σ ⊆SentL, S the system of all ﬁnite subsets Δ of Σ, and D an
ultraﬁlter on S that contains F0. For every Δ ∈S let A(Δ) be a model of Δ. Then the
ultraproduct
A = ∏
Δ∈S
A(Δ)
D
is a model of Σ.

2.6 Ultraproducts
95
Proof: Let ρ ∈Σ. For all Δ ∈S with ρ ∈Δ, we obviously have A(Δ) |= ρ. Therefore
{Δ | A(Δ) |= ρ } ⊇{Δ | Δ ⊇{ρ}} =: S{ρ}.
From S{ρ} ∈F0 ⊆D, it follows that
{Δ | A(Δ) |= ρ } ∈D.
But this implies A |= ρ, using Łos’ Theorem 2.6.2.
⊓⊔
Finally, we would like to discuss the case of the ultrapower
A = BN/D
of an inﬁnite L-structure B with respect to an ultraﬁlter D on the natural numbers (or
on any other countable set). The case of a ﬁnite structure B is actually uninteresting,
since by the elementary equivalence of A and B, both have the same number of
elements. Then the embedding τ given in Corollary 2.6.3 would be an isomorphism
of B onto A.
If D is a principal ultraﬁlter on N, say,
D = {U ⊆N | m ∈U }
for a certain m ∈N, then A is again isomorphic to B. Indeed, two sequences

a(n)
n∈N and

b(n)
n∈N of elements of |B| are equivalent if and only if a(m) = b(m).
Therefore the equivalence classes of sequences

a(n)
n∈N correspond bijectively
with the elements of |B|.
If D is a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter, then D cannot contain any ﬁnite subset of N,
and so it must contain all co-ﬁnite subsets of N. Since B = |B| is inﬁnite, there is an
injective sequence

a(n)
n∈N of elements of B. The equivalence class a =

a(n)
n∈N
is an element of A that does not belong to the image of the embedding τ described
in Corollary 2.6.3. Indeed, if b ∈B, then from τ(b) = a it would immediately follow,
by the deﬁnition of equivalence of sequences, that D would contain either the empty
set or a singleton set, since from τ(b) = a we would have

n
 b = a(n) 
∈D.
Therefore in this case the ultrapower A is a proper extension of the image τ(B).
The following theorem relates ultraproducts with saturation.
Theorem 2.6.5. For each s ∈N, let A(s) be an L-structure, where L is a countable
language (i.e. κL = ℵ0). If D is a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on N, then the ultraprod-
uct
A = ∏
s∈N
A(s)
D
is ℵ1-saturated.

Proof: Let Φ(v0) be a type of (A,A′) with card(A′) < ℵ1. Thus, the set Φ is at
most countable. Let (ϕn)n∈N be an enumeration of the formulae in Φ (possibly with
repetitions). We construct the sequence (ψn)n∈N by setting
ψn = (ϕ0 ∧···∧ϕn).
If an a ∈A = |A| realizes all formulae ψn, then obviously it also realizes all ϕn.
By hypothesis there is, to each n ∈N, an element an ∈A with (A,A) |= ψn(an).
In the formulae ψn, constant symbols b occur, for certain b ∈A′. If we represent
these elements b by sequences

b(s)
s∈N and the elements an likewise by sequences

a(s)

is the result of the replacement of the constant symbols b in ψn by b(s).
Since D is nonprincipal, we also have

i=1
Ui ∈D.
(2.6.5.1)
For the set Vn we have
Vn+1 ⊆Vn

if s ∈Vn \Vn+1
c(s)
otherwise.
(2.6.5.2)
Here c(s) is a ﬁxed, chosen element of A(s). We claim that the equivalence class a
satisﬁes all formulae ψn in A. For this it sufﬁces, by Łos’ Theorem 2.6.2, to show
Wn =

However, since ψ(s)
m implies ψ(s)
n
for m ≥n, it follows immediately from (2.6.5.2)
that
Vm \Vm+1 ⊆Wn
for each m ≥n. Therefore Wn contains the union of all Vm \Vm+1 for m ≥n, which,
in view of 
m∈NVm = /0, equals Vn. Then Wn ∈D follows from (2.6.5.1).

Chapter 3
Properties of Model Classes
In this chapter we wish to study properties of model classes. By a model class we
mean the class of all models of an axiom system Σ.
First we shall furnish such a class with a topology whose compactness is exactly
the content of the Finiteness Theorem 1.5.6. After that, we shall introduce several
properties of the model class of an axiom system Σ, whose study can lead, among
other things, to the proof of the completeness (recall §1.6) of Σ. We shall carry this
out explicitly for a series of theories axiomatized in (1.6).
The properties of Σ or of its model class to be introduced are: categoricity in
a ﬁxed cardinality, model completeness and quantiﬁer elimination. The study of
these properties is based not only on the possible applicability to the proof of the
completeness of a theory, but is, rather, also justiﬁed by its usefulness in concrete,
mathematical (in particular, algebraic) theories. In this chapter we shall investigate
such properties only for the theory of algebraically closed ﬁelds; in Chapter 4, other
theories will follow.
3.1 Compactness and Separation
First we want to interpret the statement of the Finiteness Theorem 1.5.6 as the com-
pactness of a certain space. This translation is not really profound, but very sugges-
tive.
We consider a language L = (λ,μ,K) and denote by ModL the class of all L-
structures A. For a subset Σ of Sent(L), we deﬁne
ModL(Σ) = {A ∈ModL | A |= Σ }.
Here, as in Chapter 2, the notation A |= Σ means nothing other than that A |= σ for
all σ ∈Σ. The class ModL(Σ) is the class of all models of Σ. It will therefore also
be called the model class of Σ. For Σ = {σ}, we write, brieﬂy, ModL(σ), instead of
ModL({σ}). We shall also drop the subscript L whenever it is clear which language

3 Properties of Model Classes
L we are dealing with. The following properties are immediately veriﬁed:
Mod(∃x x ̸= x) = /0
Mod(∀x x .= x) = Mod
Mod(¬ϕ) = Mod\Mod(ϕ)
Mod(ϕ ∧ψ) = Mod(ϕ)∩Mod(ψ)
Mod(ϕ ∨ψ) = Mod(ϕ)∪Mod(ψ)
Mod(Σ) =

σ∈Σ
Mod(σ).
The system of classes Mod(σ) with σ ∈Σ is therefore closed under intersection,
and can therefore serve as a basis of a topology on Mod. We call a subclass of Mod
open if it is an arbitrary union of classes of the form Mod(σ) with σ ∈Sent(L); that
is, open classes are of the form

ϕ∈Φ
Mod(ϕ),
where Φ is a subset of Sent(L). The closed classes are then the complements of
open classes of the form

ϕ∈Φ
Mod(¬ϕ),
i.e. they are just model classes like those we introduced above. (Set Σ = {¬ϕ | ϕ ∈
Φ}.) Closed subclasses are often called elementary or axiomatizable.
Remark 3.1.1 (topologies on proper classes versus sets). In the sense of set theory,
ModL is a proper class. The introduction of a topology on ModL may therefore seem
somewhat suspicious. However, we do not wish to dwell on this point. In fact, this
defect is easily removed by a set-theoretically precise procedure. One can restrict,
in the case of ModL, for example, to those L-structures that lie in a prescribed set V.
Here, one chooses the “universe” V large enough so that all interesting set-theoretic
operations can be carried out in it.
Consequently, we shall no longer distinguish between sets and classes.
As a ﬁrst observation, we wish to note that Mod, together with the topology just
introduced on it, is not a Hausdorff space. We see this immediately upon reformu-
lating the condition A ≡B for L-structures A and B:
(A ∈Mod(σ) iff B ∈Mod(σ))
for all σ ∈Sent(L).
Therefore, if A ≡B, then B lies in every open set of the form Mod(σ) in which A
lies, so that A can not be separated from B. But a pair of different L-structures A,B
with A ≡B that are not even isomorphic is easily constructed: Let A be any inﬁnite

3.1 Compactness and Separation
103
L-structure, and let B be elementarily equivalent to A and of higher cardinality than
A (such a B exists by Corollary 2.1.2); then obviously A ̸∼= B and A ≡B.
Theorem 3.1.2 (Compactness Theorem). Let Σ ⊆Sent(L). Then the “Heine–Borel
covering theorem” holds for ModL(Σ); i.e. if 
ϕ∈Φ Mod(ϕ) is a covering of
ModL(Σ), then there exist ϕ1,...,ϕn ∈Φ with
ModL(Σ) ⊆ModL(ϕ1)∪···∪ModL(ϕn).
(3.1.2.1)
Proof: From the hypothesis that

σ∈Σ
Mod(σ) ⊆

ϕ∈Φ
Mod(ϕ),
it follows immediately that

σ∈Σ
Mod(σ)∩

ϕ∈Φ
Mod(¬ϕ) = /0,
i.e. the set Σ ∪{¬ϕ | ϕ ∈Φ } has no model. By the Finiteness Theorem 1.5.6, there
must exist a ﬁnite subset of Σ ∪{¬ϕ | ϕ ∈Φ } that possesses no model. In particular,
there therefore exist ϕ1,...,ϕn ∈Φ such that
Mod(Σ)∩Mod(¬ϕ1)∩···∩Mod(¬ϕn) = /0.
But this means exactly (3.1.2.1).
⊓⊔
The fact that, conversely, the Compactness Theorem implies the Finiteness The-
orem (mentioned above), is immediately seen as follows: if Σ ⊆Sent(L) has no
model, then 
σ∈Σ Mod(σ) = /0, whence 
σ∈Σ Mod(¬σ) is a covering of Mod.
By the Compactness Theorem, there exist, then, σ1,...,σn ∈Σ such that already
Mod(¬σ1)∪···∪Mod(¬σn) covers Mod. Therefore
Mod(σ1)∩···∩Mod(σn) = /0,
i.e. the ﬁnite subset {σ1,...,σn} of Σ possesses no model.
From the Compactness Theorem we now derive the Separation Lemma:
Lemma 3.1.3 (Separation Lemma). Let Σ1,Σ2,Γ ⊆Sent(L) with ModL(Σi) ̸= /0 for
i = 1,2. Suppose that to each A ∈ModL(Σ1) and to each B ∈ModL(Σ2) there is a
γ ∈Γ with A |= γ and B |= ¬γ. Then there exists a γ∗with
ModL(Σ1) ⊆ModL(γ∗)
and
ModL(Σ2) ⊆ModL(¬γ∗),
where γ∗is a ﬁnite disjunction of ﬁnite conjunctions of elements of Γ .
Proof: First we ﬁx an A ∈Mod(Σ1), and for each B ∈Mod(Σ2) we choose a
γB with A ∈Mod(γB) and B ∈Mod(¬γB). Then the classes Mod(¬γB) obvi-
ously form a(n open) cover of Mod(Σ2). By the Compactness Theorem there are

104
3 Properties of Model Classes
B1,...,Bm ∈Mod(Σ2) such that
Mod(¬γB1)∪···∪Mod(¬γBm) = Mod(¬(γB1 ∧···∧γBm))
already contains Mod(Σ2). If we set γA = (γB1 ∧···∧γBm), then
A ∈Mod(γA)
and
Mod(Σ2) ⊆Mod(¬γA).
But now, on the other hand, the classes Mod(γA) with this property obviously
cover the class Mod(Σ1). Again, this cover admits a ﬁnite subcover; i.e. there exist
A1,...,An ∈Mod(Σ1) such that
Mod(Σ1) ⊆Mod(γA1)∪···∪Mod(γAn) = Mod(γA1 ∨···∨γAn).
At the same time we have, however,
Mod(Σ2) ⊆Mod(¬γA1)∩···∩Mod(¬γAn) = Mod(¬(γB1 ∨···∨γAn)).
Therefore, if we ﬁnally set γ∗= (γA1 ∨···∨γAn), then we shall have completed the
proof.
⊓⊔
As an application, we characterize the ﬁnitely axiomatizable subclasses of Mod,
i.e. the model classes of ﬁnite sets {ϕ1,...,ϕn} ⊆Sent(L). By the intersection-
closedness, these are just the classes of the form Mod(ϕ) for a ϕ ∈Sent(L).
Corollary 3.1.4. A subclass ModL(Σ) of ModL is ﬁnitely axiomatizable if and only
if ModL \ModL(Σ) is axiomatizable.
Proof: We exclude the trivial cases Mod(Σ) = Mod or = /0. If Mod(Σ) = Mod(ϕ)
for some ϕ ∈Sent(L), then naturally Mod\Mod(Σ) = Mod(¬ϕ). If, conversely,
Mod\Mod(Σ) = Mod(Σ2) for some subset Σ2 ⊆Sent(L), then we apply the Sepa-
ration Lemma to Γ = Σ1 = Σ. If B ∈Mod(Σ2), then B is not a model of Σ, whence
there is a γ ∈Σ with B |= ¬γ. On the other hand, A |= γ naturally holds for all
A ∈Mod(Σ1). Therefore the hypothesis of the Separation Lemma is satisﬁed, as a
consequence of which there is a sentence γ∗of the form
(γ11 ∧···∧γ1m1)∨···∨(γn1 ∧···∧γnmn),
with γij ∈Σ, such that Mod(Σ) ⊆Mod(γ∗) and Mod(Σ2) ⊆Mod(¬γ∗). But this last
means exactly that Mod(γ∗) ⊆Mod(Σ). Therefore Mod(Σ) = Mod(γ∗).
⊓⊔
Remark 3.1.5. We remark, in addition, that a class Mod(Σ) that is ﬁnitely axioma-
tizable can be axiomatized already by ﬁnitely many axioms from Σ. Namely, with
the notation of the last proof, we even have
Mod(Σ) = Mod({γij | 1 ≤j ≤mi, 1 ≤i ≤n}).
One may easily check this.

3.1 Compactness and Separation
105
The following lemma is a consequence of the Separation Lemma that is useful
for applications. For this we wish to use a generalization of a notation introduced in
Theorem 2.5.4. For L-structures A,B and for Γ ⊆Sent(L),
A Γ⇝B
will mean that for all γ ∈Γ ,
A |= γ
implies
B |= γ.
For A
{ϕ}
⇝B we write, brieﬂy, A
ϕ⇝B.
Lemma 3.1.6. Let Σ ∪Γ ∪{ϕ} ⊆Sent(L) and let γ0 (respectively, γ1) be an element
of Γ that holds in no model (respectively, in all models) of Σ. Suppose, in addition,
that for all models A,B of Σ, whenever A Γ⇝B, then also A
ϕ⇝B. Then there exists
a ﬁnite disjunction γ∗of ﬁnite conjunctions of elements of Γ that is equivalent to ϕ
in all models of Σ; i.e. Σ ⊢(ϕ ↔γ∗).1
Proof: In the Separation Lemma we set Σ1 = Σ ∪{ϕ} and Σ2 = Σ ∪{¬ϕ}. If
Mod(Σ1) = /0, then obviously Σ ⊢(ϕ ↔γ0); if Mod(Σ2) = /0, then, analogously, Σ ⊢
(ϕ ↔γ1). Now if A ∈Mod(Σ1) and B ∈Mod(Σ2), then A
ϕ⇝B cannot hold, and
hence neither can A Γ⇝B. Accordingly, there exists a γ ∈Γ with A |= γ and B |= ¬γ.
Then, by the Separation Lemma, we obtain a ﬁnite disjunction γ∗of ﬁnite conjunc-
tions of elements of Γ with Mod(Σ1) ⊆Mod(γ∗) and Mod(Σ2) ⊆Mod(¬γ∗). From
this it follows, for A ∈Mod(Σ), that, on the one hand,
A |= ϕ
implies
A |= γ∗,
and, on the other hand,
A |= ¬ϕ implies
A |= ¬γ∗.
Therefore, for all A ∈Mod(Σ) we also have
A |= (ϕ ↔γ∗).
⊓⊔
As an application of Lemma 3.1.6, we wish to prove the following theorem:
Theorem 3.1.7. Let Σ ∪{ϕ} ⊆Sent(L). Suppose that for all B,B1 ∈Mod(Σ)
with B ⊆B1, B1
ϕ⇝B holds. Then there is a quantiﬁer free L-formula δ with
Σ ⊢(ϕ ↔∀δ).
Proof: We set Γ = {∀δ | δ ∈Fml(L), δ quantiﬁer-free} and show, for A,B ∈
Mod(Σ), that A Γ⇝B always implies A
ϕ⇝B. Toward this purpose, we observe
1 Recall that by G¨odel’s Completeness Theorem 1.5.2, ψ holds in every model of Σ if and only if
Σ ⊢ψ.

106
3 Properties of Model Classes
that the hypothesis A Γ⇝B, when read backwards, says that every ∃-sentence that
holds in B holds already in A. If we now choose (by Theorem 2.5.2) a κ-saturated
elementary extension A′ of A with κ ≥card(|B|), then Theorem 2.5.4 yields an
embedding of B into A′. Then by our hypothesis, B |= ϕ will follow from A′ |= ϕ.
Now we apply Lemma 3.1.6 with the γ0 there being the sentence ∀v0 v0 ̸= v0,
and with γ1 being the sentence ∀v0 v0 .= v0.
Then the conclusion of Lemma 3.1.6 is that Σ ⊢(ϕ ↔γ∗), where γ∗is a disjunc-
tion of conjunctions from Γ . Now one sees easily that for the above choice of Γ ,
γ∗is purely logically equivalent to some γ ∈Γ , i.e. ⊢(γ∗↔γ) holds. Hence the
theorem is proved.
⊓⊔
3.2 Categoricity
Now we would like to begin to prove the completeness of several theories that we
introduced in §1.6. We called (1.6.0.2) an axiom system Σ ⊆Sent(L) complete if
for all σ ∈Sent(L), either Σ ⊢σ or Σ ⊢¬σ. For an L-theory T, this means that
σ ∈T
or
¬σ ∈T.
Already in (1.6.0.3), we had seen that complete L-theories T are always of the form
Th(A), for an L-structure A. A further, trivial criterion is:
Lemma 3.2.1. Σ ⊆Sent(L) is complete if and only if every two models of Σ are
elementarily equivalent.
Proof: If Σ is complete, then Ded(Σ) = Th(A) for an L-structure A, and if B is a
model of Σ, then, naturally, B |= Th(A). From this, A ≡B follows immediately. If
C is a further model of Σ, then A ≡C follows analogously. By transitivity, B ≡C.
If Σ is incomplete, then there exists a σ ∈Sent(L) with Σ ̸⊢σ and Σ ̸⊢¬σ. By
G¨odel’s Completeness Theorem 1.5.2, then, there are models A and B of Σ with
A |= ¬σ and B |= σ. But this contradicts the hypothesis that A ≡B.
⊓⊔
A very simple, sufﬁcient condition for completeness, which, however, can be
applied only very seldomly, is:
Theorem 3.2.2 (Vaught’s Test). Suppose the set Σ ⊆Sent(L) possesses only inﬁnite
models, and there exists a cardinal number κ ≥κL such that every two models of Σ
of cardinality κ are isomorphic. Then Σ is complete.
Proof: Let A and B be two models of Σ. By Corollary 2.1.2 there are L-structures
A1 and B1 of cardinality κ with A ≡A1 and B ≡B1. By hypothesis, A1 ∼= B1. It
then follows that
A ≡A1 ∼= B1 ≡B,
and thus A ≡B. We now obtain the completeness of Σ using Lemma 3.2.1.
⊓⊔

3.2 Categoricity
107
Now we would like to apply this test to three theories from §1.6.
Theorem 3.2.3. The theories
(1) of dense linear orderings with extrema,
(2) of nontrivial, divisible, torsion-free, Abelian groups, and
(3) of algebraically closed ﬁelds of a ﬁxed characteristic,
are complete.
Proof: It is clear that each of these theories admits no ﬁnite model. The cardinality
κL of each language is ℵ0.
(1) Let A = ⟨A;<⟩and A′ = ⟨A′;<′⟩be two dense linear orderings without ex-
trema. Furthermore, suppose A and A′ are countable; let, say, (bn)n∈N be an enumer-
ation of A, and (b′
n)n∈N an enumeration of A′. With the help of Cantor’s “back-and-
forth procedure”2 we deﬁne an isomorphism τ of A and A′. We construct this iso-
morphism piece by piece, by deﬁning new enumerations (an)n∈N of A and (a′
n)n∈N
of A′ in such a way that the mapping τ(an) := a′
n is automatically order-preserving.
We assume that we have already deﬁned an and a′
n for n < m such that
ai < aj
iff
a′
i < a′
j
(3.2.3.1)
for i, j < m. We must ﬁnd am and a′
m such that the condition (3.2.3.1) continues
to hold. Moreover, the choice of am and a′
m should be made in such a way that
ultimately all bn and b′
n are used. We do this as follows:
If m is even, say m = 2m1, then let am be the bn with smallest index that does not
lie in the set {a0,...,am−1}. Since A′ is a dense ordering without extrema, we can
obviously choose a′
m ∈A′ so that (3.2.3.1) holds for i, j ≤m.
If m is odd, say m = 2m1 +1, then let a′
m be the b′
n with smallest index that does
not lie in the set {a′
0,...,a′
m−1}. By analogy with the previous case, we can choose
am ∈A so that (3.2.3.1) continues to hold for i, j ≤m.
From the alternating character of the deﬁnitions, we see that for the above-
mentioned minimal index n, m1 ≤n always holds. Therefore the mapping τ(am) =
a′
m furnishes an isomorphism of A and A′.
(2) Now let A and A′ be divisible, torsion-free Abelian groups. Each such group
is, in a canonical way, a vector space over the ﬁeld Q. Indeed, if a ∈|A| and n
m ∈Q,
then we deﬁne n
ma as follows: since A is divisible, there is a b ∈|A| with mb = a. By
torsion-freeness, b is uniquely determined. Indeed, if mb′ = a, then m(b −b′) = 0
and thence b = b′ would follow. Thus we set n
ma = nb.
If we assume, moreover, that A and A′ are of cardinality ℵ1, then it follows
that both A and A′ have a basis over Q of cardinality ℵ1. Therefore A and A′ are
isomorphic as Q-vector spaces. Hence they are, in particular, isomorphic as Abelian
groups.
(3) Finally, let A and A′ be algebraically closed ﬁelds of equal characteristic, and
let both be of cardinality ℵ1. Then both possess transcendence bases of cardinality
ℵ1 over the prime ﬁeld. Then by the well-known isomorphism theorem of Steinitz
[Steinitz, 1930], A and A′ are isomorphic.
⊓⊔
2 This procedure was the inspiration for the proof of the Isomorphism Theorem 2.5.7.

108
3 Properties of Model Classes
In §§3.3 and 3.4 we shall treat the case of algebraically closed ﬁelds using other
methods. The proof of the completeness of this theory in the case of ﬁxed charac-
teristic will then follow by means of algebraic facts much simpler than the isomor-
phism theorem of Steinitz.
This isomorphism theorem is, however, very important when considering a deep
result of model theory, “Morley’s theorem”.
A theory T (or an axiom system Σ) is called κ-categorical if every two models
of T (or Σ, respectively) of cardinality κ are isomorphic.
We consider the case of a countable language L (i.e. κL = ℵ0) and an L-theory
T having no ﬁnite model. Then the completeness of T follows from κ-categoricity,
by Theorem 3.2.2. Morley’s theorem says, now, that if such a theory is categorical
in one uncountable cardinal number κ, then it is already categorical in every un-
countable cardinal number. If follows that for such a theory T there are only four
possibilities:
(1) T is categorical in every cardinality. An example of this is the theory of inﬁnite
sets. For the language of this theory, I = J = K = /0; an axiom system is, say,
Σ = {α≥n | n ∈N}, where
α≥n := ∃v1,...,vn

is a cardinality formula that says that there are at least n distinct objects. The
models of Σ are, therefore, just the inﬁnite sets. Two inﬁnite sets of equal cardi-
nality are naturally isomorphic, since an isomorphism in this language is noth-
ing more than a bijection.
(2) T is ℵ0-categorical and not ℵ1-categorical. This is the case for the theory of
dense linear orderings without extrema, for example.
(3) T is ℵ1-categorical and not ℵ0-categorical. The theory of (nontrivial) divisi-
ble, torsion-free, Abelian groups is an example of this, as is the theory of alge-
braically closed ﬁelds of a ﬁxed characteristic.
(4) T is neither ℵ0-categorical nor ℵ1-categorical. The theory of divisible, ordered,
Abelian groups furnishes an example of this. This is actually the “general” case.
We cannot go into the proof of Morley’s theorem in the framework of this book.
The methods of that proof lead into a part of model theory that is currently in full
bloom: stability theory. Compared to the part of model theory devoted more to the
investigation of concrete, mostly algebraic theories, stability theory would better be
called “abstract model theory”. We refer the interested reader to the books of Shelah
[1978] and Poizat [1985].
To conclude this section, we would like to derive several interesting conse-
quences of the completeness of the theory of algebraically closed ﬁelds of a ﬁxed
characteristic. These involve a certain transfer principle.
Theorem 3.2.4. If α is a sentence in the language of ﬁelds, then, writing “a.c.” for
“algebraically closed”, we have:

3.2 Categoricity
109
(1) If α holds in an a.c. ﬁeld, then α holds in every other a.c. ﬁeld of the same
characteristic.
(2) If α holds in all a.c. ﬁelds of prime characteristic, then α holds in all a.c. ﬁelds.
(3) If α holds in all a.c. ﬁelds of characteristic 0, then, for all prime numbers p
outside a ﬁnite set, α holds in all a.c. ﬁelds of prime characteristic p.
(4) If α is of the form ∀x1,...,xn ∃y1,...,ym δ with quantiﬁer-free δ, and if α holds
in every ﬁnite ﬁeld, then α holds in all algebraically closed ﬁelds.
Proof: (1) This is nothing other than the completeness of the theory of a.c. ﬁelds
of a ﬁxed characteristic.
(2) By (1), it sufﬁces to show that α holds in at least one a.c. ﬁeld of character-
istic 0, which means nothing other than the consistency of the following set Σ of
sentences:
{α}∪{K1,...,K9}∪{AKn | n ≥1}∪{¬Cq | q ∈N, q prime}.
Here, Ki,AKn,Cq are the axioms introduced in (1.6.1.2), (1.6.1.3) and (1.6.1.4). A
ﬁnite subset Π of this axiom set Σ can contain only ﬁnitely many characteristic
sentences ¬Cq; say, ¬Cq1,...,¬Cqm. If p is a prime number greater than q1,...,qm,
then obviously the algebraic closure 	
Fp of the Galois ﬁeld Fp with p elements is
a model of Π. Since each ﬁnite subset of Σ has a model, we obtain a model of Σ
itself, by the Finiteness Theorem 1.5.6.
(3) The hypothesis says that the set of sentences
{¬α}∪{K1,...,K9}∪{AKn | n ≥1}∪{¬Cq | q ∈N, q prime}
has no model. By another use of Theorem 1.5.6, there is a ﬁnite subset Π admitting
no model. If ¬Cq1,...,¬Cqm are the characteristic sentences in Π, then it follows
that every a.c. ﬁeld F satisfying those sentences necessarily violates ¬α; i.e. if the
characteristic of F is different from q1,...,qm, then α must hold in F.
(4) Let p be a prime number. The algebraic closure 	
Fp of Fp is the union of its
(uniquely determined) ﬁnite subﬁelds Fpm (with exactly pm elements). In particular,
	
Fp =

m≥1
Fpm!,
where the ﬁnite ﬁelds Fpm! now form an increasing chain. By hypothesis, α holds
in every Fpm!, hence also in 	
Fp, by Remark 2.4.7. The claim then follows from (1)
and (2).
⊓⊔
From (4) it is easy to prove (following J. Ax) the following theorem of algebraic
geometry:
Theorem 3.2.5. Let F be an algebraically closed ﬁeld (e.g. the ﬁeld C of complex
numbers). Let M be an algebraic subset of the afﬁne space Fn. Further, let f be
a mapping from M to itself with the following property: there are algebraic sets

110
3 Properties of Model Classes
M1,...,Mm with M = m
i=1 Mi, and on each Mi, f is, coordinatewise, a polynomial;
i.e. there are pij ∈F[X1,...,Xn] with
f(a1,...,an) = (pi1(a1,...,an),..., pin(a1,...,an)),
for all (a1,...,an) ∈Mi. Then if f is injective, then f is also surjective.
Proof: If we can write the conclusion of this theorem as an ∀∃-sentence α, then,
by Theorem 3.2.4(4), the theorem will have been proved, since α holds in every
ﬁnite ﬁeld. (The set M is, then, likewise ﬁnite, and an injection of M into itself is
naturally also surjective.)
First, we consider polynomials qi1,...,qir ∈F[X1,...,Xn] =: F

X

that deﬁne
the set Mi (for 1 ≤i ≤m). Here we can take the number r to be the same for all Mi.
(This is always achievable by repetition of polynomials.) Further, let f be deﬁned by
pi1,..., pin ∈F

X

on Mi. Now we must formulate the conclusion of this theorem.
For simplicity, we consider only the case m = 1, and leave the general case to the
reader. We therefore assume that f is deﬁned on M by the polynomials p1,..., pn,
and M itself is deﬁned by q1,...,qr. Then we must formulate:
“ f goes from M to M” ∧“ f injective” →“ f surjective”.
(3.2.5.1)
The ﬁrst conjunct in the premise becomes:
∀x
 r
j=1
q j(x) .= 0 →
r
j=1
qj(p1(x),..., pn(x)) .= 0

.
The second conjunct in the premise becomes:
∀x ∀y
 r
j=1
(q j(x) .= 0 ∧qj(y) .= 0) ∧
n
i=1
pi(x) .= pi(y) →
n
i=1
xi .= yi

.
The conclusion of (3.2.5.1) becomes:
∀u ∃w
 r
j=1
(q j(u) .= 0 →
r
j=1
q j(w) .= 0 ∧
n
i=1
ui .= pi(w)

.
Altogether, we therefore have a sentence of the form
∀x δ1 ∧∀x ∀y δ2 →∀u ∃w δ3,
(3.2.5.2)
where δ1,δ2,δ3 are quantiﬁer-free. By pure logic, (3.2.5.2) is equivalent to
∀u ∃w ∃x ∃y (δ1 ∧δ2 →δ3);
but this is an ∀∃-sentence.

3.3 Model Completeness
111
So far, we have not taken the coefﬁcients of the polynomials pi and q j at all into
account. This gap is remedied as follows. We replace the coefﬁcients by variables
vk that have not been used up till now. (Observe that the u,w,x,y are, in reality,
also certain variables vμ.) The number of these variables depends on the degrees of
the polynomials (and on r and n). Denote the result of replacing the coefﬁcients in
δ1,δ2,δ3 by δ ′
1,δ ′
2,δ ′
3.
Then we see, ﬁnally, that the ∀∃-sentence
∀v ∀u ∃w ∃x ∃y (δ ′
1 ∧δ ′
2 →δ ′
3)
expresses the conclusion of the theorem (with m = 1) – at least for polynomials pi
and qj up to a certain degree. However, since such a sentence can be constructed for
every degree, the theorem is thus proved.
⊓⊔
3.3 Model Completeness
In this section we shall introduce a property of theories – model completeness – with
whose help we will be able to prove the completeness of the three remaining theories
whose completeness we had claimed in §1.6. But we shall not do this, since their
completeness can be proved more easily in the next section with an even stronger
property of theories: quantiﬁer elimination. On the whole, however, the concept of
model completeness, and even more so the related concept of a structure that is
existentially closed in a class of structures, is of eminent signiﬁcance, especially
with regard to possible applications.
A set Σ ⊆Sent(L) is called model complete if for each model A of Σ, the set of
L(A)-sentences Σ ∪D(A) is complete. Recall that D(A) is the diagram of A, deﬁned
just before (2.4.2).
Lemma 3.3.1. Σ ⊆Sent(L) is model complete if and only if, for any two models
A,B of Σ with A ⊆B, we even have A ⪯B.
Proof: First suppose Σ is model complete. If A and B are models of Σ with A ⊆
B, then obviously the L(A)-structures (A,|A|) and (B,|A|) are both models of
Σ ∪D(A). We therefore have
(A,|A|) ≡(B,|A|),
by Lemma 3.2.1. This implies A ⪯B, by Corollary 2.4.4.
Now suppose, conversely, that A ⪯B whenever A and B are models of Σ with
A ⊆B. Then we ﬁx a model A of Σ, and show the completeness of Σ ∪D(A). Ob-
viously, (A,|A|) is a model of it. By Lemma 3.2.1, it will sufﬁce to show that every
other model of Σ ∪D(A) is elementarily equivalent to (A,|A|). By Lemma 2.4.2,
such a model contains an isomorphic copy of A. If we identify A with its image,
we may assume that the model being considered is of the form (B,|A|), where even

112
3 Properties of Model Classes
A ⊆B holds. B is, like A, a model of Σ. Therefore A ⪯B holds, by hypothesis.
But then
(A,|A|) ≡(B,|A|)
follows, by Corollary 2.4.4.
⊓⊔
A theory that is model complete need not be complete. For example, as we shall
see in Theorem 3.3.4, the theory of algebraically closed ﬁelds (of arbitrary charac-
teristic) is model complete, but not complete, since the characteristic of a ﬁeld can
be expressed by means of the sentences Cp (recall (1.6.1.4)).
However, if a model complete axiom system Σ ⊆Sent(L) admits a prime model,
then we can deduce the completeness of Σ. Here, an L-structure P is called a prime
model of Σ if P is a model of Σ and P can be embedded isomorphically in every
other model of Σ.
Corollary 3.3.2. Suppose the set Σ ⊆Sent(L) is model complete and admits a prime
model P. Then Σ is complete.
Proof: Let A1 and A2 be models of Σ. We identify P with its isomorphic images
in A1 and A2. Then P ⊆Ai, whence P ⪯Ai (i = 1,2), immediately, by model
completeness. In particular, A1 ≡P ≡A2. Then Σ is complete, by Lemma 3.2.1.
⊓⊔
Now we wish to derive a very useful criterion for proving the model complete-
ness of a theory. For this, we need several deﬁnitions. We shall call an L-formula
existential, or an ∃-formula, if it is of the form
∃x1,...,xn ψ,
with ψ quantiﬁer-free (this generalizes the deﬁnition in Theorem 2.5.4). Analo-
gously, we call a formula of the form
∀x1,...,xn ψ,
with ψ quantiﬁer-free, universal, or an ∀-formula. If A and B are L-structures with
A ⊆B, then in Corollary 2.5.5 we called A existentially closed in B if each ∃-
sentence of the language L(A) that holds in B also holds in A. This is equivalent,
by Lemma 2.4.1, to the condition that for each ∃-formula ϕ of the language L, and
for each evaluation h in A,
B |= ϕ[h]
implies
A |= ϕ[h].
Theorem 3.3.3 (Robinson’s Test). For Σ ⊆Sent(L), the following are equivalent:
(1) Σ is model complete,
(2) for every two models A,B of Σ with A ⊆B, A is existentially closed in B,
(3) to each L-formula ϕ there is a universal L-formula ρ with Fr(ρ) ⊆Fr(ϕ) such
that Σ ⊢∀(ϕ ↔ρ).

3.3 Model Completeness
113
Proof: (1) ⇒(2) follows immediately from Lemma 3.3.1.
(2) ⇒(3): First let ϕ be an existential L-formula with Fr(ϕ) ⊆{v0,...,vn}. We
extend the language L with new constant symbols c0,...,cn (without loss of gener-
ality we may assume {0,...,n}∩K = /0). Let
ϕ′ = ϕ(v0/c0,...,vn/cn).
Let the extended language be called L′.
Let A′,B′ be two L′-models of Σ with A′ ⊆B′. For the L-restrictions A and B of
A′ and B′, respectively, it follows, by (2), that A is existentially closed in B. From
this we get, by Lemma 2.4.1:
B′ |= ϕ′
implies
A′ |= ϕ′.
Therefore, by Theorem 3.1.7, there is a quantiﬁer-free L′-formula δ ′ with
Σ ⊢(ϕ′ ↔∀δ ′).
Here we can, if necessary, arrange, by renaming the (free) variables occurring in δ ′,
that Fr(δ ′)∩{v0,...,vn} = /0. Then, if we set
δ = δ ′(c0/v0,...,cn/vn),
we obtain, using Lemma 1.4.3, that
Σ ⊢∀(ϕ ↔∀x1,...,xm δ),
in case Fr(δ ′) = {x1,...,xm}. Hence we have proved that, “modulo Σ”, each exis-
tential L-formula is equivalent to a universal L-formula. Now we obtain the claim
(3) by induction on the recursive construction of an arbitrary L-formula ϕ:
If ϕ is an atomic formula, then we set ρ = ϕ.
Suppose ϕ = ¬ϕ1. By the inductive hypothesis, there is a universal formula ρ1
such that Fr(ρ1) ⊆Fr(ϕ1) and
Σ ⊢(ϕ1 ↔ρ1).
Then we have, naturally,
Σ ⊢(¬ϕ1 ↔¬ρ1).
As we have just seen, ¬ρ1 is, modulo Σ, equivalent to a universal L-formula ρ with
Fr(ρ) ⊆Fr(¬ρ1). We therefore obtain
Σ ⊢(¬ϕ1 ↔ρ)
with Fr(ρ) ⊆Fr(¬ϕ1).
Next, if ϕ = (ϕ1 ∨ϕ2), then there are, by the inductive hypothesis, universal
formulae ρi, for i = 1,2, such that Fr(ρi) ⊆Fr(ϕi) and

114
3 Properties of Model Classes
Σ ⊢(ϕi ↔ρi).
Then
Σ ⊢((ϕ1 ∧ϕ2) ↔(ρ1 ∧ρ2)).
By pure logic, (ρ1 ∧ρ2) is again equivalent to a universal formula ρ with Fr(ρ) ⊆
Fr(ρ1 ∧ρ2). We therefore obtain, ﬁnally,
Σ ⊢(ϕ ↔ρ)
with
Fr(ρ) ⊆Fr(ϕ).
Finally, let ϕ = ∀xϕ1. Then by the inductive hypothesis, there is a universal
formula ρ1 such that Fr(ρ1) ⊆Fr(ϕ1) and
Σ ⊢(ϕ1 ↔ρ1).
Then we immediately deduce
Σ ⊢(∀xϕ1 ↔∀xρ1)
and also Fr(∀xρ1) ⊆Fr(∀xϕ1). Condition (3) is thus proved.
(3) ⇒(1): We apply Lemma 3.3.1. Let A and B be models of Σ with A ⊆B.
Further, let ϕ be an L-formula and h an evaluation in A. By (3), there is a universal
L-formula ρ with Σ ⊢(ϕ ↔ρ). Then from B |= ϕ[h] follows B |= ρ[h], naturally.
As an immediate consequence, A |= ρ[h], by the universality of ρ. This is equivalent
to A |= ϕ[h]. We have thus proved A ⪯B.
⊓⊔
With the help of Robinson’s Test we can see immediately that, e.g. the theory
of linear orderings without extrema is model complete. For this, let A = ⟨A;<⟩and
A′ = ⟨A′;<′⟩be models of this theory with A ⊆A′. Further, let ∃x1,...,xn δ be an
L(A)-sentence with quantiﬁer-free δ. Let the constant symbols a occurring in δ be
a1,...,am, for certain a1,...,am ∈A. Then
(A′,A) |= ∃x1,...,xn δ
claims the existence of certain elements b1,...,bn in A′ occupying “certain loca-
tions” in relation to the a1,...,am and to each other. Indeed, the formula δ can
express nothing more (for this, recall also Theorem 3.2.3(1)). Now, since ⟨A;<⟩
is dense and without extrema, we see immediately that we can ﬁnd such elements
b1,...,bn in A; i.e. we see that
(A,A) |= ∃x1,...,xn δ.
By Theorem 3.3.3, the model completeness of the theory of dense linear orderings
without extrema is thus proved.
If we try to proceed analogously with the theory of algebraically closed ﬁelds,
we run into difﬁculties. Here it is advisable to work with Corollary 2.5.5, which
presents a very practical method for proving existential closedness.

3.3 Model Completeness
115
Theorem 3.3.4. The theory of algebraically closed ﬁelds is model complete.
Proof: Let A and B be algebraically closed ﬁelds with A ⊆B. We choose a κ-
saturated, elementary extension A′ of A (where we may assume that κ > card(|B|)),
by Theorem 2.5.2. From this follows, ﬁrst, that A′ is also an algebraically closed
ﬁeld, and, second, that card(|A′|) ≥κ > card(|A|). In particular, A′ then has inﬁnite
transcendence degree over A. Therefore every subﬁeld of B that is ﬁnitely generated
over A is embeddable in A′, by a theorem of Steinitz.
Then by Corollary 2.5.5(1)(b) and (2), A is existentially closed in B.
⊓⊔
From the model completeness of the theory of algebraically closed ﬁelds, we
deduce immediately, using Corollary 3.3.2, the completeness in the case of ﬁxed
characteristic. Namely, if the characteristic is 0, then the algebraic closure of Q is
a prime model. And if the characteristic is a prime number p, then the algebraic
closure of Fp is a prime model.
As a small application of Theorem 3.3.4, we prove the “Hilbert Nullstellensatz”,
which actually asserts nothing other than the model completeness of the theory of
algebraically closed ﬁelds.
Theorem 3.3.5 (Hilbert Nullstellensatz). Let I be a proper ideal in the polynomial
ring F[X1,...,Xn] over an algebraically closed ﬁeld F. Then there exist a1,...,an ∈
F with f(a1,...,an) = 0 for all f ∈I.
Proof: Let M be a maximal ideal containing I. The existence of such an ideal M
is guaranteed by Zorn’s Lemma. By the Hilbert Basis Theorem, M is generated
by ﬁnitely many polynomials f1,..., fm ∈F[X1,...,Xn]. Since M is maximal, the
residue ring
F1 = F[X1,...,Xn]

M
is again a ﬁeld – which can, obviously, be regarded as an extension ﬁeld of F. The
polynomials f1,..., fm possess a common zero in F1, namely, (X1 +M,...,Xn +M),
whose coordinates are the residue classes of X1,...,Xn with respect to the ideal M.
Let F1 be the algebraic closure of F1. Then we obtain, clearly,
 F1,|F|

|= ∃x1,...,xn

f1(x1,...,xn) .= 0 ∧···∧fm(x1,...,xn) .= 0

.
Here, fi denotes the L(F)-term that one obtains when one replaces the coefﬁcients
b j in the polynomials fi by the constant symbols bj. By Theorem 3.3.4, F is an
elementary substructure of F1, which implies
(F,|F|) |= ∃x1,...,xn

f1(x1,...,xn) .= 0 ∧···∧fm(x1,...,xn) .= 0

;
i.e. there exist a1,...,an ∈F with f j(a1,...,an) = 0 for 1 ≤j ≤m. However, since
M is generated by f1,..., fm, we even have f(a1,...,an) = 0 for all f ∈M, and, in
particular, for all f ∈I.
⊓⊔
If Σ is model complete, then Theorem 2.4.6 yields a remarkable property of
Mod(Σ). Namely, if (Aν)ν<α is an α-chain of models of Σ, then this is already

116
3 Properties of Model Classes
an elementary chain, due to the model completeness of Σ. Therefore the union

ν<α Aν is, by Theorem 2.4.6, itself a model of Σ. (Note that for limit ordinals
λ < α, 
ν<λ Aν = Aλ need not hold. However, by model completeness, we must
have 
ν<λ Aν ⪯Aλ. We may therefore apply Theorem 2.4.6 to the chain (A′
ν)ν<α
deﬁned by A′
ν+1 = Aν and A′
ν = 
ν<λ Aν for limit ordinals λ < α.)
We shall call a class M of L-structures inductive if it contains the union 
ν<α Aν
of every α-chain (Aν)ν<α of structures in M . If such an M equals Mod(Σ), then
we call Σ inductive. A model complete axiom system Σ is, therefore, always induc-
tive. As we shall see, this has consequences for possible alternate axiomatizations
of Ded(Σ). First, however, we need several preparatory results.
For a set Σ of sentences, we deﬁne
Σ∀∃= {α | Σ ⊢α, and α is an ∀∃-sentence}.
First, we prove:
Lemma 3.3.6. Each model A of Σ∀∃is isomorphic to an existentially closed sub-
structure of a model B of Σ.
Proof: We consider the set
Σ′ = Σ ∪Th(A,A)∀
of L(A)-sentences, where A = |A| and
Th(A,A)∀= {α ∈L(A) | (A,A) |= α, and α is universal}.
First we show that Σ′ admits a model; for this it will sufﬁce, according to the Com-
pactness Theorem, to ﬁnd a model for every ﬁnite subset thereof, and it will there-
fore sufﬁce to ﬁnd a model for every set
Π′ := Σ ∪{α1,...,αm},
with α1,...,αm ∈Th(A,A)∀. Since α1,...,αm are universal, so is (α1 ∧··· ∧αm)
(up to logical equivalence). We may therefore restrict to the case
Π ′ := Σ ∪

∀x1,...,xn δ

x1,...,xn,a1,...,ar

,
where δ ∈Fml(L) is quantiﬁer-free with variables x1,...,xn and y1,...,yr, and
where
(A,A) |= ∀x1,...,xn δ

x1,...,xn,a1,...,ar

.
Here the variables y1,...,yr are replaced by the constants a1,...,ar for certain ele-
ments a1,...,ar ∈A.
Because of this property and the hypothesis A |= Σ∀∃, the sentence
¬∃y1,...,yr ∀x1,...,xn δ(x1,...,xn,y1,...,yr)

3.3 Model Completeness
117
obviously does not belong to Σ∀∃; i.e. it does not hold in all models of Σ. Thus, there
is a model C of Σ with
C |= ∃y1,...,yr ∀x1,...,xn δ(x1,...,xn,y1,...,yr

.
For a suitable interpretation of a1,...,an, we have thus found a model of Π ′.
Now let B′ be a model of Σ ′. Since B′ is, in particular, a model of D(A) (this
is contained in Th(A,A)∀), we can, using Lemma 2.4.2, assume that B′ contains A.
We therefore have B′ = (B,A), where the L-structure B is, then, a model of Σ. It
still remains to show that A is existentially closed in B. But this is clear: namely, if
α is a universal L(A)-formula with (A,A) |= α, then α lies in Th(A,A)∀. But then
α holds also in (B,A). This is clearly equivalent to the existential closedness of A
in B.
⊓⊔
Theorem 3.3.7. For Σ ⊆Sent(L), Σ is inductive if and only if Mod(Σ) = Mod(Σ∀∃).
In particular, Mod(Σ) = Mod(Σ∀∃) in case Σ is model complete.
Proof: Trivially,
Mod(Σ) ⊆Mod(Σ∀∃)
always holds. Now we assume that Mod(Σ) is inductive, and ﬁx a A0 ∈Mod(Σ∀∃).
By Lemma 3.3.6, there is an extension B0 of A0 that is a model of Σ and in which
A0 is existentially closed. By Theorem 2.5.2 there is an elementary, κ-saturated
extension A1 of A0, where κ may be chosen > card(|B0|). (If A0 is ﬁnite, then A0
itself is κ-saturated.) Since A0 is existentially closed in B0, the structure B0 can, by
Corollary 2.5.5(1)(a), be identiﬁed with a substructure of A1. In view of A0 ⪯A1,
A1 is again a model of Σ∀∃, and we can repeat the above-described process.
After inﬁnitely many steps, we thereby obtain a chain
A0 ⊆B0 ⊆A1 ⊆B1 ⊆··· ⊆An ⊆Bn ⊆··· ,
where the subchain
A0 ⊆A1 ⊆A2 ··· ⊆An ⊆···
is elementary. Then Theorem 2.4.6 implies
A0 ⪯

n∈N
An.
Moreover, all the Bn are models of Σ, which, by hypothesis, has

n∈N
Bn |= Σ
as a consequence. If we now consider the obvious equation

n∈N
An =

n∈N
Bn,

118
3 Properties of Model Classes
then we see, ﬁnally, that A0 is a model of Σ. Thus we have proved the relation
Mod(Σ) = Mod(Σ∀∃) for inductive Σ.
The converse follows immediately from Remark 2.4.7.
⊓⊔
Again let Σ ⊆Sent(L). We shall call an axiom system Σ∗⊆Sent(L) a (strict)
model companion3 of Σ if:
(i)
every model of Σ∗is also a model of Σ.
(ii) every model of Σ can be extended to a model of Σ∗.
(iii) Σ ∗is model complete.
Instead of considering an axiom system Σ, we can consider the theory T = Ded(Σ)
belonging to it. Then (i) says precisely that T ∗= Ded(Σ ∗) is an extension theory of
T.
As examples, we have, so far, (a) the theory T ∗of dense linear orderings without
extrema as the model companion of, say, the theory T of linear orderings (axiom-
atized by O1, O2, O3 of §1.6), and (b) the theory T ∗of algebraically closed ﬁelds
as the model companion of, say, the theory T of ﬁelds (axiomatized by K1–K9 of
§1.6). In the ﬁrst case, we observe that for a linear ordering A = ⟨A;<⟩, the lexico-
graphically ordered product A×Q is a model of T ∗. In the second case, the algebraic
closure of a ﬁeld is a model of T ∗.
In general, a theory T need not admit a model companion – e.g. the theory of
commutative rings has no model companion. However, if there is a model compan-
ion T ∗to a theory T, then it is uniquely determined. This, and the manner in which
the model class of T ∗can be determined, are stated in the following theorem; to
formulate it, we need one more deﬁnition.
If M is a class of L-structures, then we call A ∈M existentially closed in M if
A is existentially closed in each B ∈M with A ⊆B. We set
E(M ) = {A ∈M | A is existentially closed in M }.
If M = Mod(Σ), then we write E(Σ) for E(Mod(Σ)).
Theorem 3.3.8. Let T and T ∗be L-theories.
(1) If T ∗is a model companion of T, then Mod(T ∗) = E(T).
(2) If T is inductive and E(T) is axiomatizable – say, E(T) = Mod(Σ∗) – , then
T ∗= Ded(Σ∗) is a model companion of T.
Proof: (1) If A is a model of T ∗and A ⊆B, where B is a model of T, then we
ﬁnd, by (ii), a model C of T ∗with
A ⊆B ⊆C.
By (iii), T ∗is model complete, whence A ⪯C. From this it follows that, for every
existential L(A)-sentence δ, if (B,|A|) |= δ, then, ﬁrst, (C,|A|) |= δ, and, ﬁnally,
(A,|A|) |= δ.
3 The reason for including the word “strict” will become clear in Exercise 3.5.5.

3.3 Model Completeness
119
We have hence proved
Mod(T ∗) ⊆E(T).
For the opposite inclusion, we consider an A ∈E(T), and extend it using (ii) to a
model B of T ∗. Since A is existentially closed in B, we can, using Theorem 2.5.2
and Corollary 2.5.5(1)(a), embed the structure B in a sufﬁciently saturated elemen-
tary extension C of A. We therefore have the following situation:
A ⊆B ⊆C
and
A ⪯C.
By Theorem 3.3.7, Mod(T ∗) = Mod(T ∗
∀∃). It therefore sufﬁces to show that every
∀∃-sentence ϕ in T ∗holds in A.
Let ϕ ∈T ∗be of the form
ϕ = ∀x1,...,xn ∃y1,...,ym δ,
with quantiﬁer-free δ. Since B |= T ∗, we have, in particular, B |= ϕ. Now if
a1,...,an ∈|A| = A, then we have
(B,A) |= ∃y1,...,ym δ

x1/a1,...,xn/an

.
This transfers, trivially, to (C,A), and thence, ﬁnally, using A ⪯C, to (A,A). Alto-
gether, we thus obtain A |= ϕ.
(2) If E(T) = Mod(Σ∗), then, in particular, for A,B ∈Mod(Σ∗) with A ⊆B, A
is existentially closed in B. Then, by Theorem 3.3.3(2), Σ∗is model complete. It
therefore remains to prove (ii); i.e. if A is a model of T, then we need a B ∈E(T)
with A ⊆B. This follows from the inductiveness of T, using the next theorem.
⊓⊔
From Theorem 3.3.8(1), the uniqueness of a possible model companion T ∗of T
follows immediately. Namely, if T ′ is another theory that is a model companion of
T, then (1) yields
Mod(T ∗) = Mod(T ′).
From this follows, using the G¨odel Completeness Theorem 1.5.2,
T ∗= Ded(T ∗) = Ded(T ′) = T ′.
Theorem 3.3.9. Let M be an inductive class of L-structures. Then to every A ∈M
there is an A∗∈E(M ) with A ⊆A∗.
Proof: The construction of A∗is similar to the construction in the proof of Theo-
rem 2.5.2. We construct an ω-chain

A(n)
n∈N in M with A(0) = A.
If A(n) ∈M has already been deﬁned, then let

ϕ(n)

A(n+1) =

where the αn-chain

ν<αn is deﬁned as follows:

By the inductiveness of M , A(n+1) lies again in M . Finally, we set
A∗=

n∈N
A(n).
Now if ϕ is an existential L(A∗)-sentence, then only ﬁnitely many constant symbols
a with a ∈|A∗| occur in ϕ. Then ϕ is already an L

A(n)
-sentence for some n, and
therefore has an index ν < αn. Let ϕ be, say, ϕ(n)
ν . If ϕ holds in an extension B ∈M
of A∗, then it clearly also holds in an extension of A(n)
ν
(namely, in B). But then ϕ
also holds in A(n)
ν+1, by deﬁnition. Because of the existential character of ϕ, we thus
obtain, ﬁnally, the truth of ϕ in A∗. Therefore A∗is existentially closed in M .
⊓⊔
3.4 Quantiﬁer Elimination
In the previous section we concerned ourselves with theories in which every formula
is equivalent to an ∀-formula. Now we turn our attention to the stronger condition
that every formula is even equivalent to a quantiﬁer-free formula. In order for this
to be possible even for sentences of our language L, we always assume in this con-
nection the existence of a(n individual) constant symbol, i.e. K ̸= /0. (Otherwise we
must introduce a sentence-constant symbol T that holds in every L-structure.) Then
we say that Σ ⊆Sent(L) admits quantiﬁer elimination (brieﬂy, “Σ admits QE”), if
to each L-formula ϕ there is a quantiﬁer-free L-formula δ with
Σ ⊢∀(ϕ ↔δ)
and
Fr(δ) ⊆Fr(ϕ).
(3.4.0.1)
The proof of the quantiﬁer elimination property usually proceeds with the help of
the following criterion. Here we call a formula ϕ a simple existence formula if it has
the form ∃x δ with δ quantiﬁer-free.
Theorem 3.4.1. For Σ ⊆Sent(L), the following are equivalent:
(1) Σ admits quantiﬁer elimination.
(2) Σ ∪D(A) is complete for every substructure A of a model of Σ.
(3) For every two models B1 and B2 of Σ with a common, ﬁnitely generated sub-
structure A, and for every simple existence sentence ϕ of the language L(A):
(B1,|A|)
ϕ⇝(B2,|A|).

3.4 Quantiﬁer Elimination
121
Proof: (1) ⇒(2): Let B′
1 and B′
2 be models of Σ ∪D(A). By Lemma 2.4.2, B′
1
and B′
2 have substructures isomorphic to A. We identify these with A. If we denote
the L-restriction of B′
ν by Bν, for ν = 1,2, then, writing A = |A|, we obviously
have
B′
ν = (Bν,A).
Let ϕ′ be an L(A)-sentence. If we think of ϕ′ as arising from a suitable L-formula
ϕ by the substitution of constant symbols a for its free variables, and if δ is a
quantiﬁer-free formula satisfying (3.4.0.1), then we see that there is a quantiﬁer-
free L(A)-sentence δ ′ with
Σ ⊢(ϕ′ ↔δ ′).
Now, if ϕ′ holds in (B1,A), then so does δ ′. This has as consequences, ﬁrst,
(A,A) |= δ ′, and then (B2,A) |= δ ′, since δ ′ is quantiﬁer-free. This leads back to
(B2,A) |= ϕ′. Altogether, we therefore have
(B1,A) ≡(B2,A).
Then by Lemma 3.2.1, Σ ∪D(A) is complete.
(2) ⇒(3) is trivial, since (3) is a special case of (2) (using Lemma 3.2.1).
(3) ⇒(1): Let ϕ be an L-formula. Later we shall prove, by induction on the
recursive construction of ϕ, the existence of a quantiﬁer-free L-formula δ satisfying
(3.4.0.1). But ﬁrst we shall treat the special case in which ϕ is of the form ∃xγ with
γ quantiﬁer-free.
Suppose Fr(ϕ) ⊆{v0,...,vn}. We extend the language L with new constants
c0,...,cn (where {0,...,n}∩K = /0). Let
ϕ′ = ϕ(v0/c0,...,vn/cn).
Call the resulting language L′. Let Γ be the set of all quantiﬁer-free sentences of L′.
Further, let B′
1 and B′
2 be models of Σ, in the language L′, with B′
1
Γ⇝B′
2. We wish
to show B′
1
ϕ⇝B′
2, in order to be able to apply Lemma 3.1.6.
Let Bν be the restriction of B′
ν to L, for ν = 1,2. Then the structure B′
ν has the
form
B′
ν =

Bν,

a(ν)
0 ,...,a(ν)
n

,
where a(ν)
μ
is the interpretation of cμ in |Bν|, for 0 ≤μ ≤n. Let CT′ be the set of
constant terms of L′. One can think of each term t′ in CT′ as arising from an L-term
t by the substitution of c0,...,cn for the variables v0,...,vn; i.e.
t′ = t(v0/c0,...,vn/cn).
The interpretation t′B′ν of t′ in B′
ν is, then, an element of |Bν|. We have

.
Now we set
Aν :=

t′B′ν  t′ ∈CT′ 
.
As we see immediately, Aν is closed under all functions f Bν
j
(j ∈J) of the structure
Bν, and contains all constant interpretations cBν
k
(k ∈K). Therefore Aν deﬁnes a
substructure Aν of Bν, by (2.3.0.1). Obviously, Aν is ﬁnitely generated – namely,
by a(ν)
0 ,...,a(ν)
n .
We deﬁne an isomorphism τ from A1 to A2 by
τ

:= t′B′
2.
The well-deﬁnedness and the injectivity of the mapping τ are contained in the fol-
lowing equivalence (“⇒” is the well-deﬁnedness, and “⇐” is the injectivity). Let t′
1
and t′
2 be in CT′. Then we have:
t′

2. The surjectivity of τ is trivial. It remains to prove the conditions (I2), (I3), and
(I4) of Section 2.2. Here, (I3) and (I4) are trivially fulﬁlled. (I2) remains. So let Ri
be a relation symbol with i ∈I. Then for t′
1,...,t′
λ(i) ∈CT′, we have:

Thus we have, ﬁnally, found isomorphic, ﬁnitely generated substructures A1 and
A2 of B1 and B2, respectively. If we identify these, then the sentence ϕ′ can be
transferred from B′
1 to B′
2; i.e. B′
1
ϕ′
⇝B′
2. Using Lemma 3.1.6, we obtain a sentence
δ ′ ∈Γ with Σ ⊢(ϕ′ ↔δ ′). Since the interpretation of the new constant symbols
c0,...,cn in the model B of Σ was completely arbitrary, we immediately obtain
from this that
Σ ⊢∀(ϕ ↔δ),

3.4 Quantiﬁer Elimination
123
where δ = δ ′(c0/v0,...,cn/vn) is a quantiﬁer-free L-formula.
Thus we have taken care of the special case ϕ = ∃xγ with γ quantiﬁer-free. Now
we come to the induction on the recursive construction of ϕ.
If ϕ is atomic, we take δ = ϕ.
If ϕ = ¬ϕ1 and if (by the inductive hypothesis) δ1 is quantiﬁer-free with
Σ ⊢(ϕ1 ↔δ1)
and
Fr(δ1) ⊆Fr(ϕ1),
(3.4.1.1)
then we take δ = ¬δ1 and obtain what we need.
If ϕ = (ϕ1 ∧ϕ2) and if, by the inductive hypothesis, δ1 and δ2 are quantiﬁer-free
with
Σ ⊢(ϕν ↔δν)
and
Fr(δν) ⊆Fr(ϕν)
for ν = 1,2, then we take δ = (δ1 ∧δ2) and again obtain what we need.
Finally, if ϕ = ∀xϕ1 and if, by the inductive hypothesis, δ1 is quantiﬁer-free
satisfying (3.4.1.1), then it follows, ﬁrst, that
Σ ⊢(∀xϕ1 ↔∀xδ1) and
Fr(∀xδ1) ⊆Fr(∀xϕ1).
(3.4.1.2)
By the special case handled above, we obtain a quantiﬁer-free δ with
Σ ⊢(∀xδ1 ↔δ)
and
Fr(δ) ⊆Fr(∀xδ1).
(3.4.1.3)
But (3.4.1.2) and (3.4.1.3) combine to give
Σ ⊢(∀xϕ1 ↔δ)
and
Fr(δ) ⊆Fr(∀xϕ1).
⊓⊔
Because of property (2), a theory that admits quantiﬁer elimination is also called
substructure complete (by analogy with the deﬁnition of “model complete”).
An L-structure P that can be embedded in every model of an axiom system Σ is
called a prime substructure for Σ. From Theorem 3.4.1(2) we therefore obtain the
following
Corollary 3.4.2. If Σ ⊆Sent(L) admits quantiﬁer elimination, and if Σ has a prime
substructure, then Σ is complete.
⊓⊔
From the deﬁnition of quantiﬁer elimination (and with the help of Robinson’s
Test 3.3.3), or from Theorem 3.4.1(2), we see immediately that every theory admit-
ting quantiﬁer elimination is, naturally, model complete. The converse, as we shall
see later, does not hold in general. The following theorem identiﬁes the obstruction.
Here we shall say that Σ ⊆Sent(L) has the amalgamation property if, for every two
models B1,B2 of Σ, and for every common substructure A of B1 and B2, there are
embeddings τν : Bν →B (ν = 1,2) into a model B of Σ such that τ1(a) = τ2(a)
for all a ∈|A|.

124
3 Properties of Model Classes
Theorem 3.4.3. Σ ⊆Sent(L) admits quantiﬁer elimination if and only if Σ is model
complete and has the amalgamation property.
Proof: First suppose Σ is model complete and has the amalgamation property. We
argue using Theorem 3.4.1(3). Let B1 and B2 be models of Σ with the common
substructure A. By hypothesis, there exist embeddings τν : Bν →B (ν = 1,2) into
a model B of Σ such that τ1|A = τ2|A, where A = |A|.
Now let ϕ be a simple existential L(A)-sentence with (B1,A) |= ϕ. Because of
the existential character of ϕ, we immediately deduce (B,τ1|A) |= ϕ, which, in turn,
leads to (B,τ2|A) |= ϕ using the hypothesis that τ1|A = τ2|A. From the model com-
pleteness of Σ, it follows that the embedding τ2 (and, naturally, also τ1) is elemen-
tary. We therefore obtain, ﬁnally, (B2,A) |= ϕ. We have thus proved criterion (3) of
Theorem 3.4.1.
Now suppose Σ admits quantiﬁer elimination. It remains to prove the amalga-
mation property. So let B1 and B2 be models of Σ with the common substructure
A. Then, with the help of Theorem 2.5.2, we choose a κ-saturated, elementary ex-
tension B of B2, where we may take κ > card(|B1|). Then by Theorem 2.5.4, the
structure (B1,|A|) can be embedded in (B,|A|), provided every ∃-sentence of the
L(A)-language that holds in (B1,|A|) also holds in (B,|A|). But this is guaranteed
by criterion (2) of Theorem 3.4.1. We therefore have an embedding τ1 : B1 →B
that is the identity on |A|. On the other hand, the identity mapping is naturally an
embedding of B2 into B; in particular, this embedding agrees with τ1 on |A|. As an
elementary extension of B2, B is, ﬁnally, also a model of Σ.
⊓⊔
We observe, moreover, that in the last proof, when proving quantiﬁer elimina-
tion under the hypothesis of the amalgamation property, we did not exploit the full
strength of the model completeness hypothesis on Σ, but rather only the following
– in general not equivalent – consequence of model completeness: if A and B are
models of Σ with A ⊆B, then every simple existential L(A)-sentence that holds in
(B,|A|) already holds in (A,|A|). This observation can in some cases signiﬁcantly
simplify the proof of quantiﬁer elimination in the presence of the amalgamation
property.
Before bringing this section to a close, we would like to prove quantiﬁer elimina-
tion for the theory of algebraically closed ﬁelds, without falling back on earlier re-
sults based on the theorems of Steinitz. By means of criterion (3) of Theorem 3.4.1,
we shall show that the algebraic facts that we shall need to bring in are very simple.
On the other hand, however, from quantiﬁer elimination will immediately follow
model completeness for this theory (Theorem 3.3.4), and, for ﬁxed characteristic,
using Corollary 3.4.2, also completeness (Theorem 3.2.3(3)). As for the hypothesis
of Corollary 3.4.2, we need observe only that the prime subﬁeld Q, or Fp for a prime
number p, is obviously a prime substructure.
Theorem 3.4.4. The theory of algebraically closed ﬁelds admits quantiﬁer elimina-
tion.
Proof: We shall prove condition (3) of Theorem 3.4.1. For this, let F1 and F2 (in
the usual notation for ﬁelds) be algebraically closed ﬁelds, and A a common sub-
structure. It is clear that A must be a subring of F1 and F2. We may therefore assume

3.4 Quantiﬁer Elimination
125
that the quotient ﬁeld F of A is likewise contained in F1 and F2. It is well known
that the algebraic closure F of a ﬁeld F is, up to isomorphism, uniquely determined.
We may therefore assume, further, that F is contained in F1 and F2; i.e. we have the
situation

@
@
F
F1
F2
where all three ﬁelds are algebraically closed.
Let ∃xδ be an L(A)-sentence with δ quantiﬁer-free and (F1,A) |= ∃xδ, where
A = |A|. We must show (F2,A) |= ∃xδ. For simplicity, in the following we shall
write only Fν for (Fν,A).
Without loss of generality we can assume that δ is given in disjunctive normal
form, i.e.
δ = (δ1 ∨···∨δm),
where δν is a conjunction of atomic formulae and negated atomic formulae. Since
∃xδ is logically equivalent to
(∃xδ1 ∨···∨∃xδm),
at least one disjunct ∃xδν must hold in F1. If we can show F2 |= ∃xδν, then F2 |= ∃xδ
will naturally follow.
We may further assume that δν has the following form:
 r
i=1
pi(x) .= 0 ∧
s
j=1
q j(x) ̸= 0

(where the cases r = 0 or s = 0 are not excluded). Here, pi and q j are polynomials
in x, whose coefﬁcients are themselves polynomials in the constants a1,...,an oc-
curring in δ, with integer coefﬁcients. More precisely, these “integer” coefﬁcients
are terms that may be taken to be of the form ±(1+···+1).
If the interpretations of the coefﬁcients of the terms pi (1 ≤i ≤r) yield at least
one nonzero polynomial in A[x], then any element b ∈F1 that satisﬁes δν in F1 must
lie already in F. Thus F |= ∃xδν, whence, a fortiori, F2 |= ∃xδν. If, on the other
hand, all the terms pi yield only the identically zero polynomial, or if r = 0, then
it sufﬁces to ﬁnd an element b ∈F that differs from all the zeros of polynomials in
A[x] determined by the terms qj. One such b exists, since none of the terms qj(x)
can yield the identically zero polynomial in x (so that there are only ﬁnitely many
such zeros), and F, being an algebraically closed ﬁeld, has inﬁnite cardinality. We
therefore have F2 |= ∃xδν, and hence again F2 |= ∃xδ.
⊓⊔
As an application of quantiﬁer elimination for the theory of algebraically closed
ﬁelds F, one gets, e.g. that for F, the projections of constructible subsets of the
afﬁne space Fn are again constructible. Here we call a subset M of Fn constructible
if it is a Boolean combination of algebraic sets. In our language, this means that

126
3 Properties of Model Classes
M is deﬁned by a quantiﬁer-free formula; more precisely, there is a quantiﬁer-free
formula δ of the language L(F) with Fr(δ) ⊆{x1,...,xn}, such that
M =

(a1,...,an) ∈Fn
 F |= δ


.
A projection of M, e.g. along the ﬁrst coordinate, is then just the set
M1 =

(a2,...,an) ∈Fn−1 F |= ∃x1 δ

x1,a2,...,an

.
Since ∃x1 δ is can be replaced by an equivalent quantiﬁer-free formula δ1 with
Fr(δ1) ⊆{x2,...,xn}, we see that M1 is again constructible.

For each of the following subclasses of ModL, determine whether it is open,

ΣR ∪ΣR′ ⊢∀x1,...,xn (R(x1,...,xn) ↔R′(x1,...,xn)).

From Exercise 3.5.2 deduce Beth’s Theorem, which says that if R is implicitly de-

(a) The theory of dense linear orderings without extrema is not ℵ1-categorical.
(b) The theory of algebraically closed ﬁelds of a ﬁxed characteristic is not ℵ0-
categorical.
(c) The theory of divisible, ordered, Abelian groups is neither ℵ0- nor ℵ1-
categorical.
3.5.5. Let Σ ⊆Sent(L). An axiom system Σ∗⊆Sent(L) is called a model companion
of Σ if:
(i) every model of Σ∗embeds in a model of Σ,
(ii) every model of Σ embeds in a model of Σ∗,
(iii) Σ ∗is model complete.
Prove the following facts:
(a) A strict model companion of Σ (deﬁned on p. 118) is also a model companion.
(b) A model companion Σ∗of Σ is uniquely determined (if it exists).
(c) If Mod(Σ) is inductive, then a model companion is already strict.
3.5.6. Show that the theory of “proper” integral domains (i.e. those that are not
already ﬁelds) admits a model companion that is not strict.
3.5.7. Show that the theory T of commutative rings R = ⟨R;+R,−R,·R;0R,1R⟩with
1 (axiomatized by K1–K6,K8,K9) has no (strict) model companion.
Hint: Show that in every existentially closed model R of T:
(a) x ∈R is nilpotent if and only if R |= ∀y((xy)2 .= xy →xy .= 0), and
(b) there are nilpotent elements in R of every order of nilpotency, i.e. to every n ∈N\{0} there
is an x ∈R with xn ̸= 0 but xn+1 = 0.
From this deduce that the class E(T) is not axiomatizable. Now apply Theorem 3.3.8(1).
3.5.8. Let L = (+,0). Show that the axioms for Abelian groups do not admit quan-
tiﬁer elimination.


Chapter 4
Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
In this chapter we investigate a series of interesting algebraic theories for the prop-
erties of completeness, model completeness and quantiﬁer elimination. Not only do
we treat the standard examples that have already been frequently treated in the ex-
tant literature, but we shall place special value on the theory of valued ﬁelds. Since
valuation theory does not belong in the standard repertoire of an algebra course,
we shall ﬁrst discuss the necessary concepts and theorems in detail, in Section 4.3.
Thereafter we develop special cases (Sections 4.4 and 4.5), and ﬁnally the model
theory of Henselian valued ﬁelds. The goal of this presentation is, among other
things, a treatment of a purely number theoretic problem – Artin’s conjecture – in
Theorem 4.6.5.
4.1 Ordered Abelian Groups
We begin the model theoretic investigation of algebraic theories with the theory of
ordered Abelian groups. As an axiom system of this theory we shall use
{G1,G2,G3,G4}∪{O1,O2,O3,OG}∪{∃x x ̸= 0}
in a language L with the usual symbols <, +, 0 (recall Section 1.6, and note that
here we do not consider the trivial group as an ordered group). Then models have
the form
A = ⟨A; <A; +A; 0A⟩.
For this we also write, simply,
A = ⟨A; <; +; 0⟩

If G is an ordered Abelian group, then G may possess a smallest positive element;
i.e. the following sentence may hold in G:
DO:
∃x(0 < x ∧∀y(0 < y →x .= y ∨x < y)).
In this case we called G discrete ordered in Section 1.6(4). The integers Z with their
usual ordering furnish an example of this. If, on the other hand, G has no smallest
positive element, then G is densely ordered (i.e. O4 of Section 1.6(1) holds). Indeed,
if a,b ∈|G| with a < b, and if 0 < c < b−a, then it naturally follows that
a < c+a < b.
Now, in the next two theorems, we would like to investigate two special classes
of ordered Abelian groups. We begin with
Theorem 4.1.1. The theory of divisible, ordered, Abelian groups admits quantiﬁer
elimination, and is complete and model complete.
Proof: Model completeness follows immediately from quantiﬁer elimination; and
completeness follows from Corollary 3.4.2, since obviously O = ⟨{0}; /0; +; 0⟩
with 0+0 = 0 is a prime substructure.
To prove quantiﬁer elimination, we proceed just as we did in the proof of Theo-
rem 3.4.4. Let G1 and G2 be divisible ordered groups, and H a common substructure.
H is a semigroup with the cancellation property. (Observe that the inverse operation
is not in our language.) However, H equals O or generates isomorphic ordered sub-
groups in G1 and G2; even their divisible hulls in G1 and G2 are still isomorphic.
We identify them, and denote them by H. We therefore have the following situation:

@
@
H
G1
G2
Here the case H = H = O is not excluded.
As in the proof of Theorem 3.4.4, it sufﬁces to consider the case in which δν is a
conjunction of atomic formulae or negated atomic formulae of the language L(H),
and that at most x is free in δν. We assume G1 |= ∃xδν, and show G2 |= ∃xδν.
For this, however, we can still make several simpliﬁcations in δν: we replace the
formulae
¬(t1 .= t2)
by
(t1 < t2 ∨t2 < t1)
and
¬(t1 < t2)
by
(t2 < t1 ∨t1 .= t1).
(4.1.1.1)
For ordered groups, this is an equivalent replacement. If we then bring the result
again into disjunctive normal form, and distribute the existential quantiﬁer ∃x over
each disjunct, then we may assume δν to be of the form

4.1 Ordered Abelian Groups

i=1
nix+ai .= n′
ix+a′
i ∧

j=1

.
Here we have already carried out possible group theoretic transformations, and in-
troduced new constants (e.g. replacement of a + b by a+b). As usual, nx denotes
the n-fold sum x + ··· + x when n > 0. The cases r = 0 or s = 0 is allowed. All
constants a belong to elements a ∈|H|.
Now, if some equation is nontrivial, i.e. ni ̸= n′
i, then any element d in G1 that
satisﬁes δν lies already in H. We therefore have H |= ∃xδν, and hence also G2 |=
∃xδν. If all equations are trivial, i.e. ni = n′
i for 1 ≤i ≤r, or if r = 0, then an element
d of G1 obviously satisﬁes the formula δν if and only if
ai = a′
i
for
1 ≤i ≤r
and
(m j −m′
j)d < b′
j −bj for
1 ≤j ≤s.
If G1 contains such an element, then so does H, clearly, in case H ̸= O. And in this
case, H |= ∃xδν holds, and hence also G2 |= ∃xδν. On the other hand, if H = O,
then bj = b′
j for 1 ≤j ≤s. Then ∃xδν asserts merely (1) ai = a′
i and (in case s > 0)
(2) the existence of an element that is positive or negative, which naturally holds in
G2, too.
⊓⊔
Corollary 4.1.2. The theory of divisible, ordered, Abelian groups is the model com-
panion of the theory of ordered Abelian groups.
Proof: Upon applying Theorem 4.1.1, it remains only to show that each ordered
Abelian group G can be embedded in a divisible, ordered, Abelian group. We shall
show that G can be embedded in its so-called divisible hull. This can be deﬁned
by analogy with the construction of Q from Z, as follows. We consider pairs (a,n),
where a ∈|G| and n ∈N\{0} (here we think of quotients a
n). We declare two pairs
(a,n) and (a′,n′) to be equivalent if n′a = na′. Now one may easily check that the
equivalence classes of such pairs form a divisible, ordered, Abelian group G, once
we deﬁne addition in G by
(a,n)+(a′,n′) = (n′a+na′,nn′),
and an ordering on G by
(a,n) < (a′,n′)
iff
n′a < na′.
G embeds in G via a →(a,1). Thus G is a divisible extension of G with the property:
to each b ∈
 G
 there is an a ∈|G| and an n ∈N \ {0} with nb = a. Moreover, G
is, up to isomorphism, the unique divisible, ordered, Abelian extension group of G
with this property.
⊓⊔
In the next theorem we shall show, among other things, that the theory of Z-
groups is model complete. When axiomatizing this theory in Section 1.6, we added

132
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
a constant symbol 1 to the language of ordered groups. The restriction of Z-groups
to the language of ordered groups can also be axiomatized: we need only describe
1 implicitly. The axioms are, then, the axioms given above for discrete, ordered,
Abelian groups, together with
D−
n :
∀u(0 < u ∧∀y(0 < y →u .= y ∨u < y) →Dn(1/u)).1
In each model of this axiom system Σ, there is a smallest positive element – the
interpretation of 1 in the extended language. Obviously, Z and 2Z are both models
of Σ, and 2Z is a substructure of Z (in the language of ordered groups). However,
this is no longer true in the language extended by 1, since that symbol would be
interpreted in 2Z as 2, in order to obtain a Z-group. We therefore have here a case
in which the substructure relation changes upon extending the language.
In the following theorem, we shall show that the theory of Z-groups is complete
and model complete. From this, the completeness of the theory just described (with-
out 1) will also follow. We thereby obtain an example of a complete theory that is
not model complete. (Indeed, in the language without 1, we have 2Z ⊆Z, but not
2Z ⪯Z.)
Theorem 4.1.3. The theory of Z-groups is model complete and complete.
Proof: Completeness follows from model completeness by Corollary 3.3.2, since
Z is obviously a prime model. We shall obtain model completeness via a detour
through quantiﬁer elimination in a suitable extension language.
Let L be the language in which we axiomatized the theory of Z-groups in Sec-
tion 1.6. We extend this language by the addition of a unary relation Rn for every
n ≥2 (without loss of generality, let I ∩N = /0). Then we extend the axiom system
Σ for Z-groups to Σ′, by adding the axioms
An :
∀x(Rn(x) ↔∃y x .= ny).
Thus, the relation Rn expresses divisibility by n. The axioms Dn can thus be refor-
mulated as
D′
n :
∀x
n
ν=1
Rn(x+ν1).
The restrictions to L of models of Σ′ are exactly the Z-groups. Observe that the
substructure relation between models A and B of Σ continues to hold when we
extend these to models A′ and B′ of Σ′ by interpreting the relations Rn according to
the axioms An. Namely, if for an element a ∈|A|, the statement
a ≡ν mod n
1 Recall, the notation Dn(1/u) was deﬁned in (1.6.1.1) and (1.2.0.9).

4.1 Ordered Abelian Groups
133
holds in B (i.e. if a−ν1 is divisible by n in B), then this must also hold in A, since
a is congruent to a ν′ modulo n also in A. This ν′ must inevitably be equal to ν.
We obtain the language L′ by further adding a unary function symbol, which
we interpret as the additive inverse operation. Because of this, Σ ′ contains also the
axiom
K3 :
∀x x+(−x) = 0.
This extension does not alter the substructure relation between models, obviously.
Now we show that Σ ′ admits quantiﬁer elimination. Σ′ will thus be model com-
plete, which, because of the invariance of the substructure relation, will imply the
model completeness of Σ.
We shall prove the quantiﬁer elimination of Σ′ directly in this case, i.e. we will
not use Theorem 3.4.1, but rather successively transform a formula ϕ into formulae
equivalent to it modulo Σ′, until we obtain a quantiﬁer-free formula δ; at every
stage, the set of free variables will contain at most those of ϕ. Here we say that α
is “equivalent to β modulo Σ′” if Σ′ ⊢(α ↔β), i.e. if in all models A of Σ′ and for
every evaluation h, we have:
A |= α [h]
iff
A |= β [h].
Obviously it will sufﬁce if, for every quantiﬁer-free formula δ and every variable x,
we can ﬁnd a quantiﬁer-free formula δ1 such that ∃xδ is equivalent to δ1 modulo
Σ ′. Then one continues as in the proof of Theorem 3.4.1, (3)⇒(1), by induction on
the recursive construction of formulae.
It sufﬁces, furthermore, to consider only unnegated occurrences of the relations
Rn(t) in δ. Namely, we can, by D′
n, replace ¬Rn(t) by
Rn(t +1)∨···∨Rn(t +(n−1)1),
which is equivalent to it modulo Σ′. We replace negations of t1 .= t2 and t1 < t2 as
in (4.1.1.1). Then, if we bring δ into disjunctive normal form, and distribute the
existential quantiﬁer ∃x over the individual disjuncts, we see that the only case yet
to be treated is that in which δ is of the form

stands for
Rni(m′′

The cases r = 0, r′ = 0, or r′′ = 0 are not excluded.
One sees easily that we can arrange, by multiplication by a suitable integer (̸=
0), that all coefﬁcients mi,m′
i,m′′
i are equal to a single integer m. (In the case of a
congruence, one must, naturally, multiply also the modulus ni by the same integer!)

If we replace mx by y, and add the condition y ≡0 mod m, then we again obtain an
equivalent formula modulo Σ′. After this step, we can, ﬁnally, assume that δ has the

∃xδ is obviously equivalent, modulo Σ′, to

In this case, we have eliminated the quantiﬁer ∃x. If, on the other hand, no equation
occurs (i.e. if r = 0), but at least one inequality x < t+
i occurs, then, letting n be the
least (positive) common multiple of n1,...,nr′′,2 we observe that in every model A
of the system
x ≡t′′
i mod ni
(1 ≤i ≤r′′),
if x is in A, then so is x+ln for all l ∈Z. Setting
t+ = min
1≤i≤r+t+
i ,
we can obviously select x from the set
{t+ −1,t+ −2,...,t+ −n}.
Therefore ∃xδ can, modulo Σ′, be expressed without quantiﬁers, as follows:

where
t−= max

In this case, we can describe ∃xδ without quantiﬁers, by

⊓⊔
Corollary 4.1.4. The theory of Z-groups (in the language with 1) is the model com-
panion of the theory of discrete, ordered, Abelian groups.
Proof: Upon application of Theorem 4.1.3, it remains only to show that every dis-
crete, ordered, Abelian group G can be extended to a Z-group. For this, we work in
the ordered divisible hull G of G (compare the proof of Corollary 4.1.2).
Let H be a maximal extension of G in G such that 1G is still the minimal positive
element of H. The existence of H is guaranteed by Zorn’s lemma. Further, let p be
a prime number. If a ∈H is not divisible (in H) by p, then the extension H + Z a
p
of H no longer has 1G as minimal positive element, by maximality. Thus, there is a
b ∈H and an m ∈Z not divisible by p such that
0 < b+m a
p < 1.
(From now on we write simply n for n1G.) From this follows
0 < pb+ma < p.
(4.1.4.1)
Since m and p are relatively prime, there are s,t ∈Z with
sp+tm = 1.
(4.1.4.2)
In the case where 0 < t, (4.1.4.1) and (4.1.4.2) yield
0 < tpb+(1−sp)a < pt,
or, upon rearranging,
0 < p(tb−sa)+a < pt.
By the discreteness of H, it follows that
p(tb−sa)+a = r,
for some r ∈Z. This follows also in the case where t < 0. Therefore,
a−r = pa1,
(4.1.4.3)

136
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
for some a1 ∈H. Note that we have derived (4.1.4.3) from the hypothesis that p does
not divide a in H; but (4.1.4.3) continues to hold, trivially, also when this hypothesis
is not satisﬁed (namely, take r = 0). Therefore, for the above a1 and for any prime
number q, this process can be repeated – say,
a1 −r1 = qa2,
(4.1.4.4)
for some a2 ∈H and r1 ∈Z. Combining (4.1.4.3) and (4.1.4.4), we get
a−r′ = pqa2a1,
for some r′ ∈Z. It is now clear that for every n ≥2, we can ﬁnd an r ∈Z with
a−r ∈nH,
where we may, in addition, assume that 0 ≤r < n still holds. We have therefore
shown that H is a Z-group.
⊓⊔
4.2 Ordered Fields
Now we wish to prove, ﬁnally, the completeness of the theory of real closed ﬁelds
– the last of the theories whose completeness we had, in Section 1.6, asserted. We
begin with a short (but not complete) introduction to the algebraic theory of ordered
ﬁelds. For literature on this, we refer to [Prestel–Delzell, 2001].
Let F be a ﬁeld. An ordering on F can be given either by a binary relation <
on F satisfying the axioms O1, O2, O3, OK1 and OK2 (from Section 1.6), or by a
positive cone: this is a subset P of F with the following properties:
P+P ⊆P,
P·P ⊆P,
P∩−P = {0},
P∪−P = F.
The connection between these two presentations is, then, the following: if < is an
ordering on F, then
P< := {a ∈F | 0 ≤a}
is a positive cone. (More precisely, P< consists of the nonnegative elements of F!)
Conversely, if P is a positive cone of F, then
a <P b
iff
b−a ∈P\{0}
deﬁnes an ordering on F.
In the following we shall always write (F,<) for an ordered ﬁeld. Here F is
a ﬁeld, and < is an ordering on F. The class of all ordered ﬁelds is obviously
closed under union of chains; i.e. it is inductive. Consequently, given an ordered
ﬁeld (F,<), if we consider all extensions (F′,<′) of it such that F′ is algebraic over
F, then we obtain, using Zorn’s lemma, the existence of a maximal ordered, alge-

4.2 Ordered Fields
137
braic extension (F∗,<∗) of (F,<). These extensions (F∗,<∗) are real closed, by the
following theorem:
Theorem 4.2.1. For an ordered ﬁeld (F,<), the following are equivalent:
(1) (F,<) admits no proper, algebraic, ordered extension ﬁeld.
(2) (F,<) is real closed.
(3) F
√−1
	
is algebraically closed and F ̸= F
√−1
	
.
Proof: See, e.g. [Prestel–Delzell, 2001, 1.2.10].
⊓⊔
For real closed ﬁelds, the ordering is deﬁnable (in the language of ﬁelds).
Namely,
a < b
iff
b−a ∈F2 \{0},
where F2 = {x2 | x ∈F }. This means that in this (the real closed) case, P< = F2.
From (3) it follows that for F real closed, an irreducible polynomial f ∈F[X]
must be of the form
f = X −a
or
f = (X −b)2 +c2,
with a,b,c ∈F and c ̸= 0. If we factor an arbitrary polynomial f ∈F[X] into such
factors, we see that the intermediate value property must hold for f over (F,<); i.e.
(R1) If a,b ∈F with a < b, and if f(a) < 0 < f(b), then there is a c ∈F with
a < c < b and f(c) = 0.
From the deﬁnition of a real closed ﬁeld we immediately see the correctness of:
(R2) The relative algebraic closure of a subﬁeld in a real closed ﬁeld is itself again
real closed.
As we had explained above, to every ordered ﬁeld (F,<), there is a real closed,
algebraic extension (F∗,<∗). Such an extension is called a real closure of (F,<).
Theorem 4.2.2. Any two real closures of an ordered ﬁeld (F,<) are isomorphic
over F.
⊓⊔
After these preparations, we are in a position to prove the main theorem of this
section.
Theorem 4.2.3. The theory of real closed ﬁelds admits quantiﬁer elimination, and
is complete and model complete.
Proof: Model completeness follows immediately from quantiﬁer elimination; and
completeness follows from Corollary 3.4.2, since Q with its unique ordering is a
prime substructure.
For the proof of quantiﬁer elimination, we again proceed as in Theorems 3.4.4
and 4.1.1. Let F1 = (F1,<1) and F2 = (F2,<2) be real closed ﬁelds, and A a com-
mon substructure. A is, then, an ordered subring of F1 and F2. The construction of
fractions of A in F1 and F2 leads to canonically isomorphic ordered ﬁelds – the ﬁeld

138
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
of fractions F of A. By (R2) and Theorem 4.2.2, the relative algebraic closures of F
in F1 and F2 are again real closed and isomorphic over F. We identify these closures,
and denote them by F. Then we have the following situation:

@
@
F
F1
F2
where all three structures are real closed (ordered) ﬁelds.
As in Theorem 4.1.1, we again consider a quantiﬁer-free formula δ of the lan-
guage L(A) with F1 |= ∃xδ, in which at most x occurs free. By passing to a dis-
junctive normal form and replacing negated atomic formulae as in the proof of
Theorem 4.1.1, we may assume, after distributing the existential quantiﬁers to the
disjuncts, that δ is of the form
 r
i=1
pi(x) .= 0 ∧
s
j=1
0 < q j(x)

,
where pi and qj are polynomials in x with coefﬁcients of the form a with a ∈A. Here
we have again carried out several ﬁeld-theoretically equivalent transformations; e.g.
we have gone from p′(x) .= p′′(x) to p′(x) −p′′(x) .= 0. The cases r = 0 and s = 0
are not excluded.
Now, if at least one equation pi(x) .= 0 is nontrivial, then an element d ∈F1 that
satisﬁes δ in F1 obviously must lie in F. We therefore have F |= ∃xδ, and hence
F2 |= ∃xδ. Now suppose all equations pi(x) .= 0 are trivial, or r = 0. Under the
assumption that there is an element d ∈F1 that satisﬁes all the inequalities 0 < qj(x)
in F1, we shall show that d can already be chosen from F. Then we shall have
F |= ∃xδ and hence F2 |= ∃xδ.
Let a1 < ··· < am be all the zeros in F of the polynomials q1,...,qs, ordered
according to the ordering on F. Since the coefﬁcients of these polynomials lie in A,
these are also exactly their zeros in F1 and F2, respectively. For d ∈F1 \A there are
then three possibilities for its location with respect to a1,...,am:
Case 1: d < a1. In this case, q j(d) and qj(a1 −1) have the same sign. Namely,
if they had different signs, then by (R1), some zero of q j would lie between d and
a1 −1. But this is impossible, since the aν are all the zeros in F1 of all the q j.
Case 2: am < d. Here the analogous argument works for d and am +1.
Case 3: aν < d < aν+1. Here qj(d) and q j
 aν+aν+1
2
	
obviously again have the
same sign.
In all three cases we therefore ﬁnd a d′ ∈F that satisﬁes all inequalities 0 < qj(x)
in F just as d does.
⊓⊔
Corollary 4.2.4. The theory of ordered ﬁelds has a model companion, namely, the
theory of real closed ﬁelds.
This follows immediately from the existence of the real closure of an ordered
ﬁeld and from Theorem 4.2.3.

4.2 Ordered Fields
139
Just as for algebraically closed ﬁelds, we obtain from quantiﬁer elimination for
real closed ﬁelds F that the set of quantiﬁer-free deﬁnable sets is closed under pro-
jection. In real algebraic geometry, such sets sets are called semi-algebraic. We
therefore have:
The projections of semi-algebraic sets in Fn are again semi-algebraic.
The completeness of the theory of real closed ﬁelds means exactly that every
sentence in the language of ordered ﬁelds that is true in R holds also in every other
real closed ﬁeld. This transfer principle, named after Tarski, ﬁnds many applications
in real algebraic geometry.
One application of model completeness is the following solution of Hilbert’s
17th problem. This problem was solved by E. Artin in 1926. His solution probably
inspired certain model theoretic concepts.
Theorem 4.2.5 (Artin’s solution to Hilbert’s 17th problem). Let F be a real closed
ﬁeld (e.g. R), and f ∈F[X1,...,Xn] a positive semideﬁnite polynomial, i.e.
f(a1,...,an) ≥0 for all a1,...,an ∈F. Then f is a sum of squares of rational func-
tions in x1,...,xn over F.
Proof: By a theorem of Artin and Schreier, in every ﬁeld of characteristic not 2, the
sums of squares are exactly those elements that are positive with respect to every or-
dering of the ﬁeld. If f were not a sum of squares in the ﬁeld F(X1,...,Xn) = F

X
	
of rational functions in X1,...,Xn, then by this theorem there would be an ordering
< of F

X
	
such that f < 0. To F

X
	
with this ordering there is, by our remark
before Theorem 4.2.1, a real closure, which we shall denote by F′. We denote the
unique ordering of F′ by <′. Then in F′, f <′ 0 still holds. Therefore, the existential
sentence
ϕ :
∃x1,...,xn f(x1,...,xn) < 0
holds in F′, where we have obtained f from f by replacing all coefﬁcients b by
constants b. F is a substructure of F′. By model completeness, we have F ⪯F′.
Therefore ϕ holds also in F. But this means that there are elements a1,...,an ∈F
with f(a1,...,an) < 0. This, however, contradicts our hypothesis on f. Therefore f
is a sum of squares in F

X
	
, after all.
⊓⊔
We have axiomatized the theory of real closed ﬁelds in a language with a symbol
< for the ordering. It is possible, however, to eliminate this symbol via the equiva-
lence
x < y
↔
∃z(y−x .= z2 ∧z ̸= 0),
(4.2.5.1)
which is valid in real closed ﬁelds. We can characterize those ﬁelds possessing an
ordering with respect to which they are real closed, as follows: we take the ﬁeld
axioms K1–K9 and RK2n for all n ≥1, as well as the axioms
RK3 :
∀x,y ∃z
x2 +y2 .= z2
RK5 :
∀x
−1 ̸= x2
RK7 :
∀x ∃y (x .= y2 ∨−x .= y2)

140
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
(which assert that the squares form a positive cone). For such ﬁelds we can always
deﬁne, via (4.2.5.1), an ordering satisfying RK1. Conversely, real closed ﬁelds al-
ways satisfy these axioms; i.e. the class of ﬁelds axiomatized above consists exactly
of the restrictions of real closed ﬁelds to the ﬁeld language.
Theorem 4.2.6. The axiom system
Σ = {K1,...,K9}∪{RK1,RK3,RK5,RK7}∪{RK2n | n ≥1}
is model complete and complete, but does not admit quantiﬁer elimination.
Proof: Let F1 and F2 be models of Σ with F1 ⊆F2. Then, after the addition of
the order symbol via (4.2.5.1),

F1,<F1	
⊆

F2,<F2	
also holds, because a positive
element of F1 is a square in F1, and hence remains positive also in F2. From the
linearity of <F1, however, it follows that for a,b ∈F1:
a <F1 b
iff
a <F2 b.
The structures

Fν,<Fν	
(ν = 1,2) are models of the theory of real closed ﬁelds. By
the model completeness of this theory it follows that

F1,<F1	
⪯

F2,<F2	
,
which trivially implies F1 ⪯F2. By Lemma 3.3.1, Σ is therefore model complete.
The completeness of Σ follows similarly from the completeness of the theory of
real closed ﬁelds.
Finally, we show that Σ does not admit quantiﬁer elimination. For this, we con-
sider the ﬁeld Q
√
2
	
. This ﬁeld possesses two orderings, <1 and <2, induced by
the two embeddings of Q[X]/(X2 −2) into R. With respect to one ordering,
√
2
is positive – say, 0 <1
√
2, while with respect to the other,
√
2 is negative – say,
√
2 <2 0.
Let F′
1 and F′
2 be the real closures of

Q
√
2
	
,<1
	
and

Q
√
2
	
,<2
	
, respec-
tively. Then F′
1 and F′
2 are ordered ﬁelds, and their restrictions F1 and F2 to the ﬁeld
language are models of Σ. They contain Q
√
2
	
as a common substructure (in the
ﬁeld language!). However, we have
F1 |= ∃x x2 .=
√
2
and
F2 |= ∃x x2 .= −
√
2.
This shows, say by Theorem 3.4.1(3), that Σ does not admit quantiﬁer elimination.

4.3 Valued Fields: Examples and Properties
The model theory of algebraic structures presented so far goes back basically to
theorems and developments from the 1920s, even if the presentation has changed

4.3 Valued Fields: Examples and Properties

somewhat (especially due to the development of saturated structures in the 1950s).
The model theory of valued ﬁelds, however, is a development of the 1970s. It began
essentially with the sensational theorems of Ax-Kochen and Ershov in the middle
of the 1960s. We shall treat these theorems in Section 4.6. Before that, however, we
shall present two special cases, in Sections 4.4 and 4.5. The case of an algebraically
closed valued ﬁeld, handled already by A. Robinson, can thus be seen as a fore-
runner of all the other theorems. Since the general theory of valued ﬁelds and, in
particular, Henselian ﬁelds, does not belong to the standard repertoire of an algebra
course, we would like to give a short introduction in this section, even without being
able to carry out proofs in full. For full proofs, we refer the interested reader to the
appropriate literature.
A valuation of a ﬁeld F is a surjective mapping
v : F →Γ ∪{∞}
of F into an ordered Abelian group Γ (the value group) together with the symbol ∞,
with the following properties:
(i) v(a) = ∞
iff
a = 0
(ii) v(ab) = v(a)+v(b)
(iii) v(a+b) ≥min{v(a),v(b)},
for all a,b ∈F. Here the symbol ∞is greater than all elements of Γ , and satisﬁes
the following computational rules:
∞+∞= γ +∞= ∞+γ = ∞
for
γ ∈Γ .
The valuation with v(a) = 0 for all a ̸= 0 will be called the trivial valuation of
F. Whenever we do not expressly emphasize that the trivial valuation should be
considered, the word “valuation” will mean a nontrivial valuation.
Several properties of valuations are:
(iv) v(1) = v(−1) = 0
(v) v(−a) = v(a), v(a−1) = −v(a)
(vi) v(a) < v(b) implies v(a+b) = v(a).
These are derived as follows:

142
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
(iv) v(1) = v(1·1) = v(1)+v(1), whence v(1) = 0.
0 = v(1) = v((−1)·(−1)) = v(−1)+v(−1), whence v(−1) = 0.
(v) v(−a) = v((−1)·a) = v(−1)+v(a) = v(a).
0 = v(1) = v(a·a−1) = v(a)+v(a−1), whence v(a−1) = −v(a).
(vi) If v(a) < v(a+b), then we would have
v(a) < min{v(−b),v(a+b)} ≤v(−b+a+b) = v(a).
The most important examples of valuations are the following two:
1. p-adic valuation
Let p be a prime number. A given rational number r ̸= 0 can be decomposed
uniquely (up to sign), as follows:
r = pm · n1
n2
with
n1,n2,m ∈Z, n2 ̸= 0,
where n1 and n2 are not divisible by p. The p-adic value of r is then deﬁned as
vp(r) = m. Setting v(0) = ∞, we obtain
vp : Q →Z∪{∞}.
One may easily check that vp is a valuation. If the nonzero rational number r is
written (uniquely) as
r = ampm +am+1pm+1 +···+al pl
with m,l ∈Z, aν ∈{0,1,..., p−1} for m ≤ν ≤l, and am ̸= 0, then vp(r) = m. This
follows from (vi) and the observation
v(1) = ··· = v(p−1) = 0.
The p-adic valuation deﬁnes a metric on Q if one sets
|x−y|p = e−vp(x−y).
Just as Q with respect to the metric |x−y| given by the usual absolute value can be
completed to the real numbers, so Q with respect to |x−y|p can be completed to the
so-called p-adic number ﬁeld Qp. The elements of Qp are then precisely the inﬁnite
series of the form
∞
∑
ν=m
aν pν,
with m ∈Z and aν ∈{0,1,..., p −1}. Such a series is nothing more than the limit
of its subseries

4.3 Valued Fields: Examples and Properties
143
l
∑
ν=m
aν pν
as l →∞in the p-adic metric. If we set
vp
 ∞
∑
ν=m
aν pν

= m
in case am ̸= 0,
then we obtain a canonical extension of vp to Qp (which we continue to denote by
vp). Then
vp : Qp →Z∪{∞}
is a valuation of Qp. The set
Zp = {x ∈Qp | vp(x) ≥0}
forms a subring of Qp, the ring of p-adic integers. They can be represented by series
x =
∞
∑
ν=0
aν pν,
where a0 need not necessarily be ̸= 0. The set of p-adic integers x with a0 = 0, i.e.
with vp(x) > 0, consists precisely of the ideal pZp, and we have
Zp/pZp ∼= Z/pZ.
2. Polynomial valuation
Let k be an arbitrary ﬁeld, k[X] the ring of polynomials in X, and k(X) the ﬁeld
of rational functions in X. Then if p ∈k[X] is an irreducible (monic) polynomial,
then a valuation vp can be deﬁned analogously to the p-adic case (where p now
stands for an irreducible polynomial). Namely, each nonzero element r of k(X) can
be decomposed uniquely (up to constant factors), as follows:
r = pm · f
g
with
m ∈Z
and
f,g ∈k[X], g ̸= 0,
where f and g are not divisible by p in k[X]. Then if we set vp(r) = m and vp(0) = ∞,
this deﬁnes a valuation
vp : k(X) →Z∪{∞}.
Trivially, vp(a) = 0 for all a ∈k×.
In the special case where p = X −a with a ∈k, if the nonzero rational function
r ∈k(X) is written (uniquely) in the form
r = ampm +am+1pm+1 +···+al pl
with m,l ∈Z, ai ∈k, and am ̸= 0, then vp(r) = m.

144
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
As in the p-adic case, k(X) can be completed with respect to vp. In the case
p = X −a, the elements of this completion are the limit values of series of the form
l
∑
ν=m
aν(X −a)ν
with
aν ∈k
as l →∞. We also write
∞
∑
ν=m
aν(X −a)ν
for these limit values, and call them formal Laurent series. With the usual computa-
tional rules for Laurent series, they form a ﬁeld k((X −a)), the completion of k(X)
with respect to vX−a. Observe that for different a ∈k, these ﬁelds are isomorphic.
The valuation vX−a can be canonically extended to k((X −a)), by deﬁning
vX−a
 ∞
∑
ν=m
aν(X −a)ν

= m
in case
am ̸= 0.
The formal power series in X −a, i.e. the series of the form
f =
∞
∑
ν=0
aν(X −a)ν,
form a subring k[[X −a]] of k((X −a)). The set of power series f with a0 = 0 is the
ideal (X −a)k((X −a)), and
k[[X −a]] / (X −a)k[[X −a]] ∼= k.
The valuations vp just described are all trivial on k; i.e. vp(a) = 0 for a ∈k×. Con-
versely, one can easily show that a valuation
v : k(X) →Z∪{∞}
that is trivial on k belongs to an irreducible polynomial p ∈k[X] or to the so-called
degree valuation v∞. For a quotient f/g with f,g ∈k[X] and g ̸= 0, this valuation is
deﬁned via
v∞

 f
g

= degg−deg f.
If we again set v∞(0) = ∞, then
v∞: k(X) →Z∪{∞}
is a valuation that is trivial on k.
After these examples, we would like to study valuations in general. Let
v : F →Z∪{∞}

4.3 Valued Fields: Examples and Properties
145
be a valuation of the ﬁeld F. Then the set
Ov = {x ∈F | v(x) ≥0}
obviously forms a subring of F with the property:
x /∈Ov implies x−1 ∈Ov,
for all x ∈F.
Subrings of F with this property are called valuation rings. Ov is called the val-
uation ring of v. The valuation v is obviously trivial on F if and only if Ov = F.
Furthermore, we immediately see that the set
Mv = {x ∈F | v(x) > 0}
forms an ideal of Ov. More precisely, Mv is the ideal of nonunits in Ov, since the
units of Ov are obviously those x ∈Ov with v(x) = 0. It is thus clear that Mv is a
maximal ideal of Ov, and, indeed, the only such. We call the ﬁeld
Kv := Ov/Mv
the residue ﬁeld of v. For the p-adic valuation vp, the residue ﬁeld is isomorphic to
Fp = Z/pZ,
both for Q and for Qp. In the polynomial case, for an irreducible p ∈k[X], the
residue ﬁeld is isomorphic to
k[X]/pk[X],
which is a ﬁnite extension of k of degree deg p. The degree valuation v∞has residue
ﬁeld isomorphic to k.
Now let O be an arbitrary valuation ring of F. We do not consider the trivial case
O = F. We shall now associate with O a (non-trivial) valuation, whose valuation
ring is exactly O. Let O× be the group of units of O. For elements a,b ∈F×, we
deﬁne an ordering of the cosets of O× in F× by
aO× < bO×
iff
ba−1 ∈O \O×.
We write the multiplication of cosets additively:
aO× +bO× = abO×.
Since ab−1 ∈O or ba−1 ∈O, it therefore follows that aO× > bO× or aO× < bO×.
The transitivity of the ordering follows from the that fact that O \O× is multiplica-
tively closed; the monotonicity is clear. Then for a ∈F× we set
vO(a) = aO×

146
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
and vO(0) = ∞. This deﬁnes a valuation of F: Since (i) and (ii) are trivial, it remains
to show (iii). Let vO(a) ≤vO(b), i.e. ba−1 ∈O. From this follows (a + b)a−1 =
1+ba−1 ∈O. Then
vO(a) ≤vO(a+b).
We further have
OvO = {a ∈F | vO(a) ≥1} = O
(where 1 denotes the coset 1O× = O× ∈F×/O×), and we see that O \O× = {a ∈
F | v(a) > 1} is the unique maximal ideal of O.
If v is given, and to Ov we form the valuation w = vOv as we just did, then nat-
urally we cannot deduce that Γ and F×/O×
v are identical. However, the following
holds. The inverse image of 0 ∈Γ under v is the group O×
v of units. We further have
v(a) < v(b)
iff
ba−1 ∈Ov \O×
v .
We thereby obtain an order-preserving isomorphism σ : F×/O×
v →Γ induced by
a →v(a). We have
v = σ ◦w.
Two valuations v and w that are related by such an isomorphism are called equiva-
lent. We have thereby obtained a bijective correspondence between valuation rings
and equivalence classes of valuations.
Now we wish to study extensions of valuations to extension ﬁelds. For this it is
always better (especially when we look ahead to axiomatizability, later) to work with
valuation rings. So let O1 be a valuation ring of F1. If F2 is an extension ﬁeld of F1,
and O2 is a valuation ring of F2, then we call O2 an extension of O1 if O1 = F ∩O2,
i.e. if (F1,O1) is a substructure, in the sense of model theory, of (F2,O2), in which
case we write (F1,O1) ⊆(F2,O2), as usual. If Mi is the maximal ideal of Oi, and
Ui = Oi \ Mi the group of units of Oi, for i = 1,2, then, using O1 = F1 ∩O2, it
follows that
M1 = F1 ∩M2
and
U1 = F1 ∩U2.
Here we use the equivalence
a /∈Oi
iff
a−1 ∈Mi
for a ∈F×
i . We therefore obtain canonical injections of the residue class ﬁelds
F1 := O1/M1 →O2/M2 =: F2
and of the value groups
Γ1 := F×
1 /U1 →F×
2 /U2 =: Γ2.
If we identify each with its image, then F1 is a subﬁeld of F2, and Γ1 is a subgroup
of Γ2 (with the inherited order). We call the degree

4.3 Valued Fields: Examples and Properties
147
f =

F2 : F1

of the ﬁeld extension the residue degree, and the index
e = [Γ2 : Γ1]
the ramiﬁcation index of (F2,O2) over (F1,O1). If e = f = 1, we call it an immediate
extension.
In general, a valuation ring O1 of F1 has many extensions to an extension ﬁeld F2.
The valued ﬁeld (F1,O1) is called Henselian if to every algebraic extension ﬁeld F2
of F1, O1 has exactly one extension to F2. Therefore every valuation ring on every
algebraically closed ﬁeld F is, trivially, Henselian.
Now we collect, in a series of theorems (mostly without proof), the most essential
properties of valued and, in particular, Henselian, ﬁelds, which we shall need in the
next three sections.
Theorem 4.3.1. Let (F,O) be a ﬁeld with a valuation ring, and F1 an extension ﬁeld
of F. Then:
(1) (Chevalley Extension Theorem) There always exists an extension O1 of O to F1.
(2) If F1 has degree n over F, then for every extension O1 of O to F1, the “funda-
mental inequality” e· f ≤n holds.
Proof: See [Engler–Prestel, 2005, (3.1.1) and (3.2.3)].
⊓⊔
If (F,O) is a valued ﬁeld and a ∈O, then we write a for the residue class a+M
of a with respect to the maximal ideal M of O. We usually denote the residue class
ﬁeld O/M brieﬂy by F. If f ∈O[X] is a polynomial with coefﬁcients in O – say,
f = anXn +···+a0
with
ai ∈O
– then
f : = anXn +···+a0
is a polynomial over F.
Theorem 4.3.2. For a valued ﬁeld (F,O), the following are equivalent:
(1) (F,O) is Henselian.
(2) If f,g,h ∈O[X] are monic polynomials with f = g · h, and if g and h are rel-
atively prime in F[X], then there are monic polynomials g1,h1 ∈O[X] with
f = g1 ·h1 and g = g1, h = h1.
(3) If f ∈O[X] is monic, and if a ∈O is a simple zero of f (i.e. f(a) = 0 and
f ′(a) ̸= 0), then there is a1 ∈O with f(a1) = 0 and a1 = a.
Proof: See [Engler–Prestel, 2005, 4.1.3].
⊓⊔
Theorem 4.3.3. For each valued ﬁeld (F,O), there is a Henselian extension (F1,O1)
that embeds, uniquely over (F,O), in every other Henselian extension (F2,O2) of
(F,O).

148
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
Proof: See [Engler–Prestel, 2005, 5.2.2].
⊓⊔
Here, the phrase “embeds uniquely over (F,O)” means, as usual, that there is
a uniquely determined monomorphism σ : (F1,O1) →(F2,O2) with σ|F = id. The
(up to isomorphism uniquely determined) Henselian extension (F1,O1) given by
Theorem 4.3.3 is called the Henselization of (F,O). One can prove – say, with
the help of condition (2) of Theorem 4.3.2 – that the relative algebraic separable
closure F′ of a ﬁeld F in an extension ﬁeld F1 with respect to a valuation O′ =
F′ ∩O1 is Henselian, in case (F1,O1) is a Henselian ﬁeld. From this we see that the
Henselization of a valued ﬁeld is always a separable extension. Moreover, we have:
Theorem 4.3.4. The Henselization (F1,O1) of a valued ﬁeld (F,O) is a separable
and immediate extension of (F,O).
⊓⊔
We shall call a nontrivial valued ﬁeld (F,O) ﬁnitely ramiﬁed if either charF = 0
or only ﬁnitely many values in the value group Γ lie between 0 and v

charF
	
. From
the second case it follows, as one may easily check, that for every natural number
n ≥1, only ﬁnitely many values in Γ lie between 0 and v(n). In both cases, charF
is necessarily 0.
Theorem 4.3.5. Let (F,O) be a ﬁnitely ramiﬁed valued ﬁeld. Then the Henselization
of (F,O) is a maximal immediate algebraic extension.
Proof: By Theorem 4.3.4, the Henselization (F1,O1) of (F,O) is an immediate
extension. Assume (F2,O2) is a proper, immediate, algebraic extension of (F1,O1).
Let, say, F2 = F1(α), g = Irr(α,F1), and F3 be the splitting ﬁeld of g over F1. Then
F3/F1 is a Galois extension, whose Galois group G has, say, n > 1 elements. The
sum
a = 1
n ∑
σ∈G
σ(α)
lies in F1. We shall show the existence of a b ∈F1 with
v(α −a)+v(n) < v(α −b).
(4.3.5.1)
Since (F2,O2) is an immediate extension of (F1,O1), there is, ﬁrst, a c ∈F×
1 with
v(α −a) = v(c). Then (α −a)c−1 is a unit in O2, whence there is, secondly, a d ∈O1
with (α −a)c−1 = d. If we write b1 = a+cd, it follows that
v(α −a) = v(c) < v

c·

α −a

= v(α −b1).
Since only ﬁnitely many values lie between v(α −a) and v(α −a)+v(n), we can,
after ﬁnitely many applications of this process, ﬁnd a b ∈F1 satisfying (4.3.5.1).
Since all automorphisms of F3 over F1 must carry the unique extension O3 of O1
(or of O2), into itself (just because of its uniqueness), it follows that
v(σ(α)−b) = v(α −b)

4.4 Algebraically Closed Valued Fields

for all σ ∈G. We therefore obtain
v(α −a)+v(n) < v(α −b) ≤v

∑
σ∈G
(σ(α)−b)

.
Since ∑σ∈G(σ(α)−b) = n(a−b), it thus follows that
v(α −a) < v(a−b).
But this and (4.3.5.1) yield
v(α −a) < min{v(a−b), v(α −b)} ≤v((α −b)−(a−b)),
a contradiction.
Thus, (F1,O1) is a maximal immediate algebraic extension of (F,O).
⊓⊔
4.4 Algebraically Closed Valued Fields
Now we would like to study the model theory of algebraic and real closed ﬁelds
with valuation rings. Here we do not yet use the theorems on Henselian ﬁelds.
For the ﬁrst case we use the language of ﬁelds, in the second case the language
of ordered ﬁelds (as introduced in Section 1.6), which, however, we extend in both
cases by a 1-place relation symbol V. The following axioms express that the inter-
pretation of V is a valuation ring (in a ﬁeld):
V1 :
V(0)∧V(1)
V2 :
∀x,y (V(x)∧V(y) →V(x−y)∧V(x·y))
V3 :
∀x,y (x·y = 1 →V(x)∨V(y)).
We write a model of the ﬁeld axioms K1–K9 and V1–V3 brieﬂy as (F,O), where
F is a ﬁeld and O is the interpretation of V, hence a valuation ring of F. First we
consider the case where K is algebraically closed, so that the axioms AKn for n ≥1
are also fulﬁlled.
In order to get results on quantiﬁer elimination, it is necessary to formulate the
concept of valuation so that it reappears in substructures, in a certain sense. But
substructures of ﬁelds are integral domains. We therefore make the following mod-
iﬁcation: let F be a ﬁeld and O a valuation ring of F. For a,b ∈F we deﬁne a
divisibility relation by
a | b
iff
ac = b for some c ∈O.
We see immediately that O consists exactly of those a ∈F that are divisible by 1.
For a,b ∈F we also have:

150
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
a | b
iff
vO(a) ≤vO(b).
Soon we shall express the following properties of divisibility in the form of axioms.
Here the symbol | is a binary relation symbol, which extends the language of ﬁelds.
D1 :
(1 | 0 ∧0 ̸ | 1)
D2 :
∀x
x | x
D3 :
∀x,y,z (x | y ∧y | z →x | z)
D4 :
∀x,y
(x | y ∨y | x)
D5 :
∀x,y,z (x | y →xz | yz)
D6 :
∀x,y,z (z | x ∧z | y →z | x+y)
Now if F is a ﬁeld with a binary relation (which we continue to denote by |) that
satisﬁes D1–D6, then
O := {a ∈F | 1 | a}
deﬁnes a valuation ring. One sees this easily. (We get −1 ∈O from 1 | −1 ∨−1 | 1,
using D5.) In the same way we see that we have thereby produced, in any ﬁeld, a one-
to-one correspondence between valuation rings and divisibility relations satisfying
D1–D6. We therefore call such a divisibility relation a valuation divisibility. The
advantage of valuation divisibility lies in the following
Lemma 4.4.1. Let R be an integral domain with a divisibility relation | satisfying
D1–D6. Then there is a unique extension of | to the quotient ﬁeld F of R that con-
tinues to satisfy D1–D6.
Proof: For a,b,c,d ∈R with b,d ̸= 0, we deﬁne
a
b
 c
d
iff
ad | bc.
(4.4.1.1)
It is easy to convince oneself that this relation on F is well-deﬁned, extends the
given | on R, and satisﬁes the axioms D1–D6. On the other hand, every extension
satisfying D1–D6 also satisﬁes (4.4.1.1), and so is uniquely determined by the divis-
ibility relation | on R.
⊓⊔
A valuation divisibility | corresponds to the trivial valuation ring of a ﬁeld F if
and only if 1 divides every element of F.
Theorem 4.4.2. The theory of algebraically closed ﬁelds with nontrivial valuation
divisibility admits quantiﬁer elimination.
Proof: We use criterion (3) of Theorem 3.4.1. Accordingly, let (F1, |1 ) and (F2, |2 )
be algebraically closed ﬁelds with nontrivial valuation divisibilities, and let (F, | )
be a common substructure. Using Lemma 4.4.1, we may assume that F is already
a ﬁeld. If we take the algebraic closures of F in F1 and in F2, these are naturally
isomorphic, as ﬁelds, over F. There is also, however, an isomorphism that carries

4.4 Algebraically Closed Valued Fields
151
the valuation ring induced by |1 over to that induced by |2 . This follows from the
fact that two valuation rings O1 and O2 of the algebraic closure F of a ﬁeld F that
both extend the valuation ring O of F can always be mapped to each other by an
automorphism of F over F. (Cf. [Engler–Prestel, 2005, 3.2.15].) We may therefore
assume, ﬁnally, that F itself is algebraically closed.
We must now show that an arbitrary, simple existence sentence ϕ of the language
L(F, | ) that holds in (F1, |1 ), also holds in (F2, |2 ). The sentence ϕ obviously holds
already in a simple, pure transcendental extension F′ = F(t) of F. We shall show
that, with respect to the valuation ring O′ in F′ induced by |1 , F′ embeds in F2
over F. Then ϕ will hold also in (F2, |2 ). In this proof we shall also assume that
(F2, |2 ) is κ+-saturated, where κ = card(F). This is no restriction, since we can at
any time pass to a corresponding saturated elementary extension of (F2, |2 ), using
Theorem 2.5.2.
Let O2 be the valuation ring of F2 induced by |2 . We seek a monomorphism
σ : (F′,O′) →(F2,O2)
with σ|F = id. We shall distinguish three cases. Here, F,F′,F2 will always denote
the residue ﬁelds of (F,O), (F′,O′) and (F2,O2), respectively, and Γ ,Γ ′,Γ2 the
corresponding value groups.
Case 1: F′ ̸= F. Let, say, x ∈F′ \ F. Then x is transcendental over F, since F is
algebraically closed. This is proved as follows: if x were algebraic over F, and if,
say, g with
g = Xm +am−1Xm−1 +···+a0 ∈O[X]
were the minimal polynomial of x over F, then every factorization of g would carry
over to g. Since F is algebraically closed, g would have to be linear.
Now we consider an inverse image x of x. By Theorem 4.3.1(2), x is also tran-
scendental over F. We further choose an x2 ∈F2 such that x2 is transcendental over
F. This is possible, since (F2, |2 ) is κ+-saturated. Namely, this results from the fact
that the type
Φ(v0) = {(1 | v0 ∧v0 | 1)} ∪{(1 | (v0 −a) ∧(v0 −a) | 1) | a ∈O× }
is realizable in (F2, |2 ). (Observe that, due to the inﬁnitude of F, the set Φ(v0) is
ﬁnitely satisﬁable in (F2, |2 ).) A realization x2 of this type is, however, just a unit
in O2, for which x2 −a ̸= 0 for all a ∈O× holds. As before, x2 is then transcen-
dental over F. Therefore, the mapping a →a for a ∈F and x →x2 deﬁnes a ﬁeld
isomorphism σ of F(x) onto F(x2). This even respects the valuation, since, for the
valuation v′ induced by O′ and for a0,...,am ∈F, we have:
v′(amxm +···+a0) = min
0≤i≤mv(ai).
(4.4.2.1)
Namely, if not all ai are 0, and if, say, v(aj) is minimal, then (4.4.2.1) follows from
the equation

and the fact that ∑m
i=0 aia−1
j xi ̸= 0. Here we use the facts that x is transcendental over
F and that all coefﬁcients aia−1
j
lie in O. Since the same argument works for the
valuation induced on F(x2) by O2, we therefore obtain, ﬁnally, for a0,...,am ∈F:
v′(amxm +···+a0) = v2(amxm +···+a0).
We therefore have an isomorphism σ from the subﬁeld F(x) of F′ onto a subﬁeld F′′
of F2. Since F′ is algebraic over F(x), and F2 is algebraically closed, σ can naturally
be extended to F′. Here we recall the fact, mentioned above, that two extensions of
a valuation ring of the ﬁeld F′′ to its algebraic closure 
F′′ can always be carried to
each other by an automorphism of 
F′′ over F′′.
Case 2: Γ ′ ̸= Γ . Let, say, v′(x) ∈Γ ′ \Γ , for x ∈F′. The group Γ is divisible. This
results as follows: a typical element of Γ is v(a), for a ∈F. For n ≥2, there is, then,
a b ∈F with a = bn. It therefore follows that v(a) = nv(b), i.e. v(a) is divisible by
n in Γ . Using Theorem 4.3.1(2), it follows again that x must be transcendental over
F.
Now we choose an x2 ∈F2 such that v2(x2) occupies the same location with
respect to Γ as v′(x). Such an x2 exists, again because of the κ+-saturation of (F2, |2 )
and the divisibility of Γ . Namely, this results from the fact that the type
{¬v0 | a | v(a) < v′(x), a ∈F } ∪{¬a | v0 | v′(x) < v(a), a ∈F }
is realizable in (F2, |2 ). (In the case that O is trivial, we use the hypothesis that O2 is
nontrivial.) In particular, x2 is again transcendental over F. Therefore, the mapping
a →a for a ∈F and x →x2 deﬁnes a ﬁeld isomorphism of F(x) with F(x2). This
again respects the corresponding valuations. Namely, for a0,...,am ∈F we have
v′(amxm +···+a0) = min
0≤i≤m(v(ai)+iv′(x)).
(4.4.2.2)
This follows as in Case 1: indeed, if not all ai are 0, and if v′(aixi) = v′(a jx j) for
some i < j, then we would have
(j −i)v′(x) = v(aia−1
j ) ∈Γ .
For x2 we obtain, analogously,
v2(amxm +···+a0) = min
0≤i≤m(v(ai)+iv2(x)).
Because of the divisibility of Γ and the equal location with respect to Γ occupied
by x and x2, the mapping γ →γ for γ ∈Γ and v′(x) →v2(x) deﬁnes an order-
isomorphism of the value groups Γ ⊕Zv′(x) of F(x) and Γ ⊕Zv2(x2) of F(x2).

4.4 Algebraically Closed Valued Fields
153
This shows that σ carries the valuation induced by O′ on F(x) to the valuation
induced by O2 on F(x2). As in Case 1, σ can be extended from F(x) to F′.
Case 3: F′ = F and Γ ′ = Γ . We shall prove the existence of a t2 ∈F2 with
v′(t −a) = v2(t2 −a)
for all a ∈F.
(4.4.2.3)
Obviously t2 will then be transcendental over F (since v′(t −a) ̸= ∞for a ∈F).
Therefore the mapping a →a for a ∈F and t →t2 deﬁnes a monomorphism of
F(t) into F2, which respects the valuations, by (4.4.2.3) (and the fact that every
polynomial in t over F decomposes into F-linear factors).
In order to prove the existence of a t2 ∈F2 satisfying (4.4.2.3), we shall again
apply the κ+-saturation of (F2, |2 ). We shall show that the following set of formulae
is a type of (F2, |2 ), i.e. is ﬁnitely satisﬁable in (F2, |2 ):
Φ(v0) = {(v0 −a | ba ∧ba | v0 −a) | a ∈F }.
(4.4.2.4)
Here ba ∈F is chosen so that
v(ba) = v′(t −a),
(4.4.2.5)
using Γ ′ = Γ . If this type is realized by a t2 ∈F2, then obviously
v2(t2 −a) = v(ba) = v′(t −a)
for all a ∈F,
(4.4.2.6)
proving (4.4.2.3).
So let a ﬁnite subset of Φ(v0) be given, i.e. let a1,...,an ∈F and ba1,...,ban
satisfying (4.4.2.5) be given. We seek an element d ∈F2 with
v2(d −a1) = v(ba1), ..., v2(d −an) = v(ban).
For this, let v(ba) be the maximum of the v(bai) for 1 ≤i ≤n. Since v′(t −a) =
v(ba), (t −a)b−1
a
is (a unit) in O′. Using F′ = F, there is, therefore, a c ∈F with
c = (t −a)b−1
a , i.e.
v′
t −(a+cba)
ba

= v′
t −a
ba
−c

> 0.
If we set d = a+cba, it therefore follows that
v′(t −d) > v(ba) ≥v(bai) = v′(t −ai)
for 1 ≤i ≤n. In particular, we then have
v(d −ai) = v′((t −ai)−(t −d)) = v′(t −ai) = v(bai).
Case 3 is hence also brought to a close.
⊓⊔

4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
For the theory of nontrivial valued, algebraically closed ﬁelds – axiomatized via
K1–K9, AKn for n ≥1, V1–V3, and ∃x¬V(x) – we obtain from Theorem 4.4.2 the
following
Corollary 4.4.3. The theory of nontrivial valued, algebraically closed ﬁelds is
model complete; it is the model companion of the theory of valued ﬁelds.
Proof: Since the model completeness is implied trivially by the quantiﬁer elimina-
tion, it sufﬁces, by Theorem 4.4.2, to translate a formula from the language with the
unary relation symbol V into a formula with the binary relation |. But this is trivial:
we replace V(t) by 1 | t for each term t.
It remains to show that every valued ﬁeld embeds in an algebraically closed ﬁeld
with a nontrivial valuation. But this follows immediately from Theorem 4.3.1(1),
when one bears in mind that the trivial valuation on F can always be extended to a
nontrivial valuation on the rational function ﬁeld F(t).
⊓⊔
To obtain theorems on completeness, one must ﬁx the characteristic of the ﬁeld
and of the residue ﬁeld. If (F,O) is a valued ﬁeld with residue ﬁeld F, and if
charF = 0, then obviously also charF = 0. For charF = p > 0, both charF = p
and charF = 0 are possible. If F has characteristic p, this can be axiomatized by
¬∃x(px .= 1 ∧V(x))
respectively
¬p | 1.
If charF = 0, then this is axiomatized by the set
{∃x(px .= 1 ∧V(x)) | p prime}
respectively
{ p | 1 | p prime}.
We thus obtain
Corollary 4.4.4. The theory of nontrivial valued, algebraically closed ﬁelds with
ﬁxed characteristic and ﬁxed characteristic of the residue ﬁeld is complete.
Proof: As in the proof of the previous corollary, we show this in the language
with |. By Corollary 3.4.2, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a prime substructure. For the case
charF = charF = 0, this is Q with the the trivial valuation divisibility. For the case
charF = charF = p, this is the ﬁeld Fp with p elements and with the trivial valuation
divisibility. For the case charF = 0 and charF = p, ﬁnally, this is the ﬁeld Q with
the divisibility belonging to the p-adic valuation vp. The p-adic valuation is, namely,
the only valuation of Q whose residue ﬁeld has characteristic p.
⊓⊔
4.5 Real Closed Valued Fields
Now we come to the case of a real closed ﬁeld (F,<), where we wish to emphasize
the ordering, as in Section 4.2. Here we recall the axioms K1–K9, RK1, and RK2n
for n ≥1 from Section 1.6.

4.5 Real Closed Valued Fields
155
In an ordered ﬁeld (F,<) we consider a valuation ring O that is convex with
respect to <; i.e. for a,b ∈F, we should have that
0 ≤a ≤b ∈O
implies
a ∈O.
The reader can easily see that this is equivalent to the statement: “for all a,b ∈F,
0 ≤a ≤b
implies
vO(b) ≤vO(a)”.
We then call a valuation divisibility compatible with < if, for all a,b ∈F, we have
0 ≤a ≤b
implies
b | a.
Then obviously the valuation divisibilities compatible with < correspond to valua-
tion rings convex with respect to <.
Examples of convex valuation rings are easy to obtain: let, say, R be a subring
with 1 of the ordered ﬁeld (F,<). Then the convex hull of R,
O = {a ∈F | |a| ≤b for some b ∈R},
is a convex valuation ring. Indeed, if a ∈F (with 0 < a) is not in O, then 1 < a.
Using 0 < a−1 < 1, it then follows, however, that a−1 ∈O.
If O is a convex valuation ring of the ordered ﬁeld (F,<), then < induces a
canonical ordering of the residue ﬁeld F (which we shall continue to denote by <),
as follows: for a,b ∈O with a ̸= b, we declare:
a < b
iff
a < b.
We merely have to show that this deﬁnition is independent of the choice of rep-
resentatives of the residue classes a and b. For this, let, say, m1,m2 ∈M and
b+m2 ≤a+m1. But then from a < b,
0 < b−a ≤m1 −m2 ∈M
would follow. But since in a convex valuation ring the maximal ideal M is also
convex (a fact of which readers can easily convince themselves), it follows that
b−a ∈M, i.e. a = b.
A convex valuation ring O in an ordered ﬁeld (F,<) extends uniquely (as a con-
vex valuation ring) to the real closure (F1,<1) of (F,<). Indeed, if we form the
convex hull O1 of O in (F1,<1), then this is, on the one hand, an extension. If, on
the other hand, O′
1 is a convex extension of O on (F1,<1) that is different from O1,
then O1 ⊊O′
1 must hold. But this is impossible for algebraic extensions. Indeed, if
O1 ⊊O′
1, then this would have to hold already in some ﬁnite extension F1 of F. If
we write M1 and M′
1 for the maximal ideals of O1 and O′
1, respectively, then from
O1 ⊆O′
1 we immediately get M′
1 ⊆M1. Using M′
1 ∩O = M, it then follows (with
the usual identiﬁcations) that

156
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
O/M ⊆O1/M′
1 ⊆O′
1/M′
1.
Since the residue degree is ﬁnite by Theorem 4.3.1(2), it follows that O1/M′
1 must
be a ﬁeld. Therefore M′
1 is maximal. Consequently, M′
1 = M1 and thus O′
1 = O1.
After these preparations, we can prove the following theorem:
Theorem 4.5.1. The theory of real closed ﬁelds with a compatible, nontrivial valu-
ation divisibility admits quantiﬁer elimination.
Proof: We essentially follow the proof of Theorem 4.4.2. Accordingly, let (F1,
<1,|1 ) and (F2,<2, |2 ) be real closed ﬁelds with compatible valuation divisibili-
ties, and let (F,<, | ) be a common substructure. By Lemma 4.4.1 and the unique
extendability to the real closure of the valuation determined by |, we can identify
the real closure of F in F1 with that in F2. We can also assume that F itself is real
closed. Then, as in the proof of Theorem 4.4.2, we have to show that an arbitrary,
pure transcendental subextension F′ = F(t) of F in F1 embeds in F2 with respect to
the valuation in F2 over F, where we may assume that (F2,<2, |2 ) is κ+-saturated
for κ = card(F). Again we distinguish three cases (with the notations of (4.4.2)).
Case 1: F′ ̸= F. Let x ∈F′ \ F with 0 < x. Since every F-polynomial of odd
degree, and every polynomial X2 −a with a > 0 in F, has a zero in F, this holds
also for F. Since, in addition, F′ is ordered, F must therefore be algebraically closed
in F′. Therefore x is transcendental over F, and so x is also transcendental over F.
As in the proof of (4.4.2), we now seek x2 ∈F2 such that, on the one hand, x2
is transcendental over F – whence, as in (4.4.2), the mapping a →a for a ∈F and
x →x2 deﬁnes a valuation-preserving embedding σ of F(x) into F2 over F – and,
on the other hand, x2 occupies the same position (relative to the elements of F) with
respect to the ordering <2, as x does with respect to <1. Hence, as in (4.4.2), in
order to achieve this, we consider the following set of formulae:
Φ(v0) = {(1 | v0 ∧v0 | 1)}∪
{(a < v0 ∧1 | v0 −a ∧v0 −a | 1) | a ∈O, a <1 x}∪
{(v0 < b ∧1 | v0 −b ∧v0 −b | 1) | b ∈O, x <1 b}.
For any x2 ∈F2 satisfying Φ, the residue class x2 occupies the same position relative
to the elements of F that x does. It is clear that Φ is ﬁnitely satisﬁable in F2. By the
κ+-saturation of (F2,<2, |2 ), it is therefore clear that there is, in fact, an x2 ∈F2
satisfying Φ.
For such an x2 ∈F2, x2 is, in particular, transcendental over F, and x2 > 0. There-
fore x2 is also transcendental over F. Hence the mapping a →a for a ∈F and x →x2
deﬁnes a monomorphism σ from F(x) into F2 over F, which can be proved to be
valuation-preserving by the same argument as in the proof of (4.4.2). In order to
show order-preservation, we observe, ﬁrst, that x2 occupies the same position rela-
tive to the elements of F as x does. If, say, 0 < a <1 x for a ∈F, it then follows that
0 ≤a < x and thence 0 ≤a < x2. But this last implies a <2 x2. If x <1 b for b ∈F,
one deduces x2 <2 b analogously (where in this case v(b) can be < 0). Now since

4.5 Real Closed Valued Fields
157
every (monic) polynomial f(X) with coefﬁcients in the real closed ﬁeld F can be
written as the product of factors of the forms
X −a
or
(X −a)2 +b2,
with a,b ∈F and b ̸= 0, the position of x (or of x2) with respect to the elements of
F determines the sign of f(x) (or of f(x2), respectively).
Since F′ is algebraic over F(x), the monomorphism σ on F(x) has an order-
preserving extension σ′ deﬁned on F′. By the unique extendability of a convex
valuation ring to the real closure, σ′ is also valuation-preserving.
Case 2: Γ ′ ̸= Γ . Let, say, v′(x) ∈Γ ′ \Γ , with 0 <1 x. Since for every n ≥2 we
can extract an nth root of any positive element of F, the group Γ is divisible, as in
the proof of (4.4.2). Hence, as before, x is transcendental over F.
This time we consider the following set Φ(v0) of formulae:
{¬v0 | a | a ∈F, v(a) < v′(x)}∪{¬b | v0 | b ∈F, v′(x) < v(b)}.
Since the group Γ2 is divisible and, by hypothesis, nontrivial, Φ is ﬁnitely satisﬁable
in F2. By the κ+-saturation of (F2,<2, |2 ), there is, then, an x2 ∈F2 that satisﬁes
Φ and is, without loss of generality, positive. Since, in particular, v2(x2) /∈Γ holds,
x2 is, as in the proof of (4.4.2), transcendental over F, and the mapping a →a for
a ∈F and x →x2 determines a valuation-preserving monomorphism σ of F(x) into
F2 over F. This is also order-preserving, however, since from 0 ≤a <1 x or x <1 b
with a,b ∈F, it follows immediately that v(a) > v′(x) or v′(x) > v(b), respectively.
But this has as consequences that v(a) > v2(x2) or v2(x2) > v(b), and thus a <2 x2
or x2 <2 b, respectively. Now the order-preservation of σ follows as in Case 1.
Just as in Case 1, σ can be extended to the algebraic extension F′ of F(x).
Case 3: F′ = F and Γ ′ = Γ . Here, for any t ∈F1 \ F with t >1 0, we can, as in
the proof of (4.4.2), ﬁnd a t2 ∈F2 satisfying (4.4.2.3). It remains to show that the
mapping a →a for a ∈F and t →t2 deﬁnes a monomorphism σ of F(t) into F2 over
F that preserves the orderings and the valuations. That σ is value-preserving is just
the statement of Lemma 4.5.2 below (observing also Remark 4.5.3(2) thereafter).
To show that σ is order-preserving, it again sufﬁces to show that t2 occupies the
same place with respect to the elements of F that t does. So suppose 0 < a <1 t with
a ∈F. We choose b ∈F with 0 < b and v(b) = v′(t −a). Then (t −a)b−1 is >1 0
and a unit in O′. Therefore in F′ we have
0 < (t −a)b−1 ∈F.
Since σ is value-preserving, however, (t −a)b−1 = (t2 −a)b−1. We thereby obtain,
ﬁnally, 0 <2 (t2 −a)b−1, and, using 0 < b, also 0 <2 t2 −a. For the case t <1 b with
b ∈F we deduce t2 <2 b, analogously.
⊓⊔
It remains to prove the following lemma:
Lemma 4.5.2. Let (F,O) be a valued ﬁeld admitting no proper, immediate, alge-
braic extension. Further, let v′ be an immediate extension of v = vO to the rational

158
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
function ﬁeld F′ = F(t). Then the values v′(t −a) for a ∈F determine v′ uniquely.
More precisely, if v′′ is any extension of v to F′ satisfying
v′(t −a) = v′′(t −a)
for all a ∈F,
(4.5.2.1)
then for every monic polynomial f(t) ∈F[t]:
v′(f(t)) = v′′(f(t)) ∈Γ .
(4.5.2.2)
Proof: We shall prove (4.5.2.2) by induction on the degree n of f(t). The case n = 1
is just (4.5.2.1). Suppose n ≥2, and (4.5.2.2) is true for all degrees < n. Then we
prove (4.5.2.2) for degree n. If f is reducible in F[t], then we obtain (4.5.2.2) from
the induction hypothesis. So let f be irreducible in F[t], with deg f = n. The valua-
tions v′ and v′′ of F(t) agree with each other on the n-dimensional vector subspace
(over F)
V = F +Ft +···+Ftn−1
of F(t), by the induction hypothesis. Write w for the (common) restriction v′|V =
v′′|V of v′ and v′′ to V. Then
w : V →Γ ∪{∞}
is surjective,
(4.5.2.3)
since v′(F×) is already equal to Γ .
We deﬁne a “multiplication modulo f” on V, as usual. Then V becomes isomor-
phic to the ﬁeld
F1 = F[t]/(f);
more precisely, every element of F1 is of the form g+(f), for a uniquely determined
g ∈V; we identify g with g+(f). Then (4.5.2.3) can be regarded as a mapping
w : F1 →Γ ∪{∞}
which, if it satisﬁed the multiplicative property
w(g·h) = w(g)+w(h)
for g,h ∈V, would be an immediate extension of the valuation v on F to the alge-
braic extension ﬁeld F1. But this is not possible, by the hypothesis. Therefore there
exist g,h ∈V with
w(r) ̸= w(g)+w(h) = v′(gh),
(4.5.2.4)
where r ∈F[t] is the remainder of the polynomial gh upon division by f. Using
degr < n = deg f, we get r ∈V. The unique quotient q ∈F[t] satisfying the relation
gh = fq+r
has degree ≤n−2 < n, and thus also lies in V. From this and (4.5.2.4) we obtain

4.6 Henselian Fields
159
v′(f) = v′(gh−r)−w(q)
= min{v′(gh), w(r)}−w(q)
= min{w(g)+w(h), w(r)}−w(q).
(4.5.2.5)
Since, as already noted, v′ and v′′ both agree with w on V, we conclude that v′′(f) is
also equal to (4.5.2.5), and hence equal to v′(f), proving (4.5.2.2) for f. In particular,
therefore,
v′(f) = v′′(f).
⊓⊔
Remark 4.5.3. Examples of valued ﬁelds (F,O) satisfying the hypotheses of Lemma
4.5.2 include:
(1) F algebraically closed and O arbitrary.
(2) F real closed and O convex.
(3) (F,O) Henselian and charF = 0.
(4) (F,O) p-adically closed (cf. Exercise 4.7.1).
Proof: That example (1) satisﬁes the hypotheses is trivial. That examples (3) and
(4) satisfy the hypotheses follows from Theorem 4.3.5. We immediately see that
example (2) satisﬁes the hypotheses, as follows: since O is convex, F is ordered.
In the only proper, algebraic extension ﬁeld of F, the algebraic closure F of F,
however, −1 = a2 holds for some a ∈F. For an immediate extension of O, then,
−1 = a2 must hold in the residue ﬁeld; but this is identical with F.
⊓⊔
The next corollary follows by analogy with Corollaries 4.4.3 and 4.4.4:
Corollary 4.5.4. The theory of real closed ﬁelds with nontrivial convex valuation
ring is model complete and complete. It is the model companion of the theory of
ordered ﬁelds with convex valuation ring.
⊓⊔
4.6 Henselian Fields
In this section we present the model theory of Henselian ﬁelds. At the end, we
shall give an application to the ﬁeld of number theory. First, however, we convince
ourselves that the class of Henselian ﬁelds is axiomatizable in the language of ﬁelds
with the additional unary predicate V (for a valuation ring).
To the axioms K1–K9 (from Section 1.6) and V1–V3 (from Section 4.4) we add,
for every degree n ≥2, the axiom Hn. In Hn we shall express condition (3) of The-
orem 4.3.2 for all monic polynomials f of degree n. If
f = Xn +xn−1Xn−1 +···+x0,
then we shall, in Hn, utilize the expressions (∀f ∈V[X])ϕ and ψ(f(y)), which are
abbreviations for the expressions

160

∀x0,...,xn−1
n−1


and ψ(yn + xn−1yn−1 + ··· + x0), respectively. Furthermore, f ′ will stand for the
formal derivative
nXn−1 +(n−1)xn−1Xn−2 +···+x1
of f. Finally, V ×(z) will be the formula
V(z) ∧∃y(yz .= 1 ∧V(y)),
which asserts that z is a unit in V. We now put:
Hn :
(∀f ∈V[X]) ∀y [¬V ×(f(y)) ∧V ×(f ′(y)) ∧V(y) →
∃z(V(z) ∧f(z) .= 0 ∧¬V ×(y−z))].
In the following we shall exploit the fact that we can also speak about the residue
ﬁeld F and the value group Γ in the language of valued ﬁelds (F,O), as follows.
For the residue ﬁelds we introduce the following “translation” ϕr of a formula ϕ
of the ﬁeld language, which we deﬁne by recursion on its construction:
(t1 .= t2)r := ¬V ×(t1 −t2)
(¬ϕ)r := ¬ϕr
(ϕ ∧ψ)r := (ϕr ∧ψr)
(∀xϕ)r := ∀x(V(x) →ϕr)
If Fr(ϕ) ⊆{v0,...,vn}, then this holds also for ϕr, and if a0,...,an ∈O, then, for
the valued ﬁeld (F,O) we have:
F |= ϕ [a0,...,an]
iff
(F,O) |= ϕr [a0,...,ar].
Readers may easily convince themselves of this using induction on the recursive
construction of formulae.
We deﬁne the “translation” ϕg of a formula ϕ of the language of ordered groups
as follows (where we write the group operation multiplicatively in this exceptional
case):
(t1 .= t2)g := ∃x(V ×(x) ∧xt1 .= t2)
(t1 < t2)g := ∃x(V(x) ∧¬V ×(x) ∧xt1 .= t2)
(in both cases x should not occur in either t1 or t2)

4.6 Henselian Fields
161
(¬ϕ)g := ¬ϕg
(ϕ ∧ψ)g := (ϕg ∧ψg)
(∀xϕ)g := ∀x(x ̸= 0 →ϕg)
If Fr(ϕ) ⊆{v0,...,vn}, then this holds also for ϕg, and if a0,...,an ∈F×, then we
have:
Γ |= ϕ [a0O×,...,anO×]
iff
(F,O) |= ϕg [a0,...,ar].
This, too, is easily proved by induction on the recursive construction of formulae.
From our reﬂections above, the following emerges: if Φ is a type of F with
certain constants a, then Φr = {ϕr | ϕ ∈Φ } is a type of (F,O) with certain repre-
sentatives a of the residue classes a; and analogously for Γ . We therefore obtain:
If the valued ﬁeld (F,O) is κ-saturated,
then so are its residue ﬁeld F and its value group Γ .
(4.6.0.1)
The following theorem (as well as the Embedding Lemma 4.6.2) contains the
essential kernel of the theorem of Ax-Kochen and Ershov (Theorem 4.6.4). The
proof of the lemma is analogous to the proofs of Theorems 4.4.2 and 4.5.1.
Theorem 4.6.1 (Ax-Kochen, Ershov). Let (F,O) be a Henselian valued ﬁeld with
value group Γ and residue ﬁeld F. We assume charF = 0. Then if (F1,O1) ⊇(F,O)
is a valued ﬁeld with value group Γ1 and residue ﬁeld F1, and if Γ is existentially
closed (as an ordered group) in Γ1, and F is existentially closed (as a ﬁeld) in F1,
then also (F,O) is existentially closed in (F1,O1).
Proof: Let (F2,O2) be an elementary, κ+-saturated extension of (F,O), where
κ = card(F1). Since (F,O) is Henselian, so is (F2,O2). Such an extension exists by
Theorem 2.5.2. We shall show that (F1,O1) embeds in (F2,O2) over (F,O). Then
by Corollary 2.5.5(2), (F,O) will be existentially closed in (F1,O1).
By (4.6.0.1), the residue ﬁeld F2 and the value group Γ2 of (F2,O2) are likewise
κ+-saturated. From Corollary 2.5.5(1)(a) combined with the hypothesis of the theo-
rem, we conclude that the residue ﬁeld F1 and the value group Γ1 of (F1,O1) embed
into F2 and Γ2 over F and Γ , respectively. By means of these embeddings we assume
from now on that F1 ⊆F2 and Γ1 ⊆Γ2. We further assume that (F1,O1) is likewise
Henselian. This can be achieved immediately by passing to the Henselization, which
does not alter the hypotheses on the residue ﬁeld and the value group.
Now we have the following situation:

where (F1,O1) and (F2,O2) are Henselian, (F2,O2) is card(F1)+-saturated, and the
following conditions hold:
(i) (F,O) is Henselian,
(ii) F ⊆F1 ⊆F2, and

162
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
(iii) Γ ⊆Γ1 ⊆Γ2 and
Γ is pure in Γ1, i.e. if nγ1 ∈Γ for γ1 ∈Γ1 and n ≥1, then already γ1 ∈Γ .
We shall show that this is sufﬁcient for the embedding id of (F,O) to extend to
an embedding of (F1,O1) into (F2,O2). With the help of Zorn’s lemma (and after
identiﬁcation with the image), we may assume that the embedding id of (F,O) is
maximal with (i)–(iii). Then we have to show F = F1. So we assume F ̸= F1, and
distinguish three cases, as in the proof of Theorem 4.4.2.
Case 1: F ̸= F1. Let, say, x1 ∈O1 with x1 ∈F1 \ F. We ﬁrst assume that x1 is
transcendental over F. Then pick x2 ∈O2 with x2 = x1. (Here we write
for the
residue class both in O1 and in O2, so long as this does not lead to collisions.)
By Theorem 4.3.1(2), x1 and x2 are transcendental over F. Therefore, the mapping
a →a for a ∈F and x1 →x2 deﬁnes a monomorphism σ from F(x1) into F2 over
F, which respects the valuations O1 and O2 as in Case 1 of the proof of (4.4.2).
Namely, for a0,...,an ∈F and k = 1,2, we just get
vk(anxn
k +···+a0) = min
0≤i≤nv(ai),
as in (4.4.2.1). From this we see, in particular, that for the value group Γ ′ and the
residue ﬁeld F′ of the restriction O′
k of Ok to F′
k = F(xk), we have:
Γ ′ = Γ
and
F′ = F(x1) = F(x2).
We must still extend σ to an algebraic extension of F′
1, in order to obtain (i) again.
For this we pass from (F′
k,O′
k) to the corresponding Henselization, which, by
Theorem 4.3.3, we can assume to be a subﬁeld of (Fk,Ok). By the uniqueness of the
Henselization, σ extends to it. We may therefore assume that (i) is still fulﬁlled for
(F′
k,O′
k).
It remains to consider algebraic extensions of F′ in F1. For this, let α ∈F1 \ F
be algebraic over F′. Let a monic polynomial f1(X) ∈O1[X] be chosen so that
f1 = Irr

α,F′	
. Since charF1 = 0, α is a simple zero of f1 in F1. Since (F1,O1) is
Henselian, there is a β1 ∈O1 with f1(β1) = 0 and β1 = α. Then the restriction of
O1 to F′
1(β1) yields, using Theorem 4.3.1(2), the residue ﬁeld F′
1(α) and the value
group Γ . If f2 = σ(f1) ∈O2[X], then, analogously, α is a simple zero of f2 in F2.
As before, there exists a β2 ∈O2 with f2(β2) = 0 and β2 = α. Since both f1 and f2
are irreducible over F′
1 and F′
2, respectively, we obtain an extension
σ : F′
1(β1) →F′
2(β2)
of σ, which, by the uniqueness of the extension of the valuation O′
k to F′
k(xk) (for
k = 1,2) is also valuation preserving.
We have thus, under the assumption that F ̸= F1, reached a contradiction to the
maximality of the embeddability of (F,O) into (F2,O2). Therefore F = F1.
Case 2: F = F1 and Γ ̸= Γ1. Let γ ∈Γ1 \Γ and x ∈F1 with v1(x) = γ. By (iii),
the sum Γ +Zγ is direct. Then for a0,...,an ∈F it follows, as in (4.4.2.2), that

4.6 Henselian Fields
163
v′(anxn +···+a0) = min
0≤i≤n(v(ai)+iγ).
(4.6.1.1)
Therefore the restriction O′
1 of O1 to the intermediate ﬁeld F′
1 = F(x) has Γ ⊕Zγ
as value group; its residue ﬁeld obviously remains F1. By Theorem 4.3.1(2), x is
transcendental over F.
Now, before we seek an embedding of (F′
1,O′
1) into (F2,O2) over (F,O), we
want to extend F′
1 algebraically far enough so that its value group is once again pure
in Γ1. We do this as follows. Let Γ ′
1 be the value group of (F′
1,O′
1), and suppose Γ ′
1
is not pure in Γ1. Then there is a prime number q and a δ ∈Γ1 \Γ ′
1 such that qδ ∈
Γ ′
1 . Choose y ∈F1 with v1(y) = δ and a ∈F′
1 with v′
1(a) = qδ. Then v1(yqa−1) =
0. Therefore yqa−1 is a unit in O1, and, using F1 = F′
1, there is a c ∈F′
1, c ̸= 0,
with yqa−1 = c, i.e. yqa−1c−1 = 1. Therefore, since charF1 = 0, (the residue of)
the polynomial Xq −yqa−1c−1 ∈O1[X] has a simple zero in F1. Then the Henselian
property of (F1,O1) guarantees the existence of a z ∈O×
1 with zq = yqa−1c−1. Hence
ac is a qth power in F1. It is therefore clear that F′
1(yz−1) is an algebraic extension
of F′
1, whose value group contains v1(yz−1) = v1(y) −v1(z) = δ −0. If we iterate
this process sufﬁciently often (or simply apply Zorn’s lemma), we ﬁnally obtain an
algebraic extension (F′′
1 ,O′′
1 ) of (F′
1,O′
1) with O′′
1 = O1 ∩F′′
1 , whose value group Γ ′′
1
is pure in Γ1. It remains to ﬁnd a valuation-preserving embedding of the valued ﬁeld
(F′′
2 ,O′′
1 ) into (F1,O2) over (F,O).
By the card(F1)+-saturation of (F2,O2), it sufﬁces, by Corollary 2.5.5(1)(b), to
embed every ﬁnitely generated extension F∗
1 of F in F′′
1 with the induced valuation
O∗
1 into (F2,O2) over (F,O). So let F∗
1 = F(x,y1), where y1 ∈F′′
1 is algebraic over
F(x). Recall that the value group of F(x) is just
Γ ⊕Zv1(x).
By Theorem 4.3.1(2), the value group Γ ∗
1 of F∗
1 is a ﬁnite extension of Γ ⊕Zv1(x).
Then by the purity of Γ in Γ1, Γ ∗
1 itself must have the form Γ ⊕Zγ1 for some
γ1 ∈Γ1. If x1 ∈F∗
1 is such that v1(x1) = γ1, then (F∗
1 ,O∗
1) is obviously an immediate
extension of (F(x1), O1 ∩F(x1)). Namely, the valuation on F(x1) is, as in (4.6.1.1),
given by
v1(anxn
1 +···+a0) = min
0≤i≤n(v(ai)+iγ1)
for a0,...,an ∈F; therefore the value group is Γ ⊕Zγ1.
Now it sufﬁces to choose x2 ∈F2 such that v2(x2) = γ1. It then again follows that
v2(anxn
2 +···+a0) = min
0≤i≤n(v(ai)+iγ1)
for a0,...,an ∈F. Therefore the mapping a →a for a ∈F and x1 →x2 deﬁnes
a valuation-preserving embedding of F(x1) into F2. As in Case 1, this embedding
extends to the Henselization of F(x1) (which is contained in F1). However, using
charF1 = 0 and Theorem 4.3.5, the Henselization is a maximal, immediate, alge-
braic extension of (F(x1), O1 ∩F(x1)). We may therefore assume that F∗
1 is con-
tained in the Henselization, and so obtain a valuation-preserving embedding of F∗
1

164
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
into F2. Finally, we therefore also know that F′′
1 has a valuation-preserving embed-
ding into F2 over F.
Properties (ii) and (iii) hold for (F′′
1 ,O′′
1 ). Property (i) can be achieved as in
Case 1, by passing to the Henselization. In summary the assumption Γ ̸= Γ1 has
led to a contradiction of the maximality of F. Therefore we must have Γ = Γ1, after
all.
Case 3: F = F1 and Γ = Γ1. Assume F ̸= F1. Let, say, x1 ∈F1 \F. Since (F,O)
is Henselian and charF1 = 0, the element x1 must be transcendental over F, by
Theorem 4.3.5. As in (4.4.2.3), we ﬁnd an x2 ∈F2 \F with
v1(x1 −a) = v2(x2 −a)
for all a ∈F.
To conclude that x2 is transcendental over F, we extend the type Φ(v0) in (4.4.2.4)
to
Φ1(v0) = Φ(v0)∪{ f(x0) ̸= 0 | f ∈F[X] irreducible and deg f > 1}.
Using Theorem 4.3.5 and Lemma 4.5.2, the mapping a →a for a ∈F and x1 →x2
deﬁnes a valuation-preserving monomorphism of F(x1) into F2, whose canonical
extension to the Henselization again has properties (i)–(iii). This contradicts our
maximality assumption. Finally, therefore, F = F1.
⊓⊔
Looking ahead to further applications, we would like to isolate the embedding
part of this proof. Strictly speaking, we have proved the following embedding
lemma:
Lemma 4.6.2 (Embedding lemma). For k = 1,2, let (Fk,Ok) be a Henselian ﬁeld,
with Henselian subﬁeld (F′
k,O′
k). Further, let σ′ : (F′
1,O′
1) →(F′
2,O′
2) be an isomor-
phism, and let σ′
r : F′
1 →F′
2 and σ′
g : Γ ′
1 →Γ ′
2 be the isomorphisms induced by σ′ on
the residue ﬁeld and the value group, respectively. Suppose Γ ′
1 is pure in Γ1. Then if
(F2,O2) is card(F1)+-saturated, and if σ′
r and σ′
g extend to embeddings σr and σg of
F1 into F2 and of Γ1 into Γ2, respectively, then also σ′ extends to an embedding σ of
(F1,O1) into (F2,O2) that induces σr and σg. Here it is assumed that char

F1
	
= 0.
⊓⊔
Using Theorem 4.6.1 and Robinson’s Test 3.3.3, we obtain:
Corollary 4.6.3. Let Tr be a model complete theory of ﬁelds with characteristic 0,
and Tg a model complete theory of ordered Abelian groups. Then the theory T of
Henselian valued ﬁelds whose residue ﬁeld is a model of Tr and whose value group
is a model of Tg, is itself model complete.
⊓⊔
Recall the translations ϕ →ϕr and ϕ →ϕg that we deﬁned at the beginning of
this section. If Σr is an axiom system for Tr, and Σg an axiom system for Tg, then
the theory T described in the corollary can be axiomatized by:
(1) K1–K9,

(2) V1–V3, Hn for n ≥2,
(3) αr for α ∈Σr,
(4) βg for β ∈Σg.
The next theorem was proved independently by Ax-Kochen and Ershov. It is the
main theorem in the model theory of Henselian ﬁelds.
Theorem 4.6.4 (Ax-Kochen, Ershov). Let (F1,O1) and (F2,O2) be Henselian ﬁelds
with elementarily equivalent residue ﬁelds F1,F2 and elementarily equivalent value
groups Γ1,Γ2, respectively. Then if the residue characteristic is 0, then also (F1,O1)
and (F2,O2) are elementarily equivalent.
Proof: The strategy of the proof is the following. First we assume, by applying
Theorem 2.5.2, that (Fk,Ok) is ℵ1-saturated (k = 1,2). Then it is clear that in
the passage to elementary extensions (or elementary substructures), the elementary
equivalence of the residue ﬁelds and of the value groups will be preserved. Next, we
construct, using Corollary 2.3.4, an ascending chain

For n = 0 let F(0)

we have:

⊓⊔
Finally, we would like to give an application of Theorem 4.6.4 to the so-called
“Artin Conjecture.” This application contributed especially to the success of the
model theory of Henselian ﬁelds.
A ﬁeld F is called a Ci-ﬁeld if for every d ≥1, every homogeneous polynomial
of degree d in more than di variables over F represents zero nontrivially over F
(i.e. has a nontrivial zero in F). It is known that all ﬁnite ﬁelds Fq are C1-ﬁelds,
and the ﬁeld Fq((t)) of formal Laurent series over any ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq is a C2-ﬁeld.
Artin’s conjecture was that every p-adic number ﬁeld Qp is a C2-ﬁeld. This con-
jecture is suggested by the relative similarity of Fq((t)) and Qp. Both ﬁelds are
Henselian valued, and in both cases Z is the value group and Fp is the residue ﬁeld.
The essential distinction between the two ﬁelds lies in the characteristic: while the
characteristic of Fq((t)) is prime (namely, p), Qp has characteristic 0. This distinc-
tion is removed when we take ultraproducts. The next theorem is based on this and
on Theorem 4.6.4.
Theorem 4.6.5 (Ax-Kochen: Afﬁrmation of Artin’s Conjecture for ﬁxed degree and
almost all p). For every degree d ≥1 there exists a lower bound nd such that for
p ≥nd, every homogeneous polynomial of degree d in more than d2 variables over
Qp represents zero nontrivially in Qp.

168
4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
Proof: Suppose that for some d there were no such bound. Then there would exist
an inﬁnite subset B of the set P of all prime numbers such that for every p ∈B there
is a homogeneous polynomial fp of degree d in more than d2 variables over Qp
that has only the trivial zero in Qp. One easily sees that by suitable substitutions we
can arrange that all polynomials fp begin with X p
1 . Now if we set sufﬁciently many
variables Xi (with i ̸= 1) equal to 0, then we can assume that fp is a polynomial in
the variables X1,...,Xd2+1. If we write
f

Y1,...,Ym;X1,...,Xd2+1
	
∈Z

Y1,...,Ym;X1,...,Xd2+1

for the general homogeneous polynomial of degree d in the variables X1,...,Xd2+1
with indeterminate coefﬁcients Y1,...,Ym (where m =
d2+d
d
	
), then for all p ∈B the
following elementary sentence α in the language of ﬁelds holds in Qp:

,
where n = d2 +1.
Let D0 be the ﬁlter of all coﬁnite subsets of P. Then obviously
D0 ∪{U ∩B | U ∈D0 }
is a system of nonempty subsets of P that is closed under ﬁnite intersection. By
Lemma 2.6.1, it can be extended to an ultraﬁlter D on P. Since B ∈D, Theo-
rem 2.6.2 implies that the sentence α holds also in the ultraproduct
F1 = ∏
p∈P
Qp

D.
Since, as we mentioned above, all ﬁelds Fp((t)) are C2-ﬁelds, ¬α holds in Fp((t))
for all p ∈P. Consequently, ¬α holds in the ultraproduct
F2 = ∏
p∈P
Fp((t))

D.
But, as we shall soon see, F1 and F2 are elementarily equivalent. Hence we have
arrived at a contradiction to the supposition of the nonexistence of a bound nd.
In order to see F1 ≡F2, we form the ultraproducts of the ﬁelds considered above
together with their canonical valuation rings; i.e.
(F1,O1) = ∏
p∈P
(Qp,Zp)

D
and
(F2,O2) = ∏

The value group of these two valued ﬁelds is, in each case, the ultraproduct

With this theorem, Ax and Kochen proved in 1965 that for ﬁxed degree, Artin’s
conjecture holds in almost all Qp. For the case of quadratic forms, i.e. d = 2, it had
long been known that this holds even in all Qp. The corresponding result for d = 3
was proved in 1952 by D.J. Lewis. For d ≥4, however, Theorem 4.6.5 proved to be
the best possible result. Namely, in 1966 Terjanian proved that the form
f(X1,X2,X3)+ f(Y1,Y2,Y3)+ f(Z1, Z2, Z3)+
4 f(U1,U2,U3)+4f(V1,V2,V3)+4f(W1,W2,W3),

has no nontrivial zero in Q2. Thus, for degree 4, Artin’s conjecture does not hold in
all Qp (speciﬁcally, Q2 is not a C2-ﬁeld).
4.7 Exercises for Chapter 4
4.7.1. A valued ﬁeld (F,O) is called p-adically closed (cf. [Prestel–Roquette, 1984];
there designated “with p-rank 1”) if the following hold:
(i) charF = 0 and (F,O) is Henselian,
(ii) the residue ﬁeld F is the ﬁeld Fp with p elements, and
(iii) the value group Γ is a Z-group in which the value of p is minimal positive.
The p-adic numbers Qp with the p-adic valuation are p-adically closed.

4 Model Theory of Several Algebraic Theories
Show that the class of p-adically closed ﬁelds is model complete and axiomatiz-
able in the language of valued ﬁelds.
Hints: Apply Theorems 4.1.3 and 4.3.5, and show that the proof of Theorem 4.6.1 carries over
to the case of two p-adically closed ﬁelds (F,O) ⊆(F1,O1). For this, observe that Case 1 of that
proof does not arise, and that in Case 2 the hypothesis that charF = 0 is used only to show that
every b ∈O1 with v1(b −1) > 0 is a qth power in F1. This holds also in a p-adically closed ﬁeld
for every prime number q ̸= p. For q = p, apply the fact that b ∈O1 is a pth power provided
v1(b−1) > 2v1(p).
4.7.2. Show that the relative algebraic closure of a subﬁeld F in a p-adically closed
ﬁeld (F1,O1), with the induced valuation, is itself again p-adically closed. Conclude,
using Exercise 4.7.1, that the theory of p-adically closed ﬁelds is complete, and
hence equal to that of Qp.
4.7.3. The following theorem is known (cf. [Prestel–Roquette, 1984, 3.11]): If
(F1,O1) and (F2,O2) are p-adically closed ﬁelds with the common valued subﬁeld
(F,O), and if a ∈F is an nth power in F1 if and only if it is an nth power in F2
(n ∈N), then the relative algebraic closures of F in F1 and in F2, with the corre-
sponding, induced valuations, are isomorphic over F.
Show, with the help of this theorem and of Exercise 4.7.1, that the theory of p-
adically closed ﬁelds in the language of ﬁelds with a valuation divisibility symbol
together with unary predicate symbols Pn (n ≥2) and the additional axioms
∀x(Pn(x) ↔∃y x .= yn),
admits quantiﬁer elimination.

Appendix A
Remarks on Decidability
In this appendix we would like to describe how one can make precise the concepts
(used repeatedly in the Introduction) of “decidable” and “effectively enumerable”.
We would also like to show how a complete, effectively enumerable axiom system
leads to a decidable theory. Finally, we would like to sketch a proof, going back to
A. Tarski, of G¨odel’s ﬁrst incompleteness theorem.
When making the concepts of “decidable” and “effectively enumerable” precise,
one usually relies on the concept of “algorithm”, which, in turn, can again be made
precise with the help of discretely operating machines. As an idealization of such
a discretely operating machine, one often utilizes the “Turing machine”, which we
now brieﬂy describe. It has been proved that all idealizations of such machines con-
sidered so far, and, moreover, all proposed formalizations of the concept of “algo-
rithm”, are equivalent to each other. Considering this, the use of the concept of a
Turing machine does not represent any restriction. At this point, we refer the inter-
ested reader to the corresponding literature – e.g. [Hermes, 1965–69].
We consider a language L with ﬁnite index sets I, J and K. We generate the
variables vn (n ∈N) from the basic symbols v and ′ by identifying vn with the string
of symbols
v ′′′···′

n times
.
We have thereby arranged for the alphabet A of the language L to be ﬁnite – say, A =
{a1,...,an}. Later we shall also utilize the empty symbol, which we shall denote by
a0 (which, we assume, is not a member of A). Note that all the theories considered
in Section 1.6 were axiomatized in languages that possess, in the sense described
above, a ﬁnite alphabet.
We call a subset M of the set Sent(L) of sentences effectively enumerable if there
is a Turing machine that produces (or prints out) exactly the elements of M, in some
sequence. We call M decidable if there is a Turing machine which, upon receiving
as input an arbitrary L-sentence α, prints out (after ﬁnitely many steps of execution)
the symbol .= in case α lies in M, and the symbol ¬ in case α does not lie in M.

Appendix A: Remarks on Decidability
Here, by a Turing machine on the alphabet A = {a1,...,an}, we mean a tape that is
inﬁnitely long in both directions, with discrete ﬁelds:
...
...
,
together with a “read–write head” and a program table. Each ﬁeld of the tape either
is empty (i.e. the empty symbol a0 is there) or has been printed with exactly one
symbol a from A. At every step of execution, the read–write head can read the
“working ﬁeld” of this tape, and can perform any one of the following, ﬁnitely many
possible steps of execution:
aν :
print aν (0 ≤ν ≤n) on the working ﬁeld,1
r
:
move one ﬁeld to the right,
l
:
move one ﬁeld to the left,
s
:
stop.
Finally, the program table consists of a ﬁnite sequence of quadruples of the form
z
a
b
z′
where a is an element of A, b is a possible execution step of the work head, and z,z′
are elements of the ﬁnite set Z = {z1,...,zm}. The elements of Z are called “states”;
they can, alternatively, be presented by the numerals 1 through m.
The manner of operation of our Turing machine is uniquely determined by its
program table, as follows: if the machine is in state z, and if the input of the working
ﬁeld is a, then the work head reacts with b, and the machine goes into state z′. The
ﬁnite, four-column matrix of which the program table consists, uniquely determines
the manner of execution of the machine via the mapping
(z,a) →(b,z′).
We may therefore identify the machine with its program table.
The axiom system of each of the theories given in Section 1.6 is, in the above
precise sense, decidable. This is clear, since each such axiom system either is ﬁnite,
or consists of axioms of a single schema; either case easily permits the construc-
tion of a Turing machine that tests whether any given sentence is an axiom or not.
Hence these axiom systems are, in particular, effectively enumerable. Indeed, in
general any decidable set of sentences is effectively enumerable: one builds a Tur-
ing machine that produces all sentences of the language under consideration in some
sequence, but which prints out only those sentences that belong to M. Here, mem-
bership in M is tested by coupling with a second Turing machine, whose existence
is guaranteed by the assumed decidability of M.
The converse of the above observation does not hold: there are effectively enu-
merable sets that are not decidable (cf. [Hermes, 1965–69]).

Now, if Σ is an effectively enumerable axiom system, consisting of L-sentences,
then Ded(Σ) is likewise effectively enumerable. This is rather obvious, once one
recalls the nature of the logical axioms and rules that we introduced in Section 1.3.
One must construct a Turing machine that produces all deductions from Σ in some
sequence, where the axioms of Σ are, in turn, furnished by a second Turing machine,
whose existence is guaranteed by the hypothesis on Σ. Although this might seem not
too difﬁcult at ﬁrst glance, carrying it out completely is rather laborious. Here we
merely state this fact.
With this fact, however, the following theorem is easily proved:
Theorem A.1. Let Σ be an effectively enumerable, consistent axiom system of L-
sentences. If Σ is complete, then Ded(Σ) is a decidable theory.
In the proof, we are given a Turing machine T that effectively enumerates
Ded(Σ). Now if α is an arbitrary, given L-sentence, then we know, by the com-
pleteness of Σ, that either α or ¬α belongs to Ded(Σ). We therefore need only
construct a Turing machine T ′ that compares, one at a time, the sentences produced
by T with α and with ¬α. After ﬁnitely many steps, T will print out either α or ¬α.
We program T ′ so that in the ﬁrst case, it prints out .=, and in the second case the
symbol ¬. Thus the theorem is proved.
Theorem A.1 guarantees the decidability of a whole series of axiom systems
whose completeness we have proven throughout this book. Recalling, in addition,
that the completeness of Σ implies
Th(A) = Ded(Σ)
for every model A of Σ (1.6.0.3), we deduce, among other things, the decidability
of the theories of the following structures in the corresponding languages:
(1) the ordered, additive group of the integers Z,
(2) the ordered ﬁeld of real numbers R,
(3) the ﬁeld of complex numbers C,
(4) the algebraic closure of the prime ﬁeld Fp with p elements, and
(5) the valued ﬁeld of p-adic numbers Qp (cf. Section 4.7).
Now we would like to close this appendix with a sketch of a proof of the unde-
cidability of the theory of
N =

N;+N, ·N ;0N,1N
.
Then, by Theorem A.1, there can be no effectively enumerable axiom system Σ of
sentences of the language of N for which
Ded(Σ) = Th(N).
In particular, therefore, for the Peano axiom system ΣPA given in Section 1.6, we
have
Ded(Σ) ⊊Th(N).

174
Appendix A: Remarks on Decidability
We have thus obtained
Theorem A.2 (G¨odel’s First Incompleteness Theorem). There is a sentence α that
is true in N, but is not deducible from ΣPA. Thus, the Peano axiom system is incom-
plete.
⊓⊔
The proof of the undecidability of Th(N) is indirect. We ﬁrst assume that there
were a Turing machine T which, for any given sentence α, decides whether N |= α
or N ̸|= α holds. This Turing machine is given by a ﬁnite matrix – its program table.
Next, we encode this program table by a natural number, and simulate the behaviour
of T via number theoretic functions. For this, we may proceed as follows (say):
First we give a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the disjoint
union
A ˙∪Z ˙∪{a0,r,l,s}
(A.2.1)
and (ﬁnitely many) natural numbers – their code numbers. Then we assign to ev-
ery ﬁnite sequence of “symbols” belonging to the set (A.2.1) a natural number (its
code) in such a way that the sequence of symbols can be uniquely and effectively
reconstructed from this number. If we assume, e.g. that the symbols ¬,v0, .=,c0 are
assigned the code numbers 2, 4, 1, 3, respectively, then:
the formula ¬v0 .= c0 can be encoded by 22 ·34 ·51 ·73 (= 555,660).
From the prime-power factorization of 555,660 we could read off the exponents
of the prime numbers (in increasing order), and thereby reconstruct the formula
¬v0 .= c0. We denote the code number so assigned to a string ζ of symbols by ζ .
We can, now, in particular, assign in this way a natural number to every line
of the program table of T. Repeating this process one more time, we can assign
another natural number to the ﬁnite sequence of lines of this program table; from
this number the entire program table could be reconstructed.
Finally, we show that the execution of a computation of the Turing machine T
can be described by an arithmetic function. Here we call a function f(n) = m of
natural numbers arithmetic if there is a formula ϕ(v0,v1) of the language of N such
that, for n,m ∈N:
f(n) = m
iff
N |= ϕ(n,m).
In this case we call ϕ a deﬁning formula for f. Now if f(n) is a function that assigns
the number 1 (which is the code of .=) to the code ρ in case ρ holds in N, and the
number 2 (which is the code of ¬) in case ρ does not hold in N, then there is a
formula ϕ of the language of N with the property:
N |= ϕ

ρ ,1
	
iff
N |= ρ.
Thus we have the possibility to “speak” in N about the truth of sentences (in N).
This opens the possibility of simulating the liar’s paradox. But to do this, we must
make a small alteration.
It is easy to see that if f is arithmetic, then so is the function g deﬁned as follows
on the code ρ of a formula ρ in the distinguished variable v0:

Now if ψ is a formula deﬁning g, then for all formulae ρ in the variable v0, we have:
N |= ψ

ρ ,1
	
iff
N |= ¬ρ

ρ
	
.
(A.2.2)
Applying (A.2.2) to the formula
ρ0(v0) = ψ(v0,1),
we arrive at the contradiction
N |= ρ0

ρ0
	
iff
N |= ¬ρ0

ρ0
	
.
This contradiction arose, ultimately, from the assumption that Th(N) is decidable.
We have thus proved the undecidability of Th(N), and consequently the incomplete-
ness of the Peano axiom system.
In closing, we should mention that by similar methods one can prove the incom-
pleteness of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory given in Section 1.6.


Appendix B
Remarks on Second-Order Logic
The attentive reader will have noticed that up to now, whenever we have spoken of
“logic” in this text, we have always spoken only of ﬁrst-order logic. The mention
of a ﬁrst order suggests the existence of a second order, and perhaps even higher
orders. What, then, is the distinctive property of the ﬁrst order? We shall discuss
this question in this appendix.
One usually says that in the ﬁrst order, one may quantify only over elements of a
universe A, and not over subsets thereof or functions thereon. If we have two kinds
of quantiﬁers – one for elements of A and the other for subsets of A – , then we usu-
ally say that we have a second-order logic (more precisely, second-order monadic
logic, since here we quantify only over unary relations (i.e. subsets), and not over
n-place relations for n > 1). Usually the ﬁrst-order quantiﬁers ∀x are written with
lowercase variables, and second-order quantiﬁers (i.e. those that run over subsets of
A) are written with uppercase letters: ∀X. However, this typographical distinction is
obviously irrelevant. One could just as well write variables of the second kind us-
ing lowercase letters. Thus, there is no syntactic difference between quantiﬁers over
elements and quantiﬁers over subsets. With no additional effort one could even in-
troduce quantiﬁers over arbitrarily many sorts of objects, without thereby genuinely
passing outside the ﬁrst order. In second-order monadic logic, these sorts are, ﬁrst,
the elements of A, and, second, the subsets of A.
The actual content of the so-called “second order” lies in the semantics estab-
lished on the above-mentioned syntax. Speciﬁcally, in second-order logic, there is
an intimate, semantical connection between the ﬁrst and second sorts; namely, one
requires that the set-variables should range over “all” subsets of A; i.e. the second
sort is the full power set of the ﬁrst sort. As we shall see, this semantical connection
between the two sorts can no longer be expressed in ﬁrst-order logic: the proper-
ties of a power set cannot be expressed in ﬁrst-order logic. The situation is similar
to that of “well-orderedness”: this, too, cannot be expressed in ﬁrst-order logic; cf.
Exercise 1.7.15.
We shall now make the above statements more explicit, in the following three
steps:

Appendix B: Remarks on Second-Order Logic
Step 1: Here we shall introduce the syntax and semantics of second-order
monadic logic. The set-variables will run over all subsets of the universe A of in-
dividuals. In such a framework, the ﬁeld of real numbers, for example, can be ax-
iomatized up to isomorphism. From this it will follow that there can be no ﬁnitary,
complete deductive system in this logic, since otherwise a Finiteness Theorem (anal-
ogous to (1.5.6)) would have to hold, which would imply that we would not be able
to axiomatize any inﬁnite structure up to isomorphism.
Step 2: Here we shall consider the two kinds of variables of second-order
monadic logic, equally and independently of one another. That is, we introduce a
ﬁrst-order logic with two sorts of variables. For this there will be a complete deduc-
tive system along with the theorems of the usual ﬁrst-order logic resulting therefrom
(e.g. the Finiteness Theorem).
Step 3: Here we shall arrange for the second sort introduced in Step 2 to be a
system of subsets of the ﬁrst sort, by adding certain “structure axioms”. We shall
obtain a complete deductive system, and the corresponding theorems from ﬁrst-
order logic will continue to hold. In principle, we shall ﬁnd ourselves actually in
ﬁrst-order logic. However, what need no longer hold is the condition (required in
Step 1) that the system of subsets (= the second sort) be the full power set of the ﬁrst
sort. Structures satisfying this condition are sometimes called “standard structures”;
those violating this condition will then be called “nonstandard structures”.
Through this extension of the class of structures beyond the class considered in
Step 1, we shall have gained something – namely, a return to ﬁrst-order logic – and
we shall have, on the other hand, lost something – namely, our faith in the full power
set.
Second-Order Monadic Logic (Step 1):
Let L = (λ,μ,K) be a ﬁrst-order formal language, as introduced earlier in this book
(1.2.0.10). We enrich the alphabet with second-order variables:
V0,V1,V2,....
We write VBL for the set of these variables. If A is an L-structure with universe A,
we call a function H : VBL →P(A) an evaluation of the second-order variables in
A. Here,
P(A) = {B | B ⊆A}
is the power set of A.
We likewise enrich the set of L-terms with the second-order variables. We intro-
duce the new atomic formulae
X(t),
where X ∈VBL and t is a ﬁrst-order term. If ϕ is a formula that we have already
constructed, then ∀X ϕ will also be counted as a formula. The formulae obtained

Appendix B: Remarks on Second-Order Logic
179
by the above recursion are called the formulae of second-order monadic logic. Free
and bound occurrences of second-order variables are deﬁned analogously to those
of ﬁrst-order variables; in particular, we write FR(ϕ) for the set of all second-order
variables with free occurrences in ϕ. If Fr(ϕ) = /0 and FR(ϕ) = /0, then we call ϕ a
sentence.
Next, if A is an L-structure, ϕ is a second-order formula, and h : Vbl →A and
H : VBL →P(A) are evaluations, then we deﬁne the satisfaction relation
A |=(2) ϕ [h,H]
by recursion on the construction of ϕ, as follows:
A |=(2) X(t)[h,H]
if and only if
tA [h] ∈H(X).
A |=(2) π [h,H]
if and only if
A |= π [h],
where t is any ﬁrst-order term, and π is any ﬁrst-order atomic formula.
A |=(2) ¬ϕ [h,H]
if and only if
A ̸|=(2) ϕ [h,H].
A |=(2) (ϕ ∧ψ)[h,H] if and only if
A |=(2) ϕ [h,H] and A |=(2) ψ [h,H].
A |=(2) ∀xϕ [h,H]

for all B ∈P(A).
The alteration H

of H just above is deﬁned by analogy with that of the ﬁrst-order
evaluation h (1.5.0.3).
Now let L be the language of ordered rings, in which we formulated, e.g. the
axioms of a real closed ﬁeld (1.6). Let Σ(2) be the (ﬁnite) axiom system consisting
of the axioms of an ordered ﬁeld (viz. K1–K9, OK1 and OK2; recall (1.6)), together
with the “cut axiom”:
∀X,Y [∃xX(x)∧∃yY(y)∧∀x,y(X(x)∧Y(y) →x ≤y) →
∃z∀x,y(X(x)∧Y(y) →x ≤z ≤y)].
The models of Σ(2) are the ordered ﬁelds in which every Dedekind cut is realized.
It is well known that, up to isomorphism, there is exactly one such ﬁeld, namely,
the ﬁeld R of real numbers. (For a proof, see, e.g. [Prestel–Delzell, 2001, 1.4.1 and
1.1.5].) Therefore, in second-order monadic logic we can axiomatize R up to iso-
morphism. As a consequence, we obtain:
Theorem B.1. In second-order monadic logic there can be no relation ⊢(2) satisfy-
ing, for any set Σ of sentences and any formula ϕ:
(a) Σ ⊢(2) ϕ if and only if ϕ holds in every model of Σ, and
(b) Σ ⊢(2) ϕ if and only if Π ⊢(2) ϕ for some ﬁnite subset Π of Σ.
Proof: If there were such a complete (a) and ﬁnitary (b) deducibility relation, this
would immediately imply a ﬁniteness theorem (analogous to (1.5.6)). As an appli-

180
Appendix B: Remarks on Second-Order Logic
cation of this one would be able to prove a second-order analogue to Theorem 2.1.1:
every axiom system Σ possessing an inﬁnite model must possess models of arbitrar-
ily large cardinality. This would contradict the fact that Σ(2) possesses exactly one,
single inﬁnite model (viz. R).
⊓⊔
Two-Sorted Logic (Step 2):
Now we introduce two independent sorts of variables (of equal status). Let
v0,v1,v2,... be variables of the ﬁrst sort, and
w0,w1,w2,... be variables of the second sort.
The letters x,y,z will always denote variables of the ﬁrst sort, and the letters a,b,c
will always denote variables of the second sort. By introducing function symbols
and relation symbols for the ﬁrst sort, and, separately, other such symbols for the
second sort, we can introduce terms and formulae of the ﬁrst sort, and correspond-
ingly of the second sort, as usual. Then a structure of this language has the form
A1,2 = ⟨A1,A2;...⟩,
where A1 is the nonempty universe for the ﬁrst sort, and A2 is the nonempty uni-
verse for the second sort. The interpretation of each function and relation symbol
considered so far is always a function or a relation on A1 or A2, as appropriate.
We can, however, also allow functions and relations between A1 and A2. Then
the syntax must be correspondingly extended. Instead of carrying this out in full
generality, we restrict ourselves to one example: ﬁelds K with a valuation into an
ordered, Abelian group Γ .
For this purpose, we recall from Section 4.3 the concept of a valuation on a ﬁeld:
v : K →Γ ∪{∞}.
Here, K = ⟨K;+,−, ·;0,1⟩is a ﬁeld, Γ = ⟨Γ ;+;0;≤⟩is an ordered Abelian group,
∞is an object larger than all elements of Γ (with γ +∞= ∞+γ = ∞and ∞+∞= ∞
for all γ ∈Γ ), and v is a surjective map for which the valuation axioms
v(x) = ∞if and only if x = 0,
v(xy) = v(x)+v(y), and
v(x+y) ≥min{v(x),v(y)}
hold for all x,y ∈K. We leave it to the reader to express these axioms in a formal
language with two sorts of variables. Here, variables of the ﬁrst sort run over the
ﬁeld elements, and those of the second sort run over the group elements together
with the object ∞, i.e. over the universe Γ∞:= Γ ∪{∞}. The function symbol for v,
when applied to a term of the ﬁrst sort, produces a term of the second sort.

Appendix B: Remarks on Second-Order Logic
181
All theorems of ﬁrst-order logic hold for such a two-sorted formal system. In
particular, there is a complete (ﬁnitary) concept of deduction. This follows easily
from the fact that it is possible to translate each two-sorted language into a one-
sorted language. We carry this out below for the example of valued ﬁelds.
Let
A1,2 = ⟨A1,A2;...⟩
be a two-sorted structure such that A1 ∩A2 = /0; it may be a model of a two-sorted
axiom system Σ1,2. We associate with such a structure a one-sorted structure
A1∪2 = ⟨A1 ∪A2;...;A1,A2⟩.
Now A1 and A2 serve as additional, unary relations on the set
A = A1 ∪A2.
We shall soon show how to translate the set Σ1,2 of two-sorted axioms into a set
Σ1∪2 of one-sorted axioms, using our example of valued ﬁelds. First, however, we
must throw in the following two structure axioms:
∀x(A1(x)∨A2(x))
∀x¬(A1(x)∧A2(x))
(where we use A1 and A2 also as symbols for the corresponding unary relations).
A syntactic problem arising during this translation will be that every function on
A1 or A2 is no longer a function on A = A1 ∪A2 (since A1 and A2 are nonempty
and disjoint). We shall therefore conceive of such functions as relations. Thus, we
replace the valuation function v, for example, with a binary relation (still denoted
by v). Then the structure axioms
∀x,y(v(x,y) →K(x)∧Γ∞(y))
∀x

K(x) →∃=1y(Γ∞(y)∧v(x,y))
	
express that v is a function from K to Γ∞. Finally, the valuation axioms themselves
now read as follows:
∀x(v(x,∞) ↔x .= 0),
∀x,y,z,a,b,c(·(x,y,z)∧◦(a,b,c)∧v(x,a)∧v(y,b) →v(z,c)), and
∀x,y,z,a,b,c(+(x,y,z)∧v(x,a)∧v(y,b)∧v(z,c)∧a ≤b →a ≤c).
Here, + and · are ternary relation symbols representing the addition and multipli-
cation on K, and ◦is a ternary relation symbol representing the addition on Γ∞. Of
course, for +, ·, and ◦we must also include structure axioms corresponding to those

Appendix B: Remarks on Second-Order Logic
All the methods and theorems of ﬁrst-order logic now apply to the language for
structures of the form A1∪2 and the translation Σ1∪2 of the axioms Σ1,2. For example,
for every inﬁnite, valued ﬁeld v : K →Γ∞, there is always a countable, elementarily
equivalent valued ﬁeld v′ : K′ →Γ ′
∞. In particular, there is also a complete (ﬁnitary)
deductive system for two-sorted logic, namely, the one from ﬁrst-order logic applied
to the translation.
Reduced Second-Order Logic (Step 3):
Now we try to understand the language of second-order monadic logic as a two-
sorted language, and to translate it into ﬁrst-order logic, as in Step 2 above. We
must consider two-sorted structures of the form
A1,2 = ⟨A1,A2;...⟩,
where, in the standard structures considered in Step 1, A2 is the power set of A1. If
we perform the translation into ﬁrst-order logic, we shall again need representing
relation symbols A1 and A2 for the new universe
A = A1 ∪A2.
Moreover, we must linguistically capture the application of an element B of A2 =
P(A1) to an element a ∈A1. Recall that B is a subset of A1, and B(a) now means
that a is an element of B. For this, we introduce the new binary relation ∈, and we
add the new binary relation symbol ε to the language.
Now the second-order axiom system Σ(2) for complete ordered ﬁelds can be
translated into a ﬁrst-order axiom system Σ. Applying ﬁrst-order theorems, we ﬁ-
nally obtain a countable structure
A′
1,2 = ⟨A′
1,A′
2;...;⊏−⟩
that is elementarily equivalent to
⟨R,P(R);...;∈⟩.
In A′
1,2, ⊏
−is the interpretation of the symbol ε; thus, it is a relation between elements
of A′
1 and elements of A′
2.
Obviously A′
1 is again an ordered ﬁeld; it is therefore (countably) inﬁnite. Since
A′
2 is at most countable, it obviously cannot be the power set of A′
1. What, then, is
A′
2?
As we shall soon see, A′
2 is actually isomorphic to a subset of the power set
P(A′
1) of A′
1. Since A′
1,2 satisﬁes the axiom system Σ(2), “cuts belonging to A′
2”
are realized in A′
1. But since A′
2 does not contain all the cuts on A′
1, A′
1 cannot be
Dedekind complete.

Appendix B: Remarks on Second-Order Logic
183
In order to see that one can view A′
2 as a subset of P(A′
1), consider the function
g : A′
2 →P(A′
1)
deﬁned by g(b) := {a ∈A′
1 | a ⊏−b} for b ∈A′
2.
This function is injective, since in our standard structure ⟨R,P(R);...;∈⟩, the
extensionality axiom ZF1,
∀a,b(∀x(ε(x,a) ↔ε(x,b)) →a .= b)
(B.1.1)
(Section 1.6), holds. Since A′
1,2 is elementarily equivalent to ⟨R,P(R);...;∈⟩,
(B.1.1) holds also in A′
1,2. Thus, g(b1) = g(b2) implies b1 = b2. The injectivity of g
means that we can identify A′
2 with a subset of P(A′
1), as claimed.
Our example shows, in particular, that, on the one hand, all sentences about the
∈-relation between R and P(R) expressible in the two-sorted language, carry over
to A′
1 and A′
2, and, on the other hand, this is never sufﬁcient to guarantee that A′
2 is
the “full” power set of A′
1.
