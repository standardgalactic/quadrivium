General do it yourself safety comments  
Safety do's - Safety don'ts
The home can be a highly dangerous area so every diy'er needs to take some precaution 
and, more importantly, use common sense. The following are some basic principles for the do 
it yourself person.  
Do's 
• 
Always keep safely in mind before you do any diy activity, use caution, care, and 
good judgement - if in doubt, don't !  
• 
Always read the labels on cans containing paints, solvents, and other products; AND 
always follow the guidelines and any other warnings.  
• 
Always read the manufacturer's instructions (especially the warnings) before using 
any tool, especially power tools with cutting blades/bits.  
• 
Always pay deliberate attention to how a tool works, if you understand it's operation, 
you are less likely to cause injury.  
• 
Always know and accept the limitations of your tools - use the appropriate tool for the 
task. Do not try to use a tool for anything it is not designed to do.  
• 
Always remove the key from any drill chuck (hand or stand mounted) after you have 
removed/fitted a drill bit. Do not leave the key in the chuck even when the drill is 
switched off.  
• 
Always wear the appropriate protection for the job in hand. This may involve gloves, 
facemasks (to filter dust etc.) and/or eye protection.  
• 
Always keep your body (especially hands) away from the business ends of power 
tools using blades, cutters, and bits.  
• 
Always make sure that any tool adjustment is secured before using the tool - it is 
always better to double check an adjustment - e.g., always check the fence on a saw 
bench - this will avoid possible injury and scraped material.  
• 
Always be sure that the electrical supply is safe before using it; do not overload any 
circuit. Make sure all power tools, extension cables and electrical outlets are 
serviceable and undamaged. Do not use power tools in wet conditions.  
• 
Always check for possible cables/pipework before drilling or cutting 'blind' into any 
wall or other surface. Take care when you cannot see the reverse side of what you 
are drilling or cutting.  
• 
Always use special care when using a saw bench; older benches may not have the 
latest safest features (blade guard, safety cut-out etc.). Avoid sawing short pieces if 
you can, as these can be hard to keep a firm grip of..  
• 
Always clamp small workpieces firmly to a bench or other work surface when using a 
power tool on them.  
• 
Always remember that things can go wrong very quickly and the body's reaction will 
not always be quick enough.  
• 
Always use both hands where a tool is designed to be used two handed.  
• 
Always ensure that the work area is adequately lit.  
• 
Always check your local building regulations before carrying out any new construction 
or major remodelling. The regulations are intended to avoid safety hazards and 
should be observed - they should not be considered obstructions to be circumvented.  
• 
Always check ladders and steps before use, make sure the rungs and sides are 
undamaged.  
• 
Always check the security of a ladder or set of steps before you start to climb.  
• 
Always be aware and alert!  
 

Don'ts 
• 
Never wear loose clothing, hanging hair or jewellery when using power tools.  
• 
Never try to use a tool (especially a power tool) for any task it was not designed to do.  
• 
Never work with power tools when you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs or 
are tired. If in doubt - don't. Any of these factors can impair judgement of your ability, 
your physical state and general safety aspects - if always better to delay a job than 
risk serious injury.  
• 
Never use a power tool which is damaged in any way (case, switch or cable etc.). If it 
starts to make an odd noise or emit smells - stop and investigate.  
• 
Never cut small, loose pieces of wood, metal or other material using a power tool - 
small off-cuts which you cannot hold or secure, will tend to fly off with potential for 
injury.  
• 
Never change a drill bit, router cutter or saw blade or make any adjustment to a 
'cutting' power tool - until the power cable has been unplugged. Do not rely only upon 
the switch on the tool or outlet.  
• 
Never use power tools is you are at risk of overbalancing, reposition any ladder, 
scaffold etc. to make the job comfortable.  
• 
Never work with blunt tools (saws, drill bits, cutters etc.). Sharpen the tools yourself, 
have them sharpened, or throw them away and use a new tool.  
• 
Never use a power tool on a workpiece which is not firmly secured.  
• 
Never drill or cut 'blind' into a surface before checking the possible location of 
electrical cables or pipework.  
• 
Never saw a large workpiece unless it is well supported both sides of the cut or there 
is someone else to support the off-cut.  
• 
Never saw a workpiece supported on any part of your body (or anyone else's body !).  
• 
Never carry sharp tools in your pocket. If you want to carry such tools, use a special-
purpose tool belt.  
• 
Never relay on your weight to stabilise a ladder or mobile steps, if necessary get 
someone to stand at the bottom or use stabilisers.  
• 
Never overreach when working on a ladder or steps, always re-position the 
ladder/steps.
