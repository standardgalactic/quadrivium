Introduction
Year after year, Italy tops tourist destination lists. Year after year, we
keep having the times of our lives in spite of the crowds. Really. And
what’s not to like? The food is perfect, the people are welcoming and
friendly, the climate is pleasant, and there is art everywhere!
Modern tourism started back in the 18th century, when the literati 
and aristocrats bent on learning began traveling through Europe to
explore the ruins of ancient Greek and Roman sites as well as to admire
the rich artistic production of the Renaissance. In the 19th century,
Americans made taking the Grand Tour — the classic, months-long
European tour enjoyed by the rich and satirized by Mark Twain in The
Innocents Abroad — a rite of passage for the well-heeled. Anyone who
has seen a Merchant Ivory film (A Room with a View, for one) knows that
Italy was among the most popular stops on the Grand Tour. Today, the
country is still a huge destination for both cultural and religious pilgrim-
ages. Italy retains an almost mythical status in the minds of many for its
fantastic range of natural and cultural attractions. The “problem” with
visiting Italy is also this country’s major appeal: It’s totally saturated
with things to see and do (and eat and drink, too). The cultural renais-
sance initiated in the late 1990s has not yet given signs of abating. Old
attractions are being made more tourist-friendly and new ones are open-
ing up; brand-new hotels and restaurants are popping up throughout 
the country; and English-speaking staff and signs are becoming more
common. Yes, things keep improving for tourists here, and we’re sure
you’ll have the time of your life traveling through Italy with us!
About This Book
With a history stretching from the dawn of time and artwork to match,
Italy definitely offers too much to see in one trip, unless you’re planning
a six-month-long visit. Fortunately, we’ve combed the country to find 
the best deals and things to see and do. Whether you’re a first-timer or
making a repeat visit to see sights you missed the first go-round, you’ll
find something for you in Italy For Dummies, 5th Edition.
Unlike some travel guides that read more like a phonebook-style direc-
tory listing everything and anything, this book cuts to the chase. It’s
designed so that you can quickly look up and immediately find the infor-
mation you need. This means that you don’t have to read the whole
thing from page one, but can open it at any point and delve into the sub-
ject at hand.

Conventions Used in This Book
The structure of this book is nonlinear: In other words, you can look up
just the things you’re interested in without having to read whole chap-
ters. To help you find information quickly and easily, we use a number of
visual signs (icons) positioned at the margin (see “Icons Used in This
Book,” later in this chapter).
We have included lists of hotels, restaurants, and attractions, and for
each we provide our frank evaluation. Hotels are divided into two cate-
gories — our personal favorites and those that don’t quite make our pre-
ferred list but still get a hearty seal of approval. Don’t be shy about
considering these “runner-up” hotels if you’re unable to get a room at
one of our favorites, or if your preferences differ from ours — they are
still excellent choices with above-average amenities and services.
We use this series of abbreviations for credit cards in our hotel and
restaurant reviews:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
Note that Discover is not listed. The Discover Card is unknown in Italy,
so it’s a good idea to carry one or more of the big three — American
Express, Visa, or MasterCard.
We also include some general pricing information to help you decide
where to unpack your bags or grab a bite. We use a dollar-sign system 
to show the price range for one night in a hotel (in a double-occupancy
room) or a full meal at a restaurant (including pasta or appetizer, main
dish, side dish, and dessert, but no beverages). (Note that within the
restaurant listing info, we give you the price range of just the main
course, referred to as secondi.) See Chapter 8 for a detailed chart 
telling you exactly what to expect in each hotel category. Here are 
the price categories:
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant
$
Up to 140€ ($224)
Up to 40€ ($64)
$$
141€–230€ ($226–$368)
41€–55€ ($66–$88)
$$$
231€–350€ ($370–$560)
56€–70€ ($90–$112)
$$$$
More than 350€ (over $560)
71€ and up ($114 and up)

Prices are given in euro, followed by the U.S. dollar conversion; the
exchange rate used is 1€ = $1.60. Note, however, that establishments
can change prices without notice and exchange rates may vary.
Another thing you will find attached to each listing is contact informa-
tion. Web sites are listed whenever possible. As for telephone numbers,
don’t be surprised if you see % 0743-220320 right near % 055-290832.
The number of digits in Italian phone numbers is not standardized as it
is in the United States. Area codes can have 2, 3, or 4 digits; the rest of
the number can have as few as 4 or as many as 8 digits.
For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map,
a page reference is provided in the listing information. If a hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction is outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-way area,
it may not be mapped.
Foolish Assumptions
We’ve made some assumptions about you and what your needs may be
as a traveler. Here’s what we assume:
 You may be wondering whether to take a trip to Italy and how to
plan for it. You may be a first-time visitor to Italy.
 You may be an experienced traveler who doesn’t have a ton of time
to plan your trip or to spend in Italy after you get there. You want
expert advice on how to maximize your time and enjoy a hassle-
free trip.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides every bit of information
available about Italy. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses
on the places that will give you the best or most unique experience
in Italy.
If you fit any of these criteria, then Italy For Dummies, 5th Edition, pro-
vides the information you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
The book has eight parts, plus two appendixes. Each can be read inde-
pendently if you want to zero in on a particular area or issue.
Part I: Introducing Italy
The first part is where you find in-depth information on Italy, from our
rundown of the best it has to offer (Chapter 1) to details on its history,
culture, people, architecture, and cuisine (Chapter 2). You also find cli-
mate information and a calendar of special events (Chapter 3), plus our
suggested itineraries (Chapter 4).
Introduction 3

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy
Here we give you our best tips on trip planning: from budgeting — with
advice on where to save money and where not to (Chapter 5) — to figuring
out the best ways to get here from abroad (Chapter 6) and to travel from
one destination to another within Italy (Chapter 7). We also describe hotel
standards and practices (Chapter 8) and address the special concerns of
families, seniors, students, and gays and lesbians (Chapter 9). We address
all other necessary details — from getting your passport to thinking about
your health — in Chapter 10.
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome
This eternally lively city, Italy’s capital, is as contemporary as it is ancient,
a living ruin still under construction. This section includes our best tips
on hotels and restaurants (Chapter 11), as well as a tour of this wonderful
maze of ancient and modern treasures (Chapter 12).
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria
Tuscany and Umbria are dotted with historic and picturesque towns.
Florence’s still brilliant Renaissance heritage (Chapter 13) often over-
shadows neighboring towns, such as Pisa and Lucca (Chapter 14), which
are also repositories of art and culture. You find more of our Tuscan and
Umbrian picks in Chapter 15.
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana
You will fall for Venice’s mysterious and lovely villa-crowded islands that
seem to float upon the water. But to avoid the city’s pitfalls and stay
within your budget, follow our tips in Chapter 16. We explore the best of
the nearby Pianura Padana (including Verona and Milan) in Chapter 17.
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast
This corner of Italy is packed with diversity and contrast — as well as an
immense art endowment. Naples is a fascinating hive of activity as well as
a treasure-trove of history and art (Chapter 18). It is surrounded by some
of the world’s greatest archaeological areas: Pompeii, Herculaneum, and
the Campi Flegrei (Chapter 19). A short distance to the south is the splen-
did Sorrento Peninsula, with the mythical isle of Capri and the Amalfi
Coast (Chapter 20).
Part VII: Sicily
A stone’s throw from Africa and hundreds of miles from the Alps, the
island of Sicily seems at once most intensely “Italian” and strangely dif-
ferent. Nowhere is the mix of cultures more dazzling than in the region’s
capital, Palermo (Chapter 21). And in no place is the presence of the

past as ghostly as at the Greek temples of Agrigento, Selinunte, and
Segesta, or as fascinating as in Taormina, Piazza Armerina, Catania, 
and Syracuse (Chapter 22).
Part VIII: The Part of Tens
Here we’ve squeezed in some extra info we think you’ll find useful:
Italian expressions worth knowing (Chapter 23) and our favorite Italian
artists (Chapter 24).
Appendixes A and B
Go to Appendix A to find Quick Concierge, an A-to-Z directory that gives
you the facts you need to know, such as how the telephone system
works and what to expect at Customs. We also provide a list of toll-free
phone numbers and Web sites for airlines, hotels, and car-rental agen-
cies serving Italy, plus sources for additional tourist information. In
Appendix B, you find a glossary of useful architecture and menu terms.
Icons Used in This Book
As you have already seen, we use icons throughout this book as sign-
posts and flags for facts and information of a particular nature or inter-
est. Following are the five types of icons:
This icon highlights money-saving tips and/or great deals.
This icon highlights the best the destination has to offer in all categories —
hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and nightlife.
This icon gives you a heads up on annoying or potentially dangerous sit-
uations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, rip-offs, and other
things to beware of.
This icon highlights places that are particularly hospitable to children or
people traveling with kids. In restaurant listings, it means highchairs and
mezza porzione (half portions) are on offer; in hotels, it indicates cribs,
extra beds, or triples and quads are available. We also mention if other
amenities suitable for children — a play area, garden, pool, baby sitting —
are provided.
This icon points out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule
your time.
Introduction 5

Where to Go from Here
Now you can dig in wherever you want. The next chapter highlights the
best of Italy, from museums to hotels to intangibles (experiences you
may not want to miss). If you already have an itinerary in mind, you can
jump ahead to the ins and outs of finding a flight and making a budget;
or you can browse through city destinations you may want to visit. And
if you’ve already traveled to Italy once or a score of times, you are still
sure to find something here you haven’t seen.

Introducing Italy

In this part . . .
T
his is where we get you excited about your trip before
you go and satisfy your curiosity about this Italian world
you have decided to discover. We will help you decide when
and exactly where to go. We’ll tell you what sort of weather 
to expect, where you are likely to have to deal with tourist
hordes, and where, instead, you can relax in relative solitude
off the beaten path. In this part, we sort through your
options, showing the advantages and drawbacks of each
choice and mentioning special considerations.
In Chapter 1, we highlight what we consider the best of 
Italy, from churches to restaurants to travel experiences. In
Chapter 2, we give more information on Italy’s history and
culture, including the regional cuisine and local wines. In
Chapter 3, we describe the best seasons in which to travel
and also provide a calendar of the most important festivals
and events. Finally, in case you don’t want to plan your own
trip or are looking for some ideas, we list four great itineraries
in Chapter 4.

taly’s variety will satisfy all sorts of visitors. Art lovers flock to its
great museums and wonderfully decorated churches and palaces, the
faithful make pilgrimages to the Vatican, and gourmands devour its glori-
ous cuisines. In Italy For Dummies, 5th Edition, we give you our vision of
the best Italy has to offer. Here’s a taste of what’s ahead:
The Best Museums
Art is everywhere in Italy, and museums, of course, enjoy the advantage
of concentration. If your itinerary takes you to any of the following
cities, don’t miss our selections below — even if you are not a serious
museum-goer.
 You need several days if you want to see the whole art collection of
the Vatican Museums in Rome. Not only does this include dozens
of rooms dedicated to painting and sculpture, but it’s also home to
the Sistine Chapel, decorated with Michelangelo’s frescoes — the
most famous artwork in all of Italy, and, after the Mona Lisa, proba-
bly the most famous single artwork in the world. Don’t forget your
binoculars. See Chapter 12.
 Also in Rome, the Borghese Gallery is small, but houses one of 
the best art collections in the world. We especially love it for its
Caravaggio paintings and breathtaking Bernini sculptures. See
Chapter 12.
 The National Roman Museum in Rome’s Palazzo Massimo alle
Terme holds an astounding collection of ancient Roman artifacts,
including unique mosaics and frescoes of rare beauty (entire rooms
of Roman villas are reconstructed!). See Chapter 12.

 Florence’s Galleria degli Uffizi is a required stop on any Italian itin-
erary for its superb pageant of Renaissance art. Only between the
covers of a book could you find so many Italian masterpieces in
one place. See Chapter 13.
 The Gallerie dell’Accademia in Venice houses the greatest collec-
tion of Venetian painting in the world, from the incandescent works
of Bellini to monumental pieces by Tintoretto and Veronese. See
Chapter 16.
 Often overlooked by tourists who go to Milan principally for the
excellent shopping, the Brera is a beautiful 17th-century palace
that contains the foremost painting gallery in northern Italy. The
collection of the Pinacoteca stretches from the 15th to the 20th
century, including unique masterpieces. See Chapter 17.
 The Museo di Capodimonte houses its huge painting collection —
the best in southern Italy — in an enormous palace high above
Naples and surrounded by a beautiful park. See Chapter 18.
 The Archaeological Museum, also in Naples, is Italy’s foremost
museum of the art of antiquity. The splendid collection includes
treasures of Pompeii that were removed from the buried city for
safekeeping. See Chapter 18.
The Best Churches
Over the ages, churches in Italy have been decorated with the best
works of art and built according to the designs of the greatest architects.
Here are our absolute favorites from among the thousands of options.
 St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome is justly the most famous church in a
country filled with magnificent churches. Its majestic colonnade
and soaring dome create a symbol of Rome as well as of the
Catholic Church; inside are unique art treasures that include
Michelangelo’s Pietà. See Chapter 12.
 Among Italian churches, Florence’s Duomo, with Brunelleschi’s 
red-tiled dome soaring over it, is second in size only to St. Peter’s
Basilica. This architectural masterpiece is also known for its art-
works, bell tower, and the famous doors of the nearby baptistery.
See Chapter 13.
 Venice’s Basilica di San Marco is as dreamlike and magical as the
rest of the city. Decorated inside with 3,717 sq. m (40,000 sq. ft.) 
of gilded mosaics, it contains a host of marvels and has been the
focus of the piazza that bears its name since the 11th century. See
Chapter 16.
 The Scrovegni Chapel in Padua is small, but it is completely cov-
ered with frescos by Giotto and takes a special place among our
favorites. See Chapter 17.
Part I: Introducing Italy 
10

 The Duomo of Milan is a fabulous example of Italian Gothic archi-
tecture that took half a millennium to build. With its 135 towers, it
may look like a whimsical construction — and to some, it resem-
bles a sand castle. See Chapter 17.
 The churches of Naples are many and splendid, but if you have
time for just one, make it the Duomo. It’s actually three churches in
one, from the paleo-Christian Santa Restituta (with the oldest west-
ern baptistery in the world) to the late baroque Cappella di San
Gennaro. Don’t miss the splendid array of artwork here. See
Chapter 18.
 The Duomo di Monreale, located on a hill dominating Palermo, is a
12th-century Romanesque church whose austere exterior makes
the 5,111 sq. m (55,000 sq. ft.) of Byzantine mosaics inside even
more awe-inspiring. See Chapter 21.
The Best Ruins and Archaeological Areas
Say “Italy,” and most people think of the ancient Romans. The country,
and especially its southern half, is chock-full of archaeological remains —
mostly Roman, but also Greek, including a number of the world’s best.
Here are our favorites.
 Rome’s symbol and most famous ruin, the Colosseum, is still majes-
tic even after centuries of decay. See for yourself where the Romans
watched “sports” (read: fights to the death). Nearby are the archae-
ological areas of the Roman Forum and the Palatine Hill, and of
the Imperial Forums; together they were the administrative and
business center of ancient Rome. See Chapter 12.
 In the small town of Verona lies a great Roman Amphitheater,
second only to the Colosseum in its state of preservation. Used as 
a performance hall for decades, it is still a living ruin, with a full
season of concerts and opera. See Chapter 17.
 Who hasn’t heard of Pompeii? The city — buried whole by Mount
Vesuvius’s A.D. 79 eruption — was an extremely wealthy resort
during Roman times, famous for the beauty of its abodes; its fres-
coes are among the best in the world. See Chapter 19.
 Less famous than Pompeii is Herculaneum, a smaller town also
buried by Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. It was a VIP resort in Roman
times and remains a superb archaeological site today; many houses
still have their second story preserved. See Chapter 19.
 The glorious Greek temples of Paestum lie out of the way — not far
from Salerno, south of the Amalfi Coast — and are therefore often
overlooked by tourists in a hurry. Try not to miss them if you’re in
the area. See Chapter 20.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Italy 11

 In the suburbs of Piazza Armerina in Sicily, the ruins of the Ancient
Roman Villa del Casale, are a somewhat unlikely treat with their
treasure trove of unique mosaics only steps from the ugly pilings 
of the highway. See Chapter 22.
 The Valley of the Temples at Agrigento in Sicily is the most scenic
archaeological site in Italy. A series of majestic Greek temples domi-
nated the colony founded in the sixth century B.C. The ruins stand
on their own in a dramatic, unspoiled landscape, and include one of
the largest temples of antiquity, the Temple of Jupiter, which was
over 30m (110 ft.) tall. See Chapter 22.
The Best Luxury Hotels
Okay, so maybe you can’t afford to stay in luxury hotels every night . . .
but if you want to splurge, then pick one of our favorite dream places for
a special night — it will be a cherished memory for the rest of your life.
 In Rome, the Hotel Hassler holds its own against all the competi-
tion, thanks to its incomparably romantic setting and unique style.
See Chapter 11.
 With its stylish yet welcoming interior and special children’s pro-
grams, the Hotel Savoy tops our list in Florence. See Chapter 13.
 Staying at the San Clemente Palace in Venice will let you experi-
ence the city’s grandeur in a manner that hasn’t been topped since
the 18th century. See Chapter 16.
 Housed in a former 15th-century convent, the Four Seasons hotel
in Milan will overwhelm you with its charm and its perfect location.
See Chapter 17.
 In Naples, the distinct and elegant Grand Hotel Vesuvio has won us
over with its views, service, and overall style. See Chapter 18.
 The Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria in Sorrento is grand, indeed,
and is the place to stay in town for pampering in sheer elegance
and true taste. See Chapter 20.
 Capri is a dream island — and the Capri Palace in Anacapri is the
hotel to match, beginning with its ideal perch at the top of the
island. See Chapter 20.
 Nested in the most beautiful stretch of Italy’s coast, the Hotel San
Pietro in Positano is a jewel that is approaching perfection. See
Chapter 20.
 In Palermo, bask in luxury as well as art history at the Grand Hotel
Villa Igiea, where you are surrounded by some of the most
acclaimed examples of Sicilian Liberty style. See Chapter 22.
Part I: Introducing Italy 
12

 Sicily has captured our hearts, and the San Domenico Palace and
the Grand Hotel Timeo in Taormina will take yours. A stay at either
hotel is a feast for the senses. See Chapter 22.
The Best Gourmet Restaurants
Italians take food very seriously. Dining in one of the country’s best
restaurants is like a near-mystical experience: Not only is the food
superlative, but nothing that surrounds you will be less than perfect,
from your chair down to your napkin. Foodie or not, you won’t eat in
one of the following restaurants every day — few people could afford to
do so — but do choose one of these places for a very special meal.
 Gourmets in the know in Rome dine at Il Convivio Troiani; this ele-
gant restaurant is sure to be one of your best dining experiences in
Italy. See Chapter 11.
 For fantastic views over the Eternal City, with wonderful food to
match, we recommend La Pergola of the Rome Cavalieri Hilton 
and Imago of the Hotel Hassler. The pricey tabs will fade in your
memory while their unique romantic setting will stay vibrant. See
Chapter 11.
 Don’t miss Cibrèo if you’re visiting Florence. The restaurant’s cre-
ative chef puts a unique spin on the best of Tuscan cuisine. You
also get to taste a huge variety of the region’s best wines. See
Chapter 13.
 Hidden away from the main tourist haunts, yet within walking dis-
tance from San Polo, Osteria da Fiore in Venice is an address for
connoisseurs. Do not miss it if you want to discover the best of
Venetian cuisine. See Chapter 16.
 Whether you’re a fan of risotto or not, visit CraccoPeck in Milan.
Gourmands flock to this elegant restaurant just a few steps from
the Duomo, as it’s simply the best in the city. See Chapter 17.
 Il Desco in Verona is not only a great chef’s restaurant, but also a
very pleasant place where you feel welcome and taken care of in a
wonderfully friendly way. Many foodies will tell you this is the best
restaurant in Italy. See Chapter 17.
 Naples is home to many of our favorite restaurants, but two of
them are truly special, not only for the quality of their cuisine but
also for their settings: George’s of the Grand Hotel Parker and La
Terrazza dei Barbanti of the Hotel San Francesco al Monte. See
Chapter 18.
 The San Pietro in Positano — inside the hotel of the same name —
is one of the best and most beautiful places to dine on this equally
beautiful stretch of coast. See Chapter 20.

The Best Travel Experiences
If you love Italy, it will reward you with your own unforgettable and
unpredictable experiences. Below is a small selection of our own
favorites.
 The Pantheon is the most perfectly preserved building of ancient
Rome. Built in 27 B.C., it was spared the looting that befell other
Roman structures because it had been turned into a Christian
church. It doesn’t feel like a church, however. From its soaring
dome (with a round opening through which you see the Roman
sky) to its marble pavement, it is a stunning, airy space where you
can literally walk through antiquity. See Chapter 12.
 Siena’s Palio delle Contrade is more than a horse race: It’s a
grudge match between the city’s neighborhoods that’s been going
on for hundreds of years. It’s still carried out with all the pomp, cer-
emony, and costumes of Renaissance Siena. The race (quite danger-
ous) is held in the main square of the town — which is filled with
dirt for the occasion. Imagine the Kentucky Derby being held in
Times Square. See Chapter 15.
 Taking a gondola ride through Venice may be expensive and
“touristy,” but — especially at dusk — it is an enchanting experi-
ence. You must see for yourself the water shimmering with reflec-
tions, the imposing yet whimsical Venetian architecture, and the
stillness and sheer unbelievability of it all. See Chapter 16.
 Crossing the Gulf of Naples coming from Capri or Sorrento, and
entering Naples at sunset, with Mount Vesuvio in the background
and the city’s lights starting to come up in front of you, is truly
magic: You now understand the old adage, “See Naples and die.”
See Chapter 18.
 Walking the streets of Pompeii is an awe-inspiring experience.
Buried beneath volcanic ash by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in
A.D. 79, Pompeii was a flourishing Roman town caught in amber.
Even corpses were turned into human statues. See Chapter 19.
 The Teatro Greco-Romano (Greco-Roman Theater) at Taormina in
Sicily would be special enough as the best-preserved antique the-
ater in Italy, where plays were staged starting in the third century
B.C. But to see a play performed here today is truly amazing. See
Chapter 22.
The Best Traditional Italian Souvenirs
Although you wouldn’t expect to find “ethnic” gifts in Italy, there is a
small selection of high-quality handcrafted goods that have been tradi-
tionally produced in Italy for centuries. They make splendid gifts.
Part I: Introducing Italy 
14

 The beautiful, extensive selection of marbled paper goods at Giulio
Giannini & Figlio in Florence are worth checking out; they make
perfect gifts and come in many price levels. See Chapter 13. You
can also find a large selection of marbleized paper at Piazzesi in
Venice. See Chapter 16.
 Invest in some Murano glass artwork or find smaller blown-glass
gift items. If it’s authentic Murano, then even the most inexpensive
item will appreciate in value. See Chapter 16.
 In Naples, select a set of hand-modeled figurines for the presepio
(crèche) for someone who will appreciate them, or start your own
collection. See Chapter 18.
 Make a gift of a beautiful cameo jewel, the finely carved coral and
shells that have been the pride of Torre del Greco (near Naples)
since antiquity. See Chapter 18.
 Check out the colorful hand-painted porcelain — dinnerware,
pitchers, tiles, vases — traditionally produced according to local
historical patterns in Deruta, near Perugia (see Chapter 15); in
Vietri, on the Costiera Amalfitana (see Chapter 20); and in the
Sicilian towns of Caltagirone, Santo Stefano, and Sciacca (see
Chapter 22).
 And, of course, take your pick of fashion accessories — scarves,
leather gloves, handbags, wallets, watches, sunglasses — from the
many local designers in Rome, Florence, Milan, Naples, Capri, and
Positano. See Chapters 12, 13, 17, 18, and 20.

ultifarious Italian culture has intrigued visitors for centuries, ever
since the first travel books were published in the 1800s. With the
development of modern tourism in the 19th century, Italy became a des-
tination of choice and has remained so ever since. In this chapter, we
have collected the highlights of Italian culture so that you may have a
richer, more informed traveling experience.
History 101: The Main Events
If Mesopotamia is the cradle of civilization, then Italy is the cradle of
Western culture. In the ancient world, Italy was the center of an empire
that covered all of western Europe and much of northern Africa and the
Middle East. The Romans left behind towns, roads, and aqueducts which
are in large part still used today. The principles of Roman (and Greek)
civilization are the bedrock of modern Western values and institutions.
Summarizing Italy’s history in anything less than a book-length study is
bound to leave huge gaps, but here goes.
Around 1000 B.C., several peoples inhabited Italy, among them the
Villanova Italic tribe, which settled in the region of Rome, and the
Etruscans, a people probably originally from Asia Minor, who were
famed for their seafaring, gold and metal work, and trading. The
Etruscans had already developed a sophisticated culture in Tuscany and
Umbria when Rome was still a collection of shepherd’s huts and the first
Greek colonies were just putting in an appearance in the south of the
peninsula. As the Etruscans expanded southward, their culture had a
huge impact on Rome — they gave the city its name, drained the
swamps, built sewers, and introduced writing. Near the beginning of the
fifth century B.C., however, the local populations began striving for inde-
pendence. Weakened by their struggles with the Greeks who were colo-
nizing southern Italy, the Etruscans lost their power over Rome — and

the Roman Republic was subsequently founded in 509 B.C., when the last
of Rome’s kings was overthrown.
The Roman Republic was headed by two consuls and the senate, all
controlled by the upper or patrician (aristocratic) class. The plebeians
(working class) later obtained their own council and were represented
by tribunes. Rome’s power grew, and the city started gaining control
first over the Italian peninsula and then gradually over all western
Europe and the Mediterranean. Rome showed its might in decades of
bloody war against the city of Carthage, whose empire spread across
North Africa and into Spain. Known as the Punic Wars, these conflicts
began in 264 B.C. It took the Carthaginian general Hannibal six months to
make the famous march with his elephants over the Alps to attack the
Romans in 218 B.C., which marked the start of the Second Punic War. His
army inflicted crushing defeats on the Roman armies, but eventually the
Punic Wars ended with the Romans literally erasing Carthage from the
map in 146 B.C. The door was then open for Rome to spread its influence
across the Mediterranean. Although the Romans have been called the
“Prussians of the ancient world” for their militarism, they also strove to
bring civil peace and economic development. Rome ruled its provinces
through governors and allowed subject countries to retain their local
governments and customs — though betrayal of Rome was brutally
avenged. The republic became fantastically rich, and Hellenic and
Eastern art, wealth, and cultural influences flowed into Rome and Italy.
The end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire
arrived largely through the antagonism of two great generals, Pompey
and Julius Caesar, who became a tyrant after his defeat of Pompey.
Following Caesar’s murder on the Ides of March in 44 B.C., civil war
ensued and was won by Caesar’s grandnephew and adopted son,
Octavian, who became Rome’s first emperor, Caesar Augustus. His
regime began a period of peace and development and turned Rome into
a glowing marble city the likes of which the world had never seen. Rome
became the cultural beacon for an empire that extended from the
Caspian Sea to Scotland. Augustus was followed by a string of mostly
debauched and even insane rulers: Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius (a par-
tial exception, even though his third wife, Nero’s mother, was also his
niece), and Nero. However, in the second century, a string of “good”
emperors brought order, stable succession, and civility to the state. They
were Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and the philosopher-
emperor Marcus Aurelius. With the assassination of Commodus, Marcus
Aurelius’s son, in the year 192, the empire plunged once more into
chaos. A period beleaguered by war, plague, barbarian invasions, and
inflation spelled the beginning of the bitter end.
When Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity and founded
Constantinople (today’s Istanbul) in A.D. 330, Rome’s wealth shifted east.
The western empire crumbled under barbarian pressure: The Goths
sacked Rome in A.D. 410; the Huns came next under Attila, and were 
followed by the Vandals of North Africa. In A.D. 476, the German chief

Italy is divided between Longobards (ruling northern Italy, Tuscany, 
centuries A.D. and part of southern Italy) and Byzantines (ruling Sicily, Rome, and
some coastal towns such as Venice and Bari).
A.D. 756

nizes the pope’s right to his own state and territory, in exchange for
being crowned king by the pope. The Vatican State formally begins.
A.D. 800
Charlemagne crowned emperor in St. Peter’s Basilica by Pope Leo III.
He establishes a kingdom of Italy as part of his new empire, but his
power on the peninsula is weak. The Byzantines resist.
9th–10th 
Saracens (Muslim Turks) attack from their strongholds in southern 
centuries
Italy. Muslim Arabs colonize Sicily. Maritime republics — Amalfi, Pisa,
Genoa, and Venice — start gaining power.
1030
Normans take over southern Italy from Byzantines and Arabs; will rule
first Sicily and then the whole south of the peninsula up to Naples. Their
reign will pass to the Swabian dynasty in 1194, the Angevins in 1266,
and the Aragonese dynasty in 1442.

11th–13th 
Comuni — city-states — take over control in what had been the 
centuries
Longobard reign; the four maritime republics rule over the sea.
Commerce flourishes.
14th century Italian Renaissance begins: The culture of antiquity is rediscovered;
great achievements in the arts and ideas will then spread to the rest of
Europe. The city-states are well established. The papacy moves to
Avignon, France, in 1309; it will not be back until 1377.
1542
The Inquisition begins; Naples will be the only town in the Catholic
world to refuse it and resist.
1707
Austrian Habsburgs take over the southern kingdom; they will have to
give it up to the Bourbons in 1734. They will keep northern Italy, how-
ever.
1798
Napoleon invades Italy, creating two republics; they will fall with him
in 1815. Papacy is restored in central Italy; Habsburgs and Bourbons
share the rest of the peninsula.
1860
Garibaldi conquers southern Italy and pushes through the Marches
(belonging to the Holy See); the new Kingdom of Italy is proclaimed. The
Austrians are chased from Venice, their last stronghold in Italy, in 1866.
Rome is taken in 1870; it will be proclaimed capital of the kingdom in
1871.
1915–1918
Italy participates in World War I beside France and the United Kingdom;
650,000 Italians die.
1922
After the “march on Rome,” Benito Mussolini obtains from the king the
right to form a new government. He will rapidly transform it into a dic-
tatorship. The fascist era begins.

except its churches and the territory of the Vatican.
1940
Italy enters World War II on the side of Germany.
1943
Allied troops land in Sicily, welcomed by the locals. The Italian king
signs the armistice and has Mussolini arrested. The Germans occupy
the country, countered by the population which, with the help of the
Allies, will free southern Italy up to Naples. Rome, occupied by the
Germans in spite of the resistance of Italian troops, is later heavily bom-
barded by the Allies. The Italian Resistance begins.
1944
Rome is liberated by the Allies on June 4. Milan will have to wait until
April 1945. The Italian Republic is officially established in 1946, after a
referendum decided against the monarchy. The new constitution is
signed in 1948.
1957
Italy is a cofounder of the European Community.

Odoacer deposed the western Roman emperor, in effect signaling the
end of the once invincible Roman Empire.
Italy was fought over by the Goths, Byzantines, and Longobards. In 552,
the Byzantines chased the Goths from Rome and northern Italy, but 
their power was weak and they could not resist the pressure of the
Longobards, who took over much of the peninsula except for Rome,
Sicily, and some coastal towns.
As Rome became the seat of the Catholic church, Rome and Italy
became a pilgrimage site for believers from the whole Western world.
The French king Charlemagne tried to revive the western empire and, 
in A.D. 800, was crowned by the pope as the head of the Holy Roman
Empire. His power over the kingdom of Italy lasted only during his life-
time (city-states started developing right after his death), but the system
he established profoundly affected Italy’s history during the Middle Ages
and Renaissance. The German emperor was elected by the German
princes, but only the pope could crown him Holy Roman Emperor. For
the next 1,000 years, Italian politics were defined by the struggle among
the Holy Roman Emperor (who was German), the pope, Spain, and
France (aspiring to the imperial crown).
In the 13th century, Italy was the crossroads of the Mediterranean. A
banking and commercial culture was based on the great seafaring
empires of Venice and Genoa, as well as Amalfi, Pisa, and land-based
but powerful Florence; Milan and other smaller city-states dominated
the rest of Italy. This economic well-being and the circulation of ideas
generated by trade led to the beginning of the Renaissance in the 14th
century. This movement, which was to later inform all of Europe, was
above all the rediscovery of classical learning and culture, which in turn
led to an explosion of creativity, art, and exploration. The new philoso-
phy of humanism promoted the dignity and goodness of the human indi-
vidual and developing secularism, in contrast with the Middle Ages’
emphasis on human sinfulness and doctrinal orthodoxy.
Only in the south and in Sicily, where the Normans (Viking descendants)
founded a kingdom in the 11th century, did medieval feudalism take
root. Later, the Spanish rulers used feudalism for their own political
aims and induced it to hang on — one of the causes of north–south cul-
tural and economic disparities that still persist.
Especially starting in the 15th century, artists and scholars from all over
the Western world were drawn to Italy’s burgeoning centers of art and
learning, which disseminated a new way of thinking — humanism — 
to the rest of Europe. Unfortunately, first the Inquisition, and then the
power struggle between Spain, France, and Germany, put an end to the
Renaissance. City-states like Florence and Siena sought the help of those
powerful larger states in their local wars, thus inviting foreign interven-
tion in Italy. The treaty of 1559 that acknowledged Spanish claims in Italy
was the start of a 250-year decline. The mercantile empires and the city-
states waned, and between them the Spanish and the popes imposed a

20

reactionary and stultifying rule that was only relieved with the arrival of
Napoleon and revolutionary ideas.
The end of the Napoleonic era brought back reactionary regimes, with
Austria dominating in northern Italy, and Spain in southern Italy, but the
Risorgimento (“resurgence”) began to gain momentum. Led by powerful
political figures such as Mazzini and Garibaldi, the movement worked for
the unification of Italy. Secret societies like the Carbonari were born.
The radical Giuseppe Mazzini favored an Italian republic, but unification
eventually came about by the creation of a liberal state formed around
the house of Savoy, rulers of Piedmont and Sardinia. The revolutionary
Giuseppe Garibaldi threw his weight and military genius behind the lib-
eral plan. After Garibaldi conquered the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies,
Umbria and Marche were annexed to Sardinia, and the Kingdom of 
Italy was proclaimed in 1861. Veneto was obtained in 1866 and Rome
finally wrested from Papal-French control in 1870, thus completing the
unification.
Between 1870 and World War I, Italy saw massive emigration to the United
States and Argentina. The country was tempted by territorial promises 
to join the Allies in 1915 (mainly in order to get Venice back from the
Austrians), and 650,000 Italians lost their lives. After World War I, discon-
tent and economic depression helped Mussolini rise to power. Mussolini’s
imperialist adventures abroad were matched by repression at home, and
his alliance with the Nazis was disastrous. Italians turned against him in
1943 and then continued in World War II on the Allied side while suffering
under German occupation.
Italy rebuilt itself after the war and became a modern democratic state.
It joined in the creation of the European Community in 1957 and has
been a promoter of European unification ever since. Today, unemploy-
ment is a persistent problem, and many Italians — even those engaged
in such professions as law, academics, and architecture — work for free
for years just to get a foot on the employment ladder. Corruption has
also been a nagging problem, but in the 1990s, a series of scandals and
dramatic trials of key Mafia leaders led to a major housecleaning and the
proclamation of the “new Italy.” The country has received massive
influxes of immigrants and refugees in recent years, and the long-term
effects of these demographic changes are a great unknown.
Architecture: From Ruins to Rococo
Italy offers a compendium of architectural styles — Roman and Greek,
Romanesque, medieval, Gothic, Renaissance, baroque, rococo, futurist,
and contemporary. With its foot as far south as Africa and its head in the
Alps, the peninsula has been a corridor for influences passing back and
forth. This is perhaps most obvious in Sicily, with its mixture of Arab and
Norman architecture, but almost any church or palace (especially those
like Milan’s Duomo, which took 500 years to build) will show traces of
more than one style.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Italy 21

Sicily’s temples at Segesta and Agrigento (the famous “valley of temples”)
are examples of the architecture brought to Italy from Greece by colonists.
These temples date from the fifth and sixth centuries B.C. and display the
Doric style (most easily spotted in the simple rectilinear capitals at the
tops of columns). Roman architecture absorbed this early style as well 
as later Greek developments, such as the Ionic capital (like a scroll) and
the Corinthian (the most ornate capital, decorated with a profusion of
leaves). The Colosseum in Rome demonstrates all three styles or “orders.”
Byzantine style dominates the few examples of paleo-Christian architec-
ture left — mostly churches. Of the country’s Christian-era churches, the
earliest to be found are in the Romanesque style, which, as its name
suggests, drew inspiration from Roman architecture — particularly the
use of the arch. Some people find the Romanesque stolid, while to us it
has an appealing simplicity (especially in comparison with some later
gaudy developments in church architecture) that makes it our favorite
architectural style. Spoleto has several Romanesque churches, including
its beautiful Duomo.
Influence from northern Europe brought to Italy the Gothic style, known
for its soaring towers and the flying buttresses that support the building.
Not surprisingly, Italy’s foremost example of Gothic architecture is in
Milan — its famous Duomo — while the style is little represented farther
south, and when used it is intermingled with other artistic influences,
such as in Rome’s only Gothic church, Santa Maria Sopra Minerva.
The architecture of Tuscany and Umbria is famous for its alternating
striations of colored marble — black, white, pink, or green. This charac-
teristic element can be found in churches considered Gothic, as in the
Duomo of Siena, but also in Renaissance masterpieces like the Duomo
of Florence. The Renaissance style stressed proportion and balance,
and avoided some of the higgledy-piggledy accretions that occurred in
Gothic churches built over hundreds of years. The classical orders were
also employed, with the Doric in the first story of the building, the Ionic
in the middle, and the Corinthian at the top. Michelangelo’s Palazzo
Farnese in Rome is a classic example of the Renaissance style, as is his
dome of St. Peter’s Basilica.
The Renaissance style evolved into baroque, a fuller and more ornate
style. The sweeping colonnade in front of St. Peter’s, designed by Bernini,
is a perfect example of this style. If baroque was an elaboration of the
Renaissance style, then rococo was overkill — the addition of all sorts 
of baubles and flourishes to the underlying structure. Perhaps the best
word to describe rococo is “busy.” With its twisting columns and encrust-
ing of gold, Bernini’s baldacchino (a baldaquin or canopy) inside St.
Peter’s shows the baroque beginning to get out of hand.
As a bridge between East and West, Italy’s architecture shows at times a
deep Eastern influence, particularly on its eastern coast. Venice has a
style all its own, labeled Venetian Gothic, of which St. Mark’s Basilica
Part I: Introducing Italy 
22

(Basilica di San Marco) is a gem. The onion domes and the ornate deco-
ration reflect a Byzantine influence; the exotic materials, including por-
phyry, gold, and jewels, came from across the Venetian empire. Sicily,
too, has its own style, which reflects Norman influence as well as
Eastern art and crafts imported during the period when the island was
ruled by Arabs (from their conquest in 831 until their defeat by the
Normans Robert Guiscard and Robert I in 1072). The Cappella Palatina
(Palatine Chapel) within the Palazzo Normanni is an astounding syn-
thesis of Byzantine mosaics, Islamic art, and an intricate ceiling that is a
masterpiece of Arab woodcarving. Later, the island developed its own
version of baroque, the Sicilian Barocco, a captivating and ornate style
that is found in many cities in Sicily and contrasts with the stark beauty
of Norman architecture in Palermo.
A Taste of Italy: Eating (and 
Drinking) Locally
You are most certainly familiar with Italian cuisine, but you may not be
an expert in the structure of an Italian meal. Although ever-expanding
working hours have made it more difficult for Italians to enjoy their tra-
ditional pranzo (midday meal) every day, they indulge in it whenever
possible: during the week for business lunches, and on the weekend
with family and friends. A complete meal includes several courses and 
is always accompanied by wine and water (usually bottles of mineral
sparkling and still).
The meal starts with antipasti (appetizers), including a variety of cured
meats, vegetable tidbits, and seafood preparations, depending on the
region (see later in this section). Sometimes they are served buffet-style
and you can get up and choose what you want; otherwise, you can order
your own individual dish — not much fun — or go the Italian way and
ask your waiter to bring a selection for the number of people in your
party to share, definitely the most festive choice.
The meal continues with the primo (first course), which can be a soup
(mostly served in fall and winter) or a rice or pasta dish. The pasta dish
is but another appetizer, and the real meal has yet to come. The sec-
ondo (main course) is a meat or fish dish, which you may accompany
with a contorno (side dish) — but you have to order that separately in
traditional restaurants. Only in gourmet restaurants will the chef limit
your freedom and impose a specific association of flavors of his choice,
serving a meat or fish preparation with a particular side dish. In most
other places, you may choose from among a variety of potatoes (usually
oven-roasted or french fries) and vegetables (usually cooked leafy
greens, green beans, or salad).
It is nowadays quite acceptable to stop at your first course and skip the
secondo, or to skip the primo and go straight for the main course. A lot
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Italy 23

of Italians will do the same, particularly during an ordinary lunch at a
local trattoria. However, if you are in a formal restaurant and not every-
body in your party chooses to do the same, you have to specify to the
waiter that you want all the dishes brought to the table together, other-
wise he will wait for everybody who has ordered a first course to finish
before bringing in the secondi.
To finish, you can have cheese and/or dessert. This includes dolce —
cake, pastry, or pudding — or fresh fruit (when in season, strawberries
with whipped cream are very popular with locals). You can then top it
all with caffè (coffee) and amaro (bitter digestif liqueur).
The cena (evening meal) was traditionally a less elaborate meal, cen-
tered on soup, cured meats, cheese, and vegetable dishes. For many
working people, this has become the only meal at which the whole
family is together, and therefore it has taken up many of the elements of
the pranzo. However, most people will have a full meal only when they
go out for a special dinner; otherwise, they choose to have a simpler
meal at an informal restaurant.
What Italians call a ristorante is a formal kind of restaurant, with proper
tablecloths and elegant settings, and always serving a full menu of
regional and Italian specialties. You also find a full menu in a trattoria or
osteria, but these are usually more casual, family-run establishments
that serve hearty and less elaborate local dishes. Whether you’re at a 
ristorante, trattoria, or osteria, you are still able to have the traditional
pranzo, at either lunch or dinner.
You can have a faster and cheaper meal in a pizzeria, a sit-down eatery
specializing in pizza; these usually serve individual round pizzas and a
limited choice of antipasti. Sometimes you may find a restaurant that
doubles as a pizzeria, in which case it will have both a regular menu and
a pizza menu. Pizza is still usually considered evening fare, but thanks to

Dress code
Italians tend to dress in attire that may look rather formal to American eyes (rarely
jeans, and no shorts, even in the summer). This is true during the day, and even more
so in the evening. As a man, you may unpleasantly stick out if you’re wearing shorts
and a tank top, and you may not be able to have lunch except in the most informal
eateries. Shorts and tank tops (except for really stylish and elegant ones) are not a
good choice for women, either, although they may pass more easily.
In Vatican territory — and that includes all of the churches and religious buildings in
Italy — both men and women will be refused access at the entrance unless they
cover up those shoulders and thighs. If you’re visiting in the summer, bring a silk
scarf or sweater for your shoulders, and wear a longer skirt or pants.

an increasing demand, more and more restaurants are offering pizza for
lunch as well. The typical pizzeria antipasti differ somewhat from the
choices offered in other types of restaurants: You find a variety of deep-
fried items, such as filetto di baccalà (a piece of deep-fried cod),
bruschetta (a slice of hearty bread topped with chopped tomatoes and
olive oil), potato croquettes, and suppli or arancini (balls of seasoned rice
filled with cheese or meat and deep-fried). The pizzas themselves come
with a variety of pre-established toppings; most of these combinations
are rooted in longstanding tradition, such as the margherita (tomato,
mozzarella, and basil); napoletana or romana (tomato, mozzarella, and
anchovies); capricciosa (tomato, mozzarella, mushrooms, artichoke
hearts, olives, ham, and half a boiled egg); funghi (mushrooms, tomato,
and mozzarella); rugola, bresaola, e parmigiano (fresh arugula and thin
slices of cured beef and Parmesan cheese, with a simple tomato sauce);
quattro formaggi (four kinds of cheese); broccoletti e salsicce (broccoli
rabe and Italian sausages); and so on.
Not even considered a proper restaurant by locals, a rosticceria or
tavola calda is a sort of cafeteria with pre-prepared hot dishes behind 
a glass counter and, often, roasting chickens in the window. These are
excellent places for a quick meal on the go. If you’re even more pressed
for time, we recommend snacking at one of the ubiquitous pizza coun-
ters that offer pizzas by the weight; these also sell soda, water, and
sometimes beer, but usually don’t have a seating area.
Bars are another choice. Open almost round-the-clock, they are the
Italians’ home away from home. In addition to aperitivo (pre-dinner
drinks), they all serve coffee and croissants for breakfast, and sand-
wiches and snacks throughout the day. Typical sandwiches include rolls
filled with omelet, cheese, or cured meats; and tramezzino are slices 
of crustless American-style bread filled with a variety of mayo-based
salads. Some bars also double up as simple restaurants with limited
menus, preparing real entrees for lunch. You can enjoy your sandwich
standing at the counter, Italian-style, but if you prefer to eat at a table,
you have to first sit and then order, as the menu is often different and
more extensive (and a surcharge applies for table dining). Bars offer a
full range of refreshments, from cappuccino to wine, soda to ice cream.
You can easily recognize a good bar by taking a look at its glass counter:

What is the waiter waiting for?
In no other country does the word “waiter” live up to its full meaning: It is Italian
custom that diners should be left undisturbed by the restaurant staff, who will appear
at your side ( only when signaled explicitly ( to take your order or bring you more bread
or another bottle of water. In the most formal restaurants, you even have to hail the
menu since it is believed you may want some private time with your party before delv-
ing into the more mundane task of choosing your meal.

buy their bread and pastries from a reputable forno (bakery) in the vicin-
ity. To pick the best, just follow the locals.
Dining hours in Italy are later than in the United States. Italians sit down
to dinner between 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.; lunch is between 1 and 3 p.m.
Most restaurants open around noon for lunch and 7:30 p.m. for dinner. In
our restaurant reviews throughout this book, we provide opening and
closing times that refer to the kitchen’s hours — basically, the times
you’re allowed to place your order. Few restaurants will keep the kitchen
open past 11:30 p.m. in the city and 10 p.m. in the countryside, and only
a minority will open any earlier than 7:30 p.m.
While a 10 to 15 percent charge for servizio (service) is usually included
(this will be specified on the menu; if it’s not, that means the service will
be added to your bill), an extra 5 to 10 percent is expected for good
service. Many restaurants still charge a pane e coperto (bread and
table) fee, calculated per person, although it is sometimes included in
the price of each dish. This charge tends to vary depending on the ele-
gance of the restaurant and its location (moderate and rarely assessed
in Rome, it is steep and ubiquitous in Venice); it ranges between 1€ and
6€ ($1.60–$9.60) throughout the country.
Italian cuisine is really quite different from region to region, as you’ll see
later in our quick overview. Be adventurous, try the local specialties
when you can, and no matter where you are, don’t miss the local wines
unless you’re a teetotaler.
Relishing Roman cuisine
Traditional Roman cuisine is based on simple food, “poor people” fare. It
may be unsophisticated, but we just love it. Among the primi, our
favorite Roman specialty is pasta all’amatriciana (a tomato-and-bacon
sauce with pecorino cheese) and its tomatoless relative, gricia. We also
like pasta all’arrabbiata (tomato sauce with lots of hot red pepper); gnoc-
chi (potato dumplings in a tomato-based sauce), traditionally served on
Thursdays only; and cannelloni (pasta tubes filled with meat or fish and
baked). Ricotta and spinach ravioli are often excellent as well. Our
favorite secondi are abbacchio (young lamb) roasted with herbs or scotta-
dito (grilled cutlets), as well as saltimbocca alla romana (veal or beef
stuffed with ham and sage and sautéed in a Marsala sauce). For the more
adventurous, there is trippa alla romana (tripe Roman style). Desserts

A dish by any other name

to Zuppa Inglese” in Appendix B.

are few, mostly gelato (rich, creamy ice cream), creamy zabaglione
(made with sugar, egg yolks, and Marsala wine), or tiramisù (layers of
mascarpone cheese and espresso-soaked ladyfingers).
The best-known wines of Rome come from the nearby Castelli Romani, the
hill towns to the east of the city. Our favorites are the white Frascati —
very dry and treacherously refreshing — and the red Velletri.
Tasting Tuscany
Much as they hate to admit it, many Italians from other regions have to
agree that the best Italian cuisine is to be found in Tuscany. (We don’t
have to tell you what Tuscans themselves say.) Many of the traditional
dishes are farm-country recipes based on plenty of fresh vegetables and
game, though others were refined creations for the Florentine sover-
eigns. We love to start our meal with crostini (toasted bread with savory
toppings, including a sort of delicious pâté). Among the cold cuts are
finocchiona, a fennel-flavored salami famous all over Italy. In winter, we
never miss the thick traditional soup ribollita, made of black cabbage,
bread, and vegetables. When in Siena, we always have some pici (hand-
rolled spaghetti usually prepared with bread crumbs and tomato sauce).
Another of our favorites is pappardelle al sugo di lepre (large fettuccine
with hare sauce) or al cinghiale (wild-boar sauce). The best secondo of
all — but it has to be the real thing from the Chianina cow (a breed
raised only in the Tuscan countryside and blessed with especially delec-
table meat) — is the Fiorentina, a thick steak that will shame any
American Westerner. One contorno not to miss is fagioli all’uccelletto
(white Tuscan beans in a light tomato sauce). To end the meal, we like
the simple cantucci col vin santo (hazelnut biscotti served with a glass of
local sweet wine) and the delicious Panforte — a typical Christmas
dessert that can be bought year-round in Siena, where it was invented.
Nearby Umbria has a cuisine similar to that of Tuscany, with one major
difference: truffles. These come in white and black varieties; the former,
which has a milder flavor, is the most coveted.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Italy 27
The etiquette of drinking
Don’t expect to order a martini before dinner. In many restaurants, and more particu-
larly in trattorie, osterie, and pizzerie, you probably won’t find a full bar, as Italians
simply don’t drink liquor right before dinner. The widespread aperitivo is always taken
at a bar before going to a restaurant, and is always accompanied by small tidbits of
tasty food. If you make a bar your first stop, you can soak up the festive aperitivo ambi-
ence and also try the bittersweet aperitivo cocktail or non-alcoholic beverage Italians
favor. They tend to drink wine during dinner and reserve liquor for the end of the meal,
when they’re likely to have a grappa (a clear brandy) or an amaro (a 60- to 80-proof
bitter drink, made with herbs).

Farther afield, the cuisine of the Cinque Terre is highlighted by lots of
fresh fish and the liberal use of its native pesto, a crushed-basil sauce
now famous around the world. Another local specialty is zuppa di pesce,
a savory, brothy fish stew.
Chianti is perhaps the best-known Tuscan red, and is often served as
table wine — even on tap, from huge casks — in Tuscan restaurants. The
red Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and Brunello di Montalcino are among
Italy’s greatest wines. For a white, try Vernaccia di San Gimignano; for a
dessert wine, opt for the famous vin santo.
Visiting Venetian and Milanese eateries
In Venice, fish and shellfish served on rice, pasta, or polenta (cooked
cornmeal) are the staples of the local cuisine. Our favorite antipasti are
sarde in saor (sardines in a sauce of vinegar, onions, and pine nuts) and
baccalà mantecato (creamed codfish served cold). Among the primi, risi
e bisi (rice and peas) and bigoli in salsa (whole-wheat spaghetti with
anchovy-and-onion sauce) get our approval, while for secondo, we enjoy
the famous fegato alla veneziana (liver sautéed with onions and wine).
Pastry shops have a variety of local cakes as well as the famous Bussolai
and Essi Buranei — O- and S-shaped cookies, respectively, originally
from the small island of Burano.
In Milan, we enjoy a couple of well-rounded traditional dishes: Risotto
(creamy Italian rice cooked with fish or vegetables) was invented here,
and the risotto alla Milanese (with saffron and beef marrow) is delectable
when well prepared. For secondo, try the cotoletta alla Milanese, a tender
deep-fried cutlet reminiscent of Wiener schnitzel and probably a rem-
nant of the Habsburg domination in the area.
Some of the best wines in Italy come from the Venetian countryside; we
love Amarone and Valpolicella — earthy reds that can take the chill out
of the damp weather in winter. If you prefer whites, there’s Cartizze . . .
but we love prosecco, a fizzy wine that we even prefer to champagne.
Gnawing Neapolitan delicacies
Naples is justly famous for pizza — Neapolitans claim it as their inven-
tion and indeed are masters at preparing it. But the local cuisine has a
lot more to offer than just pizza, and although we really appreciate a
good Tuscan meal, we are quite partial to Neapolitan cuisine. The fact
that we love seafood probably has a lot to do with it, so if you don’t, you
may not share our excitement. Our favorite appetizers are impepata di
cozze (mussels steamed in light broth with lots of pepper) and a caprese
salad made with the famous mozzarella di bufala (buffalo mozzarella).
Our absolute favorite primo is scialatielli ai frutti di mare (local home-
made pasta with mussels and other seafood). For secondo, go for fresh
fish all’acquapazza (poached in a light herbed broth) or the famous
polpi al coccio (stewed octopus in a tomato sauce). Naples is also a great
Part I: Introducing Italy 
28

place for those with a sweet tooth; the babá is the typical pastry, a soft
brioche soaked in rum and sugary syrup, served with a dollop of pastry
cream. For breakfast, you absolutely have to try the local specialty:
sfogliatella, a fragrant, crisp, crusty triangular pocket filled with sweet
ricotta. It’s the perfect accompaniment to a Neapolitan coffee — another
area of acknowledged superiority.
Naples is famous for the Lachrymae Christi (Tears of Christ), a wine
made from grapes grown on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, hence pro-
duced only in small quantities.
Savoring Sicily
When it comes to cooking (as in so many other things), Sicily is in a
class by itself. The Sicilians perfected multiculturalism centuries ago.
Here you find the most unique combinations — such as Italian-looking
pasta served with pistachio nuts and North African spices. And because
Sicily is an island, its cuisine is highlighted by tastes from the sea.
Typical dishes are pasta con le sarde (pasta with shredded fresh sar-
dines), capponata (cubed eggplant with other vegetables, spiced and
sautéed), tonno con aglio e menta (fresh tuna with garlic and mint), and
fish dishes with finocchietto (small fresh fennel). If you want only a sand-
wich, go for the typical Palermo focacce. It can be filled with anything,
from the excellent caciocavallo (typical cheese) to fried spleen — yes,
spleen, plus a little lung to round things out. Less adventurous “fast
food” includes arancini (deep-fried flavored rice balls) and panelle
(chickpea fritters). Keep in mind that Sicilians really excel at desserts
and pastries. Cassata is a fabulous creation: ricotta mixed with sugar and
candied fruit, then covered with a layer of cake and finally almond paste.
Sicilian gelato is heavenly — we quickly adopted the local custom of
having it for breakfast, as the filling of a soft brioche, and accompanied
by a small cup of excellent espresso. Locals say that gelato was invented
in Palermo; we nod and keep eating it. Another local specialty is granita
(frozen coffee or lemon ice — or, best of all, almond ice).
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Italy 29
Smoking
Italy was the first European country to institute a law against smoking in public places
back in 1995, and the rules are among the Continent’s toughest. All restaurants and
bars are affected by this ruling, except those with ventilated smoking rooms. Only about
10 percent of Italian restaurants currently have these separate smoking areas. It is just
as difficult to find a bar where you can smoke; only the larger places will have sepa-
rate smoking areas. If smoking is important to you, call the restaurant or bar ahead of
time to make sure it has a smoking area. In good weather, you will always be able to
smoke on the outdoor terraces of restaurants and bars, where the law does not apply.

Sicilian wines tend to be red and strong. There is a large variety; you
may be familiar with the Corvo di Salaparuta, which is quite good. Our
favorite is Nero d’Avola.
Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
The number of books and films about Italy is staggering. Whether you
want to bone up on history or be entertained by sights of the Eternal
City, here are a few of our favorites.
True stories
 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was the first great modern literary
visitor to Italy, and his wonderful Italian Journey (1816; reprinted
by Penguin Books, 1992) recounts his travels there.
 American novelist Henry James lived most of his life in Europe.
Some of his essays on art and culture are collected in Italian
Hours (1907; reprinted by Penguin Books, 1995) — the pieces on
Venice are particularly good.
 D. H. Lawrence wrote several books about Italy, including The Sea
and Sardinia (1921) and Etruscan Places (1927); a selected edi-
tion, D. H. Lawrence and Italy, has been published by Penguin
(1997).
 If you read 25 pages a day, it takes you only about four months to
get through Edward Gibbon’s History of the Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire (begun in 1776), a monument of English prose.
(You can find a less monumental Penguin abridged version [1983]
in paperback.)
 Robert Graves wrote two novels — I, Claudius (1934; reprinted 
by Vintage Books, 1989) and its sequel, Claudius the God (1934;
reprinted by Penguin Books, 1989) — about the best of Augustus’s
Claudian successors.
 Italian Giorgio Vasari was a painter, architect, and (literally)
Renaissance man. His Lives of the Most Eminent Painters and
Sculptors (1550; expanded 1568) has been criticized for inaccu-
racy, but is still full of interesting information about the great
painters of the Renaissance. The Oxford edition (1998) is one of 
the many abridgements in translation of this huge work.
 Benvenuto Cellini’s famous Autobiography (published 1728;
translation reprinted by Penguin, 1999) presents a vivid picture 
of Cellini’s time in Renaissance Florence.

30

Works of fiction
 Ignazio Silone was an important socialist writer who had to go into
exile during Mussolini’s reign. Bread and Wine (Pane e vino, 1937;
translated by New American Library, 1988) is a vivid novel set
during the fascist period — a modern classic.
 Giuseppe Lampedusa (actually Giuseppe Tomasi, prince of
Lampedusa) wrote a single masterpiece, The Leopard (Il Gattopardo,
1958; translated by Pantheon, 1991), about the effect on a noble
Sicilian family of Garibaldi’s invasion and the war of unification.
 Alberto Moravia, one of the great Italian writers of the 20th cen-
tury, wrote many novels and short stories, but none as famous as
The Conformist (Il Conformista, 1951; translated by Steerforth
Press, 1999), a study of the fascist personality.
 Sicilian novelist Leonardo Sciascia wrote books that subtly peel
apart the Mafia culture, layer by layer. Among the best of his works
is The Day of the Owl (Il Giorno della Civetta, 1961; translated by
New York Review of Books, 2003).
 Alessandro Manzoni wrote I Promessi Sposi (The Betrothed,
1825–27; translated by Penguin, 1984), considered one of the great-
est works of fiction in any language. It’s a sweeping romantic novel
set in 17th-century Italy.
The moving image
The neorealist film director Luchino Visconti made an epic movie of
Lampedusa’s The Leopard. Also by Visconti is The Earth Trembles
(Terra Trema, 1948), a version of Verga’s I Malavoglia. Bernardo
Bertolucci made a haunting and chilling classic out of Moravia’s The
Conformist in 1970.

Word to the wise
Italian is the general language spoken in Italy; however, if you know a bit of it, or if
your ear is particularly good, you may notice that people speak differently in different
parts of Italy. Local dialects, now mostly used in the countryside, add local color but
can also make things difficult for a beginner. If necessary, resort to the universal form
of backup communication: sign language. In Italy, hands talk — both to emphasize
words and to convey further meaning. If you don’t speak any Italian at all, most Italians
will still go out of their way to try to understand you and help you out, and signs can
be of great help. Also check out our glossary of Italian words (see Appendix B) and our
list of what we deem the ten most useful expressions (see Chapter 23). If you’re more
adventurous, devote some time to Italian For Dummies and you’ll soon become a pro.

Over the last dozen years or so, Italy has been the subject or the setting 
of several hit films. It all began with A Room with a View (1985), based
on E. M. Forster’s novel and containing beautiful scenes of Florence.
Enchanted April (1992) is a sometimes schmaltzy but irresistible movie
about a group of Londoners leaving the drizzle and fog of home for a
sunny Italian villa. The Postman (Il Postino, 1994), an instant cult classic,
concerns the encounter of the ordinary man of the title with the extraordi-
nary personality of the poet Pablo Neruda, living in exile in Italy. The
Oscar-winning Life Is Beautiful (1997), by Italy’s current leading comic
actor, Roberto Benigni, is set during World War II and moves from Tuscany
to a German concentration camp. The comedy Mediterraneo (1991), also
set during World War II, deals with what happens when a group of Italian
soldiers are sent to garrison a lovely Greek island. Somewhat stereotypi-
cally, their Italian love of life wins out over their mission. At the opposite
end of the spectrum is Nanni Moretti’s The Son’s Room (2001), about the
death of a child — a film so powerful that it is perhaps the only movie
ever to be given an R rating for being so sad.
We have to mention one of the great oldies, Roman Holiday (1953), the
Gregory Peck/Audrey Hepburn romance that is said to have caused a
surge in tourism to Rome. Another hugely popular film of the same era is
Spartacus (1960), the Oscar-winning Kirk Douglas movie about a slave
revolt in ancient Rome (we can’t vouch for its historical accuracy). It
was a precursor to Russell Crowe’s Gladiator (2000), which also gives a
visceral feel for the brutality of the empire at its worst.

eneath the modernization and globalization Italy has undergone
since the 1990s, the same proud traditions live on. In a country
where you can’t even count the number of political parties on both
hands and feet, diversity is not in danger. Centuries-old traditions of
independent thinking are what give Italy its unique flavors, voices, and
places. Selecting your destinations from among these riches is an inspir-
ing challenge. In this chapter, you find our best tips and suggestions to
help guide you through Italy’s maze of attractions and distractions,
cuisines and subcultures.
Going Everywhere You Want to Be
Every region of Italy offers eye-popping sights as well as places to spend
quiet moments. The following overview of Italy’s best attractions by
region will help you narrow down the destinations on your itinerary,
whether this is your first trip or your fifth.
Roaming Rome
Rome is still the capital of Italy, as it was in ancient times. As the site of
the Holy See, it was central to European culture for many centuries after
the end of the Roman Empire — hence its unparalleled saturation of
world-famous sights: the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, St. Peter’s
Basilica, the Vatican Museums, and the Galleria Borghese, to name a
few. There are even sights underground, like the Catacombs, while new
archaeological sites are continually being opened, such as the Imperial
Fori. As a major modern city, Rome also offers a varied and exciting
nightlife, a huge selection of restaurants, plentiful and comfortable
hotels, and world-famous shops. It has so much to see and do, visitors

could spend months here and still find new things to savor and explore
every day.
Because of its size and energy, Rome can be quite overwhelming. You
will not be able to enjoy it very much unless you’re able to devote a few
days here. See Part III for coverage of Rome.
Exploring Florence and the best 
of Tuscany and Umbria
Tuscany has been the number-one tourist destination in Italy for decades
now, thanks to its lush countryside (where most people would love to
own a villa) and numerous art attractions. Florence, with its beautiful
Duomo (Cathedral) and museums overflowing with art treasures — the
Galleria degli Uffizi foremost among them — is one of the finest cultural
cities in the world, and its compact size make it very visitor friendly.
Florence’s fame tends to overshadow its many neighboring towns, which
are art gems in themselves and well worth a trip. We love Lucca, for
example, a medieval and Renaissance jewel nearby and an excellent day
trip from Florence.
Many are the other towns we love in both Tuscany and nearby Umbria,
starting with Pisa, with its world-famous Leaning Tower (the whole
complex, with the Duomo and the Camposanto, is so strikingly beautiful
on a sunny day that you will not regret your visit). Two other personal
favorites are medieval Siena, with its rusty-brick color and the exciting
Palio delle Contrade (the horse race that occurs twice a year in the
summer), as well as Perugia, the medieval capital of Umbria. Once you
are in Umbria, you should not miss Assisi — with its famous frescoes by
Giotto celebrating the life of St. Francis (dazzling in spite of the earth-
quake damage) — and Spoleto, with its charming medieval architecture
and imposing fortress, not to mention its lively music-and-arts festival of
international renown. If you have time, you certainly should visit the
perfectly preserved medieval San Gimignano, with its soaring towers;
and the Chianti, with its unique landscape of sweet hills dotted with
vineyards, where you can taste delicious food and wine.
A little farther afield (actually located in the neighboring region of
Liguria) is the park of the Cinque Terre, a preserved nature paradise
where time seems to have stopped. It is named after the five tiny fish-
ing/farming villages nestled along a stretch of coast that rivals the more
famous Amalfi Coast in steepness and natural beauty. See Part IV for
more on Tuscany and Umbria.
Viewing Venice and the Pianura Padana
Many artists and writers have been utterly smitten by La Serenissima
(the Serene Republic), as this city called itself when it was an independent
state — and we haven’t been immune to its charms, either. If you have
only one day in Italy, we recommend you spend it in Venice, which pro-
motes dreaming like no other place. In a country lush with one-of-a-kind
Part I: Introducing Italy 
34

sights, Venice is truly in a class by itself. In addition to its glorious cultural
attractions — the Doge’s Palace, St. Mark’s Basilica, Piazza San Marco,
the Gallerie dell’Accademia — the whole town is magical, with its narrow
streets and romantic canals.
The surrounding region, the Pianura Padana, is dotted with smaller
towns, which, although they cannot compete with Venice, make very
good rivals to other tourist destinations in Italy. Verona tops our list for
both its romantic culture — Romeo and Juliet lived out their tragic affair
here (supposedly) — and its architecture. Padua is a close second,
thanks to its charming Renaissance architecture and Giotto’s most cele-
brated frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel. Milan may not be our favorite
city in the world, but its attractions are first-rate: We absolutely love the
Duomo and the Brera. See Part V for coverage of Venice and the Pianura
Padana.
Visiting Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast
Naples, and its surrounding region, is one of our favorite destinations 
in Italy. The city’s huge collection of art treasures (Archaeological
Museum, Museo di Capodimonte, Duomo, Palazzo Reale, Castel
Nuovo, Santa Chiara, and Sant’Anna dei Lombardi, to mention a few)
and the breathtaking natural beauty of its nearby coast are enough to
delight anybody for days on end. Back in the 18th century, foreign visi-
tors spent far more time in Naples and its surroundings than in Florence
and Tuscany, but decades of neglect, corruption, and crime had obscured
its attractions. Luckily, a steady program of renovations and updates
began in the 1990s, and Naples is now coming back.
A short distance from Naples are two of the world’s most famous archae-
ological sites, the Roman cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii, wiped out
by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Farther south are the myth-
ical Sorrento peninsula and the Amalfi Coast, much more beautiful that
any postcard could ever reveal. The Amalfi Coast’s famous resorts
include Positano and Amalfi, both nestled along plunging cliffs. And
Capri, the VIPs’ and Hollywood stars’ island getaway, is a green hill that
rises steeply from the sea. See Part VI for more on Naples and environs.
Seeing Sicily
The farther south you go, the more intense Italy becomes. The rugged
beauty, bountiful waters, and rich soils of Sicily have been fought over
for millennia — and we understood why soon after visiting for the first
time. You won’t find such an exciting and pleasing mix of sights, cultures,
flavors, and landscapes anywhere else in Italy. We love Palermo, a pleas-
ant harbor town with spectacular artistic and architectural treasures —
some a bit crumbling — ranging from the Byzantine Duomo di Monreale
to the Arabic La Zisa, the Gothic Cattedrale to the Norman Palazzo dei
Normanni, the baroque Casa Professa to the Liberty-style Teatro
Massimo. We cannot get enough of the magnificent Greek temples in the
appropriately named Valley of the Temples in Agrigento, as well as in
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 35

Segesta — both easy day trips from Palermo. A bit farther, but chock-
full of spectacular Roman mosaics, is the Villa del Casale of Piazza
Armerina. Although we agree that the fashionable city of Taormina is
nestled in one of Italy’s most picturesque spots — overlooking the blue
sea from a high cliff and dominated by the snow-capped Mount Etna
volcano — it didn’t inspire us as much as Catania with its baroque and
19th-century palaces built of gray-lava stone, or the fascinating Syracuse,
with its Greek and Roman Archaeological Zone and its baroque island of
Ortigia. See Part VII for coverage of Sicily.
Scheduling Your Time
A quick glance at the map will reveal that the enticing attractions dis-
cussed in the previous section are spread out over a peninsula that’s
more than 700 miles long. A closer look will show you that Italy is
crossed lengthwise by a mountain chain — the Apennines — that will
make any east–west travel more complicated: logistically because there
are fewer roads and railroad lines, and practically because bad weather,
especially in winter, may considerably slow you down. Both these geo-
graphical characteristics can be easily sidestepped, however, by flying
between your destinations. Taking the plane has become quite afford-
able now that many routes within Italy have opened up to small private
carriers (see Chapter 7). The drawback is that flying requires advance
scheduling. If you prefer a more spontaneous itinerary, one that allows
you to change your destination at the last minute, then you should stick
with the freedom afforded by railroad transportation (or rental car, but
for countryside exploration only).
On the other hand, these geographical characteristics make itinerary
planning relatively straightforward: Your travels will be along a general
north–south line. Your route can be as long as your time will allow —
just remember to schedule fewer destinations if you’re traveling by land
rather than by air.
It used to be that all international flights arrived only in Milan or Rome.
These days, you can usually schedule your flight to arrive in one Italian
town and leave from another at no extra expense, which allows for much
more creative itinerary planning (see Chapter 6 for more on how to get
to Italy).
If your itinerary includes only the major cities, don’t bother renting a 
car — instead, fly or take the train: You see far more beautiful land-
scapes and enjoy your vacation much more. Trains in Italy are getting
better and faster by the day, yet remain very affordable (see Chapter 7).
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Italy has a mild climate with well-defined seasons, drier and warmer in
the south and colder in the north. The weather doesn’t really influence
Part I: Introducing Italy 
36

tourism in general, as Italy is a year-round destination, but it may affect
your own itinerary planning.

In all major cities and towns, the off season is very short, running from
mid-January to mid-March and from mid-October to mid-December. The
actual dates depend on individual hotels, as well as occupancy: As a rule
of thumb, high season starts earlier for smaller and cheaper hotels,
which tend to fill faster, and lasts longer. The reverse is true for more
expensive hotels. On the seashore and in the mountains, resorts will
often be closed from November through March. Following are what we
consider to be the pros and cons for traveling in each season.
April through June
This is when Italy is at its most beautiful, for the following reasons:
 The weather is mild, so you won’t have to worry about either
excess heat and sunstroke or the chills.
 Limited rainfall allows you to get out and really enjoy the outdoor
activities.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 37

But keep in mind a couple of drawbacks:
 Everybody knows this is a great season — including hotels and 
airlines, which jack up their prices. The highly desirable hotels fill
up fast.
 Around Easter, vast numbers of Catholic pilgrims and large groups
of very noisy schoolchildren from around the world descend on
Italy (particularly its major destinations), making it all but impossi-
ble to enjoy many attractions.
July and August
Summertime is when many Italians take their vacations, and there are
many upsides:
 The weather is beautiful throughout most of Italy.
 You can get discount rates in most towns and cities, as well as in
Sicily.
 There are great art and music festivals, concerts, and outdoor
events everywhere — cultural life is at its peak.
On the other hand:
 Airfares are high.
 The heat can make things quite uncomfortable — remember, Italy
is still mostly a non–air-conditioned country, and Sicily is sunstroke
territory.
 Mountain and seaside resorts, which can provide a respite from the
heat, are taken over by Italian tourists.
 Many shops and restaurants in major cities close during the month
of August.
September and October
Next to spring, fall is our favorite time to travel to Italy. Here’s why:
 The weather is usually fairly mild and pleasant.
 Many potential tourists are busy with back-to-school preparations,
making crowds relatively sparse.
On the other hand:
 Airfares and hotel prices are still high.
 You have to watch for the rain, which typically starts falling in
October.
Part I: Introducing Italy 
38

November through March
More and more vacationers are reaping the benefits of traveling to Italy
in the winter. Its reputation as the “off season” is fast disappearing.
Here’s why:
 Crowds are at their lowest at the prime attractions.
 You often receive better and more attentive service in hotels during
this season.
 Except for the Christmas–New Year’s period, airfares and hotel
rates are at their lowest.
But keep in mind:
 You may have fewer lodging choices in some areas because of sea-
sonal closures — most hotels and restaurants in Italy take a winter
break of at least two to three weeks.
 Although average temperatures are mild, you have to put up with
rain and occasionally lots of snow. It can get cold and quite foggy in
the northern regions. Depending on how sensitive you are to colder
temperatures, you may not be able to enjoy some of the outdoor
attractions.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
Italy has many festivals and events worth planning a holiday around.
Alternatively, you can use the following calendar to avoid big events and
their attendant crowds. You find more information on each event in the
destination chapters later in this book.
January
Celebrations of the new year are held throughout Italy. In Rome, a 
great show for children is staged in Piazza del Popolo (% 06-36004399),
while Florence celebrates with its annual boat race, the Regata sull’Arno
(% 055-23320). January 1.
Throughout the country, the religious holiday Epifania is very important
for children, as they receive special gifts on this day (more than on Dec
25). On the days preceding Epiphany, open-air fairs selling children’s
toys and gifts are held in most towns; the best is in Rome’s Piazza
Navona. January 6.
February
Everywhere in Italy, Carnevale swallows up the week before Ash
Wednesday, culminating on Fat Tuesday or Martedì Grasso. One of 
the most spectacular celebrations is in Venice, where people dress up 
in splendid costumes and the city organizes concerts and fireworks 
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 39

(% 041-5298711); the famous parade of floats in Viareggio in Tuscany
culminates celebrations that last a whole month (% 0584-47503). One
week prior to Ash Wednesday.
March/April
On Good Friday, the Catholic rite of the procession of the Stations of the
Cross (Via Crucis) is presented in most Italian churches, often as a reen-
actment with costumes. In Rome, the procession takes place at night, led
by the pope, between the Colosseum and Palatine Hill. Other spectacu-
lar processions are the ones in Assisi and in several towns in Sicily.
Friday before Easter Sunday.
For Easter, in Rome, the pope gives his traditional Easter Benediction 
in Piazza San Pietro, while in Florence, mass ends with the Scoppio del
Carro (% 055-290832), the explosion of a cart laden with fireworks and
flowers outside the Duomo. Easter Sunday, between the end of March
and mid-April.
During the Exhibition of Azaleas in Rome, more than 3,000 azalea plants
decorate the Spanish Steps. Concerts are held in Trinità dei Monti at the
head of the steps. Call % 06-4889991 for more information. One week in
mid-April, weather dependent.
In Venice, a great procession to St. Mark’s Basilica marks the city’s patron-
saint day, honoring St. Mark. Venetian men present women with a red rose
on this day. April 25.
May
The first of the month is Labor Day, when most workers have a day off.
Everything shuts down — including most museums and attractions —
and public transportation operates either minimally or not at all. May 1.
Assisi’s celebration of spring, called Calendimaggio (% 075-812534;
www.umbria2000.it), includes singing, dancing, medieval costumes,

and major competition in Venice. Second half of May.
Part I: Introducing Italy 
40

Rome’s glamorous Concorso Ippico Internazionale (% 06-6383818;
www.piazzadisiena.com) attracts the best riders and mounts from all
over to beautiful Piazza di Siena in Villa Borghese. You can buy tickets at
the gate. End of May.
The end of May brings the Settimana della Cultura, a statewide event
during which admission to all the major museums is free — hence, no
reservations are taken and everything becomes a zoo, with thousands of
school groups roaming around. When planning your trip to major towns
in Italy, take this into account. If possible, schedule your visit at a differ-
ent time — we promise, it’s worth it to pay admission. Last week of May.
June
Now in its fourth decade, the Spoleto Festival (% 0743-220320; www.
spoletofestival.it) includes concerts, opera, dance, and theater.

Less spectacular and famous than the one in Siena, Assisi’s Palio di San
Rufino (% 075-812534; www.balestrieriassisi.it) is celebrated
over four days. Renaissance costumes and pageantry precede the cross-
bow competition between the town’s districts. Last weekend in August.
September
Held at the Palazzo del Cinema on the Lido, the Venice International
Film Festival (% 041-5218861; www.labiennale.org) is one of the 
top film festivals in the world. Despite the proliferation of bigwigs and
wannabes, regular folks can actually get tickets to screenings. First two
weeks of September.
In Venice, the Regata Storica (% 041-5298711) is a spectacular rowing
event held in the Grand Canal. You need tickets for this one. First Sunday

Part I: Introducing Italy 
42

Partying reaches its climax at midnight on New Year’s Eve, when Italy
explodes — literally — with fireworks. In spite of the government’s call
for caution, everybody gets in on the act, shooting fireworks from every
window and roof in the country. By tradition, fireworks are accompanied
by the symbolic throwing away of something old to mark the end of the
old year. Some people get carried away, so watch out for falling UFOs if
you take a stroll in major cities shortly after midnight! December 31.

Four Great Options
In This Chapter
 Touring Italy in one or two weeks
 Visiting Italy with your kids
 Rediscovering the ancients
I
taly offers an endless array of things to see, do, and taste — but, alas,
few of us have the time to do it all. And even if you want to cram as
much into your trip as possible, you still have some tough choices to
make. This chapter gives some sample itineraries that won’t break your
budget or your back, including one for families and one for antiquity
buffs. We recommend you book your transatlantic flight with arrival into
one Italian city and departure from another — an option that’s often sur-
prisingly affordable (see Chapter 6).
Seeing Italy’s Highlights in One Week
You won’t have much time to linger anywhere, but if all you have is one
week — grab it! Think of this as a crash course in Italian life and culture.
Day 1
Fly into Milan and check into your hotel. Start with a visit to the Duomo.
Afterward, proceed for a stroll in Milan’s best shopping district, Via
Montenapoleone, where you can purchase, or at least see, the latest in
Italian fashion. Spend the afternoon at the Brera, taking in your first
great collection of Italian art. Celebrate your arrival with dinner in one of
Italy’s best restaurants, CraccoPeck, where you can enjoy a view of the
nearby Duomo by night (see Chapter 17).
Day 2 and 3
Take an early train to Venice (the trip takes under two and a half hours)
and check into your hotel. Squeeze in our “Venice in two days” itinerary
(see Chapter 16).

Day 4
Take as early a train as you can to Florence, which you reach in slightly
under three hours. Check into your hotel, and immediately start with
our “Florence in one day” itinerary in Chapter 13.
Day 5 and 6
Yes, you guessed right: Take an early train, this time to Rome, where you
will arrive in under two hours. Get settled in your hotel, which will need
to be fairly central (see Chapter 11) given the amount of ground you
want to cover. Follow our “Rome in two days” itinerary (see Chapter 12).
Day 7
Again, take an early high-speed train to Naples — you’ll be there in under
90 minutes. What more appropriate destination for your last day in Italy!
Get settled in your hotel and follow our “Naples in one day” itinerary (see
Chapter 18). Fly back home the next morning from the Naples airport.
Touring the Best of Italy in Two Weeks
Two weeks is a good amount of time — you will be able to see enough to
enjoy yourself without feeling rushed all the time.
Day 1, 2, and 3
Fly into Milan and follow our Day 1, 2, and 3 suggestions in the itinerary
earlier.
Day 4 and 5
Take as early a train as you can to Florence, which you reach in slightly
under three hours. Check into your hotel; then start with our “Florence
in two days” itinerary (see Chapter 13).
Day 6, 7, and 8
Take an early train to Rome, a trip of less than two hours. Get settled in
your hotel and then start following our “Rome in three days” itinerary
(see Chapter 12).
Day 9 and 10
Take the 90-minute high-speed train to Naples in the morning and check
into your hotel. Follow our “Naples in two days” itinerary (see Chapter 18).
Day 11
Choose one of the day trips suggested in Chapter 19, visiting either
Herculaneum or Pompeii, or book a car service to take you on a day-
long private tour of Sorrento and the Amalfi Drive (see Chapter 20). If
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 45

you opt for the latter, take your luggage along so that you can have your
limo deliver you to the Molo Angioino in time to catch the Tirrenia
overnight ferry for Palermo (see Chapter 21). Check into your cabin and
enjoy the cruise (if you wake up at the right time in the night, you may
catch a glimpse of Stromboli, an active volcano of the Eolian Islands,
spewing fireworks into the evening sky). Alternatively, fly into Palermo
the next morning.
Day 12
Once in Palermo, spend the day following our “Palermo in one day” itin-
erary (see Chapter 21).
Day 13
If you don’t mind a lot of driving, rent a car for the next two days and
drive yourself to Agrigento and the Valle dei Templi for a visit to its
splendid Greek temples. Then drive on to Syracuse and spend the night
there (see Chapter 22). For a less tiring day, take an organized bus tour
to the Valley of the Temples from Palermo (see Chapter 21), and then
come back to spend the night in your hotel.
Day 14
Visit Ortigia early in the morning and then proceed to Taormina —you’ll
enjoy spending your last day in Italy in this idyllic town. Fly home from
Catania airport the next morning (see Chapter 22). Alternatively, take an
organized bus tour from Palermo to Taormina (see Chapter 21) and fly
home from Palermo.
Discovering Italy with Kids
When traveling with kids, the big question is how much cultural sightsee-
ing (particularly museums) they can handle. Luckily, Italy offers plenty of
attractions and sights that children will enjoy. The following itinerary is
what we would do if we had only a week with our children in Italy.
If your child is under 18 months, you can probably follow one of the
other itineraries geared toward adults. Most museums have benches
where you can rest or nurse, and Italians are pretty tolerant — if you get
any funny looks, they’ll probably be from other tourists. But if you have
a rambunctious toddler or older child, you definitely want to switch to
this kid-size itinerary.
Day 1 and 2
Fly into Venice, get settled in your hotel, and follow our “Venice in one
day” itinerary for your first day (see Chapter 16). If there are two adults
in your party, take turns visiting the Gallerie dell’Accademia while the
other grown-up leads the kids on unending boat rides on the vaporetto
transportation system (we recommend you get a day pass) or exploring
Part I: Introducing Italy 
46

the labyrinth of narrow streets and pretty bridges in the area. On your
second day, visit the Lagoon, particularly the islands of Lido — where
you can rent bikes and explore the beaches — and Murano, where your
kids will be fascinated by a visit to the glass-making factories. If you
have teenagers, follow the recommendations of the Rolling Venice pro-
gram, designed particularly for them (see Chapter 16).
Day 3
Take an early train to Florence, where you will arrive in just under three
hours. Check into your hotel and start with a stroll through town, taking
in the Duomo, Giotto’s Bell Tower, and the Baptistery, and going on 
to Piazza della Signoria and Palazzo Vecchio and the famous Ponte
Vecchio. You can take turns visiting the Uffizi (make the appropriate
reservations in advance) while the other parent entertains the children
by filling them with ice cream or letting them choose souvenirs at the
outdoor markets of San Lorenzo and della Paglia (see Chapter 13).
Day 4 and 5
Take an early train to Rome — you’ll be there in less than two hours. Get
settled in your hotel and follow our “Rome in two days” itinerary (see
Chapter 12), but replace the Galleria Borghese with a boat ride along the
Tiber (or take turns at the Galleria while your children row boats and visit
the kids’ attractions in Villa Borghese). On your second day in Rome,
replace the Vatican Museums with a bike tour of the Appian Way and a
visit to the Catacombs there, which children usually love (alternatively,
take turns at the Vatican while your children visit the wonderful Egyptian
section of the Musei Vaticani or go on that boat ride on the Tiber).
Day 6 and 7
Take the 90-minute high-speed train to Naples. If you have teenagers, pro-
ceed with our “Naples in one day” itinerary (see Chapter 18), replacing the
Capodimonte Museum with the Catacombs of St. Gennaro on your first
day. Spend your second day here exploring Pompeii, Herculaneum, or the
lesser known Oplontis and Campi Flegrei. Alternatively, skip the town of
Naples, take a taxi to the harbor and hop on the ferry (or hydrofoil) for a
trip to Capri (see Chapters 19 and 20) — you’ll appreciate the chance to
relax, especially if you’re with younger children. If two days of hiking the
island, visiting ruins, and basking in the sun seem like too much, you can
always catch a ferry to Positano, Amalfi, or Sorrento (see Chapter 20).
Catch your flight back home from the Naples airport the next morning.
Unearthing Italy’s Ancient History
If archaeology and ancient history and culture are your thing, the focus
of your visit should be southern Italy — Rome, Naples, and Sicily —
where the main intersection of Etruscan, Greek, Carthaginian, Roman,
Norman, and Arab influences took place.
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 47

Day 1 and 2
Fly into Rome, get settled in your hotel, and buy a combo ticket for the
110 Open Stop & Go bus tour plus the Archeobus. Refer to Day 1 of our
“Rome in two days” itinerary (see Chapter 12), but replace the Galleria
Borghese with Palazzo Massimo alle Terme. On Day 2, catch an early
Archeobus from Termini and head for the Park of the Appian Way and
its many attractions. Upon your return in the late afternoon, squeeze in
a visit to the Pantheon and a stroll through Piazza Navona and Castel
Sant’Angelo.
Day 3
Take an early high-speed train to Naples, which you’ll reach in under 
90 minutes. Get settled in your hotel and then start with a visit to the
Museo Archeologico. Afterward, take a local train to Pompeii (see
Chapter 19).
Day 4
If you start early in the day, you should have time for the Campi Flegrei
in the morning and Herculaneum in the afternoon; otherwise, limit your-
self to one of them. Alternatively, take a day trip to visit the Roman ruins
of Capri — they aren’t as spectacular as the ones on the mainland, but
they do have a strong historical and mystical appeal (see Chapter 20).
Take the night ferry to Palermo or fly there the next morning.
Day 5
If you don’t mind a lot of driving, rent a car for the next three days and
drive yourself to Agrigento and the Valle dei Templi, where you spend
the night. Stop on the way to see the Doric temple in Segesta, as well as
the ruins of Selinunte (see Chapter 22). Alternatively, for a less tiring
vacation, settle yourself in Palermo and take day trips using the excel-
lent bus tours (see Chapter 21).
Day 6
Early in the morning, drive to Piazza Armerina to see the Villa del
Casale. In the afternoon, proceed to Syracuse and check into a hotel.
Visit the archaeological area before sunset (see Chapter 22).
Day 7
Visit the Ortigia early in the morning and then head to Taormina, 
where you can admire the splendid Greek theater (see Chapter 22). 
Fly home from Catania (or Palermo, if you chose to take day trips) the
next morning.

I
n this part, we get down to the nuts and bolts of organiz-
ing your trip, including smart choices that will help you
reduce costs and enjoy your vacation even more. Plus, we
give tips for travelers with special interests and needs. 
Chapter 5 discusses money; we deal with budget-related
questions, list some tips for pinching a euro here and there
without sacriﬁcing, and suggest the best ways to handle your
money. Chapter 6 concerns the various ways of getting to
Italy, while Chapter 7 gives you information about getting
around Italy after you arrive. Chapter 8 covers hotel options
and booking your room. In Chapter 9, we offer advice for a
variety of special situations, including traveling with children.
Chapter 10 takes care of details that many travelers leave to
the last minute, such as getting a passport, thinking about
medical and travel insurance, and making reservations for
special events.

Chapter 5
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Devising a realistic budget for your trip
 Finding ways to save some money
 Carrying cash and making sense of the euro
W
hen it comes to planning a vacation budget, you usually deal with
two different numbers: what you’d like to spend and what you
can spend. But if you trim here and there on the incidentals and splurge
just on the things that really matter to you, you can still design a terrific
vacation without breaking the bank. In this chapter, we give you some
pointers on being realistic and keeping track of all the costs that you
have to bear in mind, as well as all the necessary info on handling and
carrying foreign currency.
Planning Your Budget
Italy is more tourist-friendly than ever as the level of services has
increased to match the highest international standards. Globalization,
though, has not come without a price: The cost of living has almost dou-
bled since the introduction in 2002 of the euro, the unit of currency that
replaced the old lire. You get more in hotels and restaurants now, but
you pay more as well. On the other hand, many public institutions,
including state museums and attractions, have maintained — or even
reduced — their prices while offering a lot more than before.
We figure there are six major elements that eat up your vacation budget:
transportation, lodging, dining, sightseeing, shopping, and nightlife.
Knowledge is key, and we want to share with you our hard-earned expe-
rience in each of these areas.
The tables below give a sample of costs that you may encounter on your
trip, both in cities and in the countryside. And if you’re wondering about
taxes, we cover that in “Taking Taxes into Account,” later in this chapter.
Transportation
Airfare to Italy will be one of the biggest items in your budget. Keeping it
low gives you a sort of cushion for the rest of your expenses. The actual

cost depends on the time of year that you travel, but booking in advance
helps, too: In high season, you’re lucky to find a round-trip ticket for less
than about $900; at other times, though, you may find tickets for half
that much or even less. But if you procrastinate and wait until mid-June
to reserve a flight for July, you’ll be lucky to pay $1,200 — if you can find
a seat at all. Be sure to check out our money-saving tips before you buy
an airline ticket (see Chapter 6).

What you spend on transportation once you’re in Italy depends a lot on
your itinerary. Most towns and villages — even small ones — can be
reached by public transportation, which is very affordable and has ever-
improving service. Many train routes offer high-speed options as well.
Traveling by train from Rome to Naples, for example, will cost you about
20€ ($32) for a full fare — or 36€ ($58) on the high-speed — while the
trip from Florence to nearby Siena costs 6€ ($9.60). Buses are usually
cheaper: Count on about 5€ ($8) for a ride between Florence and Siena,
or 17€ ($27) between Siena and Rome.
Flying domestically has become a lot more common as the private carri-
ers have multiplied — with the consequence that prices have dropped
and you can now find a lot of great deals: Venice–Rome may cost you as
little as 55€ ($88); Rome–Catania, 60€ ($96).
In contrast, traveling by car continues to be a nightmare of potential
accidents and high costs — fuel hovers around 1.60€ per liter ($2.55),
renting a car is likely to be more expensive than what you’re used to
back home, tolls on highways are high, and parking ain’t cheap either.
Long-distance trips between major destinations are best done by public
transportation, which is both cheaper and a lot safer. Unless you want to
meander in the countryside at leisure, skip the car rental altogether!
See Chapter 7 for more on traveling within Italy and on driving in a for-
eign country.
Lodging
Lodging is another big-ticket item, but one you cannot forego: After all,
you do need to sleep somewhere! This expense fluctuates depending 
on the time of year; in high season, prices in certain destinations can
double, and you have to book well in advance to secure the best hotels.
The costs also depend on your itinerary: Cities and major towns are the
most expensive, while you spend a bit less in the countryside; also,
southern Italy tends to be less expensive than the north. For example,
you can consider yourself lucky to find a nice room in high season in
Rome or Venice for 200€ ($320), and it will more likely cost you 250€
($400). You do better in smaller towns and in southern Italy: You should
find that same nice room in Assisi for 160€ ($256), and in Naples for
180€ ($288); in the countryside, you should be able to pay about 160€
($256) in the north and 130€ ($208) in the south.
In the hotel reviews in this book, we supply the rack rates, which in Italy
are the highest prices the hotel can charge you (at the peak of high
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 53

season and when the hotel is completely full). You should be able to do
better in most cases. See the Introduction for a table indicating what the
$ symbols ($–$$$$) mean.
Dining
Your expenses in this category will vary with your style: What you spend
will depend on what and how you eat. Possibilities in Italy are endless
and, on the whole, very satisfactory — you find cheap eateries and gour-
met haunts and everything in between, all serving excellent food. You
also have the option of buying your own food (for snacks and picnics,
for example) from a wide range of choices, including small vendors,
open-air markets, and supermarkets. Prices depend on the elegance of
the place you choose and on the food you order, although you can count
on spending more in cities and major towns and less in smaller destina-
tions and the countryside. The north — again — is more expensive than
the south. Drinks excluded, expect to spend about 40€ ($64) per person
for dinner in Rome in a nice restaurant and 25€ ($40) in a less formal
one, such as a pizzeria or osteria; for the same meals in Venice, you
spend 45€ ($72) and 30€ ($48) respectively; and in Naples, 30€ ($48)
and 15€ ($24). In the countryside, you should spend a bit less. For a
truly special meal in one of the top restaurants, expect to spend an aver-
age of 70€ ($112) per person for a meat dinner and as much as 90€
($144) for fish, in both cases a full meal including several courses. For a
meal on the go, you can grab a bite for as little as 5€ to 8€ ($8–$13) in a
rosticceria or pizza a taglio place (see Chapter 2 for the different types of
restaurant options in Italy). Prices are not significantly different at lunch
or dinner, but some restaurants serve more elaborate dishes — priced
accordingly — only at dinner.
Just as with the hotel reviews, we use a dollar-sign system to indicate
the average prices of restaurants; these refer to a complete meal. See the
Introduction for a table indicating what the $ symbols ($–$$$$) mean.
Within the listing information in each review, we give the price range 
of secondi; these are meat or fish dishes (the most expensive dishes on
the menu). Keep in mind that in order to have the equivalent of a main
course, you have to order a side dish separately — or you may be con-
tent with just a primo (a less expensive pasta dish). See Chapter 2 for
more on the structure of a meal in Italy.
Tipping isn’t a big extra in Italy because service is usually included in
the prices; it’s okay to leave just a small token of appreciation. Check for
the words servizio incluso (service included) on the menu; if they aren’t
there, expect to pay a full gratuity of 15 percent.
Sightseeing
This is what you’ve come to Italy for: visiting attractions, attending
events, and enjoying the local culture. Luckily, this expense is the most
manageable: The most you pay for museum admission is 13€ ($21) for
the whole string of museums on Piazza San Marco in Venice. Admission
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
54

to most major museums hovers around 6€ ($9.60) or less. What’s more,
many attractions are free: most churches, for instance, since they are
places of worship and not museums (remember to avoid visiting during
Mass unless you’re attending the service).
If you make advance reservations for attractions, you’ll be able to esti-
mate this part of your budget before you even arrive in Italy. Most muse-
ums and attractions allow you to do so — and they sometimes grant you
a discount to boot (see Chapter 10 for more on advance reservations).
Shopping
Shopping is the one expenditure that can be considered an extra: You
can spend hundreds on a full-length leather coat for yourself or for a
friend, or you can skip the shopping completely. Yet Italy is a shopper’s
paradise: The country is famous for its artwork, design, and crafts — art
glass, pottery, leather, gold, and lace, among many other fine wares.
Italian fashion isn’t half-bad either — Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, and
Armani are a few of the world-famous Italian firms. Depending on
exchange rates, you may actually save by buying Italian goods in Italy.
More important, though, shopping here gives you a chance to buy 
things that simply aren’t available, or not in such variety, back home.
Throughout this book, we give our recommendations for the best shops
and items that each city has to offer. If your budget allows it, use your
trip as a chance to pick up that special something you have an irre-
sistible craving for — maybe a Murano chandelier, a pair of leather
boots, or a Gucci handbag (you may even find a nice used Ferrari).
Nightlife
Visiting the opera, going out for a drink, listening to music in a jazz club,
and dancing the night away are all extra pleasures that will make your
time in Italy that much more memorable. Expect to pay between 30€
and 120€ ($48–$192) for a seat at the opera, and between 15€ and 30€
($24–$48) for a concert, depending on the performer. Cover charges for
nightclubs hover around 10€ ($16), while a drink in a trendy bar will
cost between 6€ and 10€ ($9.60–$16). Once again, expect higher prices
in cities and large towns. You also find many serendipitous little things
to enjoy that are free or nearly so, such as people-watching on a beauti-
ful floodlit piazza, eating an ice-cream cone while strolling on the main
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 55
A pocketful of change
In many of Italy’s churches, fragile paintings are kept in semi-obscurity, but you will
often find a light box nearby. When you insert a coin or two, a light pops on to illumi-
nate a painting, fresco, or sculpture for a limited amount of time. Therefore, carrying
a pocketful of coins is always a good idea.

street of a historic center, and ordering a coffee or drink in a classic caffè
and soaking in the atmosphere.
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
Don’t feel like taking out a second mortgage on your house so you can
afford a vacation to Italy? Well, start thinking like an Italian. Italians have
relatively less disposable income than Americans and have found many
ways to enjoy themselves without going broke. Mirror the way they live
and travel, and the cheaper your trip will be — and the more closely you
get to know the Italians themselves. One thing we recommend, however:
Don’t skip attractions in order to save the admission price, as sightsee-
ing isn’t an area where you can save a lot of money, and you’ll probably
be sorry if you try. If you could enjoy the same experience from the out-
side, then the attraction probably wouldn’t charge you for entering . . .
and we would certainly say so in our write-up!
Throughout this book, you see Bargain Alert icons that highlight money-
saving tips and/or great deals. Here are some additional cost-cutting
strategies:
 Surf the Web. Airlines often have special Internet-only rates that
are appreciably cheaper than rates quoted over the phone. You can
also find good hotel packages online.
 Make your reservations ahead of time. Flights have only so many
seats at low rates, and the best moderately priced hotels fill up
fast.
 Try a package tour. For popular destinations like Italy, you can
book airfare, hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightsee-
ing by making just one call to a travel agent or packager, and you
may pay a lot less than if you tried to put the trip together yourself.
But always work out the prices that you’d pay if you arranged the
pieces of your trip yourself, just to double-check. See the section
on package tours in Chapter 6 for specific suggestions.

Follow the bouncing euro
Only a few years ago, the euro was worth about 90¢, it then bounced back strongly and
after hovering around $1.30 for a while, it recently climbed to $1.60 and seems to want
to stay there. Such swings can make a huge difference: A 100€-per-night hotel that
would have seemed like a bargain at $90 three or four years ago now costs $160. By the
time you read this, the two currencies may be closer to parity, but then again, maybe
not. Obviously it will help to keep an eye on the euro while you’re planning your trip.

 Go off season. If you can travel at nonpeak times (usually winter,
with the exception of the Christmas and New Year’s holidays), you
can find airfares and hotel prices as much as 20 percent lower than
during peak months.
 Travel during off-peak days of the week. Airfares vary depending
not only on the time of the year, but also on the day of the week. In
Italy, weekend rates are often cheaper than weekday rates. When
you inquire about airfares, ask if you can obtain a cheaper rate by
flying on a different day.
 Pack light. Packing light enables you to carry your own bags and
not worry about finding a porter (don’t forget to tip yourself).
Likewise, you can more easily take a bus or a train rather than a
cab from the airport, saving you a few more euro.
 Book a hotel in the center of town. If you’re near all the attrac-
tions, you save money on cab fares and public transportation, as
well as time — your most valuable asset during a vacation.
 Make do with a smaller hotel room and bathroom. It will be differ-
ent from back home, but oh so atmospheric! (See Chapter 8 for
more on what to expect from your hotels in Italy.)
 Ask if your kids can stay in the room with you. Many hotels 
won’t charge you the additional-person rate if your extra person is
pint-size and related to you. You can save much more if you don’t
take two rooms, even if you have to pay some extra euro for a roll-
away bed.
 Skip the breakfast at your hotel (unless it’s included in your room
rate). It won’t be an American breakfast, anyway (except in the
most expensive hotels), and grabbing a hot drink and pastry at a
bar will give you further insight into the local culture. You can also
reserve a room with a refrigerator and keep a few breakfast sup-
plies on hand.
 Have lunch on the go. Try pizza or a bowl of pasta (see Chapter 2
for more on this). Or, armed with a corkscrew and a plastic fork,
you can cheaply assemble a fine picnic lunch from the supermar-
ket, using ingredients you pay dearly for at your local gourmet
shop — fresh bread, locally cured prosciutto, regional cheeses, raw
or cooked vegetables, and local wine or mineral water. A picnic
lunch is also a great way to visit some of the outdoor sights.
 Skip the bread and sodas at restaurants. Most restaurants impose
a basic table-and-bread charge (called pane e coperto) of 1€ to 6€
($1.60–$9.60), which you can avoid in some restaurants — most
restaurants in Rome, for instance — by saying no to the bread
basket. Also, soft drinks are relatively expensive in Italy, whereas
you can order a large bottle of mineral water or a pitcher of house
wine (vino della casa) quite cheaply.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 57

 Take advantage of combination tickets and discount cards. We’ve
flagged these special offers for you in the specific destination chap-
ters that follow. (In Venice, for instance, people under 30 can
receive a discount for shopping, accommodations, and sightseeing
with the Rolling Venice pass.)
 Don’t sit to sip. If what you’re after is a coffee or a drink and not an
experience, save yourself the hefty table-service surcharge at cafes
and bars and have your drink at the counter. A simple coffee at an
outside table in Piazza San Marco in Venice, for example, may cost
the same as lunch anywhere else.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and memories could be the
best mementos of your trip. If you’re concerned about money, you
can do without the T-shirts, key chains, salt and pepper shakers,
and other trinkets.
Handling Money
If you ignore the facts that you probably incur more expenses while
you’re on vacation than you do while at home (unless you happen to eat
out at every meal) and that you deal with a foreign currency, you should
find things pretty familiar: The only form of payment that won’t be quite
as available to you away from home is your personal checkbook.
Making sense of the euro
Italy’s currency, the euro (the plural is also euro, and it’s abbreviated as
€ in this guide), was introduced in January 2002 in Italy and in 11 other
European countries. You can use the same currency in Austria, Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. The transformation to the euro has
made prices much more user-friendly: 1€ is a lot easier to understand
than 1,932 liras!
The exchange rate used in this book is 1€ = $1.60; we round off all dollar
values above $10. Exchange rates fluctuate all the time, though, so check
www.ex-rates.com for up-to-date (and historical) comparisons between
the euro and your currency, whether it’s the U.S. or Canadian dollar, the
British pound, or something else. Another excellent Web site is www.
xe.com/ucc. At press time, the British pound was at 1£ = 1.25€. These
were the rates of exchange used to calculate the values in Table 5-3.
Note that when saying the word euro, Italians pronounce all three
vowels, so it’s ay-ur-oh, not yurr-oh.

You can exchange money at all points of entry in Italy: You find auto-
mated teller machines (ATMs) as well as exchange bureaus at airports
and train stations and, of course, in town. Exchange bureaus usually dis-
play multilingual signs (CHANGE/CAMBIO/WECHSEL). Rates may vary to some
degree. For example, some bureaus advertise “no fee” exchanges, but
then give you a lower rate so you come out the same anyway. Arriving in
Italy with a small supply of euro, at least enough to pay for a cab to your
hotel, is a good idea in case the ATM at the airport doesn’t work or the
lines are unbearably long.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM.
Look at the back of your bank card to see which network you’re on; 
then call or check online for ATM locations at your destination. Cirrus
(% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com) is the most common interna-
tional network in Italy. PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) exists,
but is less common. The Banca Nationale del Lavoro (BNL) is one bank
that does offer PLUS in its ATMs; another sure bet are the ATMs of the
Italian post offices.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 59

Before leaving for Italy, make sure that you check the daily withdrawal
limit for your ATM card, and ask whether you need a new personal iden-
tification number (PIN). (You need a four-digit PIN in Europe, so if you
currently have a six-digit PIN, you must get a new one before you go.)
Also, if your PIN is a word, make sure you know how it translates into
numbers — some ATM keypads in Italy display only numbers.
Many banks impose a fee every time your card is used at a different bank’s
ATM, and that fee can be higher for international transactions (up to $5 or
more) than for domestic ones (where they’re rarely more than $1.50). On
top of this, the bank from which you withdraw cash may charge its own
fee. For details on international withdrawal fees, ask your bank.
In cities and towns, ATMs are never far away, so you can walk around
with little cash in your wallet, especially if don’t mind paying for pur-
chases with a credit card. Before going off on a driving tour of the coun-
tryside, however, make sure that you have a good stock of cash in your
wallet; banks and ATMs are rarer there, and lots of small businesses
don’t accept credit cards.
If you have linked checking and savings accounts and you’re in the habit
of moving relatively small amounts of money from savings to checking as
you need it, beware: Italian ATMs won’t show you the transfer-between-
accounts option, and they won’t allow you to withdraw money directly
from your savings account. If your checking account runs dry, you must
call or write your bank to move money from savings to checking. (We did
so, and our bank charged us $30. Ouch!)
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money. They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances on your credit
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy

The euro look
Paper bills come in 5€, 10€, 20€, 50€, 100€, 200€, and 500€ denominations. All bills
are brightly colored and have a different shade for each denomination. In addition, the
higher the value, the larger the physical size of the bill. Coins come in 1€ and 2€ (both
thin and brass-colored); 10-cent, 20-cent, and 50-cent (all brass colored); and 1-cent,
2-cent, and 5-cent (all copper-colored) denominations. For more information and pic-
tures of the currency, check the official Web site of the European Union (http://
europa.eu.int/euro) or the European Central Bank (www.euro.ecb.int).
Don’t be surprised to see different country names on euro bills and coins: One face is
the European side, common to all of the participating countries, and the reverse face
is the national side, where each country has printed its own design. All are valid and
accepted in each of the countries.

cards at banks or ATMs as long as you know your PIN, but the interest
rate is high. Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad,
most banks assess a 2 percent fee above the 1 percent fee charged by
Visa or MasterCard or American Express for currency conversion on
credit charges. But credit cards still may be the smart way to go when
you factor in things like exorbitant ATM fees and higher traveler’s-check
exchange rates (and service fees).
Some credit-card companies recommend that you notify them of any
upcoming trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when the
card is used in a foreign destination and end up blocking your charges.
Even if you don’t call your credit-card company in advance, you can
always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is refused —
a good reason to carry the phone number with you. But perhaps the
most important lesson here is to carry more than one card with you on
your trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons, so having a
backup is the smart way to go.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are not really necessary because 24-hour
ATMs allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as needed. Also,
traveler’s checks are not as widely accepted as they used to be, and,
overall, are more trouble than they are worth: They save you the ATM
withdrawal fee, but they can get stolen as cash; you need to show identi-
fication every time you want to cash one, find and then line up at a bank
that will cash them for you; and more often than not you have to pay a
fee to purchase them from your bank or your credit card company
(American Express, MasterCard, and Visa offer them).
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in case they’re stolen or lost.
You get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Taking Taxes into Account
You may not notice taxes in Italy because they’re included in the prices
that you’re quoted, but do know that the value-added tax (known as the
IVA) is a steep 19 percent. The good news is that you can get a refund for
purchases costing more than 155€ ($248). Stores displaying a TAX FREE
sign will give you an invoice that you can cash at the airport’s Customs
office as you leave Italy. You can also have the invoice from the store
stamped at the airport by Customs, and then mail it back to the store,
which will then send you a check or credit your charge account.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Being on vacation is a blissful time of distraction and discovery.
Unfortunately, this makes visitors a ripe target for pickpockets. If you
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 61

discover that your wallet has been lost or stolen, contact all of your
credit-card companies right away. You also want to file a report at the
nearest police precinct (your credit-card company or insurer may require
a police-report number or record of the loss). Most credit-card companies
have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen;
they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an
emergency credit card in a day or two. In Italy, contact these offices:
 American Express (% 06-7220348 or 06-72282 or 06-72461; www.
americanexpress.it)
 Diners Club (% 800-864064866 toll-free within Italy; www.diners
club.com)
 MasterCard (% 800-870866 toll-free within Italy; www.mastercard.
com)
 Visa (% 800-819014 toll-free within Italy; www.visaeu.com)
If you need emergency cash over the weekend, when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license or passport along with your
cash and credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immedi-
ately; placing a fraud alert on your record may protect you against liabil-
ity for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies
are Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-
397-3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your
airline and explain the situation; it may allow you to board the plane if
you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the
police report you’ve filed.
Watch your purse, wallet, briefcase, or backpack in any public place.
When walking on the street, keep your purse on the side away from traf-
fic, so a thief on a motor scooter can’t speed by and grab it from you.
Better yet, carry your money, credit cards, and passport in an interior
pocket, where pickpockets won’t be able to snatch them.

I
f you live near a major city, getting to Italy may be even easier than
reaching another destination in your own country, but it won’t be
cheaper. The recent increase in fuel prices has jacked up airfares signifi-
cantly: A round-trip ticket during peak times will start around $1,200
with a decent advance for your booking, and skyrocket as you try to
book your trip closer to the departure date. Of course, with the cut-
throat competition among airlines, you may be able to lock in a much
better deal, especially if your dates and itinerary are flexible. This chap-
ter outlines all the ways and means you have to make getting to Italy a
snap.
Flying to Italy
Because Italy is long and skinny in shape, flying into one airport at one
end and leaving from another at the other end makes sense, especially if
your time is limited and you want to see sights in both northern and
southern Italy. If, for example, you land in Milan, you can then fly out of
Rome, or fly into Venice and leave from Catania. For the right price, this
plan may save you hundreds of miles of driving or sitting on the train
just to retrace your steps to the airport where you entered the country.
Finding out which airlines fly there
Rome and Milan are Italy’s intercontinental gateways, to which you can
fly nonstop from major hubs all over the world. For other airports in
Italy — Florence, Pisa, Verona, Venice, Naples, Palermo, Catania — you
will have to take a connecting flight.
Alitalia (% 800-223-5730 in the U.S., 800-361-8336 in Canada, 020-
8814-7700 in the U.K., 8-8306-8411 in Australia, or 06-2222 in Italy;
www.alitalia.it), the Italian national airline, offers direct flights to
Rome and Milan from most major destinations in the world. It also offers

connecting flights to every destination in Italy by way of Rome or Milan.
Daily direct flights are scheduled from a number of North American
cities, including New York, Boston, Toronto, and Montreal.
From the United States, most major U.S. airlines, including American
Airlines (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com), Continental (% 800-525-0280;
www.continental.com), Delta (% 800-241-4141; www.delta.com),
Northwest/KLM Airlines (% 800-447-4747; www.nwa.com), United
(% 800-538-2929; www.united.com), and US Airways (% 800-428-4322;
www.usairways.com), offer direct nonstop flights to Rome or Milan, at
least during peak season.
From Canada, Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.com)
offers direct flights between Toronto and Rome.
From Australia, Qantas (% 13-13-13; www.qantas.com) offers direct
flights from Melbourne to Rome on a daily basis, plus flights from
Sydney several days a week.
From Britain, you find direct flights to a number of Italian cities via
Alitalia (% 020-8814-7700; www.alitalia.it) and British Airways
(% 0845-773-3377 in the U.K.; www.britishairways.com). The new 
discount, no-frills options include Ryanair (% 0871-246-0000; www.
ryanair.com) and easyJet (www.easyjet.com).
If you are not adamant about direct flights, you will also have the choice
of all other European carriers, which offer flights to most Italian airports
via their own hubs in Europe: Dublin for Aer Lingus (% 800-IRISH-AIR;
www.aerlingus.ie), Paris for Air France (% 800-237-2747; www.air
france.com), Amsterdam for KLM (% 800-374-7747; www.klm.nl),
London for British Airways (% 800-247-297; www.britishairways.
com), Munich or Frankfurt for Lufthansa (% 800-645-3880; www.
lufthansa-usa.com), and so on (see Appendix A for more choices).
You have the added advantage of flying into Italy’s less expensive sec-
ondary airports, such as Venice, Florence, Naples, or Catania.
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Business travelers who need the flexibility of buying their tickets at the
last minute and changing their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and
who want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their com-
panies pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But you can often
qualify for the least expensive price, which will be several hundreds —
or even thousands — of dollars lower than the full fare.
Keep in mind that the lowest-priced fares are often nonrefundable,
require advance purchase and a certain length of stay, have date-of-
travel restrictions, and carry penalties for changing dates of travel.
For Italy, the high season is long, and snagging low fares is increasingly
difficult; at certain times, you may be lucky just to get on any plane
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy

heading for Italy. But fear not: You don’t have to pay top dollar for your
airline seat. Here are some tips on scoring the best airfare:
 Book in advance and be flexible. Fares can vary thousands of dol-
lars, just depending on the season and on how far in advance you
book. Changing the day of the week you travel can save a couple 
of hundred dollars. Passengers who can book their ticket far in
advance (21 days at least), who can stay over Saturday night, and
who are willing to travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday will
pay a fraction of the full fare. If your schedule is flexible, say so —
ask if you can secure a cheaper fare by staying an extra day, by
flying midweek, or by traveling during off-peak hours.
 Shop around for specials. Airlines periodically hold sales, which
tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume — for Italy, that
means the dead of winter. As you plan your vacation, keep your
eyes open for sales advertised in newspapers and online.
Remember that if you already hold a ticket when a sale breaks,
exchanging your ticket, which usually incurs a $100 to $150 fee,
may pay off.
 Consider non-direct flights. On any day of the week, you can get a
connecting flight through a major European city with a European
national carrier (see earlier in this chapter). In order to encourage
travelers to choose a non-direct alternative, round-trip rates are
often handsomely discounted, and connections usually involve a
layover of no more than an hour or two. If your destination in Italy
is not Rome or Milan, by connecting in major European hubs, you
can also fly directly to any Italian secondary airport.
 Join frequent-flier clubs. Accruing miles with one program is best,
as it lets you rack up free flights and achieve elite status faster. But
opening as many accounts as possible makes sense, too, no matter
how seldom you fly a particular airline. It’s free, and you get the
best choice of seats, faster response to phone inquiries, and
prompter service if your luggage is stolen, if your flight is canceled
or delayed, or if you want to change your seat.
Cutting costs by using consolidators
You can also check consolidators, also known as bucket shops. Start by
looking in the Sunday newspaper’s travel section; U.S. travelers should
focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and Miami Herald. Several
reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Web. STA Travel
(% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), leader in student travel, offers
good fares for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress (% 800-TRAV-800; www.
flights.com) started in Europe and has excellent fares worldwide.
Flights.com also has “local” Web sites in 12 countries. FlyCheap, another
industry leader, has become Lowestfare.com (www.lowestfare.com) and
is now owned by Priceline (see later in this chapter). Air Tickets Direct
(% 800-778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.com) is based in Montreal and
leverages the currently weak Canadian dollar for low fares.
Chapter 6: Getting to Italy 65

Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 to 75 percent of the ticket price.
Some consolidators will also put you on charter airlines with question-
able safety records.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies — Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com) —
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also
send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available to
your favorite destination. Of the smaller sites, SideStep (www.side-
step.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a browser add-on that
purports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality only beats competi-
tors’ fares as often as other sites do.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are valid
only for travel that weekend, but some can be booked weeks or months
in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at airline Web sites or check
mega-sites that compile comprehensive lists of last-minute specials,
such as Smarter Living (smarterliving.com). For last-minute trips,
www.lastminute.com often has better deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for travel
on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a mysteri-
ous change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major, well-
known carriers — and the possibility of being sent hither and yon before
you arrive in Italy is remote. But your chances of getting a less desirable
flying time are pretty high. For example, Hotwire has a “no red-eye”
option, but be aware that it thinks a 6 a.m. flight for which you have to be
at the airport two hours in advance (it’s hardly worth putting on your
jammies, is it?) is not a red-eye. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you
buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to play
its “name our price” game — and with each try, you have to change
something besides your bid, which is to prevent people from making end-
less iterations. If you have fixed travel dates, better make a realistic bid
to start or you have to change them or look elsewhere. In order to cover
all the bases, Priceline has created/purchased Lowestfare.com
(www.lowestfare.com), in which you don’t have to bid for seats.

Arriving by Other Means
You may be adding Italy to a more extensive European vacation, or per-
haps you live in Britain or Ireland. Although usually it’s cheaper and
faster to fly, you may be looking for other ways to get to Italy. We don’t
recommend driving, however, even if it may appear tempting: The drive
is not only expensive (with gasoline at over $11 a gallon in Europe, plus
high tolls on highways), but also long and exhausting unless you have
unlimited time (we once drove from Brittany to Rome in three days and
are not keen on repeating the experience). Here are your other options:
 Train: Railroads in Europe offer cheap, reliable, fast, and frequent
service. Italy is very well connected to all major European destina-
tions, often by high-speed trains: Paris, for example, is connected to
Italy by high-speed TGV trains to Torino and Milan, and by the
famous Palatino, the convenient overnight train to Rome. On most
lines, you can chose between first and second class: Second class is
perfectly acceptable, offering seats that are as comfortable as those
in first class. It makes sense to travel first class only during peak
times, when second class tends to be overcrowded, or for overnight
trips, to enjoy the comfortable first-class wagon-lit (personal sleeping
cabins). Available from most major destinations within Europe and
Italy, overnight trains can save you time and the expense of a hotel
night. If you are planning an extensive use of rail connections, a rail
pass will save you money, but not the hassle of making reservations
and purchasing tickets: the best trains in Italy require you to pay a
supplement and secure a seat reservation (see Chapter 7 for more on
taking the train in Italy). If you are a resident of any European country
except Italy, you can get an InterRail pass granting unlimited first- or
second-class rail travel within one or more countries of the European
Community. You can purchase it directly from Trenitalia, the Italian
national train service (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it). The pass
comes in several versions and durations; for example, an adult pass
valid for eight days of first-class travel in Italy during one month costs
309€ ($494), while a global pass valid for one month of unlimited
first-class travel within the whole European Community costs 809€
($1,294). If you aren’t a resident of Europe, you can get a Eurail pass.
An adult pass valid for eight days of first-class travel in Italy during
two month costs $454, and your one-month global pass $1,281. The
passes also give you discounts on certain buses and ferries, such as
the ferry from Naples to Palermo. Most travel and rail agents in major
cities such as New York, Montreal, and Los Angeles sell it, and the
pass is also available through Rail Europe (% 877-456-RAIL in the
U.S.; www.raileurope.com).
 Ferry: Several ferry companies service the Mediterranean; you can
get a ferry to one of Italy’s major harbors ( Genoa, Livorno, Naples,
Salerno, Palermo, Catania, Bari, Ancona, and Venice ( from a
number of countries in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.
For example, Naples-based Grimaldi Ferries (% 081-496444;
Chapter 6: Getting to Italy 67

www.grimaldi-ferries.com) offers service between Salerno and
Palermo (Sicily), Malta, Tunis, and Valencia (Spain). Medmar
(% 081-5513352; www.medmargroup.it) service runs between
Tunis and Naples; SNAV (% 081-4285555; www.snav.it) between
Naples, Sicily, and Greece; and Minoan Lines (% 877-465-2697 in
the U.S.; www.minoan.gr) between Venice, Ancona, and Greece.
 Bus: The leading operator of scheduled coach services across
Europe is Eurolines (% 0990-143-219; www.eurolines.com), which
runs buses to Italy from London’s Victoria Coach Station. Its com-
prehensive network serves Turin, Milan, Bologna, Florence, and
Rome — plus summer routes to Verona, Vicenza, Padua, and Venice.
Joining an Escorted Tour
Escorted tours have numerous advantages: The tour company takes care
of all the details — from the itinerary to the meals, hotels, and attractions
tickets and reservations — and your group leader smoothes down all the
occasional bumps along the way. You know what to expect at each leg of
your journey; you know what your vacation costs upfront; and you won’t
face many surprises. Fans of escorted tours know that they can take you
to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of time with
the least amount of hassle. In this section, we give some tips on how to
choose the escorted tour that best fits your vacation needs.
If you decide to take an escorted tour, we strongly recommend buying
travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks you to pay upfront.
It’s wise to buy travel insurance through an independent agency. (See
Chapter 10 for more about the ins and outs of travel insurance.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the tour operator cancel the
trip if they don’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you
are unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If they cancel?
 How jampacked is the schedule? Does the tour organizer try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or is there ample time for relaxing
and/or shopping? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not returning
to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. at night sounds like a grind, certain
escorted tours may not be for you.
 How big is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, as they may not know the exact size of
the group until everybody has made reservations, but they should
be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some operators have a minimum
group size, and may cancel the tour if they don’t book enough
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
68

people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close they are
to reaching it.
 What is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to pay to
get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be included
in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. How much flexibility do
you have? Can you opt out of certain activities, or does the bus
leave once a day, with no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in
advance? Can you choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody
get the same chicken cutlet?
Local travel agencies can be an excellent source for regional tours. For
example, Compagnia Siciliana Turismo (CST), Via E. Amari 124, 90139
Palermo (% 091-582294; www.compagniasicilianaturismo.it), is
one of the best choices for a tour of Sicily, offering anything from short
two- or three-day tours to longer two-week ones. A large number of inter-
national companies specialize in escorted Italian tours. Here is a brief
list of the most reliable operators:
 Italiatour (% 800-283-7262; www.italiatour.com), part of the
Alitalia Group, offers a variety of tours: from single-activity tours
(such as a one-day cooking class in Sicily, or a tour of Florence) to
days-long tours that cover the whole country. This is the only tour
operator with a desk right at the airport (at Fiumicino, in Rome) and
native expertise — plus the tours are very competitively priced.
 Perillo Tours, 577 Chestnut Ridge Rd., Woodcliff Lake, NJ 07675-
9888 (% 800-431-1515 or 201-307-1234; www.perillotours.com),
has been in business for more than half a century. Its itineraries
range from 8 to 15 days and are very diverse. Optional excursions
are offered (at an extra charge) to allow you to customize your tour
somewhat. Perillo tries to cover all the bases, and even has a pack-
age to help you get married in Italy.
 Globus+Cosmos Tours (% 877-245-6287; www.globusand
cosmos.com) offers various first-class escorted coach tours, lasting
from 8 to 16 days.
 Insight Vacations (% 800-582-8380 or +44-1475-741203; www.insight
vacations.com), a competitor to Globus+Cosmos, books superior
first-class, fully escorted motor-coach tours.
 Central Holidays (% 800-539-7098; www.centralholidays.com)
offers fully escorted tours in addition to its packages. Several levels
of tours — and levels of “escort” — are offered.
 For luxurious tours, you can also try Abercrombie & Kent,
1520 Kensington Rd., Oak Brook, IL 60523 (% 800-554-7016; www.
abercrombiekent.com; London address: Sloan Square House,
Holbein Place, London SW1W 8NS; % 020-7730-9600).
A number of agencies focus on special-interest tours, ranging from archae-
ology to cuisine to biking or spelunking. Tour Italy Now (% 800-955-4418;
www.touritalynow.com) leads biking and hiking tours, La Dolce Vita
Chapter 6: Getting to Italy 69

Wine Tours (% 888-746-0022; www.dolcetours.com) focuses — you
guessed — on wine, and Amelia Tours International (% 800-742-4591 or
516-433-0696) concentrates on archaeology with an eye on food and wine.
Good online resources for specialty tours and travel include the
Specialty Travel Index (% 888-624-4030; www.specialtytravel.com),
which offers a comprehensive selection of Italian tours, from ballooning
to mushroom hunting to river cruises; Shaw Guides (% 212-799-6464;
www.shawguides.com), with links to a substantial number of Italy
options, from archaeological programs to falconry excursions to tours
for opera fans; and InfoHub Specialty Travel Guide (% 408-329-1125;
www.infohub.com).
Choosing a Package Tour
Package tours — airfare-plus-hotel bundles to which excursions or activi-
ties may be added — can be a smart way to go. In many cases, a package
including airfare, hotel, and transportation to and from the airport costs
less than the hotel alone on a trip you book yourself. That’s because
packages are sold in bulk to tour operators, who resell them to the
public. Package tours can vary widely. Some offer a better class of hotels
than others; others provide the same hotels for lower prices. Some book
flights on scheduled airlines; others sell charter flights. With some pack-
ages, your choice of accommodations and travel days may be limited.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of travel magazines such as Travel +
Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler. Liberty
Travel (% 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) is one of the
biggest packagers in the Northeast of the U.S., and usually has a full-
page ad in the Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines, including American Airlines Vacations (% 800-321-2121;
www.aavacations.com), Continental Airlines Vacations (% 800-301-3800;
www.coolvacations.com), Delta Vacations (% 800-654-6559; www.delta
vacations.com), United Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.united
vacations.com), and US Airways Vacations (% 800-455-0123; www.
usairwaysvacations.com), offer air/land packages.
Several big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, 
and Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re
unsure about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better
Business Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go online to
www.bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, take your
business elsewhere.
The escorted-tour operators discussed earlier also offer packages;
Italiatour, in particular, specializes in packages for independent travelers
who ride from one destination to another by train or rental car. Another
recommended packager is Kemwel (% 800-678-0678; www.kemwel.com).

hances are you want to explore the country instead of staying in
just one place. Here is all the information you need to travel
throughout Italy, plus a few tips for choosing the type of transportation
that best suits your plans. We also provide a comparison of travel times
between major destinations using different modes of transportation.
In Italy, you can get virtually anywhere via public transportation — and
quite easily: Where the air and rail systems stop, the bus system takes
over, and gets you into even the smallest hamlets in the countryside,
with at least a few runs per day. The largest towns and cities are con-
nected so seamlessly — with buses, planes, and trains leaving every few
minutes — that not using public transportation is foolish unless you
have special reasons to need a car.
By Plane
Air travel is no longer — or not necessarily — the most expensive way of
getting from one destination to another within Italy. It also has the added
advantage of being fast, especially if you want to travel from one tip of the
peninsula to the other. Alitalia (% 800-223-5730 in the U.S. or 06-2222
from within Italy; www.alitalia.it), the national carrier, offers flights 
to every destination in the country. Other great resources are Air One
(% 199-207080 from within Italy, or 06-4888069; www.flyairone.it);
Meridiana (% 0789-52682; www.meridiana.it); and the low-cost Wind
Jet (% 892020 from within Italy; www.volawindjet.it).
When traveling on domestic flights in Italy, you can get a 30 percent dis-
count if you take a flight that departs at night.
Table 7-1 provides the travel times between major Italian cities using dif-
ferent modes of transportation.

By Train
Train travel in Italy is affordable, comfortable, and fast, with trains
serving practically every destination. Trains are the best choice for
medium-distance trips, as they are usually faster than driving, and
sometimes even than flying. We also like overnight trains for longer
trips provided you choose the comfort and safety of a private, first-
class sleeper cabin. Trains also have the added advantage of extreme
flexibility and convenience — you depart and arrive right from the
center of town, and can usually get a seat even at the last minute. The
best trains by far are high-speed trains AV (Alta Velocità), express
trains ES (Eurostar), and IC (intercity), which stop only at major cities
and often continue to destinations beyond Italy. You need to make a
seat reservation and pay a supplement to board, but the high-quality
seating (practically equal in second and first class) and faster connec-
tions are well worth the extra money. Tip: Avoid the slow local trains
marked D (diretto) stopping at all the smallest stations and the only
marginally faster regional trains R (regionali); you can board these
with your basic ticket or pass, but they are truly useful only in reach-
ing destinations way off the beaten path.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
72

Tickets are sold at ticket booths inside train stations (in the smallest sta-
tions they open only just before a train is due), automatic vending
machines located inside most stations, or from many travel agents. At
Trenitalia (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it), you can check schedules
and prices for all destinations and purchase your tickets and passes
with a 5 percent discount on the ticket booth price. The discount grows
to 20 percent if you purchase your ticket at least two days in advance,
provided discounted seats are still available. All tickets need to be
stamped at the yellow machines at the station before boarding. To
research how well your chosen destinations are served by rail, see the
“Train Routes through Italy” map on the inside front cover of this book.
For a number of popular destinations not served by ES trains, you can
now book a transfer on a luxury coach via ES link (you book and pur-
chase your train and coach ticket at the same time).
If you are planning a lot of train travel, you may be interested in purchas-
ing a pass (see Chapter 6), but we don’t recommend it for your average
holiday in Italy: You still need to buy tickets for private rail lines such as
the Naples-Sorrento Circumvesuviana, plus make reservations and pur-
chase supplements as they apply for InterCity, Eurostar, and AV trains.
Tip: Don’t put your feet up on the seat opposite you, or you may be in
for a steep fine!
By Bus
The bus (coach) network is very extensive in Italy, and buses connect
even the most remote hamlets in the country. They are a good way to
reach destinations that are not on a direct train line. We list bus compa-
nies throughout this book for those destinations where taking a bus
makes sense. You won’t see too many tourists on buses, which is good if
you want to meet local people and get a feeling for what life is really like
in Italy. It’s not like the U.S. or England, where you could sit there in a
clown suit and everyone would be too “polite” to speak to you. Italians
will ask you who you are, where you’re from, and where you’re going.
And if you invest just a few hours in familiarizing yourself with Italian
(through Italian For Dummies, for example), you may be able to give
some interesting answers.
Be sure to check schedules in advance — they change frequently.
Tickets must be bought at the bus station or, in smaller towns, at the
local bar; drivers don’t have the cash to make change. Do not plan on
using the bus to hit several small towns in a day — the bus schedules
usually won’t allow for it. The system is meant not for tourists, but for
people who need to commute between the small towns where they live
and the larger towns of the area. To see five little countryside villages in
a day requires a car.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Italy 73

By Ferry
With over 4,600 miles of Italian coastline, ferries are an excellent resource,
particularly to explore many destinations in the Neapolitan area — 
Capri, Sorrento, and the Amalfi Coast (see Chapter 20) — and Sicily (see
Chapters 21 and 22). We also favor them over the train or plane for long
distances, as overnight ferries often have comfortable cabins. See the indi-
vidual destination chapters for recommended local ferry service.
If you want to bring your car on a ferry, you must make a reservation
well in advance — especially during high season. Taking your car on a
ferry also means you have to pay more. In most cases, you save money
and hassle by renting your car on arrival rather than taking it on a ferry.
By Car
While we definitely do not recommend driving between major towns in
Italy (you do much better via public transportation, without having to
worry about parking, expensive gas, and highway tolls), and driving in
major towns and cities is pure madness, driving through the Italian
countryside may be appealing. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
 In order to drive in Italy, you need to get an International Driver’s
License before leaving home. In the United States and Canada, you
can do so at any branch of AAA (% 800-222-1134 in the U.S.,
613-247-0117 in Canada; www.aaa.com) by filling out a form and pro-
viding a 2-×-2-inch photograph of yourself, a photocopy of your U.S.
driver’s license, and $10. Don’t forget to bring your U.S. license with
you in Italy, however, because the international license is valid only
in combination with your regular license. An alternative to the
International Driver’s License is to take an Italian translation of your
U.S. license (prepared by AAA or another organization) to an office
of the Automobile Club d’Italia (% 06-4477 for 24-hour information
and assistance) in Italy to receive a special driving permit.
 Renting a car will be more expensive than what you’re used to back
home (see later in this section for a few tips), plus you have to con-
sider fuel (at over $11 a gallon), hefty highway tolls, parking, car
theft, and an aggressive driving style.
 Driving rules are different here (see the sidebar later in this chap-
ter). We recommend that you: 1) drive defensively, and 2) always
be ready to get out of the way. It’s a myth that Italians drive badly.
Italians love to drive; however, there’s a reason why the Ferrari, the
Maserati, and the Lamborghini are Italian cars — Italians love to
drive fast. You could be going a respectable 60 mph when someone
zooms up from behind, going 100 mph and flashing his lights (a per-
fect time to apply Rule #2, above). Italians do, however, follow the
rules of the road and are usually skilled drivers (they need to be or

 Road signs are also different. On local roads and in town, the puz-
zling sign with a white arrow on a blue circle points you to the lane
that you should enter or the correct way around an obstacle, a traf-
fic island, and so forth. When you want to park, look for the blue-
and-red circle with a diagonal stripe: The stripe points to the side
of the street where you can’t park. If the sign shows two stripes (an
X), you can’t park on either side. The oblong blue-and-white Senso
Unico sign indicates a one-way street.
 For long distances it makes sense to use the high-speed, limited-
access toll roads called autostrade, and avoid the traffic-infested
local roads, unless you have unlimited time. They are very well
maintained, with state-of-the-art fueling stations and snack bars,
and impose a minimum (90km/56mph) and maximum speed
(130km/81mph); though you’ll undoubtedly experience the thrill of
being passed by a car speeding past at 180km/112mph. Tolls are
calculated based on the size of your car and the cost of mainte-
nance for that specific stretch of road (mountain roads cost more
than valleys); for example, the toll for an average car traveling
between Rome and Salerno is about 13€ ($20). You can calculate
the cost of your trip in advance on www.autostrade.it (though
the site is in Italian only). Major destinations are usually served by
both a local road and an autostrada. Look for a sign bearing the
name of your destination (for example VENEZIA, for Venice), and
keep in mind that access roads to the autostrada are indicated by
green signs, whereas local roads by blue signs. One last word of
advice: Pay attention to the number of your exit (Uscita) when it is
posted, and prepare yourself as you pass the exit before yours;
your exit sign will be right on top of the ramp.
 Even Italians dread driving in and near big cities and towns —
Naples, Rome, and Milan are particularly notorious — not only
because of the intricate network of roads, but also due to the con-
stant traffic, the aggressive driving style, and the impossibility of
finding parking. If you’re planning to rent a car, we recommend that
you do so from the airport, before or after your visit to a major city;
you won’t need a car during your stay in town.
 When arriving in a town, park only inside the painted lines and pay
attention to their color: If they are white, you can park for as long
as you wish; if they are blue, you can park but you need to pay; if
yellow, that area is only for deliveries or unloading (in front of your
hotel for example). As parking is always at a premium in Italy, traf-
fic police are very vigilant, and parking tickets are liberally distrib-
uted. To avoid getting one, make sure you pay by finding the
nearest automated parking machine, inserting coins until your
expected time of return shows on the digital display, printing the
receipt (usually by pressing the green button), and posting your
parking receipt on your dashboard. Some areas bestow nighttime
grace periods; check the signs for your specific parking spot. Be
sure to carry enough change: Parking tariffs range from between 1
to 3 € ($1.60–$4.80) per hour.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Italy 75

 Local gas stations close for lunch and shut down all day on Sunday
(except along the autostrada), so don’t let your gas gauge get too
low, especially if you’re cruising the rural countryside.
 If you do rent a car, remember that Italian cars are small (even the
big ones are never larger than an American midsize), and trunks,
compared to U.S. cars, are minuscule. If you are planning to rent a
car, pack accordingly. If you can, brush up on manual shift driving
before your trip: You have more options and save a considerable
amount on your rental.
 Car thefts and break-ins are widespread. Never leave your car unat-
tended, always lock up, take out all your valuable items, and never
leave luggage in a car unless it’s parked in a small, manned garage.
 Finally, make sure you have a good road map: The best are pub-
lished by the Automobile Club d’Italia and the Italian Touring Club
and are widely available in bookstores and at newsstands in Italy. A
lot of highway construction is going on in Italy, so maps change
often.
Go online to comparison-shop for car rentals. You can check rates at
most of the major car-rental agencies’ Web sites (see Appendix A for a list
of agencies operating in Italy). All the major travel sites — Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com), Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz
(www.orbitz.com), and Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com), for
example — have search engines that can dig up discounted car-rental
rates. If you are planning to travel by a combination of train and car,
check with Trenitalia (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it), the national
train service, for special car-rental and train package offers.

The rules of the road
The following rules are rigidly obeyed everywhere in Italy:
Rule 1: Pass only on the left.
Rule 2: Never stay in the passing lane: Pull out, pass, and get back in the slow lane
right away.
Rule 3: When you’re entering a highway or any major road from a minor road and you
have a sign to yield, you do have to yield. Often this means stopping and waiting for the
merging lane to become available. Do not assume people will move over — they won’t
(often they can’t, as there’s always someone coming from behind at over 100 mph in
the fast lane). The same is true when you come out of a gas station or rest area.
Rule 4: At regular intersections, the person on the right always has the right of way,
unless otherwise indicated; in traffic circles, the cars already in the circle have prior-
ity over those trying to enter.

Car rental companies in Italy usually require a minimum age of 25
(although it is sometimes possible to reduce it to 21 for cheaper models
(and often have a maximum age limit of 75. You need one credit card (not
debit or prepaid) for regular models and two for deluxe cars. Automatic
cars rent at a premium and are rare.
In Italy, most rental companies require that you pay for theft protection
insurance, as car theft is unfortunately common here. Although many
credit cards cover you for damage to a rental car, check with your com-
pany to see if your card’s benefit extends outside the United States. In
addition to the basic car-rental charges, the Collision Damage Waiver
(CDW) requires you to pay for damage to the car in a collision. Rental-
car companies also offer extra liability insurance (if you harm others in
an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm yourself or your
passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your luggage is stolen
from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at home probably
covers most of these unlikely occurrences, and unless you are carrying
the Hope diamond, you probably don’t need luggage coverage. However,
if your own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have
auto insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your
car-rental agent for more information). Also, check with your credit-card
company, as it may cover some of the above.

 Avoiding getting stuck without a place to sleep
T
raveling to a foreign country can be romantic and exciting, but when
we’re ready for a well-deserved slumber, we like the comforts we’ve
grown accustomed to. Although the hotel industry in Italy has made enor-
mous progress toward standardization and upgrading of lodgings, in line
with the expectations of international travelers, there are still cultural dif-
ferences that are hard to iron out — and why not, since the fun of travel-
ing also means experiencing a different culture. That’s not to say you
shouldn’t be comfortable, though. Here we give you the lowdown on what
to expect in your Italian bedroom, along with plenty of tips on choosing
from among a wide, and in some cases unfamiliar, variety of choices.
Getting to Know Your Options
Italy offers a huge choice of accommodations, from very basic to
supremely elegant. You’ll find everything from romantic 15th-century
hostels to international chains, from perfectly restored medieval towers
and castles to 17th-century frescoed palazzi, from simple 19th-century
farmhouses to ultra-modern luxury hotels, and from mom-and-pop
places to the haunts of jet-setters. Travelers have journeyed to Italy for
the past 3,000 years (at least), so more than a few inns can claim several
centuries of service and make tradition their selling point. In contrast, a
lot of newer options focus instead on sleek modern touches or immacu-
late refurbishing of historic buildings. With such a variety, you’ll cer-
tainly find what you need, but keep in mind a few differences:
 Because medieval and Renaissance buildings were not designed for
elevators, these are rare — and altogether absent in the cheaper
hotels — and often start from a landing above street level. Steps are
ubiquitous, so if they’re a problem for you, make sure to call and ask.

 Amenities that are commonplace in the United States — big ice
machines, for instance — are virtually unknown in Italy (you will
find, though, a small refrigerator in all hotel rooms in the superior
category); others, such as air-conditioning and satellite TV — nec-
essary to view English-language programs — are now more the rule
than the exception, although you may have to pay extra for them in
smaller and cheaper hotels (we spell this out in our write-ups). By
the way, regular TVs are standard in all hotel rooms, but they don’t
offer English-language programs. Then again, you didn’t go to Italy
to watch TV, did you? And you can always step out of your hotel
and sit at the terrace of a nearby cafe for that iced drink.
 Soundproof rooms are commonplace — and even in the cheaper
hotels, the thickness of the old walls helps protect you from noisy
neighbors and the roar of traffic outside. Street noise, by the way, is a
problem that soundproof windows cannot eliminate if you like to sleep
with your window open. If that is the case, ask for an inner room.
 Smoking is banned from public places in Italy, so all hotel lobbies
and breakfast rooms are smoke-free. Guest rooms, however, are
considered private; hence, you are allowed to smoke there. Make
sure to specify whether you want a smoke-free room when you
make your reservation.
 In general, rooms — especially bathrooms — tend to be smaller
than what you’re used at home. Space is at a premium, especially in
the palaces within historic districts — which is where you usually
want to be — and only the most expensive hotels can offer sizable
bedrooms and bathrooms. To meet the increasing demand for
ensuite facilities, many cheaper hotels (two stars and below; see
later for more on this) have shoehorned bathrooms into the guest
rooms, and the result is far from satisfactory: It’s not at all unusual
for the shower to be a wall fixture with a curtain around it (not a
door) and a drain directly below it in the tiny bathroom’s tiled floor.
The hotels we list all have decent-size bathrooms and real showers.
 The majority of hotels in Italy have only one kind of bed — a large
twin. In a double room, you usually find two separate twin beds. If
you ask for a double bed, they will put together the two twins,
making the bed up tight with sheets. You may find this practice
unusual at first, but you’ll discover that it’s not uncomfortable. On
the plus side, most hotels in Italy, and certainly all the ones in our
listings, are proud of the quality of their bedding and provide good
mattresses with a medium degree of firmness.
 The breakfast generally included in your room rate is a continental
breakfast. Although an increasing number of hotels offer a buffet with
a variety of choices to meet the demands of foreign visitors, eggs and
hot dishes are routinely served only at the most expensive hotels.
The usual continental buffet includes a choice of breads, jams, and
fruit; sometimes cakes; and usually cereals, yogurt, cheese, and cold
cuts. Sometimes you can order — and pay extra for — eggs and
bacon if they aren’t on the spread.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 79

 One more thing: When you make a hotel reservation back home,
you probably don’t think to ask about the flooring. In Italy, you’ll
often find tile or marble floors, sometimes wood, and only rarely
carpeting. So bring slippers in the cooler months if you don’t want
to get cold feet — unless you are checking in at a more expensive
hotel, where they will be provided.
All hotels in Italy are government-rated according to a strict set of rules
and specifications. The system is quite reliable, as hotels are regularly
inspected. The rating goes from one star for the most modest hotel — a
basic room with a comfortable bed, a TV, and a shared small bathroom —
to five stars for the most elegant, with an L added for extra luxury (such
as palatial accommodations with state-of-the-art bathrooms). A pensione
is below a hotel: a small, family-run hostel offering rooms with a bed and
little else. A bed-and-breakfast is a room in a private house and can range
from palatial to spartan. In the countryside, you can opt for agriturismo: a
room in a working farmhouse, where you’ll be served meals prepared
almost exclusively with ingredients produced on the farm. In this cate-
gory, too, accommodations range from palatial (for example, on famous
wine-producing estates) to simple (but usually always very nice). They
often feature swimming pools and outdoor activities.
Throughout this book, we list our favorite hotels, using cleanliness, com-
fort, and the most amenities at the best prices as essential criteria. We
use a system of dollar signs to indicate the price categories. Table 8-1,
below, explains the price scale used in this book and what you can
expect to get for your money in each category.

ties ranging from antique furnishings
and fine linens to lavish bathrooms,
gyms, spas, terraces, and often gar-
dens with pools. Usually an American-
style breakfast is included. You’re
staying not only in luxury, but also style.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
Although this is slowly changing, most hotels in Italy are private busi-
nesses, don’t belong to a chain, and are often still family-run, including
in the super-luxury category. Some may belong to a hotel association —
which fixes standards, gives a common approach, or simply allows some
economies of scale — while others may belong to a group of investors.
This means that room hunting follows different rules. Following are
some tips on reserving your room and cutting your costs.
Finding the best rate
The “rack rate” is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. The
rack rate is the price you’d get if you walked in off the street at the peak
of high season, when the hotel is nearly full, and asked for a room for the
night. You see this rate printed on the fire/emergency-exit diagrams
posted on the back of room doors. We quote the rack rate for each of
our hotel listings throughout this book, but it doesn’t mean that’s the
rate you’ll have to pay.
Sometimes getting a better rate is surprisingly simple: Ask for a cheaper
or discounted rate. You may be pleasantly surprised.
Rates are also lower — by up to 50 percent — during low and shoulder
seasons, when the hotel occupancy goes down (see Chapter 3).
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 81

If your hotel belongs to a chain, you’ll usually get the lowest rate
through a travel agent, online reservations service (see later), or pack-
age deal with your airline (see Chapter 6). (This is because the hotel
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her busi-
ness toward that hotel.) Reserving a room through the chain’s toll-free
number may also result in a lower rate than calling the hotel directly.
Privately owned hotels, by contrast, do only moderate business with
travel agencies and reservations Web sites. You’ll often get a better dis-
count by contacting the hotel directly or through its Web site (and be
treated much better upon arrival).
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or by going through an independent
booking agency (or a fare-service agency like Priceline).
In Italy, booking through the hotel’s own Web site is definitely the way to
go: Many private hotels have started to offer special Internet rates,
which are often even cheaper than what an agency can offer (because
the hotel saves the agency fee). Some also offer significant discounts for
advance booking, provided that you pay in advance. If you don’t want to
search the hotels yourself, use one of the Internet agencies below and
then go straight to the Web site of the hotel you’ve selected: You’ll often
find that you can do better. (For hotels belonging to a chain, however,
this is not always the case.)
Online hotel agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late,
competing for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accom-
modations around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to
consumers who have the patience and time to shop and compare the
Internet agencies for good deals — but shop they must, for prices can
vary considerably from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the
top of a site’s listing may be there for no other reason than that they
paid money to get the placement. A huge number of websites compete
for the privilege of booking your hotel room, but not all of them are
trustworthy. The best and most reliable is Venere Net
(www.venere.com), which is very comprehensive and user-friendly,
includes good descriptions of the properties, offers traveler feedback,
and has a last-minute reservation engine.
Most international sites tend to feature only a few hotels in Italy. Still,
some may offer good deals, so it’s worth checking just in case. Expedia
offers special deals and “virtual tours” or photos of available rooms —
allowing you to see what you’re paying for (a feature that helps counter
the claims that the best rooms are often held back from bargain Web
sites). Travelocity posts frank customer reviews and ranks its proper-
ties according to the AAA rating system. InnSite.com, which includes
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
82

listings of B&Bs in Rome, shows descriptions written by the innkeepers
(it’s free to get listed), pictures of the rooms, and prices and availability.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel — but that’s all — before offer-
ing up your money. Priceline’s hotel product is much better at getting
five-star lodging for three-star prices than at finding anything at the
bottom of the scale. On the downside, many hotels stick Priceline guests
in their least desirable rooms. Before bidding on Priceline, make sure to
go to BiddingForTravel.com, which features a fairly up-to-date list of
hotels that Priceline uses in major cities, including Italian ones. For both
Priceline and Hotwire, you pay upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable.
Note: Some hotels do not provide loyalty program credits or points or
other frequent-stay amenities when you book a room through opaque
online services.
If you use one of these online booking services, remember to always get
a confirmation number and make a printout of any transaction. In fact,
after you’ve reserved your room, it doesn’t hurt to contact your hotel
and request a faxed confirmation (make sure you bring this with you to
Italy) to eliminate the chance of your checking into a hotel that suddenly
says it has no record of your reservation.
Reserving the best room
First and foremost, make your reservations well ahead of time (months
in advance for the most sought-after destinations), especially if you
decide to stay in a small hotel: The best rooms are the first to go. And
ask for a large and quiet room, specifying all the characteristics that are
important to you.
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in the
house. Requesting a corner room (usually larger, quieter, and brighter
than standard rooms in modern, square buildings) doesn’t necessarily
pay off in Italy, where so many hotels are housed in historic buildings,
and where corner rooms might actually be smaller and darker.
The prevalence of old buildings raises another issue: renovations.
Always ask if the hotel is renovating; if it is, request a room away from
the renovation work. Inquire, too, about the location of elevators, restau-
rants, and bars in the hotel — all sources of annoying noise. If the hotel
is on a busy street, request a room away from the street.
And finally, remember that if you aren’t happy with your room when you
arrive, you can talk to the front desk about moving to another one. If
another room is available, they should be happy to accommodate you,
within reason.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 83

Renting Apartments and Villas
If you plan to stay in one place for a week or more, or if you are traveling
with children, renting a house or apartment makes a lot of sense. The
easiest way to do so is to contact an agency.
Most of the Internet agencies listed earlier in this chapter also maintain
apartment and B&B listings. Other agencies to try include Hideaways
International, 767 Islington St., Portsmouth, NH 03801 (% 800-843-4433;
www.hideaways.com); At Home Abroad, 405 E. 56th St., Suite 6H, New
York, NY 10022 (% 212-421-9165; www.athomeabroadinc.com); and
Rentals in Italy, 700 E. Main St., Ventura, CA 93001 (% 800-726-6702;
www.rentvillas.com).
Vacation Rentals by Owner (www.vrbo.com) has hundreds of listings
(in English) of homes for rent. Each listing contains pictures, prices, and
descriptions of the area where the house or apartment is located.
Usually you deal directly with the owner, thus you may save consider-
ably over the rates that would be charged for the same property by a
broker.
To rent something really ritzy, like a palazzo or castle, your best bet is
Abitare la Storia, Località L’Amorosa, 53048 Sinalunga (% 0322-772156;
www.abitarelastoria.it), an association based near Siena.
Another option — a favorite with Italians — is agriturismo (staying on a
working farm or former farm somewhere in the countryside). Rates usu-
ally include breakfast and at least one other meal (your choice of dinner
or lunch), prepared with ingredients produced on the farm or by nearby
local small farms. Among the multiplying online agencies, the best is
Agriturismo.it (www.agriturismo.it).

very traveler is a special traveler, but bringing kids along on your
trip to Italy or trying to find or arrange for wheelchair accessibility
both require extra care and thought. Seniors may be interested in 
special programs and activities; gays and lesbians may wonder how
friendly and welcoming Italy will be. All these issues are considered in
this chapter.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Italy has a very family-oriented culture, which makes it easy to travel
here with your kids. In fact, Italians love children, and most people will
smile at you and your children and even talk to them in public spaces.
You find that people — including staff in hotels and restaurants — are
usually ready to help you out in most situations and accommodate your
children’s special needs.
We also find that Italy is an easy destination for children because there
are so many attractions to choose from — you’re sure to find something
that will please even the most difficult child (we make reservations
about teenagers, though, since sometimes just nothing pleases them).
Our strategy is to alternate: one thing that interests us and one that
interests our child (in our case, playgrounds, children’s museums, or
outdoor activities) per day. It helps if you talk to your kids beforehand
about your destinations and the special things in store for them. Italian
history is so rich that you may find many ways to keep your child inter-
ested while preparing for your trip. Involve your children in the planning
and go over the list of sights and activities in the areas on your itinerary,

particularly noting those labeled with the Kid Friendly icon in this book.
Let your kids make their own list of things they want to do. Older chil-
dren can research Italy on the Internet (see Appendix A for a list of Web
sites worth checking out).
The one hump you face is if you don’t want to have your child with you at
all times. Italy doesn’t have a major infrastructure of day-care and child-
care services (see “Quick Concierge” in Appendix A for more about baby
sitting); in fact, finding a hotel with day-care service can be difficult. If
this is one of your needs, be sure to make arrangements through your
hotel ahead of time. The concierge will often be able to help you find a
baby-sitting service, even if the hotel doesn’t formally offer child care.
The only thing you really need for your children is a passport (see
Chapter 10), but you may want to check out some further resources:

Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
In general, Italy accords older people a great deal of respect, probably
because of the continued existence of the extended family as well as the
nature of the Italian language (polite forms of address are to be used
when speaking with someone older than yourself). Therefore, you’re
unlikely to encounter ageism.

Senior discounts on admission at theaters, museums, and public trans-
portation are subject to reciprocity between countries. Because the
United States hasn’t signed the bilateral agreement (you discount us and
we discount you), Americans aren’t eligible for senior discounts in Italy.
(The same rule applies to the under-17 discount.) All discounts do apply
if you’re a citizen of a European Union country.
Accessing Italy: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Italy is rapidly catching up on accessibility issues, even though it is faced
with unique logistical difficulties: It is sometimes impossible to retrofit
medieval or older buildings with elevators and ramps. Often the problem
has been solved with separate entrances, but you usually need to be met
there by an attendant — thus we recommend you always call ahead to
make an appointment. Public transportation reserves spaces for the dis-
abled, but not all buses on all lines have been upgraded, and a few
subway stations are simply not accessible to wheelchairs. For the blind,
special grooves in the sidewalk have been provided in major towns, and a
number of street lights have been equipped with sound signals.
You can avoid some of the accessibility problems by joining a tour that
caters specifically to your needs. Many travel agencies offer customized
tours and itineraries for travelers with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel
(% 877-451-5006 or 507-451-5005; www.flyingwheelstravel.com) offers

Following the Rainbow: Resources 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Italy is a tolerant country, and violent displays of intolerance such as
gay bashing are extremely unusual. As in the United States, there is an
active gay and lesbian movement that is trying to raise public conscious-
ness about prejudice and discrimination.
All major towns and cities have an active gay culture — especially
Florence, Rome, and Milan, which considers itself the gay capital of Italy
and is the headquarters of ARCI–Gay/ARCI– Lesbica (www.arcigay.it),
the country’s leading gay organization with branches throughout Italy. Its
Web site has an English version. The Tuscany branch can be found at
www.gaytoscana.it; for Rome, visit www.arcigayroma.it. ARCI–Gay
also has offices in Siena (% 0577-288-977; www.gaysiena.it) and Pisa
(% 050-555-618).
Capri is the gay resort of Italy, rivaled only by the gay beaches of Venice
and Taormina. The first-ever World Pride event was held in Rome in July
2000, to coincide with the Jubilee celebrations.
The International Gay & Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 954-
630-1652; www.iglta.org), the trade association for the gay and lesbian
travel industry, offers an online directory of gay- and lesbian-friendly
travel businesses; go to its Web site and click on “Consumer Site.”

Making the Grade: Advice 
for Student Travelers
If you’re a student planning a trip to Italy, get an International Student
Identity Card (ISIC), which offers substantial savings on rail passes,
plane tickets, and entrance fees. It also provides you with basic health
and life insurance and a 24-hour help line. The card is available for $22
from STA Travel (% 800-781-4040, or check online for a local number in
your country; www.statravel.com), the biggest student travel agency
in the world. If you’re no longer a student but are still under 26, you can
get an International Youth Travel Card (IYTC) for the same price from
the same people, which entitles you to some discounts (but not on
museum admissions). (Note: In 2002, STA Travel bought competitors
Council Travel and USIT Campus after they went bankrupt. Some offices
still operate under the Council name, but are owned by STA.)
Travel CUTS (% 800-592-2887; www.travelcuts.com) offers similar
services for residents of both Canada and the U.S. Irish students should
turn to USIT (% 01-602-1906; www.usitnow.ie).

Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. You can’t cross an international border without it. Getting a
passport is easy, though: Just follow the steps below.
Losing your passport may be worse than losing your money. Safeguard
your passport in an inconspicuous, inaccessible place, and always carry
a photocopy of it with you. If you lose your passport, the nearest con-
sulate of your native country can help you get a replacement.
Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport in the U.S., follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport office;
a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office (you can
download the form online; see below).
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
(Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or social
security card is also a good idea.)
3. Submit two identical passport-size photos, measuring 2-×-2-inches
in size. You can often find businesses that take these photos near a
passport office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo-vending
machine.

4. Pay a fee. For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for ten years
and costs $100. For those 15 and under, a passport is valid for five
years and costs $85.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing
normally takes three weeks, but can take longer during busy periods
(especially spring).
If you already have a passport in your current name that was issued
within the past 15 years (and you were over 16 when it was issued), you
can renew the passport by mail for $75.
Download passport applications from the U.S. State Department Web
site at travel.state.gov, where you can also get general information
and find your regional passport office; alternatively, call the National
Passport Information Center (% 877-487-2778 or 202-647-0518) for
automated information.
Applying for other passports
Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call the
Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free in
Australia), or log on to www.passports.gov.au for details on how and
where to apply.
Canadians can pick up applications at passport offices throughout
Canada, at post offices, or from the central Passport Office, Department
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G3 (% 800-
567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Applications must be accompanied by two
identical passport-sized photographs and proof of Canadian citizenship.
Processing takes five to ten days if you apply in person, or about three
weeks by mail.
New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New Zealand
Passports Office or download it online. Call the Passports Office
(% 0800-22-50-50 in New Zealand, or 64-4-474-8100) or log on to
www.passports.govt.nz for more information.
United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard ten-
year passport (five-year passport for children under 16) at passport
offices, major post offices, or travel agencies. For information, contact
the United Kingdom Identity and Passport Service (% 0870-521-0410;
www.ips.gov.uk).
When you get your passport photos taken, get six to eight photos total if
you’re planning to also apply for an International Driver’s License and an
international student or teacher ID, which may entitle you to discounts
at museums. Take the extra photos with you: You may need one for
random reasons on the road, and if — heaven forbid — you ever lose
your passport, you can use them for a replacement request.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 91

Staying Healthy When You Travel
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart 
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour hot
line. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to
Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883 in the U.S., 416-652-0137 in Canada;
www.iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries
you’re visiting, along with lists of local, English-speaking doctors. The
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435;
www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards by
region or country and offers tips on food safety as well.
If you do get sick in Italy, ask the concierge at your hotel to recommend
a local doctor — even his or her own doctor, if necessary. If you can’t
locate a doctor, try contacting your embassy or consulate — they main-
tain lists of English-speaking doctors. In an emergency, dial % 113 for
the police. If the situation is life-threatening, call % 118 for an ambu-
lance, or rush to the local pronto soccorso (emergency room).
Under the Italian national healthcare system, you’re eligible only for free
emergency care. If you’re admitted to a hospital as an in-patient, even
from an emergency department and as a result of an accident, you’re
required to pay (unless you are a resident of the European Economic
Area and are eligible for health insurance coverage). For hospitals offer-
ing 24-hour emergency care, see “Fast Facts,” at the end of each destina-
tion chapter.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
Using a cellphone in Italy
If you’re from England, you’re lucky: Your phone already works in Italy. If
you’re from another continent, things are a little complicated: The three
letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities are GSM
(Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that makes for
easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and dozens of other
countries worldwide. In the U.S., T-Mobile, AT&T Wireless, and Cingular
use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Microcell and some Rogers
customers are GSM; and all Europeans and most Australians use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable
multiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models, you can make and receive calls across much of the globe. Just
call your wireless operator and ask for “international roaming” to be
activated on your account. Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be
high — usually hovering around $1.50 in Western Europe.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
92

That’s why it’s important to buy an “unlocked” world phone from the get-
go. Many cellphone operators sell “locked” phones that restrict you from
using any other removable computer memory phone chip card (called a
SIM card) other than the ones they supply. Having an unlocked phone
allows you to install a cheap, prepaid SIM card local to your destination
country. You get a local phone number — and much, much lower calling
rates. Just call your cellular operator and say you plan to go abroad for
several months and want to use the phone with a local provider.
For many, renting a phone is a good idea. While you can rent a phone
from any number of overseas sites, including kiosks at airports and at
car-rental agencies, renting the phone before you leave home may be 
a good idea. Two good wireless rental companies are InTouch USA
(% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) and RoadPost (% 888-
290-1616; www.roadpost.com). InTouch will also, for free, advise you 
on whether your existing phone will work overseas; simply call % 703-
222-7161 between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. eastern standard time, or go to
www.intouchglobal.com/travel.htm. Rental fees are high, hovering
around $100 per month with $1.50 per-minute charges, but incoming
calls are free, which will save you a lot on roaming charges.
Accessing the Internet away from home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Using your wireless-enabled PDA (personal digital
assistant) or laptop will give you the most flexibility, but Internet access
is so widespread nowadays that you really don’t need to carry the extra
weight of electronic equipment, unless you need it for work reasons.
Most hotels in Italy — in the mid-range and up — offer Internet access
from at least one computer, if not a Wi-Fi hot spot or even Internet
access through the TVs in each guest room. Sometimes this service is
free; sometimes you have to pay a small fee. Check with your hotel to
find out. Hotel business centers should be avoided, however, unless
you’re willing to pay exorbitant rates.
You also find Internet cafes in almost every village, except the smallest
ones; just ask the concierge at your hotel (you can also check www.
cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com, but their listings are not
comprehensive). One of the leading global Internet-cafe chains is
Internet Train (www.internettrain.it), which not only has multiple
sites in the big cities like Rome, Florence, and Milan, but also serves
second-tier cities like Verona, and even smaller towns like Greve in
Chianti and Agrigento; another company is easyInternetcafé
(www.easyeverything.com).
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates. These clunky kiosks, which you also see in shopping malls,
hotel lobbies, and tourist information offices around the world, give you
basic Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cyber-
cafe prices.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 93

To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if it has
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your ISP
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free service from
mail2web (www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail.
For more flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail
account through a site like Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com).
Your home ISP may be able to forward your e-mail to the Web-based
account automatically.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). It provides a Web-based inter-
face for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from anywhere —
even an Internet cafe — provided your “target” PC is on and has an
always-on connection to the Internet (such as with a cable modem).
If you’re bringing your own computer, the buzzword to familiarize yourself
with is Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) — more and more hotels, cafes, and retail-
ers are signing on as wireless “hot spots.” You can get Wi-Fi connection
one of several ways. Many laptops sold in the last couple years have built-
in Wi-Fi capability (an 802.11b wireless Ethernet connection). Mac owners
have their own networking technology, Apple AirPort. For those with
older computers, an 802.11b/Wi-Fi card (around $50) can be plugged into
your laptop. You can sign up for wireless access service much as you do
cellphone service, through a plan offered by one of several commercial
companies that have made wireless service available in airports, hotel
lobbies, and coffee shops, primarily in the U.S. (followed by the U.K. and
Japan). T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up wire-
less connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops in the U.S.
Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have set up
networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. Best of all, you don’t
need to be staying at the Four Seasons to use the hotel’s network; just set
yourself up on a nice couch in the lobby. The companies’ pricing policies
can be byzantine, with a variety of monthly, per-connection, and per-
minute plans, but in general you pay around $30 a month — and as more
and more companies jump on the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to
get even more competitive.
There are also places that provide free wireless networks in cities
around the world. To locate these free hot spots, go to www.personal
telco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
If Wi-Fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout the world offer dataports for laptop modems, and a few
thousand hotels in the U.S. and Europe now offer free high-speed
Internet access using an Ethernet network cable. You can bring your
own cables, but most hotels rent them for around $10. Call your hotel in
advance to see what your options are.
In addition, major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have local access
numbers around the world, allowing you to go online by simply placing
a local call. Check your ISP’s Web site or call its toll-free number and ask
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
94

how you can use your current account away from home — and how
much it will cost. If you’re traveling outside the reach of your ISP, the
iPass network has dial-up numbers in most of the world’s countries. You
have to sign up with an iPass provider, which will then tell you how to
set up your computer for your destination(s). For a list of iPass
providers, go to www.ipass.com and click on “Individuals Buy Now.”
One solid provider is i2roam (www.i2roam.com; % 866-811-6209 or
920-235-0475).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’re fine
if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and two
hours before an international flight, but during peak travel time in busy
airports it is a good idea to give yourself a bit more leeway. If you show
up late, make sure you tell an airline employee and she may whisk you
to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries, including Italy.)
In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And E-tick-
ets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with E-tickets
can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic kiosks or
online check-in from a home computer. Online check-in involves logging
on to your airline’s Web site, accessing your reservation, and printing
out your boarding pass. If you’re using a kiosk at the airport, bring the
credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print
out your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to the secu-
rity checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or
looking to snag an exit-row seat, you will be able to do so using most air-
line kiosks. Curbside check-in is also a good way to avoid lines,
although a few airlines still ban this practice; call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter than they were during 2001
and 2002, but some doozies remain. If you have trouble standing for long
periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide a wheel-
chair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt
buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can
prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting
disabled passengers or children.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 95

Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you
can’t. The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are
okay, and food and beverages must be passed through the X-ray
machine — but that security screeners can’t make you drink from your
coffee cup. Bring food in your carry-on rather than checking it, as explo-
sive-detection machines used on checked luggage have been known to
mistake food (especially chocolate, for some reason) for bombs.
Travelers in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal
item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can
stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it,
it’s still considered a personal item. The Transportation Security
Administration (TSA) has issued a list of restricted items; check its Web
site (www.tsa.gov) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. Travel Sentry certified locks (available at luggage
and travel shops, at Brookstone stores, or online at www.brookstone.
com) are approved by the TSA and can be opened by inspectors with a
special code or key. If you use something other than TSA-approved
locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a hand-search is required.
Saving Time with Advance Reservations
Because of long lines during peak tourist periods, many museums in
Italy now offer advance ticketing. You can make reservations before you
leave home (thus bypassing waits of up to three hours at the local ticket
booth). The list of museums for which you may want to make reserva-
tions includes Rome’s Galleria Borghese (see Chapter 12); Florence’s
Galleria degli Uffizi and Galleria dell’Accademia (see Chapter 13);
Venice’s Palazzo Ducale and Gallerie dell’Accademia (see Chapter 16);
and Naples’s Museo di Capodimonte (see Chapter 18).

Part III
The Eternal City:
Rome

In this part . . .
T
he seven hills of Rome have been continuously inhabited
for the past 3,000 years, so it’s not surprising that nowhere
else will you ﬁnd such cultural density and layering of periods
and styles. The treasures of Rome stretch from pre-Republic
ruins to Bernini’s baroque marvels to the stylish, convulsive
city depicted by Fellini in his famous movies.
Chapter 11 provides everything you need to know to get to
Rome, orient yourself in the city, ﬁnd a comfortable place to
stay, and order a delicious meal. Included are rundowns of
the best hotels and the best restaurants. In Chapter 12, we
describe the major sites and activities — not only how to see
the Colosseum and the Vatican Museums, but also where to
shop and where to go for fun after dark.

Chapter 11
Settling into Rome
In This Chapter
 Arriving in Rome
 Getting around the city
 Finding the best room in Rome
 Tasting Roman cuisine
A
rriving in a foreign city is always a challenge, and although Rome
isn’t one of the biggest cities in the world, it is large enough to be
confusing, with its intricate street layout, thousands of hotels and
restaurants, and complex transportation system. The narrow and wind-
ing streets of the historic center are a maze even for Romans! Sit back
and relax — in this chapter, we provide all you need to negotiate the
Eternal City like a native.
Getting There
Getting to Rome is fairly straightforward: The city has two airports, is a
major train hub, and is served by highways from all directions. As the
old adage goes, “All roads lead to Rome.”
By air
Rome’s main airport, Leonardo da Vinci, is located in Fiumicino — this
is where you’re likely to land if you come by plane. Charter flights and
some European airlines also arrive in the smaller airport of Ciampino.
Navigating your way through passport control and Customs
If you’ve already landed in a country that is part of the Schengen
European Community (which includes Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden), then your passport
has been checked and only spot checks will be performed at the Italian
border. If, however, Rome is your first port of call in Europe, then you
have to line up at passport control. Often you find two lines: one for
European Union citizens and one for everyone else. After having your
passport checked and collecting your luggage, you must pass through

Customs. Items for personal use enter duty-free up to 175€ ($280) for
each adult and 90€ ($144) for each child under 15. In addition, adults
can import a maximum of 200 cigarettes (50 cigars), 1 liter (slightly more
that 1 quart) of liquor or 2 liters of wine, 50 grams of perfume, 500 grams
(1 pound) of coffee, and 100 grams (3 ounces) of tea; children are
allowed only perfume. You cannot bring currency in excess of 10,329€
($16,526, though the dollar amount will depend on the conversion rate
on the day you travel). See “Quick Concierge” in Appendix A for Customs
regulations on what you can bring home. You can also find detailed
information at the Italian Customs Web site (www.agenziadogane.it).
As a foreigner, you’re required to have your passport with you at all
times, to prove both your identity and your legal status. We recommend
you either carry it in a safe place on your person (such as a document
pouch worn under your clothes), or leave the original in the safe at your
hotel and carry a photocopy.
Getting oriented at Fiumicino/Leonardo da Vinci
Though officially named after Leonardo, everybody refers to this airport
as Fiumicino (% 06-65951; www.adr.it), after the name of the nearby
town. The airport is compact and very well organized (but ever expand-
ing), with three terminals connected by a long corridor. Terminal A han-
dles domestic travel; Terminal B handles domestic and internal flights to
the Schengen European Community; and Terminal C manages interna-
tional flights. If you’re flying directly from a U.S. airport, Terminal C is
your likely point of entry; it is connected to a newer set of gates by a
cool monorail.
Don’t be concerned if you see police officers with submachine guns
walking around — due to recent world tensions, it’s now routine proce-
dure. Be aware, though, that the security forces at Fiumicino have terror-
ists in mind, not common thieves — that means you still have to watch
your belongings like a hawk, and don’t leave any valuables in your
checked luggage.
After exiting passport control and Customs, you enter the main con-
course, a long hall that connects all three terminals. Here’s where you
find ATMs (one per terminal), 24-hour currency exchange machines, and
a cambio (exchange) office, open from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and located
just outside Customs in the international arrivals area.
The cambio office in the airport usually offers the best rates in town,
including for traveler’s checks, which are otherwise difficult to cash in
Italy (see chapter 5).
On your way out to ground transportation, you find a very good tourist
information desk (international arrivals, Terminal B; % 06-65956074;
daily 8 a.m.–7 p.m.) that provides information on Rome and the rest of
Italy. Nearby is a help desk for last-minute hotel reservations — the serv-
ice, however, doesn’t cover all hotels in Rome. Public transportation —
including taxis and car-rental shuttle buses — is outside the terminal
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
100

along the sidewalk; you can reach the train station through an overpass
located on the second floor of the terminal.
Getting from the Fiumicino airport to your hotel
Fiumicino lies about 30km (18 miles) southwest of Rome and is very well
connected by highway, train, shuttle train, and bus.
The easiest way to get to your hotel is by taking a taxi; consider 50 min-
utes for the ride and about double at rush hour. The line forms on the
curb just outside the terminal and is marked by a sign; taxis are white
and have a meter, as well as an official card inside bearing tariffs.
The newly introduced flat rate from Fiumicino Airport to any destination in
the historic center and vicinity (“within the Aurelian walls” is the official
definition) for Rome-licensed taxis is 40€ ($64) for up to four passengers.
Beware of “gypsy” cabdrivers who might approach you: They will easily
charge you double the regulated cab rates and should be absolutely
avoided.
At press time, municipal authorities have established an official 60€
($96) flat rate from the airport to Rome for Fiumicino-licensed taxis.
Since they are not allowed to take passengers from Rome back to the air-
port, drivers are obliged to make the return trip empty. Unfortunately
passengers cannot choose their taxis, so it’s luck of the draw whether
you get one of the coveted Rome-licensed cabs. Unless the regulation is
changed by the time you arrive in Rome, be prepared to shell out the
extra money.
A solution we recommend is booking a limo service: If you are 
traveling alone, the cheapest company is AirportShuttle (% 6700165;
www.airportshuttle.it), with a rate of 28€ ($45) per person. For 
couples, Roma Shuttle (% 06-68300621; www.romashuttle.com) is
cheaper, charging 40€ ($64) for up to two passengers. For larger parties
we recommend Rome Shuttle Limousine (% 06-61969084; www.rome
shuttlelimousine.com), with rates starting at 35€ ($56) for three 
passengers, including luggage.
Taking the train into Rome is equally simple, cheaper for small parties,
and a lot faster than driving during rush hour. Don’t be discouraged by
your luggage: You can hire help, both at the baggage-claim area in the
airport and at the station in Rome, for 2€ ($3.20) per item. To get to the
railroad terminal from the arrivals hall, follow the sign marked TRENI.
Train tickets are sold at the ticket booth and at automatic vending
machines, and day and tourist three-day transportation passes (see
“Getting Around Rome,” later in this chapter) are available from the
tobacconist in the railroad terminal. The best train is the Leonardo
Express, a first-class-only express train to Termini (Rome’s central rail
station) that runs daily every 30 minutes from 6:37 a.m. to 11:37 p.m.
Transportation passes do not cover first class, hence you need to buy
Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 101

the 9.50€ ($15) ticket, but the 35-minute ride is well worth it. A local
commuter train (trains with final destination marked Orte or Fara
Sabina) also leaves from the terminal. Slower and cheaper (5€/$8 per
ride, included in Rome transportation passes), they don’t stop at
Termini station, but at one of the other rail stations in Rome, which are
good if your hotel is in the area: Roma Ostiense for Aventino and
Colosseum; Roma Trastevere for Trastevere, San Pietro, and Prati; and
Roma Tiburtina for Porta Pia and Villa Borghese. Whichever class you
choose, remember to stamp your ticket at one of the small yellow valida-
tion boxes before you board. Taxi stands are located immediately out-
side each of the train stations upon your arrival. Outside each station
you also find buses, with signs indicating their numbers and routes, and
a subway stop (except in Roma Trastevere).
Finally, you can take a shuttle bus into Rome. Terravision (% 06-
79494572; www.terravision.it) runs a shuttle to Termini station and
to Tiburtina station, with stops at a few major hotels. The fare is 9€
($14) for adults and 5€ ($8) for children 2 to 12.
Arriving at Ciampino airport
A number of international charter flights, as well as some airlines that
mainly serve Europe, arrive at Ciampino (% 06-794941 or 06-79340297),
16km (10 miles) southeast of Rome. This airport has few structures or
services; it’s almost like an American civil-aviation airport.
Taxis are by far the easiest way to get to town from Ciampino. The flat
rate is 30€ ($48) for the 45-minute trip. You can also take a shuttle 
bus — Terravision runs a shuttle service in concert with Ryanair flights,
while Schiaffini runs a shuttle coinciding with easyJet flights. Both take
you to Termini station for 8€ ($13); tickets are sold at the bus stop in
the airport, and in Rome at the hotels Royal Santina and Stromboli on
Via Marsala, across from the Termini train station.
By train
If you are coming from another town in Italy or in Europe, the train is the
best way to get to Rome: The national train service, Trenitalia (% 892021;
www.trenitalia.it), is cheap, reliable, and frequent. No fewer than six
railway stations are located in the center of Rome, but the most central
and largest is Termini (% 800-431784; www.romatermini.it), while the
second-busiest is Tiburtina. Trains usually stop at one or the other.
At Termini station, public toilets and luggage storage are at either end of
the platform area. Exits located near platforms 1 and 22 lead to the main
concourse, a long commercial gallery with a bar to the north and a phar-
macy to the south; in between are many newsstands, a tobacconist, a
travel agency, ATMs, and a cambio office, as well as information booths.
One floor below, you find a mall complete with a large bookstore, super-
market, cosmetics store, shoe-repair shop, and ATMs; here is also the
entrance to the subway (both lines cross here; see “Getting Around
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
102

Rome,” later in this chapter). If you stay on the ground level and con-
tinue straight across the concourse gallery, you reach the main hall,
where train tickets are sold at ticket windows and automatic machines.
You can exit to the street at either end of the gallery (where you find
small taxi stands) or from the main hall, which opens onto Piazza dei
Cinquecento, the largest bus terminal in Rome. The main taxi stand is
just outside the main hall near the metro sign on the right. A recently
introduced change has passengers line up into two lines depending on
your destination: within the Aurelian walls (that’s Rome’s center) and
outside of them (the airport, and suburbs such as EUR); see “Taxi fares
in Rome,” later in this chapter for rates. Gypsy cabs will try their luck
here as well; ignore them.
Arriving by ship
If you’re coming by sea, your ocean liner will dock in the harbor of
Civitavecchia (about 80 km/50 miles north of Rome). There, you can
catch one of the frequent coaches and trains bound for Rome’s Termini
or Tiburtina stations. Trains leave about every 20 minutes for the hour-
long ride, with direct coaches departing every hour. You find a taxi
stand at the harbor (% 0766-26121 or 0766-24251), or you can arrange
in advance for limousine service, the best of which is offered by the
same companies that handle transfers from the airport (see earlier in
this chapter).
Orienting Yourself in Rome
For the longest time, the city of Rome fit comfortably inside the Aurelian
walls ( the defensive walls originally laid out in ancient Roman times.
Only in the 20th century did it begin to outgrow that limit, with urban
development creeping along the main roads heading out of the city. The
immense urban sprawl of the past three decades, though, has seen all
the space in between those roads filled with modern developments;
former suburbs and villages have become neighborhoods of Rome, and
the old city center enclosed by the walls is considered the historic dis-
trict. As a result, Rome’s historic district is quite large, huge by most
standards, as is appropriate for Italy’s largest city.
The city is divided by the river Tevere (Tiber), which meanders south-
ward, with about a third of the city on its western bank and the rest on
its eastern bank. On the eastern bank you find the political heart of the
city, as well as most of the cultural, commercial, and tourist attractions.
Fashioned by three millennia of consecutive layers of urban develop-
ment, the street layout is rather confusing, with tiny medieval roads
crossed by larger and more modern avenues. Yet, with a good map, it’s
not too difficult to orient yourself: At the east end is Piazza dei
Cinquecento with Stazione Termini, Rome’s main train station and
major public transportation hub. Branching out toward the south, Via
Cavour leads to the Colosseum. South of the Colosseum is the Aventino.

Adjacent to Piazza dei Cinquecento is Piazza della Repubblica — or
dell’Esedra, as it was once called — which is the start of the series of
thoroughfares leading west to St. Peter’s Basilica and the Vatican: Via
Nazionale, Piazza Venezia, Via del Plebiscito, Corso Vittorio Emanuele II,
and, on the western bank of the Tiber, Via della Conciliazione. Piazza
Venezia mentioned above, is also where Via del Corso heads to Piazza
del Popolo and the Spanish Steps neighborhood, and Via dei Fori
Imperiali leads to the Colosseum. On the western bank of the Tiber, you
find the Gianicolo hill overlooking the neighborhood of Trastevere, as
well as the Vatican — the tiny city-state that is the base of the Catholic
religion, with the pope as both a religious and administrative leader. The
Vatican’s major feature is the basilica of San Pietro. North of the Vatican
is the largish area called Prati, crossed by the busy Via Cola di Rienzo
and Via Ottaviano.
Introducing the neighborhoods
We have divided the historic center of Rome into several smaller neigh-
borhoods; all are desirable places to stay, with lively nightlife, restau-
rants, and cafes nearby. The neighborhoods are identified on the “Rome
Orientation” map in this chapter.
Aventino
This elegant residential neighborhood is one of the original seven hills of
Rome, where a number of monasteries were built in the Middle Ages. It
has known very little urban development since, and it’s now a unique
island of quiet, where small restaurants and a few hotels are surrounded
by greenery and peaceful streets. It is well connected via public trans-
portation to all other destinations in Rome.
Campo de’ Fiori
Along the left bank of the Tiber, this authentic neighborhood is mostly
residential but is made very lively by the market square and the con-
nected commercial strip of Via dei Giubbonari. You find plenty of
restaurants and an active nightlife here. Among the attractions is the
beautiful Palazzo Farnese.
Colosseo
The Colosseum was at the heart of ancient Rome, and the area around
it is a romantic mix of residential buildings and ruins. The Colosseo is
home to the most illustrious monuments of ancient Rome, including
the Palatino, the Roman Forum, the Campidoglio, and, of course, the
Colosseum itself. To the northeast of Via dei Fori Imperiali, in an area
sloping up along Via Cavour, is a very authentic and residential neigh-
borhood. Although not elegant, it is experiencing new life with the
opening of trendy restaurants, small hotels, and bars. To the south-
east toward San Giovanni is another small, residential, and very
Roman neighborhood, with a few hotels and some nice neighborhood
restaurants.
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
106

Navona/Pantheon
On the southwestern side of the Corso, this lively neighborhood is a mix
of elegant Renaissance and medieval buildings, including the beautiful
palaces that house the government and the two chambers of the Italian
Parliament (the Parlamento and Senato). Many hotels are in this area,
and several nice restaurants and bars can be found along Via del
Governo Vecchio. Some of Rome’s best antiques shops line the Via dei
Coronari. Graced by two of Rome’s greatest attractions — Piazza
Navona and the Pantheon — at its heart, this is one of the most desir-
able areas to stay; its popularity means that you have to put up with
crowds, especially in summer.
Piazza del Popolo
Squeezed between the old city walls and the river, around one of the
most beautiful squares of Rome, this lively neighborhood has a lot of
trendy new restaurants and bars in the area extending west of the Corso.
Piazza di Spagna
On the east side of the Corso, this former residential neighborhood has
been almost completely taken over by the fashion and tourist industries.
It is the best shopping neighborhood in Rome, home to all the great
names of Italian couture, plus a lot of other tony boutiques. It has many
hotels, including some of the city’s best. The shopping streets get a bit
deserted at night, and if you’re seeking some nightlife, you have to edge
toward Fontana di Trevi or cross over the Corso.
Prati
This residential neighborhood on the western bank of the Tiber takes its
name from the fields (prati) that still existed here at the end of the 19th
century. It stretches north of the Vatican along the river. Reflecting its
late-19th-century origins, streets are wide, straight, and lined with trees.
The area is pleasant and only a bridge away from Piazza del Popolo; it
has a relatively active, if subdued, nightlife, with restaurants, jazz clubs,
and an important shopping area along Via Cola di Rienzo.
Repubblica
Piazza della Repubblica is a gorgeous square created over what was the
main hall of Diocletian’s thermal baths, a few steps west of Piazza dei
Cinquecento and the Termini train station. Less prestigious because of
its proximity to the Termini train station, the neighborhood has good
access to public transportation and is within walking distance of many
attractions. The area along Via Cernaia on one side of the square is
home to many offices while Via Nazionale on the other is a major shop-
ping district. Both are lively during the day but not particularly happen-
ing at night, when this turns into a quiet residential neighborhood with
only a few hotels and restaurants. Repubblica is a solid alternative to the
more glamorous and pricey neighborhoods nearby.
Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 107

San Pietro
On the western bank of the Tiber, this area is mainly occupied by the
walled city of the Vatican (seat of the Holy See and site of the Vatican
Museums and the Sistine Chapel). It is dominated, of course, by the
grandiose St. Peter’s Basilica and Castel Sant’Angelo. Flanking the basil-
ica are two ancient and picturesque residential neighborhoods that are
home to a few hotels and restaurants.
Teatro Marcello
This area covers what is still commonly referred to as the Ghetto, the
old Jewish neighborhood at the edge of ancient Rome. It is among the
most authentic of the historic neighborhoods and remains very residen-
tial. Some nice restaurants are tucked away in its small streets, along
with pubs, local shops, and a few archaeological treasures.
Trastevere
Located on the western bank of the Tiber at the foot of the Gianicolo
hill, this neighborhood is just across the river from the Aventino.
Literally meaning “on the other side of the Tiber,” during ancient Roman
times, this was the traditional (and rather seedy) residence of poorer
artisans and workers. Its character was preserved during the Middle
Ages and the Renaissance, and to some extent up to the last century. In
recent times, though, it has been largely transformed into an artsy, cul-
tured neighborhood, famous for its restaurants, street life, and nightlife,
and appealing to younger and not-so-young Romans and visitors.
Trevi
On the east side of the Corso, this neighborhood slopes up the Quirinale
hill with the magnificent Renaissance presidential (formerly papal) resi-
dence as its centerpiece. Aside from the tourist hubbub around its
famous fountain — always surrounded by a sea of humanity — it’s a rela-
tively unspoiled neighborhood with many small restaurants and shops.
Via Veneto
Made famous by Fellini as the heart of La Dolce Vita, this elegant street
is lined by famous hotels and a few upscale stores. The environs are
very quiet at night. There are a number of nice hotels on the side
streets, but relatively few restaurants and nightspots. Well connected by
public transportation, the areas behind the glitzy strip of Via Veneto are
a good alternative to the glamorous and expensive areas nearby, espe-
cially if you go toward Via XX Settembre (at the southeastern edge of
this neighborhood).
Finding information after you arrive
The main visitor center is at Via Parigi 5, off Piazza della Repubblica
near Termini Station (APT; % 06-488991; www.romaturismo.it;
Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m.). You can get information and purchase tickets to
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
108

the Colosseum as well as the Roma Archeologia Card and the Roma
Pass (see Chapter 12). Additional tourist info points are scattered
around town near major attractions; they sell the Roma Pass and the
Villa Borghese Card (see Chapter 12) but not the Archeologia Card or
tickets to the Colosseum; all are open daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.:
 Castel Sant’Angelo, Piazza Pia, to the west of the Castel
Sant’Angelo (% 06-68809707; Metro: Ottaviano–San Pietro)
 Fontana di Trevi, Via Minghetti, off Via del Corso (% 06-6782988;
Minibus: 117 or 119)
 Fori Imperiali, Piazza Tempio della Pace on Via dei Fori Imperiali
(% 06-69924307; Metro: Colosseo)
 Largo Goldoni, on Via del Corso at Via Condotti (% 06-68136061;
Metro: Piazza di Spagna)
 Palazzo delle Esposizioni, Via Nazionale (% 06-47824525; Bus: 64)
 Piazza delle Cinque Lune, off Piazza Navona to the north (% 06-
68809240; Minibus: 116)
 San Giovanni, Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano (% 06-77203535;
Metro: San Giovanni)
 Santa Maria Maggiore, Via dell’Olmata, on the southeastern side of
the church (% 06-4740955; Metro: Termini)
 Stazione Termini, Piazza dei Cinquecento, in front of the railroad
station (% 06-47825194; Metro: Termini)
 Stazione Termini, inside the gallery (% 06-48906300; Metro:
Termini)
 Trastevere, Piazza Sonnino (% 06-58333457; Tram: 8)
If you have the choice, avoid the visitor centers in or near Termini sta-
tion and the one near Fontana di Trevi, as they are the most crowded.
A tourist hotline (% 060608) provides information and sells Roma
Passes (see Chapter 12); the same information is also available on their
Web site (www.060608.it), which is in both Italian and English.
The Holy See maintains its own tourist office, where you can get a map
of St. Peter’s Basilica, and information about religious events and papal
audiences. (They do not handle bookings; see Chapter 12.) The office is
located in Piazza San Pietro (% 06-69884466; Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–6 p.m.)
to the left of the Basilica as you walk toward it.
Getting Around Rome
Rome’s historic hills are no myth: They are real and usually steep. The
one myth is that there are only seven of them. Rome may look flat on a
Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 109

map, but you soon understand why you see so few bicycles around. We
still recommend walking, though, as this thousands-of-years-old city
wasn’t designed for any mode of conveyance other than the human foot.
There are times, however, when public transportation is essential, and
taxis are a real godsend, particularly at night.
On foot
Walking is by far the best way to discover Rome’s most picturesque
urban vistas and romantic small piazze. Wear very comfortable shoes,
and be ready to switch to another form of transportation — usually
handy — when you get tired.
To enjoy Rome’s delightful labyrinth, you need a good map. The free
tourist-office map is quite good, but it doesn’t have a stradario (street
directory), which is essential for locating addresses. You can buy a
detailed city map with a stradario at any newsstand and many book-
stores.
By taxi
We highly recommend taxis in Rome: Rates are reasonable and drivers
are usually experienced professionals who know the city inside and out
(see “Taxi fares in Rome” for prices). They’re a great resource, particu-
larly at night after the buses and metro stop running.
Taxis don’t cruise the streets in Rome, though: They wait at taxi stands
for calls. Hence, unless you happen to find one that’s returning to a
stand, you cannot generally hail a taxi on the street. Luckily, taxi stands
are ubiquitous, and you always find one near a major landmark. You can
identify them by a smallish telephone on a pole marked TAXI. You can
also call a radio-taxi for a small surcharge; or ask a hotel or restaurant
to summons one for you. See “Fast Facts,” at the end of this chapter for a
list of taxi stands and radio-taxi phone numbers.
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome

Taxi fares in Rome
The meter starts at 2.33€ ($3.75), and adds 1.29€ ($2.10) for every kilometer (2⁄3 mile) if
you’re moving at up to 20kmph (12 mph), and for every 85.3m (280 ft.) if you are going
faster; this rate decreases within the urban limits (G.R.A. highway) to 0.78€ ($1.25) for
every kilometer (2⁄3 mile) if you’re moving at up to 20kmph (12 mph); for every 141m (462
ft.) if you are going faster; and for every 19.2 seconds if you’re stuck in traffic. At night
(10 p.m.–7 a.m.) you have to pay a surcharge of 2.58€ ($4.15), and on Sundays and hol-
iday of 1.03€ ($1.65). The luggage supplement is 1€ ($1.60) for each bag larger than
35x25x50cm (14x9.8x20 inches), and you need to pay 1€ ($1.60) for each extra pas-
senger after the fourth. Radio taxi calls have a surcharge of between 2 and 6€
($3.20–$9.60) depending on the distance from the call center. Taxi rides originating
from Termini train station apply a surcharge of 2€ ($3.20).

By subway (metropolitana)
Work is slowly proceeding on Rome’s third subway line, but the existing
two lines — A and B — are all you need for your visit. The advantage of
using the metropolitana — metro for short — is avoiding the terrible traffic
and cutting down on your commuting time; however, you miss out on the
views you can get from both buses and taxis. The two lines cross at the
Termini station and trains are indicated by their final destination: Battistini
and Anagnina for line A and Laurentina and Rebibbia for line B; a big red M
marks all metro entrances. The metro runs Sunday through Friday from
5:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. and Saturday from 5:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
The Colosseum, Circus Maximus, and Cavour stops on Line B don’t offer
full elevator/lift service and aren’t accessible to the disabled. (For tips
for travelers with mobility restrictions, see Chapter 9.)
By bus and tram
Rome’s bus system is large and under continuous improvement, yet the
city’s ancient layout resists any real modernization. Buses are very
crowded at rush hour, and traffic jams are endemic. Still, buses remain an
excellent resource because they go absolutely everywhere in Rome.
Especially useful are the diminutive electric buses that are the only vehi-
cles allowed in the tiny, narrow streets of the historic heart of the city
(116 and 116T from the Gianicolo hill to Villa Borghese; 117 from Piazza
del Popolo to San Giovanni in Laterano; 118 from Piazzale Ostiense to
Appia Antica; and 119 from Piazza del Popolo to Largo Argentina). Among
the other bus lines, those that you are most likely to use are the 23 (Prati
to Aventino), 62 (Castel Sant’Angelo to Repubblica), 64 (Termini station
Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 111
Getting a ticket to ride
ATAC (% 800-431784 or 06-46952027; www.atac.roma.it), Rome’s transport
authority, runs all public transportation in the city, and the same ticket is valid for all.
You need to buy tickets before boarding (although a few bus lines now have onboard
vending machines, but do not count on finding one), and you must stamp them upon
boarding, or else they aren’t valid (on subways and trains, the stamping machines —
little yellow boxes — are at the entrance gates; on buses and trams, they’re onboard).
A regular biglietto (ticket) for the bus/metro is valid for 75 minutes and costs 1€ ($1.60).
Within the 75 minutes of validity, you can take as many buses and trams as you want,
but only one subway ride. You can also get a day pass called BIG that costs 4€ ($6.60),
a three-day ticket called BTI for 11€ ($18), and a weekly pass called CIS for 16€ ($25).
All passes give you unlimited rides on the bus, metro, and urban trains. You can buy
tickets and passes at the metro ticket booths, the ATAC bus information booth by
Platform C in the open-air bus terminal in Piazza dei Cinquecento, from vending
machines at some major bus stops, and at many bars, tobacconist shops (signed TABAC-
CHI or with a white T on a black background), and newsstands. A public transporta-
tion pass is included with the Roma Pass (see Chapter 12).

to Vatican), 87 (Prati to Colosseum), 492 (Tiburtina railroad station to
Vatican Museums), and 910 (Termini station to Villa Borghese). Rome
also has a few tram lines; they aren’t as spectacular as the cable cars in
San Francisco, but they’re still fun to ride. A popular line is the 3, which
passes by the Basilica di San Giovanni and the Colosseum. Another line
you’re likely to use is the 8, running from Largo Argentina to Trastevere.
Most buses run daily from 5:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m., but some stop at 8:30
p.m. A few night lines are marked with an N for notturno (night); they usu-
ally run every hour, departing from the end of the line on the hour.
Staying in Style
With over a thousand hotels, innumerable B&Bs, and other types of
accommodations to chose from, finding a place to stay in Rome should
be a breeze; yet prices have risen sharply in recent years. A weak dollar
and ensuing poor exchange rate don’t help, and you have to compete
with some 20 million other visitors to boot. Finding a decent room with-
out paying through the nose has become a challenge, particularly during
holidays (see our calendar of events in Chapter 3), and the off season is
now basically nonexistent. If you are on a budget, you have to accept
basic accommodations, or stay on the outskirts of the historic district or
even in the suburbs. Advance planning is key, since the best deals are
the first to go. See Chapter 8 for money-saving tips and advice on what
to expect from your hotel: Globalization may be here, but cultural differ-
ences remain alive and well.
We list our favorite hotels below, split among first choices and back-up
options: All are in the historic district, with private bathrooms and basic
amenities. We always specify if a hotel does not have an elevator, satel-
lite TV, or air-conditioning. By contrast, very few hotels in Rome have
their own garage or parking lot; when they do, we say so. Most just have
an agreement with a nearby facility (usually a narrow-entrance under-
ground garage). If you plan to bring a car (which we strongly discour-
age), ask your hotel for the rates when you book your room. Expect to
pay between 18€ and 46€ ($29–$74) per day depending on the hotel’s
location and your car size.
If you arrive without a room reservation (something we do not recom-
mend), remember that there’s a hotel reservations desk at the airport as
well as one at Termini station.

We love this elegant hotel’s prime location across from the Pantheon.
Guest rooms are spacious and beautifully furnished, with antiques and
quality reproductions, marble-topped tables, and hardwood floors. The
marble bathrooms are large (for Rome) and nicely appointed. The terrace

Casa Valdese
$
Prati
On the Vatican side of the river, near Castel Sant’Angelo and the shopping
district of Cola di Rienzo, this small hotel offers great value. The name
“Valdese” refers to the Protestant sect of Swiss origin, whose philosophy
is reflected in the hotel’s simple but spotlessly clean and pleasant rooms.
The very moderate prices and the excellent location — basically across
the river from Piazza del Popolo — are other pluses.

Aventino
In a charming villa surrounded by its own garden, this quiet hotel in our
favorite part of Rome is convenient to most attractions. It is run by the
same efficient management as Hotel Sant’Anselmo and Villa San Pio (see
reviews later in this chapter). Guest rooms are modest in size but not
cramped, and are pleasantly outfitted with ornate period furniture, elegant
fabrics, and beautiful wooden floors. Bathrooms are modern, with func-
tional showers.

San Pietro
We love Borgo Pio, the tiny neighborhood adjacent to St. Peter’s Basilica
and the Vatican Museums, where this charming hotel is located. In a
medieval building that was once the home of 16th-century architect
Domenico Fontana, it was converted into a hotel in the 19th century. It
enjoyed a complete overhaul for the new millennium, transforming it from
a pilgrim hostelry to an attractive modern hotel. The small guest rooms
are full of character, with exposed ceiling beams, original cotto-tiled floors,
and elegant wooden furnishings. The small, pleasantly tiled bathrooms are
updated and functional.

Hotel Capo d’Africa
$$$$
Colosseo
This elegant modern hotel is on an atmospheric street between the
Colosseum and San Giovanni, close to the Colosseum and the Roman
Forum, but farther away from the heart of the historic district. Run by the
same owners as the Hotel Dei Mellini (see review later in this chapter) and
known for its excellent service, the Capo d’Africa offers comfortable spa-
cious rooms furnished in a warm, modern-ethnic style, with comfortable
beds. The good-size marble bathrooms are well equipped. The hotel also
offers some wheelchair-accessible rooms. Don’t miss the roof terrace and
its splendid views.
See map p. 114. Via Capo d’Africa 54. % 06-772801. Fax: 06-77280801. www.hotel
capodafrica.com. Metro: Colosseo. Walk southeast across Piazza del Colosseo

Hotel Columbia
$$
Repubblica
Under continuous family management since 1900, this refined hotel offers
excellent value in a somewhat dowdier area of the historic district that is
convenient to a number of attractions and well connected by public trans-
portation. Guest rooms are spacious and bright, many with beamed ceil-
ings, some with arched windows or Murano chandeliers. All rooms are
individually furnished with comfortable beds, antiques or quality repro-
ductions, and ample-size modern bathrooms. The hotel also has a pleas-
ant bar and roof garden, where breakfast is served.

Hotel Dei Mellini
$$$
Prati
Within walking distance of Piazza del Popolo and Castel Sant’Angelo, this
hotel has a sophisticated atmosphere, with a relaxing inner garden and a
contemporary-art collection in the public areas. Guest rooms are spacious
and pleasantly furnished in modern-classic style with pastel-colored walls,
carpeted floors, quality wooden furniture, and comfortable beds; some
have private terraces. Bathrooms are sizable and elegantly appointed in
marble. Children up to 12 stay free in a parent’s room. Check the Web site

Hotel Farnese
$$$
Prati
Tucked behind Castel Sant’Angelo in a quiet neighborhood across the
Tiber from Piazza del Popolo, this hospitable choice occupies a 1906 patri-
cian palazzo that has been completely renovated. Though off the beaten
path, it is only a few steps from one of Rome’s best shopping streets — Via
Cola di Rienzo. It is elegantly decorated and features spacious guest
rooms, the largest ones geared for families. The bathrooms are particu-
larly nice for this price range, clad in marble and tile and with new modern
fixtures. The hotel’s roof garden is very pleasant.

Hotel Giuliana
$$
Repubblica
In a residential neighborhood well-served by public transportation, this
small family-run hotel is only steps from most major attractions and good
local restaurants and nightlife. The whole hotel is non-smoking, and the
staff offers attentive service. Guest rooms are spacious and tastefully — if
somewhat sparsely — decorated with all the essentials, including large tile
and marble baths.

Hotel Hassler
$$$$
Piazza di Spagna
If money is no object, this luxury hotel is the place to be in Rome, with its
sophisticated elegance and fantastic location on the Spanish Steps. The
basic double rooms are not as opulent and spacious as their deluxe coun-
terparts, which are basically junior suites, but you enjoy the same top
amenities and most have a view over the inner garden. Bathrooms are
wonderful, marble-clad retreats. The hotel also offers bicycles to take to
nearby Villa Borghese, terraces for taking in the view, and a number of bars
and restaurants, including the recently opened Imago, serving creative
Italian fare on the roof of the hotel.

Hotel Parlamento
$$
Pantheon
Right in the heart of Renaissance Rome, near Piazza di Spagna, Trevi
Fountain, and the Pantheon, Hotel Parlamento is on the third and fourth
floors of a 15th-century building and offers great accommodations at excel-
lent prices (off-season prices can be half the rack rate). Rooms are bright
and spacious, with tiled floors, large beds, and comfortable bathrooms,
some of which have tubs. Weather permitting, breakfast is served on the
pleasant roof terrace. Guests have free Internet access, but air-condition-
ing is an extra charge of 12€ ($19) per day and must be booked at the time
of your reservation.
See map p. 114. Via delle Convertite 5, off Piazza San Silvestro. %/fax: 06-69921000.
www.hotelparlamento.it. Bus: 492 or 116 to Piazza San Silvestro. 190€ ($304)
double. Rates include breakfast. MC, V.
Hotel Santa Maria
$$
Trastevere
This small hotel occupies a block of low buildings surrounding a romantic
garden-courtyard lined by a portico. Most of the good-size guest rooms
are on the first floor and open directly onto the courtyard (except one
garret suite on the second floor). Rooms are cozy and welcoming, deco-
rated with terra cotta–tiled floors, whitewashed walls, and dark-wood fur-
niture; however, they can be a bit dark on rainy days, as all light naturally
comes from the portico. The courtyard, though, is a pleasant place to take
breakfast on a sunny morning; in the afternoon and early evening, guests
can have a glass of wine at the wine bar. The suites are on two levels and
are designed for families with children (up to six beds).

Hotel Sant’Anselmo
$$$$
Aventino
In a former private villa surrounded by a garden, this hotel opens onto a
charming and quiet piazza in our favorite neighborhood in Rome. One of
three sister-hotels (they share the reservation office with Hotel Aventino
and Villa San Pio) Sant’Anselmo is the most elegant, with stucco and fres-
coed walls and ceilings. Some of its rooms are palatial and ornate, with
four-poster beds, opulent fabrics, and vaulted ceilings. All bathrooms are
good-size and decorated with marble or mosaic tiles.

Hotel Teatro di Pompeo
$$
Campo de’ Fiori
In the lively and historic neighborhood of Campo de’ Fiori, this moderately
priced choice has plenty of charm. The name of the hotel refers to the
Ancient Roman theater dating from 55 B.C. that lies beneath the hotel —
some of its structure can still be seen in the breakfast room. The rest of
the building is much newer — that is, from the 15th century — as evi-
denced by the beamed ceilings in some of the rooms, all of which are old-
fashioned and charming. Three more rooms are in a nearby annex, on the
third floor with no elevator.
See map p. 114. Largo del Pallaro 8. % 06-68300170. Fax: 06-68805531. www.hotel

Rose Garden Palace
$$$$
Via Veneto
In the exclusive area around Via Veneto, you find this hotel housed in a
Liberty (Italian Art Nouveau) building from the beginning of the 20th cen-
tury. The eponymous inner rose garden is perfect for a private stroll and
a meal in the enclosed veranda. Charm isn’t the only thing you find here,
however — the amenities are top-notch as well. The marble bathrooms
have both showers and bathtubs; the rooms themselves are large, sleek,
and modern. A state-of-the-art health club and indoor swimming pool are
on-site. Check the Web site for special online rates.
See map p. 114. Via Boncompagni 19. % 06-421741. Fax: 06-4815608. www.rose

385€–440€ ($616–$704) double. Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Villa San Pio
$$$
Aventino
This is our favorite of the three beautifully located and family-run hotels
on the Aventino (see Hotel Aventino and Hotel Sant’Anselmo). It occupies
a peaceful spot, surrounded by a large private garden, yet only steps from
attractions and transportation. Guest rooms are large and elegantly deco-
rated, with period furniture, delicate frescoes and moldings on the walls,
fine fabrics, and wooden or tiled floors. Good-sized marble bathrooms add
to the value.

Runner-up accommodations
Albergo Santa Chiara
$$$
Navona/Pantheon
More moderately priced than the Senato (see
review earlier in the chapter), this hotel that has been operated since 1838
by the Corteggiani family is only steps from the Pantheon. It is named for
St. Clare, St. Francis’s spiritual sister, who lived her last years in a room in
this building (now a chapel that you can visit). Guest rooms vary in size
and a few are a bit cramped, but all are nicely decorated, with decent-size
new bathrooms. See map p. 114. Via Santa Chiara 21. % 06-6872979. Fax:

Grand Hotel de la Minerve
$$$$
Navona/Pantheon
This very elegant hotel on one of our favorite
piazze in Rome is steps from the Pantheon and offers magnificent accom-
modations and service to boot. In a 17th-century palace, the spacious
guest rooms are appointed with stylish contemporary furnishings; some
have beautifully decorated ceilings with fine moldings. The marble bath-
rooms are large and contain all manner of amenities. In warm weather, the
hotel’s restaurant moves to the roof garden, where you can enjoy a gor-
geous view of the dome-studded skyline. Live music is hosted in the bar
every evening. See map p. 114. Piazza della Minerva 69. % 06-695201. Fax:
06-6794165. www.grandhoteldelaminerve.it.
Hotel Alpi
$$
Repubblica
In a Liberty-style (Italian Art Nouveau) building, this
family-run hotel offers quiet and classy accommodations. Guest rooms are
medium-size with hardwood or carpeted floors and nicely appointed
marble bathrooms (not huge but not tiny either). Some are furnished in
classic and other in contemporary style. Service is attentive and friendly,
and children get some extra attentions in the room. The hotel’s kitchen is
available for in-room dining, and Wi-Fi is available in public spaces. See

Via Veneto
Right off Piazza Barberini, this small charming hotel
offers tastefully furnished guest rooms with marble bathrooms; some
rooms have a balcony or a terrace. The refined ambience is pleasant with-
out being stuffy. See map p. 114. Via della Purificazione 4, off Piazza Barberini.

Repubblica
This moderately priced hotel boasts pleasant and 
elegant accommodations in a good location. Guest rooms — while not
huge — are smartly appointed with neoclassic or modern furnishings;
some have private terraces equipped with table and chairs, while others
have charming architectural details like vaulted ceilings. Each marble
bathroom is outfitted with a sun-tanning lamp. The “welcome drink” and

Hotel Duca d’Alba
$$
Colosseo
At the heart of a lively neighborhood with lots of small
restaurants and pubs, this hotel is basically equidistant from the
Colosseum, Roman Forum, Santa Maria Maggiore, and Piazza Venezia.
Guest rooms are contemporary, and the small bathrooms are nicely done
in marble. The buffet breakfast, which includes continental choices as well
as fresh eggs and bacon, is one of the best in this price range. See map p.

Piazza di Spagna
A splendid location and moderate prices are the
key characteristics of this small family-run hotel on the second floor of a
historic building, within walking distance of the Spanish Steps. Service is
kind and attentive, and a 24-hour Internet point is at reception. Guest
rooms and bathrooms are decent-size and pleasantly appointed —
although quite basic — with tiled floors and simple furnishings. The roof
terrace where breakfast is served is delightful. See map p. 114. Via Capo Le

Hotel Sant’Anna
$$
San Pietro
In a 16th-century building centered around a garden-
courtyard (where breakfast is served in nice weather), the Sant’Anna offers
excellent value a stone’s throw from the Vatican. The large rooms contain
elegant modern furnishings and good-sized marble bathrooms; a number
of them have coffered ceilings. The vaulted breakfast room has bright
fresco decorations. See map p. 114. Via Borgo Pio 133. % 06-68801602. Fax:

Dining Out
In case you hadn’t noticed, Rome is a very large city. While average restau-
rant quality is high overall, it’s certainly possible to find some nondescript
— if not downright bad — eateries. Fashionable restaurants and gourmet
addresses abound, though, and Rome also offers a great number of
simple, down-to-earth trattorie and osterie preparing excellent traditional
Roman fare. Restaurants crowd the historic center, with the highest con-
centration in the area around Campo de’ Fiori, in Trastevere, and in the
Navona/Pantheon and Trevi areas, in that order. See Chapter 2 for more
on Roman cuisine, eating hours, smoking rules, and dress codes.

ROMAN/SEAFOOD
This restaurant will satisfy both gourmands looking for creative dishes and
those seeking traditional Roman cuisine. The chef claims to have invented
Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 121

the crudo (“raw” — as in raw fish) Italian style, and he keeps researching
new flavors: The ever-changing menu may list a napoleon with local fish
mousse in white-wine sauce or his version of the classic zuppa di fagioli e
frutti di mare (bean and seafood stew). The tasting menus range from
Roman traditional (50€/$80) to the chef’s grand cuisine (84€/$134).
See map p. 114. Piazza San Cosimato 40. % 06-5818668. www.alberto

Colosseo
ROMAN/SEAFOOD/PIZZA
A local favorite, this is another stronghold of Roman cuisine that may look
like a tourist trap due to its perfect location across from the Roman Forum
but it’s actually an authentic traditional restaurant. We definitely recom-
mend the bucatini all’amatriciana (tomato-and-bacon sauce with pecorino
cheese), the saltimbocca alla romana (sautéed veal with ham and sage),
and — when on the menu — the pollo alla Romana (chicken stewed with
red and yellow peppers). It also serves nice fish dishes that vary with
market offerings (check the display by the entrance). The terrace is a great
plus in nice weather, but service may get slow.

ROMAN/CREATIVE ITALIAN/FISH
Enlivening Roman cuisine with new combinations that Grandma never
imagined, this restaurant offers a great menu full of subtle and delicious
combinations in addition to solid local dishes. The maccheroni all’amatri-
ciana (macaroni in a spicy tomato and bacon sauce) is excellent, but so
are the less expected spaghetti aglio olio e mazzancolle (spaghetti with
garlic, olive oil, and local prawns), the tonno arrosto con melanzane (baked
tuna with eggplant), and the anatra in salsa di frutta secca (duck in dried-
fruit sauce).

PIZZA
This is our favorite pizzeria in Rome — an old-fashioned place that serves
real Rome-style pizza, which is thinner and crunchier, and has more top-
pings, than its Neapolitan counterpart. Its two floors get filled to the brim
with young and not-so-young customers; tourists usually sit at the few out-
side tables. Bruce is partial to the rughetta e pomodori (arugula and cherry
tomatoes), Alessandra to the capricciosa (mushrooms, ham, and artichoke
hearts), but we recommend them all.

Lunch on the go in Rome
In addition to the ubiquitous bars (see Chapter 2), pizza is always a good choice, par-
ticularly if you have kids with you. Rome’s pizza parlors that serve pizza by weight (a
taglio) provide a quick and inexpensive meal that you can either take away or eat on
the spot (standing up at a table). Our favorite — and the most strategically located —
are Pizza (Via del Leoncino 28; % 06-6867757), Pizza a Taglio (Via della Frezza 40; 
% 06-3227116), Pizza (Via della Penna 14; % 06-7234596), Pizza Rustica (Via del

(see Chapter 12). For supplies, try Fattoria la Parrina (Largo Toniolo 3, between Piazza

Elegant and hip, this restaurant serves well-prepared food at moderate

dishes, like the lasagna prepared so well here. The tagliatelle alla Bolognese
(homemade pasta with tomato and meat sauce) and the fritto di verdure e

Generations of Romans have flocked here for the excellent service and
homemade food, which includes hard-to-find Roman classics. The chefs are
justly famous for their beans (hence the name, translating as “the bean
eater”) that they still cook al fiasco (inside an old-fashioned wine bottle) or
as a pasta soup — both are excellent choices. Our favorite pasta dish is the
spaghetti alla gricia (with cured bacon and Parmesan), but many diners
come for the carbonara (spaghetti with egg and Italian bacon), as well as the
trippa alla romana (traditionally prepared tripe) and the coda alla vacci-
nara (ox-tail stew). We recommend dining on the terrace in good weather.

Need a gelato break?
Why waste your time — and calories — with industrial ice cream when you can have
handmade gelato? Here are a few of the best (in our not-so-modest opinion) in Rome:
Giolitti, Via Uffici del Vicario 40 (% 06-6991243; Minibus: 116), is the oldest gelato
parlor in Rome and is reliably excellent. Il Gelato, Piazza Sant’Eustachio 47, near the
Pantheon (no telephone) is a new but highly recommended addition. Pica, Via della
Seggiola 12 (% 06-6880-3275; Tram: 8), near Campo de’ Fiori, is another good address.
Near Fontana di Trevi, head for Gelateria Cecere, Via del Lavatore 84 (% 06-679-2060;
Bus: 116 or 492). In Trastevere, we love Gelateria alla Scala, Via della Scala 5 
(% 06-5813174; Tram: 8), and in Prati, Gelateria dei Gracchi, Via dei Gracchi 272 
(% 06-3216668; Metro: Lepanto). Note: Always make sure the establishment is billed
as a GELATERIA and has a sign saying PRODUZIONE PROPRIA: It means they make their own
ice cream, and it will be fresh and delicious.

If an establishment can be all things to all people, this is it: a restaurant,

The pasta dishes are tasty — if it’s on the menu, try the carbonara di mac-
cheroncini con fave (carbonara with homemade pasta and fava beans) or
trancio di tonno alla cajun con finocchi e olio di agrumi (Cajun tuna steak
with fennel and citrus oil). As for the pizzas, we are partial to cicoria e

couscous to wok-prepared Asian dishes and Continental recipes. Popular
among office workers during the day and young people at night, the restau-
rant keeps late hours. A great brunch buffet is served on Saturday and
Sunday, but service and quality are sometimes uneven. The osteria in back

Ethnic and other non-Italian dining
“When in Rome do as Romans do” goes the adage, and indeed, you find that Rome’s
cosmopolitan population has embraced the local culinary culture; though ethnic
restaurants are rare and often more expensive than Italian ones. At the ubiquitous
Chinese joint — about one per neighborhood and none to write home about — you will
spend the same as at the local trattoria or pizzeria. Other establishments are fancy
places where Romans go for something special or exotic, and they have prices to
match.
We love Japanese food, and some of the city’s best is available at Hasekura (Via dei
Serpenti 27; % 06-483648; open Mon–Sat 12:30–3 p.m. and 7:30–11 p.m.) and Hamasei
(Via della Mercede 35; % 06-6792134; open Tues–Sun 12:30–2:30 p.m. and 7:30–11

open Tues–Sun 12–11 p.m.) is a sushi bar cum bookstore and art gallery, with a small
Zen garden. Their best deal is the prix-fixe lunch for 12€ ($19). We also love the French
Colonial Eau Vive (Via Monterone 86; % 06-68801095; open Mon–Sat 12:30–2:30 p.m.
and 7:30–10:30 p.m.). A few other interesting choices are South American cuisine at

and Caribbean at Macondo (Via Marianna Dionigi 37; % 06-3212601; open Mon–Sat
7:30–11 p.m.). Oriental Express (Via Calatafimi 7; % 06-4818791; open daily 12–3:30

the moderately priced Il Guru (Via Cimarra 4; % 06-4744110; open Mon–Sat 7:30–10:30

European cuisine is priced more moderately: Bistrot d’Hubert (Via Sardegna 135; 
% 06-42013161; open Mon–Fri 12:30–3 p.m. and Mon–Sat 7:30–10:30 p.m.; closed three

try Austro-Hungarian Birreria Viennese (Via della Croce, 21, off Piazza di Spagna;

Cantina Tirolese (Via Vitelleschi 23, off Castel Sant’Angelo to the west; % 06-68135297;
www.cantinatirolese.it; open Tues–Sat). We also like Charly’s Saucière (Via
San Giovanni in Laterano 270; % 06-70495666), the best Swiss restaurant in Rome
offering all the great classics, from steak tartare to fondue. For Greek, head to Ouzerie
(Via dei Salumi 2; % 06-5816378; open Mon–Sat; live music Fri and Sat). Not really an
ethnic restaurant — but certainly an alternative to Italian cuisine — Naturist Club CMI
(Via della Vite 14 on the fifth floor; % 06-6792509; open Mon–Sat) offers organic veg-
etarian meals and a menu that changes daily.

Roman classics Chef Angelo Troiani concocts. The menu varies, and you
might find the much imitated sorbetto di pomodoro (savory tomato sher-
bet) and the superb quaglia allo spiedo (roasted quail with gnocchi, spicy
mango, and duck foie gras sauce). Leave enough room for dessert, which
is excellent. The wine list is extensive and well priced.

Luxury dining in Rome’s top hotels
If you think of hotel dining as only a last resort, you might be missing a once-in-a-life-
time experience. As the best hotels in Rome compete for Michelin stars and other culi-
nary titles, their restaurants have reached unprecedented highs and become the
favorite destination of gourmets in the know. They are rarely cheap, but always ele-
gant (if not simply luxurious), plus you get to enjoy unique locations and views. If you
don’t mind the trip (by taxi, of course), the best is La Pergola, at the Rome Cavalieri
Hilton (Via A. Cadlolo 101, up the Monte Mario hill; % 06-35092152; www.

hotelderussie.it; open: daily 12:30–3 p.m. and 7:30–11 p.m.), should be visited
mainly for the splendid inner garden — the cuisine is very good but overpriced.
Olympus, on the roof terrace of the Bernini Bristol (Piazza Barberini 23; % 06-488931;
www.berninibristol.com; open daily 12:30–3 p.m. and 7:30–11 p.m.), enjoys a
unique 360-degree view over Rome (this is the hotel that served as the background
location for many scenes of Angels and Demons); while dinner is moderately priced,
the cuisine is nothing special.

Pizzeria Ivo

Trastevere
PIZZA
One of Rome’s most established pizzerie, Ivo is as popular with locals as
it is with visitors. Luckily, the place is big! Here you can enjoy an entire
range of pizzeria appetizers, pizzas, crostini, and calzones. All the pizzas
are good, but we love the capricciosa (prosciutto, baby artichokes, and
olives) and the seasonal one with fiori di zucca (zucchini flowers).

Piazza di Spagna
ROMAN
We’re always surprised to find that this restaurant, only a few steps from
Piazza di Spagna, has not become a tourist trap. Instead, this small
eatery — with a few tables outside in good weather — continues to be
frequented by locals who come for the traditional Roman cuisine. We
recommend the specialty, coratella d’abbacchio con cipolla (sautéed
onions and lamb liver and organ meat), but you can also choose from
the well-rounded menu.

Sora Lella
$$
Trastevere
ROMAN
This family-run restaurant — created by the sister of the famous Roman
actor Aldo Fabrizi and now managed by his son and grandsons — was
already a Roman institution, but with the recent renovations both in the
dining room and on the menu, it has won new admirers. The gnocchi are
superb, and complementing the solid traditional menu are many more
modern dishes, such as the delicious polpettine al vino (small meatballs
in a wine sauce). Tasting menus and a vegetarian menu are available, and
the traditional Roman contorni, such as cicoria (dandelion greens) and car-
ciofi (Roman artichokes), are exceptional.

Information
The tourist information hot line at % 060608
can provide you with information in four
languages, including English, from 9 a.m. to
7 p.m. See “Finding information after you
arrive,” earlier in this chapter, for locations
of tourist info kiosks. For cultural events,
the best resource is The Happening City, a
free monthly publication (available in
English) distributed at the information
kiosks. For restaurants and nightlife, buy
the magazine Time Out Rome. Also avail-
able at newsstands are Roma C’è, which
has a section in English and comes out on
Thursdays, and Wanted In Rome, an all-
English publication.
Internet Access
Most hotels in Rome offer free online
access to their guests, and Internet cafes
are everywhere. One good chain is 
Internet Train
(www.internettrain.it), with loca-
tions at Via delle Fornaci 22 near San Pietro
(open Mon–Sat 6:30 a.m.–8:30 p.m. and Sun
6:30 a.m.–1 p.m.); Piazza Sant’Andrea della
Valle 3 near Piazza Navona (open Mon–Fri
10:30 a.m.–11 p.m. and Sat–Sun 10:30 a.m.–8
p.m.), and Via delle Fratte di Trastevere 44/b
(open daily 10 a.m.–10 p.m.). Another is Yex
(www.yex.it), with a perfect location off

Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, only steps from
Piazza Navona (Piazza Sant’Andrea della
Valle 1; open 10 a.m.–10 p.m. seven days a
week). Charges usually run around 5€ ($8)
per hour.
Maps
If you want something more detailed than
the free tourist map, we recommend you
buy a map with a stradario (street direc-
tory), available at newsstands. One of the
best, albeit a bit bulky, is Tutto Città, which
costs about 8€ ($13) and is a largish book-
let with a full street directory.
Newspapers and Magazines
All the newspaper kiosks in the historic
center sell the European issues of Time,
The Economist, and the Financial Times.
The kiosk on Via Veneto, off Piazza
Barberini across from the U.S. Embassy,
has a particularly large selection.
Pharmacies
Pharmacies are usually open Monday
through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and
again from 4 to 7:30 p.m. A few pharmacies
are open all night: Piazza dei Cinquecento
49, at Termini Station (% 06-4880019); Via
Cola di Rienzo 213 (% 06-3244476); Piazza
Risorgimento 44 (% 06-39738166); Via
Arenula 73 (% 06-68803278); Corso
Rinascimento 50 (% 06-68803985); Piazza
Barberini 49 (% 06-4871195); and Viale
Trastevere 229 (% 06-5882273).
Police
There are two police forces in Italy; call
either one. For the Polizia, dial % 113; for
the Carabinieri, dial % 112.
Post Office
The main post office in the historic center is
located at Piazza San Silvestro 19, not far
from Piazza di Spagna. You also find post
offices at Via di Porta Angelica 23, near San
Pietro, and Viale Mazzini 101, in the Cola di
Rienzo area. They’re open Monday through
Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and
Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. For infor-
mation, call % 800-160000.
Many tourists prefer to use the Vatican post
office (by the entrance to the Vatican
Museums) while they’re visiting St. Peter’s
in Rome; it’s the same price as Italian post
offices but sometimes faster, and you get
special Vatican stamps. Note: You can only
mail letters with Vatican stamps from the
blue mailboxes in the Vatican.
Restrooms
Public toilets are few and far between. You
find some outside the Colosseum on the
southeast side; halfway up the steps from
Piazza del Popolo to the Pincio, on the left
side; and facing San Pietro, under the
colonnade on the right. Make sure you have
some change to tip the attendant. Your best
bet may be to go to a nice-looking cafe
(though you have to buy something, like a
cup of coffee, to use the restroom).
Safety
Rome is a very safe city; however, petty
theft is common. Pickpockets abound in
tourist areas, on public transportation, and
around crowded open-air markets like the
Porta Portese. Maintain common big-city
caution: Keep your valuables in your hotel’s
safe, don’t be distracted, watch your
belongings, don’t count your money in
public, and avoid displaying valuable jew-
elry and electronic equipment. Areas of
poverty where a wealthy-looking tourist
with an expensive camera may be mugged
after dark exist, but those are way out on
the outskirts of the city.
If you’re a woman traveling alone, chances
are you’ll attract young men’s attention.
Rome has become a cosmopolitan city, 
but the way you dress might offend some
Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 133

cultural segments. In general, the dress
code is stricter in Rome than in the United
States; and while you see a lot of female
skin displayed, you also notice that these
women are always in groups. If you are
alone, you might want to cover up a bit.
Also, it is a good idea not to wander too far
off the beaten path at night if you are alone:
The area around Termini train station can
be unsafe for lone women, and so are some
deserted, dark, and narrow streets in the
historical center. Should you feel harassed,
just immediately speak up and don’t hesi-
tate to ask for help from a passerby or enter
in a cafe or shop and ask for the attendants’
assistance.
Smoking
In 2005, Italy passed a law outlawing smok-
ing in most public places. Smoking is
allowed only where there is a separate,
ventilated area for nonsmokers. If you want
to smoke at your table, call beforehand to
make sure the restaurant or cafe you plan
to visit offers a smoking area.
Taxes
See Chapter 5 for information on IVA (Value
Added Tax).
Taxis
Walk to one of the numerous taxi stands —
some of the most central include Termini
rail station, Piazza della Repubblica, Piazza
Barberini (at the foot of Via Veneto), Piazza
San Silvestro, Piazza SS. Apostoli, Piazza
Venezia, Via Zanardelli, Vicolo del
Gallinaccio (Trevi fountain), Piazza della
Cancelleria, Piazza Mastai in Trastevere,
and Piazza del Risorgimento. For radio taxi
service call % 06-88177, 06-6645, 06-4994,
06-5551, or 800-090214.
Transit Info
The local public transportation authority
(for bus, tram, and subway) is ATAC 
(% 800-431784 or 06-46952027;
www.atac.roma.it). For railroad 
information, call Trenitalia (% 892021;
www.trenitalia.it).
Weather Updates
No phone number provides weather fore-
casts in Italy, so your best bet is the news
on TV and the Web: Try www.cnn.com or
the best Italian sites meteo.ansa.it and
www.tempoitalia.it (in Italian only but
quite easy to use).

Exploring Rome
In This Chapter
 Experiencing Rome’s great attractions
 Checking out other fun things to see and do
 Going through Rome by guided tour
 Choosing from itineraries
 Finding Rome’s hot shopping spots
 Discovering Roman nightlife
I
nhabited for the past 3,000 years, the seven hills of Rome have
amassed such an array of artistic and cultural attractions that one
lifetime would not be enough to discover them all. Rome’s historic dis-
trict is still the city’s — and the country’s — political, business, and cul-
tural hub. To enjoy your Roman holiday, you have to accept sharing the
city with some four million residents and a portion of the 25 million
tourists who visit the city every year. Close your eyes — and ears — to
the traffic of cars, city buses, and hordes of motorini (mopeds and motor
bikes) buzzing around the ancient sites, and follow in the footsteps of
Caesar, turn down the same alleys trod by masters of the Renaissance,
thrill to the same lighted fountains reflected in the eyes of Fellini’s beau-
tiful debauchers, and follow the paths Catholic pilgrims have been
taking for some 13 centuries.
Rome wasn’t built in a day, or even a millennium, so don’t think you can
see it all in a day: Set aside several days to do the city right.
Even if you have one of the passes above, you must make advance reser-
vations for the Borghese Gallery through Ticketeria (% 06-32810 or 
% 199 757510 within Italy; Fax: 06-32651329; www.ticketeria.it), par-
ticularly in high season. You receive a reservation code to show at the
ticket booth when paying for your ticket (if you have a pass for free
admission, you’ll be charged only the reservation fee of 2€/$3.20). You
can also purchase full-price tickets online or make reservations for the
National Gallery of Ancient Art in Palazzo Barberini for an extra serv-
ice fee of 1€ ($1.60). Time slots are every 30 minutes within opening
hours (see listing later in this chapter).

We highly recommend booking an official guided tour for the Vatican
Museums, if only to avoid the horrendous queues at the ticket booth.
Bookings must be made a minimum of one week and a maximum of one
month in advance, so we recommend firming up your reservations
before you leave home (see Vatican Museums, later in this chapter).
You can buy the cumulative ticket to the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, and
Roman Forum at any of those sites, but usually you find the shortest line
at the Palatine Hill ticket booth. It is a good idea to buy it there even if
you intend to visit the Colosseum first: Once you have the ticket, you can
bypass the long line at the entrance. You can also buy your ticket at the
main Visitor Center of Via Parigi 5 (see Chapter 11), or, if you have access
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
136
Don’t pass up these deals
If you are planning to do a lot of sightseeing, the Roma Pass might just be the ticket.
The 20€ ($32) pass is valid for three days and grants you free admission to the first
two attractions you visit and discounts on all the following attractions as well as on a
number of events; you also get unlimited public transportation (bus, subway, and
trains) until midnight of the third day. The Roma&Più Pass costs 25€ ($40) and covers
attractions on the outskirts of Rome, such as the historic Villas of Tivoli (see “Finding
More Cool Things to See and Do,” later in this chapter). The passes are for sale online
and by phone (% 06-0608; www.romapass.it), as well as at each of the tourist
information points listed in Chapter 11 and at all participating museums.
If you’re planning an extensive visit to the sites of ancient Rome, the best deal is the
seven-day Roma Archeologia Card for 20€ ($32, or 22€/$35 if a special exhibit is on
at the Colosseum), which grants admission to the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, Roman
Forum, all the sites of the National Roman Museum — Palazzo Altemps, Palazzo
Massimo, Terme di Diocleziano, and Crypta Balbi — Caracalla Baths, and the two
sites of the Park of the Via Appia Antica that charge admission (Mausoleum of Cecilia
Metella, and Villa of the Quintili). You can purchase the card at all participating sites,
except those on the Via Appia (the least crowded are Crypta Balbi, Via delle Botteghe
Oscure 31, off Largo Argentina, and Terme di Diocleziano, Viale E. de Nicola 78, off
Piazza dell Repubblica near Termini), and also at the main Visitor Center of Via Parigi
5 (see Chapter 11).
If you are planning a visit to the attractions of Villa Borghese (see “Finding More Cool
Things to See and Do,” later in this chapter) — which include the Borghese Gallery
and National Gallery of Modern Art — the Villa Borghese Card may be a good deal:
10€ ($16) gets you a card that is valid for one year and grants you one free admission
to the attraction of your choice, discounted admissions to all others, and 10 percent
off purchases at the museums’ bookshops, as well as at the bar-restaurant at the Casa
del Cinema and the zoo. The card is for sale at all participating sites and at the tourist
information points listed in Chapter 11.
The Capitolini Card is valid seven days and includes admission to the Capitoline
Museums, Tabularium, and Centrale Montemartini for 8.50€ ($14).

to a printer, online at Pierreci (% 06-39967700; www.pierreci.it;
Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m. and 2:30–5 p.m. local time) for a service fee of
1.50€ ($2.40). Note: Don’t use the Pierreci Web site for other bookings, as
it is poorly designed and you could be charged extra fees.
To fully appreciate the Roman Forum, the Colosseum, and other ruins,
pick up a copy of Rome Past and Present, sold in bookstores or at news-
stands near the Forum for 10€ ($16). Its plastic overlays depict how
Rome looked 2,000 years ago.
Discovering Rome’s Top Attractions
The hardest part about sightseeing in Rome is choosing which sites to
see and which to leave out — at least this time around. Here is the roster
of our favorite attractions.
The Basilica of Saint John Lateran (Basilica di San Giovanni in
Laterano) and Cloister (Chiostro)
Colosseo
Built in A.D. 13 by Constantine, this is Rome’s cathedral (St. Peter’s Basilica
is in the separate city-state of the Vatican). Faithfully restored after each
of its misfortunes — being sacked by the Vandals (a barbarian tribe whose
name has given us the word vandalism), burned, and then damaged in an
896 earthquake — the impressive basilica is filled with artistic and reli-
gious treasures. The 18th-century facade is crowned by 15 giant statues
(7m/22 ft. tall) representing Christ, St. John the Baptist, John the
Evangelist, and other Church figures. The Egyptian obelisk in front of the
church is the tallest in Rome (32m/105 ft.), consecrated in the fourth cen-
tury as a symbol of Christianity’s victory over pagan cults. The interior of
the basilica as you see it today was designed by 17th-century architect
Borromini. The papal altar, with its beautiful 14th-century ciborium (a
vessel for storing the sacraments of Communion), houses the wooden
altar on which St. Peter officiated in the Catacombs. Another ciborium
over the altar of the Santissimo Sacramento, in the left transept, protects
the table from Christ’s Last Supper. Connected to the church is the origi-
nal baptistry built by Constantine in the fourth century; it was the first in
the Western world. Restored multiple times over the centuries, the bap-
tistry’s most recent renovation was during Borromini’s redesign of the
entire cathedral. Our favorite part of the church is the delightful 13th-cen-
tury cloister, which you can access from a side door. Guided tours of the
cathedral are offered for 5€ ($8) by Mater et Caput (% 06-69886392 for
reservations). Set aside at least an hour for your visit.
See map p. 138. Piazza di San Giovanni in Laterano. % 06-69886433. Metro: San
Giovanni. Bus: 81, 85, 850, or Minibus 117. Tram: 3. Admission: Basilica free; cloister
5€ ($8). Open: Basilica and cloister daily 7 a.m.–6:30 p.m.; Baptistry daily 9 a.m.–
1 p.m.

Borghese Gallery (Galleria Borghese)
Parioli
In 1613, Cardinal Scipione Borghese established this unique art gallery in
a splendid building surrounded by a grandiose park (see Villa Borghese,
“Finding More Cool Things to See and Do,” later in this chapter). A patron
of the arts, the Cardinal compiled Italy’s most stunning small collection,
with sculpture such as Canova’s sensual reclining Paulina Borghese as
Venus Victrix (Paulina was Napoleon’s sister) and the breathtaking David
by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The extensive collection of paintings contains
masterpieces like Caravaggio’s Bacchus, young Raphael’s Deposition, and
Tiziano’s Sacred and Profane Love. (The astounding number of true
works of art will make you long for a second visit.) Note: The gallery can
accommodate only 360 people, so reservations are mandatory. Visitors
enter and depart in batches every two hours. We prefer audio guides,
which allow you to set your own pace, but good guided tours are also avail-
able: Sign up for one at the ticket booth when you pick up your ticket. They
take place at 9:10 a.m. and 11:10 a.m. in English, and at 11:10 a.m., 3:10 p.m.,
and 5:10 p.m. in Italian.
Pick up your reserved ticket by showing your reservation code to the
ticket booth at least 30 minutes before your allotted time slot. You must
be on time for admission, or you lose your reservation, miss your turn,
and have to pay again for entrance at the next available time.
See map p. 138. Piazzale del Museo Borghese. % 06-8417645. www.galleria
borghese.it. Reservations required at % 06-32810 or www.ticketeria.it.
Bus: 52, 53, or 910 to Via Pinciana, behind the villa; 490 to Viale San Paolo del Brasile
inside the park; or Minibus 116 to the Galleria Borghese. Metro: Line A to Spagna; take
the Villa Borghese exit, and walk up Viale del Museo Borghese. Admission: 14€ ($22),
if no special exhibit 11€ ($17). Admission price includes booking fee. Audio guide 5€
($8). Guided tours 5€ ($8). Open: Tues–Sun ticket booth 8:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m. with admis-
sion at 9 a.m., 11 a.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m., and 5 p.m. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Capitoline Museums (Musei Capitolini)
Teatro Marcello
The oldest public collection in the world, these museums occupy the three
elegant buildings that open onto one of Michelangelo’s masterpieces:
Piazza del Campidoglio. Palazzo Nuovo holds a treasury of ancient sculp-
ture, and you should not miss the Capitoline Venus and the Dying Gaul.
The visit is much more enjoyable (and less cramped) since a number of
the largest pieces were moved to Centrale Montemartini (Via Ostiense
106; % 06-5748042; www.centralemontemartini.org), a post-modern
annex in a former power plant. Palazzo dei Conservatori houses more
sculpture: starting with the dismembered pieces of the ancient 40-foot
statue of Constantine II in the courtyard which you may have already seen
in photographs — the huge head, hands, foot, kneecap, and so on. The
famous Lupa Capitolina, a fifth-century-B.C. bronze that is the symbol of
Rome, depicts a wolf suckling Romulus and Remus. On the top floor is the
Pinacoteca Capitolina (picture gallery), a superb collection of European
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
140

paintings from masters of the 17th and 18th centuries, including
Caravaggio, Titian, Veronese, Rubens, and others. Between the Palazzo
Nuovo and Palazzo dei Conservatori, closing Piazza del Campidoglio to
the south, is the Palazzo Senatorio, which was built in the Middle Ages
over the Tabularium, an imposing Roman building that housed the public
archives of the Roman Republic. You can clearly see its remains from the
Forum (3 of the original 11 arcades remain), and you can now visit it;
admission is included in the ticket. An in-depth tour of these museums can
take up to four hours, but you can squeeze in the highlights in about two.
See map p. 138. Piazza del Campidoglio 1, off Piazza Venezia. % 06-67102475.
www.museicapitolini.org. Bus: Minibus 117. Admission: 6.50€ ($10) or 8€
($13) when a special exhibit is on. Audio guides: 4€ ($6.40). Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–8
p.m.; Dec 24 and Dec 31 9 a.m.–2 p.m. Ticket booth closes 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan
1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Caracalla Baths (Terme di Caracalla)
Aventino
Built by the Roman Emperor Caracalla, these baths were completed in A.D.
216 and operated until 537. They are the best-preserved large thermal
baths in Rome, with some of their rich decoration still visible: enormous
columns, hundreds of statues, colored marble and mosaic floors, marble,
stucco, and frescoes on the walls. The baths in Roman times were much
more than just a place to wash; people also came here to relax and to exer-
cise. After entering the building from the porticos on the northeast side,
Romans would use the dressing rooms first, and then move through the
deep cleansing area, a sort of sauna similar to Turkish baths: starting with
the caldarium (hot room) and then proceeding to the tepidarium (first cool-
ing down), the frigidarium (complete cooling down), and natatio (swim-
ming pool). Two gymnasia (exercise rooms) were also provided, with
trainers on duty, as well as gardens for reading and relaxing. The modern
visitor should plan to spend about an hour here.
See map p. 138. Via delle Terme di Caracalla 52. % 06-39967700. www.archeorm.
arti.beniculturali.it. Metro: Circo Massimo. Bus: 118, 160, 628. Admission:
6€ ($9.60). Ticket is valid seven days and includes admission to Mausoleum of Cecilia
Metella, and Villa of the Quintili in the Appia Antica Park. Audio guide: 4€ ($6.40).
Open: Mon 9 a.m.–2 p.m., Tues–Sun 9 a.m. to 1 hour before sunset. Ticket booth closes
1 hour earlier. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Castel Sant’Angelo (Hadrian’s Mausoleum)
San Pietro
This “castle” is a perfect example of recycling Roman style: It began as a mau-
soleum to hold the remains of Emperor Hadrian, was then transformed into
a fortress, and is now a museum. Built in A.D. 123, it may have been incorpo-
rated into the city’s defenses as early as 403 and was attacked by the Goths
(one of the barbarian tribes who pillaged Rome in its decline) in 537. Later,
the popes used it as a fortress and hideout, and for convenience connected
it to the Vatican palace by an elevated corridor — the passetto — which you
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 141

can still see near Borgo Pio, stretching between St. Peter’s and the castle.
Castel Sant’Angelo houses a museum of arms and armor; you can also visit
the elegant papal apartments from the Renaissance, as well as the horrible
cells in which political prisoners were kept (among them sculptor Benvenuto
Cellini). On Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, they offer a guided tour in
English of the prisons for 3€ ($4.80); it is best to reserve in advance at the
phone number below. Count on about two hours for a full visit.
See map p. 138. Lungotevere Castello 50. % 06-6819111. www.castelsantangelo.
com. Bus: 62 or 64 to Lungotevere Vaticano. Admission: 5€ ($8). Audio guides: 4€
($6.40). Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7:30 p.m., Dec 31 9 a.m.–2 p.m. Ticket booth closes 1
hour earlier. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Catacombs of Saint Callixtus (Catacombe di San Callisto)
Park of Appia Antica
These are the best catacombs in Rome and the most impressive, with
20km (13 miles) of tunnels and galleries that descend 18m (60 ft.). It’s
pretty cold down there, even during the summer, so bring a sweater. Early
Christians held mass, celebrated rites, and buried their dead in these
underground hideouts which were later termed catacombs. Dedicated to
St. Callixtus (Callixtus III was elected pope in 217), these catacombs were
created inside abandoned quarries of travertine and volcanic sand, and
organized over four levels, with some of the original paintings and deco-
rations still intact. Visits are led by a guide who will give you an introduc-
tion and then take you for a 30-minute walk; listen well as they don’t allow
lingering for questions once underground. Be advised that taking photos
is strictly forbidden. If catacombs interest you, we also recommend a visit
to two others located nearby: the Catacombs of St. Sebastian (Via Appia
Antica 136; % 06-7850350) and Catacombs of Ste. Domitilla (Via delle
Sette Chiese 282; % 06-5110342).
Via Appia Antica 110. % 06-51301580. www.catacombe.roma.it. Bus/Metro:
Metro A to San Giovanni stop, then bus 218 to Fosse Ardeatine stop. Admission: 5€
($8). Open: Thurs–Tues 9 a.m. to noon and 2–5 p.m. Closed Feb and Jan 1, Easter day,
and Dec 25.
Colosseum (Colosseo or Anfiteatro Flavio)
Colosseo
The Colosseum, along with St. Peter’s Basilica, is Rome’s most recognizable
monument. Begun under the Flavian Emperor Vespasian and finished in A.D.
80, it was named the Amphitheatrum Flavium. The nickname came from the
colossal statue of Nero that was erected nearby in the second century A.D.
The Colosseum could accommodate up to 73,000 spectators of entertain-
ment that included fights between gladiators and battles with wild animals.
In the labyrinth of chambers beneath the original wooden floor of the
amphitheater, deadly weapons, vicious beasts, and gladiators were readied
for mortal combat. (Contrary to popular belief, the routine feeding of Chris-
tians to lions is a legend.) After the end of the Roman Empire, the Colosseum
was damaged by fires and earthquakes and eventually abandoned; it was
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
142

then used as a marble quarry for the monuments of Christian Rome until
Pope Benedict XV consecrated it in the 18th century. Special exhibitions
are often held inside the Colosseum. Guided tours are available for 4€
($6.40) and must be booked in advance from Pierreci (see p. 137).
Next to the Colosseum is the Arch of Constantine, built in 315 to com-
memorate the emperor’s victory over the pagan Maxentius in 312. Pieces
from other monuments were reused, so Constantine’s monument includes
carvings honoring Marcus Aurelius, Trajan, and Hadrian. Plan to spend
about an hour for your visit to the Colosseum.
See map p. 138. Via dei Fori Imperiali. % 06-39967700. www.archeoroma.
beniculturali.it. Metro: Colosseo. Bus: Minibus 117. Admission: 11€ ($18), 9€
($14) when no exhibitions. Ticket includes admission to Roman Forum and Palatine
Hill; it is valid 2 days for 1 admission to each site and can be purchased at either site.
Audio guides: 4.50€ ($7.20). Open: Daily 9 a.m. to 1 hour before sunset. Ticket booth
closes 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
National Etruscan Museum of Villa Giulia (Museo Nazionale
Etrusco di Villa Giulia)
Villa Borghese
This splendid papal villa, built by the most prominent architects of the
16th century for Pope Julius, houses the world’s most important Etruscan
collection. Originally from Asia Minor, the Etruscans were a mysterious
people who dominated Tuscany and Lazio, including Rome, up to the fifth
century B.C. Many of the objects in this museum came from Cerveteri, an
important Etruscan site northwest of Rome. One of the most spectacular
objects is the bride-and-bridegroom sarcophagus from the sixth century
B.C., upon which two enigmatic figures recline. You can also see a fairly
well-preserved chariot and some impressive sculptures. Some of the most
amazing works are the tiniest: The Etruscans made intricate decorative
objects from woven gold. (Their goldsmithing techniques remain a mys-
tery today.) Allow three hours for a full visit.
See map p. 138. Piazzale di Villa Giulia 9. % 06-3226571. Tram: 3 or 19 to last stop and
then walk down Viale delle Belle Arti to Piazzale di Villa Giulia, or 225 to Via di Villa
Giulia. Admission: 4€ ($6.40). Audio guides: 4€ ($6.40). Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30
p.m. Ticket booth closes 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
National Gallery of Ancient Art in Palazzo Barberini (Galleria
Nazionale d’Arte Antica in Palazzo Barberini)
Via Veneto
Completed in 1633, the Palazzo Barberini is a magnificent example of a
baroque Roman palace. Bernini decorated the rococo apartments in which
the gallery is now housed, and they’re certainly luxurious. The collection
of paintings that make up the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica is most
impressive, including Caravaggio’s Narcissus; Tiziano’s Venus and
Adonis; and Raphael’s La Fornarina, a loving, informal portrait of the
bakery girl who was his mistress (and the model for his Madonnas). In
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 143

addition to the permanent collections, the gallery regularly houses spe-
cial exhibits. Consider about two hours for a visit. Guided tours can only
be booked when you are reserving your ticket (see Ticketeria; p. 135) and
if enough participants sign up.
See map p. 138. Via delle Quattro Fontane 13. % 06-4824184. www.galleria
borghese.it. Metro: Barberini. Admission: 5€ ($8). Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30
p.m. Ticket booth closes 30 minutes earlier. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
National Gallery of Modern Art (GNAM — Galleria Nazionale
d’Arte Moderna)
Villa Borghese
Housed in the beautiful, Liberty-style (Italian Art Nouveau) Palazzo delle
Belle Arti, this important art museum preserves a rich collection of
modern art from the 19th and 20th centuries. Italian artists are largely rep-
resented, but the collection includes works by a variety of great artists. The
two sections dedicated to the 19th century hold a great selection of paint-
ings by artists of the Macchiaioli movement and a number of works by
French modern artists such as Rodin, van Gogh, and Monet, but the real
riches are in the two sections dedicated to the 20th century, where you can
admire a profusion of artwork by De Chirico, Giorgio Morandi, Marino
Marini, Lucio Fontana, and Giò Pomodoro, to name some highlights. The
collection also includes international names such as Pollock, Calder, and
Tàpies, among others. Schedule about two hours for your visit.
GNAM’s new annex, MAXXI (Via Reni 2, off Piazza Apollodoro; % 06-
3210181) is in the ex-Barracs Montello nearby; it holds the museum’s 21st-
century collection. Admission is free, and hours are Tuesday through
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
See map p. 138. Viale delle Belle Arti 131. (Via Gramsci 71 for visitors with disabilities.)
% 06-32298221. www.gnam.arti.beniculturali.it. Tram: 3, 19. Bus: 88, 95,
490, and 495. Admission: 9€ ($14). Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Last admis-
sion 40 minutes before closing.
National Roman Museum in Palazzo Altemps (Museo Nazionale
Romano Palazzo Altemps)
Navona/Pantheon
Behind Piazza Navona, this palazzo takes its name from the cardinal who
ordered it finished in the 1500s. It was restored (in such a way that you
can see the layers of medieval, Renaissance, and later decoration) to
house the Ludovisi Collection, one of the world’s most famous private art
collections, particularly strong in Greek and Roman sculpture as well as
Egyptian works. The single most important piece is the Trono Ludovisi, a
fifth-century-B.C. Greek masterpiece, finely carved to depict Aphrodite
Urania rising from the waves on one side; a female figure offering incense
on another; and a naked female playing a flute on yet another. The remark-
able Dying Gaul, depicting a man apparently committing suicide with a
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
144

sword, was commissioned by Julius Caesar and placed in his gardens to
commemorate his victories in Gaul. The colossal head of Hera (also
known as Juno) is one of the best-known Greek sculptures; Goethe wrote
of it as his “first love” in Rome and said it was like “a canto of Homer.” It
has been identified as an idealized portrait of Antonia Augusta, mother of
Emperor Claudius. Plan to spend at least one hour here.
See map p. 138. Piazza Sant’Apollinare 46. % 06-39967700. www.archeorm.
arti.beniculturali.it. Bus: Minibus 116 to Via dei Coronari; then walk away
from Piazza Navona. Admission: 7€ ($11); 10€ ($16) if special exhibitions are on. Ticket

and Diocletian Baths. Audio guides: 4€ ($6.40). Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7:45 p.m. Ticket
office closes 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
National Roman Museum in Palazzo Massimo alle Terme (Museo
Nazionale Romano Palazzo Massimo alle Terme)
Repubblica
This is our favorite museum of antiquity in Rome: The collection of ancient
Roman art (from decades of excavations in Rome and Rome’s environs) is
astounding and includes — at the upper level — a unique collection of
floor mosaics and frescoes. Entire rooms from the Villa of Livia on the
Palatine Hill have been reconstructed here, and you can enjoy the frescos
as they were meant to be. Note: You can visit the fresco collection by
guided tour only — you can sign up when you enter, but it is best to make
an advance reservation. Even the basement contains some fascinating
things: a very well done numismatic exhibit with coins dating from the
eighth century B.C. through the 21st century and explaining the economy
of ancient Rome and of Renaissance Italy; and the royal house of Savoy’s
collection of Roman jewelry, including many items from burial sites, such
as a rare Roman mummy of a Patrician child buried with her most pre-
cious belongings. The whole visit, including the tour of the fresco collec-
tion, will take you a minimum of two hours.

Cover Up
Bare shoulders, halter tops, tank tops, shorts (or skirts) above the knee will lead to
your being turned away at the entrance of churches and other Catholic sites: no kid-
ding, and no matter your age and sex. Dress appropriately, or carry a large scarf to
cover the offending parts. See Chapter 2 for more on local dress code.

Palatine Hill (Palatino)
Colosseo
This is one of our favorite spots in Rome: Huge blocks of brick surrounded
by trees and greenery testify mutely to what was once an enormous resi-
dential complex of patrician houses and imperial palaces, built with the
grandiose ambitions of the emperors. This hill is also where Romulus drew
the original square for the foundation of Rome and the first houses were
built: Indeed, excavations in the area uncovered remains that date back to
the eighth century B.C. Casa di Livia (Livia’s House) is one of the best-pre-
served homes. In what was once the Palace of Caesar — later transformed
into a convent — the Palatine Museum houses the most precious artwork
recovered from the archaeological excavations of the Palatino, including
frescoes and sculptures (admission is included in your ticket). Guided
tours are available in English and Spanish daily at 11:30 a.m. for 4.50€
($7.20); we recommend booking in advance. Depending on your pace and
whether you visit the museum, allot one-and-a-half and two-and-a-half
hours for your visit.

Pantheon
Navona/Pantheon
Rome’s best-preserved monument of antiquity, the imposing Pantheon was
rebuilt by the Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 125 over the smaller original temple
constructed by Marcus Agrippa in 27 B.C. as a temple for all the gods (from
the ancient Greek pan theon, meaning “all gods”). It was eventually saved
from destruction by being transformed into a Christian church in A.D. 609.
It is a building of perfect proportions: 43m (142 ft.) wide and 43m (142 ft.)
tall. The portico is supported by huge granite columns, all but three of
which are original, and the bronze doors weigh 20 tons each. Inside, the
empty niches surrounding the space once contained marble statues of
Roman gods; most of the marble floor is also original. Animals were once
sacrificed beneath the beautiful coffered dome, whose 5.4m (18-ft.) hole
(oculus) lets in the light (and sometimes rain) of the Eternal City. An archi-
tectural marvel, this dome inspired Michelangelo when he was designing
the dome of St. Peter’s, though he made the basilica’s dome 0.6m (2 ft.)
smaller. Inside, you find the tombs of the painter Raphael and of two of the
kings of Italy.
Piazza della Rotonda (Piazza del Pantheon to Romans), is one of Rome’s
nicest piazze, with cafes — as well as a McDonald’s, an addition much
opposed by the locals — lining its sides.

Free. Open: Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m., Sun 9 a.m.–6 p.m., holidays 9 a.m.–1 p.m.

Piazza di Spagna and Spanish Steps
Piazza di Spagna
The Piazza and its famous steps are one of the most popular meeting
places in Rome; in nice weather, you can barely see the ground for the
frenzy of tourists, lovers, backpackers, Roman youth, and so on. The
atmosphere is festive and convivial, though, and especially romantic in
spring, when the steps are decorated with colorful azaleas. The Piazza’s
name comes from the 16th century, when the Spanish ambassador made
his residence here. In those days, the piazza was far less hospitable.
(People passing through the piazza at night sometimes disappeared,
because it was technically Spanish territory, and the unwary could be
pressed into the Spanish army.) In more recent times, the area’s most
famous resident was English poet John Keats, who lived and died in the
house to the right of the steps, which is now the Keats–Shelley Memorial
House (% 06-6784235; www.keats-shelley-house.org; Admission:
4€/$6.40; Open: Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–6 p.m., Sat 11 a.m.–2 p.m. and
3–6 p.m.). When you climb the steps, you find their real name: Scalinata
della Trinità dei Monti, because they lead to the Trinità dei Monti church,
whose towers loom above. At the foot of the steps, the boat-shaped foun-
tain by Pietro Bernini, father of Gian Lorenzo, is one of the most famous in
Rome. In May 2007, a drunken vandal damaged the fountain on one side,
but he was quickly arrested; restoration was immediately started and
should be completed by the time you are reading this.
See map p. 138. Off Via del Babuino and Via dei Condotti. Metro: Line A to Spagna.
Bus: Minibus 117 or 119 to Piazza di Spagna.
Piazza Navona
Navona/Pantheon
Our favorite piazza in Rome, Piazza Navona is built on the first-century-A.D.
ruins of the Stadium of Domitian, where chariot races were held (note the
oval track form). The piazza is dominated by the twin-towered facade of
Sant’Agnese in Agone, a baroque masterpiece by Borromini, who reno-
vated and rebuilt the original church that had been constructed on the site
between the 8th and the 12th centuries. The interior was also redecorated
in the 17th century, but on the lower level, you find vestiges of Domitian’s
stadium, with an ancient Roman mosaic floor. The square’s other great
baroque masterpiece is Bernini’s Fountain of the Four Rivers, with mas-
sive figures representing the Nile, Danube, della Plata, and Ganges — 
the figure with the shrouded head is the Nile, because its source was
unknown at the time. Built in 1651 — and crowned by an obelisk, a Roman
copy from Domitian’s time — this fountain was a monumental addition to
the two simple fountains already existing at each end of the square and
created in 1576 by Giacomo della Porta. They were decorated with figures
only later: Bernini designed the figures of the Fountain of the Moor at the
piazza’s south end (the tritons and other ornaments are 19th-century
copies made to replace the originals, which were moved to the Villa
Borghese lake garden), while the figures of the Fountain of Neptune, at
the piazza’s north end, were added in the 19th century to balance the
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 147

piazza. On the southeast of the square, the Museo di Roma (Via di San
Pantaleo 10; % 06-67108346; www.museodiroma.comune.roma.it) occu-
pies the famous Palazzo Braschi.
See map p. 138. Off Corso Rinascimento. Bus: 70 or 116 to Piazza Navona.
Piazza San Pietro
San Pietro
One of the world’s greatest public spaces, Piazza San Pietro was designed
by Bernini in the 17th century. No cars are allowed in the huge piazza,
which is an ellipse partly enclosed by a majestic Doric-pillared colonnade,
atop which stand statues of some 140 saints. Straight ahead is the facade
of St. Peter’s Basilica; the two statues flanking the entrance represent St.
Peter and St. Paul, Peter carrying the Keys to the Kingdom. To the right,
above the colonnade, are the ochre buildings of the papal apartments and
the Vatican Museums (see later in this chapter). In the center of the square
is an Egyptian obelisk, brought from the ancient city of Heliopolis on the
Nile delta. On either side are 17th-century fountains — the one on the right
by Carlo Maderno, who designed the facade of St. Peter’s, was placed here
by Bernini himself; the one on the left is by Carlo Fontana. The piazza is
particularly magical at night during the Christmas season, when a presepio
(nativity scene) and a large tree take center stage.

Angelica, and follow it to the end.
Roman Forum (Foro Romano)
Colosseo
Lined with all the main administrative, religious, and commercial venues,
this was the heart of public life in ancient Rome. The forum lies in the
valley between the Capitoline Hill, site of the great Temple of Jupiter, and
the Palatine Hill, where the royal palace and those of the most noble fam-
ilies were located. The forum was built at the end of the seventh century
B.C. but a stone discovered under the forum in 1899 bears an inscription
from the sixth century B.C., the time of the Roman kings. The area was
marshy and a huge drainage and sewer canal was dug under the forum:
the Cloaca Massima, which continues to be used today. The main street of
the forum was Via Sacra, the “sacred street,” so called because it led to
the main temples on the Capitoline Hill (today, Piazza del Campidoglio);
you can still walk a stretch of it. Most of the buildings are now ruins (some,
like the sanctuary of the sewer goddess Venus Cloaca, are just a mark on
the ground), but the few surviving buildings give us an idea of how impres-
sive the forum must have been in its heyday. The Arch of Septimius
Severus, was built in A.D. 203 to commemorate this emperor’s victories,
and the nearby Curia is an imposing square building where the Senate
once met; many of the walls were heavily restored in 1937, but the marble-
inlay floor is original from the third century A.D. Also well preserved is the
Temple of Antoninus and Faustina (the Emperor Antoninus Pius, who suc-
ceeded Hadrian in A.D. 138), which was turned into a church and given a
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
148

baroque facade (Chiesa di San Lorenzo in Miranda). The other arch in
the forum is the Arch of Titus, commemorating the emperor who reigned
from A.D. 79 to 81. Nearby is the hulking form of the fourth-century Basilica
of Constantine and Maxentius, a Roman court of law. The forum became
too small for the growing imperial capital and was gradually expanded by
the various emperors (see Trajan’s Markets and Imperial Fori, later in
this chapter).
We recommend using an audio guide or signing up for a guided tour of
the forum. The English-speaking tour is at 1 p.m. daily and lasts about an
hour. You can make an advance reservation at the ticket booth.

St. Peter’s Basilica (Basilica di San Pietro)
San Pietro
In 324, Emperor Constantine commissioned a sanctuary to be built on the
site of St. Peter’s tomb (excavation and studies commissioned by the
Vatican under the Basilica found the stone under which the first apostle
was buried). The original basilica stood for about 1,000 years, but with its
accrued importance and stability, the papacy decided it was time for ren-
ovations. Construction began in 1503 following designs by the architects
Sangallo and Bramante. In 1547, Michelangelo was appointed to finish the
magnificent dome, but he died in 1564 before seeing the work completed.
His disciple Giacomo della Porta finished the job.

How to attend a papal audience
Papal audiences attract many visitors — Catholic and non-Catholic alike — who come
to see and hear the pope address the crowd gathered in front of him. Audiences are
held on Wednesdays, indoors during the winter (Oct–Mar) and outdoors in a gated
area in front of the basilica in summer (Apr–Sept). Entrance is allowed between 10
and 10:30 a.m., but lines form earlier by the gates, since you need to go through the
security checkpoint. Tickets are free, but you must reserve them as far in advance as
possible by writing or faxing your request (indicating the dates of your visit, the number
of people in your party, and if possible the hotel in Rome to which the office should
send your tickets the afternoon before the audience) to the Prefecture of the Papal
Household (00120 Città del Vaticano/Holy See; % 06-69884857; Fax: 06-69885863;
Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1 p.m.). You can also pick the ticket up yourself, the afternoon before
the audience at the Prefecture office, whose entrance is by the porta di bronzo (bronze
door) under St. Peter’s colonnade on the right-hand side (if you are facing the
entrance).

The inside of the basilica is almost too huge to take in (the best spot for
appreciating its bulk is the central square). On the right as you enter is
Michelangelo’s exquisite Pietà, created when the master was in his early
20s. (Because of an act of vandalism in the 1970s, the statue is kept behind
reinforced glass.) Dominating the central nave is Bernini’s 29m-tall (96-ft.)
baldaquin; completed in 1633, it was criticized for being excessive and
because the bronze was supposedly taken from the Pantheon. The canopy
stands over the papal altar, which in turn is over the symbolic tomb of St.
Peter. A bronze statue of St. Peter (likely by Arnolfo di Cambio, 13th cen-
tury) marks the tomb; its right foot has been worn away by the millions of
pilgrims kissing it in devotion to the pope. By the apse, above an altar, is
the bronze throne sculpted by Bernini to house the remains of what is,
according to legend, the chair of St. Peter.
At the right-hand side of the basilica’s entrance, under the loggia, you see
two lines: the one on the right is for Michelangelo’s dome, and the one on
the left is for the Vatican Grottoes.
You can visit the dome and marvel at the astounding view. An elevator will
save you the first 171 steps of the climb, but you have to book it when you
buy your ticket to access the dome, and pay an additional 3€ ($4.80).
Expect a line to get the lift. You won’t get the full effect of the breathtaking
view unless you climb the additional 420 steps or so. Make sure you’re
ready and willing to climb, because after you’ve started up, you’re not
allowed to turn around and go back down.
The grottoes beneath the basilica extend under the central nave of the
church, and the main halls contain the paleo-Christian tombs and archi-
tectural fragments of the original basilica.
Plan on at least two hours to see the entire basilica.
The best time to avoid the lines is before 9 a.m. After that, the growing
throngs of visitors make for lengthy waits at the security checkpoint.
At the Vatican, bare shoulders, halter tops, tank tops, shorts, and skirts
above the knee will definitely result in your being turned away from the
basilica, whether you are man or woman.

Trajan’s Markets and Imperial Fori (Mercati Traianei e Fori
Imperiali)
Colosseo
Julius Caesar was the first to respond to the need for larger public spaces
in the Roman capital, creating the first of the Imperial Fori between 54 and
46 B.C. As the city continued to grow, emperors Augustus (in 2 B.C.),
Vespasian (A.D. 75), Nerva (A.D. 97), and Trajan (A.D. 113) followed his exam-
ple, and four more fori were added. Each was a large open space sur-
rounded by an imposing portico with a temple on one end, and each bears
the name of the emperor who built it. Trajan built the most splendid of
them all: They include an elegant open space — Trajan’s Forum — over-
looked by a tall curved building — Trajan’s Markets, sort of an ancient
mall with small shops and food stalls. The Imperial Fori were raided for
their marble and decorative elements in the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance (when the marble was used for other construction), and then
were largely covered by Via dei Fori Imperiali (the major roadway built in
1920 to connect Piazza Venezia to the Colosseum). In 2004, ground was
broken on the largest archaeological excavations to date in Rome. Its find-
ings are exhibited inside the Trajan Markets. Consider about one hour for
your visit.
See map p. 138. Via 4 Novembre 94. % 06-0608. www.mercatiditraiano.it.
Admission: 6.50€ ($10). Audio guide: 3.50€ ($5.60). Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7 p.m. Dec

Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi)
Trevi
Fronting its own little piazza, this massive fountain existed for centuries
in relative obscurity before it became one of the must-see sights of Rome,
thanks to the film Three Coins in the Fountain. Today, it seems that many
of the thousands who clog the space in front of it don’t take the time to
really look at it — instead, they throw coins in it, have their pictures taken
in front of it, and go on their way. If you want a tranquil moment to actu-
ally appreciate the artwork, you must visit late at night or early in the
morning. The fountain was begun by Bernini and Pietro da Cortona, but
there was a 100-year lapse in the work, which wasn’t completed until 1751
by Nicola Salvi. The central figure is Neptune, who guides a chariot pulled
by plunging sea horses. Tritons (mythological sea dwellers) guide the
horses, and the surrounding scene is one of wild nature and bare stone.
Of course, you have to toss a coin in the Trevi fountain, something all
kids love to do. To do it properly (Romans are superstitious), hold the
coin in your right hand, turn your back to the fountain, and toss the coin
over your left shoulder. According to tradition, the spirit of the fountain
will then see to it that you return to Rome one day.
See map p. 138. Piazza di Trevi. Bus: 62 or Minibus 116 or 119. Take Via Poli to the
fountain.

Vatican Gardens (Giardini Vaticani)
See Vatican Museums
Vatican Museums (Musei Vaticani)
San Pietro
This enormous complex of museums could swallow up your entire vaca-
tion, with its tons of Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, Roman, paleo-Christian,
and Renaissance art. Four museums house the art: the Gregorian
Egyptian Museum, a fantastic collection of Egyptian artifacts; the
Gregorian Etruscan Museum, a beautiful collection of Etruscan art and
jewelry; the Ethnological Missionary Museum, a large collection of arti-
facts from every continent, including superb African, Asian, and Australian
art; and the Pinacoteca (Picture Gallery), the most famous of the Vatican
Museums, which contains works by medieval and Renaissance masters.
In Room 9 of the Pinacoteca is Leonardo da Vinci’s St. Jerome, which has
been pieced back together — one piece had ended up as a stool seat in a
shoemaker’s shop; the other, as a tabletop in an antiques shop. In Room 2
is Giotto’s luminous Stefaneschi Triptych; in Room 8, Raphael’s
Transfiguration. Other highlights include works by Beato Angelico,
Perugino, Bernini, and Caravaggio (a single but great painting, the
Deposition from the Cross).
The Stanze di Raffaello, which were the private apartments of Pope Julius
II, were frescoed by the artist. The largest of the four rooms is that of
Constantine, painted between 1517 and 1524 to illustrate key moments in
the life of the first Christian emperor, including his triumph over Maxentius
and his vision of the cross. The Appartamento Borgia (Borgia
Apartments) was designed for Pope Alexander VI (the infamous Borgia
pope), and the Cappella di Nicola V (Chapel of Nicholas V) features floor-
to-ceiling frescoes by Fra Angelico.
But of course, it is the Sistine Chapel (Cappella Sistina), Michelangelo’s
masterpiece, that is the crowning glory of the museums. Accessible only
from the labyrinthine museums, the chapel is smaller than one would
expect, but the ceilings are completely covered with Michelangelo’s
grandiose frescoes. Years after their restoration (a 20-year affair that
started in 1979 and ended in 1999), conflict continues over whether too
much paint was removed, flattening the figures. On the other hand, the
brilliant color has been restored. Whether you like the colors of the drap-
ery or not, Michelangelo’s modeling of the human form is incredible. The
Creation of Adam and the temptation and fall of Adam and Eve are the
most famous scenes. Michelangelo also painted a terrifying and powerful
Last Judgment on the end wall. The ceilings’ frescoes completely dwarf
the frescoes on the other walls, yet they are by famous 15th-century
Tuscan and Umbrian artists: Botticelli, Perugino, Ghirlandaio, and
Pinturicchio, among others.
The light is at its best in the morning. Binoculars or even a hand mirror
will help you appreciate the Sistine ceiling better; your neck tires long
before you can take it all in. Just think how poor Michelangelo must
have felt while painting it flat on his back atop a tower of scaffolding!

Visiting all of the museums in one day is impossible, but four color-
coded itineraries (A, B, C, or D), help you hit the highlights of the muse-
ums: They range from one-and-a-half to five hours, and all end at the
Sistine Chapel. Audio guides are essential.
Taking a guided tour is even better, and it is the only way to avoid the
huge lines to enter the museums (people sometimes queue up hours
before opening time). The two-hour tour (Mar–Oct 10:30 a.m., 12 p.m.,
and 2 p.m.; Nov–Feb 10:30 a.m. only) includes the museums, Raphael’s
Rooms, and the Sistine Chapel. You must book by fax between one
month and one week in advance. You can also reserve a two-hour tour of
the splendid Vatican Gardens with groomed grounds, fountains, and ele-
gant Renaissance buildings (Mar–Oct Tues, Thurs, and Sat 11 a.m.;
Nov–Feb Sat 11 a.m.).
The museums charge no admission on the last Sunday of each month,
but the crowds are unbelievable, especially in high season.
Proper attire is required to access the museums and chapel; see note at
the end of the St. Peter’s Basilica listing.

Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
Once you cover all of Rome’s musts — and there are plenty — you have
still only scratched the surface of all the city has to offer. Below are a
few more of our favorite attractions, pick up a copy of our book, Rome
For Dummies, for a more complete list.
 Behind Caracalla Baths (see earlier in this chapter) is the start of the
Via Appia Antica(% 06-5130682; www.parcoappiaantica.org;
Bus: Archeobus, 118, 218, or 360). Now a public park, this is a section
of the original ancient Roman road — the Regina Viarum (Queen of
Roads) — built in 312 B.C. as the highway between Rome and Capua.
The road was progressively extended to reach Benevento (233km/
146 miles to the southeast), then Taranto (an extra 281km/176 miles),
and finally all the way to Brindisi (another 70km/40 miles). It was on
this road that St. Peter, in flight from Rome, had his vision of Jesus
and turned back toward his martyrdom. The street is still paved 
with the original large, flat basalt stones and lined with the remains
of villas, tombs, and monuments against the background of the 
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 153

beautiful countryside. Besides the Catacombs of San Callisto (see
earlier in this chapter), we think the most interesting attractions are
the Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella (Via Appia Antica 161) and the
impressive Villa dei Quintili (Via Appia Nuova 1092). All archaeologi-
cal sites (% 06-39967700; Admission: 6€/$7.20; includes admission
to Caracalla Baths, Villa dei Quintili, and Mausoleum of Cecilia
Metella) are open Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to one hour
before sunset. The best way to visit this park’s attractions is via the
hop-on/hop-off Archeobus (see “Seeing Rome by Guided Tour,” later
in this chapter) or by renting bicycles at the park visitor center,
Cartiera Latina (Via Appia Antica 42), or at the Bar Caffè dell’Appia
Antica (Via Appia Antica 175). Bikes rent for 3€ ($4.80) per hour or
10€ ($16) for the whole day.
 Surrounding the Galleria Borghese (see earlier in this chapter), you
find Villa Borghese, one of Rome’s most beautiful parks. Raphael’s
Pavilion (Casino di Raffaello) is a children’s museum with play-
rooms (free admission) and children’s activities (ages 3–10; 
% 06-82059127; www.casinadiraffaello.it; Open: Tues–Sun 9
a.m.–7 p.m.; 3€/$4.80; by reservation only at the number below),
and you can rent rowboats on the lake. The Piazza di Siena is a pic-
turesque oval track surrounded by tall pines, used for horse races
and for Rome’s international horse-jumping event, the Concorso
Ippico Internazionale di Roma, in May (see Chapter 3). The south-
ern stretch of the park connects to the famous Pincio Gardens,
with its panoramic terrace overlooking Piazza del Popolo and
affording one of the best views of the city, particularly at sunset.
Playgrounds and merry-go-rounds are located in both gardens, and
bike rental is available (Via dell’Uccelliera, near the Borghese
Gallery; Piazzale M.Cervantes, near the Zoo; Viale J.W.Goethe, off
Viale del Museo Borghese, leading to the Borghese Gallery; and
Pincio Gardens). To the northwest of the park is Rome’s Zoo,
Bioparco (Piazzale del Giardino Zoologico 1; % 06-3608211;
www.bioparco.it; Admission: 8.50€/$14 adults, 6.50€/$10 chil-
dren under 13, 2.50€ ($4) additional for Reptilarium; Open: Oct–
Mar daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m., last
admission one hour earlier).
 A wonderful way to experience Rome is by sailing down the Tiber on
a boat tour. Compagnia di Navigazione Ponte San Angelo operates
boat service between Ponte Duca d’Aosta (the right bank) and Isola
Tiberina (Calata Anguillara on the right bank), with intermediary
stops at Ponte Sant’Angelo and Ponte Cavour (by Piazza Augusto
Imperatore). Don’t worry if you arrive at a deserted and locked dock;
the only manned one is Ponte Sant’Angelo, where you find the main
reservation office (Ponte Sant’Angelo, across Castel Sant’Angelo,
dock is on the left bank of the Tiber; % 06-6789361 for info and
reservations; www.battellidiroma.it; Fare: Single trip Mon–4 p.m.
Fri 1€/$1.60 and Fri 4 p.m.–Sun 3€/$4.80). All the other docks are
opened by the boat crew when they arrive. Schedules are posted on
a board outside and are available online.
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
154

 Opening onto a piazza graced by an early baroque fountain, Santa
Maria in Trastevere (Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere; % 06-
5814802; Bus: 23; Tram: 8; Admission: Free; Open: Daily 8 a.m.–8
p.m.) is believed to be the first Roman church to be officially
opened to the public in the third century A.D. Do not miss the beau-
tifully preserved original mosaics decorating the apse and the
facade. Over the main altar is another famous work: the Madonna
della Clemenza, a unique painting from the sixth century.
 The Doria Pamphili family still live in their 18th-century Roman
palazzo, but you’re welcome to visit their picture gallery and his-
toric apartments. A bit worn and dusty, the Galleria Doria
Pamphili nonetheless houses some superb artwork (Piazza del
Collegio Romano 1/A; % 06-6797323; www.doriapamphilj.it;
Bus: 62, 116, 117, or 119; Admission: 8€/$13, 12€/$19 with concert;
Open: Fri–Wed 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Closed Jan 1, Easter Sunday, May 1,
Aug 15, and Dec 25). Our favorite painting is Velázquez’s portrait of
Pope Innocent X, but you find works by Filippo Lippi, Raphael,
Caravaggio, and Tiziano. The gallery is also open on some evenings
for classical concerts.
 The church of Santa Maria Maggiore (Piazza di Santa Maria
Maggiore; % 06-483195; Metro: Termini; Bus: 70; Admission: Free;
Open: Daily 7 a.m.–6:45 p.m.) is one of Rome’s four great basilicas.
Started in the fourth century A.D., it was later given a baroque
facade. Inside are the original Byzantine mosaics (apse and side
walls), the 12th-century Cosmatesque-style floors (marble and col-
ored stone mosaic), and the 15th-century coffered wooden ceiling,
richly decorated with gold (said to be the first gold brought back
from the New World and donated by the Spanish queen). To the
right of the altar is the tomb of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Italy’s most
important baroque sculptor/architect.
 The ruins of Ostia Antica (Viale dei Romagnoli 717, off Via
Ostiense; % 06-56358099; www.itnw.roma.it/ostia/scavi;
Admission: 6.50€/$10; Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m. to sunset, last
admission one hour earlier; Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25),
ancient Rome’s seaport and shipyard, are smaller than Pompeii but
still quite impressive. Only a few metro stops away from the center
of Rome, you walk on Roman roads and see the theater (where
shows are held in summer; see “Living It Up After Dark,” later in
this chapter), temples, and homes. We recommend signing up for
an official guided tour of the archaeological area at %/Fax
06-56352830 or bookshopostia@yahoo.it. You can reach the site
by subway or by boat (see later in this chapter for boat tours on
the Tiber).
 One of our favorite attractions near Rome are the villas of Tivoli, a
small town about 40 minutes away by train (frequent departures
from Tiburtina rail station). You can also book a guided tour with
Argiletum Tour Operator (Via Madonna dei Monti 49, off Via
Cavour; % 06-47825706; www.argiletumtour.com). Hadrian’s
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 155

Villa (Via di Villa Adriana, 5km/31⁄2 miles from the center of Tivoli;
% 0774-530203; Bus: 4 or 4X from Largo Garibaldi, Tivoli’s main
square; Admission: 6.50€/$10; Open: Daily 9 a.m.–sunset; ticket
booth closes 90 minutes earlier), may be the most beautiful ancient
Roman villa that ever was, while Villa d’Este (Piazza Trento, west of
Largo Garibaldi, Tivoli’s main square; % 199-766166 within Italy
and 0424-600460 from abroad; www.villadestetivoli.info;
Admission: 6.50€/$10; Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m. to one hour before
sunset; ticket booth closes one hour earlier) is a Renaissance
delight with a unique garden full of fountains that are an engineer-
ing marvel. Both are closed January 1, May 1, and December 25.
You can dine very well in town at Albergo Ristorante Adriano
(Via di Villa Adriana 194, near the ticket booth to Villa Adriana; 
% 0774-382235; www.hoteladriano.it; Open: Daily noon to 3
p.m. and 7–10:30 p.m.), which also offers rooms.
Seeing Rome by Guided Tour
The French writer Stendhal once wrote, “As soon as you enter Rome, get
in a carriage and ask to be brought to the Coliseum [sic] or to St. Peter’s.
If you try to get there on foot, you will never arrive: Too many marvelous
things will stop you along the way.”
Once you arrive in Rome, taking an introductory bus tour of this compli-
cated city is still an excellent idea. Doing so will help you get a general
feel for the place and give you an idea of what you’d like to see in depth.
Bus tours
We like the hop-on/hop-off formula, and ATAC (% 06-46952252 daily 8
a.m.–8 p.m. for reservations and info; www.trambus.com/servizi
turistici.htm) offers the best. Tickets can be purchased online, or
onboard with exact change. You can chose from four lines, each cover-
ing a two-hour itinerary:
 Line 110’s red tourist buses leave from Piazza dei Cinquecento in
front of Stazione Termini every ten minutes from 8:40 a.m. to 7:40
p.m. for their 11-stop loop around Rome’s major historic sights
(16€/$26 adult; 7€/$11 child under 13; children under 6 ride free).
 The Archeobus tour traverses Rome’s historical center and heads
for the Appian Way Archeological Park, making 15 stops at ancient
Roman sites. The green buses leave from Piazza dei Cinquecento
across from Stazione Termini every 40 minutes between 9 a.m. and
4 p.m. (10€/$16, 8€/$13 for those with Roma Pass, see beginning of
this chapter).
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
156

 The two Roma Cristiana tours encompass all the major religious
sites in Rome. Both loops start from Via della Conciliazione across
from St. Peter’s. The yellow buses leave every 25 minutes for the 
St. Peter’s loop, and every 50 minutes for the St. Paul’s Basilica
loop, between 8:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. (15€/$24 for one day and 
one line, and 20€/$32 for two days and two lines).
If you prefer a more traditional bus tour, we suggest Vastours
(Via Piemonte 34; % 06-4814309; www.vastours.it).
Walking tours
Enjoy Rome (Via Varese 39, 3 blocks north off the side of Stazione
Termini; % 06-4451843; www.enjoyrome.com; Metro: Termini) offers a
variety of three-hour walking tours, including a night tour that takes you
through the historic center, plus a tour of Trastevere and the Jewish
Ghetto. Most tours cost 26€ ($42) adults and 20€ ($32) for those under
26, including the cost of the tour and admission to sites. The office is
open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 3:30 to 6:30
p.m., and Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., but you can book your tour
directly on their Web site. Enjoy Rome also organizes a bike tour with
English-speaking guides.
Segway
If you are in relatively good shape and weigh between 99 and 248
pounds, you ought to try the Segway: a two-wheel battery-powered vehi-
cle. If you can figure out how to use the contraption (a 30-minute train-
ing is offered before the tour), it is a lot of fun. Italy Segway Tours
(% 055-291958; www.segwayfirenze.com) offers daily three-hour tours
at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in English for 90€ ($144); you can reserve online up
to two days in advance, or by phone up to a few hours before a tour (but
they might be sold out for the day).
Boat tours
Besides its regular boat service on the Tiber (see “Finding More Cool
Things to See and Do,” earlier in this chapter), the Compagnia di
Navigazione Ponte San Angelo (% 06-6789361; info@battellidi
roma.it) offers a number of day cruises on the river. The one-hour tour
with audio guide costs 12€ ($19), and leaves from Ponte Sant’Angelo
(Wed–Sun 11 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 4 p.m., and 5:30 p.m.).
Our personal favorite is their cruise to the Tiber mouth, which includes
a two-hour stop at Ostia Antica to visit the archaeological area. Boats
leave from the Marconi bridge (Fri–Sun 10 a.m.) and arrive at Ostia at 
12 p.m. They depart from Ostia at 2 p.m. for a scheduled arrival back in
Rome at 4:30 p.m., but you can take a faster subway ride back if you
wish to spend more time at the ruins. Tickets cost 12€ ($19) for a 
one-way and 13€ ($21) for a return.
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 157

Suggested One-, Two-, and Three-Day Itineraries
So much to see, so little time. In the following three itineraries, we make
recommendations on how best to spend your time in Rome.
Rome in one day
It’s a tall order to try to see the Eternal City in what amounts to the blink
of an eye. But if you don’t have more time, then here it is: Head to the
Termini train station early in the morning and take the 110 Open Stop &
Go bus tour. Get off at the Colosseum for a visit; then walk through the
Roman Forum. Hop on the bus again and get off at the stop near Piazza
Navona to visit this famous square. Afterward, stroll to the nearby
Pantheon and have lunch at Maccheroni. Enjoy some shopping in the
area before getting back on your bus. Head to St. Peter’s Basilica, where
you get off to visit the church. After your visit, climb back on the bus
and continue to the stop near Fontana di Trevi for a visit to the world’s
most famous fountain. Then head toward Piazza di Spagna and the
Spanish Steps, enjoying a bit of shopping on your way. Have a special
dinner at La Pergola (see Chapter 11).
Rome in two days
If you have two days in Rome, you can spend time absorbing the sights
rather than just seeing them and moving on. You also don’t have to
make as many painful choices.
Day 1
You can begin as in the “Rome in one day” itinerary, above, but spend
more time visiting the archaeological area, including the Colosseum,
Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill. Have lunch at Pizza Forum (see
Chapter 11). In the afternoon, head for Galleria Borghese, where you
have made reservations in advance. After your visit, stroll down through
the Pincio Gardens overlooking Piazza del Popolo, if possible at sunset.
Have your aperitivo here at La Casina Valadier.
Day 2
Get up early and head for the Vatican Museums to see the Sistine
Chapel, and continue your visit with St. Peter’s Basilica. You’ll then be
ready for a good lunch at Dante Taberna de’ Gracchi (see Chapter 11).
Take a peek at Piazza Navona and the Pantheon on your way to the
Spanish Steps and Piazza di Spagna. Stroll to the Trevi Fountain and
have your last dinner in Rome at La Pergola (see Chapter 11).
Rome in three days
Day 1
Head to Termini train station and take the 110 Open Stop & Go bus
tour: an excellent way to orient yourself in Rome as well as a means of
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
158

transportation between attractions. Stop at the Colosseum and spend
your morning imbibing in ancient Rome, visiting the Roman Forum and
Palatine Hill as well. After a nice lunch at Hostaria Nerone, get back on
your bus and finish the tour (it’s a loop) to scope out the rest of the city.
Get off at the stop near Piazza Navona to visit this famous square; then
stroll over to the Pantheon for a visit. Have dinner at Maccheroni or Il
Convivio Troiani, depending on your budget (see Chapter 11).
Day 2
Get up early and head for the Vatican Museums to see the Sistine
Chapel, and continue your visit with St. Peter’s Basilica. You’ll then be
ready for a good lunch at Dante Taberna de’ Gracchi (see Chapter 11).
In the afternoon, see Castel Sant’Angelo and cross the river Tiber over
Ponte Sant’Angelo. You can then walk north along the river and turn
right at Via del Clementino toward the Spanish Steps and Piazza di
Spagna. Head over to the Trevi Fountain and have dinner at Presidente.
Day 3
In the morning, explore the funky medieval neighborhood of Trastevere,
on the south side of the river Tiber, visiting the Villa Farnesina and
Santa Maria in Trastevere. In the afternoon, head for Galleria
Borghese, where you have made reservations in advance. After your
visit, stroll down through the Pincio Gardens overlooking Piazza del
Popolo, if possible at sunset. Have your aperitivo here at La Casina
Valadier, and then head to La Pergola for your last dinner in Rome.
Shopping the Local Stores
People say Rome isn’t as good for shopping as Milan (the fashion capital
of Italy). That may be true, but a vast array of goods are for sale in the
capital city, not to mention a selection of some items — antique prints,
for instance — that other Italian cities cannot match. Also, you can find
specialty items — such as Florentine embroidery and Venetian glass —
from places that you may not have time to visit.
Best shopping areas
The best shopping area in Rome is the triangle of medieval and
Renaissance streets running between Piazza del Popolo, Piazza Venezia,
and Piazza di Spagna. On the exclusive Via Frattina and Via dei
Condotti, you find the showrooms of all the big names of Italian fashion,
from Armani to Valentino. You also see a lot of small shops specializing
in everything from stylish Italian housewares to antiques. The area’s
main artery, Via del Corso — now restricted to pedestrians (except for
buses and taxis) — is lined with shops ranging from fashionable to tacky
and selling everything from clothing to shoes to CDs. La Rinascente
(Piazza Colonna; % 06-6784209) is an elegant department store carry-
ing mainly clothes and accessories; across the street is the Galleria
Alberto Sordi, a shopping gallery with many nice shops and two bars.
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 159

The maze of medieval streets on the west side of the Corso, around the
Pantheon and Piazza Navona, hides a great trove of elegant and original
boutiques, along with some of the oldest establishments in Rome. The
area contains a huge variety of goods, from old prints to exclusive fash-
ions, books to antique furniture. The foot traffic is often lighter here than
on the Corso, which usually looks like New York’s Fifth Avenue around
Christmastime. You find old craftsmen shops on Via degli Sediari and Via
Orsini; elegant men’s apparel at Davide Cenci (Via Campo Marzio 1–7;
% 06-6990681; Bus: Minibus 116 to Pantheon), which is popular with
locals; and, just a stone’s throw away, handsome clothes and shoes for
women and men at Tombolini (Via della Maddalena 31–38; % 06-
69200342), which emphasizes timelessly classic styling rather than 
chic. If you really want to make your friends green with envy, have a pair
of shoes custom-made by Listo (Via della Croce 76; % 06-6784567) or
stop by Rome’s most special source of intoxicants: Ai Monasteri (Corso
Rinascimento 72; % 06-68802783; Bus: Minibus 116), off the east side of
Piazza Navona, selling liqueurs, elixirs, and other alcoholic concoctions
that Italian monks have been making since the Middle Ages.
Another excellent shopping area is along Via Cola di Rienzo, in the Prati
neighborhood. This area is best for clothes and is also excellent for
shoes, with shops catering to every level of price and style. Stores line
both sides of Via Ottaviano and Via Cola di Rienzo.
For a dip into romantic medieval Rome and an interesting mix of artists’
workshops, crafts showrooms, and small shops selling anything from
mystic art to traditional food, head for Trastevere. Some of the shops
have been here for decades, while others are new ventures. Via della
Scala is the best, lined almost wall-to-wall with showrooms and work-
shops. One interesting shop is Pandora (Piazza Santa Maria in
Trastevere 6; % 06-5895658), which carries a great selection of Murano
glass and Italian designer goods; others are Modi e Materie (Vicolo del
Cinque; % 06-5885280), with ceramics from the island of Sardinia;
Ciliegia (Via della Scala 5; % 06-5818149), specializing in fashions from
Positano, from handmade sandals and dresses to curios; and
Guaytamelli (Via del Moro 59; % 06-5880704), which sells sundials and
other ancient time-measuring instruments.
What to look for and where to find it
Shopping hours are generally Monday through Saturday from 9 or 9:30
a.m. (later for boutiques) to about 1 or 1:30 p.m., and then from 3:30 or 
4 to 7:30 p.m.; most apparel boutiques are closed Monday mornings,
while food shops are closed Thursday afternoons. In the historic district,
however, many shops choose to stay open at lunchtime and on Sundays.
Antiques
Rome is famous for its number of reputable antiques shops, and some of
the best — and priciest — in town are on Via del Babuino and Via
Margutta; a bit cheaper, Via dei Coronari is literally lined with antiques
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
160

shops. The fun continues on the more elegant Via Giulia; for more
casual shopping, try Via del Pellegrino.
Artwork and prints
Many artists have etched views of the city’s ancient and baroque monu-
ments, and owning a nice print is an affordable pleasure. For high-quality
prints, two well-known shops are Nardecchia (Piazza Navona 25; % 06-
6869318; Bus: Minibus 116) and Alinari (Via Alibert 16/a; % 06-6792923;
Metro: Line A to Spagna). On the upscale Via del Babuino is Fava (Via del
Babuino 180; % 06-3610807; Metro: Line A to Spagna), specializing in
Neapolitan scenes. Antiquarius (Corso Rinascimento 63; % 06-68802941;
Bus: Minibus 116) is also worth a stop. If you’re not after museum-quality
prints, the nearby antiquarian book and print market, on Piazza
Fontanella Borghese (Bus: 81 or Minibus 117 or 119 to the Corso at Via
Tomacelli), is a great place to browse. If you know your stuff, you may find
some treasures — otherwise, caveat emptor (let the buyer beware), to use
a Roman (or at least Latin) phrase.
Books and magazines
Feltrinelli (Largo di Torre Argentina 11, off Corso Vittorio Emanuele; 
% 06-68663001) is one of many excellent bookstores in Rome, but for
books in English you should try English Bookstore (Via di Ripetta 248,
off Piazza del Popolo; % 06-3203301), and The Corner Bookshop
(Via del Moro 48; % 06-5836942), in Trastevere. The Libreria Babele
(Via dei Banchi Vecchi 116; % 06-6876628; Bus: Minibus 116 to Via dei
Banchi) is Rome’s most central gay/lesbian bookstore. The bookstores
above also carry magazines, but the larger newsstands also carry
English-language newspapers and magazines.
Clothing
Italian fashion is world famous. Around Piazza di Spagna, you find all the
established names, including Fendi (Via Borgognona 39; % 06-696661),
Valentino (Via dei Condotti 13; % 06-6739420), Gucci (Via Condotti 8;
% 06-6793888), Armani (Via dei Condotti 77; % 06-6991460), and
Emporio Armani (Via del Babuino 140; % 06-36002197), as well as
Battistoni (Via dei Condotti 61/a; % 06-697611) and Testa (Via Frattina
104; % 06-6791294) — both men’s clothing specialists. For some emerg-
ing dressmakers, try Scala Magica (Via della Scala 66; % 06-5894098)
and Scala 14 (Via della Scala 14; % 06-5883580), in Trastevere.
Crafts
Rome has an old tradition of crafts ranging from vimini (basketry) to iron-
work, plasterwork to mosaics (including reproductions of Roman and
Pompeian mosaics), pottery to jewelry and embroidery. For beautiful
ceramic work, try Ceramica Sarti (Via Santa Dorotea 21; % 06-5882079)
or the Compagnia del Corallo (Via del Corallo 27; % 06-6833697). For
plasterwork, including reproductions of antique designs (some objects are
small enough to take home; others can be shipped), visit the Laboratorio
Marani (Via Monte Giordano 27; % 06-68307866). For handmade lace, go
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 161

to Ricami Italia Garipoli (Borgo Vittorio 91; % 06-68802196). You find
woodcarving at Laboratorio Ilaria Miani (Via degli Orti di Alibert 13/A; 
% 06-6861366). Handmade stringed instruments are featured at
Mohesen (Vicolo del Cedro 33; % 06-5882484).
Jewelry
Rome has an old tradition of handmade, high-quality jewelry and gold-
smith work, which has been rediscovered in recent times. For some
excellent jewelry, check out the Bottega Mortet (Via dei Portoghesi 18;
% 06-6861629), Elisabeth Frolet (Via della Pelliccia 30; % 06-5816614),
or Carini (Piazza dell’Unitá 9; % 06-3210715), as well as the goldsmiths
Massimo Langosco di Langosco (Via della Scala 77; % 06-5896375) and
Ferrone (Via della Scala 76; % 06-5803801).
Leather clothing and accessories
Although Florence is more the place for leather clothing, you can find
some nice stores on Rome’s Via Nazionale. For leather accessories, the
two best areas are Via dei Condotti (near Piazza di Spagna) and Via
Cola di Rienzo (in the Vatican area). If money isn’t an issue, check out
the leather bags and wallets at Bottega Veneta (Piazza San Lorenzo in
Lucina 9; % 06-68210024; Bus: 81 or Minibus 116 to Piazza San
Lorenzo), famous for its beautiful woven leather designs, often in rich
and startling colors; and Prada (Via dei Condotti 88–90; % 06-6790897;
Metro: Line A to Spagna), another famous store.
Religious art and crafts
The tradition of religious objects and attire goes back to the Middle
Ages; naturally, many shops specializing in such fare are located in the
Vatican area. Although you probably don’t want to buy a cardinal’s
outfit, you may want to browse the huge selection of figurines, bronzes,
candleholders, paintings, crèches, and other religious objects, some 
of high artistic quality. Two good stores are Ghezzi (Via de’ Cestari 32;
% 06-6869744) and Salustri (Via de’ Cestari 11; % 06-6791587), near
Piazza Navona. Savelli, near the Vatican, has two locations: one special-
izing in mosaics at Via Paolo VI 27 (% 06-68307437), another right off
Piazza San Pietro with a huge variety of other objects (Piazza Pio XII; 
% 06-68806383).
Shoes
Among the top names are Dominici (Via del Corso 14; % 06-3610591),
Ferragamo (Via dei Condotti 73–74; % 06-6798402), and Ferragamo
Uomo (Via dei Condotti 75; % 06-6781130). You can get custom-made
shoes at Listo (Via della Croce 76; % 06-678-4567).
Stationery
Paper in various forms — colored, marbled, deckle-edged — is an Italian
specialty and can be found all over Rome. This is one of the most popu-
lar, portable, and affordable gifts for the folks back home. For especially
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
162

refined stationery, go to Pineider, founded in 1774, with one location at
Via Fontanella Borghese 22 (% 06-6878369; Bus: Minibus 117 or 119 
to the Corso at Via Tomacelli) and another at Via dei Due Macelli 68 
(% 06-6795884; Bus: Minibus 116, 117, or 119 to Via Due Macelli).
Officina della Carta (Via Benedetta 26; % 06-5895557) also sells paper
and leather goods in the best Italian tradition.
Living It Up After Dark
You find a very lively cultural life in Rome: Italy’s capital and a major art
city with a long cultural tradition and international visibility, it attracts
all kinds of world-famous artists and performers.
Time Out Rome is an excellent source for learning about events in the city,
and is for sale at newsstands. The Happening City is an excellent monthly
review published by Rome’s tourist board; you can sign up for it online at
www.romaturismo.it (click on “newsletter”) and receive the latest copy
by e-mail before you leave — a smart thing to do if you want to order 
tickets in advance for any show. The best Italian agency is TicketOne
(% 02-392261 for an English-speaking operator; www.ticketone.it). A
good U.S.-based resource is Culturalitaly.com (% 800-380-0014; Fax:
928-639-0388; www.culturalitaly.com).
The performing arts
Rome offers splendid concerts, theater, dance, ballet, and opera
throughout the year. Expect to pay 10€ to 120€ ($16–$192) depending
on the venue, performer, and location of your seat. Free or inexpensive
concerts are often available. Here are the top venues; for others, just
check with the tourist office.
 Parco della Musica (Viale Coubertin 34; % 06-8082058;
www.auditorium.com; Bus: M from Piazza del Popolo), with three
concert halls and a 3,000-seat outdoor concert space, La Cavea,
reminiscent of a classical amphitheater. In addition to classical,
pop, and contemporary music, you can see theater and dance per-
formances here as well. Restaurants, stores, lecture halls, and a
host of other activities and services are located on-site.
 Teatro dell’Opera (Piazza Beniamino Gigli 1, off Via Nazionale; % 06-
48160255; www.opera.roma.it; Metro: Line A to Repubblica; Bus:
Minibus 116 to Via A. Depretis), a beautiful venue built at the end of
the 19th century, hosts opera as well as ballet and classical concerts.
 Teatro Olimpico (Piazza Gentile da Fabriano; % 06-3265991;
www.teatroolimpico.it; Tram: 225 from Piazzale Flaminio),
another great space, hosts musical performances of all kinds.
Keep in mind that the curtain is usually right on time, and if you miss
yours, you usually have to wait until intermission to get to your seat. It’s
also customary to give a small tip to your usher.

All that jazz
Romans love jazz, and the city is home to many first-rate jazz venues fea-
turing excellent local musicians as well as all the big names of the inter-
national scene. Most clubs are in Trastevere and in Prati. They open
their doors around 9 p.m. and close around 3 a.m. Cover charges vary
depending on the event and the club, but usually range from 7€ ($11)
for a regular night all the way up to 30€ ($48) for special concerts.
Reservations are recommended at all the top venues.
The most famous jazz clubs are the Alexanderplatz (Via Ostia 9, just off
the Musei Vaticani; % 06-39742171; www.alexanderplatz.it; Metro:
Line A to Ottaviano/San Pietro; Bus: 23 to Via Leone IV); Big Mama
(Vicolo San Francesco a Ripa 18 in Trastevere; % 06-5812551; www.big
mama.it; Metro: Piramide; Tram: 8); and the Fonclea (Via Crescenzio
82/a, behind Castel Sant’Angelo; % 06-6896302; www.fonclea.it; Bus:
23 to Via Crescenzio), which also has some excellent ethnic and other
concerts. Gregory’s (Via Gregoriana 54; % 06-6796386; www.gregorys
jazzclub.com; Closed Mon) is a small club with a big heart, whereas
Classico Village (Via Libetta 3, off Via Ostiense at Piazza Parco San
Paolo; % 0657288857; www.classico.it; Closed Sun) is a cavernous
space inside an ex-factory with a pleasant outdoor area.
In addition to jazz and contemporary music, traditional Italian songs are
performed at Arciliuto (Piazza Montevecchio 5; % 06-6879419;
www.arciliuto.it; Bus: 62 or 64 to Corso Vittorio Emanuele; Closed
Sun and Aug), a theater where you can have dinner during the show —
one of the most romantic venues in Rome, in the maze of streets behind
Piazza Navona.
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
164
The Estate Romana Festival
From June through September — during the off season of many venues in Rome —
Roman nights come alive with a series of musical, theatrical, and other cultural events.
These often take place in the most picturesque locations and monuments, lit up espe-
cially for the event, which transforms the show into a multidimensional treat; venues
range from the Colosseum to the Theater of Caracalla Baths (Viale delle Terme di
Caracalla 52; % 06-48160255 for information), where the Teatro dell’Opera holds some
of its summer season. Other unique venues are the Roman Forum (Via dei Fori Imperiali;
% 06-70393427); Villa Borghese (Largo Aqua Felix, entrance at Piazzale delle Ginestre;
% 06-82077304; Mon–Thurs 9 a.m.–4 p.m. and Fri 9 a.m.–1 p.m.); the elegant Chiostro
del Bramante (Via della Pace; % 06-7807695); the Archeological Park of Teatro
Marcello (Via del Teatro Marcello; % 06-87131590); Castel Sant’Angelo (Lungotevere
Castello 50; % 06-32869 or 06-32861); and, outside Rome, the Teatro Romano of Ostia
Antica (Viale dei Romagnoli 717, Ostia Antica; % 06-56352850). You can find details on
the festival at www.estateromana.comune.roma.it or % 06-0608.

Historic cafes
The cheapest and most popular nighttime activity in Rome is the passeg-
giata: a stroll through the historic center, enjoying the magical tableau
created by the illuminated monuments and piazze by night, perhaps
sampling a tasty gelato (see the sidebar in Chapter 11), or sitting out-
doors at a famous cafe to people-watch. Some of Rome’s famous caffè
haven’t lost their glamour since first opening in the 18th century: The
Antico Caffè della Pace (Via della Pace 3–7; % 06-6861216; Bus:
Minibus 116 to Piazza Navona) is one of the most popular, with cus-
tomers lingering at outdoor tables on a romantic little square until late
in the night; the beautifully furnished Caffè Greco (Via Condotti 84; 
% 06-6791700; Metro: Line A to Spagna) counts among its past cus-
tomers famous writers like Stendhal, Goethe, and Keats; Caffè Rosati
(Piazza del Popolo 4–5; % 06-3225859; Bus: Minibus 117 or 119) retains
its 1920s Art Nouveau décor and is popular with younger crowds.
Bars (see Chapter 2 for more about bars in Italy) are the modern coun-
terparts to historic caffè; they open early in the morning — some as
early as 6 a.m. and most by 8 a.m. — and close late (8 p.m. at the earliest
and many as late as 2 or 3 a.m.). Many of those in the historic district are
popular for aperitivo before dinner, or an after-dinner drink. Harry’s Bar
(Via Vittorio Veneto 150; % 06-484643; www.harrysbar.it; Closed Sun)
is an historic address of Rome’s dolce vita, as is La Casina Valadier
(Piazza Bucarest off the Pincio Gardens; % 06-69922090; Bus: 116 to
Piazza del Popolo; Closed Mon), which affords romantic views over
Rome from its terraces.
Wine bars and pubs
We love joining the locals at one of Rome’s many fine enoteche. These
wine bars are a very popular hangout for the young and not-so-young;
some of them operate as regular wine shops during the day, but at night
they offer excellent wines and a menu that ranges from simple munches
to elaborate meals. The granddaddy of Roman wine stores, Trimani (Via
Goito 20; % 06-4469661; www.trimani.com; Bus: 60 or 62; Closed Sun
and Aug), has been run by the same family since 1821. Its happening
wine bar is set in the old residential neighborhood behind the Terme di
Diocleziano. Across town, the exceedingly popular but old-fashioned
wine bar called Vineria (Campo de’ Fiori 15; % 06-68803268) still holds
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 165
Dressing the part
Italians dress up to go out, more than we are used to in the United States. The opera,
classical concerts, and ballet always call for elegant dress, as do the most famous the-
aters and some of the upscale clubs and jazz clubs. Less dressy — but never casual —
attire is okay for other venues and shows (see Chapter 2 for more on local dress codes).

its own amid the nightly crowds swarming this trendy piazza, popular with
all age groups. For something calmer, try the intimate wine bar at Gusto
(see Chapter 11). The best in Rome — if price is not a problem — is the
Enoteca Capranica (Piazza Capranica 99; % 06-69940992), a historic
winery that has a wonderful cellar (with literally hundreds of Italian and
foreign labels) and delicious creative Italian cuisine (considered among the
best in Rome). Ferrara (Piazza Trilussa 41, at Ponte Sisto; % 06-58333920;
www.enotecaferrara.it) is another upscale address. Trendy but more
casual are Vino Garage (Via di Monte Giordano 3; % 06-68300858; Closed
Aug and Sun in July) and La Repubblica del Vino (Via Latina 134; % 06-
78358734; www.repubblicadelvino.it; Closed Sun). The wine bar is
only an aside at the ultramodern restaurant–cabaret–theater Centrale
RistoTheatre (Via Celsa 6, off Piazza del Gesù; % 06-6780501; www.
centraleristotheatre.com).
For something less Italian, head to Drunken Ship (Campo de’ Fiori 20;
% 06-68300535), an American-style bar with a DJ, often jammed with
people; The Albert (Via del Traforo 132, off Via del Tritone, before the
tunnel; % 06-4818795), a real English pub imported from the old coun-
try; or one of the many Irish pubs around. Of the latter, we think the
nicest ones are Mad Jack (Via Arenula 20, off Largo Argentina; % 06-
68808223), with live music on Wednesday and Thursday; and Abbey
Theatre Irish Pub (Via del Governo Vecchio 51–53, near Piazza Navona;
% 06-6861341).
Dance clubs
Romans, especially the younger set, love dancing, and clubs abound.
Cover charges hover between 10€ and 20€ ($16–$32) for the hippest
venues. They usually open around 10:30 p.m. and close around 4 a.m.
Alpheus (Via del Commercio 36, near Via Ostiense; % 06-5747826; Bus:
23, but best to take a cab) has several halls offering different kinds of
music, from jazz to Latin to straight-ahead rock. The most popular dance
club is Goa (Via Libetta 13; % 06-5748277) in an old industrial building.
Alien (Via Velletri 13–19; % 06-8412212; www.aliendisco.it; Bus: 490
to Piazza Fiume) is Rome’s clubbiest club — with mirrors, strobe lights,
and a New York–style atmosphere appealing to a frenetic 20-something
crowd. Not to be outdone is Gilda (Via Mario de Fiori 97; % 06-6797396;
www.gildadiscoclub.it; Metro: Line A to Spagna), which caters to an
older crowd and plays classic rock as well as some newer stuff. A trendy
new venue where you have to dress to impress is La Maison (Vicolo dei
Granari 3; % 06-6833312; www.lamaisonroma.it; Closed Mon and July
to mid-Sept).
Gay and lesbian bars
Rome has a lively gay scene with gay clubs scattered around the city
(although the area between San Giovanni and the Colosseo has been
developing as a small gay enclave). They observe the same hours as
other clubs and discos in town. The cover usually runs about 10€ ($16).
Trends change quickly, but at press time Qube (Via di Portonaccio 212;
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
166

% 06-4385445; Open: Thurs–Sat; Closed June–Sept) was very hot, and
L’Alibi (Via di Monte Testaccio 40–44; % 06-5743448; www.alibi
online.it; Bus: 23; Tram: 3, though taking a cab is best) is still going
strong, together with Hangar (Via in Selci 69a; % 06-4881397;
www.hangaronline.it; Closed Tues and two weeks in Aug), Rome’s
oldest gay bar. Many mainstream discos and clubs have a gay night,
such as Wednesdays at Goa (see earlier in this chapter). During the
summer, Gay Village (% 340-5423008; www.gayvillage.it) includes
music, theater performances, and other entertainment geared toward
gays and lesbians.

In this part . . .
T
uscany is the most visited region in Italy, and its concen-
tration of attractions — sights, scenery, food, and wine —
is beyond compare. Practically every hill town offers some-
thing interesting to visit. (This is true of all of Italy, but you’ll
ﬁnd so many more hills in Tuscany!) Tuscany has proud tradi-
tions and a unique character and ﬂavor, including the regional
delicacies that each part of Italy seems to offer. Umbria fol-
lows close behind, with a more dramatic landscape, a great
number of art towns, and a different but also delicious cui-
sine. Perugia, a city on a hill (of course) with a rich artistic
patrimony, is Umbria’s capital. In the following chapters, we
give you the top of the top, the not-to-be-missed things to see
and do in these regions. 
Chapter 13 is dedicated to the beautiful city of Florence.
Chapter 14 covers the northern Tuscan towns of Lucca and
Pisa and detours to the Italian Riviera for a glimpse of the
Cinque Terre, the ﬁve ﬁshing villages of Monterosso al Mare,
Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore. In Chapter
15, we take you to southern Tuscany to explore Siena, San
Gimignano, and the rest of the Chianti region, as well as to
Umbrian cities such as Assisi, Perugia, and Spoleto.

In This Chapter
 Finding your way to and around Florence
 Discovering the best neighborhoods, hotels, and restaurants
 Exploring the magnificent sights of Florence
 Getting the scoop on the best shopping areas and nightlife
F
lorence’s compact medieval and Renaissance core bustles with
modern life, is chock full of art and architecture, and is closed to
motorized traffic. The concentration and quality of Florence’s artistic
riches have made Florence into one of the paramount tourist stops in
Italy. Tourism has exploded, and this relatively small town is now
crammed with six million visitors annually.
You can hit the highlights in one day, if you really must, but we recom-
mend three days — unless you have children with you, as younger ones
will rapidly succumb to museum overload.
Getting There
By air
Florence is served by its own airport, the Aeroporto Amerigo Vespucci
(Peretola), and by Pisa’s nearby Aeroporto Galileo Galilei (see Chap-
ter 14). There are no direct flights from the United States to Florence or
Pisa, but connecting flights are available from a number of European and
Italian cities.
 Getting oriented at the airport: Florence’s airport is small and
easy to get around. ATMs, currency-exchange booths, and tourist
information desks can be found in the arrivals concourse.
 Navigating your way through passport control and Customs: Only
flights from countries outside the Schengen European Community
are subject to passport control, and, in most cases, you already
have passed it. Otherwise, you find two lines, one for European
Union citizens and another for outsiders. Once you collect your
suitcases you go through Customs, where you find two gates: one
for those who have something to declare (beyond the standard
allowance), and one for those who don’t.

 Getting from Florence’s airport to your hotel: Locally referred to
as Peretola after the name of the village nearby, the Aeroporto
Amerigo Vespucci (% 055-3061300; www.aeroporto.firenze.
it) is only 4km (21⁄2 miles) outside of Florence, a few minutes away
by public transportation. You find everything just outside the
arrivals concourse on your right. A taxi will take about 15 minutes
and cost about 20€ ($32). The Volainbus shuttle bus (SITA: % 800-
373760; ATAF: % 800-424500; www.ataf.net) costs 4.50€ ($7.20);
you can buy tickets on board. Shuttles leave for the 25-minute trip
every 20 minutes between 5:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. and hourly later
on, arriving at Florence’s SITA bus terminal, just behind the central
rail station of Santa Maria Novella. You can also get into town by
taking the regular city bus no. 62, which takes about half an hour
and also arrives at Santa Maria Novella; the fare is 1.20€ ($1.90).
 Getting from Pisa’s airport to your hotel: The Aeroporto Galileo
Galilei (% 050-849111; www.pisa-airport.com) is 80km (50
miles) west of Florence. The easiest way to get into town is to
board the dedicated shuttle train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.
it) from the airport’s terminal; it arrives at Florence’s air terminal
inside Santa Maria Novella rail station. The shuttle makes ten runs
a day, takes about an hour, and costs about 5.40€ ($8.60).
By train
Besides flying, the train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) is the best
way to get to Florence: Service is frequent and fast from all major Italian
towns. It will take you about two hours from Rome and three from
Venice. Trains arrive at Santa Maria Novella station, often abbreviated
SMN Firenze (% 055-288765); you find a luggage check at the head of
Track 16. Also at the station are a last-minute hotel-reservations desk
and a tourist information desk that distributes a free city map. Public
transportation is outside the station: You see a taxi stand and a bus ter-
minal with lines to most destinations in town. The station is also within
walking distance of a number of attractions.
By car
Florence lies on autostrada A1, in a good central position, only 277km
(172 miles) north of Rome and 298km (185 miles) south of Milan.
If you’re planning a driving tour of Tuscany, schedule it before or after
your stay in Florence. Either drop off the car when you arrive or pick it
up when you’re ready to leave, as Florence’s center is closed to traffic.
Parking lots are to the north of the historic district, under the SMN train
station and under Piazza Libertà, north of Fortezza da Basso.

Orienting Yourself in Florence
Florence developed beyond its medieval perimeter only toward the end
of the 19th century, and the new areas have little historic interest. The
historic district is quite small and has a relatively simple layout,
bisected east–west by the river Arno. The heart of it is on the north —
or right — bank of the river, with most top attractions clustered near it,
around Piazza del Duomo, Piazza della Repubblica, and Piazza della
Signoria. To its northern edge lies Santa Maria Novella train station
and Fortezza da Basso, an armory now transformed into an exposition
hall. North–south streets run toward the river, Via dei Calzaiuoli and
Via Ricasoli being the most central. Four bridges cross the Arno within
the historic district, but you mostly use only two of them: the famous
Ponte Vecchio, the most central, and Ponte Santa Trinità, the next
bridge west. The left bank of the Arno river is Oltrarno, literally meaning
“on the other side of the Arno”; its main hubs are Piazza del Carmine
and Piazza Santo Spirito.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Accademia
At the northeast corner of the historic district, this neighborhood devel-
ops around Piazza San Marco, where many bus lines cross. The main
attraction here is the Accademia, with Michelangelo’s famous David.
This is a quiet and accessible neighborhood with many picturesque
streets and what we feel is Florence’s prettiest piazza (Santissima
Annunziata).
Duomo
Right in the middle of it all, this neighborhood centers on Florence’s
magnificent Duomo. It is very well connected and serviced, with all
kinds of shops, restaurants, and hotels — plus it’s within walking dis-
tance of most major attractions. The elegant commercial district along
Via dei Tornabuoni is nearby, as is the business area near Piazza della
Repubblica and Via Roma. Visitors based here will feel in touch with the
everyday business life of Florence as well as with its more touristy side.
Fiesole
Only 4.5km (3 miles) north of Florence’s Duomo, Fiesole is a pleasant
small town on a hill from which you get marvelous views of the city and
the surrounding hills. It is only 10 to 20 minutes away by bus, depending
on the traffic, and is particularly pleasant in summer, when it offers a
cool, welcoming break from the stuffiness below. Fiesole is an excellent
place to stay if you want to be away from the crowds; it also makes a
nice dinner outing.

Fortezza da Basso
On the northeast side of SMN rail station, this neighborhood has grown
up around the Fortezza da Basso. It includes many hotels and restau-
rants catering mostly to businesspeople working in the area or attending
the commercial expositions held in the Centro Congressi (Expo Centre)
inside the fortress. Within walking distance of the centro storico and very
well connected, it offers an excellent compromise: The hotel standards
are high here, but the prices aren’t marked up because this is away from
the main tourist area. The downside to staying here is that it’s outside
the pedestrian zone, so you have to deal with car noise and exhaust. It’s
also a bit less picturesque, but you get more real-life surroundings.
Piazza del Carmine
The western half of Oltrarno was included within the walls of Florence
“only” in 1173. With many restaurants opening in the streets near the
river, the whole area has taken on some of the characteristics of
Trastevere in Rome — especially the old popular neighborhood of San
Frediano to the west, once a bit seedy and today bohemian.
Piazza della Signoria
This is the heart of medieval Florence. Packed with monuments and
museums, it’s where you find the Uffizi, the Bargello, and Ponte
Vecchio. Completely closed to traffic — public buses and electric
navettes (shuttle buses) excluded — it is a visitor’s heaven, with many
exciting restaurants and most of the best hotels. It is also where you see
all of the tourists who come to town, which may bother you. Its narrow
streets and hidden alleys, though, are delightful, and we love having our
hotel just steps from all the best art in Florence. You also see locals, who
come here all the time to shop and dine in the many fine restaurants.
Piazza Santo Spirito
Also included within the walls of Florence in 1173, the eastern part of
Oltrarno was and still is a quiet and elegant residential area. This is
where the rulers of Florence decided to build their last palace: Palazzo
Pitti. You find fewer attractions here, yet the magic of the medieval city
is still present, with the great advantage of reduced crowds and a more
real neighborhood. The Ponte Vecchio is only steps away.
Santa Croce
At the southeast corner of the historic district, this neighborhood is one
of our favorites: It’s within walking distance of all the major attractions,
yet enough out of the way so it’s not overcrowded with tourists — and
still residential enough to feel like a real place. However, it is less acces-
sible than other areas and has fewer restaurants and hotels. It’s centered
on the beautiful church of Santa Croce.
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
176

Santa Maria Novella
At the northwest corner of the historic district, this neighborhood is sit-
uated around the church of Santa Maria Novella — one of the key
attractions here, together with the church of San Lorenzo. It is the best
connected of all — SMN train and bus stations are just around the
corner — and has all the services you might need: hotels, restaurants,
shops, and a good share of attractions.
Teatro Comunale
Stretching around the theater that houses the Maggio Fiorentino
Festival (see “Finding more cool things to see and do,” later in this 
chapter), this residential area west of Santa Maria Novella is quiet and
historic — and a very pleasant place to stay. Although it is part of
medieval walled Florence, it is not completely closed to traffic and is
well connected by public transportation. Hotels are cheaper than in the
more central districts because they are not right by the Duomo or the
Uffizi, but those attractions are only a short walk away. We definitely rec-
ommend it.
Finding information after you arrive
You find three information desks in town; you can get maps and
brochures at each of them, but the last two are the best:
 Santa Maria Novella (Piazza Stazione 4/a; % 055-212245) at SMN
rail station; open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
and Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
 Via Cavour 1r (% 055-290832 or 055-290833), about 3 blocks north
of the Duomo; open Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to
6:30 p.m. and Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
 Borgo Santa Croce 29r (% 055-2340444), behind Piazza Santa
Croce; open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and
Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Getting Around Florence
Florence is very safe, but the major crime — especially in the historic
districts — is pickpocketing, an activity that traditionally occurs in
crowded areas (mostly train station, buses, and outdoor markets).
The free tourist office map is completely adequate for most visitors,
especially if you combine it with the free bus map you can get from the
ATAF information booth at the SMN train station. But if you’re an ambi-
tious explorer, you can buy a cartina con stradario (map with street
directory) at any newsstand for about 6€ ($9.60).
Chapter 13: Florence 177

On foot
Since the historic district is closed to all traffic except for public 
buses — no cars, no taxis, and no mopeds — and attractions lie rela-
tively close to one another, walking is the best way to enjoy the town.
The walk from the Accademia to Palazzo Pitti — probably the two far-
thest attractions from each other within the historic district — will take
you about one hour at an average pace; you also pass most of the major
sights in town along the way.
By bus
Florence’s bus system is well organized and easy to use. For the most
part, you’ll probably use the electric minibuses — identified by the let-
ters A, B, C, and D — which are allowed within the centro storico (his-
toric district). These minibuses do come in handy when your feet ache
after a long day at the Uffizi or shopping on Via Tornabuoni! Regular
buses are a great way to get quickly back and forth between Oltrarno
and the center of town (nos. 36 and 37), as well as to reach some out-
of-the-way attractions such as Fiesole (no. 7) or San Miniato (nos. 12
and 13).
You can buy bus tickets at the ATAF booth (% 800-424500) across from
the SMN train station, and at most bars, tobacconist shops (signed
tabacchi or by a white T on a black background), and newsstands; a
single ticket (a biglietto) costs 1.20€ ($1.90) in advance or 2€ ($3.20) on
board (exact fare only). It’s valid for 70 minutes on as many buses as you
want. You can save a bit if you get a Carta Agile — an electronic card
worth ten single tickets for the price of eight (10€/$16), or 20 tickets for
the price of 16 (20€/$32), which can be used by more than one person if
you’re traveling together (just pass it in front of the magnetic eye of the
machine on board the bus as many times as you have passengers in
your group; if you want to know how much money you have left on the
card, press the button on the machine marked info and swipe your
card). You can also get unlimited-ride passes: a 24-hour pass costs 
5€ ($8) and a three-day pass goes for 12€ ($19).

Street numbering, Florence style
Florence’s tradition of independence is probably behind the town’s peculiar way of
marking street addresses: Restaurant, office, and shop doors are numbered inde-
pendently from residential and hotel doors. The first set of numbers is usually painted
in red and always marked with the letter r appended to the number (for rosso, “red”);
the second is painted in black or blue. Therefore it can easily happen that no. 1r (office
or business) and no. 1 (private residence — or hotel — this is where it gets confus-
ing) are in different buildings, and maybe a few door numbers apart.

At press time the city was about to launch a new 24-hour ticket,
Passpartour, including all public transportation and CitySightseeing
tours (see later in this chapter) for 22€ ($35) adults and 11€ ($18) youth
under 15. They’re sold on City Sightseeing buses, at hotels, and from
ATAF ticket vendors. Another option is the Iris pass, which gives access
to all public transportation — including trains — within the province of
Florence and Prato, plus a 20 percent discount on attractions. It is avail-
able in denominations of one day (8€/$13 adult, 5€/$8 youth under 15)
and three days (23€/$37 for adults, 12€/$19 youth).
Remember that tickets need to be stamped upon boarding; unlimited-
ride passes need to be stamped only once on your first trip.
Staying in Style
Florence is a major tourist destination, and the choice of accommoda-
tions is large and varied. Still, it may be hard to secure a nice room at a
decent price during high season (May–June and Sept–Oct); depending
on your budget, you might have to settle for a less central location, or
else make sure you reserve well in advance (see Chapter 8 for more on
hotel booking).
If you arrive in Florence without a hotel reservation, your best bet is the
room-finding service run by the tourist info desk at the Santa Maria
Novella rail station. If you’re driving, there are similar services at the
tourist info desks in the Area di Servizio AGIP Peretola (rest area) on
Highway A11 (% 055-4211800) and in the Area di Servizio Chianti Est
on Highway A1 (% 055-621349).

Teatro Comunale
This is the best of the luxury hotels if you’re visiting Florence in summer:
While the beautiful 18th-century palazzo with its splendid salons is wel-
coming in any season, the large garden and swimming pool will feel
absolutely heavenly in the town’s heat — a unique plus for a centrally
located hotel. The large, individually decorated guest rooms are tasteful,
if a bit old-fashioned. All have beautiful bathrooms done in Carrara marble.
Rooms on the higher floors have small private terraces and panoramic
views of the city.

Hotel Bellettini
$
Duomo
This reliable, moderately priced hotel is run by two sisters who are very
friendly and helpful. Housed in a 14th-century palazzo just steps from 
the Duomo, it is pleasantly old-fashioned and offers simple, clean guest
rooms — some with fantastic views — and one of the best breakfasts in
town for the price, with a buffet that includes ham and fresh fruit. You can
get cheaper rates if you choose a shared bathroom, or you can splurge on
one of the superior rooms in the annex. The latter are more spacious and
come with Carrara marble bathrooms.
See map p. 180. Via de’ Conti 7, steps from the Duomo. % 055-213561. Fax: 055-
283551. www.hotelbellettini.com. Bus: 1, 6, or 11 to Martelli; take Via de’
Cerretani and turn right on Via de’ Conti. 140€ ($224) double. Rates include buffet
breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Calzaiuoli
$$$
Duomo
This centrally located hotel is a good moderate choice in an expensive
town, with a pleasant hall, a nice restaurant, and excellent accommoda-
tions. Guest rooms are spacious and stylish, decorated with care and taste.
Some of the bathrooms are small, but nicely outfitted in Carrara marble. If
you like sleeping with an open window, make sure you reserve a room at the
back: those overlooking Via dei Calzaiuoli get quite noisy with pedestrian
traffic, and the double-pane windows won’t help if you don’t close them.
See map p. 180. Via dei Calzaiuoli 6. % 055-212456. Fax: 055-268310. www.

Hotel Casci
$$
Accademia
We love this affordable family-run hotel not far from the Accademia.
Housed in a 15th-century palazzo once owned by the musician Gioacchino
Rossini, it has maintained its charm and character. Public spaces include
a pleasant room decorated with original frescoes — where the excellent
buffet breakfast is served. Guest rooms differ in size, but all are warm,
modern, and comfortable. Most bathrooms are small but very well kept.
The largest rooms are a good option for families.

hotel managed by a single family is named after the “papa” of Pinocchio.

The location in one of Florence’s most authentic neighborhoods is con-
venient to all major attractions in town. Guest rooms are large, simple, and
welcoming, with whitewashed walls, tiled floors, wrought iron beds, and a
few pieces of simple antiques or quality reproductions. Bathrooms are
small but scrupulously kept. The duplex rooms are great for families.

Hotel La Scaletta
$$
Piazza Santo Spirito
This hotel offers great value and lots of character in an excellent location
not far from Ponte Vecchio (on the Palazzo Pitti side). The property was
recently overhauled without violating the old-fashioned charm of the 15th-
century building (of which the hotel is on the second floor). Public spaces
include a roof terrace affording 360-degree views. Guest rooms are large,
some still with the original cotto floor, others with nice parquet. Bathrooms
vary greatly in size — some on the small side, others almost cavernous —
though all are tiled.

Hotel Savoy
$$$$
Piazza della Signoria
This is our favorite luxury hotel in Florence. In-depth renovations have
brought modernity to this landmark hotel — which opened in 1896 —
while respecting the original architecture. The splendid public spaces are
completed by a small but state-of-the-art fitness room, and a good restau-
rant cum bar. The spacious guest rooms are luxuriously appointed and
done in a refined Italian style: clean and elegant, but also warm and wel-
coming. One of the Savoy’s big draws is its special attention to children,
with games, gifts, and child-sized everything, including slippers and
bathrobes in the rooms.

This hotel occupies a 15th-century palazzo and its neighboring 17th-cen-

Santa Maria Novella
A nice addition to the Florence hotel scene, this small lodging is a mix of
charm and modernity. The public spaces are welcoming, with glowing fire-
places in winter and a pleasant rooftop terrace in good weather. Guest
rooms are spacious and uniquely decorated: The four-poster beds, fire-
places, antiques, and stylish modern furniture make you feel like an aris-
tocrat from this century — a rare opportunity. Bathrooms are modern and

Santa Croce
The guest rooms of this beautiful 14th-century palazzo, originally a con-
vent, then home to the Neri family, feel like the chambers in a private col-
lector’s home. The antique furnishings, original coffered ceilings and cotto
floors, inner garden and patio, modern bathrooms (some with Jacuzzis),
and high-end artwork make this a very desirable choice. The hotel is
accessible for people with limited mobility.

Santa Croce
This historic hotel — it opened in 1860 — was completely restored in 2001,
with good taste and an attention to detail that has brought it back to its
former splendor. We appreciate its location at the eastern edge of the his-
toric district, near our favorite church in Florence. Guest rooms are spa-
cious and bright, and some have private balconies; all afford romantic
views over the river or over Santa Croce. Bathrooms are modern and good-
sized.

Relais Santa Croce

Santa Croce
This small luxury hotel in the heart of the historic district offers the com-
fort level of the top hotels in Florence, with a warm atmosphere and
unique style — no dusty old elegance or stuffiness here. The 18th-century
Ciofi-Jacometti palazzo and its guest rooms combine antique furnishings
and period architectural details — the original frescoes are magnificent —
with contemporary Italian design. Precious fabrics, elegant wood panels,
and marble bathrooms — all with separate shower and tub — complete
the picture.

Piazzale Michelangiolo
If you don’t mind being a bit out of the hubbub in exchange for serenity
and the best views in Florence, this luxury hotel is for you. A member of
the Relais & Châteaux chain, La Vedetta occupies a respectfully restored
19th-century villa in neo-Renaissance style. Public spaces are simple yet
refined, allowing guests to fully concentrate on the unique panorama; they
include a sauna and fitness area, a lush private park with swimming pool,
terraces, and an elegant restaurant (which is highly recommended for its
food as well as its cooking classes). Guest rooms are spacious and bright,
decorated with parquet or original stone mosaic floors, and beautiful

Dining Out
Eating well in Florence is a lot cheaper than lodging, and good restau-
rants abound, though you have to compete with locals for a table at the
most popular restaurants. Just make reservations — even if it’s only ear-
lier on the same day — and you’ll be all set to sample the cuisine
Tuscans are (rightly) so proud of (just keep away from pizza, as they
have no clue; see Chapter 2). The best dining is between Santa Croce
and Piazza della Signoria, and also around Piazza del Carmine in
Oltrarno, the popular part of San Frediano.
Buca Mario dal 1886
$$$
Santa Maria Novella
FLORENTINE
This historic restaurant serves traditional Tuscan cuisine in a friendly
atmosphere. It’s housed in a cellar (buca in Florentine), with vaulted and
whitewashed dining rooms decorated with dark-wood paneling (the décor
is original). Everything is well prepared, though it doesn’t come cheap. We
liked the classic ribollita (a traditional soup of black cabbage, bread, and
vegetables) and the osso buco, as well as the coniglio fritto (fried rabbit), a
Tuscan delicacy!

Cantinetta Antinori Tornabuoni
$$$
Santa Maria Novella
FLORENTINE/ITALIAN
Antinori is the family name of the oldest and one of the best producers of
wine in Italy. In this restaurant, typical Tuscan dishes and many special-
ties from the Antinori farms are served to accompany the wine. The can-
tinetta (small wine cellar) occupies the 15th-century palazzo of this noble
family and serves as their winery in town. You can sample the vintages at
the counter, or sit at a table and have a full meal. The pappa al pomodoro
is delicious, as is the risotto with prawns.

Cavolo Nero
$$
Piazza del Carmine
FLORENTINE
Cavolo Nero serves great food, prepared with enthusiasm and creativity.
The name of the restaurant refers to the black cabbage (similar to kale)
that is typical of Tuscan cooking. The menu isn’t very extensive, but its
offerings are delicious. We enjoyed the homemade gnocchi with broccoli
and wild fennel, as well as the bass filet rolled in eggplant and served over
a yellow-pepper purée.

Cibrèo
$$$
Santa Croce
FLORENTINE
Renowned chef-owner Fabio Picchi changes his menu daily, depending on
the market and his imagination. The backbone of the menu is historic
Tuscan, with some recipes that go back to the Renaissance — but they’re
presented here in a modern way. One hallmark of the place is that you
won’t find pasta of any kind; the other is that dinner is at 7:30 or 9 p.m., and
if you choose the first service, you have to be out by 9 p.m. On the menu,
you find soufflés, polenta, roasted and stuffed birds — such as the superb
pigeon stuffed with a traditional fruit preparation — and the much imi-
tated pomodoro in gelatina (tomato aspic). For a more informal atmos-
phere and lower prices, you can try the trattoria next door (Via de’ Macci
122r) or the Caffè Cibrèo across the street.

Don Chisciotte

Fortezza da Basso
SEAFOOD
This small restaurant is rightfully known for its imaginative fish dishes,
served in a friendly but classy atmosphere. Just north of the main tourist
area, it gets quite busy, especially on weekends. The dining room is on the
second floor of a typical palazzo. We liked the tagliatelle with asparagus
and prawns, along with the tuna steak with cooked greens.

Duomo
FLORENTINE
Serving roasted meats since 1920, this informal restaurant prides itself on
its fiorentina (grilled porterhouse steak of local beef). Under the vaulted
ceilings of a 17th-century shopping gallery, you can relax and have excel-
lent Tuscan food at moderate prices. You may enjoy the crostini (toasted
bread with savory toppings), ribollita, and famous salsicce toscane alla
griglia con cannellini (grilled local sausages with Tuscan white beans). And
for the wine, you can visit the wine steward in the wine cellar to help you
make your selection.

Il Cantastorie

Piazza della Signoria
TUSCAN
With a good singer performing every night, excellent wine, and hearty
food, Il Cantastorie is always a lively spot. Defining itself as a bit of Tuscan
countryside in the heart of Florence, this pleasant trattoria is decorated in
the Tuscan tradition of terra-cotta floors and wooden tables. You find all
the typical Tuscan specialties and some of the best Chianti you’ve ever
had. Ribollita, salsiccia e bietola (pork sausages and green chard), crostoni
(larger version of crostini), and sottoli (vegetables preserved in herbs and
olive oil) are some of the choices you may find on a menu that changes
daily. The same management runs Il Cantinone (reviewed later).

Fast food, Florence style
For a cheap but delicious meal, drop by an alimentari (grocery shop) for picnic fixings.
Our favorite is Consorzio Agrario Pane and Co., Piazza San Firenze 5r, at Via Condotta
(% 055-213063; Bus: A to Condotta), where you find local cheeses and cured meats,
including the excellent cinghiale (wild boar), plus mineral water, wine, and all the rest.
You can also get a nice fruit tart or some other pastries.
Or head for the colorful and noisy Mercato Centrale, near Piazza San Lorenzo
(entrance on Via dell’Ariento), where you find stalls selling all kinds of edibles and
nonedibles, from fruits and vegetables to fragrant Tuscan bread. For a quick Florentine-
style bite, you can try the centuries-old fare served at Narbone (stand no. 292 on the
ground floor; Open: Mon–Sat 7 a.m.–2 p.m.), a counter with a few tables. We recom-
mend the panino col bollito (boiled beef sandwich) and, if you’re up to it, the trippa
alla Fiorentina (tripe with tomato sauce and Parmesan). At the other end of the spec-
trum, the elegant Cantinetta del Verrazzano (Via dei Tavolini 18r; % 055-268590; Open:

Piazza Santo Spirito
FLORENTINE
Il Cantinone combines a convivial atmosphere and good traditional
Florentine cuisine in a setting of low arched ceilings and long wooden
tables. It’s a real enoteca del Chianti Classico — a winery specializing 
in Chianti Classico, the heart of the DOCG Chianti (which means it’s
denomination controlled and guaranteed). To accompany the wine, try the
excellent soups — ribollita, pappa al pomodoro, pasta e fagioli (pasta 
and beans) — or the salsicce (grilled pork sausages). The prix-fixe menu

Looking for a gelato break?
Ice cream is certainly one of the best treats in Italy, and Florence is famous for its
gelato. Of a different school from the Venetian, the Roman, or the Sicilian gelati,
Florentine ice cream was invented — as were many other Tuscan gastronomic spe-
cialties — to gratify the palates of the Medicis. Alas, to our taste at least (one of us is
from Rome, you know), the Medici family had a very big sweet tooth, judging from the
result: Florentine ice cream is extremely sugary. You find some of the best in town at
Gelateria Vivoli (Via Isola delle Stinche 7r, between the Bargello and Santa Croce; 
% 055-292334; Bus: A to Piazza Santa Croce), which is truly a marvel for its zillions of
flavors, but also at Coronas Café (Via Calzaiuoli 72r; % 055-2396139; Bus: A to
Orsanmichele) and Perchè No (Via dei Tavolini 19r, just off Via Calzaiuoli; % 055-
2398969; Bus: A to Orsanmichele), one of the oldest Florentine gelaterie. For excellent
Sicilian gelato that’s been rated among the best in Italy, stop by Gelateria Carabé (Via

We love this elegant restaurant, where the service is always impeccable
and the cuisine superb — and the prices remain moderate. The first
courses might include an excellent zuppa di cicerchie con mazzancolle
(local legume soup with local prawns) or perhaps artichoke ravioli with
prawns, followed by a second course of delicious guinea fowl in a Chianti

with delicious sauces), usually served mid-week in winter. Both the dessert
and the wine menus are very satisfactory.

Florence offers precious little in the way of bargains. You might consider
the Iris pass (see “Getting Around Florence,” earlier in this chapter),
which gives you a 20 percent discount on most attractions.
Reservations are not required at Florence’s most sought-after attrac-

fee is well worth it to avoid the long lines (or to avoid not getting in at
all). Call % 055-294883 during office hours (Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m.,
Sat 8:30 a.m.–12:30 p.m.,) and pick a time slot (every 15 minutes during
opening hours, see listing later in this chapter); the English-speaking
operator will give you a confirmation number. Alternately, make your

it with a credit card. In either case, you need to arrive at the museum a
bit before your selected time to pay (cash only) for your ticket, or to
pick it up if you have prepaid. Make sure you don’t line up in the wrong
queue (don’t be shy to ask, you need the reserved tickets line, where at
most you find only the people in your time slot: 20 at the Uffizi and
double that at the Accademia). You can always make last-minute reser-

Baptistery of St. John
Duomo
Part of the tricolored marble trio on Piazza del Duomo (see also the
Duomo and Giotto’s Bell Tower, in this section), the octagonal Baptistery
is a beautiful example of the Florentine Romanesque style. It was probably
built on the site of a Roman palace and splendidly decorated. Glittering
13th-century mosaics cover the interior. The Baptistery’s north and east
doors — the life’s work of Lorenzo Ghiberti — are the key attractions here.
He began working on the beautiful bronze reliefs adorning the north doors
in 1401, when he was 20, and finished them more than two decades later.
They are now considered one of the world’s most important pieces of
Renaissance sculpture; see, for instance, how they depict Isaac’s sacrifice
with marvelous detail. The east doors, completed shortly before the

A bit of Florentine history
The first town to develop in the area was not Florence but Fiesole, up the hill over-
looking what was to become Florence. Fiesole began thriving in the ninth century B.C.
and grew to became an important Etruscan center. During Roman rule, though, it lost
importance, and Florence was born on its splendid location by the Arno river. A flour-
ishing but small village until medieval times, Florence suddenly developed into a town
when it grew to be a great banking center, dominating the European credit market.
The town’s wealth encouraged the development of the arts and of a lively culture, such
as Dante (born here in 1265) and Cimabue (Giotto’s teacher). The Renaissance blos-
somed in the 1300s, despite difficulties that deterred it elsewhere, floods, the black
plague, and political upheaval.
The 15th century brought the rule of Lorenzo the Magnificent, head of the powerful
Medici clan, and the town reached its apogee. By this point, Florence had become the
leading city-state in central Italy, overcoming the competition of nearby Siena and
Pisa. Artists such as Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael produced amazing works.
After a brief restoration of the republic, in 1537, the Medici family returned to power
in the person of Cosimo I, but it was the end of the Renaissance: The Inquisition began
in 1542, suffocating cultural life, while Italy became the appetizing booty of the suc-
cession wars among royal families in Europe. Florence Gran Duchy resisted as such
and passed to the Lorraine house, which maintained its power and independence
through the 17th and 18th centuries, passing then to the Bourbon. In 1860, the popu-
lation rebelled and was able to join the burgeoning Italian kingdom. Florence was then
made the capital of Italy for five short years, from 1865 to 1870, when the honor finally
moved to Rome.

artist’s death, are even more beautiful: Known as the Gates of Paradise
(when he saw them, Michelangelo supposedly said, “These doors are fit
to stand at the gates of Paradise,” and the name stuck), the ten panels
show stunning scenes from the Old Testament. The panels presently in
place are copies of the originals, which have been moved to the Museo
dell’Opera del Duomo (see later in this section) for safekeeping. The
south doors were created by Andrea Pisano in the mid–14th century and
show a more static Gothic style than Ghiberti’s revolutionary work.

Bargello Museum
Signoria
If you like sculpture, we think visiting this museum instead of the Galleria
dell’Accademia (see later in this section) is a better use of your time: The
Bargello hides a treasury of Renaissance sculpture, with two Davids by
Donatello (one in marble, the other in bronze) and another David by
Michelangelo (it may also be Apollo). In addition, you find several other
works by Michelangelo, including a bust of Brutus and the famous drunken
Bacchus (which he executed when he was only 22). You also find the bust
of Cosimo I by Benvenuto Cellini. Compare the two bronze panels depict-
ing the Sacrifice of Isaac, one by Brunelleschi and one by Ghiberti, which
were submitted in the famous contest to see who’d get to do the
Baptistery doors (see earlier in this section).
The museum is housed in the Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo, which
dates back to 1255. This is the oldest seat of Florence’s government and
was the official residence of the Podestà (governor) until 1502; it then
became the seat of the Justice and Police Council. Hence the name
bargello, which meant “cop” in local parlance, and was used to refer to the
chief of police. The prisons here were used until the 19th century; it was
only in 1886 that the Bargello was transformed into the sculpture museum
of Florence.

Duomo (Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore)
Duomo
The Duomo’s famous red-tiled dome, a masterpiece of great Renaissance
architect Filippo Brunelleschi, is the symbol of Florence (the church
facade, in contrast, is a much later addition in neo-Gothic style). The
largest in the world at the time it was built, the dome is 45m (150 ft.) wide
and 104m (300 ft.) high from the drum to the distinctive lantern at the top
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
196

of the cupola. Brunelleschi had to take over the project when the previ-
ous builders left off, unsure of how to complete the building without
having it collapse; his ingenious solution was to construct the dome in two
layers enclosing a space inside, and to have each layer become progres-
sively thinner toward the top, thus reducing the weight. If you’re up to it,
you can climb the 463 spiraling steps hidden in the space between the
layers to see this architectural marvel from the inside.
The dome was frescoed by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari, while the
rest of the interior was frescoed by Paolo Uccello in the 1430s and 1440s.
Take notice of the memorial to Sir John Hawkwood, an English mercenary
hired by the Florentines, who promised him a statue but gave him a fresco
of a statue instead. The bronze doors of the New Sacristy, by Luca della
Robbia, are the best work of art inside the Duomo.
Under the Duomo, you can visit the remains of Santa Reparata, the former
Duomo, torn down in 1375 to build the new cathedral. Excavations, begun
in 1966, uncovered a rich trove of material dating back over centuries,
including walls of Roman houses and Roman ceramic, glass, and metal-
work, as well as paleo-Christian and medieval objects (Brunelleschi’s
tombstone was also discovered here). Free tours are given Monday
through Saturday, every 40 minutes from 10:30 a.m. to noon and 3 to 
4:20 p.m.

lier. Closed all religious holidays (check Web site above for full list).
Galleria degli Uffizi
Piazza della Signoria
Occupying a Renaissance palazzo built by Vasari to house the adminis-
trative offices (uffizi means “offices”) of the Tuscan Duchy, the gallery
houses a mind-blowing collection of work. Here you pictorially experience
the birth of the Renaissance, seeing how the changing ideas about the
nature of humanity (the new humanism) were translated into visual form.
Medieval artists weren’t bad painters — their work just reflected a holis-
tically Christian viewpoint, with no concept of “nature” as something sep-
arate from the divine — but the new humanism changed all this. You can
witness this shift if you start your visit with Cimabue’s great Crucifixion,
still inspired by the flat forms and ritualized expressions of Byzantine art.
Follow with the work of his student Giotto, where the human figure begins
to take on greater realism. The work of Sandro Botticelli — including his
Birth of Venus (the goddess emerging from the waves on a shell) and
Primavera (an ambiguous allegory of spring) — show how the revival of
classical (pagan) myth opened a new range of expression and subject.
Chapter 13: Florence 197

Across from Botticelli’s Venus, don’t miss the spectacular triptych of Hugo
van der Goes, whose humanism emerges in the intensity of expression
and powerful realism of his poor peasants (also look for the fanciful mon-
ster lurking in the right panel). Piero della Francesca’s diptych features
full-profile portraits of Federico da Montefeltro and his wife, painted in the
third quarter of the 15th century; note how he brings his subjects to life
with luminosity and incredible detail, warts and all. You can then delight in
the full explosion of the Renaissance, with Masaccio’s Madonna and Child
with St. Anne, Leonardo’s Adoration of the Magi and Annunciation,
several Raphaels, Michelangelo’s Holy Family, Caravaggio’s Bacchus . . .
there’s so much at the Uffizi that you should really come twice to absorb
it all. At press time, renovation of the exhibit space was ongoing, but visits
to the gallery were not affected.

vation 4€ ($6.40). Open: Tues–Sun 8:15 a.m.–6:50 p.m. Last admission 45 minutes ear-
lier. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Galleria dell’Accademia (Michelangelo’s David)
Accademia
The Accademia’s undisputed star is Michelangelo’s David, set on a
pedestal at the heart of the museum. Michelangelo was just 29 when he
took a 5.1m (17-ft.) column of white Carrara marble abandoned by another
sculptor and produced the masculine perfection of Il Gigante (The Giant),
as David is nicknamed. The statue stands beneath a rotunda built
expressly for it in 1873, when it was moved here from Piazza della Signoria
(a copy stands in its place on the square). In 1991, David was attacked by
a lunatic with a hammer, so you now have to view him through a rein-
forced-glass shield (like the Pietà in Vatican City). The gallery’s other
remarkable works include Michelangelo’s St. Matthew and his interesting
series of Slaves (which are either unfinished or were poetically left partly
formed from the original hunks of stone). Among the paintings, you find
Perugino’s Assumption and Descent from the Cross (the latter done in
collaboration with Filippino Lippi); The Virgin of the Sea, attributed to
Botticelli; and Pontormo’s Venus and Cupid.

booth closes 45 minutes earlier. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Giotto’s Bell Tower
Duomo
Giotto was known as a painter and not an architect — but shortly before the 
end of his life, he designed this beautiful, soaring 84m (276-ft.) bell tower
banded with pink, green, and white marble. Giotto had completed only the
first two levels by his death in 1337, and the replacement architect had to
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
198

correct the mistakes Giotto had made — such as not making the walls
thick enough to support the structure. Some of the artwork that originally
graced the tower — by Donatello, Francesco Talenti, Luca della Robbia,
and Andrea Pisano — are now housed in the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo
(see later in this section), so copies have taken their place. If you’re up to
it, climbing the 414 steps to the top affords excellent views of the city and
especially of the Duomo next door.
See map p. 194. Piazza Duomo. % 055-2302885. www.operaduomo.firenze.it.
Bus: A, 1, 6, 7, 10, or 11. Admission: 6€ ($9.60). Open: Daily 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Last
admission 20 minutes earlier. Closed Jan 1, Easter, Sept 8, and Dec 25.
Medici Chapels
Duomo
With a separate entrance to the back of the church of San Lorenzo, these
chapels were part of the same structure; the burial place of the Medici
family, they are more a tribute to Michelangelo than to the people who
bankrolled the Renaissance. While the octagonal Chapel of the Princes is
a gaudy baroque affair, decorated with marble and semiprecious stones
and containing monumental tombs of Medici grand dukes, the New
Sacristy, begun by Michelangelo and finished by the artist/author Vasari,
is somber and impressive. The design reflects some of the elements of the
Old Sacristy inside San Lorenzo (see later in this section), but with bold
innovations so that it became one of the founding works of the Mannerist
style. Michelangelo’s funerary sculptures are brilliant: The Monument to
Lorenzo Duca d’Urbino represents the seated duke flanked by Aurora
(Dawn) and Crepuscolo (Dusk); the Monument to Giuliano Duca di
Nemours (the son of Lorenzo the Magnificent) is shown rising, with the
figures of Giorno (Day) and Notte (Night) at his sides. In front of the sacristy’s 
altar is Michelangelo’s Madonna and Child; Lorenzo the Magnificent is
buried under this sculpture. Ironically, because Michelangelo didn’t live
to complete his plan (he died in 1564), Lorenzo got a much less magnificent 
tomb than some of the lesser Medicis. To the left of the altar is a small sub-
terranean chamber containing some drawings attributed to Michelangelo;
you can see them by making an appointment when you enter.
See map p. 194. Piazza Madonna degli Aldobrandini, behind the church of San
Lorenzo. % 055-294883. www.polomuseale.firenze.it. Bus: 1 or 6 to Martelli

utes earlier. Closed second and fourth Sun of each month; first, third, and fifth Mon

Museo dell’Opera del Duomo
Duomo
We definitely recommend visiting this museum: It’s where you find all of
the original Renaissance works that decorated the Duomo, its Bell Tower,
and its Baptistery (see earlier in this section) — they were removed from
their settings to avoid damage from pollution and hammer-wielding mani-
acs. You see Ghiberti’s breathtaking bronze Gates of Paradise panels from
Chapter 13: Florence 199

the Baptistery; Donatello’s highly realistic sculpture of Habakkuk and his
Mary Magdalen in polychromed wood from Giotto’s Bell Tower; one of
Michelangelo’s Pietà; and Luca della Robbia’s cantoria (choir loft) facing
a similar work by Donatello, offering an example of the diversity of
Renaissance styles.

Last admission 40 minutes earlier.
Orsanmichele
Piazza della Signoria
Born as a granary and warehouse, this building was transformed into a
church in the 14th century, when it was the site of a miracle — an image of
the Madonna supposedly appeared here. The new church was decorated
by the best artists of the time, including Donatello, Ghiberti, Verrocchio,
and others. Inside, you find vaulted Gothic arches, 500-year-old 
frescoes, and a stone-encrusted 14th-century tabernacle by Andrea
Orcagna protecting a 1348 Madonna and Child by Bernardo Daddi. The 
art — including the originals from the church facade (those there now are
copies) — is in the attached museum, accessible from the Palazzo della
Lana of the powerful wool merchants’ guild (wool is lana in Italian), built
in 1308. After lengthy restorations, the site has reopened for special
exhibits, but it should be fully operational by the time of your visit. Check
the Web site below before you head out.

Tues–Sun 10a.m.–5 p.m.
Palazzo Pitti and Giardino di Boboli
Piazza Santo Spirito
Begun in 1458 by the textile merchant/banker Luca Pitti, the palazzo was
finished by the Medici family in 1549 (they tripled its size and added the
Boboli Gardens). It now houses several museums, the best of which is the
Galleria Palatina, with its superb collection of paintings by Raphael,
including his famous La Fornarina (modeled on the features of his Roman
mistress), Andrea del Sarto, Titian, Veronese, and Tintoretto. Also worth
a visit are the Royal Apartments, where three ruling families once resided
(the Medici, Lorena, and Savoy), now adorned with furnishings and rich
decorations from the Renaissance to Rinascimento. You could spend your
whole day in the Palazzo, but if your time is limited, you might want to con-
tinue with a visit to the Boboli Gardens, the palazzo’s grandiose Italianate
gardens. Covering 11 acres, the space was designed in the 16th century
and expanded in the 18th and 19th centuries. Take the Viottolone (literally
“large lane”) — lined with laurels, cypresses, and pines and punctuated by
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
200

statues — to the Piazzale dell’Isolotto, with the beautiful Fontana
dell’Oceano (Ocean Fountain). You also see several pavilions, such as the
18th-century neoclassical Palazzina della Meridiana as well as the ele-
gant Casino del Cavaliere — built in the 17th century as a retreat for the
Granduca. It houses the Porcelain Museum, which includes Sèvres,
Chantilly, and Meissen pieces, as they were used at the tables of the three
reigning families that resided in the palace.

Palazzo Vecchio
Piazza della Signoria
Built in 1299, this palazzo housed the Signoria — Florence’s government — 
during its first period and was taken over by Cosimo de’ Medici and his
family in the 16th century, before they moved to Palazzo Pitti. They are
responsible for the grandiose redecoration. The highlight is the Hall of
the 500 (Sala dei Cinquecento), where the 500-member council met when
Florence was still a republic and before the Medicis’ rule; here you find
Michelangelo’s Genius of Victory statue. On the upper floor are the pri-
vate apartments of the Grand Duc, including the private chapel of Eleonora
di Toledo (wife of Cosimo), masterfully frescoed by Bronzino, along with
several elegant halls.

Open: Fri–Wed 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Thurs 9 a.m.–2 p.m. Ticket booth closes 60 minutes ear-
lier. Closed Jan 1, Easter, May 1, Aug 15, and Dec 25.
Chapter 13: Florence 201
The birth of opera
The story goes that in 1589, the Medici organized a wedding reception in the Giardino
di Boboli and, of course, wanted something grand. They hired the best local composers
of the time — Jacopo Peri and Ottavio Rinuccini — to provide musical entertainment.
The pair came up with the idea of setting a classical story to music and having actors
sing the whole thing, as in a modern musical. The show was a great success and the
Medici added another feather to their caps: the birth of opera.

Piazza della Signoria
Piazza della Signoria
Signoria is the name of the political system that governed the city during
medieval times — the Medicis were the signori (lords) — and this was the
political heart of Florence. A beautiful example of medieval architecture,
the L-shaped square is flanked by the Palazzo Vecchio (see earlier) on the
east side and the famous Loggia della Signoria on the south. This elegant
Gothic structure is also called Loggia dei Lanzi (after the Lanzichenecchi
soldiers who camped here in the 16th century) or Loggia dell’Orcagna —
after Andrea di Cione, called Orcagna, the supposed architect (in fact, it
was built by Benci Cione and Simone Talenti). Once used for political cer-
emonies, it later became a sculpture workshop.
Several sculptures still decorate it, including the Rape of the Sabines —
an essay in three-dimensional Mannerism — and Hercules with Nessus
the Centaur, both by Giambologna. He’s also the creator of the bronze
equestrian statue of Cosimo de’ Medici in the middle of the square. Also
in the Loggia are Benvenuto Cellini’s famous Perseus, holding up the sev-
ered head of Medusa; a copy of Michelangelo’s David (the original was
moved to the Galleria dell’Accademia in the 19th century); and a Heracles
by Baccio Bandinelli. At the corner of Palazzo Vecchio is the much criti-
cized Fountain of Neptune, built by the architect Ammannati in 1575 and
disparaged by Michelangelo as well; Florentines used to mock it as Il
Biancone (“Big Whitey”).

Savonarola was here
Another famous town resident was the passionate reformer Girolamo Savonarola. He
was the prior of the Dominican monastery of San Marco (see later in this section) and
devoted his life to the purification of the Catholic church and the Florentines. He
directed the burning of jewels, books, riches, and art pieces judged too “pagan” on
pyres erected in Piazza della Signoria. His sermons against worldly corruption gave
him increasingly more political power, but eventually brought him into conflict with Pope
Alexander VI (who had four illegitimate children, including Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia).
Excommunicated and betrayed by the Florentines who at one time supported him, he
was condemned as a heretic and burned on Piazza della Signoria in 1498. The small disk
in the ground near the Fountain of Neptune marks the spot where he was executed.

during their retreat from Italy toward the end of World War II (they’ve since
been replaced). Today, this symbol of the city of Florence offers beautiful
views and thrives with shops selling leather goods, jewelry, and other
items. If you look up, you’ll see the famous Vasari Corridor: After the com-
pletion of the Palazzo Pitti in the 16th century, Cosimo de’ Medici commis-
sioned Vasari to build an aboveground “tunnel” running along the Ponte
Vecchio rooftops and linking the Palazzo degli Uffizi with the new palazzo.
See map p. 194. At the end of Via Por Santa Maria. Bus: B.
San Lorenzo
Duomo
San Lorenzo, founded in the fourth century, was the parish church of the
powerful Medici family, some of whom are buried in the Medici Chapels
(see earlier in this section). Behind its unfinished facade, it hides a treas-
ure-trove of artwork: The counter-facade was decorated by Michelangelo,
while the interior was designed by Brunelleschi; the monument to the left
of the Sacristy’s entrance is a masterpiece Verrocchio created for Giovanni
and Piero de’ Medici. The Old Sacristy itself is a tour de force of
Renaissance architecture, designed by Brunelleschi and then decorated
by Donatello, who executed the cherubs all around the cupola; he might
also be the author of the bronze pulpits and the terra-cotta bust of San
Lorenzo — or they could be by Desiderio da Settignano. From the pretty
cloister on the left of the basilica facade, you can reach — via an elabo-
rate stone staircase — another of Michelangelo’s works: Also designed in

of manuscripts, some of which are on display.

San Marco and Museum
Accademia
The main reason for a visit to this Dominican monastery is to see the early
Renaissance masterpieces by the incomparable Fra’ Beato Angelico —
vividly painted, exceptionally human works. The dormitory contains his
famous Annunciation, while the part of the structure that’s now a museum
contains panel paintings and altar pieces, including the Crucifixion.
Another notable work here is the Last Supper by Ghirlandaio. The church
itself is decorated with works by Fra Bartolomeo and other artists.

Santa Croce, Cappella Pazzi, and Museo dell’Opera di Santa Croce
Santa Croce
This is the world’s largest Franciscan church, begun in 1294 by Arnolfo di
Cambio, the first architect of Florence’s Duomo, and a magnificent exam-
ple of Italian Gothic. Many notable Renaissance figures have found their
final resting place in this church: Over 270 tombstones pave the floor, and
monumental tombs line its walls. Michelangelo, Galileo, Rossini, and
Machiavelli are all buried here; Dante’s tomb is just a cenotaph (an empty
burial monument) because he died in exile in Ravenna and was buried
there. The convent compound’s key attraction are not Giotto’s frescoes in
the church — which are not very well preserved — but the 15th-century
Cappella de’ Pazzi, a wonderful example of early Renaissance architec-
ture by Brunelleschi.
Don’t miss the Museo dell’Opera di Santa Croce, which houses art taken
from the church and the cloisters, including a splendid sculpture of San
Ludovico da Tolosa by Donatello. The famous Crucifixion by Cimabue is
also on display, although restoration of the artwork was not able to undo
the great damage caused by the flood of 1966.
See map p. 194. Piazza Santa Croce. % 055-2466105. www.santacroce.
firenze.it. Bus: C. Admission: 5€ ($8) includes admission to the Museo
dell’Opera di Santa Croce. Open: Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Sun and holidays
1–5:30 p.m. Closed all religious holidays.
Santa Maria Novella and Museum
Santa Maria Novella
This splendid example of Italian Gothic was built as a Dominican church
between 1246 and 1360; it is decorated with frescoes by such great artists
as Domenico Ghirlandaio and Filippino Lippi, but the star of the show is
the Trinità by Masaccio. The other star is Giotto’s Crucifix, gracing the
main nave. Adjoining the church is the entry to the museum, which occu-
pies the cloisters of the church, including the splendid Green Cloister,
named for the beautiful coloration of its frescoes (some by Paolo Uccello).
The Cappellone degli Spagnoli (Chapel of the Spaniards) is worth a visit:
It was frescoed by Andrea di Bonaiuto between 1367 and 1369 with scenes
from the lives of Christ and St. Peter as well as two famous Triumphs, that
of St. Thomas and that of the Dominicans. (Cosimo de’ Medici’s wife,
Eleonora, was from Toledo, Spain, hence the name of the chapel.)
See map p. 194. Piazza Santa Maria Novella. % 055-215918. Bus: 6, 11, 36, 37, or A.
Admission: 2.70€ ($4.30). Open: Mon–Thurs and Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; Sun and holidays
9 a.m.–2 p.m. Ticket booth closes 30 minutes earlier.
Santo Spirito
Piazza Santo Spirito
Behind the 18th-century facade of this church, you discover an architec-
tural jewel. Built between 1444 and 1488, the interior was designed by
Brunelleschi and is divided into three naves separated by elegant arches;
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
204

the sacristy was designed by Sangallo, while the handsome bell tower on
the left of the facade was designed by Baccio d’Agnolo. Inside, you find
frescoes and paintings from various artists. Do not miss the beautiful
Madonna col Bambino e santi by Filippino Lippi.
See map p. 194. Piazza Santo Spirito. % 055-210030. Admission: Free. Open:
Mon–Tues and Thurs–Sat 10 a.m.–12:30 and 4–6 p.m.; Sun 4–6 p.m.
Finding more cool things to see and do
After you’ve exhausted all the “musts” on your list, here are a few more
worthwhile sights and activities:
 Because of the limited children’s activities in Florence, the popular
workshops at the Bottega dei Ragazzi (Via dei Fibbiai 2; % 055-
2478386; www.istitutodeglinnocenti.it; Open: Mon–Sat 
9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–7 p.m.) need to be booked well in advance. For
some spontaneous play, head for the few gardens where children
are allowed to romp (mind you, only in the dedicated gated areas):
You find a small playground inside Giardino dell’Orticultura (Via
Vittorio Emanuele 4; open daily 8:30 a.m. to sunset), connected to
Orti di Parnaso (Via Trento) with its colorful dragon fountain;
another playground is hidden in the Giardino Tosco-Laziale, and is
accessible from inside Giardino Villa Fabbricotti (Via Vittorio
Emanuele 64, same hours).
 The Palazzo Medici Riccardi (Via Cavour 3; % 055-2760340; www.
palazzo-medici.it; Bus: 1, 6, 7, 10, or 11; Open: Thurs–Tues 
9 a.m.–7 p.m., ticket booth closes 30 minutes earlier; Admission:
5€/$8) is where Cosimo de’ Medici and his family lived before 
they took over the Palazzo Vecchio. It was built by Michelozzo in
1444 and has a lighter feel than later palazzi, such as the Pitti.
Benozzo Gozzoli, a student of Fra Angelico’s, decorated the 
chapel — Cappella dei Magi — with marvelous frescoes. The
palazzo gives a good idea of what upper-class Florentine life was
like during the Renaissance.
 During the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (see “Living It Up After
Dark,” later in this chapter), the town organizes a variety of events,
including special museum exhibits, street performances, musical
performances in bars and boutiques, and even a golf tournament! 
A prize is awarded for the best shop-window decorations following
the Maggio Fiorentino theme. Ask your hotel or the tourist office
for the special program that’s published and distributed for the
occasion.
 If you’re in town toward the end of June, do not miss the tourna-
ment of Renaissance soccer, the Gioco di Calcio Storico Fiorentino
(% 055-290832) in which two sets of 27 players confront each
other. This rather rough play takes place on the 16th, 24th, and
30th of June to mark the feast of St. John, Florence’s patron saint.
Each day culminates with fireworks on the river Arno.
Chapter 13: Florence 205

 The little hill town of Fiesole, 4.5km (3 miles) north of Florence,
makes a wonderful excursion. It’s just an easy bus ride away (take
no. 7 from SMN train station or Piazza San Marco). Fiesole existed
well before Florence — it started as an Etruscan settlement in 
the sixth century B.C. — and retains the character of a small town
and its independence as a municipality. In summer, it hosts music,
theater, and other cultural events. Be sure to visit the Duomo
(Cattedrale di San Romolo) on the main square, Piazza Mino da
Fiesole, which was built in 1028. The archaeological area includes
Roman and Etruscan ruins: Teatro Romano and Museo Civico (Via
Partigiani 1; % 055-59477; www.fiesolemusei.it; Open: Oct–Mar
Thurs–Mon 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Apr–Sept Wed–Mon 10 a.m.–7 p.m.). The
theater, built in the first century B.C., is the site of outdoor concerts
in summer. The Museo Bandini, near the Duomo, features 13th- to
15th-century Tuscan art. A combination ticket, Biglietto Fiesole
Musei, includes all admissions for 10€ ($16).
Seeing Florence by guided tour
Florapromotuscany (Via Pellicceria 1; %/Fax 55-210301; www.
florapromotuscany.com) offers a great choice of guided walking tours
as well as a boat tour on the Arno River, all led by official and licensed
tourist guides. They offer museum tours, with a wide range of choices
including the Accademia and Uffizi, and they sometimes arrange custom
tours as well.
We like the hop-on/hop-off bus tour run by CitySightseeing (% 800-
424500; www.firenze.city-sightseeing.it); 24-hour tickets cost
20€ ($32) adults and 10€ ($16) children 5 to 15, and are valid on their
two loop-lines: the A, which makes 15 stops between SMN train station
and Piazzale Michelangelo (every 30 minutes daily), and the B, making
24 stops between Porta San Frediano in Oltrarno and Fiesole (every 
60 minutes daily). Tickets are for sale onboard or are included in the
special bus ticket Passpartour (see “Getting Around” earlier in this 
chapter).
Touring a city by Segway is a lot of fun (see “Seeing Rome by guided tour”
in chapter 12). Italy Segway Tours Segway Florence (% 055-291958;
www.segwayfirenze.com) offers daily three-hour tours at 10 a.m. and 
3 p.m. in English for 90€ ($144); you can reserve online up to two days
in advance, or by phone up to a few hours before the tour (but obvi-
ously they might be sold out for the day).
Suggested one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
You could easily spend a week in Florence and not tire of it, especially if
you take day trips to the destinations highlighted in the next two chap-
ters. But if your time is limited, you’ll need to make choices. Here’s what
we would do:
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
206

Florence in one day
If you only have one day in Florence, you have to start bright and 
early. Head to the Galleria dell’Accademia (where you’ve made 
advance reservations), strolling on your way through Piazza Santissima
Annunziata — one of Florence’s nicest squares — and maybe stopping
for a gelato at Carabé (see “Looking for a gelato break?” earlier in this
chapter). For those who are not as keen on the David, we recommend
the Bargello Museum, near Piazza della Signoria, Florence’s best sculp-
ture museum. Head later to the Duomo, enjoying the sight of the cathe-
dral and of Giotto’s Bell Tower, but linger only in the Baptistery, since
you’re short on time. After your visit, lunch on a sampling of cheeses
and cured meats from the Tuscan countryside at Consorzio Agrario
Pane and Co. (see “Fast food, Florence style,” earlier in this chapter)
while you wait for your timed entry to the Galleria degli Uffizi, where
you’ve also made advance reservations. Once you are oversaturated
with Renaissance paintings, walk around Piazza della Signoria, taking in
Palazzo Vecchio; then head for Ponte Vecchio on Via Por Santa Maria,
and cross over to Oltrarno. Check out some of the shops on your way,
such as C.O.I. for gold, Cirri for embroidered linen, Madova Gloves for,
well, gloves, and Giulio Giannini & Figlio for marbleized paper (see
“Shopping the Local Stores,” later in this chapter). After a nice stroll
along the Arno, it is now time for aperitivo, and what better opportunity
to try the Florentine invention Negroni? Try it at the Negroni Florence
Bar (see “Bars, pubs, and clubs,” later in this chapter). For dinner, treat
yourself at Cibrèo (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter).
Florence in two days
Two days are a lot better than one — you’re able to see most of the high-
lights in town.
Day 1
Dedicate the morning to sculpture: the Galleria dell’Accademia, if 
you absolutely want to see the David, and the Museo del Bargello, for
Florence’s best sculpture museum. Near the Accademia, stroll to Piazza
Santissima Annunziata for a peek at one of Florence’s nicest squares and
a stop for gelato at Carabé (see “Looking for a gelato break?” earlier in
this chapter). Later on, pick up the makings of a tasty picnic at Consorzio 
Agrario Pane and Co., or have a full lunch at Osteria Ganino or Pane e
Vino (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter). Continue your day with
the Galleria degli Uffizi, where you have made advance reservations.
After your visit, spend the rest of your afternoon and evening exploring
Ponte Vecchio, Palazzo Vecchio, and Piazza della Signoria.
Day 2
Start your day with an exploration of the Duomo, with Giotto’s Bell
Tower and the Baptistery. Continue with the Museo dell’Opera del
Chapter 13: Florence 207

Duomo. Have lunch at Le Mossacce (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this
chapter). In the afternoon, head for the church of San Lorenzo, and visit
the Medici Chapels behind it as well. You can also stroll through the
Mercato San Lorenzo for some shopping (see later in this chapter)
before heading for the church of Santa Maria Novella and its splendid
cloisters. Have your Negroni aperitivo at the cafe that invented it,
Giacosa (see “Bars, pubs, and clubs,” later in this chapter). For dinner,
treat yourself at Cibrèo (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter).
Florence in three days
Three days is a good number: You’re able to see all the best the town
has to offer, without feeling pressed for time.
Days 1 and 2
Follow Days 1 and 2 in “Florence in two days,” earlier in this chapter.
Day 3
Head for the Basilica Santa Croce, and visit the Cappella Pazzi and 
the Museo dell’Opera di Santa Croce. Outside the convent compound,
don’t forget to take a look at the leather goods of the Scuola del Cuoio
di Santa Croce (see “Shopping the Local Stores,” later in this chapter).
Have lunch at the Osteria del Caffè Italiano (see “Dining Out,” earlier in
this chapter). In the afternoon, head for Palazzo Pitti and the Giardino
di Boboli. End your day with a stroll and dinner in Oltrarno, perhaps at
Cavolo Nero (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter).
Shopping the Local Stores
With a long tradition of crafts, Florence offers some very nice specialty
products, such as leather, fine woven straw, jewelry, embroidered linens
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
208
The outdoor markets of Florence
There are two famous markets in Florence: the leather market San Lorenzo (Piazza
del Mercato Centrale, 1 block north of the Basilica of San Lorenzo) and the straw
market Mercato della Paglia (Via Por Santa Maria, off Ponte Vecchio), which sells
traditional straw goods (hats, chairs, bags) of unique quality — plus a lot of cheap
things mixed in. Both markets are open from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily in summer,
Tuesday through Saturday in winter. They’re good places to shop for T-shirts and small
gifts. Good buys can be had, but don’t expect to pay peanuts: Try to have a fair idea in
your mind of what things are worth and be suspicious of prices that seem too low (the
quality might not be what you think). The leather market of San Lorenzo is held around
the building of the Mercato Centrale, which houses a great food market (see “Fast
food, Florence style,” earlier in this chapter).

and lace, and quality paper products. It’s also a center for casual fash-
ion. Many of these goodies are still available at the historic outdoor mar-
kets, which are fun even if you don’t intend to buy anything.
Remember that all crowded areas, including the outdoor markets, are the
preferred hunting ground for pickpockets and purse-snatchers. Don’t dis-
play your cash too liberally, and keep an eye on your pockets and purse.
Best shopping areas
For elegant shopping, the place to go is Via de’ Tornabuoni, in the centro 
storico near Santa Maria Novella (between Piazzetta degli Antinori and
Piazza di Santa Trinità). This street is at the heart of the ritzy shopping
district that includes Via Strozzi and Via della Vigna Nuova (both off
Via de’ Tornabuoni); you find all the big names of Italian fashion here,
such as Ferragamo (Via Tornabuoni 16), Loro Piano (Via della Vigna
Nuova 37r), and Giorgio Armani (Via della Vigna Nuova 51r), plus a
selection of reliable but expensive boutiques. Other stylish boutiques
line the Lungarno Corsini (take a left from Via della Vigna Nuova and
continue along the river); here you find the luxury linen purveyor Pratesi
(see later in this section), among other nice smaller shops. This shopping
district extends east, all the way to Via Roma, Piazza della Repubblica,
Via del Corso, Via dei Calzaiuoli, and Via Calimala off the Ponte Vecchio.
You see lots of real-life stores here, including the Italian-style department
stores La Rinascente (Piazza della Repubblica 1; % 055-219113), which
sells mostly clothes and housewares, and COIN (Via dei Calzaiuoli 56r;
% 055-280531).
What to look for and where to find it
Retail shops are generally open Monday from 4 to 7:30 p.m., Tuesday
through Saturday from 9 or 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 7:30 p.m. As in all
Italian cities, many shops shut down for the month of August, but depart-
ment stores don’t — and are sometimes open during the lunch break as
well. During high season, a few stores might be open on Monday mornings
and Sundays.
Embroidery and linens
Cirri (Via Por Santa Maria; % 055-2396593; Bus: B to Ponte Vecchio) is
a good place for Florentine embroideries, but they don’t come cheap.
Pratesi (Lungarno Corsini 32–34r; % 055-211327; www.pratesi.com;
Bus: D) is the place to go for beautifully crafted luxury linens of all kinds.
Housewares and accessories
Controluce (Via della Vigna Nuova 89r; % 055-2398871; Bus: 6, 11, 36,
or 37 to Tornabuoni) has a beautiful assortment of designer lamps and
accessories. Emporium (Via Guicciardini 122r; % 055-212646; Bus: D to
Pitti) is good for a variety of stylish accessories. Viceversa (Via Ricasoli
53r; % 055-2398281; Bus: C or 6 to Santissima Annunziata) is a great
place for browsing and discovering neat gift ideas.
Chapter 13: Florence 209

Jewelry
Befani e Tai (Via delle Terme 9; % 055-287825; Bus: B) is a reputable
goldsmith shop that sells both antiques and special-order jewelry.
Leather products
Beltrami (Via de’ Tornabuoni 48r; % 055-287779; Bus 6, 11, 36, or 37 to
Tornabuoni) is the place to go for beautiful leather accessories, including
shoes, bags, and luggage. The Beltrami Outlet (Via de’ Panzani 1, near the
church of Santa Maria Novella; % 055-212661; Bus: A, 1, 6, 11, 36, or 37 to
SMN) offers last season’s inventory at a discount. For gloves, head straight
to Madova Gloves (Via Guicciardini 1r; % 055-2396526; www.madova.
com; Bus: D to Pitti), which is actually a traditional glovemaker’s work-
shop. Scuola del Cuoio di Santa Croce (Santa Croce’s Leather School;
Piazza Santa Croce, enter from the church’s right transept; % 055-
244533; www.leatherschool.it; Bus: A to Piazza Santa Croce) is your
best bet if you want to know about the ancient art of leather embossing.
The beautifully crafted goods don’t come cheap, though.
Marble and stone inlay
Le Pietre nell’Arte (Piazza Duomo 36r; % 055-212587; Bus: A) is the
showroom of a talented father-and-son duo turning out collector-quality
items. Pitti Mosaici (Piazza Pitti 23r; % 055-282127; Bus: D to Pitti) is
one of the few traditional craftsmen left in Florence who specialize in
this art form.
Stationery and paper goods
Giulio Giannini & Figlio (Piazza Pitti 37r; % 055-212621; Bus: D to Pitti)
is a historic paper provider that has specialized in marbleized goods
since the 19th century. You’ll find an excellent choice of stationery here.
J. Pineider (Piazza della Signoria 13r; % 055-284655; Bus: B; also at Via
de’ Tornabuoni 76; % 055-211605; Bus: 6, 11, 36, or 37), opened in 1774,
has supplied paper to many royal figures.
Living It Up After Dark
Nightlife in Florence tends to be a lot more provincial than in bigger
cities like Rome and Milan. Check at the tourist office (p. 213), or at the

Ponte Vecchio’s gold
It is commonly assumed that Ponte Vecchio is the place to go for gold jewelry: Indeed,
in this area, you will find one jewelry shop after the next, but all with pretty much the
same merchandise. The prices are no longer great and it’s difficult to find something
original — perhaps after 500 years and a trillion tourists, the street has gotten a tad stale.

Boxoffice (Via Alamanni 39; % 055-210804; www.boxoffice.it) to find
out what’s on.
The performing arts
Several churches in town present evening concerts, mainly in the fall.
The most popular are the concerts of the Florentine Chamber Orchestra
(% 055-783374; www.orcafi.it) in the Orsanmichele church. The
season runs March through October; tickets are available at the box
office (Via Luigi Alamanni 39, by Fortezza de Basso; % 055-210804) or
online at www.boxol.it.
In May, Florence blossoms with music — it’s the month of Italy’s oldest
music festival, Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (% 800-112211 or 055-213535;
Fax: 055-2779410; reservations accepted starting in Sept). Tickets are
also sold online at www.maggiofiorentino.com; they range from 20€
to 155€ ($32–$248). Continuing until the end of June, this concert and
dance series includes famous performers and world premieres. The final
concert, held in the Giardino di Boboli, is a magical experience. At the
center of the festival is the Teatro Comunale (Corso Italia 16; % 055-
213535; Tues–Fri 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.–1 p.m.), which also has a
regular program of ballet and opera at other times of the year.
Teatro Verdi (Via Ghibellina 99; % 055-212320; www.teatroverdi
firenze.it), is home to Orchestra della Toscana (www.orchestra
dellatoscana.it) and also offers prestigious dance and classical
music performances.
Bars, pubs, and clubs
The best way to enjoy Florentine nights is to join the locals for the ever
popular aperitivo: Sit for a drink in one of the trendy bars along the
Lungarni, the riverside promenades. Oltrarno is also popular for its
bars, pubs, and clubs. The oldest caffè in town is Gilli (Piazza della
Repubblica 39r/Via Roma 1r; % 055-213896; Bus: A to Orsanmichele),
which dates back to the 18th century and boasts both a great location
and elegant décor. Giacosa (Via de’ Tornabuoni 83r; % 055-2396226;
Bus: 6, 11, 36, or 37 to Tornabuoni; Closed Sun) is known for its drinks,
particularly the Negroni (the ancestor of the Italian pre-dinner aperi-
tivo), which apparently was invented here by Mr. Negroni and his
barman. The city’s hotel bars are popular with the elegant crowd, who
frequent the Savoy (Piazza della Repubblica 7; % 055-27351), the
Donatello Bar at the Westin-Excelsior (Piazza Ognissanti 3; %
055-264201), the Lungarno (Borgo San Jacopo 14r; % 055-27261), and
the Fusion Bar (Gallery Hotel, Vicolo dell’Oro 5; % 055-27263).
Named in honor of that drink, the Negroni Florence Bar (Via de’ Renai
17r, off Ponte delle Grazie in Oltrarno; % 055-243647) becomes a lively
spot in the evening, with music almost every night; it stays open until 
2 a.m.
Chapter 13: Florence 211

The chef-owner of the popular restaurant Cibrèo has opened Teatro del
Sale (Via de’ Macci 111r; % 055-2001492; Open: Tues–Sat 9 p.m. to mid-
night), a pleasant club offering a tasty buffet-dinner-and-show combina-
tion; performances range from jazz to poetry readings. The historic Jazz
Club (Via Nuova de’ Caccini 3; % 055-2479700; Open: Mon–Sat 9 p.m.–
2 a.m.) features live music every night.
Florence has been swept up in a passion for Irish pubs. The beer is origi-
nal, but the atmosphere a little less so. Try the Fiddler’s Elbow (Piazza
Santa Maria Novella 7r; % 055-215056; Bus: A, 1, 6, 11, 36, or 37), a suc-
cessful branch of the Italian chain, or the Dublin Pub (Via Faenza 27r;
% 055-293049; Bus: A to Orsanmichele).
Discos
Yab (Via Sassetti 5r; % 055-215160) is open October through May,
Monday and Thursday through Saturday from 7:30 p.m. to 4 a.m.; it also
serves dinner. Universale (Via Pisana 77r, Oltrarno, between Via di Monte
Oliveto and Viale B. Gozzoli; % 055-221122; www.universalefirenze.
it; Bus: 6) is open September through May only, Thursday through Sunday 
nights. The cover ranges from 11€ to 18€ ($18–$29). Another hot spot is
Jaragua (Via Erta Canina 12r, Oltrarno, off Viale Michelangiolo; % 055-
2343600), a disco and tropical bar with plenty of Caribbean and Latin
music, free dance classes, and more. It’s open daily from 9:30 p.m. to 
3 a.m.; no cover.
Gay and lesbian bars
Tabasco (Piazza Santa Cecilia 3r, by Piazza della Signoria; % 055-
213000; Bus: B) is Florence’s — and Italy’s — oldest gay dance club,
housed in a 15th-century building near Piazza della Signoria. The 
crowd is mostly men in their 20s and 30s. The dance floor is downstairs,
while a small video room and piano bar are on the upper level. Open
Tuesday through Saturday from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m.; the cover is 8€ to 16€
($13–$26). Tabasco owns two other venues in town: Silver Stud (Via
della Fornace 9; % 055-688466), a cruising bar, and Florence Baths
(Via Guelfa 93r; % 055-216050), a gay sauna.
Crisco (Via San Egidio 43r; % 055-2480580) is the leading gay bar in town;
it also owns the Tin Box Club (Via dell’Oriuolo 19r; % 055-2466387).
In summer at Discoteca Flamingo (Via del Pandolfini 26r, near Piazza
Santa Croce; % 055-243356; Bus: A), the crowd is international. Thursday
through Saturday nights, it’s a mixed gay/lesbian party; the rest of the
week, it’s men only. Open Sunday through Thursday from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.,
Friday and Saturday from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. The bar is open year-round;
the disco September through June only. Cover, including the first drink,
is 6.20€ ($9.90) Sunday through Thursday; 8€ to 10€ ($13–$16) Friday
and Saturday.

Restrooms
The city of Florence maintains a few public
restrooms at strategic points — the SMN
train station, Via Filippina corner with Via
Borgognona, Mercato Centrale (market) —
as well as others that are open only in high
season. Your best bet is to go to a cafe dis-
playing the “Courtesy Point” logo; these
have an agreement with the city to offer
such service. Better yet, because Florence
is full of museums, use one while you’re
inside. Also a good bet are department
stores, such as the Rinascente in Piazza
della Repubblica.
Safety
Florence is quite safe; your only major wor-
ries are pickpockets and purse-snatchers
due to the huge concentration of tourists.
Avoid deserted areas after dark (such as
behind the train station and the Cascine
Park) and exercise normal urban caution.
Smoking
In 2005, Italy passed a law outlawing 
smoking in most public places. Smoking is
allowed only where there is a separate, ven-
tilated area for nonsmokers. If you want to
smoke at your table, call beforehand to
make sure the restaurant or cafe you intend
to visit offers a smoking area.
Taxes
See Chapter 5 for information on IVA (Value
Added Tax).
Taxi
For a radio taxi, call % 055-4390, 055-4798,
055-4242, or 055-4499.
Transit Info
For air travel, call the airport at % 055-
373498 or 050-500707. For city buses, call 
% 800 424500 in Italy or 055-56501, or go
online to www.ataf.net. For out-of-town
buses, call SITA (% 800-373760). For 
trains, contact Trenitalia (% 892021;
www.trenitalia.it).
Weather Updates
Your best bet is the news on TV. (There’s no
phone number for weather forecasts in Italy,
as there is in the U.S.)

Chapter 14
Northern Tuscany and 
the Cinque Terre
In This Chapter
 Exploring city ramparts in Lucca
 Gaping at the Leaning Tower in Pisa
 Discovering fishing villages in the Cinque Terre
N
orthern Tuscany is an area rich in history and natural beauty. Near
the Tyrrhenian Sea, you find Pisa, with its justly famous Leaning
Tower; a little farther inland is Lucca, one of Italy’s most delightful
medieval walled cities. No trip to the area is complete without a glimpse
of the Italian Riviera, especially the Cinque Terre, the five picturesque
villages clinging to abrupt cliffs above a protected marine area.
You need a minimum of a day each for these destinations, and Pisa
makes an excellent base for exploring the area. Alternatively, you can
easily visit any of the destinations in this area as a day trip from
Florence.
Lucca
The English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote “The Baths of Lucca” to
celebrate the unspoiled medieval town surrounded by powerful red ram-
parts. Lucca may have grown a bit, but the effect is still unchanged.
Lucca is an easy side trip from Florence, and a day will be enough for a
full visit. It’s also a wonderful place to spend a couple of days leisurely
strolling the walls and enjoying an opera or a concert, especially during
the September festival (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in
this section).

Getting there
Lucca is 64km (40 miles) west of Florence and just 22km (14 miles) north
of Pisa. If you are arriving by plane into Pisa’s airport (see later in this
chapter), or into Florence (see Chapter 13), a shuttle bus (% 055-
363041 or 055-351061; www.lazzi.it) will transport you to Lucca
(about 30 minutes from Pisa and one hour from Florence). Tickets are
for sale at the information offices in the arrivals hall. The same company
also offers bus connections from downtown Pisa and Florence.
The area is well served by train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it).
Trains for Lucca leave Florence every hour; the one-hour trip costs
about 5€ ($8). Trains from Pisa travel as frequently, and the trip is only
20 to 30 minutes and costs 2.50€ ($4). Lucca’s train station (% 0583-
467013) is on Piazzale Ricasoli, off Porta San Pietro (St. Peter’s Gate) 
on the south side of the walls, within walking distance of the historic 
district.
By car, take autostrada A11 from Florence and exit at Lucca. From Pisa,
take the SS12. Parking lots are near most of the six city gates — only
locals are allowed to drive inside — and town buses connect each of
them as well as the rail station to the center of town. Bus tickets are for
sale at most tobacconists and newsstands for 0.90€ ($1.40).
Spending the night
Lucca is a small town, with only two luxury hotels: Locanda L’Elisa (Via
Nuova per Pisa 1952, off SS12; % 0583-379737; www.locandalelisa.it),
only 3km (2 miles) south of the town walls, with a splendid swimming
pool, and Hotel Noblesse (Via Sant’Anastasio 23; % 0583-440275; Fax:
0583-490506; www.hotelnoblesse.it), a new addition in the historic
district. The town’s mid-range hotels offer good quality for the money,
though.
Hotel Ilaria
$$
Via Santa Croce
Tasteful guest rooms, breakfast on a quiet terrace overlooking a beautiful
park, free use of bicycles, a parking garage on the premises — all right in
the center of Lucca. What else do you want, discounted prices at the best
restaurants in town? You got it: The management of Hotel Ilaria has an
agreement with three establishments, including the well-recommended Il
Giglio and Buca di Sant’Antonio (see “Dining locally,” later in this chapter).
Beautifully renovated, this elegant hotel is housed in the former stables of
the Villa Bottini and overlooks the villa’s park. Accommodations are spa-
cious, with modern furniture and good-sized bathrooms. Some rooms are
accessible to people with mobility challenges.
See map p. 219. Via del Fosso 26, off Via Santa Croce. % 0583-47615. Fax:
0583-991961. www.hotelilaria.com. Free parking. 230€ ($368) double. Rates
include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.

Piazza San Michele
Opened in 2000, this hotel offers luxurious accommodations right in the
center of town. The 12th-century palace was restored according to the
style of the original furnishings and decorations. Guest rooms are magnif-
icently done in Luccan aristocratic style — featuring much gilded furni-
ture, stuccoes, and damask fabrics. The bathrooms are outfitted with
marble and other local stones; some have Jacuzzis as well.
See map p. 219. Via Santa Giustina 48, near Piazza San Michele. % 0583-583571. Fax:

Piccolo Hotel Puccini
$
Piazza San Michele
In the heart of the historic center is this romantic hotel, offering moderate-
sized, cozily furnished rooms at low rates. Just across from the house where
its namesake was born, Hotel Puccini is based in a small 15th-century
palazzo. Though this popular spot lacks an elevator and air-conditioning, it
is always full; so book well in advance.
See map p. 219. Via di Poggio 9, off Piazza San Michele. % 0583-55421. Fax:

($144) double. AE, DC, MC, V.
Dining locally
Lucca has fewer restaurants than you would expect, but most provide a
decent meal — you are in Tuscany, after all — although sometimes it’s
overpriced. Those listed below are some of the best spots in town. See
Chapter 2 for more on Tuscan cuisine.
Buca di Sant’Antonio
$
Piazza San Michele
LUCCAN
Lucca’s best restaurant boasts excellent food at very reasonable prices.
The cuisine is strictly traditional — you wouldn’t expect any less from a
place that’s been around since 1782. The capretto garfagnino allo spiedo
(spit-roasted baby goat from the Garfagnana area) is a classic, as are the
tortelli lucchesi al sugo (ravioli with a meat sauce). The remarkable atmos-
phere is characterized by a labyrinthine succession of small rooms deco-
rated with musical instruments and copper pots.
See map p. 219. Via della Cervia 3, near Piazza San Michele. % 0583-55881. www.
bucadisantantonio.com. Reservations necessary. Secondi: 13€–14€
($21–$22). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Tues–Sun 12:30–3:30 p.m., Tues–Sat 7:30–11 p.m.
Closed 3 weeks in July.

Il Giglio
$
Piazza Napoleone
LUCCAN
Less formal than Antico Caffè delle Mura, Il Giglio offers excellent Luccan
specialties and a friendly atmosphere. Dine indoors or, in pleasant weather,
alfresco. Try the famed zuppa di farro (thick spelt soup) or the homemade
tortelli al ragù. You can never go wrong with the rabbit or the roasted lamb
as a secondi.

Piazza San Michele
FISH/LUCCAN
You always get a fine seafood meal here — but you may not receive the
service to match. The cuisine mixes tradition with innovation, and the
offerings vary with the daily catch. More creative dishes such as tortelloni
neri di crostacei con asparagi e pomodorini (black round seafood ravioli
with asparagus and cherry tomatoes) and marinated salmon in a pink-
pepper sauce are offered side by side with the classics, like the excellent
frittura di paranza (fried small fish) — one of our favorites. A special chil-
dren’s menu offers simpler dishes with fewer spices.
See map p. 219. Corte San Lorenzo 1/2, near Piazza San Michele. % 0583-316116.
Reservations necessary. Secondi: 16–21 ($26–$34). AE, DC, V. Open: Thurs–Mon
noon to 2:30 p.m.; Wed–Mon 7:30–10:30 p.m. Closed Jan–Feb.
Exploring Lucca
To fully enjoy the medieval flavor of the town, the best way to explore is
on foot. The free city map available at the tourist office in Piazzale Verdi
(see “Fast Facts: Lucca,” later in this chapter) is all you need to explore
Lucca.
You can buy a combination ticket that includes the Duomo, with its sac-
risty and museum, and the church and baptistery of Santi Giovanni e

The red ramparts of Lucca
Lucca’s architecture speaks of its past glory: An important city under the Romans, it
later became a republic, fighting for its independence against Pisa. It was — and still
is — famous for the works produced in its music school, founded in A.D. 787. A famous
student of the school was Giacomo Puccini, who gave the world some of its greatest
operas, such as Madama Butterfly and Tosca.

The top attractions
Duomo (Cattedrale di San Martino)
Piazza San Martino
Gracing a pretty medieval square, this cathedral is a perfect example of
Luccan-Pisan Romanesque architecture. Striped with green and white
marble, the facade is decorated with three tiers of polychromed columns.
Walk behind the church to admire the imposing apse, surrounded by a
small park. The interior is Gothic, divided into three naves, and contains
several fine pieces, such as Tintoretto’s Last Supper over the altar in the
third chapel to the right, and a famous relic: the Volto Santo, a wooden cru-
cifix showing the real face of Christ, said to have been miraculously carved
(the marble housing is by Matteo Civitali, the best 15th-century Luccan
artist). The most important art is in the sacristy: Ghirlandaio’s Madonna
with Saints and Jacopo della Quercia’s funeral monument to Ilaria del
Carretto Guinigi, one of the finest examples of 15th-century Italian sculp-
ture. Ilaria was the first wife of Paolo Guinigi, ruler of Lucca, and he had the
monument built to commemorate her death (she died at 26 after only two
years of marriage). The adjacent museum contains art once housed in the
cathedral, such as Matteo Civitali’s masterly carved choir. Count on about
an hour for your visit, including sacristy and museum.

Palazzo Mansi and Pinacoteca Nazionale
Porta San Donato
This lavish 17th-century palace built for the Mansi, a powerful Luccan
family, is decorated with some of its original furnishings and frescoes. Of
special note are the Music Room (Salone della Musica) and Nuptial Room
(Camera degli Sposi). The collection in the pinacoteca (picture gallery)
includes Italian and foreign artists from the Renaissance to the 18th cen-
tury, such as Pontormo, Andrea del Sarto, Veronese, and Domenichino.
Allow about an hour here.

lier. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
San Frediano
Piazza Anfiteatro
Built in the early 12th century, this church has a simple facade decorated
with a beautiful Byzantine-style mosaic depicting the ascension of Christ,
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
222

as well as a soaring bell tower. Inside are noteworthy Jacopo della Quercia
carvings in the left nave’s last chapel, a 12th- and 13th-century mosaic
floor around the main altar, and a beautifully carved Romanesque font at
the right nave’s entrance. Allow about 30 minutes here.
See map p. 219. Piazza San Frediano. % 0583-493627. Admission: Free. Open:
Mon–Sat 9 a.m. to noon and 3–5 p.m.; Sun 9–11:30 a.m. and 3–6 p.m. Visits are not
allowed during Mass.
San Giovanni church and archaeological excavations
Piazza San Martino
The 12th-century church of Santi Giovanni e Reparata was partly rebuilt in
the 17th century. Together with the adjacent baptistery, adorned with a
Gothic dome, they are a lovely sight. However, the real attraction here is
the excavations under the church that take you back in time. Underneath
the later constructions, you can see the remains of a previous basilica,
beneath which are the remains of a paleo-Christian church, itself built over
a Roman temple, which was built atop a more ancient Roman house. The
excavations are accessible to the public via guided tour; it’s best to make
a reservation in advance. Expect to spend about 40 minutes here.
See map p. 219. Piazza San Giovanni. % 0583-490-530 for reservations. www.museo
cattedralelucca.it. Admission: 2.50 ($4). Open: Nov 3–Mar 9 Sat–Sun 10
a.m.–5 p.m.; Mar 10–Nov 2 daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. Closed Jan 1 morning, Easter morn-
ing, Dec 25.
San Michele in Foro
Piazza San Michele
Probably one of the greatest examples of Luccan-Pisan Romanesque archi-
tecture, the church of San Michele was built between the 12th and 14th
centuries. It derives its name from the fact that it was built over the ancient
Roman city’s Forum. The facade is graced by four tiers of small columns
and is decorated with different colors of marble, while the apse powerfully
illustrates the Pisan influence. Inside is a beautiful Filippino Lippi paint-
ing, representing the saints Sebastian, Jerome, Helen, and Roch. Piazza San
Michele, which surrounds this wonderful church, is itself lovely. Allow
about 30 minutes for your visit.
See map p. 219. Piazza San Michele. % 0583-48459. Admission: Free. Open: Daily
winter 9 a.m. to noon and 3–5 p.m.; summer until 6 p.m.
Villa Guinigi
Porta Elisa
Formerly the residence of the Guinigi family — Lucca’s rulers during the
Renaissance — this elegant villa has been transformed into a museum. You
can see some of the original furnishings dating back to the Renaissance as
well as an interesting collection of Lucchese artwork, including paintings
and sculptures from the 13th to the 18th centuries, along with some
ancient Roman and Etruscan artifacts. Allow 40 minutes here.

More cool things to see and do
Lucca is more than just churches and palaces. Herewith, more to
explore:
 Lucca is a city of music, and you find that one musical festival or
another is going on almost throughout the year. October through
February is the opera season at the historic Teatro del Giglio (%
0583-46531 or 0583-467521 for tickets; www.teatrodelgiglio.it),
where Puccini performed his works. If you’re in town between April
and December, you can enjoy the concerts of the Lucca in Musica
festival, held in the Basilica of San Frediano and in the Auditorium
di San Romano. A good time to visit is during the Settembre
Lucchese, when a variety of events liven the city, including many
concerts. Another great musical event is the Sagra Musicale
Lucchese (organized by Cappella Musicale Santa Cecilia; %
0583-48421), which takes place between April and June, when con-
certs of religious and classical music are performed in several of
the city’s churches. For a schedule of concerts, check with the
tourist office (see “Fast Facts: Lucca,” later in this chapter).
 Overlooking the whole city, the Passeggiata delle Mura — the
promenade built on top of the city walls — is one attraction
enjoyed by visitors and Luccans alike. Erected between 1544 and
1650, this is the third and final set of city walls built by the inde-
pendent Republic of Lucca (the first set was built in Roman times in
the second or third century A.D., the second between the 11th and
13th century). In fact, they’re Europe’s only practically undamaged
set of defense ramparts from the Renaissance — perhaps thanks to
their monumental scale, measuring 35m (115 ft.) thick at the base
and soaring 12m (40 ft.) high, and with baluardi (projecting defense
works) at 11 different points. The tops of the walls were trans-
formed into a tree-lined 4.2km (21⁄2-mile) public promenade in the
early 19th century, with access ramps at 9 of the 11 baluardi.
Do as the Luccans do and rent a bicycle at the city-run stand
(Casermetta San Donato, near the city walls in Piazzale Verdi; 
% 0583-442944). Prices range from about 6 ($9.60) per hour to
about 20 ($32) per day.
 Though not as numerous as the ones in San Gimignano, Lucca’s
medieval towers are still quite special: A full garden with real trees
tops Torre Guinigi (Via Sant’ Andrea, off Via Guinigi; % 0583-
316846; Admission: 4/$6.40; Open: Nov–Mar 9 a.m.–5:30 p.m.,
Apr–May 9 a.m.–8 p.m., June–Oct 9 a.m. to midnight). The Torre
delle Ore (Via Fillungo, between Vicolo San Carlo and Via
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
224

Sant’Andrea; % 0583-316846; Admission: 3.50/$5.60; Open: Nov

Mar 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Apr–Oct 10 a.m.–7 p.m.) has marked the pass-
ing of time since the 14th century. You can buy a 5 ($8) combina-
tion ticket for both towers.
 The birthplace of musician Giacomo Puccini has been turned into a
museum: Casa Natale di Giacomo Puccini (Corte San Lorenzo 9, off
Via di Poggio; % 0583-584028; Admission: 3/$4.80; Open:
Oct–Dec and Mar–May Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–6 p.m.,
June–Sept daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.). Note: At press time the museum
was closed indefinitely for restoration.

581305).

Pisa
Pisa is much more than its famous Leaning Tower: Its medieval alleys
and buildings overlooking the curving Arno are little visited, yet offer
some of Italy’s nicest riverside views.
You will not need more than three or four hours to visit Pisa’s most
famous attractions, and you can easily do so on a day trip from Florence,
but you would miss much: Pisa deserves exploration and knows how to
reward its visitors. If you have the time, we recommend spending at
least one night. Pisa also makes an excellent base for exploring the many
other destinations in northern Tuscany, since it has a good selection of
moderately priced hotels and restaurants and a lively cultural life.
Getting there
Only 3km (2 miles) south of town, Pisa’s Aeroporto Galileo Galilei
(% 050-849111; www.pisa-airport.com) is Tuscany’s main airport,
with daily flights from most major towns in Italy and the rest of Europe.
From the airport, you can take a taxi to the center of town; it will cost
you about 7 ($11) and take about ten minutes. You can also take the
train to Pisa Centrale rail station, a five-minute ride for 1 ($1.60); trains
depart the airport about every hour. If you’re driving, rental-car coun-
ters are at arrivals, inside the airport. Once you have your car, just
follow the signs for PISA CENTRO.
From other points in Italy, the train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) is
an excellent way to get to Pisa. The station, Pisa Centrale (% 050-
41385), is about an hour from Florence and three and a half hours from
Rome. Trains run about every half-hour from Florence and every hour
from Rome; the trip costs about 5 ($8) and 24 ($38), respectively.
From the station, take shuttle bus A across the Arno to the Leaning
Tower.
If you’re arriving by car, you’re able to drive the 96km (60 miles) from
Florence in about an hour or less. From Florence, take autostrada A11 to
Lucca and follow the signs for A12 toward Livorno; watch for the exit for
Pisa shortly after the junction with A12 South. From Florence, you can
also follow the signs for Empoli-Livorno to reach Pisa by the more direct
but slower superstrada (small highway). Three large free parking lots are
located near the center of Pisa, just north of the town’s walls; each is
linked to the center by bus service (electric or otherwise), which costs
0.95 ($1.50) per ticket. The lots are on Via Pietrasantina, only a few
hundred yards from the Duomo (Bus: A); Via di Pratale, a few hundred
yards from the Via del Brennero (Bus: 7); and Via del Brennero, near Via
Alberto Paparelli and Porta Zeno, 1km (2⁄3 mile) from the Duomo (Bus: E);
this last lot is closed on Wednesday and Saturday from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.
because of an open-air market. Paid parking can be found at Piazza dei
Miracoli and in a lot on Via Cammeo for 1.50 ($2.40) per hour, the
same rate as metered street parking.

Within walking distance of both Campo dei Miracoli and the Arno river,
this new hotel offers quiet accommodations at a moderate price. It’s
housed in a historic building — nothing less than the study of Galileo
Galilei. Today, the completely renovated hotel has pleasant guest rooms,
with whitewashed walls, vibrant fabrics, and simple yet stylish furnish-

bathrooms alike are large and comfortable. The garden is the perfect place
to have breakfast in nice weather. Ask about specials when you make your

Lungarno–Ponte di Mezzo
This hotel, right on the Arno and within walking distance of major attrac-
tions, is about old-fashioned elegance, romantic views, and friendly serv-
ice. Opened in 1839 as Pisa’s first hotel, it is still run by the same family. 
It occupies several medieval buildings, including the remains of a tenth-
century tower; as a result, guest rooms differ greatly from one another —
some have frescoed ceilings, while others are more simply decorated —
but all are furnished with antiques and kept extremely clean. If you’re plan-
ning to use the garage, you must reserve that ahead of time as well.

Dining locally
We love eating in Pisa: It is very difficult to have a bad meal. Restaurants
and trattorie are plentiful and excellent. Food in Pisa includes typical
Tuscan fare (see Chapter 2), such as ribollita (here called zuppa pisana,
or Pisan soup — old rivalries die hard) and, because the sea is nearby,
lots of seafood.

Piazza Solferino
PISAN/SEAFOOD
Near the edge of the historic district is Pisa’s best traditional restaurant
and a local favorite. In a former 15th-century slaughterhouse (macello), it
nonetheless offers a cozy atmosphere, with beamed ceilings and dark
wood floors. This family-run place serves up traditional Pisan recipes that
are reinterpreted with genius to produce delectable results: homemade
ravioli stuffed with fish and served with a shrimp sauce; delicious gnoc-
chi with pesto and shrimp; stuffed rabbit with creamy truffle sauce; sea
bass with onion sauce . . . we can’t wait to go back!

A picnic in Pisa
The food market on Piazza delle Vettovaglie, a few steps north of Ponte di Mezzo, is a
wonderful sight. Held here since the Middle Ages, this lively affair takes place Monday
through Saturday from 7 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Food producers from the countryside offer their
specialties for sale — fresh vegetables and fruits, Tuscan bread, cured meats, and all
the fixings — so you can get the makings of a great picnic to enjoy along the riverbank.

that’s the quietest; all have beamed ceilings and whitewashed walls deco-
rated with photographs and copper utensils. The menu is based on the
traditional local cuisine. We definitely recommend the homemade pap-
pardelle with hare sauce, the baccalà coi porri (codfish with fresh toma-
toes and leeks), and the wild-boar stew.

One of the liveliest restaurants in Pisa, this osteria offers simple and tasty
fare at moderate prices. The two small, bright dining rooms are a perfect
background for the food, which delicately mixes tradition with innovation.
We loved the gnocchi with zucchini flowers and pistachio nuts, the zuppa
Pisana, and the tagliata di manzo ai funghi pioppini con cannellini, a per-
fect steak served with wild mushrooms and white beans.

The top attractions
Campo dei Miracoli, also called Piazza del Duomo, is Pisa’s monumental
piazza. Built in medieval times abutting the city walls, it is carpeted with
perfect green grass — an ideal background for the carved marble mas-
terpieces in the monumental compound.
Baptistery
Campo dei Miracoli
Standing across from the Duomo, the Baptistery was built between the
12th and 14th centuries, and its architecture reflects the passage from the
Romanesque to the Gothic style during those years. It is the largest bap-
tistery in Italy and is actually taller — counting the statue on top — than
the famous Leaning Tower. The richly decorated exterior was once further
embellished with statues by the local artist Giovanni Pisano, but many
have been removed to the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo (see later) for safe-
keeping. Inside are a unique hexagonal pulpit, carved by Nicola Pisano
(father of Giovanni) between 1255 and 1260, and a baptismal font, carved
and inlaid by Guido Bigarelli da Como. Allow about 30 minutes for your
visit.

Camposanto Monumentale (Cemetery)
Campo dei Miracoli
On the edge of Piazza del Duomo stands the elegantly decorated wall of
what must have been the world’s most beautiful cemetery. Designed by
Giovanni di Simone and built in 1278, it was filled with holy dirt from
Golgotha (Calvary) in Palestine — where Christ was crucified — that was
brought back by ship after a Crusade. Decorated with splendid frescoes
inside, it was the burial ground for Pisa’s constables, who had their tombs
richly decorated with sarcophagi, statues, and marble bas-reliefs. During
the 1944 U.S. bombing of Pisa to dislodge the Nazis, the cemetery’s loggia
roof caught fire, and most of the magnificent frescoes were destroyed.
Parts of the frescoes that were salvaged are exhibited inside, along with
photos showing the Camposanto before the destruction. The Museo delle
Sinopie nearby (see later in this section) holds the preliminary frescoes.
Allow at least 20 minutes for your visit.

Duomo (Cattedrale di Santa Maria Assunta)
Campo dei Miracoli
The center of Campo dei Miracoli is occupied by the magnificent cathe-
dral, Pisa’s Duomo, built by Buschetto in the 11th century. The facade, with
four layers of open-air arches diminishing in size as they ascend, is actu-
ally from the 13th century. In 1595, the cathedral was heavily damaged by
a fire that destroyed three of the four bronze exterior doors and much of
the art inside. The cathedral was restored during the 16th century, inte-
grating some baroque elements. Still original is the monumental bronze
door at the south entrance (Porta San Ranieri), cast by Bonanno Pisano in
1180; the Andrea del Sarto painting of Sant’Agnese at the choir entrance;
the 13th-century mosaic of Christ Pantocrator; and the Cimabue San
Giovanni Evangelista in the apse. The polygonal pulpit carved by Giovanni
Pisano was restored in 1926 when the original pieces were found; they had
been put in storage after the fire in the 16th century. Plan to spend about
40 minutes here.

idays open for visits only after 1 p.m. Last admission 30 minutes earlier.
Leaning Tower (Campanile)
Campo dei Miracoli
Behind the Duomo is the famous tower, actually built as the Duomo’s cam-
panile (bell tower). Started in 1173 by the architect Bonanno, this beauti-
ful eight-story carved masterpiece, with open-air arches matching those
on the Duomo, was finally finished in 1360. It started leaning almost from
the beginning, so the Pisans stopped construction in 1185. In 1275, they
started again and built up to the belfry, cleverly curving the structure as
they went to compensate for the lean. The construction halted again, until
1360, when the belfry was added. Later architects and engineers studied
the problem — the shifting alluvial subsoil, saturated with water — but
couldn’t devise a solution (one attempt to fix it made it lean more). In 1990,
the lean became so bad — 4.5m (15 ft.) out of plumb — that the tower was
closed to the public. Two years later, a belt of steel cables was placed
around the base, and in 1993, the bells in the belfry were stilled to prevent
vibrations from shaking the tower. Finally, after a $24-million restoration,
engineers succeeded in reducing the tower’s lean by 38cm (15 in.). It
reopened in December 2001.
Your ticket is valid only for the time stamped on it. If you reserved in
advance, you must pick up your printed voucher from ticket booth
number 2 at either the tower or Museo delle Sinopie at least 30 minutes
before your reserved slot.
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
232

The tower has no elevator, and access is through the original — and very
narrow — staircase. It’s impossible to stop or turn around during the 
physically difficult 300-step ascent, and outdoor portions make the climb
psychologically taxing as well. Anybody suffering from vertigo, claustro-
phobia, or a heart condition should not attempt it. Children under 8 are
not allowed in the tower, and youth under 18 are allowed only when
accompanied by an adult. You are also required to hold the hand of your
children aged 8 to 12 during the climb.

Museo delle Sinopie
Campo dei Miracoli
On the other side of Piazza del Duomo, across from the Camposanto, this
museum houses the sinopie (preparatory sketches for frescoes) found
under the charred remains of the frescoes in the Camposanto after the fire
that destroyed most of them. Each sinopia faces an engraving that shows
what the Camposanto frescoes looked like before their destruction. It is
very well done, allowing visitors to re-experience what the magnificent
Camposanto must have looked like before 1944. More reproductions are in
the Museo dell’Opera (see below). Allow about 30 minutes for your visit.

Chapter 14: Northern Tuscany and the Cinque Terre 233
Galileo Galilei
Born in Pisa in 1564, Galileo was an astronomer, astrologer, and philosopher, and earned
his status as one of the fathers of modern physics. Much of his visible activity involved
watching pendulums and dropping balls of differing weights off the Leaning Tower to
prove that they would hit the ground at the same time. Many people thought he was
nuts, and the church excommunicated (and nearly executed) him for the blasphemy of
suggesting that the universe did not revolve around the earth, but instead the earth
revolved around the sun. In the scientific world, he is considered the father of modern
science, together with Francis Bacon. Among his achievements are several improve-
ments on the telescope and the discovery of the first and second laws of motion.

Museo dell’Opera del Duomo
Campo dei Miracoli
On the south side of the Leaning Tower, this museum is a showcase for all
the original artworks that were removed from the Duomo and the other
monuments on the Campo dei Miracoli for preservation, including the stat-
ues by Giovanni Pisano from the Baptistery (see earlier in this section).
Particularly notable are the 11th-century Islamic bronze of a griffin —
booty from a Crusade — that decorated the Duomo’s cupola before being
replaced by a copy, and Giovanni Pisano’s Madonna col Bambino, carved
from an ivory tusk. Also interesting are the etchings that were prepared
in the 19th century by Carlo Lasinio for the restoration of the frescoes in
the Camposanto (see earlier in this section): Colored by Lasinio’s son,
they’re the best existing record of the frescoes. The museum also holds
the original plans of the Duomo, as well as a collection of ancient artifacts
found on the site when the Duomo was built. Allow about an hour for your
visit.

National Museum of San Matteo
Piazza Mazzini
This important museum should not be overlooked if you are interested in
Italian Renaissance art. Its collection of paintings from the 12th to the 15th
centuries is one of the best in the world, and its sculpture gallery — includ-
ing works from the Middle Ages to the 16th century — is very rich. Some
of the works come from nearby churches, particularly Santa Maria della
Spina (see later), while others are from ecclesiastical buildings farther
away in the town’s territory. Important masterpieces include the 1426
painting San Paolo by Masaccio, two paintings of the Madonna con i Santi
by Ghirlandaio, the sculpture of the Madonna del Latte by Andrea and
Nino Pisano, and sculptures by Donatello. Consider spending one or two
hours at this museum.

Santa Maria della Spina
Ponte Solferino
This small church, which has survived in spite of its dangerous location on
unstable ground near the river bed, is a treasure-trove of marble carvings.
Built on the river shore in 1230 as an oratory, the church was enlarged
during the 14th century and decorated by some of the town’s best artists
of the time. Its foundation was reinforced several times over the centuries,
and in 1871, as a final drastic effort to consolidate the ground on which
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
234

the church was built, the entire structure was taken apart and rebuilt on
a 1.2m-high (4-ft.) base; many of the original sculptures were moved to the
Museo Nazionale di San Matteo and replaced with copies, and the entire
sacristy was destroyed. Yet, it remains one of the most delightful exam-
ples of Tuscan Gothic architecture. The many delicate carvings on the
external walls, as well as the elegant arches and windows and the simple
interior, make a wonderful setting for the sculptural masterpiece by
Andrea and Nino Pisano, the Madonna Della Rosa (1345–48). Allow a half-
hour to explore the church.

More cool things to see and do
 Some of the town celebrations are great fun: A traditional event is
the Gioco del Ponte, held on the last Sunday in June, when teams
from the north and south sides of the Arno fight each other.
Wearing Renaissance costumes, the teams use a decorated 6,300-
kilogram (7-ton) cart to push each other off the Ponte di Mezzo, the
Roman bridge at the center of Pisa. Another celebration is the Festa
di San Ranieri, on June 16th and 17th, held in honor of Pisa’s
patron saint. The Arno is lit with torches all along its length, which
makes for quite a beautiful sight. Contact the tourist office for more
info (see “Fast Facts: Pisa,” later in this chapter).

The maritime republic of Pisa
The origins of Pisa as a powerful entity in the Mediterranean stretch back to Roman
times, when the Italic settlement that existed since 1000 B.C. became a commercial
harbor (in the second century B.C.). The city’s maritime power was realized only in the
11th century, when Pisa became one of the four powerful Italian seafaring republics,
ruling the Mediterranean alongside Venice, Amalfi, and Genoa. Pisa controlled Corsica,
Sardinia, and the Balearic Islands, competing with Genoa for commerce with the Arabs.
Later, the city lost its river access (the water silted up) and its power: In 1284, Genoa
rose to be the dominant power in the Tyrrhenian Sea, while Pisa became a possession
of Florence. During three centuries of splendor, however, the wealth from far-flung com-
merce funded construction of the monumental town you can still admire today.

Guelfa della Cittadella Vecchia (Piazza di Terzanaia; % 055-

ing countryside.
 The best way to fully savor the medieval flavor of Pisa is to take the
Tour Lungarno cruise along the urban portion of the Arno, oper-
ated by the Cooperativa il Navicello (Lungarno Galilei 7; % 050-
540162 or 338-9808867; www.ilnavicello.it). Boats leave from
San Paolo a Ripa d’Arno toward the west edge of the historic dis-
trict, April through November on Saturday, Sunday, and holidays at
11 a.m., noon, 4 p.m., and 5 p.m. (May–Sept also Tues–Sat 3, 4, and
5 p.m.). Tours are by reservation only, the trip lasts about an hour,
and tickets are 5 ($8) per person.
 Pisa has a long tradition of intellectual life — local circles played an
important role during the Risorgimento, the movement that led to
the unification of Italy in the 19th century (see Chapter 2). The
Caffè dell’Ussero (Largo Pacinotti 27; % 050-581100) is where
Pisa’s intellectuals and their famous visitors met and mingled. In
the 15th-century Palazzo Agostini, it makes a delicious ice cream
that you can savor on the terrace by the Arno river or as you stroll
along the promenade.

The Cinque Terre
Traveling north along the coast, you reach the eastern part of the Italian
Riviera, Riviera di Levante. Nestled at the water’s edge and protected by
towering promontories, are five small towns: Monterosso al Mare,
Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore, collectively known as
the Cinque Terre (literally “five lands”).
This national park is a great place to spend time with your kids. The
breathtaking views, the sea, and the swimming and hiking provide a
great respite from the usual cultural attractions.
While it is possible to “do” the Cinque Terre in a day, the area is defi-
nitely worth more time if you can spare it.
Getting there
Auto traffic within the park is limited to residents, but each of the vil-
lages is served by train. There is direct service from Pisa to Riomaggiore
and to Monterosso; and to all of the five towns from La Spezia, on the
local line for Levanto (Trenitalia; % 892021; www.trenitalia.it).
Don’t expect a scenic ride, though, as the route has been carved into the
cliff and most of the trip is inside a tunnel. It will cost about 6 ($9.60)
from Pisa for the 30-minute trip. Electric minibuses connect each train
station with the village harbors, trail heads, and other destinations in
the park.
We like arriving by boat, a magnificent experience affording superb views.
Consorzio Marittimo Golfo dei Poeti (% 0187-732987; www.navigazione
golfodeipoeti.it) runs regular boat service from La Spezia with stops
at four of the five Cinque Terre (no stop in Corniglia). They offer four daily
routes from La Spezia starting at 9:15 a.m.; the last boat leaves Monterosso
at 5 p.m. A day pass costs 23 ($37) adults and 13 ($21) children 6 to 11
(Mon–Fri adults pay only 21/$34).
If you have a car, you have to park it. Your best bet is the ACI Park lot
in La Spezia (Via Crispi 73; % 0187-510545), which will cost you 
only 5 ($8) for the day. The parking lot in Monterosso al Mare 
(% 0187-802050) costs about 10 ($16) per day, but gets full fast in

The gulf of the poets
This idyllic stretch of coast, the eastern section of the Italian Riviera, has gained its
romantic nickname for being the favorite destination — and, at times, abode — of
famous poets and artists. The name actually refers to the bay of La Spezia (the major
town in the region), but extends to the Cinque Terre, which lie on the western shore of
the promontory closing the gulf to the west. From the Greek poet Polibio to Dante,
Petrarch, and Montesquieu, the charms of this coast have inspired many a writer. The
most famous of all were probably Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein, and her hus-
band, Percy Bysshe Shelley — who met his death in these beautiful waters — but other
famous visitors have included Lord Byron, Virginia Woolf, and D. H. Lawrence.

Manarola/Riomaggiore
If you don’t need to stay right on the beach, you may like this bed-and-
breakfast surrounded by lush gardens high on the promontory overlook-
ing the sea. The friendly hosts will welcome you to one of the nicely
appointed guest rooms, with whitewashed walls and vaguely mission-style
furniture. The terrace, where breakfast is served in good weather, offers a
breathtaking view that sweeps over the sea. There is no air-conditioning,
but the mountain air will keep you cool. The minibus to the center of town
and to the rail station stops nearby.

Dining locally
Based on local seafood, the cuisine of the Cinque Terre is one of the
park’s most popular attractions. Besides the restaurant in the Hotel
Marina Piccola (see earlier), here are our favorite options.
Cappun Magru in Casa di Marin
$$
Groppo
CREATIVE LIGURIAN
You have to climb up the cliff to enjoy the superb cuisine at this gourmet
hide-out. The restaurant is small and delightful, and the menu spins tradi-
tion with flair for the best combinations. We highly recommend the dish
that gives its name to this restaurant, the cappon magro (a rich fish and
vegetable layered salad), as well as the gnocchi with prawns and a deli-
cious Gorgonzola and Calvados sauce. Leave room for the scrumptious
chocolate mousse with stewed cherries.

Gambero Rosso
$$
Vernazza
LIGURIAN
Set in the picturesque square at the heart of town, this is one of the best
fish restaurants around, offering some of the less common local dishes
accompanied by friendly yet professional service. The spaghetti alle von-
gole (with clams) is truly excellent, but if you want to try something more
typical, go for the tian, the local specialty of oven-roasted anchovies, pota-
toes, tomatoes, and rosemary. You will also enjoy the complimentary glass
of Sciacchetrà at the end of the meal — it’s the famous local (and rare) pas-
sito, a sweet wine.

The Cinque Terre Card
The Cinque Terre Card (% 0187-743500; www.parconazionale5terre.it) grants
access to the park and all the trails, unlimited use of its eco-friendly buses, one three-
hour bicycle rental a day, and other assorted discounts (5/$8 adults and 2.50/$4 chil-
dren 4 to 12). The Cinque Terre Card Treno also grants unlimited use of the train on the
local La Spezia-Levanto line that stops at each of the villages in the Cinque Terre
(8.50/$14 adults and 4.30/$6.90 children). Two-, three-, and seven-day versions of
these two cards are also available. The one-day Cinque Terre Card Battello gives you
the additional advantage of unlimited ferry rides between the five villages (20/$31
adults and 9.80/$16 children). You can reserve a card in advance and pick it up in the
park office at La Spezia (inside La Spezia Centrale rail station at track 1) or at any of the
park info desks in Riomaggiore, Manarola, Vernazza, Corniglia, and Monterosso (see
“Fast Facts: The Cinque Terre,” later in this chapter).

Riomaggiore
LIGURIAN
This new restaurant offers cooking that’s true to the best local traditions
with a menu that’s certified organic. The yellow walls, wood accents, and
beautiful linens and real crystal on the tables create a sunny atmosphere.
The terrace — open in peak season — is high above the sea, with a breath-
taking view. We definitely recommend the antipasto platter, with all the
Cinque Terre fish specialties: stuffed mussels and anchovies, marinated
octopus and anchovies, and baccalà (codfish) dumplings.

LIGURIAN
Tradition is the key word at Gianni’s, where the recipes of Ligurian cuisine
are prepared with care and served in refined surroundings. From late
spring to mid-fall, you can dine alfresco and enjoy gorgeous sunsets by the
sea. You will find all the classics prepared with local fish, herbs, and veg-
etables; our favorites include a fantastic zuppa di pesce and excellent
troffie al pesto (the linguine is made from chestnut flour). The ravioli di
pesce (fish ravioli) are very good, as are the local anchovies, stuffed or
marinated. Gianni’s also rents rooms in town.

Chapter 14: Northern Tuscany and the Cinque Terre 241

Exploring the Cinque Terre
Purchasing the Cinque Terre Card (see sidebar earlier) will give you unlim-
ited access to all the trails of the park and to public transportation, includ-
ing trains between the villages, the electric minibuses running up and
down along the cliff and connecting all the attractions, and the boats link-
ing four of the villages (see “Getting there,” earlier in this chapter).
The top attractions
The cliffs surrounding the villages are the real attraction of the National
Park of the Cinque Terre, which was recently declared a World Heritage
Site by UNESCO. Amazingly steep, they have been cultivated for cen-
turies, with narrow terraces built using dry stone walling — over 7,000m
(21,000 ft.) of it. Vineyards are planted all the way down to the edge of
the sea, together with luscious lemon and olive trees. During the har-
vest, farmers secure themselves with ropes to keep from falling.
Progress has come to the area, however, so here and there you may
notice small lifts that look something like monorails.
Corniglia
The only inland village of the Cinque Terre — though you can reach the
sea via an old flight of steps — Corniglia is also the most agricultural of
them all. Its cobblestone streets wind from door to door and to its
church, San Pietro. Built in 1334 above an 11th-century chapel, the
church was redone during the baroque period, but the Romanic facade
was preserved. The medieval arched building made of black stone is
believed to have been the postal station of the Fieschi family. The town’s
agricultural tradition goes back millennia: Corniglia was already export-
ing wine to Pompeii during the Roman period.
Manarola
Manarola, a lovely sight from a distance with its gaily colored houses, is
a real fishermen’s village, still dependent on the sea. It’s enclosed in a
gorge opening onto a small harbor between two rocky cliffs. Manarola
contains the 14th-century Romanic church of San Lorenzo, highlighted
by a splendid rose window. From Manarola starts — or ends — the
famous Via dell’Amore (Love Trail), the easiest of the trails joining the
villages (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
Monterosso al Mare
This is the largest of the five villages that comprise the Cinque Terre; it’s
also the only one with a nice sandy beach called Fegina and the feel of
an old-fashioned seaside resort. It’s wonderful for swimming, even
though most of the beach is divided into private swaths for the hotels
lining the beachfront. This is also the busiest of the villages, but the
heart of Monterosso is still beautiful and unspoiled. The medieval tower
Aurora separates the modern town from the old; it’s where you find the
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
242

late-Romanic church San Giovanni Battista, with a beautiful rosette on
the facade and an elegant portico in back. Farther up, you climb to the
other church in town, San Francesco, within the complex of the convent
of the Capuchins. Built in 1619, it is a nice example of Tuscan/Ligurian
Gothic in green-and-white-striped marble.
Riomaggiore
Like Manarola, fishing is still an important industry in this village.
Noteworthy attractions include the church of San Giovanni Battista, a
fine example of late-Romanic architecture with two beautiful lateral por-
tals from the 14th century. Uniting this village with Manarola is the most
famous section of the coastal path: the Via dell’Amore (Love Trail) — a
trail that was excavated in the cliff and offers fabulous views.
Vernazza
Vernazza is a very tiny fishing village with a strong medieval flavor.
Dominated by its castle, it was founded around the year 1000.
Overlooking the village is the Gothic church of Santa Margherita di
Antiochia, built right on the water with an unusual octagonal bell tower.
The fishing harbor offers a fine view over the rest of the bay.
More cool things to see and do
 If you are here to hike, you can tackle the Cinque Terre Trail (diffi-
culty level: easy; Admission: one section 3.50/$5.60, unlimited
with Cinque Terre Card, described earlier in this chapter) between
Riomaggiore and Monterosso al Mare: It will take you about five
hours if you exert an iron will and don’t stop in any of the villages
or beaches along the way. To everybody else, we recommend the
easy — and fairly flat — section of the trail known as the Via
dell’Amore between Riomaggiore and Manarola: You get the full
Cinque Terre experience without exhausting yourself. The walk
takes only about 30 minutes. If you’re more ambitious, add the two
sections from Manarola to Corniglia and Corniglia to Vernazza, each
taking about 45 minutes. The last section of the trail — from
Vernazza to Monterosso — is quite different, with winding ups and
downs, and a precipitous descent into Monterosso. We don’t rec-
ommend it, except for those fit travelers who specifically want to
hike; allow about one and a half hours. Always hike with at least
one companion, bring at least a quart of water per person (espe-
cially in summer, when it gets very hot), and wear sturdy walking
shoes. The trail is along a cliff, and landslides are not uncommon.
 Only a few sandy beaches can be found along this rocky coast: The
largest is in Monterosso al Mare, where you can even rent a beach
chair — but it gets extremely crowded, as it is right in town.
Between Corniglia and Vernazza, you can climb down — via a steep
path off the Cinque Terre Trail (see above for admission prices) —
to the romantic small pebble-and-sand beach of Guvano (a favorite
nudist spot). Easier access is through the tunnel starting north of
Chapter 14: Northern Tuscany and the Cinque Terre 243

Corniglia train station (ring the bell at the gate for access). You also
find a tiny but pretty beach in Riomaggiore at the south of the
harbor, down a flight of steps.
 More trails connect each of the villages with its Sanctuary (church
dedicated to the Madonna) up the cliff. The trails were the tradi-
tional paths used by the villagers before the local road — SS370 —
was built to reach the churches in between, but nowadays you can
also use public transportation (taxis and minibuses). Nostra
Signora di Soviore, overlooking Monterosso, sports the oldest
campanile in Liguria, dating back to the eighth century, while its
simple 14th-century facade is ornamented with a beautiful rose
window and portal. The area in front of the church serves as a
venue for classical concerts during high season (ask the local infor-
mation office for a schedule). Nostra Signora di Montenero over-
looks Riomaggiore 340m (1,120 ft.) above sea level; the church was
built in 1335, perhaps over an eighth-century chapel, and the
monastery now houses a good and atmospheric restaurant (%/Fax
0187-760528; reservations necessary; prix-fixe lunch or dinner:
15/$24) and has a few simple rooms. The restaurant is open daily,
but the kitchen closes Monday, when only sandwiches and salads
are assembled. The whole operation closes November through
March. Nostra Signora della Salute, in Volastra, also has a simple
facade enlivened by a superb carved portal and a delicate Gothic
double-arched window.
 Hiking is not the only way to explore the park: You can go moun-
tain biking (rental is 4/$6.40 per day) or horseback riding, or
even relax on a horse-drawn carriage ride. Book a carriage or a
horseback ride (or even a class) at any of the tourist information
desks (see “Fast Facts: The Cinque Terre,” later in this chapter).
Prices depend on the number of hours and participants; consider
about 35 ($56) per hour per person for a carriage ride, and about
25 ($40) per hour per person on horseback.
 The sea along the national park is a protected marine park which
can be best enjoyed via snorkeling and scuba-diving excursions.
Daiwing 5 Terre Immersioni, in Riomaggiore (Via San Giacomo 1;
% 0187-920011), is a licensed dive center offering guided excur-
sions and equipment rentals. Excursions cost about 30 ($48) per
person; equipment rental is an extra 20 ($32).

 Discovering medieval Perugia and sweet Baci
 Visiting saints and monasteries in Assisi
 Thrilling to the music festivals in Spoleto
T
he beauty of the landscape and the rich culture of this area make
this part of Italy the most beloved both by Italians and foreigners.
While this may be where the wealthy dream of having their countryside
homes, all visitors can enjoy the riches of this area, where a castle or
walled city seems to top each hill. Perhaps the most famous of all is San
Gimignano, with its beautiful towers — a perfectly preserved medieval
town. Continuing southeast across the Chianti region, famous for its fla-
vorful ruby-red wine, you arrive at Siena, Italy’s most beautiful medieval
town; its Palio delle Contrade is a furiously contested horse race that
has been held in the city’s main square, the Piazza del Campo, since the
Middle Ages. Southeast is Umbria with its deep-green hills. Perugia, the
region’s capital, is a wonderful and lively university town, rich in art and
historic sights. Not far to the east are Assisi, hometown of San
Francesco (St. Francis), Italy’s patron saint, and Santa Chiara (St. Clare).
Delightful little Spoleto is most famous for its music and art festivals —
the Festival di Spoleto and the Stagione Lirica.
If you have the time to explore the charms of the countryside, we 
recommend renting a car. You will not need it within the towns, however,
since each is small enough to be explored on foot (even Perugia, the
largest of all); and you can do quite well using public transportation
between them. Siena and Perugia both make good bases for exploring
the region, as they offer good services as well as gorgeous surroundings.
For an overview of the region, see the “Tuscany and Umbria” map in
Chapter 14.

San Gimignano
This perfectly preserved medieval town with a picturesque skyline of
towers is one of southern Tuscany’s most famous destinations. San
Gimignano makes an easy day trip from Siena or even Florence, but it
can also be a romantic place to spend the night, with its view of the twin-
kling lights of other Tuscan hill towns. You can explore the town’s major
attractions in about four hours.

Getting there
The easiest way to reach San Gimignano is by bus from Siena; TRA-IN
(% 0577-204246; www.trainspa.it) offers regular service. The trip
takes about 50 minutes and costs 4€ ($7.70). From all other locales, you
need to first reach the nearby town of Poggibonsi, well served by both
train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) and bus, and from there switch
to the local bus to San Gimignano — it’s doable, but laborious. To avoid
the hassle, it would be easier to join a guided tour from Florence (see
later in this section) or to rent a car.
By car, take the autostrada Florence–Pisa and take either the COLLE DI VAL
D’ELSA exit (which takes you along picturesque small roads through the
countryside) or the much faster POGGIBONSI exit, through a busy indus-
trial area. The sign on the highway doesn’t say San Gimignano, but after
you exit, you will see signs for San Gimignano on SS324. The trip takes
about 11⁄2 hours from Florence and slightly less time from Siena. Once
you arrive, you need to park outside the town’s walls, as San Gimignano
is closed to private traffic. You can drive to your hotel to deposit your
luggage, but you need to have the authorization arranged by the hotel in
advance. None of the hotels inside the town walls have parking, but you
can use nearby lots for 20€ ($32) per day.
Spending the night
In the low season between November and March, the major hotels in
town take turns staying open, so there is always a place to stay.
Bel Soggiorno
$
Duomo
This historic hotel is the second best inside the town walls, offering
simple, quiet accommodations with great views. Guest rooms are spacious
and comfortable; bathrooms are modern and well kept. The public spaces
are cozy and inviting. The hotel restaurant is good, with a panoramic ter-
race and a wine bar.

Collegiata (Localita Strada 27; % 0577-943201; www.lacollegiata.it),
but it is a resort complete with private park, pool, and Jacuzzi — and it is
also much more affordable. All rooms are pleasant and comfortable; some
have private terraces overlooking the lush countryside.

Dining locally
The area is known for its wines, and the best place to sample them is at
Gustavo (Via San Matteo 29; % 0577-940057), perhaps accompanied by
the excellent selection of local cured meats, cheese, and fett’unta (toasted
bread with extra-virgin olive oil and veggie toppings). Another wine bar
is attached to the restaurant of the Bel Soggiorno hotel (see earlier).
For the best gelato in town, head for Il Gelataio (Piazza della Cisterna 4;
% 0577-942244; closed mid-Nov to mid-Feb). This eatery doesn’t take
advantage of its perfect location to skimp on the quality and will sur-
prise you with creative flavors, such as D.O.P. zafferano (locally pro-
duced saffron), and Vernaccia, made with the local wine.

Rise and fall of a small town
San Gimignano was a dormant small village for centuries after it was established by
the Etruscans in the third century B.C. It was only when the main route from Italy to
France went right through the village in the Middle Ages that San Gimignano’s for-
tunes changed. Thanks also to a flourishing saffron industry, the local merchants
became rich and marked their increasing pride by building palazzi. Towers, the 
symbol of the palazzo owner’s wealth, went up like crazy during the town’s period of
great economic success in the 13th century. So much competition existed in tower-
building — always higher and higher — that the government made a law forbidding
any tower taller than the one on the Palazzo del Popolo, the seat of the government.
The economic boom was suddenly wiped out by the plague (which hit San Gimignano
several times between the 14th and 17th centuries), a disaster that ultimately pre-
served the town, allowing it to remain basically intact as a typical walled medieval vil-
lage with no modern additions.

Osteria Del Carcere

We love this authentic osteria for its carefully chosen ingredients that
include excellent regional cured meats and sheep’s-milk cheese. We highly
recommend the soup: the minestra di pane (a sort of ribollita), the pappa

it up with the splendid faraona alla castagne (hen with chestnuts) in winter,
or another of their seasonal specials.
See map p. 247. Via del Castello 13. % 0577-941905. Reservations recommended.
Secondi: 11€–16€ ($18–$26). No credit cards. Open: Fri–Tues 12:30–2:30 p.m.,
Thurs–Tues 7:30–10 p.m. Closed for a period between Jan and Feb.
Exploring San Gimignano
You can book a bus tour from Florence; the best are organized by
American Express (% 055-50981) and SITA (% 055-214721; www.
sitabus.it), which both charge about 50€ ($80).
The guided tours organized by the local tourist office (ProLoco; Piazza
Duomo 1; % 0577-940008; www.sangimignano.com) are informative
and a good deal.
The top attractions
The town itself is the attraction here, and walking through its medieval
alleys is quite magical. Of the original 72 or so medieval towers which
are the symbol of town, only 15 remain today, including the tallest: the
one on the Palazzo del Popolo (see later in this chapter). Piazza della
Cisterna, at the heart of town, is the most attractive in San Gimignano
and an elegant example of medieval architecture: Triangular in shape
and beautifully paved with bricks, it is lined with some of the town’s
most important palazzi, such as the Palazzo Tortoli-Treccani at no. 22,
with its double row of bifore (double lancet windows). The center of the
square is graced by a picturesque well: It gives access to an underlying
cistern, which held the town’s water supply in case of siege. The main
street — Via San Matteo — is a section of the medieval highway that
brought wealth and renown to town. Besides its historical interest — as
the most important route between northern and southern Europe — it’s
a beautiful section of the medieval town, lined with palaces and towers.
Duomo (Basilica di S. Maria Assunta) and Santa Fina Chapel
Still called the Duomo by locals — although according to the Catholic
church’s administration, it technically doesn’t deserve the title (the town
has no bishop and its cathedral should be called a Collegiata) — the 
basilica was built in the 12th century. Its facade is very plain, but once
inside you discover a gorgeously decorated Romanesque interior with
Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 251

tiger-striped arches and a galaxy of gold stars. Among the treasures are
the wooden statues of Gabriele and Annunziata by Jacopo della Quercia
and the 14th-century frescoes decorating the naves. The right nave’s last
chapel is the Chapel of Santa Fina, one of the most beautiful from the
Tuscan Renaissance. Designed by Giuliano and Benedetto da Maiano —
Benedetto also carved the panel of the altar — its glorious cycle of fres-
coes by Domenico Ghirlandaio describes the life of a local girl named Fina,
who became the town’s patron saint.
See map p. 247. Piazza del Duomo. % 0577-940316. Admission: 3€ ($4.80). Open: Nov
1–Jan 20 and Mar Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–4:40 p.m., Sun and holidays 12:30–4:40 p.m.;
Apr–Oct Mon–Fri 9:30 a.m.–7:10 p.m., Sat 9:30 a.m.–5:10 p.m., Sun and holidays
12:30–5:10 p.m. Closed Jan 21–Feb 28.
Palazzo del Popolo
Built between 1288 and 1323 (except for its crenellations, which were a
19th-century addition), this was the government headquarters. Its tower,
the Torre Grossa, was added in 1311 and is the tallest in town, 53m (177 ft.)
high. We recommend climbing the tower to get a superb view over the
town. The interior of the palace is decorated with great frescoes and fur-
nishings from the 14th and 15th centuries. It also houses the Civic Museum,
where you find the Sala di Dante (Dante’s Room), decorated with splendid
frescoes by Lippo Memmi (his Maestà is considered a masterpiece).
See map p. 247. Piazza del Duomo 1. % 0577-990312. Admission: 4€ ($6.40). Open:
Daily Mar–Oct 9:30 a.m.–7 p.m.; Nov–Feb 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m., except Dec 24 10 a.m.–
1:30 p.m., Dec 25 and 31 10 a.m.–5 p.m., and Jan 1 12:30–5 p.m. Closed Jan 31 for the
patron Saint day.
More cool things to see and do
If you have the time, you may want to explore more of the village’s
medieval delights. Here are a few additional options:
 A pleasant and easy excursion is the 15-minute walk out of town
from Porta delle Fonti to the medieval fountain. You follow in the
footsteps of medieval town dwellers: This fountain provided San
Gimignano with running water and was where locals did their laun-
dry. The 14th-century arched construction hides the 9th-century
Longobard fountain inside.
 Sant’Agostino (Piazza Sant’Agostino; % 0577-940383) is a beauti-
ful 13th-century Romanesque-Gothic church. Its plain facade hides
a superb cycle of frescoes on the life of St. Augustine, done by
Benozzo Gozzoli; also interesting is his fresco of St. Sebastian on
the third altar to the left. The church is open daily from 7 a.m. to
noon and 3 to 6 p.m. (Jan and Feb reopens at 4 p.m.; Apr 1–Oct 31
closes at 7 p.m.). Admission is free.

The Chianti
This gorgeous region between Florence and Siena has it all: velvety hills, tiny medieval
towns, and acres of vineyards and olive groves. An agricultural area of uncommon
beauty, the soft slopes of its hills bloom with magnificent colors in every season. The
tallest hills are topped by medieval walled towns and pieve (fortified churches). Break
our rule about driving in Italy and put the pedal to the metal on the Chiantigiana
(SS222), the local road linking Florence to Siena (or at least take a bus tour; see later
in this chapter). This winding 66km (41-mile) road was established as the route for col-
lecting wine from each vineyard in the region and bringing it to Florence — so it’s per-
fect for tourists, as it passes through each of the major points of interest in the area.
If you’re pressed for time, head to Greve in Chianti, the area’s main village. It has a
delightful piazza and an excellent restaurant/hotel, the Giovanni da Verrazzano (Piazza
Giacomo Matteotti 28; % 055-853189; www.ristoranteverrazzano.it; Closed
Wed and Sun), which also offers excellent cooking classes. Good restaurants, hotels,
resorts, and vineyards abound, of course, as it is difficult to have a bad meal in the
Chianti — and impossible to have a bad glass of wine, provided you stick to the local
red. Among the places to stay, we recommend the Castello di Spaltenna, in Gaiole in
Chianti (Via Spaltenna 13; % 0577-749483; www.spaltenna.com), a real medieval
castle; and the much more modest but delightful Villa Rosa di Boscorotondo, in
Area Code
The local area code is 0577 (see
“Telephone” in the “Fast Facts” section 
of Appendix A for more on calling to and
from Italy).
ATMs
You find ATMs inside the banks in town.
You can exchange money at the tourist

1 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m.
Police
Call % 113.
Post Office
The post office (ufficio postale) is at Piazza
delle Erbe 8 (% 0577-941983).

Siena
This is our favorite town in Tuscany. With its rich orange tones and
myriad tiled roofs baking in the strong sun, Siena is a sculpture in its
own right. It is a magnificent medieval city surrounded by sun-drenched
countryside, but Siena is far from being a museum piece. Passion per-
vades Sienese life — and you can experience the love the residents have
for their town and their traditions during their time-honored Palio horse
race (see later in this section).
To do justice to Siena, you should spend the night in town. But if you
don’t have the time, one day is enough to see the highlights; you can
also visit as a day trip from Florence, which is better than nothing.
Getting there
Siena lies 62km (37 miles) south of Florence. The newly introduced 
Pisa Airport shuttle bus (see Chapter 14) takes you to Siena in about
two hours. The bus, which is run by TRA-IN (% 0577-204246; www.
trainspa.it), costs 14€ ($22) and can be reserved in advance at 
% 800-905183 or through the tourist office (see “Fast Facts: Siena,” later
in this chapter). TRA-IN (see above) and SITA (% 800-373760; www.
sitabus.it) offer regular service from Florence (from the SITA bus 
station near the SMN train station); the trip takes 11⁄4 hours and costs
Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 255
Panzano (Via San Leolino 59, 5km/3 miles south of Greve on SS222; % 055-852577;
www.resortvillarosa.it). In Spedaluzzo, La Cantinetta (Via Mugnano 93,
2.3km/11⁄2 miles north of Greve on SS222; % 055-8572000; Closed Mon) is a superb
restaurant housed in a two-centuries-old farmhouse. Worth a visit is the 11th-century
Castello di Uzzano (% 055-85444851; www.agricolauzzano.com; Open: Apr–Oct
daily 8:30 a.m.–6 p.m., winter, by reservation only), a beautiful vineyard located on a
side road 5km (3 miles) northeast of Greve in Chianti. You can visit the cellars
(Admission: 5€/$8) and tour the famous gardens (Admission: 6€/$9.60).
Head of the Chianti League in the Middle Ages, Radda in Chianti also makes a good
destination. Nearby (about 11km/7 miles southeast of Radda), you can visit the Castello
di Brolio (% 0577-749066; www.ricasoli.it), one of the region’s oldest wine-pro-
ducing estates and the birthplace of the Chianti Classico we know today. Visitors can
explore part of the spectacular grounds and gardens (Admission: 3€/$4.80; Open:
Summer 9 a.m. to noon and 3–6 p.m., winter 9 a.m. to noon and 2–5 p.m.) and take a
tour of the cellars (by appointment) for 15€ ($24).
If you don’t like driving, we recommend the day tours run by SITA (% 055-214721;
www.sitabus.it). They cost 32€ ($51) and are offered daily from Florence.
Florence’s tourist office, with the support of Machiavelli Viaggi (% 055-8228073;
www.machiavelliviaggi.it), organizes excellent tours that include visits to
local artisans.

about 5€ ($8), with buses leaving every half-hour. SENA (% 800-930960
or 0577-283203; www.sena.it) runs seven daily buses from Rome’s
Stazione Tiburtina for 17€ ($27); reservations are required from Rome to
Siena (contact Eurolines at % 06-44252461; it will deliver tickets to
your hotel via messenger service), but not from Siena to Rome. SENA
also makes runs to and from Milan and other Italian cities. The bus sta-
tion is in Piazza Gramsci, off the La Lizza pedestrian gallery, at the north
edge of the historic district.
Trains (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) pull in at Siena’s rail station,
on Piazza Fratelli Rosselli, about 2.5km (11⁄2 miles) downhill from the
town center (% 0577-280115). You find direct train service from
Florence (and the nearby towns of Empoli and Chiusi), but from most
other destinations, you have to change trains at one of the above sta-
tions. The trip from Rome takes about three hours and costs about 17€
($27); from Venice, it takes about five hours and costs about 28€ ($45).
Florence is about one and a half hours away and costs about 6€ ($9.60).
You then have to take a taxi or a minibus (see later).
If you’re renting a car, it is easy enough to drive here (via the Florence/
Siena highway or by taking exit VAL DI CHIANA from the A1 highway, and
then following SS326), but keep in mind that the town center is pedes-
trian-only; you find parking lots at each of the town gates (1.50€/$2.40
per hour).
Don’t even dream of parking for free outside the town walls if you don’t
want your car broken into or stolen.
From the train station and the parking lots, you can take the public
minibuses to the historic district daily from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. A ticket,
valid for one hour, costs 0.95€ ($1.50); a daily pass is 3.65€ ($5.80).
Spending the night
It used to be that all hotels in Siena’s historic district were modest prop-
erties offering basic accommodations, and if you wanted modern ameni-
ties you had to head for the modern part of town — but this has
changed, and you now find hotels for all tastes and budgets
Grand Hotel Continental
$$$$
Historic district
The first five-star hotel to open in the historic district remains unparal-
leled today. In a beautifully frescoed historic palazzo — built in the 17th
century by Pope Alessandro VII as a home for his niece — it offers top-
notch service and sumptuous accommodations. Guest rooms are large and
luxurious, with spacious marble bathrooms.

Hotel Scacciapensieri
$$$
North of town
If you don’t mind staying in Siena’s beautiful countryside — a short 
(2.5-km/11⁄2-mile) bus or taxi ride away from the historic district — this
hotel is a great value. It offers pleasant accommodations in a 19th-century
villa, and great amenities, like the heavenly swimming pool.

Palazzo Ravizza
$$$
Duomo
The lengthy renovations of this 17th-century family palace have finally
brought this hotel to its full potential: The beautiful architectural 
details — vaulted ceilings, checked tiled floors, hardwood parquet — have
now been completely restored. Guest rooms are bright, and some have
frescoed ceilings. The garden, which has beautiful views, is the setting for
a typical American breakfast in the high season, as well as dinner, should
you decide to take advantage of the hotel’s perfectly adequate restaurant.

Dining locally
Sienese cuisine is a variety of Tuscan cooking (see Chapter 2), with a few
specialties such as the pici (hand-rolled spaghetti), usually prepared
with bread crumbs and tomato sauce.
Al Marsili

Duomo
SIENESE
If you’ve come to Siena for a romantic getaway, Al Marsili is the perfect
choice. It lives up to its reputation by offering excellent service, an elegant
but warm atmosphere, and superb food. You can find staples of Sienese
cuisine here, such as delicious homemade pici, as well as specialties like
faraona alla Medici (guinea hen with pine nuts, almonds, and prunes) and
an excellent selection of wines.
See map p. 256. Via del Castoro 3, between Via di Città and the Duomo. % 0577-47154.

This charming trattoria, close to Piazza del Campo, is a favorite among the
Sienese. The food is good, sometimes remarkable. Try the duck stewed

spaghetti with hot tomato sauce), or the pappardelle with wild-boar sauce.

SIENESE/WINE BAR
The excellent cuisine here is a fine match for the wonderful cellar with
over a thousand wines. The menu offers lighter choices for lunch and
heartier ones at dinner — all made with local ingredients. We recommend
the ravioli maremmani (ravioli with a goat-cheese and basil sauce) and 
the rabbit with olives. If you come during a lull, you can ask for a tour of
the cellars, which are housed in part of a medieval aqueduct beneath the
building.

Exploring Siena
The Centro Guide-Associazione Guide Turistiche (% 0577-43273;
www.guidesiena.it) organizes tours of the town’s highlights, which
leave from the tourist office in Piazza del Campo, as well as custom-
designed tours, such as a visit to Siena’s museums. Prices vary accord-
ing to the type of tour. For a bus tour from Florence, call American
Express (% 055-50981) or the bus company SITA (% 055-214-721;
www.sitabus.it); both offer tours for about 50€ ($80).
The Biglietto Unico Musei covers the main museums in town (Museo
Civico, Pinacoteca Nazionale, Santa Maria della Scala, the Duomo and
Piccolomini Library, and the State Archives) for 14€ ($22). You can

purchase it from the tourist office or from the travel agency Vacanze
Senesi (www.bookingsiena.it).
If you’re planning to see everything in town, the Siena Itinerari d’Arte
(SIA) Pass (including the Museo dell’Opera, Baptistery, Oratorio di San
Bernardino and Museum, Palazzo delle Papesse, Santa Maria della Scala,
Museo Civico, and Sant’Agostino) is the ticket for you: Both the winter
(Nov 2–Feb 28 for 13€/$21) and summer (Mar 1–Nov 1 for 16€/$26) ver-
sions are valid for seven days.
Those who are less ambitious, or have less time, can take advantage 
of the Biglietto Cumulativo Musei Comunali, which includes entrance
to Museo Civico, Palazzo delle Papesse, and Santa Maria della Scala for
10€ ($16) and is valid for two days, or the Biglietto Cumulativo Opera
Duomo, which also costs 10€ ($16), is valid for three days, and includes
admission to the Duomo, Museo dell’Opera, Baptistery, Crypt, and
Oratorio di San Bernardino with Museum.
The top attractions
The medieval town is an attraction unto itself: Built over three hills, it 
is divided into terza (districts that cover a third of town each). North,
along Via Banchi di Sopra, is the Terza di Camollia; southwest, along Via
di Città, is the Terza di Città (with the Duomo); and southeast, along Via
del Porrione, is the Terza di San Martino. The three terza meet at Piazza
del Campo.
Baptistery of San Giovanni
Built in the 14th century, the baptistery’s unfinished Gothic facade is by
Domenico di Agostino; inside, its succession of lavish frescoes mostly
depict the lives of Christ and St. Anthony and were painted in the 15th cen-
tury. At the center of it all is the baptismal font, a splendid masterpiece of
monumental proportions made of six bronze panels depicting scenes of
the life of St. John the Baptist, divided by figurines representing the
virtues, each carved by one of the best artists of the time: the Feast of
Herod and the figurines of Faith and Hope by Donatello; the Baptism of
Christ and the Arrest of the Baptist by Lorenzo Ghiberti; Giovanni di Turino
did the Preaching of the Baptist and, with Turino di Sano, the Birth of the
Baptist. Crowning the font is the marble ciborium with the statue of St.
John the Baptist carved by Jacopo della Quercia. The angels are the work
of Donatello and Giovanni di Turino.

Duomo and Piccolomini Library
Some consider this Romanesque-Gothic cathedral the most beautiful in
Italy: Decorated with contrasting colored marble both inside and out, it
Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 261

was built during the first half of the 13th century in Romanesque and
Gothic styles. It contains many works of art, including a superb 13th-cen-
tury pulpit carved by Nicola Pisano — the artist who crafted the magnifi-
cent pulpit in Pisa’s Baptistery and the father of Giovanni Pisano (who
carved the pulpit in Pisa’s Duomo). The cathedral pavement is another
work of art by many famous artists of the time: Unfortunately, it is visible
only between August 23 and October 27, in honor of the Palio. Another
masterpiece is the Piccolomini Library, built by Cardinal Francesco
Piccolomini (later Pius III) to honor his uncle, Pope Pius II. The library was
beautifully frescoed by Pinturicchio with scenes from the life of the pope
and contains the Three Graces, an exquisite Roman sculpture of the third
century B.C. designed after a Greek model.

Museo Civico and Torre del Mangia
The Museo Civico is housed in the beautiful 13th-century Palazzo
Pubblico, the seat of the government in Siena’s republican period and
today’s town hall. Its richly frescoed rooms host some of Siena’s impor-
tant artwork. On the second floor, the loggia is the showcase for the
eroded panels from the masterpiece fountain that decorated Piazza del
Campo — the 14th-century Fonte Gaia was carved by Jacopo della Quercia
and replaced by a replica in the 19th century. In the Sala del Mappamondo
(Globe Room), just off the chapel, are two important pieces by 14th-cen-
tury Sienese painter Simone Martini: the Maestà and the magnificent fresco
of Guidoriccio da Fogliano, captain of the Sienese army (though there’s
been debate about the attribution of the latter work to Martini). In the Sala
della Pace (Peace Room) — the meeting room of the Council of Nine that
governed Siena — is a famous series of frescoes by another 14th-century
Sienese painter, Ambrogio Lorenzetti: the secular medieval Allegory of the
Good and Bad Government and Its Effects on the City and the Countryside.
From the palazzo’s 14th-century Torre del Mangia — accessible from the
courtyard — is a breathtaking view of the town and the surrounding hills
(if you’re up to climbing the 503 steps, that is). At 100m (335 ft.), the Torre
del Mangia is the second-tallest medieval tower in Italy (the tower in
Cremona is taller).

Museo dell’Opera del Duomo
This museum occupies a part of the originally projected Duomo, which
was never built. The ambitious plan was to create a cathedral of such huge
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
262

proportions that the current Duomo would have been just the transept,
but it never happened because of engineering problems and the plague of
1348. Today, the space has been turned into a museum; the gallery con-
tains all the original artwork that was removed from the Duomo for safe-
keeping and to prevent further decay, such as the splendid statues that
Giovanni Pisano carved for the facade. The rich collection also includes a
number of painting masterpieces, such as Duccio di Buoninsegna’s
Maestà, depicting the Virgin Mary, and Pietro Lorenzetti’s beautiful trip-
tych the Birth of the Virgin.

Palio delle Contrade
Piazza del Campo
This medieval-style derby has been igniting locals’ passion since the
Middle Ages (the Palio may even date back to the Etruscans, but the first
written document mentioning the race is from 1238). Far from just a tourist
attraction, it is a deeply felt and hotly contested competition among the
city’s 17 districts (contrade). The world’s most difficult horse race is run
bareback on Piazza del Campo, which is temporarily filled with dirt. The
horses loop the square three times while riders hit the horses — and each
other — with their short whips. The horse that arrives first wins, even if it
has thrown his rider! Before the 17th century, the Palio was run in the streets,
in the style of the Monaco Grand Prix, making it even more dangerous and
brutal — even today, injuries aren’t uncommon. The two competitions, held
in July and August, are accompanied by colorful parades of medieval cos-
tumes — each contrada has its own colors — and flag juggling, a difficult and
skillful art. The best contrada wins the Masgalano, traditionally a silver bowl
weighing at least 1 kilogram (21⁄4 pounds) and decorated with Palio scenes.
You don’t need to buy expensive tickets to attend the Palio, unless you
really want to see the race up close. Standing in the center of the square
is free — and a lot of fun; but you won’t be able to get out until the race is
over. Wherever you sit, bring lots of refreshments and a hat, and get there
early, as the square fills up quickly.
Piazza del Campo. www.comune.siena.it. Tickets for a seat in the grandstands
or at a window of one of the buildings surrounding the piazza are controlled by the
building owners and the shops in front of which the stands are set up. Palio Viaggi
(Piazza La Lizza 12; % 0577-280828; Fax: 0577-289114) can help you score a seat.
Seats can cost anywhere from 200€ to over 1,000€ ($320 to over $1,600) and need
to be reserved as far as 6 months in advance. Final races: July 2 and Aug 16. Trials
start June 29 and Aug 13.
Pinacoteca Nazionale
This picture gallery, housed in the 15th-century Palazzo Buonsignori, 
contains an expansive collection of art showing the unique Sienese
Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 263

Renaissance style, which retained Greek and Byzantine influences long
after realism came into play elsewhere (notably Florence), and also empha-
sized rich coloration. It includes works from the 12th century to the first
half of the 17th century. Guido da Siena, an early developer of the Sienese
school, is well represented, along with the more famous Duccio di
Buoninsegna, the real founder of the style; his painting of the Virgin is a
marvel of delicacy and pathos. Also represented is Giovanni di Paolo —
don’t miss his beautiful little painting of the Virgin.

Santa Maria della Scala
In the former Hospital of Siena, this huge complex of buildings is now open
to the public. Many of its rooms were lavishly decorated with frescoes and
artwork during the Renaissance and later periods. One of the most sur-
prising rooms is the Pellegrinaio, which held hospital beds until only a
few years ago. Its original 14th-century wooden ceiling was replaced in the
15th century by a beautiful vaulted ceiling decorated with frescoes nar-
rating the history of the hospital — the last vault by the window was
added in the 16th century. The Cappella del Sacro Chiodo — or Sagrestia
Vecchia (Old Sacristy) — was also built in 1444, to hold the relics and reli-
quaries bought by the Spedale from the imperial palace of Byzantium. It was
frescoed by Lorenzo Vecchietta with a cycle on the New and Old Testaments.
The chapel also holds the famous fresco by Domenico di Bartolo, Madonna
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria

The Palio day by day
The Palio is organized by the town government and strictly regulated. Only 10 of 
the 17 contrade (town neighborhoods) participate in each of the two races: the seven
that didn’t run the previous year in the same race plus three that are drawn from 
the remaining ten. The drawing, which takes place at least 20 days before each race,
signals the beginning of the competition, but the official opening of the festivities
occurs three days before the race and is marked by the ceremony of the drawing of
the horse — when each of the ten chosen animals is assigned to a contrada — and
the first of six trial runs on Piazza del Campo; other trial runs take place during each
of the three days before the Palio. At 3 p.m. on the day of the Palio, each horse is
blessed in the church of its contrada, and then is led to join the historic cortege. 
After the cortege has assembled, it tours the town before convening with the other
horses in Piazza del Campo around 5 p.m. for the race. The alignment of the horses
for the start is also decided by a drawing, and the last horse starts on the run from the
back: When he moves the rope at the front, it is hastily lowered and the race begins.
After the race, the colors of the winning contrada are brought triumphantly around
town in a lively parade. The winning contrada will celebrate all night — and indeed
until the next year. The victory dinner for the whole contrada — with thousands of 
participants — takes place around the end of September.

More cool things to see and do
 For a wonderful outing, we highly recommend a ride on the Treno
Natura (Ferrovia della Val d’Orcia; % 0577-207413; www.ferrovie
turistiche.it) — and not only for families. When the local train
line closed a few years ago, a group of volunteers, in cooperation
with the Italian Railroads Company, decided that this scenic ride
should not go to waste. They restored some antique engines and
carriages and reopened the line, which is a hit, with both kids and
adults. Antique carriages trailed by a diesel engine run on Sundays
at 8:30 a.m., 11:15 a.m., and 3:45 p.m., but there are a number of
special steam-engine tours that are scheduled only on special
dates. Diesel-engine runs cost 16€ ($26), and steam-engine trips
cost 27€ ($43); children under 10 ride for free (no reserved seat)
with one adult. You can make reservations at the Siena tourist
office or directly with Treno Natura.
 If you have some room left in your head for more Renaissance paint-
ings, the Oratorio di San Bernardino and Museo Diocesano di Arte 
Sacra (Piazza San Francesco 10; % 0577-283048; www.operaduomo.
siena.it) is worth a visit. San Bernardino’s lower chapel was fres-
coed by the best Sienese painters of the 17th century, while the
upper one is a beautiful example of the Italian Renaissance. Next
door, the museum holds works collected from churches and con-
vents in the area. Admission is 3€ ($4.80). Open: March through
October, daily from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 3 to 5:30 p.m.
 You may want to visit the Home-Sanctuary of Saint Caterina (Via
Costa di Sant’Antonio 6; % 0577-288175; www.caterinati.org),
the Sienese saint’s house and the sanctuary (which includes several
works of art) that was built around it in 1464, when she was sancti-
fied. Caterina Benincasa was born here in 1347, the daughter of a
fabric dyer and launderer and one of 26 children (!); she fought for
peace and for the papacy to come back to Rome from its exile in
Avignon — at a time when women had little say in political questions.
Admission is free; the site is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 Siena’s lively cultural life and wonderful local wine is best sampled
at one of the many enoteche — wine shops that turn into wine bars
at night. The Enoteca Italica Permanente (Fortezza Medicea, Via
Camollia 72; % 0577-288811; www.enoteca-italiana.it; Open:
Mon noon to 8 p.m., Tues–Sat noon to 1 a.m.), in the cellars of a
16th-century fortress, is actually an official institution, preserving
Italy’s best vintages. The newly added Millevini (Mon–Sat noon–3
p.m. and 7–10 p.m.) is a restaurant that offers excellent fare at mod-
erate prices in a traditional and somewhat formal setting.
Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 265

Shopping for local treasures
Among the city’s specialties are, of course, the wine and spirits of the sur-
rounding hills — the Chianti. If you intend to bring some home, note that
grappa (clear Italian brandy) travels better than wine, which “bruises”
and has to be left to sit for months after being carried on a plane. One of
the best places to buy is the Enoteca San Domenico (Via del Paradiso 56;
% 0577-271181), which offers a good selection of local wines as well 
as an assortment of specialty foods. The Antica Drogheria Manganelli
(Via di Città 71–73; % 0577-280002) sells high-quality local products —
including oils, vinegars, and cured meats — and has been making its own
panforte (the typical Sienese honey-and-almond fruitcake) since 1879.
Local products include embroidery and fine fabrics. Siena Ricama (Via di
Città 61; % 0577-288339) sells hand-embroidered goods, or you can
place a custom order for items fashioned with Renaissance patterns.
Antiche Dimore (Via di Città 115; % 0577-45337) carries beautiful fabric,
both sold by the yard and made into embroidered linens for the home.
Also interesting is Ceramiche Santa Caterina (Via di Città 51, 74, and 76;
% 0577-283098), the showroom of local master ceramicist Marcello Neri.

Perugia
The capital of Umbria, this splendid town is renowned for its art, which
spans Etruscan to modern times, and its universities (including a popu-
lar university for foreigners); but it is perhaps most famous for its
chocolate: Perugia is the home of Perugina, maker of the delicious Baci.
You can visit its major attractions in a day, but we recommend you stay
the night to partake of the lively local culture and excellent cuisine.
Getting there
Perugia is connected by train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) with all
major destinations, although you sometimes have to change in Foligno or 
Terontola. Rome is only two and a quarter hours away; the ticket will cost 
about 17€ ($27). Florence is two hours away, a ride that costs about 8€
($13). Perugia’s train station, on Piazza Vittorio Veneto (% 075-5006865), 
is about ten minutes by taxi or 15 minutes by bus to Piazza Italia, in the
town center.
Coaches arrive in Perugia in Piazza Partigiani, an escalator ride from
Piazza Italia at the center of town, making the bus quite convenient from
most destinations in Italy. SULGA (% 800-099661 or 075-5009641;
www.sulga.it) has three daily buses from Rome and one from Florence.
The ride from Rome takes two and a half hours and costs 23€ ($37)
round-trip; the one from Florence is one and three-quarter hours and
costs about 16€ ($26) round-trip. SITA (% 055-214721; www.sitabus.
it) also makes one daily run to and from Florence for about the same
price. SENA (% 800-930960 in Italy; www.sena.it) travels to and from
Siena from Rome, Milan, and other cities; the one-hour trip costs 11€
($18). Perugia’s Transit Authority, APM (% 800-512141 or 075-506781;
www.apmperugia.it), connects Perugia with Assisi on a daily basis for
3.10€ ($5), and also serves other cities in Umbria.
By car, Perugia is on the E45, an easy 180km (115 miles) from Rome and
150km (94 miles) from Florence. From the A1 highway, take the exit TERNI
if you’re coming from Rome or the exit VAL DI CHIANA BETTOLLE-SINALUNGA
from Florence. The center of the historic town is at the top of a steep hill
and is closed to traffic. You have to leave your car in one of the numer-
ous parking lots — a convenient one is Piazza Partigiani’s underground
lot, just south of the historic center. All parking lots are linked to the
center by elevators or escalators.
Spending the night
Sleeping in the heart of the historic district is expensive; for better
deals, you have to move farther out.

palazzo of a marquis eventually became the first and only lodging in town.
Today, the hotel offers guest rooms that vary in size and décor — some
luxurious with gilded moldings and fine details, others plainer but full of

Il Falchetto
$$$
UMBRIAN
With a real medieval atmosphere (one dining room is from the 14th cen-
tury) and a traditional menu, Falchetto is an excellent place for discover-
ing Umbrian cuisine — especially if you’re in the mood to splurge. The
homemade fettuccine is exceptional, and the meat dishes are all excellent:
Try the hare with olives or the torello alla Perugina (beef with homemade
game pâté). The terrace is particularly in demand during the summer
Umbria Jazz Festival.

UMBRIAN/CREATIVE
This lively restaurant, located in a historic palace, offers regional special-
ties and some tasty innovations. If you’re in luck, the seasonal menu may

CREATIVE UMBRIAN/SEAFOOD
With a good location in the historic district, this restaurant continues to
delight its customers with perfect homemade pastas, breads, and desserts.
Foodies will be happy to see quite a few creative offerings on the seasonal
menu, mostly centered on seafood. We recommend the umbricelli (fresh
local pasta) with the sauce of the day: We had it with cured duck, fresh
tomatoes, and pecorino di fossa, a special hard cheese. The wine list
includes many choices by the glass.

Exploring Perugia
The Perugia Città Museo card (% 800-697616 in Italy; turismo.
comune.perugia.it) is just the ticket if you’re visiting more than one
museum or monument in Perugia. It comes in a one-day version for 7€
($11); a three-day version for 12€ ($19); and a family or group version
for 35€ ($56) that’s valid for one year and gives access to a maximum of
four people. You can purchase the card at any of the sites and avoid
lines thereafter.
The top attractions
Collegio del Cambio
On the Palazzo dei Priori’s ground floor (see later in this section), this was
the town’s Goods Exchange in Renaissance times. The interesting archi-
tecture of the three halls is enlivened by magnificent frescoed ceilings:
Those of the Sala dell’Udienza (Audience Hall) are by Perugino and his
assistants — one of whom was Raphael — and illustrate the life of Christ;
there’s also a self-portrait of Perugino himself. The splendid wooden carv-
ings of the Legist Chamber are by Giampiero Zuccari; the adjacent Chapel
of Saint John the Baptist is frescoed by Giannicola di Paolo, a pupil of
Perugino. Half an hour will suffice for your visit.
See map p. 269. Corso Vannucci 25. % 075-5728599. Admission: 4.50€ ($7.20); with
Collegio della Mercanzia 5.50€ ($8.80). Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–12:30 p.m. and
2:30–5:30 p.m.; Sun and holidays 9 a.m.–1 p.m. (Nov 1–Mar 15 closed Mon afternoon).
Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 271
A bit of history
Etruscan in origin, Perugia developed as an important urban center during the Middle
Ages. Further expanding during the Renaissance, the city-state became infamous for
its fierce battles and attempts at maintaining its independence, particularly from the
Roman Church State. The town was finally subjugated by the popes in 1540, who
imposed a few hundred years of steady rule, building the Rocca Paolina fortress.
Perugia was also the hometown of painter Pietro Vannucci, who brought fame to him-
self and his town under the name “Il Perugino.”

Collegio della Mercanzia
This was the medieval Merchants’ Guild; it is a small attraction that you
can visit in just 15 minutes, but it’s definitely worth the time. As you enter,
you find yourself in the 13th-century Audience Hall, decorated with intri-
cately carved wood paneling and beautiful vaulted ceilings. Look around
to admire all the wonderful details.
See map p. 269. Corso Vannucci 15. % 075-5730366. Admission: 1.50€ ($2.40); with
Collegio del Cambio 5.50€ ($8.80). Open: Tues–Sat 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 2:30–5:30 p.m.,
Sun and holidays 9 a.m.–1 p.m. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Duomo (Cathedral of San Lorenzo) and cloisters
Opening onto the beautiful Piazza IV Novembre, this church presents a
simple, unfinished facade. Begun in the tenth century, the church was con-
secrated only in 1569; the Gothic interior was decorated in the 18th cen-
tury and holds some earlier art, including a beautiful 15th-century carved
wooden choir, miraculously preserved with only minimal damage from a
fire that developed in the Duomo in 1985. From the elegant cloisters, you
can access the Museo Capitolare, which has an important collection of
illuminated manuscripts and 15th-century art, including the famous
Madonna Enthroned by Luca Signorelli (a pupil of Piero della Francesca).
Allow about 45 minutes for your visit.
See map p. 269. Piazza IV Novembre. % 075-5723832. Admission: Duomo free;
Museum 3.50€ ($5.60). Open: Mon–Sat 7 a.m.–12:45 p.m. and 4–7:45 p.m., Sun 
7 a.m.–1 p.m. and 4–7 p.m.; Museum Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–1 p.m. and 2:30–5:30 p.m.
Closed Jan 1 and 6; Aug 15; Nov 1; and Dec 8 and 25.
National Gallery of Umbria
On the third floor of Palazzo dei Priori (see later in this section), this
gallery holds a splendid and rich collection of Umbrian art stretching from
the 13th to the 19th centuries. In our opinion the most enjoyable of all
Italian museums, it is strong in late-medieval/early-Renaissance art, docu-
menting the important phase during which Giotto and Cimabue revolu-
tionized painting techniques. The treasures are too numerous to list here:
five unique 13th-century sculptures by Arnolfo di Cambio, several paint-
ings by Perugino, a Madonna and Child by Gentile da Fabriano, the
Polyptych of San Domenico masterpiece of Beato Angelico, the famous
(and stunning) Piero della Francesca Polyptych of Sant’Antonio, and much
more. Set aside about two hours for your visit.
See map p. 269. Palazzo dei Priori, Corso Vannucci 19. % 075-5721009. www.
gallerianazionaleumbria.it. Admission: 6.50€ ($10). Open: Tues–Sun 
8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Oratorio di San Bernardino
Built in 1452 and designed by Agostino di Duccio, this shrine is a delight-
ful Renaissance masterpiece. The facade is a delicate carving of multicol-
ored marble, with intricate reliefs illustrating the life of the saint. A
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
272

paleo-Christian sarcophagus (fourth century) was recycled as the altar.
Allow 30 to 45 minutes for your visit.
See map p. 269. Piazza San Francesco al Prato, at the end of Via dei Priori. % 075-
5733957. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 8:30 a.m.–12:30 p.m. and 3:30–5:30 p.m.
Palazzo dei Priori and Fontana Maggiore
This striking travertine building with white-and-red marble inlays is one
of the finest examples of Gothic architecture in Italy. Built between 1298
and 1353, this palazzo was created as the seat of the government. The
main portal — accessible by a wide semicircular staircase — is off-center
in the facade; it leads to the spacious Hall of the Notables (Sala dei
Notari), a Romanesque architectural marvel supported by 12 arches. The
two bronzes over the door represent a griffin and a lion, the symbols of
Perugia. You can visit the palazzo’s frescoed rooms, some of which house
the National Gallery of Umbria (see earlier in this section).
The building opens onto the elegant Piazza IV Novembre; once a Roman
reservoir, it is graced by the splendid Fontana Maggiore, a Gothic mas-
terpiece carved by the famous Pisan sculptors Nicola and Giovanni Pisano.
Carved from white and pink marble, it has been called the most beautiful
fountain in the world. Its 24 sides bear elegant allegorical panels repre-
senting each month of the year and the signs of the zodiac. Off the piazza
is a typical medieval street, Via Maestà delle Volte, a vaulted covered pas-
sage. Schedule a few hours to take it all in.
See map p. 269. Piazza IV Novembre. % 075-5772339. Admission: Free. Open:
Summer daily 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–7 p.m.; winter Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–7 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
 The Rocca Paolina (Piazza Italia and Via Masi; % 075-5725778;
Admission: 1€/$1.60) was a grandiose fortress designed by the
famous architect Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, and built in 1540
by Pope Paul III (hence the name) on top of medieval and earlier
structures. (You can still see an arch from the original Etruscan city
walls, the Porta Marzia from the second century B.C.). The upper
part of the Rocca was demolished in 1860, but the lower sections
were preserved. The archaeological site has now been excavated,
and free guided tours — occasionally offered in English — bring it
all to life (reservations required). The museum is open daily in
April and August, Tuesday to Sunday April through October (10
a.m.–1:30 p.m. and 2:30–6 p.m.), and Tuesday to Sunday November
through March (11 a.m.–1:30 p.m. and 2:30–5 p.m.).
 The imposing complex of the church and convent of San Domenico
was begun in the 13th century and progressively enlarged over the
following two centuries. In the 18th century, the monastery was
turned into an archaeology museum — now the National Archaeo-
logical Museum of Umbria (Piazza Giordano Bruno 10; % 075-
5727141; www.archeopg.arti.beniculturali.it; Admission:
4€/$6.40; Open: Mon 2:30–7:30 p.m.; Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.;
Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 273

Closed: Jan 1 and Dec 25). Its findings include a travertine stone
with the longest inscription in the Etruscan language ever found.
The Etruscan-Roman section also includes jewelry, funerary urns,
statues, and other objects. The visit will take you about an hour.
 Chosen as the seat of the Eurochocolate fair in October, Perugia 
is famous for its chocolate manufacturers. King of all is Perugina,
the creator of world-famous Baci (“kisses”) — the hazelnut-and-
chocolate bonbons wrapped in silver-and-blue foil. You can take a
free tour at the Perugina Factory Museum (San Sisto, 6km/3 miles
west of the city center; % 075-52761, or % 075-5276796 for reser-
vations; www.perugina.it; Admission: Free; Open: Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–
1 p.m. and 2–5:30 p.m., Mar–Sept also Sat 9 a.m.–1 p.m.). In town,
you can buy some of the most delicious chocolates at Talmone
(Via Maestà delle Volte 10; % 075-5725744).
 Perugia is positively afire during the world-famous Umbria Jazz
Festival (% 075-5721003 or 800-462311 in Italy; www.umbriajazz.
com). The concerts, featuring some of the best international names,
take place during two weeks in July. You need to make reservations
well in advance for the most popular performances. You can even
participate in special jazz clinics organized during the event.
 Come dusk, all Perugia meets along Corso Vannucci for a stroll, a
gelato, an aperitivo, and perhaps a visit to one of the osterie and
clubs dotting the narrow alleys nearby. One of the most popular
spots is Zibaldone (Via Cesare Battisti 4; % 075-5735567; www.
zibaldone.org), with a cocktail bar, a restaurant, and a small
Liberty-style theater featuring live music, from chamber to jazz.
The club opens at 7 p.m.

Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 275
Assisi
The hometown of St. Francis, Assisi is famous around the world for its
art and religious monuments. Many of its visitors are pilgrims who come
to honor the humble man who was said to speak to animals and who cre-
ated the Franciscan order. Indeed, visiting Assisi is somewhat of a mysti-
cal experience. The small town is remarkably beautiful, built in pink
stone on the top of a steep hill, and sparklingly clean now that all has
been restored after the severe damage of the 1997 earthquake. Luckily,
the town’s monuments and most of its masterpieces were spared,
although some of the frescoes were irreplaceably lost.
Assisi is only a small town of about 3,000 souls, though millions flock
here every year. You can easily visit it on a day trip from Florence or
Rome, but won’t regret an overnight stay.
Getting there
Taking a bus is the easiest way to get to Assisi: The bus station is in
Piazza Matteotti, only steps from the Duomo and the center of town.
APM (% 800-512141 or 075-506781; www.apmperugia.it) runs regular
service from Perugia (Piazza Partigiani) for 3.10€ ($5); SULGA (% 800-
099661 or 075-5009641; www.sulga.it) operates buses from Rome 
(a three-hour trip) and Florence (a two-and-a-half-hour trip) for about
20€ ($32) round-trip.
Renting a car allows you to visit the attractions outside town without
having to walk or use the shuttle bus; but since Assisi is mostly closed
to traffic (you can drive through some of the streets, but not park there),
you have to leave your car in one of the two parking lots at either end of
town (about 12€/$19 per day; open 7 a.m.–9 p.m.). These lots fill quickly
with cars and tourist buses; in high season, you may have to park in
Santa Maria degli Angeli — a village 6km (33⁄4 miles) from Assisi — and
take a shuttle bus. Assisi is only 27km (17 miles) from Perugia on SS3;
from Florence or Rome, pass through Perugia (see directions, earlier)
and follow the signs for Assisi.
The nearest train station is in Santa Maria degli Angeli, which is well
connected to Assisi by taxis and a shuttle bus that departs every half-
hour. Trains (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) arrive frequently to
Assisi from all major destinations. It’s a direct 25-minute trip from

Perugia or Spoleto, though you may need to change trains if you’re
coming from Rome or Florence; the trip takes less than three hours from
those destinations and costs about 15€ ($24).
Spending the night
It used to be that if you wanted modern standards, you had to stay in
the new but charmless hotels of Santa Maria degli Angeli. While that
remains a good option — since many hotels in Assisi are still cheap
accommodations catering to bus loads of pilgrims — you can now find
more than a few comfortable choices right in town. Book early if you’re
planning to come for the Feast of St. Francis (Oct 3–4) or the
Calendimaggio (first weekend after May 1).

Piazza San Francesco/Piazza del Comune
Located midway between Assisi’s major attractions, this is a great new
hotel — family run with efficiency and modern spirit. Housed in a historic
building, it offers pleasant public spaces with red marble floors and arched
ceilings, along with spacious guest rooms of all different configurations.
There are even a few rooms with a loft, good for families. Bathrooms are
modern and generally good-sized (some with tubs and others with show-
ers), but a couple are tiny. Most rooms have grand views, as does the
romantic Il Frantoio, the highly recommended restaurant here (daily noon
to 2:15 p.m. and 7–9:15 p.m.).

the Fontebella Hotel (see earlier in this chapter).
Buca di San Francesco

UMBRIAN
In the center of town, this restaurant is set in a medieval building with a
cellar that goes back to Roman times. The seasonal menu focuses on local
traditions, including such hard-to-find specialties as the piccione
all’Assisana (slow-roasted pigeon with herbs, olives, and capers). The wine
list is excellent and the garden terrace provides pleasant outdoor dining.

UMBRIAN/PIZZA
This is a really good pizzeria, run by Naples expats who cook perfect

Exploring Assisi
The Franciscan monks give tours (some in English) of the order’s major
sites, including parts of the St. Francis Basilica and of the Eremo delle
Carceri; sign up at the office just outside the entrance to the lower basil-
ica on the left, in Piazza Inferiore di San Francesco (% 075-8190084; Fax:
075-8155208; www.sanfrancescoassisi.org). Tours last about an hour
and take place Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon and 2 to
5:30 p.m. (winter to 4:30 p.m.). They’re free, but you should make a
donation since the order exists only on alms.
If you’d like a more complete tour, contact the Tourist Guide Association,
at Via Dono Doni 18b (% 075-815228; Fax: 075-815229; www.assoguide.
it), or the Guides Cooperative at the Infotourist Point in Perugia (Piazza
Partigiani 3b; % 075-5757; Fax: 075-5727235; www.guideinumbria.com).
You can buy a combination ticket for the Rocca and the Roman 
Forum Museum (and one other attraction) for 4.50€ ($7.20), valid for
seven days.
Some of Assisi’s streets are quite steep: Wear stable shoes and be pre-
pared to use the shuttle bus or a taxi if you get tired.
The top attractions
Basilica di San Francesco
Begun in 1228 to house the bones of St. Francis, the basilica is actually two
churches, one on top of the other, and a truly majestic sight. You access
the Lower Basilica from a splendid Gothic portal and enter the main nave
with the first cycle of frescoes on Francis’s life; off the sides open several
chapels, among them the Cappella della Maddalena (third on the right),
frescoed by Giotto and his helpers. You find more of his work in the apse
and the right transept. The left transept is all decorated by the Sienese
master Pietro Lorenzetti, including his beautiful Crucifixion and Deposition.
A set of stairs descends to the crypt, where St. Francis’s coffin is exposed
ever since being rediscovered in the 19th century. The Upper Basilica con-
tains Cimabue’s work, including his dramatic Crucifixion in the left
transept, and Giotto’s celebrated cycle of frescoes on the life of the saint
in the main nave (now believed to have been painted by several artists),
including St. Francis Preaching to the Birds. The 1997 earthquake endan-
gered the very structure of the church and monastery, and destroyed
some frescoes beyond repair (in the Upper Basilica), but through the gen-
erosity of donors all over the world, the ambitious schedule of repairs was
completed in time for the Papal Jubilee in 2000. Most of the damaged fres-
coes were reassembled from the immense puzzles of thousands of pieces.

Basilica di Santa Chiara
Simple, powerful, and full of grace, this basilica is a beautiful building in
alternating stripes of pink and white stone, with a huge rose window on
its facade. Inside, it is divided in two: To the right is the Chapel of the
Crucifix, with the crucifix that miraculously spoke to St. Francis and led
him to start on his difficult path in the face of family, church, and society.
To the left is the main church, with another 14th-century crucifix over the
altar. On the left wall is a gate closing off the Chapel of the Saint
Sacrament; you can still look through it to admire the beautiful stained-
glass windows. Stairs lead to the lower church, built in the 19th century in
neo-Gothic style to honor the remains of the saint. Only some of the
church’s original frescoes remain, but those are beautiful, particularly in
the apse of the main nave.
See map p. 277. Piazza di Santa Chiara. % 075-812282. Admission: By donation. Open:
Daily 6:30 a.m. to noon and 2–6 p.m. (daylight saving time until 7 p.m.).
Duomo di San Rufino
Though overshadowed by the other attractions in town, this cathedral has
a splendid Romanesque facade with three portals and delicate carvings
and decorations. The interior was redone in the 16th century and is richly
decorated with paintings, frescoes, and sculptures. In the apse is a mag-
nificent wooden carved choir. More artwork — mostly detached from the
cathedral during the various renovations — is kept in the museum, while
the crypt holds some ancient Roman and early Christian artifacts. The
superb Romanesque bell tower was built over an ancient Roman cistern,
which you can visit from inside the church and museum.

St. Francis and St. Clare
San Francesco was born in 1182 to a wealthy merchant family and died in 1226 in a
simple hut. How he traversed the social scale and caused a revolution in Christianity
is a remarkable story. In 1209, after a reckless youth and even imprisonment, Francis
experienced visions that led him to sell his father’s cloth and give away the proceeds.
He tried to follow the Bible literally and live the life of Christ, publicly renouncing 
his inheritance and rejecting wealth absolutely (this didn’t endear him to the rich
medieval church hierarchy). Two years before his death, he received the stigmata on
a mountaintop — this and other scenes from his life were popular subjects for painters
of the late medieval period and the Renaissance. Santa Chiara was his mystic sister
who followed his teachings. Canonized in 1255, she was the founder of the order of
the Poor Clares, with strict rules of simplicity similar to the Franciscan order. Chiara
left her family to follow St. Francis, abandoning wealth and worldly pretensions as he
did and cutting off her hair to symbolize her renunciation of the world. A number of
miracles are attributed to her, one of which, a vision, led to her being proclaimed the
patron saint of TV (saints don’t get asked whether they want these honors).

Piazza del Comune
The heart of Assisi’s civil life is also a wonderful example of medieval and
ancient Roman architecture. The medieval buildings that surround the
piazza were built over the Roman ones (this was the town’s Forum at
Roman times), and you can still see the Corinthian columns of the Temple
of Minerva, from the first century B.C. Probably the best-preserved Roman
temple in Italy after the Pantheon, it was converted into a church by early
Christians and eventually given a baroque interior (Admission: Free; Open:
Mon–Tues and Thurs–Sat 7:15 a.m.–7:30 p.m., Wed 7:15 a.m.–2 p.m. and
5:15–7:30 p.m., Sun 8 a.m.–7:15 p.m.). Adjoining the temple is the 13th-
century tower built by the Ghibellines. From the nearby Roman Forum
Museum (Via Portica 2, off Piazza del Comune; % 075-813053; www.
sistemamuseo.it; Admission: 3.50€/$5.60), you can access the archaeo-
logical excavations under the piazza. The site is open daily 10 a.m. to 1
p.m.; March to May and September to October also 2:30 to 6 p.m.;
November to February also 2 to 5 p.m.; and June to August also 2:30 to 7

Corso Mazzini, Via San Rufino, and Via Portica.
Rocca Maggiore
Rebuilt by Cardinal Albornoz in the 14th century, when the papacy sub-
dued Assisi and brought the area under Vatican rule, this is an impressive
fortress dominating the town. Recently restored — it survived the 1997
quake, only to be damaged by lightning in 2000 — it is well worth the climb
(you can also drive here from outside the town walls) to enjoy the fabulous
views of the walls, the town, and the surrounding valley. The foundations
go back to Etruscan and Roman times, and you can visit the corridors and
main halls inside.
See map p. 277. Via della Rocca, from Via Porta Perlici, off Piazza San Rufino. % 075-
812033. www.sistemamuseo.it. Admission: 2€ ($3.20). Open: Daily 9 a.m.–7 p.m.
Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
More cool things to see and do
 In nearby Santa Maria degli Angeli (6km/31⁄2 miles from Assisi), the
Basilica della Porziuncola (% 075-8051430; www.porziuncola.
org; Open: Daily 6:15 a.m.–12:30 p.m. and 2:30–7:30 p.m.) is a
grandiose church containing — bell tower and all — another
church: the diminutive Porziuncola, the first Franciscan church,
where Santa Chiara was ordered by San Francesco in 1211 and
Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 281

where he died in 1226. The basilica was built over the older one
between 1569 and 1679 and is graced by a superb cupola. Churches
and the museum have a collection of frescoes and paintings from
the 14th to the 18th centuries. Admission is by voluntary donation.
 If you want to partake of the silence of Mount Subasio and visit the
hermitage where St. Francis retired to meditate and pray, we rec-
ommend the pleasant walk (4km/21⁄2 miles east of Assisi, out from
Porta Cappuccini) to the Eremo delle Carceri (% 075-812301;
www.assisiofm.org). Several of his miracles occurred here, and
you can visit the ancient tree believed to be the one where he
preached his sermon to the birds, and the dried-out stream he qui-
eted because its noise was interrupting his prayers. Even if you are
not a believer, the walk in the selva (free admission; open June–Aug
9:30–12:30 and 3:30–6:30) is uplifting. You can also stroll or hike on
the marked trails in the park (free admission). The Eremo is acces-
sible by taxi or minibus. Admission is by donation; it’s open daily 
9 a.m. to noon and 2:30–5:30 p.m. (during daylight saving time,
closes at 6:30 p.m.).

Spoleto
Built in the shadow of an imposing fortress and surrounded by olive
groves, green hills, and beautiful mountains, Spoleto is one of Umbria’s
most picturesque towns. Founded by the local population of the Umbri
in pre-Roman times, the city valiantly resisted the advances of Hannibal
during the Roman period and later became a summer resort for wealthy
Romans. Devastated by the black plague and an earthquake in the Middle
Ages, Spoleto remained a coveted prize fought over by Perugia and the
papacy.
Today, this jewel of the Umbrian hills is renowned for its music and cul-
ture. Though small enough to be visited as a day trip (four to five hours
will suffice to see the sights), it’s also a wonderful place to spend some
extra time, especially during one of its art and music festivals.
Getting there
Spoleto is well connected by train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) to
all major destinations. There’s direct and frequent service from Assisi
and Perugia, whereas you may need to change trains if you’re coming
from Rome (a one-and-a-half-hour trip, about 15€/$24) and Florence (a
three-hour trip, about 19€/$30). Trains arrive at Spoleto’s Stazione FS,
on Piazza Polvani (% 0743-48516), across the river Tessino to the north
of the city’s center. The station is well connected to the town by bus
(line A, B, C, or D).
You can also get here by bus from Perugia. SIT (% 0743-212211) has
two daily runs; the 90-minute trip costs about 7€ ($11).
By car, Spoleto lies about 130km (80 miles) from Rome on the Flaminia
(SS3), the scenic but narrow consular road heading north from Rome. A
faster possibility is the A1; you exit at Orte and take the superstrada for
Terni (follow the directions for Terni). The superstrada merges back into
SS3 right after Terni; then just follow the directions for Spoleto.
Spending the night
Note that hotel reservations for the Spoleto Festival (see p. 41) are
made as much as a year in advance, so plan ahead if you’d like to attend.
Hotel Gattapone
$$
Rocca
Named after the architect who built the Rocca Albornoziana (see “More
cool things to see and do,” later in this section), this hotel is one of our
favorites in Spoleto. Its two 17th-century buildings dominate the town from
a splendid location on the side of the Rocca, a short (uphill) distance from
the center. The well-appointed guest rooms are spacious, all with views
and modern bathrooms.

Exploring Spoleto
The top attractions
A medieval town built over a Roman one, Spoleto is a uniquely pictur-
esque sight in itself. Strolling its steep alleys lined with palazzi and
churches would be enough to fill your visit.
Duomo (Santa Maria Assunta)
This 12th-century Romanesque cathedral has a majestic facade, graced by
a 1207 mosaic by Solsterno depicting Christ in typical Byzantine style. Its
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
286

spectacular view overlooks the Duomo and its piazza. The bell tower was
pieced together using stone looted from Roman temples. The church’s
interior, refurbished in the 17th century, still has the original mosaic floor
in the central nave. In a niche at the entrance is the bronze bust of Urban
VIII by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Among all the treasures inside, the most
important are in the apse, which was decorated in the 15th century with
great Filippo Lippi frescoes, including the brooding and powerful Morte
della Vergine (Death of the Virgin Mary). The final concert of the Spoleto
Festival is held every year in the piazza in front of the Duomo.
See map p. 285. Piazza del Duomo. Admission: Free. Open: Summer daily 8 a.m.–
1 p.m. and 3–6:30 p.m.; winter daily 8 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–5:30 p.m.
Roman Theater and Archaeological Museum
This theater dates back to the first years of the Roman Empire and is one
of numerous visible vestiges of ancient Rome in Spoleto. Uncovered by a
local archaeologist under Piazza della Libertà at the end of the 19th cen-
tury, it was excavated in the 1950s. The museum has interesting archaeo-
logical findings from the area, including some sculptures and the famous
Lex Spoletina (set of tablets bearing the carved law protecting the sacred
wood of Monteluco nearby). East of the theater is the first-century Arco di
Druso (Via Arco di Druso), once the monumental arched entry to the
Forum (now Piazza del Mercato).
See map p. 285. Via Sant’Agata 18, Piazza della Libertà. % 0743-223277. www.
archeopg.arti.beniculturali.it. Admission: 4€ ($6.40). Open: Daily 
8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.
Spoleto Festival
Also known as the Festival dei Due Mondi (Festival of Two Worlds), the
Spoleto Festival was created by Gian Carlo Menotti in 1958 as a way to
bring together the best of “two worlds,” Europe and America. Now a two-
week festival from late June to early July, it attracts major international
artists in a variety of disciplines, including theater, dance, music, and
cinema. Performances are held all over town, but the most important are
held outdoors in the Teatro Romano (Piazza della Libertà; % 0743-
223419), the Rocca, and the scenic Piazza del Duomo; and indoors in the
Teatro Nuovo (Via Filetteria 1; % 0743-223419) and the Teatro Caio
Melisso (Piazza del Duomo; % 0743-222209).
Box office: Piazza del Duomo 8, or buy tickets online. % 800-565600 in Italy, or
0743-220-320. Fax: 0743-220-321. www.spoletofestival.it. Once in Spoleto,
you can also get tickets at the Teatro Nuovo. Tickets: 8€–50€ ($13–$80), depending
on the event.
More cool things to see and do
If you have a bit more time and the steep streets have not tired you out,
here are a few more choices.
Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 287

 If you stroll along Via del Ponte out of town, you rapidly reach the
famous Ponte delle Torri, an impressive bridge and aqueduct over
a deep gorge dating probably from the 13th century. Its ten elegant
arches — 76m (250 ft.) high — are a unique sight.
 Rocca Albornoziana (Piazza Campello 1; % 0743-43707; www.
spoletopermusei.it; Admission: 6.50€/$10; Open: Sept 15–Nov 1
and Apr 1–June 10 Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–7 p.m., Sat–Sun 
10 a.m.–7 p.m.; June 11–Sept 15 daily 10 a.m.–8 p.m.; Nov 1–Mar 31
Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–12:30 p.m. and 3–5 p.m., Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.)
was built as a fortress in the 14th century and used as a prison
from 1817 until 1983. After lengthy restorations, the Rocca now
houses the National Museum of Spoleto, plus an exhibition hall
and theater.
 Among the several pleasant small churches in town, the fifth-
century Chiesa di San Pietro is well worth the detour for its
Romanesque facade decorated with splendid bas-reliefs.

Part V
Venice and the Best
of the Pianura
Padana

In this part . . .
H
ow often have you heard people say, “Oh, Venice . . . it
just isn’t like any other place”? Well, after you’re here,
you’ll see how true this is — and how difﬁcult it can be to 
ﬁnd words to fully describe this unique destination. Venice,
arguably the world’s most romantic city, is a city of water —
beguiling, mesmerizing, relaxing — where you’ll never hear an
automobile (though the growling diesel motors of boats are
never very far away). The artistic and cultural inﬂuence of
Venice has also spread to the surrounding region of the
Pianura Padana, whose towns offer many splendid sights.
In Chapter 16, we take you through the watery roads and
alleys of Venice and the most interesting of the nearby lagoon
islands. In Chapter 17, we introduce you to the Pianura
Padana’s other three important art cities: Padua and Verona,
with their rich endowment of beauties and treasures, and
Milan, the business and industrial capital of Italy.

N
o description of Venice can prepare you for the enchantment of
this city. The elegant private palazzi lining the canals bear witness
to a past of tremendous wealth, power, and culture that is truly a magnif-
icent human achievement. People have been calling Venice a dead city
for a century and a half ( Henry James wrote, “She exists only as a bat-
tered peep-show and bazaar” ( but the grand dame is alive and kicking.
The historic district of Venice counts 70,000 residents, though they are
slowly dwindling due to issues of urban planning: While tourism is an
important economic asset, the city is completely overtaken by tourists.
On weekends and in the high season, the historic district receives 50,000
visitors daily on average. To curb the problem, local authorities are con-
sidering establishing a daily maximum number of visitors allowed in
Venice’s historic district, but at press time, it had not yet been decided.
And yet . . . Canal Grande after sunset, Piazza San Marco early in the
morning, the Gallerie dell’Accademia, the Lagoon, the Canaletto skies,
the stillness beneath the hubbub . . . Fellow tourists may be a nuisance
when you are trying to take a romantic picture of Piazza San Marco (try
around 4 a.m.) and when you have to compete for a reasonably priced
hotel room, but the charm of Venice is not really diminished. Venice’s
famous serenity (the republic was called La Serenissima, the “serene
one”) is as seductive as ever. Even cranky Henry James succumbed to
Venice’s charm and conceded, “The only way to care for Venice as she
deserves it is to give her a chance to touch you often ( to linger and
remain and return.”
If you can linger and remain, a week in Venice would be time well spent;
if you are on a schedule, you can see the highlights in two days.

Getting There
Regardless of how you arrive, remember to pack light: Unless your hotel
has water access, you have to carry your luggage from the closest water-
way to the door of your accommodations.
By air
Small but not too small, Venice’s Aeroporto Marco Polo (% 041-
2609260; www.veniceairport.it), 10km (61⁄4 miles) north of the town
center, receives daily flights from most Italian and other European 
destinations:
 Getting oriented at the airport: The airport is well organized and
very easy to get around, as it has only one terminal. An ATM, a cur-
rency-exchange counter, and a tourist information desk are in the
main concourse of the arrivals area.
 Navigating your way through passport control and Customs:
You’ll probably arrive in Venice via a connecting flight from another
Italian or European airport, which means that you’ve already cleared
Customs. If your connecting flight originated in a country outside
the Schengen European Community, then you have to line up for
passport control before going to baggage claim. After picking up
your checked bags, you go through Customs. Here you find two
gates: one for those who have something to declare (above the
standard allowance), and one for those who don’t.
 Getting from the airport to your hotel: From the airport, you can
reach the city by either bus or water. Fast and easy but expensive,
a water taxi will take you directly to your hotel (or to the closest
possible landing), but will cost between 98€ and 120€ ($157–$192)
for two to four persons depending on the distance. You can make
reservations in advance with Venice Welcome (% 041-717273;
www.venicewelcome.com/servizi/taxi/watertaxi.htm) 
or the cooperative Motoscafi Venezia (% 041-5222303; www.
motoscafivenezia.it). Motoscafi Venezia maintains a desk at 
the airport, inside the terminal at arrivals; they also offer a cheaper
water shuttle service, which takes up to ten passengers to drop off
points that are convenient to most destinations. Cheaper still are
the larger water shuttles run by Alilaguna (% 041-2401701; www.
alilaguna.it): 12€ ($19) per person for the 50-minute ride to 
San Marco and other stops in the historic district. If you are on a
budget, you can take the ATVO shuttle bus (% 041-5205530; www.
atvo.it) which runs hourly to Piazzale Roma, Venice’s car termi-
nal on the mainland, for 3€ ($4.80) per person. The trip takes about
20 minutes and you can then take a vaporetto (the local water bus,
see later in this chapter) or walk to your hotel.
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
292

By train
Venice is well connected by rail (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it). The
fastest trains get you to Venice in about four and a half hours from
Rome, in just under three hours from Florence, and in three and a half
hours from Milan. A one-way ticket from Rome costs about 40€ ($64),
depending on the category of train you choose.
Venice’s train station is called Santa Lucia; its mainland rail hub is
Mestre. Choose a direct train to Santa Lucia if you want to avoid switch-
ing in Mestre to a local shuttle train for the ten-minute trip to Santa
Lucia. Santa Lucia is centrally located in the historic district of Venice:
the ticket booth for the vaporetto (water bus, see later in this chapter),
as well as a water taxi stand are just outside the station.
By car
Venice is off autostrada A4, 530km (327 miles) from Rome, 266km (165
miles) from Milan, and 243km (151 miles) from Florence; take the exit
marked VENEZIA and get on SS11 toward the long scenic bridge — Ponte
della Libertà — that connects the mainland to Piazzale Roma, Venice’s
car terminal in the historic district. Visitors are encouraged to leave
their cars in the cheaper long-term parking lots on the mainland. The
parcheggi scambiatori — parking lots near the highway — are free, but
you need to switch to a bus and it may be cumbersome.
At a number of parking lots you can make reservations in advance — 
an excellent idea during high season — for a service fee of 3€ ($4.80). In
the town of Mestre, 24-hour parking will cost you 10€ ($16) at the ASM
Garage of Piazzale Candiani (% 041-2727211; www.asmvenezia.it)
and at the Parking Stazione (Viale Stazione 10; % 041-938021; www.
sabait.it); you pay 15€ ($24) at Interparking (% 041-5207555; www.
veniceparking.it for reservations) on the island of Tronchetto (turn
right at the end of the bridge; the island is due to be connected by a 
cool monorail to Piazzale Roma); while you pay 24€ ($38) at the ASM
Garage of Piazzale Roma (see above) and 28€ ($45) at Garage San
Marco (% 041-5232213; www.garagesanmarco.it) in Piazzale Roma.
By ship
For most of its history, Venice was accessible only by water since the
bridge to the mainland — Ponte della Libertà — was not built until 1846.
Getting to Venice by ship is a unique experience, but it’s rare nowadays,
unless you are ferrying from Greece or Croatia. Several international
lines offer cruises to Venice — your travel agent can help you sort
through the options — but the Marine Terminal (Stazione Marittima;
% 041-2403000; www.vtp.it) in the historic district is usually a mini-
mum of a month away from most international ports of call. You can
Chapter 16: Venice 293

then board the cool new monorail to Piazzale Roma (scheduled to open
by late 2008) or pick your choice of water taxi or water shuttle (see ear-
lier in this chapter), or vaporetto (see later in this chapter).
Orienting Yourself in Venice
The city of Venice comprises three major areas: the historic district, a
cluster of several islands linked by numerous bridges; the Terraferma, a
modern development on the mainland which includes Mestre — where a
large part of the city’s population actually lives; and the Laguna (Lagoon),
stretching from the Adriatic Sea to the mainland and including the larger
islands of Lido and Murano, among others.
Made up of more than 100 islands linked by 354 bridges over 177 canals,
the historic district can be quite confusing to the uninitiated. It is
divided into sestieri (a sestiere is a sixth of the city), each made up of
several small islands, divided by canals — Venice’s “streets” — crossed
by small bridges. The central canal — Canal Grande — divides the city
with its reversed “S” shape, leaving three sestieri on each side: San
Marco, Cannaregio, and Castello de citra (“this side” of the canal); and
Dorsoduro, San Polo, and Santa Croce de ultra (“the far side”). This 
was the city’s major thoroughfare and is still lined with elegant palazzi,
which belonged to the most important and wealthiest families and mer-
chant groups. It is crossed by three bridges: the Ponte dell’Accademia
between San Marco and Dorsoduro, the famous Ponte di Rialto between
San Marco and San Polo, and the Ponte degli Scalzi between Santa Lucia
train station and Santa Croce. San Marco is in the center; to the north,
you find first San Polo, then Santa Croce, and finally Cannaregio; to the
east is Castello, and to the west and south, Dorsoduro. Santa Croce is
connected to the mainland through Ponte della Libertà; this is where
you find the Santa Lucia train station, the car terminal in Piazzale
Roma, and the Marine Terminal.
Introducing the neighborhoods
The historic district has no “bad neighborhoods,” but each sestiere has
its own individual flavor. Below we highlight the pros and cons of each.
Cannaregio
An authentic neighborhood where locals still live and work, this area is
home to no-frills restaurants, a bit of nightlife (toward the Canal Grande),
and a number of moderately priced hotels. Tourist traffic is along only
the stretch between San Marco and the Santa Lucia train station. The
painter Tintoretto was born here, near the Madonna dell’Orto church,
not far from the Ghetto. Other attractions include Ca’ d’Oro along the
Canal Grande. The Fondamenta Nuove vaporetto station is also where
you can board a boat destined for the islands of Murano, Burano, and
Torcello.

Castello
Little spoiled by tourist crowds, this is our favorite sestiere in Venice.
Behind the grandiose promenade of Riva degli Schiavoni (in high season,
crawling with tourists), with its unique views of the bay of San Marco
and its expensive hotels and restaurants, you find the development of an
authentic working district. It’s crossed by Via Garibaldi, one of the few
real streets in town (actually a paved-over canal), lined with neighbor-
hood shops, osterie, and an outdoor market. You also find the Basilica
dei Santi Giovanni e Paolo and the Arsenale (Naval Armory). Farther
to the east are the Giardini Pubblici — very nice public gardens with a
playground — which every other year play host to the International
Film Festival and the famous international art show, the Biennale di
Venezia.
Dorsoduro
This artsy neighborhood is where the university is located, together
with some famous attractions — Gallerie dell’Accademia, Ca’ Rezzonico,
the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Santa Maria della Salute — and many
interesting small restaurants, along with a few simpler hotels. Crowds
cluster around the Accademia in high season and on weekends, but all in
all, this neighborhood is far less crowded than San Marco. In the evening,
locals and visitors alike head for the beautiful promenade of the Zattere,
famous for its outdoor cafes. This area also includes La Giudecca, a long
and skinny cluster of islands separated from the rest of the sestiere by
the Canale della Giudecca (second in importance after Canal Grande).
San Marco
Named after the famous Basilica, this is the heart of the historic district
and the main tourist destination, as it contains some of the major attrac-
tions in Venice: St. Mark’s Basilica, Palazzo Ducale, Ponte dei Sospiri,
Correr Museum, Palazzo Grassi, Teatro La Fenice, and the Ponte di
Rialto. Here you find lots of hotels (including some of the most expen-
sive in the city), several fabulous shops, and a few administrative 
offices — but not many locals live here. The many restaurants tend to 
be “touristy,” and the streets overcrowded. To appreciate its pictur-
esque side, explore the area at night, when the crowds have receded, 
or come in the off season.
San Polo
On the other side of Canal Grande from San Marco, this was the main
market in Venice back when Rialto was the marine terminal of the
medieval city. It is still a commercial neighborhood with many shops,
some simple restaurants, and just a few hotels. Its major attractions are
the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, the Basilica dei Frari, and Ponte di
Rialto. It gets crowded — especially around the Rialto during shopping
hours — but mostly in high season and on weekends
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
296

Santa Croce
This small borough is the least visited part of Venice, as its few interest-
ing churches and the pretty Riva di Basio promenade are little known.
To the west are the islands with the marine and car terminals; hotels and
restaurants are rare here.
Finding information after you arrive
Stop at one of these tourist information desks in town, if only to get 
the current opening hours of churches and museums — they keep
changing — and a free map:
 Aeroporto Marco Polo (% 041-5298711), arrivals main concourse;
open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
 Piazzale Roma (% 041-5298711), in the Garage ASM; open daily
from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
 Santa Lucia Train Station (% 041-5298711); open daily from 8 a.m.
to 6:30 p.m.
 San Marco all’Ascensione (% 041-5298711), at San Marco 71/F;
open daily from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
 Venice Pavillion (San Marco Ex Giardini Reali; % 041-5298711);
open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 Lido (% 041-5265711), vaporetto station; open June through
September, daily from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 3:30 to 6 p.m.
Getting Around Venice
Venice is very safe — the only real dangers are being served a bad meal
at a touristy restaurant and being overcharged for your purchases. No
matter how deserted and run-down a calle (street) may be, you can
stroll anywhere, even at night. That shouldn’t induce you, though, to do
foolish things such as display large quantities of cash or leave your
expensive camera unattended: Plenty of pickpockets are still around to
take advantage of distracted tourists in crowded areas.
You can get around Venice either on foot or by water. Venice’s canals are
the easiest way to access the houses, which is why the facades of build-
ings are on the canals, which you see plenty of small motorboats put-
putting along.
No book-sized map can give full details of the narrow calli and bridges. 
If you’re planning to do some major exploring, we recommend picking
up a detailed map — such as the smartly folded Falk map — available at
most bookstores and newsstands.
Chapter 16: Venice 297

By water
If money is not an object, a water taxi will get you there quickly. They
are available at stands near major tourist attractions or on call (for an
extra 6€/$9.60; see “Fast Facts: Venice” at the end of this chapter). The
meter starts at 8.70€ ($14) and adds 1.30€ ($2.10) every 60 seconds;
you also have to pay a surcharge of 5.50€ ($8.80) for night hours, 5.90€
($9.40) for holidays, and 1.50€ ($2.40) for each piece of luggage larger
than 50 centimeters (20 inches) per side.
Be aware of “Gypsy” water taxis that will offer you a ride. Official taxis
do not cruise around looking for passengers.
If you are on one side of Canal Grande and need to go to the other, you
can take a traghetto, a traditional skiff with two rowers. You find eight
traghetto stations along Canal Grande — San Tomà, Santa Maria del
Giglio, Dogana, Ferrovia, Rialto, San Marcuola, San Samuele, and
Santa Sofia. Stations open between 7 and 8 a.m., but only Santa Maria
del Giglio, San Tomà, and Santa Sofia run skiffs into the evening (until
between 7 and 9 p.m.); the others stop at 1 to 2 p.m. Stations are indi-
cated by the sign TRAGHETTO (the street leading to the dock is often called
Calle del Traghetto), and a ride is 0.50€ (80¢) per person. You notice
that Venetians ride standing, but we don’t recommend imitating them —
Canal Grande’s water is none too clean!
Last but not least, taking a vaporetto (% 041-2722111; www.actv.it) — 
a cross between a small barge and a ferry — can be great fun, but they
do get very crowded. Tickets are for sale at most boarding docks, as well
as at bars, tobacconists, and newsstands bearing the ACTV symbol. A
60-minute ticket valid on all lines is 6.50€ ($10; includes one piece of lug-
gage with a combined measurement of 150cm/59 inches). Provided you
ask upon boarding, you can buy the ticket onboard for the regular price.
Once onboard, all passengers must stamp their tickets at the yellow
machine. Remember to put your backpack down so you don’t disturb
your neighbors — or get pickpocketed.

Accessible Venice
The good news is that all the main attractions in Venice are accessible by water, and
getting around by vaporetto is easy for visitors with mobility challenges, as the boats
and docks have been designed to facilitate boarding. While exploring the historic dis-
trict’s streets can be tricky (due to the step bridges over the canals), accessible itin-
eraries are available at any of the tourist information points listed earlier in this chapter,
or at www.comune.venezia.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/EN/
IDPagina/1318. A few bridges have been equipped with motorized lifts (alas, we
saw a number that were out of service): You need to pick up a key at a tourist info desk.

For frequent vaporetto riders, we recommend purchasing a pass: 12 hours
for 14€ ($22), 24 hours for 16€ ($26), 36 hours for 21€ ($34), 48 hours
for 26€ ($42), and 72 hours for 31€ ($50). A transportation pass is
included with the Venice Card, and a Rolling Venice Card entitles you
to a special discount on the 72-hour pass (18€/$29 only); see “Exploring
Venice,” later in this chapter.
See the Cheat Sheet at the front of this guide for a map of Venice’s
vaporetto system.
On foot
Although it may appear daunting and mazelike, Venice actually has very
few streets. Since the historic district is made up of hundreds of tiny
islands, the narrow streets behind Venice’s canals may either stop
abruptly at the water’s edge (in which case you have to backtrack and
try the next turn) or be interconnected by bridges. Don’t feel shy about
exploring; just remember a few basic rules: Keep to your right and do
not stop and block traffic on narrow bridges (a major breach of local eti-
quette); and, by all means, wear comfortable shoes.
As you wander, look for the ubiquitous signs with arrows (sometimes a
little old, but still readable) that direct you toward major landmarks,
such as Ferrovia (the train station), Piazzale Roma (the car terminal),
Vaporetto (the nearest vaporetto stop), Rialto (the bridge), Piazza San
Marco, Accademia (the bridge), and so on.
The famous acqua alta (high tide) shouldn’t be a concern. It occurs
only occasionally between November and March (particularly high ones
are announced by a siren), and wooden platforms are placed along the
major routes. The best hotels actually lend their guests plastic boots.
Chapter 16: Venice 299
Street smarts: Venetian addresses
Even street addresses are different in Venice: There are no street numbers, only postal
addresses, therefore “2534 San Marco” and “2536 San Marco” may well be on two dif-
ferent streets (the post office has a map of buildings). That’s why all hotels and restau-
rants have small maps printed on the back of their business cards and why even
Venetians call for directions before going to an address they haven’t been to before.
Always make sure you have the name of the sestiere (borough): Venice has many
streets of the same name! You also notice that there are very few “Via”; streets here
are called calle (pronounced with a hard c) — or salizzada or calle larga if they are
larger — but also rio terà (a canal that was filled in to make a street), sottoportico
(passage under a building), and fondamenta (promenade running alongside a canal).
There’s only one piazza in Venice, and that’s Piazza San Marco — all the others are
campo or campiello.

Staying in Style
With the euro climbing sky high and thousands of fellow tourists to com-
pete against, landing a moderately priced accommodation in Venice can
be quite tricky. The historic district is small, and has only a few hundred
hotels and B&Bs. Low season is basically nonexistent, and you want to
make your reservations well in advance (the best deals are booked up 
to a year earlier, particularly for Carnival, see Chapter 3 for a calendar 
of events). You get much better rates on the island of Lido (see “Finding
more cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter). Padua is a charm-
ing town a 30-minute train ride from Venice (see Chapter 17) and a much
more desirable location than Mestre. If you arrive without a reservation,
the Hotel Association of Venice (AVA; % 041-5222264; www.veneziasi.
it) offers a free reservation service; it maintains booths at Santa Lucia
train station, at Piazzale Roma, at the airport, and at the tourist info point
along the highway on the mainland. In addition to the below, consider
the big international chains: We particularly like the Sheraton Hotel des
Bains (% 041-5265921) among the luxury hotels and the Best Western
Hotel Olimpia (% 041-711041) as a moderate choice. Note: The hotels
below have been chosen for their accessibility: either direct access by
water or only a short walk with no bridges.
The top hotels
Cipriani
$$$$
Dorsoduro
At the tip of La Giudecca — a few minutes from San Marco by free shuttle
boat — this hotel offers one of the most romantic experiences in Venice
and some of the highest rates in Europe. Housed in a 16th-century
monastery overlooking the water on three sides, and complete with clois-
ters, it offers individually decorated rooms that are sumptuous but not
overly ornate. Even the simplest double rooms with garden views are pala-
tial; all guest rooms feature elegant furnishings, quality linens, large bath-
rooms, and views. Public spaces include gardens and a heated
Olympic-size swimming pool filled with filtered saltwater. With a ratio of
two staff members per room, the service is excellent. The hotel’s restau-
rant, Fortuny, is one of the best in Italy.
See map p. 302. Isola della Giudecca 10. % 041-5207744. Fax: 041-5207745.
www.hotelcipriani.com. Vaporetto: 41, 42, or 82 to Zitelle. 870€–1,320€
($1,392–$2,112) double. Rates include full American breakfast. Children 12 and under
stay free in parent’s room. AE, DC, MC, V. Closed Nov–Mar.
Hotel Campiello
$$$
Castello
This pink 15th-century hotel, once a convent, is a bargain for the area; run
by two sisters, it offers friendly and expert service. The location is nearly
perfect, just off Riva degli Schiavoni but somewhat quieter. Guest rooms
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
300

are elegant and decorated in Liberty (Art Nouveau) or 19th-century style.
Their three apartments are great for families, with kitchenettes that have
microwave ovens; the modern bathrooms feature separate showers and
Jacuzzi tubs. The substantial buffet breakfast is served in a rather glitzy
hall.
See map p. 302. Campiello del Vin, 4647 Castello. % 041-239682. Fax: 041-5205798.
www.hotelcampiello.it. Vaporetto: 1, 5, 41, 42, 51, 52, or 82 to San Zaccaria;
walk up Calle del Vin. 250€ ($400) double; 120€–450€ ($192–$720) apartment. Rates
include buffet breakfast. AE, MC, V.
Hotel Colombina
$$$
Castello
This elegant hotel is a great addition to the Venice hotel scene, only steps
away from St. Mark’s Basilica. Once inside, you feel miles away from the
crowds outside. Guest rooms are spacious and nicely done in Venetian
style, with fine fabrics and quality reproduction furniture. The staff is
attentive and friendly. The hotel also includes an annex, the Locanda
Remedio; its guest rooms are somewhat smaller but perfectly adequate
and well appointed. Rates are lower than in the main hotel (rack rates
295€/$472). Internet specials may bring rates down by as much as 40 per-
cent.
See map p. 302. Calle del Remedio 4416 Castello. % 041-2770525. Fax: 041-2776044.
www.hotelcolombina.com. Vaporetto: 82 to San Zaccaria; walk up Calle Rasse,
turn left and immediately right on Calle Sagrestia, turn left at Campo San Zani and
continue on to Calle Remedio to the left. 395€–460€ ($632–$736) double. Rates
include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Metropole
$$$$
Castello
One of the few posh hotels on Riva degli Schiavoni that’s still family run
(the others have been bought by American chains), the Metropole offers
great service and quality for your money. From its elegant canal-side
entrance to the opulent Venetian baroque interior, from the peaceful court-
yard garden to the kindness of the staff, this hotel sets itself apart. The
romantic property includes the chapel where Vivaldi composed the Four
Seasons. Each guest room is spacious and individually furnished with bro-
cades and luxury fabrics, and period furniture that includes original
antiques; the good-sized bathrooms (all with tubs) are done in marble or
mosaic. You can get heavenly creative Venetian cuisine in the cozy and lux-
urious dining room at Met, one of the best restaurants in Italy. The beau-
tiful Mirror Hall lounge features afternoon tea with homemade pastries.
Their Internet rates offer as much as 40 percent off.
See map p. 302. Riva degli Schiavoni, 4149 Castello. % 041-5205044. Fax: 041-5223679.
www.hotelmetropole.com. Vaporetto: 1, 5, 41, 42, 51, 52, or 82 to San Zaccaria;
walk right. 500€–800€ ($800–$1,280) double. Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC,

Hotel San Cassiano Ca’ Favretto
$$$
Santa Croce
This is your chance to stay in a gorgeous 14th-century palazzo on the
Canal Grande without spending a fortune. Across from the Ca’ d’Oro and
left of the Ca’ Corner della Regina, this hotel offers spacious and bright
guest rooms in a carefully renovated former Venetian residence. The best
rooms face Canal Grande, others front a smaller canal or the courtyard.
The hotel also has a beautiful terrace overlooking the canals. Check their
Web site for discounted rates.

breakfast. AE, V.
Hotel Violino d’Oro
$$$
San Marco
This family-run boutique hotel has an excellent location, very close to San
Marco. In the 18th-century Palazzo Barozzi, it overlooks the Rio San Moisè
canal. Guest rooms are brightly decorated with stucco and fine fabrics and
Venetian-style period furniture. Some of the rooms are larger than others,
but all have Murano chandeliers and marble bathrooms (only a few with
tubs). A nice roof terrace and an attentive staff round out the perks.
Internet specials can bring down rates by over half.

La Calcina
$$
Dorsoduro
This historic pensione has been renovated to respect its simple original
style and refitted with antique furniture. This is where Victorian writer
John Ruskin stayed in 1876 when he wrote The Stones of Venice. The loca-
tion overlooking the Canale della Giudecca is both beautiful and less hectic
than the area around San Marco. The good-sized guest rooms have par-
quet floors and sometimes beamed ceilings; they are simply and sparely
furnished with antiques. In warm weather, a buffet breakfast is served on
the terrace along the canal. The hotel also has a solarium (roof terrace).
Their two apartments equipped with full kitchens are a great resource for
families (180€–240€/$288–$384).

Cannaregio
This small family-run hotel offers cozy accommodations and charming
details. Set on the top floor of a 14th-century palazzo overlooking the
Canal Grande, the guest rooms are quite large and individually decorated
with a mix of modern furnishings and period reproductions, along with a
few antiques. Bathrooms are small, but come with all the amenities. Two
of the rooms have views of the canal.

Locanda Novecento
$$$
San Marco
Only a few steps from St. Mark’s and Accademia, this delightful family-run
boutique hotel offers individual and attentive service. The theme of the
hotel is in its name — “1900” — and the décor of both the public spaces
and the sumptuous guest rooms was inspired by the famous Spanish artist
Mariano Fortuny, who worked and lived in Venice in the first half of the
20th century. The small garden — used for breakfast in good weather — is
a delight.

Campo Santa Maria del Giglio, make a right, and cross 2 bridges. 260€ ($416) double.
Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Luna Hotel Baglioni
$$$$
San Marco
One of Venice’s historic addresses, this charming hotel offers good qual-
ity and excellent service. It’s in a 13th-century former convent, and public
spaces are grand, with views over Canal Grande, and original frescoes in
the breakfast room. The more expensive rooms offer views and lots of sun-
light, while cheaper ones open onto airshafts or courtyards. Otherwise all
guest rooms are spacious and nicely appointed, with stucco and tapestry
on the walls, Murano chandeliers, elegant comfortable beds, and spacious
marble bathrooms. The restaurant on the premises is quite good. Internet
rates of more than 50 percent off can be a steal.

Palazzo Sant’Angelo
$$$$
San Marco
In Palazzo Corner-Spinelli, this newcomer hotel has a perfect location, with
a private entrance on the Canal Grande and a vaporetto stop next door, in
one of the few quiet corners of the San Marco neighborhood. The public
spaces are gorgeous — the living room has its original Palladian marble
floors — and the guest rooms are sumptuous. The spacious bathrooms,
done in green-and-white marble, have hydromassage bathtubs. The rooms
overlooking the Canal Grande are the most beautiful.

Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Pensione Accademia Villa Maravegie
$$$
Dorsoduro
In a beautiful location two steps from the Accademia, this hotel occupies
a 17th-century villa with its own gardens, a real luxury in Venice. The
whole place has a wonderfully old-fashioned feel, and public spaces are
welcoming and relaxing. The guest rooms feature pleasant 19th-century
furnishings with wooden floors and the best rooms overlook the garden.
See map p. 302. Fondamenta Bollani, 1058 Dorsoduro. % 041-5210188. Fax: 041-

turn right on Calle Corfù, left on Fondamenta Priuli, right on the first bridge, and then
right again on Fondamenta Bollani. 250€–300€ ($400–$480) double. Rates include
breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
San Clemente Palace
$$$$
San Clemente
If you don’t mind a bit of a boat ride, this is a fabulous hotel, with a whole
island to itself. San Clemente is a small island beyond La Giudecca and 
the hotel is in the grandiose former convent built on the island in the 12th
century to host pilgrims and crusaders on their way to the Holy Land; it
was enlarged during the Renaissance and further transformed during the
Austrian administration. The huge guest rooms overlook inner gardens,
the beautiful park, or the water, and some have a breathtaking view over
St. Mark’s Basilica. The rooms are opulent yet refined and have large
marble bathrooms with separate showers and tubs. Three excellent
restaurants, a swimming pool, two tennis courts, a 3-hole golf course, a
spa, and a gym complete the offerings. The complimentary ten-minute
shuttle ride to St. Mark’s on elegant wooden launches is worthy in its 
own right.

This hotel — which has been lovingly restored — is part of a new Italian
chain that has recently opened in Venice. We like their style, high standard
of service, and modernity. Only a few minutes from Ponte Rialto, the hotel
occupies a historic nobleman’s abode overlooking a canal. Guest rooms
have a stylish décor that interprets Venetian tradition in modern muted
colors to good effect. Bathrooms are good-size and modern. The chain’s
Internet rates can be as much as 70 percent off.

This hotel is a great addition to Venice’s luxury accommodations set. On
quiet Giudecca Island and connected to San Marco by ultra-new ecological
shuttles, the latest progeny of the Bauer family of hotels is a winner. The
graceful renovation has enhanced the beauty of the original property
designed by architect Andrea Palladio: a residence for unmarried women.

Chapter 16: Venice 307

Dining Out
Venice is a tricky place to eat. That’s not because the local cuisine isn’t
good — it’s delicious, especially if you like seafood, which is used in
abundance — but because so many eateries in the city are such tourist
traps. Venice is small enough that restaurants and trattorie are basically
everywhere; but good ones are hard to find, and they aren’t cheap.
When you find the right place, though, it can be heavenly. Note that all
restaurants will add a coperto (cover) charge to your bill of between 3€
and 6€ ($4.80–$9.60) and a 10 to 15 percent service charge.
There is no fishing on Sundays, thus the fish market is closed on
Mondays and the seafood you eat is from the Saturday before. On
Mondays, have meat, pasta, or pizza instead.

PIZZA
This loftlike restaurant in a former storage building is a branch of a local
restaurant focusing on quality and friendly service. The décor combines
modern touches with respect for ancient beauty — note the beamed roof
and Murano chandeliers — while the menu includes 100 different pizzas
and a choice of beers on tap, plus an extensive salad selection and a few
meat and pasta dishes. The original restaurant is at Campo San Giacomo
dall’Orio, at Calle de le Oche (Santa Croce 1552; % 041-5241161); they
also have one near the Santa Lucia train station (Rio Terra Lista Spagna,

$$$
Cannaregio
VENETIAN
This renowned restaurant is housed in a 17th-century boathouse (gondole
were repaired and stationed here), completely restored and decorated in
bright colors. The cuisine is typically Venetian, with many “turf” options
beside the “surf” ones. The oven-roasted crab is an excellent antipasto, as
are the baccalà mantecato (creamed cod) and the savory sardines. Also
very good is the risotto with basil and scallops, along with the frittura mista
(fried calamari and small fish).

menu is strictly seasonal, but you will always find our favorite: the gran

VENETIAN/SEAFOOD
Located well away from the tourist areas, this small trattoria from 1700 is

Venetian dishes.

Lunch on the go in Venice
Eating in Venice is very expensive — your wallet will welcome a little picnic break
now and then. You find many bars selling sandwiches, but we like making our own.
You find local specialties, fresh bread, and scrumptious sweets at the bakeries 
and grocery shops lining Strada Nuova in Cannaregio; nearby, on Rio Terà Santi
Apostoli (4612 Cannaregio), you find a Coop (a supermarket with mainland prices). Two
other excellent places are Via Garibaldi in Castello — where you see another Coop
supermarket — and around Campo Rialto Nuovo in San Polo, where you discover the
lively and colorful fish, produce, and flower markets. Remember that Piazza San Marco
is an open-air museum and, as such, eating on the premises is forbidden.

Antico Martini

San Marco
VENETIAN/CREATIVE
This elegant restaurant, on the site of an 18th-century cafe, is one of the
city’s best — and as such comes with a high price. Under gilded frames
and chandeliers — and on the delightful terrace in fine weather — you can
sample Venetian specialties such as the excellent veal liver with onions,
as well as innovative dishes like a wonderful torte of young artichokes and
prawns. This gourmet spot is also famous for its involtini di salmone al

ingredients; we loved the troffie alla ricotta (homemade fresh pasta with a
ricotta-based sauce) and the stuffed squid. The small courtyard is delight-
ful on summer evenings. They also rent three guest rooms decorated in
the same contemporary style (350€/$560).

Bar Pizzeria da Paolo

Castello
PIZZA/VENETIAN
This local hangout has a good location across from the Arsenale, plus cozy
dining rooms and a pleasant décor. The pizza is good, as are the local
dishes. If you dine outside, the small campo with the Arsenale and its canal
in the background are especially quiet and picturesque at night.

This simple yet elegant restaurant offers quality cuisine in a quiet neigh-
borhood — and it has a pleasant courtyard for dining alfresco. The menu

is all seasonal seafood; you should find the superb sardines marinated
with onions, and perhaps the marinated anchovies with a caper sauce,
along with homemade fresh pasta with seafood. Polenta often accompa-
nies the elaborately prepared daily catches, such as a splendid artichoke-
stuffed calamari.

Da Raffaele

San Marco
VENETIAN
Go to this canal-side restaurant for excellent fish and other specialties. If
you’re tired of seafood, try the tasty pastas and grilled meats. Everything
is reliable — which is why this place has been a major tourist magnet for
years (make a reservation). A nice plus is the terrace dining in summer.

Fiaschetteria Toscana
$$$
Cannaregio
VENETIAN
The Venetian-Tuscan marriage gave birth here to a refined cuisine, making
this one of Venice’s best restaurants. You can still get steaks in true Tuscan
style, but the traditional Venetian cuisine has taken over much of the
menu. Excellent choices include the bigoli in salsa and the spaghetti al car-
toccio ai frutti di mare (spaghetti with seafood cooked in a pouch), as well
Chapter 16: Venice 311
Taking a sweet break
Venetians definitely have a sweet tooth and make delicious pastries; you can sample
typical delights at Pasticceria Tonolo (San Pantalon, 3764 Dorsoduro; Vaporetto: San
Tomà) or Pasticceria Marchini (Spadaria, 2769 San Marco; % 041-5229109). Good
gelato (ice cream) is more difficult to find: Industrial and pretend-homemade ice cream
is sold at every corner, but it is a pale imitation of what you can have in Rome, Naples,
or heavenly Sicily. One of the best places is the hole-in-the-wall Boutique del Gelato
(Salizzada San Lio, 5727 Castello; % 041-5223283), where everything is made fresh on
the premises.

as the frittura della Serenissima (deep-fried seafood and vegetables). Leave
room for dessert, as they are homemade and delicious.

Osteria ai 4 Feri
$
Dorsoduro
VENETIAN
This modest osteria is one of those traditional, charming restaurants that
are rapidly disappearing from Venice. A real local hangout, it dishes up
simple food in an old-fashioned setting. We recommend the excellent
spaghetti with clams and the grilled fish sold by the weight, a tasty treat.

Castello
CREATIVE VENETIAN/SEAFOOD
This tiny osteria is unassuming, but serves delicious food in a simple and
friendly atmosphere. The chef creates masterly variations on traditional
recipes using the best offerings from the local fish market. We recommend
the spaghetti with clams and saffron, the asparagus and ricotta ravioli
served with scallops, and the fish filet with herbs and citrus sauce.

VENETIAN/SEAFOOD
One of the most exclusive restaurants in Venice, this is also the best. The
well-prepared dishes are made with only the freshest ingredients and are
carefully served in the subdued elegance of the two dining rooms.
Excellent choices include the spaghetti al cartoccio (cooked in a pouch);
the prawns with a lemon, tomato, and celery sauce; and the many seasonal

Osteria di Santa Marina

Castello
CREATIVE VENETIAN
This is a special restaurant in Venice, favored by local and other Italian
gourmets. Served in a warm atmosphere, the menu includes updates of
traditional dishes — such as the splendid risotto with scallops and local
shellfish — and innovative creations like the Mediterranean squid with
onion and orange peel. If it’s on the menu, end your meal with the frozen
eggnog soufflé with raspberry coulis. The three tasting menus
(40€–70€/$48–$84) are an excellent way to go.

Seafood and more seafood! In this local trattoria, you find all the bounty
the Adriatic has to offer — including some existing only in the Venetian
lagoon — masterly prepared according to tradition. The market offerings
are grilled, roasted, fried, or served with pasta, risotto, or polenta. The
moderate prices attract crowds, so be prepared for a wait.

Trattoria Tre Spiedi
$$
Cannaregio
VENETIAN
This friendly trattoria is a favorite with local families; it’s also a convenient
choice in the touristy area near Ponte di Rialto. The traditional cuisine fea-
tures a lot of fresh fish. The many spaghetti primi are excellent; for sec-
ondi, try the veal liver sautéed with onions or the eel stew, both served
with polenta.

Vecio Fritolin
$$$
Santa Croce
CREATIVE VENETIAN/SEAFOOD
Tucked away from the tourist crowds — yet in the heart of Santa Croce —
this is one of the best addresses in Venice. The small market-based menu
offers authentic food, with a strong focus on seafood. We loved the out-
standing frittura (deep-fried fish), as well as the perfect sarde in saôr (blue
fish with onions, prepared Venetian-style). The desserts are superb.
Calle della Regina, 2262 Santa Croce. % 041-5222881. www.veciofritolin.it.

Cannaregio
VENETIAN/WINE BAR
The restaurant attached to this traditional enoteca (wine bar) — still one
of the best in town — has become a favorite for both the excellent service
and the tasty food. The menu is based on traditional fare: We loved the
pasta with squid and the grilled eel. Leave room for the homemade
desserts.

Exploring Venice
To avoid the long lines at Palazzo Ducale and Accademia Galleries, pur-
chase the appropriate pass, card, or cumulative ticket (see below) at
one of the less sought-after attractions (the best is Ca’ Pesaro). Buying a
pass or card in advance will also allow you to avoid the lines at the Frari
Basilica (Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari).
Discovering the top attractions
Accademia Galleries
Dorsoduro
Rivaling Florence’s Uffizi Gallery and Rome’s Galleria Borghese, this is a
fantastic collection of paintings from the 13th through the 18th centuries.
Its 24 rooms are housed in a former church and attached monastery,

Best deals in Venice
If you’re staying in town for a few days, buying a Venice Card (% 041-2424;
www.venicecard.it) is a good idea. It’s best to buy it online before hitting Venice
since you get a discount, but it’s also available for sale at the airport, Piazzale Roma,
and the train station, as well as at all the tourist information offices and most of the
Hellovenezia ticket booths (vaporetto and public transportation). The basic three-day
transportation pass costs 38€ ($60) at a ticket booth and 34€ ($54) online; the three-
day culture and transport pass is 59€ ($94) at the ticket booth and 47€ ($75) online.
Both passes get you a welcome kit that includes a decent map, and give you access
to all public transportation, use of public bathrooms, and other discounts. The culture
card also includes a Museum Pass and a Chorus Card (see below). The card is avail-
able in a seven-day and a junior version (for ages 5–29); children under 5 are free. For
an additional fee, you can include the airport shuttle boat Alilaguna. If you’re between
the ages of 14 and 29, you can purchase the Rolling Venice Card: It gives you sub-
stantial discounts on hotels, restaurants, museums, public transportation (see earlier
in this chapter), and shops. You can get the card for 4€ ($6.40) by presenting a photo
ID at one of the tourist information points in Venice or at one of the Hellovenezia 
ticket booths. You get a kit with a map of Venice charting all the participating hotels,
restaurants, clubs, and shops, as well as a guidebook with interesting facts and smart
itineraries.
The Museum Pass (18€/$29; 12€/$19 with the Rolling Venice Card; children under 
5 free) grants you one admission to each of the 12 Civic Museums — the Palazzo
Ducale, Correr Museum, Libreria Marciana, Ca’ Rezzonico, Clock Tower, Palazzo
Mocenigo, Carlo Goldoni’s house, Ca’ Pesaro, Fortuny Museum, Natural History
Museum (with Planetarium), Murano Glass Museum, and Burano Lace Museum. The
pass is valid for six months and can be purchased at any of the participating museums.
If you are a family group of two adults and at least two children, you can take advan-
tage of the family ticket offered by the Civic Museums: you pay one regular admis-
sion and reduced admission for all the others in your group (usually about 30 percent
off). It is effective for the Museum Pass (you pay only 12€/$19) as well as for admis-
sion to individual museums.
The Chorus Card (% 041-2740462; www.chorusvenezia.org) gives you access to
16 churches in Venice — including Frari Basilica and Chiesa del Redentore (see later
in this chapter). It costs 9€ ($14). A family version, for two adults and two children 11
to 18, goes for 18€ ($29). The pass is valid for one year and is for sale at all partici-
pating churches (avoid Frari as lines there are always long) and at the Venice Pavilion
tourist office.
A combination ticket for the Ca’ d’Oro, Museo Orientale in Ca’ Pesaro, and Accademia
Galleries is available for 11€ ($18); you can purchase it at the ticket booth of any of the
three museums.

associations. The complex also houses Venice’s Academy of Fine Arts.
You can follow the development of art from the medieval period to the
Renaissance through the galleries, while also walking through the history
of Venetian art.
In room 1, you find the luminous, influential works of Veneziano, still very
medieval in feeling. Then you pass into the totally different world of the
15th century, marked by greater naturalism, fuller figures, and the intro-
duction of perspective. For example, Jacopo Bellini’s Madonna and Child
shows the figures in three-quarter view rather than head-on, giving an inti-
mate feeling. In succeeding rooms are Mantegna’s St. George and exam-
ples of Tintoretto’s revolutionary work (radical postures, greater
looseness, and theatricality, as well as an instantly recognizable palette).
There’s too much in the Accademia to even give an adequate summary,
but don’t miss Lorenzo Lotto’s striking portrait of a young man watched
by a small lizard on a table; Giorgione’s haunting portrait of an old
woman; and the Tiepolo ceiling paintings rescued from a now-destroyed
building. One of the most famous works is Veronese’s incredible, enor-
mous Last Supper. Its frenzied energy and party atmosphere (with wine
flowing and dwarf figures in the foreground) brought a charge of heresy
(and a hasty change of title to The Banquet in the House of Levi). At the end
of room 15 is Palladio’s gravity-defying staircase. Room 20 contains a fas-
cinating series of paintings by Carpaccio, Bellini, and others, all commis-
sioned to illustrate miracles of the True Cross, a fragment of which was
brought to Venice in 1369, but also illustrating Venice as it once was. More
paintings are on the upper floor Quadreria, which you can visit by reser-
vation only on Saturdays at 11 a.m.
Note: Construction of the new museum was ongoing at press time, so call
before you go to make sure there is no disruption of visits.

Ca’ d’Oro
Cannaregio
The Ca’ d’Oro (Gold House), as its name suggests, was once richly deco-
rated with gold, now worn away to reveal the marble beneath. Begun in
1422, it’s one of the most beautiful of the palazzi fronting the Canal Grande.
Its elegant tracery of carvings is the epitome of Venetian Gothic, that won-
derfully ornate style that’s never gaudy nor broodingly morbid like its
northern European cousin. The building was bought in 1895 by musi-
cian/art collector Giorgio Franchetti, who donated the Ca’ d’Oro and his
collections to the public in 1916. Besides antique furniture, tapestries, and
Venetian ceramics from as far back as the 12th century, the collection
includes many works by the best Italian masters. The stars of the show
are Mantegna’s San Sebastian and Titian’s Venus at the Mirror.

Ca’ Rezzonico
Dorsoduro
Begun in 1649 for the Bon, an important Venetian family, it was acquired a
hundred years later by the Rezzonico family, who completed the structure,
making it into one of the most magnificent palazzi on the Canal Grande.
The most famous resident was the English poet Robert Browning, who
died here in 1889. The Ca’ Rezzonico contains the Museum of the 18th
Century in Venice, and among its elegant rooms is the Throne Room,
whose ceilings were painted by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. You can step
out onto the balcony and gaze down the Canal Grande like a brooding poet
and get a feel for the life of a Venetian aristocrat.

Frari Basilica (Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari)
San Polo
Built in the first half of the 14th century and enlarged in the 15th, this
church with its original 14th-century bell tower is a magnificent example
of Venetian Gothic style. It contains exquisite artwork, such as Titian’s
Pala Pesaro (Pesaro Altarpiece) and the Assumption over the main
altar. Donatello’s St. John the Baptist, a rare sculpture in wood, is another
masterpiece. Be sure to visit the original wooden choir, where monks par-
ticipated in Mass — it’s the only extant choir of its kind in Venice. The tri-
angular marble monument dedicated to sculptor Antonio Canova was
actually designed by Canova to be a monument to Titian (Canova’s fol-
lowers appropriated the design for their master after he died in 1822). If
you look carefully at the walls near the monument, you can see an

Cover up
As elsewhere in Italy, you need to be “properly” dressed to get admission to Catholic
and religious attractions: bare shoulders, halter tops, tank tops, shorts, and skirts
above the knee will lead to your being turned away at the entrance, no matter your
age and sex. Dress appropriately or carry a scarf to cover up (see Chapter 2 for more
on how to dress).

Palazzo Ducale and Bridge of Sighs
San Marco
Shimmering after a lengthy restoration, the pink-and-white marble facade
of Venice’s most beautiful palazzo has been returned to view. Pause to take
in the delicate decorations, the expressive carvings, and the splendid bas-
reliefs of its columns before entering. Once the private home of the doges
(the doge was leader of the republic, elected for life), as well as the seat of
government and the court of law, the Palazzo Ducale was the heart of the
republic. In Gothic-Renaissance style, it was begun in 1173, integrating the
walls and towers of the previously existing A.D. 810 castle. The palazzo was
enlarged in 1340 with the addition of the new wing housing the Great
Council Room, a marvel of architecture for the size of the unsupported
ceilings (decorated by Tintoretto’s Paradise). On the left side of the court-
yard is the Staircase of the Giants, guarded by two giant stone figures and
a Renaissance masterpiece. At the top of these steps, you enter the loggia,
from which departs the famous Scala d’Oro (Golden Staircase) leading to
the doge’s apartments and the government chambers. These were splen-
didly decorated by the major artists of the 16th century, including Titian,
Tintoretto, Veronese, and Tiepolo. A little-known part of the palace’s col-
lection is a group of paintings bequeathed by a bishop, including inter-
esting works by Hieronymus Bosch.
From the palazzo, continue your visit on the famous Bridge of Sighs,
which didn’t get its name from the lovers who met under it: The bridge
was built in the 17th century to connect the palazzo — and the Courts of
Justice — to the prisons, and those condemned to death passed over this
bridge (supposedly sighing heavily) both on their way into the prison and

Sinking beauty
Venice has weathered wars, dictators, and conspiracies, and enjoyed more than a
thousand years of democracy. But its most treacherous foe may be the very sea it has
relied on for centuries. The city is literally sinking into the muddy lagoon on which it
was built. In spite of advice from experts all over the world, cement injections, and the
ongoing work of restoration and solidification of the canals, the city continues to sink.
The search for ways to save one of the most beautiful and extraordinary cities ever
built continues, but the recent rise in sea levels due to global warming spells doom.

eventually on their way out to be executed in Piazzetta San Marco. The
two red columns on the facade of Palazzo Ducale mark the place where
the death sentences were read out. You can visit both the 16th-century
New Prisons, built when the palace’s limited facilities became insufficient,
and the Old Prisons; these were also called pozzi, literally “wells,” but
“pits” would be a better translation, as they were at and below the ground
level — which, in Venice, means they flooded at high tide.
If you’re interested in the dark history of these ages, you may love the spe-
cial guided tour “Secret Itineraries,” which takes you into the doges’
hidden apartments and the Courts of Justice, where the most important
decisions were made. You also visit the famous Piombi (literally “leads”),
the prisons under the lead roof of the palace: Horribly hot in summer and
cold in winter, this is where Casanova was held and from where he made
his illustrious escape. The tour is offered in several languages and costs
16€ ($26); 10€ ($16) if you have a Venice Card or Museum Pass. Tours are
offered at specific times in Italian, French, and English (9:55, 10:45, and
11:35 a.m.); you need to reserve at least 48 hours in advance at % 041-
5209070.
The Palazzo Ducale is huge, especially with the labyrinthine prison next
door; allow at least two hours.

Frumento on the water side. % 041-2715911. Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to San Marco.

Peggy Guggenheim Collection
Dorsoduro
Housed in the elegant Palazzo Venier dei Leoni on the Canal Grande, this
museum holds one of Italy’s most important collections of avant-garde art.
The reason the building looks so short is that it’s the ground floor of a 1749
palazzo that was never completed. American expatriate collector Peggy
Guggenheim lived here for 30 years; after her death in 1979, the building
and collection became the property of New York’s Guggenheim Founda-
tion. Peggy G.’s protégés included Jackson Pollock, represented by ten
paintings, and Max Ernst, whom she married. From dada and surrealism to
abstract expressionism, the collection is rich and diverse, with works by
Klee, Magritte, Mondrian, De Chirico, Dalí, Kandinsky, Picasso, and others.
The sculpture garden includes works by Giacometti.

Piazza San Marco
San Marco
Possibly the world’s most famous piazza, this beautiful space was created
in the 11th century. Lined on one side by St. Mark’s Basilica (see later in
this section) and on the three others by the porticos and loggias of the
Procuratie buildings, it was and is the heart of Venice, site of ceremonies,
celebrations, and, at one time, tournaments. The buildings on the north
side are the Procuratie Vecchie, built in the Renaissance as offices for the
city’s magistrature; facing it to the south are the Procuratie Nuove, built
to house more offices and, after the fall of the Venetian Republic at the
hands of Napoleon, turned into the Royal Palace. The wing enclosing the
piazza to the west was added by Napoleon, after demolishing the church
that was once there. This last building now houses the Correr Museum
(% 041-2405211; same admission and hours as Palazzo Ducale), whose
interesting collection includes some remarkable artwork, such as Canova’s
bas-reliefs; the famous painting by Carpaccio called Two Venetian
Ladies; a strange Lucas Cranach, with Christ rising from the tomb and 
two bearded soldiers looking trollish; and Hugo van der Goes’s small 
but strikingly emotional Crucifixion. Part of the building contains 
the Risorgimento museum — with mementos and documents from that
period — and an eclectic collection of items that make up a history of daily
Venetian life. From the Correr, you can also access the Archaeological
Museum, with its rich collection of Greek sculptures.
To the north of the piazza, adjacent to St. Mark’s Basilica, is the Torre
dell’Orologio (% 041-5209070; www.museiciviciveneziani.it), a
clock tower built in 1496. The clock has two huge quadrants, the one below
indicating the phases of the moon and signs of the zodiac. The one above
is the clock with a complicated mechanism propelling wooden statues of the
Magi (the three kings bringing offerings to Jesus) guided by an angel to come
out at the striking of the hour and pass in front of the Virgin and Child. Above
this, yet another mechanism propels two bronze Moors to strike a bell on
the hour. A gruesome legend has it that when the clock was completed, it
was such a wonder that the workman who designed and built it was blinded

Behave or be fined!
The whole historic district of Venice is considered a monument, hence strict laws
apply. It is forbidden to sit on the ground (sidewalks, bridges, piazze, etc.), have a
picnic, swim in the canals, litter, use bikes or any other kind of transportation (includ-
ing scooters and rollerblades), or walk around underdressed (i.e., with no shirt or with
only beachwear). The fine is 50€ ($80) for any violation.

so he could never duplicate it anywhere else. After a lengthy restoration, the
tower is open to visitors (though it is not recommended if you have a heart
condition, are claustrophobic, pregnant, or otherwise mobility-restricted) on
guided tours by reservation only. Tickets are 12€ ($19) or 7€ ($11) if you
have a Venice Card, Museum Pass, or Palazzo Ducale ticket.
To the south, St. Mark’s Bell Tower (% 041-5224064; Admission:
6€/$9.60; Open: Oct–Nov and Apr–June daily 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; Nov–Apr daily
9:30 a.m.–3:45 p.m.; July–Sept 9 a.m.–9 p.m.) dominates the piazza.
Used as a lighthouse by approaching boats, this tall belfry — 97m (324 ft.)
high — was originally built in the ninth century. It suddenly collapsed in
1902, but was faithfully rebuilt using most of the same materials. From
atop, you can admire a 360-degree panorama of the city and the famous
piazza below — and you can do it without climbing hundreds of steps,
since the tower has an elevator.
Attached to Piazza San Marco is Piazzetta San Marco, a smaller space
opening onto the bay and lined on one side by the Palazzo Ducale
(see earlier in this section) and on the other by the Libreria Marciana

Ducale; Open: Mon–Fri 8:10 a.m.–7 p.m., Sat 8:10 a.m.–1:30 p.m.). Also
called Libreria Sansoviniana (Sansovino Library), after the name of its
architect, Jacopo Sansovino, this elegant building was erected between
1537 and 1560 to house the republic’s collection of Greek and ancient
Roman manuscripts. Those are made available only to scholars, but every-
body is allowed to see the beautifully decorated rooms and works of art.
We recommend the library’s free guided tour, available at press time on
Sundays at 10 a.m., noon, and 2 p.m.
Outside, two granite columns — brought from the east in the 12th century — 
decorate the piazzetta. They are topped by Venetian-Byzantine capitals:
one supporting the lion symbol of St. Mark, and the other San Teodoro,
the city’s patron saint before the body of St. Mark was brought back to
Venice. This was the setting for capital executions and cruel, extraordi-
nary punishments for which the Serene Republic was notorious.

La Serenissima
As barbarians overran the Italian peninsula after the fall of the Western Roman Empire
in A.D. 475, a small group of wealthy people took refuge among the fishing communities
in the Venetian lagoon and built a town that rapidly developed as a commercial seafar-
ing powerhouse under the protection of Bisance (Constantinople, the capital of the
Eastern Roman Empire). A thriving commercial harbor and shipyard, Venice achieved
independence from the Byzantine Empire in the eighth century A.D. with its first doge
(the head of the government elected by the town’s citizen) — the word doge is the
Venetian mutation of the Latin word dux (“leader”). By the tenth century, the Republic
of Venice had become a harbor of international importance, regulating commerce
between Europe and the Orient. The city we know today started developing around St.
Mark’s Basilica, which was constructed to house the relics of the saint. The group of
islands in the lagoon was built up, the canals drained, and their edges reinforced.
The Venetian Republic was a great experiment in government: At the heart was the
Maggior Consiglio (Great Council), which elected the doge. Originally elective, mem-
bership to the Maggior Consiglio became hereditary in 1297. The smaller Council of
Ten was established in 1310 to judge conspirators in a failed plot, but it became per-
manent (the doge and his counselors were also members). It became so powerful that
the Maggior Consiglio passed legislation to limit its powers in 1582, 1628, and 1762.
Most powerful of all, perhaps, was the Grand Chancellor, who, as the head of the
secret police, knew all the dark secrets of the nobility, so other institutions were estab-
lished to limit his power. The experiment was successful: Thanks to the complicated
network of checks and balances that was put in place to limit the power of the doge
and all the other political institutions that governed the city-state, Venice remained a
republic until May 12, 1797 (over a thousand years), when Napoleon invaded northern
Italy and established a new European order. After Napoleon’s fall, the Austro-
Hungarian empire took over Venice, and it was only in 1866 that they were chased
away and Venice became part of the newly created Italian kingdom.

Ponte di Rialto
San Marco/San Polo
When the original wooden bridge here started rotting away, the citizens
of Venice decided, in 1588, to replace it with the current stone-and-brick
marvel. The bridge opens onto the Rialto district in San Polo, Venice’s main
merchant area since the Middle Ages. Ships arrived here after stopping at
the Dogana (Customs House), at the tip of Dorsoduro, and discharged
their merchandise in the large warehouses. Goods were then sold at the
general market surrounding the warehouses. The fish and produce whole-
sale markets were moved to the new merchant and marine terminal across
from Santa Lucia rail station only in 1998, but the retail markets have sur-
vived, retaining their picturesque flavor. Lined with shops on both sides
and busy with crowds of tourists, it is difficult to truly enjoy this splendid
bridge’s architectural beauty during the day; for the best view, try early in
the morning or late in the evening.
See map p. 316. Across the Canal Grande, between Riva del Vin and Riva del Carbon.
Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to Rialto.
Santa Maria della Salute
Dorsoduro
Built after the 1630 black-plague epidemic as an ex-voto (thanks offering
to God), the octagonal St. Mary of Good Health is an enduring baroque
landmark at the end of Dorsoduro, almost across from Piazza San Marco.
On the main altar is a 13th-century Byzantine icon and Titian’s Descent of
the Holy Spirit; in the Sacristy are three Titian ceiling paintings as well
as Tintoretto’s wonderful Wedding at Cana. If you happen to be in town on
November 21, you can see the feast of the Madonna della Salute, a centuries-
old commemorative pageant in which a pontoon bridge is constructed
across the Canal Grande, linking La Salute with the San Marco side.

($2.40). Open: Daily 9 a.m. to noon and 3–5:30 p.m.; visits suspended during Mass
(Mon–Sat 4 p.m. and Sun 11 a.m.).
St. Mark’s Basilica
San Marco
The symbol of Venice, it was built in A.D. 829 to house the remains of San
Marco, one of the four evangelists, martyred by the Turks in Alexandria of
Egypt, and the city’s patron saint. The original church was rebuilt after it
burned down in 932, and again in 1063, taking its present shape. Five
domes — originally gilded — top the five portals, while an elegant loggia
opens in between: This is where the doge presided over the public func-
tions held in the square (multilingual audio boxes up here give a brief
description of the sites you can see around the piazza). The bronze doors
of the Basilica’s main portal are booty from the Fourth Crusade from
Constantinople. Above the entrance hall is the gallery, from which you
Chapter 16: Venice 325

can have a close-up view of the rich mosaic decorations of the portals.
Only one of the mosaics above the doorways is original — the one in the
first doorway to the left. The others are 17th- and 18th-century reproduc-
tions. The rooms above house the Museo Marciano, which holds the orig-
inal horses of the Triumphal Quadriga: the famous gilded bronze horses
(the ones outside gracing the loggia are copies) which were brought back
from Constantinople in 1204 after the Fourth Crusade. Experts have esti-
mated that the horses are Greek sculptures from the fourth century B.C.
The museum also has a collection of mosaics, altarpieces, and sculptures
that decorated the basilica at one time or another. You can access the
loggia, as well as the gallery and the museum, from a long and steep flight
of stone steps inside the basilica entrance on the right.
Entering the portal, you may be overwhelmed by the luxury of the deco-
rations: gold mosaics and colored inlaid marble everywhere. The lower
part of the basilica is decorated in Byzantine and Venetian style and the
second story in Flamboyant Gothic. The atrium’s ceiling mosaics date from
1225 to 1275 and depict Old Testament scenes. The floors are in geomet-
ric marble mosaics of typical Byzantine style from the 11th and 12th cen-
turies. The inner basilica mosaics, depicting scenes from the New
Testament, were begun in the 12th century and finished in the 13th. The
treasury holds the basilica’s rich collection of relics and art, including loot
from Constantinople and the Crusades. Behind the main altar is the
famous Pala d’Oro, a magnificent altarpiece in gold and enamel started in
the 10th century and further decorated in the 14th and 15th centuries.
Finely chiseled in Byzantine-Venetian style, it is encrusted with over 2,000
precious stones.
Due to the crowds, visits to the basilica are limited to ten minutes (Pala
d’Oro, Treasury, and Museum are separate); you can make a free reserva-
tion for your time slot at least 48 hours in advance at www.alata.it.
April through October and Monday through Saturday, the parish offers
free guided tours of the basilica (advance reservations required at the Web
site below or % 041-2413817).

Scuola Grande di San Rocco
San Polo
San Rocco is Jacopo Tintoretto’s Sistine Chapel. From 1564 to 1587,
Tintoretto, a brother of the school, decorated the Sala dell’Albergo, the
lower hall, and the upper hall with a series of incredibly beautiful paint-
ings depicting biblical and Christian subjects. There are 21 paintings on
the upper-hall ceiling alone (mirrors are available so you don’t have to
strain your neck). The most impressive is his Crucifixion, a painting of

almost overpowering emotion and incredible detail (the tools used to
make the cross are strewn in the foreground); the painter shows the
moment when one of the two thieves’ crosses is raised. The upper hall is
also decorated with a fascinating collection of wood sculptures carved by
Francesco Pianta in the 17th century; some depict artisans and the tools
of their trade with an amazing realism.

Finding more cool things to see and do
 Yes, we know, gondolas are for, ahem, tourists . . . but, really, what
can be more romantic than being rowed in a gondola along Venice’s
quietest canals? A gondola ride is the best way to admire the city’s
architecture and experience Venice’s unique serenity while glimps-
ing a little-known universe: Still alive and well, the community of
Venetian sailors and fishermen are the keepers of many Venetian
traditions, from the city’s ritual marriage to the sea to fierce rowing
competitions. The tourist office organizes gondola tours, saving
you the hassle of negotiating an itinerary and prices with the gon-
dolier, but you can also organize your own by going to one of the
many stands in town (see sidebar for tariffs and locations).
You may want to take your tour at high tide — to be more level
with the pavement, instead of the rather scummy canal sidewalls.
You also want to avoid the Canal Grande, except maybe in the wee
hours: It is so large and busy that it gets noisy and choppy and can
be quite unpleasant in a small boat.
 Built in the 12th century, the Arsenale (Vaporetto: 1, 41, or 42 to
Arsenale; follow Calle dei Forni to its end, turn left on Calle di
Pegola, then right into Campo Arsenale) was the Venetian
Republic’s shipyard — the name comes from the Arabic word darsi-
na’a (shipyard) — the largest in the world for centuries. At its
heyday, when as many as 100 galleons were ready to sail, crews
could assemble a vessel from prefab timbers in a single day — and
a crew at that time could number as many as 16,000! The Arsenale
is still part of the Italian Navy, but is now open to the public for
special exhibits, such as Navalis — the wooden boat show — and
the Biennale di Venezia, the international art show that takes
place in odd-numbered years. We recommend taking vaporetto no.
51 or 52 to enjoy the view from the water. Nearby is the Museo
Storico Navale (Campo San Biagio, 2148 Castello; % 041-5200276;
Admission: 1.60€/$2.60; Open: Mon–Fri 8:45 a.m.–1:30 p.m., Sat 8:45
a.m.–1 p.m.), in the Venetian Republic’s 15th-century granary, part
of the Arsenale. The largest in Italy, it includes a beautiful collection
of historical boats and models.
Chapter 16: Venice 327

 The word ghetto has been used to name the neighborhood once set
apart for Jews in European cities, but the Venetian Ghetto (Ghetto
Novo) was Europe’s first. It was established in 1516 on a small
island accessible by only one bridge, which was closed at night. In
1541, when Jews from Germany, Poland, Spain, and Portugal fled to
Venice, the government allowed the community to expand into the
Old Ghetto (Ghetto Vecchio), the area between the Ghetto Novo
and the Rio di Cannaregio, which has the two largest places of 
worship — Scola Levantina and Scola Spagnola (the Levantine 
and Spanish synagogues). To accommodate the growing popula-
tion, buildings were made taller and taller, which is why this area
has some of the tallest buildings in Venice. The Jewish Museum
(Museo Ebraico, Campo del Ghetto Novo, 2902/b Cannaregio; 
% 041-715359; www.museoebraico.it; Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to San
Marcuola; Open: Daily Oct–May Sun–Fri 10 a.m.–6 p.m., June–Sept
Sun–Fri 10 a.m.–7 p.m.; Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25 and Jewish
holidays) offers guided tours of the synagogues in Italian or English
every hour beginning at 10:30 a.m. on opening days. Admission is
3€ ($4.80) for the museum, or 8.50€ ($14) for a guided tour.

Venezia and the gondola
Which one says Venice to you: an image of St. Mark’s Basilica or one of a gondola in
a canal? The gondola is so emblematic of the city that its real identity and history is
completely lost to many of the tourists who flock to this enchanted city every year.
This unique boat that was developed to complement the local conditions is a marvel
of engineering: 11m (38 ft.) long, a gondola weighs up to 600kg (1,320 pounds), yet is
easily maneuvered by one person with only one oar. It is narrow and flat enough to
maneuver in the smallest and shallowest canals and to pass under Venice’s many
small bridges. Asymmetrically designed to be inclined on the right side, so that it goes
straight with the push of just one oar, each gondola is custom-made based on the oars-
man’s weight. Specifically created to transport people, the gondola is decorated 
elegantly — with gilded edgings, velvet and brocade cushions, and delicate carvings — 
while simpler boats, often with two oarsmen, were used for cargo. Gondolas 
are wooden, the only two pieces of iron being the ferro that decorates the bow —
originally a balancing weight for the oar man — and the risso on the stern. The tradi-
tional cabin cover that protected passengers from the elements has been abandoned,
but you can see them in museums.
The official rate (set by Ente Gondola; % 041-5285075; www.gondolavenezia.it)
is 80€ ($128) for 40 minutes and a maximum of six people in the daytime, or 100€ ($160)
for nighttime (7 p.m.–8 a.m.). Use only authorized gondolas from an official gondola
station, and establish the price, itinerary, and trip length before you get in the boat, to
avoid unpleasant surprises. You find gondola stations at San Marco (% 041-5200685),
San Tomà (% 041-5205275), Rialto (Riva del Carbon; % 041-5224904), Santa Maria del
Giglio (% 041-5222073), Campo San Moisè off Calle Larga 22 Marzo (% 041-5231837),
and Riva Schiavoni (across from Danieli; % 041-5222254).

 A visit to Venice isn’t complete without a trip to the Lagoon. The
closest and largest island is Murano (Vaporetto: 41 or 42) — actually
a cluster of islands. It feels like a smaller, much quieter replica of
Venice, down to its main canal meandering across it. Known as the
island of the glassmakers, an industry that was created here cen-
turies ago, it’s still famous as ever for the unique quality of its artis-
tic glass work. This community of more than 6,000 contains about
70 glass factories, some of which allow you to sit and watch glass
being blown (most only in the morning). You find many shops sell-
ing glass of all kinds — from cheap trinkets to million-dollar 
chandeliers — and several good seafood restaurants. We recom-
mend the moderately priced Ostaria ai Vetrai (Fondamenta Manin
29; % 041-739293; Open: Wed–Sun noon to 3 p.m.), with a pleasant
canal-side terrace serving excellent seafood. At the Glass Museum
(Museo del Vetro; Fondamenta Giustinian 8; % 041-739586; Admis-
sion: 5.50€/$8.80; Open: Apr–Oct Thurs–Tues 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Nov–
Mar Thurs–Tues 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m., ticket booth closes 30 minutes
earlier; Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25), you can see a number of
splendid antique masterpieces. Founded in the seventh century
and rebuilt in the 12th in Venetian Byzantine style, the church of
Santa Maria e Donato is really one of the wonders of the whole
Venetian region: The floor — which dates from 1140 and is adorned
with a mosaic of birds and animals in semiprecious stone — is a
marvel unto itself.
 The farthest island from Venice — about half an hour by vaporetto
LN from Fondamenta Nove — is Burano, a fishing village renowned
for its lacemaking. The houses on Burano are famous for their bright
colors, ranging from purple to bright yellow. The town itself is
almost wholly given up to lace shops, not necessarily selling the
real thing. But the Lace School and the attached Lace Museum
(Museo del Merletto; Piazza Baldassarre Galuppi 187; % 041-
730034; Admission: 4€/$6.40; Open: Apr–Oct Wed–Mon 10 a.m.–
5 p.m., Nov–Mar Wed–Mon 10 a.m.–4 p.m., ticket booth closes 
30 minutes earlier; Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25) — a world-
renowned center — are the repository of ancient techniques and
skills. The museum is under renovation at press time, but should
reopen by the end of 2008. The Duomo, with its tilting campanile, is
just across the street and features a Tiepolo Crucifixion; it’s open
daily from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 3 to 6 p.m.
 Lido (Vaporetto: 1, 6, 51, 52, or 82) is the long barrier island that
protects the lagoon from the open sea. Inhabited since ancient times,
it bloomed at the end of the 19th century with the development of
an elegant Art Nouveau resort. Its name means “beach,” so it’s no
surprise that its huge beach is where Venetians come to take their
seaside vacations. It feels a bit like California, with a lot of green
spaces and a beach atmosphere (cars can circulate here). The Lido
is also the site of some of the most elegant hotels from the early
1900s, such as the Hotel des Bains (Lungomare Marconi 17; % 800-
3253535 in the U.S., or 041-5265921; www.starwooditaly.com;
Chapter 16: Venice 329

Closed Nov to mid-Mar), restored by Starwood to its Art Nouveau
splendor (Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice was set here). Many visi-
tors stay at one of Lido’s numerous hotels because it’s only a short
vaporetto ride from San Marco — and you get much more for your
money. You can spend a decadent evening at the elegant historic
casino (still functioning in summer), ride a bike around this barrier
island (which extends for 11km/7 miles), or play golf. If you choose
to bike, you can rent one not far from the ferry station at Gardin
Anna Vallè (Piazzale Santa Maria Elisabetta 2/a; % 041-2760005).
 The period before Lent is celebrated as Carnevale all over Italy —
known as Mardi Gras in New Orleans — and Venice’s celebrations
are spectacular, culminating the week before Ash Wednesday (usu-
ally in Feb) and on the last day, Martedì Grasso (Fat Tuesday). In
1797, Napoleon suppressed Carnevale, which had grown into a
month-long bacchanal, but this festive holiday was revived in 1980
and is a big deal in Venice. The city is famous for its elaborate 
costumes and masks, which are historical and elegant rather than
Halloween-ish. Musical events take place at all times, and big crowds
surge all over. Some of the events are reserved only for those who
are in disguise, such as the Gran Ballo in Piazza San Marco. Other
events include a daily Children’s Carnevale on Piazza San Polo, a
cortege of decorated boats on the Canal Grande, and a market of
Venetian costumes at Santo Stefano (see “Shopping the Local Stores”
later for other sources of authentic Venetian getups). Costumes are
for rent at Tragicomica di Gualtiero dell’Osto (Campiello dei
Meloni, 2800 San Polo; % 041-721101; Vaporetto: 1 to San Stae).
 If you love the work of Palladio, the famous architect of so many
elegant villas along the Brenta river (see Padua in Chapter 17), you
should not miss some of his best churches here in Venice. The
Chiesa del Redentore (Campo del Redentore on the Giudecca
island; Vaporetto: 82 to Redentore; Admission: 3€/$4.80; Open:
Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.) is the largest, built in the 16th century to
celebrate the end of yet another spell of the black death; huge yet
perfectly proportioned, the monument was decorated by important
artists including Tintoretto and Veronese. We prefer the smaller but
still imposing — and much less visited — San Giorgio Maggiore
(Vaporetto: 82 to San Giorgio; Free admission; Open: Mon–Sat 9:30
a.m.–12:30 p.m., daily 2:30–4:30 p.m., till 6:30 p.m. in summer), on
the small San Giorgio island across from Riva degli Schiavoni.
Palladio died before its completion, but he would have been proud
of the result; the interior is decorated with works by great artists,
including Tintoretto, who left two of his masterpieces here: the Last
Supper and the Fall of the Manna, both in the presbytery. Sunday
Mass at 11 a.m. is chanted Gregorian style.
Seeing Venice by guided tour
The best traditional guided tours are offered by American Express
(Salizzada San Moisè, 1471 San Marco; % 041-5200844; Vaporetto: 1 or
82 to San Marco–Vallaresso), for about 35€ ($56) for a two-hour tour.
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
330

The Venice tourist office (see “Fast Facts: Venice” at the end of this
chapter) organizes unique tours, from a 20-minute helicopter tour for
220€ ($352) or an evening tour of the neighborhoods of Castello and
Cannaregio, to the discovery of Venetian legends and ghost stories.
Their guided tour of Canal Grande is excellent (daily at 11:30 a.m. and
4:30 p.m.; 30€/$48), but they require a minimum of four persons. We 
also like the one offered by Motoscafi Venezia (% 041-5222303; www.
motoscafivenezia.it).
Suggested one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
Time in Venice always seems to fly. Here are a few suggestions on how to
schedule your visit:
Venice in one day
If you have only one day in Venice, you definitely want to make the most
of it with an early start. Begin your day on Piazza San Marco with a visit
to the Basilica, including the climb to the loggia upstairs, where the
light is at its most beautiful in the morning. You should then have a little
time left for the Doge’s Palace. Have a caffè or cappuccino on the terrace
of one of the two historic cafes — Caffè Florian and Caffè Quadri (see
“Living It Up After Dark,” later in this chapter) — on the piazza: expen-
sive, but oh so romantic. Afterward, have a look at the beautiful Murano
glass — and maybe even buy some — in Venini and Pauly & C. (see
“Shopping the Local Stores,” later in this chapter), or at the more afford-
able Marco Polo. Then walk toward the Accademia, taking the footbridge
over the Canal Grande and having lunch in the lively area nearby at
Osteria da Fiore. If you just want a sweet snack, the Pasticceria Tonolo
is wonderful (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter). After you’ve had
a bite to eat, visit the Gallerie dell’Accademia for a tour of several hun-
dred years of Venetian art. You may then be in the mood for a Venetian
aperitivo — a cicchetto (a glass of dry wine accompanied by some savory
tidbits) — in one of the small bars near the Accademia, or across the
Canal Grande at the Antico Martini. Treat yourself to dinner at Met in
the Hotel Metropole. Take a post-dinner gondola ride if you can afford it
or settle for a slow ride down the Canal Grande on vaporetto line no. 1.
Bask in that magical atmosphere, the glorious facades of the palazzi
lining the canal, and the romantic Ponte di Rialto as you pass beneath it.
Venice in two days
Two days in Venice are better than one, but you still don’t have time to
waste. Here is what we would do:
Day 1
Start off by following our one-day itinerary, above, in the morning, but
dedicate more time to St. Mark’s Basilica. In the afternoon, take a tour of
the Doge’s Palace and the Bridge of Sighs. After your visits, head to
Antico Martini for a well deserved aperitivo and possibly dinner.
Afterward, stroll to the Ponte di Rialto.
Chapter 16: Venice 331

Day 2
Devote your morning to the Gallerie dell’Accademia. Have lunch at
Osteria da Fiore and, after you eat, visit the Basilica de’ Frari and the
Scuola Grande di San Rocco. Follow our dinner and after-dinner recom-
mendations in the “Venice in one day” itinerary, above.
Venice in three days
On Day 1 and 2, follow our “Venice in two days” itinerary, above.
Dedicate your third day to the Lagoon, visiting first Murano, with its
Glass Museum and the showrooms of the most famous glassmakers, and
then Burano, with its Lace Museum. End the day with a bike ride on the
island of Lido; if it’s high season, take a swim and grab drinks at the
Casino. Alternatively, you can visit the other top churches in Venice:
Santa Maria della Salute and Palladio’s masterpieces, Chiesa del
Redentore and San Giorgio Maggiore.
Shopping the Local Stores
Venice’s most renowned wares reflect the city’s aura of delicate, shimmer-
ing beauty. Where else would you find exquisite goblets tinged with gold,
or lace as fine as snowflakes? Where else would fine paper be fashioned
from original 18th-century molds? The good stuff is definitely here, but
so is the not-so-good: cheap Chinese-made lace and Bulgarian-made glass
abound and are difficult to discern at first sight. Shop only at reputable
stores (such as those we recommend below) or at the Web site approved
by the city (www.veneziapoint.com/ita/center/center.asp).
Best shopping areas
In Venice, you may feel like a bull in a china shop — there’s glass here,
there, and everywhere. You may be tempted to buy some as a souvenir.
San Marco is the best area, with showrooms of most Murano’s big names
of glassmaking, as well as galleries carrying a selection of works by sev-
eral glass artists. Another option, of course, is to go to Murano itself and
shop around; a huge array of glass shops and showrooms lines both
sides of the Rio dei Vetrai (see “Finding more cool things to see and do,”
earlier in this chapter); prices will be the same as in town, but the selec-
tion will be larger.
If your thing is lace, you should be even more careful than with glass:
Burano (see “Finding more cool things to see and do,” earlier in this
chapter) has become an outdoor market selling everything from
machine-made stuff from Singapore to genuine handmade local lace.
Again, if you know your linens and laces, you can tell what you’re get-
ting. If not, going to a reputable shop in Venice may be better.
For general shopping, the best streets are the Mercerie (the zigzag route
from the Piazza San Marco clock tower to the Ponte di Rialto) and the
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
332

path leading from Piazza San Marco to Campo Santo Stefano, including
Calle Larga XXII Marzo. Here you can find big-name Italian stores spe-
cializing in everything from shoes to housewares to clothing.
What to look for and where to find it
Venice is known for its exquisite blown glass, lace, fine paper, and the
incredibly beautiful Carnevale costumes; lesser-known items include
lovely hand-worked metal (both iron and brass) and blown-glass lanterns.
Generally, shopping hours are daily from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 3:30 to 
7:30 p.m. In Venice, only local neighborhood shops close on Sundays.
Cast iron
Murano chandeliers are gorgeous, but lanterns are also very beautiful
and affordable. At De Rossi (showroom at Strada Nuova, 4311 Cannaregio;
% 041-5222436; workshop at Fondamenta Nuove, 5045 Cannaregio; 
% 041-5200077), you find a large collection of Venetian lanterns, the
glass blown directly inside the handmade iron fittings, plus a variety of
other iron and brass work.
Glass
Founded in the early 1920s, Venini (Piazzetta dei Leoncini, just to the
left of St. Mark’s Basilica, 314 San Marco; % 041-5224045; Vaporetto: 1
or 82 to San Marco-Vallaresso; and at Fondamenta Vetrai, Murano 47/50;
% 041-2737211; www.venini.com) is world renowned. Prices are what
you’d expect for works of art; one drinking glass could cost up to $1,000.
Pauly & C. (Palazzo Trevisan Cappello, Ponte dei Consorzi 4391/A San
Marco, off Calle Larga San Marco; % 041-5209899; www.paulyglass
factory.com) has three nice boutiques in Piazza San Marco (Piazza San
Marco 73, % 041-5235484; Piazza San Marco 77, % 041-277-0279; and
Piazza San Marco 316, % 041-523-5575). If you have the time, though,
visit the company headquarters on Rio di Palazzo, where you see a large
collection of antiques and high-quality copies of ancient models.
Barovier & Toso (Fondamenta Vetrai, Murano 28; % 041-739049;
www.barovier.com) has been a family business since the 13th century.
You can visit its showroom as well as a small but rich museum with its
historic pieces, both housed in a 17th-century palazzo in Murano.
L’Isola (Campo San Moisè, 1468 San Marco; % 041-5231973; Vaporetto:
1 or 82 to San Marco–Vallaresso) is the showroom of Carlo Moretti, one
of Murano’s great names.
The gallery Murano Collezioni (Fondamenta Manin, Murano 1CD; 
% 041-736272) has a selection of works by the three biggest names in
Venetian glass — Barovier & Toso, Venini, and Carlo Moretti — and
makes for good one-stop shopping if you’re short on time.
Chapter 16: Venice 333

Lace
Jesurum (Mercerie del Capitello, 4857 San Marco; % 041-5206177;
www.jesurum.it; Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to San Marco–Vallaresso) is a reli-
able lace shop that’s been in business since the 1870s. High quality is
expensive, but the range of items, from cocktail napkins to bed linens,
means that you stand a good chance of finding something within your
budget.
Another good choice is Martinuzzi (Piazza San Marco, 67/A San Marco;
% 041-5225068), with an extensive selection of beautiful lace and
embroidered linen.
Masks and costumes
If you’re in town to enjoy Carnevale and you didn’t pack your 18th-
century finery, you’re going to need a mask, at the very least. The
Laboratorio Artigianale Maschere, just a short way from SS. Giovanni e
Paolo (Barbaria delle Tole, 6657 Castello; % 041-522310; Vaporetto: 41,
42, 51, or 52 to Ospedale), has some of the most beautiful costumes.
Another option is the more affordable Mondonovo (Rio Terà Canal, 
3063 Dorsoduro; % 041-5287344; Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to Accademia). Still,
expect to pay 16€ ($26) for a basic mask; for the most beautiful and
artistic masks, prices run much higher.
Paper
Handmade marbleized paper is a specialty of Venice, and Piazzesi
(Campiello della Feltrina, just off Santa Maria del Giglio, 2511 San Marco;
% 041-5221202; Vaporetto: 1 to Giglio) is said to be one of the oldest in
the business — founded in 1900.
Living It Up After Dark
Venice has a lively — if a bit genteel — nightlife, with pubs, elegant out-
door terraces, concerts, and discos. You’ll find a schedule of events in
the free brochure Un Ospite di Venezia (www.unospitedivenezia.it),
distributed at the best hotels and at the tourist office.
The performing arts
The Teatro Goldoni (Calle Goldoni, 4650/B San Marco; % 041-2402011;
Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to Rialto) is one of Venice’s premier theaters and one
of the oldest, dating back to the 17th century. Venice’s largest opera the-
ater, the Teatro La Fenice (Campo San Fantin, 1965 San Marco; % 041-
786511; www.teatrolafenice.it) is perhaps the most elegant in Italy.
True to its mythological name, it was reborn from its ashes twice, after
the fire of 1836 and the more recent one of 1996. Tickets are about 12€
to 50€ ($19–$80).
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana

Many Venetian churches and palazzi become venues for musical 
performances — mostly classical — throughout the year. The Querini
Stampalia Foundation (Santa Maria Formosa, Castello 5252; % 041-
2711411; www.querinistampalia.it) offers medieval and Renaissance
music, and free organ concerts are held every Sunday at 4 p.m. in Santa
Maria della Salute (see earlier in this chapter; % 041-2743928). More
concerts are offered in Palazzo Albrizzi (Pomeriggi Musicali; Cannaregio
4118; % 041-5232544; www.acitve.it) by the German-Italian Association.
Cafes
Though a bit overrun by tourists, the historic cafes on Piazza San 
Marco afford elegant light entertainment, with ornate salons and open-
air terraces enlivened by classical music ensembles. Caffè Florian
(% 041-5205641; www.caffeflorian.com) is the newest — it opened
its doors only in 1720 — while Caffè Quadri (% 041-5222105; www.
quadrivenice.com) has been here since 1638. Both have restaurant
service as well, but we recommend Quadri. For a slightly more authentic
place where you may even find some locals, we like Le Café (Campo
Santo Stefano, 2797 San Marco; % 041-5237201; Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to
Accademia, then cross the bridge) on one of our favorite piazze in
Venice. The cafe also serves food, either inside or on its pleasant out-
door terrace.
Bars, pubs, and clubs
Since Hemingway’s days in Venice, one of the classic things for visitors
to do is head to Harry’s Bar (Calle Vallaresso, 1323 San Marco; % 041-
528-5777; Vaporetto: 1 to San Marco–Vallaresso) for a martini or a Bellini
(made with prosecco, a champagne-like white wine, and the juice of
white peaches). Bars and bacari (traditional wine bars) are distributed
around town, particularly in Dorsoduro — with Campo Santa Margherita
being the hub for the artistic and collegiate crowd — and the Ghetto,
with Fondamenta della Misericordia and its many restaurants and clubs.
Paradiso Perduto (Fondamenta della Misericordia, Cannaregio 2540; 
% 041-720581; Vaporetto: Ferrovie; Open: Thurs–Tues 7 p.m.–1 a.m.)
and its live jazz performances have been discovered by tourists, but it
remains a good address where you can also get a cheap simple meal.
The Devil’s Forest Pub (Calle Stagneri, 5185 San Marco; % 041-5200623;
Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to Rialto) is often crowded. Another popular spot,
with younger crowds as well, is the wine bar VinoVino (Ponte della
Veste, San Marco 2007a; % 041-2417688; Closed Tues), which offers a
choice of over 350 wines. Attached to the Antico Martini restaurant is
the Martini Scala (Campo San Fantin, 1980 San Marco, left of Teatro La
Fenice; % 041-522-4121; Closed Tues), open until 3:30 a.m. with a good
live piano bar. Bacaro Jazz (Rialto, San Marco 5546; % 041-5285249) is
a wine bar with good music. At Il Piccolo Mondo (Calle Contarini Corfu,
Dorsoduro 1056a; % 041-5200371), near Accademia, you find younger
crowds; the action goes on often until 4 a.m.
Chapter 16: Venice 335

You won’t find any gay or lesbian bars in Venice, but as someone once
said, every bar in Venice is a gay bar if you look in the right corner.
Venice’s Casino
You need to be at least 18, have your passport, and be wearing a jacket
and tie to enter the elegant, historic Palazzo Vendramin-Calergi (Campo
San Marcuola, Cannaregio 2079; % 041-5297111; www.casinovenezia.
it; Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to San Marcuola), offering roulette, card games,
and a few slot machines (slot machines open daily 3 p.m.; tables 3:30 p.m.;
doors close Sun–Thurs 2:30 a.m. and Fri–Sat 3 a.m.). In summer (Aug–
Sept), the action moves to the island of Lido, where the historical build-
ing of the Municipal Casino (Lungomare Marconi 4; % 041-5297132;
dedicated shuttle boat from Ferrovia, Piazzale Roma, and San Marco)
welcomes its guests in a grand, if a bit stiff, atmosphere. Admission is 
5€ ($8), or is free for guests of Venice hotels (ask for a voucher at the
reception desk of your hotel). Alternately, you can purchase a 10€ ($16)
admission card that includes a 10€ ($16) chip to use at one of the tables
or some of the slot machines. The casino also offers dining and live
shows and a variety of packages that include admission, dinner, and a
varying amount of chips.

Chapter 17
Padua, Verona, and Milan
In This Chapter
 Discovering Padua and its famous Giotto frescoes
 Thrilling to Verona’s legends of Romeo and Juliet
 Shopping ’til you drop in bustling Milan
W
ith its art and unique setting, Venice towers over all other cities
in northern Italy, shadowing many real gems. A little farther inland
from Venice is Padua, with its wealth of churches and museums. Moving
farther to the west is pleasant Verona, drawing visitors from all over the
world to see the supposed home of Shakespeare’s tragic heroine as well
as ancient Roman, medieval, and Renaissance architecture. Yet a bit far-
ther is Milan, an important business center that is so renowned for its
sizzling fashion and incredible shopping opportunities that one forgets
its art: Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper and Milan’s grandiose Gothic
Duomo, for example.
Padua and Verona make easy day trips from Venice (Padua also makes
an excellent base) — you can see the highlights of each in a few hours.
Milan is farther west and a much larger city; if you want to experience
both its art and its shopping, we recommend you spend the night.
Padua: Home of Giotto’s Fabulous Frescoes
Small yet bustling, the modern town of Padua (Padova) is the Veneto
region’s economic heart. Giotto’s justly famous frescoes in the Cappella
degli Scrovegni are so breathtaking that they dwarf the other worthy
attractions in town, but Padua’s historic district is delightful and full of
artistic surprises, from its canals to its churches.
You can easily see the highlights in one day, but spending the night will
allow you to fully enjoy the town. In high season, or if you’re on a budget,
Padua also makes an excellent base for visiting Venice and the rest of the
region, as it has less expensive and much less crowded hotels.
Getting there
Padua is only 46 km (29 miles) from Venice’s airport (see Chapter 16),
and you can easily get to any destination in town by limousine or taxi.

Padova Radio Taxi (% 049-8704425; www.taxipadova.it) charges
27€ ($43) for one person, and the trip with Landomas (% 049-8808505;
www.landomas.it) costs 30€ ($48); you need to reserve at least 24
hours in advance.
On the main train route from Rome to the northeast, Padua enjoys excel-
lent rail connections (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it). The city is only
30 minutes from Venice, with trains running as frequently as every few
minutes during rush hour, for about 8€ ($13). The trip from Rome takes
four and a half hours and costs about 45€ ($72). Padua train station
(% 049-8751800) is on Piazza Stazione, a 10- to 15-minute walk from the
town’s major attractions. If you don’t feel like walking, though, you can
use the excellent bus service; a 75-minute ticket costs 1€ ($1.60), and
you can get a free bus map from the tourist office in the train station.
By car, Padua lies at the convergence of the east–west autostrada A4
with the north–south A13. Traffic in the historic district is restricted, so
you must park in one of the excellent town-run APS parking lots. P7 at
Via Da Bassano, P3 at Via Sarpi, and P2 at Via della Pace are all near the
train station, while P5 is at Piazza della Valle; charges range from 1€
($1.60) per hour to 25€ ($40) per day.
Spending the night
Many of Padua’s best hotels are in the modern part of town while only a
few can be found in the romantic historic district. Most belong to chains
or are old-fashioned, with kind service but somewhat drab décor. That
said, below is our selection of the best hotels within walking distance of
the major attractions.
Albergo Verdi
$$
Historic district
This small stylish hotel enjoys a great location 2 blocks from Piazza dei
Signori. Recently renovated, it offers clean, linear furnishings in its public
spaces. The moderately sized guest rooms are welcoming and simply dec-
orated. Bathrooms are small but modern. A nice touch is the bicycles
offered free for guest use.

The most popular hotel in town with businesspeople, the Plaza offers
accommodations in line with international standards — large, carpeted
rooms decorated with modern European furniture, as well as stylish public
areas — but is housed in a nondescript modern building. The nearby

Dining locally
Padua’s cuisine is typical Italian fare, with a Venetian influence. As a 
university town, it offers a variety of cheap lunch spots, particularly on
Piazza Cavour and along Via Matteotti, with everything from pasta and
pizza to sandwiches. In addition to our suggestions below, consider the
historic Caffè Pedrocchi (see later in this chapter).

The handwritten menu is a clear sign that everything at this refined restau-
rant is prepared fresh, based on market offerings. We loved the risotto con
scampi e Champagne (rice with prawns and Champagne) as well as the
gran tecia di crostacei “al Padovanino” (a medley of seafood). If you prefer
turf to surf, the splendid tagliata di filetto e guanciale (filet mignon with
bacon) is a sure thing. Save room for the delicious deserts: We are partial
to the pear and chocolate tart.

Down the street from the Basilica di Sant’Antonio, this moderately priced

some of the specialties are capitone (a local kind of eel), when it’s in

the superb antipasto buffet that can be a meal into itself; it includes a vari-
ety of preparations, from fried calamari to marinated zucchini.

Exploring Padua
If you visit while its warm, we highly recommend taking a boat tour of
the historic network of urban canals. These inner waterways have been
used for centuries and afford a very special view of Padua (see “More
cool things to see and do,” later in this section).
The highly recommended Associazione Guide Turistiche (% 049-
8209741; www.guidepadova.it) offers a variety of walking tours —
with classical, religious, scientific, and other themes — and will even
custom-design a tour for you. Prices vary, depending on the number of
persons and the length of the tour.
Although Padua isn’t very large and you can easily explore it on foot,
you may like the new hop-on/hop-off tour offered by CitySightseeing
(www.padova.city-sightseeing.it) from March through October.
Chapter 17: Padua, Verona, and Milan 345

Buses depart from Basilica di Sant’Antonio every hour or so between
9:50 a.m. and 6 p.m. The 11-stop route lasts one hour if you stay on
board. Tickets — sold on the bus and valid for 24 hours — cost 13€
($21) for adults and 6.50€ ($10) for children 5 to 15.
The Padova Card (% 049-8767927; www.padovacard.it) is an excel-
lent deal, granting one adult (and one child under 14) free public 
transportation and parking in the APS lots, admission to the 12 major
attractions in town (except the 1€/$1.60 reservation fee for the Scrovegni
Chapel), and discounts on other attractions, boat tours, CitySightseeing
tours, and other guided tours (see later in this chapter), as well as reduced
rates at participating hotels, restaurants, and shops. The 48-hour card
costs 15€ ($24), while the 72-hour card costs 20€ ($32). It is for sale at
the tourist information desks, some hotels, and the Scrovegni Chapel.
You will need to make reservations in advance (a minimum of 24 hours 
if you are paying by Visa or MasterCard, four days if you are paying via
bank transfer or by conto corrente postale, the Italian postal service) for
a precise time slot at the Scrovegni Chapel (see listing, below). Reser-
vations are also required for children under 6, even though they enter
for free.
The top attractions
Basilica di Sant’Antonio
Built in the 13th century, this basilica houses the remains of St. Anthony
of Padua (including his tongue, still amazingly undecayed). The construc-
tion’s distinctive Romanesque-Gothic style reveals Eastern influences,
most visible in the eight round domes and the several campanili (bell
towers) that are vaguely reminiscent of minarets. In front of the church is
one of Donatello’s masterpieces, the equestrian statue of Gattamelata,
with a true-to-life horse and rider. Several prominent Renaissance artists
worked on the church interior: Donatello sculpted the bronze crucifix,
reliefs, and statues on the high altar (1444–48), whereas the frescoes are
by 14th-century artists Altichiero and Giusto de’ Menabuoi. From the basil-
ica cloisters, you can access the Museo Antoniano, with a collection of
works of art from the basilica; the stars are a fresco by Mantegna and a
painting by Tiepolo. Attached to the basilica is the 14th-century Oratory
of San Giorgio (ring the gatekeeper in the adjacent building if it’s not
open), decorated with a fine cycle of frescoes by Altichiero da Zevio,
restored in 2000. Next door to the right is the Scoletta del Santo, a chapel
and guild house in the style of the Venetian Scole built in the 15th century.
The second floor was added at the beginning of the 16th century and dec-
orated with sculptures and paintings by various artists — among them
Titian, who left three beautiful frescoes.

Duomo and Baptistery
Built between the 16th and 18th centuries, Padua’s Duomo was partly
designed by Michelangelo. Behind the unfinished facade, the two points
of interest are the paintings in the Sacristy and the statues by Florentine
artist Giuliano Vangi in the new Presbytery. Attached to the Duomo is a
remarkable Baptistery dating from 1075 and recently restored; its interior
is a 14th-century masterpiece, completely decorated with beautiful fres-
coes by Giusto de’ Menabuoi that illustrate scenes from the lives of John
the Baptist and Christ. A vision of paradise is gloriously depicted on the
domed ceiling.
See map p. 342. Piazza Duomo. % 049-656914. Admission: Duomo free; Baptistery
2.50€ ($4), free with Padova Card. Open: Duomo Mon–Sat 7:30 a.m. to noon and

Closed Jan 1, Easter, and Dec 25.
Palazzo della Ragione
This was the heart of administrative and business life in medieval and
Renaissance Padua. The elegantly colonnaded structure on the ground
floor — built in 1218 — was the seat of the city’s courts of law and its
assembly hall. The upper level, known as the salone (Great Hall), was
added in 1306; it is a fine example of medieval architecture and one of the
largest of its kind in the world: one huge open hall measuring 81m x 27m
x 27m high (265 ft. x 89 ft. x 89 ft.) and topped with a beautifully crafted
wooden vaulted roof. The rich wall frescoes, illustrating religious and
astrological themes, date from the 15th century; they replaced the original
13th-century frescoes by Giotto and his school, which were unfortunately
destroyed by fire. The palazzo’s biggest conversation piece is a giant
wooden horse built for a jousting event in 1466. Today, after a complete
restoration that ended in 2002, the building houses special exhibitions.
Two open-air markets have been held since medieval times on either side
of the building: a fresh produce market on Piazza delle Erbe, and a fruit
and dry-goods market on Piazza della Frutta. Both were a lively and col-
orful affair then as they are today.
See map p. 342. Via VIII Febbraio, between Piazza delle Erbe and Piazza della Frutta.
% 049-8205006. Admission: 8€ ($13); free with Padova Card. Open: Summer
Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; winter Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–6 p.m. Closed May 1 and Aug 15.
Scrovegni Chapel and Musei Civici Eremitani (Civic Museums)
Built by banker Enrico Scrovegni as an act of contrition for his family’s ill-
gotten wealth (his father was an usurer) after prompting by Dante (who
put Enrico’s father, Reginaldo, in his Inferno), this simple chapel became a
real jewel under Giotto’s hands. Ironically, far from getting the family the
pardon they had hoped for, its construction — begun in 1303 — led local
monks to complain about the excessive luxury of the Scrovegni family. The
Chapter 17: Padua, Verona, and Milan 347

unusual design — windows on one side but not the other, no internal archi-
tectural decorations — made it a perfect canvas for Giotto’s work, and the
frescoes he executed are absolute masterpieces. The stories that he
depicts move from left to right: The top row or band contains scenes from
the life of Joachim and Anna, parents of the Virgin Mary; the middle and
lower levels of the chapel contain scenes from the life of Jesus. The fres-
coes broke with tradition in a number of striking ways: His composition is
dramatic rather than static, as in Byzantine art; he chose scenes that
weren’t usually depicted; and, above all, he represented human beings
with greater psychological realism.
The chapel is on the other side of the ruins of the Roman Arena and is
accessible from the museums’ courtyard. Often bypassed by harried
tourists, the museums include an upstairs picture gallery with paintings by
such great Venetian masters as Giorgione, Titian, Veronese, and Tintoretto.
The frescoes and the chapel are protected by a special access gate — 
filtering the air and controlling humidity and other factors — and the
number of visitors and the length of their stay are severely restricted (only
25 people every 30 minutes).
See map p. 342. Piazza Eremitani 8, off Corso Garibaldi. % 049-2010020. www.
cappelladegliscrovegni.it. Admission: 11€ ($18) adults; free with Padova
Card; children under 6 free. Mandatory reservations fee 1€ ($1.60) per person. Open:
Daily 9 a.m.–7 p.m. Closed Jan 1, Dec 25 and 26.
More cool things to see and do
 Founded in 1222, the University of Padua is Italy’s second oldest and
counted among its scholars Galileo Galilei. Moved to Palazzo del
Bo in the 16th century, it was the first university in the world to have
an Anatomy Theater, an architectural masterpiece by G. Fabrici
d’Acquapendente, built in 1594 (Via VIII Febbraio, off Piazza delle
Erbe; % 049-8273044 for reservations; www.unipd.it; Admission:
5€/$8). Here medical students observed dissections of cadavers
(sometimes in secret, for it was long forbidden by the church) in
order to learn about the human body. Visits are by guided tour
only; ticket sales start 15 minutes before each set visiting time with
a maximum of 30 people per visit (Mar–Oct Mon, Wed, and Fri at
3:15 p.m., 4:15 p.m., and 5:15 p.m.; Tues, Thurs, and Sat at 9:15 a.m.,
10:15 a.m., and 11:15 a.m.; Nov–Feb Mon, Wed, and Fri at 3:15 p.m.
and 4:15 p.m.; Tues, Thurs, and Sat at 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m.).
You can download a PDF brochure about the Palazzo from their
Web site.
 Like Venice, Padua is also a town of water, crossed by many canals — 
these link Padua to the Brenta river and, farther away, to Venice and
its Lagoon. During the Renaissance, rich Venetians had their coun-
try “houses” built along this river; many of these splendid villas were
designed by Palladio, one of the greatest architects of all time, noted
for the grace and balance of his designs. The Consorzio Battellieri
di Padova e Riviera del Brenta (Passaggio de Gasperi 3; % 049-
8209825; www.padovanavigazione.it) offers several boat tours,
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
348

all very interesting, but we particularly recommend the Urban Tour
of Padua’s historic district (about 40 minutes) along the town’s
canals, as well as the tour of the villas along the Riviera del Brenta,
which starts in Padua and brings you to Venice (a great way to get
into Venice). A number of other companies offer similar cruises at
comparable rates, so check with the tourist office to see which
works best for you (see “Information” under “Fast Facts: Padua,”
later in this chapter). Boats run from March to October.
 Caffè Pedrocchi (Via 8 Febbraio 1848 15, off Piazza Cavour; % 049-
8781231; www.caffepedrocchi.it) has been the main gathering
spot for the city’s intelligentsia since its opening in 1831. At that
time, Padua was under Austrian rule, and the cafe became a meet-
ing place for patriotic and political groups; it maintained this role
through the years, and as late as 1943 was the scene of a student
uprising against the fascist regime. Completely restored to its ele-
gant 19th-century glory, the cafe is open daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
(until midnight Thurs–Sat), and offers a great lunch, with a sea-
sonal menu, and live music — mostly jazz — in the evening. The
upper floor, Piano Nobile, retains its elegant 19th-century original
furniture and houses the Museo del Risorgimento (Admission: 3€/
$4.80; free with Padova Card; Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–12:30 p.m. and
3:30–8 p.m.), a collection of memorabilia from the political move-
ment that led to Italy’s unification. Closed two weeks in August.
 Padua boasts the world’s first Botanical Garden (Via San Michele,
behind the Basilica di Sant’Antonio; % 049-8272119; www.orto
botanico.unipd.it; Admission: 4€/$6.40, free with Padova Card;
Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1 p.m., summer also 3–6 p.m.), founded in
1545 as the garden for the university’s faculty of medicine, where
medicinal plants and herbs were grown. A pleasant and interesting
sight, it offers a unique collection of rare plants as well as the uni-
versity’s original library and collection of botanical specimens, but
there’s nothing dusty and academic about it: It’s organized like a
Renaissance garden and makes for a very pleasant stroll.

A town with ancient origins, as its famous Roman theater attests, Verona
is today a major economic hub. Its pretty historic district — rich in
Romanesque churches, beautiful squares, and attractive Renaissance
architecture — is now surrounded by a bustling, modern urban area,
which contributes to a lively cultural life without spoiling the unique
spirit of this beautiful medieval town.
You can easily visit the sights in a day, but if you’re fond of opera and
you’re visiting during the Arena opera season, we recommend you
spend the night and catch a show (see later in this section).
Getting there
Verona’s Aeroporto Valerio Catullo, in Villa Franca (% 045-8095666; www.
aeroportoverona.it), receives flights from most major destinations 
in Europe and Italy. Many low-cost airlines fly here, including Meridiana
(% 892928 in Italy, or 0789-52682 from abroad; www.meridiana.it),
which offers daily hour-long flights from Rome. The airport is compact;
in the arrivals lounge, you find a bank with ATM and a tourist info desk.
The airport is 16km (10 miles) from the center of town, a 15-minute drive
by taxi (you find a stand outside the airport). It’s about 20 minutes away
by Aerobus, the bus link to Verona’s train station; tickets costs 5€ ($8)
and buses leave every 20 minutes.
The train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) to Verona takes about 
80 minutes from Venice (11€/$18)and four and a half hours from Rome
(40€/$64). Trains arrive at the Stazione Porta Nuova, on Piazza XXV
Aprile (% 045-590688).

If you’re coming by car, Verona lies on autostrada A4. From Rome, it will
take you about six hours to cover the 505km (315 miles); from Venice,
about two hours for the 110km (68-mile) drive. Verona’s historic district
is closed to private cars, so you have to park — the main parking lot is
Arsenale (Piazza Arsenale 8; % 045-8303281).
Spending the night
Hotel Aurora

Piazza delle Erbe
Recently renovated, this hotel is housed in a 15th-century building and
offers nicely appointed guest rooms and a great location. Public spaces
feature exposed beams and terra-cotta tiled floors. Some of the guest
rooms offer views over the famous piazza — the one on the top floor even
has a balcony — and the bathrooms are of a decent size.

Arena
A couple of steps from the Roman Arena, this elegant yet moderately
priced historic hotel — which has been an inn since the 19th century —
occupies what was once a monastery. The hall is decorated with original
15th-century frescoes, and the good-sized guest rooms are furnished in
style, with some antiques and a careful attention to detail. Bathrooms have
all the comforts you’d expect; some are done in marble.

This small luxury hotel is very centrally located. Housed in a charming
18th-century building, it opens onto a delightful year-round garden. Both
the public spaces and the accommodations are very well kept, with a keen
attention to detail. The elegant guest rooms are all individually decorated
and have a lot of character: some with exposed brick walls and wooden
beams, others with canopied beds or private balconies. The hotel is acces-
sible to people with disabilities.

VERONESE
Opening onto what is arguably the most beautiful square in Verona, this
restaurant offers excellent food — true to the best Veronese traditions —
in a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Try the pike served with polenta
or the carrello dei bolliti (an assortment of boiled meats and sausages
served with several sauces).

VERONESE/WINE BAR/SEAFOOD
We love this restaurant for its atmospheric location and variety of venues.
You can choose between the wine bar on the upper floor with a menu
rooted in the local countryside tradition (we highly recommend the risotto
all’Amarone, a local wine), or the elegant restaurant on the ground floor,
with a gourmet seasonal menu centered on the freshest seafood; on the
menu, you might find the excellent chickpea puree with scallops and
bacon, or the tuna steak with raisins and withered tomatoes.

CREATIVE VERONESE
Il Desco doesn’t come cheap, but it is heavenly. The menu changes with
the seasons and the whims of the chef/owner, with such creations as foie
gras with pears and a local wine sauce, breast of guinea hen with
Jerusalem artichokes and a chocolate and balsamic vinegar sauce, and
tortelli di baccalà mantecato con pomodori e capperi (large ravioli filled with
cod in a tomato-and-capers sauce). Each fantastic dessert concoction is a
perfect balance of flavor and texture. The tasting menu for 115€ ($138) is
a gourmet celebration.

Exploring Verona
The best bus tour in town is offered June through September by the local
transportation authority: a 90-minute tour with audio guide (available in
several languages) and air-conditioned coaches. You need to make reser-
vations at least one hour in advance for Bus Romeo at % 045-8401207,
by e-mail at romeo@amt.it, at the AMT ticket booth by the train station,
at hotel reception desks in town, or at the two tobacconists on Piazza
Brà (nos. 6b and 26). Buses depart from Piazza Brà Tuesday through
Sunday four times a day (10 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3:30 p.m.), and
Saturday and Sunday with additional departures at 9 p.m. Tickets cost
15€ ($24) adults, 7€ ($11) youths 5 to 18. The 3:30 p.m. run on Saturday
has a live guide — in Italian or English — and includes a walking portion;
the cost is 5€ ($8) extra for adults and 3€ ($4.80) for youth.
The Verona Card (% 045-8077774; www.verona.com) is a great deal,
offering unlimited public transportation and free access to all major
attractions in town. It comes in two versions: an 8€ ($13) one-day pass
and a 12€ ($19) three-day pass, which you can purchase at any of the
participating sites, a number of hotels in town, and several tobacconist
shops, including those in the train station.
You can get a combination ticket for the five most interesting churches
in town — San Zeno, Duomo, Sant’Anastasia, San Lorenzo, and San
Fermo — for 5€ ($8). The ticket can be purchased at any of the partici-
pating churches (% 045-592813; www.chieseverona.it). Note that
these churches are included in the Verona Card above.
The top attractions
Arche Scaligere
These are the monumental tombs of the Scaligeri princes, enclosed in their
private cemetery adjoining the Romanesque church of Santa Maria Antica.
The wrought-iron gates bear the representation of ladders, the family’s
heraldic symbol. The grandest of the monuments is that of Cangrande I
(he was certainly top dog — his name means “Big Dog”), which stands
over the portal of the church and is crowned by his equestrian statue 
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
354

(a copy — the original is at the Castelvecchio; see later in this section).
The two other major monuments are for Cansignorio (more or less “Sir
Dog”) and Mastino II (“Mastiff”). All richly decorated, the monuments are
sculptural masterpieces. The church still contains part of a mosaic floor
believed to belong to the original 8th-century church. Tickets are sold at
the booth by the Torre dei Lamberti (see Piazza dei Signori, later in this
section).
See map p. 351. Via Arche Scaligere, off Via Sant’Anastasia and Corso P. Borsari,
near Piazza dei Signori. % 045-8032726. Admission: 2.50€ ($4); includes Torre dei
Lamberti; free with Verona Card. Open: June–Sept Mon 1:45–7:30 p.m.; Tues–Sun 9:30
a.m.–7:30 p.m. Closed Oct–May.
Arena (Roman Amphitheater)
This famous elliptical Roman arena dates from the reign of Diocletian (it
was built around A.D. 290) and remains in surprisingly good condition. The
inner ring is basically intact, though a 12th-century earthquake destroyed
most of the outer ring (only four of the arches remain). This was Italy’s
third-largest Roman amphitheater and the second most important to have
survived (after Rome’s Colosseum). The amphitheater’s overall length was
152m (499 ft.) and its height 32m (105 ft.); its 44 rows of seats could origi-
nally hold as many as 20,000 spectators, who watched gladiators and ani-
mals sparring. These days, however, the arena hosts more civilized
entertainment: One of the greatest experiences in Verona is attending an
opera or a ballet here.
See map p. 351. Piazza Brà. % 045-8005151. www.arena.it. Admission: 3.50€
($5.60), 1€ ($1.60) first Sun of every month; free with Verona Card. Open: Tues–Sun
8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.; Mon 1:30–7:30 p.m. Ticket booth closes 45 minutes earlier. During
the performance season (June–Aug), arena closes at 3:30 p.m.
Basilica di San Zeno Maggiore
A wonderful example of the Romanesque style and the most beautiful 
in northern Italy, this church and campanile were built between the 
9th and 12th centuries above the tomb of Verona’s patron saint (the orig-
inal church dates from the 4th and 5th centuries). The fascinating 11th-
and 12th-century bronze door panels illustrate San Zeno’s miracles; like
other works in this part of Italy (notably Venice), they reflect a mix of
Byzantine, Gothic, and Turkish influences. Over the entrance is the famous
Ruota della Fortuna (Wheel of Fortune), a beautiful rose window from
the early 12th century. Inside, the church is decorated with graceful
Romanesque capitals on the columns and frescoes (dating from the 12th
to 14th centuries). The timbered roof is still the original 14th-century one.
At the north end of the church, you can access the peaceful Romanesque
cloister.
See map p. 351. Piazza San Zeno, just west of the Arena. % 045-592813. Admission:
2.50€ ($4); free with Verona Card. Open: Mar–Oct Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–1 p.m. 
and 1:30–6 p.m., Sun and holidays 1–6 p.m.; Nov–Feb Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–1 p.m. and

Castelvecchio and Ponte Scaligero
The 14th-century Castelvecchio, perched over the Adige river, was the
fortress and residence of the Scaligeri family, set to defend the famous
bridge Ponte Scaligero. Built between 1355 and 1375, the bridge was
destroyed by the Nazis during their retreat at the end of World War II, but
was painstakingly rebuilt like an enormous puzzle, using the pieces that
remained in the river. Today, this castle, complete with crenellated towers
and walls, houses the Museo Civico d’Arte, a rich picture gallery con-
taining paintings by great local artist Paolo Veronese and his school, as
well as Venetian artists like Tiepolo and Tintoretto. The castle itself is
worth a visit for its labyrinthine passageways and its tower, from which
you can enjoy sweeping vistas of the city and its environs. In the court-
yard is the equestrian statue of Cangrande I.
See map p. 351. Corso Castelvecchio 2, at the western end of Corso Cavour. % 045-
594734. www.comune.verona.it/Castelvecchio/cvsito. Admission: 4€
($6.40), free the first Sun of each month and with Verona card. Audio guide: 3.60€
($5.80). Open: Mon 1:30–7:30 p.m.; Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Ticket booth closes
at 6:45 p.m.
Piazza dei Signori
One of northern Italy’s most beautiful piazze, surrounded by equally beau-
tiful palaces, this square was the center of Verona’s government during its
heyday. The Palazzo del Governo is where Cangrande della Scala (one of
the first Scaligeri) extended the shelter of his hearth and home to the flee-
ing Florentine poet Dante Alighieri. A marble statue of Dante stands in the
center of the square in memory. The Palazzo della Ragione, on the south
side of the piazza, was built in 1123 but underwent changes many times in
later centuries, including receiving a Renaissance facade in 1524. From its
courtyard rises a medieval tower, the majestic Torre dei Lamberti
(84m/277 ft.), also called the Torre del Comune. An elevator takes you to
the top, where the views are magnificent. (At press time the tower was in
the process of scheduling a special opening until midnight on Fri and Sat
from June to mid-Sept.) On the north side of the piazza is the 15th-century
Loggia del Consiglio, which was the town council’s meeting place; it’s sur-
mounted by five statues of famous Veronese citizens, and five arches lead
into Piazza dei Signori.
See map p. 351. Torre dei Lamberti: Cortile Mercato Vecchio. % 045-8032726.
Admission: Oct–May 1.50€ ($2.40), elevator 0.60€ ($1); June–Sept 2.10€ ($3.40) 
and includes Arche Scaligere, elevator 0.50€ (80¢); free with Verona Card. Open:
Mon–Thurs 1:30–8:30 p.m.; Fri–Sun 8:30 a.m.–10 p.m. Ticket booth closes 30 minutes
earlier.
Piazza delle Erbe
This has been the seat of the market since Roman times — it was built on
top of the Forum — and today, Veronese shoppers and vendors still mill
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
356

about, surrounded by Renaissance palaces. The lively market should not
distract you from the beauty of this piazza, graced in the center by the
Berlina — a canopy supported by four columns where the election of 
the town’s signore (elected prince) and the podestà (the governor) took
place — and surrounded by medieval palazzi: the early-14th-century Casa
dei Mercanti (House of the Merchants), restructured in 1870 to restore
its original 1301 form; the baroque Palazzo Maffei; the adjacent Torre del
Gardello, a tower built in 1370; and the Casa Mazzanti, another Scaligeri
palazzo, decorated with frescoes. On the north side is a 14th-century foun-
tain flanked by the venerated Madonna Verona, which is actually a
restored Roman statue.
See map p. 351. Intersection of Via Mazzini and Via Cappello.
More cool things to see and do
 Shakespeare’s Capulets and Montagues from his play Romeo and
Juliet were indeed versions of two historical Veronese families, the
Capuleti (or Cappello) and the Montecchi. The Casa di Giulietta
(Juliet’s House), at Via Cappello 23 (% 045-8034303; Admission:
3.50€/$5.60; free with Verona Card; Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–
7:30 p.m., Mon 1:30–7:30 p.m.; ticket booth closes at 6:45 p.m.) is 
an original 12th-century house, but no proof exists that a family 
of Capulets ever lived here. People flock here anyway, to see the
balcony where Juliet would have stood if she’d been here at all.
Tradition calls for you to rub the right breast of the bronze statue
of Juliet for good luck. Of course, you can’t have a Juliet without a
Romeo, and the so-called Casa di Romeo (House of Romeo) at Via
Arche Scaligere 2 (east of Piazza dei Signori), is the 13th-century
house said to have been the home of the Montecchi family. It 
now contains an atmospheric restaurant, the Osteria del Duca
(% 045-594474), serving excellent Veronese fare for lunch and
dinner Monday through Saturday. Reservations are not accepted; 
a prix-fixe menu is available for 13€ ($21).
 The Fresco Museum and Juliet’s Tomb are housed in the 13th-
century complex of San Francesco al Corso (Via Shakespeare; 
% 045-8000361). The museum displays an interesting collection 
of frescoes from a number of buildings in Verona, as well as 19th-
century sculptures, and a sarcophagus that, according to legend,
holds the bodies of Romeo and Juliet. The adjoining church is deco-
rated with 15th-, 16th-, and 17th-century paintings. The complex 
is open Monday from 1:30 to 7:30 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday
from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., and the ticket booth closes at 6:45 p.m.
Admission is 3€ ($4.80) per person; free the first Sunday of each
month.
 The Basilica di Sant’Anastasia (Piazza Sant’Anastasia; % 045-
8004325; Admission: 2.50€/$4; free with Verona Card; Open:
Mar–Oct Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun and holidays 1–6 p.m.,
Chapter 17: Padua, Verona, and Milan 357

Nov–Feb Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–1 p.m. and 1:30–4 p.m., Sun and holidays
1–5 p.m.) is Verona’s largest church. Built between 1290 and 1481, it
is graced by an unfinished Gothic facade adorned by a beautiful
arched portal and an ornate campanile. Although the architecture
(rather than the contents of the church) is its noblest feature, the
Cappella Giusti does contain a Pisanello fresco of San Giorgio pic-
tured with a princess, while the Cappella Pellegrini has terra-cotta
works by Michele da Firenze.
 If you’ve ever wondered what an Italian garden should really 
look like, visit the Giardino Giusti (Via Giardino Giusti 2; % 045-
8034029). Built in the 14th century and given its current layout in
the 16th, this Renaissance garden has survived more or less intact
over centuries, and is now one of the most famous in Italy. Crossed
by a main alley lined with cypress trees, the garden is embellished
with grottoes, statues, and fountains. From a balcony at one end of
the garden, you can enjoy a panoramic view of the city. It’s open
daily in summer, from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., and until sunset in winter;
admission is 5€ ($8).

Milan: Italy’s Business and Fashion Center
The economic heart of Italy’s main industrial and manufacturing region,
the city’s charm as a tourist destination is tarnished by its fast-paced
modern Milanese lifestyle and its inclement weather, which includes
much fog in winter and steamy heat in summer. Still, Milan is a city 
of art, with deep historical roots, and it’s home to several gems —
including one of the best art galleries in Italy — making it well worth 
a detour. You can see the highlights in one day, but we recommend
spending the night if you can spare the time.
Getting there
Milan’s international airport of Malpensa (% 02-74852200), located
50km (31 miles) north of the city, has the dubious distinction of being
called “the worst airport in Europe,” but that’s mainly due to the fre-
quent fog that causes significant delays. In winter, Italians try to avoid
flying to this airport. If you do land here, you can take the frequent
(every 30 minutes) Malpensa Express Train to the Cadorna train sta-
tion, a 40-minute ride, or the shuttle bus (every 40 minutes) to the
Milano Centrale train station, a 50-minute ride. Count on spending over
70€ ($112) for a taxi ride, which, depending on traffic, could take you
over an hour.
The smaller Linate Airport (% 02-74852200) is only 10km (61⁄4 miles)
east of the city and has far fewer delays; it handles some European and
most domestic flights. From here, it’s a 15-minute taxi ride to the center
of town. If you have no luggage, you can take the frequent (every ten
minutes) city bus (no. 73) to the M1 subway line.
Milan is easy to reach by train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it): The
trip from Rome lasts about five hours — or four hours on the faster busi-
ness train that makes two trips daily — and costs about 40€ ($64). Most
long-distance trains arrive at Milano Centrale, on Piazza Duca d’Aosta.
We do not recommend driving to Milan: Although plenty of autostrade
lead to the city, it’s an absolute nightmare of traffic at most times, and
safe parking garages are expensive (do not leave your car on the street
for lengthy stays). If you need to, take the exit MILANO CENTRO for the his-
toric district — and good luck.
Getting around
Milan’s historic district is fairly large, and you have to use some form of
transportation to visit the attractions. Besides taxis, you might want to
use the metro (subway), which is the fastest and simplest means of get-
ting around; buses and trams are also convenient, but slow in traffic.
Buses, trams, and subways use the same tickets, which are sold at news-
stands, tobacconists, and bars. A 75-minute ticket costs 1€ ($1.60), but

Spending the night
As Italy’s business center, Milan has hundreds of hotels to chose from.
Keep in mind that it is an expensive destination and you have to pay
more than you expect to secure a nice room in the historic district. 
Top-tier hotels — generally geared toward business travelers — tend 
to offer good weekend deals.
Antica Locanda Leonardo
$$
Historic district
This is a gem: a small, family-run hotel where you get individual attention
and accommodations at moderate rates right in the heart of the historic
district. In a 19th-century building overlooking a courtyard garden — 
perfect for a relaxing moment, especially in spring when the wisteria is in
bloom — it offers spacious guest rooms done in classic style with period
themes ranging from Liberty to rococo to modern. Bathrooms are small,
but immaculately clean. You find two computers with Internet access for
guest use. Make sure you reserve your room in advance, since this hotel
is no longer a well-kept secret.

Four Seasons
$$$$
Historic district
This is the place to stay in Milan, a kingdom of elegance and whispered
luxury. In a 15th-century convent, whose columned cloister now forms an
inner courtyard, it boasts frescoes, marble floors, and convenient prox-
imity to the chic shopping area of Via Montenapoleone — it isn’t far from
Brera and the Duomo, either. The rooms are large and tastefully decorated,
with modern and antique details and state-of-the-art marble bathrooms.
The service is top-notch, and children receive special attention (milk and
cookies, video games). It comes at a price, of course, but the hotel does
run weekend and other specials. The on-site restaurant Teatro is very
good and its risotto alla Milanese was recently voted the best in town.

Historic district
In a good central location, the Manzoni is an affordable choice in an expen-

large by Italian standards and nicely outfitted in marble.

Dining locally
Though Milan is an expensive city — even the cheaper eateries are more
expensive than elsewhere in Italy — you can eat very well here.
Cracco Peck

Duomo
CREATIVE MILANESE
Attached to the gourmet shop and cellar Peck, serving discerning Milanese
since the 19th century, this is not only a gourmet temple but also one 
of the best restaurants in Italy. The chef delights in revisiting traditional
classics — witness his perfect saffron risotto and superb roasted 
meats — but also in creating new dishes with a unique mix of flavors and
textures, such as the midollo alla piastra con fave e cioccolato (grilled bone-
marrow with chocolate and fava beans). The offerings change often; you
can also choose one of the two tasting menus.

Historic district
CREATIVE ITALIAN
This wonderful place is one of the best restaurants in Milan: Using simple
yet excellent ingredients (personally chosen by the chef from small local
producers throughout Italy), the chef prepares dishes that vary with the
seasons and his own whims. We loved the ricottine mantecate agli asparagi
(baby ricotta sautéed with asparagus), the zuppa etrusca profumata al
finocchio selvatico (vegetable and legume soup with wild fennel), and the
trio di pesce con tortino di melanzane—triglia (red mullet), gallinella (“tub
fish”), and prawns with eggplant torte. The small lunch tasting menu is
35€ ($56), while the seven-course dinner tasting menu is 98€ ($157).

Navigli
CREATIVE MILANESE
If you don’t mind stepping a bit out of the historic district to get to an area
popular with locals for nightlife (Navigli is a sort of small Venice, with
canals that have been mostly covered over), you find a small and moder-
ately priced gourmet hide-out. The menu changes often, but you will
always find the antipasto misto — a great selection of local cured meats
and marinated vegetables — and superb risotto (the one with artichokes
and mascarpone is excellent), accompanied by a good choice of wines by
the glass.

We always favor hop-on-and-off tours, the best of which in Milan is offered
by CitySightseeing (% 02-867131; www.milano.city-sightseeing.
it), with two lines covering the whole city. Tickets are valid for one day
on both lines and cost 20€ ($32) adult and 10€ ($16) youth 5–15; rides
start in Piazza Castello and are offered April through October, daily
every 45 minutes starting at 9:30 a.m. until 6 p.m.; November through

The top attractions
Brera Picture Gallery
Open since 1809 in a beautiful 18th-century palazzo, this art museum was
started by the Austrian Hapsburgs in the late 18th century for use by the
students at the attached Art Academy. During the Napoleonic period, how-
ever, it was vastly enlarged: first with artwork confiscated by the French
as they closed down churches and monasteries in the region, then by the
acquisition of two private collections of modern art. You can admire
famous paintings by masters from the 14th to the 18th centuries — such
as the Pala di Urbino, by Piero della Francesca; Sposalizio della Vergine,
by Raffaello; Cristo Morto, by Andrea Mantegna; and Cena di Emmaus, by
Caravaggio — as well as important 19th- and 20-century paintings by
artists such as Carrà and Morandi. More art decorates the loggias and
other halls of the palazzo.
See map p. 360. Via Brera 28. % 02-722631. www.brera.beniculturali.it.
Metro: M2 to Lanza or M3 to Montenapoleone. Admission: 5€ ($8). Open: Tues–Sun
8:30 a.m.–7:15 p.m. Last admission 6:30 p.m. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Castello Sforzesco
This castle embraces centuries of Milanese history and ruling clans: The
small defensive rocca built by the Visconti family in the 14th century was
enlarged to a palace by the Sforza family, who dominated Milan during 
the Renaissance. It was then developed as a military stronghold by 
the Austrian Hapsburgs during their domination of Northern Italy. 
Badly damaged during the Italian wars for independence in the 19th cen-
tury, it lay abandoned for decades before being restored to its original
Renaissance glory. Kids will love the crenellated walls, the underground
passages, and the towers; on Sundays at 3 p.m., the guided tour of the
castle’s secret walkways includes the crenellations. The tour costs 
13€ ($21) and you must make reservations at least three days before
through either Ad Artem (% 02-6596937; www.adartem.it) or Opera
d’Arte (% 02-45487399; www.operadartemilano.it).
The castello houses several museums. The Sculpture Museum, located in
the ducal public apartments, has a large collection ranging from Roman
times to the Renaissance, including the famous Pietà Rondanini by
Michelangelo, his last — and unfinished — work, finally visible again after
a lengthy restoration and cleaning. The Picture Gallery, located in 
the ducal private apartments, holds a collection of Italian art from the 13th
to the 18th centuries, including the Madonna in Gloria con Santi, by
Andrea Mantegna, and the San Benedetto, by Antonello da Messina. Also
on the premises is a great collection of arms and armor, along with a
museum of musical instruments dating from the 15th to the 19th centuries.
Underground is the archaeological collection, but it was closed for
restoration at press time.

Duomo and Museo del Duomo
This grandiose cathedral — second largest in Italy only to St. Peter’s —
covers about 10,034 sq. m (108,000 sq. ft.) and is 107m (356 ft.) high. Its
construction lasted for centuries: Founded in 1386, the facade was finally
completed at the beginning of the 19th century, and the last bronze portal
was done in 1965. Its exterior is decorated with about 3,400 statues and
135 marble spires; its 1,394 sq. m (15,000 sq. ft.) of windows feature around
3,600 different figures. Some of the best artists participated in the project,
a history illustrated by the huge collection of artwork in the Museo del
Duomo (Piazza Duomo 14, inside Palazzo Reale, first floor; Admission:
6€/$9.60; Closed for restoration at press time), including paintings, sculp-
ture, and stained-glass windows. In addition to the church itself, you can
visit the treasures and the two baptisteries — do not miss the one of San
Giovanni, from the fourth century — and climb up to the terraces (an ele-
vator is available). At the Duomo Infopoint (Via Arcivescovado 1) you can
buy tickets and rent audio guides.

and Terraces Feb–Oct daily 9 a.m.–5:45 p.m., Nov–Jan daily 9 a.m.–4:45 p.m.; last
admission 30 minutes earlier.
Santa Maria delle Grazie and Leonardo’s Last Supper
Built in the 15th century, this church was supposed to be the burial place
of Ludovico il Moro and his descendants; the beautiful sculpted cover for
the tomb is still here. But it’s not tombs that draw tourists from all over the
world: In the refectory of the church is the famous Ultima Cena, or Last
Supper, by Leonardo da Vinci. It was painted by the master with an exper-
imental technique (tempera over a plaster preparation) over four years of
work between 1494 and 1498. The fresco was already looking quite bad by
the end of the 16th century, so it required continuous repainting and
restoration during the following centuries. The most recent restoration
lasted 20 years and was completed in 1999; it removed the many previous
restorations, revealing Leonardo’s original work. Unfortunately, there are
many gaps, but what remains is still a wonderful example of artistic
achievement. Audio guides are available. Note: Advance booking is manda-
tory. You must arrive at the ticket booth 15 minutes before your sched-
uled admission or your reservation will be canceled.

More cool things to see and do
 The Basilica di Sant’Ambrogio is the church of Milan’s patron saint
and a fine example of a Romanesque church (Piazza S. Ambrogio
15; % 02-86450895; Metro: M2 S. Ambrogio; Admission: Church
free, museum 2€/$3.20; Open: Church daily 9 a.m.–12:30 p.m. and
3:30–5 p.m.; museum Wed–Sun 10 a.m. to noon and 3–5 p.m.; Closed
Aug). Originally built in 386 over the burial site of two martyrs,
Gervaso and Protaso, by Sant’Ambrogio himself (at the time a Roman
magistrate), it was later enlarged. Under the main altar is a ninth-
century artifact housing the church’s relics: the remains of the mar-
tyrs and of Sant’Ambrogio; it is decorated with scenes from the life
of Jesus in gold on the front, and the life of St. Ambrose in silver on
the back. The apse, now the chapel of San Vittore in Ciel d’Oro, is
the only visible part of the church that dates from the fifth century.
The Museum of the Basilica, recently reopened after a complete
overhaul, is also worth a visit. Of particular interest is the Urna
degli Innocenti, a jewelry masterpiece from the 15th century, and a
stucco portrait of Sant’Ambrogio from the 11th century.
 Navigli is a popular neighborhood for nightlife (see later in this
chapter), but its canals are also a great attraction during the day.
Both adults and kids will love taking a boat tour of these historical
waterways. The hour-long tours are offered by Navigli Lombardi
(% 02-33227336; www.naviglilombardi.it) on the hour starting
at 10:15 a.m. (Apr–Sept Fri–Sun). The cost is 12€ ($19) adults, and
children under 6 ride for free. Departures are from Alzaia Naviglio
Grande number 4. You can reserve online by registering at the site
above.
 Among the many other museums of Milan, you may enjoy visiting
the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana (Piazza Pio XI; % 02-806921; www.
ambrosiana.it; Metro: M1 or M3 to Duomo), the oldest museum
in town (opened in 1618). The art collection here includes the
Canestra, by Caravaggio; Madonna del Padiglione, by Botticelli; and
Musico, by Leonardo — although this last attribution is under
debate. It’s open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
(last entrance one hour earlier; closed Jan 1, Easter, May 1, and 
Dec 25); admission is 8€ ($13).
 The famous Teatro della Scala (see “Living it up after dark,” later 
in this section) is a landmark in the history of Milan and of Italian
opera. If you love theater and opera, you shouldn’t miss the 
interesting Museo Teatrale della Scala, in Palazzo Busca, near
Leonardo’s Last Supper (Corso Magenta 71; % 02-4691528; Metro:
M1 Conciliazione or M2 Cadorna). It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 
6 p.m.; admission is 5€ ($8).
 Take a stroll under the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (off Piazza
Duomo), a beautiful construction of wrought iron and glass cover-
ing four streets, built in the 1870s. Under the elegant canopy, you
find a number of shops, cafes, and small boutiques, where prices
are high and fashions are hot.

Shopping the local stores
The heart of Italy’s fashion industry, Milan means prêt-à-porter galore.
The most famous shopping street for clothing and accessories is the
world-renowned Via Montenapoleone, the fashion heart of Milan. Milan
is home to some of the most prestigious designers. You find the Alessi
showroom (Corso Matteotti 9; % 02-795726; Metro: San Babila) and
their sales outlet (Via Montenapoleone 19; % 02-76021199; www.alessi.
com; Metro: Montenapoleone) and Memphis (Via della Moscova 27; % 02-
6554731; Metro: Turati). The Golden Triangle — Via Montenapoleone with
the nearby streets of Via della Spiga and Via Sant’Andrea — is where you
find a variety of shops and boutiques along with some of the top names in
Italian fashion (Valentino and Versace are on Via Montenapoleone, Dolce
& Gabbana is on nearby Corso Venezia, and Armani is on Via Manzoni).
The shopping district, which now contains more down-to-earth retail as
well, has spilled over all the way to Piazza Duomo.
If you aren’t interested in haute couture, another excellent shopping
area is the Brera district. In its back streets — Via Solferino, Via
Madonnina, Via Fiori Chiari, and so on — you find elegant boutiques,
with many designer names (including the young and trendy); antiques
and bric-a-brac stores; and open-air market stalls. On the third Saturday
of each month, the stretch of Via Brera near La Scala houses a large
open-air market of antiques and knickknacks.
Another excellent shopping area is Corso Buenos Aires, off Piazza
Oberdan, for everything from designer clothes to scuba equipment.
Living it up after dark
Milan has a vibrant nightlife, offering hundreds of performances,

Outlets, please
If you aren’t visiting during sale periods (Jan and July), you may want to hit a few dis-
count stores or outlets. Such places often sell the previous season’s looks and items
that have been worn on the runways. The discounts are excellent, though, and the
atmosphere often competitive. D Magazine Outlet is right on Via Montenapoleone, at
no. 26 (% 02-76006027). Others are a bit farther away, such as Biffi (Corso Genova 6;
% 02-8311601; Metro: San Ambrogio), which specializes in women’s wear in the main
store and men’s across the street. Another recommended shop — far from a secret
anymore, unfortunately — is Il Salvagente (Via Bronzetti 16; % 02-76110328), with a
large array of women clothes. There’s also a small children’s section at Via Balzaretti
28 (% 02-26680764; Metro: San Babila).

of information is the free magazine MilanoMese, distributed in tourist
offices, theaters, bookshops, and other locations around town, and 
available for download at the tourist office’s Web site (see “Fast Facts:
Milan” at the end of this chapter). Another useful free publication is Un
Ospite di Milano, which is available at many hotels (www.unospitedi
milano.it).
For opera fans, attending a performance at the grand Teatro della Scala
(Piazza della Scala; % 02-72003744; www.teatroallascala.org) is an
unforgettable experience. With wonderful acoustics and movable high-
tech stages, the theater hosts some of the world’s best performances.
You need to reserve tickets well in advance. Prices range from 10€ to
90€ ($16–$144).
The city hosts concerts from every genre. You find classical music at the
Conservatorio (Via Conservatorio 12; % 02-7621102; www.consmilano.
it) and the Auditorium (Largo Gustav Mahler), with concerts organized
by Milan Symphonic Orchestra (www.orchestrasinfonica.milano.
it) and the Quartetto per Milano (www.quartettomilano.it). For
pop, rock, and jazz, the best venues are Salumeria della Musica (Via
Antonio Pasinetti 2; % 02-56807350; www.lasalumeriadellamusica.
com), where you can enjoy mostly jazz, but also other concerts, while
you savor local wines, cheese, and cured meats; Rolling Stone (Corso 22
Marzo 32; % 02-733172; www.rollingstone.it) is a disco and a con-
cert hall showcasing, you guessed it, rock; Alcatraz (Via Valtellina 25; 
% 02-69016352; www.alcatrazmilano.com) is another popular dance
club, which occasionally has live music. The recently opened Blue Note
(Via Pietro Borsieri 37; % 02-69016888; www.bluenotemilano.com)
specializes in jazz.
For a simpler evening out, head to one of the two major nightlife destina-
tions in Milan. The more elegant Brera district gives a taste of trendy
“Old Milan,” with narrow streets and alleys. It used to be the artsy neigh-
borhood of Milan, but it has become much more classy and established;
expect sleek joints and stylish restaurants. More casual, the areas of
Porta Romana, Porta Ticinese, and the Navigli district — a charming
neighborhood of narrow streets and canals (although most of them have
been paved over) — are where you find lots of trendy bars, small restau-
rants, clubs with live music, and hangouts for young people. Aperitivo
has recently been renamed “happy hour” in Milan, and elaborate cock-
tails are accompanied by more substantial munchies: The most chic
venue is Magenta (Via Carducci 13; % 02-8053808; www.barmagenta
100.com), a historic cafe dating back to 1907. Other good spots are
Roialto (Via Piero della Francesca 55; % 02-34936616), a huge bar
inside an industrial space; Volo (Via Beatrice d’Este 36; % 02-58325543),
with a great outdoor space for warm nights; and Palo Alto (Corso di
Porta Romana 106; % 02-58314122). Our favorite enoteche (wine 
bars) include Cotti (Via Solferino 42; % 02-29001096; www.enoteca
Chapter 17: Padua, Verona, and Milan 369

cotti.it), open until the wee hours; Ronchi (Via S. Vincenzo 12; % 02-
89402627) and its wine museum; and Enoteca Wine & Chocolate (Foro
Buonaparte 63; % 02-862626), which also hosts chocolate tastings.
Dance clubs include Club Due (Via Formentini 2; % 02-86464807;
Metro: Lanza; Open: Daily), with a pleasant piano bar upstairs and a
disco in the basement; Hollywood (Corso Como; % 02-6598996; Metro:
Garibaldi or Moscova; Open: Tues–Sun) for some of the hottest sounds
in town; and for an elegant nostalgic atmosphere, Gimmi’s (Via Cellini 2;
% 02-55188069; Open: Thurs–Tues), where after-dinner dancing is to
tunes from the 1960s and ’70s (jacket required).
Milan is also the center of Italy’s gay scene. Via Sammartini, behind the
train station, is said to be the only gay street in all of Italy. Many of the
discos in town host gay nights; but the most established gay disco is
Nuova Idea International (Via de Castillia 31; % 02-69007959; Metro
Garibaldi; Closed Mon). Popular among straight folks as well, After Line
(Via Sammartini 25; % 02-6692130; Open: Daily) is a mostly lesbian
disco and restaurant. The G-lounge (Via Larga 8; % 02-805-3042) is a
trendy disco/bar with quality music.

N
aples is the capital of Campania, the beautiful region
south of Rome. Campania is in many ways the heart of
Italy — warm, welcoming, and mysterious. Its natural beauty
has been famous since antiquity, and its history has made it a
treasure-trove of ﬁne art.
Chapter 18 covers the best of Naples, a city that borrows some 
of its character from Mount Vesuvius — the unpredictable
volcano in whose shadow the city lies — and is ebullient with
cultural happenings and treasures. Naples opens onto the most
beautiful gulf in Italy: Chapter 19 guides you to excursions
along these shores and beyond, including the splendid Royal
Palace of Caserta, the picturesque Greek and Roman ruins in
the Campi Flegrei, and Vesuvius, with its ring of ancient Roman
towns that were violently and instantly destroyed by the vol-
canic eruption in A.D. 79. Finally, in Chapter 20, we explore
the most beautiful area of all: the Sorrento Peninsula, with 
the mythical isle of Capri at its tip, and the most celebrated
stretch of Italian coast, the justly renowned AmalﬁCoast. All
have entranced the artistic and well-to-do since the Roman
Emperor Tiberius rioted in Capri with his playthings.

B
eyond the daunting traffic and noise of Naples is a seductive 
place — rich in art, churches, historic sites, and character — and
one of the most vital cities anywhere. In a sense, if you haven’t seen
Naples, you haven’t seen Italy. After the cultural renaissance begun in
the 1990s, the historic district of Naples welcomes its visitors as never
before, revealing again to our astounded eyes its many treasures.
Refurbished monuments and areas reclaimed for pedestrians (still too
few) make it a very enjoyable destination for art lovers.
We highly recommend spending at least one night in Naples, although
you would really need at least three to do it justice. Naples is also an
excellent starting point for exploring other nearby sites (see Chapter 19)
and a perfect jumping-off point for Sicily (see Chapters 21 and 22).
Getting There
Naples is a major harbor and transportation hub, making it easy to reach
from most other destinations.
By air
The small but well-run Aeroporto Capodichino (% 081-7896259; www.
gesac.it) receives daily flights from Italian and other European desti-
nations, including connecting flights from the United States. Most major
airlines and several budget ones fly here. Here are a few tips for getting
through the airport and to your hotel:
 Getting oriented at the airport: Capodichino is easy to navigate.
You find a bank with an ATM, a currency-exchange booth, and a
tourist information desk in the arrivals concourse.

 Navigating your way through passport control and Customs: As
most flights to Naples originate from within the European Union,
you probably will have passed through passport control at your
intermediate stop, in which case you go directly to baggage claim
here and then go through Customs.
 Getting from the airport to your hotel: The airport is about 7km 
(4 miles) from the city center, only 15 minutes away. The easiest
way to get into town is by taking a taxi directly to your hotel; the
flat rate is 20€ ($32), plus gratuities. You can also arrange for a 
limousine pickup through your hotel, but you have to pay about
35€ ($56). A cheaper alternative is the shuttle bus Alibus (% 800-
639525; www.anm.it), which costs 3€ ($4.80). It stops on Corso
Garibaldi near the Napoli Centrale train station, as well as in Piazza
Municipio, at the heart of the historic district. Departures are every
30 minutes.
 If you are planning to use Alibus and public transportation to
explore the region, you might want to purchase the newly intro-
duced transportation pass Unico Campania 3T, which grants
unlimited transportation within the region (including on local
trains and buses) for three days at a cost of 20€ ($32).

Taxi tips in Naples
Neapolitans get a bad rap for trying to rip off tourists whenever the occasion presents
itself, and gypsy cabs are largely to blame. Always use only official taxis: They’re white
(the old yellow ones have mostly disappeared) and clearly marked on the outside with
Comune di Napoli (Naples municipality), while inside you see a meter and a town
license bearing the code number, as well as a card with rates and a list of flat-rate
destinations (20€/$32 from Capodichino airport to hotels in the historic district;
9.50€/$15 from Piazza Municipio to Museo di Capodimonte, and so on). If your ride is
a flat-rate one, the meter will be turned off. Regular meter rates are 4.50€ ($7.20) min-
imum charge, 3€ ($4.80) initial charge (Mon–Sat 7 a.m.–10 p.m.) and 5.50€ ($8.80) other
times, plus .05€ (10¢) for every 65m (213 ft.) or 10 seconds. Additional fees for calling
a radio taxi are 1€ ($1.60); each piece of luggage is .50€ (80¢); and a 10 to 15 percent
gratuity is expected, especially since these rates have been increased minimally since
the 1990s.
Although most licensed taxi drivers are honest, you can always happen upon a bad
apple who pretends his meter is broken in order to charge a little more. If this hap-
pens to you, take another cab. If you’re picked up at your hotel or at a restaurant, ask
your concierge or waiter for an estimate of what a reasonable fare may be to your
destination, and get a quote from the taxi driver before boarding: If it is not extravagant,
it is probably correct; if it doesn’t seem right, demand an explanation in order to avoid
surprises.

Ferry Route

By train
With the recent introduction of daily high-speed train service to Naples,
the trip from Rome takes only 87 minutes. Trains to Naples (% 892021;
www.trenitalia.it) run frequently and take two and a half hours 
from Rome for a cost of 20€ ($32), four and a half hours from Florence
for a cost of 35€ ($56), and seven and a half hours from Venice for 50€
($80). Trains arrive at Napoli Centrale, also known as Stazione Centrale
(Piazza Garibaldi; % 081-5543188), on the northeastern edge of the 
historic district. A tourist information point is in the station. Outside the
station, you find taxis; and on Piazza Garibaldi, across from the station,
is the main bus hub, with urban and suburban buses and trams (bus 
R2 and tram 1 both go to the city center). The subway station (for both
Metropolitana and Cumana rail) is under the rail station.
By ferry or ship
Naples’s harbor is the major port of central Italy, with ferries and cruise
ships stopping on their way to and from Capri, Sorrento, Salerno, the
Amalfi Coast, and Sicily (see Chapters 20, 21, and 22 for rates and sched-
ules) as well as other destinations in the Mediterranean and beyond.
Arriving by water is the best way to approach Naples: You will get the
full effect of the magical beauty of the bay, and you will arrive in the
heart of town, where most of the attractions lie. Most ships and ferries
arrive at the Stazione Marittima seaport (% 081-5523968; www.porto.
napoli.it), off Via Cristoforo Colombo in the heart of the historic dis-
trict. Other ferries and most hydrofoils (service suspended in winter)
arrive at the Terminal Aliscafi in Mergellina, to the west of the his-
toric district. You see taxis and public transportation right outside the
terminal.
By car
Naples is infamous for car thefts, which can occur even in guarded 
parking lots. Also, the aggressive driving style of the Neapolitans makes
taking a car into town challenging, even for Italians, and we do not rec-
ommend it. If you think you need a car to explore farther destinations
such as the Amalfi Coast, see Chapter 20 for better options.
Orienting Yourself in Naples
Historically and geographically oriented toward the sea, Naples 
developed like a crescent around its bay, its high cliffs surrounding a
perfect harbor. Up the cliff is Vomero, and farther to the northeast is
Capodimonte. At sea level is the historic district, stretching from Castel
Capuano (not far from Piazza Garibaldi and the rail station) to the east,
to the Museo Archeologico Nazionale n the north, to Via Cristoforo
Colombo and the seaport to the south, and to Via Toledo with the
Quartieri Spagnoli in the west. The northern portion of the historic dis-
trict is organized along three main east–west streets: Via dei Tribunali,
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
378

Via Benedetto Croce and its continuation Via Biagio dei Librai, and
Corso Umberto I. The southern portion of the historic center revolves
around Piazza Municipio and Piazza del Plebiscito. It is the civic heart
of Naples, with the town hall and two former royal palaces.
West of the historic district is the fashionable waterfront, with the 
neighborhoods of Santa Lucia and Chiaia, followed by Posillipo and
Mergellina — two nice suburbs of Naples.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Capodimonte
Overlooking the bay from a separate hill, Capodimonte is a middle- and
lower-class residential neighborhood that developed to the west and
north of its major landmarks: the royal palace housing the Museo di
Capodimonte, with its park, and the nearby Catacombs, which are the
only reasons to come to this otherwise uninteresting area.
Chiaia
Stretching along Naples’s fashionable seafront, behind the pleasant
green of the beautiful Villa Comunale gardens, this elegant residential
area stretches up the slope toward the Vomero hill. Only a short distance
from the historic district, it is a major destination for chic shopping as
well as nightlife, especially along Via Chiaia and Piazza dei Martiri.
Hotels are few, and restaurants tend to cluster in the eastern area.
Historic district
Today the embodiment of “Neapolitanness” — laundry drying at win-
dows, mammas screaming at their kids down in the street, motor scoot-
ers rushing past, and so on — this is the city’s heart. Along these streets
are some of the most important attractions in Naples, particularly the
churches — Duomo, Santa Chiara, Sant’Anna dei Lombardi, San
Lorenzo Maggiore — as well as the university, which attracts a lively
nightlife scene and rich cultural activity. Hotels tend to cluster on the
southern edge of the area, whereas restaurants and small shops are
spread out everywhere.
Piazza del Plebiscito
The most beautiful piazza in Naples is closed to motorized traffic and
called il salotto — the living room — because it is where Neapolitans,
young and old, like to meet, especially in the evening. It is a short dis-
tance from everything important in the city: the Stazione Marittima, the
administrative and political offices of Piazza Municipio, the restaurants
and nightlife of Quartieri Spagnoli, Chiaia (Piazza dei Martiri is only
steps away), and Santa Lucia. Some of Naples’s best monuments are
here: Castel Nuovo, built by the Angevins as the center for their two-
century-long kingdom; Palazzo Reale, the Royal Palace built for the
Spanish rulers; and Teatro San Carlo. Off the piazza itself are a few
cafes.

Piazza Garibaldi
At the eastern edge of the historic district, within walking distance from
Castel Capuano, this huge square is Naples’s major transportation hub,
with bus, subway, and train stations (both Stazione Centrale and the
Circumvesuviana railroad to Pompeii, see Chapter 19). It is only a short
distance from some major attractions and offers hotels, restaurants, and
many shops. It gets a bit seedy at night, however.
Quartieri Spagnoli
A tight grid of narrow streets built by the Spanish in the 16th century to
house their troops, this picturesque neighborhood lies along the west
side of Via Toledo, a major street running north–south and lined with
elegant palaces and fashionable shops. It’s well-located near the major
attractions and a few very nice restaurants and hotels. Streets further off
Via Toledo can be a bit sketchy at night.
Santa Lucia
Famous for its elegant hotels along the seaside promenade of Via
Partenope and the picturesque view over the bay, this small neighbor-
hood feels secluded from the rest of Naples — yet it’s only steps from
everything. Its landmark is the city’s most famous sight, Castel dell’Ovo,
the fortress built on a small island at the end of a causeway and stretch-
ing into the bay.
Vomero
The hill of the Vomero is an elegant, middle- and upper-class residential
neighborhood. The fresher air and the views attract visitors, especially
in the summer, and you find some good shopping and limited nightlife.
Its landmarks are the famous Castel Sant’Elmo and the Certosa di San
Martino, as well as the lesser known but splendid Villa La Floridiana.
Finding information after you arrive
The best tourist information offices in town are at Via San Carlo 9 (off
Piazza del Plebiscito; % 081-402394; www.inaples.it), Via Santa Lucia
107 (% 081-2400914), and Piazza del Gesù (% 081-5512701), all open
Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 to 7 p.m. 
You also find a small tourist info desk inside Stazione Centrale (Piazza
Garibaldi; % 081-268799; Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m.), but it tends to
have limited material.
Getting Around Naples
Naples is a large, bustling city, and you’ll welcome some form of trans-
portation to get from one attraction to the next.
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
382

The historic district of Naples is safe, but you will want to watch your
purse and your belongings carefully, especially in crowds: pickpockets
and purse-snatchers are a sad — and common — reality. At night, avoid
poorly lit and deserted streets; muggers are not unheard of.
On foot
You can cover a lot of ground on foot, and Naples offers beautiful walks,
particularly in Santa Lucia, Chiaia, and in the historic district where
some sections have been reserved for pedestrians only. The free map
from the tourist office is pretty good, but we like a map with a stradario
(street directory); you can get one from any newsstand. We also like the
wallet-sized Mini-City map, sold at the bookshops of Palazzo Reale and
other museums in town.
By subway, bus, funicular, and tram
Public transportation in Naples is good and extensive, including several
bus and tram lines (% 800-639525 toll-free within Italy; www.anm.it),
and a metro rail system (% 800-568866 toll-free within Italy; www.metro.
na.it), but gets rather crowded at rush hour. Those bus lines marked R
are quite useful since they stop at major attractions (daily 5:30 a.m. to
midnight), and the electric minibuses marked E serve the historic district.
Also useful is line 1 of the metro, and the three funicular (funivia) lines
that go up to Vomero: Montesanto, which runs daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.; 
Chiaia (Piazza Amedeo) and Centrale (Via Toledo), operating daily 
from 6:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. The urban railroad Cumana/Circumflegrea
(% 800-001616 toll-free within Italy; www.sepsa.it) is useful to reach
Pozzuoli and the Campi Flegrei (see Chapter 19) from Montesanto.
All public transportation uses the same tickets: the biglietto (ticket)
Unico Napoli, valid for unlimited travel for 90 minutes at a cost of 1.10€
($1.80); and the giornaliero (day pass), valid for unlimited travel for
one day at a cost of 3.10€ ($5) Monday to Saturday and 2.60€ ($4.20) on
Sunday. You can buy them at bars, tobacconists, and newsstands around
town. A public transportation pass is included with any purchase of the
Artecard (see p. 390 later in this chapter).
By taxi
Taxis don’t cruise around, so you have to find a taxi stand, or else call
for pickup (see “Fast Facts: Naples,” at the end of this chapter). Refer to
the sidebar “Taxi tips in Naples,” earlier in this chapter, for rates.
Staying in Style
As Naples attracts more and more visitors, the lodging scene becomes
more varied with higher standards. We love the new hotels that have
opened in the historic district.

Historic District
We love this hotel smack in the heart of the historic district, from the
Liberty (Italian Art Nouveau) palazzo in which it is housed — complete
with private garden and small swimming pool — to the courtesy and pro-
fessional service. The individually decorated guest rooms all open onto
the common terrace or onto private balconies. The modern furnishings
complement the hardwood floors or the hand-painted tiles. Bathrooms are
good-size and those in the junior suites have Jacuzzi tubs.

Grand Hotel Vesuvio
$$$$
Santa Lucia
The best in town and the most renowned, this elegant historic hotel is
expensive, but offers attentive, professional service and splendid views of
Mount Vesuvius and the bay of Naples, with Castel dell’Ovo in the fore-
ground. The bright and spacious guest rooms are individually decorated,
some with antiques. All have large marble bathrooms with Jacuzzi tubs.
The suites and the priciest doubles have balconies — but you can enjoy
the same breathtaking view from the excellent roof-garden restaurant,
Caruso. (Note: The restaurant was closed for renovation at press time; call
to make sure it’s reopened before planning a meal.)

Hotel Miramare
$$$
Santa Lucia
Built in 1914 as a private villa, this charming hotel right on the water offers
bright guest rooms with beautiful bathrooms — and many rooms have
views of the sea. Still personally run by the welcoming owner, this hotel is
decorated in the original Liberty style and breakfast is served on a terrace
overlooking the bay, while a second panoramic terrace is used as a solar-
ium. Guests here receive a 10 percent discount at La Cantinella, La
Piazzetta, Il Posto Accanto, Rosolino, and Putipù, all excellent restaurants
(some with nightclub) that feature Neapolitan cuisine and are run by the
owner’s brothers.

Chiaia
One of our favorite hotels in town, it is housed in an elegant 19th-century
palazzo with an inner courtyard garden in the heart of the lively shopping
district. The public spaces are grand with elegant marble floors and inter-
esting architectural details. Guest rooms are spacious and have all the
amenities, with fashionable furnishings mixed with period pieces. The
good-size bathrooms are clad in marble.

If you can do without public spaces, this hotel is the best value in Naples:
clean, functional accommodations and a great location in the heart of the
historic district, only steps from attractions and nightlife. The hotel occu-
pies the fourth and fifth floors of a residential building: access is via a coin-
operated elevator, which you need a .10€ piece to ride. Guest rooms are

Inside one of our favorite landmarks  in Naples — the upper floors of
Galleria Umberto I (see later in this  chapter) — this hotel is perfectly
located and eclectically decorated. Guest rooms are individually themed
on a specific artist, such as Klee or Van Gogh, with marble floors, com-
fortable four-poster beds in the best rooms, and elegant furnishings in
baroque or Liberty style. Bathrooms are  state-of-the-art. The rooms facing

In a 17th-century palace in the heart of Naples, this hotel offers carefully
restored guest rooms and pleasant public spaces at a moderate price.
Bedrooms have quality modern furniture and pastel plaster walls, many

few enjoy their own private roof gardens. The two duplexes with lofts are
great for those traveling with older kids. See map p. 380. Via Speranzella 137/a.

Dining Out
The cuisine in Naples is as sunny as the city and its people (see Chapter
2 for more on Neapolitan cuisine), and we love discovering new places
along Via Partenope (Santa Lucia), and in the narrow streets of the his-
toric district or around Piazza dei Martiri (Chiaia).
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast

Meal with a view
For a special occasion, the two best and most elegant restaurants in town are La
Terrazza dei Barbanti, in the San Francesco al Monte hotel (Corso Vittorio Emanuele
328; % 081-4239111; www.sanfrancescoalmonte.it; Closed Sun), and George’s
inside the Grand Hotel Parker’s (Corso Vittorio Emanuele 135; % 081-7612474;
www.grandhotelparkers.com; Open: Daily). Both offer unforgettable views
over the bay and romantic ambience, together with some of the finest cuisine. The
two chefs, Antonio Ticca at La Terrazza and Baciot (Vincenzo Bacioterracino) at
George’s, interpret the local culinary tradition with creativity and expertise. Expect to
pay about 50€ ($80) for dinner at La Terrazza and about 65€ ($104) at George’s, drinks
excluded.

Santa Lucia
NEAPOLITAN/PIZZA
The location is perfect, right along Via Partenope overlooking the pictur-
esque Borgo Marinari, in the shadow of Castel dell’Ovo. The food is equally
good at this popular restaurant. You find everything from seafood to meat
to pizza (40 different varieties) on the seasonal menu. Everything is freshly
made: We particularly recommend the buffet of appetizers, the scialatielli
ai frutti di mare (fresh pasta with seafood), and the polipetti in cassuola
(small squid stewed with tomatoes).

Brandi

Quartieri Spagnoli
PIZZA
Literally fit for a queen, this pizzeria opened in the 19th century and is the
place where pizza margherita was invented. It takes its name from
Margherita di Savoia, first queen of Italy, who graciously accepted having
a pizza named after her (how many sovereigns can say that?). Her name-
sake pizza comes with tomato, basil, and mozzarella — red, green, and
white, not coincidentally the colors of the united Italy. Brandi’s menu
includes a few appetizers — such as an excellent impepata di cozze (mus-
sels stewed with black pepper) — as well as pizza.

Reservations recommended. Bus: R2 or R3 to Piazza Trieste e Trento. Pizza: 6€–18€

Mergellina
NEAPOLITAN/SEAFOOD
One of Naples’s most historic addresses, Don Salvatore is beloved by locals.
Not far from the Mergellina ferry seaport, the restaurant occupies the
former boat sheds excavated from the tufa stone of the cliff, and maintains
the ambience of an authentic trattoria. Don’t miss the scrumptious grilled
fresh catch and the delicious linguine incaciate (linguine with Parmesan).
Round off your meal with a side of fresh vegetables (we love the friarelli,
broccoli rabe sautéed in olive oil), and finish with the perfect babà.

In this welcoming historic dining room, the chef offers tasty choices
inspired by local traditions. We recommend the zuppa di cannellini e cozze

(bean and mussel soup) and the pasta e patate con provola (pasta and
potatoes with melted local cheese), as well as the scorfano all’ acquapazza
(scorpion-fish in a light herbed broth). The pizzas are also very good.
Leave room for the great traditional desserts such as the babà (like a
liquor-soaked brioche with a dollop of pastry cream) and the pastiera (tart
filled with a creamy wheat-berry and candied-fruit mixture).

Vomero
NEAPOLITAN/PIZZA
This excellent neighborhood spot serves typical local food prepared with
a true love for cooking and good ingredients. The pizza is some of the best
you’ll taste in Naples, the dough prepared according to a century-old
family secret recipe, but we also recommend the other dishes on the menu. 
The soup changes daily and is always tasty, as are the pasta dishes — such
as splendid spaghetti with zucchini, tomatoes, and olives.

With a view of the grand buildings of the Piazza Plebiscito, and with outdoor
dining in good weather, this is a nice place to sample the city’s greatest culi-
nary contribution at moderate prices. In addition to fine brick-oven pizza,
the menu includes a full range of antipasti and vegetable dishes served buffet-
style. There’s a second location near the archaeological museum (Piazza
Dante 16, off Via Toledo), which is also open from lunchtime until 1 a.m.

Sweet breaks
If you have a sweet tooth, try the local specialties (see Chapter 2 for details) at the
Pasticceria Scaturchio (Piazza San Domenico Maggiore 19; % 081-5516944; Bus: R2),
one of the oldest pastry shops in town, established in 1903. Besides wonderful pastries,
you may also want to sample the Ministeriale, a medallion of dark chocolate with a
liqueur cream filling. Another excellent spot is Caffetteria Pasticceria Gelateria G.
Mazzaro (Via Tribunali 359; % 081-459248; www.pasticceriamazzaro.it),
which serves not only splendid pastries but also to-die-for gelato. For the best sfogli-
atella (ricotta-stuffed pastries) in Naples, head for the Gran Caffè Gambrinus (see

We enjoy the atmosphere at this waterfront local favorite: It feels like a 1930s

excellent antipasto and grilled seafood. Try the pappardelle “sotto il cielo di
Napoli” (homemade pasta with zucchini, prawns, and green tomatoes) and
the excellent fritto misto (deep-fried calamari, small fish, and shrimp). Do
not forget the wine — the selection is excellent — or the dessert (if you have

Offering great value for the money, “My Napoli” is one of our favorite finds
in the historic district. Because it is crowded with office workers at lunch,
you need to come early to secure a table. We rarely make it beyond the
scrumptious appetizers, but we recommend braving the rest of the sea-
sonal menu for some of the best pasta with zucchine e cozze (zucchini and
mussels) followed by delicious seppie ripiene (stuffed cuttlefish).

Our favorite Neapolitan pizza
We love authentic Neapolitan pizza, which is oh so different from its imitations. The his-
toric joints with décor that is dated or nonexistent are the places where the pizza is
what’s most memorable (together with the price, as an individual pizza never costs
more than 10€/$16). Besides Brandi (see earlier in this chapter), we highly recom-
mend Mattozzi (Piazza Carità 2; % 081-5524322; Closed Fri), one of the oldest pizzeria
in Naples, as well as Pizzeria Da Michele (Via Sersale 1, off Via Forcella; % 081-
5539204; www.damichele.net; Closed Sun), Pizzeria Di Matteo (Via dei Tribunali 94,
at Vico Giganti; % 081-455262; Closed Sun), and Pizzaiolo del Presidente (Via Tribunali
120; % 081-210903; Closed Sun). The latter is a recent addition, opened by the pizza
chef from Di Matteo (above), who personally served Bill Clinton during his visit in 1994
and named his pizzeria after the event.

Exploring Naples
If you’re planning extensive sightseeing, we recommend the Artecard
(% 800-600601 in Italy, or 06-39967650; www.campaniartecard.it).
The cheaper pass covers only Naples and the Campi Flegrei (see
Chapter 19); the more expensive versions cover the whole region,
including Herculaneum and Pompeii, Caserta, Sorrento, the Amalfi
Coast, and Paestum (see Chapters 19 and 20). All grant unlimited public
transportation within the area of coverage, free admission to two attrac-
tions, and a 50 percent discount on all other attractions. In addition, you
also get discounts at an extensive list of participating shops and enter-
tainment venues. The Naples version “Napoli e Campi Flegrei” is valid
three days and costs 13€ ($21), while the regional pass comes in a three-
day version for 25€ ($40) and a seven-day version for 28€ ($45). Cards
are for sale at all participating museums and attractions, as well as at
the Capodichino airport, the molo beverello (harbor), the train station of
Napoli Centrale, major hotels, and some news kiosks. If you are flying
into Naples and planning to use the Alibus into town, it is a good idea to
pick up your Artecard at the airport as the price of the bus is included.
We also recommend the CitySightseeing hop-on-and-off bus tour (see
“Seeing Naples by guided tour,” later in this chapter), which provides a
great introduction to the city as well as convenient transportation
between major attractions.
Discovering the top attractions
Declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1995, the historic district
of Naples is one of the richest art destinations in Italy. You just need to
go beyond your first impression of traffic, noise, and grime that this
bustling city gives off.
Capodimonte National Museum
Capodimonte
Built in the 18th century as the king’s hunting lodge and private museum,
this splendid palazzo has beautiful views of the city and bay. The holdings
are first-class and the museum regularly hosts special exhibits of inter-
national acclaim. Paintings from the permanent exhibit are organized 
following the original collections to which they belonged. The Farnese col-
lection alone includes Masaccio’s Crucifixion, Perugino’s Madonna and
Child, Brueghel’s Misanthrope, and works by several other masters, such
as Mantegna, Raphael, Titian, Caravaggio, and Botticelli. The Borgia col-
lection includes works by Mantegna and a number of Spanish artists. The
Neapolitan Gallery on the third floor has more works by Titian (his
Annonciation) and Caravaggio (his Flagellation), among others; the adja-
cent D’Avalos collection includes a celebrated 16th-century tapestry
series depicting the Battle of Pavia. The contemporary gallery on the 
third and fourth floors holds works by the likes of Alberto Burri, Jannis
Kounellis, and Andy Warhol. We also recommend a visit to the second

visit, which will take about two hours.

Carthusian Monastery of San Martino and Museum
Vomero
This wonderful monastery provides the perfect excuse to take Naples’s
famous funicular and visit the Vomero neighborhood. The monastery was
built in the 14th century over a natural terrace at the edge of the cliff, and
enlarged in the 17th century. Now a massive museum, its baroque church
is decorated with gorgeous marble floors and several works of art. The
Quarto del Priore, are the elegant apartments where the prior received
the VIPs of his time; among the artwork here is a Madonna by Pietro
Bernini, the father of the great Gian Lorenzo. The monastery centers
around two beautiful cloisters, the imposing Chiostro Grande — with a
marble cemetery enclosure decorated with carvings of skulls — and the
smaller Chiostro dei Procuratori. From here, you can enter the historic
presepi collection, with the most famous presepio (manger scenes) in the
world: the Cuciniello, created in 1879 using figures and accessories by
famous sculptors and architects from the 18th century.

Castel dell’Ovo and Borgo dei Marinari
Santa Lucia
A picturesque fortress built on a small promontory projecting into the
beautiful harbor, this is the most famous landmark in Naples. In Roman
times, the celebrated gourmand Lucullus had his villa in this idyllic spot.
The villa was fortified during the Middle Ages, and from those times comes
the legend that Virgil (the poet author of the Aeneid and a reputed magi-
cian) placed a magic egg under the castle’s foundations to protect it, hence
the name (ovo means “egg”). When he took over the city, Frederick II trans-
formed it into his castle, and his successors, the Angevins, later enlarged
it before moving to a new castle (see Castel Nuovo below). The castle is a
pretty sight from the famous seaside promenade of Via Partenope. Around
the castle is the picturesque Borgo Marinari, a fishermen’s hamlet that is
now dominated by restaurants. The castle itself is a fortified citadel, and
from its walls you can enjoy superb views of the city and the surrounding
bay. Today, it houses the Museum of Ethno-Prehistory (% 081-7645343;
Free admission; Open: Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–1 p.m.) and an exhibition hall
(admission charged during exhibits; 10 percent discount with Artecard,

Castel Nuovo (Maschio Angioino) and Civic Museum
Piazza Plebiscito
Built in the 13th century by Carlo d’Angiò of the Angevin dynasty as the
new royal residence — the Castel dell’Ovo didn’t fit the needs of the new
kingdom — it was renovated in the 15th century by Alfonso I of Aragon. He
added the grandiose Triumphal Arch over the inland entrance to com-
memorate his expulsion of the Angevins in 1443. The arch, a splendid
example of early Renaissance architecture, is the work of Neapolitan sculp-
tor Francesco Laurana. The Sala dei Baroni (Barons’ Hall) is a monu-
mental room with a star-shaped ceiling that was once decorated by Giotto
(his frescoes have been lost, however). Most of the sculptures that deco-
rated the room were destroyed by a fire in 1919. Today, the hall is the seat
of the Municipal Council. The castle also houses the Civic Museum, which
holds a collection of frescoes and paintings from the 14th century to the
20th century. Through the museum you can usually access the elegant
Cappella Palatina, but at press time it was closed for restoration. The
chapel was built in 1307; only the carved portal and rose window are from
the 15th century, when they replaced the originals that were destroyed by
an earthquake. The interior of this church was also completely decorated
by Giotto, but only a few fragments remain.

Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m.
Castel Sant’Elmo
Vomero
Built in the 14th century and completely redone in the 16th, this star-
shaped fortress overlooks the city from the top of a cliff, its daunting walls
visible from everywhere downtown. Its dungeons, halls, and terraces
affording 360-degree views of the city and bay are open to visitors.

Duomo and Museum
Historic district
This grandiose church — also known as the Cathedral of Santa Maria
Assunta — hides a treasure-trove of artwork inside. The monumental cen-
tral body, built in the 13th century, is supported by 110 ancient granite
columns; in the right transept you find Perugino’s Assunta and the
Cappella Minutolo, a Gothic marvel decorated with a mosaic floor and
frescoes. In the crypt below is the Cappella Carafa (also called Succorpo),
probably designed by the great Renaissance architect Bramante, and a
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
392

marvel of architectural elegance. To the right of the Duomo’s atrium opens
the Cappella di San Gennaro: A church more than a chapel, it is lavishly
decorated with marble and gold leaf — an apotheosis of Neapolitan
baroque — and a dome with a cycle of frescoes by Domenichino. If you
happen to visit on September 19, on the first Sunday in May, or on
December 16, you’ll see on display, over the main altar, the famous reli-
quary containing the skull and the vial with the blood of San Gennaro
(patron saint of Naples), said to miraculously liquefy on these dates — it’s
a sign of great misfortune for the town if the miracle doesn’t take place.
To the left of the Duomo’s atrium, you can access what’s left of Santa
Restituta, a paleo-Christian basilica from the sixth century that was incor-
porated into the Duomo when this was built. Redone in the 17th century,
only one of its chapels is still decorated with the original Renaissance art-
work, the sixth to the left. The real attraction, though, is its baptistery
(entrance at the end of the nave to the right), which dates back to the
fourth century; it’s the world’s oldest Western baptistery and is still dec-
orated with beautiful fifth-century mosaics.
Attached to the Duomo is the entrance to the museum, which holds the
Treasure of San Gennaro, a stunning collection of precious artwork
donated to the saint throughout the centuries. The collection is so rich
that the museum has to show it on a rotating basis, changing the display
every year. From the museum, you can also visit the sacristy, with its beau-
tiful frescoes by Luca Giordano and paintings by Domenichino. Should you
find the doors to Santa Restituta and to the Cappella Minutolo closed, ask
here to arrange for a visit.

National Archaeological Museum
Historic district
If you want to visit just one archaeological museum in Italy, make it this
one. Established in the 17th century, it is one of the world’s oldest antiq-
uity museums and one of the richest. Part of the astonishing collection is
actually embedded in the walls and floors of the palazzo, as that was the
style in the 17th century: Roman sculptures embellish the facade and
superb ancient Roman mosaics decorate the floors, all originals from
Pompeii, Herculaneum, and other archaeological excavations in the region.
The collection of Roman sculptures on the first floor is superb, with 
many Roman copies of original Greek masterpieces such as the Ercole
Farnese — a statue of Hercules copied from an original in bronze by
Lisippo from the fourth century B.C., which greatly influenced the artists
of the Renaissance — and the Toro Romano, a dramatic scene come to
life in marble that stands over 4m (13 ft.) high; it depicts the punishment
of the queen of Boeotia from a Greek original of the second century B.C.
Chapter 18: Naples 393

The mezzanine is dedicated to ancient Roman mosaics, the most won-
derful of which is the huge one depicting the victory of Alexander the
Great over the Persians; it was moved here from the House of the Faun in
Pompeii where it was found (see Chapter 19). On the second floor you find
a stunning collection of ancient Roman paintings and frescoes — entire
rooms from Pompeii, Herculaneum, and other nearby sites have been
reconstructed here with the original frescoes (we love room 77, with a
series of landscapes and the portrait of Saffo, a young girl). Famous
already back in Goethe’s day is the so-called Gabinetto Segreto (Secret
Room): a collection of Roman erotica originals documenting the attitude
toward sexuality in Roman times (guilt-free and frank, to say the least).
You can sign up for a guided tour at the ticket booth. We recommend rent-
ing an audio guide (in English) for your visit; allow a couple of hours.

Palazzo Reale
Piazza Plebiscito
The imposing neoclassical Royal Palace was designed by Domenico
Fontana and built by the Bourbons in the 17th century; the eight statues
depicting Neapolitan kings on the facade were added in the 19th century.
The palazzo retains its glamour to this day, and was used as the venue 
for a G7 summit meeting in 1994. The royal apartments inside are quite
splendid — richly appointed with marble floors, tapestries, frescoes, and

Naples and the presepio
The dearest activity to Neapolitans is the making of manger scenes; an art form that
reached its peak in the 18th and 19th centuries, it is a tradition that is still alive and
well today. Far from being a Christmas-only preoccupation, the carving of figurines, as
well as the preparation of details of the setting, is the permanent activity of a number
of reputed artists. The figurines are collectors’ items, and people save up to buy 
them — the ones dressed in original 18th-century fabrics are quite expensive — and
plan their displays months in advance. Unlike those mangers that are simply a little
display of established characters, Neapolitan versions are alive with the passions and
happenings of the historical and political present, and among the figures offered for
sale, you will recognize such characters as Lady Diana and Madre Teresa di Calcutta,
and even Gianni Versace! Via San Gregorio Armeno, in the historic district, is where
most of the historic workshops are located; you will find not only characters, but also
rocks, grottoes, miniature pumps to make “rivers,” miniature street lamps, and so on.
A vividly painted figure or figurine — some of them are life-size — can be a beautiful
souvenir of Naples and Italy, but remember that these carvings don’t come cheap: A
shepherd dressed in 18th-century clothes will be priced in the hundreds of dollars.
See “Shopping the Local Stores,” later in this chapter, for more information.

baroque furniture — and the chapel holds the famous Presepio del Banco
di Napoli (manger scene), with characters carved by famous Neapolitan
sculptors in the 18th century. The palazzo’s most grandiose rooms house
the Vittorio Emanuele III Library, accessible from a separate entrance on
the ground floor. Originally established by Charles de Bourbon and later
enlarged, it is the greatest in southern Italy, holding over two million vol-
umes, stretching as far back as papyrus manuscripts from Herculaneum.
Those are not on display, but you should definitely admire the gorgeous
decorated public halls. To bring the place to life, we recommend taking

Santa Chiara
Historic District
Built at the beginning of the 14th century as the burial church for the
Angevin dynasty, this majestic church is the heart of the large monastic
complex of the Clares. The church was severely damaged by World War II
bombing and an ensuing fire, and although much of the artwork that dec-
orated the interior was lost, its architectural structure was restored to its
original look. Among the several monuments inside, the tomb of Roberto
d’Angiò at the end of the nave — a beautiful example of Tuscan-style
Renaissance sculpture — is the most magnificent. The Choir of the Clares,
accessible from the sacristy, is where the nuns can sit protected from the
public during mass; it was a splendid work of art decorated by Giotto —
you can still admire some fragments and the gorgeous carved portal —
but much was lost in the fire. Outside of the church to the back, you can
visit the key attraction of the whole complex: the Cloister of the Clares, a
uniquely beautiful cloister completely decorated with hand-painted
majolica tiles. From the cloister, you can also access the museum, which
holds artwork donated to the church as well as the archaeological exca-
vations of ancient Roman thermal baths from the first century A.D.

Sant’Anna dei Lombardi (Santa Maria di Monteoliveto)
Historic District
This Renaissance gem is our favorite church in Naples. Opening onto a
charming piazza graced by the city’s most beautiful baroque fountain,
this church was the favorite of the Aragonese dynasty, which is why many
of them are buried here. The elegant Piccolomini Chapel to the left houses
the tomb of Maria d’Aragona, by Antonio Rossellino and Benedetto da
Maiano. The Cappella Tolosa, also to the left, decorated in the styles of
Chapter 18: Naples 395

Brunelleschi and della Robbia by Giuliano da Maiano, is a showcase of
Neapolitan sculpture from the 15th and 16th centuries. The Cappella
Correale, to the right, holds a beautiful San Cristoforo by Francesco
Solimena over a superb marble altar by Benedetto da Maiano. In the sac-
risty are frescoes by Giorgio Vasari and helpers, as well as the spectacu-
lar wood inlay work by Giovanni da Verona (created 1506–10) depicting
classical panoramas, musical instruments, and other scenes with thou-
sands of tiny slivers of wood of various kinds and colors.

Finding more cool things to see and do
Naples has enough attractions to satisfy its visitors for weeks on end.
Here are some more sights to explore:
 We enjoy coming for a cup of tea and some window shopping at the
Galleria Umberto I (off Via Toledo; Bus: R2 or R3 to Piazza Trieste
e Trento). This glass-and-iron covered promenade — a splendid
example of the Italian Art Nouveau style — was built at the end of
the 19th century (20 years after its larger Milanese counterpart)
with a soaring glass ceiling, lined with elegant shops (see “Shopping
the Local Stores,” later in this chapter).
 Built by the Bourbons at the beginning of the 18th century, the
Teatro San Carlo (Via San Carlo 93; % 081-400300; Bus: R2 or R3
to Via San Carlo; Admission and guided tour: 5€/$8; Open for guided
tour: Thurs–Mon 9 a.m.–5:30 p.m. and Tues–Wed same hours by

tiful opera houses, a neoclassical jewel with an ornate gilded inte-
rior. It is said to have even better acoustics than Milan’s famous 
La Scala. You can appreciate its architecture and decorations by
taking the guided tour, or see the building in its full glory for a per-
formance (see “Living It Up After Dark,” later in this chapter).
 Another of our favorite attractions is Villa La Floridiana, the coun-
try house of the Duchess of Floridia, second wife of King Ferdinand
II Bourbon. The splendid park surrounding the villa affords great
views of the city and the bay (Via Domenico Cimarosa 77; % 081-

earlier), a family chapel transformed by the dark and mysterious
Prince Raimondo di Sangro of Sansevero, an alchemist from the
18th century, into a spooky architectural marvel. Inside you find
some of the most strangely beautiful sculptures of the time, includ-
ing the famous Veiled Christ, by the Neapolitan master Giuseppe
Sanmartino, and, in the crypt, two mummified bodies — the work
of the prince — showing their perfectly preserved circulatory 
systems.
 San Domenico Maggiore (Piazza San Domenico Maggiore, off Via
Benedetto Croce; % 081-449097; Metro: Piazza Cavour; Admission:
Free; Open: Daily 9 a.m. to noon and 5–7 p.m.) — a splendid church
built by the Angevins in the 13th century — contains innumerable
works of art. According to their customs, the main facade is not 
on the piazza but inside a courtyard. From the transept, you can
access the medieval church of San Michele Arcangelo a Morfisa,
which was incorporated into San Domenico.
 We highly recommend a visit to the Catacombs of St. Gennaro (Via
Capodimonte 13, down a small alley running alongside the church
Madre del Buon Consiglio; % 081-7411071; Bus: 24 or R4 to Via
Capodimonte; Admission: 3€/$4.80) even if you have already vis-
ited the ones in Rome. In use between the second and ninth cen-
turies, they are particularly famous for the well-maintained frescoes
decorating the large corridors and chapels. One of the most beauti-
ful is the Cripta dei Vescovi on the upper level, decorated with
fifth-century mosaics. Buried in these catacombs is San Gennaro,
the patron saint of Naples — hence the name — whose remains
were moved here in the fifth century. You can visit only by guided
tour, Tuesday through Sunday at 9 a.m., 10 a.m., 11 a.m., and noon.
 We love the archaeological excavations accessible from the cloister
of San Lorenzo Maggiore (Piazza San Gaetano; % 081-290580;

Church free, excavations 2€/$3.20; Open: Church Mon–Sat 8 a.m. 
to noon and 5–7 p.m.; excavations Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–6 p.m.): You 
can see different layers, from the medieval buildings, to a paleo-
Christian basilica, then the ancient Roman market, and the Greek
merchant stalls at the bottom. Built in the sixth century, the church
enjoyed both a Renaissance and a baroque overhaul, which avoided
the beautiful 13th- and 14th-century frescoes, as well as the many
carvings decorating the interior. This is where the poet Boccaccio
(author of the Decameron) met his beloved Fiammetta, back in 1334.
The attached convent was also home to the great poet Francesco
Petrarca (Petrarch) for a time.

Seeing Naples by guided tour
The hop-on/hop-off buses operated by CitySightseeing (% 081-5517279;
www.napoli.city-sightseeing.it) offer a great way to see the city 
as well as a good alternative to public transportation. Three one-hour
itineraries start from Piazza Municipio/Parco Castello: Line A travels
inland to Museo di Capodimonte (daily Apr 9:45 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; May–
Sept 9:45 a.m.–5:15 p.m.); Line B goes along the seaside to Posillipo
(Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.); and Line C heads to the Carthusian
Monastery of San Martino on the Vomero (May–Sept daily 10 a.m.–
4:45 p.m.). Check the schedule, as it changes often. You can get tickets
on board for 22€ ($35) for adults, 11€ ($18) for children 6 to 15, and 
66€ ($106) for family (up to two adults and three children). Tickets are
valid for all lines for 24 hours. You get a 10 percent discount if you have
the Artecard (see p. 390).
You can sign up for tours of the historic district at Museo Aperto Napoli
(Via Pietro Colletta 85, by Castel Capuano, toward the eastern edge of
the historic district; % 081-5636062; Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.). You
can chose between free self-guided walking tours with a map and audio
guide, and a regular tour with a live guide; all tours are available in six
languages.
Suggested one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
Naples in one day
It’s impossible to see the best of Naples in one day, but you can hit some
of the highlights. Begin in Piazza Municipio, taking in the Castel Nuovo — 
the huge fortress in the center of the square — and stopping just long
enough to admire its magnificent portal. Head now for the CitySightseeing
hop-on/hop-off bus stop to the side of the piazza and buy a ticket: Its
three routes offer a great way to get an overview of the city and to 
move from attraction to attraction. Go directly up to the Museo di
Capodimonte, where you’ve made advance reservations, and spend
time exploring this splendid museum. After your visit, hop back on the
bus and get off at Porta Capuana to have lunch at the Pizzeria di
Matteo. After your taste of real Neapolitan pizza, take a stroll along Via
dei Tribunali in the heart of the historic district. Stop at the Caffetteria
Pasticceria Gelateria G. Mazzaro for a snack of Neapolitan coffee and
pastries (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter) while you wait for the
Duomo to open. After your visit to the Duomo, its baptistery, and its
Cappella di San Gennaro, head for the Museo Archeologico. You can’t
skip this part — some of the ancient Roman artifacts here are the best in
the world! Then climb back on your bus and, in Piazza Municipio, switch
to Line B for a sunset ride along the waterfront. Stop at Castel dell’Ovo
on the way back and have dinner by the sea, taking in the romantic
beauty of the bay. After your meal, stroll to Piazza Plebiscito, the most
beautiful square in Naples, for your adieu to this magic city.
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
398

Naples in two days
Two days is a lot better than one — you’ll be able to skip fewer attrac-
tions. Here’s how we’d spend our time:
Day 1
Start off by following our “Naples in one day” itinerary, earlier in this
chapter, up to and including the visit to the Duomo, but then dedicate
more time to the old streets of the historic district, also visiting Santa
Chiara and one or all of the minor churches — Cappella San Severo,
San Domenico Maggiore, and San Lorenzo Maggiore. Get back on your
bus at Piazza Giovanni Bovio and finish the day as in the itinerary earlier
in this chapter, with a scenic waterfront ride and dinner.
Day 2
Begin your day at Santa Maria di Monteoliveto (Sant’Anna dei
Lombardi), maybe stopping for caffè and sfogliatella at the Gran Caffè
Gambrinus on your way. Proceed then to the Museo Archeologico,
where you spend the rest of your morning. Dedicate your afternoon to
the Riviera di Chiaia, strolling the waterfront, and visiting the Giardini
Comunali. End your stay in memorable fashion, with aperitivo at Piazza
dei Martiri, and dinner at George’s in the Grand Hotel Parker’s, or at 
La Terrazza dei Barbanti inside the hotel San Francesco al Monte (see
“Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter).
Naples in three days
Follow our itinerary for “Naples in two days,” earlier in this chapter. On
your third day, devote your morning to a visit of Castel Nuovo, followed
by a funivia ride up to the Vomero to see the splendid attractions up
there. Visit Villa La Floridiana before having lunch at Gorizia (see
“Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter). Then proceed to the Carthusian
Monastery of San Martino; you can then follow up with Castel Sant’Elmo
to admire the sunset over the bay from its splendid vantage point, or
descend to Chiaia for some shopping. End your day with dinner on the
waterfront promenade of Via Partenope.
Shopping the Local Stores
Though not as glitzy and ubiquitous as in Milan or Rome, shopping in
Naples does offer some serious possibilities. You can find all the big and
small names of Italian fashion here, as well as some local designers.
Naples also excels in antiques, but you need to know what you’re doing
(the city is known for its experts in the tricky art of “antiquing,” or
making something new look old). Finally, Naples and the surrounding
areas maintain a tradition of producing crafts — one specialty being
cameos (delicately carved jewels using colored stone like agate or
coral), the other being figurines for presepi (manger scenes). Both of
these artistic traditions date back to the 18th century.
Chapter 18: Naples 399

Best shopping areas
In the elegant area behind the Chiaia waterfront, you find all the big
names of Italian fashion, such as Valentino, Versace, Ferragamo, and
Prada, plus a lot of other nice boutiques. The best streets for such high-
end shopping are Via dei Mille, Piazza dei Martiri, and Via Calabritto.
Also in this area are many antiques dealers. Via Domenico Morelli is
home of the city’s most established dealers, specializing in 18th-century
furniture and paintings. Another good area for shopping is Via Toledo,
the animated street leading away from Piazza del Plebiscito.
What to look for and where to find it
Shops in Naples are generally open Monday through Saturday from 
10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 4 or 4:30 to 7:30 or 8 p.m.
Accessories
Among the local designers, Marinella (Via Riviera di Chiaia 287; % 081-
7644214; Open: Mon–Sat 6:45 a.m.–8 p.m.) is the most famous. The 
specialty is cravats and ties, with a new collection offered almost every
week.
Antiques
The Fiera Antiquaria (% 081-621951), in the Villa Comunale di Napoli
on Viale Dohrn, is an important event held every third Saturday and
Sunday of each month from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. (except in Aug).
Two reputable antiques shops are Regency House (Via D. Morelli 36; 
% 081-7643640) and Navarra (Piazza dei Martiri; % 081-7643595). To
get to these shops, take bus no. R3 to Riviera di Chiaia.
Cameos
In the Galleria Umberto I, off Via Toledo (see “Finding more cool things
to see and do,” earlier in this chapter), you can buy as well as see a
demonstration of cameo and coral carving, at Ascione 1855 (% 081-
421111).
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
400
Counterfeit goods? No, thank you
A note of caution: You might be tempted by the street stalls selling perfect copies of
highly desirable items, from Gucci handbags to Chanel or Hermès belts, but think twice
before buying: United States Customs will charge you twice the official prize if they
catch you with an illegal copy. The United States is not alone: Most countries are
cracking down on fake merch as a way to protect brand design property.

Chocolate
The most interesting shop in Naples is Gay-Odin (Via Toledo 214 and 
up the street at no. 427; % 081-417843), a historic chocolate factory
making delicious, 100-percent pure chocolate (what you usually get is
30-percent chocolate at best), and such daring concoctions as chocolate
con pepperoncino (with hot pepper): Try it, it is great!
Presepi (Manger Figurines)
At Gambardella Pastori (Via San Gregorio Armeno 40; % 081-5517107),
you find a large array of manger figurines and accessories. Another good
resource is Giuseppe Ferrigno (Via San Gregorio Armeno 8; % 081-
5523148). These are traditional workshops selling quality items, but
nearby you also find cheaper plastic versions of the same thing.
Living It Up After Dark
Like other Italians, Neapolitans like to stroll in the evening, perhaps
having an ice cream or sitting out on the terrace of a popular cafe. On
the other hand, the lively local cultural life is also well worth sampling.
The performing arts
Seeing an opera at the Teatro San Carlo (Via San Carlo 98/f; % 081-
7972412 or 081-7972331; www.teatrosancarlo.it) is an unforgettable
experience. This is a world-class venue (see “Finding more cool things to
see and do,” earlier in this chapter) that attracts the best international
stars. The acoustics are excellent, and the program always includes
some grandiose production. The season runs from December to June,
with shows Tuesday through Sunday. Ticket prices range from 45€ to
110€ ($72–$176); Artecard (see p. 390) gives you a 20 percent discount.
We also recommend catching one of the excellent concerts either at
Teatro San Carlo above, or organized by the Centro di Musica Antica
Pietà dei Turchini (Via Santa Caterina da Siena 38; % 081-402395;
www.turchini.it) or the Associazione Alessandro Scarlatti (Piazza
dei Martiri 58; % 081-406011; www.associazionescarlatti.it),
where Artecard (see p. 390) gives you a 20 to 25 percent discount. We
love those staged at Castel Sant’Elmo, usually in the spring.
Traditional Neapolitan songs are famous around the world — think O
Sole Mio — and you can see some of the best performers at the Trianon
(Piazza Vincenzo Calenda 9; % 081-244-411; www.teatrotrianon.it);
the season usually starts in April, with shows Thursday through Sunday
and ticket prices varying from 5€ to 25€ ($8–$40); Artecard (see p. 390)
gives you 10 percent discount.
Naples’s well-established musical tradition has kept the scene alive liter-
ally for centuries. New and more established local groups play around
Chapter 18: Naples 401

town in a variety of venues: Inquire at the tourist office for a list of
events, or check out our favorite venues among the music bars below.
Clubs and discos
A real harbor town, Naples offers a lively nightlife scene with discos and
clubs galore; they’re mostly open Thursday through Saturday until 4 or 
5 a.m. One of the most popular is Chez Moi (Via del Parco Margherita 13;
% 081-407526), a small, chic hangout in Chiaia. Nearby is La Mela (Via
dei Mille; % 081-4010270), where the best night is Thursday.
For a gay atmosphere, go to Tongue (Via Manzoni 202; % 081-7690888),
in the seaside suburb of Posillipo, where you find a mixed crowd with a
large proportion of gays and lesbians. In the historic district, check out
Bar B (Via Giovanni Manna, near the Duomo; % 081-287681), which has
an attached sauna.
Wine bars, lounge bars, music bars, and cafes
We love joining the locals for aperitivo, and again for after-dinner pas-
tries and ice cream in the best cafes in town; our favorite is Gran Caffè
Gambrinus (Via Chiaia 1, Piazza Trento e Trieste; % 081-417582;
Bus: R2 or R3 to Piazza Trieste e Trento). A few steps from Piazza del
Plebiscito, this is the oldest cafe in Naples, with an ornate gilded interior
dating from the 1860s, beautifully restored to its full glory. If Gambrinus
is too full, try the nearby Caffè del Professore (Piazza Trieste e Trento
46; % 081-403041), less glitzy but making some of the best espresso in
town. We also love the fashionable La Caffetteria (Piazza dei Martiri 25;
% 081-7644243), in Chiaia.
Among the lounge bars du jour, the roof bar of the Starhotel Terminus
(Piazza Garibaldi 91; % 081-7793111) is popular with after-work crowds.
We also love S’move Light Bar (Vico dei Sospiri 10; % 081-7645813;
www.smove-lab.net), a trendy music bar with art exhibits, and the
nearby Joyce Irish Pub (Vico dei Sospiri 12; % 081-7647168; Closed
Mon), a pleasant place where you can also catch some live music on
occasion. Another of our favorites is Ottojazz (Salita Cariati, off Corso
Vittorio Emanuele; % 081-5513765).
The many popular vinerie (wine bars) all serve food and also have full
bars. Berevino (Via Sebastiano 62; % 081-290313) is a spacious vinerie
with a beamed ceiling, warm interior, and many wines to sample.
Another worth checking out is Enoteca Belledonne (Via Belledonne a
Chiaia 18; % 081-403162).

Chapter 19
Going Beyond Naples: 
Four Day Trips
In This Chapter
 Checking out steam holes and ruins in the Campi Flegrei
 Seeing the eerie sights of Herculaneum
 Discovering the marvels of Pompeii
You don’t have to be an antiquities and art buff to love Naples’s sur-
roundings: from the lesser known archaeological areas of Baia,
Cuma, and Pozzuoli in Campi Flegrei — a volcanic area northwest of
Naples — to the famous sites of Herculaneum and Pompeii. Mount
Vesuvius — the only continental volcano still active in Europe — is also
worth a visit, as are some of the minor archaeological sites on its slopes:
Oplontis and Boscoreale. The rural town of Caserta hides a gorgeous
Royal Palace, only comparable in beauty and extension to Versailles in
France. All are day trips from Naples and are well-connected by public
transportation.
Campi Flegrei
This volcanic area, lying to the west of Naples, was established as a 
protected natural park only in 1993 — a bit too late to prevent Naples’s
city sprawl. Beyond the traffic and ugly modern construction are some
unique archaeological sites.
Getting there
In the suburbs of Naples (only 18km/11 miles from the Duomo), Pozzuoli
is well connected to the city: You have the choice of metro line no. 2, the
Cumana railroad (a commuter line leaving from Piazza Montesanto in
Chiaia; % 800-001616 in Italy), or the scenic but slower bus no. 152,
which you can catch at its starting point in Piazza Garibaldi, or along its
route through Santa Lucia or Chiaia.

Taking a tour
We like the tours offered by Baia Sommersa (% 349-4974183; www.
baiasommersa.it), whose “Arkeotour” includes the attractions of
Cuma and Baia and a boat tour of submerged Baia for 35€ ($56).
Seeing the sights
The bay of Pozzuoli — a lively town at the park’s entrance — is extremely
picturesque. Defined by the promontory of Capo Miseno to the west and
the island of Nisida to the east, it enjoys views over the islands of Ischia
and Procida. Along the bay you find the towns of Bacoli and Baia. Taxis
(same rates as in Naples; see Chapter 18) are the best way to get around
between attractions; you can find one at the stand in Pozzuoli’s Piazza
della Repubblica (% 081-5265800).
If you’re planning to see several attractions in the Naples area, the
Artecard (see p. 390) is a good deal. Another option is the Integrato
Circuito Flegreo, a pass that includes the National Archaeological
Museum in Naples as well as all the archaeological sites in Campi Flegrei.
You can purchase the ticket at any of the sites for 8.50€ ($14), and it is
valid for three days.
Baia Archaeological Areas and Museum
Once a lively ancient Roman VIP resort, Baia’s ruins are scattered over a
large area. The Parco Monumentale is the huge free-access archaeological
area — 14 hectares (35 acres) — exposing partially uncovered villas and
imperial residences. In the Archaeological Park of the Thermal Baths
(Parco Archeologico Terme di Baia) you find the ruins of the fabled baths
of Baia, famous in antiquity for their beauty and therapeutic properties.
(Note: At press time the baths were closed for restoration.) You can walk
from one to the other (if you have tickets), taking the scenic footpath that
descends from the Esedra in the free park. Most of the findings are in the
Aragonese Castle on the promontory overlooking the town.
Monumental Park: Via Bellavista. Thermal Baths: Via Sella di Baia 22. % 081-8687592.
Museum: Via Castello 39. % 081-5233797. Admission: Monumental Park free;
Museum and Thermal Baths 4€ ($6.40) valid 2 days and includes Archaeological
area of Pozzuoli and Scavi di Cuma. Open: Tues–Sun Thermal baths 9 a.m. to 1 hour
before sunset; museum 9 a.m.–8 p.m. Ticket booth closes 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan
1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Baia Underwater Archaeological Park
Visiting the part of the ruins of Roman Baia that are submerged under the
sea is a very evocative experience, whether you do it by glass-bottom boat
or by scuba diving. For the dive you need to show your certification (the
dive is easy, as the ruins lie only a few feet underwater); if you chose the
glass-bottom boat excursion, you can also book a picnic lunch; departures
are by the harbor.

Harbor of Baia. % 349-4974183. www.baiasommersa.it. Admission: Boat excur-
sion 10€ ($16) adult, 9€ child aged 4–12, children under 3 free; scuba excursion 35€
($56). Open: Mid-Mar to mid-Nov Tues–Sun; boat departures 10 a.m., 12 p.m., and 3 p.m.
Cuma Archaeological Area
Back when the ancient Greeks started taking over the Mediterranean, this
is where they founded their first colony, in the eighth century B.C. The set-
tlement rapidly evolved to become the most important city on this coast,
until it was defeated by Etruscans and Romans (see Chapter 2). The acrop-
olis is quite impressive, together with the grandiose but mysterious tunnel
excavated through the mountain and known as Sybilla’s Cave. It was prob-
ably a strategic construction. The view from the terraces is spectacular.
Via Monte di Cuma 3. % 081-8543060. Admission: 4€ ($6.40); includes archaeological
area of Pozzuoli and archaeological area and museum of Baia. Open: Daily 9 a.m. to 1
hour before sunset. Ticket booth closes 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Pozzuoli Archaeological Area
A major harbor in Roman times, Pozzuoli’s ruins are imposing: from the
so-called Temple of Serapis, an elegant columned structure that was once
lined with shops and taverns, to the Flavian Amphitheater, where the
walls and the vaulted ceilings under the arena are still preserved (unlike
the Colosseum’s, where they have collapsed).
Temple of Serapis: Via Roma 10, by the harbor. Amphitheater: Via Terracciano 75, to
the north of town. % 081-5266007. Admission: 4€ ($6.40); includes Cuma and Baia
archaeological areas and museum. Open: Daily 9 a.m. to 1 hour before sunset. Last
admission 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Rione Terra
The most suggestive ruin in Pozzuoli is the excavation of what once the
town’s acropolis. You can walk the streets underground and see the shops

Oplontis and Boscoreale
Pompeii and Herculaneum were not the only towns destroyed by Mount Vesuvius’s
eruption in A.D. 79. The town of Oplontis was a wealthy suburb of Pompeii, and exca-
vations have revealed a splendid villa that probably belonged to emperor Nero’s
mother Poppea. It was lavishly decorated with mosaics that — according to modern
archaeological practices — have been left in situ. Villa di Poppea (Via Sepolcri 12,

Herculaneum
Few archaeological sites are as moving as this town buried beneath vol-
canic mud after Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79. The mud preserved
the houses to a remarkable extent, and the town has yielded great num-
bers of artifacts and sculptures, some of which are on display in the
National Archaeological Museum of Naples (see Chapter 18).
Getting there
It is easy to get to Herculaneum via public transport from Naples: Take
the Circumvesuviana Railway (Corso Garibaldi; % 800-053939; www.
vesuviana.it; Metro: Garibaldi) by boarding either of the two lines,
and get off at the Ercolano Scavi stop. Outside the station, you find a
shuttle bus to the site. The 20-minute ride costs 1.70€ ($2.70); trains
leave every half-hour.
Taking a tour
The agency Every Tours (Piazza del Municipio 5; % 081-551-8564;
Metro: Garibaldi) — which serves as the American Express office in
Naples — organizes day excursions to Herculaneum. Unless you are
keen on bus tours, we much prefer getting to the archaeological area by
ourselves and booking one of the official guided tours (see later in this
section).
Seeing the sights
Unless you’re visiting in the dead of winter, remember to bring a hat,
plenty of sunscreen, water, and snacks. Be sure to wear comfortable
shoes.
The Artecard (see p. 390) is an excellent deal for those who want to visit
several attractions in the region. You can also get a combination ticket
for 20€ ($32); it gives you access to all the archaeological sites in 
the Vesuvian area — Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplonti, Stabia, and
Boscoreale — and is valid for three days.

Smaller than Pompeii — about a third the size, according to experts — this

mated that at the time of the eruption, Herculaneum was a town of about

5,000. Because it was covered in hard volcanic mud — and the new town
was built over it — only a small part has been excavated, but what has
been unearthed is highly interesting: rich and elaborate buildings, along
with woodwork that’s only partially burned. Among the most interesting
public sites are the elegantly decorated thermal baths and the Palestra,
a sports arena where games were staged to satisfy the spectacle-hungry
denizens. The Collegio degli Augustali, lavishly adorned with marble
floors and frescoes, had a custodian: He was found sleeping in his bed,
which you can still see in his small room. The best example of private
architecture is the House of the Stags, named for the sculpture found
inside; it was an elegant town house overlooking the sea, built around 
atriums and terraces, and decorated extravagantly. The House of the
Latticework was at the other end of the scale: It was where poor workers
had their rooms, in a forerunner of project housing. The House of the
Mosaic of Neptune, in contrast, belonged to a merchant — and you can
see his shop lined with cabinets and merchandise still on his counter.

this villa was built around A.D. 60; you can visit both the lower and upper
floors, all decorated with rich mosaics and frescoes. Visits, which you

Chapter 19: Going Beyond Naples: Four Day Trips 411
Mount Vesuvius
Loved and feared by Neapolitans, Mount Vesuvius (Vesuvio) is the dormant volcano
that dominates Naples and its bay. Of the two major kinds of volcanoes — those slowly
oozing magma, like the ones on Hawaii, and those building up pressure inside and then
blowing their tops — Vesuvius is a top-blower. Although Vesuvius has belched only a
few puffs of smoke since the last real eruption in 1944, no one really knows whether
the volcano is losing its punch or just biding its time. It had been dormant for centuries
when it exploded in the great eruption of A.D. 79 which buried Pompeii and Hercu-
laneum. It got everybody on their toes when it puffed again in 1999, just in case anyone
thought it was extinct. Luckily, the Vesuvian Observatory, one of the world’s best (and
the first) observatories for the study of volcanology, is right here, taking the volcano’s
pulse daily. Its slopes are now a national park (Parco Nazionale del Vesuvio;
% 081-7710911; or 081-7775720 for official guides; www.parconazionaledel
vesuvio.it) which you can visit.
From Naples, take the Circumvesuviana Railroad (Corso Garibaldi; % 800-053939;
www.vesuviana.it; Metro: Garibaldi) and board a train on any of the lines —
bound for Sorrento, Sarno, Torre Annunziata — and get off at the Ercolano stop, about
15 minutes away. You find taxis and electric shuttle buses outside the station for the
short ride to the park entrance, at 1,017m (3,106 ft.) altitude, where the trail to the crater
starts (Admission: 6.50€/$10 including official guide; Open: Daily Nov–Mar 9 a.m.–
3 p.m.; Apr–May 9 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; June–Aug 9 a.m.–6:30 p.m.; and Sept–Oct 9 a.m.–
5 p.m.). Allow about 2 hours for the 1.8km (1-mile) hike.

Pompeii
Buried beneath volcanic ash and pumice stone in the A.D. 79 eruption of
Mount Vesuvius, the ruins of Pompeii are an impressive site, at four times
the size of Herculaneum. The burning ashes suffocated people without
burning them, transforming Pompeians taking flight into human statues
that are preserved now in the museum — an eerie and moving sight.
Getting there
From Naples, take the Sorrento line of the Circumvesuviana Train
(Corso Garibaldi; % 800-053939; www.vesuviana.it; Metro: Garibaldi)
to the Pompei Scavi stop (the Pompeii stop on the other line is the
modern town); the station is near the entrance to the archaeological
area. The 45-minute ride costs 2.50€ ($4); trains leave every half-hour.
Taking a tour
If you like classic bus tours, both Every Tours (Piazza del Municipio 5;
% 081-5518564; Metro: Garibaldi) — the American Express branch in
Naples — and NapoliVision (% 081-5595130; www.napolivision.it)
organize day trips to Pompeii.
We prefer booking a guided tour with Arethusa (% 081-8616405; www.
arethusa.net) — the official tour provider of the archaeological area.
Given the sheer size of the excavations, the suggested tours are organ-
ized by theme, such as public life, private homes, or merchants.
Seeing the sights
The sheer size of the archaeological area is such that you need to carry
water — and probably a snack — particularly in summer. Make sure you
also wear comfortable shoes, a hat, and sunscreen.
The Artecard (see p. 390) is an excellent deal for those planning to visit
several attractions in the region. You can get a combination ticket for 20€
($32); it gives you access to all the archaeological sites in the Vesuvian
area — Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplonti, Stabia, and Boscoreale — and it’s
valid for three days.
Some of Pompeii’s archaeological attractions are open only at specific
times, and you must book at least 24 hours in advance (at the number in
the listing below or online at www.arethusa.net). If you’re planning to
sign up for more than one, keep in mind that you need about 30 minutes
to get from one to the other.
Archaeological area
With about 35,000 inhabitants at the time of the eruption, Pompeii was an
important commercial center and residential resort when it was buried
under burning volcanic ash and pumice stone. The solidified volcanic
material remained relatively soft here, allowing researchers to excavate

Chapter 19: Going Beyond Naples: Four Day Trips 413
about two-thirds of the original town (about 44 hectares/109 acres). They
discovered a complex urban fabric, with a mix of elegant villas, shops, and
more modest housing. They also found that the area had been looted, both
at the time of the eruption — when residents who had escaped came back
to salvage some of their treasures — and in later centuries, when treasure
hunters came to scavenge. Yet, much was left behind, and the ruins are
relatively well preserved.
Pompeii followed the classic Roman urban structure, with grids of almost
perpendicular streets, both residential and commercial, lined with taverns
and shops, and organized around three centers of public life: the Forum,
with the town’s administrative and legal buildings and the market; the thea-
ter district by the triangular forum; and the Palestra and Amphitheater
for gaming and sports.
The Forum is nearest to the entrance. Covering 5,388 sq. m (58,000 sq. ft.),
it is surrounded by three important buildings: the Basilica (the meeting
hall, the city’s largest single structure), the Macellum (covered goods
market), and the Temple of Jupiter. Severely damaged in an earthquake

16 years before the eruption of Vesuvius, the Forum was in the process of
being repaired when the final destruction came.
Farther along is the theater district, with the beautiful Teatro Grande —
a structure that could hold 5,000 — and the smaller Odeion, for only about
1,000. Nearby are the Stabian Baths, the finest thermal baths to have sur-
vived from antiquity. Still in good condition, they are richly decorated with
marble, frescoes, and mosaics.
At the other end of town are the Amphitheater — from 80 B.C., making it
the oldest in the world — and the magnificent Palestra, the sports com-
pound, with exercise areas and a swimming pool that must have been won-
derful (it was huge and surrounded by plane trees — you can see the casts
of the stumps).
Among the private homes, the most elegant is the House of the Vettii,
belonging to two rich merchants, where you can admire a frescoed dining
room in the shade that has become famous as Pompeian red. The largest
is the House of the Faun, named for the bronze statue of a dancing faun
that was found there; the house takes up a city block and has four dining
rooms and two spacious inner gardens.
We suggest signing up for a visit of Casa del Menandro (visits every 30
minutes Sat–Sun 2–4 p.m.), Casa degli Amorini Dorati, Casa dell’Ara
Massima (each daily every 30 minutes 9 a.m.–6 p.m.), as well as the
Suburban Baths, a set of private thermal baths attached to a sumptuous
villa in a splendid, panoramic spot by the western town wall overlooking
the sea (daily every 30 minutes 10 a.m.–1:30 p.m.). Note: At press time the
baths were closed for restoration.
About half a mile down Via dei Sepolcri, out of Porta Ercolano to the north-
west of Pompeii’s archaeological area, are two examples of suburban sea-
side villas (though the sea has since receded): Villa di Diomede and Villa
dei Misteri, famous for their frescoes of ritual scenes related to the cult of
Bacchus (Dionysus).
Allow about four hours for a full visit. We recommend taking an official
guided tour (they are organized by theme); you can sign up at the ticket
booth when you arrive, but it’s a good precaution to reserve ahead of time,
especially if you’re going to be here on a weekend in high season.

Caserta
When King Carlo III Bourbon, in 1750, decided to move the capital of his
kingdom from Naples to a more protected inland location, he chose the
sleepy agricultural town of Caserta. Today, a grandiose Royal Palace and
a flourishing silk industry are the remains of his legacy. You need the
better part of the day to fully explore the area.
Getting there
Caserta is only 17km (11 miles) northwest of Naples, with trains run by
Trenitalia (% 892021 from anywhere in Italy; www.trenitalia.it)
leaving Naples’s main station every 10 to 20 minutes. A 30-minute ride
brings you to Caserta’s railway station, virtually across from the Royal
Palace.
Taking a tour
You can book your tickets and a guided tour with Arethusa (% 0823-
448084; www.arethusa.net), the official tour provider for the Royal
Palace (Reggia). They also make reservations for the silk bus, which
leads tours through the Reggia’s park up to the royal silk manufacturer,
San Leucio.
Seeing the sights
The Artecard (see p. 390) is a good deal if you plan to see sites in
Naples and its surroundings.
Do wear comfortable shoes and carry a bottle of water: The site is huge,
and your only source of refreshment is the cafeteria/snack bar on the
ground floor of the palace, by the entrance to the gardens, and — in July
and August — a small kiosk by the entrance to the English Garden.
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
416

Belvedere di San Leucio
We also recommend a visit to San Lucio, up the hill at the end of the park
to the left: You can walk the 3.7km (21⁄3 miles), but it is much better to sign
up for the silk bus tour that departs from the Reggia. You can visit the
Casino Reale di Belvedere — the king’s magnificently decorated hunting
lodge — and the silk hamlet, created by King Ferdinando IV in 1789 as an
experiment in social and human economy. He established a silkworm farm
and a weaving factory (today a museum, the Museo della Seta) complete
with dignified lodgings for the workers and their families. Passage on the
silk bus tour includes a visit to the showroom of a modern private ven-
ture, Stabilimento Serico De Negri, where you can admire their hand-
woven creations (and buy them if you can afford it). The high-quality
machine-made line is much more affordable.
Piazza della Seta, off Strada Statale SS87. % 800-411515 toll-free within Italy or
0823-301817. Admission: 6€ ($9.60); 5€ ($8) with Artecard (see p. 390). Silk bus 7€

Royal Palace (Reggia)
Architect Luigi Vanvitelli’s grandiose undertaking — construction spanned
from 1753 to 1774, a year after the architect’s death — includes a huge
four-winged palace covering over 45,000 sq. m (484,376 sq. ft.) and a mag-
nificent park that is considered to be the most beautiful Italian garden in
the world. Booking your ticket in advance is a good idea; and, if you are not
prepared for a lot of walking, you should also consider signing up for the
round-trip bus shuttle to the English Gardens, which is otherwise a good
2.4km (11⁄2-mile) walk each way.
The magnificent royal apartments include the main staircase, which is
lined with sculptures and leads to a multicolored marble octagonal
vestibule and the Sala di Marte, as well as the queen’s parlor in the old
apartments, with its beautiful furnishings. Paintings by court painter
Jacob Philipp Hackert decorate a number of the rooms. Art lovers should
visit Terrae Motus, a poignant memento of the region’s devastating 1980
earthquake; contemporary artists Andy Warhol and Keith Haring are
among those who participated in the permanent exhibit.
The royal park covers about 120 hectares (296 acres) and is decorated
with carved fountains and pools. Its majestic falls mark the arrival of the
aqueduct designed by Vanvitelli to supply the palace with water (it comes
from Monte Taburno, 40km/25 miles away and today serves the whole
town). The English Garden was a caprice of Queen Maria Carolina di
Borbone; it is full of hidden Masonic symbols and romantic vistas, includ-
ing a small lake with a temple graced by real ancient Roman statues taken
from the ruins of Pompeii. Covering over 30 hectares (74 acres), the
English Garden can be visited by guided tour only. Horse-drawn carriage
tours are available in the park.

Sorrento, Capri, and 
the Amalfi Coast
In This Chapter
 Relaxing in picturesque Sorrento
 Taking in the sights in lovely Capri
 Living the good life on the Amalfi Coast
D
ividing the bay of Naples from the bay of Salerno, the Sorrento
peninsula has been a pleasurable destination since antiquity. Giving
its name to the peninsula, the town of Sorrento is the most picturesque
on this coast, only surpassed by the island of Capri (pronounced cap-ry),
a favored getaway. Yet the jewels of the Amalfi Coast — Amalfi, Ravello,
and Positano — are close competitors. The nearby town of Salerno hides
little-known architectural splendors only a short distance away from the
famous temples of Paestum.
Each of these destinations can be visited as a day trip from Naples, but
to do justice you should spend at least one night in a few of them.
Sorrento
The favored destination of writers and artists — following in the foot-
steps of such illustrious predecessors as Emperor Augustus and
Tiberius — Sorrento’s charm is not dulled by the crowds of visitors that
populate its cobbled streets at the height of summer. You can enjoy a
taste of it all in three to four hours.
Getting there
An easy 50-minute train ride on the Circumvesuviana Railroad (Corso
Garibaldi; % 800-053939; www.vesuviana.it; Metro: Garibaldi) links
Sorrento to Naples, with trains departing every half-hour (3€/$4.80).
You can also get here by ferry: Linee Marittime Partenopee (% 081-
55513236), NLG (% 081-5527209), and Linee Lauro (% 081-55522838;
www.alilauro.it) offer daily connections to and from Naples and

Capri; Caremar (% 081-5513882; www.caremar.it) makes daily runs 
to and from Capri; Metrò del Mare (% 199-600700; www.metrodel
mare.com; Apr–Oct) links Sorrento with Naples, Positano, and Amalfi;
Cooperativa Sant’Andrea (% 089-873190; www.coopsantandrea.it)
offers frequent service between Sorrento and Amalfi, Minori, Salerno,
and Positano. Ferries arrive at Marina Piccola harbor. You can then take
the frequent shuttle bus for the steep climb to Piazza Tasso, in the heart
of town. Or you can use a taxi (see “Fast Facts: Sorrento,” p. 425).
If you’re coming from the Capodichino airport in Naples, you can take
one of the seven daily buses operated by Curreri Viaggi (% 081-
8015420); the trip takes about an hour and costs 6€ ($9.60).
Spending the night
Sorrento offers many hotels, but prices are high in this popular resort. 
If you don’t mind being removed from the action, try the Relais Villa
Giovanna (Via Calata di Puolo 1, about 3km/2 miles west of Sorrento; 
% 081-5339908; Fax: 081-5339914; www.relaisreginagiovanna.it),
an upscale agriturismo (farm stay).
Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria
$$$$
Piazza Tasso
Right in the heart of town, this is the grandest of all the elegant hotels in
Sorrento and one of the best in the world. Still run by the same family who
welcomed Lord Byron and Wagner, it has successfully kept up with modern
international standards. From the public spaces, furnished with its origi-
nal 19th-century furniture, to the beautiful terraces, everything whispers
taste, luxury, and relaxation. Guest rooms are distributed among three
buildings, but all are palatial in size and decor. Guests can swim from the
private pier off Marina Piccola, which is connected to the hotel by eleva-
tor, or in the pool in the private park. We recommend the hotel’s restau-
rants: our favorites are the magnificently frescoed Vittoria, and the elegant
Terrazza Bosquet, overlooking the whole bay.

Vietri floor tiling and Sorrentine marquetry furniture. Bathrooms are state-
of-the-art, with tubs and Jacuzzi showers. A/C is available May through
September.

Exploring Sorrento
If you only have time for a day-trip and are visiting on a weekend, con-
sider the Sorrento Express tour (% 081-8780862; www.sorrento
express.it), which takes you to Sorrento from Naples on a romantic
vintage train (with the modern bonus of A/C). The trip on a 1942 train is
organized by the Circumvesuviana railroad (see “Getting There,” earlier
in this section). On Saturdays, the train leaves Naples at 9 a.m., with
refreshments on the way, a guided tour of Pompeii, then a guided tour of
Sorrento with lunch in a local restaurant featuring 18th-century dishes.
Reservations are required (cost 57€/$91).
If you have the time, hire a boat for a tour of the rugged coastline:
Nautica Sic Sic (Marina Piccola; % 081-8072283; www.nauticasic
sic.com; Closed Nov–Apr) and Tony’s Beach (Marina Grande; % 081-
8785606) are good agencies; plan to spend 25€ ($40) an hour.
The top attractions
One of our favorite pastimes in Sorrento is walking the cobblestones of
the medieval district, with its narrow streets, elegant palazzi, and pretty
flower-ringed squares. Much of the medieval town was destroyed during
the dramatic night of June 12, 1558, when Barbary pirates sacked
Sorrento. Quickly rebuilt to be more picturesque than ever, the town sur-
vived the centuries, overlooking its two harbors — Marina Grande and
Marina Piccola — from a dramatic cliff.
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast

The best gelato on the coast
Gelato is our not-so-guilty pleasure, and as hard to please as we may be, we’re always
happy to return to Davide Il Gelataio (Via Padre Reginaldo Giuliani 41; % 081-8781337),
which produces such enticing flavors as delizia al limone (lemon delight) — oh so deli-
cious indeed — and cioccolato ai canditi (dark chocolate and candied orange peel).
You may have a hard time choosing: Davide makes some 60 different flavors.

Duomo
This is Sorrento’s cathedral, dedicated to San Filippo and San Giacomo.
Behind the simple Romanesque facade, flanked by a bell tower and deco-
rated with four antique columns and a majolica clock, you find an elegant
interior, adorned with original bas reliefs from the 14th and 15th centuries.
The bishop’s chair on display is an example of splendid wood intarsia
work — a typical local craft (see later in this section).
Corso Italia 1. % 081-8782248. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 8 a.m. to noon and 4–8 p.m.
Museo Correale
This interesting museum was the home of a local aristocratic family who
donated it to the town, along with their collection of art. Besides the
beauty of the villa itself, overlooking the sea, you find all the original fur-
nishings as well as a collection that includes a few Flemish masters and a
number of precious objects and valuable porcelains.
Via Correale, off Piazza Tasso. % 081-8781846. www.museocorreale.com. Admis-
sion: 8€ ($13). Open: Wed–Mon 9 a.m.–2 p.m.
San Francesco
This average 18th-century church hides a treasure inside: its splendid
14th-century cloister, done in the typical local mix of styles that merges
Eastern influence with Western. On selected nights, the cloister becomes
the beautiful setting for classical music concerts (see “Living it up after
dark,” later in this section).
Piazza Francesco Saverio Gargiulo. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–1 p.m. and

Chapter 20: Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast 423
The Land of Sirens
Established by the Etruscans and taken over by the Greeks, beautiful Sorrento was a
thriving town. Such was the beauty of this peninsula — and so treacherous its seas —
that it was believed to be the headquarters of the sirens, the half-woman/half-animal
creatures who used their enchanted songs to lure mariners onto the rocks and to their
captivity. In spite of the myth, Sorrento became an elegant resort by the first century
B.C., and further thrived under Roman rule. The Goths occupied the town for a few
decades, but it was soon reconquered by the Byzantines in A.D. 552 and remained part
of their Duchy of Naples until the 11th century. Sorrento then became an independent
city-state until it was conquered by the Normans in 1133, and then passed to the
Angevins. These were the years of Saracen incursions, and Sorrento suffered diffi-
cult times until it was basically razed to the ground in 1558. The Sorrentines didn’t lose
their spirit, however, and immediately began reconstruction, surrounding the town
with a new set of walls and a number of watchtowers. Sorrento recovered its quiet and
resumed its tradition of enchanting travelers and not letting them go — or at least
keeping their hearts.

More cool things to see and do
 If you like marquetry furniture, you’ll be delighted by the display 
at the Bottega della Tarsia Lignea Museum (Via San Nicola 28; 
% 081-8771942; Admission: 8€/$13; Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–1 p.m.),
in the 18th-century Palazzo Pomaranci Santomaso. You can admire
the frescoes that decorate the ceilings as well as a collection of
some of the best examples of this local traditional craft spanning
the 19th century.
 Swimming is definitely an attraction here, but don’t expect soft
golden sand: The rugged coast that makes this area so beautiful
yields only a few tiny stretches of pebbly beaches. Hotels have nav-
igated the problem by rigging piers that extend into the sea and are
equipped with beach chairs and umbrellas. If you prefer the beach,
your only choices in town are the small pebbly one at Marina
Grande, or Marinella, east of town. Further to the east in Vico
Equense, is a somewhat larger beach. If you don’t mind a bit of a
hike, you can also head west to Punta del Capo, where you find the
ruins of a Roman villa as well as our favorite swimming spot: Take
Via del Capo west out of town, the trail starts at Piazza Capo di
Sorrento. Even easier: Hire a boat (see p. 422) to take you, and you
can admire the coast along the way.
 Provided you can convince yourself to abandon your lounge chair,
hiking is a major possibility here, with trails crisscrossing the
promontory behind town. They’re well marked, but local bookstores
and newsstands also carry an excellent map, the Carta dei Sentieri
published by CAI (Club Alpino Italiano). To hire an expert guide,
contact Giovanni Visetti (% 081-8089613; www.giovis.com).
 Foodies should consider taking a class at the Sorrento Cooking
School (Viale dei Pini 52; % 081-8783555; www.sorrentocooking
school.com); a three-hour class, for example, is 120€ ($192),
including a meal with a few glasses of wine.
Living it up after dark
In high season, Sorrento has a lively cultural life that’s mostly centered
on music, with concerts — mostly classical music but not exclusively —
scheduled at major hotels and churches around town. The tourist office
(Via Luigi de Maio 35, off Piazza Tasso; % 081-8074033; Open: Mon–Sat
9 a.m.–6 p.m., plus July–Aug Sun 9 a.m.–12:30 p.m.) is the best source for
information on all events.
Some of the most sought-after tickets are those for the classical concerts
held in the cloister of San Francesco (see “The top attractions,” earlier
in this chapter) and in the baroque chapel inside Albergo Cocumella
(Via Cocumella 7; % 081-8782933; www.cocumella.com), a luxury hotel
in Sant’Agnello, to the east of town.
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
424

If you prefer local folk music, you should not miss the Sorrento Musical,
a festival of Neapolitan songs held March through October at Teatro
Tasso (Piazza Sant’Antonino; % 081-8075525; www.teatrotasso.com;
ticket prices around 26€/$42).
For more modern entertainment, head to Piazza Tasso for one of the 
two nightclubs, Fauno (% 081-8781021; www.faunonotte.it; cover
23€/$37) — with a DJ and shows of Tarantella (a traditional and colorful
folk dance) — or Matilda (% 081-8773236; cover 10€/$16), where a DJ
spins for a somewhat younger clientele. A bar that has live shows every
night is Circolodei Forestieri (Via Luigi de Maio 35; % 081-8773012;
Open: Mar–Oct). The most popular pubs in town are Chaplin’s Video
Pub (Corso Italia 18; % 081-8072551) and the English Inn (Corso Italia
55; % 081-8074357), which are the most lively, but we also like the
Merry Monk (Via Capo 6; % 081-8772409), though it’s a bit farther away.

Capri and the Blue Grotto
Like Emperor Tiberius many centuries ago, modern VIPs retreat to the
island of Capri to concentrate on their own decadent pleasures. Idyllic in
the off season, and full of charm at any time, Capri is the destination of
choice for thousands of tourists per year. Just a short ferry ride away
from Naples, Sorrento, Positano, or Amalfi, it’s an easy day trip —
although you’ll miss some of its magic if you don’t stay overnight.

Getting there
Whether you stay for a day or a year, remember to bring very little lug-
gage or expect to hire a porter when you land: The island is quite steep
and the walk from the ferry landing to the taxi stand is always longer
than you expected.
Ferries and hydrofoils buzz in and out of Capri’s harbor on a daily basis:
Caremar (% 081-5513882; www.caremar.it), Metrò del Mare (% 199-
446644; www.metrodelmare.com; service Apr–Oct), and NLG (% 081-
5527209; www.navlib.it) offer several daily connections from 
Naples and Sorrento. Amalficoastlines (% 089-871483; www.amalfi
coastlines.com) has service from Salerno, Amalfi, and Positano. 
SNAV (% 081-7612348; www.snav.it) makes hydrofoil runs from
Naples, and Alicost (% 081-7611004; www.alilauro.it) from Sorrento
and Positano. The trip by ferry takes about 90 minutes, whereas the alis-
cafo (hydrofoil) ride is only about 35 minutes.
From the ferry terminal in Marina Grande, you can take a taxi (see “Fast
Facts: Capri,” at the end of this section) or the picturesque funicular
(% 081-8370420; tickets for sale by the ferry landing) up the steep
coast to the town of Capri. Regular bus service also links Marina Grande,
Capri, Marina Piccola, Anacapri (same telephone as funicular, above);
Staiano (% 081-8371544 or 081-8372422; www.staianogroup.it) also
offers buses between Anacapri, Faro (Lighthouse), and Grotta Azzurra. A
regular ticket costs 1.40€ ($2.20) for either the bus or the funicular; you
can also get a 60-minute ticket for 2.30€ ($3.70), valid for one funicular
ride and unlimited bus runs during the time limit, or a day pass for 6.90€
($11), valid for two funicular trips and unlimited bus service. Renting a
scooter is a fun way to get around: We like the eco-friendly Rent an
Electric Scooter (Via Roma 68; % 081-8375863).
You find the local tourist office at Piazzetta I. Cerio 11 (% 081-8375308;
www.capritourism.com).
Spending the night
Hotels abound in Capri’s two towns — larger and livelier Capri and qui-
eter Anacapri — but even the most modest pensione charges over 100€
($160). In the past couple of years the island has seen an explosion in
the number of B&Bs, which are usually cheaper than the other options.
Our favorite B&B is Villa Mimosa, in Anacapri (Via Nuova del Faro 48a;
% 081-8371752; www.mimosacapri.com), which — along with the steep
outskirts of Capri town — is less expensive but further from the heart of
things. In addition to the hotels below, the Capri Palace (Via Capodimonte
2b, Anacapri; % 081-9780111; Fax: 081-8373191; www.capripalace.com;

Exploring Capri
Boat tours of the island leave from Marina Grande (where the ferries and
hydrofoils from Naples arrive). A complete tour of the island will cost you
14€ ($22) per person with Gruppo Motoscafisti (www.motoscafisti
capri.com) or Laser Capri (www.lasercapri.com), and an excursion
from Marina Grande to the Faraglioni runs 13€ ($21). Both companies
also offer excursions to the famous Blue Grotto (see below).
The top attractions
Anacapri
This is the smaller of the two towns on the island and the one that’s higher
up. It’s easily reached by bus, although the ride along the cliff road is hair-
raising. The natural beauty of the place can be best enjoyed from the ter-
races of Villa San Michele (Via San Michele; % 081-8371401; www.san
michele.org; Admission: 5€/$8; Open: Mar daily 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; Apr daily
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
428

9 a.m.–5 p.m.; May–Sept daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.; Oct daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; Nov–Feb
daily 9 a.m.–3:30 p.m.), the splendid 19th-century villa of Swedish doctor
and writer Axel Munthe.
Capri
This is the most picturesque — and largest — town on the island, a hive
of activity, glamorous hotels, cafes, and shops. The heart of it all is the
famous piazzetta (Piazza Umberto I) and the little streets around it;
another popular spot is the terraces of the public gardens — the Giardini
di Augusto — which afford superb views.
Grotta Azzurra (Blue Grotto)
Kids will love visiting this underwater cave, which will conjure up visions
of pirates and buried treasure. Capri’s top attraction, it is unfortunately so
overrun with tourists that it is difficult to truly enjoy, and some adults may
find it a bit claustrophobic. As sea levels have risen, the top of the grotto’s
mouth is now only about 3 feet above the water, just enough for a rowboat
to pass through, provided the passengers duck.
Huge crowds board large motorboats in Marina Grande, and then wait to
clamber down onto the small rowboats that shuttle visitors a few at a time
into the grotto. We prefer, instead, to take the bus from Anacapri and
descend to the beach where rowboats await. Either way, you need to pay
admission to the grotto and for the rowboat. Note: It is customary to tip
the rowboat operator.
Once inside, you finally understand what all the commotion is about, and
you even forget about the money and the challenges. The grotto was
known to the ancients — a little landing just inside the entrance dates back
to Roman times — but was temporarily lost to the world until an artist
stumbled upon it in 1826. Light refraction (the sun’s rays entering from an
opening under the water) creates incredible colors and a surreal atmos-
phere; alas, you won’t be able to linger, as a long queue of fellow tourists
is outside waiting.
Near the northwestern tip of the island. Admission: Grotto only 4€ ($6.40); rowboat
ride 6€ ($9.60); motorboat from Marina Grande 11€ ($18). Open: Daily 9 a.m. to 1 hour
before sunset.
Marina Piccola and the Faraglioni
A tiny and picturesque harbor on the south shore of the island, this is
where you can admire the Faraglioni, the tall cliffs off the island’s south-
eastern tip, Capri’s famous landmark. The local beach offers perfect views,
but you can also hire a boat to take you closer to this natural attraction.
Monte Solaro
Offering a great excursion and unique views, this is the highest peak on
the island: On a clear day you can see Mount Vesuvius and the entire coast,
from Ischia to Salerno. A chairlift is available to take you to the top; if you
wish, you can then walk back down using the well-marked trail. The path
Chapter 20: Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast 429

and the lift both start in Anacapri; allow an hour for the hike, and 12 min-
utes for the chair ride.
Chairlift at Via Caposcuro 10, Anacapri. % 081-8371428. Tickets: 6€ ($9.60) one-way, 8€
($13) round-trip. Ride operates Mar–Oct 9:30 a.m. to sunset; Nov–Feb 10:30 a.m.–3 p.m.
Villa Jovis
During his self-imposed exile here, Emperor Tiberius built several villas,
scattered around the island, where he could enjoy all sorts of illicit pleas-
ures far away from the prying eyes of the Roman Senate. Villa Jovis was
his main residence, a modest abode of about 5,850 sq. m (63,000 sq. ft.),
and is the best preserved of the villas. The Imperial Loggia, a covered
promenade along the edge of the cliff, is a masterpiece of architecture and
another must-see, if only for the views.
Viale Amedeo Maiuri, at the northeastern tip of the island. % 081-8374549. Admis-
sion: 2€ ($3.20). Open: Daily 9 a.m. to sunset; last admission 1 hour earlier.
More cool things to see and do
 Capri offers phenomenal hiking opportunities. From Due Golfi, not
far from the Piazzetta in Capri, the trek up to the Passetiello, the
pass to reach the small valley of Cetrella, near Anacapri, offers
spectacular views. Less demanding is the Scala Fenicia, a set of
over 500 steps originally built by Greeks to connect Palazzo a Mare
to Anacapri. Wear good shoes and bring enough water.
 If you like swimming, you won’t be disappointed: The water is
beautiful and — although Capri’s beaches are small — the sea is
splendid. You can rent umbrellas and beach chairs at Marina
Piccola, but when it’s overcrowded, you might prefer to hike from
Marina Grande (or hire a boat) to Bagni di Tiberio, on the north
side of the island, near the ruins of an ancient Roman villa.
Shopping for local treasures
Some people come to Capri only to shop — and there are indeed some
nice clothing, accessories, and jewelry shops carrying merchandise that
you wouldn’t find on the mainland. The perfume maker Carthusia has
two locations, one in Capri (Via Camerelle 10; % 081-8370368) and one
in Anacapri (Via Capodimonte 26; % 081-8373668); it has made unique
perfumes with local herbs and flowers since 1948. Another good store is
Canfora (Via Camerelle 3; % 081-8370487), which carries handmade,
high-quality, good-looking sandals. For prestigious jewelry, don’t miss La
Perla Gioielli (Piazza Umberto I 21; % 081-8370641), selling wonderful
creations since 1936.
Living it up after dark
From May through September, Capri’s nights come alive with visitors
and locals who stroll in and out of the many cafes and clubs, taking
advantage of the sweet air and joyful atmosphere. The place to see and

the cafes there for aperitivo and beyond (they are open until the wee
hours of the morning). Two traditional “taverns” are Anema e Core (Via
Sella Orta 39a; % 081-8376461), and Guarracino (Via Castello 7; % 081-

Anacapri, check out Lanterna Verde (Via G. Orlandi 1; % 081-8371427).
For a more elegant evening, we recommend the piano bars of both the
Capri Palace and the Grand Hotel Quisisana (see earlier in this chapter).

harbor town with a charming medieval center and mementos from its
glorious past; elegant Ravello overlooks the sea from its own valley; and

The Amalfi Coast
Chapter 20: Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast 433

Positano — with its small harbor opening between towering cliffs — is
the most picturesque of all. If you are short on time you can see the high-
lights in a day, but a longer stay will surely be relaxing and rewarding.
Getting there
No trains serve the Amalfi Coast. Only the narrow and winding local road
cuts along the side of tall cliffs, and it is sometimes harrowing. Ferries and
hydrofoils are the best way to get here, particularly in fair weather: Metrò
del Mare (% 199-446644; www.metrodelmare.com; Apr–Oct) offers regu-
lar service to Amalfi and Positano from Naples, Sorrento, Capri, and
Salerno; Alicost (% 081-7611004; www.alilauro.it) runs from Capri,
Salerno, and Sorrento; Cooperativa Sant’Andrea (% 089-873190; www.
coopsantandrea.it) makes trips from Sorrento and Salerno. Note: You
must make reservations at least 24 hours in advance.
Traffic and speeding locals make driving in this mountainous terrain 
a very unpleasant experience. Hiring a car with a driver allows you 
to enjoy the scenic drive in comfort and at your own pace. ANA
Limousine Service (Piazza Garibaldi 73; % 081-282000) and Italy
Limousine (% 081-8016184 or 335-6732245; www.italylimousine.it)
in Naples, or 2golfi car service (Via Deserto 30/e, Sant’Agata sui due
Golfi; % 339-8307748 or 338-5628649; www.duegolficarservice.com)
and Sorrento Car Service (Corso Italia 210, Sorrento; % 081-8781386;
www.sorrento.it) in Sorrento, are all reliable companies that use new,
air-conditioned cars and minivans, with trained English-speaking drivers
who double as guides. Prices vary depending on your needs, the car you
choose, and the number of people in your group, but the hourly rate is
about 35€ ($56) for two people. You can arrange for pickup at your
hotel, the airport, the rail station, or the harbor.
A cheaper option is the SITA bus (% 081-5522176; www.sitabus.it),
which offers frequent daily service to the Amalfi Coast from Naples,
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
434
The Amalfi Drive
Back in the 19th century when the SS163 was built and the area was discovered by
tourists, visitors traveled by horse-drawn carriages, and were few and far between.
When the Amalfi Coast became a fave destination for the jet set of the Dolce Vita and
their artsy friends in the 1950s and early 1960s, tourists were still rare, and the few
lucky ones traveled in convertible cars with Sophia Loren by their side. If that’s your
image of the Amalfi Coast, you need to think again: SS163 is still the same road (not any
larger or more modern than back then) and the beauty of the coast is still quite
unspoiled, but the traffic and noise on that narrow road are crazy and at times unbear-
able. You could maybe have your scenic drive in the off season in the very early hours
of the morning, but to get that idyllic experience, try going for a hike instead.

Sorrento, and Salerno. Once there, you can use the local bus lines to
most destinations in the area; the SITA bus terminal is in Piazza Flavio
Gioia in Amalfi (% 089-871009). The trip from Naples is about 4€
($6.40) and takes about two hours.
Spending the night
The coast and its cliffs are dotted with places to stay, ranging from super
luxury hotels — such as the Hotel San Pietro (Via Laurito 2; % 089-
875455; Fax: 089-811449; www.ilsanpietro.it; Closed Nov–Mar) in
Positano, simply one of the best hotels in the world with a restaurant to
match, Palazzo Sasso (Via San Giovanni del Toro 28; % 089-818181; Fax:
089-858900; www.palazzosasso.com; Closed Nov to mid-Mar) in Ravello,
and Hotel Santa Caterina (Via Nazionale 9; % 089-871012; Fax: 089-
871351; www.hotelsantacaterina.it) in Amalfi, both with excellent
restaurants as well — to delightful B&Bs, such as Villa Rosa (Via C.
Colombo 127; % 089-811955; www.villarosapositano.it), the best in

Casa Albertina

Positano
The favorite hotel of Luigi Pirandello — the famous Sicilian writer and play-
wright — this small family-run house is a well-hidden gem in the heart of
Positano. Each guest room is different from the others, furnished taste-
fully, most with private balconies opening onto the sea. Tiled bathrooms
are not large but are scrupulously clean. Some of the rooms adjoin, making
them good options for families. Featuring a terrace with a view, the hotel’s
pleasant restaurant serves a traditional cuisine based on local seafood.

In the historic Pastificio Bergamasco — a former pasta factory — this mod-

Medieval district. The staff is professional and kind, and guest rooms are
spacious and bright, decorated in typical Amalfitan style, with hand-painted
tiles and whitewashed walls. Almost all have private balconies, and the best
rooms are those facing the sea. Bright, unpretentious, and overlooking the
beach, the on-site restaurant prepares excellent local cuisine.

Hotel Luna Convento

Amalfi
With a splendid position on the promontory of Amalfi, this unique prop-
erty has a romantic charm that is difficult to match: An ancient monastery
founded by St. Francis in 1222, it was transformed into a hotel in 1822 and
is still run by the same family. You can visit the original cloister and chapel,
as well as the watchtower from 1564. The large saltwater swimming pool
is set into the cliff overlooking a secluded rocky beach reserved for only
hotel guests. Guest rooms vary widely, from the smallish cheaper rooms
to the palatial more expensive ones, with great private terraces overlook-
ing the sea. All have views of the sea and nicely tiled bathrooms. The
restaurants, one more upscale and the other less formal, are excellent.

The claims to fame of this hotel near the famous hotel Sirenuse are its
architecture with original domed ceilings and ceramic floors, and its excel-

Lemons and limoncello
Unique in size, sweetness, flavor, and color, the lemons of the Amalfi Coast have been
awarded IGP certification (the equivalent of DOC for wines) and are exported to mar-

made into delicious confections such as candied lemons and jams, as well as the
famous limoncello, a sweet lemon liqueur typical of the region. If you bring limoncello
home, remember to serve it very cold. It is popularly served straight as an after-dinner
digestive, or mixed with tonic water or seltzer.

Exploring the Amalfi Coast
Beaches, seaside resorts, small farming villages up the cliffs, fishing vil-
lages by the sea — the Amalfi Coast is varied and beautiful. Besides its
natural attractions, the region hosts innumerable art and music events
in the summertime. See “Living it up after dark,” later in this chapter.
The top attractions
Amalfi
The largest of the small towns on this stretch of coast, Amalfi is today a
pleasant fishing harbor and resort. The medieval part of town — including
the old harbor — is rich in monuments that are mementos of its past
importance. The imposing Duomo (Piazza del Duomo; % 089-871059;

Amalfi’s glory days
The first of Italy’s maritime republics — the city-states that dominated the Mediter-
ranean sea and its commerce starting in the tenth century — Amalfi once surpassed
Pisa, Genoa, and Venice in both power and riches. Created in ancient Roman times,
Amalfi declared its independence from the Byzantine empire in A.D. 839, as it had devel-
oped into an important commercial harbor thanks to its great strategic location. Its
moment of glory came between the 10th and the 12th centuries, when it dominated
the southern Mediterranean. When you walk the narrow streets of medieval Amalfi,
imagine this as the cosmopolitan heart of the republic, where peoples from all over
the known world intermingled and exchanged their goods. Amalfi’s notables and VIPs
mostly lived outside town, in the hills or nearby resorts; Ravello was the residence of
some of the wealthiest merchant families of Amalfi. Even after the fall of the city-state
by the hands of Pisa in 1135, it continued to be an important center for commerce with
the East throughout the 13th century.

Mar and Oct 9:30 a.m.–5:15 p.m., Apr–June 9 a.m.–7 p.m., July–Sept 9 a.m.–
9 p.m.) has a facade decorated with gold leaf and majolica, and flanked by
a charming 13th century bell tower. The 11th-century bronze doors clos-
ing the main portal are magnificent, and from the right nave you can
descend to the 13th-century crypt that holds the body of St. Andrew the
apostle, brought back from the Fourth Crusade; his face is preserved in
the church of St. Andrew’s in Patras, Greece, the town where he’s said to
have been crucified. To the left of the church is the entrance to of one of
the most beautiful cloisters you’ll ever see — the Chiostro del Paradiso
(% 089-871324; Admission: 3€/$4.80; Open: Daily June–Oct 9:30 a.m.–
7 p.m., Nov–May 9:30 a.m.–5:15 p.m.), with its small collection of antiqui-
ties. Off the main square, you can visit the ruins of Amalfi’s Arsenale
Marinaro (Via Matteo Camera, off Piazza Flavio Gioia; Free admission;
Open: Easter–Sept 9 a.m.–8 p.m.), the shipyard where the Republic built
its galleys: the powerful ships could be up to 130 feet long and were used
for both defense and commerce. Violent sea storms caused by a seaquake
destroyed part of the shipyard in the 12th century, contributing to the
Republic’s decline (see “Amalfi’s glory days,” earlier in this chapter); the
yard was never rebuilt.
Stop by the workshop of the descendent of a master papermaker, Antonio
Cavaliere (Via Fiume; % 089-871954; see “The paper of Amalfi,” below),
who produces beautiful paper with original equipment. More paper mills
line the river, which flows through the appropriately named Valle dei
Mulini (mulini means “mills”). The Paper Museum (Palazzo Pagliara, Via
delle Cartiere 23; % 089-8304561; www.museodellacarta.it; Admission:
3.40€/$5.40; Open: Winter Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–1 p.m., summer daily 10 a.m.–
6 p.m.) is filled with antique presses and manuscripts.

Papermaking in Amalfi
Called bambagina, Amalfi’s paper is made from macerated cloth fibers, which are then
filtered and pressed into large frames. Such an art was learned from the Arabs of the
Middle East, with whom the Republic of Amalfi enjoyed flourishing commercial rela-
tionships. Researchers actually believe that the name bambagina is a distortion of the
Arab town that perfected this paper-making technique, El Marubig. The paper indus-
try developed in Amalfi in the 12th and 13th centuries, and continued its expansion
through the Renaissance and into modern times. The first machines were introduced
in the 18th century, and only the development of cheaper paper manufacturing from
wood pulp, in the 19th and 20th centuries, drove the local industry nearly out of busi-
ness. The higher quality of its product kept it alive, though, and Amalfi still produces
and sells paper throughout the world, in spite of the harsh competition. What makes
this paper so special is that its fibers are very soft, making it wonderful to handle and
allowing special effects as in the work of Antonio Cavaliere (see earlier in this chap-
ter), which would be impossible with the harsher and less flexible fibers making up
other qualities of paper.

Positano
Positano is a seaside resort made exclusive by its topography. The west-
ernmost of the three most famous towns on the Amalfi Coast, Positano is
also the most dramatic. Built in the narrow gap between two mountains,
the village slopes steeply to the Tyrrhenian Sea.
The village develops vertically and, as you soon discover, is impossibly
steep. You may want to wear comfortable shoes without heels to climb the
steep alleys and many ramps of steps.
Don’t expect white Caribbean beaches here: The beach is gray and rather
pebbly. The sea, however, is splendid. Just off the coast are the legendary
Sirenuse Islands, Homer’s siren islands in the Odyssey, which form the pri-
vately owned mini-archipelago of Li Galli (The Cocks).
This elegant resort village’s small alleys are filled with boutiques, restau-
rants, and hotels. Aside from the picturesque alleys, the big attraction 
here — you notice it the moment you step into town — is the local style,
known as Positano Fashion. The most well-known shop is Sartoria Maria
Lampo (Viale Pasitea 12; % 089-875021), but we also like La Bottega di
Brunella (Viale Pasitea 76; % 089-875228). A few local designers also spe-
cialize in the production of leather sandals, similar to those made in Capri
(see earlier in this chapter); we like Costanzo Avitabile (Piazza Amerigo
Vespucci 15; % 089-875366).
Ravello
The only one of the major towns that’s not on the coast, Ravello opens
onto a splendid valley with intensive cultivation — vineyards and lemons
and other fruit grow on its steep terraced flanks. The town has a feeling of
subdued elegance, the evidence of its magnificent past — and its past and
present exclusiveness. Celebrities and writers favor this town; the reign-
ing celeb of the moment is Gore Vidal, who purchased a villa as a writing
retreat.
The 11th-century Duomo (Piazza Vescovado; % 089-858311; Admission:
Duomo free, Museum 2€/$3.20; Open: Duomo daily winter 9 a.m.–1 p.m.
and 4–7 p.m.; Museum daily winter 9 a.m.–6 p.m., summer 9 a.m.–8 p.m.)
is a splendid Romanesque church, with a grandiose carved triple portal
and an elegant bell tower from the 13th century. The bronze doors on the
center arch of the portal were sculpted in 1179 by Barisano da Trani, and
cast in Constantinople: they are Italy’s most beautiful, rivaling the more
well-known doors in Florence’s Baptistery and Pisa’s Duomo. Also worth
seeing in the crypt’s small museum is the bust of Sichelgaita della Marra,
a sculpture by the 13th-century artist Bartolomeo da Foggia.
Many of the town’s most beautiful palazzo and villas have been turned
into luxury hotels, but sections of them are still open to visitors.
Renovations by its 19th-century Scottish owner to the 13th-century Villa
Rufolo (Piazza Vescovado; % 089-857657; Admission: 5€/$8; Open: Daily
summer 9 a.m.–8 p.m., winter 9 a.m.–6 p.m.); somewhat altered the origi-
nal beauty of the building, but much of its architecture still deserves a
visit, from the elegant entrance hall to the grand reception and main halls
Chapter 20: Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast 441

to the romantic loggias of the inner court; the gardens with the Terrazza
Wagner, where the German composer received his inspiration for the
Klingsor Garden scene in his Parsifal afford truly splendid views. A steep
ten-minute walk from the center of town, Villa Cimbrone (Via Santa Chiara
26; % 089-858072; www.villacimbrone.it; Admission: 5€/$8; Open:
Daily 9 a.m. to sunset) is the fruit of the extensive renovations of a 15th-
century villa by an eccentric English lord, who bought it at the end of the
19th century. The views and the gardens are very beautiful — particularly
the famous Belvedere Cimbrone, a terrace lined with statues and open-
ing onto a breathtaking panorama stretching from Capri to Paestum,
beyond Salerno. You can also visit part of the villa, which has been turned
into a hotel with a very good restaurant. Ring the bell at the entrance, and
a member of the staff will let you in and take you around.
More cool things to see and do
During your visit to the Amalfi Coast, do not miss the opportunity to
enjoy some of the best art southern Italy has to offer, as well as some 
of its lesser-known attractions.
 About 5km (3 miles) west of Amalfi, Grotta dello Smeraldo (off km
26.4 milestone on SS163; Admission: 5€/$8, admission includes 
elevator to the beach and boat ride to and inside the cave; Open:
Nov–Feb daily 9 a.m.–4 p.m., Mar–Oct daily 9 a.m.–7 p.m., weather
permitting) is an underwater grotto less famous than Capri’s Blue
Grotto — but some say it’s even more beautiful. Ancient formations
of stalactites and stalagmites have been partially invaded by seawa-
ter, creating fantastic effects of light and shade. Descend the steep
staircase from the main road above to the beach, where small boats
take you inside to see this bizarre world. You can get to the grot-
toes by SITA bus (see earlier in this chapter), or by launch service
from Molo Pennello in Amalfi (available 9:30 a.m.–4 p.m.; 10€/$16
round-trip).
 Hiking at least a section of the famous Via degli Incanti, a trail 
that goes all the way from Positano to Amalfi — a distance of 25km
(16 miles) — is the best way to enjoy this stretch of coast. The most
scenic section starts to the right of Chiesa Nuova in the north of
Positano: appropriately named Sentiero degli Dei (Trail of Gods),
the trail is very well marked.
 Many people drive the Amalfi Coast and stop short of Salerno, yet,
its modern harbor and belt of new developments hide a picturesque
medieval district that is one of Italy’s best-kept secrets. Only steps
from the scenic seafront promenade is one of the most beautiful
Romanesque cathedrals in Italy, the 11th-century Duomo (Piazza
Alfano I; % 089-231387; Free admission; Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.).
It is prized both for its architecture — delicate carvings decorate its
halls and portals (the bronze doors are from Constantinople) — and
the art inside, which includes two splendid ambones (pulpits), richly
inlaid with mosaic and carvings. The Chapel of the Crusades, off the
right nave, is where crusaders received blessings before embarking
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
442

on their trip. Adjacent to the church is the museum (Via Monsignor
Monterisi; % 089-239126; Free admission; Open: Daily 9 a.m.–
6 p.m.), with a 12th-century paliotto (altar front) decorated by 54
carved panels. Four frames are missing; each is the coveted posses-
sion of a museum: Paris’s Louvre, New York’s Met, the Berlin State
Museums, and Budapest’s Museum of Fine Arts . You can get there
in 35 minutes by train from Naples, or by ferry/hydrofoil from
Sorrento, Capri, Amalfi, and Positano with Metrò del Mare (% 199-
446644; www.metrodelmare.com; operating Apr–Oct), Alicost 
(% 081-7611004; www.alilauro.it), or Cooperativa Sant’Andrea
(% 089-873190; www.coopsantandrea.it).
 The Greek temples of Paestum are the best-preserved in the world,
second only to the Theseion in Athens. You can visit the three mag-
nificent temples and walk a long section of the fortified walls —
affording beautiful views of the sea — that protected the city (Via
Magna Grecia; % 0828-811023; www.infopaestum.it; Admission:
4€/$6.40; Open: Daily 9 a.m. to sunset, last admission 60 minutes

the street displays the rich collection of artifacts found on-site

area 6.50€/$10; Open: Daily 8:45 a.m.–7:45 p.m., last admission 
45 minutes earlier; Closed the first and third Mon of each month,
Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25).
 In the hills inland of Salerno is the fantastic Carthusian Monastery
(Viale Certosa 1; % 0975-77745; www.magnifico.beniculturali.
it/certosa.html; Admission: 4€/$6.40; Open: Wed–Mon 9 a.m.–
8 p.m., last admission 60 minutes earlier; Closed Jan 1, Aug 15, 
Dec 25) in the little town of Padula. The huge monastery — it
covers over 46,450 sq. m (500,000 sq. ft.) — is a true Renaissance
and baroque masterpiece, with splendid cloisters and elegant cells
for the monks, the most beautiful of all being the apartments of the
Prior. The archaeological museum (% 097-577745; Admission:
3€/$4.20; Open: Daily Oct 1–Mar 31 9 a.m.–7 p.m.) houses the
monastery’s original library and reception halls. Curcio Viaggi
(% 089-254080; www.curcioviaggi.it) runs excellent guided
tours and offers regular bus service from Salerno’s Piazza della
Concordia (also from Firenze or Siena).
Living it up after dark
During the summer months, this whole stretch of coast comes alive with
cultural events, mostly centered on music and the figurative arts. The
music festivals, featuring everything from classical to jazz, animate the
sweet summer nights. The most famous of all is the Ravello Festival 
(Via Roma 10–12; % 089-858422 or 199-109910 for reservations; www.
ravellofestival.com), attracting international artists and a crowd of
connoisseurs. Held in Ravello from June to September, it offers a great
number of concerts and performances by the big names — mostly, but
not entirely, classical. Special series include the Festival Wagneriano, in
Chapter 20: Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast 443

Villa Rufolo, and the Dawn Concerts, held, well, at dawn (by 4 a.m.). The
price of events ranges from free to about 130€ ($208), depending on the
performance. Concerts are scheduled in Amalfi as well; the most popular
are those held in the Chiostro del Paradiso, in Amalfi’s Cathedral, on
Friday nights from July through September. In Positano, Summer Music
is a festival of chamber music that takes place from the end of August
through September. For a schedule of events, contact the tourist office
(% 089-875067; www.aziendaturismopositano.it).
For the best clubs, head for Positano — the place to see and be seen on
the Amalfi Coast. The most popular are Chez Black (Via del Brigantino
19; % 089-875036), La Buca di Bacco (Via del Brigantino 35; % 089-
811461; www.bucapositano.it), and, in the tiny nearby town of Praiano,
the mythical L’Africana (Via Torremare 2, foothpath from Marina di Praia
or elevator from the parking lot off SS 163; % 089-874042; www.africana

Part VII
Sicily

In this part . . .
“You cannot understand Italy without seeing Sicily.
Sicily is where you can ﬁnd the key to everything.”
These words, which Goethe wrote in 1787, still hold true
today. Visiting Sicily is a unique experience: It’s a more intense 
version of Italy, where things from the past are preserved
with a magic vitality and hit you with strength and clarity. It is
also a splendid Mediterranean island where you can abandon
yourself to the task of enjoying life, the food and wine, and
the sea and sun.
In Chapter 21, we tell you everything you need to know about
Palermo, Sicily’s capital and southern Italy’s largest art center.
In Chapter 22, we present the other top destinations in Sicily:
beautiful Taormina; sleepy and mysterious Syracuse; Agrigento,
with its breathtaking Valley of the Temples; as well as a few side
trips — Segesta, Selinunte, Piazza Armerina, and Catania —
all rich in art and attractions.

 Enjoying the sights and activities
S
icily is a big chunk of Italy, both geographically and culturally.
Palermo — the island’s capital and a busy modern port — has been
the political center of “new” Sicily since about 1060 onward. A unique
melting pot of cultures — from Arab to Norman to Spanish — it is a city
rich in stunning works of art and local character. Behind a decaying but
elegant facade, you find some of the region’s — and the country’s —
finest art, particularly in the splendid churches, but also in the good
museums. Similarly, behind their more formal manners and customs,
you get to know the Sicilians as a warm and welcoming people, ready to
help you enjoy your visit.
You can see Palermo’s highlights in one day, but we recommend you
dedicate at least two days to this splendid city. Palermo is also a good
starting point for exploring the rest of Sicily, especially if your time is
limited and you want to take advantage of the numerous day excursions
that are offered from here (see “Seeing Palermo by guided tour,” later in
this chapter).
Getting There
Sicily is well connected with the rest of Italy, as well as with major 
destinations in Europe and in the Mediterranean. The major ports of
entry to the island are Palermo, described in this chapter, and Catania
(see Chapter 22), each with an important harbor, airport, and, of course,
train and bus stations. For a map of Sicily, see the inside back cover of 
this book.
By ferry
Of the many ways to get here, our favorite is the overnight ferry:
Passengers can comfortably sleep in their cabins and have more time for
sightseeing the next day, and early risers get to enjoy some fabulous
views. Several ferry companies serve Sicily: SNAV (Via Giordano Bruno 84;

% 081-4285555 in Naples, 0766-366366 in Civitavecchia; www.snav.it)
runs ferries daily from Naples and every other day from Civitavecchia (the
harbor about one hour north of Rome and easily connected to the capital
by very frequent train and bus service, as well as car service). Tirrenia
(% 892123 in Italy, or 081-0171998 from abroad; www.tirrenia.it) 
operates daily overnight service from Naples. Grimaldi Ferries (% 081-
496444; www.grimaldi-ferries.com) offers weekly service between
Salerno (on the Amalfi Coast), Tunis, and Palermo. GNV (tel 010-589331
in Genoa and 1586-409804 in Livorno) offers service to Palermo from
Genoa, Livorno, Civitavecchia, and Tunis. Rates vary depending on the
season, the seats or cabin chosen, and whether you’re bringing a car;
they range from around 60€ to 150€ ($96–$240) per person. It takes
about 11 hours to travel from Naples or Salerno to Palermo, and 13
hours from Civitavecchia.
By air
Flying is less romantic than taking the ferry, but it’s a lot faster. Daily
flights connect Palermo to all other destinations in Italy and most major
destinations in Europe (from the U.S., you need a connecting flight).
Alitalia (% 06-2222, or 800-223-5730 in the U.S.; www.alitalia.it or
www.alitaliausa.com) has several flights a day from Italian cities to
Sicily. Meridiana (% 892928 in Italy, or 0789-52682 from abroad; www.
meridiana.it) and Air One (% 06-48880069; www.flyairone.it)
may offer better deals from some Italian and European destinations.
Palermo’s airport, Falcone Borsellino (% 800-541880 or 091-7020111;
www.gesap.it) — locally called Punta Raisi — lies 31km (19 miles)
west of Palermo. In the arrivals concourse, you find a bank with ATM, a
currency-exchange office, and a tourist information desk; public trans-
portation is just outside the terminal.
The airport is a 25-minute taxi ride to the center of town; expect to pay
about 40€ ($64). The airport is also connected to the city by rail: The
shuttle train offered by Trinacria Express runs every hour (every half-
hour at peak times) and costs 5€ ($8). You can also take the bus, run 
by Prestia & Comandè (% 091-580457), to Palermo’s rail station; it
departs every 30 minutes and makes five stops in town, including the
modern harbor and the Teatro Politeama. It takes about half an hour and
costs 5.30€ ($8.50).
The airport of Catania (see chapter 22) is connected to Palermo by bus
service provided by SAIS AUTOLINEE (% 0935-524111; www.sais
autolinee.it).
By train
Sicily is served by train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) from all
major destinations: Cars are put on a train ferry at Messina and then
continue on to Palermo. The trips are long, but sleeping cars can be
Part VII: Sicily 
448

quite comfortable if you book a single, double, or triple cabin; regular
cuccette (sleeping berths) in a six-seat compartment are more cramped.
The ride from Rome to Palermo takes 11 or 12 hours and costs about
90€ ($144). Trains arrive at Palermo’s Stazione Centrale, at Piazza
Giulio Cesare (% 091-6165914), on the southeastern edge of the historic
district.
Orienting Yourself in Palermo
Palermo is a port city, organized around its busy waterfront: To the west
is the modern harbor, with piers for large ships; to the east is the old
harbor — La Cala — a rounded basin where sailing and fishing boats
bob sleepily in the sun. Via Francesco Crispi is the major thoroughfare
running along the waterfront from the modern harbor to La Cala. The
historic district centers around and inland of the old harbor. To the east
is La Kalsa, the ancient Arab quarters, with Piazza Marina by the harbor
and Piazza Magione at its heart; to the south and west are the four man-
damenti (neighborhoods) of the old town. This is neatly divided into
four sections by Corso Vittorio Emanuele (running northeast to south-
west and leading from the old harbor to the royal residence of Palazzo
dei Normanni) and Via Maqueda (running northwest to southeast and
leading from Piazza Verdi, with the Teatro Massimo, to Piazza Giulio
Cesare, with the train station and bus terminal), intersecting at Piazza
Vigliena, appropriately called Quattro Canti (Four Corners) by locals.
Parallel to Via Maqueda to the north is Via Roma.
During the 19th century, the city expanded to the west, developing the
modern harbor and, inland, a residential and commercial neighborhood.
The heart of this more modern section of the historic district is Piazza
Castelnuovo, with the Teatro Politeama, crossed by the continuation of
Via Maqueda — Via Ruggero VII — and its further continuation to the
northwest, Via della Libertà, the elegant avenue leading to the gardens
of Villa Trabia and Giardino Inglese.
Farther to the north is Monte Pellegrino, a steep mountain overlooking
the sea; up the hill to the south is Monreale, a separate town overlook-
ing the city (it is to Palermo as Fiesole is to Florence). The great attrac-
tion here, enough in itself to justify your whole trip to Sicily, is the
Duomo, with its cloister (see later in this chapter).
Introducing the neighborhoods
All of the neighborhoods below are safe. For tips on safety, see “Getting
Around Palermo,” and “Safety” under “Fast Facts: Palermo,” both later in
this chapter.
La Kalsa
The most famous — and once the most notorious — neighborhood in
Palermo, this residential area of picturesque narrow streets stretches
Chapter 21: Palermo 449

southeast of the old harbor. There was a time when visitors and locals
wouldn’t come here at all if they valued their lives: Crooks and thugs
had made this neighborhood their headquarters. Today, it’s perfectly
safe (although do observe typical big-city caution) and is now the focus
of an exuberant nightlife, cultural, and dining scene (see “Exploring
Palermo,” later in this chapter).
Piazza Castelnuovo
Less picturesque than the old town, but much more elegant, this neigh-
borhood was first developed in the late 19th century. This is the modern
heart of Palermo, its streets lined with boutiques, restaurants, theaters,
and, of course, hotels. The Teatro Politeama, where opera and ballet are
staged (see “Living It Up After Dark,” later in this chapter), is the ren-
dezvous point for locals of every age, who meet here in noisy and color-
ful groups before heading for their evening destination, whether a
restaurant or a simple stroll. One favorite stroll is along beautiful Via
Libertà, which is lined with Liberty (Italian Art Nouveau) palaces.
Piazza Verdi
Dominated by the beautiful Teatro Massimo, where opera and concerts
are presented, this neighborhood sits at the hinge of the old town of 
the Quattro Canti (see later) and the 19th-century district of Piazza
Castelnuovo (see earlier). It shares some of the characteristics of each,
preserving a historical feeling yet more stately and well maintained than
the oldest neighborhoods in town. Centrally located, it is within walking
distance of many attractions and is not far from the modern harbor, with
its numerous hotels and restaurants.
Quattro Canti
The heart of the oldest part of town along with La Kalsa (see earlier),
this is where you find most of the attractions in the historic district,
including some of Palermo’s most important monuments, such as La
Martorana, Palazzo dei Normanni, and the Cattedrale. This area is
home to many hotels and restaurants, an active nightlife scene, and
lively shopping — including the famous Vucciria open-air market.
Finding information after you arrive
The main tourist office is at Piazza Castelnuovo 34, across from the
Teatro Politeama (% 091-6058351; www.palermotourism.com; Open:
Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–2 p.m. and 3–6 p.m.); it maintains two tourist info
points, one at the airport (% 091-591698; Open: Mon–Fri 8 a.m. to mid-
night, Sat–Sun 8 a.m.–8 p.m.), and one at the train station on Piazza
Giulio Cesare (% 091-6165914; Open: Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–2 p.m. and 
3–6 p.m.).

Getting Around Palermo
Modern Palermo sprawls between the mountains and the sea, but the
historic district and its sights are fairly concentrated, making it easy to
visit.
Despite the police’s best efforts, purse-snatchers (often operating from
motor scooters) and pickpockets are a common reality. Backpacks are
especially susceptible, as their bottoms can be easily sliced without
your noticing it. Observe common big-city caution and, at night, avoid
deserted, run-down streets, as muggings are not unheard of.
On foot
Palermo is an interesting city to discover on foot; the city layout is
simple, making it easy to find your way. Among the hidden surprises of
the back streets in the historic district are forlorn blocks with partially
destroyed buildings — some by World War II bombings, others by earth-
quakes — that are still unrepaired. We have walked down some of these
streets (by day) to look at the shuttered villas of the Sicilian aristocracy
and never had any problem, but everyone has their own comfort level. If
you don’t feel comfortable, turn around and take a different street.
The free map from the tourist office is perfectly adequate for most visi-
tors; if you want more detail, you can pick up a map with stradario
(street directory) at most news kiosks.
By bus
Palermo’s bus system (% 848-800817; www.amat.pa.it) is functional
and well run. Regular bus tickets cost 1€ ($1.60) and are valid for two
hours; you can save a little if you want to invest in a carnet of 20 individ-
ual tickets, selling for 19€ ($30); you can also get a giornaliero (day
pass) for 3.50€ ($5.60). Tickets are sold at tobacconist stores and news
kiosks around town, or onboard with a surcharge of 0.40€ (65¢; exact
change required); you can get a free bus map at the information office at
Via Giusti 7 (Open: Mon–Wed 8 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–5:30 p.m.; Thurs–Fri 
8 a.m.–1 p.m.).
The three electric minibus lines (red, yellow, and green) are convenient
for visiting all the important attractions in Palermo; they loop through
the historic district Monday through Saturday from 7:45 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
and Sunday and holidays from 7:45 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Use them as you
would a hop-on/hop-off tour bus; the ticket costs 0.50€ (80¢) and is valid
for one day on all lines.
By taxi
Taxis are an excellent way to get around Palermo; you find taxi stands at
Politeama, Piazza Verdi, Piazza Matteotti, Via Notarbartolo, and Via
Roma, as well as at the modern harbor and the train station. You can
Part VII: Sicily 
452

also be picked up anywhere by calling a radio taxi (% 091-225455 or
091-513311). The meter starts at 3.81€ ($6.10) and goes up 2.54€ ($4.05)
and 0.13€ (21¢) for every additional kilometer (2⁄3 mile); you also pay a
surcharge of 1.91€ ($3.05) at night (10 p.m.–6 a.m.), 1.58€ ($2.50) on hol-
idays, 0.32 (51¢) per piece of luggage, 0.64€ ($1) for radio-taxi calls, and
9.53€ ($15) for trips to and from the airport.
It’s a lot easier — and will avoid friction on both sides — if you ask 
the driver to estimate the charge for your destination upfront, rather
than being surprised by an extravagant amount upon arrival. Ask the
concierge at your hotel for the likely charge for your destination and, if
need be, negotiate with the driver. If it doesn’t sound reasonable, take
another cab.
Staying in Style
Hotels in Palermo are mixed, ranging from old-fashioned accommoda-
tions that are remnants of a previous era (beware of those) to modern,
up-to-international-standards hotels. Rates tend to be considerably
lower than in other major Italian destinations such as Venice, Rome, 
and Florence, so you can stay in superior hotels without paying through
the nose.
If you arrive without a reservation, check with the tourist office for 
assistance — it maintains information desks at the airport and the train
station (see “Information” under “Fast Facts: Palermo,” later in this 
chapter).

Monreale
We’re not great fans of staying out of the historic district when that’s what
you’ve come to see, but we have to make an exception for this wonderful
place. Housed in a historic baglio (paper mill) on the slopes of the hill of
Monreale, south of Palermo, it is located 10km (6 miles) away from the city
center and only 3km (2 miles) from Monreale. Perfectly restored, the villa
welcomes its guests in elegant public spaces done with frescoed ceilings
and wooden beams; guest rooms are splendid, with a good mix of modern
comforts and countryside elegance. The hotel’s restaurant, Absidi, is quite
good and open to the public. Note: If you’re driving, be forewarned that
the hotel is off the main road and not easy to find after dusk. The hotel
offers a shuttle service to the historic district.

Teatro Massimo
Once a private home, the Grand Hotel opened in 1874 and immediately
became the place to stay in Palermo: Wagner finished writing his Parsifal
here. The classically inspired lobby has marble floors, Greek columns,
chandeliers, marble staircases, and original Art Nouveau furnishings.
Guest rooms are spacious and grand, but not all of them have been
updated, and some are rather staid. The excellent buffet breakfast is
served in the Hall of Mirrors (Sala degli Specchi) — a superb hall used also
for private receptions — and the hotel’s restaurant, La Palmetta, serves
lunch and dinner fare.

Monte Pellegrino
Recently purchased by Hilton, the best hotel in Palermo is not only a hotel,
but also a historic site: A former private villa on the outskirts of town, Villa
Igiea is a masterpiece of the Sicilian Liberty (Italian Art Nouveau) style,
completely designed — right down to the furnishings — by Sicilian archi-
tect Ernesto Basile. The hotel is surrounded by splendid terraced gardens
overlooking the bay. It features two restaurants with a panoramic terrace,
a piano bar, and a saltwater pool. The spacious guest rooms are as glam-
orous as the public areas, with elegant furnishings and fine fabrics; some
offer glorious views and private terraces. Be aware that some of the
cheaper rooms may not have been renovated and could be a bit worn, with
aging bathrooms.

Dining Out
Even within Italy, where every town seems to lay claim to a unique 
cuisine, Sicily is exceptional: The Sicilians perfected multiculturalism
centuries ago, so here you can find pasta and meats seasoned with pista-
chio nuts, almonds, North African spices, and, because Sicily is an
island, many culinary treasures from the sea (see Chapter 2 for details).
Two dining areas well worth checking out are Piazza Marina, behind the
recreational harbor of La Cala, and the area around the Teatro Politeama,
on Piazza Castelnuovo, where locals go for more traditional and elegant
dining. In addition, some of the hotels reviewed earlier have excellent
restaurants that are popular with locals.

La Kalsa
SNACKS
More of a snack joint than a restaurant, this eatery is a Palermo institution
for those in the know. Here you find some delicious and difficult-to-find
staples of Sicilian traditional fast food, served since 1834. The best is pan-
elle (chickpea fritters), arancini (deep-fried stuffed rice balls), and the
more recent addition of focaccia farcita (stuffed pizza). If you’re daring, try
the house specialty, deep-fried spleen sandwich, served with or without
cheese (we prefer without, but also decided we could live very well with-
out the whole thing altogether).

Located in the more elegant part of the town center, Capricci di Sicilia is

sardines and wild fennel), maccheroni alla Norma (with eggplant), invol-
tini di pesce spada (rolled and stuffed swordfish), and trionfo di pesce
azzurro (several kinds of bluefish — grilled, sautéed, roasted, or poached).
Finish your meal with cassata (sweet creamy cheese and candied fruit) —
they make an awesome one here.

This trattoria, opened in 1890, claims to be the oldest in Palermo. Indeed,
the dining room is very atmospheric, but the old-fashioned ambience isn’t
a bit ruined by the new air-conditioning. We love coming here for the buffet
of antipasti, always including a large variety of traditional fish and veg-
etable specialties, as well as for the traditional primi — our faves are pasta
alla Norma (with eggplant) and pasta con le sarde (with sardines) — and
the well-prepared grilled fish. It gets very crowded at lunch, so come early.

In the residential area a short distance north of the center, this is an excel-

menu includes some successful innovative touches. We loved the squid-ink
pasta with seafood ragout, the mackerel with caper sauce, and the polpet-
tine di pesce azzurro al finocchio selvatico (wild-fennel fish cakes). Desserts
are also very good.

don’t eat until 9 or even 9:30 p.m. in summer — or be prepared to wait.
Try the superb pasta con le sarde (pasta with sardines, fennel, and tomato

is always tasty.

Not everything in Palermo is traditional; this small osteria framed by the
splendid Palazzo Gangi (made famous by the ball scenes of Visconti’s
movie Il Gattopardo) specializes in innovative cuisine, for which chef and
proprietor Alberto Rizzo has become renowned. Try the soup made with
local mushrooms, or perhaps the mushroom, potato, and thyme ravioli
over cheese fondue with truffles and fresh parsley. The pork filet mignon
in hazelnut crust is also worthwhile. In a land known for idiosyncrasy,
Rizzo earns that reputation. The 45€ ($72) tasting menu is a great deal.

Part VII: Sicily

The Mafia
The region’s reputation as headquarters of the Mafia and its bloody vendettas scared
people away from Sicily, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, when the internal fights
between the new generation — mostly drug traffickers and thugs — and the old 
generation — the “men of honor,” as they liked to call themselves — allowed the
police to butt in and bring to justice many criminals. The magistrates stood up to the
challenge, some at the cost of their lives (Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino were
slaughtered in 1992), and started a crackdown that cleared much ground and lifted
the heavy veil that had weighed upon the island for so long. Most of this is now 
history — you can even visit the Mafia Museum in Corleone (Palazzo Provenzano, Via
Orfanotrofio 7; % 091-8464907) — but as with all recent history, it has left scars that
are slow to heal. The changes are tangible and far-reaching: The trials spawned a
Sicilian renaissance that has brought about restoration and reopening of monuments
that had been closed for decades, and, even more important, a jolt of cultural and eco-
nomic energy that has given new life to the island.

Exploring Palermo
Discovering the top attractions
Just wandering around the historic district is fascinating — note the var-
ious styles and cultural overlays that bear witness to Palermo’s varie-
gated history. The old town, centered around Piazza Vigliena, is a sight
unto itself; the small square is appropriately called Teatro del Sole
(Theater of the Sun) because you can see the sun from sunrise to sunset,
and it is very picturesque . . . but you should not miss the nearby Piazza
Bellini — one of the most attractive squares in town — nor Fontana
Pretoria on Piazza Pretoria, at the intersection of Via Vittorio Emanuele
and Via Maqueda. Created for a Florentine villa, this magnificent 16th-
century fountain was sold to the Palermo Senate when the villa’s owner
died. The nudes created a big scandal at the time, and for a while it was
called the “Fountain of Shame.”
Cattedrale and Museo Diocesano
Palermo’s cathedral was built in 1185 atop a mosque that was itself built
atop a Byzantine church. In this architectural sandwich, some material
was reused; for example, in the portico is a column (first on the left) with
an engraved inscription from the Koran, an unusual feature for a Catholic
church. The church went through many renovations, but the Romanesque
exterior is still original; this creates quite a shock when you go in and find
yourself deep into baroque. Many masterpieces are hidden inside: Look
for the bas-reliefs by Vincenzo and Fazio Gagini on the altar, and for the
Madonna with Child by Francesco Laurana in the seventh chapel of 
the left nave (Laurana’s famous sculpture of Eleonora d’Aragona is in the
Galleria Regionale Siciliana — see later in this chapter). The apses are 
the only section of the interior that are still original from the 12th century.
From a door to the right of Santa Rosalia chapel inside the cathedral, or
from the garden outside, you can access the crypt and the treasury; the
latter contains a variety of precious objects, including chalices, vestments,
and other utensils of the Catholic rite, as well as the crown of Constance
of Aragon, the wife of Frederick II. The cathedral also houses the tombs of
Sicily’s kings and emperors, including those of Holy Roman Emperor
Frederick II and Roger II.
Recently open to the public, the Museo Diocesano is housed in the beau-
tiful archbishop’s palace attached to the cathedral to the left (entrance on
Via Matteo Bonello). It holds a great collection of religious art from the
12th to the 19th centuries.

Chiesa del Gesù
Most commonly called the Casa Professa, after the library attached to the
church, this was the first church in Sicily founded by the Jesuits. Its inte-
rior is rich in stucco work by several members of the Serpotta family
(famous Palermitan sculptors who operated between the 17th and the 18th
centuries). We love the beautiful marble inlays, in a large range of colors,
that decorate the altar and walls. The original Renaissance church, in the
form of a Latin cross (a nave and two short aisles), was much changed in
the following century by the Jesuit Natale Masuccio, who made it into one
of the most ostentatious churches of the Sicilian baroque. The lavish dec-
orations have been preserved despite the damage caused by a 1943 bomb-
ing, which partially destroyed the church.

Chiesa della Martorana
Built in 1143 by Giorgio di Antiochia, admiral to Ruggero II, this church was
transformed during later centuries, but its stunning Byzantine mosaics were
luckily preserved, magnificently depicting religious scenes from the life of
Mary. The mosaic on the balustrade contains an interesting detail: It shows
Roger II getting his crown directly from Christ and not from the pope — a
direct political statement against the church in Rome. The name Martorana
comes from the nearby convent, founded by the Martorana family. Tradition
says that the nuns there invented the little marzipan fruits that today are a
typical — and delicious — souvenir from Sicily. They still sell the original
creations: bunches of grapes made of almond paste, each grape delicately
painted with sugar, the stems made of candied orange peel covered in dark
chocolate — a bit expensive, yes, but a treat fit for a king.

Duomo di Monreale
Overlooking Palermo about 10km (6 miles) away, Monreale dominates the
city from its beautiful hill. The great attraction here, enough in itself to jus-
tify your whole trip to Sicily, is the Duomo, with its cloister. This 12th-
century Romanesque church is one of the most breathtaking in existence.
It may not be exceptional for its Norman exterior — the Duomo in Palermo
is more interesting — but the interior is extraordinary. The church is deco-
rated with 6,000 sq. m (55,000 sq. ft.) of fabulous Byzantine mosaics depict-
ing scenes from the Old and New Testaments; only in Constantinople — in
the Hagia Sofia — did the Byzantines create a more extensive series of
mosaics. The floors are also magnificent, made up of remarkable marble
mosaics, and the bronze doors by Bonanno Pisano (designer of Pisa’s
famous tower) are masterpieces. You can also visit the treasury, with its col-
lection of precious religious objects, and the terraces, from which you can
enjoy pretty views over the attached cloister and the town.
Part VII: Sicily 
460

Annexed to the church is the cloister from 1180, one of the most beautiful
in Italy. A unique work of art, its 228 double columns are decorated with indi-
vidual details, some with mosaic inlay and each with a different pattern; the
carved stone capitals are amazingly intricate renderings of scenes such as
battles, the punishment of the damned, and stories of obscure meaning with
fanciful and incredibly detailed carvings. Allow about 30 minutes for the bus
ride from Palermo and about an hour and a half for your visit.

Galleria Regionale Siciliana
Housed in the 15th-century Palazzo Abatellis — in elegant late Catalan-
Gothic style — this is the principal museum of Sicilian art from the 13th to
the 18th centuries. Among the many treasures inside, the 15th-century
Triumph of Death is a powerful and intriguing fresco that came from the
hall of the 1330 Palazzo Sclafani in town: A skeleton on horseback fires
arrows at pleasure seekers, rich prelates, and other sinners as the poor
and ill look on (the two artists who did the fresco painted themselves in
this group). The faces are incredibly expressive; Picasso could have done
the horse’s head. One of the words that comes to mind when seeing this
work is “modern.” It’s unfortunate that its creator’s identity is not known.
Chapter 21: Palermo 461
Palermo’s place in the sun
Although today Palermo may seem off the beaten track in terms of tourism, its treasures
attest that it was once the center of an empire: Holy Roman emperor Frederick II
(1194–1250) was born in Italy, and he made Palermo his capital. It eventually became
one of the most renowned and magnificent courts in the Western world. Before that,
Palermo had been an important Phoenician, Greek, Roman, and Byzantine harbor, but it
was only with the Arabs, in the ninth century, that it gained importance in the
Mediterranean. The new rulers made Palermo into Sicily’s capital, gracing the flourish-
ing commercial and cultural center with beautiful palaces and innumerable mosques
(over 300, it is said). Little remains of that period: The Normans erased most traces of
the Arab presence when they took over the city in 1072, transforming most of the palaces
and churches with their own architectural style. Sicily was taken over by Spain in the
15th century and was reunited with Italy by the Bourbons in the 18th century.
Palermo suffered severe damage by earthquakes in the early 20th century and was
bombarded in World War II; much of it seems to have never recovered. However,
Palermo’s intertwined traditions have left behind a city like no other in the world, where
“multiculturalism” has flourished since the early Middle Ages.

Our favorite painting is Antonello da Messina’s Madonna Annunziata,
looking out from under a blue mantle, which displays the painter’s uncanny
ability to portray more than one emotion at the same time. Francesco
Laurana’s splendid marble bust of Eleonora d’Aragona is one of the most
famous works in Sicily. Note: At press time the gallery was closed for
restoration, so check if has reopened at the time of your visit.

La Kalsa
This is one of Palermo’s oldest neighborhoods, created by the Arabs 
as their emir’s walled citadel when they took over the island and the town
in A.D. 831. Left undisturbed — and decaying — the neighborhood had
become one of the most dangerous areas in Palermo until the late 1980s,
when a successful plan of renovation and revitalization transformed it into
a lively cultural destination, attracting intellectuals and artists as well as
regular people who come for the many events, restaurants, and nightlife.
Although some of the area still needs refurbishing, it is extremely inter-
esting to explore.
La Kalsa developed around Piazza Magione, southeast of Piazza Marina
and Palermo’s old harbor, La Cala. The grandiose battle scene between
Garibaldi and the Bourbons in the famous Visconti movie Il Gattopardo
(The Leopard) was filmed on Piazza Magione. Piazza Marina is one of La
Kalsa’s main features, with its beautiful garden enclosed by elegant
Liberty-style iron railings and graced by an impressive giant ficus. Via
Alloro was the citadel’s main street, as you can see from the once-elegant
palaces lining it. Unfortunately, much of the Arabs’ fine work was
destroyed when the Spanish viceroys took over, adding their own archi-
tectural interpretations, and many of the later palazzi were damaged or
destroyed by earthquakes and World War II, and are now mostly semi-
abandoned. For an idea of what they looked like in their former splendor,
visit Palazzo Mirto (Via Merlo 2; % 091-6167541; Admission: 3€/$4.80;
Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun and holidays 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m.), which

% 091-6171658; Open: Fri–Wed 7–11 a.m. and daily 4:30–6 p.m.), a good
example of the irrepressible Sicilian baroque, lavishly decorated inside

century San Francesco d’Assisi (Piazza San Francesco, off Via Merlo; 
% 091-582370; open occasionally), with a superb 14th-century portal and
handsome carvings inside its magnificent chapel Mastrantonio.

Museo Archeologico Regionale Salinas
Built on the site of a monastery, this museum occupies several buildings
and contains what is probably the most impressive archaeological collec-
tion in the country. Walking through its rooms is a good introduction to
Sicily’s ancient history, from pre-historic findings to Roman times. On the
ground floor you see the major art finds from Greek and Roman sites on
the island, particularly from Tindari, Solunto, and Selinunte. One of the
most famous pieces is the head of Medusa. The basement houses a recon-
struction of clay decorations of a Greek temple, while in the Sala Marconi
you find a partial reconstruction of the cornice moldings with lion heads
from the Temple of Victory in Himera. The museum also holds beautiful
Roman bronze statues — note in particular the bronze statue of a ram —
and a fair amount of Etruscan pottery and other objects. Also remarkable
are the Phoenician works dating from the fifth century B.C., including sar-
cophagi depicting human images.
Note: Plans are not definite, but this museum may close sometime in 2009
for a major reorganization, with a prospected period of 3 years. Call before
setting out.

Palazzo dei Normanni and Cappella Palatina
Built over an ancient Roman palace — itself probably built over a Cartha-
ginian building — this palazzo embodies the island’s culture of continuity 
in change. The imposing building was the castle and royal residence of the
various powers that reigned over Palermo, from the Arab emir to the current
Regional Assembly of Sicily. In the 12th century, the Normans remodeled the
palace, which had been the residence of the Arab emir. It had four towers,
of which only one remains today, the Torre Pisana. It was remodeled again
in the 16th century as the residence of the Spanish viceroy. The royal apart-
ments are open to the public, but because of the parliamentary meetings,
access is restricted (see details later). On the third floor is the Sala di
Ruggero, originally the bedroom of Ruggero II (1095–1154), with mosaics
representing hunting scenes and striking animals and plant forms. On the
second floor is the famous Cappella Palatina (Palatine Chapel), with its
impressive decorations. The chapel, started by Ruggero II in 1132, took over
ten years to complete and is a harmony of masterwork from different cul-
tures — Arab artisans made the inlaid wooden ceilings (a type of work
known as muqarnas), Sicilians did the stonecutting, and the mosaics are
Byzantine. The walls and dome are completely covered with rich mosaics
representing scenes from the Old Testament (the nave), Christ’s life (the
southern transept), and the lives of Peter and Paul (the aisles). Note the can-
dlestick by the entrance — it’s intricately carved from a single piece of stone
and stands over 3.9m (13 ft.) tall.

Teatro Massimo
Begun in 1875 but not completed until 1897, this building cost a fortune
and was Italy’s largest and most splendid theater at a time when Palermo
didn’t even have a good hospital. The theater is a masterpiece of Liberty
style (Italian Art Nouveau) and was designed by Gian Battista and Ernesto
Basile, the famous Sicilian father-and-son Art Nouveau stylists. The stage
and backstage measure 1,280 sq. m (12,000 sq. ft.), the second largest in
Europe after the Opéra Garnier in Paris. Its greatest marvel is a painted
ceiling with 11 panels that open like flower petals to let heat escape from
the interior during intermissions. Since the building’s conception, the only
change that’s been made is a new wood floor for better acoustics. The
building was used not only as a theater, but also as a meeting place, and
these rooms were the site of important business and political meetings.
The most famous is the Sala Pompeiana, at the level of the second loggia,
where the men would meet; it’s designed so that the sound of voices would
keep bouncing from wall to wall and not escape the room and disturb the
performance. After being closed for 23 years of restoration work, the thea-
ter reopened in 1997.

Santa Rosalia
If you happen to be in Palermo between July 11 and July 15, you’ll be surprised by the
enthusiastic celebrations of Palermo’s patron saint, Santa Rosalia. The festivities com-
memorate the anniversary of the discovery of the saint’s remains. Niece of Norman
King Guglielmo II, Rosalia abandoned the palace (Palazzo dei Normanni, described
earlier in this chapter) for a cave on Monte Pellegrino to live a life of prayer. Many
centuries after her death, during the terrible plague epidemic of 1624, her bones were
found and brought down the mountain. As the procession bringing her remains tra-
versed the city, the epidemic miraculously stopped (a good reason to keep celebrat-
ing her!). During the festival, a religious procession — with a huge, beautifully
decorated triumphal carriage carrying an orchestra — winds through the town.
There’s also a spectacular candlelit procession up Monte Pellegrino to Santa Rosalia’s
cave. The end of the festival is marked by great fireworks.

trees shipped from all over the world and planted around his villa. High
society in Palermo flocked here for lavish parties — royalty came from as
far away as Great Britain. The villa is still stocked with beautiful antiques
and furnishings of various styles and periods. The most beautiful of the
rooms, the Sala d’Estate (Summer Room), is decorated with trompe l’oeil
frescoes on the walls and ceiling.

Admission: 3€ ($4.80). Open: Call for reservations.
Finding more cool things to see and do
The major sites of Palermo are stunning, but there’s still much more to
see and do. Here are a few recommendations:
 The city has three much-visited traditional food markets (Open:
Mon–Sat 6 a.m.–4 p.m.), where fruits, vegetables, meat, and fish
provide an explosion of colors and flavors. La Vucciria, whose
name comes from the French word boucherie (“meat store”), is 
in La Kalsa and runs along Via Argenteria to Piazza Garraffello.
Ballarò is our favorite and Palermo’s oldest, running from Piazza
Casa Professa to Corso Tukory toward Porta Sant’Agata; it’s con-
nected to the market of Casa Professa, which sells shoes and sec-
ondhand clothing. Smaller Il Capo covers Via Carini and Via Beati
Paoli, crossing Via Sant’Agostino and Via Cappuccinelle. All are
best visited in the morning. Beware of potential purse-snatchers
and pickpockets riding motorini.
 We fell in love with the work of Giacomo Serpotta, the Sicilian sculp-
tor who excelled in the use of marble and polychrome, but became
famous for his stucco work — his putti (cherubs) in particular. His
masterpiece is the Oratorio del Rosario di San Domenico (Via dei
Bambinai 2, off Via Roma; % 091-6090308; www.campodivolo.it),
which he lavishly decorated between 1714 and 1717 (inside you also
find Anthony Van Dyck’s Madonna of the Rosary, commissioned
during the artist’s stay in Palermo in 1624). Between 1687 and 1718,
the Sicilian sculptor decorated the nearby Oratorio di Santa Cita
(Via Valverde 3, off Via Squarcialupo, between Via Cavour and Via
Roma, on the left of the church), creating a whole world of stucco
figures and reliefs. Admission is 2.50€ ($4) for each; both are open
Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
 One of the most famous sights of Palermo is San Giovanni degli
Eremiti (Via dei Benedettini 3; % 091-6515019; Admission: 6€/$9.60;
Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun and holidays 9 a.m–1:30 p.m.).
Although it is a Christian church, it was built at the height of the
Arab-Norman style, and thus it was given five round red domes. The
church is a ruin and the inside is open to the elements; once you’ve
seen it from the outside, you have experienced most of its charm,
although its 13th-century cloister is also quite nice.
 One of the few examples of Arab architecture left in town, La Zisa
(Piazza Guglielmo il Buono; % 091-6520269; Admission: 3€/$4.80;
Chapter 21: Palermo 465

Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun and holidays 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m.;
Ticket booth closes 30 minutes earlier) dates from 1165. Known for
its elegant columns and mosaics, the palace was surrounded by a
park with an artificial lake in which the building was reflected (a
few hundred years before the Taj Mahal), small rivers, and ponds
for fish. The origin of the name is uncertain — it may have
belonged to an Arab noblewoman, Azisa, or may have been built for
King Guglielmo I (William) using Arab techniques and hence named
Al-Aziz, “The Magnificent.” The surrounding garden has disappeared,
but the building has been restored and houses a museum of Islamic
art, including a rich collection of the characteristic carved wooden
screens known as musciarabia.
 La Cuba (Corso Calatafimi 100, inside the Corso Tukory; % 091-
590-299; Admission: 2€/$3.20; Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun 
9 a.m.–1 p.m.), a dome surrounded by gardens, is another striking
example of Arab and early Norman architecture. It was built by
Guglielmo II in 1180 in the Park of Genoardo; its beauty was so
famous that Boccaccio used it in the Decameron. The building is
only one floor, organized around a central space with a star-shaped
fountain. Today, only the external walls and giant arches remain.
 If you’re into catacombs and you aren’t squeamish, you will enjoy
the Catacombe dei Cappuccini (Via Cappuccini 1; % 091-212117;
Admission: 1.50€/2.40; Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m. to noon and 3–5 p.m.),
which were used as a burial spot until 1920. For some reason, these
catacombs miraculously preserved the dead — or at least some of
them — and they still contain 8,000 mummified bodies of aristo-
cratic Sicilians and priests, still dressed in the costumes of their
time. Needless to say, this is not a “kid-friendly” sight, unless you
have teenagers.
 If you’re visiting in high season, you may want to take a break from
the art and hop onto bus no. 806 or 833 from Teatro Politeama to
the beach of Mondello (a few miles west of town beyond Punta
Raisi). A favorite with locals, it gets crowded at the height of
summer (July and Aug) but is quite nice in the shoulder season
(spring and fall), when the Mediterranean waters are mild enough
for a swim.
Seeing Palermo by guided tour
The best bus tour in town is the Giro Città (% 091-6902690; www.amat.
pa.it), a loop starting from Teatro Politeama (Piazza Ruggero Settimo 9;
offered Apr–Sept daily at 9:15 a.m.). Tickets cost 11€ ($17) per person
(children under 12 ride free) and can be purchased directly on the bus.
Another good option is CitySightseeing (% 091-589429; www.palermo.
city-sightseeing.it), whose open double-decker buses depart on
two loops every 30 minutes from Teatro Politeama; tickets cost 20€ ($32)
for adults, 10€ ($16) for youths 5 to 15 (children under 5 go free).
Part VII: Sicily 
466

Several companies organize guided tours to all the major attractions in
Sicily, departing from Palermo on a daily basis. CST (Compagnia Siciliana
Turismo; Via Resuttana 360, 11th floor; % 091-7487234; www.compagnia
sicilianaturismo.it) is one of the best; it offers guided bus tours of
the island that include the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento, Piazza
Armerina, and Mount Etna. Excursions depart from both Palermo and
Taormina; those from Palermo are priced from about 20€ ($32).
Suggested one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
Palermo deserves as much time as you can give it. Here are our sugges-
tions on how to manage the time you have.
Palermo in one day
You have only time for a quick bite of Palermo’s attractions, but the
taste will stay with you forever. After a nice breakfast of ice cream and
brioche — a Sicilian tradition, delicious with coffee on the side — head
for the Cattedrale, Palermo’s Duomo. Keep up your strength, however,
as you need to continue on to Palermo’s most stunning attraction, the
Palazzo dei Normanni. Visit the splendid royal apartments and the 
magnificent Palatine Chapel before lunch. Dedicate the afternoon to
Monreale (a 30-minute bus ride from the Palazzo dei Normanni), visiting
the superb Duomo and its cloister, one of the world’s most beautiful.
Return to Palermo for drinks and dinner: If you head for the waterfront
in the neighborhood of La Kalsa, by the horseshoe-shaped old harbor,
La Cala, you find some excellent restaurants, including the ones we rec-
ommend in Piazza Marina (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter).
Palermo in two days
In two days, you can start to savor Palermo and the best it has to offer.
On your first day, follow our “Palermo in one day” itinerary, earlier. On
your second day, start the morning with a visit to one of the historic
open-air markets — Il Capo, Ballarò, or La Vucciria (see “Finding more
cool things to see and do,” earlier in this chapter) — and then proceed
to the Galleria Regionale Siciliana. Afterward, admire the stuccowork
of Serpotta at the Casa Professa, and then get a glimpse of the mar-
velous Oratorio di Santa Cita. Spend the afternoon exploring Palermo’s
more ancient past at the Museo Archeologico Regionale. Finish your
day by taking in a performance at the Teatro Massimo, or cap off your
evening with some other form of entertainment (see “Living It Up After
Dark,” later).
Palermo in three days
Follow the suggested itinerary for “Palermo in two days,” earlier. On your
third day, begin by exploring the beautiful rooms of the Villa Malfitano
before proceeding on in the same direction toward La Zisa. After lunch,
take in some more architectural marvels, or perhaps have a little adven-
ture: Visit the Grand Hotel Villa Igiea and head for the beach.
Chapter 21: Palermo 467

Living It Up After Dark
Nightlife in Palermo is like everything else on the island: intense. Yet,
leisurely strolls take up a large share of locals’ evenings, and — as
Sicilians have a sweet tooth — you often see them chatting over a pastry
or an ice cream. The tourist office distributes the free Agenda, which
lists all the monthly events. Remember not to venture alone in deserted
streets at night: Palermo is not as safe as most of Italy.
For the performing arts, head to the splendid Teatro Massimo (Piazza
Verdi; % 800-655858; www.teatromassimo.it), which hosts concerts
and opera performances (tickets 9€–22€ for concerts, 9€–60€ for
ballet, and 13€–102€ for opera). The season runs from October through
June. Teatro Politeama Garibaldi (Piazza Ruggero Settimo; % 091-
6053315), stages opera and ballet. Tickets are reasonably priced at
about 20€ to 50€ ($32–$80).
We love the traditional Teatro dei Pupi, a typically Sicilian puppet 
theater. The pupi — dressed in armor and bright-colored fabrics — tell
tales of Orlando and the Paladins of France and stage fights against the
Saracens, in which the audience actively participates. This traditional
art is slowly disappearing, and out of the ten companies that were pres-
ent in Palermo a couple of decades ago, only a few still perform today.
The best is the Teatro Arte Cuticchio — Opera dei Pupi e Laboratorio
(Via Bara all’Olivella 95; % 091-323400; www.figlidartecuticchio.
com), performing November through June. Tickets cost 6€ ($9.60) for
adults and 3€ ($4.80) for children; the theater also contains a museum
with a collection of pupi, machines, and special effects.
If you enjoy jazz, don’t miss Lo Spasimo-Blue Brass (Via Spasimo, off
Piazza Magione; % 091-6161486; www.thebrassgroup.it), housed in
the beautiful old church, Santa Maria dello Spasimo: It’s the temple of
jazz in Palermo.
To join the crowds for aperitivo or luscious desserts, try Antico Caffè
Spinnato (Via Principe di Belmonte 115; % 091-583231; Open: Daily 
7 a.m.–1 a.m.), one of Palermo’s most historic cafes — or go for drinks,
pastries, and splendid ice cream at the newcomer Caffè Mazzara (Via
Generale Vincenzo Magliocco; % 091-321443; Open: Daily 7:30 a.m.–
11 p.m.); it’s only about a century old.
You find more modern-minded crowds at I Candelai (Via Candelai 65; 
% 091-327151; www.candelai.it), a club for the young and energetic
that stages live concerts and DJ dancing — often the latest rock — and a
variety of other events. Quieter and also popular is the well-established
Kandinsky (Discesa Tonnara 4; % 091-6376511).
One of the best pubs, Villa Niscemi (Piazza Niscemi 55; % 091-6880820),
has music of various kinds, including, literally, pickup groups (instru-
ments provided), and stays open into the wee hours. Pub 88 (Via Candelai
Part VII: Sicily 
468

88; % 091-611-9967), just down the road from I Candelai, is a quieter
place to have a drink and relax. At Agricantus (Via XX Settembre 82; 
% 091-487117), you may find jazz playing in the background or a group
performing a skit.
One of the few gay spots in town, Exit (Piazza San Francesco di Paola 40;
% 0348-781498), is also the best one. It has a great disco-cum-pub-cum-
cabaret.

Police
Call % 113.

Restrooms
Museums have public toilets. The best bet
for a restroom is to go to a nice-looking
cafe (though you have to buy something,
like a cup of coffee).
Safety
Palermo’s historic districts are safe except
for the pickpockets and purse-snatchers
on motorini. They concentrate in tourist
areas, on public transportation, and at
crowded open-air markets, such as the Il
Capo and the Vucciria; muggings are rare
but could occur in the most deserted
streets at night.
Smoking
In 2005, Italy passed a law outlawing
smoking in most public places. Smoking is
allowed only where there is a separate,
ventilated area for nonsmokers. If you
want to smoke at your table, call before-
hand to make sure the restaurant or cafe
you intend to visit offers a smoking area.
Taxes
See Chapter 5 for information on IVA
(Value Added Tax).
Taxis
Walk to one of the taxi stands in town —
Piazza Indipendenza, Piazza Verdi, Piazza
Castelnuovo, the modern harbor, or the
railroad station — or call a radio-taxi com-
pany (% 091-225455 or 091-513311) for
pickup.

Chapter 22
Taormina, Syracuse, 
and Agrigento
In This Chapter
 Touring Taormina
 Viewing the past and present in Syracuse
 Visiting the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento
S
icily is our favorite destination in all of Italy. Taormina — a town
that enjoys a fabulous position between the sea and the snow-
capped volcano Etna — is a popular resort; its Greco-Roman Theater is
one of the greatest in the world. Rivaling Athens for importance during
antiquity, Syracuse knew a second period of glory during the 17th and
18th centuries; both eras left their marks in the archaeological area and
baroque architectural jewel of Ortigia. Dominating the southern shore,
Agrigento was another important Greek city; said to have been one of
the most beautiful of the ancient world, it is still graced by one of the
most imposing complexes of temples. Other attractions are the city of
Catania, the top of the volcano, and the ruins of Segesta, Selinunte, and
Villa Armerina.
You should plan to spend at least three nights here. Both Taormina and
Palermo (see Chapter 21) make an excellent base for visiting the rest of
the island.
Taormina
On Sicily’s eastern shore, south of Messina, Taormina was built on a
breathtakingly beautiful site, overlooking the sea with nearby volcano
Mount Etna smoldering in the background. A small town of about 10,000
residents, Taormina receives some 900,000 visitors per year — that’s
about 2,500 visitors a day — counting only those who stay overnight;
many others just pass through for the day. You may find it odd that this
was a haunt of Greta Garbo, who “wanted to be alone,” but crowded as it
may be, Taormina’s unique charm remains untouched, especially in the
off season.

Taormina makes an excellent base for visiting the rest of the region;
many travel agencies based here offer guided tours to other destinations
in Sicily (see “Exploring Taormina,” later in this section).
Getting there
Taormina is 50km (30 miles) north of Catania (see later in this chapter),
50km (30 miles) south of Messina, and 250km (150 miles) east of
Palermo. It is served by both road and train. If you are coming by air or
ferry, you must first get to Palermo (see Chapter 21), or Catania (see
below), which both are excellent transfer points for the mainland and
other destinations in Europe and the Mediterranean. If you are traveling
by car, train, and ferry from the mainland, Messina is the logical point
of arrival.
Catania’s airport, Fontanarossa (airport code CTA; % 800-605656 in
Italy; www.aeroporto.catania.it), is only 4km (21⁄2 miles) south of
Catania town. Efficient and compact, the airport is well organized with a
bank and ATM, currency-exchange booth, and tourist information desk
in the arrivals concourse. Public transportation includes taxi service 
(% 095-330966), helicopter service from Elios (% 095-281404) and
Mediterranean (% 095-281404), and bus service to most destinations
in Sicily. The electric shuttle Alibus (% 800-018696) makes runs to
Catania town (including the harbor and railroad station) every 20 min-
utes from 5 a.m. to midnight, and Etna Trasporti (% 095-532716; www.
etnatrasporti.it) offers direct connections to Taormina; the ride is
about 75 minutes (see “Getting There” for other destinations in this
chapter and Chapter 21).
Catania’s harbor (% 095-535888) is served by TTT Lines (% 800-915365
in Italy, or 081 5752192; www.tttlines.com), which offers daily overnight
ferry service from Naples for about 50€ to 170€ ($80–$272) per person,
and by Caronte & Tourist (% 800-627414 toll-free from within Italy, or
089 2582528; www.carontetourist.it), with ferries from Salerno; tickets
range from about 17€ to 150€ ($27–$240) per person for the eight-hour
trip. From the harbor you can take a taxi or a local bus to Catania’s train
station (Piazza Giovanni XXIII; % 095-532226) for the easy 50-minute train
ride to Taormina (see below), or board a bus operated by Etna Trasporti
(see above) or Interbus (see below).
Caronte & Tourist (see above) also offers regular ferry service from
Salerno to Messina. Once in the harbor (% 090-6013211; www.porto.
messina.it), you can walk the few hundred yards or take a taxi (% 090-
2934880 or 090-2936880) or local bus to Messina’s train station Messina
Centrale (Via Torino 1; % 090-693246) for the 40-minute train ride 
to Taormina (see below); or board a bus from the company Interbus
(% 0935-503141) directly to Taormina.
Trains (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) arrive at Taormina-Giardini
(Via Nazionale; % 0942-51030); the station is down the hill from the

historic district. From there, you can take a taxi (% 0942-51150) or the
electric shuttle to the historic district.
By car, Taormina lies off the autostrada A18, which connects Catania to
Messina. From Palermo, take the A19 to Catania, where you pick up A18.
From the mainland, you need to board a ferry at Villa San Giovanni, near
Reggio Calabria. Reserve a ticket in advance, particularly in the summer,
to avoid considerable delays; contact Caronte & Tourist Shipping
(% 800-627414 toll-free from within Italy, or 0965-793131; www.caronte
tourist.it). Taormina is pedestrian-only, so you have to leave your car
at one of the two parking lots (follow the blue signs marked “P” from the
highway exit for Taormina). Park Lumbi (% 0942-24345) is the larger, at
the north of town, while Park Porta Catania (% 0942-620196) is at the
south of town. Another parking lot is in the seaside resort of Mazzarò
(see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this section). The cost is
4€ ($6.40) per hour and 18€ ($29) for 24 hours. Public transport (see
below) connects the parking lots to town. If you’re spending the night in
Taormina, ask if your hotel has parking; if not, request the stamped form
entitling you to a 40 percent discount on the parking cost.
Getting around
Taormina’s public transportation (ASMT; % 0942-23605; www.taormina
servizipubblici.it) includes frequent shuttle buses connecting the
parking lots and the outskirts with the heart of town, and the funivia
(funicular or cable car; Via Pirandello; % 0942-23906) connecting the

Dining locally
This lively resort caters to a variety of tastes with its plentiful restau-
rants. They are particularly easy to spot during warm weather, when
tables overflow onto outdoor terraces and sidewalks. Many hotels have
excellent restaurants that are open to the public: Il Dito e la Luna, in the
Grand Hotel Timeo, and Bougainvillées, at the San Domenico Palace
Chapter 22: Taormina, Syracuse, and Agrigento 475

(see “Spending the Night” earlier in this chapter), both serve fine food in
superb settings that include terraces with breathtaking views. For a nice
picnic, La Torinese (Corso Umberto 59; % 0942-23321) has mouthwa-
tering Sicilian specialties and a selection of some of the best products
from the rest of Italy: We never leave without at least a jar of their exqui-
site Sicilian pesto.

ingredients and traditions, exemplified by the tonno sott’olio fatto in casa
(home-preserved tuna in olive oil), zuppa di ceci (chickpea soup), pasta
ca’ nocca (pasta with anchovies, fried bread crumbs, and wild fennel), bra-
ciole di pesce spada alla messinese (swordfish steaks, Messina style), and

The best restaurant in Taormina, Casa Grugno’s elegant décor and pleas-
ant garden terrace are the perfect backdrop for showcasing the master-
fully prepared seasonal dishes made with the highest-quality ingredients.
If it’s on the menu, order the Marsala-flavored seafood bisque; although
the fusilli with lemon, fresh anchovies, capers, bread crumbs, and parsley,
or the jumbo shrimp over crispy pasta with citrus sauce are mouthwater-
ing alternatives. As a second course, the house-smoked fish with a mango,
citron, and ginger relish is definitely a winner.

Taormina’s “ideal vista”
In the fifth century B.C. Greek colonists founded Naxos (today the seaside resort of
Giardini Naxos), on the shore below Mount Taurus — the mountain giving its name to
Taormina — but the town was completely destroyed by Dionysius I, the ruler of com-
peting city-state Syracuse. In 358 B.C., Andromachus decided to rebuild over the dra-
matic cliff overlooking the sea, and founded Taormina at its present location. The
residents thought it prudent to move to the top of the cliffs, but that didn’t save them
from further invasions. They certainly had a keen eye for the most picturesque loca-
tion, though, and had become able politicians: The Greek city-state backed the Romans
in the Punic Wars, who in return protected them from Syracuse. This resulted in a glo-
rious period that stretched from the third century B.C. to the end of the Roman Empire;
Taormina thrived and received the coveted status of Roman colony under Augustus.
After the empire fell, Taormina lost its protection: It was twice laid waste by the Arabs,
until Roger II took over the city in 1078 for the Normans. After the Middle Ages,
Taormina sank into obscurity for several hundred years. It remained a forgotten
medieval village until the end of the 18th century, when European artists, such as the
German writer Goethe, began to celebrate it as the “ideal vista.” Taormina’s unique
panorama, with the sea on one side and snow-capped Etna on the other, started
attracting visitors and still appeals to the wealthy and glamorous today.

as well as to the top attractions on rest of the island, including Palermo
(see Chapter 21), Syracuse, Agrigento, and Piazza Armerina (see later in
this chapter). SAT Sicilian Airbus Travel (Corso Umberto 73; % 0942-
24653; www.sat-group.it) offers a similar array of tours, including a
nice bus-and-jeep sunset tour of Mount Etna, which we particularly recom-
mend. CST (Corso Umberto 101; % 0942-626088; www.compagnia
sicilianaturismo.it) organizes guided tours to all major sights in
Sicily, departing from both Taormina and Catania. Expect to pay between
35€ and 60€ ($56–$96) per person for a half- or full-day tour.
The top attractions
The medieval center of town is best enjoyed early in the morning or in
the off season, when its streets are less crowded and noisy with happy
visitors. If you feel overwhelmed by the hordes, just step into the side
streets, lined with many magnificent villas owned by famous residents
past and present.
Corso Umberto I
Taormina’s central street stretches between Porta Catania and Porta
Messina; these were the town’s gates in Greek and Roman times. In
medieval times, the town shrunk so much that they built another gate —
the Torre dell’Orologio (Clock Tower), also appropriately called Porta di
Mezzo (Middle Gate) — and abandoned Porta Messina. During the
Renaissance, the town began expanding again, but it reoccupied the whole
hourglass-shaped area of the Greek city only in modern times. The clock
tower of the middle gate was rebuilt and attached to the Chiesa di San
Giorgio in the 17th century, in a baroque remake.
Not far from Porta Catania is Palazzo dei Duchi di Santo Stefano, the best
preserved of the town’s Norman buildings, and one of the most splendid;
today it houses the Mazzullo Foundation (Vico De Spuches 3; % 0942-
620129; open on occasion of exhibits and events) and several works of
this local sculptor are on exhibit. Further along is Chiesa di Sant’Agostino,
a 16th-century church (closed to worship and used as the town library)
that opens onto a nice square, Largo IX Aprile, affording a great view over
the sea. Nearby Santa Caterina was created in the 16th century using the
ruins of the Roman theater — the Odeon — the rest of which can be seen
behind the church; the Odeon itself had been built incorporating parts of
a preexisting Greek temple, of which some columns are still visible.
Opposite the church is Palazzo Corvaja, one of the most interesting in
town. Built between the 12th and 15th centuries around a preexisting Arab
cubic tower — probably part of a fortress — in several additions, it has a
crenellated structure and beautiful entrance staircase from the 12th cen-
tury, plus a 15th-century wing (to the right) where the Sicilian Parliament
met. Today, it houses the Ethno-Anthropological Museum (% 0942-
610274; Admission: 2.50€/$4; Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 4–8 p.m.)
and the tourist office (see “Information” under “Fast Facts: Taormina,” later
in this chapter).
Part VII: Sicily 
478

Duomo
Built in the 12th century and dedicated to St. Nicola, this is a classic church
with a Latin cross plan. It was later remodeled, and the central portal dates
to 1633, while the lateral portals date to the 15th and 16th centuries, respec-
tively. Inside, the nave is defined by gracious monolithic pink-marble
columns topped by capitals decorated with a fish-scale pattern, recalling
Sicily’s maritime tradition. In front of the Duomo is the beautiful baroque
Fontana Monumentale, built in 1635 with two-legged female centaurs.
See map p. 473. Piazza del Duomo, just off Corso Umberto. % 0942-23123. Admission:
Free. Open: Daily for mass, usually early morning and early evening.
Greek-Roman Theater
With a seating capacity of 5,000 people, this theater is second in Sicily only
to Syracuse’s (see later in this chapter) in both size and importance. It’s
the best preserved of all Greek and Roman theaters in Italy. The backdrop
scene was a fixed structure: It represented a two-story house, part of
which is still visible. Following the destiny of so many buildings of antiq-
uity, part of the theater’s materials were taken to construct other build-
ings, in this case by the Arabs and Normans, leaving modern-day visitors
to imagine what it once looked like during its glory days when the walls of
the theater were covered with marble and decorated with frescoes (only
a portion remains). Carved out of the rocky cliff by the Greeks, the theater
was modified by the Romans for gladiator battles: They built a tunnel con-
necting the rooms under the arena with the outside, and enlarged the
orchestra, closing it off with a high podium in order to protect spectators.
Today, the theater is famous for the performances held during Taormina
Arte (see later in this chapter).
See map p. 473. Via del Teatro Greco. % 0942-23220. Admission: 4.50€ ($7.20). Open:
Daily Apr–Sept 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; Oct–Mar 9 a.m.–4 p.m.
Public Gardens
These gardens were built by Miss Florence Trevelyan, who arrived in 1882,
fell in love with the town, and bought a piece of land sloping toward the
sea. She worked at transforming the land, training and employing local
workers as gardeners. Within the gardens, she designed and built the
Victorian Follies — bizarre toy houses built with red bricks and light-
colored stone containing inlaid archaeological materials. Locals were fond
of her, and when she died in 1902, they showered flowers upon her funeral
procession. Her will forbade her heirs from ever building on or industrially
cultivating the land.

Daily sunrise to sunset.

2.50€/$4; Open: Daily 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 4–8 p.m.), in the elegant
Chapter 22: Taormina, Syracuse, and Agrigento 479

Palazzo della Badia Vecchia — a beautiful example of Sicilian
Gothic. Its collection of artifacts was excavated during the 19th
century in and around Taormina. Dated to the second century A.D.,
a statue of a priestess from the cult of Isis was found under the
church of San Pancrazio.
 A popular excursion from Taormina is to the nearby volcano Etna,
which dominates the area and is Europe’s biggest and most active
volcano (the last eruptions were in 2001 and 2003); at 3,300m
(10,824 ft.) tall, it is still growing. Its last major eruption, in 1669,
took out chunks of the not-so-close-by town of Catania (amazingly,
the lava flow deposits by the side of the highway south of town
look as if they were made yesterday), but also extended the coast-
line about a kilometer (more than half a mile) into the sea. A soar-
ing conifer forest covers Etna’s north slopes and provides some
good skiing in the winter. The easiest way to visit is via organized
tour from Taormina (see the beginning of this section, p. 477). By
car, follow the signs for Linguaglossa, Zafferana; proceed up the
winding road to Rifugio Sapienza, where you find the cable car 
to the summit. An authorized guide from Guide Alpine Etna Sud
(% 095-7914755) can take you for a closer look at the craters —
though you’ll still be at a safe distance.
 Outdoor enthusiasts will love the Gole dell’Alcantara (% 0942-
989911; www.parcoalcantara.it; Admission: 2.50€/$4; Open:
Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.), a series of picturesque gorges, rapids, and falls
created by a fast torrent, formally protected as a natural park since
2001. Its waters are incredibly cold — a unique phenomenon — and
you need appropriate clothing (in summer, at least a bathing suit,
towel, and aqua socks). You can get here by guided tour (see the
beginning of this section, p. 477), by car (off SS185, about 18km/
11 miles from Taormina), or by bus from Taormina — Interbus
(% 0942-625301) leaves at 9:30 a.m., returns at 2:30 p.m., and
charges 5€ ($8) round-trip. From the parking lot, an elevator takes
you part of the way, and from May through September, you can
climb the rest of the way (partly walking in the frigid waters).
 Below Taormina is the seaside resort of Mazzarò, with its small (and
pebbly) but pretty beaches and seafood restaurants — the latter
being what most locals come for. By Mazzarò, at the center of a pic-
turesque bay, is Isola Bella, a small island dotted with marine grot-
toes and a protected WWF nature refuge. It’s so close to the shore
that you might be tempted to swim to it from the beach, but we rec-
ommend hiring a boat from Mazzarò and cruising around it. Guided
tours are offered by Italia Riserva Isola Bella (reservations required;
Via San Pancrazio 25, Taormina; % 0942-628388; Mon, Wed, Fri, and
Sun 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m.). You can reach Mazzarò via the cable car
from the center of Taormina (see “Getting around,” earlier).
 Piazza Armerina’s well-preserved Villa Romana del Casale
(% 0935-680036; www.villaromanadelcasale.it; Admission:
6€/$9.60; Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.) was discovered by accident
Part VII: Sicily 
480

and excavated starting in the 1950s — and more findings continue
to be unearthed in ongoing digs. Once a wealthy hunting lodge and
abandoned before the Middle Ages, the villa has come to us basi-
cally unchanged since ancient Roman times: Though its roof and
part of the walls have collapsed, its splendid floors are untouched
and it hides a treasure trove of mosaics. You can come by guided
tour (see the beginning of this section, p. 477); or drive from
Taormina or Catania (take the A19, exiting at ENNA, and following
signs for PIAZZA ARMERINA; the archaeological area is 3km/2 miles
south of town). A free shuttle bus leaves every hour from Piazza
Senator Mareschi in the village of Villa Armerina.
Living it up after dark
You won’t have a shortage of things to do with your evenings in this
lively summer resort.
One major attraction is the rich program of events staged at the Greco-
Roman Theater by Taormina Arte (Via Pirandello 31; % 0942-21142;
Fax: 0942-23348; www.taormina-arte.com). This summer festival
includes cinema, theater, music, ballet, and video, and has garnered
international acclaim since its inception in 1983. Note: Be sure to
reserve well in advance for the major shows.
The best bars, pubs, and clubs in Taormina tend to be more elegant,
such as the cafes lining Piazza IX Aprile, where you can sip a drink or a
granita. La Giara (Vico La Floresta 1; % 0942-23360) is a trendy piano
bar with restaurant, and the pub Re di Bastoni (Corso Umberto 120; 
% 0942-23037; www.redibastoni.it) is more relaxed. Other good
choices are the Morgana Bar (Scesa Morgana 4; no telephone), and
Septimo (Via San Pancrazio 50; % 0942-625522). Down by the beach in
Mazzarò, bars are usually more casual. We like Panasia Beach (Via
Nazionale Spisone; % 0942-23170) a beach club cum restaurant that
serves evening cocktails at sofas right on the sand.

Catania
Often bypassed by visitors, Catania is the second-largest town in Sicily after Palermo.
Centered on an important harbor, it hides a baroque heart that rewards those who
brave its belt of industrial — and quite ugly — developments. The historic district is
an apotheosis of baroque buildings, as the town was completely rebuilt after the earth-
quake of 1693. The most famous attraction in town is the Duomo (Piazza Duomo; 
% 095-320044; Admission: Free; Open: Daily 7 a.m. to noon and 4:30–7 p.m.), Catania’s
cathedral. Named for St. Agata, it is richly decorated with paintings and carvings.
From Piazza Duomo and crossing the heart of the historic district, Via Etnea is lined
with ornate buildings; follow it down to the Giardini Bellini (Piazza Roma), the beau-
tiful public gardens named after the local opera composer Vincenzo Bellini (composer
of Norma, among others) — a destination favored by locals, and one of the nicest gar-
dens in Europe. Also worth a visit are the Greek theater and the Roman ruins, includ-
ing the thermal baths and the forum.
The town is well linked (see “Getting there” under Taormina, p. 472), with a good air-
port, a lively harbor (% 095-535888), a train station (Piazza Giovanni XXIII; % 095-
532226; for train information call % 892021 or check www.trenitalia.it), and
bus service from most towns in Sicily.
You can eat very well at Ambasciata del Mare (Piazza Duomo 6; % 095-341003; www.
ambasciatadelmare.com; Open: Tues–Sun 12:30–3 p.m. and 7:30–11 p.m.), and
even better at the Osteria I tre Bicchieri (Via San Giuseppe al Duomo 31; % 095-
7153540; www.osteriaitrebicchieri.it; Open: Mon–Sat 7:30–11 p.m.), both

miss the historical Friggitoria Stella (Via Ventimiglia 66; % 095-535002; Open: 
10:30 a.m.–1 p.m. and 5:30–9:30 p.m.; deep-fried specialties prepared only in the 

Syracuse
Close to Sicily’s southeastern tip, Syracuse shimmers somewhat sleepily
by the sea. Its attractions range from an impressive ancient Greek thea-
ter to the island of Ortigia, the town’s baroque historic district. Staying
overnight will allow you to see most of the local attractions, squeezing in
a short visit to the nearby village of Noto, a baroque jewel.
Getting there
Syracuse is easily reached from Catania, only 63km (39 miles) to the north
(see the “Getting there” section in “Taormina,” earlier in this chapter), and
is served by guided tours from Taormina and Palermo (see p. 477 and
466). Interbus (% 0935-565111; www.interbus.it) offers regular bus
service to Syracuse from Catania and its airport (a 70-minute ride), and
from Palermo (a three-and-a-half-hour ride). Trains (% 892021; www.
trenitalia.it) arrive at Syracuse’s train station (% 0931-69722), 
on the west side of town midway between its main attractions. It is a 
20-minute walk to either Ortigia or the Archaeological Zone, but you find
taxis outside as well as local buses. For radio-taxi pickup, call % 0931-
69722.
If you’re coming by car, beware of the dangerous 21km (13-mile) stretch
on SS114 (also labeled E14 on European maps) between Catania and
Syracuse, where the road reduces to two lanes. Much too narrow for the
amount of traffic on it, it turns into a hair-raising, and potentially deadly,
experience, with locals speeding fiercely. State road SS115 from
Agrigento is picturesque, but a long haul.

with fresh ricotta or anchovies), delicious arancini (rice balls), true Sicilian pizza (a
sort of deep-fried calzone filled with anchovies and cheese), and scacciate (baked
pizza dough stuffed with greens and cheese). Bar Ernesto (Viale Ruggero Di Lauria 91,

cheese), and a delicious granita al pistacchio (pistachio slushie).

You find many small restaurants tucked away, but don’t expect a scene

Exploring Syracuse
The main attractions of Syracuse lie at some distance from one another:
At one end of town is the archaeological area with the Greek and Roman
ruins, while by the sea is the island of Ortigia. It’s about a 40-minute walk
between the two, and you might want to take the bus or, easier still, a
taxi (see “Fast Facts: Syracuse,” later in this chapter).

of Siracusa, they also organize excursions to Noto, gourmet tours of
local cuisine, and bicycles, scooters, and boat rentals.
The top attractions
Archaeological Area of the Neapolis (Parco Archeologico 
della Neapolis)
On the western edge of modern Syracuse lies the Neapolis (“new town” in
Greek, as opposed to the old settlement of Ortigia). Created at the height
of Syracuse’s glory, it was practically abandoned during the town’s decline
in Roman times; thus its ruins are well preserved. The archaeological area
is large, covering about 240,000 sq. m (2.6 million sq. ft.) and encompass-
ing two theaters and the quarries from which stone was excavated to build
all the monuments in the old town.
Wear comfortable shoes and beware of the sun in the hot months — 
walking around the ruins at high noon can quickly exhaust and dehydrate
you — bring enough water and wear a hat.
The area also includes a necropolis and other assorted ruins. If you have
limited time, head for the Greek Theater. Carved out of the hillside, it is
very well preserved and an impressive site. The tunnels visible in the stage
area were dug later by the Romans to use for animal and gladiator fights.
The theater is particularly magical in summer evenings when classical
plays are staged here as they were 2,500 years ago. Contact the Italian
Institute of Ancient Drama (INDA, Corso G. Matteotti 29, Siracusa; % 800-

Siracusa
When the Corinthians founded Syracuse in the eighth century B.C., they established
their first settlement by the island of Ortigia, home to the mythical nymph Calypso, who
kept Odysseus captive for seven years. The city-state flourished around its beautiful
harbor, perfectly positioned for trade. It rapidly gained increasing control over 
the eastern and western Mediterranean, to the point of rivaling the great cities of 
the mother country, and particularly Athens. Syracuse rose to become the
Mediterranean’s greatest power under its forceful tyrants (particularly Dionysius I).
However, during the Punic Wars, Syracuse was caught between a rock and a hard
place — the Romans and the Carthaginians. The Roman siege lasted two years, and
in 215 B.C. they finally overwhelmed Syracuse, despite the clever devices that
Archimedes, the city’s most famous son, constructed to thwart them and their siege
engines. Archimedes died in the Roman siege, and Syracuse wound up on the losing
side. It lost all its importance at that point and never recovered.

to the end of June. You can purchase tickets online (they start at 30€/$48)
from Hello Ticket (% 06-48078400; www.helloticket.it).
The other truly interesting site is the Latomia del Paradiso, on the oppo-
site side of the hill; it is the largest of the stone quarries that served the
city. Once covered (the Greeks quarried underground), its roof collapsed
in the 1693 earthquake, leaving an acres-wide hole and a few stone pillars.
Adjacent are the Grotta dei Cordari, a quarry used in later centuries for
rope making, and the Orecchio di Dionisio (Dionysius’s Ear), a deep, very
tall, pitch-black cave with unique acoustics (try tearing up a piece of
paper). The story that the tyrant Dionysius used the cave to eavesdrop on
conversations is a myth probably initiated by the painter Caravaggio when
he visited the area.
Viale Paradiso. % 0931-66206. Bus: 4, 5, or 6 to Parco Archeologico. Admission: 6€
($9.60). Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m. to sunset (last admission 2 hours earlier).
Ortigia
Today connected to the mainland by a bridge — Ponte Nuovo — this
island in the heart of Syracuse’s harbor is where the city began back in the
eighth century B.C. With its Greek ruins and baroque palazzi, it is the heart
of the historic district. Actually, one could say that it is the historic dis-
trict, since, until the end of the 19th century, Ortigia was still all there was
of Syracuse; the mainland area contained only the rail station and the
Greek ruins.
As you cross the Ponte Nuovo, you will first see the remains of the Temple
of Apollo, built in the sixth century B.C., reduced now to just a few
columns. Walk up Via Savoia to Porta Marina (Seaside Gate) and enter the
old town. If you proceed along the stone border of the harbor, you find the
romantic Fonte Aretusa: This — according to the myth — is the very
spring into which the nymph Arethusa was turned in order to escape the
fiery advances of Alfeo, the marine god who was trying to seduce her. He
then turned into a river so their waters could mingle together. Famous
since antiquity for its almost magical qualities, this spring — separated
from the sea only by a stone wall — is rich in freshwater fish.
Head back to the center of Ortigia to admire the seventh-century Duomo
(Piazza del Duomo; % 0931-65328; Admission: Free; Open: Daily 8 a.m. to
noon and 4–7 p.m.), built on the remains of the Greek temple to Athena
(Minerva to the Romans). You can still see 12 of the temple’s columns
incorporated into the church structure. Farther to the southeast, you find
beautiful Piazza Archimede, the heart of Ortigia, graced by a stately
baroque fountain. Nearby is the splendid Palazzo Bellomo, which houses
the Galleria Regionale (Via Capodieci 14; % 0931-69511; Admission:
3€/$4.80; Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–2 p.m., Thurs–Sat also 3:30–7 p.m., Sun
and holidays 9 a.m.–1 p.m.). Built in the 13th century and remodeled in the
15th, this elegant palazzo holds a large collection of Sicilian figurative art
stretching from the Byzantine period to the 18th century. The most impor-
tant piece is Antonello da Messina’s famous Annunciation. (Note that the
palazzo was still closed for restoration at press time, but is scheduled 
to reopen imminently.) At the tip of the island is the Castello Maniace

an extensive Hellenistic collection from Syracuse’s heyday. The single most
famous piece is the second-century-B.C. Venus Anadyomene, which —
though headless — powerfully evokes the birth of the goddess from the
sea. The pre-Greek vases are lovely, too.

The land of Greek temples
Those who like to explore ancient ruins will be delighted by the gorgeous sites of
Segesta and Selinunte. Selinunte lies 122km (76 miles) southwest of Palermo and
113km (70 miles) west of Agrigento. Once a prosperous Greek colony established by
Syracusans, it was destroyed by Hannibal in 409 B.C. The archaeological area
(Admission: 4.50€/$7.20; Open: Daily 9 a.m. to sunset) feels like a dinosaur cemetery,
with the huge stone structures of the once splendid acropolis lying on the ground,
scattered here and there. Part of temple C was re-erected in 1925. The easiest way to
visit is by guided tour from Palermo (see Chapter 21) or by car, but you can also get
here by public transportation: Take a train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) from
Palermo to Castelvetrano, and then switch to a bus operated by Autoservizi Salemi
(% 0923-981120) to get to Selinunte.
The temple in Segesta — one of the best preserved Greek temples in the world — is
still standing all alone in a field on a hill. The archaeological site (% 0924-952356;
Admission: 4€/$6.40; Open: Daily 9 a.m. to sunset; last entrance one hour earlier) is
only 74km (46 miles) southwest of Palermo and is easily reached by train (% 892021;
www.trenitalia.it) — the train station is 1km (2⁄3 mile) away — or by guided tour
from Palermo (see Chapter 21). Up nearby Mount Barbaro lies the ancient Greek thea-
ter, which comes alive in summer with modern and classic plays. The season gener-
ally lasts from late July to early September, and a free shuttle bus from the train station
is made available. Check with the tourist office for a schedule of events.

remodeled by the Byzantines. Amidst the ruins of the ancient Greek
fortifications, you can still make out the five powerful towers that
dominated the structure. By car, take SS115 and follow signs for
Belvedere; the castle is 7km (41⁄2 miles) from Ortigia.
 In summer, Syracuse is boiling hot. To cool off, head for the beach,
like the locals do. Arenella is the closest (only about 8km/5 miles
south of the historic district), but Fontane Bianche (19km/12 miles
away in the same direction) is the best. You can easily get there by
public transportation (bus no. 23 from Riva della Posta). If you’re
driving, take SS115 and follow the signs.
 The famous town of Noto is only 32km (20 miles) southwest of
Syracuse off autostrada A18, a 50-minute ride from the historic dis-
trict of Syracuse by car, guided tour (see earlier in this chapter), or

it). Noto (not Siracusa)was the administrative capital of the area,
and when the town was reduced to rubble by the 1693 earthquake,
the local notables decided to rebuild a completely new town 16km
(10 miles) south of its original location. No expenses were spared,
and the result was a marvel of Sicilian baroque style. Many impor-
tant Sicilian artists contributed to the reconstruction, and the
whole town is considered a work of art. Carvings of grotesque 
animals and figures support the balconies of the golden-yellow
buildings. The town underwent a restoration that started in 1997,
leaving it more beautiful than ever. Theatre Vittorio Emanuele,

Agrigento and the Valley of the Temples
Founded by the Greeks in 581 B.C., Agrigento dominated Sicily’s southern
shore. Considered one of the most beautiful of the ancient world, it was
deeply admired by the Greek poet Pindar among many others. Agrigento
reached great heights in art and culture in the third century B.C., but 
saw its fortunes wax and wane with those of the Roman Empire. Its
Valley of the Temples is one of the most dramatic classical sites in the
Mediterranean: A high plateau overlooking the sea holds the most
impressive Greek ruins in existence outside Greece, and is reason
enough to come to Sicily. Farther up the hill from the ruins stands
modern Agrigento, a small town that most visitors bypass.
Getting there
Several companies offer day tours of Agrigento from Palermo and
Taormina (see Chapter 21 and earlier in this chapter), but you can easily
get there on your own. By air, the closest airport is Palermo (see
Chapter 21), connected to Agrigento by buses run by Licata (% 0922-
401360). You can fly to Catania, connecting to Agrigento via bus service
by SAIS Trasporti (% 095-536168; www.saistrasporti.it).
Trains (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) arrive at Agrigento rail sta-
tion, on Piazza Guglielmo Marconi (% 0922-725669); the trip from
Palermo takes one and a half hours and costs about 7€ ($11). Agrigento
is also connected via bus to each major town in Sicily; AST (% 800-
234163 in Italy, or 091-6882906) and Omnia (% 0922-596490) serve
Agrigento from Palermo. The Valley of the Temples is 3km (2 miles)
south of Agrigento; a shuttle-bus service connects the archaeological
area with Agrigento’s train station, where you find taxis (see “Fast Facts:
Agrigento,” later in this chapter).
Agrigento is 126km (79 miles) south of Palermo. By car, avoid the narrow
SS121/189, opting for the faster and safer autostrada A19 to Caltanissetta
where you switch to road SS640 (follow signs to Agrigento) for the remain-
ing 60km (37 miles).

whole valley is graced by the almond trees in blossom. Folklore groups
from around the whole island, as well as from other places in Italy and
Europe, meet in town for a rich series of shows and concerts. Check with
the local tourist office (% 0922-20454) for a calendar of events.
The top attractions
Valley of the Temples
The archaeological area is vast and has very few trees. Bring comfortable
shoes and, if you’re visiting in high season, a hat, sunscreen, and a mini-
mum of a quart of water per person. Packing a picnic lunch to enjoy by
the ruins is also a good idea. The valley is at its most dramatic at sunrise
or sunset (when the temperature is also cooler). You will need two to three
hours for your visit.
Entering the archaeological area from the Porta Aurea (a gate in the Greek
walls), you find the three best-preserved temples — Hercules, Concord,
and Juno — to your right, while the Temple of Jupiter and the Temple of
Castor and Pollux are by the river on your left.
If you have limited time, head straight for the Temple of Hercules.
Hercules was highly revered in Sicily — particularly in Agrigento (the god
of strength, he was thought to free people from nightmares and unwanted
erotic stimuli) — and his temple was massive, occupying an area of about
2,043 sq. m (22,000 sq. ft.). Nine columns are still standing, thanks to the
generosity of the English Captain Hardcastle, who paid for their restoration
in the 1920s. The temple was richly decorated with reliefs and sculptures;
the columns were painted white to simulate marble, whereas the cornice
was decorated in red, blue, and turquoise. You can then proceed to the
Temple of Concord. It was transformed into a church as far back as A.D.
597 by opening 12 arches into the walls of the temple, and enclosing the
space between the columns to make the naves. These alterations were
reversed in 1743, when the temple was declared a national monument and
restored. Built around 430 B.C., it’s one of the best-preserved temples of
this period, along with the one of Hera in Paestum (see Chapter 20) and the
Theseion in Athens. The Temple of Juno is on a pretty hill, near one of the
few trees on this side of the archaeological area. Built in 450 to 440 B.C. in
honor of Juno (Hera) — the mother goddess of marriage and fertility — it
has 34 columns and a maximum height of 15m (50 ft.).

Agrigento and the Valley of the Temples
Chapter 22: Taormina, Syracuse, and Agrigento 493
The other side of the archeological area requires more of your imagina-
tion to appreciate the ruins. Besides the four remaining standing columns
of the Temple of Castor and Pollux, and the few remains of the Temple 
of Vulcano, you find the massive ruins of the Temple of Jupiter. Built to
celebrate the people of Agrigento’s gratitude for their victory over the
Carthaginians at Himera in 479 B.C., this was one of the largest temples of
antiquity, covering approximately 6,317 sq. m (68,000 sq. ft.) at a height of
32m (108 ft.). Each of the columns rose 26m (55 ft.) and measured 4.1m (14
ft.) at the base; they were probably alternated with Telamones (or Atlases,
human figures supporting a structure), of which a whole one lies flat on
the ground. A better preserved Telamon is in the Regional Archaeological
Museum (off Via dei Templi, Contrada San Nicola, outskirts of Agrigento;
% 0922-401111; Admission: 4.50€/$7.20; Open: Tues–Sat 9 a.m.–7:30 p.m.,
Sun–Mon 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m.) along with a collection of Greek antiquities. Near
the museum is the 12th-century church of San Nicola (Admission: Free;
Open: Daily 8 a.m.–1 p.m.); at the center of the second chapel is the famous
third-century Sarcofago di Fedra, one of the most gracious examples of

 The village of Kaos, to the southeast of Agrigento, is the birthplace
of the famous Italian writer Luigi Pirandello (1867–1936; he won the
Nobel Prize for literature in 1934). A visit to his home, Casa Natale
di Pirandello (% 0922-511102; Admission: 2€/$3.20; Open: Daily 
8 a.m.–8 p.m.; last entrance one hour before sunset), can be quite
inspiring. The walk takes you to the solitary pine tree where the
author’s ashes are buried.

Part VIII
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
n this part, we’ve included a few other things that will be
useful to you and help you have the splendid vacation you
deserve.
Think you can’t possibly make do in Italy knowing only ten
Italian words? Believe it or not, you can — and in Chapter 23,
we give you ten key words to help you converse with the
natives. In Chapter 24, we tell you about ten Italian artists,
perhaps the greatest ones of all, and certainly some whose
work you will encounter over and over during your visit.

Non Capisco: The Top 
Ten Expressions You 
Need to Know
In This Chapter
 Using salutations
 Asking questions
 Knowing lifesavers
T
raveling in a country where you don’t know the language can be
intimidating, but trying to speak the language can be amusing, at 
the very least. Local people often appreciate it if you at least make the
effort. And you find that Italian is a fun language to try to speak. If you’re
ready for more, check out Appendix B for a glossary of architectural and
menu terms.
Per Favore
Meaning “please,” per favore (pehr fah-voh-reh) is the most important
expression you can know. With it, you can make useful phrases such 
as “Un caffè, per favore” (“A coffee, please”) and “Il conto, per favore”
(“The bill, please”). There’s no need for verbs, and it’s perfectly polite!
Grazie
Grazie (grah-tsee-eh) means “thank you”; if you want to go all out, use
grazie mille (mee-leh), meaning “a thousand thanks.” Say it clearly and
loudly enough to be heard. Saying grazie is always right and puts people
in a good mood. Grazie has other uses as well: Italians often use it as a
way to say goodbye or mark the end of an interaction. It’s particularly
useful when you don’t want to buy something from an insistent street
vendor: Say “Grazie,” and walk away.

Permesso
Meaning “excuse me” (to request passage or admittance), permesso
(pehr-mehs-soh) is of fundamental importance on public transportation.
When you’re in a crowded bus and need to get off, say loudly and
clearly, “Permesso!” and people will allow you to pass (or feel less irri-
tated as you squeeze your way through). The same thing applies in
supermarkets, trains, museums, and so on. Of course, you may be sur-
rounded by non-Italians, so the effect may be a little lost on them.
Scusi
Scusi (scoo-zee) means “excuse me” (to say you’re sorry after bumping
into someone) and is more exactly mi scusi, but the shortened form is
the one most people use. Again, it’s a most useful word in any crowded
situation. You note that Italians push their way through a narrow passage
with a long chain of “Scusi, permesso, mi scusi, grazie, permesso . . .” It’s
very funny to hear. Scusi has another important use: It’s the proper way
to attract somebody’s attention before asking a question. Say “Scusi?”
and the person will turn toward you in benevolent expectation. Then it’s
up to you.
Buon Giorno and Buona Sera
Buon giorno (bwon djor-no), meaning “good day,” and its sibling buona
sera (bwon-a sey-rah), meaning “good evening,” are of the utmost impor-
tance in Italian interactions. Italians always salute one another with
these expressions when entering or leaving a public place. Do the same,
saying it clearly when entering a store or restaurant. Occasionally, these
words can also be used as forms of goodbye.
Arrivederci
Arrivederci (ah-ree-vey-der-chee) is the appropriate way to say goodbye
in a formal occasion — in a shop, at a bar or restaurant, or to friends. If
you can say it properly, people will like it very much: Italians are aware
of the difficulties their language poses for foreigners.
You hear the word ciao (chow), the familiar word for goodbye, used
among friends (usually of the same age). Note that using the word ciao
with someone you don’t know is considered quite impolite!
Dov’è
Meaning “where is,” dov’è (doe-vay) is useful for asking for directions.
Because the verb is included, you just need to add the thing you’re 
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
498

looking for: “Dov’è il Colosseo?” (“Where is the Colosseum?”) or “Dov’è
la stazione?” (“Where is the train station?”).
Quanto Costa?
Meaning “How much does it cost?,” Quanto costa? (quahn-to koss-tah) is
of obvious use all around Italy, for buying anything from a train ticket to
a Murano glass chandelier.
Che Cos’è?
Meaning “What is it?,” Che cos’è? (kay koss-ay) will help you buy things,
particularly food, and know what you’re buying. But it could also be
useful in museums and other circumstances. But then the tricky part
begins: understanding the answer. If you don’t understand the answer,
you can get the person to repeat it by saying the next phrase on our list:
Non Capisco
Non capisco (nohn kah-pees-koh) means “I don’t understand.” There’s no
need to explain this one: Keep repeating it and Italians will try more and
more imaginative ways to explain things to you.

Chapter 24
Ten Great Italian Artists
In This Chapter
 Knowing who’s who
 Charting the careers of the masters
 Getting background on what you’ll be seeing
A
dmittedly, hundreds of books have been written about the great fig-
ures of Italian art, so any choice of ten figures is apt to be personal.
However, some artists would be on everybody’s list: Leonardo,
Michelangelo, Raffaello . . . This chapter is intended to give you some
background to attach to the names that you will encounter again and
again during your travels in Italy.
Giotto
Immortalized by Dante in the Divine Comedy, Giotto di Bondone (1266 or
1276–1337) was born in a village not far from Florence, and went on to
become an apprentice of the great painter Cimabue. He was famous in
his own time and in later centuries came to be known as the father of
modern painting. A practitioner of the Gothic style, he departed from
the serene but flat and static mode of Byzantine painting and the
somber, otherworldly beauty of medieval art. In works such as his mas-
terpiece, the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua (see Chapter 17), he depicted
human beings with a passion and emotion not seen since classical times,
and paved the way for the Renaissance in the following century.
Donatello
In a sense, Donatello (1386–1466) did for sculpture what Giotto did for
painting: pulled it out of the Middle Ages and gave it a new realism and
psychological accuracy. He developed a new technique, schiacciato,
which used flattened, shallow carving to make relief sculpture more pic-
torial and more like painting. Donatello executed works in marble,
bronze, and wood, and many of these pieces survive in his native
Florence, where he spent most of his long life. His crowning achievement
is probably the carvings for the sacristy in the Basilica di San Lorenzo;

the Bargello museum has two of his statues of David, one in bronze and
the other in marble (see Chapter 13).
Giovanni Bellini
Born to an artistic family (his father and brother were painters, and his
sister married Andrea Mantegna), Giovanni Bellini (1430–1516) began as
a painter of austere religious pictures in the late Gothic tradition. He
later developed one of the most recognizable styles and had a lasting
effect on Venetian painting. His masterpiece is reputed to have been the
large historical paintings he did for the hall of the Maggior Consiglio in
Venice, but these were destroyed by fire in 1577. However, his luminosity
and exquisite colors are fully on display in religious artworks (such as
his famous Madonnas) and other pieces preserved in the museums and
churches of Venice (see Chapter 16).
Leonardo da Vinci
Leonardo (1452–1519) grew up on his father’s estate in Vinci, a Tuscan
town under the rule of Florence. He was apprentice to the Florentine
painter Andrea del Verrocchio. Leonardo later left Florence for Milan,
where he spent 17 years. His genius for observation manifested itself in
portrayals of the human figure, such as the Mona Lisa, that were psycho-
logically real to the point of being uncanny, while also showing a revolu-
tionary sense of physicality, based on a profound grasp of anatomy. His
use of chiaroscuro (contrast between light and dark) influenced later
painters. Leonardo’s attention to nature led him to become a scientist,
engineer, and inventor as well. Leonardo’s life and work are perhaps the
most perfect expression of the spirit of the Renaissance. His Last Supper
in Milan (see Chapter 17), though much damaged, is a pilgrimage site for
art lovers.
Michelangelo
Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564), like Leonardo, was a great painter
but many other things as well, including an architect; St. Peter’s in Rome
(see Chapter 12) received its final form and its dome from him. This
architectural masterpiece also contains his painterly masterpiece, the
frescoes of the Cappella Sistina (Sistine Chapel), and his sculptural
masterpiece, the Pietà. A tempestuous genius, Michelangelo was often
embroiled in conflict. His patrons included Lorenzo de’ Medici and Pope
Julius II. Julius’s successor, Leo X, was actually a son of Lorenzo and
longtime friend of Michelangelo, and he employed the artist in the
Medici Chapels in Florence (see Chapter 13). His use of color and monu-
mental modeling of the human form pointed ahead to the style known as
Mannerism.
Chapter 24: Ten Great Italian Artists 501

Raphael (Raffaello)
In a short lifetime, Raffaello Sanzio (1483–1520) left a profound mark on
European painting. He had already shown great talent as a draftsman
before he was out of his teens. After studying painting with Perugino and
other artists, he moved to Florence and fell under the spell of Leonardo
da Vinci. But Raffaello’s figures have a radiant, peaceful composure that
is all his own; his images have often been described as “sublime.” Some
of his finest work is in the rooms he frescoed at the Vatican for Pope
Julius II (see Chapter 12). It is less well known that Raffaello was very
interested in archaeology and was appointed commissioner of antiqui-
ties for the city of Rome. He died on his birthday at the age of 37; his
tomb is in the Pantheon.
Titian (Tiziano)
Tiziano Vecellio (circa 1488–1576) moved to Venice with his brother at
the age of nine and was apprenticed to a mosaicist. He found his true
calling, however, when he began to study under the greatest Venetian
painter of the time, Giovanni Bellini. Titian became famous for his depic-
tions of mythological and idyllic scenes, powerful and revealing por-
traits (like the one of Pope Paul III and family in the Capodimonte
museum in Naples — see Chapter 18), and stunning religious works such
as the revolutionary Assumption in the Frari church in Venice (see
Chapter 16), a truly glorious painting.
Tintoretto
Jacopo Robusti (1518–94) was nicknamed “tintoretto” (“little dyer”)
because his father was a silk dyer. His unmistakable mature style
involved dynamic, loose brushwork and a palette that could almost be
described as moody. He was a colossal talent, the leading Mannerist
painter of the time, and his presence is felt everywhere in Venice, partic-
ularly in Scuola Grande di San Rocco, which he literally filled with 
large canvases (see Chapter 16). Inspired by Michelangelo and Titian,
Tintoretto was nonetheless a unique and startlingly original painter,
whose work is above all passionate.
Gian Lorenzo Bernini
If anyone personifies the baroque period, it is Bernini (1598–1680).
Although born in Naples, he did his major work in Rome, where one can
hardly turn around without stumbling on one of his masterworks. He
developed a style that combined the psychological realism of earlier
Renaissance sculptors with heightened decoration. His baldaquin inside
St. Peter’s in Vatican City (see Chapter 12), a giant gilt-and-bronze
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
502

canopy over four stories tall, has been called the first baroque monu-
ment. His fountain in the Piazza Navona is one of the most beautiful in
Rome, while the Galleria Borghese contains several sculptures of
incredible mastery in which he made marble behave like flesh. Bernini
was so famous that when he visited the court of French king Louis XIV in
1665, crowds lined the streets to see him.
Caravaggio
One of the most beloved of Italian artists, Michelangelo Merisi da
Caravaggio (1572–1610) appeals to the modern imagination for his
romantic, tragic life as well as for his intense and unique art. He was con-
sidered a wild spirit by his contemporaries, and he befriended both
prostitutes (some of whom were his models) and criminals. However, he
was also protected and encouraged by cardinal Francesco del Monte.
His religious paintings were often rejected for their emotional intensity
and overpowering sensual impact (many can be found in the churches of
Rome and in the Galleria Borghese — see Chapter 12). He fled Rome
after a killing, or duel, which remains shadowy; he died soon thereafter.
The lurid details of his life, however, are less important than his extraor-
dinary use of light and shade, brilliant depiction of bodies in motion,
and tremendous fusion of naturalistic art and spiritual faith.

Language
Italians speak Italian, and although many
know a bit of English, it is not widely under-
stood. Luckily, you can survive with very
little knowledge of the Italian language
(see Chapter 23 for a few choice terms),
especially because Italians are very
friendly and ready to help foreigners in 
difficulty. However, you greatly enhance
your experience if you master more than a
dozen basic expressions. A good place to
start your studies is Italian For Dummies
(Wiley).
Liquor Laws
There are no liquor laws in Italy: That is,
anybody is free to buy alcohol in any
supermarket or grocery store during regu-
lar opening hours. However, drinking and
driving is forbidden, and displaying
drunken behavior is illegal: Doing either
will land you in jail. Also, drinking in the
street or overdrinking in bars and other
public places is seriously frowned upon;
you might be asked to stop, and the 
police may be called. The law against 
disturbing the quiete pubblica (public
quiet) is strict, and getting drunk and loud
in bars, streets, and even private homes is
not tolerated.
Maps
The free maps distributed at tourist infor-
mation desks are usually adequate. If you
want something more detailed, you can

Post Office
Each town has at least one post office,
usually in the historic district. Italian mail
has gotten a lot better with the introduc-
tion of Posta Prioritaria (express/priority):
A letter to the U.S. costs 0.80€ ($1.30) and
can take as little as four days to reach its
destination. Postcards are always sent via
the equivalent of U.S. third-class mail and
will take a long time to arrive, unless you
slip it into an envelope and send it letter
rate. Always make sure you put your mail
in the right mailbox: The ones for interna-
tional mail are blue, whereas the red ones
are for national mail. The new priority mail
also applies to packages; however, it is
expensive and you may be better off using
a private carrier like UPS or DHL, which
will guarantee your delivery, especially for
valuables. Many visitors still prefer to use
the Vatican post office while they’re visit-
ing St. Peter’s in Rome (service is the same
price as the Italian post, but is sometimes
faster). Just make sure to buy Vatican
stamps, and put your letter in a Vatican
mailbox, not an Italian one.
Safety
Italy is very safe, but petty theft is common.
Pickpockets abound in tourist areas, on
public transportation, and in crowded
open-air markets. Purse-snatchers on
motor scooters are less common than they
used to be — Palermo is the only city
where they’re still prevalent. Avoid carry-
ing your bag on the street side of the side-
walk, lest a thief zip by on a scooter.
Instead, keep your bag on the non-street
side, or between you and your companion.
Observe common big-city caution: Keep
your valuables in your hotel’s safe, don’t be
distracted, watch your belongings, don’t
count your money in public, and avoid dis-
playing valuable jewelry and electronic
equipment. There are suburban areas of
poverty around the major cities where a
wealthy-looking tourist with an expensive
camera may be mugged after dark, but
they are of no interest to tourists. (We indi-
cate seedy areas, when applicable, in indi-
vidual destination chapters.)
If you’re a woman traveling alone in 
Italy — especially if you’re young and 
fair-haired — you will attract attention
from young (and sometimes not-so-young)
Italian men. They give obvious and often
vocal indication of their admiration; in fact,
they may approach you and try to charm
you. However, it’s unlikely that someone
will touch you, let alone harm you. Still, it’s
a good idea to ignore and not make eye
contact with anyone who approaches you,
lest you be thought promiscuous. The way
you dress will also have an effect: Italians
have a stricter dress code than Americans
do, and the farther south you go, the more
traditional the society is. You see a lot of
female skin displayed, but only when
women are in company; if you’re alone,
you may want to cover up a bit.
If you are traveling alone, choose your
company carefully at night, and exercise
normal big-city caution.
Smoking
In 2005, Italy passed a law outlawing
smoking in most public places. Smoking is
allowed only where there is a separate,
ventilated area for nonsmokers. If you
want to smoke at your table, call before-
hand to make sure the restaurant or cafe
you intend to visit offers a smoking area.
Taxes
See Chapter 5 for information on IVA
(Value Added Tax).
Telephone
To call Italy from the U.S., dial the interna-
tional access code, 011; then Italy’s country
code, 39; and then the area code (including
0 if any) followed by the local telephone
Appendix A: Quick Concierge 507

number. Area codes for land lines in Italy
have varying numbers of digits — 06 for
Rome, 055 for Florence, 0583 for Lucca —
whereas area codes for cellular lines
always have three digits beginning with 3
(340, 338, and so on depending on the com-
pany network). Toll-free numbers have an
800 or 888 area code (you’ll be tempted to
add a 1, but it doesn’t work). Some paying
services use three-digit codes beginning
with 9. Also, some companies have their
own special numbers that don’t conform to
any of the preceding standards and that
are local calls from anywhere in Italy, 
such as the railroad info line of Trenitalia
(% 892021).
To make a call within Italy, always use the
area code — including 0 if any — for both
local and long distance. Public pay phones
in Italy take a carta telefonica (telephone
card), which you can buy at a tabacchi
(tobacconist, marked by a sign with a
white T on a black background), bar, or
newsstand. The cards can be purchased 
in different denominations, from 5€ to
7.50€ ($8–$12). Tear off the perforated
corner, stick the card in the phone, and
you’re good to go. A local call in Italy costs
0.10€ (16¢).
To call abroad from Italy, dial the interna-
tional access code, 00; then the country
code of the country that you’re calling (1
for the United States and Canada, 44 for
the United Kingdom, 353 for Ireland, 61 for
Australia, 64 for New Zealand); and then
the local area code and phone number.
Make sure you have a high-value carta
telefonica before you start; your 5€ won’t
last long if you call San Diego at noon.
Lower rates apply after 11 p.m. and before
8 a.m. and on Sundays. You can also 
purchase prepaid international calling
cards — usually best used from landlines
because they carry a steep surcharge
when applied to public phones (make sure
you read the small print) — but we find
that the best option for calling home is
using your own calling card linked to your
home phone. Some calling cards offer a
toll-free access number in Italy; for those
that don’t, you must put in a carta tele-
fonica to dial the access number (you’re
usually charged only for a local call or not
at all). Check with your calling-card
provider before leaving on your trip. You
can also make collect calls: For AT&T, dial
% 800-1724444 and then your U.S. phone
number, area code first; for MCI, dial 
% 800-905825; and for Sprint, dial %
800-172405 or 800-172406. To make a col-
lect call to a country other than the United
States, dial % 170. Directory assistance
for calls within Italy is free: Dial % 12.
International directory assistance is a toll
call: Dial % 176. Remember that calling
from a hotel is convenient but usually
expensive, as various surcharges apply.
Time Zone
In terms of standard time zones, Italy is six
hours ahead of eastern standard time in
the United States: When it is 6 a.m. in New
York, it is noon in Italy. Daylight saving time
goes into effect in Italy each year from the
last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in
October.
Tipping
Tipping is customary as a token of appre-
ciation as well as a polite gesture on 
most occasions. A 10 to 15 percent serv-
ice charge is usually included in your
restaurant bill (check the menu when you
order — if the service is included, it will be
marked at the beginning or at the end as
servizio incluso), but it is customary to
leave an additional 5 percent if you appre-
ciated the meal. If the service is not
included, leave 15 to 20 percent. In bars,
leave a 5 percent tip at the counter and a
10 to 15 percent tip if you sit at a table.
Bellhops who carry your bags will expect
about 1€ ($1.60) per bag, and you may
Italy For Dummies, 5th Edition 
508

Appendix A: Quick Concierge 509
want to leave a small tip for housekeeping
in your room; cabdrivers will expect 10
percent of the fare.
Weather Updates
Before you go, you can check a Web 
site such as www.cnn.com or www.
wunderground.com; the best Italian
sites are meteo.ansa.it and www.
tempoitalia.it (in Italian only but
quite easy to use). Once in Italy, your best
bet is to watch the news on TV (there’s no
number for weather forecasts, as there is
in the U.S.).
