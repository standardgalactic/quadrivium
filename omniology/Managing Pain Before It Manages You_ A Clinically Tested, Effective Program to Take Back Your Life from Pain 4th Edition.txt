Praise for Managing Pain Before It Manages You
“When I first began using the program described in this compassionate book more than 
20 years ago, I was suffering from migraine headaches that left me incapacitated—barely 
able to care for my family or myself. The program alleviated my anxiety and emotional 
stress and taught me ways to decrease my symptoms and function better. I continue to 
use the skills to this day.”
—Gerry R., Massachusetts
“For over 20 years, this book has been the premier guide for managing pain. Now in its 
fourth edition, it is by far the best and most up-to-date step-by-step pain management 
manual on the market. Dr. Caudill’s time-tested program really works. Chock-full of 
practical advice and tools drawn from years of clinical experience, this is an invaluable 
resource for everyone who wants to take back control of their life.”
—Robert N. Jamison, PhD, Departments of Anesthesia and Psychiatry, 
Harvard Medical School; Pain Management Center, Brigham and Women’s Hospital
“If you suffer from chronic pain, this book is an absolute must! It not only addresses 
practical issues, but also respectfully acknowledges and addresses the heavy emotional 
burden. Dr. Caudill’s book is our most powerful tool for clients with chronic pain.”
—Maureen Theberge, RPsych, and Diana Gudim, RPsych, 
Viewpoint Counselling Psychology, Calgary, Canada
“I appreciated the tangible tools in this workbook. It was so positive and productive for 
me to learn how to track my symptoms and identify patterns, and to try the effective 
techniques Dr. Caudill explains.”
—Dawna C., New Hampshire
“With wisdom and compassion, the fourth edition of Managing Pain builds on its time-
less core with new insights from emerging research. I have been referring to and highly 
recommending this book for years. It can help you feel and do better, thrive despite the 
persistence of pain, and harness the power of the human spirit to restore joy and hope.”
—Paul Arnstein, RN, PhD, clinical nurse specialist for pain relief, 
Massachusetts General Hospital
“[Caudill] has developed a clinically tested program recognized throughout the world. 
Her program for chronic pain has been scientifically proven to significantly lessen anxi-
ety and depression. . . . The book is user-friendly, providing practical advice in an engag-
ing fashion. Those who have used this approach report that in addition to lessening their 
suffering from pain, they have learned how to apply its principles to other aspects of 
their lives.”
—The Pain Clinic

“This book is a gem that has endured the test of time. Dr. Caudill doesn’t promise a cure, 
but delivers a powerful message about how to reclaim a life interrupted by pain. She is 
the consummate clinician who lends a compassionate perspective to a very challenging 
medical problem.”
—Eileen Stuart-Shor, PhD, APRN, FAAN, College of Nursing 
and Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts Boston; 
nurse practitioner, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
“Anyone who applies the principles in this unique book will have improved function and 
quality of life. The updated fourth edition is now even better. I recommend this book to 
almost all of my patients with chronic pain.”
—Gilbert J. Fanciullo, MD, MS, Director, Pain Management Center, 
Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center

Foreword
Dr. Margaret Caudill has been a professional colleague for many years. She provided 
me with wise and successful pain management. I am deeply grateful and proud to be an 
associate of hers.
Dr. Caudill’s expertise in pain reflects her extensive experience in wedding mind–
body approaches with pain medications, therapeutic exercises, and diet. She has devel-
oped a clinically tested program recognized throughout the world. Her program for 
chronic pain has been scientifically proven to significantly lessen anxiety and depression, 
as well as anger and hostility. It diminishes the interference in life that comes with chronic 
pain; there is less overall distress, and in many cases the severity of pain is reduced. These 
improvements very frequently occur along with decreased use of pain medications, and 
so successful is her approach that patients on average reduce their visits to physicians by 
36% for years following treatments.
Dr. Caudill has achieved these remarkable results by coupling what people can do for 
themselves with state-of-the-art medical treatments. The publication of Managing Pain 
Before It Manages You allows you to make use of its approach. You may also use it along 
with a pain regimen prescribed by your health care provider. Or you may find that your 
health care provider has prescribed it for you. The book is user-­friendly, providing practi-
cal advice in an engaging fashion.
Those who have used this approach report that in addition to lessening their suffer-
ing from pain, they have learned how to apply its principles to other aspects of their lives. 
They communicate better, have a more positive attitude, and frequently achieve other 
elusive health goals. Overall, they report having gained more control over their lives.
Managing Pain Before It Manages You reflects the author’s caring and compassion, 
as well as her experience and wisdom. Successful mind–body approaches require these 
qualities. Many patients erroneously believe that mind–body treatments mean that their 
pain is “only in their heads.” This is not what Dr. Caudill teaches. Rather, she expertly 

xii	
Foreword	
guides you through these considerations by teaching beneficial aspects of mind–body 
interactions to help you improve your entire life.
I trust that your use of the approach in Managing Pain Before It Manages You will 
aid you as much as it has the many thousands who have already benefited from it.

Acknowledgments
It is important to acknowledge the very real and crucial past contributions of my col-
leagues Richard Schnable, Margaret Ennis, Carol Wells-­Federman, and Paul Arnstein. 
Over the years, our dialogues and cumulative experience created the Chronic Pain Man-
agement Program on which this book is based. It is impossible to distinguish where their 
ideas end and mine begin.
I would also like to acknowledge the invaluable support of my former colleagues at 
the Division of Behavioral Medicine, the Mind/Body Medical Institute, and the Arnold 
Pain Center at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, as 
well as those at the Dartmouth–Hitchcock Clinics and Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical 
Center in New Hampshire. Special thanks to Nancy L. Josephson, who wrote Appen-
dix C and is responsible for making the original material “user-­friendly,” and to Anna 
Brackett, Editorial Project Manager at The Guilford Press, who started this project with 
me 20 years ago. I am indebted to Barbara Watkins, Senior Editor at The Guilford Press, 
who has nurtured this project from its conception and continues to gently guide its revi-
sions. Thank you to copyeditor Margaret Ryan for her careful review and comments on 
the manuscript of this edition. I wish to extend my appreciation to Eileen Stuart-Shor, 
the late Richard Friedman, Sharon McDonnell, Richard Slosberg, Jay Galipeault, Gilbert 
Fanciullo, Lisa Maheu, and Michelle Fellows for their support and words of encourage-
ment over the years. Finally, a special thank-you is owed to the peer advisors and Gerry 
Rainville, who have shared their experiences and support with the hundreds of patients 
who followed in their footsteps.

Preface
To heal does not necessarily imply to cure. It can simply mean help-
ing people to achieve a way of life compatible with their individual 
aspirations—to restore their freedom to make choices—even in the 
presence of continuing disease.
—René Dubos, Human Nature (1978)
I know I’m going to have a good day because I know how to make it 
a good day.
—Patty, after participation in this pain management program
More than 20 years after the publication of this book’s first edition, a clear mechanism 
for chronic pain continues to elude us and, as a result, so does a definitive treatment. 
One reason is that the body’s pain system is exquisitely complex. It interacts with mul-
tiple interpretive, emotional, and reasoning parts of the brain. Although we still speak 
of chronic pain as one experience, it is really hundreds of disorders that have one thing 
in common: the continuation of a pain message for months to years. When I started sit-
ting with patients three decades ago, I did not expect there would be no cure for chronic 
pain in the second decade of the 21st century. Pain, that complex system that warns us 
of danger and harm, is so adaptive and crucial that it touches on every aspect of what we 
call human. As such it defies simplification.
At the time I began my career in pain medicine, I also did not expect to be on the 
receiving end of chronic pain, but aging and genetics have conspired to make it so. After 
my initial disbelief (“You’ve got to be kidding me!”), fear (“Is it cancer?”), and panic (“I 
don’t have time for this!”), the irony of a pain specialist having chronic pain became a 
source of humor, and I have carried on, but in a different way. I’ve been given the oppor-
tunity to apply to myself the lessons in this book, drawn from the experiences of many 
brave people before me. I am fortunate to have had these skills at my disposal and a prac-
tical disposition that left little time for despair. So I can say that I personally endorse the 
program that follows and hope you are able to benefit as well.
In spite of there being no cure for most chronic pain problems at this time, the years 

xvi	
Preface	
since this book’s last edition have seen the peeling away of the mystery surrounding the 
pain system. This new knowledge gives us all hope and helps explain why a multi­faceted 
intervention approach to pain management, as described in this workbook, can and 
will be effective. Science supports the idea that beliefs, conditioning, and thinking styles 
can influence the experience of pain. Abnormal nerve pathways have the potential for 
being changed (called “neuroplasticity”) with practices such as mindfulness, cognitive-­
behavioral therapy, and imagery.
In this new edition, Chapters 2, “Understanding Pain,” and 3, “The Mind–Body 
Connection,” have been updated to include these new observations and the potential for 
treatment efficacy. Our understanding of the genetics of pain is another huge area that 
is rapidly developing. The complex expression of genetic makeup may one day explain 
a person’s predisposition to develop chronic pain after an injury as well as why people 
vary in their response to medications. Novel therapies have already been developed for 
rare genetic disorders such as primary erythromelalgia, a disorder of the sodium pump in 
nerve cells associated with burning pain, warmth, and redness of the extremities.
Since the last edition of this book, there have been multiple reviews in the research 
literature to assess the benefit of various drug therapies in treating chronic pain, includ-
ing opioids and marijuana. The results are presented in Chapter 2, along with the level 
of supporting evidence, when available. Although there is considerable variability in how 
people respond to medications, one fact remains: No medication reduces chronic pain to 
zero. This fact supports the use of a mind, body, and spirit approach to pain management 
to reduce suffering.
Chapter 4, “The Body–Mind Connection,” is largely unchanged, given the contin-
ued strong evidence that moving the body plays a role in improved function, improved 
health, and weight control. The research tells us that certain ways of interpreting the 
world around us can contribute to increased pain, increased disability, and poor coping, 
as described in Chapters 5, “The Power of the Mind,” and 6, “Adopting Healthy Atti-
tudes.” A number of studies support the benefits of mindfulness practice (a mental state 
of focusing on the moment) and cognitive-­behavioral therapy for a number of medical 
conditions and chronic pain.
Furthermore, results from experiments involving experiences of acute pain suggest 
that the style of thinking called “catastrophizing” may be associated with an inability 
to inhibit pain messages. These findings add weight to recommendations for changing 
unhelpful thought patterns. Resources for assessing the tendency toward catastrophic 
thinking and its components are included. A new pathway to forgiveness has been adapted 
to those situations where chronic pain has occurred after being harmed by someone else. 
In the realm of positive attitudes, efforts have been made to study the role of compassion, 
self-­compassion, and empathy in both witnessing and experiencing pain. A new section 
on how coping styles evolve in the face of chronic pain and the benefits of that adjustment 
are included.
Chapter 7, “Nutrition and Pain,” discusses the importance of a balanced diet, weight 
loss, moderation, and eating more fresh fruit and vegetables and less processed food. There 
is very little support for any wholesale recommendation of any nutritional supplement or 

	
Preface	
xvii
special diet for pain. The only general recommendation is for moderation, a balanced 
diet, and weight control. Calculating body mass index is included to assist with weight 
control, and the new food plate proportions and plate size are included to assist with 
weight management. The availability of fresh nutritional produce continues to be a chal-
lenge for many low-­income individuals, those on fixed budgets, and those with little time 
or experience to prepare meals. Chapter 7 offers resources to assist with these challenges.
Chapter 8, “Effective Communication,” stresses the importance of building your 
communication skills so you can get what you need. Chapter 9, “Effective Problem Solv-
ing,” is an opportunity to review all the skills that you can gain from this program. 
Chapter 10, “The End of the Beginning,” plans for the inevitable relapse and the value of 
having a “panic plan” when pain flares.
As explained in the introductory chapter, “Before You Begin: How This Book Can 
Help You,” in order to work, this program must be put into practice. To assist you in this 
practice, most chapters in this edition include a new feature I call “Quick Skills,” which 
provides simple, easy-to-­implement suggestions that can make a more immediate impact.
Appendix A, “Common Chronic Pain Conditions,” has been updated and expanded, 
particularly with the dramatic insights into fibromyalgia, musculoskeletal pain, and neu-
ropathies. Vulvodynia (chronic inflammation of the tissue of the female vulva) has been 
added and new treatments for CRPS Type I (complex regional pain syndrome) explored. 
Appendix B, “Complementary Alternative Medicine,” has been updated to reflect current 
knowledge. Appendix C offers advice for working comfortably at a computer. Appen-
dix D, “Managing Osteoarthritis Pain with Medicines: A Review of the Research for 
Adults,” new in this edition, reprints information for consumers from the U.S. govern-
ment’s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Appendix E, “Electronic Resources,” 
has been updated to reflect current, reliable websites for health information. It contains 
a new section on software applications (“apps”) available for smartphones that can be 
used to track pain, function, and self-talk. Finally, Appendix F provides the worksheets 
found throughout this workbook all in one place for you to copy and use as needed. 
These worksheets are also available online at www.guilford.com/managepain. A Letter 
to Health Care Professionals is provided to assist patients and their providers in working 
together to assess and treat chronic pain.
This book was one of the first to describe a path to chronic pain management for 
those who suffer with chronic pain. It has stood the test of time. Now in its fourth edi-
tion, it gives you the latest in the science of pain management. It does not offer a quick fix, 
and it does not promise that you will be pain free at the end, but following its recommen-
dations can reduce your suffering and give you back your life. Mind and body are inti-
mately connected; strengthening those connections can alter the experience of living with 
pain for the better. I invite you to join me in managing your pain so it won’t manage you!


Managing Pain Before It Manages You

Before You Begin:  
How This Book Can Help You
Thank God, I finally realized that pain may be mandatory, but suffer-
ing is optional. . . .
—Craig T. Nelson, actor
We know a lot about chronic pain and what might make it persist and are learning more 
every day, but many people are still left to live their lives with pain right now. If you have 
chronic pain and have begun to see that it is not going away today (or tomorrow), then 
while you are waiting for the cure, you might as well live life the best way you can. Prac-
ticing the skills in this book can help you get your life back.
This book has been carefully developed from years of work with brave people expe-
riencing pain. If you have begun reading this book, you have probably been living with 
pain for some time. You may have a painful disease for which there is no cure, or you may 
have experienced the tremendous frustration of trying to explain to doctors that your 
pain is real and it is persisting, even though they can’t find a cause for it. They may have 
told you that all your tests have come back negative, that there is no medical explanation 
for your continued pain, that the surgery was successful, the MRI (magnetic resonance 
imaging) is unchanged, or something similar. They may have suggested that you consider 
counseling or see a psychiatrist to help you cope with or manage the tears or anger.
As if this weren’t bad enough, you must return home and face your anxious loved 
ones, who have been hoping against hope for a “miracle cure” so that you and they can 
resume something like normal family life—or any life at all. You must now tell them that 
your condition is unchanged and that you have exhausted all medical help. If you have 
not returned to work but run into colleagues, you must explain to them that you have not 
been on vacation and politely tolerate their unsupportive comments (“Aren’t you better 
yet?”) or their suggestions for home remedies (special supplements, copper bracelets, etc.). 
In short, you may feel abandoned, panicky, and utterly alone.
This book is for you if you can say, “I have chronic pain, it’s real, and I need help.” 
But you don’t have to be at the end of your rope to use this book. The skills it describes 
can also help you get more out of your ongoing medical treatment. For you at this time, 
pain may be mandatory, but suffering is optional. And you are definitely not alone.

MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
This book is also for you if you are the relative or friend of a person in chronic pain. 
It may increase your own understanding of the pain experience, or it could be an impor-
tant gift to that special person. Finally, this book is for you if you are a health care profes-
sional; it can be a valuable resource for you and your patients who must live in pain. The 
Letter to Health Care Professionals in Appendix F can help guide you in working with 
patients using this workbook.
Is the following story familiar to you?
A Common Story
Pat entered the new specialist’s office, tired and apprehensive at the prospect of 
describing her pain once again to a stranger. No one ever seemed to listen when 
she tried to explain what it was like to wake up and go to bed day after day in pain. 
Every day it became more of an effort to take care of herself and her family. Her chil-
dren wondered, “Gee, Mom, what’s wrong with you? Why won’t they fix it?” Two 
nights ago her husband—­frustrated, she knew, at his own sense of powerlessness—
had snapped, “Why can’t you just ignore it?” She remembered her family physician’s 
words at her last visit: “There is nothing else I can do. You have chronic pain and 
must learn to live with it.” She had cried all the way home. Her doctor, however, had 
also given her the name of a pain specialist who worked with people in chronic pain 
and had been successful in helping them. She didn’t like this alternative at all. But 
after spending thousands of dollars, experiencing medication side effects, undergo-
ing unsuccessful surgery, and seeing six consultants, she was no closer to getting rid 
of the pain.
So now here she was waiting for someone else to give her bad news. The pain 
management doctor, however, asked questions she had not heard before—­questions 
about her experience of pain: Had she ever noticed that her pain increased with cer-
tain activities, particularly when she ignored the early spasms warning her to stop? 
Did she find that if she was anxious or upset about family or financial matters, her 
pain flared up as well? Was she more short-­tempered than she used to be? Did she 
cry more easily? Was she experiencing non-pain-­related symptoms—like shortness of 
breath, palpitations, fatigue, or sleep problems? Pat answered yes to all of these ques-
tions.
The pain specialist told Pat that her pain was real—it was absolutely not “all in 
her head”—but that medical science did not yet know how to take it away. She was 
one of millions of people caught in a tangled web of chronic pain. However, many of 
Pat’s symptoms were manageable, because they were the results of ignoring the lim-
its placed on her by the pain. By identifying new ways of working with and relating to 
her pain, she could feel less helpless, less hopeless, and more in control. She could even 
feel more productive and better about herself just by practicing certain techniques 
and modifying her daily routine in a way that allowed her to take her discomfort into

consideration. The threads of Pat’s pain web could in fact be untangled and rewoven 
into a safety net if she followed this program.
Pat was still a little skeptical, but she decided to give it a try. She felt that at this 
point, she had nothing to lose and everything to gain.
This book describes the program that helped Pat. It can help you too.
How Effective Is the Program?
Like Pat, are you still a little skeptical?
The program presented in this book has been proven effective in helping people in 
chronic pain improve their quality of life. My colleagues and I first reported this improve-
ment in a paper published in a scientific journal, The Clinical Journal of Pain (7: 305–
310, 1991). Before our patients participated in a pain management program identical 
to the one in this book, they averaged 12 doctor visits a year. After participating, the 
patients did not need to see their doctors as frequently (down to seven visits per year), and 
doctor visits stayed down for up to 2 years after the end of the program. Furthermore, 
the patients reported less depression, less anxiety, lower pain severity, and less interfer-
ence from pain in their activities. They also noted increases in feelings of control and in 
their general activity levels. Since then numerous studies of similar programs have dem-
onstrated that addressing stress, exercise, functioning, goal setting, and thinking styles 
improves daily functioning, mood, and well-being.
My colleagues and I believed that this program worked because it helped people 
increase their ability to manage, function, and cope with pain. Belief in your ability 
to manage, function, and cope with challenges is called “self-­efficacy.” Our research, 
published in the journal Pain (81: 483–491, 1999), shows that your sense of self-­efficacy 
influences how much your pain depresses or disables you. This finding has also been sup-
ported by other studies. Practicing the skills in this book will help you gain control over 
the pain.
What Can You Expect?
The program described here does not offer a “miracle cure” or “10 easy steps to freedom 
from pain.” It also does not promise to make your life exactly the way it was before you 
had the pain. However, no one is suggesting that you should just passively endure your 
pain. If you learn and use the skills in this book, you can expect to become active and 
involved in your life again. You can regain this engagement in life in a way that will mini-
mize pain and reduce the distress of having a pain problem. By becoming involved in your 
pain treatment, you become part of the solution to the problem.

MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
What’s Involved?
This pain management program will help you understand what chronic pain is and why 
certain treatments may have been prescribed for you in the past. You will be asked to 
explore your pain experience by tracking it on a daily basis. You can use the Pain Diary 
form in Appendix F or one of the apps in Appendix E to record how what you do now 
affects your pain. Later, you can record how doing things differently affects your pain. 
This is a way of beginning to untangle the pain web in which you have been caught. You 
will be given many opportunities to reflect on how you wish to live each day. Many old 
habits that served you well in the past may not work now that you are challenged by pain.
Many ways to reduce stress are presented. These include breathing and body aware-
ness exercises, stretching techniques, and techniques that reduce the physical and emo-
tional arousal associated with stress, such as mindfulness and those that bring about the 
“relaxation response.” In addition, this book will show you how to become more active 
with less pain by learning how to pace and plan your daily activities. In this process you 
will explore methods of moving when you are in pain and how to use breathing to reduce 
the tension of pain during movement. Ways of using nutrition to your advantage are also 
discussed.
Moreover, this book can teach you skills for coping with the sadness, anxiety, or 
anger you may be experiencing. These skills include methods for communicating your 
needs clearly and expressing yourself effectively to those around you, including your 
health care provider. Finally, you can learn techniques for problem solving and for begin-
ning to plan a new life in spite of the pain. You will then be ready to reweave the untan-
gled threads of your old pain web into a safety net.
This program is meant to empower you to act in your own best interests. In fact, by 
deciding to read this far, you have been learning to exercise choice. At any time you can 
put down this book and stop the process, but choosing to go on can open many doors for 
you. Will you stay where you are, feeling trapped and misunderstood, or will you begin 
to evaluate and understand how your pain can be modified? Will you continue to feel 
that you are at the mercy of your pain, or will you begin to live with hope? You do have 
choices.
How to Use This Book
This program has been used by many people who feel just like you do. They have, like 
you, bravely made the first step toward managing their pain by picking up this book. 
Whether you are reading it by yourself or with a group of other people in pain, you can 
be assured that your struggles are universal ones. Reading the patients’ stories presented 
throughout the book may also help you to feel less lonely in your work.
Most people find that they make the best use of the book by reading about a chapter 
a week, but you should set your own pace. Allow enough time to answer the questions 

	
Before You Begin: How This Book Can Help You

in each chapter and complete the exploration tasks (see the next section). More skills and 
techniques are added as you read through the book. Many of the tasks do not require 
you to make extra time in your schedule; they simply require you to pay attention to how 
you do the things you already do. Some of the skills and techniques, such as the ones in 
the chapters on thinking, emotions, attitudes, and communication, may take a little more 
time.
Keep in mind that there is no need for you to finish all 10 chapters in 10 weeks. 
Research studies with self-­changers, such as those who stop smoking, suggest that it takes 
at least 10 weeks to begin to change behavior, and that 6 months of sustained action 
are required to progress to the stage where self-­changers are maintaining their changes. 
Research also shows that real change and therefore real benefits take place only when 
people act upon the written word. If you are really in doubt about the benefits of working 
with this book, just reading it may be what you need to do at this time. If you are ready 
to change the way you feel and to improve your life in pain, then it’s essential to actually 
carry out the exercises in this book.
Special Features of This Book
This book offers a number of special features to help you. These include chapter sum-
maries, exploration tasks, Quick Skills for fast results, supplementary reading lists, free 
audio downloads of guided relaxations, appendices, reproducible worksheets, and other 
materials.
At the end of each chapter, you will find a summary of its key points. You may 
find it helpful to read the summary first—a preview of coming attractions, so to speak. 
Reviewing the summary after reading the chapter is useful for picking up certain points 
or aspects that you may have forgotten or missed.
Most chapters include exploration tasks. Complete at least one of the tasks before you 
move on to the next chapter. These tasks are designed to reinforce what you’ve learned in 
the chapter. They ask you to apply the chapter’s skills to your particular situation and put 
them into practice. This is where the real learning occurs. If you are working on a chap-
ter a week, the exploration tasks will clarify which skills you should be practicing at any 
particular time. Look also for the Quick Skills in Chapters 1–9. These skills are simple to 
implement and can give you some quick results, especially if you are feeling overwhelmed, 
need help to start this program, or need help maintaining your momentum.
There are supplementary reading lists at the end of most chapters. You can use these 
reading materials to get additional information or to help you develop your skills further. 
The combined contents of these lists (and a few additional resources) are presented in the 
Bibliography.
To help you learn and practice the relaxation response techniques in Chapter 3, you 
can download an audio of guided relaxations that I have recorded. These are free and 
available from the publisher’s website at www.guilford.com/managepain. Just follow the 
directions on the website.

MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
You can find other helpful resources in the appendices. Appendix A, “Common 
Chronic Pain Conditions,” is a review of research on various chronic pain syndromes. 
It can serve as a resource for support groups or for further treatment recommendations 
in some instances. Appendix B, “Complementary Alternative Medicine,” discusses other 
therapies that have been used for pain treatment. Appendix C, “Working Comfortably 
at a Computer,” was written by a former patient to help those who must work at a com-
puter; it has important recommendations to prevent injuries or relapses. Appendix D is 
the consumer guide to “Managing Osteoarthritis Pain with Medicines” from the U.S. 
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Appendix E, “Electronic Resources,” con-
tains an annotated list of websites that are resources for health and pain information. It 
also provides information about some of the available software applications for tracking 
pain, function, and self-talk.
Appendix F contains worksheets and other materials that can be photocopied or 
downloaded and printed (from www.guilford.com/managepain) by purchasers of this 
book for personal use only (see copyright page for details). The worksheets include a Pain 
Diary sheet (see Chapter 1 for an explanation of its use); a medication list (see Chapter 2); 
a relaxation response technique diary (see Chapter 3); an increasing activities worksheet 
(see Chapter 4); a worksheet for monitoring your self-talk, emotions, and other responses 
to stressful events (see Chapter 5); a food diary sheet (see Chapter 7); and a weekly feed-
back sheet for giving your health care professional information about your pain experi-
ence (see Chapter 8).
Additional materials include (1) a “Do Not Disturb” sign that can be copied and 
hung on your door to prevent interruptions during your practice of mindfulness or relax-
ation techniques, and (2) a letter to your health care professional, which I encourage you 
to copy and take to your next visit. It explains how your health care provider can help 
you use the information in this book, and it can help enlist his or her participation in this 
program if you have picked up the book on your own.
A Final Note
The solutions offered in this book are for real people living in the real world. The skills 
and techniques are practical, and the recommendations are based on years of working 
with people in pain just like you. You are encouraged to read and reread carefully even 
those statements that you may find disagreeable or distressing. The last thing you may 
want to hear is that it is possible to live in pain or that after reading this book you will not 
necessarily be pain-free. I do understand that it is not your choice to be in pain and that 
your life has been changed by your pain. These recommendations for working with your 
pain and rebuilding your life are not made lightly. They are made because I have seen and 
have also experienced that, with help, people are able to live with and even rise above 
their pain in remarkable ways. You can be productive, can enjoy life’s pleasures, and can 
even fulfill some dreams if you apply what you read in this book to your pain problem. I 
hope that this will be a positive new beginning for you. Welcome to the program!

Beginning to Take Control  
of Your Pain
You may still have doubts about whether you can ever enjoy life again while you are in 
chronic pain. Nevertheless, let’s at least explore how living a life of quality with chronic 
pain is possible. The keys are to take ownership of your pain (and this doesn’t mean 
blaming yourself for it), determine exactly what your problems are as a result of the pain, 
and reassess your goals in the light of this information. This chapter gives you your first 
set of tools for beginning to take control of your pain: diary keeping and goal setting. To 
begin, look at the first of the three keys: accepting ownership of your pain.
Accepting Ownership of Your Pain
Your problem is that you are in pain and the pain won’t go away. Defining the problem in 
this way is an important first step; before you can do anything about your pain, you need 
to acknowledge that it exists.
You may also feel inclined at this point to blame others for your pain. You may feel 
that your doctors have failed you by not finding and curing the source of the pain or at 
least by not making you feel better. You may believe that your loved ones are not doing 
anything to help you or are showing a lack of understanding or empathy for your prob-
lem. You may even feel that society is to blame for causing the situation that put you in 
pain in the first place or for not making it easier for you to seek help.
The fact that you may be sad, angry, or anxious about the disruption of your whole 
life as a result of the pain experience is both understandable and normal. Under these 
circumstances, it may be very tempting to feel that others are to blame for the pain and 
ought to be responsible for taking it away. Indeed, many people in pain put their whole 
lives on hold waiting for others—their physicians, their families, or society—to do just 
this. The difficulty is that wanting to give away both the pain and the responsibility for 

8	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
coping with it only prolongs your feelings of powerlessness. If your pain is not going away 
anytime soon—and this is the very nature of chronic pain—then taking on responsibility 
for living with it begins to return control of your life to you. If you can adopt an attitude 
of “ownership” for the pain problem, then you have the potential to gain the upper hand 
over it. Although you may need assistance from your health care professional, your fam-
ily, and society, it is ultimately your task, and yours alone, to untangle yourself from your 
pain web.
You may now be thinking, “Oh, great. So I’m responsible for my pain, huh? I’m to 
blame? That’s what everybody’s been saying—or at least hinting—all along. I feel bad 
and guilty enough as it is.” That is not what I mean here at all. As you probably already 
know, self-blame and guilt can be paralyzing emotions. They can make you feel so bad 
and worthless, there’s no point in doing anything at all. Accepting ownership of your 
pain, on the other hand, means acknowledging that you are a worthwhile person, that 
there is a point in doing something, and that you do have choices. It is very different from 
blaming yourself.
Chronic pain is complex, with many origins and treatments. It is grossly misunder-
stood. This book will provide you with the information you need to move forward. Even 
though your life is different from the way it was before the pain, you can change some of 
the consequences of having pain. You can learn to work with the consequences so that 
they cause you less distress. Your task is difficult—but not impossible.
Determining Exactly What Your Problems Are
Order and simplification are the first steps toward mastery of a 
subject—the actual enemy is the unknown.
—Thomas Mann, The Magic Mountain (1924)
The Importance of Tracking Your Pain Levels
One important way to gain understanding of your pain is to record it. This tracking 
process allows you to see what decreases or increases your pain—for instance, certain 
activities, weather, tension, and sleeplessness. Record your pain level three times a day, 
at regular times that are convenient for you. For example, you might write down your 
pain level when you wake up, after lunch, and then again at bedtime. Such consistency is 
important, because if you record your pain only when you are aware of it, you won’t nec-
essarily notice when your pain level changes. Recording the pain at regular intervals will 
allow you to discover that there are patterns in your pain experience over time. Becoming 
aware of these patterns will help you determine what makes the pain better or worse, 
what helps and what hurts.
Many people are resistant at first to the idea of tracking their pain, and you may be 
one of them. Not only are you in pain to begin with, but it’s an additional hassle to have 
to record all this stuff—and three times a day! “Why do I have to do this? It’s not fair!” 
you may say. Perhaps the following story will help.

	
Beginning to Take Control of Your Pain	
9
Paula was very angry at the thought of keeping track of her pain levels. Her back hurt 
and she already knew she was in pain. Why did she have to write it down three times 
a day, every day?
At first, Paula was so miserable that recording the pain just made her realize how 
bad she felt. Gradually, she realized how much she denied the pain in her back and 
how it prevented her from doing anything productive or pleasurable. Not only had 
she given up working outside the home, but she barely kept up with the household 
chores. Her house certainly wasn’t as clean as it used to be. Even worse, she was irri-
table toward her husband and yelled at her children. She rarely saw her friends and 
really didn’t care anymore about going out. Somehow this just wasn’t the way Paula 
wanted to live.
Then Paula began to see how she pushed herself throughout the day and col-
lapsed at night. Her back was stiff when she awoke, and the pain gradually increased 
during the day. What was causing the increase? Was it the fact that she “pushed, 
crashed, and burned” on a regular basis? Did this contribute to her feeling out of con-
trol? Would pacing her activities help? Slowly the answers became clear.
Over time, Paula saw that keeping track of her pain levels helped her learn more 
about the connection between her pain and her activities, what she did and how she 
did it. She was able to incorporate the skills she was learning for pain management 
into her daily routine and was eventually able to decrease the pain, bringing it more 
under her control.
If you don’t think that recording your pain will be a chore, that’s great. If you do, 
consider this: You have done your best in your current situation, and it still hasn’t been 
effective in controlling your pain. Recording your pain levels can help you determine 
where you might be stuck and point you in the right direction. You can’t count on remem-
bering exactly what your pain feels like under all conditions over a long period of time. 
So give the recording method a shot—it just might work for you. Remember: What you 
know, you can master.
Keeping a Pain Diary
An effective way of tracking your pain is to keep the Pain Diary worksheet provided in 
Appendix F. There is a sample of a completed Pain Diary, along with a blank Pain Diary 
form that can be copied (or downloaded from www.guilford.com/managepain).
In your Pain Diary it is important to keep track of both the physical (bodily) sen-
sations of pain and any unpleasant emotions associated with the pain—the emotional 
response. “Physical sensation” refers to the aching, stabbing, burning, pounding, tight-
ness, or other bodily symptoms you may feel. In the Pain Diary, “emotional response” 
refers to the unpleasant or negative emotions associated with your pain and is a measure 

10	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
of suffering—for example, frustration, anxiety, anger, or sadness. Such unpleasant emo-
tions are often associated with thinking such thoughts as “This [pain] will never go 
away,” “It’s not fair!,” “I’m useless,” and “My life is worthless.” These types of thoughts 
can make you feel worse and your pain even greater.
Note that the word “feel” can be used to describe both physical sensations and emo-
tional reactions. This dual meaning can be confusing when you try to describe the pain 
experience to yourself and to the outside world. I began asking patients in pain to make 
the distinction between the two meanings years ago, at the last session of my very first 
pain group. The patients were talking about how great they felt and yet their “pain level” 
was only slightly lower than what they had recorded 10 weeks earlier. I was puzzled and 
I asked them to help me understand what had happened. They explained, “Oh, we still 
have pain [the physical sensation], but we feel so much better [the emotional response] 
about it. We aren’t helpless now, and we know what to do when our pain increases. We’re 
in control, not the pain!”
Most health care workers do not make this distinction and do not understand the 
dual meaning that pain can have. They make the mistake of using one scale, a single rat-
ing of pain, when they ask patients, “What pain level are you experiencing?” If you get 
asked this question, be sure to clarify what you mean. This greater clarity will assist you 
in getting the appropriate medicine or intervention at the correct dose or in a timely man-
ner for your specific symptom.
The fact is that a lot more can be done about the emotional response to chronic pain 
than about the physical experience. And this can make you feel a whole lot better about 
dealing with your chronic pain, as it did with our patients. You can begin by getting 
in touch with how you experience your pain, both physically and emotionally. Become 
aware of the distinction between the two. You may find that at any one time you have 
more emotional than physical feelings related to your pain or just the opposite: more 
physical pain than emotional feelings. It will take some time and practice to see the dif-
ference, but it is worth the effort. Some of the exercises in the next few chapters will help 
you to separate these feelings.
I recommend that you continue to fill out the Pain Diary form for at least 3 months. 
You can stop once your pain levels appear stable and you are feeling better and in more 
control of your response to the pain. You can always start again if your pain worsens, a 
new symptom appears, or you want to track your response to a new treatment. Here are 
more detailed instructions for keeping your Pain Diary.
Instructions
1.	 Record your pain level on the Pain Diary form in Appendix F (see pp. 244–245) 
three times a day at regular intervals—for example, morning, noon, and bedtime. 
(There are smartphone apps as well that can assist with this; see Appendix E, 
“Electronic Resources.”)
2.	Begin each recording by writing the date and time.

	
Beginning to Take Control of Your Pain	
11
3.	 In the space under “Describe situation,” note what activities you were engaged in 
during the previous 4–6 hours. For example, were you watching TV, shopping, 
sitting at a computer, or cleaning the house or garage during that time?
4.	 Rate the intensity of your physical sensation (and its effect on your activities) 
by using the numbers in the following table. Write a one-word description of 
your physical sensation (for example, burning, sharp, achy). Separately, rate your 
emotional response using the numbers in the following table. Write a one-word 
description of your emotional response (for example, angry, frustrated, sad).
The numbers you give to your physical sensation and emotional response do 
not have to increase or decrease together. For example, you can have a high level 
of pain sensation and yet not necessarily suffer emotionally because of it. This 
will become more apparent as you proceed through the book and learn new pain 
management skills. Give ratings on a scale from 0 to 10 as follows:
Rating
Physical sensation/activities
Emotional/negative 
feelings response
0
No painful physical sensation; 
no alteration in activities
No negative emotional 
response
1–4
Low intensity of physical 
sensation; minimal effect on 
activities
Minimal/low level of 
negative emotions (frustrated, 
disappointed)
5–6
Moderate intensity of physical 
sensation associated with 
increased body tension; 
moderate restriction of activities
Moderate intensity of negative 
emotions (anxious, sad, 
irritable)
7–8
Significant pain sensation 
associated with difficulty 
moving; decreased activities
Significant negative emotions, 
making it hard to engage 
in activities (fearful, angry, 
depressed)
9–10
Severe pain sensation associated 
with inability to move; able 
to participate in only minimal 
activities; bedridden
Severe depression, anxiety, 
or despair associated with 
significant impairment in 
thinking
It may take several weeks to establish what the numbers mean for you. This is 
quite normal. Pain is a personal, individual experience, and you’ll only be rating 
your perceptions of that experience. (If you have difficulty, however, see the “Rat-
ing Your Pain” exercise under “Listening to Your Body” in Chapter 4.)
5.	 Record any medication or action you take to help alleviate the pain. For example, 
if you soak in a hot tub, go for a walk, stretch, or take two ibuprofen, record the 
fact.

12	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
6.	 At the end of each day, add the numbers from the three ratings for physical sensa-
tion together and average them by dividing the total by three. You will then have 
one daily physical sensation rating. Do the same for your ratings of emotional 
response. If visualizing information in graphic form is helpful, plot the numbers 
on a graph for the different times of day and for the daily averages. This may help 
you see the pain patterns more clearly over the weeks and months during which 
you develop your program of self-­management.
The Pain Diary is intended for your benefit and self-­exploration. You can 
change its format if that would be helpful. For example, you can record pain in 
two separate areas of the body, or you can record your emotional responses to 
life as well as your emotional responses to pain. The Pain Diary can also be an 
important source of information when you see your health care professional, par-
ticularly when the two of you are tracking symptom flare-ups or your response to 
treatment.
Noting Variations in Your Pain
If you find yourself rating your physical sensation with the same number three times a 
day, 7 days a week, examine your pain more closely. It is common for people in pain to 
think of their pain as overwhelming, unvarying, and unremitting. However, both physical 
sensation and emotional response vary; they rarely remain constant for days and weeks 
at a time. This natural variation is the result of your attention shifting from one thing to 
another. Mood, fatigue, muscle tension, and other factors also influence the pain experi-
ence from moment to moment. The brain is the final judge of sensory input and the center 
of emotional response. It tends to pay the most attention to changing levels of sensation or 
events. It quickly becomes bored with constant sounds, pain, and so forth, whether from 
outside or inside the body. As a result the pain and the awareness of pain will vary as well.
For example, if you go into a room with a fan humming overhead, you may be aware 
of the sound when you first enter; after a short period of time, you will “forget” the 
sound. If the fan shuts off, you may pay attention again, noticing the absence of the sound 
for a few seconds. Likewise, you may not be aware of the pressure of your back against a 
chair as you sit reading this, but now that I’ve pointed it out, you are suddenly aware of 
it. This awareness, too, will disappear after a few seconds as you read on.
You can make use of the brain’s short attention span for constant sensation; it is a 
way of altering the pain experience. Such techniques are discussed in later chapters.
What’s Next?
You are most likely going to feel worse for the next few weeks. You may say, “Oh, no! I 
thought this program was supposed to make me feel better, not worse.” Well, don’t panic 
just yet. This program begins by helping you identify what you have been experiencing, 
both physically and emotionally. If you begin to feel worse, it is not necessarily because 
the disease causing the pain is getting worse; it is more likely because you are bringing 

	
Beginning to Take Control of Your Pain	
13
your pain experience into consciousness. Bringing the pain to the front row of your atten-
tion can alter your sensitivity to it. Remember this for future reference: Changing your 
awareness changes the pain experience.
Many people use denial to cope with their pain. This may work for short-term prob-
lems. Long-term problems usually require conscious solutions or action. Awareness of 
your pain allows you to engage in activities in a way that will not make your pain worse. 
You will be asked to increase your awareness of your daily thoughts, experiences, and 
interactions throughout this program. You will learn how to distract yourself from the 
pain; however, this will be a conscious action, completely under your control, and free 
from any harmful side effects. It is a process that occurs in multiple steps and takes time. 
You are now just beginning the first step.
Setting Goals
People in pain often feel scattered, adrift, unfocused, and unsuccessful. Because pain 
restricts activities, it can become difficult to accomplish anything. No doubt, you find 
yourself unable to do all that you had hoped. When meaningful activity is taken away 
because of chronic pain, you suffer even more. Keeping a Pain Diary is one way to start 
focusing your life; it brings order to this “big unknown” (the pain) and helps you know 
how best to cope with it.
Another way is to set goals—a first step in slowly bringing order, success, and accom-
plishment back to your life. Setting goals will also help you commit to this program. 
But if you are not used to setting goals, it can seem tricky. The key is to set achievable 
goals—that is, goals you can accomplish. This is particularly important when you are 
learning how to live with your pain. You don’t need to feel like a failure any more than 
you perhaps already do. There are ways to set goals so that you cannot fail. When you 
take the goal-­setting process slow and steady, each small success helps you reach higher.
Let’s start by choosing three goals you would like to achieve through working with 
the ideas and exercises in this book. The goals should be short-term ones that can be 
accomplished in 2 to 3 months. Use the following criteria to help develop achievable goals:
Goal-­Setting Criteria
1.	 A goal should be measurable. How will you know when the goal has been accom-
plished?
2.	A goal should be realistic. Is it possible to achieve, even in pain?
3.	 A goal should be behavioral. Does it involve specific actions or steps to take?
4.	 A goal should be “I”-centered. Are you the one engaging in the actions or behav-
iors to be measured?
5.	 A goal should be desirable. Do you want the results enough to put forth the effort?

14	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Cindy’s goal was to feel less stressed in 4 weeks. It sounded reasonable, but what 
exactly did it mean? Was the goal “feeling less stressed” measurable? What was “feel-
ing stressed”? What did she mean by “less stressed”? What did she need to do to 
accomplish the goal? In other words, what specific steps did Cindy need to take? Her 
success would be left to chance if she didn’t answer these questions. And leaving it to 
chance would not guarantee her success; it might even make it unlikely.
Cindy reworked her goal and decided that to her, “feeling stressed” meant feel-
ing muscle tightness in the back of her neck. She wanted to be able to lessen this 
tension. If she could do that, maybe her headaches would be helped too. Now she 
could make a list of what she could do (behaviors) to accomplish her measurable and 
desirable goal—reduce tension in the neck and reduce the number of headaches. She 
would keep track of the number of headaches so she would know when her goal was 
accomplished.
Cindy decided that she would swim three times a week, take a stretch break from 
her work at the computer every hour for 60 seconds (see Chapter 4), and practice a 
relaxation response technique (see Chapter 3) once a day. She thus made her goal 
“I”-centered (she, not someone else, would be taking these steps), behavioral (there 
were specific, clear action steps to take), and realistic (these steps would be relatively 
easy for her to take).
After Cindy had worked toward her goal for a while, she could see for herself 
whether the tension in her neck had decreased and whether this was influencing her 
headaches. Her success was not left to chance but was the result of a conscious effort 
on her part.
Goal-­Setting Exercise
Now write down three pain management goals that you would like to accomplish in the 
next 2 to 3 months. Make them achievable in each of the five ways described above. If 
you don’t yet know what steps to take to accomplish the goals, leave those blank for now; 
come back to them after reading more of this book.
Let’s use Cindy’s goal as an example:

Setting goals now is a way of making a commitment to this self-­management pro-
gram. If you find yourself confused or resistant, ask yourself why. Have you been clear 
enough in defining what you want? Do you want something that you can’t achieve at this 
time? Is there a part—even a small part—of what you want that is achievable? Don’t be 
surprised if you find yourself feeling sad, angry, or frustrated with this exercise, particu-
larly if there are things you wish to do but can’t. It can be very rewarding to be flexible 
and identify other goals that are available to you in spite of the pain. Once again, you do 
have choices. Setting goals is a step toward identifying those options.
Congratulate yourself for having the courage and determination to begin this pro-
cess. You have begun to gain control over your life!
Quick Skill
Overwhelmed by thinking 3 months into the future? How about a quick goal to 
begin? Is there something you are already doing and would like to do more? Maybe 
there are actions you’ve already taken and would like to acknowledge: for example, 
taking a hot shower in the morning or before bedtime, talking to a parent or a friend, 
filling the birdfeeder, or keeping track of the birds that come to it. So simple, no fuss.

Already doing it? Record it! Then see if you can expand the frequency or improve the 
task in some way using the five criteria mentioned on page 13.
Summary
• Taking ownership of your pain is the first step in gaining control over it.
• Recording your pain in the Pain Diary helps you track your physical pain sensation 
and your emotional response.
• Tracking your pain helps you see what increases or decreases it, and this informa-
tion can tell you where your challenges are and help you see how you might solve 
them.
• Acknowledging your pain may make you feel worse—­temporarily. However, you 
can learn to distract yourself consciously from pain.
• Setting achievable goals is important in bringing accomplishment back into your 
life.
• Achievable goals are measurable, realistic, behavioral, “I” centered, and desirable.

Understanding Pain
Pain, like fever, is a symptom. It is also an important and necessary component of the 
human experience. Let’s take a look at some of the various meanings of pain:
• Biologically, pain is a signal that the body has been harmed.
• Psychologically, pain is experienced as emotional suffering.
• Behaviorally, pain alters the way a person moves and acts.
• Cognitively, pain calls for thinking about its meaning, its cause, and possible rem-
edies.
• Spiritually, pain may be a reminder of mortality.
• Culturally, pain may be used to test people’s fortitude or to force their submission.
Pain is an extraordinarily complex process of the body. The pain message is not a 
one-way signal that goes to the brain, and it is more complex than a two-way message. 
Indeed before it even reaches the brain, the pain message may be stopped, exaggerated, 
or reduced. Once the message reaches the brain, it is broadcast to a nerve network that 
is influenced by genetics, decision-­making functions, the stress system, cognitive and 
emotional information, memory, and other sensory and visual inputs. The end result is 
awareness of the pain experience. It may drive us to seek medical attention, add to our 
suffering, or be cancelled out as we focus on an immediate goal—such as escaping from 
a burning building.
Pain can be divided into two major categories—acute and chronic—based on how 
long it lasts.
Acute Pain
Acute pain is time-­limited and lasts long enough for healing to begin, generally from 
hours to weeks. It warns us of tissue injury or harm. Acute pain is associated with 

	
Understanding Pain	
19
physical trauma such as abnormal crushing, stretching, or tearing of tissue. Acute pain 
can also come from tissue irritation or inflammation in response to infection, injury, or 
disease.
Inflammation is the body’s way to fight infection or heal tissue after injury. The nor-
mal inflammation process involves cells in the body that release chemicals that signal the 
nerves, muscles, and blood vessels to begin the healing process.
When you are injured, cells in the damaged area release chemicals that irritate the 
pain nerves, which in turn send their signals to the spinal cord—­whereupon you perceive 
pain. This perception makes you aware of the injury. Other chemicals released by dam-
aged cells cue other responses to injury. Muscle spasms are triggered, which protect the 
area from movement. Blood vessels in the surrounding tissue constrict, reducing bleed-
ing. White blood cells and connective tissue cells start cleaning up and repairing the 
damage.
There are also special pain nerves deep inside the body that detect unusual stretching 
of tissue or blockage of blood flow to vital organs. These sensory nerves alert us to block-
age of the bowels or the blood vessels of the heart or bleeding into the head. These special 
pain nerves connect to the spinal cord close to where peripheral pain nerves also connect. 
As a result, internal pain may be felt first in the arms or legs. For example, arm pain is 
associated with a heart attack, shoulder pain is associated with a gallbladder attack, and 
thigh pain is associated with bladder irritation. Here are some conditions associated with 
acute pain:
• A burn. We touch the hot iron and instantly withdraw the hand. The hot iron has 
stimulated pain receptors in the hand. It is too much heat for the tissue. A reflex 
to move the hand out of harm’s way occurs automatically, and then we rush to the 
sink to run cool water over the burned area.
• Appendicitis. The pain from an infected appendix is a more complicated process 
because it involves inflammation in an internal organ, the appendix. At first the 
person with appendicitis may be aware only of a vague stomachache in the area 
around the belly button. Appetite may decrease or fever may be present. As the 
appendix becomes more inflamed, the pain is localized to the right lower quadrant 
of the abdomen, and the muscles above the appendix spasm. The pain serves as a 
warning that something is wrong and drives a person to search for relief, usually 
through surgical removal of the appendix.
• Labor pains. The pain during childbirth is caused by the stretching of the cervix 
to accommodate the baby’s head and contractions of the uterine muscle. Although 
the pain receptors in the cervix respond to the abnormal stretching, the woman’s 
experience of labor pain can be modified by distraction, massage, and supportive 
coaching as well as by blocking the pain pathways with anesthetics.
• Cancer pain (acute). The pain associated with cancer is usually the result of the 
cancer invading tissues and blocking normal organ functions or pressing directly 
on nerves.

20	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
In all of these examples, pain is a warning symptom that triggers a person to act. 
These actions can be automatic, such as pulling the hand away from a hot iron, or pur-
poseful, such as seeking help. Anxiety and fear are normal emotional responses to pain 
that further motivate a person to seek relief. But the situation in which pain occurs may 
modify these emotional responses. Modified emotions, in turn, can modify the experi-
ence of the pain, as seen in the pain of childbirth.
Acute pain is an important symptom to heed. But once treatment begins, there is no 
advantage to withholding pain relief. Unrelieved pain after surgery can cause complica-
tions such as pneumonia and immobility, and in patients with cancer, it can cause unnec-
essary suffering. Adequate assessment and treatment of acute and cancer-­related pain are 
a major focus of modern institutional medicine.
Chronic Pain
Chronic pain lasts longer than acute pain and is caused by a different set of conditions. If 
the pain has lasted longer than 3 months, it is chronic pain.
At least three conditions are associated with chronic pain and help explain its long 
duration. The first is a painful, underlying chronic disease; the second is damage to the 
pain nerves; and the third involves changes in the brain or spinal cord that control the 
pain message, increasing its presence and duration.
Some chronic pain problems result from diseases that cause chronic inflammation or 
irritation. In diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus arthritis, and osteoarthritis there 
is an ongoing release of irritating substances. These substances trigger acute pain mecha-
nisms but do so in a way that lasts for months and even years. This type of pain may be 
relieved almost completely if the underlying disease responds to treatment; if the joint can 
no longer function without debilitating pain, joint replacement surgery is often successful.
Another cause of chronic pain has become better understood only in the past three 
decades. In this case, chronic pain arises from damage to the pain system itself. Like a 
broken fire alarm that continues to clang when there is no fire, pain may persist long after 
an injury has healed. For example, some diseases, injuries, and cancer drug or radiation 
therapies can cause damage to the pain nerves. There may also be changes that make 
the brain and spinal cord less able to reduce the pain signal. Like a volume control stuck 
on loud, pain may persist because nerve connections in the brain have been rewired in a 
process called “neuroplasticity” (discussed later in the chapter).
The symptom of pain, originally a warning, now becomes the problem. It doesn’t 
go away. When there is damage to the pain system, the pain’s cause may be difficult to 
explain at first. There are often delays in making a diagnosis that can have many biologi-
cal, psychological, and social consequences. Here are some problems associated with pain 
system damage:
• Nerve pain associated with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy)
• Pain after shingles (postherpetic neuralgia)

	
Understanding Pain	
21
• Fibromyalgia
• Chronic pelvic pain
• Chronic bladder pain (interstitial cystitis)
• Postsurgical back pain
Chronic pain may last indefinitely. It may never completely go away, or it may be 
intermittent. With chronic intermittent pain, people may have pain-free weeks or months 
alternating with extended periods of daily pain. Examples include migraine headaches, 
cluster headaches, muscle tension headaches, and irritable bowel syndrome.
The Experience of Chronic Pain
With chronic pain, the pain experience may be magnified because of its long duration with 
no relief. This experience can be influenced by the environment (for example, changes 
in temperature), expectations (“Is this punishment or reward?”), a search for meaning 
(“Why me? What can I learn from this?”), and cultural beliefs (“No pain, no gain”; “This 
pain is a curse”). In short, your perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, and moods greatly affect 
your experience of chronic pain.
Although there may be no clear explanation for your chronic pain, you are under-
standably driven, biologically and psychologically, to resolve the problem. The presence 
of pain and the pressure to act on its presence are established in a very old (in evolution-
ary terms) and primitive part of the brain. When the pain system is doing its job, it is 
a warning of danger and harm. When the system is overloaded or damaged, it can be a 
source of physical and emotional stress. As a result, you may suffer even more symptoms 
(such as fatigue, muscle tension, and insomnia). These additional symptoms are the result 
of the stress you suffer from chronic pain.
For months or years, you have been experiencing the constant stimulus of pain. Bio-
logically, you have had to live with a signal that usually requires the utmost urgency and 
attention. Psychologically, you may feel anxious, depressed, and angry. Behaviorally, you 
may have become less sociable; you may have withdrawn from activities or the company 
of others. Cognitively, you may think yourself inadequate to meet this challenge, or you 
may be at your wits’ end not knowing what to do. Spiritually, you may feel beaten down 
and abandoned. And culturally, you may be fighting beliefs or expectations about how 
you should suffer.
It’s important for you to understand what chronic pain is, what it isn’t, and what we 
think keeps it going. Your enemy is the unknown. Understanding the pain process can 
bring you closer to its mastery. You can begin to do that by keeping a Pain Diary, which 
helps you establish what the pain experience is like for you.
Now that you’ve had a chance to learn a little about acute and chronic pain, take a 
minute to read the following. This is a story common to many who end up with chronic 
pain. See whether you can identify both the acute and chronic phases of the process.

22	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Sarah was a very active 31-year-old English professor who liked to garden, dance, and 
ride horses in her spare time. One day, as she bent to turn her compost pile, she expe-
rienced searing pain down her right leg, causing her to limp as she walked away. She 
took it easy for a week, stopped exercising, and didn’t ride her horse to see whether 
the pain would get better. It didn’t. She then went to her doctor. An examination 
showed that Sarah had lost the reflexes in her right leg, a sign of nerve injury. A com-
puterized axial tomography (CAT) scan revealed a herniated disc in her lower back. 
She was referred to a neurosurgeon, who recommended surgery.
By now Sarah’s pain was constantly sending knife-like sensations into her leg and 
down the calf to her foot. It was impossible for her to find a comfortable position in 
which to sleep, and the constant pain was always on her mind. She had nightmares 
of having surgery and being confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life. She was 
anxious and frightened. She took a medical leave of absence from her job because the 
pain would not allow her to carry out her teaching responsibilities.
Sarah spent another 3 anxious and painful weeks hoping that the pain would 
subside; when it didn’t, she made the decision to have the surgery. It went well, and 
even though Sarah was sore and tight from the incision, her leg was already feeling 
better than it had in weeks. The pain from her incision was made tolerable by pain 
medication. She was able to walk out of the hospital in 3 days, and within 8 weeks she 
was back at work. In addition, she was able to garden, ride her horse, and even dance 
without experiencing pain.
Two months later Sarah began experiencing pain in her right knee, which she 
attributed to a recent hiking trip. Again, she waited for the pain to go away on its 
own. After 2 weeks, she started noticing that she was constantly rubbing her back, 
particularly at the end of the day. Also, she was waking up in the middle of the night 
with painful back spasms. Her anxiety about having another herniated disc created 
more sleep disturbances. She went back to the neurosurgeon, who found nothing 
abnormal upon examination and recommended waiting a few more weeks to see 
whether the pain would improve. But it increased, and Sarah stopped doing anything 
requiring physical effort.
Once again she returned to the neurosurgeon, who performed magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI); this scan revealed nothing abnormal, except for some increased 
scar tissue around the previous surgical (laminectomy) site. Because the scar tissue 
did not appear to press on the nerve roots, her pain would not be helped by an 
operation. The surgeon then asked whether Sarah had been under any stress lately. 
He recommended that she keep busy with her life and suggested that the problem 
would resolve itself in time. Sarah left his office in a daze. By the time she got home, 
her imagination was running wild. “I’m in pain. Why can’t they find something? What 
if they missed something important?” Sarah thought about her aunt, who had had 
back pain and was told nothing was wrong; the aunt eventually died of cancer.
Sarah felt terrified and desperate. She could no longer do normal things around 
the house. Vacuuming was agonizing. Standing or sitting for any extended time was

23
painful. Her patience with her students was becoming short, and she began to miss 
days at work. She was generally too tired to socialize; even when she did, she felt as 
though she was always complaining. After a period of time, her friends stopped call-
ing. She felt exhausted, alone, defective, miserable, and unlovable. She no longer had 
control over her body. The pain was controlling her now.
One day Sarah decided she should be able to do what she needed to do in spite 
of the pain. She was tough; all she needed to do was push through her daily activities. 
She cleaned the house, taught her classes, and took a dozen aspirin that day to help 
keep the pain down. The next morning, she couldn’t get out of bed.
Sarah then went to another surgeon, who ordered a myelogram. The test 
revealed no herniated disc, but the surgeon suggested that stabilizing the spine by a 
fusion would give her relief. Sarah was so desperate that she had the operation. But it 
didn’t work, and the pain just continued. She became even more depressed. By now 
she was unable to work. Her disability insurance supplied some income, but certainly 
not the same as when she was working. Furthermore, the disability insurance repre-
sentatives were harassing her with paperwork, which necessitated more trips to the 
various doctors to fill out the forms. The office staff members made her feel like a 
pest. The doctors never filled out the paperwork on time, and she always panicked at 
the end of the month if the check was late.
Sarah’s family doctor told her to learn to live with her pain and referred her to 
a psychologist, who determined that her response to pain was normal. She agreed, 
but she wanted answers on how to take her pain away. More than anything else, she 
wanted to know why she was in so much pain.
If this story feels familiar to you, you are not alone. Many people with chronic pain 
have experienced similar frustrations. You may have been able to relate to Sarah’s feelings 
about her pain. Were you able to identify the characteristics of acute versus chronic pain 
in this story?
Let’s examine chronic pain once again. Chronic pain can be present either following 
an injury (as in Sarah’s case) or without a specific injury. For example, in disorders such as 
fibromyalgia (see Appendix A), people can experience a waxing and waning of body pain, 
fatigue, and insomnia. Yet there may be no prior injury to explain the pain. For now, the 
diagnosis is made after eliminating other disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, 
or small fiber neuropathy. Today, there is no specific treatment for fibromyalgia—all we 
can do is treat the insomnia and body aches. In the future, with the increasing sophis-
tication of genetic testing, it may be possible to identify genetic variants that can guide 
more specific therapy. However, the experience of this kind of pain is just as complex and 
consuming as the pain that stems from a specific injury.
Whether your pain has a clear explanation or not, the persistence of your symptoms 
has multiple consequences. In fact, feelings of isolation and despair at the loss of physical 
and social activities may have become symptoms in their own right. Without effective 

24	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
ways of responding (called coping skills), you are likely to feel helpless and hopeless. In 
this program, you’ll learn how to strengthen your present coping skills as well as develop 
new ones.
Remember that your experiences are real and normal and that your responses are 
understandable. At the same time, it is possible to do better and to feel better; this is 
where you have the control.
The Processes Involved in Acute and Chronic Pain
Let’s take a closer look at how acute and chronic pain might be created. I’ll describe the 
processes involved and then explain the rationale for treatment.
When your hand touches a hot iron, a sensory message moves to the spinal cord and 
out through the motor nerves to quickly move the hand away; it’s a reflex. Motor nerves 
and sensory nerves are two major types of peripheral nerves. Motor nerves are like elec-
trical wires that connect muscles to their power source: the brain and spinal cord. The 
fast motor reflexes enable us to move our bodies out of harm’s way; they make us recoil 
after touching a hot iron. They can also protect the site of an injury by inducing muscle 
spasms to splint the injured area. Sensory nerves are more like thermostats that send a 
signal to the furnace when the room temperature rises or falls. There are a variety of sen-
sory nerves, and some of them carry pain messages.
The Role of Sensory Nerves in Pain
Under normal circumstances, the sensory nerves that carry pain messages sit quietly until 
an event stimulates them into action. Pain receptors are located all over the body in 
the skin, muscles, joints, and internal organs. They respond to events such as damaging 
extremes of heat and cold, accidental or surgical trauma, and chemical messengers (for 
example, substance P, bradykinin, cytokines) released during injury and inflammation or 
abnormal stretching. Whatever the original cause of the alarm, the pain nerves serve as 
the common pathway for pain information entering the spinal cord.
There are at least two types of sensory nerve fibers thought to carry the majority of 
pain messages to the spinal cord: “A-delta fibers” and “C fibers.” These nerves carry mes-
sages at different speeds.
A common experience may help you to understand this process. Let’s say you hit the 
so-­called funny bone in your elbow (actually, your ulnar nerve). The likely first sensa-
tion is a sharp, tingling pain right where you hit the elbow. This pain sensation probably 
results from the activity of the A-delta nerve fibers. They carry their electrical message to 
the spinal cord at a speed of approximately 40 miles an hour. Usually there is a second 
sensation, more like a vague, poorly localized ache, that spreads slowly up and down the 
inside of your arm. This is thought to result from the activity of C fibers, which carry 
their electrical message at a speed of approximately 3 miles per hour to the spinal cord. 
This difference in rate of speed contributes to the symphony of pain sensations at the time 
of an injury.

	
Understanding Pain	
25
There are other types of sensory nerves that carry sensations besides pain. For exam-
ple, after you hit your elbow, you automatically start to rub the area. This pressure can 
work to soothe the painful area because it stimulates nerves that carry messages at a 
speed of approximately 180–200 miles per hour. These nerves, called A-beta fibers, carry 
pressure and touch messages. They race to the spinal cord to compete for attention with 
the incoming pain messages carried by the C fibers (3 miles per hour) and A-delta fibers 
(40 miles per hour).
Not all sensations are created equal, and you can make use of this fact for pain relief. 
You may have already found it helpful to apply massage, heat (including ultrasound), or 
ice to the painful area, or to use transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or 
acupuncture. Because of the way the nervous system works, these techniques can tempo-
rarily alter or decrease the pain message, depending on the intensity of the pain signal.
Genetic studies are beginning to give insights into how nerves function. Abnormali-
ties have been identified in how genes control the flow of sodium, calcium, and potassium 
influx during the firing of sensory nerves. It is the actual movement of these ions across 
the nerve cell membrane that is responsible for the nerve’s message reaching the spinal 
cord. These abnormalities in gene expression—the way a cell acts on information from 
a gene—can cause a nerve to respond more strongly or to become insensitive to signals, 
such as pain messages. We also know that environment can affect gene expression. Pain 
perception—the conscious awareness and interpretation of pain—is a manifestation of 
how environmental influences (for example, culture, personality, behaviors) can modify 
the end result of the pain message.
The Role of the Spinal Cord in Pain
Once a pain message has made it to the spinal cord as an electrical impulse, a very com-
plicated system acts to send, modify, or cancel the message to the brain. In the spinal 
cord, the receiving nerve cells choose from among the incoming messages before they 
send them forward to the brain. The choice is based on how loud the message is (its 
strength and duration), how many times the same message is received (repetition), and 
the overall number of other competing messages being received. The receiving nerve cells 
can be influenced by chemicals that make the message louder (such as substance P and 
glutamate—­targets of new pain research). They can also be influenced by dampening 
messages sent “downstream” from the brain. Substances such as serotonin, noradrena-
line, and the endorphins (endo = endogenous, orphin = morphine, the body’s own natural 
pain reliever) are involved in reducing or blocking the pain signal. We call this downward 
change in the pain signal modulation. The modulation process helps determine just how 
much of the pain message gets sent to the brain to be acted upon, both physically and 
emotionally. Thus rubbing the painful area or having a supportive spouse present during 
labor and delivery may alter the pain experience.
In patients with fibromyalgia, genetic variants have been identified involving the sero-
tonin (5-HT) receptor and the serotonin transporter, the dopamine 4 receptor, and the 
protein catechol-O-methytransferase. Discoveries such as these lead to the exciting pos-
sibility of understanding fibromyalgia as a number of disorders and not just one. With 

26	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
greater understanding of the pathology comes the possibility of more specific and tar-
geted therapies.
The Role of the Brain in Pain
Once a pain signal makes its way to the brain, the brain responds to the strength, repeti-
tion, and duration of the pain message. The brain gives meaning to the pain message, 
and from meaning springs the emotional response, the source of suffering. But the brain 
is also the source of our ability to learn and to cope. As we saw above, the brain can fire 
impulses down the spinal cord to modulate (dampen) the pain signal. Through connec-
tions within the brain (specifically, the cerebral cortex and limbic system, the “seat” of 
emotions), the pain message becomes a conscious and emotional experience. Up until 
recently we were not able to see where all the electrical and chemical signals went; the 
grimacing, limping, rubbing, and moaning that are the results of pain reaching awareness 
were the only clues for the observer.
In the past decade, with the development of functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI), the black box of brain function in response to painful stimuli has opened and 
become available for study. This sophisticated computerized imaging technique registers 
the changes in blood flow in the brain that vary with nerve activity. When an area of the 
brain is being used to process information, the area lights up on a screen. In pain studies 
multiple areas of the brain light up, but not always in the same location. In other words, 
the brain does not necessarily operate in predictable and permanent pathways. It has 
plasticity—the ability to change by forming new or stronger nerve pathways in response 
to repeated messages. One of the more exciting recent applications of fMRI technology 
is to provide neuroimaging feedback to participants who are learning to modify their 
brain activity in response to pain or even to control their chronic pain. Neuroplasticity 
may also play a role in the development of chronic pain. The role of genes, environmental 
impacts on gene expression, the potential of rewiring of brain circuitry through imaging 
feedback—all pose exciting possibilities for diagnosis and pain treatment.
What Happens in Chronic Pain?
We know that long-­lasting (chronic) pain often comes with diseases that involve long-
term inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis, myositis (muscle inflammation), lupus 
arthritis, and osteoarthritis. These diseases continually set off the acute (normal) pain 
pathways through chronic inflammation. In the case of genetic mutations such as occur 
in primary erythromelalgia, the pain is secondary to an abnormal increase in electrical 
signaling through the sodium channel, secondary to a mutation of Nav1.7, which then 
causes pain with exercise or heat exposure. When such diseases come under control by 
the use of disease-­modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), joint replacement surger-
ies, or drugs such as XEN402 that block sodium channel function, the pain is generally 
modified as well.
Why does pain persist in some people and not in others after an injury or “successful”

surgery? We are beginning to understand that there are multiple mechanisms involved. 
The only consistent predictor of developing chronic pain after an injury is a person’s 
report of an unusually high level of pain during the acute pain episode. Is this intensified 
response due to genetics, environment, or a damaged pain system? We don’t know.
We know from animal and human research that damaged pain nerves can start firing 
spontaneously. They become irritable and noisy, producing pain long after the original 
harm has occurred. Such pain nerve damage can occur as a result of a disease process, 
such as in diabetes, HIV infection, and post-­shingles neuropathy. Nerves can also be 
damaged by some therapies, as in radiation- and chemotherapy-­related neuritis (nerve 
inflammation), and there is evidence now that some of this damage is related to changes 
in the expression of genes because of environmental impacts. Scar tissue that develops 
during healing may also constrict or pinch nerves and damage them.
Damage to pain nerves can be associated with experiencing pain in response to even 
a light touch or with spontaneous sensations of burning, pins and needles, or itching. 
The pain may spread beyond the original site of injury to involve the whole arm or leg. In 
some individuals with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), Type I (see Appendix A), 
other nerve functions may be recruited into the pain process, with abnormal sweating, 
swelling, and blood vessel constriction or abnormal muscle movements in the affected 
limb. Such symptoms reflect multiple processes occurring in both the peripheral nerves 
and the central nervous system.
Indeed, recent research into pain mechanisms has shown that remarkable events 
occur when the spinal cord and brain are bombarded with persistent, high levels of pain. 
Changes take place that magnify, spread, and perpetuate pain. These changes take place 
in areas of the spinal cord where pain is usually processed and modified. This overload 
may cause the nerves to lose their ability to respond to the normal checks and balances 
that serve to dampen pain. Eventually the spinal cord nerves and the brain centers they 
serve may begin to perpetuate the pain signal independently, long after the original injury 
has healed.
Although the complexity may seem overwhelming, this increased level of understand-
ing of what might be causing chronic pain should give hope for future treatments, if not 
cures. Genetic or stem cell research may eventually enable us to predict which individuals 
will develop chronic pain and to treat them. Understanding the plasticity of the brain may 
provide ways to retrain the brain in healthier pain processing. Today there are many ways 
you can triumph over pain by understanding the pain process and doing your part to keep 
the pain at a stable level. This program will show you how.
The Chapter So Far
The first part of this chapter has done the following:
• Described the different parts of the normal pain pathway.
• Described the role of these parts—­peripheral nerves, spinal cord, and brain—in 
chronic pain.

28	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
• Introduced the concepts of genetic expression, neuroimaging, and neuroplasticity 
that are playing important roles in our understanding of pain and that promise 
novel treatments in the future.
• Presented the current thinking about why chronic pain occurs.
With this groundwork laid, we next look more closely at ways to reduce pain by 
treating components of the pain process: inflammation, muscle spasm, nerve irritability, 
mood, and behavior. We will also consider existing treatments for reducing, not curing, 
chronic pain.

1.	 indicate potential treatments (discussed next), and
2.	 clarify areas in need of more explanation or evaluation.
I encourage you to answer the following questions as best you can and then take 
them to your doctor and discuss your responses. A reasonable effort to identify the 
painful disease, whether there is nerve damage or a possible process involving the 
spinal column or brain modulation, will help suggest what treatments are appropriate 
and give you realistic expectations for results.
What is your diagnosis? 	
How does the doctor or specialist explain your pain (for example, failed back syn-
drome, fibromyalgia, diabetic nerve pain)? 	
	
Given what you have just read, what parts of the pain system may be involved in 
your pain experience? 	
What questions do you still have about what’s causing your pain? 	
	
Treatments for Reducing Chronic Pain
There isn’t enough scientific research on many pain treatments to know with certainty 
when and for whom they will help. Pain is a subjective, personal experience, whereas 
scientific research requires a standard definition of what improvement looks like. Even

so, in some areas recommendations can be made based on solid scientific evidence that a 
treatment is effective—at reducing (not curing) chronic pain.
Researchers and clinicians make these evidence-based treatment recommendations 
after systematically evaluating all the research on a given treatment. The conclusions 
they reach on the strength of the evidence are then offered as treatment guidelines. The 
National Guideline Clearinghouse (www.guideline.gov) serves as a global resource for all 
the guidelines that have been produced in this manner. One example of an evidence-based 
guideline is the use of nonsteroidal anti-­inflammatory pain medicine for osteoarthritis 
and is reproduced in Appendix D. Its aim is to assist the consumer in making an informed 
decision where there is no one correct answer. These resources are invaluable when avail-
able. For each treatment discussed in this chapter, I note if there is enough research evi-
dence to support a recommendation.
Don’t be too disappointed when adequate research is not available for a particular 
medication or intervention. This is the case with many, if not most, chronic pain thera-
pies. We are left to carefully monitor the effects of any treatment or intervention the best 
way we can and to be wary of promises of miracle cures or zero side effects until the 
evidence is in.
Reducing Inflammation
In chronic pain conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, the immune process has gone 
haywire, allowing abnormal inflammation to occur. Instead of contributing to a normal 
healing process, it becomes an unregulated source of destruction. Other chronic pain 
syndromes associated with inflammation are lupus arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and 
possibly osteoarthritis. We do not know the extent of inflammation in other chronic pain 
conditions. Micro-­inflammation may be involved, so a trial of anti-­inflammatory agents 
may prove helpful. However, choosing among the many anti-­inflammatory medications 
has become increasingly complex due to issues of safety and cost.
Inflammation is often treated with over-the-­counter medications such as aspirin or 
naproxen. These nonsteroidal anti-­inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) block the effect of 
some of the chemicals released by damaged cells. They can help with mild to moderate 
pain, but they can also have harmful side effects. Possible side effects of NSAIDs include 
the following:
• Longer bleeding times
• Stomach irritation and bleeding
• Colitis (inflammation of the colon)
• “Rebound pain”—for example, the perpetuation of headache pain as a result of 
continuous use of analgesic medication
• Ankle swelling
• Kidney damage
• Increased risk of a heart attack and stroke

30	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Increased risk of heart attack is possible with selective COX-2 inhibitors such as 
celecoxib (Celebrex®) and with older drugs such as ibuprofen (Motrin®, Advil®) at doses 
of 800 mg three times a day and diclofenac (Voltaren®) at 75 mg twice a day. Naproxen 
(Naprosyn®) has recently also been put on the list of potential NSAIDs to increase heart 
attack and stroke risk. If you use aspirin for heart attack or stroke prevention, talk with 
your medical doctor about which anti-­inflammatory you should be taking in addition. 
As mentioned above, Appendix D offers a helpful consumer guide to anti-­inflammatory 
medications, “Managing Osteoarthritis Pain with Medicine”: A Review of the Research 
for Adults.” This guide, as well as other useful information for consumers, is also avail-
able from this website: www.­effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/analgesicsupdate.cfm. Take 
along a copy of the guide when you talk to your physician.
More severe inflammation may be treated with medications that block the immune 
system response. For example, the immunosuppressant drug methotrexate, the tumor 
necrosis factor inhibitors etanercept (Enbrel®) and adalimumab (Humira®), and the cor-
ticosteroid prednisone may be used in rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, or lupus 
arthritis. These medications decrease disease-­producing inflammation and tissue destruc-
tion. They too have many potentially harmful side effects and should be used under care-
ful medical supervision.
Finally, acetaminophen (Tylenol®) has been recommended for mild to moderate pain 
of osteoarthritis for years, but recent reviews and studies find the pain relief in acute back 
pain and osteoarthritis of knee and hip is not as effective as NSAIDs. Many opioid pain 
medications also include acetaminophen. It may have an action in the brain as well as 
in the periphery, but it is not for inflammation treatment. If your experience with acet-
aminophen is satisfactory for reducing pain, however, there is no absolute reason to stop 
if the following cautions are heeded. If you use acetaminophen over the long term, even 
at acceptable doses, then your doctor should monitor you with periodic liver and kidney 
function tests. It can be toxic to the liver if large quantities are taken—doses greater than 
3,000–4,000 mg per day. Note: It is easier than you may think to take acetaminophen in 
large quantities because it is included in so many cold, flu, sleep, allergy, and pain prepa-
rations. It is important to read the labels to see how much additional acetaminophen you 
are getting if you take such over-the-­counter medicines regularly.
Take a moment to answer the following questions:
What anti-­inflammatory medications do you use, if any? Include any over-the-­counter 
brands. 	
	
What possible side effects have you experienced? 	
	
If you use these medications daily, has your kidney and liver function or blood count 
been tested in the past year?        If not, you should discuss this with your doctor.

Reducing Muscle Spasms
Some pain conditions are marked by muscle spasms. The muscles may become tight as 
a result of nerve irritation, reflexive guarding of a painful area, or generalized tension. 
Therefore, muscle relaxants (for example, orphenadrine [Norflex®], cyclobenzaprine 
[Flexeril®]) are often prescribed to relax or loosen the muscles.
Scientists think these medications work primarily on the brain, except for diazepam 
(Valium®), which also has a direct effect on skeletal muscles. With many of these medi-
cations, it is unclear how much of the relaxation is due to the brain’s “relaxing” and 
how much is due to the skeletal muscles’ relaxing. People often feel drowsy or sedated 
or have poor concentration when taking muscle relaxants because of their effect on the 
brain. Taking such medication long term is probably not helpful unless your problem is 
associated with spasticity (jerky, spastic movements), and even then medications such 
as baclofen (Lioresal®) or tizanidine (Zanaflex®) may be more helpful. Abnormal liver 
function has been observed on occasion with tizanidine, dantrolene (Dantrium®), and 
chlorzoxazone (Parafon Forte®).
Researchers have examined the evidence on use of muscle relaxants and have found 
that the benefits tend to outweigh the harm when they are used for limited treatment of 
chronic pain flare-ups and acute low back pain.
Other methods used to release muscle tension and reduce spasm include the follow-
ing:
• Muscle massage (may improve pain and function compared to sham and other 
active treatments)
• Acupuncture (research supports short-term benefits for low back pain, but effects 
on function are unclear)
• Application of heat or ice
• Injection of local anesthetics, saline, or steroids into tender areas of muscle or soft 
tissue called “trigger points” (effect on low back pain not supported by research)
• Relaxation techniques
• Body awareness training
• Gentle stretching
The last three techniques are addressed in detail in the next two chapters. Research 
shows that all are likely to help chronic low back pain when part of an intensive, multi-
disciplinary program.

Reducing Pain Nerve Irritability
As mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, some of the most exciting developments 
in understanding pain are in the study of genes that control nerve function. The nerves 
are stimulated to fire, or not, by chemical messages received at their endings. If the mes-
sage is excitatory, it is carried down the length of the nerve in a sequential electrical wave 
produced by sodium, potassium, or calcium molecules moving through ion channels in 
the wall of the nerve cell. A genetic mutation or abnormal gene expression can disrupt, 
increase, or modify this flow of information, thereby altering the pain message. Such find-
ings from genetic studies suggest new ways of controlling the pain message that might be 
used for future drug development.
Understanding how ion channels control nerve function and how chemical messen-
gers (such as serotonin, noradrenaline, and GABA—gamma aminobutyric acid B) trans-
mit and alter the pain message provide the rationale for using certain anti-­seizure, antide-
pressant, and muscle relaxant medications in pain management. However, what appears 
to be beneficial to a majority of individuals in any research study is still not a benefit to 
all. The very complexity of the pain system is in part responsible for the lack of any uni-
versal medication recommendation. We are still unable to assess what will work and how 
well prior to the person taking a pill. The research provides a rationale for drug choice 
and dosing, and it is helpful if you can assess the results objectively—an activity that is 
helped by keeping your Pain Diary. I say more about this later.
Medications may be used to alter pain nerve irritability in the body (peripheral 
nerves) and in the central nervous system (spinal cord and brain). Many of these medica-
tions are used “off label”; that is, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) origi-
nally approved them for use in diseases or syndromes other than chronic pain. Because 
the actual way most drugs work is not completely understood, clinicians are given some 
flexibility to use medications off label if there is a sound rationale for trying them. Drugs 
with off-label use for chronic pain include tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitripty-
line (Elavil®), imipramine, and nortriptyline. Baclofen, a muscle relaxant that stimulates 
GABA receptors, is used by some for nerve pain. Evidence exists that amitriptyline helps 
some people with chronic pain, but the FDA still does not approve it specifically for that 
purpose.
Several anti-­seizure medications have received FDA approval for use in neuropa-
thies (dysfunctional nerves). Gabapentin (Neurontin®) is approved for neuropathic pain 
and post-­shingles neuropathy; carbamazepine (Tegretol®) for trigeminal (facial sensory 
nerve) pain; clonazepam (Klonopin®) for neuralgia; and pregabalin (Lyrica®) for diabetic 

	
Understanding Pain	
33
neuropathy, post-­shingles neuropathy, spinal cord injury associated neuropathic pain, 
and fibromyalgia. Tiagabine (Gabitril®) and phenytoin (Dilantin®) are used off label for 
pain but are not first choices because of lack of evidence that they are effective. Dulox-
etine (Cymbalta®), an antidepressant medication, is approved for fibromyalgia, diabetic 
neuropathy, and musculoskeletal pain. Milnacipran (Savella®) is approved for the treat-
ment of fibromyalgia.
Zostrix® is an ointment made from the active ingredient in red chili peppers (capsa-
icin). This substance causes an influx of sodium and calcium into the pain receptors of the 
skin. It is used for pain associated with diabetes, shingles, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid 
arthritis but is limited in acceptance because of the burning it causes before pain relief 
can occur. Evidence shows an inconsistent benefit at low doses 0.1% capsaicin or less. 
High-dose capsaicin 8% (Qutenza®) is available and approved for post-­shingles nerve 
pain; however, it should be given under the supervision of a physician to assure comfort 
during and immediately after the 60-minute application, given every 3 months. A patch 
saturated with 5% lidocaine (Lidoderm®) can be applied directly to the skin of those suf-
fering from post-­shingles pain, but again the evidence supports individual effectiveness 
that cannot be predictably reproduced.
Injections of steroids and nerve blocks with an anesthetic-like substance have been 
used to quiet the firing of irritable nerves. Reviews of studies of lumbar epidural steroids 
under fluoroscopic X-ray guidance show strong evidence for short-term benefit (less than 
6 months) in reducing pain and increasing function and moderate evidence for long-term 
benefits. Other local injections for low back pain have not yet demonstrated effectiveness. 
Facet joint injections are considered ineffective and possibly harmful. Nerve destruction 
(radiofrequency neurotomy) of lumbar facets has good evidence supporting pain relief, 
but not so in the neck (fair evidence) and thoracic areas (limited evidence).
Electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerves, spinal cord, and brain to override the 
pain messages has been used to reduce chronic pain. There are positive benefits of spinal 
cord electrical stimulation in failed back surgery syndrome and CRPS, Type I. To date, 
noninvasive brain stimulation has failed to give sufficient results to warrant recommenda-
tion. Outcomes for peripheral nerve stimulation remain difficult to predict for a variety 
of chronic pain syndromes.
With continuing research to help us understand what makes pain chronic, new medi-
cations and therapies will become available. The hope is that better tools will make path-
ways that perpetuate chronic pain visible so that rewiring that pain network is possible. 
We may be able to predict chronic pain and prevent it by blocking abnormal gene expres-
sion or promoting normal gene expression. It is a worldwide effort.
Take a moment to answer the following questions about your treatment:
Are you taking medications to quiet nerve irritability?        If so, what are they?

What are the possible side effects? 	
	
What other treatments have you tried to quiet the irritable nerves? 	
	
Helping the Brain Help You
As mentioned before, the brain can both raise and lower the “loudness” of pain messages. 
A great many internal and external events influence which direction the brain will take. 
Insomnia, depression, anxiety, and alcohol dependence hurt the ability of the brain to 
function well. They can make the pain experience worse; preventing or reversing them 
can do the opposite.
Help for Insomnia
Insomnia or poor sleep quality can make the experience of pain more difficult. We need 
sleep for good health, but just how sleep refreshes and repairs the body remains largely 
unknown. Many problems, including pain, can be made worse by poor sleep.
People in pain who have sleep disorders are often treated with low doses of tricyclic 
antidepressants such as amitriptyline or imipramine. These medications help with sleep 
because they tend to produce drowsiness, although some people need to take them up to 
4 hours before bedtime. In very low dosages these medications also appear to alter pain 
sensitivity in some disorders. The exact way they do this is unknown, but some change 
in norepinephrine and/or serotonin levels in the brain or spinal cord has been suggested. 
Remember that serotonin is one of the pain-­suppressing chemicals in the brain and spinal 
cord mentioned earlier. In addition, serotonin is believed to play a role in depression. This 
may be why the older tricyclic antidepressants and the newer ones such as duloxetine 
can improve both depression and some chronic pain syndromes. Use of sleeping pills for 
long-term insomnia (for example, zolpidem [Ambien®] or lorazepam [Ativan®]) is not 
healthy or effective for sleep or pain. There is evidence that their continued use may cause 
memory loss.
There are other ways you can help yourself sleep better. Going to bed and waking up 
at the same time every day is important. If naps are necessary, sleep only for 30–45 min-
utes. Take a hot shower or bath about 2 hours before bedtime; this will raise your body 
temperature, and the cooling down afterward can help trigger sleep. If you’ve been trying 
to fall asleep (or go back to sleep) for more than 30 minutes, get up and do something 
until you feel sleepy again. Often people become anxious as they lie in bed with their eyes 
wide open. Continuing to struggle with sleep simply makes it less likely. The relaxation 
techniques described in the next chapter are particularly helpful if you practice them 
before you go to bed or if you wake up during the night. Some have found that tracking 

	
Understanding Pain	
35
their sleep patterns using personal tracking devices, such as Fitbit®, Jawbone®, or smart-
phone apps, is helpful in identifying some of the problem areas.
If your insomnia is associated with snoring, sleep apnea (periods of not breathing 
while asleep), or excessive daytime drowsiness, it may be helpful to make an appointment 
with a sleep disorders clinic. Treatment can be very helpful in these disorders.
Help for Depression and Anxiety
Many people with chronic pain experience depression and anxiety, and these feelings 
can change the pain experience for the worse. People who experience significant depres-
sion in addition to pain usually feel helpless and powerless. Anxiety makes people with 
pain even more frightened by their loss of control, and they have a heightened level of 
tension. It is important to treat these conditions. Bringing disabling depression and anxi-
ety (such as panic attacks) under control may require medication. There is evidence that 
the antidepressant duloxetine can help in the pain syndrome fibromyalgia and in diabetic 
neuropathy, for which it is approved by the FDA. Short-­acting benzodiazepines, such 
as alprazolam (Xanax®) and lorazepam, are suited for short-term use for brief bouts 
of anxiety but not for pain treatment. Long-term use can have negative results without 
careful evaluation and a comprehensive treatment plan that includes non-drug-­related 
treatment as well. I say more about coping with depression and anxiety in Chapters 5 
and 6.
Reducing Use of Alcohol
Alcohol, an old remedy for acute pain, may temporarily change pain perception, but it 
does little to help with long-term coping, because nothing really changes. Alcoholism can 
be an additional complication of self-­medicating pain with alcohol. In some cases, alco-
hol consumption before bedtime can actually disrupt sleep. Moreover, in certain people 
(particularly those prone to headaches or fibromyalgia), alcohol use can increase pain. A 
source of empty calories with no nutritional value, alcohol can contribute to weight gain. 
You will have the opportunity to explore how alcohol affects your pain in Chapter 7.
Take a moment to answer the following questions:
Do you have a drink from time to time to relieve your pain? 	
Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking? 	
Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? 	
Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking? 	
Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning (an “eye-­opener”) to steady your 
nerves or to get rid of a hangover? 	

36	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
If you have more than two “yes” answers, there is a high likelihood that you have a 
problem with alcohol. Seek help from your doctor, therapist, or someone else you trust. 
Talk to him or her about it. Chronic pain is bad enough—­excessive alcohol use could 
harm you even more.
Using Narcotics (Opioids) and Marijuana (Cannabinoids) in Chronic Pain
There are natural opioids, called endorphins, found in the body that bind to the body’s 
opioid receptors. There are also natural endocannabinoids in the body with properties 
similar to the substances found in marijuana. These endocannabinoids have diverse func-
tions and are found throughout the body. Marijuana has been used for medical treat-
ment, including pain relief, for centuries. There are a few studies that show it moderately 
decreases nerve pain, but it has a considerable number of adverse side effects such as 
dizziness and cognitive impairment that may limit its benefit. Currently, marijuana is still 
considered an illegal substance by federal law, but some states have legalized its posses-
sion and use for medical purposes. Where legal, marijuana comes in multiple prepara-
tions, but standardization of potency and dosing is lacking. Efforts to isolate the active 
ingredients specific to pain relief are limited by the drug’s classification as a Schedule I 
narcotic. This makes it very difficult to obtain samples and study in the research lab. 
Dronobinol®, a synthetic derivative of the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) found in mari-
juana, has been used as an appetite stimulant and anti-­nausea medicine, but it does not 
provide pain relief. Cannibidiol (CBD), another derivative from marijuana, does not have 
the euphoria-­inducing properties that come from smoking or ingesting the herb. It has 
been of interest because of its potential anti-­inflammatory and pain modulation proper-
ties. The evidence of a benefit from using marijuana to treat chronic pain is limited at 
this time. Its subjective reports of benefit may be due to any one of the 450 compounds 
present in the herb that affect pain, emotion, and cognitive processes. It has side effects, 
and it can be abused.
“Opioid” is the more accurate term for opium-like medicines such as morphine, oxy-
codone (Percocet®), and hydrocodone (Vicodin®). The response to opioids for pain treat-
ment is influenced by multiple factors, including genetics. For example, the majority of 
opioids bind to “mu receptors” and initiate their effect. Studies have identified differences 
in how the opioid mu receptor gene, OPRM1, is expressed. These differences may explain 
variations in patient responses to opioid medication in both dosing and effectiveness. In 
the future, routine genetic testing may help individualize opioid dosing during postopera-
tive care, acute pain episodes, or during cancer therapy.
In the last decade, the abuse and illegal diversion of prescription opioids has become 
a public health crisis. The problem has shaped the discussion of what is the most effica-
cious and safe use of opioids in the treatment of chronic pain. In addition, addiction from 
chronic use of opioids is now seen as a far bigger issue than previously realized. The cur-
rent trend is to use opioids judiciously for short-term functional improvements in chronic 
pain. Long-term effectiveness in nonspecific pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia, head-
ache, or low back pain has not been shown. Opioids can have their place in helping some

37
people reach their goals of living more fully and functioning; the goal of use should be 
increased activity. There is no evidence to support long-­acting versus short-­acting opioids 
in improving functioning or reducing side effects or addiction. Although there is weak 
evidence for long-term chronic pain reduction with continuing opioid therapy, the effect 
on improved functioning or quality of life is not known.
An addiction is more likely if you or a biologically related family member has a his-
tory of alcoholism or substance abuse, but you may also be predisposed and not know 
it. Addiction is a complicated disorder that may be genetically determined but that also 
has a strong environmental component to its development as well. It is defined as a con-
tinuing use of a substance (opioids, alcohol, even food) in spite of physical, psychologi-
cal, or social harm to the user. Risks for opioid abuse or aberrant use and addiction are 
cumulative. Risk factors include age between 16 and 45; family or personal history of 
substance abuse or alcohol or prescription drug abuse; history of preadolescent sexual 
abuse in females; and presence of psychological disorders such as attention deficit, bipo-
lar, obsessive–­compulsive, or depressive disorder, as well as schizophrenia.
The risk of addiction with opioids prescribed for chronic pain of uncertain cause 
poses challenges for both doctors and patients. I see no resolution to the question of effec-
tiveness in chronic pain syndromes until we have more biological knowledge about addic-
tion and chronic pain. In the interim, it’s best to be evaluated and treated by a physician 
with chronic pain treatment experience before opioids are prescribed long term.
The goal of opioid treatment in chronic pain is not to be pain-free, because that 
doesn’t happen; the goal is to have more tolerable pain so that you can do more. The 
American Pain Society and the American Academy of Pain Medicine (organizations of 
professional pain specialists) both endorse the careful use of opioids for chronic pain 
when the other treatments we have already reviewed fail to provide adequate pain con-
trol. People with no history of drug abuse have fewer problems when one physician (usu-
ally the patient’s primary care physician) prescribes a constant dose of opioids taken on a 
regular schedule or under specific circumstances, such as starting a new exercise regime 
or traveling. All opioid therapy in the treatment of chronic pain should start as a trial 
with periodic reassessment to evaluate pain levels and function.
There are multiple preparations of opioids. Long-­acting, time-­released versions are 
available for morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl and 
tend to provide a constant blood level of medication. Methadone is an inexpensive, long-­
acting opioid alternative to the time-­released opioids. It can decrease the pain in neu-
ropathic conditions. CAUTION: There have been an increasing number of deaths due 
to using and misusing methadone and other long-­acting, time-­released opioids. Recent 
evidence suggests that methadone may be associated with rare but fatal arrhythmias 
(irregular heartbeats). In addition, the slow metabolism of methadone mandates that 
increases in dose be made carefully over many days to weeks. Avoid mixing methadone 
with other opioids, particularly in the early period of dose adjustments. You could die if 
you add long-­acting opioid preparations too quickly or increase the dosing above what 
has been prescribed.
Tramadol resembles both morphine and tricyclic antidepressants. It binds weakly to 

38	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
morphine receptors and acts like amitriptyline in the central nervous system. It is now 
classified as a narcotic or Schedule IV controlled substance.
It is important that you discuss any side effects (nausea, constipation, drowsiness) 
of opioid treatment with your health care professional. These side effects can be treated 
effectively—and they should be—if the opioid is making a significant difference in your 
pain control and function.
If you use a prescribed opioid, you have responsibilities. You should take the opioid 
only as directed, receive the opioid from one physician and one pharmacy, and report 
side effects promptly. Do not stop the drug abruptly or you risk having withdrawal symp-
toms. You should also use caution in the first few weeks of dose adjustments, because 
you may have difficulty thinking and using good judgment, and have a slower reaction 
time. When using an opioid, you are also responsible for using other pain management 
skills such as those described in this book. Those skills reduce the amount of opioid you 
need. You will have less pain overall and need less opioid if you can attend to the other 
symptoms associated with chronic pain, such as insomnia, anxiety, muscle tension, and 
fatigue. Often opioids are misused in people with chronic pain because they lack the 
skills to cope with pain in any other way. Problems may develop when pain medications 
are taken to “relax,” to induce sleep, to decrease the fear of anticipated pain increases, 
to reduce stress-based symptoms, or to alleviate frustration. These purposes are better 
served by using pain management techniques such as those described in the chapters that 
follow.
If you or someone you know is taking daily opioids, you should be aware that the 
drug naloxone reverses the effects of an opioid overdose and is available for emergency 
use by a friend or family member. Your physician should be able to give you a prescrip-
tion for this medication. A dose of 0.4 mg of naloxone in 1 cc, injected intramuscularly in 
the shoulder or thigh or administered through a nasal spray, should reverse the effects of 
an overdose. The dosage can be repeated in 3 minutes after calling 9-1-1 if the overdosed 
individual does not respond. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be necessary if 
the person is unresponsive, not breathing, or does not have a pulse.
If you take opioids on a daily basis and anticipate any surgery, you will most likely 
need additional opioids for postsurgical pain control. After surgery you will need your 
daily dose of opioids plus as much as two to three times more than a person who is not 
taking opioids daily. Many doctors and nurses are not aware of this increased dosage 
requirement, so before surgery it is important for you to discuss the postoperative pain 
treatment with the anesthesiologist or surgeon who will be working with you. Likewise, 
should you have a new painful injury or condition, such as a bone fracture or kidney 
stones, you would also need additional opioids. These increases in opioids should not be 
required for more than the average recovery period.
There are many patients whose pain does not improve with opioids. They find that 
the pain does not really change that much on or off the medication. They may even feel 
better once the opioid is tapered and stopped. We don’t know the long-term effects of 
opioid treatment for chronic pain, although sexual dysfunction and impotence have been

described in men. Increased pain with continued use of opioids (hyperalgesia) has been 
described but is poorly understood in terms of mechanisms or specific treatment. A pain 
specialist may be able to help you decide what is best for you.
Take a moment to answer the following questions:
Are you taking antidepressants for depression or anxiety? 	
Are you taking opioids? 	
What treatments do you use for side effects? 	
	
Are you using any other medications for pain management that haven’t been men-
tioned here?        If so, what are they? 	
	
Do you understand why these medications have been recommended? 	
 
If not, where can you get this information? 	
	
Make a Medication List—It Can Save Your Life!
Most people with chronic pain take medication. It is important for you to know what 
you are taking, why you are taking it, and if it’s working. Because a treatment can work 
for one person and not another, it is very important to be able to report your experience 
with each treatment. Keeping your Pain Diary will help you do this. Keeping a list of 
your medications will also help—and what’s more important, it can save your life! (See 
the blank worksheet in Appendix F, p. 246, which can also be downloaded from www.
guilford.com/managepain, and the sample on p. 40.)
Making a medication list is one of the exploration tasks at the end of this chapter, but 
it’s so important I want to mention it here as well. I urge you to complete it, carry it with 
you at all times, and keep it updated. Put all of your medications on the list, including 
over-the-­counter and herbal medications and vitamins. A comprehensive list is particu-
larly critical for individuals who take more than five medications per day. The current 
health care system is fragmented, although the availability of an electronic medical record 
is improving transfer of information. If the medication list is inaccurate in your medical 
record, it will do you no good. Be accurate and honest about what you are really taking 
so that harm to you can be minimized. Until we have a foolproof way for disseminating 
prescription drug information to all those who give you care, you will be safer if you can 
give your health care providers an accurate medication list.

The Meanings of Pain
Despite what we do know about pain, the fact remains that we are not able to take away 
chronic pain for the millions who suffer with it. The good news is that the suffering is 
optional.
Cultural Infl uences on Attitudes toward Pain
The way pain is treated in the Western hemisphere is strongly infl uenced by Western cul-
ture, and a booming pharmaceutical industry has had a sweeping effect on our attitudes 
toward pain treatment. The emphasis is on “quick fi xes” and the use of medications for

all our problems. There is much less emphasis on what patients can do for themselves to 
make their lives healthier and happier. Medicine does not have all the answers. The erro-
neous impression that it does is pervasive. David Morris comments on this in his book 
The Culture of Pain:
Today our culture has willingly, almost gratefully, handed over to medicine the job of 
explaining pain. This development, accelerating with the prestige of science over the last 
several centuries, has brought with it consequences that remain almost completely unan-
alyzed. . . . Although almost all eras and cultures have employed doctors, never before 
in human history has the explanation of pain fallen so completely to medicine. (p. 19)
There is no way of knowing an individual’s experience of pain, nor is there an effec-
tive drug for each of the troubles we might experience. We can’t wait for the definitive 
answers; we must have some way to manage symptoms now, in spite of our incomplete 
knowledge, and solutions shouldn’t be limited to drugs or medical procedures. However, 
many people don’t realize that “medicine knows all” is only a cultural expectation, not 
a fact. They have not had the opportunity to explore the various influences on their pain 
experiences. This book and the program it describes will help you explore the multiple 
meanings of pain. It will help you see that adopting different attitudes toward pain is pos-
sible and can be very helpful.
Exercise: Exploring the Meanings of Pain
Here’s a helpful exercise to explore how your pain has affected your activities, physical 
responses, thoughts, and feelings. Don’t be surprised or alarmed if your responses to 
these questions cause you sadness, anger, or anxiety. This exercise will help you start to 
assess the full cost of your pain experience. It will also help you begin to recognize inef-
fective ways of coping, so that you can replace them with more effective ones from the 
chapters to come.
1.	 How has your pain affected how you work, play, and perform other activities?
	
	
	
	
	
2.	 Besides the pain, what other physical symptoms do you experience (for example, insom-
nia, fatigue, muscle tension)?

3.	 What are your thoughts and feelings in response to your pain experience? 	
	
	
	
	
	
4.	 What does being in pain mean to you? 	
	
	
	
	
	
Please do the above exercise before continuing. It will help you understand what fol-
lows.
When I have patients do this exercise, the board is filled with the real consequences 
of their daily pain. Samples of these responses are given in the table opposite. It is obvious 
from looking at the list that people with chronic pain are very courageous to continue with 
their lives in spite of their suffering. For most, all aspects of their lives have been affected, 
and though it has been difficult, they have done the best they can. What becomes striking 
during the discussion that follows the exercise, however, is that for most of these people, 
only their physical pain has been the focus of their medical treatment. The other parts of 
their pain experience—­emotions, thoughts, and behaviors—have largely been ignored.
The False Division of Mind and Body
Much of the suffering you have identified in the previous exercise arises out of a com-
mon misunderstanding in Western culture that there is a division between mind and 
body. This division is reinforced daily. Medical doctors take care of our bodies, and psy-
chologists or psychiatrists take care of our minds. Our hearts are looked after by heart

specialists, our stomachs by stomach specialists, and so on. In the last 20 years there has 
been a growing discontent with such fragmented perspectives of our bodies and minds. 
Such terms as “behavioral medicine” and “holistic medicine” have been used to describe 
the integration of mind and body in medical practice.
The division between mind and body is a false one. Nowhere is that fallacy more 
obvious than in dealing with chronic pain. The experience of pain is a coming together 
of many personal factors, such as the following:
• The pain signal
• Expectations of yourself and of others
• Self-­esteem
• Ability to function
• Mood
• Hormones

• Genetics
• Previous traumas
• Injustices and beliefs
• Coping styles
It is not in your best interest to deny these influences on your pain or to act as if 
nothing is wrong. If you deny the pain, push on, and regularly do things that increase the 
pain, you only make your condition worse. Even if the consequences aren’t immediate 
(you can’t get out of bed the next day), they are cumulative (increased stress symptoms). 
Taking this path sets you up for endless frustration and loss of control.
However, pretending that nothing is wrong is not the same as making a conscious 
decision to take action for a particular purpose, knowing that increased discomfort will 
follow. For example, Mary wanted to take her granddaughter to the circus. She knew that 
sitting through the performance would increase her pain. She prepared herself with an 
extra cushion and sat in the back row so that she could stand periodically. Her pain did 
increase, but she was not upset because she felt it worth the effort, and her granddaughter 
was thrilled. The activity was her choice, and it was under her control.
The key is to ask, “Where do I have control?” If you can acknowledge your pain and 
make conscious decisions about your activities, you will not feel so victimized. As one 
patient said, “If I sit, I’m in pain. If I walk, I’m in pain. So I might as well walk and get 
somewhere.” If the pain is part of your life, it is important to work with it; this is where 
you have the control.
You probably feel a fair amount of external pressure to act as if nothing is wrong 
and to ignore what you know to be necessary. You can change your attitude toward your 
pain, increase your activities safely, and have a life in addition to the pain. The rest of this 
book will help you do just that.
The misunderstandings that arise out of the separation of mind and body are not lim-
ited to people who actually experience chronic pain. Many physicians refuse to acknowl-
edge that physical pain is associated with psychological suffering. This refusal gives rise 
to the “psychological illness” stigma. When people express sadness or anxiety about their 
pain, others often assume that these emotional symptoms are the cause of their pain. There 
is a tendency to label such people as “hysterics” or “hypochondriacs” or to dismiss the 
problem as “not real” (that is, not physical). Many individuals experience this uncertainty 
when an explanation, a diagnosis, or a reason cannot be given for their persistent pain.
Likewise, the failure to address psychological and social issues early in the course 
of pain treatment devalues these important aspects of the pain experience. Skills such 
as relaxation techniques are usually offered only after a patient has “failed” to respond 
to medications or nerve blocks. Pain management training for health care professionals 
is still focused on medications and interventions. Mind–body approaches to pain man-
agement have been overlooked not because they are ineffective but because they remain 
unknown to the majority of those providing treatment. They are also not the quick fix 
that so many Americans demand.

So what is the problem? And whose problem is it, anyway? The problem is, of course, 
that you have pain, and it is not going away. In keeping with the philosophy of this pro-
gram, I strongly recommend that you acknowledge the problem is yours, since you are the 
one in pain. If you hand it over to your physician, family, or society, you simply lose the 
opportunity to have some control over it.
Where Do You Go from Here?
In the following chapters, the physical symptoms that you have identified in the previous 
exercise are addressed through a series of skills and techniques aimed at reducing stress. 
These symptoms reveal the wear and tear on the body from prolonged pain and the fail-
ure to heed the mind–body, body–mind connection. Techniques such as the relaxation 
techniques, breath exercises, stretching, and body awareness exercises will help you nur-
ture your body and counteract the stress symptoms.
You have also identified decreases in your physical and social activities, along with 
increased isolation. To address these symptoms, you will learn to monitor the way you 
pace yourself during an activity, to interpret your pain sensations, and to add pleasurable 
activities and exercise to your regular routine.
You have also begun to identify negative, self-­defeating thoughts and feelings. Cog-
nitive therapy techniques will help you examine how this negative self-talk distorts 
what is really happening around you. You will learn how to be more realistic and self-­
empowering. Humor will be used to soften the hard work and the slow pace at which real 
change proceeds. Communication skills will encourage self-­esteem and the assertiveness 
required to identify your needs. Improving your problem-­solving abilities in regard to the 
challenges of pain will allow you to participate fully in society once again and to achieve 
the goals you set for yourself.
Summary
Pain
• Pain is a symptom that indicates harm to the body.
• Pain is a complex process that can be changed for better or worse by people’s per-
ceptions.
• There are two categories of pain based on how long it lasts:
 Acute pain is time-­limited and its cause is usually known. Cancer can cause 
acute pain, but its duration can be longer than other kinds of acute pain.
 Chronic pain is pain that lasts longer than 3 months. Its exact cause may not 
be known. Chronic pain can be the result of painful chronic diseases, nerve 
damage, or the loss of the normal checks and balances involved in modulating 
pain signals in the brain or spinal cord.

46	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
• The pain response pathway is like a complex interstate with multiple exits and 
entrances: Sensory nerves carry pain signals to the spinal cord, where they can be 
reduced, heightened, or cancelled. Motor nerves carry motor reflexes from the spi-
nal cord to the muscles. When the pain signals move up to the brain, they become 
conscious, are given meaning, and reacted to emotionally. Both the situation and 
the environment influence the pain experience. The brain sends impulses down the 
spinal cord that can heighten, modulate, or cancel the pain message.
Sensory Nerves
• Pain nerves are stimulated by extremes of hot or cold, trauma, or chemicals released 
during inflammation.
• Two types of sensory nerves carry pain messages to the spinal cord:
 A-delta fibers carry the pain messages at approximately 40 miles per hour.
 C fibers carry pain messages at approximately 3 miles per hour.
• Other sensory nerves carry pressure and touch. These are A-beta fibers, which 
travel at approximately 180 miles per hour. Rubbing or applying pressure can 
reduce some pain.
• Pain is created, modulated, and controlled by extraordinarily complex mechanisms 
involving multiple pathways in the brain and spinal cord.
• Chronic pain may develop when there is a painful chronic disease, when an injured 
pain nerve is damaged and attempts to regenerate, or when there are changes in the 
pain nerve modulation system.
• Changes in pain pathways, due to neuroplasticity, may occur. With neuroimaging 
the opportunity to rewire aberrant pain pathways may be possible.
• The genetics of pain will teach us more about pain mechanisms, pain disorders, 
and target treatments.
Inflammation
• Inflammation is a process that fights infection or cleans up and repairs tissue dam-
age.
• When inflammation occurs, cells in the body release chemicals that signal the pain 
nerves, muscles, and blood vessels to begin damage control.
Muscles
• Muscle spasm or tightness can guard a painful area. Nerve irritation and general-
ized tension can also lead to muscle spasm.
• Muscle relaxants are thought to work primarily in the brain to loosen the muscles, 
so they have side effects such as drowsiness.

	
Understanding Pain	
47
The Spinal Cord and Brain
• There is competition among the sensory nerve messages as they come into the spi-
nal cord; not all pain messages get attention.
• Messages sent downstream from the brain can reduce or block pain signals.
• The brain gives meaning to the pain message.
• Sleep problems, depression, anxiety, and alcohol dependence can all lead to poor 
brain functioning and make the pain experience more difficult.
Treatments
• There is little evidence to support the effectiveness of many treatments used for 
chronic pain, but evidence-based treatment guidelines make an effort to interpret 
what the research tells us.
• Sometimes medications are effective in calming irritated nerves.
• Inflammation is treated with anti-­inflammatory medications such as aspirin or 
naproxen. These drugs block the effects of some of the chemicals released during 
inflammation.
• Treatments to release muscle tension and prevent spasm include massage, acupunc-
ture, heat or ice application, trigger point injections, relaxation techniques, and 
body awareness training.
• Muscle relaxants are best used for limited treatment of short-term chronic pain 
flare-ups or acute low back pain.
• Recommendations for good sleep include a set routine for bedtime and waking, 
and use of the relaxation techniques described in the next chapter. Medications are 
not recommended long-term for sleep disorders.
• Treating depression and anxiety improves brain function and can reduce chronic 
pain.
• The use of alcohol does little to help with long-term coping, carries the risk of 
abuse, can disrupt sleep, and increases pain.
• There is limited evidence of benefit for marijuana use in the treatment of chronic 
pain.
• The use of opioids should be decided on an individual basis with the treating physi-
cian.
• The goal of opioid treatment in chronic pain is to reduce disabling pain and increase 
activities.
• Addiction and opioid abuse are consequences of exposure to opioids in those at 
risk. Being at risk does not exclude the use of opioids, but treatment needs to be 
planned accordingly.
• Naloxone is available for treatment of opioid overdose.

48	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
• Opioids or marijuana should not be the only treatment used in chronic pain.
• New treatment ideas are emerging as we learn more about the pain system and how 
it functions.
The Meanings of Pain
• Pain is a subjective experience.
• Chronic pain has many meanings for everyone who suffers from it.
• The experience of pain involves both mind and body; many patients have suffered 
from the artificial division between mind and body.
• Physical pain is associated with psychological suffering.
• You can gain control over the pain experience but in ways that may surprise you.
Exploration Tasks
1.	 Understand what medications you are taking and why. If you don’t know or understand, 
ask your pharmacist or primary care practitioner for information on each medication that 
you have been prescribed. Drug information is available online from MedlinePlus (www.
nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginformation.html).
2.	 Safeguard yourself: Make a medication list. Millions of people are harmed every year 
by medication errors. Good and well-­intentioned people can make mistakes. One of 
the most important things you can do for yourself is to make a medication list, keep it 
updated, and carry it with you at all times. The name of every pill you put in your mouth 
should be documented on your list. There are also multiple websites where you can store 
details on your medications and other essential medical information, such as your medi-
cal diagnoses, family doctor’s and specialists’ names, immunizations, and so forth. Many 
people visit multiple doctors, are hospitalized away from home or away from critical 
medical information, and may be taking multiple medications. When a chronic problem 
like pain is involved, an up-to-date medication list can be life-­saving. Typing “online per-
sonal medical records” into your search engine will allow you to explore online or off-line 
personal health record formats that might help organize your health history.

The Mind–Body Connection
I had forgotten that my body was also a sanctuary, a haven. . . . I felt 
it had betrayed me and tortured me for so many years.
The above comment was made by Mary, a program participant, about her pain experi-
ence after practicing the techniques that are described in this chapter.
Chronic Pain as a Form of Chronic Stress
As I said in Chapter 2, the mind and body are really one. They never have been separate 
and never should have been viewed as separate. How you feel (happy, sad, angry) can 
influence and be influenced by your body’s processes. For instance, you may have noticed 
that on a day when your pain is particularly bad, you have trouble concentrating or lose 
your appetite. You may have also noticed that when you are intensely focused on an activ-
ity (such as watching a football playoff or talking with your best friend), your pain, for 
that time, slips out of consciousness. Because this mind–body connection is so intimate, 
the experience of stress can lead to both physical and emotional symptoms. “Stress” is 
defined here as the perception of a threat and the perception that you are not well pre-
pared to cope with it.
Human beings have an automatic, biological response when they perceive threat or 
danger; it’s called the “fight–flight or freeze response.” Let’s look at the following sce-
nario:
It is late at night and you are home alone. You wake up to the sound of a crash down-
stairs. Your heart starts to beat rapidly; your muscles tense up; you feel anxious and 
short of breath. You may not be aware of it, but the hair on the back of your neck 
is standing on end, your blood pressure is increasing, and the pupils of your eyes are 

	
The Mind–Body Connection	
51
dilating. Blood is moving from your stomach to the skeletal muscles in preparation 
for their rapid movement out of harm’s way. Your body is preparing to fight or flee.
The first thing you do is grab a flashlight and quietly make your way downstairs. 
Trembling, you listen for further sounds. As you reach the bottom of the stairs, you 
see that the “intruder” is your cat dashing away from a broken vase. Within minutes 
after the “danger” has passed, your physical state returns to normal and your fear 
passes.
The changes in your body that constitute the fight–flight response (increased heart 
and breath rate, increased blood pressure, changes in blood flow to muscles, etc.) are 
caused by the release of adrenaline and other hormones from the sympathetic nervous 
system. The effect is to put your body into temporary overdrive to meet the challenge of 
threat or danger. The freeze component of this response is driven by the parasympathetic 
nervous system, also called the relaxation system, but under threat can be triggered when 
an individual is overwhelmed, hopeless, or helpless. The fight–flight or freeze response is 
meant to last less than a minute. When you are constantly in a stressed state, your body 
can go beyond its capacity for reestablishing homeostasis (balance). Your body’s abilities 
to restore itself to normal can be exhausted. This can contribute to numerous symptoms:
• Reduced immunity to disease
• Diarrhea and/or constipation
• Sleep disturbance
• Fatigue
• Headaches
• Poor concentration
• Shortness of breath
• Weight loss or gain
• Increased muscle tension
• Anxiety and depression
Chronic pain certainly fits the definition of a constant stressor. The physical stress 
that chronic pain places on your body results from a prolonged fight–flight or freeze 
response. How you perceive your ability to cope with the pain influences your stress level 
and your experience of pain. If you feel overwhelmed by your pain and do not take time 
to recover from the stress, you will most likely begin to experience stress-­related symp-
toms like those listed above. This is why stress management techniques can be so helpful 
in addressing chronic pain. Focused relaxation techniques that bring about the “relax-
ation response,” as described next, can help you recover from the physical symptoms of 
stress; they can also prepare you to cope with pain more effectively.

52	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
The Relaxation Response (RR) Is Not the Same as Relaxing
The “relaxation response” (which I abbreviate from here on in this book as “RR”) was 
first described by Herbert Benson and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School in the 
early 1970s. The RR is felt to play a role in quieting the body’s responses to stress. How-
ever, unlike the fight–flight or freeze response, the RR is not automatic. Before it can be 
called on to counteract stress, certain mental techniques must be practiced.
After reviewing many religious and philosophical writings, Benson proposed that for 
centuries humankind had received instructions from many different sources for bringing 
about this quieting reflex. He felt that even though many techniques could bring about 
this natural bodily response, there were two simple steps common to them all:
1.	 Focusing one’s mind on a repetitive phrase, word, breath, or action.
2.	Adopting a passive attitude toward the thoughts that go through one’s head.
From the extensive research done by Benson and others, we know that the regular 
practice of RR techniques makes it harder for the sympathetic nervous system to become 
aroused by daily hassles. In other words, it becomes more difficult for the little frustra-
tions of modern living to set off the fight–flight or freeze response, and when it is aroused, 
the body returns to normal more quickly. Thus, chronic stress symptoms are reduced 
or never develop. The physical effects of the RR can be divided into groups: immediate 
changes, which occur while a person is focusing on a repeated word, phrase, breath, 
or action; and long-term changes, which happen after repeated practice for at least a 
month. The more immediate changes include a lowering of blood pressure, heart rate, 
breath rate, and oxygen consumption (which is a measure of metabolic rate). The long-
term changes are thought to alter the body’s response to adrenaline. People may report 
a decrease in anxiety and depression, as well as an improvement in their ability to cope 
with life stressors. These changes are present even when a person is not sitting quietly 
practicing an RR technique.
Many people confuse “feeling relaxed” with the RR. They are not the same unless 
what a person is doing to relax includes the two steps mentioned—­focusing on something 
repetitive and having a passive attitude toward thoughts. In research people using the RR 
were compared to people who were not taught the RR and instead were instructed to lis-
ten to music or read a book. Under normal circumstances listening to music and reading 
a book may be relaxing, but they did not bring about the RR.
To recap, the RR is a natural response of the body, but it can be trained and with 
practice can balance the effects of daily stressors. It can be brought about by focusing 
the mind on a repeated word, phrase, breath, or action, and by a passive attitude toward 
interfering thoughts. It is not elicited by reading a book, listening to quiet music, sleeping, 
or hanging out. All of these may be relaxing, but they are not the same as bringing about 
the RR. Many relaxation techniques begin with the RR. Mindfulness meditation, dis-
cussed next, builds on focused attention and expands the practice to develop long-­lasting

changes in the way we respond to our thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and the 
events around us.
Mindfulness
Numerous studies have found benefits in the mindfulness techniques popularized by 
Jon Kabat-Zinn in his program on mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). He has 
defined mindfulness as “paying attention in a particular way; on purpose, in the present 
moment, and nonjudgmentally” (Wherever You Go, There You Are, p. 4). Mindfulness 
practice is about paying attention to your present moment-to-­moment experience without 
trying to change it, hold onto it, or get rid of it. This ability to be in the present moment 
even when that moment is filled with pain has been found to reduce pain intensity and 
pain-­related anxiety. Research using fMRI of the brain suggests that these changes are 
associated with rewiring of nerve pathways (neuroplasticity) in the brain structures 
involved in pain processing and mood regulation.
A free, self-­guided online course of MBSR is available on the website www.palouse-
mindfulness.com for those who wish to learn its principles. Courses on MBSR are taught 
all over the United States. Contact your local hospital, search the bulletin board at your 
local natural foods store, or go online to see other resources for in-­person training.
Using Breath to Relax and Focus Your Mind
The key to bringing about the RR is focused awareness. Your breathing can be the object 
of that focus. Many mindfulness exercises also begin by observing the breath in its natural 
rhythm. Because normal breathing patterns can be disrupted by tension, stress, and pain, 
focusing on how you breathe may provide you with an additional method of relaxing.
There are two types of breathing: “chest breathing” and “diaphragmatic breathing” 
(better known as “abdominal breathing”).
Chest Breathing
Many people, particularly women, are “chest breathers.” That is, they suck in their abdo-
mens and expand their chests with each in-­breath. In Western culture, women are taught 
early in life that the “proper” posture is one in which the abdomen is flat at all times. This 
posture is difficult to maintain if a person breathes from the abdomen or “diaphragmati-
cally,” which requires the stomach to move in and out with each breath.
Many men and women also become chest breathers because of prolonged anxiety, 
stress, and tension. One reason for this may be that short, shallow breaths are charac-
teristic of anxiety. Stress may also increase tension in the abdominal area, not allowing 
the diaphragm to contract completely or the abdominal wall to move out when taking an 
in-­breath. Only the chest expands as a result, and the breath is not as deep.

54	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Diaphragmatic Breathing
We all start out breathing diaphragmatically, with our abdomens rising and falling. Watch 
infants when they breathe: Their stomachs move with each breath. Over the years, many 
of us become chest breathers. Relearning to breathe diaphragmatically may feel strange 
at first, but with practice it can become second nature again.
The diaphragm is a thin dome of muscle that separates the chest cavity from the 
abdominal cavity. At the beginning of each in-­breath, it contracts and the dome flattens 
out. Air is then pulled into the lungs, and the abdominal wall moves out. (Picture a bal-
loon in the abdomen that fills with air on the in-­breath.) When the diaphragm and the 
chest relax, the breath moves out and the abdomen flattens again. On the next in-­breath, 
the process starts over. Because of this extra space for the lungs to fill, a diaphragmatic 
breath is a fuller and more complete breath than a chest breath.
For reasons that are still not altogether clear to physiologists, diaphragmatic breath-
ing can bring about a feeling of calm and relaxation when it is purposefully done.
Breathing Exercises
To try the breathing exercises that follow, I recommend that you wear loose, comfortable 
clothing and that you find a quiet, relaxing place.
How Do You Breathe?
Before starting these exercises, you need to become aware of how you breathe.
1.	 Find a comfortable place and lie down on your back. If this position is uncomfort-
able, try sitting in a chair.
2.	Place one hand on your breastbone and one hand over your belly button.
3.	 Close your eyes and become aware of what is moving when you breathe in and 
out.
4.	 If your abdomen moves up and down (without your forcing it) with each breath, 
you are already breathing diaphragmatically. You can move on to the “Breath-­
Focusing Exercises” section later in this chapter. If your chest moves up and down 
with each breath, however, you need to practice breathing diaphragmatically. Go 
to the next section, “Diaphragmatic Breathing Exercises.”
Diaphragmatic Breathing Exercises
Three diaphragmatic breathing exercises are provided here to help you train your aware-
ness of what should be moving when you breathe diaphragmatically. If one position does 
not work out for you, try another. But do not do these exercises if these positions make 
your pain worse.

	
The Mind–Body Connection	
55
Sometimes when people focus on their breath, they tend to breathe too fast or too 
deeply. If you feel light-­headed, dizzy, or anxious, you may be breathing too quickly or 
too deeply; just stop practicing for a moment and breathe normally until the symptoms 
pass. Once you are aware of how you breathe, you should be able to do diaphragmatic or 
abdominal breathing lying, sitting, or standing.
Exercise 1
1.	 Find a comfortable place and lie on your stomach.
2.	 Lift your chest off the floor by bringing your elbows back against your side at the level of 
your shoulders. Then push off the floor with your forearms (like the sphinx pose or the 
half-cobra position in yoga). This position will arch your back slightly.
3.	 Breathe normally. This will lock your chest so that when you breathe, the abdomen alone 
will move up and down.
Exercise 2
1.	 Sit in a chair and clasp your hands behind your head.
2.	 Point your elbows out to the side. Again, this serves to lock your chest so that you can feel 
the movement in your abdomen.
3.	 Breathe normally.
Exercise 3
1.	 Find a comfortable place and lie on your back.
2.	 Place your hands just below your belly button.
3.	 Close your eyes and imagine a balloon inside your abdomen.
4.	 Each time you breathe in, imagine the balloon filling with air.
5.	 Each time you breathe out, imagine the balloon collapsing.
Breath-­Focusing Exercises
Now that you are aware of your breathing, you can start to practice breath focusing.
1.	 Make a tight fist and notice what happens to your breathing. Don’t read on; just do it. 
Did you find that you held your breath or breathed in shallow, short spurts?
2.	 Now relax that fist.
3.	 Make a tight fist again, but this time continue to breathe normally. 

56	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
What happens to the tension in your fist? The tension should be reduced—and, in fact, it 
should be difficult to maintain without a real effort.
Remember: It’s hard to maintain tension (stress, pain, anger, anxiety) and keep 
breathing. This principle is used in Lamaze exercises for women in labor. The Lamaze 
technique focuses on breathing to release tension and increase control during the various 
stages of labor. Women are encouraged to use their breathing to control the pain. This 
same principle can be applied to your pain experience.
Observe how often you hold your breath when you anticipate pain or when you are 
experiencing pain. You can change this experience by breathing. When you experience 
pain (or increased tension, anger, anxiety, or stress), do the following:
1.	 Purposefully stop and pause.
2.	Take a slow, deep breath from your diaphragm.
3.	 Focus on what you are doing and how you are feeling. What is the problem? 
What are your choices? Do you need to continue with a certain activity, or can 
you change what you are doing? Is the situation worth getting upset about at this 
moment?
As you will see, breath-­focusing exercises can sometimes give you instant control, 
because they make you focus on the present moment. You may often be caught off guard 
by stressful events if you are busy worrying about the future, wishing you could change 
the past, or responding automatically without thinking at all. Focusing on the present 
moment allows you to consider more clearly what has gotten you upset. Many times, all 
you need to do is to make a change in the way you are doing or thinking about something.
Focusing on your breath and breathing diaphragmatically can also get you through 
uncomfortable or difficult procedures such as MRI scans, pelvic exams, sigmoidoscopies, 
and injections. In fact, many of life’s challenges can be made a little easier by just breath-
ing. Make breath-­focusing exercises a part of your daily routine.
Quick Skill: Mini-­Relaxations
It’s true, tension and breath holding go together. When you take a moment and focus 
on diaphragmatic breathing, think of this as a “mini-­relaxation.” Begin to practice 
mini-­relaxations during the day to release tension that has accumulated over short 
periods of time. Here are some suggestions for different kinds of mini-­relaxations:
1.	 Whenever you have just a minute, take a deep breath; as you breathe out, 
imagine all the tension in your body and mind leaving through this breath.
2.	 Take a moment to tense all the muscles you can at once. Then take a deep 
breath and slowly breathe out, letting all the tension go. Take another deep 
breath and reduce the tension further. Repeat until the tension is gone.

	
The Mind–Body Connection	
57
3.	 Take an inventory of body tension in your familiar stress points. For example, 
is there tension in your neck or upper back? If you find that there is, pretend 
that you can direct the breath into that area of tension. As you breathe out, 
feel the tension release.
4.	 Count to 10 taking a slow, deep breath. Hold the breath for one count. Then 
breathe out slowly, again as you count to 10.
5.	 Take a moment to create tension in your body by raising your shoulders to your 
ears as you breathe in slowly; now breathe out slowly and drop the shoulders. 
Do this three times. When you breathe out, see if you can pretend or imagine 
that the tension in your shoulders is leaving the muscles and going out in the 
breath, into the room. You can do this for any part of the body where you 
might carry tension by tensing the muscles in the area during an in-­breath and 
breathing out the tension on an out-­breath.
Preparing to Practice Relaxation Techniques
Minimizing Distractions and Making Yourself Comfortable
Plan to practice a relaxation technique for 10–20 minutes once a day. Pick a time to do 
your relaxation practice when your pain is not at its worst. To minimize distractions, 
find a quiet, comfortable place where you feel safe practicing the relaxation techniques 
described later.
If necessary, put a “Do Not Disturb” sign (provided in Appendix F and available for 
downloading at www.guilford.com/managepain) on the door. Turn off cell phones; take 
land lines off the hook.
By all means, respect your need for comfort and find the position that feels best to 
you. The following are suggestions for making yourself comfortable:
• Use a heating pad, ice, and supportive pillows to make yourself as comfortable as 
needed.
• Make sure the temperature in the room is right for you, or have a blanket nearby 
if you should become chilled.
• If you prefer to lie down while practicing your relaxation technique but find your-
self falling asleep, try a sitting position. A good compromise between lying down 
and sitting is using a reclining chair.
• When you end your session, always count to three and slowly open your eyes. Get 
up slowly, so that your body has time to adjust to the postural change after such 
deep relaxation.
• Do not set an alarm. If you are not using a relaxation tape and want to keep track 
of the time, just set a clock in front of you and open your eyes periodically. After 

58	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
practicing a few times, you will usually be able to judge when 20 minutes have 
elapsed.
Using Relaxation Recordings
Relaxation or meditation CDs or MP3 downloads can be quite valuable when you are first 
learning a relaxation technique. Audio recordings of environmental sounds and music for 
meditation are also available through local or online bookstores, and some people find it 
helpful to make their own relaxation recording to guide them.
I have recorded three guided relaxation exercises for pain that you can use with this 
book. They are available for free download from www.guilford.com/managepain. These 
audio exercises correspond to relaxation techniques described a bit later in this chapter. 
Look for the headphones graphic () next to those techniques with audios.
What you use to help you stay focused is not as important as staying focused in a 
relaxed and nonjudgmental way as best you can. Start with a simple, basic technique (see 
“Technique 1,” later in this chapter). Changing tracks, audio recordings, or focus word(s) 
every other day will not help you focus your mind. Consistency is important when you 
are first learning a technique. Use an audio recording (or word, phrase, or breath) for a 
couple of weeks before deciding that you need to make a change.
Mind Chatter
At times your thoughts will go off in many different directions, taking your attention 
with them. The resulting chatter of your mind may go on and on. This can be very dis-
tracting and it can affect your concentration. This “mind chatter” is normal; it happens 
to all of us. It shows us that we can sometimes be one place mentally and another place 
physically. You may be thinking about something that happened in the past or planning 
for the future. It’s difficult not to get caught up in these random thoughts.
There is a time and place for this mind chatter, but it always seems to get louder 
when you are trying to practice a relaxation technique. Mind chatter is persistent, and 
you may find that it creeps into your consciousness even as you assume a passive attitude. 
Don’t criticize or judge yourself. Just keep gently returning your attention to your breath 
or your focus word (see Technique 1, in the next section). With practice, focusing on the 
repeated breath or word can reduce mind chatter or even temporarily eliminate it.
Problem Solving
You may encounter obstacles that keep you from practicing the relaxation techniques. 
No doubt you can always find a hundred reasons not to do your relaxation practice. This 
section could be called “No Excuses!”
The following subsections touch upon the most common problems that participants 
have in this program. After reading these, you should feel better able to handle any 
obstacles that prevent you from practicing the relaxation techniques.

	
The Mind–Body Connection	
59
Lack of Time
“I don’t have the time!” you may exclaim. The response is simple: If you want to feel 
better, make the time. First, ask yourself why you feel you don’t have the time. Do these 
answers from previous program participants seem familiar?
“What will people think if they see me doing nothing? I do so little as it is.”
“My family needs me.”
“This can’t possibly make a difference—my pain is real.”
“I’m in too much pain.”
Statements like these may come from giving too much control to others, from low 
self-­esteem or learned helplessness, or simply from practicing at times when your pain is 
at its worst or you’re too exhausted. These are all normal feelings, but you won’t feel any 
better if you let them stop you. Your choice is “to do or not to do.” When you choose “to 
do,” you have the opportunity to experience all the positive benefits of bringing about the 
RR and reducing your stress.
Increased Awareness of Pain
You may find, as have many other people, that you are more aware of your pain when you 
minimize distractions and try to practice a relaxation technique. Sometimes when you 
close your eyes in a quiet room, the pain comes roaring back.
Try finding a comfortable position that reduces your pain as much as possible. Relax-
ation Technique 8 (self-­hypnosis), described later in this chapter, may help diminish the 
pain sensation temporarily. Sometimes just focusing all of your attention on the pain will 
at first increase it, but within seconds this awareness should diminish. The brain is not 
“wired” to pay attention to things that do not change.
Problems with Sitting Still or Relaxing
You may say, “I can’t sit still. I’m not the kind of person to relax; I must be busy. I feel anx-
ious when I start to relax or close my eyes.” If this is so, ask yourself why you can’t sit still.
To begin with, do you like your own company? Do you feel worthwhile only if you’re 
doing something? Some people have such a fragile sense of self-worth and self-­esteem 
that they are the last people with whom they want to sit—they just don’t like their own 
company. Some people feel that meeting others’ demands is the only activity that counts. 
This makes sitting quietly and doing a relaxation technique seem like an “irresponsible” 
thing to do. Still others may be so physically tense that they don’t know what it’s like to 
relax (in mind or body!).
If you are physically tense, try some gentle stretching. Systematic contracting and 
relaxing of various muscle groups, as in “progressive muscle relaxation” (see Technique 

60	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
5 in the next section), may also be helpful. If your self-­esteem is low or your need to 
meet others’ demands is high, you may find the following recommendation helpful. At 
the beginning of your relaxation practice, take a moment to imagine a covered basket or 
toolbox sitting beside you. Identify the thoughts that are going through your head that are 
causing worry or concern. As you identify these items, imagine opening the basket or tool-
box and depositing the items. Make an agreement with yourself that you can take all those 
things out right after your relaxation session, but while you are in the relaxation practice, 
they are to remain where you’ve put them. It is surprising how effective this simple negotia-
tion with yourself can be. You can decide when you will or won’t be distracted or worried.
Some people have trouble relaxing because they are trying to avoid memories of 
traumatic events, such as physical or sexual abuse. This inability to relax is associated 
with hypervigilance (being on guard against harm even when there is nothing harmful in 
the environment) and has been described in various posttraumatic stress syndromes. For 
some, these traumatic memories surface whenever they let their guard down and relax. 
For others, these memories have been hidden from their consciousness, only to emerge 
when they started to practice the relaxation techniques.
These memories needn’t keep someone from enjoying the benefits of the relaxation 
techniques described here. There are ways of modifying the relaxation techniques to 
minimize the anxiety and reduce the discomfort. Furthermore, because reactions to past 
trauma tend to magnify negative feelings about chronic pain—­feelings of vulnerability, of 
being out of control, or that “no one believes me”—it is important to separate the experi-
ences of previous trauma and present chronic pain. In studies of adult survivors of child-
hood abuse, the use of mindfulness techniques was shown to reduce anxiety, depression, 
and posttraumatic symptoms.
It is not possible to give universal recommendations for the very complicated reac-
tions people can have to trauma. However, the following suggestions might help decrease 
the discomfort of these feelings.
1.	 Acknowledge that you are indeed a very special person for having taken the initia-
tive to pick up this book. Parts of you sense that things have not been going well 
and that there must be a better way. Hang on to this self-­awareness; it can get you 
through the rough times. Change is not easy and rarely proceeds without effort.
2.	Practice your relaxation techniques in a safe place, with locked doors and the 
lights on if necessary. Do whatever it takes to make you feel comfortable. Some-
times if you create a safe physical environment, you can begin to feel safe inside.
3.	 Use a relaxation tape to minimize internal distractions. Keep your eyes open or 
stare at a candle flame as a focus. Do progressive muscle relaxation or use an exer-
cise that couples movement and breath focus. This, too, will help cut down on the 
internal distractions.
4.	 Biofeedback therapy can sometimes be very helpful. While you are learning to 
relax, it gives you external feedback on your internal processes—such as muscle 

	
The Mind–Body Connection	
61
tension, skin conductance, and skin temperature. Biofeedback devices keep your 
attention focused on changing these physical parameters until you are comfort-
able enough to do so on your own without the machine.
5.	 Psychotherapy with someone experienced at treating posttraumatic stress syn-
dromes can also support your efforts. In my experience, once trauma memories 
surface, they will not be pushed out of consciousness again. However, their con-
scious presence may mean that you are now ready to deal with the memories. If 
possible, try to come to terms with your past experiences and memories. They do 
have an impact on your pain and can cause serious stress in their own right. Seek 
help and take care of yourself.
Peculiar Sensations or Experiences
Although it is a rare complaint, some program participants have reported out-of-body 
experiences, dissociation, or feelings of a presence other than their own. In most of these 
cases, the persons have been practicing a relaxation technique for longer than recom-
mended—more than 1 hour, or several times a day for an hour or more. This is an 
instance in which doing something more, or more often, is not necessarily better for you. 
Overuse of such techniques can lead to alterations in consciousness, and it is therefore 
important to follow the specific instructions provided. The techniques presented in a later 
section, “Basic Relaxation and Mindfulness Techniques,” are safe and very effective if 
used as instructed.
Some people are so used to feeling “wired” that feeling relaxed feels peculiar to them. 
If this is the case for you, you may just need to learn what it feels like to be relaxed.
Seizure Disorders
If you have a seizure disorder, it is suggested that you practice your relaxation techniques 
while lying down. Some seizures are brought on by a change in level of arousal, such as 
going to sleep or awakening. Because the brain waves associated with bringing about the 
RR are similar to those occurring in the first stage of sleep, people with rare sleep-onset 
seizure disorders may experience seizures when they first start practicing. This may pass 
with continued practice or with the use of another technique (progressive muscle relax-
ation, yoga, or other physically focused repetitive technique). Some people have found 
that they can actually help control their seizures by practicing a relaxation technique, 
learning to relax and redirecting their focus of attention with the first sign of a coming 
seizure. If you have questions, check with your doctor.
Insulin-­Dependent Diabetes
Adrenaline can alter insulin availability, making it necessary for more insulin to be in cir-
culation. Therefore, if you have an insulin-­dependent form of diabetes, stress can increase 

62	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
the amount of insulin you need. Many patients on insulin find that they need less of it 
after starting regular practice of a technique that brings about the RR. Take hypogly-
cemic reactions seriously and reduce your insulin dose if you begin to experience lower 
blood sugar levels. Check with your doctor.
Hypertension
Blood pressure medications can interfere with the body’s normal adjustments to changes 
in posture. If you take drugs for hypertension, make sure you change positions slowly 
when getting up after an RR practice, whether from lying to sitting or from sitting to 
standing. Many patients find that with regular practice of a technique that brings about 
the RR, their blood pressure may decrease, and their medication requirements may even 
be reduced. Be sure to check with your physician before making any adjustments in your 
medication(s).
Basic Relaxation and Mindfulness Techniques
Now that you know what RR is, how to prepare and what to expect, you can start learn-
ing some basic techniques. I would recommend that you start with the basic techniques 
and master those before moving on to the more advanced ones if you have never done this 
kind of stress management work before.
Begin by finding yourself a quiet, comfortable position in which your body can relax.
Close your eyes, unless that is uncomfortable or feels unsafe. Begin to focus, as 
directed, on a word or phrase, on your breath, or on creating muscle tension.
Technique 1: Using a Focus Word or Phrase to Elicit 
the Relaxation Response
Focus your mind on repeating a word or short phrase with each out-­breath. What 
word or phrase you choose is less important than its repetition. Remember that this is 
just a way of keeping your mind focused. You can use the number “one,” or count to 
10 repetitively with each breath, or count “one” on the in-­breath and “two” on the out-­
breath.
You can also just find a sound that is comforting to say. If you have a religious or 
spiritual preference or practice, a short prayer or phrase can be used. I do recommend, 
however, that you avoid words or phrases like “Go! Go! Go!” or “I must relax!” With 
such phrases, you are pressuring yourself to do more and more in less and less time. This 
is not the intention of the relaxation techniques. The aim is not for you to do more of 
what you have been doing but to take the time to sit and focus. This allows your natural 
body wisdom to be restored.
If you find your mind wandering, gently guide it back to your focus word or  
phrase.

Technique 2: Sitting Mindfulness Meditation
In the meditation in this section, Jon Kabat-Zinn advises resisting the first impulse to 
shift position in response to discomfort. Instead, the meditation asks you to shift your 
attention to the sensations of discomfort or pain. If at all possible, welcome them; be curi-
ous. Try relaxing into the sensations, then return to the breath.
Sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Begin to observe the breath as 
it comes in through the nose or mouth; feel the air as it passes from the outside to the 
inside, filling your lungs. Then observe it as it leaves your lungs as you exhale. Continue 
observing the breath. Within a minute or two you may find your body becoming restless. 
Observe but try not to act on the impulse to change position. Observe how your pain 
comes to the forefront of the sensations you may be feeling. Observe but do not make a 
judgment of how it should be or what you should do now. Observe the sensation until it 
too changes and then observe the change. Return to the breath and observe the in and out 
of the breath. Be in the moment of the in-­breath and out-­breath. If you find that thoughts 
are distracting you from the breath, observe each thought, let it go, and follow without 
judging until it dissipates like a cloud on the horizon. Return to observing the breath, the 
in and the out. You are not failing at meditation when you find that your mind has wan-
dered; it is simply the nature of the mind. A key skill that is being practiced is becoming 
aware that your attention has wandered.
Technique 3: Coupling Breathing with Imagination
Use your breath coupled with your imagination. This exercise is sometimes helpful to those 
who find focusing on their chests or abdomens too uncomfortable or anxiety-­provoking.
For example, you can picture your breath coming in through your right hand and out 
through your left hand, or in and out through your right hand. “Breathing” through your 
feet can also be used. Or you can imagine the in-­breath going to areas of tension such as 
your face, neck, or back; as you breathe out, imagine the breath and tension disappearing 
into the air. Each time a breath goes out, feel yourself becoming more relaxed.
Technique 4: Ocean Sounds
Another version of this technique can be found on the Ocean Sounds relaxation audio 
available for free download at www.guilford.com/managepain. This 20-minute record-
ing starts with a focus on the body to orient your attention and then guides your imagina-
tion to images of a beach; ocean sounds then play. You may find that your breath natu-
rally flows with the rhythm of the ocean waves, in and out. If you practice with this track 
once a day, you will get the recommended 20 minutes of daily RR practice.
Technique 5: Progressive Muscle Relaxation
Alternately tensing and relaxing various parts of the body is another helpful technique for 
individuals who find it difficult to relax by sitting quietly.


64	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
You can reduce distraction by engaging in physical and mental focusing. For exam-
ple, curl the toes of your right foot on the in-­breath, and relax them on the out-­breath. 
Next, flex your right foot up toward your head on the in-­breath, and then relax the foot 
on the out-­breath. Straighten your right leg at the knee on the in-­breath and relax the 
knee on the out-­breath. Tense your right buttock on the in-­breath and relax it on the out-­
breath. Repeat the sequence for the left leg, and progress up the body until all parts have 
been tensed and relaxed in sequence with the breath.
Recorded progressive relaxation exercises are available that can guide you in this 
technique. (See “Using Relaxation Recordings” in the previous section.)
Technique 6: Using Repetitive Motion
Perform a repetitive motion while coupling your breath and mind with the motion. For 
instance, running, swimming, stationary bicycling, or using a treadmill can be used to 
elicit the RR, as long as your breath and mind are in sync with the movement.
As an example, let’s suppose that you are walking on a treadmill. You can inhale 
on two steps and exhale on two steps repetitively and focus on that breath–­movement 
rhythm. Of course, the ratio of breath to steps will depend on your level of conditioning, 
comfort, and speed. When you find yourself distracted from the rhythm of your breath 
and movement by your thoughts, gently return your focus to your breath and movement.
Yoga and tai chi are also effective ways of coupling breath, mind, and motion. Such 
techniques involving ritualized posturing of the body were probably used to bring about 
the calming effect of the RR in ancient cultures.
Technique 7: Creating a Safe Place
Many people in pain feel betrayed by their bodies. Pain can make you feel trapped with 
nowhere to hide or find comfort. It is possible, by using your various senses, to re-­create a 
safe haven in your mind. Some program participants have reported strong, pleasant, and 
familiar odors while they are in their safe places; others have tactile (touch) sensations of 
warmth and softness. Everyone has different experiences. You should allow your favorite 
and most comforting sensations to be present—sound, smell, touch, sight, or a combina-
tion of the senses. A guided imagery audio version of this technique can be downloaded 
for free from www.guilford.com/managepain.
The following exercise has been one of the most beneficial versions of this basic tech-
nique for people in pain:
1.	 Begin by engaging in Technique 1 or 4.
2.	When you are focused and relaxed, create an image in your mind that feels safe 
and comforting. Your safe place can be somewhere you went as a child, a pleas-
ant vacation spot, or a place you saw in a book or a movie. It can be a favorite 
room in your home, your bed, or an imagined large fluffy cloud. You can move 


the mountains next to the seashore or create a totally bug-free forest scene . . . 
wherever your imagination leads. The key here is to envision a place associated 
with peace and comfort.
3.	 When you have imagined your special place, find a comfortable spot to sit or lie 
and pass some quality time here, repeating your focus word or phrase with each 
breath. When you become distracted by thoughts, gently guide your awareness 
back to your focus.
4.	 Enjoy the experience!
With practice, you can re-­create this image by focusing on your breath or the words 
safe place whenever you need some respite.
Advanced Relaxation and Mindfulness Techniques
The advanced relaxation techniques described next allow you to obtain additional results 
and insights. However, if you are inexperienced in achieving the RR, you may feel uncom-
fortable at the images that come into your head during the visualization exercise (Tech-
nique 9). You should have first practiced and become skilled at creating a safe place inside 
yourself. For many people in chronic pain, the pain is a beast or a big dark cloud, which 
can be quite intimidating (and scary) if not approached from a position of experience 
with the basic techniques. Or you may feel anxious about the instructions to create numb-
ness and an absence of feeling in certain body areas during the self-­hypnosis exercise 
(Technique 8). Therefore, it is recommended that you practice the advanced techniques 
only after you have had experience eliciting the RR by means of one of the basic versions 
described in Techniques 1–7 for at least 5 weeks.
Technique 8: Self-­Hypnosis
The following is a simple self-­hypnosis exercise. Begin by performing one of the basic 
relaxation techniques that you have learned. Once you are feeling relaxed, proceed as 
follows:
1.	 Close your eyes and imagine that your right hand is becoming pleasantly warm 
and heavy. Each time you breathe out, the pleasant sensation of warmth and heavi-
ness increases, until your hand feels so heavy it can hardly move (unless you want 
it to).
2.	Now feel a pleasant numbness that begins in your right thumb and then moves, 
with each out-­breath, to your second finger, the third finger, the fourth finger, and 
finally the fifth finger. The numbness spreads to the palm of your right hand and 
then to the back of the hand, stopping at the wrist. It is a pleasant, warm, heavy, 
and numb sensation only in your right hand.

66	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
3.	 Either physically place your right hand on your painful area, or imagine that the 
numbness in your right hand is moving there. When all the numbness has been 
absorbed into the area of pain, return to your focus word or breath. When you are 
ready to end this session, focus again on your right hand.
4.	 Be aware of the normal sensation returning to the back of your right hand, then 
the palm, the fifth finger, the fourth finger, the third finger, the second finger, and 
the thumb. Your hand may still feel warm and heavy.
5.	 Gradually feel your hand becoming lighter and lighter with each breath. Feel it 
become normal, just like your left hand.
6.	 Count to three and open your eyes.
The more you practice this technique, the more quickly you can develop the sensation 
of numbness, which can be transferred to the area of pain. You can also make your own 
tape with these instructions to help you master this technique.
This is a technique that can temporarily alter the pain experience. If you wish to 
explore hypnosis further, there are psychotherapists who have special training and certifi-
cation in hypnosis who may help you identify other techniques that might suit your needs 
better. An inspiring story about how one person used hypnosis to control his pain can be 
found in A Whole New Life by Reynolds Price (see the “Supplementary Reading” section 
at the end of this chapter).
Technique 9: Pain Control Visualization
In this visualization exercise, you create and work with an image of your pain. You may 
find my audio recording of this technique helpful. It can be downloaded from www.guil-
ford.com/managepain.
As noted earlier, this technique should not be attempted without ample experience 
with the basic techniques, especially Technique 7, because many people’s images of their 
pain can be quite frightening. If your image gets too scary, just open your eyes; remember 
that you have control over it.
Gail suffered from terrible migraines that were occurring at least once a week. During 
the visualization exercise she saw her pain as a red, hot ball that pulsated. When asked 
to modify the pain in some way, she decided to build an igloo around it, and the red 
ball turned blue.
The next time Gail started to get her usual warning of the headache to come, she 
closed her eyes, imagined the red, hot ball, and then built an igloo around it until it 
turned blue. The headache didn’t come! Gail was able to stop many of her headaches 
with this technique.

The Mind–Body Connection	
67
To begin this exercise, again engage in one of the basic relaxation techniques. When 
you feel focused and relaxed, create an image in your mind in the following manner:
  1.	 Imagine yourself in a meadow where the sun is shining; it’s not too hot or too 
cool, and a gentle breeze is blowing.
  2.	 Picture a path. As you walk along it, a sense of safety and security accompanies 
you. In the distance you can hear the birds singing in the trees, and you can smell 
the sweet scent of wildflowers. Follow the path across a bridge to a house that 
sits at the edge of the meadow.
  3.	 Walk up the steps of the house and open the front door. When you walk inside, 
you will find a large room divided into two parts by a large wall made of clear, 
impenetrable plastic. This wall extends from floor to ceiling and from one end of 
the room to the other.
  4.	 Sit in front of the clear plastic wall and make yourself comfortable.
  5.	 Gather up your pain into a ball. Take this ball of pain and notice that the clear 
plastic wall in front of you opens up to let you drop the pain on the other side. 
After you have placed the pain on the other side, the wall closes up again, and 
the pain must remain there until you instruct it otherwise.
  6.	 Give your pain a color, a shape, or a form. It may be a symbol of what your pain 
feels like, a cartoon character, or a big blob. Let the image appear spontaneously 
if you can.
  7.	 Now observe its behavior. Does it bounce around, scream, or look menacing? 
How does being face-to-face with it make you feel?
  8.	 Ask your pain these questions and listen to the responses:
“Why are you here?”
“What can I learn from you?”
“When will you go away?”
“Can we coexist together?”
  9.	 You can ask the pain any other questions that you may have. Most people have a 
lot of questions to ask or things to say to their pain when given this opportunity.
10.	 Now think about how you might change the image of your pain in some way. For 
example, if it looks like a blob that is ill defined, pour it into a container and give 
it boundaries. You don’t have to destroy it; just let your ideas and the image come 
freely. If it’s hot, cool it down. If it’s sharp, dull the edges. As you try different 
approaches, ask yourself how you feel about manipulating your pain. Is there any 
effect on your pain as you try these different approaches?

68	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
11.	 When you are finished asking questions and modifying your pain, make one of 
the following decisions:
Take all of the pain back.
Leave all of the pain behind the clear plastic wall.
Take part of the pain back.
12.	 Once you have made your decision, walk out the front door of the house and 
close it behind you.
13.	 Walk down the front steps and into the sunshine. Move along the path, over the 
bridge, and back into the meadow again.
14.	 Take the path to your safe place where you have established a haven of refuge 
and solace (Technique 7). Spend some time there focusing your mind and releas-
ing any residual tension.
15.	 When you are finished, open your eyes.
This technique can be a very powerful emotional experience. It can be used to exam-
ine any problem, not just your pain. By removing or distancing yourself from the pain or 
other problem, you can get a fresh outlook, and new solutions can be explored.
Dorothy was amazed. The image before her was as gray and ominous as anything she 
had ever felt in all the years she’d had pain. It had no edges or boundaries. The pain 
looked like smoky wisps that crept along the edges of the clear wall, as if it were try-
ing to find an opening to escape.
Dorothy asked it questions but received no answers. Her pain remained as elusive 
as it had always been. What wasn’t elusive, however, was the sense of impending 
doom she felt whenever the pain increased.
Dorothy continued to practice this technique and always created a safe place 
after confronting her pain. As she began exploring the pain with her Pain Diary and 
some of the cognitive exercises (see Chapter 5), she started to see images that were 
more concrete and defined. At first she saw a ghost, then a character that looked like 
the Michelin tire man. One day she was able to pump the tire man up until it exploded 
into a thousand pieces.
Dorothy then felt a sense of release and relief. She realized that the fear of the 
pain had held her a prisoner; once she became able to face this fear, she was able to 
feel less controlled by it.
The use of imagery allows you to explore the nonverbal, unconscious experience of 
pain meanings and metaphors. It can help you make connections to other experiences or 

	
The Mind–Body Connection	
69
perceptions that might not be reached through logical reasoning. This, in turn, can give 
you an entirely different attitude toward your pain. It can expand your control of the pain 
experience.
Another way of looking at the effects of this exercise is to place your hand over your 
face with fingers spread apart. Your vision is impaired, and you are not able to see the 
front or back of your hand. Now, as your hand moves away from your face, you can see 
more details, and there is more freedom to turn your hand around to see both the back 
and the front. Similarly, distancing pain or other problems behind the plastic wall allows 
you to see a greater range of solutions for the problems that may confront you.
Technique 10: Mindfulness of Sensation and Feelings
In his book Full Catastrophe Living (see the “Supplementary Reading” section at the 
end of this chapter), Jon Kabat-Zinn described the following meditation exercise that 
encourages you to let the mind stay passively focused on the pain. Allow yourself simply 
to observe the pain and the feelings you may have, such as fear or anger, without running 
away from those feelings or the sensation. Without judging the sensations or feelings as 
good or bad, say to yourself, “Oh, yes, that’s my pain” or “That’s my anger.” This tech-
nique can have dramatic results. When you stay passively focused on the pain, you begin 
to realize how much you fight your pain and avoid your feelings about it, both of which 
increase your feelings of powerlessness. Once you understand this, then every time the 
pain tugs at your awareness during the practice, you may find you do not have to fight it. 
You do not have to feed it with anger, anxiety, or frustration.	
This technique may seem impossible. You may want to ignore your pain because you 
may fear it will get worse. It will not. This technique is a very powerful way to grasp the 
fact that the pain exists and that you are the one who experiences the pain. How you 
choose to feel about your pain is under your control, and during this practice you don’t 
have to have any judgment about the experience.
Summary
Chronic Pain as Chronic Stress; the RR
• Chronic pain fits the definition of chronic stress. Chronic stress makes it difficult 
for you to reestablish homeostasis (balance). It can exhaust your body’s ability to 
restore itself to normal.
• Practicing techniques that bring about the relaxation response (RR) will help your 
body recover from chronic stress.
• The RR is a natural bodily response, but it requires training and practice. It 
involves (1) focusing your mind on a repeated phrase, word, breath, or action; and 
(2) adopting a passive attitude toward interfering thoughts.

70	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Breathing and Breathing Exercises
• The key to bringing about the RR is focused awareness; you can focus on your 
breathing.
• There are two types of breathing:
 Chest breathing: with each in-­breath, your chest expands.
 Diaphragmatic breathing: with each in-­breath, your abdomen expands.
• Become aware of how you breathe.
• If you are a chest breather, relearn diaphragmatic breathing with the three exer-
cises in this chapter.
• Once you’re aware of your breathing, start to practice focusing on your breath. It 
encourages you to focus on the present, the here and now. Focusing on your breath-
ing can help you release tension, decrease pain, and increase control.
• Take a moment during the day to focus on breathing; think of it as a “mini-­
relaxation.”
Preparing to Practice Your Relaxation Technique
• Minimize distractions and make yourself as comfortable as possible while you 
practice the relaxation techniques.
• Relaxation audios can be quite helpful in learning to do a relaxation technique. If 
you plan to use recordings, don’t continually change them; be consistent with your 
object of focus, particularly when you first begin.
• “Mind chatter” is the name for all the thoughts going through your mind. This 
chatter is perfectly normal, but it can distract you from your focus. Just keep gently 
returning your focus to your repeated breath, word, phrase, or action. With prac-
tice, you can reduce the chatter.
• In the beginning, many obstacles may keep you from practicing a relaxation tech-
nique; however, these techniques are critical to your overcoming your pain and 
succeeding with this program. So, in the interest of better health, remember the 
following:
 If you want to feel better, make the time to practice the techniques.
 Your pain may get worse during practice, but you can develop your ability 
to focus and decrease the pain. Mindfulness meditation may be quite helpful 
here.
 If you have trouble with sitting still or relaxing because of physical tension, try 
gentle stretching or progressive muscle relaxation; if you have low self-­esteem 
or a strong need to meet others’ demands, try imagining that you have put your 
worries in a basket while you practice.
 If you are dealing with posttraumatic stress (for example, sexual abuse 

	
The Mind–Body Connection	
71
memories), you can modify the techniques in various ways to minimize your 
anxiety and decrease your discomfort. Seek additional professional help if 
you are feeling overwhelmed. Again, mindfulness meditation may be a helpful 
technique to use.
 If you have peculiar sensations or experiences (for example, out-of-body expe-
riences, dissociation) while practicing a relaxation technique, you may be prac-
ticing too long or too often.
 If you have a seizure disorder, diabetes, or hypertension, you need to know 
how relaxation techniques may affect you. Be sure to read the relevant sec-
tion of this chapter and learn what you may need to do to accommodate your 
disorder.
Basic Relaxation and Mindfulness Techniques
• Technique 1: Mentally focus on repeating a word or short phrase on each out-­
breath.
• Technique 2: Mindfulness meditation observes the breath without judgment and 
then observes the reactions of the body and thoughts, again without judging before 
returning to the breath.
• Technique 3: Use your breath, coupled with your imagination. Picture your in-­
breath going into the areas of tension, and letting the tension go on the out-­breath.
• Technique 4: Use your breath coupled with ocean sounds on the downloadable 
audio recording available at www.guilford.com/managepain.
• Technique 5: Alternately tense and relax various parts of your body (this is called 
progressive muscle relaxation).
• Technique 6: Keep repeating a motion in sync with the rhythm of your breath as 
your mind focuses on it.
• Technique 7: Create a safe haven in your mind where you can go to relax, leaving 
your pain behind. A downloadable audio recording is available at www.guilford.
com/managepain.
Advanced Relaxation and Mindfulness Techniques
Practice these three advanced relaxation techniques only after you have become skilled in 
at least one of the basic techniques (1–7).
• Technique 8: This simple self-­hypnosis technique allows you to transfer sensations 
from one part of your body to another.
• Technique 9: This visualization technique allows you to place your pain behind 
a clear wall; give it a form; ask it questions; modify its form and study the effect 
on your pain; and then decide whether to take part, all, or none of it back. Not 

72	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
only can this technique be a very powerful emotional experience, it can also be 
extremely effective—and you can use it to put any problem behind the clear plastic 
wall, whether or not it’s related to your pain. A downloadable audio recording of 
this pain control technique is available at www.guilford.com/managepain.
• Technique 10: In this mindfulness technique you allow yourself to passively observe 
the pain and the emotions you have without judging them as good or bad and with-
out fighting the pain.
Exploration Tasks
1.	 Practice your goal-­setting skills by writing out a goal that involves one of the relaxation 
techniques. Make sure that your goal meets the criteria set forth in Chapter 1—in other 
words, that it is a realistic behavioral task that can be measured in the steps that you will 
take to accomplish it. Here is an example:
Goal   Practice relaxation technique 1 once a day.	
Steps to take to reach that goal:
A.	  Turn my phone off.	
B.	  Use the recliner to maximize comfort.	
C.	  Practice as soon as I get out of bed.	
In addition, make some contingency plans. Making contingency plans is a way of trouble-
shooting before a problem occurs. Think now about what might get in the way of achiev-
ing your goal and develop strategies to solve the problem. Here is an example:
	
Obstacles	
Solutions
A.  	 Can’t relax, pain too bad	
Listen to a relaxation tape, practice in bathtub
B.	  Family members disturb me	
Hang “Do Not Disturb” sign on door
Now it’s your turn.
Goal: 	
Steps to take to reach that goal:
A.	 	

	
The Mind–Body Connection

D.	                                         	
2.	 Practice diaphragmatic breathing as frequently as possible, both during the day and 
before going to sleep.
3.	 In the midst of tension, increased pain, or emotional distress, remember to do the follow-
ing:
A.	 Consciously stop and pause.
B.	 Take a slow, deep breath from your diaphragm.
C.	 Reflect on the situation and your choices.
4.	 Incorporate “mini-­relaxations” into your daily routine.
When do you do mini-­relaxations? 	
What techniques do you use? 	
	
What can you do to remind yourself to do mini-­relaxations throughout the day? 	
	
5.	 Practice a relaxation or mindfulness technique once a day for 20 minutes. In the begin-
ning, don’t be concerned with breathing diaphragmatically; just breathe your normal 
way. Practice the diaphragmatic breathing separately. Practice one of the basic tech-
niques (1–7) daily for at least 5 weeks before moving on to the advanced techniques 

74	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
(8–10). Again, it is important to be comfortable with the basic techniques before using 
the more advanced techniques.
6.	 Complete the “Relaxation Response Technique Diary” in Appendix F and available for 
downloading at www.guilford.com/managepain. Next to each category, indicate the 
appropriate information about your daily practice. Use this diary for the first 3 weeks to 
reinforce practice.

The Body–Mind Connection
Chapter 3 explored how your mind can affect your body. Now let’s take a look at how 
your body can affect your mind.
When you are in pain, you may tend to do the following:
• Ignore all sensation from the neck down or label all sensation as painful.
• Stop moving your body parts except when it’s absolutely necessary.
• Withdraw from social interactions.
• Push yourself physically by denying your condition.
These attitudes and behaviors need to be challenged. They either feed your fear of 
activity or make you do far too much. When you stop moving, you lose muscle strength 
and endurance; when you do too much, you risk reinjuring yourself. You can become 
isolated, lonely, and depressed. One patient, John, has described all of this in the follow-
ing story.
I used to get up in the morning with the challenge of doing things as usual, in spite 
of my pain. Maybe today would be different. Sure, the pain was my issue, but I was 
also getting subtle and not-so-­subtle messages from my family and friends: “It used to 
be so much fun when you could do this. . . . Remember when you could do that? . . . 
When are you going back to work? It might get your mind off your problems.”
I felt it was impossible to explain. No one understood. Even I had a difficult time 
understanding why my back continued to spasm with the least amount of activity. I 
was terrified of doing things for fear of making the pain worse; yet, at the same time, 
I was ashamed because I couldn’t even keep up with the laundry. How could I ever 
drive a truck again—the only thing I knew how to do for a living? So each day I would 
push myself through the odd jobs at home and collapse at the end of the day, with 
the pain worse than ever.

76	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
So what did I accomplish? I became more irritable, depressed, and withdrawn. I 
felt trapped and alone. My children tiptoed past me as I lay on the couch, and my wife 
and I constantly bickered. One day I found her sobbing. She told me that she felt she 
had lost her best friend and husband to the pain. I made the decision there and then 
to seek help, and found this program.
Your body can become a resource for you instead of something to ignore or push into 
submission. When you learn to listen to your body, it can tell you how to pace yourself, 
how to plan your activities, so that you do more with less pain. Becoming aware of when 
you are in pain allows you to use your body to change your mood and sensations. You 
can begin to do more things that give you pleasure; you can have a life again. This chapter 
will show you how to do all these things.
Increasing Activities
Pain can prevent you from moving comfortably. It can make working and having fun 
more difficult, if not downright impossible at times. Through keeping your Pain Diary, 
you may be starting to see that what you do and how you do it can influence your pain. 
Keeping active while in pain requires you to use three strategies:
• Pace yourself.
• Adapt to new ways of accomplishing tasks.
• Delegate when needed.
The point of pacing yourself is to conserve your energy over the long haul. It means not 
letting the stress of pain and overactivity exhaust you. Instead of “sprinting” through an 
activity, you “walk.” Instead of working harder, you work smarter. Using this approach, 
you are more likely to get a task done without increasing your pain and suffering. Pac-
ing activities can reduce fatigue and spasm (which increase pain) because the body isn’t 
pushed to exhaustion. Pushing yourself to the point of exhaustion can increase tension, 
inflammation, and nerve irritation.
Pacing yourself for a particular activity requires observing how long it takes in a 
certain position (such as sitting or standing) or for a specific task (such as vacuuming or 
combing your hair) to increase your pain. For example, do you know how long you can 
stand before your pain goes from a 4 to a 6 on the pain scale from Chapter 1? Knowing 
when your pain is getting worse gives you an idea of how long you can stand to do the 
dishes before you sit and pay your bills. How long do you have to sit before the pain goes 
back down to 4, where it was before you started doing the dishes? Pacing yourself is about 
knowing your limits, so you can then alternate sitting with standing activities, get more 
accomplished, and not increase your pain and exhaustion. It’s good to use an external 

	
The Body–Mind Connection	
77
timer or other reminder. Even so, you have to control the temptation to do one more dish. 
Let’s take a look at John’s usual day before starting this program and his usual day now,

MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Adapting means finding new (less painful) ways to accomplish old tasks. For exam-
ple, there is no rule that dishes have to be done in the sink or clothes folded while stand-
ing. It’s quite all right to sit to do dishes in a dishpan or to fold clothes. Put a bench in the 
shower or bathtub so you can sit and scrub. Use shoes with Velcro clasps or that slip on. 
Put large-­handle grips on stirring spoons and pens. These are all ways to make your life 
easier. Such gadgets and ideas can be obtained from your local hospital’s occupational 
therapy department or on the Internet; for example, the website www.webmd.com has a 
slide show with 11 tips and tools to assist in daily functions for women with osteoarthri-
tis. (Have your browser search: “webmd osteoarthritis assistive devices” or just “assis-
tive devices.”) There are lots of interesting gadgets with which to make life and activities 
easier, and the very people who have the challenges create many of these gadgets.
Delegating is another way to conserve your energy. It’s like job sharing:
“If you carry the laundry upstairs, I’ll fold it.”
“If you get the bills together, I’ll write the checks.”
“You clean the bathrooms; I’ll pick up the living room.”
Entertain by hosting potlucks—­everyone brings a dish. Tell guests that if they volun-
teer to wash or dry dishes, they don’t have to prepare anything! Can’t do a certain task? 
Ask a friend. He or she may have something you can do in return—and don’t forget to 
pace yourself!
Pacing, adapting, and delegating allow you the most flexibility while acknowledging 
that your pain is real and that techniques for managing it can be incorporated into your 
life.
Dealing with Difficulties in Changing the Way You Do Your Activities
You may, of course, be able to think of any number of reasons for not pacing yourself or 
altering your routines:
“I should be able to              like I always did.”
“I don’t do enough as it is. How can I take a break?”
“I have to do things like everyone else, or at least like my mother [or father] did.”
“I’m too busy to take a break. What will my family do?”
“I can’t ask for help, understanding, or a change in schedule.”
“My pain is always the same no matter what I do.”
It may be difficult for you to take the lead in deciding what you can and cannot do 
(instead of living up to others’ expectations). As this book states repeatedly, however, it 

	
The Body–Mind Connection	
79
is absolutely essential that you take control. No one else can judge what you are able or 
not able to do.
The following story shows why it’s so important to examine what you do and why 
you do it.
A woman was busy fixing a Sunday pot roast. She cut off the ends of the roast in her 
preparation. Her daughter watched as she did this and asked why she cut the ends off.
“Well,” she said after some contemplation, “that’s how my mother used to pre-
pare it. Let’s call Grammy and ask her.”
She called her mother and asked.
Her mother replied, “Hmmm. . . . I guess I never thought about it before because 
my mother, your grandmother, always did it.”
Curious now as to what the answer might be, the woman called her grandmother 
to solve this culinary mystery. In response to the question, her grandmother laughed 
and laughed. “I used to cut off the ends of the pot roast because it was always too big 
to fit into the tiny roasting pan that fit in my little oven of 50 years ago!”
By examining what you do, you can decide what you want to keep and what you 
want to discard—like the ends of a pot roast. Once you have determined what you need 
(as opposed to what others expect), I recommend that you tell those around you. Other 
people will generally be supportive of changes in your routines if you explain why you 
want to make them. They certainly will welcome your being in a better mood because 
you’re in less discomfort.
Martha decided that she could stand to do dishes at the sink for only 5 minutes before 
she needed to sit down. She arranged to use her oven timer to cue her when the 5 
minutes were up. She also arranged to have her smartphone on the kitchen table, so 
that she could catch up on e-mail; she would do this for 10 minutes while she sat and 
“rested.” At first the other members of her family did not understand. Some won-
dered why she was “goofing off” in this way; others kept trying to finish the dishes 
for her when they saw her sit down. Martha was able to tell them that this was what 
she needed to do for herself and reminded them (and herself) that there was no rule 
limiting dishwashing to any specific period of time. She felt better about accomplish-
ing this task by herself, and because of her pacing she experienced no increase in pain. 
With this success, she was able to determine the time and positioning requirements 
for the other tasks she wanted to accomplish.

80	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Working Outside the Home
If you are considering a return to work or are still working, be sure you stick to a routine 
that includes taking care of yourself. Regular sleep, exercise, good nutrition, and stress 
management are good for everyone’s health. When you have chronic pain, these are espe-
cially important. They help maintain your capacity to work, as do continued pacing, 
adaptation, and delegation.
Many people complain that pacing themselves at home is all well and good, but 
at work, “It’s impossible!” Actually, you can use the same strategies in the workplace 
environment. It just takes a little more creative problem solving. For one thing, there 
are external time pressures at work; for another, pacing yourself in the workplace may 
involve synchronizing your work with that of other people. I generally recommend that 
you first identify the time and positioning requirements of your various work tasks. Next, 
create a diagram of how you can perform these tasks throughout the day using the pac-
ing routine. This should include alternating between sitting and standing tasks, as well as 
between what you can do individually and what involves other people.
You can use sticky notes for each task, with its time and positioning requirements. 
Then move the notes around on a large piece of paper to help you organize your day.
Other strategies can include setting the timer on the computer and doing a minute of 
stretching every hour, or bringing a cot to lie on while listening at meetings. Or you may 
need to work with an occupational therapist to determine job modifications or the need 
for adaptive equipment. Again, let those around you know that you have specific needs. 
Telling them what works best for you allows you to assert choice. It also gives the clear 
message that you do not need to be rescued and that the situation is under control. There 
may be many people around you who would like to help but are at a loss as to what to 
do. Give them your guidelines; help them to help you and work with you more effectively.
Finally, I have had many patients who realized that developing chronic pain gave 
them the opportunity to take another career path, one that allowed them to accommo-
date their new life with pain. They did so by returning to school or by taking technical 
training, by pursuing their more artistic and creative side, or by becoming self-­employed. 
The key is being open to the possibilities, both old and new. Try this exercise to begin 
getting in touch with the possibilities.
Make a list of the skills, interests, and dreams you have. Brainstorm with friends and 
family members. If you get stuck, go to www.amazon.com and type “career change” into 
the “Book” query box. You will find that there are many books written on the topic, and 
you may be able to find one that helps get you unstuck. Then ask yourself these questions.
“What interests me the most?”
“What am I the best at or what would I like to become better at?”
“What is my most passionate dream?”
Is there a theme here? Can you combine your answers to these three questions (or to 
others) to form a starting point? Do a reality check to make sure that any new ideas can

be worked with in pain, or identify how you might have to change them to acknowledge 
the presence of pain. Then start making a list of steps to take to accomplish this goal. 
Sound familiar? Then get started on your fact-­finding mission!
Common Problems When Becoming Active
If you find yourself needing hours or a whole day to recover from activities, you have 
probably not stopped an activity soon enough. You need to practice responding earlier 
to increases in tightness, fatigue, and pain. Your Pain Diary will help you fine-tune your 
pain sensation awareness, as will exercises described later in this chapter.
Do you find yourself experiencing delayed increases in your pain? For example, you 
clean out the garage one day without excessive pain, but the next day you ache all over 
even more than before. If so, then you are probably experiencing the effects of “decon-
ditioning.” Deconditioning refers to the decreased muscle strength and endurance that 
occur from not getting regular exercise. This is a common problem for patients with 
chronic pain, those on prolonged bed rest, or for anyone whose level of activity involving 
movement has diminished. A regular exercise (conditioning) program may be of great 
value. It will allow you to increase your endurance and limit muscle fatigue. Such a 
program may involve walking, swimming, water exercises, using a stationary bicycle or 
treadmill, or practicing tai chi or yoga (see “Aerobic Exercise,” on p. 89). The choice, of 
course, depends on where you are having pain and what your physical limitations are.
Remember, too, that your level of pain may not necessarily correlate with your abil-
ity to function. It is common to interpret the pain as meaning you shouldn’t move, but in 
many if not most chronic pain conditions, that just isn’t accurate. Many people are able 
to increase their activity level without increasing their pain. Once you go through the 
normal, expected soreness and tightness of starting an activity routine after being inac-
tive, you may find yourself in no more pain than you were before. The most successful 
rehabilitation programs are those that emphasize functional improvement in spite of the 
pain. The exercises described later in the chapter on “Listening to Your Body” may help 
you to discriminate between pain that is a cautionary signal and soreness from using 
deconditioned muscles. The value in all of this is that you may be able to become more 
active in spite of the pain and without fear of harming yourself. This fear and avoid-
ance of activity keep many people with chronic pain inactive, thereby creating more  
disability.
Time Management
In order to pace, adapt, and delegate effectively, it’s important to take a look at all that 
you do during the course of a day. In that way you can see exactly how much time you 
spend on certain activities. Many people tell me they do nothing except watch TV during 
the day and into the night. This is sad to hear because the time spent immobile in front of 
the TV affords no social interaction, decreases brain function, contributes to weight gain, 

82	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
and increases deconditioning. If you have a favorite program, it’s better to watch it from 
the treadmill, stationary bike, or during stretching exercises. Limit your TV time sitting 
still to no more than 2 hours a day.
Putting a routine schedule into your life can make you feel useful again. Getting up 
and going to bed at the same time help establish a natural body rhythm. Having your 
day planned can help you accomplish your tasks and ensure that pacing is not an after-
thought. You may also find it very helpful to prepare a backup plan in advance for man-
aging those inevitable flare-up days (see Chapter 10). If you can’t work outside the home, 
consider volunteering, tutoring, or visiting others who cannot get out of the house. You 
can apply the pacing activities described here to help you be successful and reap the good 
feelings associated with helping others.
The Time Pie
An exercise to help determine what you do during a day is to draw a pie chart or “time 
pie.” Break up your 24-hour day into the time periods that your different activities 
require. Make each activity a wedge in the time pie. For example, you may have wedges 
for sleeping, working on the job, meeting with friends, talking on the phone, reading, 
watching TV, doing housework, playing with the kids, and so on. This is a nice way to 
graphically display what really takes place each day—­something most people rarely think 
about. If your weekdays are different from your weekends, make two time pies—one for 
weekdays and one for weekends. If each day of your week is different, then make seven 
time pies. Draw your pie(s) in the space provided on the following page or on separate 
sheets of paper.
Now draw a time pie that you would find more acceptable, given your pain level and 
what you are learning from this book. Ask yourself the following questions, and write 
down your answers:
1.	 How many hours of my day are devoted to meeting others’ needs? 	
2.	 Do all of these activities really need my involvement? 	
3.	 What activities can I share with another or delegate to the persons who are currently 
requiring my time? 	
4.	 What activities that I am not currently pursuing would I like to add to (or put back into) 
my routine? 	
5.	 What steps can I take to make my present time pie into a more acceptable pie? 	
	
	
Use the space on the facing page to draw your time pies—both your current one(s) 
and your ideal one:

True Confessions: Choosing Your Activities Consciously
Most people get their sense of personal worth from the things they do. Which of your 
activities most defines you? This is important to know because it affects how you plan 
activities and manage your time. For example, you may find it very difficult not to do all 
the tasks for your family. Altruism is ennobling, but it’s not healthy for you (or for oth-
ers) if you help others mindlessly or with secret bitterness. Helping mindlessly can lead to 
overdoing and hurting yourself. Doing for others because you feel you “have to” can cre-
ate resentment and feelings of being “used and abused.” I’ll never forget one patient who 
complained about how she had to get up early every morning to pack lunches for her chil-
dren. When I inquired about their ages, thinking that if they were teenagers they might 
be old enough to pack their own lunches, she replied, “Oh, they’re 26 and 28 years old!”
Another point you may wish to consider is this: People can use pain as an excuse not 
to do things they don’t want to do. People can also use pain to control others and get 
Current
Ideal

84	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
attention they might not otherwise get. Sometimes people in chronic pain feel guilty when 
they become aware of such behaviors in themselves. I find that such behaviors are usu-
ally unconscious; they are the result of pain’s effectiveness in both getting attention and 
avoiding undesirable obligations. Understanding how you incorporate your pain experi-
ence into your life can help you choose which behaviors you may want to develop further 
or avoid.
You really do have choices. This is your opportunity to explore a new you. It’s okay 
to say “No.” It’s okay to say “Yes.” For now, it’s enough to make your choices conscious. 
If you choose to continue a certain activity or behavior, do it with your commitment and 
your choice: Own it.
Listening to Your Body
As noted at the beginning of this chapter, your body can be the source of important cues. 
By becoming aware of your body’s messages, you can avoid problems and even soothe 
yourself. This section presents a series of exercises that can help you learn to listen to your 
body. Read through the exercises once, then try them.
These exercises will help you do the following:
• Gently stretch your muscles.
• Gently move your limbs through their range of motion.
• Isolate muscle tension.
• Relabel sensations.
• Use breathing to release tension.
• Develop body awareness.
• Experience the pleasant, energizing feelings that come from simple exercise.
If your muscles are not stretched and your limbs do not go through their range of 
motion, then your stiffness, tightness, and tension will increase, especially upon rising in 
the morning. If you limit your “exercise” to the movement involved in your daily chores, 
you are likely to overextend and hurt tight muscles. Doing slow, purposeful exercises, 
such as the ones explained here, will help minimize injury.
If any of the following movements increases your pain, you can modify it so that you 
feel no pain with the gentle stretch. If you are unable to stretch a limb even gently, then 
skip it (or imagine yourself doing the stretch in your mind) and go on to the next limb.
Labeling Sensations in Your Legs
1.	 Sit comfortably in a chair.
2.	Point your right foot in front of you and lift it off the ground. Keep breathing

slowly and regularly. How would you describe the sensation you feel? Tightness, 
stretching, burning, aching? (Avoid using the word “pain” or the statement “It 
hurts”; these descriptions are too vague. Learning to describe the sensation more 
accurately may give you clues as to its cause and effect and thereby lead to more 
specific remedies.) Also, where exactly do you feel these sensations? Front of lower 
leg, across the top of the foot, around the knee?
3.	 Now, as you point your right foot, become aware of the tension you may have 
placed in your left leg, arms, or face as you engage the stretch. Make sure that only 
the right leg is tense, and relax the other parts of your body. Keep breathing slowly 
and regularly.
4.	 Take a deep breath. On the out-­breath, release the tension in your right leg, letting 
the foot gently rest once again on the floor.
5.	 Close your eyes. How does your right leg feel compared with the left leg? Warm, 
tingling, tired, vibrant?
6.	 Now point your left foot in front of you and lift it off the ground. Make sure 
you don’t get your arms or face involved in creating the tension, and keep breath-
ing regularly. What sensations do you feel? Tightness, stretching, burning,  
aching?
7.	 Take a deep breath. On the out-­breath, release the tension in your left leg, letting 
the foot rest once again on the floor.
8.	 Close your eyes and compare the feelings in your right and left legs now.
Labeling Sensations in Your Arms
While exercising your arms, make sure that your legs and face are not involved in the ten-
sion. And, once again, be sure to keep breathing slowly and regularly.
1.	 Make a fist with your right hand and hold your right arm out in front of you. How 
would you describe the sensations you feel? Where do you feel them?
2.	Take a deep breath. On the out-­breath, relax your fist and let the tension go, 
gently bringing your arm back down to your lap. How does your right arm feel 
compared to the left one?
3.	 Now make a fist with your left hand and hold your left arm out in front of you. 
What sensations do you feel? Where do you feel them?
4.	 Take a deep breath. On the out-­breath, relax your fist and let the tension go, 
returning your arm to your lap. How does your left arm feel compared with the 
right one?

86	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Labeling Sensations in Your Shoulders
Like the other exercises, this exercise should be done slowly, accompanied by slow, deep 
breaths.
1.	 Put the fingertips of both hands on their respective shoulders.
2.	Raise your elbows out from your sides and rotate the elbows as if you are drawing 
circles in the air.
3.	 Move your elbows in circles with each breath, so that each complete circle takes 
one slow breath. Make sure that the tension is only in your shoulders and upper 
back.
4.	 Draw circles in one direction five times, then draw circles in the other direction 
five times.
5.	 Take a deep breath. On the out-­breath, let your hands fall gently back into your 
lap.
6.	 Close your eyes and see whether you can distinguish any sensation (tired, achy, 
vibrant, burning?) in your upper back, shoulders, and neck.
Labeling Sensations in Your Face
As in the previous exercises, relaxed breathing is very important; however, it may be a bit 
more difficult in this case because of the facial movements involved.
1.	 Imagine that you have just bitten into a lemon and wrinkle your face.
2.	Feel the tension in your face, and check to see whether the rest of your body is 
relaxed.
3.	 Keep breathing slowly and regularly. (This may be hard to do through a wrinkled 
nose!)
4.	 Take a deep breath. On the out-­breath, relax your face.
5.	 Close your eyes. Now check out your whole body by doing a “body sweep.” That 
is, use your mind like a flashlight and shine it on each part of your body that you 
have just stretched. Release any residual tension by breathing into the tense area 
and breathing out the tension. How do you feel?
Rating Your Pain
The following exercise will help you translate physical sensation into numbers. You may 
find this especially helpful if you have had any difficulty in giving your pain a numerical 

	
The Body–Mind Connection	
87
rating in your Pain Diary. You will use a scale of 0 to 10 for rating the sensation in mak-
ing different kinds of fists, with 0 being the loosest fist and 10 being the tightest fist. Read 
through to the end of these instructions, and then do the exercise before you continue.
1.	 Make a number 5 fist. How would you describe the sensations you feel? Where do 
you feel them?
2.	Relax the fist.
3.	 Now make a number 2 fist. What sensations do you feel? Where do you feel them? 
What makes the number 2 fist different from the number 5 fist?
4.	 Relax the fist.
5.	 Now make a number 9 fist. What sensations do you feel? Where do you feel them? 
What makes the number 9 fist different from the number 5 fist?
6.	 Relax the fist.
Be sure to try this exercise before you read on.
The following are some comments made by patients who did this exercise:
“Sensation is relative, and so is pain.”
“A number 2 pain is more tolerable than a number 5 pain, but even a number 5 pain 
is tolerable compared to a number 9 pain.”
“A number 2 pain is more localized, with the pain spreading away from the original 
painful area as the rating goes higher. . . . The higher the number given the pain, the 
more dysfunction is associated with it, both physically and emotionally.”
When pain spreads, it is often because of the added tension of holding your breath 
in response to pain. Remember the first breath-­focusing exercise in Chapter 3 (the fist–
breath exercise)? The pain sensation focuses your attention on the point in pain. This in 
turn increases your awareness of the pain, which increases your distress, which increases 
the muscle tension, and so on. Instead, you can take a deep breath and breathe out slowly.
Apply this to your own pain rating. See whether you can discern the subtleties of your 
sensations. What you once thought was only one sensation may in fact be many. Develop 
an awareness of the muscle tension that comes from holding your breath or breathing 
shallowly. Can you identify the normal sensations of tightness and “good hurts” that are 
part of beginning an exercise routine? Continued practice with a relaxation technique 
will also help fine-tune this awareness. When you can distinguish these sensations, you 
will be better able to do activities and exercises safely. Even if these simple sensation-­
labeling exercises are all you can do on a regular basis, they will help keep your muscles, 
bones, and joints healthy.

MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Using Your Body to Change Your Mood
People communicate in many ways that have nothing to do with their words. My patients 
sometimes confide that they no longer tell their friends or family members when they are 
having a bad day. But they tell me this as they sit with their shoulders sagging and brows 
tense. They grimace as they frequently change positions, and they sigh a lot. Who’s kid-
ding whom?
These subtle behaviors are definite communications with the outside world. Some-
times the outside world is listening. But sometimes not being direct allows others to 
ignore you or to interpret your actions incorrectly. Most people cannot imagine living 
with chronic pain. When your body and your words give mixed messages, confusion 
results for you and for those watching you. Plus, when you assume body postures and 
facial expressions like the ones just described, you may be reinforcing negative emotions 
and making your situation even worse than it already is.
Try this simple exercise:
1.	 Raise your eyebrows and show your teeth.
2.	Hold this posture for 30 seconds. What kinds of thoughts pass through your 
mind? (Ignore the ones that say you must look goofy.)
3.	 Relax.
4.	 Now bring your eyebrows together and clench your jaw and fists. What are you 
thinking now?
The first expression is usually associated with happiness, and the second one with 
anger and rage. How did you feel? Psychologist Paul Ekman and his colleagues (see the 
“Supplementary Reading” section at the end of this chapter) have shown that assuming 
the facial expression that matches a specific emotion—such as happiness or anger—can 
produce the physiological changes linked to that emotion. When more of your body gets 
involved in the expression, the emotional connection is even greater.
Now for the final exercise in this chapter. This may be a bit uncomfortable for you, 
but it is important because it can help you get in touch with your body–mind connection. 
If the sitting position is too difficult, you can do the exercise lying on your bed in a fetal 
position—knees to chest, head down toward chest.
1.	 Sit in a chair.
2.	Bend your head down, hunch your shoulders, cross your arms in front of you, and 
cross your legs.
3.	 Close your eyes for 1 minute. What do you feel emotionally? Do not use the word 
“pain,” and stick to descriptions of emotions, not descriptions of physical sensa-
tions.

	
The Body–Mind Connection	
89
4.	 Relax.
5.	 Now stand up and place your feet apart, approximately the width of your hips.
6.	 Keep your shoulders back, your head up, your face to the front, and your arms 
down at your sides with the palms facing forward.
7.	 Close your eyes. What do you feel now?
The first position is associated with a wide range of feelings, such as the following:
• Sadness
• Weakness
• Being afraid
• Feeling defenseless
• Feeling safe
• Feeling secure
The second position is usually associated with these feelings:
• Feeling strong
• Being exposed
• Being open to the possibilities
• Being in control
Your emotional responses to body posture reflect a complex body–mind language 
that you have learned automatically over the years. This is why people will sometimes 
experience strong emotional reactions during massage therapy or certain physical therapy 
procedures. This muscular imprinting of emotions and old habits is also the principle 
behind various movement therapies, in particular, Feldenkrais and the Alexander tech-
nique.
When you are feeling sad, try to change your facial expression and body posture to 
those associated with joy and happiness. See how difficult it is to continue feeling sad. 
Or, if you’re committed to suffering for the moment, exaggerate your suffering expression 
and posture even more. Don’t forget to add a few moans. If you do this consciously, you 
may be surprised at the results. Misery loves company, even if it’s your own.
Aerobic Exercise
There is a long list of diseases associated with a sedentary lifestyle—for example, heart 
disease, obesity, and osteoporosis. The risk of developing these disorders can be reduced 

90	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
by regular aerobic exercise. Just because you’re in pain doesn’t mean you need to neglect 
your overall health and well-being—quite the contrary, in fact.
In a perfect world moderate aerobic exercise at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days or 
more a week, is recommended to help improve your general health, particularly your 
heart and lung function. It can also help with weight control at 60 minutes a day and 
weight loss at 90 minutes a day. However, when you have chronic pain and moving 
hurts, these goals need to be modified to take into consideration your particular level 
of strength, physical fitness, and area of pain. Aerobic exercise (aerobic means literally 
“requires oxygen”) elevates heart rate through sustained movements of the body at mod-
erate intensity. Activities such as brisk walking, swimming, and bicycling are considered 
aerobic exercise.
A lot of people who have pain are afraid to move because they fear they will harm 
themselves further and increase the pain. For most chronic pain conditions movement 
does not cause increased harm. But by not moving and by not stretching or exercising, 
you can become even more out of shape and more at risk for further injury. Exercise 
therapy has been shown to be associated with decreased pain and increased function in 
chronic low back pain, knee and hip pain in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and 
fibromyalgia (see Cochrane Library, “Exercise for Musculoskeletal Conditions,” in the 
“Supplementary Reading” section). Consult your physician or a physical therapist if you 
have specific questions regarding what you can do and how you should proceed. The 
Arthritis Foundation (www.arthritis.org) can be a resource for more information in your  
area.
For people in pain, exercising in the water can be especially relaxing, because about 
90% of the effects of gravity are lost in water. Movement in water offers the opportunity 
to strengthen muscles, stretch, and increase heart and lung function. Since movement is 
so much easier in water, however, you may be tempted to exercise longer and harder. It’s 
always best to start out doing much less than you think you can do and gradually increase 
the length or intensity of your water exercise as you progress.
Other forms of aerobic exercise that can give you a good workout include the follow-
ing:
• Riding a bicycle outdoors or stationary bike indoors, where the speed and pedal 
resistance are more controllable.
• Cross-­country skiing, classic style.
• Walking. (This is a particularly good exercise, as it’s inexpensive and can be done 
almost anywhere, indoors, outdoors, or on a treadmill, where the speed and incline 
can be adjusted for more control over intensity.)
• Yoga or tai chi. (These exercises are helpful to patients in pain because they are 
slow, purposeful, and coordinated with breathing. They can also be easily adapted 
for those with limited movement. It is important, however, to get individual 
instruction and work with an instructor who can modify the positions to meet 
your needs.)

	
The Body–Mind Connection	
91
Strengthening and Stretching
The addition of an easy-paced, warm-up routine before and stretching after your aerobic 
exercise can help muscles stay more flexible and less tight, decreasing the risk of injury. 
Yoga, for example, incorporates stretching as you progress through the positions from 
easier to more challenging.
Strengthening exercises with weights or repeated movements with or without resis-
tance allows muscles to become stronger and more efficient and can help increase endur-
ance during aerobic exercise. A personal trainer or physical therapist, books (for example, 
the works of Miriam Nelson et al. in “Supplementary Reading”), or online videos can 
guide you in the addition of strengthening exercises to your routine.
Pleasurable Activities
	
Little Things
	
Most of us miss out on life’s big prizes.
	
The Pulitzer. The Nobel. Oscars. Tonys. Emmys.
	
But we’re all eligible for life’s small pleasures.
	
A pat on the back.
	
A kiss behind the ear.
	
A four-pound bass.
	
A full moon.
	
An empty parking space.
	
A crackling fire. A great meal. A glorious sunset.
	
Hot soup.
	
Cold beer.
	
Don’t fret about copping life’s grand awards.
	
Enjoy its tiny delights.
	
There are plenty for all of us.
—Anonymous
Pleasurable activities should constitute a normal part of life, but for many living with 
chronic pain, they simply don’t. Some patients feel so bad about their pain and their lack 
of a “productive life” that they cannot engage in pleasurable activities or even admit they 
want to. They feel that they don’t deserve any pleasure.
The truth of the matter is that if you can’t do something pleasurable, it will be dif-
ficult to increase your activities in general. It’s easier to start becoming involved in life 
again by doing something that gives you pleasure or gives others pleasure.
There is any number of ways to pursue pleasurable activities, but let’s just say that 
you should do something purposeful, conscious, and enjoyable on a regular basis. It can 
be as simple as feeding the birds, watching the sunset, or observing children at play. 
It doesn’t have to be an activity, though it can be. It’s often the little things in life that 
make our days meaningful. The key here is to make it conscious and purposeful. As the 
philosopher Epictetus (circa c.e. 55–135) said, “Practice yourself, for heaven’s sake, in 
little things; and thence proceed to greater.” Take an active part in creating your own 

92	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
happiness. Doing someone else’s idea of a pleasurable activity doesn’t count unless you 
truly take pleasure from that person’s enjoyment. When you have completed your plea-
surable activity, don’t spend 10 minutes describing how miserable you were and apologiz-
ing for engaging in it. There is something to be said for counting your blessings.
It’s possible that you may be intimidated by having to seek out a pleasurable activity. 
Substituting the word “satisfying” or “beautiful” for “pleasurable” helps. Look for some-
thing that you can feel satisfied with or that has a beauty you can appreciate—­something 
that makes you smile.
Quick Skill
Notice one thing a day that makes you smile or makes you feel good: the sun shining, a 
blue sky, a rainbow, the scent of lavender, the warmth of a shower.
Once you have discovered and enjoyed a pleasurable activity, try sharing it with some-
one. For example, if you just saw a beautiful sunrise on your way to work, share it with a 
colleague. People, it seems, are always willing to give a litany of their disappointments, 
but it is amazing how uplifting the sharing of pleasures can be. It’s also a lovely way to 
begin dinner conversation. Let everyone have a turn to report a little pleasure they noted 
that day. Life has a whole different feel to it when you become an active participant.
In short, it’s okay to do something nice and pleasurable for yourself. You’re worth it!
Summary
Increasing Activities
• You can keep active while in pain by using pacing, adapting, and delegating.
• When the body is not in a constant state of exhaustion, it has a chance to recover 
more effectively.
Time Management
• Drawing a “time pie” can help you identify your daily activities and the time spent 
on them; it provides you with a picture of how you spend each day.
• Take a look at each activity and examine why you engage in it.
• Consider asking for assistance from others who are capable of helping.
Listening to Your Body
• Developing an awareness of your body by doing exercises in which you label the 
sensations in different areas can help you to increase activity safely. It also lets you 
stop activities that might be increasing your pain earlier than you might otherwise.

	
The Body–Mind Connection	
93
• Try gentle stretching exercises that move your limbs through their range of motion. 
This will also help you label sensations in various parts of your body.
• The exercises also help relieve the stress, tension, and stiffness usually associated 
with inactivity.
• Learn to stop labeling all body sensations as painful. Distinguishing pain from 
other sensations will help you to pace activities, such as exercise, more realistically.
Using Your Body to Change Your Mood
• Your body posture and facial expression can either bring your emotions down 
further or lift your spirits.
• Pay attention to how your body is communicating with the outside world as well as 
with your internal world; you have the power to change how you feel.
Aerobic Exercise
• Aerobic exercise at least five times a week can help improve your general health, 
particularly your heart and lung function; it can also help with weight control.
• Water exercises are particularly helpful, because about 90% of the effects of grav-
ity are lost in water.
• Other types of exercise that can give you a good workout include the following:
 Riding a stationary bike
 Walking on a treadmill or outside
 Cross-­country skiing
 Yoga or tai chi
Pleasurable Activities
• Pleasurable activities should be conscious and purposeful. They help you become 
more involved in life and make your days meaningful.
• Once you have discovered a pleasurable activity, share it with someone.
• You deserve to engage in pleasurable activities for your psychological and physical 
health.
Exploration Tasks
1.	 Reread this chapter and do the various exercises as they are presented, if you have not 
already done so.
2.	 Write out a goal related to this chapter that you want to accomplish. As in earlier 

94	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
goal-­setting exercises, make sure your goal is a behavioral task that you can measure in 
terms of the steps that you will take to accomplish it. Here is an example:
Goal:   Do the stretches described in the section “Listening to Your Body,” labeling	
 sensations in legs, arms, shoulders, and face once a day.	
Steps to take to reach that goal:
A.	  Use the kitchen chair. 	
B.	  Place the instructions on a second chair beside me. 	
C.	  Do the stretches just before I do my RR technique. 	
Now it’s your turn.
Goal: 	
	
Steps to take to reach that goal:
A.	 	
B.	 	
C.	 	
D.	 	
Now make some contingency plans: First, identify any obstacles that might get in the 
way of your accomplishing this goal; then devise some solutions to work around the 
obstacles and ensure the success of this goal. See Chapter 3’s section on “Problem Solv-
ing” for some ideas (p. 58).

3.	 Identify some type of stretching exercise that you can do daily. What will you do? How 
often will you be able to do it? 	
4.	 Identify some type of aerobic exercise that you can do at least five times a week. What 
will you do? 	
How often will you be able to do it?

5.	 Identify some type of strengthening program that you can do three times per week. This 
can involve isometrics with an elasticized cord for that purpose, free weights, or weight 
machines. Good resources for women (and men) are Strong Women Stay Young and 
Strong Women and Men Beat Arthritis (see the “Supplementary Reading” section). Ask 
your medical professional for recommendations or for a physical therapy referral for a 
safe exercise program you can do that takes all your physical limitations (not only your 
pain) into consideration.
What will you do? 	
How often will you be able to do it? 	
6.	 Continue with one of the basic relaxation techniques 1–7 (see Chapter 3) at least once a 
day.
7.	 Create a pleasurable activity and engage in it once a week at a minimum. Share it with 
someone. This could be looking through a picture book at the library or a family album, 
sitting in front of a warm fireplace, listening to your favorite symphony, watching chil-
dren play. . . .
List some pleasurable activities that you might like to try:
	
	
	
	
(Don’t forget the spontaneous pleasures, like listening to children’s laughter or reveling 
in a sunny day.)
8.	 If your pain increases with certain activities or postures during your daily routine, take 
some time to fill out the “Increasing Activities Worksheet” in Appendix F (and available 
for downloading at www.guilford.com/managepain). Determine your average daily level 
of pain from your daily Pain Diary sheet. This is your baseline level of pain.
Now make a list of activities that increase and decrease your pain. What are the com-
mon threads identifying each category? Posture? Length of time? Fatigue? Motivation? 
What happens if you alternate the activities that increase pain with those that decrease 
pain? Can you fine-tune any of the activities to make them easier to do in bits, like John 
did (for example, dividing the laundry to carry downstairs into four smaller bundles)?
Remember, the goal is to keep active while not significantly increasing the pain. This 
takes changes in your daily routine, but a lot can still be accomplished.
Beware of telling yourself, “Just one more dish [task, minute, etc.] before stopping.” 
Use external cues such as timers to dictate when the time is up and your position needs 
to be changed.
As you continue working with the entire program, you will need to reassess your 

96	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
routine periodically, because your endurance may increase as your fatigue decreases. 
Make copies of the Increasing Activities Worksheet so that you can reassess your progress 
periodically.

The Power of the Mind
My anxiety stems from a feeling that no one is there to take care of 
me. If I give in to the pain, react the way I really feel, my world will 
fall apart, I won’t have any income, my husband will leave, no one 
will like me. I am worried all the time about getting things done, 
screwing things up, letting others down, making other people angry. 
I need to escape. I need to be released from these worries by hav-
ing someone say: “Start over. Build a life based on what you want, 
and let the other chips fall where they may.” If I did that, what if I 
couldn’t figure out what I wanted? What if I was still unhappy and 
without a husband, job, or money?
—Passage from a writing exercise on pain by Joan, a patient
Harnessing the Power of the Mind: Cognitive Techniques
Considerable evidence is accumulating that automatic patterns of thinking can affect a 
person’s health, coping ability, and maybe even ability to modulate pain. These thinking 
patterns affect how a person interprets the pain, gives meaning to it, and his or her beliefs 
about the pain. The meaning of pain can be influenced by anxiety level and how much 
the person feels out of control. Beliefs, such as you shouldn’t move if you have pain or 
that damage is occurring every time you move, can increase your despair, inactivity, and 
sense of helplessness.
Certain negative interpretations, beliefs, and behaviors are associated with disability 
in chronic pain, in particular, interpretations that catastrophize, deny, or seek to avoid the 
situation. To catastrophize is to think that something is much worse than it actually is. 
Catastrophizing has been of special interest to those studying the negative thoughts and 
beliefs of people with chronic pain. Psychologist Michael Sullivan has studied catastro-
phizing and defines it as having three important features: repeated worrying that things 
will get worse (for example, “I can’t stop thinking that the pain will only get worse”); 

98	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
thinking that the negative events are huge and overwhelming (for example, “This has 
ruined my life—I can’t take it.”); and extreme helplessness (for example, “There is noth-
ing I can do to reduce the intensity of this pain”). The evidence is quite strong that pain 
catastrophizing is associated with increased pain and reduced ability to function physi-
cally and psychologically.
Denial allows people to ignore their need to pace activities (for example, “Nothing 
is wrong with me”; “I should be able to do this”). Avoidance of social events can isolate 
and avoidance of movement can weaken muscles (for example, “If I don’t move at all, I 
won’t increase the damage”).
We know from research that people with beliefs about pain like the following tend to 
have more negative emotions and disability: “The pain is mysterious and unknowable”; 
“What happens to me is determined by chance”; or “Whatever happens to me is out of 
my control.” However, we know that thinking patterns can be changed. You are not help-
less. You can feel more in control, less fearful, and less anxious. That is why I strongly 
encourage you to take the following pages to heart: so that you gain access to information 
about pain that makes it all less mysterious. It is why a healthy approach to pain manage-
ment includes exploration of your thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. This exploration can 
take advantage of the complex mind–body experience of pain. It can also help repair 
damaged self-­esteem and help you gain control over your pain.
The mind—the source of our thoughts and feelings—gives meaning to our experi-
ences, including those involving pain. If you are in a self-­defeated, hopeless frame of 
mind, you will most likely interpret pain signals in a negative way, increasing your dis-
tress and despair. The mind is like a filter; the pain signal passes through it and is either 
reduced or magnified. On a warm, sunny day, when someone has just said “I love you,” 
or when you have received an e-mail from a friend you’ve been missing, your pain experi-
ence may not be as grim as it is on a cold, rainy day when no one has called you in weeks 
and you have nothing to do.
You have already begun to harness the power of the mind with your practice of 
focused relaxation and the mindfulness techniques (see Chapter 3). The work described 
in this chapter asks you to explore some of the things that determine how you see the 
world around you. The techniques presented here are called “cognitive techniques.” 
“Cognitive” comes from “cognition,” which means, “knowing” or “thinking.” To begin, 
let’s look at the content of what you think and how that influences your emotions.
Self-Talk: Your Automatic Thoughts
Listen to what you say to yourself as you react to situations. We call this “self-talk.” 
Many emotions are prolonged, if not created, by self-talk. If you change the way you talk 
to yourself, you can actually change how you feel.
Reread the passage from Joan’s writing exercise presented at the beginning of this 
chapter. What do your feel? Do you sense the panic, anxiety, and fear that she felt just by 
reading her written thoughts? If you do, it shows you the power of thoughts. If you find 

	
The Power of the Mind	
99
yourself judging the content instead, you may benefit from reading the section on empa-
thy and self-­compassion in the next chapter.
Self-talk can just as easily produce positive as well as negative emotions. Some people 
are thought to routinely practice positive self-talk (the optimists); others go through a 
daily torrent of negative thoughts (the pessimists). The following excerpt from The Sub-
tleties of the Inimitable Mulla Nasrudin, a collection of Middle Eastern tales by Idries 
Shah, demonstrates the point.
I Only Hope I’m Ill
Nasrudin came late among the crowd waiting for the doctor’s attentions. He was repeat-
ing in a loud voice, over and over again: “I hope I’m very ill, I hope I’m very ill.” He so 
demoralized the other sufferers that they insisted on his going in to see the physician 
first.
“I only hope I’m very ill!”
“Why?”
“I’d hate to think that anyone who feels like me was really fit and well!” (p. 78)
For obvious reasons, you will want to address self-talk that is negative. You already 
feel bad enough, and sustained negative thoughts and emotions take the joy out of living. 
They also add to feelings of helplessness and hopelessness and can increase disability.
Self-talk is automatic, happens very quickly, and doesn’t always come in complete 
sentences. For example, let’s suppose that you wake up in the morning and open your 
eyes. You make your first attempt to get out of bed and you become aware of the pain. 
You might say to yourself: “It’s still here. Groan! I can’t stand it anymore! When will it go 
away? I’ve suffered enough. I’m useless! I’ll never get better. This is going to be a miser-
able day. Life is miserable. I’m miserable. No one cares!” If you talk to yourself like this, 
why wouldn’t you feel sad or despondent?
Be careful not to confuse the label negative thinking with judging such thoughts as 
“bad” or “good.” The issue is not whether they are good or bad, but whether they are 
helpful or unhelpful or even accurate.
We all engage in negative self-talk at one time or another. However, much nega-
tive self-talk is inaccurate. It can distort events in ways that make us feel defeated and 
helpless. In the “getting out of bed” example, the self-talk about pain is depressing and 
anxiety-­provoking because it combines both true and untrue statements. It’s true that the 
pain is still there and you’re miserable. However, the other statements are exaggerated, 
all-or-­nothing assumptions whose accuracy can and should be challenged. You aren’t 
necessarily useless because you have pain, and you really don’t know whether the whole 
day will be miserable. In any event, what’s that got to do with people caring about you?
There is power in cognitive work because it gives you the opportunity to challenge 
what you say to yourself. Is what you say to yourself accurate? Are there other ways to 
look at your situation? A passage from The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasru-
din, another of Idries Shah’s books, illustrates this point:

100	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
I Believe You Are Right!
The Mulla was made magistrate. During his first case, the plaintiff argued so persua-
sively that [Nasrudin] exclaimed: “I believe that you are right!” The clerk of the court 
begged him to restrain himself, for the defendant had not been heard yet.
Nasrudin was so carried away by the eloquence of the defendant that he cried out 
as soon as the man had finished his evidence: “I believe you are right!” The clerk of the 
court could not allow this.
“Your honor, they cannot both be right.”
“I believe you are right!” said Nasrudin. (p. 48)
Suppose that you are driving to an appointment and get caught in traffic. Let’s imag-
ine two different ways you could respond:
Response 1
The thoughts: “I can’t believe this is happening to me! Where did all these people 
come from? Don’t they know I have an important appointment? I’ll never make it on 
time. This always happens to me. I should have known the traffic would be heavy. 
I’m so stupid. What a jerk!”
Physical response: Increased blood pressure and heart rate; short, shallow breathing; 
increased muscle tension . . . in short, the stress response.
Emotional response: Anger, frustration, and guilt.
Response 2
The thoughts: “The traffic is horrible today. It couldn’t happen at a worse time for 
me. My options to get out of this traffic jam are limited because I’m on a bridge. I 
may be late, but I can’t control that right now. I’ll call and let them know where I am 
and reschedule my appointment if I’m too late. Then I can use this opportunity to 
practice some diaphragmatic breathing while I listen to my favorite music. I’ll take a 
mini-­vacation!”
Physical response: A decrease in blood pressure and heart rate; slowed breathing; 
decreased muscle tension.
Emotional response: Resolution, acceptance, and control.
What are the differences in the two sets of responses? What is it in the nature of 
the thoughts in Response 1 that might make you angry and frustrated? Underline the 
statements in Response 1 that are an accurate description of the situation. Now consider 
Response 2: How is it different from Response 1? Underline the statements in Response 
2 that accurately describe the situation.
Your immediate reaction to all of this may be that you have a right to get agitated 

	
The Power of the Mind	
101
and frustrated when bad things happen. You certainly do! But we are talking about mak-
ing choices that do not cause more harm. If you choose to get aggravated and agitated, 
go right ahead. However, if such negative feelings increase your physical pain, anger, and 
frustration, then read on.
Irrational and Distorted Thoughts
Where do these “wild and crazy” thoughts come from? Why are they sometimes such 
distortions of what is really going on? Psychological research is helping us to appreciate 
the potential of the mind and to understand how and why we think the way we do.
The following observations may stimulate you to begin your own journey toward 
greater awareness of your thinking processes:
• Our cultural beliefs and vocabulary influence what we perceive of the world and 
how we perceive it (Edward Hall and Robert Cialdini).
• Our predisposition for short-term planning leaves us vulnerable to long-term con-
sequences (Robert Ornstein).
• Gender, as well as culture, influences our interpersonal communication (Deborah 
Tannen). (See the “Supplementary Reading” section at the end of the chapter for 
these authors’ works.)
A good place to start is to identify the assumptions and beliefs that lie behind your 
self-talk. Psychologists and other thinkers have made several attempts at identifying the 
sources of negative thoughts, and these ideas are not necessarily new. For example, nearly 
two millennia ago, the philosopher Epictetus (circa c.e. 55–135) wrote:
Men are disturbed not by things which happen, but by their opinions about the 
things. . . . When we are impeded or disturbed or grieved, let us never blame others, but 
ourselves, that is our opinion. It is the act of an ill-­instructed man to blame others for 
his bad condition; it is the act of one who has begun to be instructed, to lay the blame 
on himself; and of one whose instruction is completed, neither to blame another, nor 
himself. (The Encheiridion)
Ellis’s Irrational Beliefs
Psychologist Albert Ellis developed a way to challenge exaggerated thoughts and replace 
them with more realistic ones. Called “rational–­emotive behavior therapy,” it is based on 
the idea that much of our suffering comes from the irrational ways we think about the 
world. Self-­defeating thoughts limit our possibilities. Here is a list of Ellis’s 10 primary 
“irrational beliefs” (from Ellis; see the “Supplementary Reading” section). I like to call 
them “the assumptions and beliefs that get us into trouble.”

102	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
  1.	 It is an absolute necessity for an adult to have love and approval from peers, fam-
ily, and friends.
  2.	 You must be unfailingly competent and almost perfect in all you undertake.
  3.	 Certain people are evil, wicked, and villainous and should be punished.
  4.	 It is horrible when people and things are not the way you would like them to be.
  5.	 External events cause most human misery—people simply react as events trigger 
their emotions.
  6.	 You should feel fear or anxiety about anything that is unknown, uncertain, or 
potentially dangerous.
  7.	 It is easier to avoid than to face life’s difficulties and responsibilities.
  8.	 You need something other or stronger or greater than yourself to rely on.
  9.	 The past has a lot to do with determining the present.
10.	 Happiness can be achieved by inaction, passivity, and endless leisure.
These beliefs are not necessarily irrational or crazy. That is, they are not absolutely 
untrue under all circumstances. But they are certainly irrational if you believe they are 
absolutely true under all circumstances. For example, making mistakes does feel horrible, 
but it is also part of being human. Furthermore, you can learn from your mistakes and 
so they can have value.
The Nature of “Truth”
Your first response after reading the list of Ellis’s irrational beliefs may be this: “But how 
can these be irrational? They are all true!” If so, take a moment to think about the nature 
of “truth.”
I’ll never forget talking with a group of patients about being stuck in a traffic jam 
while cars passed by illegally in the breakdown lane. The condemnations poured out: 
“They have no right to do that!” “They’re creeps!” “Where are the police when you need 
them?” I then asked how many had never driven in the breakdown lane on that road. 
Nobody raised a hand.
We get caught up in the “truth” sometimes, but whose “truth” are we talking about? 
A passage from a third Idries Shah collection, The Exploits of the Incomparable Mulla 
Nasrudin, illustrates that this can be a tricky question:
How Nasrudin Created Truth
“Laws as such do not make people better,” said Nasrudin to the King. “They must 
practice certain things in order to become attuned to inner truth. This form of truth 
resembles apparent truth only slightly.”

	
The Power of the Mind	
103
The King decided that he could, and would, make people observe the truth. He 
could make them practice truthfulness.
His city was entered by a bridge. On this he built a gallows. The following day, 
when the gates were opened at dawn, the Captain of the Guard was stationed with a 
squad of troops to examine all who entered.
An announcement was made: “Everyone will be questioned. If he tells the truth, he 
will be allowed to enter. If he lies, he will be hanged.”
Nasrudin stepped forward.
“Where are you going?”
“I am on my way,” said Nasrudin slowly, “to be hanged.”
“We don’t believe you!”
“Very well, if I have told a lie, hang me!”
“But if we hang you for lying, we will have made what you said come true!”
“That’s right; now you know what the truth is—YOUR truth!” (p. 7)
Twelve Types of Thinking Errors
Another way of classifying negative self-talk comes from psychiatrist Aaron Beck, the 
developer of cognitive-­behavioral therapy, and his daughter, psychologist Judith Beck. 
They describe 12 common mistakes in thinking (also called “cognitive distortions”) that 
can alter our perceptions about what is going on around us. These errors also fuel cata-
strophic thinking. In fact, one of them is called “catastrophic thinking.” See if some of 
the following sound familiar to you:
  1.	 All-or-­nothing thinking. The person who thinks in all-or-­nothing ways tries to 
make hard and fast rules about the way things should be. For example, you used 
to play baseball on the weekends before you developed chronic pain. Now you 
find yourself thinking, “If I can’t play baseball, I can’t enjoy the sport anymore 
at all.”
There is an apparent advantage to thinking in all-or-­nothing terms. It feels 
more predictable and creates the feeling that there is order in the world around 
you. This, in turn, should give you an edge in controlling your world. Unfortu-
nately, it doesn’t work that way. Uncertainty is all that we have. Living comfort-
ably with uncertainty is possible, but it takes time to master. The skills you are 
learning will help.
  2.	 Catastrophizing. Predicting the future negatively without considering other more 
likely outcomes. You “know” that things will turn out badly. You predict the bad 
outcome as an established fact. For example, you wake up with a headache. You 
say, “Now my whole day is ruined. I had so much to do and I’ll never get it all 
done.”
  3.	 Disqualifying or discounting the positive. Taking neutral or even positive experi-
ences and turning them into negative ones. For example, a friend comes over to 
visit and tells you that you look great. Your immediate thought is this: “I don’t 

104	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
feel great. She doesn’t understand.” Maybe not, but try a simple “Thank you” 
first before you check it out. Maybe you don’t look as bad as you feel!
  4.	 Emotional reasoning. If you feel that something is right, then it must be true. For 
example, you find yourself thinking, “I feel useless. [Therefore] I am useless.” 
Emotions have a lot of energy bound up in them, and this “fuel” can give inac-
curate weight to our self-talk at times.
  5.	 Labeling. Identifying a mistake or negative quality and then describing an entire 
situation or individual in terms of that quality. For example, instead of seeing 
yourself as an individual who has a pain problem, you find yourself saying, “I’m 
a pain and my whole life is ruined.”
  6.	 Magnification and minification. In magnification, you amplify the importance 
of a negative event or mistake. For example, if you have a flare-up in your pain, 
you say to yourself, “I can’t stand this! I can’t take this anymore!” As a matter 
of fact, you can take it, just as you took it the day before. You may not want to, 
and that’s okay, but you can take it. In minification, you take positive personal 
qualities or events and deny their importance. For example, a family member 
comments on how nice it is to see you at a family outing, and you reply, “A lot of 
good it does if I can’t participate in the activities.”
  7.	 Mental filtering. Letting one negative aspect of an experience determine how you 
see the whole situation. For example, you are preparing lunch for some friends 
and discover that you do not have an essential ingredient. All you can think 
about is how the whole lunch will be ruined. It gives you indigestion.
  8.	 Mind reading. You assume you know what someone is thinking or why he or 
she does something. For example, you pass a coworker in the hallway and say 
“Hi!” He doesn’t respond. You think, “He must be upset with me. What did I 
do wrong?” When you check it out, you find that the coworker was preoccupied 
about a sick child he had just left at home.
  9.	 Overgeneralization. One morning you wake up in more pain and think, “I’ll 
never be able to enjoy anything anymore, ever.” Expanding on an adverse event 
in this way unnecessarily increases your misery.
10.	 Personalization. Taking responsibility for a negative event even when the cir-
cumstances are beyond your control. For example, you and your spouse go out 
to eat at a fancy restaurant you had chosen, but the service and food are poor. 
You find yourself feeling responsible for making a bad choice and “ruining” your 
evening together.
11.	 “Should” and “must” statements. You attempt to inspire—or browbeat—­
yourself by saying things like “I should be able to do that,” “I must go,” “I 
shouldn’t feel this way.” Such statements set you up to feel irritated and harassed. 

	
The Power of the Mind	
105
They also imply that you are complying with an invisible external authority such 
as the “clean-house police” or “Miss Manners.”
12.	 Tunnel vision. You see only the negative aspects of a situation. Everything in 
your life is pain-­related. Your world has shrunk around the pain. All you can see 
is how it limits you.
Old Sound Loops
The irrational beliefs and cognitive distortions described above are like old sound loops, 
recordings from our early experiences as children that repeat and repeat. They reflect 
our observations of our families, our teachers, and the larger society. Loretta Laroche, a 
comedian who teaches these principles through humor, conjures up a powerful image of 
a big yellow school bus that each person drives through life. Various people get on and 
off, but some have a lifetime ticket. They may include parents, teachers, ex-­lovers, friends, 
and mentors, both alive and dead. There’s always someone who thinks he or she knows 
the best way of getting you where you’re going, and sometimes that person will be found 
in the driver’s seat. But this is your opportunity to decide who’s really driving your bus. 
To return to the metaphor, it’s your opportunity to replace your old self-talk loops with 
some new ones.
There are different kinds of loops with different recurring themes. For example, you 
either assume all the responsibility or none of it (“The pain is all my fault” or “The pain is 
all your fault”). Or you expect a consistency in the world that doesn’t exist (“If I’m good, 
bad things won’t happen to me”). Or perhaps you hope for the best but expect the worst 
(“I’m feeling better this morning, but if I tell anyone, the pain might get worse”). Think-
ing in restricted, unconscious patterns (the old loops) often robs you of the flexibility 
needed to cope with the ever-­changing world and your personal problems. The ability to 
stay focused in the present and to consider your options as they present themselves can be 
a very powerful survival mechanism to supplement your skills of pain management (see 
Daniel Goleman in the “Supplementary Reading” section). The mindfulness techniques 
discussed in Chapter 3 can help you develop an ability to stay present in the moment.
You may get caught in a constant loop of negative worried thoughts that can interfere 
with problem solving. Sometimes this can take the form of endless “Why?” questions that 
have no real answers (see the “Why Me?” section on p. 107). Distraction, physical exer-
cise, and mindfulness meditation may assist you in stepping out of such repetitive worry 
that is self-­defeating, scary, and gets you nowhere.
Monitoring Self-Talk
An Exercise Format
Because self-talk is so automatic, you need to catch it as it happens. In Appendix F there 
is a “Daily Record of Self-Talk (Automatic Thoughts)” worksheet that you can copy and 

106	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
carry with you (it is also available for downloading at www.guilford.com/managepain). 
If you are an Apple or Android device user, you can download one of several cognitive-­
behavioral therapy apps that help you do the same thing. Look for thought diary forms 
or automatic thought records (see Appendix E). Now, each time you find yourself feeling 
sad, frustrated, or anxious, record your automatic thoughts and other responses. Track-
ing these thoughts will help you see what you’ve been saying to yourself and how this 
self-talk makes you feel. With this knowledge you can begin to act, rather than react, in 
response to events occurring around you. Again, don’t judge the “goodness” or “bad-
ness” of negative thinking; that’s not the point. The point is that thinking negatively for 
long periods is simply not helpful for problem solving, and it makes you feel terrible.
So, how should you record your self-talk? Here is an example:
Imagine that you wake up with increased pain on a day you had planned to visit a friend. 
(Situation)
What do you find yourself thinking? (Automatic thoughts) 	
How do you feel physically? (Physical response) 	
How do you feel emotionally? (Emotional response) 	
Do your thoughts match any of the cognitive distortions or irrational beliefs listed on the 
previous pages? (Cognitive distortions) 	
What is really going on and what action can you take? (Changed thought, to be discussed 
later.) 	
I encourage you to take the “Daily Record of Self-Talk” (in paper or app form) with 
you at all times because you can’t always count on memory. Emotions and thoughts fade 
as time passes. Even in the moment, you may be aware only of physical symptoms, such 
as muscle tension or palpitations, or just the emotion, such as panic or fear, but not the 
thoughts. Write down as much as you can about the situation, your physical sensations, 
and emotion. Doing this can help you recapture your thoughts. Slowly, with time and 
practice, you will be able to change negative responses as they occur. Remember, too, 
that you can use this exercise to explore your emotions and thoughts about anything, not 
just your pain.
Working with Anger
Anger is a powerful emotion and there are important reasons to understand it and bring 
it under your control. It has potential health risks (heart disease, substance abuse) and it 
can lead to violent actions (road rage, sexual and physical abuse). Many people get angry 
in reaction to frustration or hurt. When someone or something has hurt you, a major 
adrenaline rush is set off that can be difficult to control. The reaction triggered may be 
“fight,” not “flight.” Much of the work with self-talk is about changing the way you 

	
The Power of the Mind	
107
respond to events. But being angry can make such changes difficult. Angry people often 
blame others. That attitude can be a problem if you can’t acknowledge the harm done 
while accepting the need to move on with healing.
For many people, giving up their anger feels as though they are giving in to guilt for a 
pain problem that may clearly not be their fault. Assigning responsibility for an injury—
the driver who ran the red light and hit my car, for example—can bring about legal reso-
lution of wrongdoing. However, holding on to the anger about the wrongdoing makes 
you feel more victimized, depressed, and anxious. There are specific exercises that can 
help you control your anger, and you’ve already started doing many of them, including 
relaxation techniques. These exercises help you buy time between an event and your emo-
tional response to it. Physical exercise helps check the stress effects of anger. The thinking 
skills that we’ve started to address in this chapter also help, as do journaling and the com-
munication skills described later. Anger is discussed more fully in the next chapter. Other 
resources for anger management can be found in the “Supplementary Reading” section.
“Why Me?”
Sometimes you may think, “Why did this happen to me? Why me? Why? Why?” These 
questions can be overwhelming. You may think that you should be able to answer them 
or that someone should. They give you the illusion that you are exploring and trying to 
solve problems. In fact, it’s impossible to answer such questions. They keep you dwell-
ing in the past, which you cannot change. However, you can change how you respond to 
these questions by focusing on the present and taking an inventory of the beliefs that lie 
behind “Why?” questions.
For example, do you believe that there is a reason for everything? Or that life should 
be fair? Do you have a secret fear that anyone who feels this horrible must have done 
something pretty bad? If you were told that your pain would end in exactly 6 years and 
2 months, would you be able to live comfortably now? Are these your beliefs? Do you 
have others? Compare them with the irrational beliefs and cognitive distortions described 
earlier. Which ones match your assumptions about the way life should be?
Don’t confuse these “Why?” questions with the search for meaning in life. Meaning 
won’t be found in an endless litany of “Why?” In the end, such questions are dead ends. 
Exploring their presence and their roots can lead to greater flexibility in meeting the chal-
lenges of living with pain.
Expressive Writing
Expressive writing or journaling is a technique of writing about stressful or traumatic 
events. It can help you identify automatic self-talk, and it can also do more than that. 
Research supports the powerful healing effects of putting words down on paper. James 
Pennebaker and John Evans describe the research in their book Expressive Writing: 
Words That Heal (see the “Supplementary Reading” section). Other studies also show 
that writing about your stresses and traumas can be therapeutic. As people continue to 

108	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
write, they can make sense of what has happened to them. This is also called “narrative 
repair.” Bringing meaning to the pain experience can be an important step in healing 
and in decreasing long-term disability. This kind of writing is not a form of complaining 
or a substitute for acting on a problem. It can allow you to identify a starting point for 
addressing frustrations, a beginning to problem solving. Writing that is self-­reflective (not 
self-­absorbed or devoid of feelings) will be the most therapeutic.
Quick Skill
Take a moment before you go to bed to write about the things that were challeng-
ing, disappointing, or frustrating for you that day. Then record anything that gave 
you some comfort, solace, or satisfaction. Try to have a few in each category. You may 
keep these reflections in a notebook or discard them each night because either way, 
tomorrow is a new day, with new possibilities.
Changing Your Thoughts
The greatest revolution of our time is the knowledge that human 
beings, by changing the inner attitudes of their minds, can transform 
the outer aspects of their lives.
—William James
You can begin changing your self-talk by using one or more of the following tech-
niques. The first three are used to identify the thinking behind the emotions and physical 
responses that occur in our daily lives. These tools, used in cognitive-­behavioral therapy, 
have proven to be helpful in addressing negative emotions (such as depression and anxi-
ety) by identifying negative thoughts so you can actively change them. The fourth tech-
nique is a newer approach. It combines mindfulness meditation practice with cognitive 
therapy. In this method, all thoughts are observed nonjudgmentally, as mental events; this 
is the only reality they truly have. The contents of a thought may or may not be an accu-
rate reflection of reality. Over time, with practice, your relationship to negative thoughts 
changes so that you do not mindlessly react to the thought content as if it were reality.
Technique 1: Challenging Self-Talk
In this technique, you challenge the accuracy of your self-talk. First, capture your nega-
tive, automatic thoughts. You can use the “Daily Record of Self-Talk” worksheet men-
tioned earlier. Next, examine the captured thoughts for distortions, irrational beliefs, and 
self-­defeating attitudes. With this groundwork in place, you can then challenge the accu-
racy of the thoughts. Often, after you challenge the thoughts, your emotional response 
will shift or disappear.

	
The Power of the Mind	
109
For example, is it true that if you have chronic pain, you’re defective and imperfect? 
By now, I would hope that you can respond with a loud “No!” What is true is this: You 
have a chronic problem that changes the way you do things. The statement “I’m defec-
tive” is a gross exaggeration. It’s “labeling”—number 5 in the list of thinking errors. Rec-
ognizing this, you may now be able to tell yourself: “Being in pain may mean I can do less 
than before, but it does not reflect on my character” or “I can still accomplish things by 
pacing my activities; I show the courage to rise above my disability.” How does that feel?
Be careful about one thing. Don’t replace inaccurate negative thoughts with inac-
curate positive ones. For example, when you wake up in pain, don’t replace “My whole 
day is ruined” with “This is a wonderful experience.” You will know when you hit on the 
right statement because you will feel better, relieved, less anxious, or less sad.
Using Technique 1, how might you change your self-talk on waking up with increased 
pain on a day you had made plans to visit a friend? Write your new self-talk here.
	
	
	
Technique 2: Clarifying the Problem and What You Can Do
Here is a second way to change your self-talk. It helps you clarify the real problem and 
see where you have some control even in a seemingly impossible situation. Here are the 
five steps, with an example:
State the problem: 
 I awake in more pain.	
State why it’s a problem:
 Because I had plans to visit a friend today.	
Identify:
What can you do?
 I will see how I feel after taking a hot shower, doing my 	
 relaxation technique, and taking two ibuprofen.	
What do you need and 
what are your options?
 I need to take care of myself and be realistic given these	
 developments. I can ask that my friend come here,	
 or that we meet somewhere closer. Or I can visit her	
 another time. This happens. It is usually self-­limited. 	
How do you feel?
 Sad, but in control.	
Technique 3: The Vertical Arrow or “So What?” Technique
Sometimes your discouraging self-talk may seem so accurate that you have trouble see-
ing where the thinking error is. In these situations, try the vertical arrow technique, 

110	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
described by David Burns (see the “Supplementary Reading” section). You begin by buy-
ing into the negative thought and challenging it by asking questions, “If what I’m saying 
is accurate, why does it trouble me?” or “So what?” Or ask yourself, “If it’s true, what’s 
the worst that could happen?” You then write down your answer and draw an arrow 
pointing down from what you have written.
Next, you ask yourself the same questions, but this time about the answer you just 
wrote. Under the arrow, you write down another answer, then draw another arrow. Ask 
yourself the questions again. You continue until you have gone as far as you can. This 
technique should uncover all the thinking errors, cognitive distortions, irrational beliefs, 
fears, and assumptions hidden beneath the original thought. Here is an example:
You wake up in pain and think, “I’m so useless.” First you ask yourself, “If what I’m 
saying is accurate, why does it trouble me?” “So what?” or “If it’s true, what’s the 
worst that could happen?”
	
↓
You write, “I can never do anything anybody wants me to do.” Ask yourself again, 
“If what I’m saying is accurate, why does it trouble me?” “So what?” or “If it’s true, 
what’s the worst that could happen?”
	
↓
“Now my friend will hate me because I’m unreliable.” Ask yourself, “So what?”
	
↓
“Soon I’ll have no friends.” Ask yourself, “So what?”
	
↓
“I’ll be all alone.” Ask yourself, “So what?”
	
↓
“Being alone is the worst thing that can happen to me.”
And so on. In the example above, the underlying fear of being alone can make any 
situation that isolates you the source of depression and panic. Once you know where the 
panic is coming from, you can take steps to cope with the feelings of loneliness.
Two more resources that may assist you in assessing problematic thinking patterns 
are the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale.
David Burns presents the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale in Chapter 10 of his book 
Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. Completing it may help you identify the trou-
bling values and vulnerabilities that underlie your negative emotions, often unknowingly. 
These distortions make you vulnerable to daily stresses.
A second useful questionnaire, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, can be accessed 
online (http://sullivan-­painresearch.mcgill.ca/pdf/pcs/PCSManual_English.pdf, p. 35). 

	
The Power of the Mind	
111
In the “Exploration Tasks” at the end of the chapter, I explain how you might use the 
information from completing this questionnaire to assist you in addressing a moderate to 
high level of catastrophizing.
Challenging these thoughts is part of getting to drive your own yellow school bus—
or, to borrow another metaphor, getting rid of those old sound loops and making your 
own new ones.
Technique 4: Changing Your Relationship to Negative Thoughts
This technique comes from mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), which com-
bines cognitive therapy with mindfulness meditation practices. It has scientific evidence 
to support significant improvements in depression and anxiety and preventing relapse in 
these disorders. It has also been shown to be helpful in reducing the ruminating, worrying 
thoughts in those who tend to catastrophize.
In MBCT, the content of negative thoughts is not challenged; instead people learn to 
relate differently to negative thoughts. Thoughts can have a tight hold on our attention 
when we believe they are true and real. However, thoughts are only mental events and 
their content may or may not correspond to reality. Thinking about eating an apple is 
not the same as eating an apple. Thinking “I’m useless” is not the same as actually being 
useless. The core skill in MBCT is learning how to step out of automatic negative thought 
patterns and relate to them with curiosity and kindness as passing events in the mind. 
Through practice of mindfulness meditation (like Technique 2 in Chapter 3), you become 
aware of the constant parade of thoughts going through your mind—­positive, negative, 
neutral—and learn to observe them as if from a distance without getting caught up in 
their contents. When you become caught up in the content of a thought, you are usually 
lost in an often painful past experience or speculating about a possibly painful future 
one. But when you practice being in the present moment, thoughts lose their power to 
beat you down, and life’s challenges, including pain, are much less stressful. This mind-
fulness-based approach takes time and repeated practice. For those interested, The Mind-
ful Way Workbook is a self-help book based on MBCT by its developers, John Teasdale, 
Mark Williams, and Zindel Segal. This is a relatively new therapy that should grow as 
more therapists are trained. Enter MBCT and your city into your computer search engine 
if you wish to identify local therapists.
Changing Self-Talk Practice
The techniques I’ve been describing will not make you stress-free. However, they can 
help you control your responses to life’s minor and major hassles. You will feel differ-
ently when you can describe what is going on and determine your options. David Burns’s 
books are recommended for further work in cognitive-­behavioral therapy (see “Supple-
mentary Reading”). You can further explore mindfulness practices through the work of 
Jon Kabat-Zinn, John Teasdale, Mark Williams, and Zindel Segal (see “Supplementary 
Reading”).

112	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Try out the techniques presented here to see which one(s) you find more comfortable 
or the most helpful. Be careful not to expect change all at once. Changing how you feel 
by changing what you say to yourself or by mindfulness practice may seem unusual or 
odd to you at first. Most everyone needs practice to become skilled at these techniques. In 
the beginning, you may be able to identify your thoughts only after the fact. Eventually, 
you will be able to start observing them as soon as you start hearing your inner chatter. 
You will know when you have captured the thoughts that created your negative emotions, 
because reading back the thoughts you have written will re-­create the emotions. Beware 
of the “Why me?” questions. Go beyond them to the assumptions or expectations that 
underlie such questions. You will know when you’ve hit upon an adequate way to change 
a thought, because you will feel better and more in control.
Now let’s take a look at what happened to Joan (see the quote at the beginning of 
the chapter). By the end of the program, her thinking had undergone a transforma-
tion. The following is the beginning of a poem she wrote, based on a dream she had 
during the program:
A friend showed me a grey cement urn, the size of a well. It opened slightly.
Inside were limbs, arms and legs floating in a thin, dark liquid.
A man dove to the bottom and brought my body to the surface. It was not dead, only half 
dead—kept alive somehow by a mask and snorkel.
I was afraid to look at it, but I did—
When I saw that it was me, I turned to my friend and husband and said with utter joy: “I’m 
so glad to be living.”
I watched the man lift my body from the urn and begin to walk with it. My body slowly 
began to come to life.
The man led my body onto a boat where a crowd was gathered to watch. The two walked 
through the middle of the crowd of people.
As they did so, my body was transformed. It became filled with light and covered by white 
flowing garments. The head became covered with long, golden hair.
At the bow of the boat, my body sailed off into the sky and the crowd of people cheered.
I thought to myself as I watched: “I am beautiful.”
Psychological Labels in Chronic Pain
There has been a great deal of debate in medicine about whether or not chronic pain is 
simply a physical sign of psychological trauma, depression, or what used to be called 
“hysteria.” Many physicians have believed (and still believe) that chronic pain is a psycho-
logical or psychosomatic issue. These psychological theories of physical pain gained pop-
ularity in part because of medicine’s separation of mind and body. In addition, ignorance 

	
The Power of the Mind	
113
about the causes of chronic pain have contributed to the idea that what can’t be objec-
tively seen or measured must be “psychological.”
The majority of doctors will emphasize either the body or the mind in their recom-
mendations in part because there is now so much to know in each domain. A body doc-
tor rarely explores the emotional or psychological signs of living in pain, and a mind 
doctor rarely examines a patient physically. Yet, when I listen to people with chronic 
pain describe their physical, emotional, and social limitations, like we did earlier in the 
workbook, it is very clear that mind and body are intimately involved in the experience 
of chronic pain. It is important to diagnose psychological disorders so that appropriate 
treatment can be prescribed; however, there may still be too much psychological labeling 
of chronic pain patients who do not get better. This labeling only increases everyone’s 
frustration and devalues the persons’ experience; it does not clarify how best to treat 
them. Let’s explore some of the psychological labels that have been used with patients 
experiencing chronic pain.
Depression
In the absence of pain, feeling sad or worthless and having trouble sleeping or eating 
may be symptoms of depression. But in a person experiencing pain, these common symp-
toms can be a sign of the struggle to live with the pain, which can be quite disruptive. 
Depressed patients complain of bodily aches and pains, but their pain complaints usually 
go away when the depression is successfully treated. In chronic pain, the sensation doesn’t 
go away with the treatment of the depression, although the pain experience may improve.
The treatment of a person with chronic pain may include antidepressants, but they 
should be part of a comprehensive treatment plan.
Hysteria
Many women patients with chronic pain are incorrectly labeled as “hysterical,” simply 
because they are female and complain about unexplained pain. “Hysteria” is a term 
with historical interest. In medical writings as recently as the 20th century, the womb 
(in Greek, hystera) was considered to be the source of many female problems. It sup-
posedly made women prone to moodiness, fickleness, irritability, and multiple physical 
complaints. These “abnormal,” “hysterical” behaviors contrasted with the calm, steady, 
rational behavior of the “normal” (that is, male) population.
Use of the term “hysterical” to describe a frightened female (or male) patient with 
chronic pain does not appear to be appropriate or accurate, even if the response seems 
extreme. The fact that X-ray or laboratory findings cannot identify the cause of chronic 
pain does not justify the assumption that the cause is purely psychological. We would do 
better to observe that pain behaviors are signs of suffering that occur in a woman or man 
with chronic pain. We also need to realize that “appropriate behaviors” are culturally and 
socially determined and as such are subject to interpretation and bias.

114	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Hypochondriasis
Some people are intensely preoccupied with and worried about their health. They are 
sensitive to the physical sensations of normal body functioning and may become alarmed 
by things like their own normal heartbeat. They are rarely reassured by their doctors’ 
examinations or tests. Such people are commonly called “hypochondriacs.”
It is easy to see how the label of “hypochondriac” might be misapplied to chronic 
pain patients. For example, in fibromyalgia (see Appendix A), the pain is ill-­defined, dif-
fuse, intermittent, and migratory; there is no specific laboratory test that can confirm 
the diagnosis. In such cases, it is essential that a careful history and examination be 
performed. The pattern of symptoms, the presence of tender points, and the absence of 
positive results for rheumatoid arthritis or lupus on laboratory tests can help make the 
diagnosis of fibromyalgia. In addition, the willingness of patients with fibromyalgia to be 
active participants in their pain management, working in partnership with their health 
care providers, demonstrates a healthy coping response.
Malingering
“Malingerers” are people who only pretend to be ill to gain something (like insurance 
money) or avoid something (like working). Insurers and physicians persist in expressing 
doubt about chronic pain sufferers. These doubts are due in part to the lack of objective 
measures of chronic pain and a reluctance to believe what can’t be measured or explained 
easily. The need to rely on the truth of a person’s pain complaint can generate distrust and 
frustration between health care providers and patients. This state of affairs is not helped 
by the litigious “Who’s to blame?” atmosphere in which medicine is currently practiced. 
It’s hard enough for physicians and other care providers to make accurate diagnoses 
and treat symptoms, without also wondering whether the symptoms being reported are 
“real.” Further misunderstanding is created when physicians perceive that a patient has 
somehow failed at or sabotaged “usually successful” therapy and when patients perceive 
that the physician has failed to deliver pain relief.
A patient’s search for the meaning of the pain can lead him or her to focus on finding 
someone to blame, particularly when pain occurs after an accident. Although the pros-
pect of being compensated through a legal action or workers’ compensation may influ-
ence the experience of pain and its disabling consequences, it does not appear to create 
the pain in the majority of individuals. As I discuss in Chapter 6, many a compensation 
scenario is associated with anger and frustration, which can interfere with healing and 
worsen the pain experience. When the legal system, workers’ compensation, or a disabil-
ity insurer becomes involved in an individual’s case, there is often a lengthening of the 
normal grieving process and a delay in coming to acceptance of the chronic pain condi-
tion. This delay is not malingering.
If a health care provider and a patient in pain are to have a successful therapeutic 
relationship, blame and distrust must be put aside. Chronic pain is not a failure on either 

	
The Power of the Mind	
115
the patient’s or the physician’s part. Chronic pain is real, not imaginary or invented. For 
many patients, it’s not a curable problem, but the symptoms can be reduced.
In short, patients are responsible for clearly and accurately reporting their pain expe-
rience, physicians are responsible for thorough evaluation and treatment, and external 
systems need to provide compensation in a timely and just manner.
Posttraumatic Stress
Considerable attention is currently being given to posttraumatic stress (PTS). Some 
theorists believe that certain types of chronic pain (for example, headaches, abdominal 
pain, and pelvic pain) are really the psychological signs of sexual or physical abuse that 
occurred years before. Indeed there is an increased reporting of pain in people with PTS 
and a higher than normal presence of trauma history in people with chronic pain.
One explanation is that the hypervigilance associated with these traumas may sen-
sitize the nervous system, in genetically susceptible individuals, in a way that increases 
pain sensitivity or decreases the ability to dampen pain sensation. Another explanation is 
that having chronic pain feels like being abused again. Both patients in pain and people 
with PTS feel anxiety, vulnerability, a lack of control, and they may not be believed. The 
PTS may not cause the pain in these circumstances, but it may compound the experience 
of physical pain because of the similar qualities of these two emotion-laden experiences. 
The psychological distress of PTS needs to be treated, and so does the physical pain. The 
desire to reduce the emotional pain of trauma as well as the physical pain makes the 
use of opioids a particular challenge. It is extremely important in these situations that 
patients receive a comprehensive approach to treatment that addresses mind, body, and 
spirit.
Before multiple surgical or medical procedures are performed, it is important to 
explore whether PTS is also present. For example, in persistent pelvic pain, the pain may 
not reach a level where surgery is considered if the coexisting factor of PTS is treated as 
well. The relationship between PTS and pain is an important connection to be explored, 
because the healing must take place at multiple levels—in the memories of the mind and 
the body.
Summary
• Pain “beliefs” are assumptions about reality that shape how you interpret the pain 
experience and give it meaning.
• Catastrophizing, denial, and avoidance are ways of thinking that are associated 
with disability in chronic pain. These thinking patterns may also play a physiologi-
cal role in how pain becomes chronic and persists.
• “Pain catastrophizing” means thinking that the pain is impossible to control and 

116	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
overwhelming, that you are helpless, and that you worry constantly that it will all 
get worse. This way of thinking can contribute to disability from chronic pain.
• Your automatic thoughts—self-talk—can affect the way you feel. If you can change 
your negative self-talk, you can change how you feel.
• Our cultural beliefs and vocabulary influence what and how we perceive the world. 
Gender, as well as culture, influences our interpersonal communication. Our pre-
disposition for short-term planning leaves us vulnerable to long-term consequences.
• Albert Ellis developed rational–­emotive behavior therapy to challenge irrational 
beliefs and replace them with more realistic ones.
• There are at least 12 types of thinking errors that can lead to negative emotions.
• Monitor your self-talk and your physical and emotional responses to stressful situ-
ations. This self-­monitoring helps you evaluate your responses and begin to change 
them. Carefully examine anger and look for the assumptions behind “Why?” ques-
tions.
• Changing thoughts associated with negative emotional states, or changing how 
you relate to thoughts, allows you to identify your options and gain greater control 
over your responses to life’s difficulties. Four techniques are presented:
 Challenging the accuracy of your self-talk;
 Clarifying the problem and developing an action plan;
 The vertical arrow (“So what?”) technique for those more difficult-to-reach 
agendas; and
 Mindfulness meditation in which thoughts are viewed as passing mental events.
• A comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment addresses both physical pain 
and psychological distress (anxiety, depression, and PTS).
Exploration Tasks
1.	 Using the “Daily Record of Self-Talk” provided in Appendix F, keep track of what you are 
thinking whenever you experience a negative emotional state (sadness, anxiety, fear, or 
jealousy) or whenever you are feeling increased physical tension or pain. (You have auto-
matic thoughts with positive emotional states, too, but clearly you don’t need to work 
on changing those emotional states.) Copy (or download from www.guilford.com/man-
agepain) the “Daily Record of Self-Talk” and carry it with you, or download one of the 
thought diary apps now available (see Appendix E). The following Sample Daily Record 
of Self-Talk shows how to fill it out. Follow these instructions:
• First identify and record the event or situation associated with the negative emotion 
(sad, self-­defeated, anxious). For example: Pain flare-up.
• Write down your thoughts. For example: “I can’t take this. I can’t do anything.”

 
The Power of the Mind 
117
• Write down the physical symptoms you experience at these stressful times: “Muscle 
tension, heartburn.”
• Write down the emotional response: “frustrated, scared.”
• Write down the distortion, the belief behind the thoughts: “This always happens 
when I want to do something fun [overgeneralization]. My whole day is ruined [all-or- 
nothing thinking]. It’s beyond my control and there is nothing I can do to help myself 
[catastrophic thinking].”
• Using one of the four techniques, see if you can identify unrealistic thoughts and 
distortions. Come up with more realistic, action- oriented thoughts and phrases: “The 
reality is that it doesn’t happen every time I want to have fun. I don’t have to like it. I 
have many things I can do to manage my pain fl are-up.”
2. Certain techniques can help you identify, capture, and change your self-talk.
A. The regular practice of focused relaxation techniques (see Chapter 3) encourages self- 
observation, particularly the mindfulness meditation in Technique 2. If you have not 
been practicing a daily relaxation or mindfulness technique, you may have more trou-
ble capturing these quick thoughts. Consider increasing your commitment to daily 
practice.
B. Expressive writing or journaling can help you identify automatic thoughts that you 
may have had trouble observing, identifying, or admitting. The most common prob-
lem when people begin to monitor their self-talk is that they do not go beyond 
describing their mood. They do not explore the thoughts that are responsible for the 
mood. They go immediately to problem solving. Although problem solving is where 
we want to go with many of these exercises, you may not be ready yet. You fi rst need

to see what drives these negative emotions. That means identifying the thoughts 
that make you sad, angry, or anxious and the beliefs that drive them—fear of losing 
control, of not being loved, of being used by others, and so forth. Journaling is a way 
of taking the time to capture the thoughts, all of them, and exploring the assump-
tions behind them.
Usually people find that they have a few common distortions that run through 
most of their self-talk. Taking the time to reflect on these common scenarios will allow 
you to gain more mastery over them. Write about a stressful event for 10–20 minutes, 
letting whatever comes up flow out onto the paper (or if this is difficult because of 
your particular site of pain, use a recording device). You do not have to share this writ-
ing (or recording) with anyone. See what comes up. What are the familiar themes? 
Phrases? Do not be surprised if you feel the emotion more intensely. You are getting 
to the roots of your despair. Only after you get it all out on paper can you start to work 
on changing the self-­statements, challenging the reality of what you have said, and 
identifying the distortions. If anger is a dominant theme, try the next exercise.
3.	 Anger, as I pointed out before, is a challenge. There are many reasons people become 
angry; this exercise deals with only a few of them. People injured by someone else in an 
accident or at work often feel angry at the other person. They may feel vulnerable and 
uncertain about whether they can ever feel safe again. This can be quite distressing. 
Being a victim feels awful. But why? Can you capture or identify why you feel angry? 
(Substituting the word “hurt” or “frustrated” for “angry” may make this easier for some 
people.) For example: “I feel angry (hurt, frustrated) because that person was careless

4.	 When you find yourself reacting to your pain or life events in a negative way with frustra-
tion, feelings of defeat, giving up, giving in . . .
A.	 STOP, TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
B.	 Ask yourself, “What is going on here? Are these my old sound loops or assumptions 
playing out here?”
C.	 “Where do I have control here? What can I do? Is ‘doing something’ even required at 
this point?”
5.	 If you are interested in assessing your level of catastrophic thinking, psychologist Michael 
Sullivan has provided his Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) online at http://sullivan-­
painresearch.mcgill.ca/pdf/pcs/PCSManual_English.pdf. The scale itself is on page 35 of 
the online pdf. There are 13 questions. Adding your responses together gives you a total 
score. Research on the PCS has shown that total scores greater than 30 are associated with 

120	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
a higher risk of pain-­related distress and disability. Those with PCS scores between 20 and 
30 are considered at moderate risk of developing pain-­related distress and disability.
There are three components of catastrophizing: rumination, magnification, and 
helplessness. These are measured by the subscale scores and tell you how much these 
components contribute to the total pain catastrophizing score. The subscales of rumi-
nation, magnification, and helplessness are described in the online manual on page 6. 
“Rumination” is the constant repetition of negative, self-­defeating thoughts that inter-
fere with problem solving. Add together your responses for each subscale score. Physical 
exercise may reduce the paralyzing effects of persistent negative worrying, and cognitive 
therapy may assist in redirecting repetitive self-talk that is self-­defeating, scary, and get-
ting you nowhere.
“Magnification” is the self-talk that makes pain bigger than life and so overwhelm-
ing that there does not appear to be any way to control it. Cognitive therapy and mind-
fulness meditation can assist with understanding the truth or benefit of such thinking 
and provide a more nurturing way to cope with the distress.
“Helplessness” is the belief that you have no control over what happens to you or 
that you see no way out of your situation until the pain is totally gone. Making the dis-
tinction between where you do have control (like your response to the pain) and where 
you do not have control (like over the weather or the disease that causes your pain) can 
give you guidance on where to put your energy and efforts to feel better. Skills that 
increase self-­efficacy may prove very beneficial for this reason.
Remember, we develop our coping styles early in life and in those past situations 
catastrophizing may have served an important function in recruiting others to assist you 
in difficult times. But as an adult with chronic pain, catastrophizing has enough negative 
health consequences to make it of real value to you to consider changing this thinking 
pattern. If you struggle with these feelings and thoughts, then working with someone 
individually who does cognitive therapy, MBCT, or functional restoration may help you 
overcome this troubling pattern of negative self-talk and the resultant feelings of help-
lessness.
6.	 Write out a goal that you want to accomplish related to this chapter. As always, make 
sure your goal is a behavioral task that you can measure in terms of the steps you will 
take to accomplish it. Here is an example:
Goal:   Keep track of my automatic thoughts when I become aware that I am sad 	
 or anxious.	
Steps to take to reach that goal:
A.	  Copy the Daily Record of Self-Talk at the back of the book and carry it in my 	
	
 pocket.	
B.	  If I can’t capture the automatic thoughts, I’ll use the writing exercise to write 	
	
 about each incident and see what comes up.

Adopting Healthy Attitudes
There was once an old farmer who had a mare. One day the mare 
broke through a fence and ran away. “Now you have no horse to pull 
your plow at planting time,” the neighbors said. “What bad luck this 
is.”
“Good luck, bad luck,” replied the farmer. “Who knows?”
The next week the mare returned, bringing with her two wild 
stallions. “With three horses you are now a rich man,” the neighbors 
said. “What good fortune this is.”
“Good fortune, bad fortune,” replied the farmer. “Who 
knows?”
That afternoon the farmer’s only son tried to tame one of the 
stallions, but he was thrown and broke a leg. “Now you have no one 
to help you with planting,” the neighbors said. “What bad luck this 
is.”
“Good luck, bad luck,” replied the farmer. “Who knows?”
The next day the emperor’s soldiers rode into town and con-
scripted the oldest son of every family, but the farmer’s son was left 
behind because of his broken leg. “Your son is the only eldest in the 
province who has not been taken from his family,” the neighbors 
said. “What good fortune this is. . . . ”
—A Zen story about an old Chinese farmer (retold in The Wellness 
Book, p. 460; see Chapter 2, “Supplementary Reading”)
This Zen story illustrates a flexible attitude. In essence, it demonstrates that whatever 
people’s interpretations of events may be, there is always considerable uncertainty in 
life. Some may see this uncertainty as the randomness of life or our inability to know 
the future. Developing ease with uncertainty is a way of adapting to life’s daily stresses 
and surprises. For people who now find themselves living in pain, this adaptability can 
be crucial for coping. Medical and scientific research (see Seligman; Weinert; Nelson et 
al.; and Chida and Steptoe in “Supplementary Reading”) has found that there are numer-
ous health benefits for those who can shed rigid, destructive lifestyles, behaviors, and 

	
Adopting Healthy Attitudes	
125
attitudes and adopt more flexible, positive ones. These benefits include decreased risk fac-
tors for heart disease, improved immune system function, and increased ability to adapt 
to illnesses. Indeed, we are only just beginning to understand and appreciate the power 
of adaptability and positive attitudes.
The term “attitude” is used here to mean a psychological characteristic that a person 
usually adopts without thinking about it. An attitude reflects a perspective, viewpoint, or 
position about someone or something. Attitudes are the result of many influences, such as 
culture, family, learning, and perhaps genetics. We all have attitudes; they help us make 
daily decisions without weighing every single one of them. Attitudes can become a prob-
lem when they are negative and inflexible and make it harder for us to adapt to changing 
circumstances.
For example, if your attitude is that nothing you do will make a difference, then you 
may not see the point of behaving in healthier ways. You may say, “If I can’t make my 
pain go away, why bother to stop smoking or lose weight?” To take another example, 
you’re in pain but have the attitude that nobody cares. And so you don’t ask for what you 
want or need; instead you huff and puff around the house, slamming doors and drawers. 
Chances are that you will suffer more, and those around you will remain clueless. When 
you find yourself with attitudes like these, you need to stop and take a look at them.
Learned helplessness, anger, and hostility are common problematic states of minds 
among the chronic pain patients I see. I discuss these particular attitudes next because 
they interfere, to the greatest extent, with effective coping and problem solving. By con-
trast, attitudes such as stress hardiness, optimism, empathy, and altruism can help ease 
the uncertainty of life in general and life with chronic pain in particular.
Problematic Attitudes
Learned Helplessness
If you put a rat in a cage and give the rat an electric shock every time it presses a bar, then 
the rat will soon learn to stop pressing the bar. But if you randomly give a rat electric 
shocks that it cannot control, it will begin to act anxious and hypervigilant. After some 
time, if this rat is put through a maze, it will not be able to learn as it did before. It will 
become withdrawn and may stop eating. If this goes on long enough, it will make no 
effort to help itself even if it’s given a chance and the shocks have stopped. This behav-
ior is called “learned helplessness.” The rat has adopted an attitude that there is noth-
ing it can do to change its unpleasant circumstances. This attitude then affects how it 
approaches things it could control.
Many patients experiencing chronic pain adopt an attitude of learned helplessness. 
They may ask, or even beg, for help but find it difficult to believe that anything they do 
for themselves will help their pain. This attitude is a self-­fulfilling prophecy. It means that 
they stay helpless and that nothing changes. Practicing the skills discussed in this book, 

126	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
and doing the exploration tasks and other exercises, will help you find those places where 
you do have control. You can learn new ways of living with pain.
Anger and Hostility
Anger and Responsibility
Chapter 5 mentions that working with feelings of anger requires a slightly different 
approach than just identifying or changing self-talk. Some people hold on to anger and 
hostility; if this is you, you need to explore why. Anger and hostility often involve blam-
ing someone or something else. The blamed party is held responsible for the angry feel-
ings. The need to hold someone or something responsible for suffering can be very strong. 
Moreover, there are times when anger is both appropriate and justified. It can be a basis 
for constructive action. But simply holding on to anger or hostility can be destructive. 
Many studies show this: For example, it can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease (see 
Chida and Steptoe in “Supplementary Reading”). Blaming others for one’s misery gives 
away the control you could have. The pent-up anger spreads ever wider, causing depres-
sion, anxiety, self-doubt, and more anger.
Some people protest that accepting responsibility for the way they feel is the same as 
giving in or admitting that they have done something wrong; this is not the case. Many 
angry patients fear that if they let go of their anger, there will be nothing left of them. 
The anger has become a self-­sustaining force in their lives. Again, too, depression and 
anxiety often lay under the anger or are even created by it. Staying angry may help these 
patients to avoid facing such feelings. Who suffers by hanging on to such negative emo-
tions? When one patient realized the self-­destructive nature of her anger, she said, “I’ve 
been letting someone else live rent-free in my head!”
As noted in Chapter 5, patients whose pain is the result of injury from an acci-
dent at work or from someone else’s negligence are understandably very angry at times. 
However, many patients involved in workers’ compensation claims, litigation, or the like 
find themselves fighting against a mighty and invisible adversary. Their feelings of being 
wronged and misunderstood, their attempts to find an explanation or compensation for 
the suffering, feed the “me against them” attitude. One of my patients was suing someone 
because she had slipped on the ice in that person’s driveway and injured her back. I asked 
her, “Who would you blame if you slipped on the ice in your own driveway?” She replied 
without a pause, “Me, I guess.”
Coping with anger involves recognizing your own responsibilities, including the 
responsibility to identify your automatic thoughts. For example, you may be thinking 
something like this: “Someone must pay for my suffering. The accident that injured me 
was an unforgivable event, and I will not be comforted until the wrong has been cor-
rected.” Once these thoughts have been divulged, it is necessary to identify where your 
responsibility ends and that of others begins. Forgiveness may be described as coming 
to accept the injustices that you have experienced. It is a difficult and arduous process. 
However, it can help you clarify who’s responsible for what after an injury.

The Fourfold Path of Forgiveness
Desmond Tutu and his daughter Mpho Tutu published a beautifully sensitive and instruc-
tive volume, The Book of Forgiving: The Fourfold Path for Healing Ourselves and Our 
World in 2014. The process arose from the authors’ own experience with some of the 
worst atrocities associated with the apartheid era in South Africa. It is a highly rec-
ommended read for those who have experienced a wrong, violence, abuse, or victim-
ization. The four steps—­Telling the Story, Naming the Hurt, Granting Forgiveness (by 
recognizing shared humanity), and Renewing or Releasing the Relationship—are clearly 
described, with exercises to help you understand and heal. Here is how these steps might 
be applied to those who are angry and in pain.
Step 1: Telling the Story
Our stories of being injured are difficult to repeat at times because of the complex 
feelings that are associated with being hurt, feeling vulnerable and angry, or seeking jus-
tice or revenge. In telling the story an individual can begin to understand the nature of 
the wrongful act and make meaning out of what has happened. Telling your own story 
allows you to get your dignity back. Knowing your story helps build resilience.
Step 2: Naming the Hurt
In Step 2, after you tell your story—the details of the incident and the facts of long-
term recovery—you seek to name the hurt and explore its significance for you. If you are 
aware of your feelings and motivations, you can identify where your responsibilities end 
and those of others begin, thus balancing the scale. Coping is best done from a position 
of self-­awareness.
Let’s suppose one day the car you were driving was hit from behind and you received 
a neck injury. Perhaps the wrongful act committed by the other driver was not leaving 
enough space between cars, or speeding, or not paying attention to slowing traffic, or 
because of texting. You may feel that this was a personal attack against you or the result 
of the person’s stupidity. As you explore the long-term consequences of having chronic 
pain as a result of the accident, you may discover additional feelings such as grief or sad-
ness at the loss of function or joy. Furthermore, if the other person has never apologized, 
you may feel further justified in seeking punishment or revenge for the person’s wrongdo-
ing.
If lawyers become involved, resolution may be delayed until the case comes to court, 
many years later. This may make it difficult to accomplish Step 2—naming the hurt—­
because you may not be able to admit that the painful consequences are long term and 
take the steps necessary to cope. In addition, the possibility of talking to the injurer 
will be limited to depositions. You will be kept from identifying with any of the other 
person’s human weaknesses and recognizing your shared humanity (Step 3). Clearly, 
being wronged is painful; when the effects are physical and long term, there is a wish 

128	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
to be compensated at many levels. This is appropriate, but if the steps of forgiveness are 
arrested at the beginning, there may only be the external resolution (the settlement) with-
out an internal resolution of the distress.
In a situation involving a motor vehicle accident, such as the example given above, it 
is perhaps easier to name the hurt, the physical injury, and describe its source, the other 
driver. Other situations involving injury may not be so clear-cut. If you have experienced 
a work-­related injury, it may be the nature of the job—for example, the repetitive motion 
involved in typing on a keyboard for long periods of time. You may experience consider-
able frustration if you do not recover in the expected amount of time and can no longer 
perform your job. If you feel guilty or blamed for not returning to work, you may become 
angry at your employers for not setting up the computer correctly in the first place or for 
not encouraging you to take frequent stretch breaks.
These feelings are often made worse by the lack of caring shown for a worker’s physi-
cal and emotional needs. Although workers’ compensation was originally designed as a 
sort of no-fault insurance for employers and their employees, this is rarely the case when 
chronic pain conditions occur. Once again, legal involvement may serve to delay resolu-
tion or to assign blame when actually none exists. Assigning blame may be appropriate in 
cases of harm resulting from negligence, accidents, or assault; it may not always be pos-
sible in cases of chronic pain. If you are a person with chronic pain in such circumstances, 
it is important to avoid assigning blame inappropriately (to either yourself or others) and 
to realize that you can move on to the next step.
Writing the Wrongs.  The writing exercise mentioned in the “Exploration Tasks” of 
Chapter 5 has been helpful to people who have trouble identifying the thoughts and rea-
sons behind their hurt or anger. Begin by asking yourself, “Who has hurt me and what 
have they done?” Then list what you gain or lose by staying angry and what you gain or 
lose by giving up your anger. Compare the two sides of your list. What are your conclu-
sions?
Step 3: Granting Forgiveness
Forgiving is a choice. You can choose not to forgive and suffer the consequences of 
bitterness, depression, and anger. By choosing to forgive, you (not others) determine the 
road you travel; you are taking the control back. It may not be easy for you. As humans 
we have weaknesses, vices, and we make mistakes, but we can also be compassionate, 
feel sorrow for our hurtful actions, and try to do better. This recognition of a common 
humanity between the perpetrator and the harmed is a starting point to forgiveness. The 
art of forgiving implies that you are now ready to let go of the negative feelings that have 
imprisoned your mind, spirit, and heart. In so doing, you move toward repairing the 
injury by moving on with the life you have now. Forgiveness can be seen as recognition of 
the common bond of humanity, the link we have to those who surround us.
Forgiving begins from a position of strength. If you continue to feel powerless to cope 
with your pain, then anger may keep you a victim. Accepting the responsibility to live 

	
Adopting Healthy Attitudes	
129
with the pain can empower you. (This is not taking responsibility for causing the pain.) 
But forgiveness is not the endpoint.
Step 4: Renewing or Releasing the Relationship
The next step is renewing or releasing the relationship with the one who has harmed 
you. Renewing a relationship is a creative act; it involves defining a new relationship with 
the person or persons involved. It is not starting again where you left off with the other 
person or ignoring the hurt that has been done. One step in the process is identifying what 
it is you want or need from the other. For many injured in accidents such as described 
above, the justice system may take this out of your hands—but it is an important step.
Releasing the relationship may be necessary if the person who harmed you is no lon-
ger alive, is unknown, or a stranger. Tutu describes this releasing as a “refusing to let an 
experience or a person occupy space in your head or heart any longer” (p. 154).
The four steps described above may not be easy; they may be traveled quickly or take 
months or years. However, they offer a way to become the hero of your adversity, of your 
injustice. If you have been hurt or harmed, engaging in a process that leads to forgiveness 
can bring you peace and resolution.
Healthy Attitudes
The majority of research has focused on negative attitudes and their relationship to ill 
health. However, some researchers have identified attitudes that are associated with posi-
tive attitudes that are associated with health benefits.
Stress Hardiness and Sense of Coherence
In the late 1970s, Suzanne Kobasa of the University of Chicago thought that certain per-
sonality or attitudinal factors might “protect” individuals from adverse stress outcomes. 
She studied “stress-hardy” executives. These were people who viewed life changes as 
challenges rather than as threats; they felt committed to their work, as well as to their 
families and social institutions. They also believed that their response to whatever hap-
pened was within their control. The research found that they experienced fewer physi-
cal and emotional symptoms during a particularly stressful business period than those 
without these qualities. Subsequent research has found stress hardiness associated with 
decreased arousal of the fight–flight or freeze response; higher immune functioning; and 
an optimistic coping style, called “transformational coping,” that transforms stressful 
events into less stressful ones. This work, led by Salvatore Maddi (see “Supplementary 
Reading”), has guided the development of assessment and training tools for hardiness 
and resiliency used by business, industry, and educational institutions.
Another researcher, Aaron Antonovsky, examined positive health attitudes. 
Antonovsky talked with a group of Holocaust survivors in Israel who appeared to have 

130	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
remained in good emotional health in spite of their having experienced terrible trauma. 
From his discussions with these exceptional survivors and others, Antonovsky developed 
his theory of the “sense of coherence.” He proposed that people with a high sense of 
coherence have a pervasive, enduring, yet dynamic feeling of confidence that (1) stressors 
coming from the internal and external environments are structured, predictable, and 
explicable; (2) they themselves have resources available to meet the demands resulting 
from these stressors; and (3) these demands are challenges worthy of investment and 
engagement. Further research summarized by Eriksson and Lindstrom (see “Supplemen-
tary Readings”) has supported the profound effect of this mental orientation.
Optimism
Optimism, too, has been cited as a healthy attitude. Martin Seligman has defined opti-
mism as a way of explaining the causes of what happens to us—that is, our explanatory 
style—which develops in early childhood: “The basis of optimism does not lie in positive 
phrases or images of victory, but in the way you think about causes” (p. 52; see “Sup-
plementary Reading”). Optimists are people who expect things to turn out well; they 
expect to enjoy life. Optimism has been associated with an enhanced immune system. 
Sandra Levy, a psychoneuroimmunologist, has shown that an optimistic explanatory 
style strongly predicts the length of cancer remission (see Karren et al. in “Supplementary 
Reading”).
Seligman has also demonstrated that a pessimistic style is associated with depression 
and general poor health. Pessimists see events that happen to them as stable (“This always 
happens to me”), global (“I never do anything right”), and internal (“It’s all my fault”). 
In contrast, optimists see events as unstable (“Just because it happened once doesn’t mean 
it will again”), specific (“I have trouble with pacing my work activities”), and external 
(“Other people are responsible for their behaviors, I’m responsible for mine”).
Empathy
The word “empathy” can be defined in several ways. Here, I mean a nonjudgmental 
awareness of another’s perspective and the resulting thoughts and experiences. Remem-
ber the excerpt from Joan’s writing exercise at the beginning of Chapter 5? If you were 
able to come to some understanding of what Joan might be experiencing by reading her 
written thoughts, you were feeling empathy. On the other hand, if you found yourself 
making critical or unflattering comments to yourself, then you were judging.
Judgments can be appropriate. But many times we are too quick to judge others. We 
can be wrong, for example, in deciding that a person has no redeeming qualities and lose 
the chance to further understand him or her. We can have a strong tendency to make 
quick judgments when we are feeling out of control.
Suspending judgment may at first seem too open-ended. You may fear it requires an 
eternal state of ambiguity. Actually, it gives you the time necessary to gather information, 
to “walk in the other person’s shoes,” and to experience various viewpoints. It asks you 

	
Adopting Healthy Attitudes	
131
to be patient for others and ultimately for yourself. We base many of our judgments on 
illusions and misinformation; we only think we know what’s going on much of the time. 
It’s okay to relax about the long process necessary for change. Suspend the tendency to 
evaluate your efforts as good or bad, right or wrong. Being nonjudgmental is a core char-
acteristic of mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness practice can help you move beyond 
preconceptions. Explore the wide range of possibilities and choices that lie before you. 
Such flexibility is a key to the positive attitudes that can enhance your health and life.
Altruism
A rabbi had a conversation with the Lord about Heaven and Hell. “I will show you 
Hell,” said the Lord, and led the rabbi into a room in the middle of which was a very big 
round table. The people sitting at it were starving and desperate.
In the middle of the room was an enormous pot of stew, more than enough for 
everyone. The smell of the stew was delicious and made the rabbi’s mouth water. The 
people around the table were holding spoons with very long handles. Each person found 
that it was just possible to reach the pot to take a spoonful of the stew, but because the 
handle of the spoon was longer than anyone’s arm, no one could get the food into his 
mouth.
The rabbi saw that their suffering was indeed terrible. “Now I will show you 
Heaven,” said the Lord, and they went into another room which was exactly the same as 
the first room. There was the same big round table and the same enormous pot of stew. 
The people, as before, were equipped with the same long-­handled spoons. But here they 
were well nourished and plump, laughing, and talking.
At first the rabbi could not understand. “It is simple, but requires a certain skill,” 
said the Lord. “You see, they have learned to feed each other.” (Jewish folk tale)*
We need each other. Nurturing this connectedness can be very difficult when you 
are in pain, because pain can preoccupy you to such an extent that it shuts your eyes to 
the needs of others. Once you have established what kind of activity pacing you require, 
think seriously about joining a support group, volunteering, or getting involved with a 
political passion you may have, so as to help fulfill someone else’s needs.
Quick Skill
Smile, make eye contact, and thank the mailperson, the store clerk, or find something 
about someone to compliment, sincerely. Try it—it’s contagious!
*Retold by Irvin D. Yalom in The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy, Third Edition (New York: 
Basic Books, 1975, pp. 12–13).

MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Building a Foundation for Attitude Change
Assume a virtue, if you have it not. . . .
Refrain tonight,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
For use almost can change the stamp of nature.
—William Shakespeare, Hamlet (Act III, Scene 4)
If you don’t already have healthier attitudes, you can develop them; you can cultivate 
stress hardiness, optimism, empathy, and altruism. Attitudes are not fixed or unchange-
able. It is possible to change the filters through which you see your world.
The following techniques will help you develop healthier attitudes. Affirmations can 
encourage your positive self-talk and nurture your self-­esteem; examining the sources of 
your self-­esteem can help strengthen your courage and fortitude; and humor can ease the 
hard work of change.
Affirmations
You can use affirmations to change your attitudes in a positive way. Affirmations are 
short positive statements, quotes, or reflections that you can repeat to yourself. They 
make you feel inspired, comforted, or supported.
There are many ways of developing and using affirmations. You may find inspiration 
in a book that provides daily reflections (see National Geographic in “Supplementary 
Reading”) or in spiritual books. Or you may select a quote, phrase, or passage that sim-
ply comes to mind during the day’s activities. You may find that an affirmation comes 
to you at the end of an RR or mindfulness technique (see Chapter 3). You may not 
always agree at first with this spontaneous affirmation, but if you repeat it throughout 
the day, you may find that it inspires you to consider a feeling or attitude you wish to  
develop.
For example, you might end your technique with the statement “I am strong.” It 
arises from your unconscious, but your more conscious self says, “Who are you kidding? 
I don’t feel strong at all! I’m the original 120-pound weakling!” As you repeat the affir-
mation “I am strong” periodically for a week, however, you may begin to appreciate that 
you are getting in touch with qualities of strength that are not physical in nature. That is, 
you are developing strength through courage, fortitude, and will. You feel inspired to do 
more with your life as a result. Often, the most useful and relevant affirmations are those 
you generate yourself.
Write out a few affirmations that come to you during the next week while you are 
practicing an RR or mindfulness technique or that you find elsewhere. Post them on the 
refrigerator or on the dashboard of your car so that you can be reminded of them. See 
what happens.

Examining the Sources of Self-­Esteem
Self-­esteem, or the way you feel about yourself, is the result of many factors. The work 
you did in Chapter 5 can give you insights into where your self-­esteem may be vulnerable 
and what negative thinking patterns are triggered by common stressful scenarios. The 
following exercise can help you strengthen your vulnerable areas.
Write 10 things that you like about yourself:
  1.	 	
  2.	 	
  3.	 	
  4.	 	
  5.	 	
  6.	 	
  7.	 	
  8.	 	
  9.	 	
10.	 	
Now, write 10 things that you don’t like about yourself or would like to change:
  1.	 	
  2.	 	
  3.	 	
  4.

Which list was easier to complete?              Why? 	
    	
	
    	
	
  	
	
If you’re like most people, the negative things come more easily to mind. Saying what 
you like about yourself is often labeled as conceited or self-­centered, so you may feel com-
pelled to qualify positive statements with “but” or “not always.” Remember: It’s okay to 
feel satisfied with something you do, feel, or like about yourself.
Look at the list that contains things you like about yourself. Put a checkmark () 
next to those things that are internal characteristics (“patience,” “compassionate,” “good 
listener”). Put an (X) next to those characteristics that are demonstrated in the external 
world (“good worker,” “good friend,” “pretty face”). Is there a balance of ’s and X’s, or 
are you heavy on the X side?
Traits that engage others and the external world are more vulnerable to the judg-
ments of others and to losses (such as loss of job, good health, or personal relations). 
Many people in pain suffer even more when their major source of self-­esteem resides in 
what they do (or did) for a career. It’s important for people to have both internally and 
externally based qualities on which to build their self-­esteem. Such a balance creates a 
firm foundation for engaging with the world.
See whether you can balance your list of positive traits with both external and inter-
nal attributes. Are there any traits on your negative list that you might turn into positive 
traits through goal setting?
Self-­Compassion
Can you imagine being kind and gentle to yourself when you are feeling distraught, 
inadequate, or frustrated by your pain? You might find it easier to give compassion (from 
compati, “suffer with”) to others who are suffering but have difficulty applying the same 
feelings to yourself. Why is it so difficult? The reasons are many and diverse. It may seem 
that giving compassion to yourself seems too wimpy, unmanly, selfish, or undeserved. 
Yet developing self-­compassion may be very helpful in developing resilience and healthier 
coping strategies as well as decreasing negative thoughts and feelings. Research has dem-
onstrated that certain elements developed from the practice of mindfulness meditation 
are associated with the strengthening of self-­compassion (see Birnie et al. in “Supplemen-
tary Reading”). One element is the development of nonjudgmental awareness and the 
other is nonreactivity to the mental events that occur. Whereas empathy may underlie 
the observation and experience of another’s suffering, compassion is thought to foster the 
desire to take action. If you would like to explore more about this concept, see Christo-
pher Germer’s work in “Supplementary Reading.”

	
Adopting Healthy Attitudes	
135
Humor
Just as people with pain tend to lose self-­esteem, they can also lose the ability to see the 
humor or joy in themselves and in the world around them. The preoccupation with self 
and the sadness of losing “normal” abilities can make humor or joy difficult to find. The 
ability to use humor or find joy in life promotes a healthier interaction of mind and body 
that does not require you to be pain-free.
In Chapter 5, you may have found yourself chuckling while identifying your auto-
matic thoughts. You may have wondered, “Now where in the world did I get that idea?!” 
Laughing at your own foolishness and minor weaknesses is healthy, since we all have 
them. It can generate positive attitudes that last long after the laugh, even ensuring flex-
ibility and reminding you not to take everything so seriously. In fact, laughter is thought 
to enhance the production of endorphins (the body’s natural opiates), which can diminish 
pain awareness.
However, some humor, especially wisecracking, can be used to hide underlying nega-
tive attitudes that need to be explored. Good-­natured deliberate giggling, on the other 
hand, is not only desirable, it is necessary. It’s also important to be able to laugh sponta-
neously. Indeed, the way real life challenges our assumptions and expectations is often 
the source of our biggest laughs.
If you are finding it hard to find something to laugh about, watch a funny movie; 
read a favorite book of cartoons; read the writings of Loretta Laroche or other astute 
life observers; buy a joke book; or, if you really get stuck, watch small children at play. 
Somehow, adulthood becomes “a-dolt-hood” for too many of us. Commit yourself now 
to consciously seeking out a giggle, if not an outright guffaw, on at least a weekly basis.
Attitude and Coping Styles
“Coping” is the end result of behavioral and cognitive (thinking) efforts to respond to a 
source of stress, like chronic pain. Coping styles, like thoughts, emotions, and attitudes, 
are not fixed or unchangeable, and many coexist. They can be automatic and ineffective 
if you don’t have a chance to explore them and choose the ones that are effective for the 
problem at hand. In the past three decades there have been numerous studies investi-
gating factors that may contribute to effective coping with chronic pain. Some behav-
iors, beliefs, and attitudes are repeatedly found to be better than others because they 
can reduce suffering and distress. Two categories of coping that have been described are 
termed “assimilative” and “accommodative.” Many people with chronic pain start off 
using an assimilative coping style. They focus on changing the stressor (the pain), while 
resisting any effort to change themselves. When the pain is still new, this approach makes 
sense. People using the assimilative coping style may persistently pursue their life goals in 
spite of the pain, which may cause them to ignore their pain and push harder. They may 
keep searching for a way to get rid of the pain and eventually see dozens of specialists or 

136	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
have multiple surgeries. Over time with repeated failures, however, they may feel increas-
ing despair and depression.
People who are able to shift to or use an accommodative coping style recognize that 
attempts to change the circumstances haven’t worked and are unlikely to work; they are 
able to disengage from unattainable goals and flexibly adjust their aspirations to the cir-
cumstances. In studies of patients with chronic pain, those able to have an accommoda-
tive coping style were less affected by the intensity of pain or pain-­related disability. They 
were able to change their goals and adjust to this new life with pain when eliminating the 
underlying pain problem no longer seemed viable. You may think this flexible adjustment 
is giving in to the pain. It is, in fact, about identifying barriers and going around them so 
that you can get on with your life and get what you need. The ability to adapt to the situ-
ation and assess what the situation requires to succeed requires an active, mindful coping 
approach. The skills you are learning can assist you in being a more adaptive responder 
to the stressors of chronic pain.
Acceptance of the pain does not mean that you must like the pain and it does not 
mean that hope for a cure is not allowed; you can still desire a cure, should it become 
available, but you are living now, not in the future. Accepting the pain simply means 
dropping the fight against its present reality. In the struggle to accept what is happening 
inside you, you may find that the mindfulness practice described in Chapters 3 and 5 is 
very helpful. The ability to experience the pain and not judge the mental events associated 
with it can expand your ability to be at peace and flexible in the moment. Those individu-
als who are unable to make the transition to living with their pain, suffer more. Mindful-
ness meditation may help you develop the needed acceptance and self-­compassion.
Chronic pain involves such a dramatic change in function and quality of life that it 
challenges us to the core. It’s therefore not surprising that a number of things might get 
in the way of an individual adjusting to it. Catastrophic thinking has been identified as 
highly correlated with remaining in the assimilative mode. One characteristic of cata-
strophic thinking that makes it so disruptive is the belief that nothing, in the end, will 
actually work. So the individual is set up for a spiraling, downhill course of frustration, 
depression, and disability.
If you have gotten this far in the workbook, chances are you do not have a highly 
catastrophic way of seeing the world. You may find yourself making such statements as 
“I fear this will never go away,” “This will only get worse,” or “There’s nothing I can 
do,” even as another part of you is beginning to challenge these statements and see that 
they are automatic thoughts—mental events—that can be challenged or left to dissipate. 
Perhaps by now you are beginning to see that your mind can be your biggest ally in cop-
ing with this major life event and the suffering it causes.
Summary
• Changing negative lifestyles, behaviors, and attitudes provides specific health ben-
efits and can greatly improve your ability to cope with chronic pain.

	
Adopting Healthy Attitudes	
137
• An attitude is a psychological characteristic that results from many influences. It is 
generally adopted without any conscious awareness of it.
• Holding on to certain negative attitudes can impair health and prevent flexibility in 
new circumstances. Such attitudes need to be examined consciously.
• Learned helplessness can paralyze you to such an extent that you cannot work on 
healing. Remember that you do have choices and you do have control.
• Anger has a place, but holding on to it is destructive. Forgiveness is one way of cop-
ing effectively with anger; four steps for forgiveness are presented.
• Consider your style of coping with chronic pain. People who use a flexible, accom-
modative style, adjusting goals to their situation, have less pain-­related disability 
and fewer negative emotions.
• Stress-hardy and optimistic people are healthier and cope better with stress.
• Empathy is a nonjudgmental understanding of what someone is feeling; it can help 
you avoid hasty judgments and can increase your perceptions of others.
• Altruism is an important way of staying connected with others.
• Affirmations are short, positive statements, quotes, or reflections that you can 
repeat to yourself for inspiration, comfort, or support.
• Self-­esteem is how you feel about yourself. Most people find it easier to get in touch 
with their negative qualities than with their positive ones; however, remembering 
your positive traits will enhance your self-­esteem.
• Self-­compassion can nurture and heal the pain of suffering and is strengthened by 
mindfulness meditation practice.
• Conscious humor is healthy. It is associated with the production of endorphins and 
generates positive feelings that last long after the laugh.
Exploration Tasks
1.	 Copy or download (from www.guilford.com/managepain) and use the “Daily Record of 
Self-Talk” worksheet in Appendix F to continue recording the self-talk you associate with 
negative emotional states (see Chapter 5). Identify the types of thinking distortions and 
their possible sources through your own explorations. Change the self-talk to reflect the 
reality of the situation, using any one of the three techniques discussed in Chapter 5. As 
you employ the techniques suggested in this chapter, do you find your self-talk becoming 
more positive?
2.	 Continue with your practice of the basic relaxation and mindfulness techniques (1–7)	 on 
a daily basis. As suggested in the text, use positive phrases and statements that come to 
you during your relaxation practice as personal affirmations.
3.	 Identify and write down a goal that you want to accomplish related to the material in 

138	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
this chapter. As always, make sure your goal is a behavioral task that you can measure in 
terms of the steps you will take to accomplish it. Here is an example:
Goal:   To do something that makes me laugh at least once a week.	
Steps to take to reach that goal:
A.	  Read the cartoons in The New Yorker.	
B.	  Rent or download a humorous video.	
C.	  Read the newspaper comics.	
Now it’s your turn.

Nutrition and Pain
Why Discuss Nutrition?
Why include a chapter on nutrition in a pain management book? Well, there are three rea-
sons. First, good eating habits are essential for good health; the program described in this 
book treats the whole person, as well as the pain. Second, some specific foods and eating 
behaviors can affect pain levels (these are discussed in more detail later). Third, there is 
a great deal of misinformation at present about nutritional therapies for pain. This last 
point deserves additional comment.
The United States as a culture is obsessed with diets, body weight, and food; few 
Americans consider eating simply as basic sustenance. Food is everywhere and food rem-
edies, diets, and supplements are eagerly adopted by the public. There has also been a 
growing dissatisfaction with organized medicine, particularly in treating chronic disease. 
Patients are increasingly willing to embrace such “natural,” “holistic” therapies as mega-
dose vitamin therapy, gluten-free and vegan diets, fasting, and internal cleansing. The 
language used to justify the claims for some of these nutritional treatments sounds scien-
tific, but there is rarely evidence other than personal testimonials to support their claims. 
An exception to this would be the gluten-free diet for treatment or symptom control in 
celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes diarrhea and abdominal pain arising 
from changes in the lining of the small intestine.
Studies of nutritional therapies must be designed and evaluated carefully. Here are 
just some of the difficulties encountered in the research. An examination of research 
papers on the process of digestion and absorption of food components makes it apparent 
that the whole process of nutrition is not a simple one. For example, some food compo-
nents are only absorbed when needed by the body, and others are absorbed only if there 
are other essential components available in the same meal. Add to that the complexity of 
asking every single participant in a nutritional study to eat the same thing while meeting 
individual metabolic needs for a long enough time to see changes in symptoms. You can 
see that the task is formidable.

142	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common pain syndrome studied for dietary 
influences. The research has involved three lines of investigation: fish and plant oils, 
vegetarian and fasting diets, and hypersensitivity and food allergies. The strongest evi-
dence supports the benefit of intake of fish oils containing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty 
acids in ameliorating RA, but even these studies are not definitive. Fish oil has not been 
shown to benefit osteoarthritis. Plant oils thought to promote anti-­inflammatory effects 
are flaxseed oil (1 to 3 tablespoons per day), a source of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA); and 
evening primrose and borage oils, sources of gamma-­linoleic acid (GLA), at up to 2,800 
mg per day. WARNING: The amounts needed for these specific fatty acids to be effec-
tive can also interfere with blood clotting. Check with your doctor if you are planning to 
take these supplements and are on anti-­inflammatory drugs or blood-­thinning drugs (for 
example, warfarin [Coumadin®]), or using ginger or turmeric.
The other investigations have produced mixed results regarding dietary effects on 
symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The most that can and should be said at this time 
about special diets is that some people with rheumatoid arthritis appear to benefit from 
eliminating dairy products; reducing saturated fats, which are higher in nonvegetarian 
diets; and eliminating certain foods, such as wheat, corn, peanuts, or eggs, and some food 
additives or seasonings, such as MSG (monosodium glutamate). Elimination diets to test 
food sensitivities are complicated and should be undertaken with the supervision of a 
dietitian or doctor who is experienced in such diets.
In the other chronic pain syndromes, there is no firm evidence that food allergies play 
a role or that improvements can be obtained with extreme dietary supplementation (for 
example, megadoses of vitamins or minerals or extracts of animal hormones and herbs) 
or elimination (for example, yeast-free, vegan, or gluten-free diets). In other words, there 
is simply not enough proof that such treatments work to recommend them. Indeed, there 
is often potential harm with such treatments. The harm can include dietary deficiencies, 
imbalances, and toxicities, as well as enormous financial costs to people. I do endorse 
the careful study of nutritional therapies. I also recommend keeping an open mind to the 
possibility that in the future some patients will be able to help their pain symptoms with 
dietary manipulation.
In the interim, while we’re all awaiting further clarification, you can begin following 
some basic nutritional recommendations now to improve your general health and help 
you in your pain management. These are explored in the following pages.
Two Important Principles
I summarize my basic approach to nutrition in the following two slogans: “Fresh is best” 
and “Moderation.” It may be more difficult than you think to follow these two simple 
recommendations. Prepared, processed, and fast foods are widely available; the frantic 
pace of life leaves little time for meal preparation; and many people in pain are soothed 
by eating.
I say “Fresh is best” because commercially prepared foods are more likely to have added 

	
Nutrition and Pain	
143
salt, sugar, saturated fats, preservatives, and artificial coloring. Vegetables and fruits that 
are frozen immediately after harvest are good options during times when fresh produce is 
not available or is more expensive. Commercially prepared foods require manipulation to 
give them a longer shelf life. These foods also tend to appeal to the average American con-
sumer, who has been eating a diet high in fat and sodium and low in fiber for quite a while. 
However, increased processing may decrease fiber and nutritional content. There is also 
increasing evidence that low-fiber, high-fat, and high-­sodium diets may put individuals at 
risk for developing heart disease, some cancers (colon cancer), high blood pressure, and 
obesity. America is in the midst of an obesity epidemic that has changed the face of chronic 
disease. Obesity can increase the risk of diabetes and degenerative joint disease (osteoar-
thritis), particularly in the lower extremities; this is of particular concern to people already 
experiencing chronic pain, as it can complicate the pain management problem further.
By “moderation” I mean eating that results in a stable weight, appropriate for your 
height and body type. Eat at regular times, from a variety of foods in the six basic food 
groups (discussed below). Eat in quantities that meet the caloric requirements of your 
activities and metabolism. This will help you maintain a stable weight. Skipping meals, 
eating your largest meal in the evening, and snacking on high-fat foods (chips, ice cream, 
cakes, or candy) contribute to weight problems. If not overwhelmed by excess, the body 
appears to have a natural wisdom that enables it to pick and choose what it needs, when 
it needs it, but eating addictions can get in the way of the best intentions. They may even 
be triggered by a diet high in fats and carbohydrates.
Basic Nutritional Guidelines
The typical American diet contributes to increases in obesity, diabetes, heart disease, 
and stroke. Over the past decade, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, and the American Heart Association have 
made recommendations for changing what we eat. The USDA’s “Choose My Plate” web-
site recommends not only what to eat but also in what amounts. If you go to the website 
www.supertracker.usda.gov, you can get a personalized diet recommendation based on 
your age, height, weight, and exercise level. A similar but slightly more detailed approach 
is offered by Harvard’s School of Public Health; its “Healthy Eating Plate” can be found 
at www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource. This website offers nutritional information 
based on the best evidence available. The Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust 
offers good, evidence-based guides for healthy eating from other cultures and for vegetar-
ians. You can find its website at www.oldwayspt.org.
The most recent recommendations from a variety of nutritional resources encour-
age a diet that reduces portion amounts, saturated fats, and cholesterol, and so reduces 
weight. Let’s take a look.
1.	 Portion amounts. In line with the USDA’s “Choose My Plate,” fruits and vegeta-
bles fill one half of a plate, representing the amount you should eat. One quarter of 

144	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
the plate area is the recommended portion of protein such as meat or meat substi-
tute (the size of a deck of cards). The other quarter is filled with whole grains and 
starch portion. Research shows that portion size at restaurants increased between 
1977 and 1996, with the largest increases at fast-food places. The increased por-
tions meant increased calories from foods lower in nutritional value. The website 
www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/wecan/downloads/servingcard7.pdf has a 
serving portion reference card. Print it and laminate it to help you with portion 
control. Join the small-plate movement and learn about the return to a smaller 
plate (10 inches), bowl, glass, and smaller eating utensils to help curb “mindless” 
eating (www.smallplatemovement.org).
2.	Healthy eating. Include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes 
(beans), fish, lean meat, and poultry in your diet. Each day eat a variety of veg-
etables, fruits, and grain products. Make whole grains at least half of the grains 
you consume. Eat lean meats, fish (one to two 6-ounce servings/week), nuts, and 
beans as a source of protein. Use no-fat or low-fat dairy products but check labels 
for additional sugar or other additives that may increase calorie content. The rec-
ommended daily amount of these foods depends on age, sex, and physical activ-
ity. Recommended daily amounts for each food category can be found at www.
choosemyplate.gov/about.html. Eating healthy is more than choosing fruits and 
vegetables when shopping. Fresh produce can be more expensive, and with small 
budgets, it may seem like a luxury. Explore your local resources, such as a farm-
ers’ market, for supplementing fresh produce; buy frozen vegetables and fruits on 
sale; use coupons; shop for sales; and explore www.choosemyplate.gov/­budget 
for creative ways to shop on a budget.
3.	 Weight loss (and maintaining a normal weight). Yes, losing weight is easier said 
than done, and when you have pain it is a special challenge. But here is the scoop 
on weight loss: It’s not a quick fix; it’s a lifestyle change in eating patterns and 
activity. Snapping a photo of your plate with your smartphone before you eat can 
help you document and verify amounts and proportions that may not be as accu-
rate on recall later. Make sure you capture those second servings as well.
There is no one diet that can be specifically recommended for everyone, and there 
are many diets that claim dramatic weight changes. But even a small downward trend in 
weight has benefit if you are overweight or obese. Weight loss helps protect the weight-­
bearing joints from deterioration, but it is also important for general good health. To 
lose weight you must eat fewer calories than you burn. So, you can increase activities to 
burn more calories—­aerobic exercise and strengthening (resistance training) exercises—
or decrease your calorie intake. Usually a combination of both is required to lose weight. 
If you are overweight by body mass index (BMI 25–29.9) or obese (BMI >30.0), you may 
find that seeking professional help is beneficial. To calculate your BMI, use the following 
formula:

	
Nutrition and Pain	
145
Your height in inches        × your height in inches        =        (height squared)
Your weight       /height squared        =       (weight divided by height squared)
Weight divided by height squared        × 703 =        (BMI)
That is, (1) Multiply your height in inches by your height in inches (square your 
height)—for example, 65 inches × 65 inches = 4,225; (2) then divide your weight in 
pounds by the sum from multiplying/squaring your height—for example, 138 lbs / 4,225 
= 0.0327). Take the result from step 2 and multiply it by 703—for example, 0.0327 × 703 
= 22.96, or a BMI of 23. Go to www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/
index.html for more information on BMI and a healthy weight. There are also online cal-
culators for BMI where you can plug in your numbers, but be sure to check whether they 
are talking about pounds or kilograms, inches or centimeters, and choose the measures 
with which you are most comfortable.
Other ways to eat healthily and lose weight include reducing or eliminating sweet soft 
drinks and commercially prepared baked goods, and increasing exercise to 30 minutes a 
day of brisk walking or comparable activity or at least 180 minutes per week of combined 
activity and exercise. Resistance training is a good way to increase metabolism. Use 3- to 
5-pound weights every other day to do up to three sets of 12 repetitions each with five to 
six muscle groups. You may need professional guidance if you have been inactive for a 
while. And if so, start with 1-pound weights and fewer repetitions. If you have any ques-
tions, talk with your physician, physical therapist, or a personal trainer who is familiar 
with chronic pain.
Plan on a gradual weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week. Although this may seem 
slow, it will help keep the weight off in the end. Remember: It’s easier to prevent obesity 
than to lose weight. Follow the recommendations for a healthy diet, activity, and portion 
size before you develop a weight problem.
Basic Food Group Nutrients
The six basic food groups are:
• Grains (whole and refined)
• Vegetables
• Fruits
• Milk, yogurt, and cheese
• Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts
• Oils
They provide us with the following nutrients:

146	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
• Carbohydrates
• Proteins
• Fats
• Vitamins and minerals
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are either simple or complex. Simple carbohydrates are sugars, such as 
table sugar, honey, and syrups. Use simple sugars in small amounts. Sugar has a bad 
reputation in U.S. culture, but the main problem for adults is the company it keeps, such 
as the fat in pastries and ice cream. Eating fresh fruit can satisfy a sweet tooth and is a 
healthier choice.
Complex carbohydrates are made up of repeating chains of sugar molecules. Starch 
is an example of a complex carbohydrate. Vegetables and grains are excellent sources 
of complex carbohydrates, as well as of fiber, vitamins, and iron. The glycemic index is 
a guide to how quickly the digestive system absorbs carbohydrates and how much they 
increase blood sugar compared to pure glucose. Foods with a score of 70 or higher are 
defined as having a high glycemic index; those with a score of 55 or below have a low 
glycemic index. Foods with a high glycemic index, such as sugar-­sweetened beverages, 
cause rapid spikes in blood sugar. Foods with soluble fiber (such as whole grains: cracked 
wheat, oatmeal, brown rice) generally have a low glycemic index. For example, whole 
oats are digested slowly, causing a lower and more gradual change in blood sugar. You 
can search for the glycemic index rating of more than 1,000 carbohydrates by going to 
www.glycemicindex.com, sponsored by the University of Sydney (Australia).
Proteins
Proteins are made up of amino acid units, which are used by the body after being broken 
down in digestion; they are either metabolized for energy or reassembled into new proteins. 
Proteins are the building blocks of enzymes, hormones, and muscle tissue. Meat, poultry, 
fish, dry beans, eggs, tofu (a soybean product), and nuts are good sources of protein. Meat 
as a food source is inherently good, but it has fallen into disrepute because it can contain 
a lot of hormones and antibiotics (given to animals while alive), it is a source of saturated 
fat and cholesterol, and in the past it was associated with diets of little nutritional variety 
(“meat and potatoes”). For a variety of reasons (including religious convictions, the rising 
financial and ecological costs of meat, and growing sensitivity to animal rights), increasing 
numbers of people are choosing to reduce or eliminate their meat intake.
Fats
Fats are made up of substances called “fatty acids” and “glycerol.” The less saturated fatty 
acids are, the healthier they are. From most to least, they can be saturated (for example, 

	
Nutrition and Pain	
147
butter), polyunsaturated (for example, corn oil), or monounsaturated (for example, olive 
oil). Glycerol is the “carrier” that binds fatty acids together. Fats are used for energy and 
are easily stored in the body, and we all know their favorite storage places—the thighs, 
abdomen, and buttocks.
As mentioned earlier, some fatty acids turn into inflammatory products. Known as 
omega-6 linoleic fatty acids, they are commonly found in corn and safflower oil, and 
converted to arachidonic acids that then form “bad” leukotrienes and prostaglandins, 
which can contribute to inflammation. The omega-3 linoleic fatty acids found in fish oils, 
flaxseed, and soybeans contain EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which help form 
the “good” prostaglandins and leukotrienes that reduce inflammation. If your chronic 
pain has an inflammatory component, changing your balance of omega-3 fatty acids and 
omega-6 fatty acids may be helpful.
The best source of fish oils is cold-water fish (sardines, trout, salmon). Capsules of 
fish oil, borage, and evening primrose oil (that contain gamma-­linoleic acid) are avail-
able to supplement the diet. But you have to take large numbers of capsules per day to 
change your fatty acid balance; the expense may be prohibitive. Remember to check with 
your physician if you are on blood thinners and choose to supplement with the omega-3 
oils. As with many dietary recommendations, it may be better to alter what you eat to 
include the foods recommended for healthy eating than to depend on supplements in an 
unhealthy diet.
Cholesterol is not a fat; it is a substance present in some foods, such as eggs, dairy 
products, and animal fats (always animal products). The intake of fat and cholesterol in 
the diet contributes to the body’s production of cholesterol. This is the reason you hear 
the terms “cholesterol” and “fats” together so often. Over time an increase in your cho-
lesterol, particularly your LDL cholesterol, can contribute to heart and blood vessel dis-
ease, especially if you have multiple cardiac risk factors or a parent diagnosed with heart 
disease before the age of 50. If your cardiac risk is high, a statin (lipid-­lowering drug) may 
be recommended for lowering cholesterol. In 2014 the AHA and the American College of 
Cardiology shifted the emphasis away from lowering LDL and total cholesterol to target 
levels to looking at a person’s entire cardiac risk profile before recommending aggressive 
treatment with statins. You can use the risk calculator on the AHA website (www.heart.
org/gglRisk/main_en_US.html) to determine your cardiac risk.
Vitamins and Minerals
Vitamins and minerals are food elements necessary in very small amounts for the body’s 
normal functioning. They are essential in our diet because the body can’t make them or 
makes them in insufficient amounts. Vegetables and grains are good sources of vitamins. 
There is considerable controversy regarding the benefit of vitamin and mineral supple-
ments in health and disease. For a normal healthy adult, eating a variety of foods should 
provide the essential nutrients; the body can choose what it needs, when needed. No 
research has disputed this to date. What are the needs of a stressed or ill body? I consider 
this question next.

Managing Pain through Nutrition
What is food to one, is to others bitter poison.
—Lucretius (circa 94–55 b.c.e.)
The information presented above should guide your basic nutrition, but there is room for 
a great deal of individual variation. Everyone has different digestive and metabolic rates, 
genetic compositions, and activity levels. All of these factors affect food requirements. Be 
cautious about the many conflicting and sometimes dangerous diet fads. The two pain 
syndromes that have received the most attention in terms of food-­related symptom wors-
ening are rheumatoid arthritis, discussed earlier, and migraine headaches.
Again, there does appear to be internal body wisdom. You can learn from your body 
if you do not ignore its signals, such as increasing pain, fatigue, or indigestion after eating 
certain foods or drinking certain beverages. Just as you should learn to listen to your pain 
and distress, listen to your body’s response to eating. This will help you to understand 
how you eat, when you eat, what you eat, and why you eat.
Certain foods and beverages are associated with increased pain in some people. Keep 
a Food Diary similar to your Pain Diary (a Food Diary form is provided in Appendix F 
and is available for downloading at www.guilford.com/managepain). Use it to identify 
patterns. For example, do you avoid certain drinks or foods because of your pain? If so, 
what do you avoid? Do you eat more of a certain food group? If so, what foods are these? 
Do you have a comfort food? Mine is peanut butter. Ever noticed how a piece of choco-
late can make you feel good? These latter observations have been linked to endorphin 
production, the body’s natural “feel good” substances.
How to Eat: Behavioral “Appetizers” and “Desserts”
We live in a fast-paced, high-­stress society. For those who have the added challenge of 
pain, it is particularly important to take the proper time to prepare to eat.
Before you begin your meal, take a few moments to smell the aromas and look at the 
colors of the food in front of you. Saying grace or giving thanks may be a way to allow 
you to pause in this manner before taking your nourishment. Practicing the mindfulness 
techniques discussed in Chapter 3 can help slow down your eating and may improve 
digestion. It takes about 20 minutes for the brain to receive the satiety (“I’m full”) mes-
sage from the stomach. Eating too fast can contribute to overeating because the brain 
receives the message too late to slow down your intake.
When possible, eat without distractions. Avoid eating with a newspaper, a magazine, 
or the television in front of you. Notice what it feels like just to eat. Are you bored or 
anxious? Does eating feel pleasurable?
After eating, take a few moments to read, enjoy a pleasurable activity, or daydream 
as your body digests its food. If you feel uncomfortable, bloated, or have indigestion, it 
may reflect what you’ve eaten or how you’ve eaten. These are important cues to document 
in your diary.

Quick Skill
There are creative ways to slow down your eating, and you can start now. Eating more 
slowly will allow those messages of eating enough to get to the brain before you 
overdo. Here are a few suggestions.
1.	 Start with dessert. If you crave a sweet, take a small square of chocolate or two 
bites of a dessert to begin the meal.
2.	 Drink a glass of water before you start eating and then put down the fork to sip 
small amounts of water in between bites.
3.	 Chew each bite of food 10 times.
4.	 Mix it up: Use your nondominant hand to hold the fork or use chopsticks to help 
slow down your intake of food.
5.	 Socialize while eating; talking with your mouth full is not considered polite, so talk-
ing will create pauses between bites and make the meal experience more fun.
6.	 During and after each bite, savor the texture, flavor, and aroma of the food as you 
slowly chew. Eating mindfully allows you to experience the pleasure of eating and 
gives you practice at being in the moment.
7.	 Avoid not eating for prolonged periods. It is more difficult to slow down if you are 
very hungry.
8.	 Sit down to eat. Standing while eating or on the go can increase the pace of eating.
When to Eat
Many of us eat on an uneven or arbitrary schedule. Some people eat between meals 
because those are the times they find themselves hungry or bored. Others skip meals and 
consume most of their calories in the evening.
Popular wisdom states that eating a good breakfast (literally, “break-fast”) is a healthy 
thing to do because it supplies your body with the energy to start your daily activities, 
but the research to support this belief is hard to come by. Certainly the food you choose 
to eat at breakfast is more important than whether you eat upon awakening. Skipping 
breakfast may make it more difficult to avoid doughnuts or pastries at work or to make 
healthy choices at lunch if you are too hungry. Keeping your food diary may allow you 
the opportunity to explore what works best for you.
Eating the largest meal of the day in the evening is not conducive to using the nutri-
ents for energy. It may contribute to weight gain, poor sleep, and reflux (the movement 
of acid from the stomach back into the esophagus) if sleep follows too closely after the 
evening meal.

150	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
What to Eat and Why
Once again, eating a variety of fresh foods in moderation is the key to healthy eating. If 
you need to lose weight, watch the fat and carbohydrate content of your foods, exercise, 
and consume moderate portions.
Identifying what you eat and noting any corresponding increase or decrease in your 
pain can also help you determine which foods, ingredients, or additives to avoid and 
which foods to keep in your diet. (Some specific suggestions are provided below.)
Identifying why you eat is also critical, because many people who have pain report 
that eating makes them feel good, at least temporarily. Eating is thought to release endor-
phins (the body’s own painkillers), which may explain this good feeling. So consider-
ing how eating makes you feel may give you important clues to getting the most out of 
your diet. You may find, for instance, that you overeat for comfort. Nurturing yourself 
in other ways—­through practicing mindfulness and RR techniques, becoming aware of 
other pleasurable activities, and seeking social support—may help reduce your need for 
“comfort eating.”
Food Ingredients and Additives Linked to Increased Pain
Let’s take a look at the following culprits that have been associated with increases in pain:
• Caffeine
• Alcohol
• Monosodium glutamate (MSG)
• Aspartame/sucralose
Caffeine
Caffeine is an addictive stimulant, so it is advisable to consider decreasing your caf-
feine intake when you are under a lot of stress or in pain. But be careful: You can expe-
rience headaches and fatigue if you suddenly stop drinking caffeinated beverages alto-
gether. Instead of stopping abruptly, you should gradually decrease your intake to avoid 
withdrawal symptoms. For example, instead of having five cups of coffee each morn-
ing, try two cups of decaffeinated coffee and three cups of regular coffee for a week. 
Next, continue to decrease the number of cups of regular coffee until you are drinking 
only decaffeinated coffee. Then decrease the number of cups of decaf as well, if you  
wish.
Caffeine is naturally present in coffee, tea, chocolate, and cocoa. It is also found in 
some soft drinks (such as colas, some non-cola drinks, guarana, and other energy drinks) 
and in many prescription and nonprescription drugs (particularly cold, pain, stimulant, 
and weight-­control preparations). The following table shows how caffeine levels can vary, 
depending on the type of beverage and how it is prepared.

*The longer the coffee and tea are brewed, the greater the caffeine content.
Alcohol
Alcohol dilates blood vessels and therefore may trigger migraines or worsen exist-
ing headaches. An earlier theory that migraines were caused by blood vessel dilatation 
following intense constriction is now known to be inaccurate or at best an inadequate 
explanation. However, about 30% of migraine sufferers find that alcohol is best left 
alone, whatever the underlying mechanism may be. Other substances that may dilate 
blood vessels are tyramine and histamine. Tyramine can be found in red wine and some 
cheeses; histamine can be found in some wines and champagnes.
Many other people with pain also find a link between pain and alcohol use. If you do 
not find that your pain improves when alcohol is eliminated from your diet, then drinking 
in moderation is best. If you do find that your pain improves when alcohol is eliminated, 
you would do well to avoid alcohol completely.
Remember that alcoholic beverages also contain a lot of calories. One and a half 
ounces of gin, rum, vodka, or whiskey contain about 116 calories. A 12-ounce can of 
beer has about 145 calories.
Using alcohol to numb pain can be a problem. Although it is an age-old remedy for 
acute pain, its use in chronic pain can create more physical and social problems in the 
long run. If you drink alcohol within 2 hours of bedtime, it can disrupt your sleep by 
reducing the deep sleep and dreaming stages. Excessive drinking can also result in liver, 
pancreas, muscle, and brain dysfunction in susceptible individuals. If you have ever felt 
that you should cut down on your drinking, ever been annoyed by people criticizing your 
drinking, ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking, or ever had a drink first thing in 
the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover, then it would be wise to take 
heed and seek medical help.

152	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
MSG
MSG is a flavor enhancer found in many prepared foods but commonly associated 
with Chinese food. Individuals sensitive to MSG may experience headaches, a burning 
sensation in the face, sweating, and chest tightness. Studies show that people who experi-
ence migraines may or may not be more prone to headaches caused by MSG. Avoidance 
is the best treatment if you are sensitive. But beware: MSG can be hidden in broth or 
bouillon cubes and other food products, so read labels to determine whether it is present.
Aspartame/Sucralose
Aspartame (brand name: NutraSweet®) and sucralose (brand name: Splenda®) have 
been associated with headache symptoms in sensitive individuals. Both aspartame and 
sucralose can be found in a wide assortment of diet products; again, check the labels. If 
you are drinking a lot of diet drinks or eating a lot of diet products that contain aspar-
tame or sucralose, you may want to stop consuming them to see whether there is any 
effect on your pain, especially if you are experiencing headaches.
The Role of Vitamins and Minerals in Reducing Pain
The use of magnesium, zinc, B vitamins, and vitamins E and C has been promoted in 
chronic pain conditions that have an inflammatory component. The lack of consistent 
scientific findings may reflect human variability and the subjective nature of pain rather 
than the failure of these supplements to help. On the other hand, these inconsistent find-
ings may mean that these supplements have no value. At this time, there is no consistent 
evidence that taking most mineral or vitamin supplements (in addition to your normal 
diet) is helpful in relieving pain.
A calcium-rich diet or calcium supplementation is important, however, because of 
the high incidence of osteoporosis (brittle bones) in postmenopausal women and in men 
as well, although they may develop the condition 5 to 10 years later than women. Vita-
min D is also important because of its role in bone formation. Adequate amounts of this 
vitamin may be obtained through supplemented milk or exposure to sunlight if you live 
below the 40th parallel north in latitude. If you live above the 40th parallel, that is, north 
of San Francisco, Denver, or Philadelphia, sun exposure in the winter is not adequate for 
supplying Vitamin D. A simple blood test can tell whether your vitamin D level is normal. 
Osteoporosis is the number one cause of disability in women over 65 years of age in the 
United States and is associated with fractures of the spine and hip. Men and women both 
start losing calcium from their bone stores in their 30s; after menopause, however, the 
rate of loss for susceptible women is accelerated. Risk factors include the following:
• Having a family history of osteoporosis
• Being white and of Northern European background
• Smoking

	
Nutrition and Pain	
153
• Being thin
• Being inactive
There has been a lot of controversy regarding how much calcium women should 
take and in what form. For prevention, current recommendations encourage women to 
get an adequate amount of calcium in their diet before menopause. The dosage recom-
mended is 1,000 mg per day of calcium for nonpregnant, nonlactating women over 25 
years of age. This dosage is equal to four 8-ounce glasses of milk or five Tums® tablets 
a day. For postmenopausal women who are at risk for osteoporosis, the recommended 
dosage is 1,200 mg of calcium per day. The calcium recommendations are total daily con-
sumptions. There are online calcium calculators that can help you assess if your dietary 
intake alone is sufficient; for example, see www.iofbonehealth.org/calcium-calculator. 
The association of increased risk of coronary artery disease with calcium supplementa-
tion in older women has been reported and remains controversial. Food-based sources 
of calcium are milk, yogurt, other dairy products, and green leafy vegetables. There are 
also medications available to treat osteoporosis, for example, alendronate (Fosamax®), 
zoledronic (Reclast®), and denosumab (Prolia®). A DEXA bone density scan is used to 
determine risk for bone loss so that the appropriate prevention effort or treatment can be 
recommended. Regular exercise helps with prevention.
Summary
Why Discuss Nutrition?
• Good eating habits are essential for good health. Some specific foods and eating 
behaviors can affect pain levels. There is a lot of misinformation at present about 
nutritional therapies for pain.
• Studies of nutritional therapies are difficult to carry out for a number of reasons, 
and the results of such studies must be evaluated with extreme care.
• You can follow some basic nutritional recommendations now to improve your gen-
eral health and help you in pain management.
Fresh Is Best; Moderation
• Commercially prepared foods are more likely to have added salt, sugar, saturated 
fats, preservatives, and artificial color.
• Consuming a diet high in fat and sodium and low in fiber can put you at risk for 
developing heart disease, some cancers (colon), high blood pressure, and obesity.
• Eating fresh foods in moderation will help you maintain a stable weight that is 
appropriate for your height.

154	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Basic Nutritional Guidelines
• The six basic food groups are:
 Grains (whole and refined)
 Vegetables
 Fruits
 Milk, yogurt, and cheese
 Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts
 Oils
• The six basic food groups provide us with the following required nutrients: carbo-
hydrates, proteins, fats, and vitamins and minerals.
• Basic daily recommendations for healthy adults:
 Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes (beans), fish, lean 
meat, and poultry.
 The recommended daily amount of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes 
(beans), fish, lean meat, and poultry, dairy and oil is determined by age, sex, 
and physical activity.
 Meal portions can be visualized by picturing a dinner plate with ½ filled with 
fruits and vegetables, ¼ with meat or meat substitute, and ¼ with starch and 
grains (with greater than 50% of grains as whole grains).
 Think about modifying the size of your plate, bowl, and cup to consume 
smaller amounts of food if weight control is an issue.
 Use fat-free and low-fat dairy products but check labels for additional sugar 
and other high-­calorie additives that can add to total calories.
Managing Pain through Nutrition
• Keep a Food Diary (see sample in Appendix F) for several weeks to help you iden-
tify how, when, what, and why you eat. Look for any diet-­associated patterns in 
your pain.
• Take the time to prepare yourself for eating. Eat mindfully. Try to eat without 
distractions, and pay attention to the nourishment you are taking into your body. 
After eating, take some time to sit quietly and let the food digest.
• Follow these recommendations regarding when to eat:
 Do eat a healthy breakfast to get energy for your daily activities.
 Do not fast for prolonged periods, and avoid eating sweets as snacks.
 Don’t skip meals.
 Don’t consume most of your calories in the evening.
• Track what you eat and drink and whether each item makes your pain condition 
better or worse. This monitoring tells you which foods to avoid and which foods 
to keep in your diet.

	
Nutrition and Pain	
155
• Think about why you eat. This can help you see when you eat for psychological 
reasons (it’s comforting, soothing) and when you need physical nourishment.
• Experiment with avoiding the following substances if you experience certain symp-
toms:
 Caffeine (general pain, stress)
 Alcohol (migraines or other headaches, general pain)
 MSG (headaches, burning face, sweating, chest tightness)
 Aspartame and sucralose (headaches, generalized body pain)
• At this time there is no consistent evidence that taking most vitamin or mineral 
supplements in addition to your normal diet is helpful in relieving pain. Calcium 
supplements need to be considered, however, because of the increased incidence 
of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and older men that can lead to bone 
fractures. You may also need vitamin D supplements if you live north of the 40th 
parallel.
Exploration Tasks
1.	 If you think it might be helpful, record everything you eat and drink for 1 week, using the 
Food Diary provided in Appendix F. Taking photos of your plate with your smartphone 
before eating is another way of checking portion amounts and the proportion of food 
groups. At the end of the week, look over your diary and photos and see where you 
might like to alter your diet. This might be more helpful if you suffer with migraines, an 
inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, or would like to start losing weight.
Or for 2 to 4 weeks eat a diet with no to little meat; lots of fruits, grains, and vegeta-
bles; no sweet snacks; and no alcohol or caffeine. If you are a big caffeine drinker, you may 
want to gradually decrease the amount of caffeine you drink so you won’t suffer with-
drawal symptoms. Observe whether your pain is affected by the dietary change. If you 
sense any improvement, continue the diet for at least 2 months to give it a sufficient trial.
2.	 Set a goal that you want to accomplish related to your diet. Once again, make sure your 
goal is a behavioral task that you can measure in terms of the steps that you will take to 
accomplish it. Here is an example:
Goal:   Eat more fruits and vegetables in the recommended proportions.	
Steps to take to reach that goal:
A.	  List fruits and vegetables that I like.	
B.	  Use the smartphone photos of my plate to visualize my proportions of fruits, 	
	
 vegetables, grains and starch, meat or meat substitutes.	
C.	  Use a 10-inch plate for my meals.

your pain) is causing you particular stress or anxiety, try imagining yourself in a safe, 
pleasant place (see Chapter 3, RR Technique 5). Describe your special place:

Effective Communication
If you loved me, you’d know what I mean.
—Me, to my husband
Communication skills enable you to get a message across, to express how you feel, to 
receive feedback, and to listen without judging. The reason a chapter on basic commu-
nication skills is included in a book on managing chronic pain is this: People in pain feel 
much distress not only because of their pain but also because of trying to communicate 
with others about their pain.
There are three basic types of communication problems. Most people, with or with-
out pain, experience these problems at some point:
1.	 There is a mismatch between the words people speak (their statements) and what 
they really want (their intentions).
2.	People do not state clearly how they feel, what they want, or what they need 
(assertiveness). They tend either to deny their own feelings (“You count, I 
don’t”—passiveness) or to disregard the feelings of others (“I count, you don’t”—­
aggressiveness).
3.	 People hear, but they don’t really listen (active listening).
This chapter describes all three types of problems and provides suggestions for over-
coming them, with special attention to the context of living with chronic pain.
Making Statements Match Intentions
General Communication: A Sample Scenario
Let’s take a look at the following scenario:

	
Effective Communication	
159
You just came back from shopping, having bought a dress for slightly more money 
than you would normally spend. This was a treat for participating in the pain pro-
gram, so you feel only slightly guilty. You put the dress on for dinner that night.
When your husband comes home, you ignore at first his observation that the 
trash barrels have not been brought in. Finally you say, “Well, what do you think?” 
(You realize that this is a loaded question, given the expense of the dress.)
“About the trash barrels?” he says, only slightly bewildered.
“The dress, the dress!” you exclaim.
“It’s okay,” he mumbles, really confused now.
You storm out of the room screaming about how insensitive and self-­centered 
he is. You feel that if he loved you, he would know what you mean and want. He is 
thoroughly baffled.
The first principle of effective communication is to be clear about what you really 
want to say to others. (I confess I act at times as if my spouse is a mind reader, but doing 
this really does not help communication with him or anyone else.) Matching statements 
with intentions is an art and a skill. It also requires you to be responsible for your side of 
the conversation.
Let’s go back to the scenario you just read. If your intention is to get feedback that 
you deserve this dress and you look great in it, then you could play “Twenty Questions.” 
Or you could say something like this: “I bought myself a dress today as a ‘pick-me-up.’ 
I’m looking for confirmation that I deserve to treat myself to this, and that you think I 
look great.”
Some people feel that “it doesn’t count” unless praise comes spontaneously from the 
other person. However, the other person (for example, the husband in this scenario) does 
not have to respond in the way you wish. What you want will be a lot clearer if your state-
ment reflects your intent. He or she is still left with the option to comply or not.
Communication with Health Care Professionals: Put It in Writing
The following practice exercise may be useful for your interactions with health care pro-
fessionals, which can often be confusing and frustrating because of the mismatch of state-
ments and intentions. Please read no further until you’ve done this exercise.
1.	 Assume that your pain has become worse. You go to the doctor. What do you say? Write 
out a statement to your physician. (It is important that you make this an imaginary inter-
action, that is, not a play-by-play of the last visit with your physician.)
	
	

160	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
	
	
2.	 Now, write what you really want the doctor to say back to you.
	
	
	
	
In many of our interactions with others, we wish to receive the following:
• Information
• Analysis
• Advice
• Understanding
• Reassurance
If you have completed the exercise above, you can see what you wanted by looking 
at the doctor’s statement to you (the second statement). Were you asking for information, 
advice, analysis, reassurance, understanding, or some combination of these? Was it clear 
in your statement to the doctor what you were looking for?
If you are like most people, your imaginary statement to the doctor was something 
like this: “My pain is worse—I hurt more now than ever.” End of sentence! If you want 
advice, analysis, or reassurance, then you’ll be disappointed in real life if the doctor says, 
“It’s nothing. Take two aspirin and call me in the morning.”
Try rewriting your first statement to your doctor. This time, however, include clear 
requests for advice, analysis, information, understanding, and/or reassurance. Here is an 
example: “My pain is worse. I would like you to examine me and run the appropriate 
tests to see if this is just a flare-up or something new. Should I change anything in terms 
of treatment? I’m scared, so I would appreciate it if you would do this to reassure me.”
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
A lot of people find that asking for advice, analysis, or information is easy compared 
with asking for understanding or reassurance. Sometimes it’s because they expect the 

	
Effective Communication	
161
latter to be automatic: “If you cared about me, you’d know what I want.” It may also have 
to do with feeling that they are undeserving of this kind of attention or respect.
Doing this exercise can also uncover a “secret” desire for a cure or a miracle. If you 
are looking for miracles, be up front about it and ask directly. Then you and your physi-
cian can at least discuss the newest treatments or the lack of them.
Deborah Tannen, author of You Just Don’t Understand (see “Supplementary Read-
ing”), says that giving advice is a common male communication response. If this is correct, 
then it may explain why many women patients complain that they did not get statements 
of reassurance or understanding from the once predominantly male medical profession. 
In fact, women may not even think to ask for such statements. Many medical doctors sim-
ply do not feel that statements of reassurance and understanding are relevant in standard 
exchanges; others may feel that they demonstrate understanding or reassurance by giving 
advice or sharing information.
Clearly, if you do not feel the need for reassurance, understanding, or any other item 
on the list above, then you do not need to ask for it. You are seeking clarification of your 
unique agenda. If your intentions are unclear or indirectly stated, you will not get what 
you need or it will be left to chance. You will feel misunderstood, used, and abused. Of 
course, just making clear what you want does not guarantee that you will get it. But I 
believe you will be pleasantly surprised at the results once you begin practicing clearer 
communication.
Here are other suggestions for improving your interactions with health care profes-
sionals. These tips can help you prepare for your next doctor visit, no matter what symp-
toms you have. So before your next visit, do the following:
1.	 Write down your questions, listing the most important ones to you, first.
2.	Be ready to describe the symptom or problem that has brought you to the doctor. 
Keep the description simple and brief.
3.	 Ask yourself these questions about your symptoms or problem:
Where is it located?
When did it start? When does it occur?
Describe the sensation (symptom): Is it sharp, burning, throbbing, aching, or 
the like?
What makes it better?
What makes it worse?
What have you done about it?
4.	 If the problem is related to your chronic pain, it is important to be very specific 
about your symptoms. Ask yourself:
Is the pain more severe? How so?
Has the pain quality changed (for example, it was tingling, now it’s burning)?

162	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
Has the location of your pain changed (for example, it was in your lower back 
and now it’s down the back of your right leg)?
Are you experiencing additional symptoms (for example, spasm, fever, loss of 
bladder or bowel control, weight loss) with your pain?
Write down your answers to these questions and bring them with you. Many 
diagnoses are made from the patterns and interactions of symptoms, so this is 
important information. You may find it helpful to bring a chart of your pain levels 
(or symptom patterns) over time.
5.	 Know what medications you are taking and the dosage for each. Bring the medica-
tion list you completed for Chapter 2 with you. Don’t forget to include over-the-­
counter medications, herbals, and other supplements you’re taking.
6.	 If you feel that there is a particular issue you need to discuss in detail that requires 
more than a 15-minute appointment, state this when you call your health care 
professional. The receptionist is not a mind reader, either.
7.	 Clarify your expectations. During your visit, are you looking for a miracle, diag-
nostic tests, a treatment plan, or a prognosis?
The Weekly Feedback Sheet in Appendix F (also available for downloading from 
www.guilford.com/managepain) can also help you communicate clearly and explicitly 
with health care professionals.
After listening to your history and doing an examination related to your symptoms, 
the health care professional should be able to give you an opinion on what is going on 
or what might be investigated further. He or she should then give you a plan that may 
include diagnostic tests, medication or changes in medication, other no-drug therapies, 
and education. Ask for this plan in writing if you think you will not remember what is 
being said or do not have a family member with you.
If you are given a new medication or therapy, track your symptom in your Pain Diary 
over the next week or more (depending on treatment). Have the symptoms that brought 
you to the office changed? How have they changed and when did they change? This will 
be important feedback for your clinician. Often therapies and medications are started, 
but then there is little follow-up discussion of whether they make enough of a differ-
ence to warrant continued use. As a result, people continue injection therapies, physical 
therapy, or medication long after their effectiveness is past.
Assertiveness
“Assertiveness” means expressing how you feel while respecting the rights of others: “I 
count, you count.” There are three common obstacles to becoming assertive:

	
Effective Communication	
163
1.	 You do not feel entitled to speak up about how you feel, what you want, or what 
you need.
2.	You confuse assertiveness with passiveness (“You count, I don’t”) or with aggres-
sion (“I count, you don’t”).
3.	 You don’t know why you feel the way you do, either because you never thought 
about it or because you are communicating in a style that is based on past assump-
tions or attitudes.
Obstacle 1: Not Feeling Entitled to Speak Up
Just as you learned irrational beliefs and cognitive distortions early in life, you learned 
certain “rules” of communication. For example:
“It’s not proper to speak unless spoken to.”
“Children should be seen and not heard.”
“You have to answer all inquiries. If questioned, you can’t say ‘I don’t know.’ ”
“You should always accommodate others. It’s not right to say no.”
From these unconscious rules, you learn to suppress your opinion. According to Deb-
orah Tannen (see “Supplementary Reading”), you have learned this thoroughly if you are 
a woman. Women receive different messages about communicating than men do, and one 
of these is that women should not speak up for themselves.
Many of you may still feel uncomfortable about speaking up for what you feel, want, 
or need. You may find it helpful to consider assertiveness as a two-way street. You do 
have a right to express your opinion about how you feel and what you want or think you 
need; however, there are responsibilities that go along with those rights, which involve 
your awareness of the rights, wants, and needs of others. Melodie Chenevert, a nurse, 
writes about the need for rights and responsibilities in her book Special Techniques in 
Assertiveness Training:
Rights–­Responsibilities
Rights

Take time to add other rights and responsibilities to those listed here. The assertive 
person knows that abusing either rights or responsibilities is self-­destructive.
Obstacle 2: Confusing Assertiveness with Passiveness or Aggression
Let’s consider three basic styles of behaviors when communicating with others—­passive, 
aggressive, and assertive—from the perspective of our previous discussion. What are the 
intentions of passive, aggressive, and assertive statements?
Statement
Intention
Passive
“Okay, whatever you say, I don’t care.”
“Do whatever you want to do [sigh].”
“To keep the peace, I don’t make waves; I 
compromise even when it is not called for.”
“You count, I don’t.”
Aggressive
“You’re a jerk! It’s all your fault.”
“To win, I punish, blame, or strike back 
whenever I think it is necessary.”
“I don’t care what you say.”
“I count, you don’t.”
“You’ll do what I say.”
“To win, I intimidate.”
Assertive
“I feel sad when you don’t ask what I would 
like to do, because it makes me think you 
don’t care about me or about what I would 
like. I want you to ask me what I would like 
to do. I will promise to come up with some 
ideas or not hold you responsible if I don’t.”
“I express my feelings, define the behavior 
that gives rise to those feelings, and state the 
reason I feel the way I do. Adding ‘I want’ 
and ‘I will’ expands the assertive statement by 
describing a desired action and identifying my 
responsibility in this interaction. In short: I 
count, you count.”

	
Effective Communication	
165
The advantage of speaking assertively is that it gives you the opportunity to express 
your point of view. However, this style also demands a certain honesty about, and a clear 
understanding of, what it is you really want. Hence, we have the third obstacle to asser-
tiveness.
Obstacle 3: Not Knowing Why You Feel the Way You Do
What do you want? Why do you want it? The “formula” for assertive communication is 
as follows:
“I feel              when you              because             .”
This formula requires that all three elements be included. Many people get stuck 
after “I feel”; completing the rest of the sentence means getting in touch with yourself and 
exploring your inner feelings. Let’s take a look at why it’s important to do so.
For almost 2 years Paul had suffered a painful diabetic neuropathy involving his hands 
and lower extremities. He had become unable to do his job as a plumber. Out of work 
for 6 months, he found himself bored and irritable.
One day his oldest child came home from school and made the comment that it 
was cold in the house. Paul became enraged and stormed out to the garage work-
shop, where he commonly retreated when he became upset. He said to himself, “It 
didn’t feel cold to me, the child must be a wimp.” Upon further reflection, however, 
he found himself making statements like “It’s the father’s responsibility to provide 
warmth, food, and protection to his family. If I can’t provide for my family, then I’m 
worthless.”
Paul had not been aware of how distressed he was feeling about not being able 
to work. He went back into the house, and after dinner discussed his feelings with 
his family. His oldest child informed him that the pilot light had gone out on the gas 
furnace and that he had relit it. They all had a good laugh when Paul told them how 
angry he had felt when his son commented about the heat, and how he had taken 
it as a sign that he couldn’t even provide his family with the basics, such as warmth.
Once Paul was able to express his concerns in an assertive way, he was able to 
receive the reassurance from his family that they understood and did not think him 
any less of a father or provider because he was not working outside the home.
Theresa, another patient, expressed frustration over a bathroom remodeling project 
that was going on at home. She found herself extremely irritated with her husband 

166	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
when he showed her a set of faucets that he thought might look nice in the bath-
room. She was outraged and responded that the faucets would be hard to clean and 
that she was the one who would be cleaning them.
When Theresa was asked to turn her response into an assertive statement to her 
husband, she said, “I feel annoyed when you show me fancy faucets to put in the 
bathroom because for the past 25 years, you have never taken what I do into con-
sideration. You always take me for granted.” She was deluged with and surprised by 
feelings resulting from 25 years of marital frustrations. An important point to keep in 
mind about assertive messages is that they cannot be used to correct all past damages 
and unspoken hurts. Theresa was able to see this and realized that her responsibility 
was to decide what she really wanted to communicate. She also realized that she and 
her husband needed to do much more talking with each other.
Theresa’s statements then became this: “I feel conflicted when you ask for my 
approval of fancy faucets because, although they are very pretty, I would find them 
hard to clean. When you present me with what seem to be thoughtless choices, I won-
der if you ever think about all that I do at home when you’re at work.” Actually, as it 
turned out, her husband had never thought of it that way. He was able to appreciate 
why she might not be ecstatic about his choice of faucets, and Theresa was able to 
feel proud that she had stood up and expressed her needs.
“I want” statements help direct the action you want. When there is a need for com-
promise or clarification, “I will” statements help the other person agree to your request. 
For example, Theresa might have said to her husband, “If you bring me a catalogue of 
faucets, I will make an effort to choose one that suits my needs.”
It’s important to differentiate between a hurtful and aggressive statement and one 
that is used to clarify your feelings or intentions. For example, the statement “I feel you 
are a jerk” is not assertive, even though it begins with “I feel.” Although aggressive state-
ments may flow more easily than assertive ones, they rarely accomplish anything except 
revenge (“I’ll show them!”), which is usually short-lived. They complicate further com-
munication or eliminate it altogether.
Passive statements, such as “It’s up to you” or “I don’t care,” may be appropriate at 
times when used judiciously and consciously. If they merely reinforce martyrdom or self-
abuse, then they too will poison communication and relationships.
The major difficulties in beginning assertive communication are (1) becoming con-
scious of why you feel the way you do and (2) taking responsibility for how you feel, 
rather than blaming others or wishing things could be different. One of the reasons that 
Chapter 5 gives you the opportunity to identify negative self-talk and other negative 
responses is to help you overcome these difficulties. Although at first it may seem uncom-
fortable or awkward to state directly how you feel, it allows true dialogue (two-way 
communication). Completing the Assertiveness Questionnaire, provided at the end of this 
chapter, will help you identify situations in which assertiveness may be awkward for you.

	
Effective Communication	
167
Active Listening
Active listening is a technique that can deescalate (or at least clarify) many emotional 
exchanges. It is a first step in conflict resolution and prevention. Active listening requires 
truly hearing what someone else is saying—not judging, parroting, questioning, support-
ing, rationalizing, or defending.
For example, suppose that your spouse announces, “I’m fed up with how the house 
always looks.” Now this is understandably a loaded statement, because you may already 
be feeling uneasy about your inability to keep up with things when you have a pain prob-
lem. Here are some replies that can escalate the situation:
• Judging: “You shouldn’t feel that way.”
• Parroting: “So you don’t like the way the house looks?”
• Questioning: “Really? Do you have any brilliant ideas on how to keep up with it?”
• Supporting: “Things will get better. I’ll try harder.”
• Rationalizing: “You’ve had a hard day at work. Sit down and cool off.”
• Defending: “I do the best I can, but you’re never satisfied.”
Some of these statements sound more reasonable than others, but each one ends the 
discussion prematurely—either by jumping to conclusions, not allowing further informa-
tion, or putting off the conversation.
A phrase that can be useful in these cases comes from the work of psychologist Carl 
Rogers:
“You sound              about             .”
Let’s fill in the blanks to explore the above scenario further: “You sound upset about 
the housekeeping.” Possible responses from your spouse include the following:
“Oh, it’s not just here; it’s the chaos at work. I feel so overwhelmed because I can’t get 
things done. I have two projects due. . . .”
“You better believe I’m upset. I work hard all day and I don’t like coming home to a 
house in disarray.”
With active listening, you buy time and get a better idea of what the other person is 
feeling. Then you can make a choice between expending the energy or effort to answer, 
or deciding not to involve yourself in the other person’s distress. Once you have decided to 
reply, it can be very rewarding to deflect responses that are potential sources of conflict. 
You can do this by first acknowledging how the other person feels; this permits both par-
ties to respect their differences. Second, clarify the actual source of distress. This second 
step eases discussion onto neutral ground where problem solving can occur. For example, 

168	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
“You better believe I’m upset . . .” might be followed by this: “I’m sorry you’re upset. I 
wanted to check out whether it was me, the way the house looks, or something else that 
was bothering you.” From here, the conversation could proceed to problem solving—that 
is, how to handle the fact that the house is in disarray and that it may be difficult to keep 
up with maintaining it.
Active listening thus serves to defuse emotional energies that can quickly escalate into 
confrontation. It also allows you to be reflective, empathic, objective, and nonjudgmental. 
By naming the other person’s feelings, you encourage him or her to further express them. 
By clarifying what these feelings are about, you promote problem solving and reinforce a 
healthier expression of emotions. Like any new behavior, active listening takes practice—
but it is well worth the effort.
Further Suggestions for Communication Practice
Most of us have a difficult time changing our communication styles. Perhaps this is 
because we think little about communication once we have learned to speak. If you are 
finding this part difficult, some suggestions may help you practice. In the beginning, as 
with monitoring your self-talk, the process can appear long and laborious. But the more 
you practice, the easier it will get. Notice when you experience interpersonal conflict or 
discomfort. This is a good time to pause and reflect on where the communication prob-
lem might be. Has your intent been clearly stated? Are you being passive or aggressive out 
of habit? Have you considered where the other person is coming from, or have you simply 
assumed you know? Is it a gender-based or cultural conflict that involves communication 
styles, not personality issues?
Quick Skill
Sometimes it is difficult to observe our own unspoken communication cues. So try this at 
a mall, park, or some public event. Observe the people around you in conversation. Pick a 
conversation that you think is going well. What are the cues you see? Are the two people 
looking at each other? Smiling? Nodding? Is there physical contact? What is the space 
between them? Are their arms at their side, folded in front or waving in front of the other 
person? How many cues can you pick up? Reflect on why these cues might be associated 
with positive communication. Could any of the cues you identify be sources of miscommu-
nication and in what context? You can expand these observations with communications 
that look angry or sad, although you will most likely need to be more discreet.
An experience I had on a trip with a group of Spanish, English, and American tour-
ists illustrates the last of these points. We stopped in a small Greek resort town to eat 

	
Effective Communication	
169
lunch. After we had waited in the buffet line for over an hour, the problem became appar-
ent. We overheard various English and Spanish groups discussing it with great animation. 
Each nationality was accusing the other of “queuing up” (that is, lining up) from the 
“wrong” side. The English claimed that “Everyone knows you queue from the left”; the 
Spanish were just as vehement about queuing from the right. (The Americans, of course, 
just barged right into the middle of the line.) The conflict, which quickly became person-
alized, was based on cultural factors that no group was willing or able to acknowledge at 
the time. Major battles have probably been started over misunderstandings of even lesser 
magnitude and significance.
Taking responsibility for our words and thoughts is not easy. We tend automatically 
to apply long-held, often unexamined, attitudes to our problems. Our solutions are too 
often quick fixes that may not hold up over the longer term. Communication habits can 
be hard to change, but few of us can afford to indulge in ways of communicating that 
don’t really work. As you will see for yourself, practicing effective communication skills 
can make your life a great deal easier.
Summary
• There are three important aspects of effective communication: making statements 
match intentions, assertiveness, and active listening.
• “Making statements match intentions” refers to saying clearly what you really 
want. This is particularly important in communication with health care providers. 
Make it plain what you are requesting: information, analysis, advice, understand-
ing, and/or reassurance.
• Prepare yourself before going to see your health professional by reflecting on the 
symptoms or problems you wish to have addressed. Review the when, where, what, 
and how questions and write down your answers. Bring your symptom diary, your 
up-to-date medication list, and the list of questions you want to get answered.
• Assertiveness is a positive and direct way of expressing how you feel while respect-
ing the rights of others. There are three common obstacles to becoming assertive:
 Not feeling entitled to speak up
 Confusing assertiveness with passivity or aggression
 Not knowing why you feel the way you do
• The formula for assertive statements is: “I feel              when you 
              because             .”
• Active listening is a conscious technique; it requires truly hearing what someone 
else is saying without assuming that you know what the person is trying to say.
• After active listening, a useful response that can deescalate or clarify emotional 
exchanges is to say “You sound              about             .”

He or she said:

Effective Communication	
171
Once you have recorded the conversation, analyze it in terms of the assertive communi-
cation guidelines discussed in this chapter. Did you use “I” sentences (“I feel,” “I want,” 
etc.)? Did you describe the specific behavior that was troubling you and why? Did you 
express your opinion and views and respect those of the other person? Finally, look at 
what followed the conversation. If you were assertive, what stress do you think you 
avoided? If you were not assertive, did you get what you needed?
3.	 Continue to keep track of your negative self-talk and other negative responses, using the 
worksheet provided in Appendix F (“Daily Record of Self-Talk”). Now, consider this ques-
tion: How can you reframe those thoughts to reflect the reality of the situation, using “I 
can” and “I need” statements? Pay particular attention to those situations involving con-
flict in communication with others. What is the source of the conflict as you see it? Are 
there unspoken assumptions or expectations involved? Do you have the “whole picture,” 
or do you need more information?
4.	 Practice the “You sound about” listening response to the following statements, and 
then use  an assertive response (“I feel              when you              because  
        ”) to practice stating your intent. Use the “I want” and “I will” statements, too.
A.	 “You should be better by now! There is nothing wrong on X-rays or blood tests, and 
yet you still have pain. I have nothing more to offer you!”
Listening response: 	
	
	
Assertive response: 	
	
	
B.	 “Every time I call you to do something, you give me this vague story about not know-
ing if you’ll be able to go.”
Listening response: 	
	
	
Assertive response: 	
	
	

172	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
C.	 “What is this, a perpetual vacation? When are you going back to work, or don’t you 
want to give up a good thing?”
Listening response: 	
	
	
Assertive response: 	
	
	
5.	 Write out a goal that you want to accomplish related to the material in this chapter. As 
always, make sure your goal is a behavioral task that you can measure in terms of the 
steps you will take to accomplish it. Here is an example:
Goal:   To communicate clearly with my doctor at my next visit.	
Steps to take to reach that goal:
A.	  Clarify my expectations of the visit by writing out a statement to the doctor. 	
	
 Make sure it reflects my intentions.	
B.	  Chart my pain on a graph so that the preceding 4-week pattern is displayed.	
C.	  Bring my medication list with me.	
D.	  Write out my questions before I go, putting the most important ones first.	
Now it’s your turn.
Goal: 	
Steps to take to reach that goal:
A.	 	
B.	 	
C.	 	
D.	 	
In addition, list contingency plans. Identify what obstacles might get in the way of your 
accomplishing this goal. What solutions can you devise to ensure the success of this goal?

6.	 Now is a good time to start exploring Relaxation Technique 9 (see Chapter 3), if you 
have not already tried it. After you have worked with the pain image, you can put other 
problems behind the clear plastic wall to examine. Distancing yourself from a problem 
this way can help you develop an objective view of the issue and perhaps become more 
effective at problem solving.

more assertive.
Complete the following questionnaire. Put a checkmark in column A by the items that are appli-
cable to you and then rate those items in column B as:
1
Comfortable
2
Mildly 
uncomfortable
3

Evaluating Your Responses
Examine your answers for an overall picture of what situations and people you find most threaten-
ing. How does nonassertive behavior keep you from attaining the specific items you checked on the 
“Want” list? In putting together your own assertiveness program, focus first on items you rated as fall-
ing in the 2–3 range. These are the situations that you will find easiest to change. Items that are very 
uncomfortable or threatening can be tackled later.

Effective Problem Solving
The problems that exist in the world cannot be solved by the level of 
thinking that created them.
—Albert Einstein
During the time you have had chronic pain, you may have thought that problem solving 
was the next logical step and have been frustrated with your lack of progress in coping 
with your pain. However, people often get caught up in trying to solve problems before 
they are prepared to do so. To be prepared, it is desirable to first quiet your mind chatter 
and decrease your stress response through techniques that elicit the RR. Clarify what you 
are thinking (automatic thought exercise “Daily Record of Self-Talk” in Appendix F) and 
feeling emotionally and understand how your attitudes can enhance or sabotage your 
ability to cope with pain. Developing self-­compassion and adopting positive attitudes 
can lighten your burden. It is helpful to know your communication style, its challenges, 
and to identify what you really need so that you can communicate more effectively with 
those around you. The goal setting done at the end of each chapter also helps prepare you 
for effective problem solving. Each chapter has asked you to practice setting clear goals, 
identifying the emotional barriers (hooks) that drag you away from accomplishing those 
goals, and breaking goals down into small steps. If you have practiced and learned these 
skills to some degree, you are ready to begin problem solving.
Setting Goals: A Closer Look
Take a moment to write down three goals that you would like to accomplish in the next 
6 months. If you need to refresh your memory on setting goals, refer to Chapter 1. As 
before, these longer-term goals need to be ones that you can accomplish by taking specific 
steps; are realistic enough so that there is a chance of accomplishing them; are measurable 

178	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
enough so that you will know when each goal has been reached; and are desired by you, 
not necessarily by someone else.
  1. Goal: 	
  2. Goal: 	
  3. Goal: 	
As you may have discovered, accomplishing goals can be much more difficult than 
setting them. Failing to reach your goals often has little or nothing to do with the smaller 
steps you’ve planned. For example, let’s take a look at a goal set by Barbara, a patient 
with pain.
The Emotional Hook
One of Barbara’s goals was to go back to work. I asked her why she hadn’t done so before 
this. After mentioning her pain and saying she didn’t know what to do, she suddenly 
paused. “You know, the truth is . . . I’m terrified at the prospect.” I asked her to write 
about the problem—her terror—in the format used to examine the self-talk associated 
with negative emotions:
Situation
Thought
Emotion
Thinking error
Going back to work
“I’ll never keep up.”
Terrified
Jumping to conclusions
“I’ll reinjure myself.”
Anxious
Catastrophizing
Barbara was experiencing an “emotional hook.” Picture those long vaudeville hooks 
that pulled bad acts off the stage. Emotional hooks are the thinking errors explored in 
Chapter 5. They are the source of self-­defeating talk, and they block your ability to solve 
problems and accomplish your goals.
As long as Barbara remained terrified about whether she could perform at work or 
might be reinjured, her emotional hook would pull her away (like a bad vaudeville act) 
from her goal (and her show would not go on!). Emotional hooks need to be dealt with 
before real problem solving can begin. Fortunately, you already have some tools to help 
cope with emotional hooks; they are the same ones you use to deal with negative self-talk. 
First, identify your feelings, your self-talk, and the thinking errors or irrational beliefs 
behind them. Then challenge the reality of those thoughts.
Barbara challenged the thoughts behind her fear. According to objective tests admin-
istered by her occupational health specialist, her pain problem was chronic and a regular 
work routine was not going to harm her more. She knew that she could ask for reasonable 
accommodations in the workplace if she was partially disabled or impaired under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (see “Supplementary Reading”). She had been practicing 

	
Effective Problem Solving	
179
alternating pain-­increasing activities with pain-­decreasing activities for a while. She would 
adjust this to her work routine using the sticky note ideas from Chapter 4. She knew that 
she would need to continue her exercise program, communicate her need to change posi-
tions throughout her workday, and regularly destress herself with mini-­relaxations. She 
was now ready to feel the fear but do it anyway!
Identifying the Barriers to Accomplishing Your Goals
That which we do not bring to consciousness appears in our life as 
fate.
—Carl Gustav Jung
Can you identify an emotional hook keeping you from accomplishing one of your goals? 
Start by asking why you haven’t achieved your goal yet or else pick a goal you feel will 
be difficult to achieve. (Many goals you think are difficult often harbor these emotional 
hooks.) When you consider this goal, are you aware of feeling anxious, fearful, or over-
whelmed? Identify the emotion you feel, then put it in the same format that Barbara did 
above: identify the self-talk (the hook) and the thinking errors that go with it. How will 
you challenge your thoughts? After you’ve done that, look again at your goal. Now, what 
is the “problem” that needs solving? Solving the actual problem is often surprisingly easy, 
once it is untangled from the emotional hook.
Here’s an exercise in identifying an emotional hook and then restating the problem:
Write down one of your goals that feels difficult. (Check the goals you wrote at the begin-
ning of this chapter.)
Goal: 	
When you think about why you haven’t accomplished this goal up to now or why you think 
it might be difficult, what do you feel? Overwhelmed, anxious, fearful?
Feelings (emotional response): 	
What kind of self-talk do you find yourself doing when you think about this emotion or the 
difficulty of the goal? For example: “I can’t do it. What if I fail?” And if you are having dif-
ficulty capturing the self-talk, write about why the goal is such a challenge for you (journal-
ing). You may find that self-talk is not the issue. Is the goal itself unrealistic? Does it involve 
someone else changing his or her behavior? If yes, those are also helpful insights.
Self-talk (automatic thoughts) (a.k.a. emotional hook): 	
	
	
Next, identify the source of the self-talk in terms of thinking errors, catastrophizing, avoid-
ance, denial, and irrational beliefs. For example: “I shouldn’t have to make changes, it wasn’t 

180	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
my fault” = thinking error. “Life should be fair” = irrational belief. “This is the worst thing 
that could happen and I can’t take it” = catastrophizing, overgeneralizing.
Thinking errors or irrational beliefs (Chapter 5)/Negative attitudes (Chapter 6):
	
	
	
	
Now challenge the thoughts that are unrealistic and reflect on the reality of the situation 
in which you find yourself. What can you do and what do you need? If you get stuck, use 
the vertical arrow technique (see Chapter 5, pp. 109–111) or write about the problem for 20 
minutes and see what comes up. For example: “It’s not fair that I have to change how I do 
things, but this is about going forward, creating a new life with pain. What is required is my 
changing how I do things.”
Challenges to self-talk: 	
	
	
	
	
How do you feel about the possibility of accomplishing your goal now? Relieved, sad, but 
committed?
You are now in a better position to plan the steps for achieving your goal because, having 
faced the source of your goblins and ghouls, you won’t let them sabotage your success!
Quick Skill
Describe your problem in 40 words. Now describe the problem in 20 words. Now 
describe the problem in 10 words. Finally, describe the problem in 5 words. The last 
five words are the core of the problem and may also be the place to start for the solu-
tion. (Thanks to Andrew Tarvin at www.humorthatworks.com, for this suggestion.)
Identifying the Steps Needed for Goal Achievement
When planning how to reach your goal, it is important to break it down into many small 
steps, particularly if it is an ambitious goal. These small steps can be grouped into smaller 
goals. This method will help to guarantee your successful accomplishment of the larger 
goal.
For example, Barbara’s goal was to return to work. She broke that large goal down 
into the following smaller steps: She would update her résumé, determine what kind of 
job she wanted and could do, get help from the state’s vocational rehabilitation services, 

	
Effective Problem Solving	
181
and start getting job applications. She would continue to do her exercise routine but split 
it up between the morning and afternoon or evening to accommodate a work schedule. 
She would make sure that she had a routine of getting up and going to bed at the same 
time. She identified friends that she could talk with should she begin to feel overwhelmed 
and made a commitment to continue attending church weekly to get the spiritual support 
she needed. She moved her relaxation technique to bedtime to make sure she would go 
to sleep in the most relaxed state. She identified some cookbooks that could assist her in 
cooking quick but healthy meals. She checked with her occupational therapist to review 
assistive devices that she might incorporate into her work performance. Barbara could 
now move toward accomplishing her goal of returning to work.
Note that the steps for Barbara’s goal of succeeding in returning to work could be 
spelled out and subdivided further. The more you define the steps, the more likely you are 
to accomplish the goal.
Contingency plans are also helpful. I first described these kinds of plans in the 
“Exploration Tasks” for Chapter 3. These plans keep you from failing. For example, if 
Barbara’s stress were to worsen while she was at work, she would take a break in a private 
place she had already arranged, where she could go to elicit the RR. She also arranged for 
a massage therapist to call if her pain flared up.
Take your goal and break it down into the smaller steps you may need to take to 
reach it. Be as specific as you can, dividing each step into smaller steps whenever neces-
sary.

Assessing Your Ways of Coping and Applying Them 
to Problems
If you started at the beginning of this book and did all the exercises, you now have many 
skills to help you cope and move forward. To help remember what you’ve learned, you 
may want to arrange these skills in the following groups:
• Physical ways of coping
• Emotion-­focused coping
• Problem-­focused coping
The physical ways of coping include aerobic exercise, tracking and labeling your 
physical sensations, pacing your activities, eating nutritious food, and doing the mindful-
ness and relaxation techniques that elicit the RR. The emotion-­focused coping skills also 
include doing the mindfulness and relaxation techniques as well as capturing negative 
and challenging self-talk, and practicing communication skills such as assertiveness. The 
problem-­focused coping skills include setting goals, seeking pleasurable activities, identi-
fying resources for obtaining more information, brainstorming with friends and associ-
ates, securing social support, and the like.
You will note that a particular skill may fall into more than one category, depending 
on how it is used and for what purpose. For example, an RR technique can be used to 
calm a tense body (physical coping) as well as a tense emotional state (emotion-­focused 
coping).
Keep in mind that when people ask friends or relatives for help in solving problems, 
there is often an immediate move to a problem-­solving mode: “Have you tried this or 
that?” or “My aunt had that problem and she did this.” As you have seen earlier in this 
chapter, moving to problem solving too early and too quickly can doom it if there is an 

	
Effective Problem Solving	
183
emotional hook. Such hooks require that you first cope with the emotional component 
before you take action to solve the problem.
This program offers a variety of skills. You need to have a variety of coping skills 
and know when to use them to manage life problems in general and chronic pain in par-
ticular. People who have used only physical ways of coping with stress, such as strenuous 
exercise, for example, can become very depressed when chronic pain reduces their level 
of physical activity. That’s why this book gives you a range of options.
You have probably gravitated to some skills more than others and found some skills 
more difficult than others. You will find the ones that best suit your needs, but keep in 
mind that a challenging skill may offer other possibilities not previously considered.
Take some time to go back through the book to see whether you can identify all the skills 
you have learned. Can you organize the skills into the three categories below? Put an asterisk 
(*) by the ones you still want to work on. Creating a list of your skills will come in handy when 
we discuss planning for pain flare-ups.

MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
I love the following poem by Portia Nelson from There’s a Hole in My Sidewalk (see 
Bibliography), because it summarizes the self-­discovery process so well and the metaphor 
is so graphic. This is the same process you have begun by reading this book.
An Autobiography in Five Chapters
	
Chapter 1
	
	
I walk down the street.
	
	
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I fall in.
	
	
I am lost. . . . I am helpless. It isn’t my fault.
	
	
It takes forever to find a way out.
	
Chapter 2
	
	
I walk down the same street.
	
	
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
	
	
I pretend I don’t see it.
	
	
I fall in again.
	
	
I can’t believe I am in this same place.
	
	
But it isn’t my fault.
	
	
It still takes a long time to get out.
	
Chapter 3
	
	
I walk down the same street.
	
	
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
	
	
I see it is there.
	
	
I fall in . . . it’s a habit . . . but my eyes are open.
	
	
I know where I am.
	
	
It is my fault.
	
	
I get out immediately.
	
Chapter 4
	
	
I walk down the same street.
	
	
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
	
	
I walk around it.
	
Chapter 5
	
	
I walk down a different street.

Summary
• Are you stuck and can’t move on? Are the goals you pursue in spite of your pain 
realistic? The shift from assimilative to accommodative coping can be a difficult 
transition (see Chapter 6). Certain thinking styles such as catastrophizing can 
get in the way. People who are unable to adapt flexibly to living with their pain, 

	
Effective Problem Solving	
185
suffer more. Mindfulness meditation may assist in developing acceptance and self-­
compassion. You do not have to give up hope, but you have to live now.
• If you find a goal difficult to accomplish, do the following:
 Look for an emotional hook (negative, defeating self-talk).
 Identify the emotional hook and the thinking errors that go with it.
 Challenge and change the self-talk.
 Now restate the goal.
• Identify the smaller steps you need to take to solve a problem or reach a goal; the 
more you break down and define the steps, the more likely you are to succeed. 
Contingency plans also help ensure success.
• Assess and categorize the skills you have learned in this program as follows:
 Physical ways of coping
 Emotion-­focused coping
 Problem-­focused coping
• In problem solving it is essential to have a variety of skills and know when to use 
them.

The End of the Beginning
This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is 
the end of the beginning.
—Winston Churchill
Pain is an individual experience and there is no simple formula for managing it. That is 
why this book presents a great deal of material. There is no one place you should be at 
this point. If the brain can be coached into new, healthier pathways—as science is now 
discovering—there are many reasons to be hopeful. Much of the work that you have done 
will stay with you and grow as your life evolves. These skills are transferable to other 
issues and problems that may challenge you. Many graduates of this program have told 
me that it took about 6 months before they were confident about the changes they had 
begun to make. Continued skills practice, periodically reviewing the book, and staying 
connected with supportive friends and family all helped sustain the gains they had made. 
Many continued learning by reading the materials listed in the “Supplementary Reading” 
sections (also see the Bibliography).
I also practice the various skills in this book. Although life continues to present me 
with challenges, including pain, I have more control in how I respond to those challenges 
and that has made all the difference. For almost all who have worked with this program, 
pain remains a presence. Most of them, however, have established (or at least begun to 
establish) satisfying and fulfilled lives beyond the pain.
Relapse Prevention
During your good times, it is important to think ahead about how to handle the more dif-
ficult times. This kind of planning is called “relapse prevention.” It helps to keep a relapse 
from happening or keeps it short-lived if it does.
After people have started to use active coping skills to manage their pain, they 

190	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
sometimes have a “honeymoon period” in which things aren’t so bad. At those times, 
pacing or the relaxation techniques may not be practiced as regularly. Then the pain may 
flare, and people get discouraged, thinking, “Well, this didn’t work either.” So they give up 
because they feel “it should be better by now.” There may be other barriers to continuing 
with these new skills: lack of encouragement from those around them, increased personal 
stress, increased pain, additional health problems, time constraints, or inconvenience. All 
of these problems have been addressed in this book, but change in behavior is a process 
of forward steps and periodic retreats. Our research found that people with chronic pain 
who completed the program and believed they could manage their pain experienced less 
depression, less pain, and were less disabled. Working with the materials in this book can 
help you become effective in managing your own pain. That includes anticipating the 
problems that might confront you and planning ahead now to cope with them.
Make a list of what might get in the way of your continuing with the skills you have 
learned in this book. List those on the “Problem” lines below. Then for each problem, 
consider how you could get yourself back on track. The skills you learned in setting 
achievable goals will help here.
Example:
Problem:  No one with whom to share the successes and difficulties of living with chronic 
pain.
Solution:  Join a support group; keep a diary of my experiences.
Problem:  More active now, so less time to practice skills.
Solution:  Schedule an appointment for practice time into my calendar.

Coping with Pain during a Flare-Up
When the pain flares up or a crisis occurs, you may forget some of what you have learned. 
It’s easy to slip into old habits when we are feeling out of control, even if these habits 
have not served us well in the past. For many people with chronic pain, pain flare-ups are 
inevitable and difficult.
In spite of this program’s emphasis on the chronic nature of pain, many people expect 

	
The End of the Beginning	
191
that things should be better and that pain will not get worse after their hard work. They 
are unhappy to find that this is not the case. The nature of chronic pain is complex; the 
normal course is for the pain to increase and decrease periodically. You may or may not 
be able to predict these fluctuations. Where you have control is in your response to the 
pain increase. You can limit your distress by applying the comfort measures discussed 
in this book to keep the pain at more tolerable levels. You can adjust your activities to 
reduce the discomfort you feel. Unless a disease or underlying process (nerve damage) 
has progressed, the great majority of chronic pain flare-ups are short-lived. They are just 
variations in the “volume control” of the pain system.
There are two ways to plan ahead for coping with pain flare-ups. The first is to plan 
for levels of increased pain. The second is to create a panic plan.
Coping with Increased Levels of Pain
To prepare for pain flare-ups, write down your coping plan for three pain levels: routine 
daily management, mild to moderate pain increases, and severe pain increases. Make a 
copy of this plan and give it to your health care professional. For example:
Daily Management
1.	 Medication: pregabalin 50 mg three times a day; amitriptyline 100 mg at bedtime
2.	Daily stretching; pool aerobics three times per week
3.	 Daily mindfulness practice
Mild to Moderate Pain Increase
1.	 Heat or ice for comfort
2.	Exercise as tolerated
3.	 Mindfulness practice, Technique 10
4.	 Watch the bird feeder activity
5.	 Call a friend
Severe Pain Increase
1.	 Reduce activities
2.	Watch a favorite movie (list)
3.	 Increase pregabalin to 100 mg three times a day over a week
4.	 Ice massage
5.	 Relaxation Technique 7, self-­hypnosis

192	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
6.	 If no change in a week or fever, chills, weakness, loss of function or new symp-
toms, see health care provider.
Now it’s your turn:
Daily Management
	
	
	
Mild to Moderate Pain Increase
	
	
	
Severe Pain Increase
	
	
	
Panic Plan
The second way to plan for pain flare-ups is to develop a “panic plan.” In other words, 
instead of panicking when pain increases, you can refer to a detailed master list of things 
for helping the mind, body, and spirit. To make the plan, take from the list of options, 
skills, and techniques you created in Chapter 9. In making your plan, be as specific as 
you can. The more specific, the easier it will be to follow. For example, if you say “Call a 
friend,” then add a detail such as “Mary Smith’s phone number is 888-0983.” Premark a 
section of passages in a spiritual book or a list of soothing music and where to find it, if 
that helps. Or if you say “Relax,” add more specific details on how to relax (for example, 
“Do breath focusing,” “Take a bath with lavender bath salts,” or “Watch my favorite 
sport on TV”).
Later, during a flare-up, you’ll be able to refer to this list and know exactly what to 
do without thinking. Creating the list is also a good way of reviewing the coping skills 
you have learned. Don’t limit your list to your new skills and techniques; also include 
older steps that worked to ease your discomfort, such as applying ice or heat and using 
medication.

Make copies of this list to carry with you, put on your refrigerator door, and/or keep 
in the glove compartment of your car. In other words, keep the list handy in various 
places for quick reference.
Now that you’ve completed your list, refer to the end of Chapter 1, where you were 
asked to write a similar list of things you did when the pain got worse. Do you find that 
things have changed?
A Celebration!
This program should end with a celebration. If you are in a group, poems can be read or 
exchanged, thank-yous expressed to other members, music played, and/or festive food 
shared.
If you are not in a group, take a moment and close your eyes. Imagine yourself in 
a room full of people. You realize that these people are strangers, but there is a sense 
of a common purpose and struggle. The room is vibrant with laughter, smells of food, 
and animated conversations—­conversations about the successful pacing of activities, 
who was assertive with whom, and recent pleasurable activities. Slowly, you realize that 

194	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
these people have just read the same book and worked with the same pain program you 
have been exploring. By your efforts and hard work, you have become part of a very 
large group of people who have chosen to take an active role in their pain management. 
Enjoy your celebration with your imaginary colleagues, or, alternatively, give yourself the 
opportunity to enjoy the glow of a job well done. Reward yourself by going out to dinner 
with a friend, treating yourself to a getaway weekend or vacation, buying yourself some 
flowers, or all of the above!
Here are five examples of poems or other materials shared by program participants; 
all speak to the struggles, the courage, and the triumphs of individuals in chronic pain. At 
the end of the chapter, space is provided for you to express your thoughts to your unseen 
colleagues. A special thanks to all of you for sharing your experience.

A Gift from the Wish List
The door to the elevator was being held open for me as I stepped in.
“Thanks,” I said before I realized it was he who provided the courtesy. Alone with 
just our reflections against the polished door, I felt I had to break the awkward silence.
“Excuse me, but don’t I . . . ”
“Bruce? Well I’ll be darned! How are you?”
“Oh, just fine,” I lied. “And you?”
I already knew the answer. I had seen him for the last two weeks in my chronic pain 
management course, but something had kept me from walking right up and saying hello. 
Maybe I wasn’t really sure it was him, it had been so long.
“God, let me look at you!” he said, yanking off my ever-­present cap.
“Hair’s looking pretty thin,” he chided.
“And you’ve put on a few pounds, I see,” I countered. “No wonder I didn’t recog-
nize you in class.”
The door opened at the ground floor, mercifully ending our mutual embarrassment 
at acting like strangers for the past two weeks.
“How long has it been?” I asked. “Can it have been fifteen years?”
“Almost twenty,” he corrected, staring off as if surprised by his answer himself.
We spent two or three minutes standing there in the lobby, reminiscing about the 
old days. We were inseparable back then. Raised hell together and shared our secrets 
with each other. Then came marriage, careers, family. We lost touch. We had fallen off 
our respective Christmas card “A” lists, replaced by coworkers, bosses, and in-laws.
But everyone has a “B” list, a wish list, comprised of the names of people who really 
matter in life—names you wish you could keep in your life if only you had. . . .
“The time!” I gasped, looking at my watch. “Look, I’ve really got to go. I promised 
my boy I’d . . . ”
“No problem,” he said. “I understand. I’ll be seeing you at class next week anyway.”
“Until next week, then. See ya.”
On the way home I realized how exhilarated I was at seeing my old friend, and that 
I didn’t want him to remain on my life’s “B” list.
I was able, with the help of my course instructor, to learn where he could be found. 
I looked him up the next day.
“It’s good to see you,” he said with surprise as he invited me into his living room. 
“Please, make yourself comfortable.”

196	
MANAGING PAIN BEFORE IT MANAGES YOU	
I felt kind of uneasy, as I’m sure he did, at this business of reacquainting ourselves. 
After a brief visit, I asked if I could drop by again soon.
“Anytime,” he said, with a sincerity reserved for a true friend.
I took him up on his standing invitation almost daily, and before long I realized how 
these visits somehow helped my pain. Just like my weekly visits to the pain management 
class did. Only soon the visits with my classmates would end. I will miss them terribly, 
but I will continue to see my friend. All I have to do is post the sign:
PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB 
I’M RELAXING PER MY DOCTOR’S ORDERS

Thief

Appendix A
Common Chronic Pain Conditions
Chapter 2 defines chronic pain in very broad terms as pain that lasts for more than 3 months. No 
matter what its causes may be, chronic pain has extensive biopsychosocial consequences. Thus 
the pain program presented in this book addresses body, mind, and social consequences of pain. 
I respect the power of the skills and attitudes presented in this book to assist an individual with 
managing symptoms. I also believe that patients deserve state-of-the-art medical evaluation and 
a treatment plan after establishing a diagnosis (a cause, real or theoretical), if at all possible. This 
could include specialty consultations with rheumatologists (arthritis doctors), orthopedists (bone 
doctors), neurologists (doctors of the nervous system), pain doctors (anesthesiologists, rheuma-
tologists, neurologists) and physiatrists (rehabilitation doctors). Remember that the first principle 
of pain management is to treat the underlying disorder whenever possible. Despite efforts to edu-
cate health care professionals and the public, there continues to be misunderstanding about how 
best to treat chronic pain syndromes. Therefore, I want to comment below on some of the most 
common and least understood pain syndromes. I have chosen these particular syndromes for one 
of four reasons:
1.	 They are frequently overlooked, and an earlier diagnosis might reduce unnecessary, even 
harmful treatments and the resulting psychological distress.
2.	 Certain aspects of their cause or treatment are not well known by health care profession-
als.
3.	 There are medical treatments, usually aimed at the abnormality contributing to the pain 
syndrome, that might help reduce the pain.
4.	 There are treatment regimens supported by new studies with high-­quality evidence, 
including randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
A Word about Evidence-Based Treatments
Over the past several decades there has been increasing awareness that many treatments have very 
little research evidence to support their use. Part of the problem lay in the enormous amounts of 
information that clinicians and consumers alike have had to wade through to find out what the 

200	
Appendix A: Common Chronic Pain Conditions	
research says. Multiple initiatives were undertaken to address this problem, and the Cochrane 
Collaboration, an international not-for-­profit organization, continues to be the repository for 
systematic reviews. It has provided a methodical way of organizing all the research around a 
treatment or intervention question—for example, “Does drug A treat disease B?” All the available 
research is reviewed for that question. Then, based on an orderly analysis of results, the follow-
ing conclusions are drawn: There is evidence to support using treatment A in disease B; there is 
no evidence that treatment A works; or more research needs to be done to prove effectiveness. 
Sometimes the conclusion is reached that the treatment is actually harmful.
These recommendations are based on the strength of evidence. Not all studies are equal. 
The strength of a study’s findings is based on how well the research is designed and conducted. 
Research conducted as an RCT tends to yield strong, higher-­quality evidence. Other factors in 
the research that determine its quality include having a large number of participants and a clearly 
defined set of measures to use in evaluating effectiveness of treatment. Studies designed this way 
are equipped to provide the most accurate testing of a treatment’s success or failure. A case study 
reporting that a treatment helped one person cannot predict if the next person will get the same 
results. However, case studies can be useful if a number of similar cases have the same result or 
if the result was positive in all the individuals. Case studies and other nonrandomized studies are 
used in developing treatment guidelines when RCTs are not available. Unfortunately, most stud-
ies investigating chronic pain are not well designed and give inconclusive results. This is made 
more challenging by having no objective measure of the pain experience, which is complex and 
multifactorial by definition. Yet we must proceed with the best evidence available in diagnosing 
and making our recommendations.
Fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome that affects primarily women (the ratio of women to 
men with fibromyalgia is 10 to 1). It is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, abnor-
mal pain processing, in addition to sleep disruption, fatigue, and memory issues. Encouraging 
progress continues to be made in our understanding of this pain syndrome. We know that fibro-
myalgia is one of many central pain syndromes associated with alterations in the processing of 
pain in the brain and spinal cord, and that after developing it, individuals have an abnormal or 
heightened perception of pain from normally nonpainful stimuli.
Many terms are used to describe this syndrome, and overlap among several of the terms sug-
gests that they are points along a symptom continuum. These terms include “fibrositis,” “myo-
fascial pain,” “postviral fatigue syndrome,” “chronic fatigue syndrome,” “tension myalgia,” and 
“generalized tendomyopathy.” In 2010, the American College of Rheumatology (see Wolfe et al. 
in the Bibliography) updated the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia. A person satis-
fies diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia if the following three conditions are met:
1.	 The Widespread Pain Index (WPI) score is greater than or equal to 7 and the Symptom 
Severity (SS) score is greater than or equal to 5, or the WPI score equals 3–6 but the SS 
score is greater than or equal to 9. The WPI is comprised of the total number of body 

	
Appendix A: Common Chronic Pain Conditions	
201
areas (up to 19) involved with pain, for example, pain in the abdomen, upper back, left 
upper arm, and right upper arm would give a WPI score of 4. SS measures severity of three 
common symptoms—­fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms, on a scale 
of 0 (no problem) to 3 (severe: pervasive, continuous, life-­disturbing problem), plus the 
presence or absence of generalized symptoms (for example, painful urination, dizziness, 
muscle aches) on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (a great deal of symptoms).
2.	 Symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months.
3.	 The person does not have a disorder that would otherwise explain the pain.
We may eventually discover that the symptoms we group under the broad diagnosis called 
“fibromyalgia” are really multiple and diverse disorders. Many patients with fibromyalgia have 
associated complaints, such as sleep disturbance, headache, irritable bowel, irritable bladder, 
temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, chronic fatigue, painful menstrual periods, intermittent 
blurred vision, and short-term memory problems. Depending on the intensity of the present-
ing symptoms, individuals with fibromyalgia may consult a gastroenterologist for irritable bowel 
symptoms and a dentist for TMJ pain, making the diagnosis all the more confusing. The presence 
of a second clinical disorder does not exclude the diagnosis of fibromyalgia, but the diagnosis is 
often made after other diseases have been excluded (thyroid disease, Lyme disease, lupus, rheu-
matoid arthritis, etc.).
The symptoms are quite variable and are marked by an intermittent, waxing–waning, and 
migratory pattern. This variability contributes to the long time lag between development of symp-
toms and diagnosis. The cause is unknown and is most likely the result of multiple factors. There 
is increasing evidence that supports a genetic predisposition, given that first-­degree relatives have 
as much as an eightfold greater risk of developing fibromyalgia, compared with the general popu-
lation. There are a number of environmental factors that are associated with the onset of symp-
toms, such as Lyme disease, Epstein–Barr virus infection, physical trauma, and emotional stress. 
These conditions may combine to trigger abnormal pain and sensory processing responses in the 
central nervous system. The two most consistent complaints besides pain are sleep disturbance 
and depression. It has been observed that the presence of depression does not appear to influence 
the sensory processing problems reported by individuals with fibromyalgia; however, catastro-
phizing—a thinking style associated with rumination, magnification, and helplessness—does. 
Therapies directed at improved sleep and depression can be helpful but not curative.
Treatment to date has focused on symptoms such as sleep disturbance, pain, and fatigue. 
There is evidence demonstrating the benefit of the old tricyclic antidepressants (particularly ami-
triptyline, off-label) in treating these fibromyalgia symptoms, presumably because of their ability 
to increase norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. These chemicals are thought to be involved 
in pain modulation. Newer antidepressants, such as duloxetine (Cymbalta®) and milnacipran 
(Savella®), are approved for fibromyalgia treatment. Antiseizure medications mentioned in Chapter 
2 have also been used in fibromyalgia. Pregabalin (Lyrica®), an antiseizure medication that binds 
to brain receptors, has FDA approval for use in fibromyalgia and has evidence to support a mean-
ingful reduction in pain (see Andrew Moore, Phillip Wiffen, and Eija Kalso in “Supplementary 
Reading” at the end of this appendix). In an RCT reported in the Archives of Internal Medicine 

202	
Appendix A: Common Chronic Pain Conditions	
(see Rooks et al. in “Supplementary Reading”), progressive walking with simple strength-­training 
and stretching exercises was found to be beneficial for patients with fibromyalgia in a number of 
ways. Combining these physical programs with patient education and self-­management provided 
symptom, social, and cognitive benefits. This study adds to the existing evidence in the Cochrane 
Database of Systematic Reviews that supports physical activities or a multidisciplinary approach 
to the treatment of fibromyalgia pain. A 2013 review of pharmacological and nonpharmacologi-
cal therapies for the treatment of fibromyalgia proposed that the best results might occur with the 
use of pregabalin or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) as part of a multicomponent 
therapy that includes aerobic exercise and cognitive-­behavioral therapy.
There are inconsistent research results on the use of acupuncture in fibromyalgia. In several 
instances increased pain was noted, possibly reflecting the variability in causal factors such as 
genetics and sensory processing in the central nervous system.
In 2005, the American Pain Society released guidelines for managing fibromyalgia syn-
drome pain in adults and children. Based on a synthesis of all the evidence available at that time, 
the guidelines stated that the use of medications, physical exercise, relaxation techniques, and 
cognitive-­behavioral therapies was associated with improvements in pain, other fibromyalgia-­
related symptoms, functioning, and depression. Such a complex problem will not be improved 
without addressing mind, body, and spirit.
Many communities have support groups for people with fibromyalgia, and your state’s 
Arthritis Foundation may sponsor such groups in your locale. Information about these activities, 
as well as about fibromyalgia syndrome, can be obtained through your state chapter of the Arthri-
tis Foundation. There are now multiple resources for information, support, and research opportu-
nities related to fibromyalgia. The Fibromyalgia Network makes a good effort to report the latest 
developments and advocates for more research funding. Another resource for information and 
support since 1997 has been the National Fibromyalgia Association. WebMD has an online sup-
port group for patients with chronic disease, including fibromyalgia. Another excellent resource 
is FibroGuide, an online tutorial for skills, information, and education specific to fibromyalgia. 
Contact information for these organizations as well as other helpful links for those experiencing 
fibromyalgia, or for specific symptoms, are provided in Appendix E, “Electronic Resources.”
Chronic Neck and Low Back Pain
Chronic pain in the neck or low back can be very challenging to treat. This is particularly so if no 
structural abnormalities are found, such as a herniated disc, a tumor (a common fear), or signifi-
cant bony abnormalities of the spine (arthritis with or without clear nerve pinching or fractures). 
In August 2010, a review in the International Association for the Study of Pain’s journal Pain: 
Clinical Updates discussed potential frameworks for understanding the presence of persistent low 
back pain, without leg pain. The issue was whether the pain was a result of injury and degenera-
tive structural changes or alterations in the nervous system in pain processing. The conclusion 
was that the pain may be an expression of either model and that making the distinction between 
the two necessitates diagnostic tools that are not available yet or available only in the research lab. 
This can make the diagnosis and the solution very challenging to achieve in some cases. Unless 

	
Appendix A: Common Chronic Pain Conditions	
203
loss of function has occurred, efforts at prevention are recommended before proceeding to any 
surgery, for example, maintaining a normal weight and exercising. After a thorough evaluation 
by a specialist, conservative therapy is then typically recommended, such as physical therapy, 
chiropractic care, or interventional procedures.
Repeated low back surgeries may be tempting if the condition fails to resolve after the first 
one. However, the likelihood of resolution with surgery is low unless some structural abnormality 
can be determined. This fact has caused many surgeons to recommend conservative or nonsurgi-
cal treatment if only pain is present. More effective treatments should be developed as techniques 
improve for assessing dynamic (in motion) structural spine abnormalities and for distinguishing 
pain that originates from the different structures of the spine (facets, discs, nerve roots, ligaments, 
and muscles). Better study designs are crucial to discovering the best approaches to a commonly 
experienced problem.
The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT), a collaborative RCT, has provided 
answers to questions about which interventions, such as surgical treatment, are effective for 
which back conditions. This information is particularly important because of the potential nega-
tive long-term effects (including chronic pain) of having back surgery. These questions had not 
been studied in any systematic way in the past. Two studies were reported in 2006 and 2007. 
One concerned cases of degenerative spondylolisthesis (slipping of one lumbar vertebra on top of 
another) with spinal stenosis (narrowing of spinal canal), a condition that affects women six times 
more than men and is especially prevalent among African American women. The study found that 
surgery was twice as effective as nonsurgical approaches in reducing pain and restoring function 
for patients. The second study looked at cases of lumbar disc herniation with sciatica (pain down 
the leg). Both surgical and nonsurgical interventions were associated with improvements by 2 
years. Although surgery may have had additional short-term benefits, the differences were not 
statistically significant.
The British Journal of Medicine summarized the evidence for a variety of interventions used 
for chronic back pain: A beneficial designation was given to back exercises; a likely to be benefi-
cial designation was given to fusion surgery, behavioral therapy, acupuncture, massage, intensive 
multidisciplinary programs, and spinal manipulative therapy; a trade-off between benefits and 
harms designation was given for nonsteroidal anti-­inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and muscle 
relaxants; an unknown effectiveness designation was given to intradiscal electrothermal therapy, 
radiofrequency denervation, artificial disc replacement, analgesics (acetaminophen, opioids), facet 
joint injections, local injections, lumbar supports, TENS units, antidepressants, back schools, and 
electromyographic biofeedback. A 2014 systematic review of using epidural steroids for low back 
pain reported short-term efficacy when well-­selected patients had it done under fluoroscopy by a 
trained clinician. A 2013 article in Pain identified weak evidence supporting the use of spinal cord 
stimulation (a device is implanted that sends electrical signals to the spinal cord to override pain 
signals) for “failed back syndrome” in carefully selected individuals.
There have not been a sufficient number of well-­designed studies on chronic neck pain treat-
ments to make clear recommendations for what is effective. The Cochrane Database of System-
atic Reviews reports the following results for neck pain interventions: little evidence supporting 
multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation; short-term relief using massage; short-term relief 
from radiofrequency denervation of facet joints; limited evidence and unclear benefits for muscle

relaxants, analgesics, and NSAIDs; moderate evidence that saline injections are as effective as 
botulism toxin; short-term relief of neck pain and long-term relief of headaches caused by neck 
pain from stretching and strengthening exercises.
The bottom line is that pain and what makes it better are very individual, so that many times 
a sequential trial of therapies needs to be carried out. Keeping a Pain Diary at that time can be 
helpful in monitoring what works. Those therapies that give some short-term relief may be more 
beneficial when flare-ups occur in chronic pain.
Headaches
Headaches are a very common and disabling problem. Fortunately, most headache syndromes are 
intermittent. As in the case of back pain, multiple factors are possible as triggers, although there 
have been considerable advances in the understanding of headache causes. The old distinction 
between migraines (as vascular) and tension-type headaches (as muscular) is gone. It is believed 
that most primary headache disorders, such as migraines, cluster headaches, and daily tension-
type headaches, come from disturbances in the central nervous system and represent different 
presentations along a continuum. If you are experiencing chronic daily headaches or difficult-
to-­control, intermittent migraine headaches, I would strongly recommend that you seek assis-
tance from a headache specialist, usually a neurologist with an interest and expertise in headache 
management. There are medications that can abort headaches or reduce their severity. Evidence 
suggests that treating a migraine when it is mild produces a more complete and effective response 
than waiting until the headache becomes moderate to severe. A number of -triptan medications 
(for example, rizatriptan or sumatriptan) are available for aborting or alleviating symptoms of 
migraines. If frequent migraines are a problem, there are also effective medication regimens to 
prevent them from occurring so regularly, called “prophylaxis treatment.” Chronic daily head-
aches are also receiving more attention. A number of therapies have been found to reduce the inci-
dence of daily headaches, and contributing behaviors have been identified as well. Avoid medica-
tion overuse, such as taking daily butalbital (for example, Fiorinal®) with aspirin, acetaminophen, 
caffeine, codeine, or over-the-­counter medications for headaches. Medication overuse can cause 
rebound headaches; reducing overuse can reduce the chances of rebound headaches developing.
There are several steps you can take to help you now or in preparation for your visit to a spe-
cialist. Keep a Headache Diary noting frequency and pain quality. Like the general Pain Diary, it 
will help you recognize patterns and triggers. Most effective headache treatments are categorized 
into prophylaxis (prevention), mild to moderate headache treatment, and severe headache treat-
ment. If your headache Pain Diary shows regular use of caffeine or daily use of acetaminophen, 
Fiorecet®, Fiorinal®, Esgic®, or other pain medications, then a large component of your headaches 
may be caused by a rebound effect. If so, you need to slowly decrease the daily doses of such 
medication, particularly if using Fiorecet®, Fiorinal®, or Esgic®, since these medications contain 
barbiturate-like components that may be habit forming. They may also cause seizures if suddenly 
stopped when daily doses are significant. If you have any questions or concerns, consult with your 
prescribing physician or pharmacist. You should either limit your use of these medications to 1 
or 2 days per week or not use them at all. Avoid long fasting periods during the day; this can help

people prone to low blood sugar. Skipping meals is often associated with headaches in susceptible 
individuals. Keep a food and beverage diary. Note any association of headache with use of artifi-
cial sweeteners or alcoholic beverages. Finally, constipation may also be associated with chronic 
daily headaches. Increasing fluids, dietary fiber, exercise, and judicious use of stool softeners may 
help. More aggressive bowel regimens may be necessary for those using opioids (narcotics). Ask 
your health care professional for assistance.
When I see patients with complaints of daily headaches, I frequently find that they are suf-
fering from muscle tension or spasm of their neck muscles. Variations on this theme are patients 
with TMJ strain caused by clenching or grinding of teeth, who typically have morning headaches; 
a night guard for the teeth may help in such cases. Therapy directed at strengthening the upper 
extremities and maintaining good posturing of the head, neck, and upper back are extremely 
valuable, sometimes eliminating the problem altogether. If you experience increased headaches 
after exercising your upper extremities, you should take special care. You are probably using 
muscles incorrectly because of weakness and straining; see your health care practitioner for evalu-
ation and then get exercise supervision at the beginning of your exercise routine.
The National Headache Foundation is an active advocacy group and resource for headache 
sufferers. (See Appendix E, “Electronic Resources.”)
Interstitial Cystitis
Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a disease of the bladder that can be 
associated with stretch-­induced hemorrhaging of the bladder wall. There are three key symptoms: 
increased frequency of urination (both day and night), pelvic pain, and increased urgency of 
urination. Although the symptoms of a chronic urinary tract infection are reported, the urine is 
negative for infection. Patients may also complain of TMJ pain and pelvic pain. The condition 
is seen primarily in women. The exact cause is unknown, but abnormalities in the regulation of 
the inflammatory response have been implicated (see Schrepf et al. in “Supplementary Reading”), 
as well as abnormalities in antiproliferative factor (APF) and certain growth factors function-
ing as markers for IC/PBS. There is also the potential for genetic contributions. Women may be 
treated for months to years for urinary tract infections before IC/PBS is diagnosed. The diagnosis 
is usually made by passing a scope into the bladder (cystoscopy), looking at the bladder wall for 
microhemorrhages, and taking a sample of tissue (biopsy). Although treatment is available, it does 
not always resolve or help the symptoms. A special type of study, called a “systematic review,” 
examined the more than 180 different types of therapy reported for IC/PBS from 1987 to 2006 
(see Dimitrakov et al. in “Supplementary Reading”). Because of poor study designs in most of 
the research trials examined, only the studies for pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron®) could 
be analyzed sufficiently. They found that Elmiron® may be modestly beneficial for relief of IC/
PBS symptoms. Bladder instillation with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and amitriptyline orally 
were two other treatments that have been used for IC/PBS specifically or chronic pain in general 
and were also felt to show some efficacy. There are national and local organizations to support 
individuals with this condition and to keep them informed as to the latest research and treat-
ment developments. If you have been diagnosed or have the symptoms listed above, I strongly 

206

recommend identifying a urologist or specialist who is familiar and comfortable with treating 
IC/PBS. The Interstitial Cystitis Association (see Appendix E, “Electronic Resources”) is a very 
proactive organization that provides the names of health care professionals closest to you with 
interest or expertise in IC/PBS as well as extensive education, information, and promotion of 
research into a cure.
Endometriosis and Vulvodynia
Endometriosis is present in 15–40% of women undergoing laparoscopy for pelvic pain. There is 
no correlation between the site or amount of disease and the presence of pain. Endometriosis is a 
disorder in women involving the appearance of uterine tissue (endometrium) outside the uterine 
cavity (womb). We do not know why the tissue becomes embedded in areas outside the uterus. 
The pain in endometriosis is thought to be the result of the microhemorrhages that occur with 
the monthly menstrual cycle and the resultant inflammation of surrounding tissue. However, the 
number of abnormal tissue implants does not correlate with the amount, intensity, or frequency 
of the pelvic pain. There are most likely several mechanisms for pain production (for example, 
immune complexes that trigger inflammation and sensitization of pain pathways in an internal 
organ similar to that occurring in neuropathy). Treatments may vary from birth control pills 
to testosterone-like medications to hysterectomy with removal of ovaries to the use of estrogen 
receptor blockers since estrogen drives this disease. Such hormonal manipulations may be quite 
successful. There are cases in which endometrial lesions may persist in spite of removal of the 
ovaries and in which pain persists after removal of both the uterus and ovaries. Repeated surger-
ies to cut and remove adhesions (internal scar tissue) rarely provide long-term relief, except when 
they are extensive or associated with bowel obstruction. There are national and local patient 
support groups and information resources for endometriosis. Resources and support are available 
through the Endometriosis Association or the Endometriosis Research Center (see Appendix E, 
“Electronic Resources,” for contact information for both).
Vulvodynia is defined by chronic pain of the vulvar area (external female genitalia) in a 
local or more general distribution, in the absence of a skin disease, although the skin may look 
red. It often occurs in the context of other pain disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and 
fibromyalgia. It may occur intermittently or become a constant awareness of burning, rawness, 
or itching. There has been some suggestion of potential genetic predisposition to the develop-
ment of localized vulvodynia based on three mechanisms: risks for recurrent infection in the 
vulvovaginal area with candidiasis, altered inflammatory response, and increased sensitivity to  
pain.
Sexual intercourse may be painful or impossible. Increased muscle tone of the pelvic floor 
and vagina is treated with specialized biofeedback therapy meant to relax the muscles. Treat-
ment, such as wearing cotton underwear and avoiding soaps, fragrances, and douching that may 
irritate the tissue further, is directed at symptoms and prevention of more irritation. Application 
of cold packs and, for some, heat may be helpful. Using a water-based emollient for lubrication 
during sex is recommended. Cleansing the vulvar area with plain water and sitting in tepid water 
for short periods can also give some symptom relief. Anesthetic ointment and estrogen creams 

	
Appendix A: Common Chronic Pain Conditions	
207
have been applied as well as compounded ointments with amitriptyline, anesthetic ointment, and 
estrogen mixed together. As in many chronic pain conditions that are proposed to have some cen-
tral nervous system aberrancy, tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants may be helpful. Psy-
chosocial support is recommended. The National Vulvodynia Association is available for support, 
information, and education, and it advocates for further research of the condition. See Appendix 
E, “Electronic Resources,” for their website address.
Neuropathies
In 2010, the International Association of Pain presented a new definition of neuropathy based on 
a consensus of researchers and clinicians specializing in neurology, the study of the brain and ner-
vous system. They defined neuropathy as pain caused by a lesion or disease of the body’s sensory 
nervous system. In other words, neuropathy is defined as damage to the sensory nerve pathways. 
Some of the most promising therapies to date have emerged in the treatment of neuropathic pain 
caused by disease or lesions of the peripheral sensory nerves. The three conditions discussed in 
the following three sections are notable for their intense, burning pain, although itching, numb-
ness, or stabbing pain can also be experienced. It is critical to have a thorough evaluation by a 
neurologist or nerve pain specialist, as there are many causes of nerve pain, including toxin expo-
sure (alcohol, arsenic, lead), metabolic and inflammatory diseases (diabetes mellitus and rheuma-
toid arthritis), nutritional problems (vitamin deficiencies), infections (postherpetic neuralgia), and 
paraneoplastic syndromes (cancers associated with peripheral sensory nerve pain). If the underly-
ing disease can be identified early and treated, there is a possibility that a delay in progression of 
the neuropathy can be achieved.
Small-Fiber Neuropathy
Small-fiber neuropathy is of increasing interest because of small sensory nerve fiber involvement 
in nerve pain syndromes associated with diseases such as diabetes, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, hepa-
titis C, HIV infection, and celiac disease. The slow, unmyelinated sensory C fibers (described in 
Chapter 2) are involved in carrying pain messages to the spinal cord. Recent studies suggest a 
subpopulation of fibromyalgia patients may, in fact, have small-fiber neuropathy. Researchers 
have encouraged investigation of the causes of pain in patients with fibromyalia complaining of 
widespread pain with burning and numbness, particularly in the feet.
Small-fiber neuropathy is difficult to diagnose, requiring special sensory testing called “quan-
titative sudomotor axon reflex test” (QSART, for short) and biopsy of the skin where the sensory 
nerves are located. Treatments of the neuropathy are similar to those discussed next for posther-
petic neuralgia.
Postherpetic Neuralgia
Shingles and postherpetic neuralgia are caused by the same virus that causes chicken pox or 
herpes zoster. The virus can infect any peripheral nerve during the recovery period from chicken 

208	
Appendix A: Common Chronic Pain Conditions	
pox and then lie dormant for decades, only to emerge as a painful skin rash. It is important to rec-
ognize its presence early because shingles can best be treated, and a chronic painful neuropathy 
perhaps prevented, if antivirals (acyclovir, famciclovir) are taken within the first 72 hours of the 
outbreak. The outbreak of herpes zoster is associated with a heightened sensation (hyperalgesia) 
manifested as painful itching or increased skin sensitivity to light touch from normally nonirritat-
ing stimuli (allodynia). This is followed by a small blistery rash that becomes crusted and weepy 
over the course of about 2 weeks. It may be associated with fever and flu-like symptoms. In indi-
viduals over 65 years of age, there is a higher likelihood of developing nerve pain that lasts long 
after the rash has gone, a condition called “postherpetic neuralgia” (PHN). Involvement of the 
first branch of the trigeminal nerve, the sensory nerve of the face, carries the highest risk for devel-
opment of prolonged postshingles pain with thoracic shingles in second place. Early intervention 
with tricyclic antidepressants and antiseizure medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin may 
prevent the “wind-up” of the sensory system in the spinal cord that is thought to contribute to the 
pain becoming persistent and chronic.
If chronic pain develops from shingles (PHN), it can help to use the same antiseizure medica-
tions just mentioned (pregabalin or gabapentin), the antidepressants amitriptyline, if tolerated, or 
duloxetine to calm abnormal nerve firing. Another potentially effective treatment is to apply Zos-
trix® to the painful skin five times a day after the rash has healed. Follow the instructions in the 
box. Zostrix® is an over-the-­counter cream made from capsaicin, the substance that makes hot 
peppers hot. Even though it is available without a prescription, consult your health care provider 
to confirm the diagnosis. Some people experience intense burning upon applying the cream, but 
after multiple doses this gradually decreases. There is also a high dose capsaicin (8% capsaicin, 
Qutenza®) that requires special application by a clinician. The efficacy of applying a 5% Lido-
derm® patch to the involved skin after the rash is gone is small. The patch is applied for 12 hours 
at a time and then removed for 12 hours.
The best “treatment” is prevention. A vaccine (Zostavax®) can help decrease the occurrence 
of shingles in older people. Recently a second dose of the shingles vaccine has been recommended 
to increase resistance to the occurrence of shingles. This, plus the ongoing vaccination (Varivax®) 
of children to prevent chicken pox, may make shingles and postherpetic neuralgia diseases of the 
past.
Painful Diabetic Neuropathy
Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of painful neuropathy, in addition to causing a neu-
ropathy characterized by numbness in the hands and feet. The risk for developing this painful 
condition is associated with increasing age, number of years diagnosed with diabetes, and poor 
control of blood sugar, as determined by HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin) levels. There are a 
number of medications used for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. First-line treatment agents 
have more than two RCTs to support their use in diabetes. They are duloxetine (Cymbalta®), 
pregabalin (Lyrica®), and a tricyclic antidepressant (amitriptyline). Second-line treatment agents 
with evidence based on one or more RCTs in the treatment of diabetes or other neuropathies are 
gabapentin (Neurontin®) and carbamazepine. If pain is severe the long-­acting opioid oxycodone 
and opioid-like tramadol are thought to be beneficial.

	
Appendix A: Common Chronic Pain Conditions	
209
Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), Type I
CRPS, Type I, is a condition marked by spontaneous pain that may be abnormally triggered 
(allodynia) or heightened (hyperalgesia) and is characterized by the “CRPS triad” of autonomic, 
motor, and sensory abnormalities. Historically, it has also been called “reflex sympathetic dys-
trophy,” “Sudeck’s dystrophy,” or “hand/shoulder syndrome.” The pain, which can develop after 
major or minor trauma to the extremities, is not limited to a single peripheral nerve and is often 
disproportionate to the inciting event; that is, severe pain might develop after a minor injury 
like an ankle sprain or prolonged casting of a limb. The underlying cause of CRPS, Type I, is 
unknown, but the condition can involve manifestations of the autonomic nervous system such 
as sweating, swelling, and changes in circulation, or not, in the pain process. The condition is 
marked by severe pain (hyperalgesia) even with light touch (allodynia), and motor weakness, 
tremor, and decreased range of motion are also seen. CRPS, Type I, is a very complicated syn-
drome and needs to be treated by pain specialists or, at a minimum, a professional familiar with 
the diagnosis. I mention it here so that if you have these symptoms but have not been diagnosed 
as yet, you can bring this description to the attention of your health care professional or to any-
one you know who might have these symptoms. Multidisciplinary treatment must be done in a 
coordinated fashion for best results. Treatment may involve nerve blocks aimed at blocking the 
sympathetic nervous system. Best results are obtained if diagnosis and treatment are done early in 
the development of the pain syndrome. There is no evidence that surgical sympathetic neurolysis 
(permanent destruction of the nerve to the involved limb) is beneficial, but there is evidence that 
spinal cord stimulation from an implanted stimulator may be beneficial. Medications used to 
help treat symptoms related to this condition are blood pressure pills (such as alpha-­adrenergic 
blockers), antiseizure medications (such as gabapentin and pregabalin—off-label), and tricyclic 
antidepressants (such as amitriptyline and desipramine). Although most medications show some 
efficacy in the short term, only bisphosphonates (for example, IV Fosamax®) in the early stages of 
CRPS 1, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) analogs (ketamine), and vasodilators (calcium channel 
blockers) showed better long-term pain reduction than placebo. A short course of calcitonin in 
later stages may be beneficial for deep bone pain as well. Physical therapy, use of contrast baths, 
and desensitization of the painful limb are used to help maintain function. The scientific advisory 
board of the Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Association (see Appendix E, “Electronic 
Resources”) includes the top professionals working on the disorder and has excellent resources 
for professionals and patients.
All chronic pain sufferers deserve treatment that addresses the needs of the whole person. But 
especially in neuropathies and CRPS Type I, diagnosis of underlying disorders and early interven-
tion may decrease progression and reduce pain intensity.

Complementary Alternative Medicine
The term “complementary alternative medicine” (CAM) has been used to refer to anything out-
side of the traditionally Western high-tech, pharmaceutically based medical system. According to 
the definition offered on the website of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative 
Medicine (www.nccam.nih/health/whatiscam), “CAM is a group of diverse medical and health 
care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional 
medicine.” A further distinction is made between complementary medicine, which is used along 
with traditional medical therapies, and alternative medicine, used in place of traditional medicine.
There has been considerable confusion about what works, how, and when to use such thera-
pies. The research on these therapies continues to be of limited use because of poor study design, 
but there have been efforts to improve the quality. This entire workbook could be called a “com-
plementary” approach to pain management because it is based on many of the therapies consid-
ered to be CAM therapies, such as mind–body therapy, relaxation and mindfulness techniques, 
and self-help therapies. The power of such therapies is the healing they can promote: healing in 
the sense of finding comfort, joy, and purpose in living with a problem such as chronic pain.
There are additional CAM therapies that are similar to Western medical therapies, such as 
acupuncture and drug treatments in the form of biological agents and herbs. These additional 
therapies may reduce symptoms, though they do not cure the underlying disease.
Acupuncture
Research reviewed by the Cochrane Collaboration has concluded that acupuncture may provide a 
modest reduction in pain of the neck and low back, pelvic pain during pregnancy, and short-term 
benefit for shoulder pain and headache. It may give some benefit in pain reduction in chronic low 
back pain over no treatment.
Traditional acupuncture involves the insertion of slender needles into specific points on the 
body. The needles may be heated with an herb (a process called “moxibustion”) or electrified. The 
rationale for point selection is based on numerous interpretations, and you may find an acupunc-
turist who describes his or her therapy in terms of nationality (for example, Chinese, Japanese, 
French, or Korean) or energy system (five elements, Qi [chi]). Many people find that acupuncture 
reduces tension and pain flare-ups and increases energy.
Treatment by a licensed or certified acupuncturist may assist you with symptom control. 

	
Appendix B: Complementary Alternative Medicine	
213
Many acupuncturists use disposable needles to reduce risk of infection. In general, some improve-
ment in symptoms would be expected after 8 to 12 treatment sessions.
The website of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (see Appen-
dix E, “Electronic Resources”) is an excellent resource for accurate information on acupuncture 
and for the latest results of research trials.
Biological Agents
Biological agents are similar to those that are already synthesized in the body. The ones discussed 
here are glucosamine, chondroitin 4-sulfate, and SAMe. Although these agents have been pro-
moted for treatment of pain, none has yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA). This means that the optimum dosage for therapeutic effectiveness has not been 
fully researched. As a result, the preparations vary widely in the amount of active ingredient they 
contain, and long-term side effects (in years) are unknown. It is important to discuss your use of 
over-the-­counter supplements with your health care provider to make sure they are safe for you.
Glucosamine and Chondroitin 4-Sulfate
Glucosamine
Glucosamine sulfate is derived from chitin (the shells of shrimp, lobster, or crab) or synthe-
sized. Evidence exists that glucosamine sulfate can decrease osteoarthritis pain and may stimulate 
cartilage production. The most frequently used oral dosage is 500 mg three times a day for at least 
2 months. Side effects are rare and usually involve nausea or indigestion.
Chondroitin 4-Sulfate
Chondroitin 4-sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan, a component of cartilage. Supplements are 
derived from the cartilage of cattle or sharks. Evidence exists that chondroitin 4-sulfate taken 
at doses of 400 mg three times a day for 2 or 3 months can decrease pain in osteoarthritis. Side 
effects are rare and usually involve nausea or indigestion. Chondroitin 4-sulfate is structurally 
similar to blood thinners. Caution: If you are taking prescribed blood thinners, check with your 
doctor before taking this. Many supplement preparations contain both glucosamine and chon-
droitin 4-sulfate.
The Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT) study, published in the 
New England Journal of Medicine (see Clegg et al., in “Supplementary Reading”), found that, in 
general, patients treated with glucosamine and chondroitin 4-sulfate did not achieve relief from 
osteoarthritis pain of the knee. An exception was seen in a small subgroup of patients with mod-
erate to severe pain who did show significant relief with the combined supplements. After an addi-
tional 18 months, the study next assessed whether there were reductions in disease progression, 
determined by X-rays of the knees, as a result of separate glucosamine or chondroitin 4-sulfate

treatment or combined treatment. No significant slowing of the loss of cartilage in osteoarthritis 
of the knee was found.
SAMe
The scientific evidence supports some benefit over no treatment in the use of SAMe for pain reduc-
tion in osteoarthritis of the knee and hip.
SAMe, or S-adenosylmethionine, is a naturally occurring compound synthesized from the 
amino acid l-methionine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It plays a role in various metabolic 
processes and is possibly both anti-­inflammatory and cartilage protective. It has also been thought 
to have a mild antidepressant effect. Several RCTs have demonstrated pain reductions equivalent 
to those of anti-­inflammatory drugs for up to 2 years with continued benefit in patients with 
osteoarthritis. The typical dose is between 600 mg and 1200 mg a day. Coated pills are thought 
to be less prone to deterioration during storage. SAMe may increase bleeding risk, especially if 
other drugs which increase bleeding risk are taken together with it. SAMe may also alter blood 
pressure, lower blood sugar, or interact with agents that affect the nervous system.
Herbal Remedies
Because of their widespread availability, millions of people have embraced self-­medication with 
herbs in multiple preparations, from teas to capsules. Although most preparations are probably 
safe, some herbal compounds, such as those containing ephedra, an adrenaline-like substance, 
have been associated with illness and death. The active therapeutic ingredients in herbal prepa-
rations are like drugs. Many of our current medications had their origin in compounds isolated 
from plants (for example, digitalis from the foxglove plant, salicylic acid [or aspirin] from willow 
bark, and dronabinol from marijuana).
Some of the more popular herbs used by patients in chronic pain include marijuana, St. 
John’s wort (for mild depression), valerian (for sleep), cayenne pepper (used externally, for anti-­
inflammatory effect), ginger (for inflammation and pain relief), and feverfew (for migraines). 
Kava kava has been used for sleep disorders but has been associated with severe liver damage 
and is not recommended. St. John’s wort has been shown to interact with multiple medications, 
decreasing plasma levels of certain drugs, for example, theophylline and digoxin. In addition, 
using St. John’s wort with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant (such as 
Prozac®, Paxil®) may increase the likelihood of experiencing “serotonin syndrome,” marked by 
agitation, confusion, seizures, and tremor. It is recommended that you discuss the use of supple-
mental herbal remedies with your health care provider.
Several resources that can be used to explore the recommended use and effects of a variety 
of herbal substances are included in “Supplementary Reading.” The National Center for Comple-
mentary and Alternative Medicine (www.nccam.nih.gov) provides the most up-to-date evidence 
on therapeutic efficacy. Currently there is considerable variation in the amounts of active ingre-
dients in herbal preparations. It is hoped that the FDA will soon implement standards for these 
herbal products so that patients may know the safety and potency of available herbal preparations.

Massage
Many techniques fall into the category of massage therapy—for example, Swedish massage, acu-
pressure, lymphatic massage, and reflexology. In these techniques manual pressure is applied to 
areas of the body to release tension in muscles, to prescribed points that are representative of 
body parts (foot/hand reflexology), or to acupuncture points (Shiatsu, Do’in, acupressure). Many 
people, with or without chronic pain, find that massage can help them release tension, treat 
flare-ups, or just relax. Some patients with fibromyalgia can only tolerate light touch, so it may 
be important to find a therapist with experience in treating patients with chronic pain and to use 
your communication skills for treatment feedback.
Meditation
In 2014, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reported a systematic review 
of RCTs on the effects of meditation programs on affect, attention, and health-­related behaviors 
affected by stress, pain, and weight among people with a medical or psychiatric condition. The 
review found moderate evidence that mindfulness meditation programs were beneficial for reduc-
ing anxiety, depression, and pain severity and low evidence that they may improve any dimension 
of negative affect when compared with nonspecific, inactive controls such as wait lists or usual 
care. When meditative studies were compared with specific therapies such as yoga, progressive 
muscle relaxation, cognitive therapy, exercise, and medications, the results were inconsistent and 
there was little evidence that meditative therapies were better than therapeutic controls. Once 
again, the complexity and poor study designs of most research make it difficult to draw objective 
conclusions. Finding an appropriate control, determining a standard for meditative practices, and 
measuring the desired meditative state all make this research challenging to perform.
Energy Therapies
Therapeutic touch, reiki, qi gong, and polarity therapy are all techniques based on alleged manip-
ulation of energy fields. Although there has been little to no evidence that these therapies do more 
than help people deeply relax, many patients find the treatments comforting and helpful in reliev-
ing fatigue, anxiety, and tension. Practitioners of these therapies may also teach their clients to 
reproduce the effects on their own, which can add to a person’s perceived pain coping resources.

Working Comfortably at a Computer
Nancy L. Josephson
Many patients who participate in the pain program work in offices and use computers on a daily 
basis. If you are one of these patients, correctly setting up your computer work area so that you 
are comfortable is very important in reducing or preventing the following:
• Neck and shoulder pain
• Eyestrain
• Stiffness
• Carpal tunnel syndrome
• Wrist pain
• Back pain
• Headaches
• Repetitive strain injury
Most larger companies are very “ergonomically aware” of correctly setting up work areas. 
If you are fortunate enough to work for such a company, take advantage of the services it offers. 
Even if your company does not offer ergonomic services, you can set up your own office so it is 
comfortable for you to work in.
Adjusting Your Chair
The best type of chair for office work is a “secretarial” chair (no arms) that has four types of 
adjustments:
• Seat height
• Seat angle
Nancy L. Josephson kindly made the original workbook material “user-­friendly” and contributed her wise 
advice on working at a computer.

218	
Appendix C: Working Comfortably at a Computer	
• Back height
• Back angle
Use the following guidelines when adjusting your chair:
1.	 Adjust the seat height so that your knees are bent at an angle of slightly over 90° and your 
feet are comfortable flat on the floor.
2.	 Don’t cross your legs while working. Crossed legs can constrict blood flow, causing tin-
gling and making your legs “go to sleep.”
3.	 Adjust the seat angle of your chair so that there is not a great deal of pressure on the part 
of your upper leg just above the knee.
4.	 Try to avoid chairs with arms. They put extra pressure on your arms and also position 
them at an unnatural angle if you tend to rest your arms on them.
5.	 You may need further lower back support than your chair provides. Ask your physician 
or physical therapist to recommend back support pillows that best suit your needs.
Adjusting the Monitor Height and Distance
Now that your chair is comfortable, move it to your desk and sit down. You’re now going to 
adjust the height of your monitor so less stress is placed on your neck and shoulders.
1.	 Sit comfortably on your chair. Keep your feet flat on the floor.
2.	 Hold your head so that you are looking straight ahead, not down and not up. This is the 
position your head should maintain when looking at the monitor. Relax your shoulders 
and arms while you are doing this.
3.	 Raise or lower the height of your monitor so that you are looking straight ahead—­neither 
up nor down. The monitor height should be approximately the same as your forehead 
height. You can raise the height of your monitor in a variety of ways:
 Telephone books
 Packages of paper
 Catalogues
 Specially designed shelving
4.	 The viewing distance from your eyes to the monitor should be 16–24 inches.
5.	 If the angle of your monitor can be adjusted, try tilting it 10–20°.
6.	 Once you have set the height of your monitor, sit down and see whether the position is 
comfortable for you. If you feel stress on your neck, try raising or lowering the monitor 
until it is comfortable for you.

	
Appendix C: Working Comfortably at a Computer	
219
Preventing Glare
Glare is the biggest single cause of eyestrain when a computer is being used. It is relatively easy to 
avoid eyestrain by following these suggestions:
1.	 Avoid setting your monitor in direct light (sunlight, overhead light, etc.).
2.	 Fluorescent overhead lights are the biggest culprits in causing glare. If possible, have the 
ones directly over your monitor turned off. You can always use a small portable light for 
desktop lighting if necessary.
3.	 Various types of glare screens are available at your local computer store. These can easily 
be attached directly to the front of your monitor.
4.	 Eyeglasses for glare prevention are also available, even for people who do not wear pre-
scription glasses. Check with your ophthalmologist for suggestions.
5.	 Something as simple as a large piece of cardboard that extends over the top of your moni-
tor can help reduce glare.
6.	 Avoid staring at the screen for too long a period of time. People who do this tend not to 
blink as often; this causes dry, hot eyes. Look away and focus on an object at a distance 
for a few seconds. Blink frequently to avoid dryness.
Adjusting the Keyboard Height
Carpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive strain injury have become fashionable ailments since the 
1990s, thanks to keyboards and mouse devices. If you use a keyboard or mouse device, you are 
susceptible to these problems, but your chances of getting them can be greatly reduced by a proper 
keyboard height. Follow these guidelines when setting up your keyboard:
1.	 The table height of your work surface should be between 23 and 28 inches (floor to typing 
surface).
2.	 Use a comfortable wrist pad in front of your keyboard, so that your wrists lie comfortably 
on the pad instead of the hard tabletop.
3.	 Adjust the table height so that when you position your hands on the keyboard, your 
elbows are bent at a 90° angle and your wrists are not bent up or down. Make sure that 
your wrists lie flat and that your fingers are stretched out in front.
Using a Mouse Pad
If you use a mouse device, follow these suggestions to prevent wrist and shoulder stress:
1.	 Use a mouse pad to protect your mouse and make it easier for you to operate the mouse.

220	
Appendix C: Working Comfortably at a Computer	
2.	 Try to move your entire arm when using a mouse. Many people make sharp, jerky move-
ments with their wrists when using a mouse. This puts added stress on the wrist.
3.	 Take a “mouse break” every now and then.
4.	 Position the mouse pad next to the keyboard so you don’t have to reach too far for the 
mouse.
Taking Breaks
If you spend more than an hour a day at your computer, the best thing you can do for your body 
and mind is to take breaks. Most computers have built-in clocks, and you can set an alarm that 
will tell you it’s time to take a break. Determine how long you can work comfortably before you 
need to take a break. Then take that break!
Exercising
Exercising is also a good way to reduce stress while you are working at a computer. Here are a 
few exercises that you can try:
Breathing
Perform diaphragmatic breathing to help relax your body and to reduce stress and tension. Let 
your head relax along with your shoulders and arms.
Eye Exercises
1.	 Look away from your monitor and focus on an object at a distance for a few seconds.
2.	 Blink your eyes frequently to provide moisture.
3.	 Move your eyes to the left, then to the right. Look up and then down.
Stretching Exercises
The following exercises can help reduce any tension or muscle strain that occurs while using your 
computer.
Shoulders and Neck
1.	 Raise your shoulders toward your ears and hold that slight tension for just a moment.
2.	 Relax your shoulders and arms.
3.	 Repeat this five times to prevent tightness in the shoulder and neck area.

	
Appendix C: Working Comfortably at a Computer	
221
Upper Back
1.	 Make sure you are sitting up straight.
2.	 Put your hands behind your head so that your elbows point out to the side.
3.	 Pull your shoulder blades toward each other until you feel a slight tightness in your upper 
back.
4.	 Hold this for about 10 seconds. Then release and relax.
Hands
There are two exercises for the hands. Here is the first:
1.	 Make a tight fist.
2.	 Hold for a few seconds.
3.	 Relax your hands.
And the second:
1.	 Straighten your fingers out in front of you.
2.	 Spread them as far apart from one another as you can.
3.	 Hold the spread until you feel slight tension.
4.	 Relax.
General Stretching
A good general exercise is just to get up from your desk and walk around, swinging your 
arms and moving your body.

Managing Osteoarthritis Pain 
with Medicines:  
A Review of the Research for Adults
What Does This Review Cover?
This summary describes how to manage osteoarthritis pain by using a group of medicines called 
“analgesics.” It also discusses the research about different types of analgesics. It talks about each 
medicine’s ability to relieve pain and the risks for serious side effects. It can help you talk with 
your doctor* about managing your osteoarthritis pain. Other ways to manage pain from osteoar-
thritis, such as surgery, narcotic medicines, or steroids, are not included in this summary.
Where Does the Information Come From?
Researchers funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), a Federal Gov-
ernment agency, updated a review of the research on analgesics for osteoarthritis. The updated 
review included 273 research studies published between January 2005 and January 2011. The 
report was reviewed by clinicians, researchers, experts, and the public.
Understanding Your Condition
What Is Osteoarthritis?
Osteoarthritis is a painful condition in which joints become swollen and stiff.
• Cartilage is the soft tissue between the bones that meet at a joint. It acts as a cushion and 
allows your connecting bones to move smoothly without rubbing against each other.
*In this publication, the term “doctor” refers to the health care professionals who may take care of you, 
including your physician, rheumatologist, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant.

Appendix D: Managing Osteoarthritis Pain with Medicines	
223
• In people with osteoarthritis, the cartilage between bones begins to break down and the 
bones start grinding together.
• Osteoarthritis causes pain, joint swelling, and damage.
How Common Is Osteoarthritis?
• Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis.
• It affects about 27 million people in the United States.
• It is a leading cause of disability.
• Osteoarthritis is more common in people who are older, overweight, or have injured a 
joint.
Why Manage the Pain of Osteoarthritis?
• Osteoarthritis can be very painful and may get worse over time.
• Osteoarthritis can make it hard to move, work, or enjoy activities.
Understanding Your Options
What Does It Mean to Manage the Pain?
There is no cure for osteoarthritis. However, your doctor may suggest one or more of the follow-
ing to help you manage your pain:
• Taking medicines called “analgesics” to help with pain and swelling.
• Keeping your weight at a healthy level to lessen the impact on your joints.
• Exercising to reduce pain and make it easier to do daily tasks.
What Are Analgesics?
Analgesics are a type of medicine that helps relieve pain and swelling. Analgesics come in differ-
ent forms:
• Acetaminophen: Most people know this medicine by the brand name Tylenol®.
• Nonsteroidal anti-­inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Some of the brand names of these medi-
cines may be familiar to you, like Advil®, Motrin®, Aleve®, and Celebrex®.
• Skin creams: Common brand names include BenGay®, Aspercreme®, or Theragen®.
• Supplements: Some people use the nutritional supplements glucosamine and chondroitin to 
reduce osteoarthritis pain.

More Information about Possible Serious Side Effects from Taking NSAIDs
Stomach Problems
Researchers found that:
• More people taking naproxen, ibuprofen, or diclofenac developed ulcers (open sores in the 
stomach) than people taking celecoxib, meloxicam, or etodolac.
• More people taking naproxen had serious stomach problems like stomach bleeding and 
ulcers than people taking ibuprofen.
• People taking NSAIDs who have had stomach bleeding in the past are more likely to have 
stomach bleeding caused by NSAIDs than people who have not had stomach bleeding in 
the past.
• People who take blood thinners (like Coumadin® or warfarin) or other medicines to block 
clotting (such as aspirin) while taking naproxen, ibuprofen, or diclofenac are three to six 
times more likely to have stomach bleeding than people who take blood thinners alone.
Supplements
What are the generic and brand 
names?
•• The generic names for these supplements are 
glucosamine and chondroitin. These are sold under 
many brand names and are sometimes sold together 
as one pill.
Are these supplements available 
without a prescription?
•• These supplements are available without a 
prescription, and can be found in grocery stores, drug 
stores, and natural food stores.
How well do these supplements help 
pain and swelling?
•• They may work as well as NSAID pills to relieve 
pain, but there is not enough research to know for 
sure.
What are the possible side effects of 
these supplements?
•• There is not enough research to say if these 
supplements cause side effects.
•• Supplements sold in the United States are not 
regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA). This means that the quality of the 
glucosamine and chondroitin may vary and their 
contents may be different from what is listed on 
the bottle. The supplements that have been studied 
were prescriptions that are 99% pure with no added 
ingredients and are not available in the United States. 
This means that the supplements you buy may not be 
the same as the ones that were researched.
Analgesics for Osteoarthritis Pain (cont.)

	
Appendix D: Managing Osteoarthritis Pain with Medicines	
227
• People who take a low dose (amount) of aspirin while taking celecoxib, naproxen, ibupro-
fen, or diclofenac increase their risk of getting an ulcer by about 6%.
• People who take higher doses of naproxen, ibuprofen, or diclofenac are more likely to have 
stomach bleeding than people who take lower doses.
• The risk of stomach problems from NSAIDs increases as you get older.
• Adding a medicine that reduces acid in the stomach (called a proton pump inhibitor, or 
PPI) to celecoxib could reduce the risk of ulcers and the problems caused by ulcers, includ-
ing bleeding.
Heart Problems
Researchers found that:
• Taking celecoxib, ibuprofen, or diclofenac increases your chances of having heart prob-
lems.
• Naproxen does not increase your risk of heart attack.
• People who take higher doses of celecoxib have a higher risk of having a heart attack than 
people taking lower doses.
• The risk of having heart problems from NSAIDs increases as you get older.
• All NSAIDs can worsen blood pressure, heart function, and kidney function. However, there 
are no clear differences between naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, etodolac, meloxicam, or 
nabumetone in the risk of high blood pressure, heart failure, or poor kidney function.
Making a Decision
What Should I Think about When Deciding?
Each pain medicine has a different set of benefits and risks, and each comes with a trade-off. Talk 
with your doctor to weigh the benefits and risks and to decide which medicine is best for you. 
You can discuss:
• How much pain and swelling you feel and how often you feel it.
• How well each medicine works to relieve pain and swelling.
• How comfortable you and your doctor are about your risks for serious side effects.
• Your age and other health issues that may affect your choice of pain medicine.
• The convenience and cost of having medicines available by prescription or over the counter.
What Are the Costs of Analgesics?
The cost to you for analgesics depends on:

228	
Appendix D: Managing Osteoarthritis Pain with Medicines	
• The type of health insurance that you have.
• The dose (amount) you need.
• Whether the medicine is available in generic form or is sold without a prescription (over the 
counter). Some NSAIDs are available over the counter, but your insurance may not cover 
the cost of these medicines if you buy them this way.
The cost of over-the-­counter analgesics depends on the pharmacy, the brand, and how much 
you buy at one time. When you shop around for the best price, you should also consider the qual-
ity of the product.
Ask Your Doctor
• Which analgesic do you think is safest for me but will still help control my pain?
• Am I at risk for stomach or heart problems if I take an NSAID?
• How long will it take for my pain to be under control?
• What side effects should I watch for?
• Could my other health conditions or medicines affect which medicine I take for my osteo-
arthritis pain?
• What are my other options if these medicines do not help?
• Is there anything else I can do to help manage my osteoarthritis pain?

Appendix E
Electronic Resources
A great deal of information, misinformation, and opinion is available on the Internet. It can be a 
challenge to sort fact from opinion, and what’s accurate from what’s not. Listed below are those 
Internet resources and some smartphone, iPad applications (apps) that may be useful and whose 
information appears to be reliable. However, things change rapidly, so you need to make your 
own assessment. Check out the information you find with your health care professionals and con-
sult your local librarians, who can give you personal assistance. Let me begin with a few general 
tips on how to assess the accuracy and reliability of information you find on the Internet.
Is It Accurate?
Some websites are more likely to offer accurate information than others because of their pro-
fessional, governmental, or institutional association. A few organizations have attempted to set 
up rules that promote ethical presentation of information—such as guidelines on including the 
source and purpose of information. One such organization is the Health on the Net Foundation 
Code of Conduct (HONcode) for medical and health websites. This organization asks that those 
websites requesting certification agree to abide by the following eight principles. These include 
indicating the qualifications of the authors, citing the source(s) of published information, backing 
up claims relating to benefits and performance, providing accessible presentation and accurate 
e-mail contact, identifying funding sources, respecting the privacy of personal 
data submitted by site visitors, and clearly distinguishing advertising from edito-
rial content. Before certification, the website is reviewed to verify compliance to 
the eight principles described, and an annual reassessment is performed. Web-
sites certified by the foundation carry the HONcode emblem. The verification 
process does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of the information at 
any given time but is meant to verify the intention of the website to present qual-
ity medical information through agreement to abide by the principles listed.
There are some simple checks that you can do to make your own assessment of information:
• Look for a recent “last updated” date. This is usually at the bottom of the home page. 
Information changes rapidly, and a site that has not been updated in a year is suspect.
• Look for the site sponsor. This can usually be found as an abbreviation in the “address” or 

232	
Appendix E: Electronic Resources	
URL (uniform resource locator) of the website. Take the following address as an example: 
www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus. The nlm stands for National Library of Medicine, nih 
is National Institutes of Health, .gov confirms that a major governmental institution is 
involved and should provide reliable information. If you access a personal website, exer-
cise some caution in distinguishing fact from opinion. Personal websites often have a tilde 
(~) before the owner’s name, but not always. You can find out who registered an Internet 
domain at www.whois.net.
• Compare information from multiple sources when available. Discrepancies indicate that 
there is a disagreement or inaccuracy, or that the material is opinion rather than fact.
• If it sounds far out or too good to be true, it probably is.
• Watch out for sites whose main interest is to get you to buy remedies and supplements or 
to push their agenda—unless there is credible information to support their claims. If they 
don’t provide evidence to support their claims, then don’t trust them.
• Be aware that search engines, such as Google, use complex formulas for presenting the 
results of a search. Some search engines move those who pay more to the front of the line.
A number of sites give suggestions for evaluating online resources. Just do a search for “Inter-
net accuracy” and you will see what I mean.
Note that providing the following resources does not constitute an endorsement of their con-
tent and is provided only as a service to those seeking information. Use of these sites and tools is 
not a substitute for seeking appropriate medical attention.

Software Applications: Apps
Apps are available for tracking pain and function, exercise and weight. Some apps are free; some 
are not. Before you buy an app, check to see if it is worth considering. Read the reviews; look at 
the last time the application was updated; and check the Version History for prior updates. If the 
application is not being maintained on a regular basis, then chances are it will give a disappoint-
ing performance. The reviews can disclose problems such as not being able to retrieve previously 
entered information after an update or problems with crashing. If the app does not allow for 
smooth and easy use, then it will probably be more trouble than just writing on paper. A few apps 
are listed below.
Pain Coach (iOS, Android), a free app from WebMD, will prompt you to check in and com-
plete the day’s assessment that includes the level of pain, treatments, and mood. Tips and goals 
that have been provided by WebMD doctors are available in five categories: Food, Rest, Exercise, 
Mood, and Treatments. It has the ability to create a pdf report for your health care provider.
CatchMyPain has a free app and one available for a fee. The free version has a Pain Diary 
that can be exported to show your doctor; you can create a pain drawing that is color coded; 
graph your pain; and describe the quality of your pain and the events associated with increasing 
or decreasing pain.
My Pain Diary HD: Chronic Pain and Symptom Tracker (iOS, Android) is available for a 
fee. It has the ability to upload pictures, print out reports to give to your doctor, and provide a 
color-coded method of charting your pain.
Chronic Pain Tracker (iOS) has a free version and one for a fee. It has a modular diary entry 
format with up to 19 unique categories to track—for example, sleep, symptoms, activity, and 
intensity of pain, to name a few.

of the data you create, and produce evidence-based reports for your health care provider. It syncs 
data to cloud storage; keeps health information, including medication and health history; and has 
active support and detailed user guides.
iCouch CBT (iOS), for a fee, can help you digitally record and track your automatic thoughts 
and the feelings associated with those thoughts. It prompts you with a list of potential cognitive 
distortions and then you record your new thoughts and feelings. Finally there is an opportunity to 

240	
Appendix E: Electronic Resources	
Think about It, allowing for further reflection on the situation that caused the original emotional 
response and an opportunity to think about what you could do the next time a similar situation 
occurs.
Moodkit—Mood Improvement Tools (iOS): This fee-based app is based on CBT and helps 
you digitally record your mood, thoughts, and activities through Thought Checker, Mood Tracker, 
and Journaling with the ability to create, save, and export notes. The Moodkit Activities provide

Date:                                 Name: 	
Make a list of activities that increase your pain and those that decrease your pain (refer to Chapter 4). 
Activities that increase my pain
Example: Washing dishes (standing)
Activities that decrease my pain
Paying bills (sitting)
Can you delegate any of the activities associated with pain increases? (For example, bringing dirty laun-
dry to the washing machine.) Star (*) the ones you can.
Delegate one activity this week. It will be 	
.
Choose one “increase pain” activity from your list and time how long it takes to increase pain level by 1 
point. Then choose a “decrease pain” activity and time how long it takes for the pain to decrease again. 
Alternate between activities that increase and decrease your pain.
Example: Pain ↑ Activity = Wash dishes
Pain ↓ Activity = Pay bills
Wash dishes (10 mins.)
Sort bills from mail (15 mins.)
Wash dishes (10 mins.)
Write checks (15 mins.)
Wash dishes (10 mins.)
Address envelopes (10 mins.)
Activity that increases pain
Activity that decreases pain
Can you adapt any of the above activities so that they can be performed more easily? What would be 
some of the adaptations? (For example: sitting to fold laundry or peel vegetables; lying down to call 
a friend or listen to a book on tape; opening cabinet door under kitchen sink so that you can rest one 
foot on the shelf; putting bowls in sink to stir ingredients.)

Food Diary Instructions
Time started: The time of day that you begin eating a meal.
Food/beverage: Record everything you eat and drink. Note such things as whether the food or bev-
erage contained a sweetener substitute or whether it was a new product for you. Are you eating a 
variety of fruits and vegetables, grain products (including whole grains) and healthy protein per day?
Quantity: The amount that you ate or drank (e.g., 1 cup/8 oz. glass) or the plate portion (½, ¼ of the 
dinner plate). Consider taking pictures of your plate or bowl before eating to help keep track of por-
tions and proportions.
Time ended: The time at which you ended the meal you were recording. (If a number of your meals last 
10 minutes or less, maybe you should consider eating more slowly.)
You may have to keep a Food Diary for many weeks before you see a relationship between foods and 
pain patterns.

Letter to Health Care Professionals
Dear Health Care Professional:
Managing Pain Before It Manages You is a practical, patient-­oriented workbook. It provides 
information on basic pain mechanisms, medical treatment of chronic pain, and multiple cog-
nitive and behavioral skills that can assist patients with coping and functioning. Although a 
patient can use this book on his or her own, it can be even more effective if supported by a 
health care professional who can guide the patient through the program and reinforce the 
book’s information. The workbook was originally written to supplement a 10-visit group 
medical program for chronic pain management, but it can be used in individual therapy as 
well.
If you are a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant, this book can supplement 
the pharmacological, interventional, and surgical treatments recommended to patients with 
chronic pain.
If you are a psychologist, social worker, nurse, or counselor, this workbook offers a com-
plete, self-­guided cognitive and behavioral therapy program for your clients or patients. 
It can be used in patient education, in conjunction with other medical therapies, and in 
psychotherapy. Patients can use the workbook independently or as a formal 8- to 10-week 
individual or group program.
Efficacy of This Approach
A growing body of evidence supports the individual components of a biopsychosocial 
approach to the management of chronic pain. The approach is further supported by evi-
dence-based treatment guidelines, such as those found in the Cochrane Database of Sys-
tematic Reviews (www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-in/mrwhome/106568753/HOME), BMJ 
Clinical Evidence (www.clinicalevidence.com/ceweb), the U.S. government’s Effective Health 
Care Program (www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov), and through such evidence-based search 
engines as the Trip Database (www.tripdatabase.com).
The best approach to chronic pain syndromes is a comprehensive one that includes a 
thorough history and physical exam to understand the source of pathology or pain etiology, 
a stepwise approach to address the multiple sources of pain and distress, and repeated reas-
sessment to assure responsiveness to treatment. Chronic pain is either perpetuated through 
central nervous system mechanisms (non-­nociceptive) or related to underlying chronic pain-
ful diseases (nociceptive). Both types of pain are essentially incurable at this time unless the 
underlying pathology can be eliminated. As such, addressing the biological, psychological, 
and sociological consequences benefit both by reducing symptoms, increasing activity, and 
assisting patients in coping with chronic illness and managing their symptoms. The materials 
presented in this book are grounded in the principles of chronic disease management. They 
are a synthesis of medical and behavioral approaches to symptom and disease management 
that have been shown to decrease symptoms and decrease clinic utilization (Caudill et al., 
(cont.)

1991; Becker et al., 2000). Furthermore, this intervention program can increase self-­efficacy, 
an important mediator of pain-­related disability and depression symptoms (Arnstein et al., 
1999).
The Professional’s Role in Facilitating This Program
Those who do not feel pain, seldom think that it is felt.
—Samuel Johnson, MD, 1708–1784
Progress has been made in the understanding of pain mechanisms, but there is much that 
remains a mystery. Chronic pain is always a subjective experience, and its consequences, 
both psychological and medical, have social ramifications. Although there is no objective 
measure of pain at this time, it is important to believe patients who report their pain experi-
ence. It is important for you and your patient to acknowledge that, although living in pain is 
a challenge, there are many things that can be done, both nonpharmacological and pharma-
cological, to decrease symptoms and improve quality of life. If you do not feel comfortable 
evaluating and treating chronic pain, you are obligated to refer the patient to someone who 
can assist in providing direction.
Many health care professionals feel unsure about how to evaluate or treat pain. It is 
challenging without a pain meter or other objective measure of pain. Such uncertainty has 
helped to drive the inappropriate prescribing of opioids in the past decade (Caudill-­Slosberg 
et al., 2004) and precipitated the public health crisis of opioid abuse, addiction, and diver-
sion. At the same time, there has been a dramatic increase in pharmaceutical advertising 
in popular media as well as to physicians. This marketing program has created unrealistic 
demands for pharmacological cures by patients who understandably feel quite desperate 
to be free of pain. It is therefore crucial that the health professional and the patient under-
stand the proposed pain mechanisms and treatment rationale described in Chapter 2 of this 
workbook. This information can help explain both the limits of pharmaceutical, surgical, 
and interventional therapies and the need for physical activity, good nutrition, and effective 
coping strategies.
Assessing and Encouraging Patient Readiness for Change
Teaching an appreciation of the biopsychosocial process at the time of the initial evalua-
tion lends validity to treatments such as cognitive-­behavioral therapies. Explore what other 
symptoms patients are experiencing in addition to their pain. The professional can help 
identify stress-­related symptoms such as fatigue, memory problems, irritable bowel, muscle 
tension, shortness of breath, palpitations, irritability, and insomnia. Questions about the 
patient’s psychosocial history can help identify other influencing issues and provide more 
mind–body connections for discussion. For example:
•• “What activities have you changed because of your pain?” Humans are incred-
ibly adaptable and are quite capable of using denial for coping. Detailing which 
(cont.)
	
Letter to Health Care Professionals (cont.)

	
257	
work and leisure activities have been curtailed inside and outside the home 
offers evidence for the consequences of the pain experience.
•• “Where do you get your emotional support? Who or what helps you to problem-
solve?” Behavioral medicine research has documented the positive power of 
support through close friends, spouses, and religious/spiritual affiliation. How-
ever, many patients with chronic pain also suffer from isolation and despair.
•• “In addition to your pain and the problems it causes, what other stresses do you 
have to cope with right now?” This can be a very revealing question. The losses 
incurred from unemployment or decreased work capacity alone can have eco-
nomic, social, and self-­esteem consequences of enormous importance. Family 
illness, impending bankruptcy, or homelessness can make coping with pain even 
more challenging.
•• “Have you ever been abused, physically, emotionally, or sexually? Have you 
experienced a trauma?” There is a very high positive response to this question 
among chronic pain patients who are having difficulty adjusting to the prob-
lem. Such histories are important to uncover because they influence the way in 
which relaxation skills are taught. Patients with a history of trauma or abuse may 
require individual treatment to distinguish the emotional consequences of these 
events from similar feelings common to chronic pain, such as feeling vulnerable 
or out of control, or that no one believes them.
•• “Do you have any fears or concerns about your pain? What do you think is going 
on?” The majority of patients have ideas (or fears) about the source or cause of 
their pain. For obvious reasons, addressing these concerns may go a long way in 
getting them to recognize their part in pain management.
•• “What do you want to get from your visit today?” This question sends the mes-
sage that the patient has a right to have expectations for a visit. It is also a good 
starting point for clarifying unrealistic expectations. It can be the perfect open-
ing to discuss the roles of the health care professional and patient in reaching a 
common goal.
•• “If I can’t cure your pain today, how can I help you to manage it?” This question 
expands on a common response of many patients. They will say, “You don’t 
understand, Doctor, I don’t want my pain, so why would I want to manage it?” 
This again allows for discussion of the nature and reality of chronic, persistent 
pain. Early in treatment many people feel that acceptance of pain management 
is a condemnation to a life of pain even if a cure comes along. They somehow 
think they will be excluded because they have accepted their pain. This misun-
derstanding is important to clarify. Acceptance means dealing with the here 
and now; pain may be mandatory because there isn’t a cure at this time, but the 
suffering is definitely optional.

These questions can elicit a quick overview of an individual’s pain experience and lay the 
groundwork for establishing that pain is both stressful and affected by stress. It also sends 
the message that you are concerned about the pain and the person in pain. Listening to the 
patient’s responses to these questions helps set up realistic treatment expectations and ori-
ents treatment to the patient’s level of understanding.
Patients in the precontemplation stage of change (Biller et al., 2000; Rollnick et al., 2008) 
who have not thought about the relationship between their behavior and pain or who are 
not ready to hear that they have a role in pain management can be asked just to read the 
Summary at the end of each chapter in this book. The Quick Skill sections provide a sample 
of skills or reflections that may capture their interest; they allow patients to dangle a toe in 
the water if they are not yet ready to plunge into the pond. Patients can also begin by just 
keeping a Pain Diary, as described in Chapter 1, which might help them focus on how their 
pain experience is affected and altered by their daily activities and mood.
Patients are most ready to start using this workbook when they can acknowledge 
(1) that what they have been doing to date is not helping them to cope with or manage 
their pain, and (2) that they need new skills to handle the physical, emotional, and cognitive 
effects of pain on their lives—­effects of which they may not even have been aware before 
your discussion.
Guiding Patients through the Workbook
When patients are ready, this workbook can provide a guide for change. It is helpful to set 
a start date with the patient to begin implementing this program. It is also useful to review 
the patient’s goals both to demonstrate your interest and to ensure that the patient’s goals 
are realistic and achievable.
Patients consistently report the benefits of techniques that elicit the relaxation response, 
pacing activities, exercise, challenging negative self-talk, and diary keeping. If time is limited, 
focusing on these skills may be most productive. Otherwise, a chapter a week is a realistic 
pace to set.
With each week and each chapter, more observations and skills are added to the cop-
ing repertoire. Encourage patients to keep using and adding to the skills—with the hope of 
achieving a synergism—not just to do them one at a time.
To encourage action, ask at follow-up visits what patients are learning from their diary 
keeping, relaxation techniques, and activity pacing. Because the cognitive therapy skills can 
begin to challenge some basic assumptions and beliefs, patients may be reluctant to do the 
writing exercises. These are crucial to changing cognitive distortions and ineffective patterns 
of thinking. Encourage patients to bring these exercise sheets to their follow-up appoint-
ments or to keep a journal. Journaling can help patients become more comfortable with 
what goes on inside the mind and how it reacts to the world. Growing self-­awareness can 
gently move patients into action. This movement toward maintenance of action over time is 
essential for behavioral change to occur and set the stage for a new standard of living.

The sequence of chapters in this workbook reflects the way the program is taught. 
The arrangement of topics is geared toward encouraging patient adherence to the pro-
gram through the gradual build-up of pain management skills. Techniques that are easier 
to learn and provide more immediate results—such as relaxation techniques and physical 
exercise—are presented first. Quick skills are available in each chapter and facilitate access 
to rapid insights. Successfully adopting these skills provides reinforcement for continuing 
with the more complex techniques taught in later chapters, including mindfulness drawn 
from mindfulness-based stress reduction, that require long-term practice, introspection, and 
self-­reflection.
Maintenance and Management of Pain Flare-Ups
Chapter 10 of the workbook addresses relapse prevention and pain flare-up management. 
Whichever technique the patient chooses to employ, either “coping with stages of pain” 
or the “panic plan,” a copy of the plan should be kept in his or her record and periodically 
updated. Referral to the plan can then be made, should he or she experience a pain flare-
up. However, if the patient insists that a particular pain flare-up is different from what he or 
she usually experiences, a reassessment is necessary to rule out other developments. I have 
found that once patients become active participants in pain management through this pro-
gram, they are the best judges of their own pain experience.
From here on, periodic inquiries about maintenance of skills such as relaxation and 
mindfulness techniques (Chapter 3), mini-­relaxations (Chapter 3), pacing activities (Chapter 
4), strategies for response to negative emotional states (Chapters 5 and 6), reduced caffeine 
and alcohol consumption (Chapter 7), and communication skills (Chapter 8) will also serve 
to reinforce behavioral change maintenance. If patients have stopped practicing these skills 
and are having increased difficulty with pain management, it may be necessary for you 
to identify the specific problems holding them back. For example, has a setback occurred 
because the patient was secretly hoping this program would cure his or her pain, and it 
didn’t? Did the patient stop the program because it was going so well it didn’t seem neces-
sary anymore? Or is a separate life crisis distracting the patient from the pain management 
program? Once you have determined what issues are involved, you can set a date for the 
patient to get back into the program and then reinstitute a schedule of periodic checks on 
skills practice.
A Final Note
I do appreciate the challenge of working in medicine today: the increased time pressures 
associated with trying to manage the complicated issues inherent in chronic disease man-
agement and the use of opioids. Working as a team with advanced nurse practitioners, 
nursing staff, or psychotherapists on supporting elements of the program can help manage 
the changes over time that are necessary to establish new behaviors. In the original program 
(cont.)

from which this book sprang, I had the amazing experience of working with nurse practi-
tioners, psychologists, and physical therapists. Each brought their expertise and experience 
to the issues. Although this multidisciplinary approach is not supported in today’s insurance 
environment, it does not make it a less viable solution. Follow-up visits by the patient with 
these support disciplines may be as effective.
My personal practice is not to recommend opioids for the vast majority of chronic pain 
patients I see. This decision is not made lightly, as I have been at both ends of the prescribing 
spectrum. In most cases I evaluate, the use of opioids rarely changes the reporting of pain 
levels. Without the additional behavioral changes or willingness to engage in more effective 
coping strategies, the quality of life with opioids alone is not improved. Short-term opioids 
to accomplish specific goals or for pain flare-ups do have a role, however. These are difficult 
conversations to have with those who insist that opioids are the only answer.
I cannot emphasize enough what a rewarding experience it is to see people change, 
improve their quality of life, and feel more empowered in the face of some of the most dif-
ficult pain problems. It is critical to start from where the patients are at in terms of their level 
of information, beliefs, and readiness to consider new directions in behavior and lifestyle 
practices. Your important role in facilitating this process will have its own rewards.
