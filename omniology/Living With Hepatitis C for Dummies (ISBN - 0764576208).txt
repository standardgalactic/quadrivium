Foreword 
I’
m thrilled to be writing the foreword for Living with Hepatitis
C For Dummies. Nina L. Paul, PhD, has written a comprehen-
sive guide to living with this illness. Nina has studied epidemiology,
immunology, and viruses extensively, and her vast knowledge and
experience have made her the ideal author for this book. She covers
every issue of living with and managing hepatitis C — from diagno-
sis to treatment. The For Dummies series of books has been around
for quite some time, and it’s refreshing to see hepatitis C written
about in such an insightful way. Having a well-written, user-friendly
book that can educate people with this diagnosis is a godsend.
I know firsthand how important it is to have a guide like this. When
you have hepatitis C, it seems all you have are questions and not
many answers. Being diagnosed with this illness can create much
confusion and fear, and you may feel powerless over the disease.
By learning all you can about hepatitis C and how best to deal with
it, your overwhelming anxiety is lessened. Reading Living with
Hepatitis C For Dummies can do just that!
Many people have no symptoms from hepatitis C, yet they often
worry about the uncertainty of what the disease will bring in the
future. In addition, hepatitis C patients often deal with the stigma
surrounding the disease. A large portion of our society knows 
nothing about hepatitis C, and those who do often have many mis-
conceptions. This book not only educates the patient with clear,
concise, and accurate information, but it can also be shared with
family and friends to help them understand what the patient is deal-
ing with. Having any chronic illness creates many challenges, but
you can learn to face them head on and learn how to deal with them
in a more positive way. When you arm yourself with knowledge, you
empower yourself and ultimately gain some sense of control over
your illness. You may not be able to control the outcome, but you
have the power to control how you deal with it. The information
and knowledge this book provides will help to give you the power
to face this disease head on.
When I first started running support groups for hepatitis C patients,
I saw a great number of people with many misconceptions about the
disease. Much has been learned since the early ’90s. Early on, I saw
many people struggle through interferon monotherapy, yet I saw very
few people respond to the treatment regimen. Over time, with the
addition of ribavirin, I saw many more patients respond and remain
virus free at the end of treatment. The next leap forward was pegy-
lated interferon. As the research chronicled a much better response

rate, I saw those results firsthand with the patients in my support
groups. Witnessing this great advance in hepatitis C treatment has
been wonderful, and I feel very fortunate to work with patients who
are benefiting from these advances. But the most important mes-
sage here is that there is hope for someday living a life free of the
hepatitis C virus. Of course, not everyone can take treatment for
various reasons, and not all of those who do will respond. With
ongoing research, many more drug regimens will be used, and 
ultimately many, many more people will be cured.
My personal journey with this disease began in 1994 with acute
hepatitis C. As an RN, I knew what hepatitis was, but beyond that, 
I knew very little. If this book were available at the time of my diag-
nosis, it would have been much easier to understand the disease
and overcome the fear and uncertainty. Just like everyone else with
this illness, I wish that I didn’t have hepatitis C. However, the glass
is still half full for me, and it can be for you, too. I have hepatitis C,
but it’s just one aspect of my life, of which there are many. It is pos-
sible to deal with adversity with grace and dignity, and out of this
struggle comes personal growth. When you have hepatitis C, it
changes some of the ways that you view your life and the decisions
you must make, but you can learn to deal with the changes this 
disease brings about. Living with hepatitis C is an ongoing journey,
and you will get all the information you need to move forward in
this journey right here in this book. Bravo, Nina Paul, for writing

Introduction
M
illions of people in the United States and all over the world
have been infected with hepatitis C. Many don’t even know
they have it, because symptoms may not appear for decades. 
The sooner you know that you have hepatitis C, the sooner you
can begin medical treatment and start making lifestyle changes to
protect others from infection and keep yourself healthy. 
Hepatitis C infects the liver and causes a range of disease from
none-at-all to life-threatening liver disease that can only be treated
with a liver transplant. Most people fall within these two extremes. 
Hepatitis C virus spreads through contact with infected blood. You
could’ve received hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or from
sharing any type of needle or sharp instrument for medical, cos-
metic, or drug use.
But how you got your hepatitis C is nowhere near as important as
what you’re doing now to help yourself stay well. Use this book
to help you build a support network and make informed choices
about your healthcare and lifestyle.
About This Book
While writing this book, I’ve tried to focus on the friendly advice
given to me by a woman with hepatitis C:
“I want choices. I need info. I want to defuse my fears. And
please, keep it simple.”
I’ve also hung my hat on the fact that every individual facing hepati-
tis C is just that — an individual. You may be young or old, male or
female. You’re of a different race, ethnic group, or nationality than
others. You have different responses to different medications, as
well as different personal preferences on the types of medications
you’ll take. You have different levels of healthcare due to different
finances and locations. In this book, I present various options and
choices so that you can find the ones that work best for you.

Throughout this book, I emphasize the value of a positive attitude,
because it helps you deal with the healthcare system, reduces
stress, and just plain makes you feel better (as well as everyone
around you).
I believe that it’s important to dispel myths about hepatitis C and
eliminate prejudices and stigmas against people with the virus. The
best offense against closed-mindedness is information. So I help
clear up any misconceptions and questions you may have about
the disease, and I give you information, tips, and resources for deal-
ing with negativity that you may face because of your illness.
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout the book, I use certain words interchangeably:
 In some places, the doctor is a he, and in other places, a she.
 When I write healthcare providers or healthcare practitioners, I
usually mean your doctor (physician). But this term includes
professional nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nutri-
tionists, and naturopaths.
 Hepatitis C is also called hep C, hep C virus, and sometimes
HCV (hepatitis C virus)
 When I refer to medications, I usually present the generic
name first, followed by the brand name in parentheses.
To help you navigate through this book, I use the following typo-
graphical conventions:
 Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or
terms that are defined in the text.
 Boldfaced text is used to indicate keywords in bulleted lists
or the action parts of numbered steps.
 Monofont is used for Web addresses.
 Sidebars are shaded gray boxes that contain text that’s interest-
ing to know but not necessarily critical to your understanding
of the chapter or section topic.
Finally, I aim to provide the most accurate statistics on hepatitis C.
But numbers change, depending on a large number of factors,
such as the specific medications, the different types of people a
study looked at, and so on. So consider the numbers I give you as
approximations.

What You’re Not to Read
Each of you has different needs and interests, so read the chapters
that apply to you. If you don’t know a child with hepatitis C, for
example, skip the chapter on children. The same thing applies to
sidebars that are asides to the main topic and information marked
with the Technical Stuff icon. On the other hand, you’re free to read
all of the text, if you want. I happen to think it’s all great information
(but I could be a little biased on that matter).
Foolish Assumptions
All writers have to make assumptions about their audience, and I’m
no different. While writing this book, I’ve assumed the following:
 You’re not really a dummy, or else you wouldn’t have picked
up this book.
 You have come to this book to find reliable, up-to-date infor-
mation on hepatitis C in a clear and readable format.
 You want some background on the virus and your liver so you
can get a handle on what’s going on in your body.
 You want to learn about alternative treatments, whether you
actually use them or not.
 You want to know the pros and cons of interferon treatment.
 You will at least think about dropping some of those bad
habits, if doing so will help you stay healthy.
How This Book Is Organized
To help you navigate through the different aspects of hepatitis C,
I’ve separated the information into parts: basic background 
information; medical information; lifestyle and living issues; and
specific chapters for children, women, minorities, and family and
friends.
Part I: Understanding and 
Exposing Hepatitis C
You may be wondering what the heck is going on inside your body
when you have hepatitis C. In this part, I present the basic science
Introduction

about hepatitis C. You can read about the hepatitis C virus and
other hepatitis viruses, how these viruses are transmitted, and
how to protect others. I also explain how hepatitis C infects and
harms your hard-working liver, and describe the symptoms and
how the disease progresses.
Part II: Diagnosing and 
Treating the Disease
In this part, I explain the different types of doctors who can treat
hepatitis C and offer advice on how you can find and work with a
doctor. I discuss the different laboratory tests that you undergo
before a diagnosis is made, and give you information on conven-
tional and alternative hepatitis C therapies, which you can use to
help you decide on treatment. This part is where you also can find
a discussion of liver transplants.
Part III: Living a Good 
Life with Hep C
This part offers advice on choosing healthy foods, exercising 
regularly, reducing stress, and avoiding substances and lifestyle
choices that will further harm your liver. I also explain how to get
the support you need, discuss your hep C with others, manage
your work life, and handle financial issues related to dealing with
this chronic illness.
Part IV: Considering Different
Groups with Hepatitis C
Anyone can get hepatitis C, and in this part, I look at specific issues
related to children, women, men, different ethnic groups, and other
special groups with hepatitis C. Another important group is the
family and friends of people with hepatitis C, and I devote a whole
chapter to helping these folks.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In this classic part of the For Dummies books, you can find tips
about traveling when you have hepatitis C and getting a good
night’s sleep. I also list resources that you can turn to for more
information about hepatitis C.

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book, you’ll see small illustrations to the left of
some text. These are called icons, and they alert you to the type
of information presented.
This fine piece of art alerts you to practical information and insight
that you can put to use.
The Remember icon marks information that’s so important, you
don’t ever want to forget it.
When I discuss something that could be dangerous to your health,
I use the Warning icon.
This icon indicates you’re entering a jargon zone that you may
wish to skip or where you may want to tread carefully. It’s great
information, don’t get me wrong, but not reading it won’t affect
your grasp on the matter at hand.
When you see this icon, you need to consult your physician about
a particular matter.
I use this icon to let you know when you should obtain and file
away copies of important medical information.
Where to Go from Here
You’re ready to delve into the meat of the book now. Like all For
Dummies books, this book is designed to let you get in and get 
out — you can start reading anywhere. Each chapter is a self-
contained bundle of information, so using the table of contents,
you can head straight to the chapter that best meets your needs.
Or you can start with Chapter 1 and read straight through.
Here are my suggestions to enhance your use of this book:
 Have your test results and other medical information handy
as you go through the book.
 Start a healthcare notebook or binder of the information.
 Write down any questions that come up to ask your doctor,
support group, or spouse.

Remember, many other people with hepatitis C are walking the
same steps, and you can find them, if you like, in support groups
(see Chapter 14). Good luck in your journey to live well with 
hepatitis C!

Part I
Understanding and
Exposing Hepatitis C

In this part . . . 
W
hen you have hep C, you’re not alone. Millions of
people around the world have been exposed to
infected blood, causing an epidemic of hepatitis C. Like
other hepatitis viruses, hepatitis C infects the liver. In
many people, hepatitis C has the unfortunate feature of
staying in the body for decades and becoming a long-term
chronic illness. Hep C has a long list of symptoms, depend-
ing on the damage to your liver. In this part, I describe the
basic biology of the hepatitis C virus, your immune system,
and the workings of your wonderful liver. I also explain the
symptoms and disease progression of hepatitis C.

H
epatitis C is called an epidemic because of the numbers of
people infected. In the United States, almost 4 million people
have hepatitis C virus. In Canada, the number is 240,000. In the
entire world, at least 170 million people are currently infected.
Hepatitis C virus has infected so many people because of the way
that it spreads — through contact with infected blood.
If you or a loved one has been recently diagnosed with hepatitis C,
and if you’re like most folks, you probably have a lot of questions
and a fair number of fears. This book can help answer those ques-
tions and, in the process, quiet the fears.
Hepatitis C does not have to be a death sentence. Getting medical
treatment; staying away from alcohol and other dangers to your
liver; and otherwise taking good care of your body, mind, and spirit
can allow you to live long and live well.
In this chapter, I introduce the essential concepts about living with
the hepatitis C virus. My goal is to quickly answer the most press-
ing questions you may have and let you know where you can find
more information on each matter in the rest of the book.

How Hepatitis C Is Spread
Hepatitis C is a virus, and it spreads from person to person through
infected blood. Everyone should know how hepatitis C virus is
transmitted so they can take measures to protect themselves.
In the United States and other developed countries, the blood
supply wasn’t tested until 1992, so if you got a blood transfusion or
underwent any type of organ transplant before then, you could’ve
gotten the hep C virus.
The blood supplies in developed Western countries are now safe,
but this isn’t the case around the world. In developing or transi-
tional countries (as defined by the World Health Organization, or
WHO), reuse of injection equipment for medical procedures is the
major source of new infections.
Here are the main ways that hepatitis C can now spread in the
United States and other developed countries:
 Use of shared equipment for drug use, tattoos, or piercing. 
 Mother-to-child transmission.
 Sexual transmission.
 Sharing items such as toothbrushes or razors with someone
with hepatitis C.
 Occupational exposure.
To read more about transmission of this virus and how to protect
others, check out Chapter 2. If you feel that you have a risk factor
for hepatitis C virus, go see your doctor, and get a hepatitis C test
(I discuss the tests in Chapter 6).
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C

Hepatitis C timeline in United States
Hepatitis C was initially called hepatitis non-A non-B before it was identified. Here’s
a list of some milestones in the identification of hep C, protection of the United States
blood supply, and treatment of hepatitis C.
1980s 242,000 new infections of hepatitis C occurred per year.
1987 Clotting factor protected (because of precautions against HIV).
1989 Hepatitis C virus was identified.

Getting Tested for Hepatitis C
Hepatitis C is a silent virus; most people don’t know they have the
virus until decades after infection. You can find out if you’ve been
exposed to hepatitis C by taking a blood test.
In addition to the risk factors I outline in the previous section, you
should get tested for hepatitis C if you’ve ever been on long-term
kidney dialysis or have signs of liver disease.
In Chapter 6, I cover all the tests and the possible results in detail.
But basically, hep C tests come in two forms, both of which involve
drawing some blood:
 Antibody test: The first level of tests looks for the immune
response to the virus, called antibody. The antibody test tells
if you’ve ever seen the virus, even in the past. It doesn’t tell
you if have the virus now.
 RNA tests: More-direct tests of the virus look for the virus
component called RNA, or ribonucleic acid. The RNA test
tells if you have the virus right now and how much you have
(viral load or quantitative test).
After you know you have hepatitis C, see a liver specialist to get an
expert evaluation of your condition. Turn to Chapter 5 for tips on
choosing and communicating with your doctor.
Describing the Disease
Hepatitis means inflammation (itis) of the liver (hepa). The subject
of this book is hepatitis C, but actually, a number of viruses infect
the liver and cause liver disease — and they’re all called hepatitis
viruses. You can read more about the differences between these
viruses in Chapter 2, but for the moment, I concentrate on the one
that brought you here.
Chapter 1: Conquering Hepatitis C 11
1992 Blood supply in the United States first tested for hepatitis C.
1996 Interferon first used in treatment of hepatitis C.
1998 Interferon plus ribavirin became standard treatment.
2001 25,000 new infections of hepatitis C.
2002 Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin became standard treatment.

The numbers
Everyone responds differently to hepatitis C virus. If you’ve been
infected with hepatitis C virus, you want to know what’ll happen to
you. Your doctor is the best person to advise you on your particu-
lar situation. But I’ll present some numbers, here and throughout
the book. Remember: These numbers are only estimates.
Of the people exposed to hepatitis C virus,
 15 to 25 percent clear (get rid of) the virus when they first get
infected.
 75 to 85 percent develop a long-term, or chronic, infection.
About 20 percent of the people who have a long-term chronic infec-
tion get cirrhosis. Cirrhosis can occur 10 or 20 years or more after
you’re first infected. After you have cirrhosis, you’re at risk of get-
ting the most serious illness — liver failure or liver cancer. 
If you develop liver failure or have liver cancer, the best treatment
is a liver transplant (see Chapter 9). Between 1 to 5 percent of
people with hepatitis C virus will die from the disease.
The liver
The hepatitis C virus infects liver cells. For most people with 
hepatitis C, the main problem is how hepatitis C hurts your liver.
The liver processes practically every single thing you eat, drink, 
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C

Hepatitis C around the world
Hepatitis C affects millions of people around the globe — rich and poor. Calling hep-
atitis C a ‘’viral time bomb,’’ the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that
 About 3 percent of the world’s population is infected with hep C.
 3 to 4 million new infections occur each year.
 Around 170 million people are chronically infected and risk getting cirrhosis
and/or liver cancer.
Chronic infections can be treated with medication in developed countries (see the
“Choosing treatments” section in this chapter), but unfortunately, the cost of such
medications is too high for most of the millions of people living in countries with
fewer financial resources.

or otherwise absorb into your body. It makes proteins, filters out
waste and toxins, stores sugars and vitamins, and converts foods
and drugs into usable substances. (See Chapter 4 for more infor-
mation on the liver and its normal functions.)
The disease
To see the extent of liver disease, your doctor will perform blood
tests. You may already have had an ALT (alanine transferase) test,
which is commonly used to look for liver damage but is by no
means the only test. (See Chapter 7 for a description of other tests
that look for liver damage or changes in liver function.)
You doctor will probably suggest a liver biopsy, which gives a
direct picture of your liver. The liver biopsy can show two types
of damage to your liver from hepatitis C:
 Inflammation: This earlier stage of damage is reversible.
 Scarring (fibrosis): Most experts agree that scarring is proba-
bly somewhat reversible in early stages, but continued scarring
damages the liver and isn’t reversible.
Inflammation causes the disease called hepatitis, which gives you
symptoms of hepatitis C, but your disease isn’t life-threatening
unless you get cirrhosis. Scarring prevents your liver from perform-
ing its crucial jobs to keep your body functioning. When scarring
covers most of the liver, you get cirrhosis. There are two types of
cirrhosis:
 Compensated cirrhosis: Even though you have cirrhosis, your
liver is still performing its tasks.
 Decompensated cirrhosis: This is another name for end-stage
liver disease or liver failure. Here, your liver is no longer work-
ing properly. You’ll die from the damage to your liver, unless
you get a liver transplant.
Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is a life-threatening dis-
ease that sometimes occurs in people with cirrhosis. Your doctor
will give you an ultrasound or other imaging test to see if there is
evidence of liver tumors (see Chapter 7).
If you have liver cancer (only for some stages, though) or end-stage
liver disease, a liver transplant can save your life. Read about treat-
ments for liver disease in Chapter 8 and about liver transplants in
Chapter 9.
Chapter 1: Conquering Hepatitis C 13

The symptoms
If you have chronic hepatitis C, your symptoms can be bothersome
and, in some cases, debilitating. Chronic hepatitis C disease has
many symptoms. The most common are fatigue (which is more
than tiredness and persists even after a good night’s sleep), nausea
and vomiting, muscle and joint aches, itchy skin, fluid retention,
brain fog (loss of concentration, ability to focus, or remember),
and depression. In Chapter 4, I provide a longer list of symptoms
and outline the progression of hepatitis C disease. 
Along with problems with your liver, you may have other illnesses
that are associated with hepatitis C. These are called extrahepatic
diseases because they’re not strictly liver (hepatic) diseases and
include diseases of the skin or kidneys. In Chapter 4, I describe a few
of the other types of illnesses you may experience with hepatitis C.
Fighting Hepatitis C
Wherever you are in the battle to heal from hepatitis C, you hold
the keys to preventing further liver damage. 
Seek the advice and care of qualified healthcare practitioners. I
give some tips on finding practitioners in Chapter 5 and on evaluat-
ing healthcare choices in Chapter 10.
Choosing treatments
The medical fight against hepatitis C is evolving. At this time, 
the primary recommended treatment by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for chronic hepatitis C is a combination of
two drugs — interferon and ribavirin. These drugs can stop the 
hep C virus from growing in your body. The form of interferon
that’s currently used is called pegylated interferon, or the short-
ened version, peginterferon. Therefore, you’ll see the treatment
referred to as peginterferon plus ribavirin therapy. Got all that? 
Just think: There are more rather strange names waiting for you 
in Chapter 8, where I discuss this and other Western medical 
treatments.
But not everyone with hepatitis C undergoes drug treatment. The
decision whether to pursue this path now, later, or never is one
that you’ll make with the help of your doctor. Among other things
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C 
14

to consider about combination treatment (see Chapter 8) are the
following:
 Combination interferon treatment can be long and costly, and
has the possibility of severe side effects.
 Between 50 and 80 percent of people who go through treatment
have success in that the hepatitis C virus becomes undetectable
in their body for at least six months after treatment. Some
doctors call this a “cure” because it can halt further damage
from hepatitis C virus. 
Alternative medical systems such as Eastern or traditional Chinese
medicine, ayurvedic medicine, and homeopathic and naturopathic
medicine also offer treatments that can be used instead of or
alongside Western medicine and that are less likely to result in
severe side effects. These alternatives, however, are also less likely
(as determined by the FDA) to eliminate the virus (see Chapter 10).
Medical care is increasingly incorporating both Western (tradi-
tional) medicine and Eastern (alternative or complementary) 
medicine in what’s called an integrated approach to healthcare.
Choosing healthy living
Regardless of whether you can take medical treatment or whether
it’s successful in eliminating your virus, you can still fight the
effects of hep C by making wise lifestyle choices, including the 
following suggestions:
 Eat healthful foods. Your liver and immune system need
nutrients from food to fight the virus and build new liver cells
(read about healthy eating in Chapter 11). Avoiding fatty, junk-
type foods will reduce symptoms of hep C.
 Avoid toxins. Products such as paint thinners, chemical
cleaners, pesticides, and many household cleaning products
are especially harmful for people with hep C. (See Chapter 12
for more on different types of toxins to stay away from.)
 Give up dangerous addictive habits. Say no to alcohol, 
smoking, and illegal drugs. Alcohol is especially damaging to
your liver. If you need help (and most people do) to end these
habits, check with your doctor or look into a substance-abuse
program (see Chapter 12 for the details).
 Take all medications with care. Some medicines, including
prescriptions and the over-the-counter variety, can harm your
liver (see Chapter 12). Check with your healthcare practitioner
to make sure they’re not hurting your liver.
Chapter 1: Conquering Hepatitis C 15

What you put into your body is one aspect of staying healthy. Also
important is what you do with your body. Movement of some sort,
whether it’s strenuous exercise, gentle stretching, or a mind-body-
spirit movement such as T’ai Chi or Yoga, is essential for good
health. Exercising your body keeps you limber and helps fight
depression and fatigue, two common symptoms of hepatitis C.
Chapter 13 focuses on the power of movement to help you feel
better and reduce stress. 
Letting others help you
Living with a chronic illness can feel frustrating, scary, and lonely.
You don’t have to live on an emotional roller coaster. Build a sup-
port team that includes the following members:
 Your physicians: See Chapter 5 for tips on finding and com-
municating with a liver specialist and other doctors.
 Friends, family, and neighbors: All these folks can help out
when you’re not feeling well. Chapter 19 talks about how
friends and family can help you.
 Spouse or partner: Discuss your concerns with your loved
ones. See Chapter 15 for tips on communicating with your
partner and strengthening other important relationships.
 Mental health professional: When the going gets too tough to
handle on your own, seek professional help. I give some tips
for finding a therapist in Chapter 14.
 A support group: You can get information and comfort from
discussions with other people with hepatitis C — either in
person or on the Internet. Chapter 14 tells you how to find a
support group near you.
Depression is a serious side effect of hepatitis C virus and the med-
ical treatment (interferon). Don’t neglect the signs of depression
(see Chapter 14). A professional can determine if you would bene-
fit from an antidepressant and/or counseling.
Getting Financial Support
Chronic hepatitis C symptoms can make you unable to work at
your usual pace or job, or even cause you to become disabled. To
get the most benefit from your health insurance, read your policy
carefully, and ask questions. You don’t necessarily have to tell your
boss you have hepatitis C. But if you want to be protected against
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C 
16

discrimination, your employer must know about your hepatitis C.
Sounds like a Catch-22, doesn’t it? See Chapter 16 for more informa-
tion on facing the financial challenges of hep C and the challenges
you may find in the workplace.
You need to know more about your insurance than the name and
phone number of the company. You need to know the nitty-gritty
details:
 What’s covered and what’s not, including medications, tests,
hospital visits, and mental health care
 The type of co-payments or deductibles you have
 The doctors you can visit
 How to change doctors
 A yearly maximum amount that’s covered
 Coverage of liver transplants
If you don’t have health insurance, you can get help with medical
treatment through clinics or Medicaid or by contacting the phar-
maceutical companies that make peginterferon plus ribavirin (see
Chapter 22).
Staying Organized with 
a Hep C Notebook
Keep your medical information and health records in a safe place.
You may need to show this documentation if you visit new health-
care practitioners or if you apply for life insurance or Social Security
disability. I provide a complete description of how to build a hep C
notebook in Chapter 5, but for now, here are the types of information
to save or record:
 Copies of all tests, which you should request at the time of the
test or from your doctor who ordered the test
 Dates and outcomes of all doctor visits
 A running list of your symptoms
 Medications, dates taken, side effects, and results
 Vitamins, herbs, and over-the-counter medicines you take
(see Chapter 12)
Chapter 1: Conquering Hepatitis C 17

You, and trusted friends or family members, are the true gatekeep-
ers of your health plan. I’m not talking about a health insurance
plan, but a plan to get better. Use this book to help you make the
choices that are right for you.
You’re More Than a Statistic
I kept the idea of individuality in mind as I wrote this book, and I
want you to keep it in mind, too. Every person with hepatitis C is 
a unique individual. From your biological makeup to your lifestyle,
you’re different from the next person.
Hep C isn’t a one-size-fits-all disease. There are real differences in the
way different people’s disease shows up or the way they respond to
treatment. So I provide specific information for children, women and
men, African Americans and Latinos, and other folks in Part IV of
this book. Make sure that your doctor has experience not only in
treating people with hepatitis C, but also in treating people who are
similar to you in age, ethnicity, lifestyle, and so on.
Even though I give you facts, figures, and information from studies
that are performed on groups of people, I still want you to remem-
ber that you are more than a number.
Therefore, because you’re you, your doctor and other healthcare
professionals who have an intimate knowledge of your specific situ-
ation are your best source of information. This book is meant to
provide you with the information that will let you carry on informed
conversations with your healthcare professionals and family mem-
bers and be your own best advocate.

Chapter 2
Talking about Transmission
In This Chapter
 Tracking transmission
 Keeping others safe
 Differentiating hepatitis C from other hepatitis viruses
S
imply put, any type of activity that allows the exchange of 
blood between people can serve as a way to spread hepatitis C.
Although the injection of illegal drugs is a primary means of trans-
mission, it’s not the only way to get the hepatitis C virus. Likewise,
to avoid giving hepatitis C virus to others means keeping your blood
safely away from other people. In this chapter, I discuss how trans-
mission of the hepatitis C virus through blood occurs so you can try
to understand how you got the virus and make sure that you don’t
spread it to anyone else.
But the hepatitis C virus isn’t the only virus that can cause hepatitis.
There are different hepatitis viruses (from A to E), each of which has
a different type of transmission. If you’re infected with more than
one hepatitis virus, the result can be more-serious symptoms and
different treatment approaches. In this chapter, I also outline each 
of these viruses so that you know where hepatitis C fits into the
scheme of things and you can learn how to protect yourself. Hint:
See your doctor about getting vaccinated against hepatitis A and B.
Tracing Hepatitis C Transmission
You’ll have many questions when you find out you have hepatitis C.
One of the most common is “How did I get this virus?” You may not
find out about your hep C infection until months or decades after
you were infected, and when all is said and done, about 10 percent
of folks aren’t sure how they got infected.

You may be upset or angry about how you got hep C. You’re not
alone. Get support to talk about your feelings (see Chapter 14). 
But to heal from hep C, how you got the virus isn’t as important as
what you do to treat yourself now, which I cover in Parts II and III.
Hepatitis C is transmitted by close contact with blood that’s con-
taminated with the hep C virus. The following sections outline the
various ways you might have gotten hep C.
Blood transfusions and other 
medical procedures
Because hepatitis C is spread through infected blood, any medical
procedure in which you received a blood transfusion or blood
product, or were exposed to even the slightest trace of blood,
could have put you at risk of infection.
Tests for the antibody (see Chapter 6) to the hepatitis C virus
became available in the early 1990s, and blood in the United States
and Canada was tested from that time onward. July 1992 is the offi-
cial date in the USA from which all blood sources were tested for
hepatitis C. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) reports that the likelihood of getting hep C from the blood
supply now is less than 1 chance per 1,000,000 blood units donated.
Here are other medical procedures or products that may have put
you at risk:
 Long-term kidney dialysis: Dialysis is considered a risk factor
because of the possibility of blood being present on the dialy-
sis machine.
 Reused needle for vaccination, acupuncture, or other med-
ical procedure: The needle could have traces of contaminated
blood.
 Organ transplant: The organ may have been contaminated
with hepatitis C virus from the donor. Donors are now tested
for hepatitis C virus.
 Receiving blood-clotting factor for hemophilia before 1987:
Starting in 1987, the factors were treated against HIV, which
also protected against hepatitis C virus.
Blood supplies in the United States, Canada, and other developed
countries are now tested against hepatitis C, but this isn’t neces-
sarily the case in developing parts of the world. Keep this fact in
mind if you travel to or live in certain countries (see Chapter 20 for
travel tips).

Injected street drugs
In the United States and other developed countries, injecting illegal
drugs is the leading source of current hep C infection. If you’ve
ever shared a needle or any part of the drug works, which includes
cotton, water, spoons, and anything else that may contain blood
from someone else — even if you didn’t see any blood — you may
have been exposed to hepatitis C.
Just using illegal drugs with shared syringes or works one time is
enough to get the hep C virus. 
Healthcare professionals who treat people with hep C shouldn’t
judge you for your past or current behavior that may have caused
your hep C. Read Chapter 5 for advice on finding a doctor whom
you can work with. If you’re still using drugs, see Chapter 12 for
advice on how to deal with your addiction.
Intranasal drug use
If you ever used straws or paper money to snort cocaine or other
drugs into your nose, you may have been exposed to hep C virus.
Blood can be exchanged in this way if the nasal membranes bleed
onto the shared item.
Mother to child
A woman who has hepatitis C virus in her blood has a low but defi-
nite risk of passing the virus to her child. On average, 5 percent of
children born to mothers with hepatitis C virus become infected
with the virus. There are no reports of transmission from mother
to child through breastfeeding. However, if a woman’s nipples are
cracked or bleeding, avoiding breastfeeding is the best course of
action. See Chapter 17 for information about hepatitis C infection
in children.
Sexual activity
Studies have shown that sexual transmission of hep C is rare but
possible. This topic has elicited some controversy, because some
studies show virtually no transmission of hep C virus between men
and women in long-term monogamous relationships. But it’s
believed that the risk of sexual transmission increases
Chapter 2: Talking about Transmission 21

 If you have multiple sex partners.
 If you have sexually transmitted diseases.
 If you’re exposed to blood during sex.
For tips on preventing sexual transmission, see the “Protecting
others from getting infected” section later in the chapter and check
out Chapter 15 for information on dealing with many aspects of
relationships, including sexual activity.
Sharing personal items
Things like toothbrushes, razors, cuticle scissors, and other 
personal items that come into contact with infected blood could
transmit hep C from one person to another.
Tattoos and piercings
Reusing needles or other sharp tools for tattoos or body piercings
could spread hep C infection. It’s also believed that using the same
tattoo inkpot, even with fresh needles, could spread hep C. For the
most part, scientific studies haven’t found tattoos or piercings to
be a major cause of hepatitis C infection in the United States. But
the risk can’t be ruled out as a potential source of infection, espe-
cially if you had a tattoo or piercing in an unsanitary setting, such
as in the military or in prison.
Occupational exposure
You risk exposure to hepatitis C if your work puts you in contact
with potentially infected blood. Healthcare workers (phlebotomists,
nurses, doctors, dentists, emergency medical technicians, and
others), public safety workers (fire-service and law enforcement),
and corrections officers may be exposed to blood on the job. 
Accidental needlestick injury is the most likely cause of exposure
to hepatitis C.
If you’ve been recently exposed to hepatitis C virus, seek medical
attention (see Chapter 5) immediately, because early treatment is
effective in eradicating the virus (see Chapter 8).
Ways that hep C is not transmitted
Hepatitis C virus is not transmitted during everyday activities and
casual contact. Hepatitis is transmitted through exposure to blood.
The hepatitis C virus is not spread in the following ways:
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C 
22

 Sneezing or coughing
 Hugging or kissing
 Sharing forks or other eating utensils
 Sharing drinking glasses
 Through food or water
 Holding hands
 Breastfeeding
Protecting Others from 
Getting Infected
However you got your hep C, be responsible, and take precautions
to prevent others from getting infected. The goal here is to achieve a
balance between being aware that you have an infectious virus but
not becoming paranoid. Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood.
Unless you’re a vampire who regularly deals with blood, I assume
that your blood is normally well inside your body. To be absolutely
careful and guard against infecting others, follow these tips:
 Don’t donate blood. But you may be able to donate body
organs to other hep C-infected people.
 Don’t let anyone else use your razor, toothbrush, manicure
scissors, or other personal-care items that may have blood 
on them. Be especially careful about keeping these items away
from children. Keep your toothbrush and toothpaste, which
may have some blood on it from your toothbrush, in a sepa-
rate drawer or cabinet.
 Cover open cuts or sores on your skin with bandages until
they have healed. Carry bandages on you, in your purse, or in
your vehicle so that you’re always prepared.
 Carefully dispose of anything that has been exposed to your
blood (from menstruation or a wound, for example).
 If you use illegal drugs, don’t share your needles or any para-
phernalia with anyone else. This precaution will also protect
you from getting other viruses, such as hepatitis B or HIV.
In addition, be responsible in your sexual activity.
If you’re in a monogamous relationship, your partner may want 
to get tested. Sexual transmission in these situations has been
found to be rare. But you may want to start using a latex condom.
Chapter 2: Talking about Transmission 23

Discuss sexual transmission with your healthcare practitioner and
your partner (see Chapter 15).
Your risk of spreading hepatitis C is greater if you have multiple
partners or are exposed to blood during sex. You may be exposed
to blood during sexual activity in these situations:
 When a woman is menstruating
 During rough sex in which one person bleeds
 During anal sex, which may damage the lining of the rectum
 When you or your partner has an open sore on the genitals
(from herpes or another sexually transmitted disease)
Hep C isn’t known to be spread through oral sex, but it’s theoreti-
cally possible if contact with blood occurs, which could happen if
you have sores on your genitals, bleeding gums, or abrasions from
shaving. To prevent this, try to avoid shaving, flossing, or brushing
your teeth before having sex. (Try a breath mint or gargling to
freshen your breath.)
Use male or female condoms to reduce your chances of getting
sexually transmitted diseases like HIV, gonorrhea, or syphilis, as
well as to protect from spreading hep C virus. There’s also a prod-
uct called a dental dam (a latex sheet) that can be used during oral
sex. Latex condoms are best studied for their ability to prevent
spread of virus, but some people have allergies to latex, in which
case polyurethane is the next-best option.
Safer sex means getting information on how sex can spread disease
or cause pregnancy, being honest with yourself and your partner
about your sexual desires and your risks for infection, and making
decisions for protection that work for both you and your partner.
Decisions about sex are individual, and your healthcare provider
can help you understand your situation (the infectious diseases
you have and how your particular sexual activities put you at risk)
so you can best protect yourself and your partner.
Reviewing the Hepatitis 
Virus ABCs
As I discuss in Chapter 1, the term hepatitis simply means inflam-
mation of the liver. But when you’re talking about hepatitis C,
you’re talking about viral hepatitis, and hep C isn’t the only form of
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C 
24

hepatitis caused by a virus. (Check out the “Examining other
causes of hepatitis” sidebar in this chapter for information on 
nonviral forms of hepatitis.)
So far, five different viruses have been found that cause hepatitis,
and they’re named with letters: Hepatitis A virus causes hepatitis
A; hepatitis B virus causes hepatitis B; hepatitis C virus causes
hepatitis C; and hepatitis E virus causes hepatitis E. Hepatitis D
virus is a special case, because it can’t infect you unless you also
have hepatitis B virus. The following sections provide a bit more
detail about each virus.
The different types of viral hepatitis have similar features but also
important differences. Depending on the hepatitis virus, the dis-
ease may be temporary — an acute form, which lasts less than a
year. With hepatitis B or C, though, infection can become chronic
and last for decades, or life, unless you undergo successful treat-
ment against the virus.
Chapter 2: Talking about Transmission 25
Examining other causes of hepatitis
Agents other than viruses can cause Inflammation of the liver, which is what the
word hepatitis means. Viral hepatitis is more common than most of these other types
of hepatitis, but I simply include this list so you know what else can cause hepati-
tis besides viruses.
 Alcoholic hepatitis is caused by alcohol damage to the liver. Alcohol damage
starts as alcoholic fatty liver disease, which can turn into hepatitis. If you con-
tinue to consume alcohol, you can get cirrhosis of the liver.
 Autoimmune hepatitis is a disease in which the body’s immune system attacks
liver cells. This disease may be inherited through your genes, and it affects
women more than men.
 Drug-induced hepatitis is caused by a severe liver reaction to over-the-counter
or prescription drugs. Some medicines can cause serious complications in the
liver when taken improperly, or even in some cases when taken properly. I list
some of these drugs in Chapter 12.
 Toxic hepatitis is caused by toxic chemical damage to the liver. This can happen
from an accidental exposure on the job or in the home to chemicals such as
cleaning fluids or pesticides. Poisonous mushrooms, when eaten in error, can
also cause toxic hepatitis.
People with hep C should avoid alcohol, dangerous drugs, and chemicals to pre-
vent further damaging the liver. See Chapter 12 for more information on avoiding
dangerous substances.

You’re considered to be infectious if you have the virus and can
possibly pass it to others — even if you don’t have any symptoms.
To read about hepatitis C symptoms, some of which are common
to all viral hepatitis, see Chapter 4.
Hepatitis A virus
Hepatitis A (also called infectious hepatitis) was identified in 1973.
Hepatitis A spreads through food or water that has been contami-
nated with infected feces (see Chapter 3 for more on how viruses
are transmitted). You can get hepatitis A from:
 Not washing your hands after exposure to feces: Examples
include not washing your hands after using the bathroom or
changing a diaper.
 Eating contaminated food: This situation can occur with
uncooked food and food prepared by someone who didn’t
wash his hands after using the toilet.
 Drinking contaminated water: Dealing with contaminated
water could be a problem when traveling; see Chapter 20 for
tips to avoid infection.
 Sexual contact with someone who’s infected: Practice safer
sex (see Chapter 15) and especially take care if you have anal
or oral–anal sex.
Hepatitis A causes an acute infection. In the United States, 200,000
cases of hepatitis A are reported yearly, and a third of all people
have already been exposed to hepatitis A virus at some point in
their lives but may not have known it. If you’ve been exposed to
hepatitis A in the past or gotten a vaccine, you’ll be immune, or
protected from future hepatitis A infection.
Hepatitis B virus
The hepatitis B virus (serum hepatitis) was found in 1963 and
spreads through contact with infected body fluids (including saliva,
vaginal fluid, and semen) and blood. You can get hepatitis B from
 Injection drug use
 Unprotected sex
 Transmission from mother to child during birth
 The razor or toothbrush of an infected person
 Occupational exposure of healthcare workers or emergency
personnel to infected blood or body fluids
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C 
26

Hepatitis B can cause an acute or chronic infection, but chronic
infection occurs in only approximately 5 percent of cases. A hepati-
tis B vaccine protects against hepatitis B (and hepatitis D; see the
corresponding section below for more information on this virus
that can make hepatitis B disease worse).
Hepatitis C virus
The hepatitis C virus was discovered in 1989. For decades before
that, it was called “non-A non-B” hepatitis because researchers knew
that it wasn’t caused by the other known hepatitis viruses at the
time. Hep C is transmitted through blood (see the section “Tracing
Hepatitis C Transmission,” earlier in this chapter), and 75 to 85 per-
cent of people infected will have a chronic infection, which puts
them at risk for cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure over many
decades of infection. No vaccine is available for hepatitis C, so pre-
vention is the key to avoiding infection.
Hep C infection can last a lifetime, so you need to take good care of
yourself physically, emotionally, and financially, as I explain in Part
III of the book. Medical research is ongoing to develop more effec-
tive drugs with fewer side effects. Currently, combination therapy
with two drugs — pegylated interferon and ribavirin — is the best
treatment, but it doesn’t work for everyone (see Chapter 8). Check
out Chapter 3 for an in-depth discussion of the virus.
Hepatitis D virus
Hepatitis D was discovered in 1977 and is an incomplete virus that
can’t infect you on its own; it has to tag along with hepatitis B
virus. When it does, it can produce more-severe hepatitis B dis-
ease. Transmission of hepatitis D is the same as for hepatitis B.
Vaccination against hepatitis B prevents hepatitis D infection, too.
Hepatitis E virus
The hepatitis E virus was discovered in 1983 as another hepatitis
virus that’s transmitted through contamination of water with feces.
Outbreaks of hepatitis E occur primarily in developing countries in
Africa, Asia, and Central America due to unsanitary water supplies.
Hepatitis E is rare in Canada, the United States, and other devel-
oped countries.
Hepatitis E is an acute infection. For some as-yet-unexplained
reason, pregnant women appear to be at risk of a more severe 
disease when infected with hepatitis E. Follow the guidelines in
Chapter 20 to avoid getting hepatitis E during foreign travel.
Chapter 2: Talking about Transmission 27

Other hepatitis viruses
Researchers believe that most people with viral hepatitis have one
of the hepatitis viruses from A to E. But scientists are always on
the lookout for new viruses that can cause disease. The viruses
called hepatitis G virus (HGV), TTV (transfusion transmitted
virus), and sentinel viruses (SEN) have all been discovered in the
blood of people with hepatitis. But it’s not absolutely clear that
these viruses actually cause hepatitis. Hepatitis F is a name for a
virus that’s no longer thought to cause hepatitis.
Hepatitis virus co-infections
Having another hepatitis virus infection in addition to hepatitis C
can cause more serious symptoms or difficulties in treatment:
 Hepatitis A: If you have hepatitis C and then get hepatitis A,
you’re more at risk of getting a severe and life-threatening form
of hepatitis A called fulminant hepatitis. In other words, already
having hepatitis C can make your hepatitis A disease worse.
Get vaccinated against hepatitis A to avoid this problem.
 Hepatitis B: Hepatitis C and hepatitis B are both transmitted by
blood, and both can cause a chronic long-term illness, although
hep C is more likely than hep B to be chronic. Scientists are still
trying to figure out how having both of these hepatitis viruses
over a long period of time will affect your health. It’s especially
important that you see a liver-specialist doctor to help sort
through the complexities of both of these hepatitis infections
(for tips on finding a doctor, see Chapter 5). If you have hep C
but don’t currently have hepatitis B, get vaccinated against
hepatitis B to protect yourself from future infection.
Co-infection with hepatitis C is common in people with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV); see Chapter 18 for information on
dealing with this co-infection.

Let’s Get Ready to Rumble:
Hepatitis C versus Your
Immune System
In This Chapter
 Meeting the hepatitis C virus
 Watching the virus grow
 Viewing your immune system’s response
V
iruses are so small that you need a special microscope to see
them. But size doesn’t stop the hepatitis C virus from infecting
the liver and creating havoc. After the virus infects, your immune
system kicks in to try to fight the infection. Unfortunately, the body’s
immune system successfully eliminates only a small portion of hep
C infections (about 15 to 25 percent). Most folks develop a chronic,
or longer-term, infection that causes liver disease.
In this chapter, I fill you in on the mechanics of the hepatitis virus
and how your body responds to it. I tell you what exactly hepatitis
C virus is, what it does to trick the immune system, and why the
immune system often fails to control the hep C infection.
Knowing what’s going on with their body and disease at the smallest
level appeals to many folks facing long-term illness. If you fall into
this group, you’ll dig this chapter. Others can take or leave some of
the more technical-sounding info. If you fall into this group, you may
want to simply skim over this chapter; that way, you’ll at least know
that the info is here, should you need it in the future.

When Viruses Attack
Virus infection (like hepatitis C infection, for example) starts off at 
a really tiny level, when a single virus infects a single cell. But from
there, things quickly get out of control: Within hours, thousands of
new viruses are formed from the one infected cell (see the “Tracking
the Hepatitis C Virus Life Cycle” section, later in this chapter).
Infection caused by even a small amount of virus multiplies
quickly. Viruses can’t multiply without the help of your cells.
The cell is the basis of all life — from the simple amoeba to a flower
to your body. The human body has trillions of distinct cells that
ultimately do things like digest your breakfast cereal or protect you
from the cold virus going around town. Tiny cells get such large
jobs done by working together. Cells work to form tissues, which
work together to form organs, which work with other organs and
cells to form systems (like your digestive and immune systems).
The cell of interest with hepatitis C is the liver cell. Millions of liver
cells, or hepatocytes, make up the liver, which is one of the organs of
the digestive system. But the liver also contributes to the immune,
circulatory, and excretory systems. (For more information on the
liver and liver cells, see Chapter 4.)
Picturing the hep C virus
So what’s a virus, you may wonder. A virus is actually a small parti-
cle that infects cells. Biologists debate whether a virus is really
alive because viruses can’t live on their own. A virus must find a
host cell. Unfortunately, your liver cells become the host for hep C
virus.
The virus job description is straightforward: make more copies of
itself (reproduce). Because they need to get into the host cell in
order to reproduce, viruses have evolved tricky ways of entering
the host cell and taking over to make more viruses.
Take a look at Figure 3-1 for an idea of what the hepatitis C virus
looks like. Hepatitis C contains the basic viral components that all
viruses have:
 Viral genes: Viral genes can come as DNA, like our own genes,
or as a related nucleic acid called RNA. The hep C virus has
RNA genes.
 Viral capsid: This protein coat (or shell) holds the viral genes
(RNA for hep C). The capsid is sometimes called the core 
protein.
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C 
30

For more protection and to help them replicate, many viruses,
including hepatitis C, also have the following:
 Viral envelope: This protein–lipid (fat) membrane surrounds
the capsid and gives added protection. In the case of hepatitis
C, the envelope is made of proteins called E1 and E2.
 Viral enzymes: Not shown in Figure 3-1 are the special enzymes
made by the virus. Hep C doesn’t carry these enzymes around,
but makes them when it gets into your cells. Because viral
enzymes are essential to the virus, many of them, such as viral
protease (which breaks up viral protein into useable pieces),
are targets for development of anti-hepatitis C drugs.
Figure 3-1: Hepatitis C virus.
Hitting the road to find host cells
Viral transmission is the way viruses move from one person to
another. Viruses zip from one host to another in different ways.
The following list contains some means of transmission for the 
different hepatitis viruses and the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV). For more information on the different types of hepatitis
viruses and how hep C is transmitted, see Chapter 2.
 Food or water contaminated with infected feces: Hepatitis A
and hepatitis E.
 Blood from infected person: Hepatitis B and hepatitis C and
HIV. Because these three viruses share a route of transmis-
sion, it’s possible to get more than one of these viruses.
 Body fluids (semen, vaginal fluid, breast milk, and saliva)
from infected person: Hepatitis B and HIV. Note: Hepatitis C is
not thought to be spread through body fluids, though it may
be present.

Chapter 3: Hepatitis C versus Your Immune System 31

Viruses are picky about their host species. A human virus won’t
want to live in a plant, or even a cat. And viruses have definite
“room” or cell-type preferences within the body, as shown in these
examples of different types of viruses:
 Influenza viruses: Respiratory tract
 HIV: T cells
 Hepatitis virus: Liver
 Wart viruses (papilloma viruses): Skin
 Rabies virus: Nerves
Some viruses, like the hepatitis C virus and HIV, infect other cells in
the body too, though not as much as they infect their cell of choice.
Preliminary studies on the hepatitis C virus show it may infect brain
cells or some cells of the immune system.
Tracking the Hepatitis C 
Virus Life Cycle
Just as you have a cycle of life from birth to death and everything
in between, viruses have a recognizable life cycle — although it
takes place in hours rather than years.
Following the steps of cell infection
The following is a brief description of the stages of hepatitis C
virus infection identified by scientists. (All viruses follow similar
steps.) Follow along by using Figure 3-2.
1. The hep C virus attaches to the liver cell.
Hep C attaches by recognizing and binding to one or more
proteins on the cell surface, called viral receptors, which
are normal cell proteins that the virus has evolved to use
as its doorway into the cell.
2. Hep C enters the liver cell.
After binding to its receptor, the virus crosses the cell mem-
brane with the help of its receptor and moves into the liver
cell, leaving its envelope outside as it enters.
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C 
32

3. Hep C “uncoats.”
When hep C gets inside the cell, the first thing it does is
take off its capsid (protein coat) so the viral RNA can get to
business.
4. Hep C makes viral proteins and replicates RNA.
Hep C takes over the cells’ machinery to make new virus
proteins, including enzymes, the viral capsid, and the viral
envelope. The enzymes help make copies of the RNA genes.
This new RNA will be the viral genes for the newly created
viruses. This step is called replication.
5. Hep C puts together new viruses.
Envelope, capsid, and RNA are assembled to make new
hepatitis C viruses, a step known as hep C reproduction.
6. New hep C viruses exit the cell.
Newly released viruses may infect nearby liver cells or go
into the blood. If you have hep C viruses in your blood,
your viral RNA tests will be positive (see Chapter 6 for a
discussion of viral tests).

Chapter 3: Hepatitis C versus Your Immune System 33

Scientists have been hampered in studying the hep C viruses
because growing hep C outside the body was difficult. New devel-
opments mean that more information about the nitty-gritty of
hep C infection is being discovered, which helps in drug therapy
development. The steps outlined above are intensely studied by
researchers who are looking for ways to block one of these steps.
Changing the virus genes
The hepatitis C virus is so successful at staying in your body
because it can subtly change its genes. (These subtle changes are
called mutations.) This little devil of a virus has figured out how 
to escape from your body’s normal ways of attacking it (see the
“Fighting Back: The Immune System Responds” section, later in
this chapter).
Because of all this changing around, hep C viruses aren’t exactly
the same from person to person. Here’s a list of the types of varia-
tions scientists find in the hepatitis C virus:
 A genotype is a distinct group of a hepatitis virus. Six different
genotypes have been identified, which I describe in Chapter 6.
They’re called genotypes 1 through 6.
 A subtype is a subdivision among different genotypes. There
are at least 30 different subtypes of hepatitis C. For example,
genotype 1a and genotype 1b are subtypes of genotype 1.
 If you hear the term quasispecies, don’t get frightened. The
term just means that within any batch of virus, there are lots
of slightly different viruses, but these differences are too
slight to be called a genotype or subtype.
Hepatitis C virus may use these changes in virus genes to stay
alive despite attack from the immune system or antiviral drugs. For
example, certain genotypes are more resistant to drug treatment
(see Chapter 8).
Fighting Back: The Immune
System Responds
Now I’m going to delve into the immune system, which is what your
body uses to fight against the hepatitis C virus. In this section, I
describe some of the basics and try to explain why the human
immune system doesn’t always work against hepatitis C (scientists
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C 
34

are still figuring that one out). It’s also important to recognize that
your immune system actually causes much of the disease with 
hepatitis C.
The immune system protects you by detecting and destroying 
“foreigners,” such as viruses and cancer cells. As with many wars,
the immune system’s fight against infection can seem like an end-
less battle, with fatalities on both sides. The immune system uses
an intricate network of cells and proteins that work together to
form the immune response. When you’re protected from a foreign
agent, you’re said to be immune, or to have immunity from that 
foreign agent.
Immunization and vaccination mean the same thing and refer to the
procedure whereby pieces of a foreign agent (antigen) are intro-
duced to your immune system in the hope of inducing long-lasting
immunity. Of the hepatitis viruses, vaccines are available only for
hepatitis A and hepatitis B.
Getting to know the players
The immune system uses organs such as the thymus and spleen,
as well as tissues in your lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver, and
intestines. But the major players are cells and molecules, which I
now describe:
 Antigen: Small segments on each “foreigner” (called antigens)
are recognized by the immune system. Antigens are part of
the signal for the immune system to attack. The hepatitis C
virus has multiple antigens.
 T and B cells (lymphocyte): These are the cells that go after
antigen. Each lymphocyte recognizes one specific antigen out
of the millions of possible antigens it could run up against.
Here are the background and job description for these impor-
tant cells:
• B cells mature in the bone marrow, which is the spongy
inside part of bones. They make antibodies, which are 
Y-shaped proteins that bind to antigen. Another name
for antibody is immunoglobulin.
• T cells mature in the thymus, which is located under-
neath the ribs high in the chest. Two types of T cells
are: the T helper cell, which helps B cells make anti-
body, and the T killer cell, which directly kills virus-
infected cells.
Chapter 3: Hepatitis C versus Your Immune System 35

 Cytokines: Messenger proteins that signal other cells of the
immune system or other cells in the body. Interferon, used 
as a drug to kill hepatitis C virus, is one type of cytokine.
Cytokines can be made by any white blood cell, whether 
specific for antigen or not.
See Figure 3-3 for an idea of how these players fit together to give
an immune response that is specific to hepatitis C antigen. When
the virus is inside of your liver cells, T killer cells attack during
what’s called a cell-mediated immune response. When the virus is
roaming your body on its own, the antibody-mediated immune
response sends antibody to bind to the virus to keep it from infect-
ing your cells. 
There’s also another part of the immune response, called the innate
response, that uses cytokines and white blood cells to fight against
hepatitis C. Scientists are researching both of these types of immune
responses — specific and innate — to learn why some people can
eliminate hepatitis C virus on their own and others do not.
Because the immune system must do its work all over the body, or
wherever a virus might be, the cells and molecules of the immune
response must be able to move around and get together, which
they do through the blood and lymph.

Examining the blood
Blood is a mixture of cells and liquid that travels through your
arteries and veins, pumped by the heart. The components of blood
include:
 Red blood cells (RBC): The RBC carry oxygen through the
body.
 White blood cells (WBC): These agents of the immune
response include lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils,
eosinophils, and basophils. If you have a WBC count per-
formed on your blood (see Chapter 7), the levels of each of
these cells are tested.
 Platelets: They help in blood clotting.
 Plasma: Cells float in this liquid (also called serum), which
contains nutrients and proteins like albumin and fibrinogen,
which are both made by the liver (see Chapter 4), and antibod-
ies that circulate to protect you against infection.
I talk about blood throughout the book. Hepatitis C is transmitted
through blood; if you have hep C, you’ll have lots of blood tests;
when you’re on drug treatment, you’ll be checked for problems with
your blood (anemia); and blood-clotting problems can arise with 
cirrhosis. If you want to know more about blood, check out an edu-
cational course on blood (hematology) put on the Web by the Puget
Sound Blood Center (www.psbc.org/education/hematology).
Describing lymph
Lymph is a clear liquid that moves through a special circulatory
system of lymphatic vessels and bathes tissues of the body. Lymph
vessels pass through strategic tissues and organs, including your
lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and intestines (see Figure 3-4).
The purpose of the lymph system is to bring together antigen and
cells of the immune system. The lymph nodes are a meeting place
for the immune system to launch its attack.
Battling the hep C infection
The hep C virus and your immune system each do their best to 
win the battle of infection. Hep C wants to stay in your body. Your
immune system wants hep C to leave. Hep C mutates to avoid your
immune system (see the section “Changing the virus genes,” ear-
lier in this chapter).
Chapter 3: Hepatitis C versus Your Immune System 37

Figure 3-4: The lymphatic system.
The immune system reacts to hep C infection by increasing blood
flow, bringing in white blood cells, and closing off the infected area,
all in the effort to control the infection and prevent its spread. These
defensive actions cause inflammation of the liver. For most folks
with hep C, inflammation doesn’t appear to control the infection;
rather, it actually damages the liver cells.
The damage caused by temporary inflammation can be reversed.
When inflammation continues, however, the liver replaces its dam-
aged cells with scar tissue (fibrosis). Continued scarring leads to
cirrhosis or irreversible liver damage.
Your immune response, which is supposed to protect you from hep
C infection, may thus — in its overly zealous but ultimately mis-
guided response — contribute to liver disease. The goal of medical
treatment against hep C is to help the body fight hep C infection so
that inflammation stops.
You can keep your immune system in tip-top shape by eating well,
avoiding toxins, and staying calm — advice that I discuss in Part III.

Infecting the Liver: Symptoms
and Progression of the
Disease
In This Chapter
 Describing the liver and its functions
 Understanding hep C symptoms
 Seeing how the disease progresses
Your liver is an essential organ. Sitting in the center of your
body, the liver processes the food you eat and eliminates 
poisons. When hepatitis C infects liver cells, any of the liver’s 
hundreds of functions can be affected.
Hepatitis C symptoms let you know your body needs help. You
may have symptoms that range from none or annoying to serious
or life-threatening. Treatment in the early stages of hep C can pro-
tect you from developing liver failure or liver cancer (see Chapters 8
and 10). If treatment doesn’t work, or if you find out about your
hep C at a later stage, you still have options for your healthcare
and lifestyle that can improve your symptoms and quality of life
(see Part III). In this chapter, I give you basic information about the
liver and hepatitis C disease.

Looking at Your Liver
The liver is a powerhouse of an organ, performing its jobs 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week. When you find out you have hepatitis C and
start experiencing symptoms as a result of your liver infection,
you’re going to want to know all you can about this essential
organ.
Mapping it out
The human liver weighs in at a smooth 3 pounds and is about the
size of a football, making it your biggest internal organ. To visualize
its shape, you could take a trip to a supermarket and look at some
animal livers in the meat department. Or a much simpler avenue of
exploration is to check out Figure 4-1.
You can’t really feel your liver by poking at your torso, because it’s
located under the bottom of the rib cage — on the right side, under
the diaphragm. Your stomach and spleen are next door to your
liver, and the gallbladder, small intestine, and right kidney are just
beneath it.
Figure 4-1: Looking closely at your liver.

Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C 
40

Your liver is filled with blood, fed by the portal vein (which delivers
nutritious blood from the digestive tract) and the hepatic artery
(which brings oxygenated blood from the heart).
In addition to all the blood vessels in the liver, there are vessels for
the biliary system, which is made up of bile ducts and the gallblad-
der. One function of the biliary system is to drain the liver of waste
products by way of the bile ducts. The liver makes bile, which is a
thick greenish fluid that contains bile salts, cholesterol, and liver
waste. Bile goes to your gallbladder, which acts as a storage area.
When you eat a meal, the second main function of the biliary system
kicks in. Bile is sent from the gallbladder to the small intestine so
that the bile salts can be used to digest the fats you eat. Bile, carry-
ing the liver’s waste products, leaves the intestines through the
feces and is responsible for the brown color of feces.
De-livering function
The liver is a master organ, performing more than 500 essential
jobs. When hep C causes liver damage, any of the following tasks of
the liver may be affected. The more serious the damage by hep C,
as in cirrhosis, the more serious the effect will be on liver function
(see the section “Cirrhosis,” later in this chapter). In the following
sections, I group the liver’s 500-plus jobs into four main categories.
Processing plant
Most things you ingest, be they food or medications, need to be
processed into forms that the body can use. Two examples are:
 Carbohydrates from food are turned into glucose (a form of
sugar) for instant energy, and then glucose is converted to
glycogen for storage. When blood sugar levels drop, glycogen
is converted back to glucose.
 Normal processing of protein in the body leads to production
of ammonia. The liver takes the toxic ammonia and converts
it to urea, which is then eliminated in urine.
Production facility
The liver is like a production factory, making hormones, proteins,
and other substances essential to the body.
Here’s a list of some of the proteins made by the liver. Your doctor
can test your blood for these proteins, and when levels are low,
this is an indicator of liver impairment (see Chapter 7).
 Albumin: This is the major protein in the blood. When the
liver is impaired, albumin levels drop. Low albumin levels
may contribute to the problem of edema, or swelling.
Chapter 4: Symptoms and Progression of the Disease 41

 Enzymes: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and other enzymes
(see Chapter 7) are used by the liver to convert substances to
usable forms.
 Blood-clotting proteins: You need these proteins so you don’t
bleed to death. One of these proteins is called prothrombin,
and the prothrombin time test (called PT) measures how long
it takes your blood to clot. 
But the liver production process isn’t limited to proteins. It also
produces other molecules, such as cholesterol. In fact, the liver
makes 85 percent of all cholesterol, and cholesterol is necessary
for the body to make sex hormones, bile salts, and vitamin D.
The liver makes bile, a fluid that moves through the biliary system,
described in the section “Looking at Your Liver,” earlier in this
chapter. Bile helps your body use fats and vitamins, and breaks
down excess cholesterol. When the liver is damaged, bile builds 
up in the body, and the bilirubin causes the yellow coloring of 
jaundice. Chapter 7 discusses tests for bilirubin.
Storage space and filtration system
The liver is a warehouse, and within its cells, essential nutrients
are stored that are released when needed. Sugar is stored as glyco-
gen for energy, and the liver also stores vitamins and minerals —
vitamin A and iron, for example.
The liver also filters toxic waste that reaches it from the blood 
and also the waste it creates as it processes substances. Toxins
(poisons) are then sent out of the body through urine or feces.
Experiencing Symptoms
Symptoms are the body’s way of telling you to pay attention. If 
you have hep C virus, you may be asymptomatic, meaning that you
have no symptoms at all, or you may have symptoms that are mild
or initially confused with other illnesses.
Soon after you first become infected with the hep C virus, you may
have flu-like symptoms or even jaundice (abnormally yellow skin or
eyes) during the acute phase (within the first six months) of infec-
tion. Most people in the acute phase don’t notice any symptoms.
When your disease becomes chronic (after six months), you may
develop some of the following symptoms in the months or even
decades after infection. 
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C 
42

You probably won’t have all of these symptoms, but being aware of
possible symptoms is good, so if one of them does occur, you’ll
recognize it. Keep in mind that some symptoms happen as a func-
tion of aging, stress, or menopause. And as I mention throughout
the book, each person with hepatitis C is an individual, and your
symptoms depend on so many factors.
 Fatigue: In a class of its own, the most commonly reported
symptom
 Digestive problems: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloating, gas,
indigestion, abdominal pain, loss of appetite
 Emotional problems: Depression, anxiety, mood swings
 Flu-like symptoms: Headache, low-grade fever, night sweats,
chills, joint and muscle pain, weakness
 Hormonal problems: More intense premenstrual tension or
menopausal symptoms, irregular periods, loss of sex drive,
erectile dysfunction
 Jaundice: Yellowing of skin or eyes, dark urine, pale or clay-
colored stools
 Skin problems: Dry skin, itchy skin, bruising, reddened palms,
red spidery spots, swelling of your hands, feet, or face
 Sleep problems: Insomnia, night sweats
 Thinking problems: Brain fog, encephalopathy (severe brain
problems with cirrhosis)
I list some more specific symptoms of cirrhosis and end stage liver
diseases in the corresponding sections for these conditions later in
the chapter.
Your hep C may directly cause some symptoms; others may be
side effects of medications or the result of worrying about your 
illness. Like the chicken and the egg, it doesn’t matter what came
first. If you have symptoms as described above, or any others, tell
your physician. Working with your doctor, you can deal with your
symptoms. (I cover the treatment options and tips for working
with your doctor in Part II.)
Now — today — is the time to implement changes in your diet 
and lifestyle that will help you deal with some of these symptoms.
Trying the mind-body therapies and light exercise described in
Chapter 13 may reduce stress and ease symptoms like insomnia,
anxiety, and fatigue. Eating well and avoiding fried foods can help
Chapter 4: Symptoms and Progression of the Disease 43

with many of the gastrointestinal problems (see Chapter 11 for
more on nutrition). Your support group also may have tips for
dealing with the symptoms of hep C (see Chapter 14). You need
not suffer — and certainly not in silence!
Describing the Progression 
of Hepatitis C
Hepatitis C virus infection is classified into two distinct phases:
acute and chronic. What distinguishes hepatitis C from other hepa-
titis viruses (see Chapter 2) is the fact that the virus infection
becomes chronic in about 75 to 85 percent of folks infected. See
Figure 4-2 for a representation of hepatitis C disease progression
that I cover in this section.
The acute phase
The time period up to six months after you’re infected with the
hepatitis C virus is called the acute phase of hep C disease. At this
point, many people don’t know they’re infected, but some folks
experience flu-like symptoms (such as fever, aches, and tiredness)
or jaundice-related symptoms (such as yellowing skin, dark urine,
and light stools).
A rare complication during acute infection is called fulminant
hepatic failure, which means liver failure and requires emergency
medical attention.
If you clear (or get rid of) the virus at this stage, you won’t develop
the chronic phase of hep C, described in the following section.
About 15 to 25 percent of people infected are able to stop the virus
in its tracks during the acute phase. But the majority of people go
on to have a chronic infection. Researchers are studying why some
people launch an immune response that can successfully block
hep C. (I cover the immune response to hepatitis C in Chapter 3.)
If you’ve successfully eliminated hepatitis C virus, you’ll still make
antibodies to hep C and have a positive hep C antibody test (see
Chapter 6 for more details). Your RNA test (the test that tells you 
if hepatitis C virus is currently present) will be negative, and your
antibodies will probably not protect you from future infection with
hepatitis C, so take precautions not to get reinfected.
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C 
44

The chronic phase
At six months and more after infection, your disease is considered
to be chronic. Approximately 75 to 85 percent of people with hepa-
titis C develop chronic infection. I outline the possible phases of
chronic hepatitis C in Figure 4-2 and describe them in the next 
sections in order of progression — from no liver damage to inflam-
mation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, or end stage liver disease.
The following factors have been shown to contribute to more
severe disease progression:
 Being over 40 at the time of infection
 Being male 
 Drinking alcohol
 Being co-infected with hepatitis B or HIV
 Having fatty liver disease (see Chapter 11)

hepatitis C disease.

Chapter 4: Symptoms and Progression of the Disease 45

You can’t change the fact that you’re over 40, you’re a man, or
you’re already infected with hepatitis B or HIV. But you can avoid
getting infected with these viruses (see Chapter 2 for a discussion
of transmission through blood or body fluids). And stopping drink-
ing is probably the single most important change you can make to
save your liver (see Chapter 12).
Liver cancer is a complication that can occur when you have 
cirrhosis. And diseases outside the liver can also develop with 
hepatitis C virus. I cover these conditions later in the chapter.
Inflammation and fibrosis
The earliest phase of hep C disease is liver inflammation. (Hepatitis
literally means inflammation of the liver.) Inflammation occurs when
immune cells enter the liver to kill the hep C virus. The fight put up
by the immune cells damages liver cells (see Chapter 2).
If unstopped, over a period of time, the inflammation can turn into
scarring, which is called fibrosis. The liver can recover from inflam-
mation and minor scarring, but continued scarring leads to problems
with liver function and possibly irreversible scarring, which is called
cirrhosis (see the corresponding section later in the chapter).
If you have inflammation or fibrosis, it’s important to get regular
monitoring from your physician; you may need tests to see whether
you’re slipping into further liver damage.
How do you know whether you have it?
Liver enzyme tests are only an indirect measure of liver damage.
To directly see what your liver looks like, a small piece of your
liver is examined from a biopsy (see Chapter 7 for more on liver
tests). Under the microscope, your liver is analyzed for the degree
of inflammation or fibrosis.
What can you do about it?
If you find out that you have liver inflammation or fibrosis, stay
calm, and review your options. Pharmaceutical treatment involves
combination interferon treatment (see Chapter 8). Additional
options include acupuncture and herbal treatment (see Chapter 10),
diet changes (see Chapter 11), lifestyle changes (see Chapter 13),
and a positive outlook (see Chapter 14).
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C 
46

Cirrhosis
When fibrosis becomes extensive over the whole liver, you have
cirrhosis. Around 20 percent of people with chronic hepatitis C
get cirrhosis of the liver after decades of infection. Cirrhosis was
called irreversible liver scarring in the past, but it’s now thought
that early stages of cirrhosis may be reversible. Cirrhosis is called
compensated if the normal liver cells make up for the damage.
When cirrhosis is decompensated, your liver is starting to fail
(see the next section on liver failure). 
With cirrhosis, you may have the following symptoms:
 Ascites (buildup of fluid in the abdomen)
 Swelling of the legs
 Small red blood vessels on the skin
 Bleeding hemorrhoids
 Decreased urination
 Nosebleed or bleeding gums 
 Breast development in men
 Severe itching (buildup of uncleared toxins)
 Bone loss
Symptoms of cirrhosis can become life-threatening as cirrhosis
develops into liver failure. If you’re vomiting blood or experiencing
chest pains, get emergency medical care.
How do you know whether you have it?
Abnormal results of liver tests can point to cirrhosis, especially
in decompensated cirrhosis. Tests of albumin, bleeding times 
(prothrombin), and bilirubin tell a lot about how your liver is 
functioning. A biopsy reveals the extent of damage to your liver.
What can you do about it?
If you have compensated cirrhosis, consider more aggressive 
treatment for your hep C, if you haven’t already done so. Don’t
drink alcohol, and do everything you can to save your liver —
and your life. For decompensated cirrhosis, see the next section,
“Liver failure.”
When you have cirrhosis, it’s important to get tested regularly for
liver cancer and liver function.
Chapter 4: Symptoms and Progression of the Disease 47

Liver failure
Continuing cirrhosis can lead to liver failure. End-stage liver disease
(ESLD) and decompensated cirrhosis are ways of describing irre-
versible scarring that keeps the liver from functioning, a condition
known as liver failure. About 20 percent of people with cirrhosis
develop end stage liver disease. The following can result from liver
failure:
 Portal hypertension: Within a scarred liver, blood can’t flow
normally, which results in portal hypertension. Your portal vein
(see Figure 4-1), which normally carries blood to the liver, gets
slowed down, and pressure inside the vein increases. Higher
blood pressure (hypertension) in the portal vein is called portal
hypertension. Because other blood vessels must take blood back
to the heart, they become swollen due to increased blood flow,
resulting in what’s called varices, or thin walls in blood vessels
that can easily break and bleed, which you may experience as
vomiting blood.
 Ascites: This condition results from fluid buildup in your
abdominal cavity. Ascites are a complication of portal hyper-
tension and other factors. They’re treated with diuretics and
other medications. To help alleviate the condition, avoid salty
foods (see Chapter 11).
 Encephalopathy: Brain and nervous system damage can
result from liver failure. You may have problems with reflexes,
personality changes, or loss of consciousness.
How do you know whether you have it?
Different blood tests (albumin, prothrombin time, and bilirubin)
indicate the seriousness of your illness. At this stage, the symptoms
are so obvious that a doctor who is knowledgeable about liver dis-
ease will immediately recognize the severity of your disease.
What can you do about it?
Stay calm, and get referred for a liver transplant (see Chapter 9).
While waiting for a new liver, watching your diet and lifestyle is
especially important.
Liver cancer
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or hepatoma, is more common in
other parts of the world and occurs mainly with hepatitis virus B
Part I: Understanding and Exposing Hepatitis C 
48

or C in Canada and the United States. HCC is a primary liver
cancer, meaning that it develops in the liver and isn’t a secondary
cancer that moves to the liver from elsewhere in the body (called
metastasis). Between 1 and 4 percent of people with cirrhosis
develop liver cancer each year. 
How do you know whether you have it?
If you have cirrhosis, you should be monitored for development 
of liver cancer. A blood test called alpha-fetoprotein can detect
cancer in some people. Liver scans and biopsies are used to detect
tumors (see Chapter 7). Speak to your doctor about having regular
scans if you have cirrhosis.
What can you do about it?
Early-stage liver cancer is easier to treat with surgery than later-
stage cancer. Resection surgery, in which the liver tumors are
removed, or transplant surgery, in which the liver is entirely
replaced, can both be performed. Transplant surgery has a better
longer-term success rate, but donor livers are in short supply.
(See Chapter 9 for more on transplants.) For later-stage cancer,
drug treatment trials are an option (see Chapter 8 for some infor-
mation on clinical trials).
Diseases outside the liver
Illnesses that aren’t directly due to liver damage are called extra-
hepatic manifestations of hep C infection. About 1 or 2 percent of
people with hepatitis C virus get these extrahepatic diseases.
In the process of fighting the hep C virus, your body produces anti-
bodies that might hurt the body by causing autoimmune reactions,
which means fighting the body, or an accumulation of antibody to
such a degree that it “clogs up” parts of the body. The following are
thought to be caused by the immune response to hep C infection:
 Cryoglobulinemia: Results from the buildup of clumps of hep-
atitis C virus bound to antibody (antibody complexes). These
antibody complexes can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, and
nerves. The name cryo means cold, and globulin is antibody.
In the laboratory, these antibodies clump up in the cold.
 Glomerulonephritis: Kidney inflammation caused by the anti-
body complexes being deposited in the internal structures of
the kidney (glomeruli), causing an inflammation of the kidney.
Chapter 4: Symptoms and Progression of the Disease 49

Another type of extrahepatic disease caused by hep C is porphyria
cutanea tarda (PCT). This illness occurs because the liver isn’t
making a particular enzyme, and it can lead to blistering in areas 
of the skin exposed to sunlight. To learn more about PCT, check
out www.porphyriafoundation.com.
Scientists are studying whether other diseases, such as thyroid
disorders and lichen planus, a disorder of the skin, are caused by
hep C. Hep C may possibly infect other types of cells in addition 
to liver cells, which may cause certain symptoms of hepatitis C 
or contribute to other diseases. Research is ongoing to see which
other illnesses are linked to hep C.
How do you know whether you have it?
New symptoms, such as problems with your skin or urination, can
alert your doctor to a problem. There are specific blood tests for
cryoglobulins. An examination of your urine or a kidney biopsy can
check for glomerulonephritis. PCT can be determined by testing
your urine and blood. 
What can you do about it?
Interferon or steroids may be helpful in treating these illnesses. See
your doctor to discuss treatment options. Drug treatment for hepa-
titis C (see Chapter 8) may also be helpful in treating extrahepatic
diseases.

Part II
Diagnosing and
Treating the Disease

In this part . . . 
You’ll probably see a variety of healthcare professionals
during your journey with hep C. Regular laboratory
tests for hepatitis C virus and liver function determine how
far your disease has progressed and help plan the right
treatment. You may choose to try combination peginter-
feron plus ribavirin, which is successful in approximately
half or more of all people treated, though serious side
effects can occur. Other health approaches include alter-
native treatments, such as acupuncture and herbs. I cover
all of these issues and liver transplants in this part.

Building Your Medical
Support Team
In This Chapter
 Working with your primary care provider
 Locating hepatitis C specialists
 Communicating with your doctor
 Putting together a health information notebook
 Enlarging your support team
T
he keys to an excellent support system start with you and
your healthcare providers. You need to have a medical doctor
experienced in hepatitis C to lead you through the maze of tests,
guide you to the best treatment available, and support you in your
healthcare decisions.
As in all relationships, the doctor-patient interaction demands good
communication from both parties. Your doctor needs to keep you
well informed about your hepatitis C and answer your questions.
Your job is to tell your doctor about your symptoms; concerns;
and any medications, herbs, or supplements you take.
In this chapter, I discuss choosing, communicating with, and work-
ing with your doctor and other healthcare providers. I also provide
some ideas on keeping records of your hepatitis C tests and treat-
ments in a special notebook, to make all that communication easier.
Starting with Your Primary 
Care Provider
For many people, the primary care provider (PCP) is the point of
entry into the healthcare system. And it’s at this point of entry,

while working with their PCP, that millions of folks have discovered
that they have hepatitis C.
The healthcare practitioner whom you visit for your routine physi-
cal examination is your PCP. Primary care provides long-term care
that includes prevention, finding and treating common medical
problems, and referring you to medical specialists. Many health
plans require that you visit a PCP before going to a specialist (see
Chapter 16 to read about health insurance and the “Moving on to
Specialists” section, later in this chapter, for more on hepatitis C
specialists).
Most PCPs are physicians (another term for medical doctor), with
one of these degrees and titles:
 Medical doctor (MD): Training includes four years of medical
school and three to seven years of residency training (in which
the first year may be called an internship) in a chosen specialty,
such as family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, or internal
medicine.
Some doctors further train for a fellowship in their specialty
or subspecialty (such as gastroenterology as a subspecialty of
internal medicine).
 Doctor of osteopathy (DO): The DO and MD degrees are iden-
tical, except that the DO degree includes additional topics on
manipulation of bones and muscles. Doctors of osteopathy
attend a school of osteopathic medicine, rather than a school
of medicine, for the first four years of medical training.
DOs undergo identical residency and fellowship training as
MDs. About 5 percent of all doctors in America are doctors of
osteopathy.
Two other types of healthcare practitioners can serve as primary
care providers:
 Nurse practitioner (NP): Registered nurses (RNs) with
master’s-level training who work with physicians or in solo
practice.
 Physician assistant (PA): These folks receive basic medical
training (26 months) and work alongside physicians to pro-
vide healthcare.
When NPs and PAs become certified by passing a national exam,
they might use the term NP-C or PA-C after their name, with the C
indicating their certification. Both NPs and PAs can specialize or
receive additional training in their fields. The requirements for NPs
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
54

and PAs vary by specialty and location, so check with your individ-
ual health providers, insurance plans, and state regulations for more
information.
Within primary care, some doctors specialize in treating different
types of people. You may visit a different practitioner depending
on your age or gender. The following are the general categories 
for doctors, but your NP or PA might also fit into one of the PCP
specialties.
 General practitioners: These doctors provide healthcare for a
wide range of medical problems. They don’t focus on any spe-
cial areas of medicine.
 Family practitioners: These physicians are similar to general
practitioners, but they have additional training to focus on
healthcare for family members of all ages, including children.
 Obstetrician/gynecologists: Women may use these doctors as
their PCP, especially women of childbearing age.
 Pediatricians: These doctors care for infants, children, and
adolescents.
 Internists: These doctors care for adults.
Pediatricians and internists may specialize and treat specific parts
of the body or specific diseases, in which case they become spe-
cialists (for example, a cardiologist or gastroenterologist).
You may wonder how to interpret your doctor’s credentials. All
doctors (MDs and DOs) are licensed to practice medicine by their
individual states. Board certification is an additional qualification
that means the doctor has completed residency training and com-
pleted exams in one of the 24 medical specialties, such as internal
medicine or family medicine.
After your diagnosis with hepatitis C, your PCP will most likely
refer you to a liver specialist, who has experience in treating hepa-
titis C. The liver specialist performs further testing and treatment
for your hepatitis C and communicates results with your PCP. Your
PCP remains your point of reference for health issues not related
to hepatitis C and is the guardian of your overall healthcare.
Moving on to Specialists
Medicine has become a specialized business, with an almost over-
whelming amount of information available today on different parts
of the body. It’s impossible for any one doctor to be an expert in
Chapter 5: Building Your Medical Support Team 55

every area of medicine. Consequently, when you have hepatitis C,
you want a doctor with the most up-to-date knowledge of and expe-
rience with hep C.
Hepatitis C virus primarily causes liver disease, so you’re looking for
a doctor who knows the liver (and hep C) inside out. The physician
specialists who treat hepatitis C may be called one of the following:
 Gastroenterologists: Specializing in the many diseases of the
digestive tract, gastroenterologists vary in the amount of
experience they have with liver diseases or hepatitis C. You
may see the letters GI in connection with gastroenterologists,
which comes from the term gastrointestinal.
 Hepatologists: These doctors are liver specialists who in
many cases are also gastroenterologists.
 Infectious-disease specialists: Hepatitis C is a virus infection,
so you might be referred to an infectious-disease doctor. 
Some infectious-disease specialists have experience treating
hepatitis C.
Most people with hepatitis C visit a gastroenterologist or hepatolo-
gist, but some folks, especially those with an HIV co-infection, may
go to an infectious-disease doctor who has expertise in hepatitis C
treatment.
Specialist doctors spend many years learning their trade.
Gastroenterologists who treat adults first specialize in internal
medicine (residency) and then get training in gastroenterology
(additional residency). Pediatric gastroenterologists first specialize
in pediatrics (residency) and then in gastroenterology (additional
residency). A residency is a period of hospital-based training in a
medical specialty after the basic four years of medical school.
Because gastroenterology is such a large field (read about how
large the digestive system is in Chapter 11), different residency 
programs vary in how much time they devote to liver diseases or
hepatitis C. Some doctors take additional training, called a fellow-
ship, in hepatology, which is specific training in liver diseases. A 
fellowship is the name for another period of hospital-based training
that usually occurs after the years of residency training.
In this chapter and much of the book, I focus on treatment by 
gastroenterologists/hepatologists. You may also find NPs and 
PAs with specialist hepatology training. The American Association
for the Study of Liver Disease has a training fellowship for NPs 
and PAs.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
56

Reviewing the job description
Your liver specialist will apply his expert knowledge to treat your
hepatitis C, using the three-pronged approach used by all health-
care professionals:
 Diagnosis: Your doctor notes your symptoms and your general
physical appearance and uses up-to-date techniques to test
your liver and overall health. Blood tests, sonograms or CT
scans, and liver biopsies (which I cover in Chapters 6 and 7)
are among the laboratory tools your doctor uses to arrive at a
diagnosis.
 Treatment: Using the most effective and safest medications,
your doctor will treat your hepatitis C and also any side
effects resulting from hepatitis C disease or hepatitis C drug
treatment. I cover drug treatment for hepatitis C in Chapter 8.
 Management: Your doctor manages your health over a long
period of time by seeing you during office visits and ordering
laboratory tests. Sometimes, management of your hepatitis C
involves referring you to other healthcare providers. For
example, your doctor may refer you to a psychiatrist if she
suspects that you may be suffering from depression.
Finding qualified candidates
Check your health insurance policy to find out its rules about visit-
ing specialists. With some health plans, you need a referral from
your PCP, and some plans may limit your choice to doctors in their
network or on their preferred-provider list. (But you can always
telephone or write a letter to try to get access to an out-of-plan
liver specialist if none is available on your plan.)
Doctors specializing in all things liver can be tricky to find. Many
health insurance companies don’t list hepatologists as a type of
specialist. Hepatology is usually listed under gastroenterology, and
you have to check with each gastroenterologist individually to see
whether he has experience with hepatitis C. Here are some tips for
finding a specialist to treat your hepatitis C:
 Your PCP is the first source for information on finding a spe-
cialist. Your other doctors and healthcare professionals may
also provide referrals.
 The American Liver Foundation (ALF) (phone 800-465-4837;
Web site www.liverfoundation.org) or Hepatitis Foundation
Chapter 5: Building Your Medical Support Team 57

International (phone 800-891-0707; Web site www.hepfi.org)
can help you find a gastroenterologist or hepatologist in your
area.
 Your state medical association can provide names of special-
ists. Look in your phone book for the telephone number.
 Local hospitals have lists of specialists.
 Local support groups of people with hepatitis C in your area
can recommend doctors and give you tips on what to look for
(see Chapter 14).
Examining the Doctor-Patient
Relationship
The reality of healthcare today is that the patient — you — must
be his or her own best advocate. The fact that you’re reading this
book shows your concern and desire to be an informed healthcare
participant.
After you find one or more potential specialists (see the earlier 
section “Moving on to Specialists”), consider requesting an
appointment to “interview” these doctors. You can then ask 
specific questions that will give both you and the practitioner a
chance to see how well you agree on the treatment and manage-
ment of your hepatitis C.
Getting to know your preferences
Healthcare decisions are a matter of personal choice, and people
are as different as snowflakes. Knowing what’s most important to
you will help you obtain the healthcare you need. You have to
decide what you’re willing to do and put up with to get well. Can
you conscientiously and consistently take your medication (see
Chapter 8)? Do you favor Chinese medicine and other integrative
approaches (see Chapter 10)? Are you willing to pursue a variety 
of self-help techniques (discussed in Part III)? Answering questions
such as these are an important first step in making healthcare
choices.
Treating and managing your hepatitis C should be a collaborative
process. But psychic abilities aren’t a prerequisite for other members
of the team; you have to know yourself so you can communicate
your questions, preferences, and concerns.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
58

Think about previous healthcare experiences you’ve had. What did
you like or dislike? Here’s a list of things to consider. Your doctor
may ask you about some of these things.
What types of health insurance and emotional support do you
have?
 What’s your healthcare insurance situation? Read your
policy and make inquiries before you visit your doctor. See
Chapter 16 for information on financial issues and health
insurance.
 Do you have a personal support system? What will you do if
you need help or a shoulder to lean on? Talk to family mem-
bers, friends, and co-workers. See Chapter 14 for information
on finding the support you need.
 Do you belong to a support group? Your doctor may encour-
age you to get this help from other people with hepatitis C
because they’re well prepared to help you on this journey.
Can you communicate your healthcare style — the types of issues
that are important to you — to your doctor?
 Are you the type of person who avoids all drugs unless
absolutely necessary? Your doctor needs to know whether
you mind taking drugs so that he can best treat your hep C
and any side effects.
 Do you want to be a vocal partner in your healthcare? Let
your doctor know that you need to be actively involved in
making decisions.
 Do you use alternative or complementary medicine? Doctors
vary widely in their knowledge and support of alternative and
complementary medicine. Your role as patient is to communi-
cate with your doctor and educate him about complementary
and alternative medicine (CAM), if need be.
How honest will you be with your doctor? Are you willing to make
changes to your lifestyle?
 Will you be honest about your current or former use of alco-
hol or recreational drugs? If you currently smoke, drink, or
use drugs (see Chapter 12 for a discussion of these dangerous
substances), you also need to seriously consider whether
you’re willing to work with your doctor to go into treatment or
follow up on a referral to an addiction counselor, if necessary.
Chapter 5: Building Your Medical Support Team 59

 Will you be conscientious about tracking your use of medica-
tions, drugs, herbs, and vitamins? If you use these substances,
will you write them down and tell your doctor that you’re
using them?
 Will you talk about your concerns about sex? It’s possible
for hepatitis C to be spread through sexual activity that
involves exposure to blood. You may have concerns about
transmission or about interest in sex, which can decrease as
a side effect of hep C or drug treatment.
 Will you change your diet or exercise routine to help your
hep C symptoms? Not all hepatitis C patients can or will alter
their lifestyle.
When you find a doctor with whom you’re comfortable, you’re
more likely to talk about the things that are really important to
you, thus enabling your doctor to give you the best care.
Getting to know your doctor
Doctors vary in their experience with hepatitis C and their outlook
on the disease. A doctor who has treated many different people
with hepatitis C and is active in research can use his breadth of
experience and resources to help you get well. But just because a
doctor has lots of experience with hepatitis C doesn’t mean he’s
the best doctor for you.
Use the following questions to think about what’s important to
look for in a prospective doctor or to better understand your cur-
rent doctor. I can’t give you the right answers because the best
doctor for you probably has different answers than the best doctor
for someone else.
You won’t want to use all of these questions — not in the first visit,
anyway — but they do give you an idea of things to look for. If you
feel intimidated by the idea of asking the doctor anything, just pick
a couple of the most relevant questions. You can also ask some
questions of nurses or administrators in the office.
Find out your doctor’s training and experience with hep C by
asking some or all of these questions:
 What specific training have you had in hepatitis C or liver
disease? Find out whether the doctor has had fellowship
training (see the “Moving on to Specialists” section, earlier
in the chapter) or other experience in liver disease.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
60

 How do you keep up to date about new information on 
hepatitis C? Ask the doctor what professional publications 
he reads and whether he attends medical conferences on 
hepatitis C.
 What’s your personal experience with hepatitis C? Ask how
long the doctor has been treating people with hep C and how
many people he treats in a year.
 How much experience have you had with liver biopsies?
Ask the doctor how many liver biopsies he performs each
year. You might also ask how long the doctor has been per-
forming liver biopsies, which I discuss in Chapter 7.
 Are you involved in any hepatitis C research? Doctors vary
in the amount of time they dedicate to their research and clin-
ical (treating patients) practice.
If you want to determine the doctor’s style of management, get the
answers to these questions:
 How will you monitor my hep C? How often will I have
blood tests? Regular testing is critical to properly manage
your hep C illness.
 Will I need to have a liver biopsy? Are there any alternatives
to this procedure? Liver biopsies are potentially dangerous
(see Chapter 7), and practitioners differ in recommendations
about their use.
 How do I find out whether your office or the drug compa-
nies will work with my insurance company? Some doctors
are more willing to work with you to resolve insurance issues.
Your doctor’s answers to the following questions may help you
gauge your comfort level with the doctor’s approach to drug 
treatment.
 How many patients do you treat with interferon? Get a sense
of the doctor’s experience with combination interferon treat-
ment (see Chapter 8 for more on drug treatment of hep C).
 How do you treat side effects to drug therapy? You’ll want to
know whether your doctor is quick to detect drug side effects
and remove the drug if it’s causing harm. 
 Do you feel that the current drug treatment is for me, or
should I wait for new treatments? You’ll get an idea of the
doctor’s treatment style from her answers to this question.
Some doctors take an aggressive approach toward current
treatment, and others have a more conservative wait-and-see
style (see Chapter 8).
Chapter 5: Building Your Medical Support Team 61

 What’s your approach with people who don’t respond to
drug therapy? Although you hope to be one of the respon-
ders, you need to have a plan in place in case you aren’t.
 Do you participate in clinical trials for hepatitis C? This
information may be relevant to you if you want to join a 
clinical trial for a new drug.
You also want to know whether the doctor is open-minded and will
work with you or your other healthcare providers in certain situa-
tions. Ask these questions to find out:
 Will you help me in using integrative or alternative thera-
pies in addition to or instead of drugs? Doctors vary in their
knowledge about and opinion of complementary and alterna-
tive medicine (CAM).
• Your doctor may be extremely knowledgeable about and
supportive of CAM, and may actively work with alterna-
tive providers for hepatitis C.
• Other doctors may not know very much about CAM but
be willing to monitor you while you pursue other treat-
ments alongside conventional treatment.
• Some doctors may see complementary and alternative
treatments as hogwash. This type of prejudice is becom-
ing less frequent as doctors realize that the general
public is vastly interested in complementary treatments
(see Chapter 10 for a discussion of the National Center
for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, a branch
of the National Institutes of Health).
 Have you worked with other HIV co-infected people before?
If you are co-infected with HIV and hep C, it’s crucial that 
your doctor has such experience or will work with your HIV
doctors.
 What is your approach to working with people with depres-
sion, anxiety, or psychological problems? The chronic illness
of hepatitis C and drug treatment can add to these emotional
problems. You’re trying to find out whether the doctor is com-
passionate.
 How do you feel about patients who use or have used
illegal drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes? The answer will help
you decide whether the doctor is very judgmental about 
personal aspects of your medical history. If you still use any
substances, find out whether the doctor will be supportive of
your situation.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
62

You may also want to find out how your doctor deals with folks
with advanced chronic hepatitis C disease.
 What happens if I get seriously ill? Find out which local hos-
pitals your doctor is associated with.
 Have any of your patients had a liver transplant? Here’s
your chance to find out your physician’s experience with this
serious situation. Read more about transplants in Chapter 9.
Find the answer to these questions concerning the logistical
aspects of the doctor’s office:
 Does the doctor have available appointments for you at the
time you need?
 Is the doctor’s office within a reasonable traveling distance?
 How well does your doctor’s office communicate with you
about results of your tests?
Chapter 5: Building Your Medical Support Team 63
People with Hep C rank their doctors
A report published in the April 2004 issue of the medical journal Hepatology studied
one group of people being treated for chronic hepatitis C.
Within this particular group, 41 percent said they had communication problems with
their doctor. Of those people:
 Twenty-eight percent reported communication problems with their doctors and
said the problems were due to feeling rushed, ignored, or not listened to, or
being treated poorly.
 Twenty-three percent thought their doctors did a poor job in their diagnosis and
treatment.
 Nine percent felt stigmatized by their doctor as sexually promiscuous or drug
addicts.
People who didn’t respond to the drug treatment were more likely to have commu-
nication problems with their doctor. The researchers who performed the study won-
dered whether poor communication between doctor and patient turned into poor
compliance (not taking all the medication correctly). Patients who don’t take their
medication correctly may not have a complete response to the medication.
My take on the message for people with hep C is: Get a doctor who treats you with
respect, take all your medication, and see your doctor immediately if you have any
problems with your medication.

You might also speak to other people with hep C to find out about
their doctors. But remember that each of you might have different
personal responses to the same physician. A certain chemistry
exists between the healthcare provider and the client/patient
that’s completely individual.
Creating Your Hep C Notebook
Keeping all your medical information up-to-date and in one place 
is a good idea. Your best bet is to assemble some sort of notebook
where you can store everything. You can use an actual notebook, a
three-ring binder (and a hole puncher), a folder, or any combination
of these. Whatever system you use, keep the information organized
and easy to find. Include the following types of information:
 Results of lab tests and other diagnostic procedures: Include
such things as blood test results, scanning results, biopsy
reports, and other diagnostic information. Here are some tips
on maintaining those records:
• Request copies of the results of every single test you
take. Ask as soon as you have the test or when you first
get the result. You may have to pay for copies in some
instances.
• Consider using a ringed notebook. The documents won’t
fall out, and you can access them easily.
• Make sure the name of the test, the results, and the test
or procedure date are legible.
 Diary of symptoms: You can write this on loose-leaf paper to
keep in your ringed notebook or in a separate bound note-
book with lined paper. Make sure to date each entry, and write
down when the symptom started and when it disappeared or
was treated. You may have daily entries to record how you feel
each day. This information is an essential part of monitoring
your treatment.
 List of prescription and over-the-counter medications, 
vitamins, and minerals you take: Go through your medicine
cabinet, and write down each one. Include the amount (50 mg,
100 mg, and so on) and how often you take it (once a day, once
a week, and so on).
 List of questions: Write down questions you have for your
doctor and other healthcare professionals and keep the
answers when you get them.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
64

 List of doctor visits: For each visit, write down any informa-
tion or advice the doctor gives you. This information also
helps you keep track of health insurance and payment issues.
 General information on hepatitis C: Include material that you
receive from doctors, drug companies, the American Liver
Foundation, and so on. Depending on how much information
you have, you can place this info in your ringed notebook or
folders.
 Food diary: Some practitioners ask you to keep a food diary.
As you do with the diary of symptoms, you can keep a record
of what you’re eating so that if you have a problem, you can
figure out which foods may have caused it. Read more about
nutrition and issues of food and hep C in Chapter 11.
When your first notebook is full, get another, and keep collecting
all your information. Keep your old records and notebooks; they
have important information you might need at some point.
Get creative, and put in healthy affirmations or happy pictures on
the front of your notebook or within the pages. Positive thinking
can help you get well faster.
Your doctor will appreciate your effort to manage your disease 
on your end. Having all this information conveniently on hand
allows you and your doctor to make the best use of the time you
have together during visits — more time for discussions and ques-
tions, and less time spent on, “Uh, let me think . . .” and “Now,
where did I put that?”
Including Others in Your
Healthcare Support
You and your doctor are the backbone of your support system, but
you need others to help you out, too. Get as much support as you
need from other healthcare practitioners, friends, and family. And
keep everyone connected and informed.
Integrating other healthcare
providers
In all likelihood, you’ll visit other healthcare providers in addition
to your primary care provider and liver specialist. All of your
Chapter 5: Building Your Medical Support Team 65

healthcare practitioners are part of your medical support team,
which may include the following members:
 Mental health professionals: You may be under the treatment
of a psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker.
 Other medical specialists: You may be undergoing treatment
or taking medication for other medical conditions, such as
high blood pressure or diabetes.
 Complementary and alternative practitioners: You might
visit an acupuncturist, herbalist, naturopathic doctor, mas-
sage or reiki therapist, homeopath, or ayurvedic practitioner. I
discuss these approaches in Chapters 10 and 13.
Keep all your practitioners informed about all of your healthcare
issues. Your medical doctor who treats your hepatitis C, in particu-
lar, needs to know about all other medications and treatments. The
liver is a sensitive organ, and many herbs and medications have
the potential to cause damage (see Chapter 12).
Refer to your healthcare notebook to exchange information between
your practitioners. You can bring copies of test results from one
provider and give to another doctor.
Bringing in friends and family
Friends and family also have a key role to play in your support
system. When you’re fatigued, depressed, or suffering from other
symptoms or side effects of medication, call in your support team!
You may need someone to drive you to appointments, pick up
medication, or call your doctor. I include a separate chapter in this
book — Chapter 19 — just for friends and family who want to know
how they can help you.
Bring someone — a friend, family member, or support group
person — to your appointments with doctors or alternative health-
care providers to help you remember what the doctor tells you.
When your doctor answers your questions, gives you test results,
or explains specific details of your condition, you may have trouble
remembering everything he said. Fuzzy thinking can be a symptom
of hepatitis C, and simply being in a doctor’s office can be pretty
stressful and make it hard to remember everything. Two heads are
better than one when it comes to remembering the important info
from your doctor’s visit.
You should write down the important info about each visit while
sitting in the doctor’s office or immediately afterward.

M
any people have absolutely no idea that the hepatitis C
virus is swimming around in their blood and lounging in
their liver. You may not have symptoms that lead you to a doctor
until years or decades after infection. By that time, irreversible
damage could occur. The sooner you know you have hep C, the
sooner you can take the action described in this book to save your
liver and to prevent the spread of hep C to others.
The hep C virus tests tell you whether you’ve ever been infected
and if you’re infected now. Whether you’re a newbie or a veteran
hep C virus test-taker, I give you a handle on interpreting your
results.
New and improved tests are being developed all the time. The 
tests available today are more accurate and have a better ability 
to detect virus than tests from just a few years ago. Your liver 
specialist will have the latest information on any new tests.
Beginning the Process
If you’re thinking about taking a hepatitis C test or if you’ve recently
taken a test, consider this: Knowledge is power. Determining

whether you’ve been infected and knowing for sure whether 
the virus is in your blood will either ease your mind or serve 
as the first step on the hepatitis C recovery journey.
In a nutshell, here’s how it works: Hep C tests involve drawing
blood, and sometimes, there are lots of them. A white-coated person
draws blood from a vein in your arm, and the blood is then trans-
ferred into different test tubes with a variety of color-coded tops, to
be shipped away for specialty laboratory testing. If you perform the
first test yourself (see the section “Places to get tested,” later in this
chapter), you perform the blood-drawing duties by puncturing your
finger with a lancet.
Waiting for test results can be nerve-wracking — especially in the
beginning. It can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of
weeks to get your results. Use this time to get your support system
going and bone up on your health insurance policy (all topics cov-
ered in Part III). Try to stay calm while you wait!
The laboratory sends or faxes your results to your healthcare
practitioner, who in turn calls you immediately or tells you the
results at your scheduled follow-up visit. The more proactive you
can be in following up and keeping track of your results, the less
anxious you will feel.
Reasons to get tested
The hepatitis C infection is usually silent. It acts like a character in
a movie who sneaks around in the shadows while he goes about
his dirty tricks.
How do you know whether you should look for hep C in your
blood? You may want to get tested if any of these situations apply
to you:
 You’ve experienced a risky exposure sometime, somewhere.
(I cover the topic of hep C transmission in Chapter 2, but I
also help you weigh possible exposures later in this section.)
 You found out you have high liver enzymes during a routine
blood test. (I cover liver enzymes in Chapter 7.)
 You have symptoms such as fatigue or abdominal pain (read
about symptoms of hep C in Chapter 4).
With the latter two situations, your doctor is likely on the case
already. But with exposure, you may be sorting it out yourself.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
68

Here are some questions to help you decide whether you’ve had
any risky exposures. Like pregnancy, it has to happen only once.
Can you answer yes to any one of these questions?
 Did you receive clotting-factor concentrates before 1987?
(Beginning at that time, clotting factors were treated against
human immunodeficiency virus, which also protected against
hep C virus.)
 Have you ever shared needles or other drug paraphernalia?
 Have you had long-term dialysis?
 Did you receive a blood transfusion or organ transplant before
1992 (when the hep C test was first used for screening)?
 Have you had tattoos or body piercing performed with unsani-
tary, shared instruments (such as in prison)?
 Have you had a needlestick or puncture accident as a health-
care worker?
 Were you born to a hepatitis C–infected mother?
 Do you have HIV infection?
 Were you exposed to blood in a military setting?
 Are you the spouse or sex partner of someone with hep C?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may have been
exposed to hep C. Check out Chapter 2 for the complete scoop on
transmission of the disease.
Places to get tested
The best place to get your first test is your healthcare practi-
tioner’s office. Later on, if you find out that you do have hep C,
you’ll be referred to a liver specialist who’s more knowledgeable
about the ins and outs of testing.
If you don’t have insurance, or you want more confidentiality, you
can find a nearby clinic by calling your local health department.
Clinics for people with HIV or sexually transmitted diseases, intra-
venous drug users, or homeless people may also provide hep C
testing. These clinics usually provide some sort of counseling and
advice so you can follow up any result as wisely as any owl.
Another option is a home testing kit. You can buy a screening test kit
(which tests for antibodies; see the “Getting Tested” section, later in
Chapter 6: Testing for the Hepatitis C Virus 69

the chapter) at your local pharmacy, by telephone, or on the Web. To
contact Home Access Health Corporation, which makes a hepatitis C
test for home use, call its hepatitis C information line: 888-888-HEPC
(888-888-4372) or check out its Web site (www.homeaccess.com).
Here’s how it works: You collect your blood at home, send it to the
laboratory, and then call for the confidential results and counseling
about the next step to take. Make sure to follow the detailed
instructions exactly to a T, or you may not get an accurate result.
Be sure to speak with your doctor if your test results are positive.
Getting Tested
Welcome to the world of high-tech testing. Like other types of med-
ical tests, looking for virus is a matter of medical sleuthing. The
goal here is to examine your blood, attempting to detect signs of
the hep C virus.
The latest technology is used to test your blood for signs, or 
markers, of hep C infection. The tests are divided into two cate-
gories, according to which marker — antibodies or RNA — 
you’re looking for.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
70
All about antibodies
We all have millions of antibodies in our blood. We start making them in childhood.
Breastfeeding mothers give antibodies to their babies through milk. At about 6
months, infants start to make their own antibodies. The purpose of vaccination is to
get humans to produce antibodies against the vaccine, which looks like the virus or
bacteria we want to fight.
When exposed to a virus, bacteria, or even a vaccine, your immune system makes
a specific antibody against these agents. The antibody is like a key that fits a “lock,”
or antigen component, of the virus, bacteria, or vaccine. In the best-case scenario,
your antibody neutralizes or blocks the effect of the foreign antigen.
Unfortunately, like any ammunition, your antibody may fail in one of two ways. It
may have no effect. For example, the antibodies that the anti-hep C tests detect
aren’t neutralizing antibodies. Or, worse, the antibody can backfire and hurt you. For
example, autoimmune diseases like lupus are caused by antibodies that attack the
body. Some people with hepatitis C develop autoimmune diseases, and medical
researchers are trying to discover the interaction of hepatitis C and autoimmunity.

Analyzing your antibodies
Antibody testing answers one question: Have I been infected? The
antibody test does not tell if you are currently infected. It says only
whether you’ve been infected at some point of your life.
Your immune response makes antibodies after you’re infected by
hepatitis C. The human body makes millions of different types of
antibodies to fight millions of different types of invaders — of
which hepatitis C is only one. Antibodies usually show up a few
months after the initial infection. (For more on antibodies, see the
“All about antibodies” sidebar in this chapter. And for more on the
immune response to hepatitis C virus, see Chapter 3.)
Meeting the tests
Antibody tests look for the antibody to hep C (which answers to 
the name anti-hep C or anti-HCV). The presence of these antibodies
tells you and your doctor that you’ve been infected with hep C at
some point in your life. In the testing world, these are the first tests
performed, because they’re the quickest and cheapest. Antibody
tests come in a few varieties:
 EIA (enzyme immunoassay): This test can also be called ELISA.
Newer generations of these tests are quite accurate, with fewer
false negative or positive results than earlier versions.
 RIBA (recombinant immunoblot assay): This test is some-
times used as a second antibody test. It was more commonly
used with earlier-generation EIA tests.
The names of these tests — and the RNA tests that I cover in 
the aptly named “Reading your RNA results” section, later in the
chapter — are about the complex technical detective systems,
rather than the function of the test itself.
Reading the results
The waiting is over. You have results in hand, and you want to
know more. Here are some ways to interpret your results (and
check out Table 6-1 for an easily accessible summary):
 Nonreactive (without symptoms or history of exposure):
Congratulations! You’re free and clear! No further testing is
needed. Don’t forget to protect yourself from future exposure
to the hep C virus (see Chapter 2 to read about transmission).
 Nonreactive (with symptoms or history of exposure): Your
doctor will perform further testing — either an RNA test or a
Chapter 6: Testing for the Hepatitis C Virus 71

retest of your antibody levels after a few months — to see
which of these categories you fit into:
• You don’t have hep C infection. You may have another
liver disease.
• You’re infected with hep C but haven’t made antibodies
because it’s too soon after infection (it can take a few
months to make antibodies).
• You may have hepatitis C, but you’re just one of those
rare people who don’t make the antibodies to hep C. 
 Reactive: This result means that you have anti-hep C antibod-
ies in your blood. Your doctor will follow up this result with:
• A viral RNA test (see the next section) to see if you have
virus in your blood
• Liver blood tests (see Chapter 7) to see if you have any
damage to your liver

You may be one of the many folks who go to give blood and find
out you test positive for hepatitis C! After you get over your initial
shock, call your primary care physician, and schedule an appoint-
ment to follow up this result. You may find that you were infected
in the past but that you’re no longer infected, or you may find that
you have hepatitis C right now and didn’t know it. If you currently
have hep C, it’s actually a good thing that you found out about it
early — you can now get yourself under the care of a good liver
specialist (see Chapter 5) and start focusing on healthy living
(see Part III).
In the past, screening tests by blood banks for hepatitis C some-
times yielded false positive results. Steps were taken to reduce the
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
72

number of false positive results, but it’s always possible that your
positive result was an error. The only way to know for sure is to
see your doctor and get follow-up tests (see the “Regarding your
hepatitis C RNA” section, later in the chapter).
Antibodies for life?
Like a good vaccine that immunizes long term after just one shot,
your hep C antibodies may stay around for years. So even if you
have successful treatment for hepatitis C, and your virus is gone,
the antibody test (but not the RNA test) may stay positive. Be pre-
pared for this situation if your blood is tested for job or insurance
purposes. (I discuss finances and the workplace in Chapter 16.)
Don’t panic. Some researchers report that the antibodies will even-
tually disappear — after the hep C is gone. Research is under way
to find out how long antibodies last after the hep C virus is gone.
Regarding your hepatitis C RNA
Hep C RNA tests detect virus in your bloodstream. Your doctor will
order these lab tests for you during your care for hepatitis C:
 When you first test positive during an antibody test
 Before, during, and after treatment with combination peginter-
feron (see Chapter 8)
 During your continuing care for hepatitis C
RNA is the abbreviation for ribonucleic acid. RNA is almost an exact
mirror image of the better-known DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Our
genes come in the form of DNA, and hep C genes come in the form
of RNA. (See Chapter 3 to read more about DNA and RNA.)
Meeting the tests
RNA tests are used to detect the presence of a virus. Have you seen
a cop show in which the detective tests crime-scene blood for a
suspect’s DNA? Here, hepatitis C is the prime suspect. Finding hep
C RNA in your blood means that you have a current infection.
You may wonder why tests look for RNA and not the virus itself.
Remember that the hep C virus is minuscule and can’t even be
seen with a regular microscope. RNA, being a nucleic acid, can be
detected in very small amounts by certain high-tech biological
tests (similar to the ones done in forensic science). The purpose 
of detection here is to find evidence of the hepatitis C virus.
Chapter 6: Testing for the Hepatitis C Virus 73

There are two types of RNA tests. The qualitative RNA test gives a
yes or no answer — yes, you have the virus, or no, you don’t. The
quantitative RNA test estimates the levels of hep C RNA in your
blood — which is called your viral load. While the two types of
RNA tests really answer the same question about whether you’re
currently infected with the hepatitis C virus, the quantitative test
goes a step further by giving an idea of how much virus you have.
Qualitative tests use PCR- (polymerase chain reaction) and TMA-
(transcription mediated assay) based technologies to detect hep C
RNA. Viral load (quantitative) tests use PCR and TMA technologies,
in addition to bDNA (branched DNA) technologies.
Your liver doctor will choose the test that’s most appropriate for
you out of the many that are now offered. For example, one major
U.S. laboratory testing company, Quest Diagnostics, offers three
different qualitative hep C RNA tests and six different quantitative
hep C RNA tests.
Quest Diagnostics has lots of information on hepatitis C (and other
tests) on its Web site (www.questdiagnostics.com) for both con-
sumers and medical professionals.
Some of the newer RNA tests aren’t yet FDA approved, even though
they may be commonly used, safe, and accurate. This fact can
affect an insurance company’s decision about coverage. Discuss
this situation with your doctor, and see Chapter 16.
Reading the results
Your test results for the qualitative RNA test will come back as 
positive or negative (which is the same as saying “below the lower
level detected by the test”). Results for the quantitative, or viral
load, tests are dependent on which test you take (see Table 6-2 for
a summary of different test results).
Ask your doctor if she considers your result to be high or low on a
quantitative RNA/viral load test. Because each test is different, it’s
difficult for me to assign high or low values here.
When considering viral load tests, be careful when interpreting
your numbers:
 Different tests come up with slightly different results. Tests
from different manufacturers have the same overall interpreta-
tion, but the exact number differs because of slightly different
techniques.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
74

 Also, your exact number varies from day to day. Don’t get too
queasy about this, but remember that the virus is alive and
growing and dying each day. So each test is like a separate
snapshot of how much virus is in your blood.
Your viral load is important because lower viral loads may be
easier to treat with peginterferon medication (see Chapter 8).
During treatment, your doctor will look for changes in your viral
load that are 10-fold higher or lower. Going from one million to one
hundred thousand is a 10-fold change (1 log); going from one mil-
lion to ten thousand is a 100-fold change (2 log); and going from
one million to one thousand is a 1,000-fold change (3 log).

Be responsible. If you have a positive result on any viral RNA test,
you are potentially infectious to others. Take precautions to keep
others safe (for more information, see Chapter 2).
Even if you test positive for hep C RNA, you may not have any
symptoms of hepatitis C. You might remain forever asymptomatic
(without symptoms) or develop them in the years to come. The
value of getting tested is to find out about your hepatitis C before
serious symptoms occur so you can take action by getting proper
medical treatment.
Chapter 6: Testing for the Hepatitis C Virus 75

You may have an RNA test to see if your combination peginterferon
is reducing your viral load. If you still have the virus, your doctor
can help you determine what other treatments may be available to
you now or down the road. Don’t forget to do your own work to
stay healthy by eating your vegetables, avoiding toxins, exercising,
reducing stress, keeping a positive outlook, and following the other
nifty suggestions in Part III.
Genotyping Your Virus
All hep C viruses aren’t exactly alike, according to scientists who
looked at hep C from all over the world. It turns out that the hep C
critters have some differences in their genetic structure. Hep C is
classified into at least six distinct types called genotypes. The geno-
types have been further divided into more than 50 subtypes, which
have a letter after their name — genotype 1a and genotype 1b are
subtypes of genotype 1, for example.
It’s possible to have any genotype no matter where you become
infected, but some genotypes are more common in certain parts
of the world.
 Genotype 1 is the most common genotype in North and South
America, Europe, Australia, and Japan.
 Genotypes 2 and 3 are the next most common subtypes in
North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Japan.
 Genotype 4 is the most common genotype in the Middle East
and Africa.
 Genotype 5 is the most common genotype in South Africa.
 Genotype 6 is the most common genotype in Southeast Asia.
A genotyping test, which is performed after you’ve already had a
positive hep C RNA test, uses the hep C RNA to classify the type 
of hep C virus you have. You need to have this test only once,
because your genotype stays the same (unless you’re exposed to
hepatitis C again).
The reason your doctor will test your blood to determine your hep
C genotype is that it might be important when considering combi-
nation peginterferon. Your genotype is one factor that determines
how well and how quickly interferon combination therapy (see
Chapter 8) will rid you of hep C. Genotypes 2 and 3 respond the
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
76

best and quickest. But don’t despair if you’re not genotype 2 or 3!
Knowing your genotype will help your doctor plan the treatment
strategy that works best for you.
A hot area of research focuses on finding anything else the geno-
type differences might predict. An ongoing debate concerns
whether certain hep C genotypes cause more severe disease. So
far, the studies are not conclusive. For now, the main reasons to
test genotype is to plan drug treatment.
Charting Your Progress
As you can see by reading this chapter, hep C is often all about
tests, tests, and more tests. Try to get copies of any of your tests,
and if you’re thinking about starting a healthcare notebook to
keep all your hep C stuff together (as I discuss in Chapter 5), file
them there.
But even if you have copies of the results, the sheer amount of
paperwork can quickly build up. So you may find it helpful to sim-
plify your records by creating a chart on which you write down 
the names, dates, and results of your tests, along with any burning
questions you may have about them for your doctor. Creating a
chart can also help you track the progression of your test results
at a glance. To make things easy, you can just photocopy Figure 6-1
and stick it in your notebook (or fill it out right here).

Chapter 7
Testing the Liver
In This Chapter
 Analyzing your blood for liver enzymes and function
 Scanning your liver
 Getting a liver biopsy
You know you’ve been infected with hepatitis C (see Chapter 6).
Now your liver doctor wants to perform laboratory tests to
predict the condition of your liver.
Blood tests for substances made by the liver can detect evidence
of liver damage. Your doctor will also order an ultrasound of your
liver or maybe a CT or MRI scan. The riskiest test, but also the
most informative, is the liver biopsy, which involves the removal of
a tiny piece of your liver that’s then analyzed under a microscope.
In this chapter, I describe the different types of tests, any risks
involved, and how to interpret your results. Your doctor will use
the information he gets from these liver tests, along with results
from your hepatitis C virus tests (see Chapter 6), and what you tell
him about your symptoms to diagnose and treat you.
Just because you’ve had a past or even a current hepatitis C infec-
tion doesn’t mean you have liver disease. Some people have no
symptoms or signs of liver disease. Your doctor will take tests 
regularly to keep on top of any liver problems that may occur.
Blood Tests
When you go for a physical, your healthcare practitioner frequently
orders blood tests. Many folks first find out they have hep C after
undergoing a routine blood test and finding that one or more of the
tests is abnormal. In this section, I outline tests your doctor may
order to define the nature of your liver damage, including some of
which are included in the tests you undergo during a physical.

By using results from different tests, your doctor can perform a 
differential diagnosis and rule out other non-hepatitis C–related dis-
eases or differentiate between different stages of hepatitis C disease.
After your blood is drawn, it’s sent to a medical laboratory, where
technicians use computerized machines to perform tests. The
results from your tests are compared to reference ranges. A refer-
ence range is a group of numbers — from low to high — that
includes the results of 95 percent of healthy people (5 percent of
healthy people will have results outside of the reference range).
The reference range used to be called a normal range. What’s
normal or average for one group of people of a certain age or
gender will differ from that of another group of people. Different
laboratories themselves have different reference ranges. If your
test result is higher or lower than the reference range, the number
is flagged with an L or H (for low or high).
Inform your doctor of any medications you’re taking because they
can affect your test results. Other factors that can affect your test
results include:
 Your gender
 Your age
 Whether you’re fasting at the time of the test
 Strenuous exercise
 Alcohol and drug use
Obtain and keep copies of your laboratory test results (see
Chapter 5 for advice on managing your personal hep C medical
information). The name of the laboratory, your name, the test date,
and your doctor’s name appear on the test results.
It’s up to your healthcare provider to interpret your results. The
lab may flag small differences in your results from the reference
range, but your doctor may not feel that the difference is big
enough to be of concern. Your doctor may want to repeat your test
if one number is extremely high or low, or wait a few months and
test you again.
In the following sections, I list some blood tests that are commonly
used to diagnose liver disease; your practitioner will use some of
these, as well as other tests, to study your individual situation.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
80

Liver enzyme and liver function tests
There’s no one test that indicates chronic hepatitis C disease.
Tests for the effects of hepatitis C on your liver include:
 Liver enzyme tests: These tests measure current liver cell
injury by the amount of enzymes that are “leaked” out of dam-
aged or dying liver cells. (See Chapter 3 for more information
on enzymes.)
 Liver function tests: These tests look at levels of proteins
made by the liver. If your liver damage is such that your liver
function is impaired, levels of these proteins will be low. If
your bilirubin, clotting factors, or albumin levels are low, you
may have cirrhosis or late-stage liver disease.
In the following sections, I discuss some of the tests that fall into
these categories. Check out Table 7-1 for a quick summary and a
list of sample reference ranges for each test covered.

Chapter 7: Testing the Liver 81

ALT
Small amounts of ALT (alanine aminotransferase) are normally
found in blood. When the liver is damaged, ALT is released into the
bloodstream. ALT is found in organs other than the liver (kidneys,
heart, muscles, and pancreas), but most increases in ALT are from
liver damage.
ALT processes the amino acid alanine, which is one of the 20 amino
acid protein building blocks. ALT is also called SGPT (serum gluta-
mate pyruvate transaminase) or alanine transaminase.
AST
AST (aspartate aminotransferase) is also called SGOT (serum 
glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase). Like ALT, AST is found mainly
in the liver but also in other parts of the body. AST and ALT are
usually measured together and are good indicators of liver disease
or damage. Sometimes, test results give AST/ALT ratios.
ALP
ALP (alkaline phosphatase) is found in all parts of the body, with
particularly high concentrations in the liver, bone, and placenta
(during pregnancy). Like ALT and AST, ALP might leak into the
bloodstream when liver cells are damaged as a result of hepatitis C.
Children (who have growing bones), pregnant women (especially in
their last trimester), and people with bone disease also have higher
levels of ALP.
GGT
GGT refers to gamma-glutamyl transferase, but it’s also called
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) or Gamma-GT. High levels
of GGT are found in the liver, bile ducts, and the kidney. Bloodstream
GGT levels will be higher in people with diseases of the liver and 
bile ducts.
5’N’Tase
Higher levels of the enzyme 5’N’Tase (5’nucleotidase), also known as
5’NT, in your blood indicate a problem with bile secretion. Hepatitis
or cirrhosis can cause a blockage of bile flow.
Albumin
Albumin is the major blood protein made by the liver. One function
of albumin is to keep the blood from leaking through the blood ves-
sels, which can cause fluid retention in the ankles (edema), lungs,
or abdomen (ascites). Low levels of albumin may be due to liver or
kidney disease, malnutrition, or even a low-protein diet.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
82

Bilirubin
This pigmented (yellow) waste chemical comes from the normal
process of red blood cells’ dying after 90 to 120 days. A healthy
liver converts bilirubin and sends it out of the body with the bile
that goes to the intestine. Excreted bilirubin gives feces (stools)
their characteristic brownish color.
When the liver is diseased, bilirubin isn’t converted and excreted.
Stools might, therefore, be light-colored. The bilirubin that’s not
properly excreted builds up in the body and gives a yellowish
color to skin and eyes (a condition known as jaundice) and dark
brown tea color to urine.
High levels of bilirubin are due to either too much production of
bilirubin (from red blood cells dying) or because the liver isn’t pro-
cessing bilirubin, which happens when the liver is damaged. This is
one of three tests used to determine wait time for a liver transplant
(see Chapter 9).
In addition to using a blood test, urine can be tested for bilirubin.
PT test
The PT (prothrombin time) test measures how quickly your blood
clots, which is dependent on clotting factors (proteins) that are
made by the liver. The PT test is used as a marker of advanced liver
disease and can indicate blood-clotting problems where it takes you
longer to stop bleeding.
Your laboratory may also give PT results that have been converted
to an internationally recognized and easily comparable value that’s
called the International Normalized Ratio (INR). The INR is one of
the three factors used to determine wait time for a liver transplant.
Other blood tests
Additional tests that measure other markers in your blood give your
doctor a clearer picture of any liver disease and also any effects
from the combination peginterferon drug treatment (see Chapter 8).
Complete blood count (CBC)
A complete blood count (CBC) looks at the number and types of
cells in your blood. Your doctor will look for problems such as
 Reduced white blood cells or platelets: This may indicate
portal hypertension, a complication of cirrhosis in which 
pressures are increased in the portal vein. (see Chapter 4).
Chapter 7: Testing the Liver 83

 Indicators of anemia: This problem is very common during
ribivarin treatment.
The complete blood count includes the following tests:
 White blood cell (WBC) count: The total number of white
blood cells. Changes can indicate problems of hepatitis C
infection or side effects of interferon treatment. Interferon
can cause neutropenia, which is a decrease in neutrophils, one
type of white blood cell.
 Red blood cell (RBC) count: The total number of red blood
cells. Low levels can indicate anemia.
 Hematocrit (HCT): Percentage of blood cells that are red
blood cells. Low levels can indicate anemia.
 Hemoglobin: The amount of this oxygen-carrying protein.
Low levels can indicate anemia.
 Platelet count: Number of platelets in your blood (may be
altered in cirrhosis). 
AFP
Tests for AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) are used to screen for liver cancer
in people with cirrhosis. But not everyone with liver cancer has
this marker. Pregnant women usually have higher levels of this 
protein, which is also used to look for problems in pregnancy. You
may have slightly high levels of this protein if you have hepatitis or
cirrhosis.
Iron
The liver stores iron, and an overabundance of iron (iron overload)
can add to the damage caused by hepatitis C. Too much iron can
be a problem during interferon treatment (see Chapter 8). See your
physician to determine whether you should avoid supplements that
include iron.
Creatinine
Creatinine is actually a breakdown product of creatine, which is
made by the liver and transported to your muscles. The kidneys
excrete the waste product creatinine, and when your kidneys are
damaged, creatinine levels rise. When the liver stops functioning in
end-stage liver disease, this can cause serious kidney problems as
well. This test is one of the three used to determine your wait time
for a liver transplant (see Chapter 9).
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
84

Imaging Tests
Images from ultrasounds, CT (or CAT) scans, and MRIs give a pic-
ture of the overall size and shape of your liver. You’ll probably get
an initial ultrasound when you’re first diagnosed with hepatitis C.
If you have cirrhosis, you’ll have ultrasounds once or twice a year
to screen for liver cancer. CT scans and MRIs are used to further
visualize liver tumors.
Imaging studies, particularly MRI and CAT scans, are expensive.
Make sure you’re covered by your insurance.
Scanning tests allow your doctor to get an image of your liver from
the outside of your body. Because these tests are noninvasive, you
have less chance of any side effects than with a liver biopsy.
If you have an implantable cardiac defibrillator or pacemaker, you
can’t have an MRI test. If you’re pregnant, you can’t have a CAT scan,
and ultrasound is more widely used in pregnancy than an MRI.
Ultrasound
Ultrasound uses sound waves to produce an image of your liver. No
X-rays or other types of radiation are used. A technician places a
gel on your skin to help transmit the sound waves and rubs a small
wand over your abdominal area to get a picture on the computer
screen. You may have to move to one side of your body or another
to enable the technician to get a complete picture of your liver.
CT or CAT scan
A CT (computed tomography) scan, also called a CAT (computer-
ized axial tomography) scan, is a special type of X-ray that scans
an area of the body in layers (slices) that are analyzed by a com-
puter. When doctors are looking for the possibility of cirrhosis or
liver cancer, they use CT scans as a follow-up when ultrasound
results are unclear.
MRI
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans use radio waves and
strong magnets rather than X-rays. A computer analyzes the signals
from the MRI to give detailed information about your liver. MRI
scans are helpful to look at liver cancers and can sometimes tell
a benign tumor from a cancerous one. In MRI scans, which take
longer than CT scans, patients are in an enclosed tubelike machine.
Chapter 7: Testing the Liver 85

Liver Biopsy
After you’re first diagnosed with hepatitis C, your doctor will want
to see how much damage there is to your liver. Though liver
enzyme and liver function blood tests give valuable information, a
liver biopsy is currently considered the gold standard for noting
any inflammation or fibrosis damage caused by hepatitis C. Your
doctor will use a thin needle to remove a tiny piece of your liver,
which will be examined under a microscope.
The most commonly performed type of biopsy is a percutaneous
biopsy, which is what I describe in this section. Other types of
liver biopsies are sometimes used if you have symptoms (such as a
bleeding disorder) that would make this type of biopsy dangerous.
Talking about timing
Doctors differ in how often they prescribe biopsies. Many doctors
perform a biopsy when you first find out about your hep C. The
information from the biopsy is used as a baseline to see how seri-
ous your hep C disease is.
A main purpose of the biopsy is help in decisions about drug 
treatment. Some doctors don’t perform biopsies on people with
genotypes 2 or 3 (see Chapter 6). Because these genotypes respond
well to combination peginterferon treatment (see Chapter 8), your
doctor may suggest treatment in the absence of a biopsy. For people
with genotype 1, for whom treatment works about half the time,
your doctor may want to perform a biopsy to see the status of your
liver disease before making a recommendation about treatment.
A biopsy isn’t recommended for people with advanced liver disease
because the complications of the biopsy could worsen their situa-
tion. For people with these diagnoses, direct liver tests (bilirubin,
albumin, and prothrombin time, as discussed earlier in this chapter)
can provide the necessary information on the progress of their liver
disease.
After you’ve been successfully treated for hep C and no longer
have the hep C virus, you no longer need to undergo a biopsy.
Weighing the pros and cons
Only you and your doctor can decide if and when you should have
a liver biopsy. Although the liver biopsy provides useful informa-
tion, consider the risks before agreeing to have one.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
86

The pros
You may feel some relief after having a biopsy because then you
know exactly what’s going on with your liver. When you’re no
longer guessing about what damage you have, you can make the
best choices to treat your hep C.
Some people who repeatedly have normal ALT and AST liver
enzyme levels discover from a biopsy that their liver is scarred
with fibrosis. Though this result isn’t usual, it does prove that a
liver biopsy gives a more definite view of the amount of damage
you have sustained from the hep C virus.
The value of a biopsy is to indicate the level of fibrosis so that you
can plan a treatment strategy for your hep C. The presence of
fibrosis is a marker of possible progression toward cirrhosis (see
Chapter 4 for more on the progression). If you have more fibrosis,
you may want to take a more aggressive approach. If you have less
fibrosis, you may want to take a wait-and-see approach (see the
“Interpreting your biopsy results” section, later in the chapter).
Either way, the biopsy will give you valuable information.
The cons
The liver biopsy is an invasive procedure, meaning that the biopsy
needle goes through your skin and pierces your liver. A small but
real risk exists for complications, which occur in about 1 percent
of biopsies, or 1 out of 100. A liver biopsy has the following risks:
 Bleeding that may require blood transfusions or surgery to
correct
 Accidental needle puncture of the lung, intestines, gallbladder,
or kidney
 Abdominal infection
 Pain
The risk of death from the biopsy is less than 1 in 1,000.
Though usually accurate, a biopsy isn’t foolproof in its diagnostic
value. For example, the piece of liver taken during your biopsy may
not be representative of the disease in your entire liver. Discuss
this possibility with your doctor.
Noninvasive alternatives to biopsy are under development; see the
section “Evaluating alternatives to biopsy,” later in this chapter.
Chapter 7: Testing the Liver 87

Preparing for your biopsy
Before you can have a biopsy, your doctor will check that you
don’t have ascites (a complication of cirrhosis) or a bleeding disor-
der. You may be advised not to take blood thinners — including
coumadin, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, vitamin E, and the herb
ginkgo biloba —for one week before or after your biopsy.
Before the procedure, you must sign a consent form, fast for six to
eight hours, and empty your bladder.
Describing the day of the biopsy
A liver biopsy is usually performed in the outpatient area of a hos-
pital. A hepatologist, gastroenterologist (see Chapter 5 for more on
these specialists), or an interventional radiologist performs the
biopsy. An interventional radiologist is an MD who specializes in
minimally invasive surgical procedures that are guided by imaging
procedures such as ultrasound, CAT scan, or MRI (see the “Imaging
Tests” section, earlier in this chapter). Your doctor might use ultra-
sound to check placement of the biopsy needle so that he doesn’t
accidentally puncture another organ.
You may be offered light sedation before the biopsy; this is up to
your doctor. You lie down but are awake during the procedure 
so that you can tell the doctors if you feel severe pain (which is
unlikely but could signify a complication). A local anesthetic, similar
to that given by a dentist, will numb the biopsy area, which is wiped
down with alcohol. You’ll be asked to be completely still while a
hollow needle is inserted and pulled out, along with a small piece of
your liver. The entire procedure takes only a few seconds. You may
feel some pain from the needle insertion and removal, like the pain
of having your blood drawn.
Afterward, you’ll be bandaged up and rolled over onto your right side
or asked to remain flat on your back while you stay at the hospital for
a few hours so that the staff can monitor you for any complications.
Your blood pressure and pulse will be checked regularly. You’re
asked to stay still to decrease the risk of bleeding. Because the liver
has lots of blood vessels, bleeding is the No. 1 risk after a biopsy.
Bring a portable CD player so that you can listen to music or medi-
tations to help you relax while you’re in the hospital. Or bring a
good book.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
88

As long as you have no complications, you can go home within six
hours. For your postbiopsy care, arrange to have someone drive
you home because of the sedation, and follow your doctor’s advice
on follow-up care, rest, and pain relief. You can’t use aspirin and
ibuprofen, because they can increase bleeding.
Interpreting your biopsy results
A pathologist (an MD who specializes in the interpretation of tissue
samples) analyzes the sample of your liver and provides your
doctor with these results. Your doctor will phone you with biopsy
results within a few days or at your next scheduled appointment.
Inflammation and fibrosis are separately measured and graded
from 0 to 4 (though other grading systems may have a range from 
0 to 6). The higher the number, the greater the amount of inflam-
mation or fibrosis (see Table 7-2). Fibrosis is the technical term for
scarring of the liver. Extensive fibrosis can lead to cirrhosis, which
can develop into end-stage liver disease (see Chapter 4 for more on
different forms of disease associated with hepatitis C).
Your biopsy report may also indicate the presence of other 
problems that might contribute to the disease load on your liver.
Deposits of iron could indicate the disease hemochromatosis 
(iron-overload disease), and fat deposits could indicate fatty dis-
ease of the liver (nonalcoholic or alcoholic). Your doctor will take
these conditions into account when treating your liver disease.

Based on the info provided by your biopsy, you and your doctor
can decide how to proceed with your treatment:

wait-and-see approach. They may continue eating well (see
Chapter 11) and avoiding toxins (see Chapter 12) and wait for
Chapter 7: Testing the Liver 89

better medications to be available. Chronic hepatitis C may
not cause further damage in these people for decades, if ever.
Your doctor will order follow-up blood tests to make sure that
your disease hasn’t progressed, and some doctors perform
another biopsy three to five years later.
 When your fibrosis is more advanced, or if you have cirrhosis,
you may choose to take a more aggressive approach to your
treatment and try drug therapy (see Chapter 8), if you haven’t
already done so.
Evaluating alternatives to biopsy
Noninvasive alternatives are needed to avoid the dangerous side
effects that can occur with a liver biopsy. Research is ongoing to
find biochemical markers of liver disease that can replace a biopsy.
With late-stage cirrhosis, there’s an alternative to liver biopsy: Your
doctor can use the results from the tests listed in the “Blood Tests”
section, earlier in the chapter, especially liver function and platelet
count tests, along with a physical evaluation.
However, for early stages of fibrosis (scarring) and cirrhosis, no set
of tests is currently considered to be as accurate as the liver biopsy.
The following tests are currently available but are considered
experimental and may not be covered by your insurance company.
You or your doctor may want to consider these tests if the risks of
a biopsy are unacceptable:

measures chemicals in the blood and performs a statistical
analysis to predict levels of fibrosis.
 Fibrotest and Actitest: A French company (BioPredictive) has
developed these noninvasive panels of tests for fibrosis,
which is called the HCV-FibroSure Test in the United States
(LabCorp).
Some doctors are using alternative tests in certain people. Future
versions of these or other tests may replace at least some of the
regular use of liver biopsies for people with hep C.

 Managing hepatitis symptoms
O
ver the past decade, improvements have been made in con-
ventional medicine for hepatitis C, and research continues
to be geared toward treatment with better effectiveness and safety.
The primary aim of hepatitis C drug treatment is to protect you from
developing cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer. Another level of
medical treatment involves those agents that help you cope with
symptoms.
In this chapter, I focus on the current best treatment for hep C —
combination peginterferon and ribavirin therapy, which works to
eliminate hepatitis C virus. I describe what the treatment is all
about, who gets treated, and what the side effects and rates of 
success are. I also touch on treatments for symptoms of chronic
hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, as well as medical treat-
ments that are currently in clinical trials.
Here, you can find the information to help you work with your
doctor to make the best decisions about treatment.

Describing Interferon Treatment
Variations on interferon treatment have been the mainstay of hepa-
titis C treatment for many years (see the “Tracing the history of
interferon treatment” sidebar in this chapter). At first, interferon
was given alone as a monotherapy. Now, a form of interferon called
peginterferon is used in combination therapy with another antiviral
drug called ribavirin. The two drugs work much better than either
one alone, if you can tolerate the side effects of both drugs.
Defining interferon
Interferon is the name of a type of cytokine, which is a protein natu-
rally produced by cells of the body. Interferons fight viral infection;
the body makes three classes of interferons, called alpha, beta, and
gamma. Drug companies have synthesized a type of the body’s
alpha interferon and called it interferon-alfa.
The different forms of interferon alfa used to treat hepatitis C are:
 Interferon alfa 2a and interferon alfa 2b: These forms are
rarely used nowadays, because the more effective pegylated
forms are available.
 Peginterferon alfa 2a and peginterferon alfa 2b: These
forms are the mainstay of current drug treatment (along with
ribavirin, which I describe in the following section).
 Consensus interferon: Another form of interferon alfa, also
called interferon alfacon-1, which is used when treatment with
interferon alfa or peginterferon has failed (see the “Looking at
options for nonresponders or relapsers” section, later in the
chapter).
Table 8-1 lists these drugs and the manufacturers that produce them.
Peg is an abbreviation for the chemical polyethylene glycol. Pegylated
interferon is interferon with an added polyethylene glycol molecule.
On its own, polyethylene glycol has no noticeable effect on hep C,
but when it’s attached to interferon, the interferon stays active in
the body for a longer period of time. As a result, you can then inject
yourself with pegylated interferon, known as peginterferon, once a
week rather than the three times a week that was necessary with
unpegylated interferon. Because peginterferon stays in the body and
is easier to use, it gives better results than unpegylated interferon
without increasing side effects.

Defining ribavirin
Ribavirin is a type of antiviral drug called a nucleoside analogue.
(Nucleosides are the chemicals that make up DNA and RNA.) With
hepatitis C, ribavirin has no effect on its own. The combination of
interferon alfa or peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin gives greater
effectiveness against hepatitis C virus than either type of interferon
alfa alone. Ribavirin is given in tablet form and is taken orally, with
the amount varying depending on your weight. (Ribavirin is used
in an aerosol form to treat other viral diseases.)
Although combining ribavirin with interferon alfa increases the
antiviral effect, it also increases the number of potential side effects.
Ribavirin is responsible for causing anemia and is extremely danger-
ous to take while pregnant.
Taking peginterferon plus ribavirin
If your doctor prescribes antiviral medicines for you, you’ll inject
the peginterferon weekly and take the ribavirin in pill form daily.
Both drug companies that produce the peginterferon treatment
have come up with easier ways to give yourself an injection: pre-
filled syringes and injection “pens.”
Chapter 8: Prescribing Medical Treatment 93

Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
94
Peginterferon plus ribavirin therapy typically lasts 24 to 48 weeks
You’ll have to visit the doctor weekly for blood tests in the beginning
of treatment and then monthly for the remainder of your treatment.
Your doctor’s office will set up a schedule for you.
Follow the directions that come with the medication exactly and
ask your doctor if you have any questions. Use a different injection
site each time and dispose of the syringe in a container designed
specifically for sharps.
Deciding Whether You’re 
a Prime Candidate
The hepatitis C treatment process isn’t easy, and it isn’t for 
everyone. Because of the possibility of serious side effects with
peginterferon and ribavirin, undergoing treatment isn’t a decision
to take lightly.
Tracing the history of interferon therapy
Interferon was used as a treatment for hep C before the virus was even named —
back when it still called hepatitis non-A non-B! Here’s a brief look at how we got to
where we’re at:
 In 1986, six months of interferon gave a sustained virologic response (SVR) —
meaning that at the end of treatment and six months after that, the individual
had no hep C virus in his or her blood — in 6 percent of people treated.
 The duration of interferon treatment times increased, and so did the response
rates.
 Ribavirin was added to the therapy and approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in 1998. Twelve months of interferon plus ribavirin gave a
42 percent SVR rate.
 In 2001, pegylated (peg) interferon was used alone.
 In 2002, a combination treatment of peginterferon and ribavirin was used. By 2004,
changes in length of treatment have led to response rates as high as 80 percent
for people with genotype 2 and 50 percent for genotype 1.
 In 2005 and beyond, expect different forms of interferon and ribavirin as well as
new forms of antiviral medications (not based on interferon or ribavirin), with fewer
side effects and improved ability to kill virus in more people with hepatitis C.

Your doctor will carefully evaluate the type and progression of your
disease, your overall health, factors that may rule out treatment,
your commitment to seeing the process through, and whether the
timing is appropriate. After these evaluations, your doctor will give
you his opinion on whether peginterferon plus ribavirin therapy
will have enough potential benefit. Because of the serious side
effects of peginterferon plus ribavirin (see the “Understanding the
Side Effects” section, later in the chapter), it’s important to deter-
mine whether you
 Should get treated because you’re at a high risk for developing
cirrhosis. Your liver biopsy would show evidence of fibrosis,
which is the precursor of cirrhosis. Or perhaps you have 
cirrhosis already, and you want to prevent development of
decompensated cirrhosis.
 Shouldn’t take the treatment, because the side effects pose an
unacceptable risk.
 Can take a wait-and-see approach. Some folks with less-
advanced disease may want to wait a few years to see if
better treatments come along. Your doctor will still check your
liver enzyme/function tests regularly and may recommend
a repeated biopsy (see Chapter 7 for more on these tests).
The future of hep C medications is covered in the section
“Researching Future Medical Treatments,” later in this chapter.
The seriousness of the side effects causes some people to consider
other options for therapy (see Chapter 10).
Testing for virus and liver disease
To start the evaluation process, your doctor will perform many
of the virus and liver blood tests that I cover in Chapters 6 and 7.
Here are some of the medical guidelines for determining who’d
most benefit from peginterferon plus ribavirin treatment (assuming
that you don’t have any factors against treatment, as described in
the section “Outlining factors that rule out treatment,” later in this
chapter).
Everyone who’s treated must have hep C virus RNA in their blood.
Treatment is usually recommended if you have chronic hepatitis C
with clear evidence of liver disease — your liver biopsy shows some
fibrosis. Treatment is recommended on a case-by-case basis if:
 You have absent to mild liver disease — liver biopsy showing
no or mild fibrosis.
 You have acute hepatitis C (early infection).
Chapter 8: Prescribing Medical Treatment 95

Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
96
 You’re co-infected with HIV.
 You’re under 18 years of age.
 You have decompensated cirrhosis. (End-stage liver disease
must be treated at a liver transplant center.)
 You’re a liver transplant recipient.
Your doctor will also look for certain factors that may lessen your
success with interferon treatment, including high hep C viral load
(see Chapter 6), high levels of iron (see Chapter 7), or fatty deposits
in the liver (see Chapters 7 and 11). 
You and your doctor must weigh the danger of your liver disease
against the problems that might ensue with peginterferon plus rib-
avirin treatment, which may be greater for folks with HIV, end-stage
liver disease, or a liver transplant.
Considering genotype
Your doctor will test your blood to see what type of genotype your
virus is (see Chapter 6 for more on genotypes). The most common
genotype in the United States and Canada is genotype 1. Genotypes
2 and 3 are the next most common. The genotype is a major factor
in determining how well and how quickly peginterferon plus rib-
avirin therapy rids your body of hep C:
 Genotype 1: The success rate for genotype 1 is about 50 per-
cent, and a 48-week treatment is required. Because the chances
are about 50–50 that you might go through a rigorous treatment
protocol and not eliminate the virus, your doctor will probably
perform a biopsy and discuss with you the risks and benefits of
treatment.
 Genotype 2 or 3: When patients are treated with peginter-
feron with ribavirin, the success rate is 70 to 80 percent.
Some doctors, after finding out that you have genotype 2 or 3,
will recommend treatment and may not even suggest you go
through the risk of a liver biopsy. The treatment time for these
genotypes is also shorter (24 weeks). The most-recent studies
show (for reasons that aren’t yet clear) that genotype 3 infec-
tion may cause more fatty change in the liver, which may also
influence the response to treatment.
There haven’t been as many clinical trials to see how people with
other genotypes (4 through 6) respond to treatment, though it
appears to be in the range between genotypes 1 and 2.

Reviewing your health
If you have one of these preexisting health conditions, your doctor
will want to make sure that these illnesses are under control before
starting treatment:
 Anemia
 Autoimmune disease
 Heart disease
 Depression
 Psychosis
Treatment might worsen these illnesses, so you and your doctor
must decide whether treatment is worth the risk.
Outlining factors that 
rule out treatment
You won’t be treated for hepatitis C if the following apply to you:
 You’re allergic to one of the components.
 You or your partner is currently pregnant or plans to become
pregnant within time of treatment and six months afterward.
The treatment is likely to cause birth defects or death of an
unborn child.
Most doctors also won’t treat you if you’re actively using intra-
venous drugs or you’re a heavy alcohol user. Further, they expect
you to be clean and/or sober for at least six months before starting
treatment.
Doctors prefer not to treat patients with an active addiction for
these reasons:
 You could reinfect yourself with hepatitis C through your drug
use or cause serious liver disease through alcohol use.
 You’re considered less likely to be able to deal with the rigors
of treatment: taking your medication correctly and regularly,
attending doctor’s visits, and reporting any side effects. If you
don’t take your medication properly, the effectiveness is
decreased (see the section “Assessing your commitment,”
later in the chapter).
Chapter 8: Prescribing Medical Treatment 97

Even if you give up your addiction, you still need strong support,
because the side effects of peginterferon and ribavirin could cause
a relapse of addiction. (See the section “Understanding the Side
Effects,” later in this chapter, to see what to expect.) If you’re a
heavy alcohol or intravenous drug user and want treatment, give
up your addiction (for helpful resources, see Chapter 12), and
make sure to have a support system in place to help you through
the ups and downs of treatment.
Doctors differ in the way they treat former or present addicts and
heavy alcohol users. See Chapter 5 for tips on finding a doctor you
can work with.
Finding the right time
Timing is everything in hep C treatment. It’s a consideration in
terms of getting treated in time to stop your disease in its tracks
and in selecting a time in your personal life that’s conducive to
treatment.
If your lifestyle is too hectic to handle the demands and complica-
tions of treatment, your doctor may suggest that you wait until
things calm down to be treated. Family or work demands can make
timing your treatment difficult. And don’t forget other demands,
such as school — if you’re currently finishing your college degree,
for example, your doctor may want to wait till you graduate. (Health
insurance is also an issue, because most folks need to be working 
or in school to receive insurance to cover the medical bills. See
Chapter 16 for tips on dealing with work and financial issues.)
During parts of your treatment, you may not be able to work or
take care of yourself, let alone be the primary caretaker of your
family. Your doctor will want to check that you have a support
system to make sure you can deal with the side effects.
Assessing your commitment
In addition to testing to see whether you’re a good medical candi-
date before starting you on hep C drug treatment, your doctor will
make sure that you’ll follow through on your commitment to the
treatment (patient compliance, in med speak). You need to consider
your answers to the following questions:
 Are you serious about starting and finishing the hepatitis C
medication even if you have some side effects? If you become
depressed or have any other serious side effects, will you dis-
cuss that with your doctor immediately?
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
98

Chapter 8: Prescribing Medical Treatment 99
 Are you willing to use two methods of birth control for the
duration of the treatment, which could be almost a year?
(See Chapter 18 for more on birth control and hep C.)
 Will you show up for the regular office or lab visits to have
blood taken?
Speak to your family before starting treatment. You’ll need their
support to help you deal with side effects (see Chapter 14). Speak
to your partner about the issues of birth control.
Understanding the Side Effects
Before you start drug treatment, you may not have any symptoms,
and your chronic hepatitis C may be relatively silent. When you
begin peginterferon plus ribavirin therapy, however, you’re likely
to have some side effects. You may need medical intervention to
manage side effects, and you may even need to stop working for 
a while.
Many people feel that trying to eradicate their hep C infection is
worth the risk of side effects and complications. This decision, like
all medical decisions, is intensely personal. I suggest that you read
about side effects here and check out the information about the
specific medication your doctor recommends from the pharmaceu-
tical companies (see Chapter 22 for contact information) before
starting the treatment so that you’re well aware of what to expect.
Each of you will respond differently to the treatment. Here’s some
general self-care advice that you’ll probably hear from many sources
(including your doctor) and elsewhere in this book that will help
tame some side effects:
 Try to drink between 8 and 10 glasses of water or another
clear liquid (like apple juice) every day. If you have diarrhea
or vomiting, drink more liquid.
 Try light exercise and stress relievers (see Chapter 13), which
can help with anxiety, fatigue, headaches, and so on.
 Follow the suggestions for good nutrition outlined in Chapter
11. Avoid alcohol, high levels of caffeine, and sugar.
 Try injecting before bedtime so that you avoid some side
effects during the day.

Here are more common side effects from peginterferon plus rib-
avirin treatment and some self-help tips you can try:
 Fatigue: Try getting to sleep early each night, and take naps
early in the day.
 Flu-like symptoms: These symptoms include headaches and
muscle aches, fever, and chills. Speak to your doctor about
taking acetaminophen for any pain or discomfort.
 Gastrointestinal symptoms: These symptoms include nausea,
vomiting, lack of appetite, and weight loss. Avoid greasy, fried
foods. Eat small healthy meals, even if you’re not hungry (see
Chapter 11 for nutrition advice).
 Emotional/mental problems: Symptoms include insomnia,
anxiety or irritability, and depression. I provide some tips on
getting to sleep at night in Chapter 21. You may need medica-
tion or benefit from talking to a mental health professional
(see Chapter 14).
 Hair loss (alopecia): Avoid hair coloring, permanents, curling
irons, and so on. Use a gentle shampoo.
 Pain or redness at the site of infection: Use a different injec-
tion site each time, and try ice before injecting.
 Itchiness: Avoid hot water in baths and showers, and use
gentle soaps and moisturizers.
You may need to see other types of healthcare professionals and
use other drugs to help you deal with side effects. Some folks prac-
tice complementary and alternative medicine to help them deal
with side effects. See Chapter 10 for more information.
Some side effects of the antiviral treatment can be serious or even
life threatening. Possible side effects can cause problems with every
system of your body, including your brain, eyes, skin, heart, blood,
kidneys, and immune system. Read more about potential side effects
in the product literature supplied by the pharmaceutical manufac-
turers or on their Web sites. Though serious side effects may be less
common or even rare, they do happen. 
Your doctor will monitor your health regularly, but you need to
report any unusual or serious symptoms. Keep the following infor-
mation in mind:
 Side effects from interferon tend to occur in the beginning of
treatment and will get better with time, but make sure to tell
your doctor about any side effects.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
100

 Don’t stop taking the medication without speaking to your
doctor. Taking the meditation consistently is crucial to its
effectiveness.
 Your doctor can always decrease your dose or help manage
your side effects with other medications.
 If the peginterferon plus ribavirin therapy is causing life-
threatening complications, your doctor of course will stop
treatment.
Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following:
 Problems with your thyroid disease or diabetes
 Shortness of breath
 Chest pain
Responding to Treatment
The purpose of the antiviral treatment is to eliminate the hepatitis
C virus in your body. Your doctor will check your response to treat-
ment by measuring your:
 Virologic response: A virologic response means your virus load
is either undetectable or has dropped significantly. Before,
during, and after treatment, your blood will be checked for
virus RNA (quantitative or qualitative RNA assay, described in
Chapter 7). The following are the different times your virologic
response is measured:
• Early virologic response (EVR): Twelve weeks after the
start of treatment.
• End-of-treatment virologic response (ETR): End of 
treatment.
• Sustained virologic response (SVR): Six months after
treatment ends.
The goal of treatment is to have a sustained virologic response
where hep C RNA becomes undetectable for years after 
treatment. 
 Liver enzyme levels: Another measurement of the success of
antiviral therapy is its ability to bring your ALT and other liver
enzyme/function test levels to “normal” levels (see Chapter 7
for discussion of these tests).
Chapter 8: Prescribing Medical Treatment 101

Following up a sustained virologic
response: Is it a cure?
If you’ve finished treatment, and your doctor congratulates you
with the news that you have a sustained virologic response 
(shortened as SVR, or sustained response), you may wonder what
comes next. At this point, moving forward, most folks remain free
of detectable virus and have a much-decreased risk of developing
serious liver disease. This is the point at which your doctor might
say you are cured. You deserve a celebration after the challenges
you’ve gone through with drug treatment for so many months. I
bet you feel better, too, with many of the symptoms of interferon
treatment and your hep C disease eliminated.
Speak with your doctor about your results and what they mean in
terms of your long-term health. At this point, all medical evidence
suggests that sustained responders eradicate their virus for years.
You must continue your medical visits to check that your liver
function doesn’t worsen and that the hep C virus has not returned.
To keep yourself healthy, continue to practice good nutrition 
(see Chapter 11), and keep your body, mind, and spirit fine-tuned
(see Chapter 13). You’re not protected from future infection with
hepatitis C virus, so make sure to avoid situations in which hep C
can be transmitted (see Chapter 2).
Looking at options for nonresponders
or relapsers
If you still have elevated ALT levels or hep C viral RNA after drug
treatment, you’re considered to be a nonresponder. If you’ve
responded to drug treatment and then become a nonresponder
when off the medication, you’re considered to be a relapser. It can
be very depressing to be in one of these categories after going
through the rigors of interferon treatment.
One bright note is that you’re not alone, and medical researchers
are actively looking for ways to help you.
Your liver doctor will know of current options that are suitable for
you. She might suggest consensus interferon (Infergen; see the
“Defining interferon” section, earlier in the chapter). You could
consider joining a clinical trial of a new medication (see the side-
bar “Participating in clinical trials” in this chapter).
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
102

Chapter 8: Prescribing Medical Treatment 103
Hepatitis C doctors are conscientious and creative about finding
ways to help their patients, and you may come across other forms
of interferon that are infrequently used to treat people who don’t
respond to the interferons listed in Table 8-1.
Another option is to consider visiting an alternative practitioner,
such as an acupuncturist or herbalist, to see whether any of those
treatments can help you. Alternative and complementary medical
approaches are discussed in Chapter 10.
Researching Future Medical
Treatments
Expect to see new developments in the next years and decades as
bench work in the laboratory turns into clinical trials, which turn
into new treatment protocols. Here are some things to watch for:
 Variations on interferon and ribavirin treatment: Down the
road, this therapy may offer the following:
• Different dosing regimes
• Different ways to take the drugs
• Modifications beyond pegylation for interferon and mod-
ifications of ribavirin that increase their effectiveness
and reduce side effects
• Use of additional agents to decrease side effects
 New protocols or drugs for special populations: Studies are
underway in children, African Americans, Latinos, women,
and people who don’t respond to or can’t take peginterferon
plus ribavirin.
 New drugs: Medicines of the future may be able to:
• Target specific areas of hep C virus replication
• Help the immune system fight the hep C virus
See Chapter 3 to read about hep C virus replication and the immune
response to hep C (especially inflammation). Future treatments will
probably consist of a “cocktail” of drugs that fight hep C infection in
different ways.

Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
104
Treating Hepatitis C Symptoms
Perhaps you haven’t tried treatment, and you’re looking for other
ways to deal with your hepatitis C symptoms. Or maybe you’ve
tried treatment, and it hasn’t worked for you (see the “Looking at
options for nonresponders or relapsers” section, earlier in the
chapter). Even if you try self-help techniques, such as modifying
your diet and stress relief, to help relieve symptoms, you may still
have problems and need medication. Some folks also find relief
with complementary and alternative medicine treatments.
Your doctor can prescribe medication to help you with side effects
and symptoms (see Chapter 4 for a list of symptoms).
In this section, I briefly list some medications, home remedies, and
other treatments your doctor may suggest for problems associated
with different types of hepatitis C disease.
Don’t take any medication or herbal remedy (whether it’s pre-
scribed or over the counter) without first checking with your
doctor. Make sure that your liver doctor is aware of all medications
you’re taking. I discuss the possible toxicity of medications in
Chapter 12.
Participating in clinical trials
Before a new drug becomes available, it first goes through testing in clinical trials.
Trials also look at different aspects of hepatitis C disease and treatment in different
types of people. You might consider participating in a trial if:
 Conventional treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin hasn’t worked
for you.
 You have late-stage cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Or you just might be interested in contributing to scientific research. To find out about
clinical trials, speak to your doctor, local hospital, and support groups for hep C. They
can give you information on the trials so that you’re well informed before you give your
consent to the trial. Make sure to consider the risks and benefits of the treatment.
You can find out the basics about clinical trials and find a list of hepatitis C clinical
trials by checking out www.clinicaltrials.gov, which is produced by the
U.S. National Institutes of Health. Many of the resources in Chapter 22 also have
information on hepatitis C clinical trials.

Chapter 8: Prescribing Medical Treatment 105
Each time you get a refill or new prescription, double-check the
medication. Although unlikely, mistakes do happen:
 Make sure the drug name and dosage on the label match what
you’re expecting, based on what the doctor told you or what
you’re used to getting.
 If you switch brands or switch to a generic, double-check with
the pharmacist if the pills look different to you.
 Add the name and dosage of this drug and the drug informa-
tion leaflet that comes with your prescription to your hep C
notebook (see Chapter 5 for more info on this notebook).
Chronic hepatitis
If you have chronic hepatitis, you may suffer none or many symp-
toms of the disease (which I discuss in Chapter 4). I don’t have
enough space in this book to list all the treatments for all these
symptoms, but here are the most common problems:
 Pain, muscle aches, and headaches: Each type of painkiller
for these symptoms has a list of side effects that may affect
your hepatitis C, so please consult your doctor before taking
any over-the-counter pain medication. Acetaminophen
(Tylenol) in low doses is commonly prescribed for headaches
and muscle aches.
 Depression: The cause of depression may be the hepatitis C
or your drug treatment. Your doctor may prescribe an anti-
depressant or refer you to a mental health professional (see
Chapter 14), especially if you have a history of depression and
are taking peginterferon plus ribavirin medication, which can
increase or cause depression.
 Itchiness: This condition, also called pruritis, may occur if you
have jaundice or as a side effect of medication. Your doctor
probably will suggest not using water that is too hot in your
bath or shower, trying oatmeal baths, and using moisturizers.
Scratching may not relieve your itch, and you may scratch so
much that you develop a bacterial infection of the skin.
If you are still itchy, see your doctor to discuss medications
for relief. Your doctor may prescribe a drug called cholestyra-
mine, which blocks bile acids and can relieve itching. Other
drugs used are antihistamines, antibiotics, or even sedatives.
 Insomnia and other sleep problems: Lack of sleep can con-
tribute to fatigue and other symptoms of hepatitis C (see the
tips for good sleep in Chapter 21). If you need help from your

doctor, she may be able to prescribe a medication to help that
doesn’t hurt your liver. Don’t be tempted to use alcohol or
other drugs, which could hurt your liver (see Chapter 12).
 Nausea and stomach disorders: Your doctor may suggest
changes in your diet or eating habits to help your digestion,
but if those changes don’t work, medications are also avail-
able to help with specific problems.
Complications of cirrhosis
Cirrhosis occurs with extensive scarring (fibrosis) of the liver. As
your liver may not be able to function adequately, symptoms can
be severe or life threatening. Compensated cirrhosis means that
your liver can still function even with scarring. Decompensated 
cirrhosis is another name for end-stage liver disease, which results
in liver failure unless you can get a liver transplant. See Chapter 4
for a discussion of progression of hep C disease and Chapter 9 for
information about liver transplants.
Here is an overview of medical treatment for common complica-
tions of cirrhosis:
 Ascites: Treatment for ascites (fluid accumulation in the
abdomen) may be a combination of bed rest, a salt-restricted
diet (see Chapter 11), diuretics to eliminate fluids, and antibi-
otics to treat infections. Your doctor may also remove the
fluid for examination and relief of discomfort.
 Encephalopathy: Cirrhosis can cause brain problems such
as confusion, personality changes, or even a coma. See your
doctor at any signs of confusion to avoid developing the more
dangerous stage of coma. Treatment involves reducing your
levels of protein; switching to vegetable sources of protein
(see Chapter 11 for tips); and using the drug called lactulose,
which is a sugary syrup that works well for many people. You
also may need an antibiotic treatment.
 Variceal bleeding: To reduce portal hypertension and decrease
the chance of bleeding as a result of cirrhosis, your doctor may
prescribe beta-blocker drugs. Some surgical techniques may
also be used if you develop this serious complication.
 Tendency to bleed: If your liver is no longer clotting properly,
don’t participate in contact sports or other activities with a
high risk of bleeding. Don’t take drugs with blood-thinning
activity (such as aspirin and ibuprofen).

106

Although these symptoms can be managed by your doctor, liver
transplantation is the medical “cure” for cirrhosis that has become
decompensated, a condition that is also called end-stage liver 
disease (see Chapter 4).
Liver cancer
For people with primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma),
treatments are surgery to remove the liver tumor (resection) or to
remove the entire liver (liver transplant). Traditional chemotherapy
and radiation generally aren’t used for treatment. Pain relievers and
other drugs are used to relieve any symptoms of the cancer.

 Deciding whether you qualify for a transplant
 Going to a transplant center for evaluation
 Getting onto a waiting list
 Having transplant surgery
 Caring for yourself and your new liver
H
ere’s the good news: Most people with hep C don’t need a
liver transplant. Here’s some more good news: If you have
end-stage liver disease or liver cancer, a transplant can provide a
new lease on life. The not-so-good news is that there aren’t enough
donor livers for everyone who needs one. Folks with liver disease
and their family and friends frequently become advocates for
organ donation.
When your doctor determines that you may need a new liver, you
go onto a waiting list. Getting placed on this list requires evalua-
tion by a transplant team. At that point, you’re entered into the
organ donation system, which directs donor livers to the most
needy transplant candidates. Lifelong aftercare and medication are
necessary to keep your new liver in tiptop shape.
Liver transplantation is nothing short of a miracle provided by the
donor with the aid of the transplant team. Success stories are
common, but if a transplant isn’t on your horizon, feel free to skip
over this chapter, with the knowledge that you can always check it
out later. But should you or a loved one face the prospects of a liver
transplant, this chapter provides an introduction to the process
and helps you find even more information.

Meeting the Folks Who 
Need a New Liver
Although most people with hepatitis C don’t need a liver transplant,
hep C accounts for 40 percent of all liver transplants in the United
States today. (Other causes or types of liver disease and sudden
liver failure account for the remaining liver transplants.)
Most of the hep C folks who need a liver transplant have struggled
with chronic hepatitis C disease for years. Their disease has pro-
gressed into one of these irreversible life-threatening conditions:
 End-stage liver disease: This condition is also called decom-
pensated cirrhosis.
 Primary liver cancer: Also referred to as hepatocellular 
carcinoma, this is cancer that starts in the liver and is not
from cancer that originates elsewhere in the body.
In Chapter 4, I describe the different symptoms and diseases that
can come with the hepatitis C virus, including the illnesses in the
preceding list.
Preventing death due to imminent liver failure or liver cancer is the
reason to transplant a liver. Without a liver transplant, end-stage
liver disease will result in liver failure and death. Liver cancer that
isn’t removed by transplantation or by another surgical technique,
called resection, will also result in eventual death as the cancer
spreads to other parts of the body.
Traveling the Trail to a Transplant
Your primary care or specialist physician takes the first step
toward a transplant for you by referring you to a transplant center
after determining that you need a new liver. You may have been
under a specialist’s care for years and only recently developed
more serious symptoms or liver cancer.
In the United States, the United Network for Organ Sharing 
(UNOS) coordinates the procurement, matching, and placement 
of all donated organs by managing the Organ Procurement and
Transplantation Network (OPTN). (For more information on 
all aspects of organ transplant, see the UNOS Web site at www.
unos.org.)
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
110

The United States is divided into 11 geographic regions (each with
multiple states) that contain 59 local organ procurement organiza-
tions (OPOs), which manage the physical acquisition and delivery
of the organs. Each local OPO has individual transplant centers,
which are housed at individual hospitals.
If your transplant center qualifies you as a potential liver recipient,
your name is submitted to UNOS, which adds your name to the
national pool — or list — of folks waiting for livers.
Choosing a transplant center
More than 200 hospitals perform liver transplants in the United
States. In Canada, approximately 28 hospitals perform transplants.
Depending on where you live, you may have a choice of centers. If
so, consider the following factors:
 Experience of the liver transplant team: How many opera-
tions does it perform yearly? How long has the team been
doing liver transplants?
 Waiting list: What’s the average wait for a liver at this center?
Each region and each transplant center has different average
wait times because of differences in the number of donors or
number of people on the waiting list.
 Geographic proximity: You and your personal support team
must be close to the hospital to get to surgery quickly and be
able to attend aftercare.
 Cost of surgery and recovery: This amount varies by location
and individual hospital. Your health insurance may be affiliated
with or work better at certain hospitals. Ask your health plan
administrator or the financial administrator of the transplant
center for specifics regarding your insurance coverage.
If you or someone you care about needs a transplant, you can start
to fill in the blanks by speaking to your liver specialist and the
transplant coordinator at individual centers. General information
is available on the Web, and you can search for information on the
different transplant centers. Also check out these sources:
 In the United States: Check out the Transplant Living Web site
(www.transplantliving.org), a comprehensive and inform-
ative site from UNOS (www.unos.org), the organization that
administers the organ transplant network in the United States.
Also take a look at www.ustranplant.org.

Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
112
 In Canada: Visit the Organ and Tissue Information Site from
Health Canada (www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/organand
tissue). Each province has separate policies for liver trans-
plantation, so you must check with your local health authority
for information.
Enrolling at the center
At the transplant center, you’ll be evaluated by the transplant
team, which is made up of experts in hepatology, surgery, psychia-
try, social services, nutrition, cardiology, and finances. The goal is
to identify people who most desperately need a new liver.
A nurse is assigned as your transplant team coordinator and serves
as your primary point of contact during the preliminary evaluation
(and throughout the transplant process). Doctors examine the cause
of your liver failure and your health in general. You also see a psy-
chiatrist and social worker to develop the support needed before
and after surgery. Because of the high cost of transplant surgery and
necessary lifelong medication, a financial officer helps you organize
your benefits. And a nutritionist helps make sure that your diet 
provides you the nourishment you need before and after transplant.
Enrolling at a transplant center doesn’t mean that you’re on the offi-
cial waiting list for a liver. Your transplant center will first perform
certain tests to determine your eligibility. Then your transplant
coordinator will tell you whether you’re on the list.
MELDing scores
Your transplant center will perform certain tests to determine your
eligibility and placement on the national waiting list managed by
UNOS. A standardized score called MELD (model for end-stage liver
disease) is calculated for adults, and a score called PELD (pediatric
end-stage liver disease) is figured for those under 18. These scores
aim to measure how likely a potential recipient is to die while wait-
ing for a transplant.
The MELD scores are based on results from these laboratory tests
(which you can read more about in Chapter 7):
 Bilirubin levels in the blood: A measure of bilirubin levels
indicates whether the liver is clearing this toxin (which causes
jaundice) and making bile.
 INR/PT (international normalized ratio/prothrombin time):
This test measures the liver’s production of blood-clotting
factors.

Chapter 9: Getting a New Liver 113
 Creatinine levels: This test is used as a measure of kidney
function, which deteriorates as a result of liver failure.
The PELD score is determined by using the three MELD factors
(bilirubin, INR/PR, and creatinine) and also albumin levels, failure
to grow (measured by gender, height, and weight), and age at time
of listing.
The data are entered into a computer, and a mathematical formula
produces the MELD/PELD score, which can range from 6 to 40.
Anything over 40 is called 40, because this is the highest category.
The higher MELD/PELD scores represent more serious illness.
Scientists and medical doctors developed the MELD/PELD scores as
the most accurate way to access need for a liver transplant. Like all
rules, there are exceptions, and your transplant center can apply
for more points in certain severe medical situations — or even for
a more crucial category called Liver Status 1. Because the need for
liver transplants is so urgent, rules are constantly being reevaluated
to provide the fairest method of organ allocation possible.
While you’re on the waiting list, regular retesting is a must to keep
your certified place on the list — or to put you at a higher place due
to worsening condition (see Table 9-1). Your doctor and transplant
center will advise you on how often you need to get retested. Keep
up with your testing, or you may lose your chance for a transplant.

Facing disqualification — 
and taking action
Unfortunately, getting a new liver isn’t an option for everyone who
needs one. Even if you have a failing liver or liver cancer, some sit-
uations may disqualify you for a transplant.

Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
114
If you fall into one of the following categories, discuss your options
with your doctor. She might prescribe medications to help ease
any pain or slow your cancer.
 Existing heart, lung, or kidney disease that would complicate
your ability to survive the surgery and/or post-transplant 
 Liver cancer that is too big (one tumor over 5 centimeters or
multiple tumors that are over 3 centimeters) or has spread to
other organs
Evidence of current alcohol or intravenous drug use may disqualify
you from consideration. Use of some drugs that were formerly dis-
approved of (methadone and marijuana) may now be accepted in
some clinics. See Chapter 12 for information on alcohol or drug
addiction and a list of resources for overcoming addiction.
Inability to pay for either the surgery or the lifelong medication
needed to keep the transplant healthy afterward can also disqualify
you for a transplant. But help is available.
You may need help paying for a transplant and the associated life-
long medication. The financial administrator and social worker
at the transplant center may help you find ways to finance the
transplant and aftercare.
Transplant Living has an excellent list of U.S. resources to contact
that include charitable organizations, Medicare, and prescription
drug assistance plans. Use these general ideas to obtain necessary
funding in other countries. Go to www.transplantliving.org/
beforethetransplant. Within the “Financing a Transplant Section,”
you’ll find “Financial Resources Directory.” Family and friends can
help by contacting these agencies on your behalf and perhaps even
organizing a fund-raising event.
Allocating organs
Unless you use a living donor, you probably face a wait, along with
people all over the country, between the time of listing and receipt
of a transplant.
When a liver becomes available through a sudden brain death, the
local OPO is in charge of safely obtaining the organ (procurement)
and informing UNOS of the available liver (see descriptions of these
organizations in the “Traveling the Trail to a Transplant” section,
earlier in the chapter). UNOS uses a computer analysis of people
who are waiting for a transplant to decide where the liver should

go. UNOS has a 17-page document with rules for allocation of livers.
I’ve generalized the rules here:
 MELD score (or Liver Status 1): Liver Status 1 gets priority
over the MELD score. The higher your MELD score, the higher
on the list you are.
 Age: All things being equal in scores, pediatric cases precede
adults.
 Geographic proximity: Time is of the essence when getting
an organ to a potential recipient, so the transplant centers
closest in location to the donor organ are given preference.
Local centers have priority, followed by regional and then
national.
 Matching of donor and recipient: It’s best when donor and
recipient have compatible blood types (though not necessary
in some emergency Liver Status 1 cases). Also, size may be a
factor, because a large liver can be too big for a small person
(but a smaller liver can grow inside a larger person).
In cases in which all other factors match, time on the waiting list
may be factored in. Otherwise, disease severity takes priority over
time waiting on the list. When a center is offered an organ, it has an
hour or less to notify the UNOS center that it’ll use the organ. For
that reason, the transplant center must be able to reach you at all
times. Your center may require you to have a cell phone or beeper
or to stay within a certain geographic area while waiting. The closer
you live to the center, the better the chances that the organ will be
in excellent condition when it is put into your body.
Contrary to the urban myth that states that fame and fortune will
move you higher up the list, UNOS states, “Race, gender, religion,
socio-economic status, or personal/behavioral history are not
taken into account in organ allocation policy.”
Waiting, waiting, waiting
The shortage of donor organs creates an urgent problem for which
the waiting list is the present solution. Waiting for a transplant can
be stressful for you and your family. You’re facing a life-threatening
illness and the uncertainty about if and when you’ll receive a 
transplant.
Reaching out for support, practicing stress management, and aiming
for a positive outlook will help you and your family. Here are some
additional tips to consider:
Chapter 9: Getting a New Liver 115

 Look for a support group at your transplant center — remember
that others are also on the waiting list.
 Though it’s easier said than done, try to reduce other sources
of stress in your life, and develop positive and effective ways of
dealing with stress. (I include lots of ideas for stress reduction
in Chapter 13 and tips for dealing with emotions in Chapter 14.)
 You may need to watch your salt, iron, and protein intake.
Follow the suggestions of your doctors and nutritionists, and
improve your diet and nutrition (see Chapter 11).
 Have your bags packed and ready to go! Be ready to go to the
hospital when that call arrives.
You can try to find another center within your region or in a dif-
ferent region that may have shorter waiting times. Registering at
more than one center is acceptable at most centers, as long as you
notify all parties. Make sure to check for coverage of the different
centers with your insurance company.
Discuss the logistics of a transplant with your family and extended
support group. You will need them when the call for a liver comes.
Transplanting the Liver
Liver transplantation has a high success rate. The national one-
year survival rates are 85 to 86 percent, and five-year survival rates
are more than 70 percent for end-stage liver disease and 50 percent
for liver cancer.
During the operation, you may need a blood transfusion. Speak to
your doctor if you want to donate your own blood ahead of time.
You may receive two types of transplant:
 Whole organ donation: This liver comes from a patient who is
declared brain-dead (see the sidebar “Conquering myths about
the gift of life,” later in this chapter). The liver is extracted, 
preserved on ice, transported to the hospital, and transplanted
within 12 to 18 hours.
 Partial liver transplant: This liver can come from a live or a
brain-dead donor. Either a piece of liver from a healthy person
or part of a liver from a deceased person is transplanted.
Segments of the liver will regenerate into a fully functioning
liver. Living donors may be relatives or unrelated as long as
the blood type matches.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
116

Chapter 9: Getting a New Liver 117
In a donation from a living person, the donor faces her own risk
from the major surgery to remove part of her liver.
Transplant surgery is complex. Your diseased liver must be care-
fully removed, with connections to vessels and ducts carefully 
severed. The new organ is then reattached to the vessels and ducts.
You’ll spend some time in the intensive care unit after surgery and
days to weeks in the hospital.
Your transplant center will let you know if they perform alternative
types of transplants to enable them to decrease your waiting time.
Because of the shortage of donor livers, some centers perform
these types of transplants:
 Two partial-liver donations from one organ
 Transplants with older or hepatitis C–infected donor livers
 Live liver donations
Conquering myths about the gift of life
More than 85,000 people are waiting for donation of organs. Sadly, some die before
they receive an organ. Here are some of the common misconceptions that keep
people from donating.
Myth: Brain death is not really death.
Fact: Death of the body occurs when either the heart or the brain stops working.
Most familiar is heart death: when the heart stops beating. Brain death means the
brain has stopped functioning and never will function again. This is different from a
brain coma or vegetative state.
At brain death, a short window of time exists in which death is certain, but the other
organs are functional while the body is on support systems.
Myth: If you’re listed as an organ donor, emergency care workers will not try to save
your life.
Fact: This common fear is untrue. Healthcare workers don’t stop trying to save your
life until you are dead. If you’re declared brain-dead, your family will be contacted
about organ donation.
Myth: If my driver’s license says that I am an organ donor, or I have an organ donor
card, that is enough.
Fact: Tell your family your wishes, in addition to having documentation about dona-
tion. Medical staffs always discuss donation with your family.

Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
118
Although these procedures might not be commonly performed right
now, further studies and improvements by transplant surgeons will
allow such techniques to be used to maximize the number of people
who can be helped with the limited supply of donor livers.
Living with a New Liver
Maintaining a foreign organ in your body requires good healthcare.
Your body will see the new liver as “foreign” (read about this aspect
of the immune system in Chapter 3). To maintain your liver, you
need to:
 Take medication for the rest of your life to avoid rejection of
your new organ. Talk to your doctor about how to manage the
side effects of these essential drugs:
• Cortisone-like drugs may cause fluid retention and puffi-
ness, and may trigger diabetes and osteoporosis.
• Cyclosporine, an immunosuppressive drug, can lead to
high blood pressure, unwanted body hair, or kidney
damage.
• FK-506, another immunosuppressant, can cause
headaches, tremors, diarrhea, and kidney problems.
 Avoid exposure to infections because your immune system is
weakened by your immunosuppressive medication. Some steps
to take in this regard include avoiding sick people and large
crowds and practicing safer sex, especially with new partners.
 See your doctor regularly for tests to make sure you’re not
rejecting your new liver.
 Eat a balanced diet, and reduce your salt intake to avoid water
retention (see Chapter 11 for more on nutrition).
 The hep C virus will probably return to your liver, so follow
the suggestions for good health outlined in Part III. The exact
location of hidden hepatitis virus isn’t known, but studies have
found that transplanted livers do become infected. Other
studies are looking at the feasibility of antiviral treatment for
transplant recipients. This therapy is tricky, however, because
interferon, for example, increases the immune response, and
cyclosporine decreases the immune response.
After a transplant, life will return to something near normal for you.
Within 6 to 12 months after surgery, you may resume physical and
sexual activities, as desired. Continue to get support from your 
doctors, transplant team, and support groups for any anxieties that
accompany these major life changes. Check out www.transweb.org
for info on living with a transplant from the patient’s perspective.

Looking at Types of Treatment:
Western, Complementary, and
Alternative Medicine
In This Chapter
 Evaluating the evidence for hepatitis C therapies
 Looking at the conventional, complementary, and alternative treatments
 Considering your options in alternative medicine
 Searching for an alternative medicine provider
You may become confused when you first investigate treatment
options for hepatitis C. Your doctor recommends one thing,
your sister suggests another, and you may find something else on
the Web. How do you decide what to do? People may recommend
one thing over another, but what is the evidence?
Before deciding on treatment, make sure to have results from virus
and liver testing (see Chapters 6 and 7) and a doctor who under-
stands hepatitis C and liver disease (see Chapter 5). You also need
to know what stage of the disease you have. If your biopsy shows
no fibrosis, and your ALT levels (which I explain in Chapter 7) are
normal, you’ll make different decisions than if you have advanced
fibrosis and the early stages of cirrhosis (see Chapter 4).
You also need to assess your financial situation in terms of your
health plan coverage and what personal funds you have, if any, to
pursue treatment not covered by your health plan.
In this chapter, I describe the conventional, complementary, and
alternative treatments for hep C and give you ways to do further
research. You can find detailed information on the current best
conventional medical treatment in Chapter 8. Chapters 11, 12, and
13 give information on lifestyle changes that will also help you heal
from hep C.

You’re the one choosing which treatments to pursue. I recom-
mend that you read each of the sections on treatment, consult
your doctor, and talk with your support network before making a
decision.
Considering the Evidence
This section is for folks with inquisitive minds — those who want
to know the different options available. I tell you how to find infor-
mation on hep C treatments and what to look for.
Gathering information
When comparing different hepatitis C treatments, you’ll have to eval-
uate the information you get. The first question to ask yourself is,
who’s providing this information? You also need to ask yourself what
the motivation is in promoting treatments for hepatitis C. Here are
common sources of information that you may encounter:
 Your healthcare practitioner: Speak to your doctor, who’ll
advise you based on his knowledge and experience with 
hepatitis C treatment, including what he has learned from his
education and in the process of treating the people with
hep C. I include a list of questions to ask your practitioner in
Chapter 5. You may want to speak to more than one doctor.
 The Internet: The Web is filled with information that varies
from incredibly useful to downright dangerous. You can find
information on hep C treatment by checking out the links I give
throughout this chapter, the rest of the book, and Chapter 22.
When evaluating the evidence on a Web site, try to find out
who’s in charge of the site. One way to get this info is to go
the home page or About Us page and see who produces the
material and what bias the people or groups running the site
may have. Government agencies, doctors and medical organi-
zations, liver foundations or other hepatitis not-for-profit
organizations, and even individuals with hepatitis C all run
hep C sites.
Remember that anyone can post information on the Internet,
and designing a Web site to advertise products that claim to
“cure” hepatitis C is relatively simple. Read information much
more carefully when a site sells products. Find a reputable
practitioner to advise you, and run the other way if you see
words like miraculous cure and amazing.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
120

 Friends, family, and other people with hep C: You may find
people giving you their two cents’ worth about treatment.
People have opinions based on their personal experience
or what they’ve heard from others. For example, if someone 
has a good result with acupuncture, she’ll recommend it. If
another person had her virus cleared with interferon treat-
ment, she’ll suggest you begin drug therapy. Just remember
that this is anecdotal evidence, which means it works in that
particular situation. Just because a treatment works for one
person doesn’t mean it’ll work on you, although it may, so
investigate further.
If you’re inclined to do your own research about all things medical,
consider these resources for hep C medical info (in addition to the
resources I include in Chapter 22, many of which have loads of
information on clinical trials or medical studies):
 Entrez PubMed: You can search for medical abstracts on this
Web page, part of the National Library of Medicine. Go to www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez.
 The Clinical Care Options for Hepatitis Web page: Go to www.
clinicaloptions.com/hep. You must register (for free) to
access this up-to-date information, which is written for doctors
but available to everyone.
 The HIV and hepatitis Web site: Go to www.hivandhepatitis.
com for excellent and updated information on hepatitis C. You
can also ask questions about treatment: Just click on the “The
Doctor Is In” link.
You may find yourself with gobs of information from medical stud-
ies or trials and wondering how you’ll deal with this information. I
suggest that you ask these questions about each study:
 What’s the date of the study? In most cases, the more recent
work is the most relevant.
 How many people were treated? The larger the study, the
more applicable it is to lots of other people.
 Did the study include people like you? In other words, were
they your gender, race, hep C virus status (high or low amounts
of virus), and genotype?
 Did the study use controls? Studies that use controls (people
who don’t get the drug being tested) are more likely to get
results that can be repeated.
Also, check out any information on how many people dropped out
of the study because of side effects.
Chapter 10: Looking at Types of Treatment 121

Don’t forget to consult your hepatitis C doctor, who has had years
of specialized training that helps put research into perspective.
Comparing different treatments
So much information is out there that people can be easily swayed
by arguments about different types of evidence. When collecting
evidence, write down the pros and cons of each treatment. Use the
following list to start to gather information about any treatments
you’re considering. You can also use it to compare the relative
merits of different treatments:
 Name of treatment
 Purpose of treatment
 Effectiveness of treatment
 Side effects
 Length of treatment time
 Cost of treatment
 Results of stopping treatment
 Related insurance coverage
 Other info I need to know
Many factors go into making decisions about which treatments are
right for you. The rest of this chapter describes different types of
conventional, alternative, and complementary treatments.
Describing Different 
Treatments for Hep C
Hepatitis C treatments aren’t “one size fits all.” Healing modes
vary from pharmaceutical medications to acupuncture to herbal
remedies. Staying open-minded about different choices will give
you the best chance of finding the right treatment. The two gen-
eral categories of treatments for hepatitis C are:
 Conventional Western medicine: Medicine taught in main-
stream medical schools
 Complementary and alternative medicine: Medical practices
from other cultures or belief systems
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
122

More people are now integrating their healthcare, using the best 
of Western medicine with the best of alternative practices. The for-
merly distinct line between conventional Western medicine and
alternative medicines is becoming blurred because of these reasons:
 People with hepatitis C are using both types of treatments.
 Alternative treatments are undergoing rigorous tests for effec-
tiveness and safety.
 Conventional healthcare workers are learning about and
incorporating some aspects of alternative medicine.
 Alternative practitioners work cooperatively with conventional
treatment and use the results of diagnostic tests (such as liver
enzyme tests or liver biopsies) to confirm their own work.
Conventional Western medicine
The major type of medicine approved by health plans, hospitals,
and doctors in the United States today is called conventional, or
Western, medicine.
Medical science aims to understand the cause of disease at a detailed
level. Diseases are caused by individual genes or mutations within
the gene; chemicals; or infectious agents, like the hepatitis C virus
in combination with cofactors. Drugs are designed to stop the chain
of events that lead to illness.
As I cover in Chapters 8 and 9, Western medicine uses a two-pronged
approach to treat hepatitis C.
Drugs to treat hepatitis C and symptoms
The following are the types of drugs you’d use for hepatitis C:
 Antiviral medicines: These drugs seek to eliminate the hep C
virus. The current best treatment is a combination of pegy-
lated interferon and ribavirin, which I discuss in Chapter 8.
 Medications to treat symptoms: These drugs treat symptoms
but don’t eliminate the virus. For example, the drug lactulose
is used to treat encephalopathy arising from cirrhosis (see
Chapter 8).
 Anticancer medications: Chemotherapeutic agents haven’t
been very successful at helping people with liver cancer. But
we can all hope that the future brings more effective and safe
drugs for this type of cancer.
Chapter 10: Looking at Types of Treatment 123

 Antirejection medications: These drugs, also known as
immunosuppressive medications, allow a transplanted liver to
thrive in your body (see Chapter 9 for more on transplants).
Surgery to treat liver disease
Here are the two ways that a skilled surgeon can treat liver cancer
or end-stage liver disease with surgery:
 Resection: This term refers to the cutting away of liver tumors
if you have liver cancer. Transplant surgery has a better longer-
term success rate, but donor livers are in short supply.
 Liver transplant: Surgeons can transplant a whole liver or part
of a donated liver in a person with liver failure (end-stage liver
disease) or a person who’s in certain stages of liver cancer.
Complementary and alternative
medicine (CAM)
The term complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is used
to describe medical treatment that hasn’t been part of conven-
tional medical practice. The distinction between CAM and Western
medicine is fading as more people choose to use both systems.
The interest in CAM among many folks is a reflection of some dis-
satisfaction with conventional medical practice and/or the desire
to try a different approach to their healthcare. The current trend is
toward an integrated approach to healthcare, which encourages
you to use the best of any treatment to get well.
Describing the components of CAM
More than 100 healing philosophies, approaches, and treatments
are included in the term CAM. Here are some treatments that may
be used as part of hepatitis C treatment:
 Alternative medical systems: These systems include traditional
Chinese medicine (including acupuncture), ayurveda, home-
opathy, and naturopathy, which I cover in the aptly named
“Alternative Medical Systems” section, later in the chapter.
 Biologically-based therapies: Herbal medicine (see the
“Herbal medicine” section, later in this chapter) and food
and vitamin therapy are included in this category.
 Mind-body techniques: This category includes meditation,
breathing, relaxation, and guided imagery, which I cover in
Chapter 13.
 Body-based therapies: These treatments include the many
types of massage, which is covered in Chapter 13.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease

 Energy therapies: Reiki and therapeutic touch are two types of
treatments in this category, which I also cover in Chapter 13.
Differing ways of approaching health and medicine
Alternative medicine often views illness in a different way than
conventional medicine does. Here are some general characteristics
of alternative treatments and ways in which they may differ from
Western medicine:
 Your body, mind, and spirit are interconnected. Increasingly,
Western doctors realize the importance of stress and mood on
illness, but spiritual matters are rarely discussed. CAM treat-
ment is more likely to consider all parts of your being, including
your mind and your spirit. The mind and body aren’t seen as
being separate entities but as intimately related.
 All of your symptoms are considered at once. A CAM practi-
tioner looks at you as a whole. Western medicine frequently
tells you that symptoms in different parts of the body aren’t
related, and you may be sent to visit different doctors to dis-
cuss different symptoms. A CAM practitioner is looking for a
larger overriding theme (such as energy imbalance) to your
illness that could explain lots of different symptoms.
With hepatitis C, your Western doctor will be interested in all
your symptoms because they could be related to liver disease.
 CAM treats your energy system. Many CAM treatments
believe that symptoms and disease are a byproduct of an
energy disorder. By balancing or harmonizing your energy, the
symptoms will disappear. CAM treatments differ in what they
call the energy they work with. Chinese medicine calls it qi
(chi). Other healing systems call it vital energy or animating
force. Reiki brings in universal energy to heal you, and ayurvedic
medicine calls it prana.
 Natural products are used. CAM treatments are based on 
the healing power of nature. Many Western treatments are
derived from natural sources, though they’re then synthetically
produced. Interferon, for example, is a natural product of the
body’s immune system that is synthesized for use in hepatitis C
treatment (see Chapter 8). CAM uses whole herbs or products
from the herb itself.
 Most treatments are unique for each person. CAM treat-
ments are more likely to be individually tailored for you. In
general, Western medicine uses one major treatment for
everyone with hepatitis C (peginterferon plus ribavirin),
although scientists are looking for new treatments that will
work for more people.
Chapter 10: Looking at Types of Treatment 125

Considering the evidence
Although things are slowly changing, conventional medicine still
hasn’t widely embraced CAM treatments. The primary reason is
the lack of scientific evidence for CAM’s effectiveness and safety in
treating disease. Here’s a description of the evidence for the two
types of treatment systems.
Conventional medicine for hep C
Many clinical trials have tested different types of interferon with
and without ribavirin. These trials have led to a medical consensus
on the current best treatment: the combination of pegylated inter-
feron with ribavirin. Depending on your genotype, the treatment
eliminates hep C virus in 50 to 80 percent of people treated. The
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this and
similar treatments for hep C.
More studies of different variations of treatments for hep C are
ongoing. Newer, more effective, and ideally safer drug therapy will
be available in the years to come. See Chapter 8 for more info on
the conventional treatment of hep C.
CAM treatment for Hep C
Many CAM treatments were developed hundreds or thousands of
years ago, before the use of statistics and clinical trials. Performing
clinical trials with CAM treatments is more difficult, because clinical
trials are expensive and CAM treatments are individually tailored,
so finding a useful control group is difficult.
In response to the public interest on CAM, the U.S. National
Institutes of Health (NIH) added a new center in 1998: the National
Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM),
which you can read more about at www.nccam.nih.gov. The 
purpose of NCCAM and similar initiatives around the world is to
increase the number of well-designed scientific studies on CAM
treatments. As evidence builds for the safety and usefulness of 
any particular CAM, it becomes incorporated into conventional
medicine.
Putting it all together
If you want firm FDA-approved treatments, go with conventional
medicine. If you like the idea of alternative treatments and are 
willing to accept the lack of firm scientific evidence, go with CAM
treatments. My advice is to take the best of both worlds instead of
sticking with just one system of treatment. Many people take this
approach to medicine, which has a new name: integrated medicine.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
126

Here are two ways that you can integrate the different systems of
health treatment:
 Use CAM treatments to help you deal with the side effects of
Western peginterferon plus ribavirin treatment, but be sure to
tell your Western medicine doctor.
 Use CAM treatments while you’re waiting for new Western
treatments to become available (all the while hoping that the
CAM might be effective on its own).
You must inform your Western and CAM practitioners of every
drug or therapy you’re using and report any changes or side
effects immediately. Not doing so could result in a potentially 
dangerous interaction. If you don’t tell your practitioners, they
can’t help you. 
Alternative Medical Systems
A medical system encompasses not only the treatments you might
receive, but also the philosophy behind the system. In this section,
I give you some more detail about the main types of alternative
systems that you may encounter while looking to treat your hep C.
Traditional Chinese medicine
What’s called traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) began in China
and other nearby countries and has been developed over the past
5,000 years. Chinese medicine views each person as a microcosm
of the universe. Here are two key principles (among the many) of
Chinese medicine:
Chapter 10: Looking at Types of Treatment 127
Having an optimistic placebo effect
When you really believe in your treatment, the chances of healing with that treat-
ment are greater. Positive thinking is a powerful healer. Some critics of CAM say
that its results are from the placebo effect, meaning that a certain percentage of
people will get well from a treatment just because they believe the treatment will
work. Wow, that’s a confirmation of the power of the mind–body connection. Whatever
treatment you use, make sure to believe in it, because whether it works on its own
or whether it is the placebo effect doesn’t really matter.

 Qi: Also spelled chi, qi is life-force energy. You’re healthy when
your qi is in balance and unhealthy when your qi is out of 
balance.
 Yin and yang: Everyone has bits of both yin and yang, which
are halves of the same whole. For example, female, night, and
wet are considered to be yin, and male, day, and dry are yang.
To be in harmony is to have yin and yang balanced within
your body.
The purpose of Chinese medicine is to balance your energy chan-
nels so that your body, mind, and spirit are in harmony. Chinese
medicine provides an excellent way to deal with hepatitis C symp-
toms and drug-treatment side effects.
Chinese medicine looks at patients as a whole, so diagnoses take
into account the season, weather, and other aspects of the environ-
ment. If you visit a Chinese-medicine practitioner, he or she will
ask questions, listen to your voice and breathing patterns, observe
your skin and tongue, feel your pulse, and put the information
together for a diagnosis.
Your diagnosis will reflect an energy imbalance in some part of your
body. On the basis of this diagnosis, the practitioner may recom-
mend acupuncture, herbs, nutritional counseling, and/or Qigong
exercises. Here’s a closer look at some of the components of TCM:
 Acupuncture, acupressure, and moxibustion: Energy travels
by invisible channels (meridians) throughout the body; each
channel represents a distinct system, such as the liver channel
or gallbladder channel. Acupuncture is the use of thin needles to
stimulate points (gates to open energy flow) on the meridians.
Acupressure is the stimulation of points with the fingers and
can be done at home. Moxibustion is the burning of Chinese
herbs safely on the body at specific points to warm energy
channels.
 Chinese herbs: Chinese medicine has more than 30 different
herb formulations (each containing a complex of individual
herbs) for treating different aspects of hepatitis C. For this
reason, it’s essential to find a TCM practitioner who’s an expert
at diagnosis and herbal treatment. Some Chinese herbs are
actually derived from animal or mineral products — so they’re
not technically herbs but are used in the same way as herbs.
 Nutrition: Your practitioner will advise you on what types of
foods to include and avoid. Different nutritional strategies are
used, depending on your Western and Chinese diagnoses.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
128

 Exercise, breathing, and meditation: Chinese exercises such
as Qigong and T’ai Chi are forms of mind–body treatments
that use breathing, movement, and meditation to achieve
energy balancing and relaxation. See Chapter 13 for more
information.
Within this chapter, I’m able only to scratch the surface of this
ancient and vast subject. If you want more info on Chinese medi-
cine and its relation to hepatitis C treatment, Misha Ruth Cohen
(a Chinese-medicine practitioner) and Robert Gish (a distinguished
liver specialist) have written, with Kalia Doner, The Hepatitis C Help
Book: A Groundbreaking Treatment Program Combining Western and
Eastern Medicine for Maximum Wellness and Healing (St. Martin’s
Press, 2001).
To find a practitioner, follow the information at the end of this 
chapter, and consult the Web site for the National Certification
Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine at www.
nccaom.org. It has a database of certified practitioners of TCM
in the United States and Canada.
Ayurvedic medicine
Ayurvedic medicine has been practiced in India for more than
5,000 years. Ayurveda is a system that integrates everything about
a person and his surroundings, similar to traditional Chinese 
medicine. Ayurveda calls the life-force energy prana. Prana is 
concentrated in seven different energy centers in the body, called
chakras. In ayurveda medicine, you’re defined as having a combi-
nation of the three doshas (energy patterns): 
 Vata: When vata predominates, you are vivacious and thin,
chill easily, sleep poorly, and have digestive problems.
 Pitta: If you have a tendency toward pitta, you’re intense, with
a medium build, and prone to liver disorders.
 Kapha: Folks with lots of kapha are graceful, gain weight
easily, and are prone to allergies and asthma.
I have space here to provide only a brief generalization. Most people
have a combination of each of the doshas, but one or two usually
dominate your personality, body type, and health. Depending on
your predominant dosha, your treatment will include the following:
 Herbs
 Nutrition
 Lifestyle changes
Chapter 10: Looking at Types of Treatment 129

 Detoxification
 Yoga
 Breathing and meditation
Finding a practitioner is much easier in India than in the United
States. The Ayurvedic Institute (www.ayurveda.com) in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, is one resource for information.
Herbal medicine
Traditional Chinese medicine and ayurveda both use herbs as part
of their medical system. Herbs are used in many parts of the world
for healing purposes. Even conventional medicine uses some
herbs, after distinct active chemicals have been isolated, tested,
and then synthesized.
Treating yourself with herbs for hepatitis C can be dangerous, let
alone expensive and ineffective. Thousands of herbs are reported
to have different effects on the liver or immune system, and some
of those effects can be toxic (see Chapter 12). Only a skilled and
knowledgeable practitioner can correctly prescribe the right com-
bination of herbs. Here’s how hazardous self-treatment can be: In a
book about using herbs for hepatitis C, I found suggestions to use
certain herbs that are known to potentially cause liver damage! I
recommend visiting a licensed practitioner of Chinese medicine, a
naturopathic doctor (see the section “Naturopathy,” later in this
chapter), or another CAM practitioner who has expertise and expe-
rience with hepatitis C.
To make your herbal experience safe and effective:
 Consult only an experienced herbal practitioner.
 Buy reputable products that are tested for safety and are stan-
dardized by the United States Pharmacopeia (www.usp.org).
 Look at reviews or endorsements of products:
• American Botanical Council (www.herbalgram.org)
gives access (for a price) to German Commission E
reports (which is the German equivalent of the U.S. FDA
and is the international authority on herbs).
• ConsumerLab.com (www.consumerlab.com) performs
its own testing of some herbal or supplement products.
 Start with low doses.
 Tell your conventional doctor and any other medical practi-
tioners which herbs you’re taking.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating the Disease 
130

The next sections provide some general information about herbs
that are sometimes used in the treatment of hepatitis C. I’m not
advising you to buy them or use them; neither am I providing infor-
mation on how and when to take them. I’m simply relaying some
information. If you want to take these or other herbs, see a qualified
practitioner.
Silymarin (Milk thistle)
German research has focused on the silymarin component of the
seeds of the milk thistle plant. Silymarin is able to protect the liver
from damage. The milk thistle plant is native to the Mediterranean
area and grows wild in Europe, California, and Australia.
Schisandra (Wu Wei Zi)
Schisandra is a Chinese herb used to treat hepatitis and poor liver
function and also is a general tonic to strengthen the entire body.
Schisandra is a woody vine grown in northeast China that produces
pink flowers. The berries are used in herbal preparations. The active
ingredients in schisandra include chemicals called lignans, triter-
penes, oils, and vitamins. Large doses can cause heartburn.
Ginseng (Panax ginseng; Ren Shen)
This most famous of all Chinese herbs is native to parts of China,
Russia, and North Korea but is no longer found in the wild. The
root of the ginseng plant has been shown to help the body deal
with stress, fatigue, and cold.
Homeopathy
A German doctor developed homeopathic science in the late 1700s.
Homeopathy uses the similar (homeo) to cure disease (pathy).
Homeopathic remedies are substances that in large doses would
give symptoms but are given in minuscule doses believed to heal
those same symptoms. The remedies are extremely diluted in water
or alcohol in a special way (potentiation). Homeopathic remedies
can be used to treat acute symptoms or entire constitutions (the gen-
eral picture of a person that predisposes them to certain illnesses.)
Conventional medicine and scientists have more trouble understand-
ing homeopathy than other CAM therapies because homeopathic
medicines are so diluted that probably none of the original substance
remains.
For treatment for a chronic illness like hepatitis C, you need to
make sure that your homeopath is experienced. The homeopath
will ask questions about your general health to determine the right
remedy for you. Some MDs, DOs, chiropractors, and naturopathic
Chapter 10: Looking at Types of Treatment 131

physicians (NPs) practice homeopathy, so you may be covered by
your insurance.
For more information on homeopathy or to find a practitioner, 
consult the National Center for Homeopathy (www.homeopathic.
org) or the American Institute of Homeopathy (www.homeopathy
usa.org).
Naturopathy
Naturopathy is medicine with a holistic twist. A naturopathic physi-
cian or naturopathic doctor (ND) is trained in Western medicine,
similar to the training that an MD receives, but with extra training
in nutrition (food and vitamin therapy), herbal medicine, Chinese
medicine, and homeopathy, among other treatments. Some health
insurance covers visits to naturopathic physicians. To find a naturo-
pathic physician, contact the American Association of Naturopathic
Physicians (www.naturopathic.org).
Finding Complementary and
Alternative Providers
To find a CAM practitioner, you can consult the following sources:
 Your primary care physician or liver specialist
 Professional CAM associations (see the specific CAM treatment
sections, earlier in this chapter)
 State licensing or regulatory associations
 Other CAM providers
 Schools of alternative care
 Hepatitis C support groups
Just as you have questions and requirements of your conventional
medical doctors, you must question your CAM practitioners. Ask a
new practitioner these questions:
 What is your qualification for this particular health practice?
 Do you accept my insurance? What are your charges?
 How long have you been treating people with hepatitis C?
 How many people do you treat a year with hepatitis C?
Make sure that the CAM practitioner is open to your opinions of con-
ventional medicine, especially if you hope to combine treatments.

epatitis C is a chronic illness that can last for
decades. In this part, I describe how to help manage
your hep C and stay strong and calm. You can keep your
body and mind healthy by eating well, avoiding toxic sub-
stances, exercising, relaxing, and getting emotional support.
I include information to help you deal with the practical
issues of disclosing your hepatitis C to others and dealing
with changes in your work or ﬁnancial situation. I also
explain how having a positive attitude goes a long way
toward feeling better.

W
hen you’re living with a chronic illness like hepatitis C,
healthy eating can make a big difference in your symptoms
and mood. Making healthy choices by avoiding certain foods and
eating others may help protect you from further liver damage or
cancer. You’re in charge when it comes to your diet. In this chapter,
I provide general information that uses common sense to design a
healthy eating style. You may not be able to follow all the sugges-
tions, but even small changes are helpful.
Everyone is different in age, gender, genetics, length of illness, gen-
eral health, liver condition, food preferences, and symptoms that
interfere with eating. So, I’m giving general nutritional information
for the average adult. I’m not recommending any supplements in
this chapter. For advice that’s specific to your condition and situa-
tion, visit your doctor or a qualified nutritionist.
If you wish to delve further into nutrition charts, calories, or levels
of specific nutrients, consult a nutrition book. Nutrition For Dummies,
3rd edition, by Carol Ann Rinzler (published by Wiley), is an excellent

source of more detailed information. Also, Health Canada has pub-
lished “Hepatitis C: Nutrition Care Canadian Guidelines for Health
Care Providers” on its Web site (www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/hepc/
hepatitis_c/pdf/nutritionCareGuidelines). 
Why Nutrition Matters
with Hepatitis C
Nutrition matters — right down to the smallest level in your body.
Each cell is made of the byproducts of food that you’ve eaten in
the past. No, you can’t take a few cells, put them under the micro-
scope, and spot that toasted cheese sandwich with fries. Not
exactly. Seeing the effects of what you eat on a cellular level isn’t
easy, even for scientists. So take a look at the effects of food on a
larger level. Have you ever noticed that
 If you eat too much or too little, you gain or lose a few pounds?
 If you drink too much, you feel hung over? (I hope those days
are all in your past, because alcohol is off limits when you
have hep C; see Chapter 12.)
 If you eat too much chocolate, you get a headache or nausea?
 If you’ve ever been really hungry or headachy and then eaten
a good meal, you feel wonderful?
If you can answer yes to any of these questions, you have some ref-
erence for noticing that what you eat really affects your body and
your mood.
Good nutrition is key to getting well when you have hepatitis C.
The cells of your immune system (which fight the hepatitis C
virus) and the cells of your liver depend on what you eat to do
their job. Eating the right foods and avoiding the wrong ones can
also help you with the symptoms of hep C and side effects of med-
ication. Here’s some important nutritional advice:
 Drink enough water.
 Don’t drink alcohol.
 Avoid chemical additives and pesticides in your food.
 Eat regularly throughout the day.
 Eat a balanced diet that contains the three major food groups:
carbohydrates, fat, and protein.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
136

 Eat a wide variety and quantity of fruits, vegetables, and
grains (preferably organic) to get phytochemicals, vitamins,
and minerals
 Take supplements as recommended by your healthcare
provider.
 Avoid or limit caffeine, junk food, processed food, fried food,
and high-sugar food.
The rest of this chapter elaborates on these suggestions and
addresses specific issues that apply when you have hepatitis C
and symptoms.
Connecting the Pieces of
the Digestion Puzzle
Before getting into the nutrition nitty-gritty, you need to under-
stand where food goes and what it does when it gets into the body.
Digestion is the process of breaking down food into energy and
nutrients (see Figure 11-1 for an outline of the digestive system).
Figure 11-1: The digestive system.
Esophagus
Liver
Large intestine
Rectum
Mouth
Tongue
Salivary glands
Stomach
Pancreas
Small intestine
Anus
Chapter 11: Eating and Drinking for Health 137

Digestion begins with the first spoonful of delicious food: 
1. The saliva in your mouth contains enzymes that start
breaking food down, and your teeth tear the food. The
tongue pushes the food down toward the esophagus.
2. The food, wet with saliva, is pumped through the esopha-
gus to the stomach.
3. The stomach uses acidic gastric juice along with a pumping
action to break down food into a paste.
4. The digested food paste is sent to the small intestine, which
is many feet long and rolled up inside your lower abdomen.
5. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are absorbed into the
bloodstream, and the waste is sent to the large intestine
(also called the colon) for elimination as feces from the
rectum.
The pancreas, liver, and gallbladder don’t physically break down the
actual food, but they help process nutrients into a form that can be
used by individual cells of the body. The liver, in particular, filters
any out toxic chemicals (such as pesticides) or drugs (such as
antibiotics) present in food, stores sugar (as glycogen), processes
fats and cholesterol, and makes bile. (For more info on the role of
the liver in digestion and its other key functions, see Chapter 4.)
Balancing Your Diet
The more you vary the types of foods you eat within the different
food groups, the better chance you have of giving your body the
nutrition it needs. A balanced diet consists of appropriate amounts
of the three basic nutrients — carbs, fats, and protein — along
with attention paid to the vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals
(a relatively new player in the nutrition game).
In the following sections, I provide a basic rundown of these nutri-
ents, a brief summary of their function, and foods that have them.
You’ll notice a plant theme developing, so I’ll warn you upfront:
Don’t be surprised if you run out to get colorful fruits and veggies
and some yummy whole-grains after reading these sections!
Covering carbs, fats, and protein
If you’ve read Chapter 2, you may notice that the following nutrients
are the same chemical substances that you find in cells.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
138

 Carbohydrates give you energy. They make up the majority of
a healthy diet. Aim to get 45 to 65 percent of your calories
from carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates, which are found
in foods like potatoes, pasta, and rice, also contain vitamins
and fiber. Dietary fiber’s role in the body is different from that
of other carbs — it aids digestion instead of providing energy.
 Fats are essential to provide energy, to make certain vitamins,
and to help the body stay warm. Aim to get 20 to 35 percent of
your calories from fat.
Cholesterol, a type of fat, is made by the liver (see Chapter 4)
but is also found in certain foods. Table 11-1 contains a break-
down of the different types of fat. In general, avoid the fats
that are solid at room temperature: saturated fats, trans fats,
and cholesterol. Liquid oils are a better way to fulfill the
body’s need for fats.
 Protein is essential for cell growth and repair and for produc-
tion of hormones, antibodies, and enzymes. Aim for 10 to
30–35 percent of your calories to come from protein.
Proteins are made up of amino acids. Some nine amino acids
are called essential because the body can’t make them on its
own. A protein that has all the essential amino acids is called
a complete protein. All animal-based foods, including eggs and
dairy products, are complete proteins.
If you don’t eat any animal-derived food (vegan), you should
know that soybeans, spinach, and quinoa (a grain) are com-
plete plant-based proteins. Other protein sources, like beans,
rice, and corn, are incomplete. The key is to combine foods
with incomplete proteins to get all the amino acids you need,
like eating rice along with beans.

many processed foods and fried foods.
Monounsaturated fatty acid
Vegetable oils: Canola, olive, and peanut.
Polyunsaturated fatty acid
Vegetable oils: Safflower, sunflower, corn,
flaxseed, and canola. Also in seafood.
Chapter 11: Eating and Drinking for Health 139

Carbohydrates, fats, and protein all provide calories and are all
essential for health. A balanced diet is one in which your meals
and snacks contain protein, fats, and carbohydrates, or at least
protein and carbohydrates. When including fats, add the healthy
fats from vegetables and fish.
See Figure 11-2 for guidelines for a balanced diet that I adapted
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of
Health and Human Services recommendations for healthy eating
(www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines). In these days of super-
sizing, figuring out what a serving size is can be confusing, so I
added the basic amounts of a serving for each major food group.
Don’t eat raw shellfish when you have hep C because they could
contain hepatitis A or other viruses or bacteria. Raw mollusks like
uncooked clams or oysters can be infected with the bacteria Vibrio
vulnificus, which could be dangerous when you have liver disease.
Don’t try any diet that limits one of the basic food groups (such as
carbohydrates, protein, or fat) unless specifically under medical
supervision of someone who knows your hep C status. Each of the
food groups is essential for good health.
Viewing vitamins and minerals
Vitamins are essential for body function. Table 11-2 explains how
they keep you healthy and where to find them.
Don’t take any supplement without the advice of your healthcare
practitioner. In this chapter, I’m advising you on how to get nutri-
ents from your food. If you still need supplementation, your doctor
can properly advise you.

Minerals also play an essential role in body function. They can be
called major or trace, depending on how much is normally found in
the body. Minerals come from rocks and metal ores, which plants
pick up from the soil and animals pick up from plants. When you
eat plants or animals, you’re getting the minerals into your body.

Major minerals include the following.
 Calcium is important for bones and teeth. Find calcium in
green vegetables and in dairy and soy products.
 Magnesium plays a role in energy production and nerve func-
tion. Find magnesium in soybeans, whole grains, fish, nuts,
bananas, dairy products, and green vegetables.
 Phosphorus helps in bone and teeth formation, as well as in
energy metabolism in the body. Eat fish, poultry, eggs, and
whole grains to get your phosphorus.
 Potassium helps the nervous system, heart, and muscles. Eat
fruit, potatoes, and yogurt to get enough potassium.
 Sodium plays a role in regulating and balancing fluid levels in
the body. Most foods and water contain salt. Sodium is espe-
cially high in salted foods, soy sauce, cheese, and seafood.
See the “Sounding off about sodium” sidebar in this chapter
for more information.
The trace minerals needed by the body are boron, chromium,
cobalt, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, selenium, silicon, sulfur,
and zinc. These three trace elements are of special interest with
hep C:
Chapter 11: Eating and Drinking for Health 143
Sounding off about sodium
Keeping your salt or sodium intake down is a good idea. Salt is another name for
sodium chloride, and if you eat foods with sodium, that’s the same as salt to your
body. For people without cirrhosis, keep your sodium levels at 2.4 grams (2,400 mil-
ligrams) per day, which is the recommended daily amount. If you have cirrhosis or
ascites (see Chapter 4), follow your doctor’s advice about salt intake. Here are some
ways to monitor your sodium use:
 Stop using the saltshaker and use lemon juice, herbs, and spices instead.
 Read nutrition labels to check the levels of sodium in your foods.
 Watch for these substances: monosodium glutamate (a flavor enhancer found
in many snack foods and Chinese meals), sodium benzoate and sodium nitrate
(which keep foods from spoiling), sodium caseinate (a food thickener), sodium
citrate (which keeps the carbonation going in sodas), and sodium saccharin (a
sweetener without calories but with the sodium).
 Watch for sodium in over-the-counter products in the form of sodium ascorbate
(a form of vitamin C), sodium bicarbonate, and sodium citrate (used as antacids).

 Selenium works with vitamin E as an antioxidant, which may
help heal tissue damage from hepatitis C. Find it in seafood,
meat, eggs, dairy products, vegetables, and grains.
 Zinc aids the nervous system and boosts the immune
systems — two parts of the body that take a hit from hep C
infection. Find zinc in brewer’s yeast, seafood, whole grains,
nuts, seeds, and vegetables.
 Iron is important to maintain energy levels. High levels are
found in liver and red meat, egg yolks, wheat germ, and oysters.
Whole grains, fish, vegetables, and raisins are other sources.
Your doctor will monitor your blood for levels of iron. Too
much iron in your blood can harm your liver (which stores
iron). Your doctor may tell you to take a vitamin supplement
without iron.
Focusing on phytochemicals
Phytochemicals are an amazing array of medicinal chemicals made
only by plants. Different phytochemicals are found in fruits, vegeta-
bles, beans, and grains. As herbal practitioners and pharmaceutical
companies alike study plants for their healing properties, thousands
of different phytochemicals have been identified and more will
be revealed about their health-boosting ability, including cancer
prevention.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
144
Fitting fruits and veggies into your diet
Here are some ways to get more fruits and veggies in your diet. Think color, variety,
and freshness when going for plant nutrition.
 Keep some veggies cut up and ready to go.
 Always have some ready-to-eat fruit on hand, such as apples, oranges, grapes,
or berries.
 Keep some frozen fruit in the freezer to add to yogurt or smoothies.
 Make vegetable soup with a variety of vegetables.
 Drink 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice instead of soda.
 Use lettuce leaves to top a sandwich.
 Make sure to have a fruit or vegetable, or both, with every meal or snack.
 Try making stir-fried vegetables. Serve with rice or pasta.

Each plant has different phytochemicals in different amounts and
combinations. If you eat a plant-based food, you get this phyto-
chemical “brew.” When you buy an isolated phytochemical in pill
form, no one really has determined whether you get the same 
benefit.
Go for color! Eat a wide variety of fruits and vegetables daily from
different plant families and different colors so that you can give
yourself a wide array of phytochemicals, vitamins, and minerals.
Some of the phytochemicals, their properties, and food sources
include the following:
 Carotenoids: Carotenoids have powerful antioxidant proper-
ties, which can slow cell damage (including inflammation) and
prevent cancer. They’re found in yellow and dark green fruits
and vegetables and in tomatoes. (You may have heard of the
carotenoid in tomatoes: lycopene.)
 Flavonoids: Flavonoids are also antioxidants. Celery, cranber-
ries, onions, kale, broccoli, apples, cherries, berries, green and
black tea, purple grape juice, parsley, soybeans, tomatoes,
eggplant, and thyme are ways to get more flavonoids.
 Phytoestrogens: They have activities similar to the female
hormone estrogen. These are antioxidants and may inhibit
cancer and bone loss and improve cholesterol. One type,
isoflavones, is found in soybeans and soy products. Another
type, lignans, is found in the fiber layer of whole grains (such
as rice and wheat), berries, and some seeds and vegetables.
 Isothiocyanates: These sulfur-containing compounds help
reduce the risk of cancer. Cruciferous vegetables like cab-
bage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and kale have
isothiocyanates. These vegetables can give off a smelly aroma
when they’re cooked, so try them raw or cold if the smell 
disturbs you.
Do you like your food spicy or highly flavored? The capsaicin
found in hot red peppers helps reduce inflammation and pain.
And if you eat fresh garlic, onion, chives, and leeks, you’ll get the
phytochemical called allicin, which may have antibiotic and antivi-
ral properties.
Practicing moderation
Good nutrition isn’t just knowing what to eat but also what not to eat.
The foods and drinks to have in moderation include the following:
Chapter 11: Eating and Drinking for Health 145

 Junk foods and fast foods: Monitor your consumption of those
salty, crunchy snacks and temptations that satisfy your sweet
tooth. This chapter is filled with suggestions for trying fruits
(instead of sweets) and vegetables and grains (instead of salty
fried foods).
 Caffeine: Coffee, tea, chocolate, and many soft drinks contain
caffeine. Limit them to two to three servings a day or fewer.
Try decaffeinated drinks like seltzer, decaffeinated coffee and
tea, juice, or water instead of caffeine.
 Fats and oils: This category includes salad dressing, cooking
oil, butter, and sour cream. For cooking and baking, use oils
like olive or canola instead of butter or margarine (refer to
Table 11-1). Avoid fatty meats and fats from processed foods,
cakes, pastries, chips, and fried foods because these fats are
more likely to be saturated or trans fatty acids and may con-
tribute to digestive problems (like nausea and indigestion).
The bad fats also increase the “bad” LDL cholesterol.
Try tweaking some of your favorite treats to make them healthier:
 If you love French fries, try eating baked or grilled potatoes.
 If you love chocolate, eat tiny amounts of only very good-
quality chocolate.
 If you love iced desserts, get an ice cream maker and put in
your own organic ingredients.
 If you love cookies, try oatmeal and whole-wheat cookies.
If you have special occasions when you must have steak and cake
or if you just have a love for French fries that won’t die, balance
your other meals that day and the next by including lots of fresh
veggies and fruit, drinking lots of water, and reducing your intake
of fat and sodium.
Enjoying food
Just because you’re eating healthy meals doesn’t mean that you
can’t get some pleasure from food! Don’t forgo enjoyment of your
food. You can find satisfaction by trying mindful eating:
 Pay attention to what you’re eating.
 Chew slowly.
 Give thanks for your food.
 Eat in a calm environment.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
146

Another tip is to treat yourself to foods that soothe. Try foods
that are nourishing and a treat for the senses, such as crunchy tart
apples, sweet cold watermelon slices, and thick yogurt with banana
slices. Or make the comfort foods that remind you of your child-
hood. For example, you may like hot foods such as vegetable or
chicken soup or cups of milky tea. Hot cereals are also comforting.
At holiday times, eat small portions of ceremonial or special foods.
Easing Hep C Symptoms
Some symptoms of hep C make it difficult to eat. You may have
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or no appetite for food at all. Follow these
tips to deal with these side effects of hep C or interferon treatment:
 Keep a daily food journal. Monitor your diet so you can learn
which foods trigger your symptoms. Recording the foods you
eat helps you make sure that your diet is balanced and you’re
getting enough calories.
 Identify any trigger foods that make you nauseated. This is
another use for your food journal. Identify these trigger foods
Chapter 11: Eating and Drinking for Health 147
Creating healthy meals or snacks
Here are some ideas for healthy snacks or small meals. Keep some of these items
around so you don’t run out of food when you need it and then have to grab some-
thing quick and less healthy:
 Lowfat yogurt mixed with fruit or nuts
 Crackers with lowfat cream cheese and cucumber
 Whole-wheat toast spread with nut butters (such as almond, peanut, or sesame
seed butter) and apple slices
 Sliced veggies served with lowfat yogurt or low-salt bean dip and salsa
 Vegetable bean soup with crusty whole-wheat bread
 Hard-boiled eggs sliced into a spinach salad
 Lowfat cheese with slices of pear
 Vegetable bean chili with brown rice
 Turkey slices with coleslaw
 Fresh or frozen fruit smoothies with yogurt and juice
 Trail mix made of a dried fruit and nut combination

and then avoid them. If the smell of food makes you queasy,
eat food that is cool or at room temperature, use indoor fans,
or cook food outdoors.
 Avoid greasy or fatty foods. Fatty, greasy food doesn’t sit well
in the stomach and can contribute to indigestion.
 Eat small, healthy meals regularly throughout the day, even
when you’re not very hungry. To maintain your energy and
keep your body functioning throughout the day, eat your
meals at regular intervals. You may want to eat lots of smaller
meals every three to four hours or the three square meals of
breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Small meals are easier to eat if
you’re not hungry, and they’ll help ward off fatigue.
If you are having trouble eating, get full quickly, or don’t have
much of an appetite, try these suggestions:
 Drink water or juice at nonmeal times. If you drink liquid at
mealtime, it may fill you up quickly, and you won’t eat enough.
 Drink juice, milk, or milkshakes instead of low-calorie fluids
like tea, broth, or coffee. To try to get more nutrition from
everything you put in your mouth, have drinks that provide
you with some nourishment.
 Make sure to eat when your appetite is best. Get some nour-
ishment in your system when you can.
 Try eating different-tasting foods — perhaps something bitter,
sweet, salty, or sour — to stimulate your appetite.
 If you have diarrhea or vomiting, drink more fluids.
 Talk to your doctor about taking zinc supplements, which
might improve the taste of foods.
Going Out to Eat
You’ve probably noticed that restaurant portions have expanded
over the years, which is often called the “supersizing” phenome-
non. And despite the popularity of fad diets and greater emphasis
on healthy options, much restaurant food is still high in fat, sugar,
and calories. You can, however, make your restaurant experience
healthier and more enjoyable (what’s to enjoy if you feel ill after
your restaurant experience?).
Sometimes, you just can’t avoid eating in a fast-food restaurant:
You’re rushing around running errands all day, you’re traveling on
business and in a hurry, or you have to find a place with food your
kids will actually eat. Here are some suggestions for eating healthier
even in a fast-food place:
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
148

 Choose a salad (but go for the lowfat dressing), yogurt and
fruit, grilled chicken, or a baked potato.
 Skip the sauces, mayonnaise, and heavy dressings. Try mustard
instead.
 Omit the cheese from your burgers or nachos.
 Avoid fried chicken and chicken nuggets.
 Order a small single burger rather than the large one.
 If you must have fries, go with a small order rather than large.
If you’re going to a sit-down restaurant, try to plan in advance what
type of food will be good for you that day. Try these tips to keep
your meal healthy:
 Ask for all salad dressings and sauces on the side.
 Order soups that aren’t cream-based.
 Skip the bread or avoid the butter.
 Split an entrée with someone else.
 Take some food home.
 Try eating an appetizer as your main course.
 Order your meat or fish baked, broiled, or dry-sautéed.
 Tell your server what your needs are.
 Order steamed vegetables.
 Choose fruit, sorbet, or other nonfat items for dessert.
Drinking Like a King
Nutrition includes not only solid food but also the liquids you put
in a glass. The basic instructions for a person with hep C can be
summed up simply: Drink lots of water and skip the alcohol.
Getting your eight glasses of water
Drinking water is essential to managing hep C or interferon treat-
ment side effects. Consider these watery facts:
 A healthy person can live for around 40 days without food but
can go only 7 or fewer days without water.
 Water is the main constituent of your body (about two-thirds
water).
 Water flushes toxins out of your body.
Chapter 11: Eating and Drinking for Health 149

The eight glasses of water a day is actually an estimate. You may
need more or less, depending on your size and activity level. What
type of water do you drink now? Here’s a rundown of different types
of water:
 Tap water: It probably contains chlorine (purifier) or fluoride
(to prevent tooth decay). Water from the tap may have a taste
of certain minerals and may contain some pollutants or toxins.
Contact your local water department or health department to
get more advice. You can always get your water tested.
 Filtered water: Different filtration systems are available. Read
the information to see which microorganisms and chemicals
the filter keeps out of your water.
 Distilled water: This water is boiled, and the steam is caught
and cooled. Because there are no minerals, this water has
little taste.
 Bottled water: The quality and taste of the water depend on
the original source (spring or public water supply) and
method of treatment (like reverse osmosis, carbon filtration,
or microfiltration) before bottling. Read the labels carefully,
though you may not get much information.
Which water is best? Do your homework and compare information
on bottled water and any filtration system you use in your home.
Get the best filtration system or bottled water you can afford.
People generally stand in one of two camps: “Tap water is perfectly
fine for me” or “I won’t drink anything but bottled water.” Whichever
water you choose to drink, just drink it throughout the day and
don’t let yourself get thirsty.
If you want to do homework on your tap or well water, check out
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s safe-water Web site
(www.epa.gov/safewater). Consumer Reports also has information
on bottled water, which you can see on its Web site (www.consumer
reports.org) or find at your local library.
If you use purified water, make sure to use it for ice cubes; cooking
(especially rice and grains, which absorb water); reconstituting
juices; and all your drinks, including tea, coffee, and smoothies.
Drinking socially without alcohol
You’re following your doctor’s orders, and you’ve stopped drinking
alcoholic beverages. Now what do you drink instead? In a restaurant,
club, or bar — or when you’re hanging out with friends at home —
try one of these nonalcoholic beverages:
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
150

 Club soda on ice with a twist of lemon or lime
 A frozen drink mix without the alcohol
 Hot or iced teas (but not ones that have too much caffeine or
dangerous herbs, which you can read about in Chapter 12)
 Orange, apple, tomato, cranberry, or pineapple juice
 Water, sparkling or flat, on ice or straight up, with or without
lemon
 Regular and diet sodas
 Sparkly ginger ale (ideal when everyone else is drinking 
champagne)
 Grape juice (red or white) instead of wine (red or white)
Planning Your Meals
When you plan ahead, you can save yourself stress and confusion.
Be realistic about what you need, what you can afford, and what’s
within your ability to prepare. Depending on where you live and/or
your financial situation, some foods (such as organic produce)
may not be easy to get.
If you want to change to a healthy eating style, make changes grad-
ually by eliminating the dangerous foods or drinks first. Then add
some healthy choices.
Using a food diary
Some healthcare professionals may ask you to keep a food diary
or journal. This tool is valuable, especially when you’re having
symptoms from hep C or interferon treatment. Try to write down
everything you eat at meals and in between.
You can keep this information in your hep C notebook. Create a list
from this chapter of new foods to try (like broccoli or lowfat yogurt)
and another list of foods to work on eliminating or reducing (like
potato chips or ice cream).
Shopping smartly
Preparing food is a big job: Ask any chef or mom or dad with kids to
feed. With hep C, you may have the additional challenges of a limited
budget, limited energy, nausea, or even aversion to specific foods.
Chapter 11: Eating and Drinking for Health 151

Here are some tips to help you be a smart shopper:
 Make a food budget.
 Plan meals in advance.
 Use a shopping list.
 Don’t shop for food on an empty stomach (because junk food
becomes too tempting).
Experts in organization recommend using preprinted lists each
time you shop. When you have figured out what works for you,
based on your budget, symptoms, and taste buds, create your own
customized lists:
 Foods to always have on hand in the house
 Foods to buy weekly and monthly
 Foods to buy every few days
Being organized takes away the stress of being unorganized.
Use a friend or delivery service to get food in an emergency, but
keep food in the house for when you’re not well enough to go shop-
ping. Here are some suggestions for foods to have on hand:
 In the freezer: Sliced bread, frozen veggies, and soup
 In the cupboard: Beans, tuna, rice, pasta, healthy soup, apple-
sauce, and potatoes
 In the fridge: Apples, carrots, peanut butter, yogurt, eggs, and
juice
Reading labels
When selecting packaged foods to buy or eat, you see all kinds of
information on the labels. Front labels may say that the food is
“natural,” “lowfat” or “low sodium.” This part of the label is more
advertisement than real information. Take a look, but then turn
your attention to the real info:
 Nutrition Facts label: This information is located on the back
or side of food products. The “% Daily Value” information (given
for a 2,000-calorie diet) can be used as a rough guide of whether
a food has high, medium, or low levels of a particular nutrient
(check out the “Balancing Your Diet” section, earlier in the
chapter).
 List of ingredients: Check out this info, usually in small print,
to see just what goes into the product.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
152

Taking just a bit of time to look at this info can help you be a more
educated consumer and make better choices at the supermarket.
Questioning additives and pesticides
Look at a list of ingredients on any box or can in your cupboard. In
addition to the foods you’d expect to see, like water or wheat or
corn oil, you’ll likely find substances (some pronounceable, others
not) that serve as colors, flavors, preservatives, or agents to improve
food texture (such as emulsifiers and thickeners). Some foods, like
bread and orange juice, also have added nutrients (vitamins and
minerals).
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the use of
additives in foods and requires that they be listed on the label.
Food additives surely have their benefits. They can give you extra
nutrition (but beware if you’re avoiding extra iron), prolong the
food’s shelf life, and make the product seem more appealing.
But because all chemicals in food pass through your liver and you
probably should avoid taxing your liver (especially if you have cir-
rhosis), avoiding extra additives is the best solution. If you read
labels carefully, you can find products in health stores and even
supermarkets that have fewer additives. I’m a realist, though.
Unless you’re a committed organic macrobiotic farmer, avoiding
some additives is nearly impossible. So my suggestion is to avoid
extra chemicals — when you can.
What about pesticides? Pesticides is a general term for chemicals
that are applied to crops to protect them from insects, as well as to
keep out weeds (herbicides). Most commercial food is grown with
pesticides. Because farm animals eat plants grown with pesticides,
these chemicals are also present in dairy and meat products. If
you’re trying to avoid exposure to pesticides, here are some tips:
 Eat organic foods (see the next section, “Going organic”).
 Wash your fruits and vegetables carefully with special deter-
gents (available in supermarkets) or water and vinegar.
 Remove the outer layer of cabbage and lettuce leaves.
 Scrub and peel all root vegetables, such as carrots and pota-
toes. Also peel (or give a good scrubbing to) all foods that are
waxed, including apples, cucumbers, eggplant, peppers, citrus
fruits, and tomatoes. Many fruits and veggies are waxed to
make them look good and last longer in the market. The wax
may not hurt you, but it can seal in pesticides.
Chapter 11: Eating and Drinking for Health 153

Going organic
Organic food differs from conventionally produced food in the
way it is grown, handled, and processed. According to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s National Organic Program information
for consumers, organic food isn’t prepared with growth hormones,
antibiotics, conventional pesticides, or fertilizer from synthetic
chemicals or sewage sludge. Check out the Web site for the
National Organic Program at www.ams.usda.gov/nop for more
information.
Folks choose to have some or all of their food come from organic
sources to preserve their health and preserve the environment.
Organic farming is becoming increasingly popular as more people
want foods that don’t have potentially dangerous chemicals.
Organic farming is also thought to have less of a negative impact
on the environment. Think about it: Where do the pesticides from
farm areas wash off? Into the water supply.
Two problems with obtaining organic foods are availability and
cost. The reason conventional farming uses pesticides is that it’s
cost effective and allows prices to be kept low. If you want to try
organic food, here are a few ways to find it:
 Check out a local health food store.
 Talk to organic farmers in your area to see whether they 
provide in-season vegetables locally. Or look for a farmers’
market that features organic foods.
 Grow your own vegetables.
But organic (and all-natural) foods are finding a place in more and
more produce sections of local and regional grocery stores. Ask
your grocer for help locating these products.
Being aware of the food you eat is what’s really important. Whether
you choose to eat organic foods or not is your personal decision.
To find out more about avoiding exposure to toxic chemicals, see
Chapter 12.
Eating Well with Cirrhosis
When you have cirrhosis, paying close attention to your diet is
especially important, as is avoiding alcohol (see Chapter 12).
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
154

Get specific nutritional guidelines from your doctor, who may refer
you to a nutritionist or dietitian. Your doctor may recommend that
you do the following:
 Reduce salt/sodium and fluid (water) intake to avoid ascites
or edema complications.
 Reduce your protein levels or change to vegetable protein to
manage a condition that can occur with cirrhosis called
encephalopathy (see Chapter 4).
 Eat more protein if you’re malnourished. This situation is an
example of why you must get proper medical advice to know
whether you should increase or reduce your protein levels.
 Take supplements to aid your diet. Depending on your liver’s
level of malfunction, you may not be getting adequate nutrition.
Moving Toward a Healthy Weight
Being overweight can put you at risk of the liver disease called
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although you may not
have symptoms of NAFLD, it can show up as abnormalities in your
liver tests (see Chapter 7) and be clearly defined by a liver biopsy.
NAFLD can make your hepatitis C disease worse and lessen your
response to interferon drug treatment for hep C (see Chapter 8).
Recent stats show that an estimated 65 percent of U.S. adults are
overweight or obese.
Being overweight may not be your problem, however. You may be
underweight as a result of poor nutrition or difficulty eating because
of your hepatitis C.
To see where you stand on weight issues, calculate your body
mass index (BMI). Use your BMI value to determine where your
weight is on the scale from underweight to overweight. Use this
formula, using pounds and inches:
(Your weight ÷ Your height2) × 703
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has a BMI calculator
and guidelines on its Web site (www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi). All
you have to do is plug in your weight and height. 
BMI values from 18.5 to 24.9 are considered to be normal weight.
If your BMI is below 18.5, you’re underweight. If your BMI is over
24.9, you’re overweight. Any value 30 or over is considered obese.
Chapter 11: Eating and Drinking for Health 155

Remember to see your doctor to discuss any concerns about your
weight and develop a plan to be healthier.
Losing weight the smart way
Trying to lose weight is a challenge for many people. Supermarket
shelves, billboards, and televisions entice us with unhealthy prod-
ucts. You can drive hardly anywhere in the United States without
encountering easy access to fast food, coffee, doughnuts, and
French fries.
Losing weight is a simple concept: Eat fewer calories than the
amount of calories you burn through activity. I’m not going to
advocate any diet. But I will tell you to follow common sense, 
consult your doctor about your weight-loss plan, and take it slowly
but surely. Here are suggestions to help you lose weight sensibly:
 Do some form of exercise three to five times a week (see
Chapter 13).
 Avoid junk food.
 Avoid fast food.
 Avoid sugary foods, such as soda, cake, candy, ice cream, and
cookies.
 Avoid fatty foods, such as French fries, fried foods, cream
sauces, cheeses, and doughnuts.
 Eat healthy meals, which I discuss in the section “Balancing
Your Diet,” earlier in this chapter.
 To satisfy cravings, keep a supply of cut-up vegetables and
fruit in the fridge.
 Try having bread or potatoes without butter, coffee without
sugar, lowfat yogurt, and skim milk rather than full-fat milk.
Quick weight loss can actually make fatty liver worse. When you
have hepatitis C, crash diets and appetite-suppressing herbs or
medications are risky. The solution for fatty liver caused by being
overweight is slow, careful dieting supervised by your physician.
Trying to gain weight
A serious effect of hepatitis C or interferon treatment is nausea
and lack of appetite, which I discuss in the section “Easing Hep C
Symptoms,” earlier in this chapter. In some cases, your liver dis-
ease may be so severe that you’re not getting the nutrition you
need. If so, see your doctor and follow her advice about nutritional
supplements.

Avoiding Harmful Substances
In This Chapter
 Understanding why toxins are dangerous
 Checking your medications, vitamins, and herbs for safety
 Avoiding household and environmental toxins
 Saying no to drinking, smoking, and illegal drug use
 Seeking help for your addiction
W
hy do some people with hepatitis C get end-stage liver 
disease or liver cancer and others don’t? Lots of factors
contribute to disease, and things like your age, gender, and how
long you’ve been infected can’t be changed. But there’s something
you can do: Reduce your exposure to potentially dangerous chemi-
cals (toxins).
Some chemicals are known to cause liver damage in certain cir-
cumstances. Although this may not be a particular problem for
a healthy person, it could be more dangerous for someone with
hepatitis C who already has some liver damage.
In this chapter, I describe different types of potential toxins and
help you work out a plan to eliminate them, one by one. I also give
you some suggestions to deal with addiction and ease your way to
a healthier lifestyle. A note on terminology: When you’re talking
about your liver, anything you put in your mouth, breathe in, or
put on your skin is a chemical to be processed. In this chapter,
when I say chemical or drug, it can refer to substances from food,
water, cosmetics, over-the-counter (OTC) or prescribed products,
and so on.

Talking about Toxins
You can be exposed to dangerous chemicals from a number of
sources. In this chapter, I discuss each of these sources in detail:
 The environment: Many chemicals that could be dangerous
are in the air, food, or water and are nearly impossible to avoid.
 Health products: Health products, including medicines that
you may have around the house or use regularly, can be harm-
ful. These include OTC and prescription medications, vitamin
and mineral supplements, and herbal products.
 Household and industrial products: You likely introduce
potentially dangerous chemicals into your home with prod-
ucts such as cleaning agents and bug sprays. At work, you
may be exposed to substances, such as solvents, that can be
dangerous.
 Potentially addictive substances: This category includes
alcohol, cigarettes, and street drugs. These addictive sub-
stances are dangerous, but they can be very difficult to
give up.
The liver is particularly sensitive to chemical damage because it’s
a clearinghouse for most chemicals that enter the body (for the
complete story on the workings of your liver, see Chapter 4).
Practically every chemical has the potential to be toxic in the right
circumstances.
Anyone, with or without hep C, can get liver damage from drugs or
chemicals. But hepatitis C disease, like other liver diseases, can
make you more sensitive to liver damage for the following reasons:
 Your liver isn’t working so efficiently, so chemicals and drugs
that are normally processed by the liver remain in your body
longer than expected. When drugs linger in your body, you
can get more side effects.
 Your liver already has damage from hepatitis C, so additional
damage from a liver toxin can be dangerous and seriously
affect liver function.
As you read this chapter, list the potentially toxic substances you
use — such as herbal remedies or alcohol — and the toxins in your
environment — such as cleaners and pesticides. Make a list in your
hep C notebook (see Chapter 5) that includes each dangerous sub-
stance from this chapter that you come into contact with. After
you make your list, you can work to avoid exposure to some of
these chemicals or discuss them with your doctor.

Managing Medications,
Supplements, and Herbs
In an awful irony, some of the medications, supplements, and herbs
you take to feel better may actually cause harm, especially if you
have hep C. Many of these products have the potential for hepato-
toxicity (liver damage). You may be surprised by what can harm
the liver. Then again, you may not be surprised when you consider
that the liver metabolizes almost every drug you take. And having
liver disease can mean that your body doesn’t metabolize medica-
tions (and all chemicals) so quickly, which can lead to more side
effects.
Adding to the problem is the possibility that different medications
you take (including herbs, vitamins, and OTC drugs) and other
toxins can interact with one another in a way that’s harmful.
The most well-known example is the danger to your liver of taking
acetaminophen (Tylenol) at very high doses (more than 2,000 mil-
ligrams per day) or taking it with alcohol (see the “Giving Up
Alcohol” section, later in this chapter). When taken correctly, acet-
aminophen is generally safe for use with hep C.
Making safety a priority
Go to your medicine chest and make a list of all OTC medications,
prescriptions, vitamins, supplements, and herbs you’ve taken
recently. (If you haven’t taken the product recently, you may want
to throw it out, especially if it’s out of date.) Include the dose for
each and run this list by your physician if you haven’t cleared
everything with her already.
Consider all of your medications, whether they’re supplements,
herbal remedies, or OTC or prescription drugs. Follow these
simple rules to keep yourself safe:
 Take only substances that are essential and prescribed or rec-
ommended by a healthcare practitioner.
 Make sure your healthcare practitioners are knowledgeable
about liver disease (see Chapter 5 for more info on finding
and communicating with healthcare providers).
 Tell all your healthcare providers about every single medica-
tion that passes through your lips, nose, or skin and keep
them informed of any changes in your medications.
Chapter 12: Avoiding Harmful Substances 159

 If you develop any reaction to a new or old medication, con-
tact your healthcare provider immediately.
 Get all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy. This
way, the pharmacist has a record of all your medications and
can note potential drug interactions and prevent problems.
Don’t stop taking any prescribed medication without first checking
with your doctor. Some medications must be stopped slowly, and if
you go off them on your own, you could risk serious complications.
Watching out for OTC and 
prescription medications
Over-the-counter drugs have the advantage that you don’t need a
prescription or health insurance to get them. The disadvantage is
that you may not be aware of the potential dangers of certain OTC
medications on their own or in combination with other drugs.
You need a doctor’s okay for prescription medications, which are
also covered by some health insurance policies. An advantage of
prescription medications is that you have contact with a pharma-
cist who can answer questions and look out for drug interactions.
To check on the possibility of liver problems with any OTC or pre-
scription medications you’re taking, your first resource should be
your doctor.
Hundreds of medications can potentially cause liver damage or
complications. In this section, I list some of the top offenders and
those that you’re most likely to encounter by generic name (with
the brand name in parentheses):

Chapter 12: Avoiding Harmful Substances 161
Acetaminophen (or paracetamol in other countries) has been well
documented to cause liver damage in high doses or when combined
with alcohol. However, it’s also frequently the treatment of choice
for aches and pains that come with hepatitis C. So take this med-
ication only under the advice of your doctor.
If you like to do your own research, visit www.medlineplus.gov,
go to the Drug Information section, and find your drug.
Surveying vitamin and 
mineral supplements
Some folks like to pick supplements on the recommendations of
friends or after reading an article. When you have hepatitis C, play
it safe and take vitamin and mineral supplements only as recom-
mended by your doctor. Just like the OTC and prescription drugs
mentioned earlier, some supplements, especially at high doses, can
cause liver problems.
Take any vitamins as prescribed, but don’t decide on your own to
take even more vitamins. Your doctor will probably prescribe a
multivitamin with 100 percent of the RDA (recommended dietary
allowance) and maybe other supplements as well. (If you have cir-
rhosis, you may have vitamin or mineral deficiencies and may need

more vitamins or minerals.) Most vitamins and minerals aren’t a
problem for the liver, but the following three, which are each
stored by the liver, can be dangerous if taken at high doses:
 Vitamin A: In high doses, this fat-soluble vitamin that’s stored
in the liver can be toxic. Don’t exceed 5,000 units per day.
 Iron: The liver metabolizes and stores iron. If you have cirrho-
sis or high levels of iron in your blood, your liver isn’t properly
metabolizing iron. Excess iron can further damage the liver.
Your healthcare provider may advise you to take a multivita-
min without iron.
 Niacin: The RDA of niacin (also called nicotinic acid, nicotin-
amide, and vitamin B3) is 16 milligrams for men, 14 milligrams
for women, 17 milligrams for breastfeeding women, and 18 mil-
ligrams for pregnant women. High doses of niacin (more than
500 milligrams) can cause liver problems.
Honing in on herbal products
The appeal of using “natural” products that come from the plant
kingdom is unquestionable — people throughout the world have
been doing so for millennia.
You may want to take herbs for different ailments associated with
liver disease and hepatitis C, but just as I warn for medications,
vitamins, and minerals, some herbs can damage your liver. Do not
self-treat when you have hepatitis C. Don’t take any herbal teas,
supplements, or tinctures (concentrated herbal extracts) — except
with the guidance of a liver-knowledgeable herbalist or doctor.
Some herbal tinctures are alcohol based, making them out of the
question for recovering alcoholics and others who are staying
away from alcohol. Discuss these products with your herbalist and
obtain herbs as capsules, teas, or in nonalcohol-based tinctures.
Here’s a list of herbs that may damage the liver; avoid them unless
advised otherwise by a qualified herbalist:

 Borage (Borago

Cleaning Up Household, Industrial,
and Environmental Toxins
Household, industrial, and environmental toxins are usually
referred to as toxic chemicals. Toxicity is a measure of the danger
of the chemical to the liver, kidney, heart, or brain.
Listing types of chemical toxins
Some chemicals are toxic to the liver, either by causing chemical
hepatitis or by affecting liver enzyme levels (which I discuss in
Chapter 7). Toxic or dangerous chemicals can also be carcinogenic
(cause cancer), affect your immune system, or hurt other organs,
like your brain or kidneys.
Chemicals that are toxic to your liver are in your home, garden,
workplace, and just about anywhere in the environment. You can
be exposed by inhaling toxic fumes, getting some on your skin, or
accidentally getting some in your mouth or eyes. Here’s a list of
some common types of toxic chemicals you may be exposed to:
 Pesticides and insecticides: Chemicals that are meant to kill
critters have a good chance of also being toxic for humans.
These are found in homes as bug sprays for indoor and out-
door use. There might also be residues on your food.
Chapter 12: Avoiding Harmful Substances 163
 Germander (Teucrium
chamaedrys)
 Golden ragwort (Senecio
aureus)
 Groundsel (Senecio
longilobusvulgaris)
 Heliotropium
(Heliotropium
europaeum)
 Hemp agrimony
(Eupatorium 
cannibinum)
 Jin Bu Huan (Lycopocium
serratum)
 Kava (Piper methysticum)
 Margosa or neem oil
(Azadirachta indica)
 Pennyroyal oil (Mentha
pulegium)
 Sassafras (Sassafras
ablidum)
 Senna (Senna alexandrina)
 Skullcap (Scuttellaria 
lateriflora)
 Tansy ragwort (Senecio
jacoboea)
 Uva ursi (Arctostaphylos
uva-ursi)
 Valerian (Valeriana 
officinalis)

 Herbicides: These chemicals are used to control weeds and
can also be toxic.
 Household cleaning products: Agents such as air fresheners,
carpet cleaners, drain cleaners, and furniture polish can con-
tain dangerous chemicals.
 Solvents: Solvents are extremely dangerous because you can
breathe them in or get exposure through your skin. Solvents
are found in the home in products such as carpet glues, clean-
ing fluids, paint, paint thinners, primers, and wood sealers.
Industrial solvents include adhesives, epoxy resins, hardeners,
lacquers, and mastics (asphalt or coal-tar).
Because you probably have at least some of these chemicals
around your house, you need to know how to use them safely,
which I describe in the next section.
Putting safety first
Think about it: If a chemical is capable of killing bugs or plants or
erasing oily deposits, what do you think that chemical could do to
your body? I would add that if it smells horrible and you feel sick
from being around it, well, that’s a sign of a chemical you shouldn’t
be around, isn’t it?
Assume that all cleaners, pesticides, and solvents are unsafe so
that you use them with caution, if at all. Follow these guidelines
when using chemicals around the house:
 Limit the amount you use and how often you use the chemicals.
 Read labels carefully.
 Follow directions exactly.
 Don’t mix chemicals.
 Avoid breathing the chemicals by keeping the area well venti-
lated and wearing a protective respiratory mask.
 Cover your skin with clothing and wear rubber or latex gloves
so that the chemicals don’t touch your skin.
 Wash your hands and clothing after using chemicals.
If you or a family member ingests a chemical toxin or gets some on
the skin or in the eyes, call your doctor or 911 immediately.

164

Keeping your home toxin free
Make your home a safe place where you can rest assured that no
noxious chemical agents are lurking. Try some of these sugges-
tions for a home clean home:
 Take an inventory of the cleansers, insecticides, pesticides,
and other chemicals in your house, garage, and shed. Read
the labels and very carefully dispose of old or dangerous
products.
 Shop with your liver in mind. Read product labels carefully
and avoid introducing new toxins into your home as possible.
 Clean without fumigating yourself:
• Buy nontoxic cleaning products (found in health food
stores).
• Make your own cleaning products (try vinegar and
baking soda) and use old-fashioned muscle power 
combined with scrubbing brushes or steel wool.
 Keep away pests without hurting yourself:
• Try organic gardening and lawn care (check out Organic
Gardening For Dummies, by Ann Whitman and the editors
at the National Gardening Association, published by
Wiley).
• Clean your kitchen and garden of all crumbs or debris
that can attract critters.
• Try nonchemical methods of bug control, such as elec-
tronic deterrents or biological control.
• If you must use chemical warfare against pests, wear
protective clothing and gloves.
 Beware of sprays of any kind — most have dangerous chemi-
cals that you could accidentally inhale.
 Try to keep cigarette smoke out of your home. Secondhand
smoke is a carcinogen. If there’s still smoking going on in your
house or pollution from outside, invest in air purifiers that use
a filtration system.
I also discuss using pesticide-free food (organic) and purified water
in Chapter 11.
Chapter 12: Avoiding Harmful Substances 165

In your bathroom, you may have lotions, potions, and cosmetics
with possibly toxic or irritating chemicals. If you have sensitive
skin, you’re allergic to certain products, or you’re generally con-
cerned about your skin-care or shampooing products, speak to
your doctor, pharmacist, or herbalist. And check out the cosmetic
information page on the Food and Drug Administration Web site by
going to www.cfsan.fda.gov and clicking on the Cosmetics link.
Taking care of business: 
Toxic workplaces
Some workplaces can be toxic (I’m talking about chemicals, not
your colleagues or supervisors). If you work at a gas station, dry
cleaner, chemical plant, art studio, or other location where you
face constant exposure to solvents or other poisonous chemicals,
talk to your doctor about your situation and what steps you should
take to deal with the problem.
For more information about toxins in the workplace, contact the
U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) —
the Web site is www.osha.gov — or the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) — www.cdc.gov/niosh.
Your options include changing your job tasks or even leaving your
job if you can’t avoid daily exposure to danger.
Quitting Smoking
Cigarette smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals, and more
than 50 of them are known to cause cancer (carcinogen). As your
risk of liver cancer increases with hepatitis C infection, smoking is
even more dangerous.
But cigarettes aren’t the only culprits in this category. All types of
smoking — cigars, pipes, or even marijuana — carry a danger to
your liver because of the additives and dangerous chemicals that
are produced in the smoke and transported through the lungs to
the bloodstream to the liver. There’s no escape! Most chemicals,
no matter what their entry point, end up in the liver.
Protect your liver and quit smoking today. See your healthcare 
professional for help. You can also check in with the folks at the
American Lung Association (www.lungusa.org) for more informa-
tion on kicking the habit and take part in their free online smoking-
cessation program. And for more info on the dangers of cigarettes,
check out www.ash.org.

166

Giving Up Alcohol
Whether you’re a regular drinker or social sipper, giving up alcohol
belongs near the top of your to-do list if you have hepatitis C. Some
folks will say that a single glass of alcohol can reduce stress or the
risk of heart disease. But when you have hepatitis C, those poten-
tial benefits don’t matter. Consuming any kind of alcohol provides
a risk to your liver that’s greater than any possible benefit.
If you still need convincing, consider the following list of reasons
to eliminate alcohol from your diet:
 Alcohol consumption can lead to fatty liver condition, acute
and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and end-stage liver failure.
 Studies on alcohol use and hep C progression have found a
relationship between heavy drinking and the development of
fibrosis. Studies aren’t clear about how lower levels of drink-
ing might affect hep C.
 In lab studies, alcohol stimulates the growth of the hep C virus.
 Alcohol taken with other drugs, such as acetaminophen
(see the “Watching out for OTC and prescription medications”
section, earlier in the chapter), makes the effect on the liver
much worse.
 Alcoholics may not be able to participate in interferon therapy
(check out Chapter 8). Laboratory studies show that alcohol
reduces the effects of interferon.
 Heavy alcohol consumption will keep you off the waiting list
for a liver transplant (see Chapter 9).
So what were your reasons for drinking?
Defining drinking types and 
identifying a problem
Eliminating alcohol from your life may be easier if you know your
drinking style. Your doctor will inevitably ask you lots of questions
about your drinking. Be truthful. This information enables you and
your healthcare practitioner to devise the most effective treatment
plan possible. (I cover how to work with your doctor in Chapter 5.)
Chapter 12: Avoiding Harmful Substances 167

When adding up how much you drink, count one drink as the 
following:
 12 ounces of beer
 5 ounces of wine
 11⁄2 ounces of liquor
Use this rough guide to the drinking types to figure out where you
fit in. Amounts can vary, depending on your weight and gender.
 Abstainer (nondrinker): Doesn’t drink at all.
 Social drinker: Likes to drink but could easily give it up and
may be a light, moderate, or heavy social drinker.
• Light social drinker: One drink or less per week.
• Moderate social drinker: One to two drinks per night.
• Heavy social drinker: More than one or two drinks per
night.
 Problem drinker or alcoholic: Has lost the ability to control
his drinking. It doesn’t matter whether drinking is moderate
or heavy or occurs only during binges (heavy drinking at inter-
vals). If you suspect that you fall within this category, please
seek help as described in the section “Getting Help for Alcohol
or Drug Addiction,” later in this chapter.
Alcohol can damage the body, whether you drink socially or alco-
holically. If you have hepatitis C, avoid it. The difference is that a
social drinker can usually stop, whereas an alcoholic needs help. If
you believe you’re a social drinker, check out the “Socializing with-
out drinking” section, later in the chapter.
There’s no shame in having a drinking problem. Alcoholism is a
disease shared by millions of Americans, and many have obtained
help. Here’s a list of questions to see whether you may be a prob-
lem drinker or alcoholic:
 Are you worried about your drinking?
 Do you drink alone?
 Do you drink to numb your feelings?
 Does your drinking affect your work?
 Does your drinking worry your family or friends?
 Have you tried to control your drinking?
 Do you ever forget what happened while you were drinking?
 Do you get sick with headaches or hangovers after drinking?
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
168

If you answered yes to one or more of these questions, you may
have a problem with alcohol. Seek professional help and see the
section on “Getting Help for Alcohol or Drug Addiction,” later in
the chapter.
Socializing without drinking
People in movies, on television, at parties, on the beach, by the
pool, at the club, and at the bar all seem to be drinking up a storm.
You may wonder how the heck you can give up such wonderful
stuff. But a closer look at the Hollywood version of drinking yields
tales of alcoholism and woe. And for people with hep C, the poten-
tial danger to your liver outweighs any possible benefit.
For social drinkers, here are some tips to get through life without
drinking. If you’re a problem drinker, seek professional help.
 Keep your house alcohol free, if possible.
 Enlist help from your support network (see Chapter 14).
 Use relaxation techniques such as meditation and yoga (see
Chapter 13).
If people ask why you’re not drinking, you don’t have to tell them
about your hepatitis unless you want to. Nowadays, many people
give up alcohol for health or diet reasons. You’re among a growing
number of people who choose not to drink. Try one of the smooth
nonalcoholic drinks listed in Chapter 11. Holding a wineglass filled
with club soda and a twist of lemon will help you feel like part of
the merriment and not obviously different.
Dealing with Dangerous
Street Drugs
Sharing equipment when injecting or snorting drugs is one of the
ways to acquire hepatitis C. If you’ve given up illegal drugs, hats off
to you. If you’re still hooked, check out the “Getting Help for Alcohol
or Drug Addiction” section, later in the chapter. Even if you already
have hepatitis C, you’re endangering yourself by continuing to use
drugs.
Illegal drugs can accelerate the hepatitis C disease because they
cause the following problems:
Chapter 12: Avoiding Harmful Substances 169

 Reduce your immune response.
 Expose you to toxins from the impurities added to street drugs.
 Impair your ability to respond to treatment (if you can even
get treatment while using drugs).
 Eliminate your ability to receive a liver transplant until you
are off illicit drugs for six months.
 Increase your risk of getting superinfected with hepatitis B,
HIV, or another type of hepatitis C by sharing paraphernalia
associated with injection or snorting drug use. See Chapter 2
for information on transmission and protecting others from
hep C.
With street drugs, the drug itself or the method of intake, whether
it’s injecting, snorting, or smoking, can be dangerous. Cocaine has
been shown to directly cause liver toxicity. Whether you smoke,
snort, or inject cocaine, you’re hurting your liver. Snorting cocaine
through a shared straw can spread hepatitis C because doing so
causes frequent nosebleeds.
The bottom line is to stop using or at least reduce your use of all
illicit or street drugs. I know — if it were so easy, you’d have
stopped using long ago. Do it differently this time and get help.
And give yourself lots of TLC (tender loving care) as you learn to
live drug free.
Getting Help for Alcohol or
Drug Addiction
If you can’t stop drinking or using drugs on your own, don’t lose
hope! Here’s a plan of action:
 See your doctor or healthcare practitioner. He can refer you to
alcohol or drug treatment and suggest a detoxification plan to
help you through alcohol and/or drug withdrawal.
 Call the National Drug and Alcohol Treatment Referral Routing
Service (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment) at 800-662-
HELP (800-662-4357) to find treatment programs in your 
community.
 Contact Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous
(NA) for info on their 12-step programs and to find out how
to attend a meeting near your home. Check your local phone
book for contact info or check out either organization online
by logging on to www.alcoholics-anonymous.org or
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
170

www.na.org. Both sites provide contact information for
groups and meetings in your area. Here is some general info
on these programs:
• The 12-step approach helps you recover from addiction
by changing your attitudes and behavior.
• You’ll meet and get support from others who have suc-
cessfully given up their substance of choice — one day
at a time.
• AA and NA are not religious programs, but they do use a
spiritual approach. You can be an atheist or agnostic
and still get help.
Recognizing that the drink or drug you first took to feel good is
now killing you is shocking and scary. Don’t numb that feeling.
You deserve to live and have a good life.

tress happens — to everyone. But when you’re facing a chronic
illness like hepatitis C, the stress can be more pronounced,
and its effects can be more harmful. Hepatitis C also comes with its
own set of physical complications and problems. But whether you’re
experiencing the mental, emotional, or physical effects of stress, or
you’re fighting fatigue and anxiety, adding some exercise or move-
ment to your routine can help you feel better. In this chapter, I define
stress and its role in your life but quickly move on to simple tips to
reduce that stress. Then I describe multiple techniques to soothe
your body, mind, and spirit.
Explore the options in this chapter and pick a few that work for you.
You can try exercises like walking or swimming or the more subtle
but powerful ancient movements of T’ai Chi, Qigong, or Yoga. Or
consider visiting a qualified bodywork practitioner who can help
you relieve muscle tension and relax. You can even try not moving!
Practice calmness by using breathing, relaxation, meditation, or
visualizing techniques. I cover all of these ideas — and more.

Getting a Handle on Stress
and Hepatitis C
We live in a world where lots of people are stressed out. So what
exactly is this stress that everyone talks about? One way of defining
stress is the body’s response to a change or challenge. The change
or challenge that causes the stress is called a stressor, which could
be anything from the freezing temperature outside, to a new medi-
cine you’re taking, to an attack dog that’s charging after you! Stress
is so important that I define different types — short or long term
and physical or emotional stress — in the following sections. 
Acute versus chronic stress
During the stress response, energy is diverted from your immune,
digestive, and reproductive systems and focused on giving you a
supreme burst of energy.
The body is designed to deal with short-term (acute) stress. When a
stressor first arrives — in the form of an attack dog, for example —
your body takes most of its energy reserves to fight or help you run
like the devil to save your life. When the dog is gone, your body
returns to normal because you no longer need the extra energy
diverted to save your life.
In modern times, we have a lot of long-term (chronic) stress. These
are challenges that don’t go away and keep us stressed out for long
periods of time. These stressors can range from a difficult boss or
financial worries to a long-term chronic illness, like hepatitis C.
This fight-or-flight biological response was better suited to the pre-
carious lives of cave dwellers and their many physical threats.
The problem with long-term stress is that your body doesn’t get to
go back to a nonstressed state. In modern times, when mundane
things like traffic jams and deadlines trigger stress, it’s not so useful
to lose precious energy in response to these almost-constant stres-
sors. When you have hepatitis C, the last thing you want is for
energy to be taken away from your immune system.
Physical stress
A healthy body is in an exquisite state of balance called home-
ostasis. Any disruption to your body from an injury or an illness
causes physical stress. The hepatitis C virus causes physical
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
174

stress just by being a foreigner in your body and making your
immune system go into attack mode.
Likewise, to keep its balance, your body needs proper amounts
and types of nutrition, rest, movement, fresh air, and warmth.
Too much of anything (including food, exercise, and heat) and the
wrong types of things (such as polluted air, junk food, and danger-
ous drugs) also cause stress.
If a physical stress is short term — like missing some sleep on
exam night or having an occasional ice cream — the body can usu-
ally recover. But with long-term physical stress, like not sleeping
for weeks or smoking cigarettes for years, the body has a more 
difficult time regaining its balance.
Emotional and mental stress
Much of our modern stress comes from mental and emotional anxi-
ety. Pressures and worries to get to work on time, make deadlines,
pay bills, get your kids into college, and so on can trigger an emo-
tional stress response. With hep C, you probably have worries
related to one or more of the following things:
 Overall health
 Sexual interest or ability (due to hepatitis C or medication)
 Financial situation
 Work hours, job conditions, or the job itself
 Lifestyle (diet, alcohol consumption, smoking)
And I’m sure you can add a few more worries of your own.
Emotional stress is a funny thing because any type of change, even
good change, can be stressful. Think of the stress that can accom-
pany the first year of marriage or bringing home a new baby!
Linking stress and illness
Illness is a major challenge to the normal workings of your body
and causes stress in different ways. The physical aspects of the
stress caused by hep C are pretty straightforward and include the
interaction among the following:
 The hepatitis C virus: The virus is growing and making pro-
teins inside your body, which affects your immune system,
your liver cells, and other parts of your body.
Chapter 13: Moving and Grooving to Reduce Stress 175

 The immune system: Your immune system is now in attack
mode because it senses danger from the hep C virus.
 Your liver: The liver has trouble doing its job when the war
between the hep C virus and the immune system is being
fought in its midst.
These physical components of hepatitis C virus infection interact
with the emotional aspects of stress. Anxiety, fatigue, and depres-
sion are common emotional components of hepatitis C. (I delve
into depression in hepatitis C in Chapter 14 and discuss anxiety
and fatigue in the following sections.)
Because stress hormones affect the brain and the body, stress
affects your mind and your body. Whether you have physical or
emotional stress, remember that stress of one type can add to
the stress of another type, so stress itself is stressful! It’s a two-way
street: Physical stress can lead to emotional stress, and emotional
stress can lead to physical stress. And both play a role in lessening
your body’s ability to protect itself against hep C.
If you try the self-help tips described in this chapter and still suffer
from anxiety, fatigue, or depression, discuss these problems with
your doctor. In some cases, your doctor may be able to make fur-
ther suggestions or prescribe or change your medication.
Looking at anxiety and tension
Anxiety is a type of emotional stress based on worrying thoughts.
You know it’s anxiety when your thoughts start with the words what
if. Anxiety is part of a natural fear response to a threat or challenge
to your life. But when anxiety reaches a peak, that’s called a panic
attack, in which your biological stress response really goes haywire.
Muscle tension is one symptom of anxiety, and you may have
sore shoulders, neck, or back. The pain of being tense can lead
to headaches and difficulty sleeping.
Fitting fatigue into the picture
Fatigue is probably the most commonly reported symptom of hep C.
I’m not talking about just drowsiness, which is a feeling of sleepiness
or needing more sleep. Fatigue is the term for feelings of low energy,
weariness, or being tired.
Researchers haven’t been able to prove whether the fatigue from
hepatitis C is due directly to the virus or results from the emotional
response to and stress of being ill. This is a chicken-and-egg ques-
tion: Which came first? If you’re suffering from fatigue, however, all
that really matters is that you want to feel better soon.

Reducing stress —
one way or another
Because stress is so pervasive in modern life and potentially 
harmful — even more so for folks with a chronic illness like hep C —
I have lots of suggestions for ways to deal with stress and diminish
its effects on your health and your life in general. Pick the ones that
feel most useful to you.
The key to keeping stress from hurting you is in your reaction to it.
Practice some of these techniques, and you’ll be humming or gig-
gling instead of stressing out.
Taking care of body basics
You can start fighting stress by taking care of your body:
 Exercise. Find out about the different types of exercise you
may want to consider in the section “Considering types of
exercise,” later in the chapter.
 Regularly eat nutritious meals. I discuss this topic in
Chapter 11.
 Get enough quality sleep. When you have hep C, you may
have trouble sleeping. For tips on sleep, see Chapter 21.
Keeping the physical body in good shape gives you more resilience
to deal with stress. Remember to avoid physical stressors like
breathing polluted air, smoking cigarettes, taking street drugs, and
drinking alcohol (see Chapter 12).
Respecting your limits and needs
An important part of emotional stress is the feeling of not having
control over your life. You may feel that having hepatitis C has put
you on a roller coaster that you don’t know how to stop. Here are
some ways to bring back some of your personal power:
 Say no. One of the easiest ways to get stressed is to take on
too many tasks. Recognize your limits and accept them.
 Ask for help. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Ask your family
and friends, social service workers, doctors, fellow support
group members, and neighbors for help when you need it
(see Chapter 14 for more on support).
 Get information. The more you know about your options
with hep C, the more empowered and less stressed you’ll feel.
That’s what this book is all about, and Chapter 22 contains
other sources of information.
Chapter 13: Moving and Grooving to Reduce Stress 177

 Keep your health info organized. A hep C notebook may seem
like a stressful task initially, but in the long run, organization
will make your life easier (see Chapter 5 for info on setting up
such a notebook). Also keep your health insurance claims and
medical bills organized in one place (see Chapter 16).
Relaxing your body and easing your thoughts
Stress and anxiety make your body tense, tense, tense. Your worries
may be keeping you from a restful sleep, but engaging in body-based
therapies can help you relax. In the “Experiencing Body-Based
Therapies” section, later in the chapter, I cover many of these
forms of relief.
Enjoying life
If you’re not feeling well, you may forget to do the things you love.
I’m reminding you now to remember the pleasures of life, which can
distract you from your pain and may even make you feel better.
 Listen to music. Music therapy can bring you some joy. Find
a CD or radio station that plays music that soothes you,
whether it’s jazz, classical, or folk. Other types of sounds,
such as waves, sometimes also have a calming effect.
 Engage your creative side. Everyone has creativity waiting to
be expressed. Lose yourself in drawing, taking photographs,
or sewing a piece of patchwork. Or maybe you enjoy dancing,
playing the piano, cooking a meal, or arranging a few flowers
in a vase.
 Connect with nature. Try to experience nature. Whether it’s
the beach, a forest, or the mountains, get outdoors and
breathe some fresh air. Or simply go to your backyard or a
local park and notice the different types of trees and flowers
 Focus on spirituality. Whether you belong to an organized
religion or you have your own way of expressing the divine,
find a way to bring the sacred to your everyday life: Light a
candle, say the prayers of your particular faith, or make up
your own prayers. I offer suggestions for meditation, which
can be used as one way to get in touch with your spiritual side,
in “Quieting the mind with meditation,” later in this chapter.
 Play with your pets. Research has shown that spending time
with your furry friends helps reduce stress. They’re less
stressed than humans are, so they can help you relax, espe-
cially when they start purring or wagging their tails.
 Spend time with family and friends. Have you stayed in con-
tact with close family and friends? In today’s world, it’s easy to
isolate yourself or get too busy to keep in touch with others.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
178

But calling an old friend or inviting a family member to dinner
can give you a real pick-me-up. Your family and friends may
want to read Chapter 19, which I wrote just for them.
 Enjoy intimacy. Everyone needs to feel connected and close
to loved ones, but that can be hard for people with hepatitis
C. I cover communicating with your loved one and sexual
issues in Chapter 15. 
 Find humor: Laughter is a known healer. Find a funny movie
or interact with pets or children who have a sense of humor.
Exercising Your Fitness Options
Moving around can be the solution to the fatigue, stress, and achy
joints that often come with hep C. Your body is meant to be
moving in some way or another.
Why exercise?
When you’re tired, exercise is probably the last thing on your mind.
Think again. Exercise actually has the ability to make you feel less
tired — no, I’m not kidding. Exercise offers the following benefits:
 Boosts your energy levels
 Improves the functioning of your immune system
 Helps control your weight
 Helps you sleep better
 Improves your endurance
 Increases strength in your muscles
 Relieves stress and anxiety
 Enhances your mood
All those rewards for a relatively small investment of your time!
The trick is to put on your sneakers, drive to the gym, or schedule
some time to watch that exercise video. Whatever amount or type
of exercise you can muster will help you feel better.
Sticking with an exercise program
Like many a New Year’s resolution, starting a new exercise regimen
is easier than keeping it going. In this section, I focus on tips to help
you achieve continued success with your program.
Chapter 13: Moving and Grooving to Reduce Stress 179

Before starting any exercise program, check with your doctor. After
getting the green light, if you experience any symptoms during
exercise — such as chest pain, breathlessness, nausea, lighthead-
edness, or extreme fatigue — pay another visit to your healthcare
provider.
If you have cirrhosis or portal hypertension (see Chapter 4), you
may need to avoid certain exercises or positions. Talk with your
doctor for specific advice.
Here are some suggestions to increase the likelihood that you’ll
stick to your fitness routine:
 Determine your goals. Depending on your level of fitness,
your hep C symptoms, and the condition of your liver and
heart, you may have any or all of the following goals when you
start an exercise:
• Increase the mobility of your joints
• Ease your aches and pains
• Sleep better
• Have more energy
• Lose a couple inches around your waist
• Become more fit
 Get professional advice. Your healthcare professional, a per-
sonal trainer, or qualified instructors in the exercise of your
choice are good sources to contact. If you’re new to exercise
in general, you’re beginning a new exercise regimen, or you’re
coming back to exercise after an illness, a pro can help guide
you and devise a plan that fits your health and exercise goals.
 Start gently and build slowly. Don’t overdo it, especially at
first. Start with 5 minutes and work up to 20 to 30 minutes of
exercise per day for 3 days a week. You can then increase the
number of days or amount of time if that’s appropriate for
you. Too much exercise can tire you out and lead to exhaus-
tion. Too little exercise, and you won’t get as much benefit.
 Choose a time that’s convenient. If you work out at a time
that’s good for you, you’re more likely to exercise. Many
people exercise in the morning to avoid procrastination later
in the day. On the other hand, your body may be suppler
later in the day.
 Pick an exercise you enjoy. If you dislike an activity, you
aren’t likely to keep it up for long. Consider activities such as
working in the garden, dancing, walking your dog, or playing
with children as ways to work exercise into your day.

Considering types of exercise
Exercise is divided into three categories: aerobic, strength training,
and stretching. Most exercises or types of movement fall into more
than one of these categories. Your exercise program should opti-
mally provide a balance of all three.
Aerobic activities
Aerobic means “with air” or “using oxygen,” and if done with a cer-
tain intensity, these exercises will make you huff and puff. Aerobic
exercise helps you burn fat and decrease the risks of heart disease
and cancer. The following are the more common aerobic exercises:
 Walking: By far, walking is the easiest, most popular, and least
costly sport to pursue. All you need are good-quality walking
shoes, a jacket for rain or cold, sunglasses, and sunscreen.
Start by walking around your block and work your way up to
longer walks. To start a walking program, check out Fitness
Walking For Dummies, by Liz Neporent (published by Wiley).
 Swimming: Get your bathing suit and goggles and head for
the nearest pool. Check out the local public pool; the YMCA;
or private pools at a swim club, country club, or neighbor-
hood clubhouse. If you decide that swimming is your thing,
you can often obtain a season pass or yearly membership.
 Bicycling: Bicycling can be fun, and you may even be able to
cycle to work, the library, or the supermarket. When you go out
on the road, put on a helmet, watch out for vehicles, and obey
safety rules. If you use a stationary bicycle at home or at the
gym, you can watch television or read a book at the same time.
 Low-impact aerobics classes or videos: Visit your local YMCA
or fitness club or rent or buy videotapes or DVDs of experi-
enced fitness instructors. You can also borrow them for free
from your public library.
Strength training
Keeping your muscles toned and strong is the purpose of strength-
ening exercises. Benefits include boosting your metabolism,
decreasing the risks of osteoporosis, building joint strength, pro-
viding balance, and aiding posture. You can use light weights or
strength-training machines at home or head to the gym to work
out under supervision.
Stretching
Performing stretching exercises will increase your flexibility and
can give you some relief from aches and pains. Yoga is a great way
Chapter 13: Moving and Grooving to Reduce Stress 181

to develop flexibility, and T’ai Chi also works on improving flexibility
(I cover these options in the section “Using Mind-Body Techniques,”
later in the chapter). Or try Pilates or other stretching classes or
tapes to stay supple.
Using Mind-Body Techniques
All exercise of your physical body also affects your mind — because
the body and mind are intricately connected. But some systems of
movement are designed as a whole system of wellness for the body
and mind, and even for the spirit. The centuries-old exercises
described here have been designed to align the body and mind
toward health.
Yearning for Yoga
Yoga has been practiced in India for thousands of years and now is
enjoyed by millions of people around the world. Yoga is what you
make of it and can be used as simply another type of fitness exercise
or as a healthy approach to life. Yoga isn’t a religion, and people of
any background can study Yoga.
The beauty of Yoga is that you can benefit from any of the aspects
of it: breathing, physical postures, meditation, or relaxation. Most
people who study Yoga today focus on the postures, or positions, that
are meant to maximize flexibility and stimulate the mind, body, and
spirit. Postures can be performed sitting, standing, or lying down.
Many Yoga classes end with a period of relaxation and/or meditation.
If you’re a beginning yogi (male) or yogini (female), take a class
with a qualified teacher to learn how to move properly. You can
also purchase Yoga videos. Get recommendations for videos or
classes from friends or folks in your hep C support group.
Don’t compare yourself with the other people in your Yoga class.
Yoga is an individual pursuit, and keep in mind that you’re working
with your body. Even though Yoga can be gentle, you can injure
yourself if you push too hard or use the wrong postures.
Energizing with T’ai Chi
T’ai Chi (pronounced tie-chee) is a gentle martial art that has been
practiced in China for thousands of years. T’ai Chi is a set of grace-
ful movements that flow into one another that you perform while
standing. T’ai Chi is a low-impact activity and can be performed
without stressing your joints.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
182

This ancient Chinese martial art is considered a perfect balance
between yin and yang — opposite forces (see Chapter 10 for dis-
cussion of yin and yang). In T’ai Chi, you slow down so that your
awareness increases, and each movement you make is deliberate
and powerful. T’ai chi uses exercises that
 Combine body and mind
 Use mindful breathing
 Focus on vital energy called chi
Chi is energy that’s sometimes spelled qi (as in the Chinese practice
Qigong); both spellings are pronounced chee, as in cheese. Chi within
the body flows through meridians or channels (also described with
acupuncture in Chapter 10). Chi also exists in the universe around
us, in living plants and animals as well as inanimate objects.
You can learn T’ai Chi by attending a class or watching a video,
and then you can practice in a group or on your own. In China, mil-
lions of people practice T’ai Chi daily, and T’ai Chi classes are held
in parks around the world. See the sidebar “T’ai Chi and immunity”
in this chapter for more information on the subject.
Technically, T’ai Chi is one of the many forms of Qigong. T’ai Chi
and Qigong can be practiced separately or in combination. Qigong
is a series of shorter exercises that involve movement, breathing,
and relaxation. Qigong is a profound way to move energy in your
body and is used for healing. A master of Qigong can use this
energy to heal others.
Chapter 13: Moving and Grooving to Reduce Stress 183
T’ai Chi and immunity
An exciting research finding (reported in the September/October 2003 issue of the
journal Psychosomatic Medicine) found that T’ai Chi could boost immunity to a virus
infection. Researchers studied a type of T’ai Chi, called T’ai Chi Chih, for 15 weeks
in older people in California. When they were tested afterward, the people who had
performed the T’ai Chi had improved scores on a test of immunity against the virus
that causes chicken pox and shingles.
The researchers who performed the study (Michael R. Irwin, Jennifer L. Pike, Jason
C. Cole, and Michael N. Oxman) believe that T’ai Chi probably increases immunity
for other viruses, not just for the virus in their study. Further studies will look at how
long the increased immunity lasts. If T’ai Chi can increase immunity to one type of
virus, it could possibly help with immunity to the hepatitis C virus, too. More studies
are needed to prove this connection between T’ai Chi and other types of immunity.

Experiencing Body-Based
Therapies
If your muscles are achy or tense, which can happen when you
have hepatitis C, or you just feel the need for some healing touch,
find a qualified, experienced practitioner for body work. It’s a treat
for the body, mind, and spirit.
To find a massage therapist or reiki practitioner, ask your health-
care practitioners, friends, or family for recommendations. Some
health insurance plans now cover alternative treatments such as
massage. Check with your insurance provider and get a referral
from your primary care physician, if necessary. If you don’t have
access to insurance coverage for these therapies, some practition-
ers use sliding scales for payment.
Massage therapy
Having a massage may seem like a luxury, but it can really help you
feel better quicker. A trained and licensed massage therapist uses
her hands to knead your muscles. Primarily used for relaxation, a
massage can reduce tension, increase circulation, and help ease
achy joints. Types of massage include the following:
 Swedish massage: This manipulation of muscles and joints is
the most common type of massage and was originally devel-
oped in Sweden.
 Deep-tissue massage: The practitioner really goes deep into
your muscles to ease out knots of tension.
 Hot-stone massage: This massage uses heated smooth stones
to send warmth to tight muscles and as aids to work through
your muscles. The warm stones help you feel nurtured during
the massage.
 Aromatherapy: The practitioner mixes healing essential oils,
such as lavender or rosemary, with the body oil or lotion
that’s rubbed into your body. This is smelly in a good way.
The above types of massages require you to be undressed, with your
body draped with a sheet, while the practitioner uses oils or lotions
to massage or stroke your body. The practices below are performed
when you are fully clothed (except for shoes) and don’t use oil:
 Shiatsu: The practitioner presses on your pressure points to
help in relaxation and healing; Shiatsu originated in Japan.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
184

 Reflexology: The practitioner presses on specific points
on your feet (or hands) that correspond to different parts of
your body.
Different practitioners may use one or more of these techniques in
the same session. Tell your practitioner about any aches and pains,
relax on the massage table, and enjoy!
If your family wants to know what to get you for your birthday or
the holidays, suggest a session or two of body work. Also, you may
get a discount if you book a few sessions at once.
Energy work
Whereas a massage therapist manipulates your physical body to
help you relax, an energy worker helps you relax on an energetic
level. Not everyone grooves with this technique, but it works —
trust me! Energy work is preferable to massage if you don’t want to
be massaged or get undressed. It’s possible to do some types of
energy work with hands near but not touching the body.
The beliefs behind energy work are that the body is made of energy
and that illness or disease is the result of an energy imbalance.
Whether you believe in that or not, energy work can result in pro-
found relaxation, which lets the body heal itself. Two examples of
energy work are:
 Reiki (pronounced ray-key) is a form of hands-on energy 
healing that originated in Japan. The practitioner is channel-
ing universal energy to you through her hands. Check out
www.reiki.org to find out more about reiki.
 Therapeutic touch was originally developed by a nurse and
a healer and has specific treatments for different ailments.
The practitioner uses his hands to help unblock your energy.
Healing touch is another form of treatment that developed
from therapeutic touch. Check out www.healingtouch.net
to find out more about this type of healing work.
Practitioners (some of whom are registered nurses and medical
doctors) carry out therapeutic touch and reiki in some hospital
and hospice settings. A practitioner may use energy work in con-
junction with a complementary practice, such as massage.
Chinese medicine also has forms of energy work: Qigong and
acupuncture/acupressure, which work with the energy meridians.
See the “Energizing with T’ai Chi” section, earlier in this chapter,
and Chapter 10 for more information.
Chapter 13: Moving and Grooving to Reduce Stress 185

Calming Yourself
You may not be able to get to a practitioner to help you relax. So
here are some techniques you can use in your home or even at
work on a daily basis. When your body and mind are relaxed, your
body stands a better chance of healing itself.
Relaxing the body
Anxiety and tension can lead to muscle aches, headaches, and
trouble sleeping. You can use the technique of progressive relax-
ation in bed or at the end of an exercise session to help you relax.
Progressive relaxation is a method of releasing tension in your
body by focusing on one body part at a time — that’s where the
“progressive” part comes in. You might find a tape or practice
relaxation in a Yoga class. Here’s a brief example of a progressive
relaxation technique. Take each step slowly:
1. Lie down on your back and make yourself comfortable.
2. Take a few deep breaths.
3. Starting with your feet, relax your left foot, followed by
your right foot, your left leg, and then your right leg.
4. Move your concentration up to your buttocks and pelvis
and then on to your abdomen and lower back, chest, and
shoulders.
5. Finally, concentrate on relaxing your left hand and arm,
right hand and arm, and then your neck and head.
Another version of this exercise calls for tightening each part of
the body as you think of it and then relaxing that part. Enjoy the
feeling of peace and ease. Breathe. The more you practice relax-
ation, the easier it becomes.
Focusing on your breath
The breath is essential for life. It forms a cycle of in with life-giving
oxygen and out with poisonous carbon dioxide. Many forms of
exercise (such as Pilates) and mind-body techniques (including
T’ai Chi and Yoga) have specific instructions for breathing.
When you’re stressed or nervous, you may find that your breathing
changes. The breath is a constant and gentle reminder of the flow of
life. Focusing on breathing is a way to slow down and relax. Breathing
techniques can be used anywhere, anytime: at home, in the doctor’s
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
186

office, in the car, on the telephone, or at work. When you focus on
your breathing or perform a breathing exercise, you’re consciously
relaxing your breath, which aids in overall relaxation and allows
your body to get the oxygen it needs.
Here are some ideas for breathing exercises. Sit up straight in a
chair, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing:
 Pay attention to your breath. That’s it. Just paying attention
to each breath is a way of relaxation.
 Take deeper breaths. When you fully release the stale air from
your lungs, you create more room for oxygenated air to enter.
 Hold the air briefly in between in and out breaths. Try
breathing in through your nose, holding your breath, and then
whooshing the air out through your mouth two or three times.
Make sure you’re breathing fresh air when doing breathing exercises.
Buddhist and Yoga practices of meditation both focus on the breath.
If you go to Yoga classes, you’ll find out about breathing there, too.
Quieting the mind with meditation
One dictionary defines meditation as thinking about something,
but the practice of meditation is actually to not think or, if you do
think, to focus on something peaceful or spiritual.
Mediation is used to quiet the mind, achieve inner peace, and 
connect with the universal spirit. Practicing meditation to quiet
the mind reduces some of the thoughts and worries that lead to
stress and anxiety. You can gain peace and bring in your spirit for
renewed energy to help you heal from hep C. Many religions have
specific meditation practices. Here are some common ways to
achieve the state of meditation:
 Go to a quiet place. Turn off your telephone, close your door,
and shut down the computer.
 Set aside a period of time. It can be a few minutes or an hour.
 Be comfortable. In some Buddhist and Yoga practices, you sit
in certain positions, but being uncomfortable can take your
focus off the meditation. The most common position for medi-
tation is sitting on the floor with a pillow or sitting on a straight
chair. Some people lie in a comfortable position (though you
might fall asleep that way).
 Close your eyes. But if you’re meditating by focusing on some-
thing like a candle flame or flower, you can keep your eyes open.
Chapter 13: Moving and Grooving to Reduce Stress 187

 Focus on something. Here are some suggestions:
• A mantra: You can repeat a word — such as God, love,
or one — over and over.
• Your breath: Focus on the in and out breaths, as well as
the space between the breaths.
• Nothing: Hold onto nothing. When a thought comes, and
it will, let it go. Treat each thought like a passing cloud
and keep your mind like an empty blue sky.
But you don’t have to be in sitting in a room by yourself with your
eyes closed to meditate. You can meditate while taking a walk or
otherwise enjoying time outdoors or in a place of worship. Some
people meditate with a group or use a meditation tape to help
them. Or be in a noisy place and focus on being quiet within your-
self. If you’re in the “groove,” you can do anything in a meditative
state — you might call it a state of acute consciousness of the
moment.
Guided imagery
If you add mental pictures to your meditation or relaxation, you’re
engaging in visualization or imagery. If you use a tape to guide you,
that’s called guided imagery. A guided meditation usually lasts for
20 to 40 minutes; it starts with relaxation of your body and breathing
exercises and then brings in images so you can go on an imaginary
journey in your mind. For example, you might start on a sandy
beach with the sun shining. You can use guided imagery for
 Relaxation: One benefit of using images is that it helps you
relax. If you’re thinking about a grassy meadow with wildflow-
ers and butterflies and a soft breeze blowing the fluffy clouds,
you’re not thinking about your physical or mental problems.
 Healing thoughts: Some guided meditations include positive
healing thoughts. While you’re in a relaxed state, you’re open
to positive suggestion, such as “my body is relaxed,” “my liver
is healthy,” or “my immune system is strong.” See Chapter 14
for more examples of positive thoughts to use for healing.
If you can forget your worries and think positive thoughts, you
may experience a calming effect and maybe even experience some
healing. With guided imagery, you use the images to visualize relax-
ation and health. To find tapes of guided imagery, ask people at
your hep C support group, your mental health or complementary
or alternative therapist, or the folks at a bookstore. Some people
make their own tapes to listen to.

Chapter 14
Surrounding Yourself
with Support
In This Chapter
 Looking at the emotional side of living with hep C
 Turning to a support group
 Seeing a mental health professional
 Networking with others and becoming an advocate
 Viewing the glass as half full
A
t times, living with a chronic illness can feel overwhelming
and devastating. Maybe you’re feeling confused, sad, angry,
or frustrated at the prospects of facing certain challenges that
you’d rather live without.
Whatever feelings and emotions you’re experiencing, it helps to
know that you’re not alone. There are folks out there — both other
people with hepatitis C and professionals — who can help you.
And that’s the point of this chapter: to suggest some ways to deal
with difficult emotions and avoid isolation. So I describe some of
the common emotions many people with hepatitis C experience,
and then I help you find sources of support, including hep C sup-
port groups, mental health professionals, and hepatitis advocacy
groups.
But you can also take the task of clearing the gray clouds of nega-
tive thoughts, feelings, and emotions into your own hands. So in
addition to the self-help suggestions on nutrition, exercise, and
relaxation I cover in other chapters, here I describe the process
of changing your attitude to look on the bright side. Many people
believe that changing how you think can be the most powerful
medicine of all.

Handling Your Emotions
You may have mood swings as you live with hep C symptoms such
as brain fog or fatigue. Sometimes, you may have feelings of fear,
sadness, anger, or depression. Like the weather in London, you
may experience every emotion under the sun — including rain-
storms, hail, and rainbows — all in a single day! These challenging
emotions can come from several sources:
 A normal reaction to finding out you have a chronic illness
 The hepatitis C virus itself and its effects on your body (see
Chapter 4)
 Side effects of interferon plus ribavirin treatment (see
Chapter 8)
The feelings you get as an emotional reaction to finding out you
have hepatitis C may be similar to those of any loss, including
denial (no, this isn’t really happening), anger (who’s to blame for
this?), or depression (my life is over). You may also go through
stages of bargaining (if I stop smoking, my hep C will disappear)
or isolating (I don’t want to see anyone).
Like a rainbow that needs both sunshine and rain, ideally, you’ll
come to a place of some acceptance of the loss of your former
health and still see the brightness in your life.
Keep a record of your feelings. If you have information on the times
and days when your emotions go out of whack, that can help you
and your healthcare provider figure out a solution. For example,
you may find that depression goes hand in hand with fatigue for
you. You can then work on increasing your energy (through proper
diet and adequate exercise and rest), which in turn can help with
depression.
Managing anger
One of the common reactions to getting hepatitis C is anger. For
example, if you know how you got hepatitis C, you may be angry at
the medical system, your former drug partner, or a former lover.
You may be angry at yourself.
Anger is a normal response to loss, but inappropriate expression of
your anger by taking it out on loved ones or yourself can cause
more damage. Give safe expression to your anger and then move
on. Remaining angry is dangerous because doing so can keep you
from getting better. Don’t let your resentment poison you.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
190

So you’re angry and wondering what you can do about it. Here are
some ways to express your anger safely without hurting yourself
or anyone else:
 Talk it out. Tell loved ones, friends, and support group mem-
bers (see the section “Joining Support Groups,” later in the
chapter) about your feelings.
 Punch pillows. Make sure not to hurt yourself or others when
you do this.
 Try to cry. Be specific about why you’re crying and angry: “I
am so mad at myself for trying drugs. Now look what happened”
or “If I had had a decent doctor, maybe I wouldn’t have needed
that transfusion” or “I hate my ex-husband. I think that so-and-
so gave me this disease.”
 Write down your feelings. Use a journal to express yourself.
You also can use the journal to draw pictures that express
your emotions.
 Scream! Just make sure you’re alone in a car, out in the desert,
or somewhere where you won’t scare anyone. Any type of
vocalization — from moaning to chanting — can help.
If you find that your anger is escalating or that it doesn’t want to
stop, see a qualified mental health professional (see the section
“Talking with a Mental Health Professional,” later in this chapter).
Don’t take out your anger by hurting yourself or others!
Here are suggestions to help keep your anger at manageable levels:
 Exercise regularly (see Chapter 13).
 Practice relaxation (see Chapter 13).
 Take action. You can harness your energy to do something
positive for others (see the section “Taking Action and
Networking,” later in this chapter).
 Practice positive thinking (see the section “Staying Positive,”
later in this chapter).
 Connect with your spiritual side (see Chapter 13).
Dealing with depression
If you have hepatitis C, feeling blue or sad is a normal response.
Depression is a possible side effect of both hepatitis C and inter-
feron treatment. When these feelings won’t go away and interfere
Chapter 14: Surrounding Yourself with Support 191

with your ability to go about your day, you may be suffering from
depression. Here are some signs of depression:
 Persistent sadness
 Frequent crying
 Changes in eating or sleeping habits
 Isolating yourself from friends and family
 Loss of interest in activities you usually enjoy
 Difficulty concentrating
 Feelings of worthlessness
 Loss of interest in sex
 Thoughts of death or suicide
If you have any of these symptoms or other concerns about depres-
sion, especially if they linger for more than two to four weeks, speak
to your hepatitis C doctor, who can help you or refer you to a mental
health professional. If you decide to visit a mental health professional
before seeing your hepatitis C doctor, make sure to coordinate any
use of antidepressants with your hepatitis C doctor.
If you have serious thoughts of death or suicide, call your doctor
or 911 immediately.
The following self-help tips may help ease some of the signs of
your depression and help alone or in combination with profes-
sional counseling or antidepressants:
 Eat healthy foods (see Chapter 11).
 Exercise (see Chapter 13).
 Practice relaxation and proper breathing techniques (see
Chapter 13).
 Meditate and focus on your spirituality (see Chapter 13).
 Practice positive thinking (see the section “Staying Positive,”
later in this chapter).
 Connect with family and friends (see Chapters 15 and 19) and
hepatitis C support groups (see the next section, “Joining
Support Groups”).
Just like exercise helps with fatigue, connecting with others can lift
your spirits. Though you might feel like isolating yourself, meeting
and connecting with other people, including folks with hepatitis C,
may help your feelings of depression.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
192

If some of these tips sound similar to the ones I give to avoid anger,
that’s no coincidence. Depression and anger are sometimes seen
as two sides of the same coin, where depression is anger turned
inward.
Some folks on interferon treatment take medication to avoid the
well-known and dangerous side effect of depression, which, if
untreated, could lead to suicide or relapse of a drug or alcohol
addiction. If you’ve had previous problems with addiction or
depression, speak to your doctor before starting treatment. Get
your sources of support (medical folks, mental health contacts,
family, and friends) lined up before beginning treatment.
Joining Support Groups
Folks who regularly attend support groups say that they’re life-
savers. The group provides a constant support system through the
years of ups and downs associated with living with hepatitis C and
treatment. You can discuss your fears and your triumphs with
people who understand what you’re going through.
Because of the many folks with hepatitis C, support groups have
sprung up in many places. In the United States and Canada, more
than 350 groups of people with hepatitis C meet to provide mutual
support. You can find many more support groups if you count the
groups on the Internet.
What you get out of a support group depends on the particular
group, the people who attend, and the folks who run the group.
Some groups are led by healthcare professionals, such as nurses or
social workers; some are led by other people with hep C; and some
have medical guest speakers discuss particular topics. But gener-
ally, here’s what you can expect when you attend a support group:
 You’ll realize that you’re not alone.
 You’ll discover how others deal with hep C symptoms, along
with other medical, professional, and personal issues.
 You’ll get information about different hepatitis C treatments.
 You’ll make friends who can support you.
At support-group meetings, you’ll hear lots of information about
hep C from other people. Remember that each of you is different,
so discuss any new ideas with your physician before trying them
out. An expression popular in 12-step groups (see Chapter 12)
works well in this situation: “Take what you like and leave the rest.”
Chapter 14: Surrounding Yourself with Support 193

Face-to-face support groups
Support groups usually meet once or twice a month in hospitals,
libraries, or community centers. If a group meets in a hospital,
check ahead, but usually, all are welcome to join, whether or not
you have insurance or have a doctor at that hospital.
Some groups are specifically for hepatitis C, while others include
hepatitis B, other types of liver disease, or HIV–hepatitis C co-
infection. Some groups specialize in pre- and post-liver transplant
discussions. Each group has its own policy on whether family and
friends can join: Some groups have designated times when family
and friends can attend, but otherwise, the groups are closed to
non-hep C’ers.
Here are some ways to find a local group:
 Ask your hepatitis doctor.
 Call your local hospital or health department, both of which
maintain lists of support groups.
 Call one of the organizations that maintain lists of support
groups that I list in Chapter 22. 
If you don’t find a support group in your area, consider starting
one. Here are some issues to consider:
 Whom will the group be for? Only people with hep C? People
with other liver diseases? Friends and family of people with
hep C?
 When and where will you meet? Try to find a location that’s
easy to get to and available at a reasonable rate.
 What is the format? Will you have a facilitator or have guest
speakers?
Talk to your local hepatologist or gastroenterologist and other
healthcare professionals for help getting started. They can put you
in contact with other interested professionals and folks with hepa-
titis C. Also, contact the ALF and HepFI (see Chapter 22 for contact
information) for advice on starting a group and listing your group
on support-group referral lists.
The Veterans Affairs National Hepatitis C Program has a guide
called “Initiating and Maintaining a Hepatitis C Support Group: A
How-To Program Guide,” which you can find under the educational
resources on the program’s Web site (www.hepatitis.va.gov).
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
194

This hefty 48-page guide can help you start any type of support
group, though many suggestions are geared to veterans.
Support groups on the Internet
If you have access to the Internet, you may want to join one of the
many different support groups available. When using the Internet
for support, consider these pros:
 Greater anonymity — as long as you don’t use your real name
or give out personal information
 Exposure to many more people than you could find in person
(especially if you live in a small town)
 Easier access — you can write and read messages at any time
of day or night (if your computer is at home), and you don’t
have to wait for a monthly meeting
Don’t forget these cons about online groups:
 You won’t know anyone’s real name or identity. People can —
and do — make things up about themselves.
 The ease of expression on the Internet means that lots gets
said, some of which is valuable and true and some of which is
harmful and false.
To protect yourself, keep your personal information private and
beware any claims for products that are seemingly amazing. Most
things that seem too good to be true are just that.
Talking with a Mental
Health Professional
Sometimes, emotional or psychological problems become too
much to bear alone. You may be having trouble with the medical
system, your job, or your family. Talking things over with a qualified
mental health professional (such as a social worker, psychologist,
or psychiatrist) can steer you toward solutions, including medica-
tions, that work for you.
You may need help from a mental health professional in the following
situations:
 You’re trying to overcome an addiction to alcohol, drugs, or
another substance.
Chapter 14: Surrounding Yourself with Support 195

 You’re suffering from depression.
 You’re having trouble adjusting to your illness.
 You’re overwhelmed with feelings of anxiety.
Finding the right therapist or psychiatrist can take a little work.
Here are some tips for finding a trained counselor or other profes-
sional to help you:
 Ask your healthcare professionals for referrals.
 Ask other people in your hep C support group for 
recommendations.
 Call your state or local mental health association or associa-
tions for psychiatrists or psychologists.
Just as when dealing with any healthcare professional, you also
need to consider your health insurance and ability to pay.
Therapy can be short or long term, depending on your needs. Take
a moment to think through what’s really bothering you. Making a list
of the problems that you want to work through can help. Use this
list when you check out your potential therapists with a phone call
or initial visit to see whether you’re compatible. You may want to
ask whether the therapist has worked with people with hepatitis C.
If you have strong feelings about different types of treatment, bring
that topic up. See what kind of vibes you get from the therapist.
You need to feel comfortable with this person so you can trust him
or her with your personal feelings and problems.
Finding a mental health professional to help you may take some
work, but getting the personal support you need is worth the effort.
Taking Action and Networking
A great way to channel your energy and help others is to do some
hepatitis C advocacy work. You can network with other people
with hep C and at the same time take the following actions:
 Educate the public and professionals about hepatitis 
C transmission.
 Ask the government to provide additional funding for research.
 Advocate for more hepatitis C screening programs.
 Advocate for prevention and harm-reduction programs.
 Help the uninsured and working poor get treatment.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
196

See Chapter 22 for a starting point for agencies and organizations
that use volunteers. Many people with hepatitis C also use the
Internet for advocacy and networking. You can find a huge number
of Web sites devoted to hepatitis C, many of which are organized
by people with hepatitis C. If you have computer or writing skills,
you can help out with a site that’s up and running or create your
own site where you can spread your message.
Staying Positive
The body, mind, and emotions are interconnected. If you’re emo-
tionally off balance, that could be due to hep C’s effect on your
body and your thoughts. (I also discuss the mind-body connection
in Chapter 13 while discussing stress.) Because the power of your
thoughts is so strong, positive thinking can help you feel better.
A positive attitude lies behind positive thinking. You sometimes
have to “make believe” that you have a positive attitude until your
mind catches up on its own. Here’s how you’ll benefit from this
positive attitude:
 You’ll feel better emotionally, spiritually, and physically.
 You’ll be more pleasant to those around you, including family,
friends, co-workers, medical office employees, and even
supermarket cashiers. And they’ll be nicer to you in return!
Because the mind and body are connected, changing your attitude
to a positive one may help your immune system and liver (see
Chapter 13).
Like any habit, positive thinking can be learned. The goal is to sub-
stitute positive thoughts for negative thoughts. Making the change
can be challenging at first. Modern life supports negative thoughts.
Many newspapers and television shows give heavy coverage to
reports of crime, violence, hate, and war. Finding reports of com-
passion, healing, resolution, and love can be harder. But you can
do it. Here are some suggestions for changing your thinking:
 Look for the positive. When I’m feeling negative while I’m out
walking, I make myself count ten nice things around me. See
whether that idea works for you. You may not feel positive if
you’re dealing with hepatitis C problems, but try to find some-
thing positive anyway.
 Make a gratitude list. You can keep a separate notebook for
things you’re thankful for and write your list each night. Or
you can simply make mental notes of what you’re grateful for.
Chapter 14: Surrounding Yourself with Support 197

After you start your list, you’ll be amazed at all the things to
appreciate in your life.
 Pay attention to your thoughts. During meditation or quiet
times, you can “hear” the thoughts running through your head.
Do your thoughts make you feel good or bad? Noticing your
negative thoughts helps in the process of letting them go.
 Use positive affirmations. You may need to consciously think
positive thoughts at first to add them to your thinking reper-
toire. Some people write them down, meditate on them, or use
tapes of affirmations. To affirm is to say yes, and an affirma-
tion is a thought that says, “yes, it’s possible.” An affirmation
is a positive thought. So instead of letting negative comments
or thoughts, such as “Life stinks,” run through your mind or
come out of your mouth, try focusing on a positive affirmation,
such as “Each day is a precious gift.”
Affirmations are most useful when you either create your own
or pick the ones that resonate with you.
Try writing down your own negative thoughts. Then counter them
with positive alternatives. Here are some examples:
Negative Thought
Positive Alternative
I will always be sick.
My body is perfect and whole.
My liver is ruined.
My liver is healing.
This virus has got me beat.
I know my immune system is
clearing hep C from my body.
I’ll never work again.
I’m looking forward to finding
new ways to work.
I’ll die before I get a new liver.
A new liver is on its way to me.
Write your positive thoughts or affirmations in a way that’s com-
fortable for you. You can keep them in your hep C notebook, along
with all your test results and doctors’ notes, to remind you to look
on the bright side — no matter what. As one wise woman said to
me, “My attitude is all I can change, and that’s about 90 percent of
everything.”
Try focusing on the present. Thinking about the future can bring
worry and fear, which isn’t useful when it clouds the appreciation
of today. Make the choice to enjoy today, and know that you’ll deal
with the future when it comes. If you enjoy today, you’re more
likely to enjoy tomorrow.

 Getting prepared to tell others
 Discussing sex with your partner
 Telling your children
 Coping with the stigma
T
elling the people whom you care about and love that you have
hepatitis C can be trying and difficult at times, but you can do it,
and I’m here to help make the process easier. Telling others about
your health is important. You need their support to deal with your
illness and treatment. And they need to take measures to protect
themselves from getting infected. But you have the choice of whom
you want to tell and when, why, and how you want to tell them.
Your first step is to prepare yourself with information on transmis-
sion and disease progression (which I discuss in Chapters 2 and 4,
respectively) so that you can answer any questions that come up.
Then you need to decide whom to tell about your hep C. I don’t
want to sugarcoat this matter: Some people may react with fear or
discrimination. To minimize the possibility of encountering this
type of closed-minded attitude, make sure to think ahead before
telling people outside your closest family members.

In this chapter, I help you decide whom to tell, how to prepare for
the conversation, and when and how to do it. I also help you plan
for the most intimate of conversations — whether you’re married or
single, telling your sexual partner about your hep C is the responsi-
ble thing to do — and offer some tips for dealing with your sex life.
Finally, I spend time on communicating with your children about
your illness.
Deciding Whom to Tell
Whom you decide to tell about your hepatitis C is completely up to
you. The advantage of telling people is that you may get their sup-
port. The disadvantage is that you may have to deal with their
fears or discrimination toward you.
Take a bit of time to consider whom you wish to tell, including the
following:
 Your children
 Your parents
 Friends and other family
 People at work
Partners and household members
You might tell your partner or spouse first. She’s likely the person
that you feel closest to and most comfortable with, plus she’s likely
to be a primary source of support. But you’ll probably both be upset
at first until you have time to digest the news. Your loved one will
probably be concerned about you and about herself as she wonders
if she was infected, too. So give it time.
Consider that household members or sex partners will want to know.
They care about you and are potentially at risk if they have shared
a household item (a razor or toothbrush, for example) or have sex
with you. Read about how hepatitis C is transmitted in Chapter 2.
Any member of your household — spouse, partner, or child — may
eventually find out if you become ill with hep C or while you’re
undergoing treatment. So you may want to tell them at a time when
everyone is relatively calm and you’re not in a crisis of ill health.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
200

You have the choice of deciding when to tell everyone on a case-by-
case basis. You may want to wait until you’re feeling strong enough
to handle your loved ones’ reactions. On the other hand, don’t wait
too long, because you need their support and help.
If you want your personal information kept private, you can ask the
person to keep the information confidential. Ideally, your close
friends and family will respect your wishes. Asking children to
keep secrets is more difficult, however, and doing so may not be
the best thing for the child. When you tell people, you need to be
prepared for the fact that they may tell other people.
People at work
I don’t recommend that you tell anyone in the workplace until you
have carefully thought through the ramifications of how daily
workplace interactions and your future employment with the com-
pany will be affected. Consult your doctor, legal advisor, and family
members before deciding whom should know about your hepatitis
C, when to tell them, or even whether to tell them. 
You may wonder why you have to be so careful. The combination
of people’s prejudice against an infectious disease such as hepati-
tis C and your potential inability to perform your job could lead to
sticky social and legal issues. Some people at work may stigmatize
you and make your life miserable (see the section “Dealing with
Stigma,” later in this chapter).
Before you tell anyone on the job, discuss your situation with a
lawyer or disability office (state or federal). Unfortunately, the
Americans with Disabilities Act (www.ada.gov) has only a limited
ability to protect you against discrimination (see Chapter 16 for a
discussion of work and financial issues).
Folks exposed to your blood
You should consider telling two categories of people about your
hep C. In most cases, you are not legally obliged to tell the follow-
ing people, so it’s up to you:
 People with whom you shared injected drugs with in the
past: You may save their lives by letting them know that they
may be infected with hep C and should get tested. If they find
out early enough, they can get treated and prevent develop-
ment of end-stage liver disease or liver cancer.
Chapter 15: Working through Relationships and Telling Others 201

 People who are in contact with your blood now: These
people should always take proper precautions to protect
themselves, but you can let them know so they can be
absolutely careful:
• Dentists, nurses, and other healthcare workers
• Acupuncturists
• Tattoo artists or body piercers
• Sex partners (in some cases; see Chapter 2)
Preparing to Tell Others
After you decide whom you want to tell about your hepatitis C and
when, take the time to prepare for the conversation. Arm yourself
with information about the disease of hepatitis and how it spreads
by exposure to blood. And if you’re approaching someone who may
be particularly difficult to tell (your mother, for example), you may
want to bring along a supportive person (your spouse or sister, for
example).
Here are some steps that may make telling others about your con-
dition a little easier:
1. Prepare yourself emotionally.
Get emotional support for yourself so that you’re prepared
for the conversation. Hepatitis C support groups or mental
health professionals can help (see Chapter 14).
2. Get the facts about transmission and the disease and col-
lect information to share with the other person.
Speak to your doctor and get advice from her. Read
through this book and other information so you can answer
questions. And have something on hand (like this book or
shorter pamphlets, fact sheets, and so on) for the person
(such as an adult or older child) to read.
3. Practice what you’ll say beforehand, keeping in mind
that being clear and honest is the best approach.
I have the hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C is a bloodborne virus.
This step is especially helpful when you’re going to talk
with children or if you’re feeling a little shaky.
4. Be prepared for questions that people might ask, includ-
ing the following:
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
202

How did you get this virus? Here are some suggested
answers:
I once used a shared needle to try some drugs, a long
time ago.
I had a blood transfusion during an operation or after
my car accident.
I’m not sure. It could be from my tattoo or from being in
the army.
What will happen to you? Are you sick now? Consider
these possible responses:
I don’t have any symptoms, but my doctor found it
through a blood test. I have to keep up my testing. 
But I feel fine.
I’ve changed my diet, and I’m exercising every day so I
can stay healthy. I know I can beat this virus.
I’ve started treatment, and I’m not feeling too good
because of the side effects.
I didn’t know I had hepatitis C until I went to the hospital
and found out I have cirrhosis. I’m scared, but I know I
have a good doctor who’s helping me.
Did I catch it from you? Here’s what you can tell your friend:
You can get tested, if you want. But it’s not so easy to
catch unless you were exposed to my blood. The virus
is transmitted through blood.
Can I catch it from you? You can answer this way:
You can’t get hep C through kissing or eating from the
same plate or hugging.
You’ll be fine as long as you don’t use my toothbrush or
razor, because there might be some blood on it.
5. Be prepared to give the person time to process the 
information.
Your friend or relative may be confused or shocked after
hearing about your hep C. Reassure the person that you’re
taking care of yourself. You may want to call or visit the
person in a week or so to follow up.
After you tell trusted friends and family members about your illness,
they may ask you how they can help and support you. Think about
what help you might need now or in the future (see Chapter 19 for
ways friends and family can help), and keep their names and phone
numbers in your hep C notebook, which I discuss in more detail in
Chapter 5.
Chapter 15: Working through Relationships and Telling Others 203

Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
204
Talking about Sex and Dating
Hepatitis C is called a sexually transmitted disease because it can be
transmitted that way. However, it’s not usually transmitted through
sex. Here are the official recommendations about preventing the
spread of hep C through sex:
 If you’re in a monogamous, long-term heterosexual relation-
ship, you have a very low risk of spreading hepatitis C.
Discuss the matter with your partner and doctor.
 If you have multiple sex partners or sex that involves blood,
you’re at higher risk of spreading hep C that way. You’re
advised to practice safer sex, which I discuss in Chapter 2.
 If you are a man and have sex with other men, consider your
sex practices and their risks. Use a latex condom for anal sex
and take precautions against getting hepatitis A, which is
spread through contact with feces (see Chapter 2).
If you’re married or in a partnership
Have an open discussion with your sex partner about sexual trans-
mission of hepatitis C. The two of you can bring any concerns to
your healthcare provider. You can decide whether you wish to use
condoms or make any other changes in your sex life to reduce the
possibility of exposure to blood (see Chapter 2).
Your partner may wish to also get tested for hepatitis C, which can
allay fears about transmission. To discuss problems about lack of
interest in sex or performance issues, see “Dealing with sexual
problems,” later in this chapter.
When you’re single
Having a diagnosis of hepatitis C can feel scary, especially if you’re
single. You may feel that you’ll never have a partner or make love
again. But consider that in the United States alone, nearly 4 million
people have been infected with hep C, some of whom, like you, are
single. Other people with long-term illnesses manage to find love.
You’re more than your disease. You’re still the person you were
before hep C who needs to have relationships and a social life.
Even if you don’t have lots of energy or complete physical health,
you are still lovable. Keep your social life active with platonic and
romantic relationships. Here are some tips:

 Think positively and try to find a partner or friends (with or
without hepatitis C) worthy of you. If someone is fearful or
disrespectful of your hepatitis C, letting them go is probably
the best solution.
 Go to hepatitis C events and support groups to meet others
with hepatitis C.
 Consider looking into some dating lists on the Web that are
specifically for people with hepatitis C. Be careful, however,
not to divulge personal information on the Web, which I men-
tion in Chapter 14 in a discussion of online support groups
for hepatitis C. If you plan to meet someone in person whom
you’ve found through the Web, follow safety practices out-
lined in books such as Online Dating For Dummies, by Judith
Silverstein, MD, and Michael Lasky, JD (Wiley).
At some point, before you become sexually involved with a new
partner, you need to tell the person about your hepatitis C and
also discuss protection against other sexually transmitted diseases
(see the section “Preparing to Tell Others,” earlier in this chapter).
Dealing with sexual problems
You may have a lowered sexual desire (decreased libido) or 
difficulties performing sexually. For a man, this problem can be
impotence or ejaculation problems; a woman may have an inability
to achieve an orgasm. Sexual problems can arise from the effects
of hepatitis C virus or drug treatment on your mind and body. You
may have fatigue or depression, both of which decrease interest
in sex.
It’s important to talk to your partner about your concerns. You
deserve to have loving connections, even when you may not be
up to your normal sexual activities.
Examining some causes
Whether you’re straight or gay, married or single, young or old,
male or female, hep C can result in a loss of interest in sex, adding
to your stress. Here are some reasons your libido, or interest in
sex, may wane:
 Liver disease may affect male and female sex hormones
(which I discuss in Chapter 18).
 The symptoms of hep C, mainly fatigue but also feelings of
nausea or headaches, are definitely enough to put you out
of the mood.
Chapter 15: Working through Relationships and Telling Others 205

 Treatment with combination interferon therapy has another
set of side effects that lessen your desire for sex.
 Loss of interest in sex is a common side effect of depression,
which is common with hep C and interferon treatment (see
Chapter 14 for more on depression).
 Side effects of many antidepressants include loss of interest in
sex, inability to have an orgasm, and/or loss of erection.
 Worry about sexual transmission of hep C can dampen the
mood.
Because sexual problems can result from so many different rea-
sons, talk to your physician about specific help for your particular
situation. You may be able to change medications if that’s causing
the problem. Your doctor can prescribe a medication to help men
with erection problems. Hormone-based vaginal creams may help
women.
Talking with your partner
How do you discuss this topic with your loved one? Your partner
may take your disinterest as rejection, so let your spouse know
that the problem is not with him or your relationship but with your
health. Keep the lines of communication open and be honest.
1. State clearly how you feel:
I love you so much. I want to make love. I know it’s been a
while.
2. State your situation or problem:
I’m just too tired/anxious/sick. The medications have taken
away my physical desire.
3. State what you can do:
Can we cuddle? I’ll speak to the doctor about this. How about
on the weekend, when I have more energy?
State your situation truthfully but kindly and don’t make promises
you can’t keep.
Communicating with Children
Being prepared before telling your children is especially important.
If you have symptoms or side effects, your children will probably
know about it. Children usually are perceptive enough to realize
what’s going on in a household.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
206

Tell your children about the disease of hepatitis C. The older the
children are or the more children want to know about the disease,
the more you can tell them. Give them a brief summary of what they
can expect about your symptoms or energy levels. (In Chapter 17,
I cover the unique aspects facing children with hepatitis C. Check
it out for additional tips on how to explain hep C to kids.)
Tell your children that you’re doing everything you can to get well,
including taking naps, seeing the doctor, eating healthy food, and
taking medicines. Children need to be assured of the following:
 That you love them.
 That you plan to be around for a long time.
 That someone will always be available to take care of them,
if you can’t.
 That they did not give you the disease.
 That they can’t catch it. Here’s your opportunity to explain
how hepatitis C is caught (and that everyone will be sure to
use his or her own toothbrush and razor) and how it’s not
caught (through the air, by kissing, by eating together, and so
on). See Chapter 2 for more information on protecting others.
Your children may respond by offering to help, which is excellent
for you (especially if you tire easily) and them! Give them chores
that are appropriate for their age.
Dealing with Stigma
Some people in the general public, or even in your family or work-
place, aren’t educated about the nature of hep C (see the sidebar
“Hep C S.M.A.R.T.” in this chapter). As a result, they may view your
disease as a stigma — a mark of shame or disgrace associated with
the virus. People who consider hep C as a type of stigma may
 Treat you as contaminated or unclean because you have hep C,
which is an infectious disease.
 Assume that you’re a drug addict (and many people have 
negative views of drug addicts).
Because of the stigma sometimes attached to hep C, you may fear
that people will treat you differently, leave you, deny you health or
life insurance, or fire you from your job. You may even fear violence
if one of your family members or sex partners is worried that you
have infected them.
Chapter 15: Working through Relationships and Telling Others 207

If you’re informed about hepatitis C and have a support group —
including healthcare professionals, friends, family, and others with
hepatitis C — you’ll be much more likely to find ways to deal with
any discrimination or rejection that comes your way.

Hep C S.M.A.R.T.
The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) carried out a study with Harris
Interactive (of the famous Harris poll) to look at attitudes about hepatitis C. The survey
questioned people not infected with hep C, people infected with hep C, and physicians
(primary care physicians and specialists).
This study was part of an AGA program called “Be Hep C S.M.A.R.T (Shattering
Myths and Reinforcing Truths),” designed to educate both the public and health-
care providers about hep C transmission, diagnosis, and treatment. Here are some
study findings:
 Some general confusion exists in the general public about hep C transmission.
For example, 32 percent of uninfected people questioned thought that hep C
was transmitted by contaminated water or food. Forty-two percent didn’t know
that contact was through exposure to infected blood.
 Stigma is clearly a concern of people with hep C. Seventy-four percent of people
with hepatitis C believed the public thinks that the virus infects mainly drug
addicts and people with unhealthy lifestyles. Interestingly, only 30 percent of
the general public without hepatitis C believed this. Only 12 percent of the gen-
eral public believed that they couldn’t get a disease like hep C.

L
iving with a chronic illness like hepatitis C affects your
employment and financial life. Your costs of living may
increase at the same time that your earning potential decreases if
you have medical expenses and need to take some time off work
or work reduced hours. Either the symptoms of hepatitis C or the
side effects of medical treatment (or both) can make it difficult or
impossible to continue working.
When it comes to work and finances, think things through in
advance so that you’re prepared for the future. Get professional
advice from a lawyer, benefits advisor, or financial planner to help
you make decisions that can affect your future healthcare and the
finances of your family.
Keep all your records! Make copies of every letter or form you
send in regard to the financial and insurance-related aspects of
your healthcare, and keep every letter you receive. When you
have a phone conversation with someone about benefits or insur-
ance, keep notes of the conversation, including the date, time,
and name of the person you speak with. Being organized — or
even superorganized! — helps when you need to file a claim or
complaint.
In this chapter, I present information on work issues, health insur-
ance, financial planning, and applying for disability when you have
hepatitis C.

Working with Hepatitis C
For most people with hep C, the goal is to continue working as long
as possible. Working provides:
 Income and benefits (medical/dental/vision insurance, disabil-
ity insurance, life insurance, and a pension plan) for you and
your family
 A way to express your skills and talents
 A connection to the larger community
If your ability to work is impaired by hep C, this can affect your
financial status and your self-esteem. How hep C affects your work
life depends on what type of symptoms you have and how they
affect your ability to perform your job.
If you have no noticeable effects of the virus at this time, you don’t
have a reason to tell anyone at work about your hep C. You may
not develop symptoms that affect your ability to work for many
years. But now is a good time to collect all the information on your
health insurance and other benefits so that you have it if the need
arises.
Dealing with symptoms on the job
Hepatitis C can trigger debilitating symptoms (see Chapter 4), and
treatment with interferon (see Chapter 8) can add its own list of
side effects. You can have a range of symptoms that can affect your
ability to work.
Most people with hepatitis C don’t develop the most serious com-
plications but may suffer from symptoms such as fatigue or brain
fog that can challenge your ability to work well. See the self-help
tips to deal with fatigue later in this section and also check out
Chapter 13.
Keep a list of symptoms in your hep C notebook (which I explain in
detail in Chapter 5). A running diary of your symptoms helps you
find any patterns. If you need to apply for disability insurance (see
the section “Looking at Disability Benefits,” later in the chapter),
this information is essential.
When you observe your symptoms and note how they affect your
ability to work, you’ll find that your symptoms fall into one of
these categories:
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
210

 Short term or temporary: With short-term symptoms, you
may need to take a temporary leave of absence, reduce your
hours, or avoid certain procedures at your job (heavy lifting
for example) for a short period of time (less than a year) in
the following situations:
• You’re going through a brief rough patch.
• You’re on interferon treatment, and your symptoms will
get better when that’s over.
• You’re on an alternative treatment that will eventually
help your symptoms.
 Long term or permanent: Consider leaving your job and
applying for disability insurance when
• You’ve had difficult symptoms for years.
• Your disease has progressed or presented itself to you
as late-stage cirrhosis.
These categories aren’t hard and fast. Medical treatment or the
body’s own defenses can help a so-called long-term or permanent
condition improve. The major issue for most people when contem-
plating leaving work is how they’ll support themselves and their
families. The United States (and many other countries) offers
national support in the form of disability benefits for folks who are
unable to work because of chronic illness. I discuss short-term and
long-term disability benefits in the United States in the section
“Looking at Disability Benefits,” later in this chapter.
Fatigue is a symptom of both hep C and a side effect of interferon
treatment. (Chapter 13 has more about fatigue.) Needless to say,
experiencing fatigue can make the workday difficult. But healthy
eating and other lifestyle changes can help you maintain energy
at work:
 Eat small frequent healthy meals/snacks (see Chapter 11).
 Avoid sugary, fatty foods (see Chapter 11).
 Practice deep-breathing exercises (see Chapter 13).
 Get fresh air and go out into the sunlight to rejuvenate your-
self at work. Walk around the block.
Your healthcare practitioner can help you sort through your symp-
toms and help you decide when to make changes in your work life
or even if you should stop working and apply for disability. Your
doctor is an important ally because he can write letters attesting
to your medical condition for work or Social Security purposes.
Chapter 16: Facing Financial and Workplace Challenges 211

Telling your boss and
making changes
Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you’ll have to make some
changes at work. If your symptoms become severe enough to inter-
fere with your work, you may need to talk to your employer about
taking some time off or changing your hours. Put off telling your
employer about your illness until you’ve carefully considered
potential problems. Many workplaces have antidiscrimination poli-
cies, but you may run into problems in some workplaces and with
certain co-workers (if you also confide in them). If possible, get
professional advice (from an employment or disability expert).
When you’re ready to talk to your boss about hepatitis C, follow
these suggestions:
 Choose a time when you and your boss have some privacy.
 Bring this book or other materials to leave with your boss, if
she wants further information.
 Emphasize that you’re treating the disease and its side effects
and you’re not contagious or a danger to anyone.
If you experience discrimination on the job or you’re fired after dis-
cussing the issue with your employer, you may be able to get help
through the Americans with Disabilities Act, described in the sec-
tion “Getting your federal acts together,” later in this chapter.
Some folks need to change the type of work they do. Perhaps you’re
just too tired to continue your job that requires physical labor in the
hot sun. Or you’ve temporarily lost the ability to focus on your job.
You may be able to negotiate options to help you keep your job:
 Working part-time
 Changing some of your tasks
 Working from home
If you decide to work part-time, check first to make sure that you
don’t lose your health insurance and other benefits.
Researching Health Insurance
Directly paying doctor and hospital fees that range from thousands
to tens of thousands of dollars per year isn’t an option for most
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
212

people. Instead, you may have insurance through your job or your
spouse’s job, as a veteran (through the Veterans Administration),
as a senior citizen (through Medicare), or as a person with a low
income (through Medicaid). Or you may be one of the millions of
Americans without health insurance.
In addition to the resources listed throughout this chapter, HCV
Advocate has a large number of articles dealing with benefits,
insurance, and financial issues for people with hep C on its
Web site, www.hcvadvocate.org/hepatitis/living_w_
hepatitis_C.asp#2.
Another resource for information on hepatitis C and health insur-
ance is the Web site www.hepatitisneighborhood.com, which
has a section called “Financing Your Care” that links to useful 
articles. You must sign up (for free) to use the site, provided by
Priority Healthcare.
Getting a handle on the basics
In the United States today, health plans vary widely, although most
are a type of a managed care plan (such as a health maintenance
organization, or HMO). I give you some definitions of common
terms that give you a handle on the ins and outs of health insur-
ance. Use them to figure out what type of policy you have, what it
covers, and what it doesn’t.
What type of plan do you have?
The name of your plan can help you identify the benefits you have.
Read the small print to get the details of your particular plan.
 Fee for service (indemnity): In this more expensive type of
plan, you or the healthcare providers are reimbursed for the
amount paid. You can choose which physician to see and
when to see them. You usually have a yearly deductible and
frequently pay a percentage of the cost of each medical visit.
 Managed care: These types of health plans aim to control
rising costs of healthcare by limiting which doctors you can
visit and what types of treatments are covered.
 Health maintenance organization (HMO): In this form of pre-
paid health insurance, you pay a fixed premium (money paid
for the health insurance policy). The HMO pays certain doc-
tors to provide this healthcare, and the physicians are called
in-network.
Chapter 16: Facing Financial and Workplace Challenges 213

 Point of service (POS) plan and preferred provider organi-
zation (PPO): These plans fall in between a managed plan and
an indemnity plan. You can see doctors out of network, but
doing so will cost you more. Each insurer has its own defini-
tions for these policies and how much more you pay to see
out-of-network providers.
Your employer may also offer you a healthcare savings account
called MSA (medical savings account) or FSA (flexible spending
account).
How about government health plans?
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is an agency
within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Programs
for which CMS is responsible include Medicare, Medicaid, and State
Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Here’s some info on
those programs:
 Medicaid: The federal and state health insurance program for
Americans with low incomes. Every state has different rules,
and you may have a small co-payment for some services.
Contact your state office for more information. If you aren’t a
citizen of the United States but are a U.S. resident, you may be
eligible for benefits under certain circumstances. For more
information, see www.cms.hhs.gov/medicaid.
 Medicare: The federal health insurance program for people
aged 65 or older, people who have permanent kidney failure,
and some people under age 65 with disabilities. Coverage
includes the following:
• Hospital insurance: Provides for treatment while at a
hospital or while receiving some types of home or hos-
pice care. This part of Medicare (Part A) is available to
all persons age 65 or over as part of Social Security.
• Medical insurance: Covers physician and other outpa-
tient services. You may pay a premium for this elective
coverage (known as Part B).
To contact Medicare, visit the Web site www.medicare.gov or
call 800-MEDICARE (800-633-4227).
 SCHIP: This program helps uninsured children from low-income
families who don’t qualify for Medicaid.
For more information on any of these programs, visit
www.cms.hhs.gov.

214

Who’s in charge?
You may see more than one type of doctor if you have hep C. A pri-
mary care physician (PCP) is your healthcare gatekeeper and refers
you to specialists, such as gastroenterologists, or for specific tests.
(See Chapter 5 to read more about PCPs and specialists who treat
hepatitis C.) Generally, a managed care plan requires that your PCP
refer you to a specialist. In a fee-for-service plan, you don’t need a
referral, and you can decide whom you wish to visit.
What are your out-of-pocket costs?
As a patient, you usually pay some of your healthcare costs. A pre-
mium is the regular amount (usually monthly) you pay toward your
healthcare insurance; that amount usually comes directly out of
your paycheck.
Co-insurance or co-pay is an additional amount of money that you
pay for certain services. For example, in an 80/20 split, the insur-
ance company pays 80 percent of the cost, and you pay 20 percent
of the cost. Another example is the $15 co-pay you may be charged
at each office visit.
A deductible is the amount you must pay, each calendar year or
other period, toward approved medical care before your insurance
company will start to pay your medical bills.
What’s covered and what’s not?
You need to know what things your particular health plan will pay
for because plans vary widely. An HMO has a list of doctors and test
facilities it has negotiated to work with. These doctors and facili-
ties are in-network providers. If you go to an out-of-network doctor
or facility that’s not on the approved list, you may pay extra.
Exclusions are health conditions or procedures not covered by your
policy. Frequently, pregnancy and childbirth are in this category.
Precertification means that certain procedures, doctor or hospital
visits, and medications may need prior approval from your insur-
ance company; otherwise, insurance won’t cover them. If you don’t
get precertification and insurance is denied, you may have to pay
out of pocket and then pursue reimbursement with your company.
Preventive care or preventive medicine, also called a check-up or
routine physical, refers to tests and office visits that look for illness
before you have any symptoms or complaints. Preventive care
includes things like blood tests, mammograms, prostate exams,
and EKGs (electrocardiograms). Managed care plans are more
likely to cover these costs than indemnity plans.
Chapter 16: Facing Financial and Workplace Challenges 215

Filling up on prescription facts
You may be taking combination peginterferon plus ribavirin med-
ication (see Chapter 8) or taking other drugs as prescribed by your
doctor. These prescription drugs can be very costly and may or
not be included or excluded from your health plan. Prescription
drugs fall into one of these categories:
 Brand name: When drugs are first marketed, they’re sold by
the company that has a patent to be the sole producer of the
drug for a period of time.
 Generic: After the patent expires, drugs may be produced by
other companies for a lower cost. Your doctor and/or insur-
ance company may not allow or approve of generic drugs.
When you begin any new drug (or change health insurance poli-
cies) check to make sure that your drugs will be covered.
Making a complaint
You are your best advocate when making sure that you get the best
healthcare possible. If you want to visit a certain specialist, take a
certain medication, or have a certain procedure that isn’t covered
by your health plan, take action:
 Speak to your doctor to see if she’ll write a letter for you.
 Call your insurance company and ask about the procedure for
lodging a complaint.
 Write to your insurance company and make a case for what
you want. For example, explain that no other liver specialist
is on your health plan within a 50-mile radius.
Keep copies of all correspondence from your insurance company,
document any telephone calls, and print out all e-mails. Follow up
your case and don’t be surprised if you get what you need!
Living without health insurance
in the United States
A snapshot picture by the U.S. Census Bureau of health insurance
coverage in the United States in 2003 reveals that 84.4 percent of
Americans have health insurance and 15.6 percent — or 45 million
people — do not. What can you do if you are uninsured and need
healthcare? Here are some suggestions:
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
216

 See whether you can receive care from local or state agencies,
such as the Medicaid program (see the “How about govern-
ment health plans?” section, earlier in the chapter).
 The drug companies that make treatments for hepatitis C
offer compensation for people without health insurance. I
include the companies’ telephone numbers in Chapter 22.
 Some clinics offer testing for hepatitis C (Chapter 6) and
advice for further treatment.
 If you need a liver transplant and don’t have health insurance,
you may qualify for help (see Chapter 9).
 Agencies that offer assistance to people with hepatitis may be
able to direct you to more info and help (see Chapter 22).
Chapter 16: Facing Financial and Workplace Challenges 217
Getting compensation for hepatitis C
In some cases, the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom (UK) are pro-
viding financial compensation for individuals (and families) who were infected by
hepatitis C as a result of a transfusion blood product.
In Canada, a class-action suit is being filed for people infected through contami-
nated blood between January 1, 1986, and July 1, 1990. You can get information by
contacting Administrator of the Hepatitis C Claims Centre, P.O. Box 2370, Station D,
Ottawa, Ontario, K1P 5W5; phone 877-434-0944; Web site www.hepc8690.com.
If you were infected before January 1, 1986, and after July 1, 1990, or you want links
to province-specific compensation, check out the compensation section of the Web
site of the Hepatitis C Society of Canada, www.hepatitiscsociety.com/
english/HepCCompensation.htm.
In the UK, the government pays if you received blood or blood products from the
National Health Service (NHS) before 1991, when screening was started. This plan
is called ex-gratia, which means that the government will pay you but not admit lia-
bility. The payment is _20,000 pounds if you have hepatitis C and a further 25,000
pounds if your disease is more advanced (you have cirrhosis, liver cancer, or liver
transplant). This fund became active in July 2004.
For more information, contact the Skipton Fund, P.O. Box 50107, London, SW1H 0YF,
UK; phone 020-7233-0057; e-mail apply@skiptonfund.org, Web site
www.skiptonfund.org.
Although no amount of money truly compensates for the loss of health, well-being,
or life, I applaud the fact that some health services are acknowledging their role in
the transmission of the hepatitis C virus. Acknowledgment must also go to the hard
work of some people with hepatitis C and their lawyers and friends who fought to
bring about compensation benefits.

Nationalized health insurance
Health insurance in countries with national health plans (such as
the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia) generally provides
healthcare for all residents, regardless of the ability to pay. At the
same time, the system allows for private payment or private insur-
ance that results in a somewhat two-tiered system: those on the
national plan and those who also have a private plan. One advan-
tage of a nationalized plan, in addition to not having to pay for most
services, is that the paperwork load for the patient is vastly reduced.
Whatever the advantages and disadvantages of healthcare systems
between or within different countries, it pays to find out as much
as you can about your healthcare insurance.
Looking at Disability Benefits
For some folks, a time comes when they can’t work like they used
to. The onset of serious symptoms that lead to an inability to work
(disability) may come a long time after the initial diagnosis with
hepatitis C. You may have short-term or long-term symptoms,
which translate into a short-term or long-term disability.
Defining types of benefits
If you become unable to work, you may need financial assistance.
You may qualify for employer and state benefits, and it’s up to you
to find out what benefits you can apply for. Speak to your human
resources/benefits office (if you have one) or your employer, do
some research in your local library, or use the telephone book to
find information for your state offices. (I list the contact details for
Social Security in the “Applying for government disability insur-
ance” section later in the chapter.) The type of benefit you need
depends on how long you’ll need assistance.
Short-term disability (STD)
This period can last up to one year. Depending on how long you’re
ill and your particular benefits at your job, you may be able to use
your sick leave for a short-term illness. Other benefits to look into
include employer or state benefits or the Family and Medical Leave
Act (see the section of the same name later in the chapter).
Long-term disability (LTD)
This coverage takes over after short-term disability. At this point,
you can also apply for state disability and Social Security disability
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
218

(see the “Applying for government disability insurance” section,
later in the chapter).
If you’re on long-term disability, you must reapply for benefits at
regular intervals to prove that you remain unable to work. Long-
term disability lasts until you qualify for Medicare, at retirement
age, or 24 months after you’ve been on Social Security disability.
Getting your federal acts together
To prevent discrimination and also to protect workers who have
medical needs, two federal laws were enacted in the United States.
Americans with Disabilities Act
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects you against
discrimination on the job, but it applies only if your employer
knows that you have hepatitis C. If you haven’t told your employer
about your hepatitis C, you can’t make a complaint about discrimi-
nation due to your hepatitis C.
Generally, this law covers employers with more than 15 employees.
The ADA defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that
substantially limits at least one major life activity. People who are
discriminated against because of their known association with a
person with a disability are also protected by the ADA. The ADA
covers other types of discrimination, ranging from transportation
to education to healthcare. To find out more about this act, visit
the ADA Web site at www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada or call 800-514-0301.
Family and Medical Leave Act
According to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), eligible
employees of certain firms or organizations (with more than 50
employees) are entitled to a 12-week unpaid leave every 12 months
for valid medical or family reasons. Serious medical conditions or
treatments are covered under the FMLA. While you are on FMLA,
your health benefits are retained, and generally, your job will be
held for you. Read more at www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fmla or call
866-4-USA-DOL (866-487-2365).
Applying for government
disability insurance
If you’re unable to work due to your hepatitis C, you may be eligi-
ble for United States government disability benefits (SSDI and SSI),
Chapter 16: Facing Financial and Workplace Challenges 219

administered by the Social Security Administration. Your disability
must be long term; Social Security does not give short-term insur-
ance. The two government benefits you can apply for are the 
following:
 Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI): You may qualify if
you’ve paid into this insurance through your prior employment.
 Supplemental Security Income (SSI): This benefit is based on
financial need.
Part III: Living a Good Life with Hep C 
220
Getting a head start on the 
disability application
Here’s a place to start the information-gathering and -organizing process when
applying for Social Security disability insurance. This information comes from the
“Medical and Job Worksheet - Adult” from the Disability Starter Kit that is used to
prepare for an interview or to complete the Disability Report. Here is some of the info
you’ll need to provide:
 The date (month, date, and year) you became unable to work.
 The medical condition(s) that keep you from working.
 Each healthcare practitioner who has treated your condition. For each one,
gather the healthcare practitioner’s name, address, and phone number; your
patient ID number with that practitioner; and the dates (month and year) of your
visit(s).
 Visits to hospitals or clinics. Include the name, address, phone number, and hos-
pital/clinic number (see your paperwork or call the hospital) and the date (month
and year) of each visit.
 Your medications. Include the name of the medication, why you take it, and the
name of the doctor who prescribed it.
 All medical tests you have taken or are scheduled to take. Include the name of
the test, the location of the test, the name of the doctor who ordered the test,
and the date of the test.
 Your medical assistance number. If you’re already receiving state Medicaid ben-
efits, check your card for that number.
 Your jobs for the past 15 years. Include your job titles, the types of businesses
where you worked, and the dates worked (month and year).
To get more information, go to the Web site www.socialsecurity.gov/
disability/ and click on the Disability Starter Kits link; call 800-772-1213; or go
to your local Social Security office.

Social Security determines whether you fit its definition of disabled
by asking a series of questions. You must demonstrate that your ill-
ness is severe enough to keep you from working at your previous
job or any other job. You must also not make more than a specified
amount, which at the time of this writing is $810 per year.
You can apply for disability benefits by going online at www.
ssa.gov, visiting your local Social Security office (check your
phone book for the location), or calling 800-772-1213.
Going through the application process, which involves many people
and many forms, can take several months. Take a few deep breaths
to stay calm, especially if you’re waiting on the telephone or in line.
Here’s where your organization of your medical records will pay off.
(And now you know why I harp throughout this book about the need
to keep a hep C notebook, which I explain in Chapter 5.) See the
sidebar “Getting a head start on the disability application” so you
can gather the information you need for your application. Good luck!
Saving for Yourself and
Your Family
The knowledge that you have a long-term illness can make you
think about the financial future for yourself and your loved ones.
Planning ahead is smart, and especially so when you have hepatitis
C. If you can, do it while you’re still working and feeling well. Later,
you may be on treatment or have more severe hepatitis C, and
you’ll be mighty glad that your finances are in order.
Getting life insurance
Life insurance is a set of payments you make now to provide a
fund for your family after you die. You may be offered life insur-
ance through your job, or you may wish to purchase a policy on
your own.
How much, if any, trouble you have getting a new life insurance
policy depends on the features of your hepatitis C illness and the
insurance company you’re dealing with. Most life insurance com-
panies look at your health to determine eligibility. Insurers want
to know whether your disease is under control or whether your
health is declining. Tell them if you’ve been successful with inter-
feron treatment or if you have only mild symptoms that haven’t
gotten worse.
Chapter 16: Facing Financial and Workplace Challenges 221

If you do have cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer, life insurance
companies are unlikely to offer you a traditional policy. Here’s
what you can do:
 Look around at different companies; policies may differ.
 Consider saving money in other ways.
 Investigate insurance policies through your employer or 
associations that are “guaranteed” and that don’t ask health
questions.
Planning for the inevitable
Getting old and dying are inevitable, with or without hepatitis C.
With hepatitis C, what you don’t know is how your hepatitis C will
affect your ability to work and whether it will develop into a seri-
ous illness and premature death. You’ll feel better if you know that
you have taken care of the loose ends of your estate and finances,
so consider this advice:
 Make sure you’ll have the savings you might need later on,
when you may not be able to work.
 Make sure that you’ve done all you can to provide for your
children and their educational needs.
Take a look at Estate Planning For Dummies, by N. Brian Caverly
and Jordan S. Simon (Wiley), for info on net worth, wills, trust
funds, and more. Also consult a qualified financial planner or
lawyer for advice on your personal situation.

good medical care is important so that you stay on top of your
child’s health and find out about the latest medical treatments.
Mothers with the hepatitis C virus pass the infection to their baby in
about 5 percent of births, and having two people in the family with
the disease can be doubly hard. However, eating well (Chapter 11),
avoiding toxins (Chapter 12), and reducing stress (Chapter 13) are
important ways that help both children and adults with hepatitis C
continue to enjoy a healthy life.
In this chapter, I describe what’s known about hepatitis C in children
and give you information and suggestions so you can help your child
and your family.
Looking at Hep C in Children
Experts estimate that between 100,000 and 150,000 children in the
United States are currently infected with hepatitis C virus. Around
the world, approximately 10,000 cases of mother-to-child transmis-
sion occur each year.

Children respond somewhat differently to hepatitis C infection
than adults, and some differences depend on the child’s age. In
most cases, disease progression is milder in children: More chil-
dren get rid of the virus on their own without medication, and 
children are less likely to have symptoms and problems.
Unfortunately, chronic hepatitis C can cause disease at any time,
and the chances of this happening increase as your child ages. By
carefully monitoring your children, your doctor can spot the dis-
ease when it comes out of hiding and starts to cause damage. At
that time, your doctor may recommend starting antiviral treatment
to halt the disease progression (see the “Deciding on Treatment”
section, later in the chapter).
Overall, the disease progression in children is similar to that in
adults: liver inflammation followed by fibrosis (scarring), which if
unstopped could become cirrhosis. Liver cancer is also possible in
children.
Infants, who are defined as children less than 1 year, can develop
cirrhosis and need a liver transplant to survive, but that happens
only rarely.
So the prognosis for children with hepatitis C is generally better
than that for adults. Some treatments are approved for use in 
children (see the section “Deciding on Treatment,” later in this
chapter), and medical studies are looking at the long-term safety
and effectiveness of hepatitis C treatment for children. Treatments
available in the future should be even more promising for children.
Defining risk factors in children
Children have the same risk factors for hep C virus transmission as
adults, with the additional possibility of acquiring the hep C virus
during birth. Here are the ways a child might get the hepatitis C
virus:
 Transmission from mother to child: This is now the most
likely cause of hepatitis C infection in children. See the sec-
tion “Transmitting Hepatitis C from Mother to Child,” later in
the chapter.
 Exposure to blood transfusion or organ transplant before
1992: Because the blood supply is now tested for hep C, the
chances of getting infected from a transfusion are 1 per 1 mil-
lion units of blood. If your child had a transfusion before 1992,
there is a chance that he or she got hep C from that exposure.
Organs are also now tested for hepatitis C.
Part IV: Considering Different Groups with Hepatitis C 
226

 Transfusion of clotting factors before 1987: If a child with
hemophilia or another clotting factor deficiency received clot-
ting factor (from pooled blood) with hepatitis C virus before
1987, he may have gotten the hepatitis C virus. Clotting fac-
tors are now protected against hepatitis C virus and other
viruses, like HIV and hepatitis B.
 Member of a household with hepatitis C: This is probably
the least likely route of exposure for a child to get hepatitis C,
but this method of transmission is theoretically possible if a
child used a razor or toothbrush that had infected blood.
Inform your pediatrician if your child has any risk factors for hepa-
titis C. Testing children or adolescents who have risk factors allows
earlier treatment and management of hepatitis C.
For older children, the paths to hepatitis C transmission can
resemble those of adults even more closely. Check out all the
transmission info in Chapter 2, but keep these means in mind for
older children:
 Injection drug use
 Sexual activity with exposure to blood
 Sharing of paper currency or straws for intranasal cocaine use
 Tattoos or piercings in unsanitary situations
Examining symptoms in children
Symptoms in children are similar to those in adults, but the tricky
part is that younger children are less able to define their symp-
toms, and they may have fewer symptoms. Watch for the following:
 Flu-like symptoms (achiness, fever, diarrhea, or nausea)
 Tiredness
 Loss of appetite or weight loss
 Dark-colored urine
 Light-colored feces
 Stomach pain, especially in the upper-right abdominal area
 Jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin)
Infants under 1 also may have an enlarged liver or spleen, grow
more slowly, or fail to gain weight.
Chapter 17: Helping Kids with Hepatitis C 227

Children may have no symptoms, but hep C can eventually lead to
a life-threatening illness, including cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver
cancer. If your child has any of the symptoms of hepatitis C — or
any of the risk factors outlined earlier — contact your pediatrician.
Remember that earlier testing leads to earlier treatment and more
effective disease management.
Transmitting Hepatitis C
from Mother to Child
About 5 out of every 100 babies (5 percent) born to a mother with
hep C RNA (see Chapter 6) in her blood will get the virus. Because
this number is relatively small, women with hepatitis C aren’t
specifically counseled to avoid pregnancy. Whether or not to
become pregnant is an individual decision for each couple to
make.
Here’s some information culled from research studies about
mother-to-child transmission of hep C:
 A factor that’s related to transmission of hep C to your chil-
dren is your viral load. If you have more virus in your blood,
as measured by hep C RNA tests (see Chapter 6), you’re more
likely to transmit the virus.
 Infection with hepatitis C virus happens at the time of birth.
To reduce the chance of being exposed to the mother’s blood
at birth, some experts recommend an elective Caesarean sec-
tion. Either a vaginal birth or emergency Caesarean section
can bring the baby in contact with the mother’s blood.
Researchers are looking at the pros and cons of this choice.
Discuss your options for birth with your partner, gynecolo-
gist, and liver specialist.
 Other procedures during pregnancy or birth that might
expose the baby to mom’s blood should be avoided or 
practiced with caution:
• Amniocentesis: This test uses a needle to access the
amniotic fluid (the clear fluid that surrounds the fetus)
during pregnancy to look for birth defects.
• Fetal scalp monitoring: This method of checking on the
baby’s heart rate with scalp electrodes could put tiny cuts
in the infant’s head through which hep C virus could pass.
 The hepatitis C virus has been found in breast milk, but there’s
no evidence for transmission through breastfeeding. Medical
experts recommend that women with hepatitis C breastfeed
Part IV: Considering Different Groups with Hepatitis C 
228

their babies because of the benefits of breastfeeding for the
child. If you have cracked or bleeding nipples, however, you
should refrain from breastfeeding.
 If you have co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), studies show that your chance of passing your hep C to
your children is 17 percent (versus 5 percent with hepatitis C
alone).
Testing Children
Needles, blood work, and biopsies are particularly difficult for chil-
dren and families. Infants, toddlers, and even older children won’t
initially understand why they have to be subjected to such scary and
uncomfortable events. But kids can get used to the procedures —
and you can take steps to help increase their comfort level.
You may want to plan some treat for your child before or after
the testing. For example, you could make a special meal for your
child (but go easy on the junk food, which isn’t so good for the
liver!). Even better, let your kid get involved with the pre- and post-
procedure planning:
 Let your infant/toddler hold a special stuffed animal, doll,
or blanket: This connection to a familiar object gives the child
some comfort and feeling of control during the injection
process.
 Let your child pick out something special to wear: A special
shirt, ribbon, bracelet, and so on may help. Maybe your child
simply wants to wear a special color that she feels good about.
 Let your child pick a special CD or videotape: Listening to a
favorite singer or watching a favorite movie may help take the
child’s mind off the procedure.
Check out the section “Explaining hepatitis C to children,” later
in the chapter, for more tips on helping kids through the testing
process. But you also need to feel comfortable to help ease the
anxiety in the family when you’re facing tests and procedures. And
the first step to being more comfortable is getting the facts.
Hep C virus tests
The two basic blood tests for hep C virus look for antibody or RNA.
I cover general information about hep C virus tests in Chapter 6,
but the following section explains the specifics related to kids.
Chapter 17: Helping Kids with Hepatitis C 229

Anti-hepatitis C antibody
If your child is older than 18 months old, the anti-hepatitis C anti-
body test is an accurate way to test for exposure to the hepatitis C
virus. But your baby’s positive anti-hepatitis C antibody test can
be a false positive if the test is performed before your child is
18 months old. The reason is that mothers pass their own antibod-
ies on to their children, where they can linger for up to 18 months.
If the mother has hepatitis C antibodies, these are present in her
young children. This is nature’s way of protecting children until
they produce their own antibodies.
Unfortunately, the antibodies that are detected by the anti-hepatitis
C test aren’t the ones that protect against infection.
Even if the mother or child’s virus has all but disappeared, due to
treatment or luck, antibodies may still be present in the blood.
Antibodies against hepatitis C are still produced after the virus
infection has been eradicated.
To see whether you still have the virus, you need to have an
RNA test.
Hep C RNA tests
An RNA test is used to look for the presence of the hepatitis C
virus. Both types of RNA test, qualitative or quantitative, look to
see whether your child has an active hepatitis C infection. Your
child will be tested for hep C RNA as follows:
 Infants born to mothers positive for hepatitis C can be tested
at 2 months and then again at 5 or 6 months. (Antibody tests
aren’t reliable at this early age due to the presence of mater-
nal antibodies.)
 Toddlers and older children are tested for hep C RNA if their
antibody tests are positive.
Yearly, or more often if your child has symptoms, your pediatrician
will repeat an RNA test, along with liver enzyme/function tests, as
described in the next section. This regular testing enables the
doctor to keep on top of your child’s illness. The RNA test tells the
doctor if your kid has eradicated his virus.
At some point, your child may have the anti-hepatitis C antibody,
but the RNA test shows no virus. This result means that your child
has naturally eradicated his hepatitis C infection!
Your kid’s doctor may perform viral load tests (quantitative RNA
tests) to determine the amount of virus your child has. Note though
Part IV: Considering Different Groups with Hepatitis C 
230

that viral load doesn’t always correlate with how serious the dis-
ease will be; it’s a measure of how much virus your child has.
Liver tests in children
The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) liver enzyme tests (discussed in Chapter 7) are recommended
for children, although the normal levels aren’t as clearly defined as
for adults, and results may vary at times.
Children who have any liver damage (indicated by elevated levels of
ALT or AST) need to see a pediatric gastroenterologist or hepatolo-
gist, who is experienced in treating liver disorders. (See Chapter 5
for more about finding and communicating with a doctor.)
If your child has elevated ALT levels, your doctor may want to per-
form a biopsy. If your child needs a liver biopsy, try to explain the
procedure in simple terms — if your child is old enough. Here are
some things your child can expect:
 No eating or drinking after midnight the night before the biopsy
 Getting blood drawn on the morning of the biopsy
 Being sedated for the procedure (see Chapter 7 for a descrip-
tion of the liver biopsy procedure in adults)
 Getting checked after the biopsy to make sure everything
is okay
Also let your child know that he can eat after he wakes up and that
he may have to stay overnight in the hospital.
In addition to liver enzyme tests and biopsies, your doctor may
also perform these tests, covered in Chapter 7:
 Alpha-fetoprotein test: Some doctors use this test to monitor
the progression of liver disease in children.
 Ultrasound test: Your doctor may also perform this test to
obtain a baseline to use if your child ever develops liver dis-
ease down the road.
Deciding on Treatment
Decisions to treat children aren’t as clear-cut as they are for adults.
For one thing, most medications haven’t been tested in children,
Chapter 17: Helping Kids with Hepatitis C 231

so their safety and effectiveness isn’t well established. Another
factor is that the course of hepatitis C disease in children is slower
and milder, so the impetus to treat earlier rather than later isn’t as
great for children as it is for adults. Some doctors don’t treat chil-
dren until they turn 18. Other doctors treat at an earlier age, but
this is usually decided on a case-by-case basis. For young people
with hepatitis C, there’s room for optimism, because new products
with potentially greater safety and effectiveness are in the develop-
ment pipeline.
The only treatment currently approved by the FDA for use in chil-
dren is Schering-Plough’s Intron A (interferon alpha-2b), which I
discuss in Chapter 8, and ribavirin (Rebetol). Intron A, like the
other interferons, is administered through injection. Intron A isn’t
a pegylated form of interferon and must be injected more often
(three times a week). Ribavirin is taken by adults in pill form, and a
bubble-gum-flavored liquid ribavirin (Rebetol) is now available for
children.
Giving a child an injection, or going to get a blood draw can
be challenging! Parents of Kids with Infectious Diseases (PKIDs)
offers tips on its Web site (www.pkids.org) to help you and your
child deal with the injection process. Here are a few of those 
suggestions:
 Speak to your doctor about using EMLA Cream to reduce pain
at the injection site.
 Keep your child away from the injection materials and injec-
tion room until time for the injection, so he’s not worrying
about the upcoming shot all day.
 Pick a sanitary and quiet place in the home to do injections.
The kitchen and bathroom probably aren’t the best places.
You can also try to distract your kid by talking about something
else, letting her watch TV, or asking her to wiggle her toes.
If you want to treat your child with complementary or alternative
medicine (CAM), find a healthcare practitioner who’s knowledge-
able about liver disease and children. And tell your pediatrician or
pediatric gastroenterologist about any herbs or other treatments
that your child is taking.
Don’t be tempted to treat your child yourself with any product,
especially one that is intended for adults. Children react differently
and to lower doses of herbs than adults.

Experiencing Childhood
with Hepatitis C
From a medical standpoint, hepatitis C shouldn’t affect your child’s
ability to participate in usual childhood activities, including sports
activities.
Explaining hepatitis C to children
You’re likely reading this book right now to find out more about
hepatitis C and, therefore, to become more comfortable and confi-
dent in dealing with the illness. Children (especially older children)
can also benefit from information. Talk with your doctors and
nurses about how you and they can best explain the disease and
procedures to children.
Here are some typical questions your child might ask, along with
simplified ways of explaining hep C and testing procedures to
young children. Modify them for your own use.
 What is a liver?
Inside the body, here under your right rib, is a liver. (You can
poke gently in the general area of your child’s body to explain
where it is. You also may want to go to the supermarket and
show your child a beef or chicken liver.) Your liver helps you
digest food and get rid of bad chemicals.
 What is a virus?
A virus is a tiny infection (germ) that can make you sick.
 What is the hepatitis C virus?
The hepatitis C virus is a tiny germ that infects your liver.
 What is hepatitis C disease?
When the hepatitis C virus stays in your body, you can get sick.
Your liver may not work so well.
 What is a blood test?
The doctor needs to see a little bit of your blood to see if you
have the virus or are getting sick.
 Why do you use needles?
The needle goes into your vein (very quickly) to get a little blood.
Chapter 17: Helping Kids with Hepatitis C 233

 What is a liver biopsy?
The doctor is going to take a really small piece of your liver to
look at under the microscope. She can look at your liver and
then give you medicine if you need it to get better.
Protecting the household
Household infection is uncommon, but you still need to take pre-
cautions to avoid exposing others to any danger. But don’t become
overly paranoid, because this type of fear can spread to your child
and others. Protection from hep C in the household is just a matter
of common sense: Avoid exposure to blood. Because blood is nor-
mally inside our bodies, protecting yourself is relatively easy.
When someone in your household has hepatitis C, whether it is
only one child or a parent and a child, teach your family not to
share household items, including the following:
 Shaving razors
 Manicure items (such as nail clippers or cuticle scissors)
 Toothbrushes and toothpaste
Encourage everyone in your household to separate their personal
items from other people’s things by using small bags or plastic
boxes with children’s names or buying different colors or brands
of items to make it easy to keep them apart. If all family members
keep their toothpaste and toothbrushes separate from the others,
then the children or adults with hepatitis C don’t feel singled out.
When your child is old enough, he’ll be able to understand that he
must keep his cuts covered up. Try to keep bandages nearby to
cover any cuts or wounds. Any objects soiled with blood should be
carefully disposed of and not left around to infect others. Try to
give your kids this advice in a way that emphasizes hygiene for the
whole family, and not with shame or paranoia. Here are some other
tips on keeping things safe at home:
 If you have children sleeping over, have extra toothbrushing
supplies on hand so that no one needs to share.
 Teach your children about razors and safe disposal of sanitary
items before puberty sets in and your children have already
started shaving or menstruating.
 Just as your child must be aware of the need to keep his cuts
covered up, other children in the household also need to
know of this potential risk so they don’t inadvertently expose
themselves to blood.
Part IV: Considering Different Groups with Hepatitis C 
234

 Use latex gloves to clean up any wounds or accidents involving
blood from a person with hep C. Some people use this precau-
tion with any exposure to blood.
Telling other people your
child has hep C
The question of whom to tell about your child’s hep C and how to
do it isn’t easy. Talk to your spouse, and plan in advance whom
you want to tell and when and how you want to tell them.
You don’t have to tell anyone about your child’s hep C, but you’ll
probably want to notify healthcare workers so your child can get
the appropriate medical care. You may feel ethically obligated to
tell other people who might be exposed to your child’s blood when
he gets the usual childhood scrapes and cuts from normal playing
and roughhousing. If you’re concerned about whom to tell and
what the ramifications might be for your child, speak with a lawyer.
All schools, childcare centers, camps, and other institutions are
required by law to practice universal precautions when dealing
with any person’s blood or body fluids. (Universal precautions
involve wearing latex gloves, and goggles if necessary, to protect
the skin when dealing with blood or body fluids.) These safety pre-
cautions protect others from getting a bloodborne virus, such as
hepatitis C or even HIV. Because some children can be virus carriers
without even knowing it, every child’s blood or body fluid should
be treated as though it might be infected.
A common concern is that some individuals— perhaps babysitters,
mothers of other children, or even other children — may not know
or practice safe techniques when dealing with your child’s blood.
You can decide on a case-by-case basis whom to tell after evaluat-
ing their potential risk of infection. You can also ask people to keep
the information confidential. Here are some tips for telling people
about your kid’s hep C:
 Prepare yourself by having a script of what you’ll say, and
have answers to possible questions.
 Speak to your spouse so that both of you are prepared and
can support each other.
 Have some information leaflets about hep C to give to people
(see the resources listed in Chapter 22).
 Inform folks that hep C isn’t easily spread; it only spreads
through blood. Everyone should take precautions if exposed
Chapter 17: Helping Kids with Hepatitis C 235

to his blood (just as they would if exposed to anyone’s blood):
Use latex gloves to dress any wounds, dispose of blood-soaked
items with care, and cover all your child’s cuts.
 Remind them that your child deserves to be treated with as
much love and respect as any child. 
When you tell people about your child’s hep C, you face the risk
of discrimination. I hope that you don’t encounter this problem,
which usually results from ignorance and fear, but discrimination
does sometimes occur. Discrimination or stigma is one of the most
painful things that a child with hepatitis C may go through.
To avoid this potential problem, some parents may opt not to tell
anyone about their child’s hepatitis C. Other parents seek legal
advice and inform certain select individuals: babysitters, school
nurses, and so on. For more advice, speak to your doctor, find a
support group of parents of children with hepatitis C (or other
infectious diseases), and check out Chapter 15 for related informa-
tion on stigma.
To get support and information on issues including discrimination,
check out a great organization called Parents of Kids with Infectious
Diseases (phone toll-free, 877-557-5437, or visit the Web site at www.
pkids.org); it has a listserv for parents of kids with infectious dis-
eases. If you can’t find a support group near your home, you can
communicate with other parents by e-mail or telephone, or start
your own group!
Tell people that hepatitis C isn’t easily spread and that common
activities, such as changing diapers, hugging, sharing food or water,
swimming in the same pool, or even sneezing, won’t spread the
virus. Some people confuse hepatitis C and hepatitis A (which is
spread through diapers, food, and water). Educate yourself on the
differences among the different hepatitis C viruses (which I describe
in Chapter 2) so you can inform others.
Part IV: Considering Different Groups with Hepatitis C 
236
Using artistic expression
You may want to try letting your child explain to you through art how he feels about
the having hepatitis or liver disease. Because many children (and adults) love art-
work, ask your child to draw a liver or what it feels like to have hepatitis disease,
having tests, and so on. Give him paper, crayons, paint, pencils, and any other art
supplies that may help him express himself. Don’t judge the artwork, and always
ask whether he wants to display it somewhere in your home.

Keeping your child healthy
Children with hep C are advised to avoid toxins, eat healthy foods,
refrain from alcohol and drugs, and get vaccinated against hepati-
tis A and B. Here are some specific tips for ways parents can help
their kids stay healthy:
 Protect them from toxins. Because a child may live with
chronic hepatitis C infection for many decades, avoiding toxic
exposures that can also damage the liver becomes especially
important. (See Chapter 12 for a discussion of dangerous sub-
stances.) As children get older, talk to them about the dangers
of smoking, drinking, and using drugs, particularly if they
have hepatitis C.
 Serve healthy foods and encourage drinking plenty of water.
Your doctor may have recommendations for your infant or child
about foods that are easier to digest, especially if the young-
ster is having digestive troubles. (See Chapter 11 for the scoop
about good nutrition.) The most important advice may be to
avoid certain trouble foods, such as fatty and sugary foods.
Introduce your children at a young age to fresh fruits and veg-
etables. Give them whole grains and organic foods, if you can.
 Get your child vaccinated against hepatitis A and B. Hepatitis
A and B can spread easily in childcare settings. Talk to your
pediatrician about getting your child immunized against both
of these viruses, which also damage the liver. If your baby has
hep C, being co-infected with another type of hepatitis virus
can be dangerous. See Chapter 2 for more on the problems of
co-infection.
Dealing with emotional issues
Having a child with hep C can be a huge strain on the parents and
siblings of a child who is ill. You may be filled with worry about
your child’s future or overwhelmed by dealing with your own
issues if you yourself have hepatitis C. Get help and advice from
your doctor or support group, or contact Parents of Kids with
Infectious Diseases (PKIDs). You also may want to consider getting
professional help for yourself and your family.
Letting your child have a happy childhood experience can be a
help for children and parents! PKIDs has a summer-camp program
for kids with hepatitis B or C. At two different camps, one in upstate
New York and one in Florida, children from ages 8 to 16 with chronic
hepatitis C can experience fun and meet other children with the
disease, all while having expert medical attention. Contact
www.pkids.org or call 877-557-5437 for more information.

Hepatitis C
In This Chapter

 Assessing the needs of those with HIV, drug users, and prisoners
I
n this chapter, I’ve gathered information for certain groups to
make it easier to find. Use this information to help yourself or a
loved one. Because this chapter (or this book) doesn’t have enough
room to give individualized information for every possible person
with hep C, I focus on covering info that applies specifically to men,
women, and the two largest minority groups with hep C in the
United States: African Americans and Latinos. (See Chapter 17 for
special information on pregnancy and children with hepatitis C.)
I also provide information here for groups that are traditionally
shunned by society: people who are or have been in jail, have
injected illegal drugs, or have human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV). The reality is that hepatitis C infection is very high in these
groups where information and resources to deal with the physical,
emotional, and financial impact of the disease are often in short
supply.
Gender and Hepatitis C
Whether you are male or female, hepatitis C can be devastating in
its effects on your health and your life. Each gender has some spe-
cific problems that are related to effects of hep C on hormones.
The liver helps process the female and male sex hormones, estrogen
and testosterone, respectively. So it’s no surprise to find that when

the liver is damaged by hepatitis C, your hormone levels can get
out of whack. Hormones play a role in your sexual desire and your
ability to perform sexually (see Chapter 15 for more on this issue).
They also function in reproduction and a woman’s menstrual cycle.
The actual effects of hepatitis C on your hormones depend on how
well your liver is functioning. If you have cirrhosis, and your liver
function is impaired, then the problems with hormones can be
more serious. 
Birth control
In considering birth control methods, ask yourself the following
questions:
 Will it protect you or your partner from pregnancy and/or sex-
ually transmitted diseases?
 Will it protect your sex partner from your hep C?
 Is the method of birth control safe for you and your partner?
The latex condom, for example, can protect against sexually trans-
mitted diseases like hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency
virus, but it’s not as effective in preventing pregnancy as the birth
control pill (which doesn’t protect against sexually transmitted 
diseases and may have health risks for women with hep C).
During hepatitis C drug treatment, you must use two reliable meth-
ods of birth control to avoid problems of birth defects associated
with the drugs.
For women
Hepatitis C infection and liver disease can affect women’s hormones,
premenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms, and perhaps even
fertility. More studies are needed to fully understand and treat
women’s issues and to understand how women’s hormones may
affect the progression of liver disease.
Premenstrual syndrome and menstruation
Hep C can cause changes in your periods or premenstrual symptoms
(PMS), but it may be difficult to sort out whether the symptoms
are a result of hep C or PMS. Moodiness, achiness, depression, and
fatigue can go along with premenstrual syndrome, hepatitis C, or
even menopause.
During menstruation, when you’re actively bleeding, anyone exposed
to your blood can become infected if you have the hep C virus in
Part IV: Considering Different Groups with Hepatitis C 
240

your blood at this time (as determined by tests described in
Chapter 6). During menstruation, protect your loved ones by:
 Practicing safer sex (by using a latex condom) or abstaining
from sex. Talk to your sex partner about your hep C so he can
protect himself (see Chapter 15).
 Safely disposing of your sanitary products by wrapping them
properly so that no one in your household will inadvertently
be exposed to your blood.
In the later stages of hepatitis C, your body may not tolerate the
hormones (estrogen and progesterone) in birth control pills, so
discuss birth control options with your doctor. Some doctors rec-
ommend a progesterone-only pill.
Pregnancy and childbirth
You can still have children and breastfeed when you have hep C,
although there’s a small (about 5 percent) risk of passing the hep C
virus to your child during birth. As I discuss in Chapter 17, the
decision to have children when you have hep C is intensely personal.
Discuss this topic with your partner and healthcare professional.
Although hep C is present in breast milk, the virus isn’t thought to
spread this way. You’re advised to refrain from breastfeeding, how-
ever, if your nipples are cracked or bleeding.
Menopause
Your estrogen levels change after menopause, and many women
experience problems like night sweats, foggy thinking, moodiness,
fatigue, and osteoporosis (thinning bones) that can also be symp-
toms of hep C or cirrhosis.
Some women go on hormone replacement therapy to help with
symptoms of menopause, but this must be done with care if you
have hep C. Your doctor can help you make the best decision after
weighing the pros and cons of this treatment. Chapters 11 and 13
have advice that also may help ease some of the symptoms.
Your doctor should monitor you for osteoporosis, because both
menopause and cirrhosis can contribute to this problem.
For men
Men also experience hormonal difficulties, especially in the later
stages of liver disease. Decreased levels of testosterone can lead to
the following:
Chapter 18: Special Groups with Hepatitis C 241

 Enlarged breasts (gynecomastia)
 Sexual difficulties, including lack of interest in sex, problems
with erection (erectile dysfunction), and ejaculation problems
Problems with your sexual functioning can affect your relation-
ships and self-esteem. See your physician for medical advice. 
I discuss loss of interest in sex in more depth in Chapter 15.
In the United States, more men than women have hepatitis C. Some
of the risk factors leading to the infection — using street drugs,
spending time in jail, and serving in Vietnam — are believed to
account for this difference. Men are also more likely to develop
serious liver disease than women. Different theories try to explain
why men are more likely to get cirrhosis, including the following:
 Men drink more alcohol, which damages the liver, than
women.
 The female hormone estrogen may protect women to some
extent from developing liver disease.
Ethnicity and Hepatitis C
If you’re a non-Caucasian person with hepatitis C, you may want to
ask your prospective liver doctor a question in addition to those
listed in Chapter 5: Have you treated women or men of my ethnic
group with hepatitis C?
Depending on your ethnicity, you may have a different way of
responding to the interferon treatment. Because interferon treat-
ment has serious side effects, you must evaluate the risks of the
treatment in light of its potential benefit to you. Also, as new studies
become available, recommendations for treating specific groups of
people are being made.
African Americans
Researchers are paying increased attention to hep C in African
Americans. Here’s what’s known at this point:
 An estimated 10 percent of African American males between
the ages of 40 and 49 have the hep C virus.
 Overall, 3.2 percent of African Americans are estimated
to have hep C (compared with 1.5 percent of whites and 
2.1 percent of Latinos).
Part IV: Considering Different Groups with Hepatitis C 
242

 African Americans have a higher rate of genotype 1 infection,
which is more resistant to treatment (see Chapter 8).
 African Americans have a lower responsiveness to interferon
treatment than non-African Americans.
 Disease progression may be slower in African Americans than
in Caucasians. African Americans have lower levels of the ALT
(alanine aminotransferase) enzyme, which is used to measure
liver damage, and less fibrosis (liver scarring) than non-African
Americans. (For more on ALT, see Chapter 7.)
 African American men are more likely to develop liver cancer.
As more African Americans are included in clinical trials,
researchers are identifying the best types of treatment options.
Make sure that your doctor is up-to-date on the studies involving
African Americans and recommendations for treatment. Chapter 8
covers treatment issues in general.
Latinos and Hispanics
About 2.1 percent (or 1 out of 50) of Hispanics are infected with
hepatitis C virus. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) defines a Hispanic or Latino as a person who
may be any race and is of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or
Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin. Hispanics of
all races make up about 12.5 percent of the U.S. population.
Studies on the effectiveness of interferon drug treatments for
Hispanics are even fewer than those for African Americans.
Researchers believe that the effectiveness of combination inter-
feron treatment in Hispanics is dependent on the hep C genotype.
Language can be a barrier to getting information out about hep C
and its prevention in the Latino communities. The CDC, American
Liver Foundation, and other organizations provide information in
Spanish (see Chapter 22 for resources). Another source of informa-
tion is LOLA (Latino Organization for Liver Awareness). Contact
the group through its Web site, www.lola-national.org, or call
888-367-5652.
Veterans
Veterans in the United States are more likely to be infected with
hepatitis C than nonveterans. The U.S. Veterans Administration (VA)
reports that around 5.4 percent of veterans in the VA healthcare
system are positive for the hep C virus. The VA says that veterans
Chapter 18: Special Groups with Hepatitis C 243

are more at risk of having hep C if they’ve injected illegal drugs,
served in the Vietnam War, been in jail for more than 48 hours,
or received a tattoo. The VA has set up a Web site at http://
hepatitis.va.gov specifically for vets with hep C.
Ways that veterans could have been exposed to hepatitis C include
 Blood or body fluid exposure by healthcare or combat 
personnel
 Contamination of vaccinations or immune globulin (which are
antibodies from pooled blood that is given to boost your
immunity to certain infections)
 Sharing shaving razors or other nonsterile instruments
A point of controversy is whether multidose vaccinations (in which
a jet gun was used to perform multiple vaccinations on many differ-
ent people) served as a source of infection with hepatitis C during
the Vietnam War.
Healthcare Workers
If you’re a healthcare, emergency medical, or public safety worker,
the CDC recommends testing for hepatitis C infection after expo-
sure to HCV-positive blood through a puncture of your skin by a
needlestick or other sharp object.
If you’re exposed to a needlestick or sharps, and the contaminating
blood is infected with hep C, you have about a 2 percent chance of
getting infected. Exposure is also possible if infected blood comes
in contact with your mucosal membranes (mouth, eyes, and nose),
although infection by this route is unlikely.
See a hepatitis specialist for specific treatment guidelines if you’re
exposed to hepatitis C on the job. Some doctors may consider early
treatment, which at the time of this writing is not FDA-approved,
but early studies indicate that treatment is more likely to eradicate
the virus at this early stage of infection.
People Co-Infected with HIV
and Hepatitis C
Because HIV is spread through blood and body fluids, and hepati-
tis C is spread through blood, many folks have both viruses. Here
are some other facts on the transmission of these viruses:
Part IV: Considering Different Groups with Hepatitis C 
244

 HIV can spread through sex, and any type of sex that involves
exposure to blood can also spread the hepatitis C virus (see
Chapter 2).
 Injection of street drugs is a major route of both HIV and hep-
atitis C infection, and leads to most cases of co-infection.
 Hemophiliacs and others who received infected blood or
blood products may also have been exposed to both viruses.
 HIV spreads more easily from mother to child than the 
hepatitis C virus, and HIV can also be transmitted through
breastfeeding.
Hepatitis B can also be spread in the same way as HIV, and a
person can be co-infected with both hepatitis B and hepatitis C
(see Chapter 2) or hepatitis B and HIV.
Having two viruses makes it more challenging for your body and
your medical team to fight each infection. HIV causes an immunod-
eficiency disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
When you have AIDS, your body is less able to fight the hepatitis C
virus. Another complication is that the drugs used to fight HIV
infection can be harmful to your liver, which may already be dam-
aged from the hepatitis C virus. Your doctor will monitor your liver
for any additional damage and make changes in your HIV medication
if necessary.
Treatment strategies for people with HIV who are co-infected with
hepatitis C virus have improved as studies look at this special pop-
ulation. Peginterferon plus ribavirin is the current treatment of
choice if you’re co-infected with HIV and hepatitis C.
For current information on HIV, hepatitis C, and co-infection stud-
ies, check out the Web sites of HIVandHepatitis.com (www.hiv
andhepatitis.com) and the National AIDS Treatment Advocacy
Project (www.natap.org). You can also contact NATAP toll-free at
888-266-2827.
People Who Inject Illegal Drugs
Sharing needles or other drug paraphernalia remains the likeliest
form of transmission. Taking drugs through your nose can also
spread hepatitis C if you share paraphernalia for snorting. Many
people who use illegal drugs are outside the conventional healthcare
system and may not receive adequate treatment. See Chapter 16
for suggestions on getting healthcare if you’re not insured.
Chapter 18: Special Groups with Hepatitis C 245

Agencies that deal with harm reduction accept that drug use is part
of the world and work to reduce the harm that comes from illicit
drug use, including hepatitis C infection. Rather than punish or
judge drug users, harm reduction aims to empower drug users
to help themselves without minimizing the problems that drug
use causes. For more about this topic, visit the Web site www.
harmreduction.org. And I discuss the problems of drug use and
hepatitis C infection in Chapter 12.
People in Prison
Millions of Americans are currently housed in correctional facilities.
Experts estimate that an average of 30 to 35 percent of all people in
prison have hepatitis C. Many people in jail have injected illegal
drugs or engaged in commercial sex (prostitution), which are two
routes of hepatitis C infection. If you get a tattoo or piercing while
in a correctional facility, you also can get infected with the hepati-
tis C virus.
Whether or not you’ll be offered testing and treatment while in
prison depends on each individual facility. If you have hepatitis C
and fulfill the criteria for treatment at that facility (see Chapter 8
for information on drug treatment), the doctor will want to make
sure that you’ll be able to complete the drug regimen, which may
be a year or more. That means that you may have to forgo early
parole or release from prison so that you can complete the medical
treatment before leaving the facility.
If you don’t finish treatment, the problem is that you might not
have health insurance to continue treatment as soon as you leave
prison, and completing the entire course of treatment is especially
important with hep C medications.
Many prisoners also have HIV or mental illness alongside their
hep C. If you have these conditions, you need proper treatment
for these illnesses before or during your treatment for hepatitis C
virus.
Some prisons offer information on hep C risk reduction through
education about avoiding drug use and practicing safer injection
drug use and safer sex. For more information about hepatitis C in
prisons, check out the Web site for the National Hepatitis C Prison
Coalition, www.hcvinprison.org.

Chapter 19
For Family and Friends
In This Chapter
 Finding out all you can about hepatitis C
 Keeping yourself healthy
 Serving on the support team
 Sharing a household
 Considering sexual partners
 Finding creative ways to help out
T
he hepatitis C virus can infect anyone: your husband, best
friend, or co-worker. When you find out about your loved one’s
illness, you may feel confused and scared. He or she may be in the
early stages of illness or have advanced liver disease and be unable
to work. What will happen to the person? How can you help?
Whether you’re the primary caretaker or a long-distance relative,
your support can help. In this chapter, I give you the lowdown on
how to educate yourself about hep C, how to help the person you
care about, and how to keep yourself well too.
Enlightening Yourself about
Hepatitis C
The more you know about hepatitis C, the more you can help your
friend, partner, or family member deal with this long-term chronic
illness. Get reliable information from different sources. This book
has chapters on just about all aspects of living with hepatitis C.
Consult the resources I provide within individual chapters and in
Chapter 22 for additional information.

Here are some topics that you may want to know more about:
 The ways that hepatitis C is and isn’t transmitted (see
Chapter 2)
 The different types of diseases associated with hepatitis C
(see Chapter 4)
 Different treatment options (see Chapters 8, 9, and 10)
 Maintaining a healthy lifestyle (see Chapters 11 and 13 for
more about nutrition and exercise, respectively)
Consider volunteering for your local branch of the American Liver
Foundation or another hepatitis C–related organization. These
organizations can always use volunteers for a variety of tasks. See
Chapter 22 for some contact info for these groups.
Taking Care of Yourself
Who takes care of the caretakers? If you give too much to other
people and don’t take care of yourself, you could suffer from early
burnout and then be unavailable when you’re really needed. Just
as airlines tell passengers to give themselves oxygen in an emer-
gency before giving oxygen masks to children, your first priority is
taking care of yourself.
Rather than put this section last, I put it early in this chapter so
that you remember to keep all of your own support in place while
helping your loved one with hepatitis C. Ask yourself these ques-
tions to help ensure that you take care of yourself:
 Are you taking care of your own physical needs? Do you get
enough sleep, eat well, and exercise regularly?
 Do you have someone to talk to? You might feel worried or
frustrated about your friend and need a supportive friend or
professional therapist to help you.
 Do you have time off from being the caregiver? Sometimes you
won’t be able to help as much as you would like. Figure out
how to use the word no when you need to.
If you stay in good emotional, mental, and physical shape, your
loved one will benefit much more from your calm and healthy 
attitude.
If you’re the primary caretaker, assemble a team of helpers so all
the responsibilities don’t fall on your shoulders.
Part IV: Considering Different Groups with Hepatitis C 
248

Being Part of a Support Team
Everyone with hepatitis C needs a support team. The support team
for people with hepatitis C includes family and friends, healthcare
providers, and other professionals, such as financial advisers and
social workers. Although one person may “lead” the team, a group
of people should be providing support. For example, some family
and friends may be able to lend a listening ear on the telephone,
while others can cook meals and drive children to school.
Providing support for your loved one is even more crucial when
she’s undergoing interferon treatment (see Chapter 8) or getting a
liver transplant (see Chapter 9).
Being a fan-club member
Your loved one may naturally feel down while living with symp-
toms of hepatitis C (see Chapter 4). One of the important roles
of a support-team member is to have faith in your friend and to
cheer him through the struggles of illness. You can be a fan-club
supporter by:
 Letting your friend or relative know she’s loved and valued:
Let her know that you care and that she matters even if she
has low energy or is ill. The person with hep C doesn’t need to
do anything to be loved.
 Providing encouragement: Encouragement is always wel-
come, and it’s especially needed during difficult times. But
remember to also provide a boost when your loved one is
approaching milestones. Celebrate months or years after
beginning treatment, stopping smoking, giving up alcohol, or
surviving a changed job situation.
 Joining your loved one in making healthier lifestyle
changes: See the section “Changing habits together,” later
in this chapter.
Here are some things that won’t be helpful:
 Harping on how your loved one got hep C: However the
person acquired the hep C virus, the fact is that she has it.
No amount of analyzing can wish it away. Your loved one is
probably upset enough about how she may have gotten it —
whether from former drug use, a workplace accident, or a
medical procedure. Concentrate on helping your loved one
get better now, rather than focusing on the past.
Chapter 19: For Family and Friends 249

 Criticizing your loved one’s decisions about treatment: The
decision of how and when to pursue different treatments is
intensely personal. If you’re unhappy with your spouse’s
choice of doctor or treatment or wish to ask them to try
another approach, speak to her calmly and respectfully —
once, or maybe twice. Ultimately, the final decision for treat-
ment is up to the person with hepatitis C. The last thing your
wife needs now is hurtful criticism.
 Complaining about having to do all the work around the
house: Believe me, your loved one would much rather be well
enough to do housework, no matter how much she hates it.
To keep your own mental and physical health intact, help out
only as much as you can, and no more. If you do more than
you’re able to, you can easily get angry or resentful, and such
reactions are no help to anyone. See the section “Doing house-
work,” later in this chapter.
Communicating with your loved one
Keeping the lines of communication open and honest can help the
person with hep C. As a friend or relative, you can help by letting
the person with hep C know that you’re available if and when she
wants to talk.
Listening is one of the most useful ways to support someone. How,
when, or where your friend or relative wants to communicate is up
to her, but you can let her know you’re available. When your loved
one starts speaking, listen without judgment. Your friend may not
want any advice but may just need to vent or express thoughts and
feelings.
Your loved one with hep C may have trouble communicating sensi-
tive issues. Listen carefully when he wants to:
 Tell you or others about his disease or how he got it. (Deciding
whom to tell and how to tell them is one of the challenges for
people with hep C; see Chapter 15 for more on this topic.)
 Discuss frustrations and emotions about his change in health
or lifestyle.
 Talk about fears of illness or death.
 Ask for help.
You might want to communicate the following things to your
loved one:
Part IV: Considering Different Groups with Hepatitis C 
250

 Your desire to help out.
 Your own limitations in how much you can help. Explain from
the start that your time or abilities may be restricted, but you
want to help nevertheless.
 Your own fears or sadness about the person’s illness.
Different people have different ways of communicating, depending
on their gender and culture. Try to be flexible, and let your relative
communicate in a way that works for her.
Changing habits together
Adopting a healthier lifestyle goes along with living with hepatitis
C. When people with hep C exchange unhealthy habits for life-
enhancing practices, they may reduce the severity of some of their
symptoms and maybe even live a longer life.
For most people, changing habits is difficult. Eating certain foods
and drinks is usually the result of a lifetime of practice! Even if you
know that a substance is hurting you (like cigarettes or alcohol),
the attachment or even addiction to certain substances or behav-
iors (such as watching TV and eating junk food) can be almost
impossible to conquer. Some folks with hep C may still be using
drugs. Your loved one should get professional help if needed (see
Chapter 12).
You can also help by changing to a healthier lifestyle yourself.
Showing someone how to change by example works much better
than telling the person what to do! Here are some ways to join in
with your loved one to encourage the new habits:
 Eat healthy meals. Prepare them yourself, or make healthy
choices when you all go out to eat. If you’re watching your
dining companions eat fried or sugary food, giving up
unhealthy choices can be hard, especially at first. Eating
healthy meals is easier if everyone in the family is eating
with you.
 Exercise together. Take walks together, follow a Yoga tape, or
attend a T’ai Chi class. Exercising with someone else is defi-
nitely more fun and inspiring.
 Get together for meditation or religious practice. A sense of
community, shared beliefs, and purpose can lift everyone’s
mood.
 Don’t use cigarettes, drugs, or alcohol yourself — at all or at
least when you’re around your friend or relative with hep C.
Chapter 19: For Family and Friends 251

To get support changing your eating or exercise habits, consider
going to a nutritionist (dietician), professional trainer, or mental
health professional. If you or your partner are addicted to alcohol or
drugs, you can both benefit from professional help (see Chapter 12).
If you’re giving up cigarettes, try a nicotine-replacement product,
or see your doctor for other medications that might help.
Helping with healthcare
Whenever possible, the person with hep C should bring a family
member or friend to all important doctor visits. Two heads are
better than one at remembering what was said and asking perti-
nent questions. A second person can also help drive and navigate
around hospitals and doctors’ offices. Here are some other ways to
help with your loved one’s medical care:
 Help keep the hep C notebook organized. See the suggestions
for keeping a hep C notebook throughout this book.
 Help fill out or file health insurance paperwork or disability
benefit paperwork (see Chapter 16).
 Call the pharmacy to request refills, fill out the paperwork,
and pick up prescriptions.
People with hep C who are very young, very old, or very sick espe-
cially need someone to coordinate their healthcare needs.
Living with Someone with Hep C
If you share a household with a loved one with hep C, you’re in the
frontline of living with the effects of the disease, but you also have
the most potential to help the person cope.
Protecting yourself from infection
Hep C is spread through exposure to infected blood, so when you
live in close quarters with someone who is infected, practicing good
safety habits is important. However, you also need to remember
not to become paranoid or fearful around the person with hep C.
(See Chapter 2 for info about how hep C is transmitted and how to
prevent the spread of hep C.)
Hepatitis C is not spread through casual contact, and members of
the same household will not get the virus unless there is a blood
exchange. As soon as they’re old enough to understand, children
in the household can be told to avoid blood from open wounds or
menstruation.
Part IV: Considering Different Groups with Hepatitis C 
252

Set up the household so that everyone has separate toothbrushes,
toothpaste, razors, manicure scissors, pierced jewelry, and other
items that may pick up small amounts of blood. If your sexual part-
ner has hep C, see the “Being a Sexual Partner of a Person with
Hep C” section, later in this chapter, and Chapter 2.
The most dangerous way to get hep C is to share any drug para-
phernalia whatsoever with anyone else. (See Chapter 2 to read
about transmission.)
Coordinating contacts
In an emergency or when the person with hep C simply is too
fatigued to carry out normal activities, you’ll need a list of people
and places to contact. To prepare for those times, compose a list of
important phone numbers in advance. Here are some suggestions:
 Babysitters
 Doctors and other healthcare providers
 Local hospital or clinic
 Mental health providers and social workers
 Neighbors (who may have extra keys or alarm codes)
 Religious-clergy member or spiritual adviser
 Schools
 Taxi or car service
 Trusted people to pick up your children from school
 Veterinarian or animal-care helpers
 Workplaces
Work together with your loved one to come up with a list of num-
bers, and make a few copies. Keep one copy in the hep C notebook
and other copies in your car or briefcase. Being prepared can
reduce anxiety and stress.
Doing housework
Discuss the household chores openly, and find out what your family
member is able to do without compromising his health. Remember,
he may be using all the energy he has just to work part-time or take
his medication.
Make a detailed list of the household tasks, from cooking to cleaning
to shopping. If you have children, add their needs to the list. You
may need to enlist more help from family and friends, hire helpers,
Chapter 19: For Family and Friends 253

or live with a messier home. Another solution is to simplify your
lifestyle so that taking care of the household is easier.
Keeping your home organized by reducing clutter and simplifying
will help make your home easier to clean, keep you on time for
appointments, and keep you up-to-date on childcare arrangements.
Check out these sources:
 Organizing For Dummies, by Eileen Roth and Elizabeth Miles
(Wiley).
 The organizational system outlined on the Web site www.
flylady.net, which can be used by anyone with or without
children, although it’s absolutely great for families
Include your children in helping out. Even if they’re young, they
can help in some way, such as clearing the table or cleaning the
litter box.
Watching for side effects
Hepatitis C disease and its treatment produce an array of symptoms
and side effects. It’s not always easy for someone living with these
problems 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to realize when there’s a
change, especially if it’s a change in mood or behavior. You can
provide a gentle mirror to your loved one and let him know if you
notice anything of concern — a new symptom altogether or a
symptom that has gotten worse.
By reading the chapters on symptoms of hepatitis C (Chapter 4)
and interferon treatment (Chapter 8), you may be more aware of
which side effects are possible.
Depression is a common and serious side effect of hepatitis C and
its medical treatment. When depression is untreated, it can affect
someone’s entire life — from home to the workplace. Someone
who is depressed is less likely to practice other healthy behaviors,
such as healthy eating and drinking and exercising. More impor-
tant, a depressed person is less likely to take his medication and
can even be at risk of suicide.
Being a Sexual Partner of 
a Person with Hep C
Although rare, hepatitis C can be spread through sexual contact.
Part IV: Considering Different Groups with Hepatitis C 
254

Hepatitis C is spread through blood, so avoid risky sexual practices
that involve blood, or use protective barriers during these times.
(See Chapter 2 for a discussion of risky behaviors associated with
sexual transmission.)
You may want to get tested for hepatitis C if your sex partner is
positive. If and how you change your sex practices after finding out
about hep C is a personal matter to be discussed with your health-
care practitioner and your partner.
A common problem with hep C infection and treatment is the effect
on the libido. Taking medications, feeling fatigued or depressed, and
worrying about the future have negative effects on sexual desire. I
discuss these problems in Chapter 15. Find time to communicate
with your loved one in other ways (such as talking, cuddling, or 
sitting quietly listening to music). Come up with creative ways to
deal with any differences that may exist in your sexual desires
(see Chapter 15 for tips on communicating).
If necessary, seek professional help from your doctor or a licensed
mental health worker to deal with sexual issues.
If your partner is being treated for hepatitis C with combination
peginterferon plus ribavirin — the current best treatment — you
both need to practice adequate birth control methods, because
the medications cause severe birth defects.
Listing Some Things You 
Can Do to Help
Are you looking for ways to be supportive, even if you don’t live
with someone with hepatitis C? Here, I list some fun or useful ways
to help out. If you can’t do any of these tasks yourself, then per-
haps you can buy the item or service for your friend or relative.
 Do you have a green thumb? Most people like plants,
although some folks are allergic to flowers. Cut some flowers
from your garden, or buy a bunch from the florist or super-
market. If you have a garden, grow some extra veggies and
supply your buddy with fresh tomatoes or greens (ideally,
grown without pesticides).
 Do you like to cook? Try making some organic vegetable
soup or a tasty casserole and storing a few batches in your
friend’s or relative’s freezer.
Chapter 19: For Family and Friends 255

 Are you handy around the house? Help your loved one
install a water filtration system to get good clean water. Or
make sure his fireplace is clean. Perhaps your friend or rela-
tive needs to install a grip in the bathroom to make getting in
and out of the tub easier. Don’t forget to get permission before
making any improvements!
 Do you like to sew? If your loved one is spending lots of time
in bed, consider making or buying a blanket, quilt, or special
pillow with significant words or pictures.
 Are you trained in the healing arts? If you’re a massage ther-
apist, reiki practitioner, or Yoga teacher, or you’re trained in
another healing art or method, offer your friend some healing
work. Don’t take it personally if your friend isn’t open to your
offer at this time, however. People have different ways of
relaxing and different preferences in healing techniques, and
some people don’t want to work with someone who knows
them personally.
 Do you like pampering others? Even if you’re not profession-
ally trained, maybe you can give your friend or relative a 
manicure, pedicure, or hand or foot massage — if the person
agrees to it. Use gentle motions and play some relaxing music
to help set a peaceful mood.
Professionally trained manicurists and massage therapists know
how to protect themselves from any bloodborne illness that their
clients have. If you give your friend a manicure or pedicure, use
your friend’s or relative’s instruments, because some blood could
be transferred onto the manicure tools. Don’t be paranoid, but
take smart precautions (see the section on protecting others in
Chapter 2). Make sure that any open cuts are covered while you
give a massage, and avoid rubbing an open wound. Note that these
precautions apply to everyone, not just people with hep C. Many
people have hep C or other viruses in their blood and don’t even
know it, so it’s best to carry out safe practices with everyone.
When offering help to others, always respect your loved one’s
wishes. For example, if you make soup and offer to make it again,
but your loved one doesn’t take you up on your offer, don’t take it
personally. Everyone has different tastebuds! Ask whether you can
make something else or help in another way.
Helping others is about giving them what they want or need, not
what you think they should want or need.

Ten Tips for Vacationing
with Hepatitis C
In This Chapter
 Trying out mini-vacations
 Planning ahead for a great trip
 Keeping healthy while away from home
T
aking a break from ordinary activities is wonderful for the mind
and spirit. Having a chronic illness like hepatitis C shouldn’t
keep you from rest and relaxation or even excitement and adven-
ture, if those things are more your style.
You may have no symptoms, be in the middle of drug treatment, or
have some complications from cirrhosis; but whatever your situa-
tion, I bet that you can figure out some sort of break from the daily
grind that’ll help you recharge your batteries. Think about what you
really need. Rest and naps? Good nutritious food? Peaceful com-
muning with nature? Time with friends and family? Adventure to
exotic places?
While beginning to plan for your trip, speak to your healthcare pro-
fessional for recommendations tailored to fit your situation. Certain
places or types of travel could have more risk of aggravating your
hep C disease. Also, be realistic about your financial situation, and
consult with your family.
Anticipating your needs is the way to have things go smoothly.
This chapter gives you some ideas for keeping your trip safe and
enjoyable.
Trying a Mini-Vacation
You may not feel ready for a long trip. You may have just been diag-
nosed or just started treatment for hep C. Maybe you’re concerned

about your energy levels or symptoms. Instead of giving up the
idea of a vacation altogether, why not try a short trip near home?
You may want to make your first trip an easy half-day journey, or
maybe you feel up to a full day. Use these as enjoyable trial runs
for your trips farther afield. Or you may find that the mini-vacations
are enough for you. Consult local newspapers for schedules of
local events that interest you. Here are some ideas for getaways:
 If you live in or near a city, become a tourist again, and plan
a day of sightseeing, using public transportation or walking
around town. Visit a museum, see a show, or go to a sports
event. You can even stay overnight in a hotel in your own city!
 If a country outing is more to your liking, walk through the
woods, bike, visit a special event, or go antiquing along back
roads. Try an interesting restaurant or plan a picnic dinner
(weather permitting). You may want to camp or stay at a
quaint bed-and-breakfast.
The point is to enjoy yourself and see how you feel. Because you’re
nearby, you can always return home earlier if you need to.
After your trip, note how you feel. Do you feel rejuvenated or
exhausted? Is your stomach upset? Write down your experiences,
particularly any problems. When you plan your next mini-vacation
or a longer trip, you can use this information to make better choices.
Bringing Your Medicine
When traveling, bring along a supply of any medications you’re
taking that will last for the duration of your trip. But also take
copies of your prescriptions — in case you run into any trouble
with customs or lose your medication.
If you’ll be on hep C drug treatment while traveling, speak to your
doctor, preferably in the planning stages of your trip rather than a
day before leaving. Your doctor should be able to give you some
advice about whether she thinks that you’re good to go or whether
you should stay close to home in case of side effects.
Keep these considerations about your medical supplies in mind:
 When traveling with a needle or syringe, keep all medication
in its original packaging. Have prescriptions handy for
syringes and associated medicines.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
260 Part V: The Part of Tens 

 You may need to bring some type of insulated cooler to keep
medications at a cold temperature. Freeze some water bottles
to put in the cooler, and keep the medicines near but not
touching the frozen bottle. Be sure that you don’t freeze your
medicine: Wrap it in a gel pack to protect it from freezing or
breaking within your cooler.
Don’t start a new medication just before you travel, because it can
cause side effects that you may not be prepared for.
If you take herbs or vitamins, bring enough for your trip. Keep them
in the original packages or bottles to avoid delays at customs or
airport security (so officials don’t wonder what those herbs are)
or if you need to replace them.
Protecting Your Family and Others
If you have hepatitis C, you have the potential to infect others. It’s
especially important to remember this during travel, because your
normal routine is disrupted, and you may be in closer contact with
your family. Simply plan ahead:
 Bring your own toothbrush, toothpaste, razors, and other per-
sonal items.
 Keep your personal items in one or more closed plastic con-
tainers labeled with your name.
 Keep some adhesive bandages and other wound coverings in
your wallet or purse, as well as in your luggage. Vacations and
travel seem to bring about more cuts and bruises.
Practice safe sex to protect others from sexual transmission of hep
C. Doing so has the added benefit of protecting you from other sex-
ually transmitted diseases. Both male and female latex condoms
are available.
Staying Healthy
You probably have a routine at home that keeps your fatigue and
tummy problems away, but when you’re traveling, everything is
different. For this reason, many people are scared of travel. But
you can practice good self-care even when you’re vacationing:
 Make sure to get enough rest. Don’t go to bed late if you have
to wake up early. Take as many naps as you want. This is a
vacation, remember?
Chapter 20: Ten Tips for Vacationing with Hepatitis C 261

 Don’t overdo it. Most folks get excited when they’re discovering
a new place, so they want to see and do everything. Avoid that
temptation. Enjoy one garden, one museum (or even one room
in a museum), or one city rather than ten gardens in a morning,
five museums in a day, or ten cities in a week. The quality of
your experience matters more than the quantity, especially
when overdoing it may put you flat on your back in exhaustion.
 Drink plenty of water. Take water bottles with you every-
where. They’ll keep you hydrated and help with just about
everything (how’s that for a superscientific explanation?).
 Eat with care. Temptations abound to eat junk food or rich
exotic food. If you have problems with your digestion, con-
sider these tips:
• Think twice before indulging in fried fatty food.
• Bring healthy snacks that you know agree with you.
• Go to restaurants that offer you choices that usually
don’t upset your stomach.
• Plan ahead. If you know that you need to eat every three
hours, and you’ll be on the road, bring snacks for the
car, or plan to stop at a suitable restaurant.
 Watch out for the sun and humidity. Your medications may
make you more sensitive to the sun. Use sunscreen, sunglasses,
a hat, and long-sleeved, light-colored clothing to protect you
from the sun. Better yet, take a siesta when the sun is high in
the sky.
For your own safety, I recommend getting the hepatitis A and hepa-
titis B vaccines, if you’re not already immune to these viruses
(determined by testing your blood). As described in Chapter 2, 
getting another type of hepatitis virus could lead to more serious
illness. Even if you never leave the United States, these vaccina-
tions are recommended.
Flying with Ease
No, I can’t explain how to flap your wings, but I can tell you how to
make flying in a plane more pleasant.
 Wear comfortable clothing.
 Reduce stress by giving yourself plenty of time to get to the
airport.
 Call your airline in advance to see whether you have choices
in food plans, such as fruit or vegetarian meals.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
262

 Bring bottled water and healthy snacks. If you have to sit in
the airport during a flight delay, airport food options may not
be the healthiest ones.
 If you have trouble walking, ask the airline for help getting to
your gate. The airlines will drive you through the airport or
provide a wheelchair.
 Bring sanitary wipes or a liquid disinfectant with you.
Thousands of passengers travel on airplanes and pass
through airports every day, so you risk catching some air-
borne illness. Cleaning your hands frequently may prevent
you from catching some germs.
Choosing Foreign Travel
Destinations
The farther you go from home and the less developed the des-
tination country is, the more risk you take if things go awry. In
developing countries, funds and the government infrastructure are
not in place to reliably protect the water supplies, food sources, or
blood supply. Tropical countries have diseases like malaria and
yellow fever, which are transmitted through mosquito bites. The
water, food, and even the blood supply can be contaminated with
infectious agents.
When traveling within the United States and Canada or to Japan,
Australia, New Zealand, and Western Europe, your risks are
much less.
Vaccination against infectious diseases is required for travel to
many developing countries. When traveling to developing coun-
tries, find out which vaccines or prevention medicines you should
take. Also, if you’re traveling to more than one country, check out
how that affects your vaccination requirements. Here are a few
sources:
 U.S. Centers for Disease Control: The travel section of the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web site,
www.cdc.gov, has links for travel clinics in each state as well
as a wealth of information on travel destinations.
 International Society of Travel Medicine: Check out
www.istm.org, which lists travel clinics all over the world
(including the United States and Canada).
These travel clinics offer pretrip advising and vaccination as well
as post-travel medical consultation.
Chapter 20: Ten Tips for Vacationing with Hepatitis C 263

If you are on any type of interferon treatment or are taking immuno-
suppressive medication after a liver transplant, you must consult
your doctor before your trip. These medications affect your immune
system, and you may be advised to take extra care or even avoid
foreign travel, which may expose you to dangerous infections.
Steering Clear of Travelers’
Diarrhea
Travel to foreign countries with unprotected water supplies means
that you or anyone in your family may get an infection that causes
travelers’ diarrhea. If you have liver problems, you may be more
sensitive to such an infection.
Your doctor may give you antibiotics to bring along in case you get
sick. Speak to your healthcare provider, who will properly advise
you on prevention strategies.
Here are tips for preventing travelers’ diarrhea through safe eating
and drinking practices:
 Eat food that has been cooked thoroughly, is still hot, and
hasn’t been sitting around unheated for a long period of time.
 Avoid uncooked food, except fruits and vegetables that you
peel or shell yourself.
 Avoid dishes containing raw or undercooked eggs.
 Don’t buy food from street vendors.
 Drink only beverages that come from bottles or cans or that
have been boiled.
 Use bottled (or boiled) water for brushing your teeth.
 Avoid ice unless you know it has been made from purified water.
Concerning Mosquito-Borne
Infections
Travelers must provide vaccination papers for yellow fever and
malaria when traveling to many tropical locales, and these diseases
can present special complications for folks with hepatitis C. Check
with your doctor, travel agent, a travel guide, or the www.cdc.gov
Web site to see whether either of these infections is a problem
where you’re traveling:
Part V: The Part of Tens 
264

 Yellow fever: Yellow fever is a virus transmitted through 
mosquitoes and can be prevented by immunization. The 
vaccination against yellow fever uses a live vaccine.
 Malaria: This parasite is transmitted through another type of
mosquito (not the mosquito that spreads yellow fever). You
need to take preventive antimalaria medications (called pro-
phylactic medication), but some of these can cause damage to
your liver. Your doctor will advise you on which medications
to take.
Avoiding mosquito bites is important in the tropics, where you
may encounter malaria or yellow fever. (It’s also a good idea to
avoid being bitten in the United States, where mosquitoes can
transmit West Nile virus.) Ways to avoid being bitten include
 Try to stay inside when insects are biting (usually at night,
but this differs among different types of insects). Make sure
that you have adequate protection when sleeping: good
screens on windows, netting over your bed, or insect-
repellent coils.
 If you go outside when insects are biting, wear long-sleeved
clothing, and tuck your shirt in. You might need to use an
insect repellent. The most-used and -tested bug spray con-
tains DEET, which repels mosquitoes, ticks, and other bugs.
Read and follow the labels of any insect repellents you use.
DEET and other pesticides are toxins and should be used with
extreme caution, washed off when you’re inside, and avoided
if possible.
Getting Medical Care Abroad
Prepare for the unexpected. During travel to foreign countries,
you could have an accident or medical emergency and need
urgent medical care. Discuss with your doctor or travel special-
ist bringing certain medications for self-treatment in case you
become ill.
Find out in advance what your health insurance will cover when
you are overseas. Medicare, for example, doesn’t cover hospital
or medical costs outside the United States. If your policy provides
coverage in foreign countries, get copies of any bills or receipts,
and carry an insurance policy card and claim forms with you. Try
Chapter 20: Ten Tips for Vacationing with Hepatitis C 265

to obtain travel insurance that provides assistance if you get ill or
have a medical emergency. You may have to pay in advance and
get reimbursed later.
In developing countries, you’re at risk if you require medical proce-
dures that use reused needles or blood transfusions. The blood
supply may be contaminated with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C
(you can get other genotypes on top of your own infection).
Avoiding Dangerous Practices
You can have fun while traveling! But avoid the temptation to take
risks while on vacation or in foreign countries. I’m assuming you’ve
taken my advice, given throughout this book, to avoid alcohol and
injecting drugs altogether. Certainly, don’t drink or use drugs in a
foreign country! You need to keep your wits about you.
Because of less sanitary conditions in developing countries, leave
the tattoos and piercings for when you get home. You risk catching
HIV or other infections from unsterilized equipment. Even with a
clean needle, the ink from the tattoo pot could be reused, and you
could exchange a virus with the last client or the next one.
Having unprotected sex at any time is risky. Protect yourself from
HIV, hepatitis B, or other sexually transmitted diseases by using a
latex male condom or a female condom. You should also protect
others from your hepatitis C virus.
Swimming in natural bodies of water can be a potential risk,
because the water may be polluted with sewage. Even swimming
pools with chlorine may have some contamination. Don’t swallow
any water, and avoid entering the water if you have unprotected
cuts or wounds.

Ten Tips for Sleeping Well
with Hepatitis C
In This Chapter
 Getting enough exercise and fresh air
 Creating comfortable sleeping conditions
 Using scents or tapes to relax
G
etting a good night’s sleep is important for everyone. You
need your sleep to rejuvenate your body, mind, and emo-
tions. For folks facing an illness like hepatitis C, you can see why
this nightly revitalization is even more important.
But the twist is that the physical and emotional stresses and com-
plications that folks with hep C face can wreak havoc with the
nighttime nap. Stress, anxiety, night sweats, hep C medications,
aches and pains, depression, or other illnesses can all contribute
to insomnia: difficulty falling asleep, difficulty remaining asleep, or
waking up too early.
Don’t take any over-the-counter sleeping remedies unless they’re
recommended by a healthcare practitioner who’s knowledgeable
about liver disease. Some products contain substances that could
hurt your liver (see Chapter 12 for info on toxic substances).
In this chapter, I give you some safe self-help tips to help you get a
good night’s sleep. If you find that you still have trouble sleeping
after following these tips, discuss the problem with your doctor,
who can recommend or prescribe sleeping remedies or medications.
Get Exercise and Country Air
When you lie down to sleep, make sure that your body is good and
tired and ready for bed by moving it during the day (see Chapter 13

for suggestions on exercise and movement). But don’t exercise for
a few hours right before bedtime, because doing so can keep you
awake.
You know that old saying about country air’s giving you a good
appetite and a good night’s sleep? It’s worth a try. Get fresh air by
using deep-breathing techniques (see Chapter 13), getting some
outdoor exercise during the day, opening your windows at night,
or using an air purifier if you live in a polluted environment.
Eat and Drink for Sleepy Times
By avoiding stimulants and increasing foods that contribute to good
sleep, you can help your body start yawning. Consider this advice:
 Try to eliminate caffeine from your diet or at least limit the
amount and have it only early in the day. Coffee, tea, sodas,
and chocolate may have caffeine.
 Stop smoking. Nicotine (in cigarettes) is a stimulant.
 Make sure that your diet includes enough carbohydrates, cal-
cium, and magnesium (which help you sleep). Tryptophan, an
amino acid in milk, also helps induce sleep, so try drinking a
glass of cold milk (or a mug of hot milk) near bedtime.
 Avoid eating large meals late at night. Eat an early dinner, and
make lunch your biggest meal of the day.
Take Naps
Naps are the holy grail for some people with hep C. If you’re dealing
with fatigue and low energy, you may absolutely need your naps.
On the other hand, some people think that naps can lead to lack of
sleepiness at night. Try to have your naps earlier in the day, and
don’t nap for hours and hours if you find that doing so disturbs
your nighttime sleep.
Sleep on a Schedule
Establish a regular schedule for going to bed and waking up each
day. Prepare for your “sleep date” by getting ready in advance and
starting to relax. At the set time, turn off the lights. Set your alarm
to wake you at a preset time in the morning. For some people, a
routine helps them get their needed sleep.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
268

Create a Bedroom for Sleeping
People don’t live in magazines, so you may not always be able to
keep your bedroom clean, clutter-free, and cozy. But having a calm
and comfy bedroom is important if you’re having trouble sleeping:
 Make sure that your bedding is clean and comfortable. Don’t
use blankets that are too heavy, and make sure your pillows
support your neck.
 Keep the temperature just right. If you need a cooler room,
lower the heat or use air conditioning. If you’re feeling too
cold, use a hot-water bottle.
 Use your bed for sleep and sex, and nothing else. If you watch
TV or read, do it somewhere else.
 Create a quiet, dark environment for sleeping.
Relax before Bed
Set your body up for delicious sleep by setting the stage with relax-
ation. Before you go to bed, take a bath, read a relaxing book (not
an exiting book that’ll keep you up all night finishing it), or meditate
or do progressive relaxation (see Chapter 13). Avoid stimulating
television, heated conversations, or exercise just before bedtime;
these activities may keep you awake.
Try Aromatherapy
Certain scents, such as lavender, neroli, rose, sandalwood, and
chamomile, may help you to relax into a blissful sleep. Smelling
something pleasant is a soothing distraction from what keeps you
from falling asleep.
Try essential (pure) oils or fragrance oils that you can find in health
food stores. To spread (diffuse) the scent around your room, you
can use a store-bought diffuser or try one of these tips:
 Add a couple of drops of oil to a cotton ball or a mug of hot
water on your nightstand.
 Fill a spray bottle with purified or distilled water and a few
drops of scent, and spray your pillow before you go to bed.
 Use the oils (sparingly) in a bedtime bath, or use a specially
made aromatherapy pillow (with lavender flowers, for example).
Chapter 21: Ten Tips for Sleeping Well with Hepatitis C 269

Part V: The Part of Tens 
270
You can also try rubbing a body lotion/oil with your favorite scent
on your hands and arms before you go to sleep.
A little scent can go a long way. Start with a little bit; if you use too
much, it can disturb you or your sleeping partner.
Listen to Tapes
During the period while you’re getting ready to go to sleep or after
you turn off the lights, try listening to some relaxing music or tapes.
When you’re focused on the music, sounds, or words on the tape,
your mind won’t be focused on worries. Depending on what tapes
you choose to listen to, you can be diverted, amused, or uplifted.
Have you ever found yourself being soothed or sleepy while some-
one spoke to you? Although the speaker may not appreciate that
you’re drifting off while he speaks his heart out, the spoken word
can sometimes be like a lullaby. I use this method when my mind is
too busy to let me sleep.
Wear Comfortable Bedclothes
After you set the stage for sleep with a comfy bed; cool, fresh air;
nice aromatherapy scent; clean light sheets; and a dark, quiet
room, it’s time to think about what you wear to bed. Wear clothing
that isn’t tight fitting so that you can move your body with ease.
Also try wearing cotton clothing if you have night sweats, which
can happen with hepatitis C.
Waking Up Too Early
Ah, you’ve fallen asleep at last. But then you find yourself awake
while it’s still pitch-black outside, nowhere near dawn. If you
awaken and can’t get back to sleep, don’t spend too much time
tossing and turning. You can stay in bed and listen to a relaxation
tape or do some relaxation exercises. Or get out of bed and read a
book. Ideally, you’ll soon be able to return to sweet dreams.
Whether you can’t get to sleep in the first place or get back to
sleep in the middle of the night, don’t lie in bed worrying about not
getting enough sleep. You’ll only become more anxious, which will
just prevent you from being able to fall asleep!
