elcome to Microsoft PowerPoint 2003. This industry-leading program
has an abundance of tools and commands to satisfy all your presen-
tation needs. Whether you want to present important material to your 
colleagues or clients or just show off your latest travel photos, Microsoft
PowerPoint 2003 Just the Steps For Dummies has something for you.
About This Book
This book cuts all the fluff out of a computer book and takes you right to
steps to produce an effect, task, or job. The book is not linear. However, in
some cases, you might need to move around a little to understand one con-
cept before moving to another. Each series of steps is defined with headings
to simplify your task of searching for a specific item and finding similar
tasks related to a particular concept. Be certain to look back at the Table of
Contents when you aren’t certain where to find one task or another.
Whenever you want to get something done with this book, try to discipline
yourself to follow this method:
1.
Pick the task. Glance over the Table of Contents to find a category
you want to explore — something like working with pictures, which
we cover in Chapter 9.
2.
Find it fast. This is easy because the chapters are designed with coverage
of similar items within each chapter. Look over the subheadings listed
in the Table of Contents to find a specific task within a given chapter.
3.
Get it done. Mimic each step and look at the accompanying figures to
help you thoroughly understand a given task.
Why You Need This Book
Microsoft PowerPoint 2003 is one of those programs that many people need
and use, but they often know just enough to get by. What happens when 
you want to implement something you haven’t used before, like hyperlinks
or sound? Most programs today don’t come with written documentation 
Conventions used 
in this book
➟We use the ➪symbol for menu commands.
This tells you to follow the path to select a
menu command. Something like “Choose
Format➪Background” is our way of saying
“Choose Background from the Format menu.”
When you select this particular menu com-
mand, the Background dialog box opens.
➟Web site addresses appear in a monospace
font to make them easy to identify — for
example — www.dummies.com. Type 
the URL in your Web browser’s Location bar
exactly as you see the monospace type. 
➟To help clarify steps, some figures contain a
circle or callout symbol. Look carefully at each
figure to fully understand what we’re talking
about in the text.

Introduction

anymore. You’ll probably have to search through skimpy online
Help files or, worse, wade through lots of tedious narrative text
in a gigantic reference manual to find the help you need.
This book eliminates background descriptions and detailed
explanations and takes you directly to a series of steps to pro-
duce precisely what you want to do with a presentation. If you
want it simple, fast, and direct, then this is the book for you.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into four parts. The following sections
introduce each one.
Part I: Creating a Presentation
If you are fairly new to PowerPoint, the chapters in this part
get you up and running. First, you find out how to create a
presentation. After your presentation is started, we show you
how to add content from scratch, from Word, and from exist-
ing presentations. You then find the necessary steps on how to
edit and format your content to get just the look you want. We
finish this part by giving you information on working with the
various types of masters in PowerPoint.
Part II: Adding Visual Interest to Slides
After you have a basic presentation, you may want to add ele-
ments to increase visual interest. These comprehensive chapters
show you how to do just that. You find out how to add and edit
simple graphics like shapes, lines, and arrows. You then find
steps on how to add shadows and 3-D effects to those shapes
and also to text. If that isn’t enough, you discover how to jazz
up your text by using the WordArt feature. We also give you all
the steps you need to know on how to apply color, texture, and
pattern to your slide elements. Pictures score big with
added visual punch. We show you how to bring in both
clip art and photos to your presentations. Finally, we round
out this part by giving you all you need to create and fully
edit tables, graphs, organizational charts, and diagrams.
Part III: Adding a Dash of Pizzazz with Multimedia
If text, shapes, and pictures aren’t enough for you, you may
want to explore using sound, movies, and animation in
your presentations. It isn’t nearly as complicated as you
might think. We give you the steps to insert sound and
movie files from various sources. You also find out how to
use hyperlinks to jump to other slides and presentations or
to a Web site. To make your presentation flow smoothly,
we show you how to implement transitions between your
slides. And lastly, to make your presentation really come
alive, you find steps on animating slides, objects, and text.
Part IV: Presenting Effectively
When your presentation is ready, we show you how to pre-
pare and share it with the world. You find important infor-
mation on setting up your show options for optimum
performance. We give you the steps on printing your slides,
handouts, and notes for your audience. You find out how
to package your presentation on CD and how to hold an
online presentation meeting. Finally, you discover how to
give a presentation live, via a kiosk, or over the Web.

Glance over the Table of Contents to locate the task you
want to perform in Microsoft PowerPoint. You don’t need
to grasp any background information; just jump into the
series of steps that defines a solution for a project you
want to complete.

Getting Started
with PowerPoint
T
he first step of any journey through Microsoft PowerPoint is to start up
the program and either a) create a new presentation or b) open an exist-
ing presentation. Obviously, you can’t do anything in PowerPoint until you
launch the program.
In this chapter, we talk about some methods you can use to launch
PowerPoint and how you can immediately begin to create a new presenta-
tion. We also show you how to save a presentation after you’ve created it
and safely exit the program.
Note that, at this point, we assume you have installed either the entire
Microsoft Office 2003 suite or just Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003. If you
need to perform an installation, refer to the user documentation accompa-
nying your installer CD for installation instructions.

Customizing
the PowerPoint
Interface
P
owerPoint offers you much flexibility in customizing your work envi-
ronment to suit your own personal editing needs. You can organize
toolbars, open frequently used toolbars, add commands to toolbars, and
work with expanded or shortened menus. All these options are available for
you to create a work environment that accommodates your slide creation
needs.
In addition to customizing the PowerPoint interface, we tossed in a little
information on accessing help documents. After you get a handle on creat-
ing a blank presentation — the stuff we discuss in Chapter 1 — things can
get a little complicated. Fortunately, PowerPoint offers you help every step
along the way as you create your presentations.

Building Your
Presentation and
Adding Content
A
n outliner, among other things, makes PowerPoint the ideal presenta-
tion program. By importing text from a Microsoft Word document or
typing text directly in PowerPoint in outline form, you can quickly apply text
to slides when preparing a presentation. You can select a design template,
type an outline, and finish your presentation within record time. When 
modifying a presentation is necessary, PowerPoint provides you options for
rearranging slides, text on slides, and slide designs without spending time 
creating new documents. 
In this chapter, you find out how to use PowerPoint’s outliner feature,
assemble some quick and easy presentations, and modify your presentation
designs.

Working with Masters
Master slides provide you options for globally changing the design of your
presentations. With a quick reorganization and formatting for text — or a
change in the graphic images on a master slide — you can apply changes to
all slides in your presentation in a matter of minutes. 
PowerPoint provides you with four different master slides. The title master
and slide master affect the design of your presentation. The note master and
handout master handle the designs for notes and handouts.
In this chapter, you find out how to edit and change all master slides and
apply the changes to your presentation.

If a picture is what you want to communicate a message, then PowerPoint’s
drawing options are your ticket to creating graphic representations of ideas
and concepts. Using drawing tools and autoshapes, you can create visual
messages utilizing free form drawing tools and predefined shapes. 
With the ease of drawing lines and geometric shapes or selecting graphic
objects from a number of different palettes, you can quickly assemble a dia-
gram or drawing to illustrate your point. In this chapter you learn how to
use the many different tools in PowerPoint to create graphic objects and
images.

Using Color, Texture,
and Pattern
C
olor is an important element in communication. Each color has an
inherent “personality” and can evoke emotion and action. Certain col-
ors also have been historically associated with certain products, industries,
and even messages. The colors you choose and the way you combine colors
can have an effect on your presentation and the way it is perceived by your
audience. You want to ensure that your color choices are never arbitrary but,
instead, are well-thought-out.
Fortunately, PowerPoint makes choosing and using color simple. If you’re
not particularly color savvy, you can rest assured that PowerPoint’s prede-
fined color schemes are well designed. If you’re feeling more creative, defin-
ing your own colors is easy. And if you decide color isn’t enough, you also
have the ability to add textures and patterns to your background and graphic
elements. This chapter gives you the know-how to work with all three.

Working with Pictures
T
he old adage, “A picture is worth a thousand words,” is certainly true
when it comes to presentations. Visually conveying information with
images rather than words is often quicker, has more impact, and is more
interesting.
Working with pictures in PowerPoint is easy. You can import a variety of file
types by using a variety of methods. You can import scanned TIFFs from your
scanner or import JPEGS from your digital camera. If you don’t have access to
either of these devices, you can import clip art and photographs from stock
agencies. Or just use the multitude of art available within PowerPoint’s
libraries, which include 140,000 pieces of clip art, photos, animations, and
sounds. After you have a picture, you can easily modify its size, position, and
even contrast and color to suit your needs. This chapter gives you all the
information necessary to work with pictures of all sorts.

Insert a Picture from Clip Art
1.
Open a presentation in PowerPoint.
2.
Choose Insert➪Picture➪Clip Art to open the Clip Art
task pane. You can also click the Insert Clip Art icon on
the Drawing toolbar.
3.
In the Search For box, enter a keyword that describes the
art you are looking for. 
4.
In the Search In box, select the collections from the
drop-down list that you want PowerPoint to search in for
your art. You can choose Everywhere (all collections), My
Collections (clips you have stored on your hard drive),
Office Collections (clips that are part of the Office suite),
and Web Collections (clips located on the Web).
5.
In the Results Should Be box, select your desired media
type from the drop-down list. Choose from Clip Art,
Photographs, Movies, and Sounds. For specific file 
formats under each media type, click the plus sign to
expand the directory.
6.
Click the Go button.
7.
In the Results box, click the thumbnail of your desired
clip. It will then be inserted into your slide, as shown in
Figure 9-1. To find similar clips (if the clip has a defined
style), click the downward-pointing arrow on the right
of the clip and select Find Similar Style from the pop-up
list. Note that you can also insert, copy, or delete clips
from this pop-up list.
Figure 9-1: Insert clip art into your slide 
For search keywords, you can also enter all or part of the file name of
the art. If you don’t know the exact name, you can use a question mark
to substitute for a single character in a name or use an asterisk to sub-
stitute for multiple characters in the name. If you type two words, such
as yellow leaves, in the Search For box, PowerPoint will search for
clips using the keywords yellow and leaves. If you type in two words
enclosed by quotation marks, such as “yellow leaves”, the program
will search for clips that contain the phrase yellow leaves. And if you
type in two words separated by a comma, such as yellow, leaves,
PowerPoint will search for clips with the keywords yellow or leaves.
The Clip Organizer holds your clips. Clips include clip art, photos, sounds,
and videos. In addition to the Office clips that automatically reside in the
Clip Organizer, you can access Office clips on the Web. You can also
import and store your own clips in the Clip Organizer. Use this powerful
tool to organize, find, and insert your clips.

Embedded pictures become part of the presentation file. They do not
change within the presentation file even if the picture is changed in
its source program. Linked pictures do not become part of the pres-
entation. The presentation only stores the location for the link and
displays a proxy (a representation) of the picture. The picture will
change within the presentation if it is modified in its source program.

Creating Tables 
and Graphs
D
ata is often grasped more quickly and with more understanding and
impact when it’s presented in a simple, organized, and visual way. In
PowerPoint, tables and graphs are a couple of ways to more effectively pres-
ent data, especially quantitative, complex, or tedious data. This chapter
describes the powerful options within PowerPoint to work with graphs and
tables. Tables and graphs can be created from scratch within PowerPoint or
imported from Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel.
After your data has been entered into a table or graph, PowerPoint provides
the ability to modify virtually all the elements, from modifying a table’s
font, columns and rows, borders, and shading to adding fill effects. You can
even insert your favorite picture in a table cell. If you’ve created one of the
many types of graphs, PowerPoint provides the ability to alter almost all the
graph objects by modifying a graph’s type, font, axis, grid, borders, shading,
labels, legend, and fill effects.

Creating
Organizational Charts
and Diagrams
S
ometimes, trying to figure out who reports to whom and who is respon-
sible for what area can be downright confusing. This is especially true
for large corporations with multiple divisions, locations, and product lines.
Rather than using running lists of people’s names, titles, and responsibilities,
it’s more effective to use organizational charts. Org charts, as they are called
in corporate circles, graphically display how a corporate hierarchy is struc-
tured. Viewers can quickly see how the company is organized — either by
personnel, by function, by product, or by location. Not the corporate type?
Well, organizational-type charts can also be used to display family trees, bio-
logical classifications, and other types of hierarchical information. Similarly,
diagrams also offer a visual solution to presenting complicated data, espe-
cially data such as processes, workflow, relationships, and causes and effects.
Like tables and graphs, organization charts and diagrams provide important
but complex and sometimes tedious information visually, making it easier
and quicker for the viewer to comprehend. This chapter covers all of the
tools and methods you need to create both effective and attractive org charts
and diagrams.

Create a Default Organization Chart
1.
Open a presentation in PowerPoint.
2.
Choose Insert➪Picture➪Organization Chart. PowerPoint
creates a chart with one top-level box and three subordi-
nate boxes. The Organization Chart toolbar also appears,
as shown in Figure 11-1.
3.
Click each box (which are actually AutoShapes) and
type your desired text.
4.
To add additional boxes, select an existing box and click
the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Insert
Shape command on the Organization Chart toolbar.
5.
From the submenu, choose the relationship of the new
box — Subordinate, Coworker, or Assistant. (The small
icon to the left of the box type visually displays the 
relationship that will be created.) Briefly, choosing
Subordinate adds a box below your box, choosing
Coworker adds a box at the same level, and choosing
Assistant adds a box between the current box and 
any Subordinate boxes. Note that if you want a
Subordinate box, you can just click the Insert Shape 
button itself.
6.
To delete a box, click its border and press Delete. Continue
adding boxes and text as desired (see Figure 11-2).
Lots of other organization chart templates are available from
Microsoft Office Online. Choose View➪Task Pane. Click the down-
ward-pointing arrow and choose Select Results. Type organization
chart in the Search field. When the results appear, select your desired
template and click Download. The template will appear on your slide.

2.
To modify the overall layout of the organization chart,
select the chart and click the downward-pointing arrow
to the right of the Layout command on the
Organization Chart toolbar.
3.
From the submenu, shown in Figure 11-4, choose your
desired layout type. The small icon to the left of the type
visually displays the layout. Select how you want the
boxes to hang from one another. Note that PowerPoint
may first ask you to select a manager shape before it 
will change the layout. If that is the case, select one of
your manager or topmost boxes and then choose your
layout type.
The AutoLayout command maintains the positions and sizes of the
boxes in your organization chart. This prevents the chart from arbi-
trarily being changed.

To move multiple boxes not on the same branch or
level, press the Ctrl key as you click on each box. Drag
any one of the boxes by the border and drop them onto
another box.
4.
To move an entire level or branch of an org chart, select
any box within either the level or branch you want to
move. On the Organization Chart toolbar, choose Select
and then either Level or Branch. Drag the manager or
topmost box (all subordinates will follow) to a new
location within the chart. Note that you can also select
All Connecting Lines and All Assistants from the Select
menu. This enables you to change the attributes of all of
the connecting lines or assistant boxes (for example,
stroke width or color). See Step 6.
5.
To change the font, size, style, effect, or color of the text
in a box, simply highlight it and choose Format➪Font.
Make your desired changes in the Font dialog box and
click OK.

Integrating Sound
and Movies
I
f photos and illustrations add icing to your presentations, then sound
and movies are the proverbial cherry on top. You can really grab the
attention of your audience with the addition of audio and video elements to
your presentation. What’s great is that it’s easy to do. A couple of menu
commands are all it takes to integrate sound and movies into your slide
show.
If you’re short on content, PowerPoint offers quite a few media clips in its
library. Music can also be imported from your own CDs or from MP3 files
you have created or purchased online. Many stock photo Web sites also offer
reasonably priced audio and video clips. In addition to video, you can add
animated GIFs to your presentations. Animated GIFs have small file sizes
and can be very effective in demonstrating a sequence.
This chapter gives you the scoop on how to integrate sound and movies into
your presentations and really bring them to life.

RSRC, ALAW, AU, SND, and ULAW.
Note that some sound file formats, like MP3 and MIDI and larger
sound files, may not be embedded in your presentation but are
instead linked to your presentation. So be sure to include these
links with your presentation by saving it as a PowerPoint Package.

You might think a basic office program such as PowerPoint is incapable of
adding any snap, crackle, and pop to your presentations. Think again.
Underneath PowerPoint’s conservative attire lies a whole bevy of special
effects that you can apply to your slides. If you need to jump to a Web site
or to another file or presentation during your slide show, you simply insert a
hyperlink. Advancing from one slide to the next can be elegant and unobtru-
sive with slow fades, or dynamic and active with wipes and spins. With this
chapter’s help, your presentations will be snapping, crackling, and popping
to their heart’s content!

Transitions are effects used to advance from one slide to the next.
Although transitions are fun, be careful about using too many dif-
ferent kinds of transitions. You want your audience to pay attention
to your content, not be distracted by your special effects, or worse,
get motion sickness.

Incorporate Animation
I
f the previous chapter on hyperlinks and transitions didn’t add enough
pizzazz to your presentations, you may want to step it up a bit and
employ custom animations to the elements on your slides. You can easily
have your text fly in from the left and then dim or change color after it has
played. Or you can create a custom motion path and have your object fol-
low a map on your slide. If motion isn’t enough, you can easily attach
sounds, such as camera clicks or voltage zaps, to your animations. 
This chapter shows you how to employ animation for added emphasis and
impact in your presentations.

Preparing the
Presentation
A
fter you’ve done all the hard work of compiling and formatting the
content of your presentation, it’s time to get it ready to share with the
world. Begin by specifying the display options for your show. Determine
how your show will be presented. Will a speaker control it, or will it be self-
running on a kiosk? Choose whether your show will loop continuously and
whether it will include narration and animation. Establish your timings and
optimize your display performance.
When your show is ready to go, print your outline and all your notes and
handouts. And last but not least, be sure to make a backup of your hard-
earned presentation by packaging it to a CD. You want to be prepared if
your original presentation stored on the computer’s hard drive goes awry.

Click the Options button to specify additional settings
in the Options dialog box, shown in Figure 15-17: 
• Specify whether to include the PowerPoint Viewer.
The Viewer enables your presentation to play without
using the PowerPoint application.
• Specify how the presentations will play by selecting
an option from the drop-down list. For example, you
can enable the user to select the presentation she
wants to view.
• Choose whether to embed TrueType fonts. Note that
fonts that have built-in copyright protections won’t
be embedded.
• To add a password requirement for opening or 
modifying the presentation, type your password in
the corresponding field. Note that if any of the pack-
aged files already have passwords (for example, PDF
[Portable Document Format] files), PowerPoint asks
you whether you want to keep those passwords or
override them.

9.
Click Copy to CD.
Note that the Package for CD command works only for Windows XP
or later. For other operating systems, you can use the command only
to copy your files to a folder. You cannot copy them directly to a CD.
To burn the files onto a CD, use your default CD burning application.

Optimize Slide Show Performance
1.
Open a presentation in PowerPoint.
2.
Choose Slide Show➪Set Up Show to open the Set Up
Show dialog box.
3.
Under Performance, select the Use Hardware Graphics
Acceleration check box, shown in Figure 15-18. If your
graphics card supports this option, PowerPoint will
implement it.
4.
Under Performance, select 640 x 480 from the Slide
Show Resolution drop-down list. Note that although
this setting yields the fastest performance, it also yields
the lowest fidelity, or quality. Click OK.
5.
Choose Slide Show➪View Show to view your show 
with the edited settings. If you see any problems, go
back to the default settings. 
Click the Tips button to get further information on how to improve
slide show performance.
Another thing you can do to improve the performance of the slide show is
to work with your animations. Try reducing the size or your animated pic-
tures. Also try to limit your use of animations that fade, rotate, or change
size. Finally, limit your use of animated objects that include gradients or
transparency.

Sharing Your
Presentation
W
hat good is a wonderful presentation if you don’t share it with the
world? PowerPoint offers you many ways to share. You can take the
traditional and most personal route and present the show yourself (or
choose a designated live body). If you’re short on manpower or want to free
up people for other tasks, you can present a self-running show. If you need
feedback on a presentation, PowerPoint has a great system of sending a pres-
entation out for review. Need to collaborate? PowerPoint also provides a
way, with the help of Microsoft NetMeeting, to hold online meetings.
Finally, you can take the more technical route and share your presentation
online via the Internet. This is a great way to disseminate information to a
large audience or to people who are located in geographically diverse loca-
tions. This chapter gives you all you need to know to finalize your show and
then share it with others.

Create a Custom Show
1.
Open a presentation in PowerPoint.
2.
Choose Slide Show➪Custom Shows.
3.
In the Custom Shows dialog box, shown in Figure 16-1,
click New.
4.
In the Define Custom Show dialog box, shown in Figure
16-2, select the slides you want to include in the custom
show. Click Add.
5.
If you need to change the order of the slides, click on
the slide you want to move to select it and then click the
up or down arrow buttons on the right. 
6.
Give your custom show a name and click OK. 
7.
Click Close to close the Custom Shows dialog box. Click
Show to see a preview of the show. Note that you can
also edit, remove, or copy your custom show by clicking
the appropriate button on the right.
A custom show is simply a grouping of slides within your presenta-
tion that you can present separately from your main presentation
or that you can hyperlink to. This can come in handy if you need to
make presentations to several different groups within an organiza-
tion. For example, everyone might need to view the main presen-
tation, but you can create custom shows to present to individual
groups who have slightly different needs.
Figure 16-1: Create a custom show
Figure 16-2: Select the slides to include in your custom show
To present a custom show, choose Slide Show➪Set Up Show. Under Show
slides, select Custom Show and select your desired show from the drop-
down list. Click OK. Then simply choose Slide Show➪View Show.
For details on hyperlinking to your custom show, see Chapter 13.

Chapter 16: Sharing Your Presentation

Prepare a Self-Directed Show
1.
Open the presentation in PowerPoint. You can simply
choose Slide Show➪View Show or click the Slide Show
button in the bottom-left corner of the application win-
dow. If you want to specify further options, proceed to
Step 2.
2.
Choose Slide Show➪Set Up Show.
3.
In the Set Up Show dialog box, as shown in Figure 16-3,
choose the Presented by a Speaker (Full Screen) option.
Specify your other options:
• Show Options: Select the Loop Continuously until
‘Esc’ option to enable the show to repeat continu-
ously until you press Esc. This is usually selected
when preparing a show for a kiosk. Choose whether
to run the show with narration and animation. 
• Pen color: Select your desired pen color from the
drop-down list. You can make notes on your slides
during a presentation (see the Tip following this step
list).
• Show Slides: By default, PowerPoint displays all the
slides in the show. You can also specify a range of
slides, if desired, by clicking the up and down arrows.
If your presentation contains a custom show, you may
also select it from the Custom Show drop-down list.
• Advance Slides: See Chapter 15 for more details.
• Multiple Monitors: You can run your presentation
on more than one monitor. See the section “Use Two
Monitors to Run a Presentation,” later in this chapter.
• Performance: See the section on optimizing slide
show performance in Chapter 15 for details.
You can write on your slides during a presentation by using the PowerPoint
pen. During your slide show, right-click and choose Pointer Option from
the contextual menu. Select a pen type from the submenu. Press and drag
your mouse to create a pen mark, as shown in Figure 16-4.

Prepare a Self-Directed Show

Use a Laptop and Projector 
to Run Your Show
1.
Using the cable that shipped with the projector, connect
the external display port on the laptop to the projector.
Additionally, if you’ll be using an audio cable to add
sound, connect the audio port on your laptop to the
projector. 
2.
Set the resolution of your laptop display to match that
of the projector. In Windows, choose Start➪Settings➪
Control Panel. In the Control Panel window, click
Display.
3.
In the Display Properties dialog box, click the Settings
tab. In the Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 16-5, set
your desired resolution under Screen Resolution. If you
are unsure what resolution to use, set it to 800 x 600
pixels.
4.
Click OK to close the Display Properties dialog box.
Use Two Monitors to Run 
a Presentation
1.
Choose Slide Show➪Set Up Show. 
2.
In the Set Up Show dialog box, shown in Figure 16-6,
under Multiple Monitors, select the monitor you want
your slide show to appear on.
3.
Select the Show Presenter View check box to enable you
to run your presentation in presenter mode.
4.
Click OK to close the Display Properties dialog box.
Using two monitors enables you to run your presentation from one mon-
itor while displaying your presentation to your audience on another. This
allows you to have other applications open that your audience can’t see.
You can also use presenter view, which gives you access to additional
tools in your presentation, such as showing slides out of order and black-
ing out the screen on your audience’s monitor.
