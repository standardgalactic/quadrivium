About the Author
Deanna Sclar is also the internationally best-selling author of Buying a Car 
For Dummies, a money-saving guide to every aspect of car ownership includ-
ing buying, selling, financing, auto insurance and claims, and more. A former
contributing editor to Family Circle, Boys’ Life, Exploring, and the Los Angeles
Times, her articles have appeared in Redbook, New Woman, and other
national magazines.
As an automotive expert and consumer spokesperson, Deanna has appeared
on more than 800 radio and TV shows, including her own segment on NBC
Nightly News with Tom Brokaw; Good Morning America, Today; the Lifetime,
CNN, and National Public Radio networks; and local shows in 30 major cities.
Her Auto Repair For Dummies video was a National Home Video Awards final-
ist. She’s co-hosted Outrageous Women, a weekly TV talk show, and has pro-
duced, written, hosted, and edited several documentaries. Her “Auto Repair
for Dummies” course at California State University, Northridge, drew the
largest crowds ever in their continuing education program.
A life-long environmental activist, Deanna led the group that threw the first
Earth Day celebration in New York City and convinced Mayor Lindsay to start
the first urban recycling program. The former “Thumbs Sclar” has restored
two classic cars, a truck, and three homes. An inveterate gypsy and blue-
water sailor, she has crewed her way across the Pacific and Polynesia, sailed
and dived Hawaii and the Great Barrier Reef, trekked alone for nine months
through southeast Asia and five months through Brazil, and crossed the
Atlantic in a small sailboat with a companion and a cat.
“My goal is to prove that we have control over our lives,” she says. “Whether
you are working on a car or making a lifelong dream come true, it’s a do-it-
yourself world. Knowing this has turned my life into a great adventure, and 
I want to pass the good news on to everybody else!”


Dedication
For my children, Gina and Casey; and my grandchildren, Jesse, Allison, Jacob,
and Kylie, who will drive the vehicles of the future.

What’s So Special about Auto Repair
For Dummies, 2nd Edition
This book is designed for people who think that anything technical will make
their brains shut like garage doors, who sincerely care about how their vehicles
affect the environment, and although they believe they can’t work on their cars
themselves — and wouldn’t like it if they could — are willing to give it a try.
How do I know that it will work for these reluctant readers? Because it’s written
by a genuine, certified ex-Dummy who has found that, despite total ignorance
and a complete lack of manual dexterity, getting personally involved with a
vehicle is enjoyable, rewarding, and easy. Believe me: If I can do it, so can you!
It Is Not Written for Confirmed “Do-It-Yourselfers.” It Is for You If:
 You have never held a wrench.
 You are positive that, in your case, manual labor can lead only to disaster.
 You haven’t the vaguest idea of how a car works.
 You have failed shop or arts and crafts.
 You believe that if you do something wrong, your car can blow up.
To Enjoy This Book, It Would Help If:
 You don’t believe that working on your vehicle can possibly be fun, but
you’re willing to give it a try for any reason whatsoever.
 You are sincerely tired of being ripped off because of your own ignorance.
Why Is That Enjoyable? Because You Will Be Delighted to Find:
 Cars run on principles that are as easy to understand as common sense.
 You can save a tremendous amount of money, extend the life of your
vehicle, save on fuel, and do your bit for the environment if you know
more about your car!
 Most of the devices on your vehicle will not hurt you unless you really
go out of your way to hurt yourself.
Here’s How Auto Repair For Dummies Accomplishes These Miracles:
 It starts from scratch. It even shows you what a screwdriver looks like!
 It explains each system in simple terms before you get to work on it.
 It provides step-by-step instructions for even the simplest tasks.
 It tells you exactly what you need and how to know if you’ve been given
the wrong part, the wrong diagnosis, or an outrageous estimate.

It Tells You the Truth About:
 What makes your vehicle go (and how and why as well)
 How the car you drive, how you drive it and maintain it, and how you
recycle or dispose of used parts and toxic fluids affect fuel economy and
global warming
 The easy work involved in keeping your vehicle well maintained and 
running efficiently, and how to tell what’s wrong if trouble strikes
 How 15 minutes of “preventive medicine” avoids breakdowns
 Whether you can handle a problem yourself, and how to get it fixed at a
fair price if you can’t
 How to extend the life of your vehicle; keep it clean and healthy; and
repair the minor dents and dings it acquires on the road
These Features Will Make Life Even Easier:
 A Practical Glossary of Automotive Terms that are in special type through-
out the book so that you can refresh your memory if you’ve forgotten
what something means
 A detailed Index where you can look up a part, a problem, a symptom, or
a specific job and find the page you need
 A Maintenance Record so you can keep track of what you’ve done and
when you did it
 A Specifications Record for the data you need to buy the right parts
 Tons of illustrations that show you how things look and where they are
This Revised Edition Also Tells You:
 About alternatively fueled vehicles and other innovations so you can
choose a safe and efficient vehicle when Old Faithful finally heads for the
Used Car Lot in the Sky
You Have a Few Things to Supply, Too!
 You have to buy the book . . . and read it!
 You have to try to do one small, easy job yourself (you can pick the job).
There Are Fringe Benefits, Too!
 Your vehicle will run better and live longer.
 Automotive technicians will respect you.
 You’ll have more money to spend on other things.
 You’ll no longer be a Dummy!

Introduction
F
or many people, getting a driver’s license is an event that runs second only
to getting a diploma or a marriage license. Most of us succeed in passing
the test and hop happily into our vehicles, headed for the freedom of the open
road. Unfortunately, most of us don’t know the first thing about the machines
we’re licensed to drive — and this can turn a ticket to freedom into a ticket to
trouble.
I’m not necessarily talking about physical danger. State motor vehicle
bureaus have made fairly sure that, before we can get a driver’s license, we
know how to drive defensively and can handle a vehicle under poor driving
conditions. What I’m referring to is the kind of trouble that comes from
depending on other people to care for and repair our vehicles. If you’re like
most people, you probably tend to drive around until something goes wrong
and then incur the expense of replacing worn and burned-out parts — or the
entire vehicle! — when low-cost, regular maintenance could have kept your
wheels turning for a long time.
Whether you’re trying to cut expenses, are tired of being patronized, or have
just fallen in love with your first car, this book tells you how your vehicle
works, what it needs in the way of tender loving care, how to reduce its
impact on the environment, and how to keep from getting ripped off if you
have to entrust repairs to someone else. By handling the simple maintenance
and being able to diagnose trouble and perform the less complex repairs your-
self, you’ll earn the respect of your family, your mechanic, and your car — and
you’ll feel pretty good about it!
About This Book
This new edition is about much more than auto repair. In this book, I intro-
duce you to the wonders of the internal combustion engine and to the even
more wondrous alternative fuels and alternatively fueled vehicles that reduce
dependence on the rapidly dwindling supply of fossil fuel and will play a huge
role in the battle against global warming that threatens the future of the
planet. I’m proud to say that this edition of Auto Repair For Dummies is the
first “green” automotive guide that focuses on how the vehicles you choose;
the way you maintain them; and how you recycle used oil, parts you’ve
replaced, and other waste products directly affects the environment. 
The book starts off with the basics every driver should know, from how to get
the hood open and fill up with fuel, to using a jack and changing a tire safely.

You learn the basic safety rules to follow when dealing with your vehicle, and
how to take anything apart and reassemble it without losing anything, includ-
ing your mind! After identifying the basic tools you may need, I gently lead
you into an easy preventive maintenance check-up that you can do to extend
the life of your vehicle and keep it from breaking down on the road.
Next, there’s a quick overview of how your vehicle’s principal systems work
together to start it, operate it efficiently on the road, and bring it safely to a
stop. After you have a general idea of how things work, we explore each
system, part by part, and what needs to be done to maintain it, troubleshoot
it, and do minor repairs yourself. Don’t worry about getting in over your
head. If a repair can get you into trouble if you attempt to do it yourself, I tell
you how to be sure the work is done properly by a professional at a fair price.
So don’t chicken out on me! Start with the easy stuff and then take on the
more challenging tasks.
How I Became Intimately Involved with
My Car, and Why You Should Too
Before I moved to California, I was an ordinary urban cliff dweller: I had only
a nodding acquaintance with cars. Ours was locked up in a garage, and I used
subways, buses, and taxis. All the maintenance on our car was done by the
garage that housed it. When we moved to California, my enthusiasm for a life
in the sun was considerably dampened by the knowledge that this would also
include a life on the freeways, but the first time I took the family car to the
supermarket myself I had an epiphany in the parking lot: I could drive any-
where I wanted to, instead of just being driven home. It wasn’t long before I
was looking for a car of my own.
The best I could do was a secondhand Mustang with more than 70,000 miles on
it. A friend of mine checked out the car and pronounced it drivable. He said
that it might need “a little work.” We took it to a reliable mechanic, who
checked it over, tuned it up, and told me that it was “a classic.”
Thus reassured, I drove the car to the Department of Motor Vehicles to regis-
ter it. I parked the car, turned off the ignition, locked it, and found that the
car was singing! A bit puzzled, I rechecked the ignition and the radio, but
everything was truly shut off. And still the car sang. By the time I returned, all
was quiet. But that night, when I took the family out to dinner, old Tweety
Bird began to sing again. After several weeks of expensive and unsuccessful
repairs, I found out that all she had needed was an inexpensive radiator cap.
To my amazement, the shop was unwilling to refund the money I’d spent on
all the other stuff they’d tried! I realized that it would be impossible to com-
municate with Tweety properly if I didn’t know anything about her, and the
repair bills were going to send both of us down the drain.
2
Auto Repair For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

So I conned a friend of mine into taking an auto shop class with me at a local
adult-ed center. Instead of a bewildering array of weird objects and miles of
hoses that threatened to blow up if I turned a screw in the wrong direction, I
soon found that a car was just a series of simple mechanisms linked together
and that vehicles are very good about sending out signals telling you clearly
what’s wrong — if you know how to hear, see, smell, or feel them.
Before long, it was no longer enough to be able to communicate with a
mechanic; I wanted to be the mechanic myself whenever possible. Not only
did I save money, but Tweety began running better, and I found that not only
was I saving money and fuel, I was having fun!
Today, vehicles are more complex because computers control many systems
and even professional mechanics need specialized equipment to deal with
them. The upside is that these vehicles usually need fewer repairs, and there
are much greater intervals between basic maintenance tasks, most of which
are still easily done yourself. The same goes for making a variety of minor
repairs and adjustments.
Unlike professional mechanics, when you do the troubleshooting (that’s
CarSpeak for diagnosing a problem by analyzing the symptoms), you can try
the cheaper solutions first. For example, if your engine has been overheating
constantly, you check the radiator cap and the coolant level, look for leaks in
the hoses, and check the thermostat before paying for a new water pump. If
it’s the cap, a hose, or the thermostat, you may be able to easily replace it
yourself, and the money you’ll save is well worth the effort. If it finally comes
down to changing the water pump, you can ask the mechanic about installing
a good rebuilt pump instead of an expensive new one.
With this book as your guide to how cars work, you may discover that your
vehicle stops being a mystery and begins to be fun to hang around with.
When you realize that a vehicle exhibits most of the symptoms of life — 
it’s self-propelled, reacts to outside stimuli, consumes fuel and discharges
wastes, and even manages to sing a little tune now and then — it’s really 
hard not to respond to it as though it were another living thing.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make things con-
sistent and easy to understand:
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in
the glossary in Appendix A.
 Italic is used to note technical terms that aren’t defined in the glossary.
3
Introduction

 Bold is used to highlight the action parts of numbered steps as well as
key information in lists.
 Sidebars are the shaded boxes that appear here and there. They contain
information that’s interesting and insightful and that may help you out in
your auto repair adventures. However, you won’t be at a serious disadvan-
tage if you stick to the regular text and save the sidebars to read later on.
How I Picture You
In order to make this book as relevant, readable, and enjoyable as possible, 
I envision it as a friendly conversation with the kind of person I feel would
want to read it. Here’s my mental portrait of my readers:
 You’re intelligent and may know a great deal about a lot of things (law,
business, literature, medicine, and other nonautomotive subjects), but
you need some help when it comes to cars.
 You’re tired of living as a “closet dummy” who nods and smiles at the
incomprehensible mutterings of your mechanic, only to end up shelling
out money for repairs that you neither fully understand nor always need.
 You’ve decided that it simply isn’t worth the extra money to have other
people do things for you that you can do yourself.
 You’re tired of other people assuming (especially if you’re a teenager, a
senior, or a woman) that you aren’t capable of handling repairs yourself.
 You want to keep a good vehicle in good condition without paying dearly
to have someone else do the simple maintenance, or you want to keep
your old heap running just a little longer without spending a lot of
money on it.
 You want to maintain your vehicle without devoting every weekend,
weeknight, and spare lunch hour to poring over the intricacies, details,
and mysteries of the internal combustion engine.
 You’ve realized (I hope!) that a vehicle that runs inefficiently because it’s
poorly maintained or is running on fossil fuel pollutes the environment,
and you want to do something to turn that around.
How This Book Is Organized
Basically, this book covers everything you need to know to understand, care
for, maintain, and troubleshoot your vehicle, or choose a new, more efficient,
and safer one. You’ll be relieved to know that I explain everything in everyday
terms, with no jargon, no unnecessary technical details, and lots of simple
illustrations.
4
Auto Repair For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

To help you find information easily, this book is divided into seven parts,
each containing chapters that deal with a particular topic. Because the key to
doing any job is to understand what you’re working on and how it functions, 
I strongly recommend that you read the chapter that deals with the system
you want to work on before you head for the chapter that tells you how to do
a specific job. The following sections describe the information that you can
find in each part.
Part I: Getting to Know Your Vehicle
If you want the basics, this is the part for you. I cover things that everyone
who drives should know, like how to decide whether you want to do a job
yourself, how to get the hood open, how to use a jack and change a tire, and
how to take anything apart and put it back together again. A monthly under-
the-hood check that can prevent 70 percent of highway breakdowns will
transform you from an “I-can’t-do-it-myselfer” into a hands-on mechanic. I
also describe the tools that you’ll need to borrow or buy if you plan to do reg-
ular maintenance and simple repairs. Finally, a quick and simple run-through
of how basic automotive systems work together gives you the confidence to
explore further because what was once a mystery is now familiar territory.
Part II: Powering Up with Air, 
Fuel, and Fire
This part provides a closer look at the electrical and fuel systems in vehicles
with internal combustion engines and tells you how to do simple jobs related
to each one. If you own or would like to own an alternatively fueled vehicle,
you’ll find information on how diesel, hybrid, multifuel, natural gas, and
hydrogen vehicles work; descriptions of a variety of alternative fuels; and the
advantages and disadvantages of each.
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control
This part deals with the cooling system, how oil benefits your vehicle, and
how the brake system works. You find out how to prevent and deal with
chronic overheating, add and change coolant, find and repair leaks, change
your oil, check and maintain your brakes, pack wheel bearings, and do a vari-
ety of other vital tasks.
5
Introduction

Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and
Suspension, Tires and Transmissions
How comfortably and efficiently a vehicle operates is hugely influenced by the
systems covered in this part of the book. This part tells you how all these sys-
tems operate and shows you how to choose the right tires, read the wealth of
information on the sidewalls and the treads to prevent tires from wearing out
prematurely, about balancing and alignment, and how to fill tires with the
proper amount of air. The chapters on transmissions explain how they work,
how to troubleshoot symptoms, and how to obtain the best deal on repairs,
along with driving techniques that will extend the life of your transmission.
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with
Emergencies
This part helps you deal with problems that may occur while you’re away
from home. It describes a variety of new safety systems that help children
ride comfortably and securely, prevent accidents and injuries, increase trac-
tion and stability, avoid rollovers, and even call for help without your assis-
tance when your car is disabled or stolen. It shows you how to decipher such
symptoms as weird noises, smoke, smells, and leaks to determine what’s
wrong; I also share what to do to get off the road safely, jump a start, and cool
things down if your car overheats in traffic.
If a job is just too hairy to deal with yourself, I tell you how to find a reliable
service facility and establish a good relationship with it, describe a problem
so a mechanic can diagnose it swiftly and accurately, decipher a mechanic’s
invoice, and get satisfaction on complaints if, despite your best efforts, you
run into problems with anything you buy.
Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best
Because keeping a vehicle clean — inside and out — can extend its life and
value, in this part I cover washing and waxing the body, tidying up under 
the hood, cleaning the interior, and removing stains from fabric, carpeting,
windows, and other surfaces. If your vehicle has suffered minor damage, I
show you how to repair small dings, dents, and rust spots; touch up paint;
and patch or install weatherstripping instead of paying big bucks for body
shops to do it. If major work needs to be done I tell you how to choose the
right type of parts, and how to evaluate body shops and get the best deal and
highest quality work from them.
6
Auto Repair For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part VII: The Part of Tens
This part can save you money, time, and sanity. It lists the most important
preventive maintenance you can do to keep your vehicle in good condition
and offers “eco-logical” tips for saving fuel.
Appendixes
I include two handy appendixes at the back of this book:
 The Dictionary of Acronyms and the Practical Glossary not only tell you
what automotive terms mean but give you advice about them as well.
Throughout the book, glossary terms are set in a special font to remind
you to go to the glossary when you see a word that you don’t recognize
or a term that you don’t understand.
 The handy Specifications Record makes sure that you have the numbers
of the parts you need when you go to the auto supply store, and the
Maintenance Record reminds you to get busy if you’ve let things go too
long. The Maintenance Record also provides a history of maintenance
and repair that will be an asset when it’s time to sell your vehicle or
trade it in. Each record can be photocopied (before you enter any infor-
mation on it) so you have one for every vehicle you own.
Icons Used in This Book
To make this book easier to read and simpler to use, I include some icons
that can help you find and fathom key ideas and information.
This icon points to suggestions or hints that can make a task easier, save you
money, help you avoid hassles, and otherwise make your life easier.
This icon appears beside information that you should watch out for because
it points out events or circumstances that are dangerous or can end up cost-
ing you a lot of money.
This icon was specially created for this book to alert you to the relationship
between a piece of information and its impact on the environment. The infor-
mation will help you save fuel, cut air pollution, recycle parts, and dispose of
toxic substances safely.
7
Introduction

This icon appears beside rules that you absolutely must follow if you want to
achieve success in a particular situation. There aren’t many of them, so pay
attention when you do come across them!
This icon indicates information that you may have encountered elsewhere in
the book and need to take into consideration and keep in mind.
This icon appears beside technical information that, although interesting (at
least to me), you can skip without risking anything important.
This icon appears beside real-life stories that provide a relaxing respite from
serious subjects and demonstrate what you should — or should not — do to
avoid major trouble or to triumph in difficult situations.
Where to Go from Here
You can use this book any way you want to. You can read it from cover to
cover or jump from section to section as the mood strikes you. To find a gen-
eral topic, head to the Table of Contents. If you’re looking for more specific

No matter how you use the book, I recommend that you tuck it into your
trunk compartment to keep it handy when it’s time for maintenance or if you
need to figure out what’s gone wrong on the road.
If this book turns you on to automotive systems and repair, then by all means
extend your knowledge by reading more and more sophisticated literature on
your favorite automotive topics. But there’s no substitute for hands-on expe-
rience. You won’t be able to realize any of your goals unless you stop pro-
crastinating and start working. If you’re feeling timid about actually touching
your vehicle’s inner parts, try doing something simple, like checking the oil
dipstick or changing the air filter. I hope that you find it as exhilarating as I
did, and I know that your car will love you for it. May you and your vehicle
have a long and happy life together!

Getting to Know
Your Vehicle

In this part . . .
E
ver seen someone try to figure out how to open a 
can of sardines? They have the key in one hand, the
can in the other, and they poke, prod, and pry until they
finally decide that saltines alone are fine. If you’ve ever
tried to open the hood of your vehicle or jack it up with-
out the benefit of prior experience (or paying attention
when someone else did it), you may feel as confused as
the sardine-lovers seem. That’s why this part covers the
things every driver should be able to do, safety tips that
everyone who works on cars should know, and the tools
you can use to get your vehicle running smoothly again.
You find out how to buy the right auto part on your first
trip to the store and how to do a monthly under-the-hood
check that can prevent breakdowns on the road by 
70 percent!
Finally, I take a quick trip through all the automotive 
systems involved in operating your vehicle to show you
what each one does, how it does it, and how they relate to
one another.

In This Chapter
 Knowing when to do it yourself
 Paying attention to safety
 Filling the tank yourself
 Getting under the hood
 Taking things apart (and putting them back together again)
 Jacking up a vehicle and changing a tire safely
 Getting into your car when you lock yourself out

f you’re not particularly mechanically inclined, you may watch those who
are with admiration, amazement, and exasperation because they have
something you don’t: an understanding of how things work and how things fit
together. When they take something apart, they can reassemble it the way it
was. When they say that they want to take a look under the hood, they can
actually get the darn thing open. And when they need to change a flat, they
don’t spend ten minutes trying to figure out which end of the jack is up.
The good news is that you don’t have to be born with a wrench in your hand
to know how to fix things — even things as seemingly complicated as a car. I
know; I’ve been there. The Introduction tells you all about my automotive
epiphany.
Of course, the simplest tasks can sometimes be the biggest hurdles to over-
come. After all, if you can’t even figure out how to open the hood, how can
you check the oil or the coolant level? That’s why I begin this book with the
basics: simple jobs that you’ll need to do again and again — like opening the
hood, jacking up a car, and changing a tire. I also include instructions for fill-
ing the fuel tank yourself (it’s cheaper than full-service), a surefire method for
taking anything apart and putting it back together again, and safety pointers
that every mechanic — experienced and beginner — should heed.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.

Before You Tackle Any Job
It’s wonderful to do things yourself. You spend less money, you get a sense of
power knowing that you did it on your own, and you know that the job’s been
done right. Nevertheless, to avoid getting in over my head, I always ask
myself the following questions before undertaking any job:
 Do I really want to do this? Will it be fun — or horrendous? (I try never
to do anything that doesn’t feel good unless it’s absolutely necessary.)
 Do I know how to do it? If not, where do I go to learn?
 Does it require such expensive tools that it would cost less to have
someone do it for me than to buy those tools? Can I borrow or rent the
tools I need?
 If I goof, can something be seriously damaged? Can I be hurt?
 How long will it take, and what is my time worth? From that perspective,
how much money will I save by doing it myself?
You’ll be happy to know that almost every job in this book should pass the
test of these questions. If you find a task that doesn’t, don’t hesitate to turn it
over to a professional — after you read enough to know that the job is defi-
nitely necessary, what it entails, whether the work has been done properly,
and how to get satisfaction if it isn’t. With that in mind, let’s get on to the
very first thing you need to know in order to work on your vehicle.

What the big guys taught me 
about busting things loose
If you try to remove a bolt or a spark plug and
you can’t budge it, don’t feel like a weakling. At
first I thought that I had trouble because I was
female, so I asked the biggest guys in my auto
class for help because it would have been
embarrassing if some little guy could do it. To my
amazement, I found that often the big guys
struggled, too! The difference was that they
always prevailed. What I learned from them is
that strength depends less on size or sex and
more on the way in which we’ve been taught to
focus our strength. People who are handy with
tools usually have learned to pour their strength
down their arms and into their hands, and focus
it on the tool they’re using. The guys also
showed me that the longer the handle, the more
leverage you have. And from watching them
struggle, I learned that the patience to perse-
vere comes from having the confidence that
eventually you will succeed. So now I approach
hard-to-move objects with the proper tools,
focus, and patience. It works!

Buying the right parts for your vehicle
Before you go shopping for parts to replace those on your vehicle, read the
tips in this section carefully. They can help you avoid what’s probably the
most annoying part of any automotive job: disabling your vehicle to work on
it only to find that you need it to drive back to the store to exchange the stuff
they sold you in error! Before I learned how to do it right, this happened at
least two out of every three times on every job I did.
This section tells you what you need to know when buying any part. Sections
in other chapters that deal with jobs that require buying replacement parts
provide tips on buying them as well as what tools and other stuff you need
for that task. Chapter 3 tells you how to buy specific tools and what they’re
used for.
To buy the proper parts for your vehicle, you must know its specifications
(or “specs,” as they’re often called). Most of this information should be in
your owner’s manual, and a lot of it is also printed on metal tags or decals
located inside your hood. You can usually find these in front of the radiator,
inside the fenders, on the inside of the hood — anywhere the auto manufac-
turer thinks you’ll find them. I know of one car that has its decal inside the lid
of the glove compartment. These ID tags also provide a lot of other informa-
tion about where the vehicle was made, what kind of paint it has, and so on.
The service manual for your vehicle should have the specs for the parts you
need, and the parts department at your dealership or a reputable auto supply
store can also look them up for you.
It’s a good idea to stick with parts from the same manufacturer as those that
your vehicle originally came with. That brand may be listed in a service
manual for your vehicle. If you don’t have a service manual, tell the sales
clerk at the auto parts store that you want OEM (original equipment manu-
facturer) parts. Quality aftermarket parts are available as well, but unless
you trust your parts seller’s recommendations, or you’ve already used a 
particular aftermarket brand and had good luck with it, stick with OEM parts.
If you can’t find specs for buying and gapping spark plugs in your owner’s or
service manual or on your vehicle, you’ll find them in a “Tune-Up Specification
Guide” (called a “spec sheet” for short) at an auto supply store. “Buying the
right plugs” in Chapter 6 provides a sample spec sheet and shows you how 
to use it.
I provide a Specifications Record in Appendix B. Make a copy for each vehicle
you own and record the specifications for that vehicle on it. I keep a dupli-
cate in my glove compartment so that I always have it when I shop for parts.

Chapter 1: Things Every Driver Should Know

When you go to buy parts, keep in mind that most professional mechanics
get discounts at auto parts stores. Ask if you can get a discount given that
you’re installing the parts yourself. It can’t hurt to try. Even if you don’t get a
price break on parts, you’ll still be ahead of the game because you won’t have
to pay labor charges.
Following safety rules
The first time I tuned my car, I was sure that if I made the smallest mistake,
the car would explode when I started it. This seems to be a common delu-
sion, but it just isn’t so. If you make a mistake, in most cases all you’ll get is
silence (which can be just as disconcerting, but not lethal after all). This isn’t
to say that working on a vehicle is free from danger. Before you do any work,
be sure to observe the following safety rules:
 Don’t smoke while you’re working on your car — for obvious reasons!
 Never work on your vehicle unless the parking brake is on, the
gearshift is in Park or Neutral, and the engine is shut off. If you have
to run the engine to adjust something, turn it on and off yourself to
avoid the risk that a friendly helper may misunderstand and turn the
engine on while your hands are in the way.
 Be sure that the parts of the engine you’re working on are nice and
cool so that you don’t get burned. If you’re doing a job that calls for a
warm engine, be very careful.
 Never jack a vehicle up unless the wheels are properly blocked. I go
into more detail about this later in this chapter in “How to Use a Jack
Safely” and “How to Change a Tire.”

How to dispose of empty gasoline cans safely
Although gasoline simply burns, gasoline plus
air forms an explosive vapor that can literally
take out your entire neighborhood. For this
reason, it’s wise not to store or carry gasoline
unless you’re heading far away from any source
of fuel (and in that unlikely event, use only a spe-
cialized, vented gas can). If you have an old
gasoline can around, get rid of it, and do it in 
a way that won’t pollute the environment: Fill 
the can with water, and, as soon as you can,
take the can to a recycling center that handles
toxic waste. If there’s no center nearby, ask
your local service station if they’ll dispose of it
for you.
Some people keep gasoline around to clean
parts with, but this is extremely dangerous.
Mechanic’s solvent, available at gas stations
and auto supply stores, works better and has
been treated with a flame retardant to keep it
from burning too freely.

 Use insulated tools for electrical work.
 Before using a wrench or ratchet on a part that’s “stuck,” make sure
that if the part suddenly comes loose, your hand won’t hit anything.
To avoid the possibility of being injured because your hand slams into
something, pull on wrenches rather than push them whenever possible.
 Take off your tie, scarf, rings, long necklaces, and other jewelry. If
they get caught on parts, they — and you — can be damaged.
 Tie back long hair. If your hair accidentally gets caught in a moving fan
or belt, you can literally be scalped.
 If you’re working with toxic chemicals, such as coolant, cleaners, and
the like, keep them away from your mouth and eyes. Wash your hands
thoroughly after using them, and either store them safely away from pets
and children or dispose of them in a way that’s safe for the environment.
 Know that gasoline is extremely dangerous to have around. Not only 
is it toxic and flammable, but the vapor in an empty can is explosive
enough to take out a city block. If you must keep a small amount of gaso-
line on hand for a lawn mower or chain saw, always store it in a venti-
lated gasoline can designed specifically for that purpose. Unless you’re
going far into the wilds, never carry a can of gasoline in or on your vehi-
cle. (See the sidebar “How to dispose of empty gasoline cans safely.”)
 Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid breathing in carbon monoxide
if you have to run the engine, or breathing in toxic fumes from chemi-
cals and gasoline. If possible, work outdoors in your driveway, your
backyard, or a parking lot. If you must work in your garage, be sure to
keep the garage door open and move the vehicle as close to the door as
possible.
 Use a work light in dark areas. If you don’t already have one, Chapter 3
tells you what you need to know about buying one.
 Keep a fire extinguisher handy. Chapter 3 contains reasons for this pre-
caution that may surprise you.
So much for the scary stuff. Auto repair safety is all a matter of common
sense, really.
How to Fill ’Er Up Yourself
More and more gas stations are shifting toward self-service. If you’ve been
reluctant to abandon the luxury of the full-service lane, chances are that it’s
going to get more and more difficult to find one. Knowing how to fill ’er up
yourself not only prevents you from being stranded with an empty tank when
15
Chapter 1: Things Every Driver Should Know

there’s no one available to fill it for you, but it also saves you money on every
gallon, every time.
Fill up in the morning, before the temperature rises or fuel is delivered to the
gas station. Gasoline expands with heat, which also reduces its energy content
per gallon. Since the sales meters at service stations are set for fuel at 60°F,
you get less energy and pay more for fuel that’s hotter than that. Fuel is often
delivered to stations while still hot from the refineries and studies show that
fuel in underground tanks can top 100°F even when the weather is cooler.
Always extinguish your cigarette before you start to pump gasoline. If the
flame comes in contact with gasoline fumes, it can cause an explosion.
Here are the steps for pumping your own gas:
1. Look at the price window on the pump.
If a previous sale is registered there, reset it by following the next steps
to activate the pump and select the grade of gasoline. If the price doesn’t
disappear, try inserting your credit card or have the attendant clear the
machine so that the price window reads “$0.00.”
2. If you’re using a credit card, insert it into the slot and follow the
instructions in the credit card window.
3. Select the grade of fuel you want, and move the lever on the pump 
to ON.
4. Unscrew the cap from your fuel tank.
5. Unhook the pump nozzle and hose from the pump, and place the
nozzle into the fuel tank opening.
Some nozzles have rubber vapor-recovery sleeves that must be depressed
to allow the fuel to flow, so push the nozzle as deeply into the filler tube of
your vehicle as it will go.
6. Squeeze the trigger on the pump nozzle to allow fuel to flow out of the
hose and into your fuel tank.
There’s usually a little latch near the trigger that keeps the trigger open
so that you don’t have to stand there holding onto it and inhaling gaso-
line fumes. Don’t worry about overflows; gas pumps shut off automati-
cally when your tank is almost full.
Engaging the trigger latch gives you time to take advantage of the other
services available. You can wash the windows or check the air pressure
in your tires and add air if they need it (Chapter 17 has instructions). The
trigger latch also enables you to get farther away from the pump instead
of standing there breathing in the toxic fumes while the tank is filling.
7. When the fuel stops flowing, the trigger clicks closed and the numbers
in the pump window stop moving. Remove the nozzle from the fuel
tank and hang it back on the pump.
16
Part I: Getting to Know Your Vehicle 

Never “top off” a tank by adding fuel after the pump shuts off automati-
cally. If you overfill your tank, the fuel may overflow the fill hole or leak
out onto the road through an overflow outlet. This is not just a waste 
of your money; spilled fuel ruins asphalt, pollutes the air, and is a fire
hazard. This kind of leakage is especially prone to happen if it’s a hot
day because heat makes the fuel in your tank expand.
8. If you used a credit card, press Yes for a receipt and replace the cap
on your fuel tank while the receipt prints.
How to Open the Hood
How can you do even simple under-the-hood jobs — such as checking the 
oil, coolant, and transmission fluid; refilling windshield wiper fluid; and
checking accessory belts — if you don’t know how to get the hood of your
vehicle open?
The good news is that opening the hood is easy and uncomplicated — if you
know how to do it. Although the location of the hood release may differ from
one vehicle to the next, all releases work in pretty much the same way.
If after reading the following instructions and consulting your owner’s
manual you still can’t figure out how to get your hood open, head for the
full-service bay the next time you stop for gas and ask the attendant to show
you how to do it. You may pay a little more for fuel and a tip, but the lesson
will be worth it — and you can get your windows washed and your tire pres-
sure checked for nothing! (If you’re really short of cash, just ask for $5 worth
of gasoline; the difference in cost will be negligible.) (A sidebar in Chapter 2
tells you why you should check the oil yourself instead of having the atten-
dant do it.)
Here’s how to open the hood yourself:
1. Find your hood release and pop open the hood.
Either consult your owner’s manual, or try to remember the last time a
service station attendant opened the hood of your car. Did he or she ask
you to pull a lever inside the vehicle? Or did he or she go directly to the
front grill?
In newer models, the hood release is often inside the vehicle, some-
where near the steering column or on the floor next to the driver’s seat.
(It generally displays the word “Hood” or a picture of a car with its hood
up.) In older models, the hood release is behind the grill or the bumper.
If the hood release is inside the vehicle, press, push, or pull it until you
hear the hood pop open. If the hood release is at the front, look around
and through the grill and feel under the grill and behind the bumper to
17
Chapter 1: Things Every Driver Should Know

find a handle, lever, arm, or button. Then press, push, or pull it from
front to back and side to side until it releases the hood.
The hood will open a little, but it will probably be stopped by the safety
catch — a metal lever that, when pressed one way or the other, releases
the hood so that it can open all the way. This gizmo prevents the hood
from opening accidentally and obscuring your vision while you’re driving.
2. With one hand, raise the hood as far as it will go. With the other hand,
feel along the area between the hood and the grill for the safety catch.
Release it and raise the hood the rest of the way.
3. Secure the hood if necessary.
If the hood stays up all by itself, fine. If it doesn’t, look for a hood prop — a
long, thin metal rod attached either to the underside of the hood or to the
bottom edge of the hood opening. Either lower or lift the rod (depending
on where it’s located) and fit the end of it into the slot that’s provided to
hold it in place.
On some vehicles, the hood is held up by two gas-pressurized cylinders
known as hood shocks. If the hood doesn’t feel secure, gas may have
leaked out of these units and the hood could come down at any moment.
If you’re not sure, secure the hood with a broom handle or similar object
and have these units checked — or replaced, if needed — as soon as 
you can.
How to Take Anything Apart — and 
Get It Back Together Again
I’d never been able to follow the “easy” instructions to put my kids’ toys
together until I learned the technique that follows. Then I was able to get at
my brakes to check them and even lubricate the wheel bearings and put
everything back together again! The bonus is that this procedure works for
anything that you need to take apart and put back together again — flat tires,
toasters, bicycles, you name it.
NEVER, EVER DO A JOB IN A HURRY.
Allow yourself plenty of time. If things get rough, have some water or a cup 
of coffee. You may get a whole new perspective when you go back to work.
Limit distractions: Turn on your answering machine or take the phone off the
hook, keep the kids and the dog away, and relax. If you hit a snag, sit quietly
and think about it — don’t panic. If the parts fit together before, they’ll fit
together again.
18
Part I: Getting to Know Your Vehicle 

Follow these instructions, breathing slowly and deeply:
1. Lay a clean, lint-free rag down on a flat surface, near enough to reach
without having to get up or walk to it.
You’ll lay each part on this rag as you remove it. Consequently, the rag
shouldn’t be in an area where oil or dust or anything else can fall on it
and foul up the parts. If you plan to use something that blasts air for
cleaning purposes, leave enough of the rag uncluttered to fold it over
the parts resting on it.
2. Before you remove each part, stop and ask yourself the following ques-
tions, and if you’re worried about forgetting your answers, make notes:
• What is this thing?
• What does it do?
• How does it do it?
• Why is it made the way it is?
• How tightly is it screwed on (or fastened down)?
Most amateurs put things back very tightly, in hopes that the part won’t
fly off. But some things, like bolts that hold gaskets in place, shouldn’t
be tightened too securely because, for example, the bolt threads could
be stripped or the gasket could be squeezed out of shape, allowing what-
ever it’s holding in to get out. It’s helpful to make notes about how hard
each thing was to remove. “Don’t over-tighten” or “Be sure it’s secure.”
Some parts require exact torque specifications, but we don’t deal with
them in this book.
3. As you remove each part, lay it down on the rag in clockwise order,
with each part pointing in the direction it was in before you
removed it.
This is the key to the whole system. When you’re ready to reassemble
things, the placement and direction of each part tells you when to put it
back and how it was oriented.
4. If you’re making notes, assign each part a number indicating the
order in which you removed it — Part #1, Part #2, and so on.
You can even put numbers on the parts with masking tape if you’re
afraid that the rag may be moved accidentally. Also, note what each part
was attached to; for example, “Part #6: Hook at end of arm on left hooks
onto knob to right of Part #7.” Add a sketch if it helps.
If you work systematically and understand the function of each part, 
you won’t be left with what seem to be extra nuts and bolts at the end 
of the job.
5. When you’re ready to reassemble everything, begin with the last part
you removed, and proceed counterclockwise through the parts on the
rag. If you’ve numbered the parts, they should go on in reverse order.
19
Chapter 1: Things Every Driver Should Know

Now you’re ready to tackle the first job that will give you a chance to apply
this technique: Using a jack and changing a tire. You may never need to do it,
but if you’re stuck with the need to change a flat, you’d better know how.
How to Use a Jack Safely
The most obvious reason to jack up a car is to change a tire, but other jobs
such as inspecting brakes may also require you to get under the vehicle. (Even
if you’re skinny enough to squeeze yourself between the pavement and the
underside of your car, you still need room to move around and manipulate
tools.) Chapter 3 has detailed information about the different types of jacks as
well as items such as jack stands (essential) and creepers (nonessential, but
nice). This section explains how to use a jack safely and efficiently. The next
section tells you how to change a tire after the vehicle is in the air.
Before you attempt to jack up your vehicle, observe the following safety 
precautions:
 Jacks are used only to get a vehicle off the ground. They should never
be used to hold a vehicle in place.
 You must use jack stands when you work underneath your vehicle. If
you don’t, you run the risk of serious injury or even death. People have
been crushed to death when vehicles that were improperly secured fell
on them.
 Never jack up a vehicle without blocking the wheels to keep it from
rolling. Use bricks, wooden wedges, or metal wheel chocks to block the
wheels at the opposite end of the car from the end that is to be raised.
(Chocks are available at a low cost at auto supply stores.) Keep what-
ever you use for blocks in the trunk so that you don’t have to go hunting
around if you have to change a flat tire.
If you find yourself faced with the job of changing a tire and you have
nothing with which to block the wheels, park near the curb with the
wheels turned in. This may not keep you from getting hurt if the car rolls
off the jack, but at least innocent motorists and pedestrians won’t have
to deal with a runaway driverless vehicle!
 Never change a tire on a freeway or highway. Not only can you be 
seriously injured, but you can also fall prey to carjackers. Don’t exit the
vehicle; instead use a cellphone to call road service or an automobile
association such as the AAA. If you don’t have a cellphone, hang a white
rag or a white piece of paper out of the driver’s side window and wait for
the highway patrol to rescue you.
Even if you hate cellphones, I recommend that you buy one and keep it
in the vehicle for emergencies. You can find a very affordable model that
just lets you call 911, road service, and those you’d want to notify in an
emergency. It could save your life.
20
Part I: Getting to Know Your Vehicle 

 Always park a vehicle on level ground before you jack it up. If you get
a flat tire on a hill and can’t coast to the bottom without killing the tire
completely, park close to the curb, turn the wheels toward the curb, and
block the downside wheels securely to prevent the car from rolling.
These precautions won’t eliminate the risk of changing a tire on an
incline. If you can’t get to level ground or wait for assistance, you change
the tire at your own risk.
 Be sure that your gearshift is in Park (or in First if you have a manual
transmission) and that the parking brake is on before you jack up
the vehicle. The only time you don’t want the parking brake on is when
you have to be able to rotate a rear wheel or remove rear brake drums to
inspect the brakes. In such a case, make sure that the front wheels are
blocked securely.
If you remove a wheel and begin to work without making sure that you 
jacked up the car and blocked it securely, the vehicle can do a lot of damage
to itself — and to you — if it falls. (This is not meant to frighten you away
from jacking up your car and working on or under it. It’s just to emphasize
the fact that taking a few simple precautions can keep you safe.)
After you’ve observed all the safety precautions, follow these steps to jack up
a vehicle:
1. If you’re going to remove a wheel to change a tire or check your
brakes, remove the wheel cover or hubcap (if there is one) and loosen
the lug nuts.
After the vehicle is jacked up, the wheel will turn freely, which makes it
harder to get a wheel cover off and almost impossible to start turning
the nuts. Instructions for removing a wheel cover and loosening lug nuts
are in the next section, “How to Change a Tire.”
2. Place the jack under the part of the vehicle that it should contact
when raised. If you’re using jack stands, place them near the jack.
Where you place your jack depends on whether you’re planning to do a
one-wheel job, such as tire changing or brake checking, or a two-wheel,
whole-end repair job. Many vehicles now have special flat spots on the
underside specifically for jack placement.
If you place your jack incorrectly, you can injure your car. To find the
proper place to position the jack for your particular vehicle, check your
owner’s manual. If you don’t have a manual, ask the service depart-
ment at your dealership to show you the proper placement. In any
event, follow these guidelines:
• Never place the jack so that the weight of the vehicle rests on
something that can bend, break, or give.
21
Chapter 1: Things Every Driver Should Know

• If your manual is incomprehensible or lacks jack placement infor-
mation, try to place the jack so that it touches either the vehicle’s
frame or the big bar that supports the front wheel suspension.
• You can also place jacks near the rear-wheel axle, but until you
become more proficient at this, I’d stick to jacking up one wheel at
a time.
3. Lift the vehicle by using the jack. How you accomplish this depends
on the type of jack you’re using (see Figure 1-1):
• If you have a scissor jack, insert the rod or wrench over the knob,
and then crank.
• If you have a hydraulic jack, place the handle into the appropriate
location and pump up and down. Use nice, even strokes, taking the
jack handle from its lowest point to its highest point on each
stroke to cut down on the labor involved.
Figure 1-1: A scissor jack (a) and a hydraulic jack (b).
4. Place the jack stands under the vehicle, near where the jack is touch-
ing it (see Figure 1-2). Raise the stands until they’re high enough to
just fit under, and lock them in place. Lower the jack until the vehicle
is resting on the jack stands.
Substituting boxes, stones, or bricks for jack stands is very dangerous.
They can slip out or break while you’re under the car. A jack can do the
same thing, so be sure to buy a pair of jack stands and stow them in the
trunk if you’re traveling out of reach of help if you get a flat tire. You can
find information about buying jack stands in Chapter 3.
5. Before you begin to work, wiggle the vehicle a little to make sure that
it’s resting securely on the jack stands. Then remove the jack.
Wiggling the vehicle also tells you whether you have the wheels blocked
properly. It’s better if the vehicle falls while all four wheels are in place.
(It will bounce just a little.)

Figure 1-2: Jack stands hold your vehicle up safely.
6. When you’re finished working, replace the jack, remove the stands,
and lower the vehicle to the ground.
If you’re using a scissor jack, simply turn the crank in the opposite direc-
tion. If you’re using a hydraulic jack, use the rod to turn the pressure
release valve. The jack will do the rest of the work for you.
How to Change a Tire
These days, working on your vehicle at roadside can be risky, so the best
thing is to use your cellphone to call an automobile association or another
source of help. But if you have a flat tire in an area where you can’t get a cell-
phone signal, you can be helpless unless you know how to change a tire your-
self. For this reason, everyone should have a general idea of what’s involved.
The task seems easy enough to do:
1. Secure the vehicle so that it won’t roll.
2. Jack up the vehicle, following the instructions in the preceding sec-
tion, “How to Use a Jack Safely.”
3. Remove the old tire.
4. Put on the new tire.
5. Put away the jack stuff and the old tire.
6. Drive happily into the sunset.

Chapter 1: Things Every Driver Should Know

These may be the basic steps of changing a tire, but the job can get sticky in
a couple of places if you’re not properly equipped. The following sections
explain the steps involved in changing a tire in detail and in order. Check out
Chapter 3 for a list of the tools you need.
Because the location and type of spare tire differs from one vehicle to the next,
if you aren’t familiar with your vehicle it’s a good idea to check out the spare
(and the jack and lug wrench) before trouble occurs. While you’re at it, make
sure the spare has enough air in it and continue to check that periodically.
Removing a wheel cover or hubcap
The first task in changing a flat is to remove the wheel cover or hubcap on
the injured tire. The following steps tell you how:
1. If your car has a standard wheel
cover or hubcap, use a screwdriver 
or the flat end of a lug wrench (see
Figure 3-16 in Chapter 3) to pry it off.
Just insert the point of the tool where
the edge of the cover meets the wheel,
and apply a little leverage (see Figure
1-3). The cap should pop off. You may
have to do this in a couple of places,
as if you were prying the lid off a can
of paint.
If the cover has a delicate finish, con-
sult your owner’s manual for instruc-
tions on how to remove it without
damage. It may pry off or unscrew.
2. Lay the cover down on its back so
that you can put the lug nuts into it
to keep them from rolling away and
heading for the nearest sewer.
If you’re afraid of marring the finish, lay the cover on a rag.
After you remove the wheel cover or hubcap, the next task is to loosen the
lug nuts.
Loosening the lug nuts
Lug nuts are those big nuts that hold the wheel in place. How you remove the
lug nuts on your vehicle depends on whether you have alloy wheels that are
24

Figure 1-3: You can use a
screwdriver to pry a wheel cover
loose.

held on by lug nuts with delicate finishes, or hubcaps or wheel covers with
standard lug nuts behind them.
Lug nuts with special finishes
The delicate aluminum or chrome-plated lug nuts on alloy wheels need careful
handling. They should never be loosened or replaced with power tools that can
scratch the delicate finish. (Some power tools have rubberized or plastic-coated
fittings to avoid damaging the nuts, but those will be of no use to you on the
road with no power supply to run them.) Many mechanics prefer to do it all by
hand using a special lug fitting to avoid scarring the finish or rounding off the
corners of the nuts. You can find this fitting at many parts and tire shops.
Some alloy wheels come with one or more locking nuts on each wheel to help
discourage wheel thieves, and you must use the special “key” that came with
the car to unlock them before loosening. Be sure you know where your wheel
locks are, if your vehicle has them.
Lug nuts with standard finishes
Most garages retighten ordinary lug nuts with a power tool, and unless
you’ve done the job yourself by hand, they’re pretty hard to loosen yourself.
(Take my advice in Chapter 3 and buy a cross-shaft lug wrench. Figure 3-16
shows what one looks like.)
To make the job easier if an emergency
arises, you may want to go out and try to
remove the lug nuts on your vehicle now, fol-
lowing these instructions. If you have prob-
lems, resolve them now so that you won’t
have to struggle at the side of the road.
1. Find the end of the wrench that fits the
lug nuts on your vehicle, and fit it onto
the first nut.
Always work on lug nuts in consecutive
order so that you don’t forget to tighten
any later.
2. Apply all your weight to the bar on the
left.
This starts turning the nut counterclock-
wise, which loosens it.
I don’t suggest using this kind of strong-arm tactic on lug nuts with spe-
cial finishes, but if an ordinary nut has been put on with a power tool
and you can’t get it started, a piece of hollow pipe, fitted over that left-
hand arm of the cross-shaft wrench, magically adds enough leverage to
start the nut easily (see Figure 1-4). After you replace the nut yourself,
25
Chapter 1: Things Every Driver Should Know
Figure 1-4: A hollow pipe and a
cross-shaft wrench can loosen the
tightest lug nuts.

this aid is no longer necessary. But remember, the longer the arms on
your lug wrench, the more leverage you have.
Don’t remove the lug nuts completely; just get them loose enough to remove
by hand after jacking up the vehicle.
Changing the tire
Before you jack up your vehicle, remove the spare from the trunk. After the
vehicle is safely jacked up and the lug nuts are off, follow these instructions
to change the tire:
1. Roll the spare tire to the scene of the action if you haven’t already
done so.
2. Grasp the flat tire with both hands and pull it toward you.
The flat tire sits on the exposed bolts that the lug nuts screw onto. As
you pull the flat off, it should slide along the bolts until, suddenly, it
clears the end of the bolts and you find yourself supporting its full
weight. Tires are heavy, and you’ll be quite happy to lower it to the
ground (if you haven’t already dropped it).
3. Roll the flat along the ground to the rear of the vehicle to get it out of
the way.
4. Lift the spare onto the lug bolts.
Because tires are heavy, you may have a little trouble lifting the spare
into place — especially if you’re not accustomed to lifting heavy things.
5. After you have the spare tire in place, replace the lug nuts and tighten
them by hand.
Give each lug nut a jolt with the wrench to get it firmly into place, but
wait until the car is on the ground before you really try to tighten the 
lug nuts.
6. Replace the jack, use it to lift the vehicle off the jack stands and lower
the car to the ground.
7. After the vehicle is resting on the ground, use the lug wrench to
tighten the lug nuts as much as you can.
If your vehicle has alloy wheels, tighten the lug nuts until the lug wrench
won’t move any more, then press down on the wrench’s cross arm with
all your weight, but don’t jerk it or kick it or jump on it as you could
cause the wrench to damage the finish on the nut.
Standard lug nuts are sturdier than those on alloy wheels, but you don’t
want to twist them off the bolts or ruin the threads. However, you don’t
want the wheel to fall off, either. If you’re worried about tightening them
26
Part I: Getting to Know Your Vehicle 

sufficiently, use your hollow pipe, or step on the right-hand arm of the
lug wrench after the nut is tight.
8. Replace the wheel cover or hubcap.
If your car has wheel covers with a delicate finish, the owner’s manual
should provide instructions for replacing it. If not, reverse the order of
things you did when removing it (if you had to pry it off, then it probably
pops back in with a sharp tap of your hand; if it unscrewed like a big jar
top, then it screws back in).
If your car has hubcaps, place the hubcap against the wheel and whack it
into place with the heel of your hand. Cushion your hand with a soft rag
first so that you won’t hurt it. And don’t hit the hubcap with a wrench or
hammer — you’ll dent it. Whack it a couple of times, in a couple of
places, to be sure that it’s on evenly and securely. (Even secondhand
hubcaps can be expensive to replace, and that’s if you can find the one
you need.) If it’s too much of a hassle, or if you don’t have the time to
replace the hubcap, you can take it home and install it later; it’s mostly
ornamental, and you can drive for a while without it. But do replace it
soon because it helps keep dust and dirt out of your brakes and bearings.
9. Put the flat in the trunk where the spare was located, and put your
tools (including wheel blocks) away.
Get that flat fixed immediately; you don’t know when you may need it again!
And make sure that it’s repaired properly. Instead of dismounting the tire
from the wheel rim, inspecting it, fixing it, and remounting it, some service
stations simply plug the flat from the outside. Several states now outlaw this
procedure, known as “outside-in” repair, and patches should never be used if
the hole is in the sidewall rather than the tread. In either case, be sure to tell
the service facility that you don’t want the tire plugged from the outside; you
want the flat corrected the proper way.
If you get caught in the middle of nowhere with a flat tire and are unable to call
or wait for service, and if you don’t feel safe — or capable of — changing it
yourself, a can of nonflammable inflator/sealant can get you rolling again in min-
utes. Simply screw the nozzle of the can onto the valve stem of the flat tire. It
will fill the tire with air and some sort of goop that temporarily seals the punc-
ture. Because there’s still some question about how permanent this fix is and its
ultimate effects on your tire, look for a major brand that’s environmentally
friendly and can be rinsed out of the tire with soap and water by a tire repair
professional. Use this product only in emergencies, get to a service station as
soon as possible, and be sure to tell them that you used canned inflator/sealant
and that they should remove the stuff before fixing the tire.
If reading these instructions makes you think that you’d rather languish by the
side of the road for hours than undertake changing a tire yourself, consider
outfitting your vehicle with run-flat tires. Although these tires are more expen-
sive and some require special wheels, they make it possible to drive with a flat
to the nearest service station without ruining the tire. Chapter 17 has more
information about run-flat tires.

Chapter 1: Things Every Driver Should Know

How to Get In When You’re Locked Out
If you tend to leave the keys in your car fairly often, consider hiding an extra
key somewhere on the vehicle. A little magnetic key box that sticks to the
metal surface of a steel body or frame is best, but be sure to place it in an
obscure and hard-to-reach area where it can’t jiggle loose and fall off. I leave the
location up to you — be imaginative. Struggling a little to reach that extra key
is better than having car thieves find it. And don’t hide your house key with it.
Fortunately, many new vehicles come with electronic door openers or “digital
keys” that don’t allow you to lock the doors with the keys in the vehicle. The
downside is that if you lose the gadget, it can take days and hundreds of 
dollars to replace it, and you’ll probably need to have the vehicle towed to 
a dealer who will order a new key.
If your vehicle has an electronic door opener, you may be able to get the door
open, but if you’ve lost the opener outside your vehicle, the ignition may fail
to start without it. Some vehicles have override switches for this eventuality,
so find out whether you’d be able to start your vehicle without your opener,
and locate the override switch now, if there is one.
Assuming that you’ve decided not to risk hiding an extra set of keys on your
car, here are a few things you can try to get in without a key:
 If your vehicle has door locks that are recessed inside the interior
door handle, get professional help.
 If you have the old-style door locks with little buttons on the window
ledge, straighten a wire coat hanger and bend the end into a little hook.
Insert it between the rubber molding and the side window and then
carefully hook it around the door button and pull it up.
 If you have smooth buttons, you can try to hook one using the hanger
technique, but most will refuse to budge.
 If you happen to lock yourself out of the vehicle while you have the
trunk open, you may be able to move the rear seat out of the way and
gain access to the rear of the car (or you can hide an extra ignition key
in the trunk).
If you need professional help, call emergency road assistance and ask if they
will be able to open the door. If not, ask them to send a local locksmith. The
good news is that each car key is coded by the auto manufacturer, and if you
have the key code number and personal identification, a locksmith can make
you a new key. Write down the key code number and leave it where someone
at home can read it to you in an emergency. Also record it — without identify-
ing what it is — in your pocket address book or in your wallet before you lose
your keys. If you bought the vehicle, new or used, from a dealer, the dealer
may still have the number on file or the automaker may have a record of it.
Failing that, a good locksmith may be able to analyze a key in fairly new con-
dition and come up with the proper code for it.

E
veryone knows a few chronic tire kickers. Before they get in and drive off,
these people habitually walk around their cars and kick the tires to make
sure that they aren’t flat. The same people habitually open and close all the
cabinet doors in the kitchen and check the gas jets every time they go past
the stove. You may laugh at them, but they’re probably rarely caught with flat
tires, open cabinets, or leaking gas. Why not learn from these folks and make a
habit of checking the little things under the hood of your vehicle — maybe not
every time you drive somewhere, but definitely once a month and before
starting out on long road trips.
If the idea of committing yourself to a regular under-the-hood checkup seems
less than alluring, look at it this way: Spending 15 minutes a month checking
under the hood can prevent 70 percent of the problems that lead to highway
breakdowns!
What you need to check regularly is anything that can run out of fluid, lose 
air, jiggle loose, or fray after use — in other words, things like coolant, tire 
pressure, hoses, and accessory belts. This chapter explains what to look for,
how to look for it, and what to do if you discover that something needs to be
replaced or refilled. You’ll be happy to know it doesn’t require any special tools.
I provide a Maintenance Record in Appendix B. Make a copy for each of your
vehicles to keep track of what you check and what you replace each time you
do an under-the-hood checkup. Appendix B also contains a Specifications
Record; to avoid having to return parts that don’t fit your vehicle, make a copy
of this “spec sheet” for each of your vehicles, fill in the appropriate part num-
bers, and keep it in the glove box so that you have it whenever you buy parts.

Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Getting Your Bearings under the Hood
Once a month, in the morning before you’ve driven your vehicle, arm your-
self with a clean, lint-free rag and the household tools mentioned in this chap-
ter, and open the hood of your vehicle. (If you’ve never done that, flip back to
Chapter 1.) Then check the items in the sections that follow. The checkup
may take a bit longer the first time you do it, but after that you should be
able to whip through this check in about 15 minutes. As a matter of fact, you
may want to grab this book and your owner’s manual (if you have one), go
out to your vehicle, and locate each part while you read. Figure 2-1 helps you
find each part. Make a game of it. Enjoy!
When you do the check for real, if you find that the coolant, oil, transmis-
sion, brake, or power-steering fluid levels are low, fill them to the proper
levels and check again in a couple of days. If any of them are low again, visit a
mechanic to find out why you’re losing fluid and correct the problem.

Check the Air Filter
In most newer, fuel-injected vehicles, the air filter is found inside a rectangu-
lar box called a cold air collector box (see Figure 2-2). It’s usually close 
to the front of the vehicle near the inside of one of the fenders. Air that’s
scooped up by the front of the vehicle moves through an air intake tube into
the air filter inside the box (see Figure 2-2). On older fuel-injected engines and
carbureted engines, the filter is found in the air cleaner, which sits atop the
engine. As you can see in Figure 2-3, it’s large and round with a snorkel stick-
ing out of the side to facilitate the intake of fresh air. Your owner’s manual
should have instructions on how to locate and get at your air filter. If you
have no manual, see Chapter 8 for general instructions.
To find out if your air filter needs to be replaced, just lift it out (it isn’t fas-
tened down) and hold it up to the sun or to a strong light. Can you see the
light streaming through it? If not, try dropping it lightly, bottom-side down, on
a hard surface to jar some dirt loose. (Don’t blow through the filter — you
can foul it up that way.) If you drop the filter a few times and it’s still too dirty
to see through, you need a new one. Chapter 7 tells you more about air fil-
ters, and Chapter 8 has instructions for buying and replacing them.
Because the air filter extracts dirt and dust particles from the air, you should
change it at least once a year or every 20,000 miles, whichever comes first —
unless yours gets very dirty before then. If you do most of your driving in a
dusty or sandy area, you may need to replace your air filter more often.

Figure 2-3: On carbureted vehicles, the air filter is inside the air cleaner.
Check the Accessory Belts
If you’re under the hood of your vehicle and can see without having to remove
shields or cowlings, take a look at the serpentine accessory belt that drives the
alternator, the power-steering pump, the air conditioning compressor, the water
pump in many cases, and other parts
of a modern vehicle. (If you drive an
older car, look at the separate belts.)
Figures 2-4 and 2-5 show you what
both types of belts look like.
If you can’t access an accessory belt
easily to check it yourself, have it
checked when you have the vehicle
serviced or if the belt gets noisy or
any of the equipment it drives begins
to malfunction.
If you can see an accessory belt
easily, here’s what to look for:
 If the belt “gives” more than 1⁄2 inch when you press on it but other-
wise is in good condition, it may just need to be adjusted.

Figure 2-4: Accessory belts.

 If the belt is glazed or has oil on
it, the slick surface will slip where
it winds around the pulleys and it
won’t be able to efficiently drive
the components connected to 
it. Your engine may overheat
because the water pump isn’t
operating properly, or the air con-
ditioner may fail to cool the inte-
rior of your vehicle. Have the belt
replaced.
 If you see chunks missing from
the belt or many cracks across
its surface, or if it’s frayed or
tearing, debris may be embedded
in it, or one of the pulleys may be
out of alignment. The safest move
is to replace the belt.
Chapter 12 provides more detailed information about how to inspect an
accessory belt and whether you can deal with it yourself or have a profes-
sional work on it.
Check the Battery
The battery stores the electrical current that your vehicle uses to start and
passes electricity along to the parts of your vehicle that need it to function,
such as the ignition system, lights, radio, and so on. (For more information
about the ignition system in general and the battery in particular, see
Chapters 5 and 6.)
A battery, like other parts of your vehicle, is subject to wear and tear and
should be checked regularly. In particular, pay attention to the battery’s trou-
ble spots shown in Figure 2-6. Also, a battery that’s kept clean should last
longer than a cruddy one.
Before you work on your battery, be sure to read all the safety measures
involved. Here’s a rundown:
 Never work on a battery with a lit cigarette in your mouth. (For that
matter, you should not only never smoke while working around your
vehicle, you should never smoke at all!) Batteries are filled with sulfuric
acid that generates hydrogen gas, so you need to be careful when work-
ing around them. If you get acid deposits on your skin or clothes, wash
them off with water immediately.
33
Chapter 2: Preventive Maintenance: A Monthly Under-the-Hood Check
Figure 2-5: Serpentine multi-
accessory drive belt.

Figure 2-6: The parts of the battery to check.
 Disconnect the battery whenever you work on it, but be sure to shut
the engine off first! On most modern vehicles, computers control func-
tions of the engine, fuel and ignition systems, automatic transmis-
sions, and other stuff. Therefore, when messing about with batteries
and their cables, you need to be extremely careful not to inadvertently
send a shot of unwanted voltage into one of the computers and destroy
it. For this reason, it’s important to disconnect the battery before you
work on it.
 Always remove the negative cable from the battery if you plan to
work on wiring under the hood. This will prevent you from possibly
damaging electrical components or receiving a shock.
 When removing and replacing both battery cables, always remove the
negative cable first and replace it last. If you attempt to remove the
positive clamp first and your wrench slips and touches something metal,
your wrench can fuse to the part like an arc welder.
 Tie the cables back while you work on the battery so that they don’t
flop back over onto the terminals. Don’t allow anything made of metal
to connect the terminal posts; this can damage the battery. If the cables
are connected to the posts when something else interferes, you can
destroy the onboard computers.
The radio may be affected by disconnecting the battery. As a precaution,
you can maintain power while the battery is disconnected by making a
cheap tool with a cigarette lighter socket and a 9-volt battery. (Most
electronics stores can set this up for you.) Plug the 9-volt battery into
your cigarette lighter socket before disconnecting the vehicle’s battery,
and remove it after the battery is back on.

Part I: Getting to Know Your Vehicle 

Don’t let all the cautions that I list here turn you off the idea of checking your
vehicle’s battery. It’s easy to check your battery if you follow these steps:
1. Locate your battery.
Figure 2-6 shows you what it looks like and what may be wrong with it.
2. If you see powdery deposits on the positive and negative terminals,
clean them off.
The cruddy deposits that form in lovely colors on the top of your termi-
nals are made by battery acid. Before you clean this stuff off, remove the
cables from both terminals by undoing the nut on each cable clamp and
wiggling the cable until the clamp comes off the terminal post.
This bears repeating: Always remove the cable clamp from the negative
terminal first. (It’s the one that’s marked with a “–” sign.) When you’re
through with the job, replace the positive cable first and the negative
cable last.
To brush the deposits off the terminal posts and cable clamps, sprinkle
some baking soda straight from the little yellow box that keeps your
refrigerator smelling nice onto each terminal, dip an old toothbrush or
disposable brush in water, and scrub the deposits away.
If your cables and clamps won’t
clean up completely with baking
soda and water, rotate an inexpen-
sive battery terminal brush (see
Figure 2-7) on each terminal to
shine it up and ensure a good, solid
electrical connection. You can also
shine up the insides of the cable
clamps with the clamp cleaner
that’s usually sold as one unit with
the brush. A soapless steel wool
pad may also do the job.
3. Dry everything off with a clean,
disposable, lint-free rag.
Try to avoid getting the powdery
stuff on your hands or clothes. If
you do, wash it off with water right
away, and neither you nor your
clothes will be damaged.
4. Reconnect the terminals to the battery, replacing the positive cable
first and the negative cable last.
After the battery terminals are reconnected, coat the terminals with
thick automotive grease or petroleum jelly to prevent corrosive deposits
from forming again. 
35
Chapter 2: Preventive Maintenance: A Monthly Under-the-Hood Check
Figure 2-7: A battery terminal brush
(inside the cap) and clamp cleaner.

5. Examine the battery cables and clamps to see whether they’re badly
frayed or corroded.
If the damage looks extensive, the cables and clamps may need to be
replaced; otherwise, the battery may short-circuit, which could damage
onboard computers. Have a professional check it out.
6. If you’ve been having trouble starting your engine, if your headlights
seem dim, or if the battery is old, check to see whether the electrolyte
in the battery is strong enough. If it’s weak, the battery may need to
be recharged or replaced before it dies and leaves you stranded.
Ask your local service station to test the battery (assuming you trust
them not to sell you a new one you may not need).
7. Check the battery case and the terminals.
If you see major cracks in the battery case or obvious terminal damage,
replace the battery regardless of its electrical performance. Chapter 6
tells you how to replace a battery and recycle the old one.
Check the Coolant
The radiator in your vehicle cools your engine and needs water and coolant
(sometimes called antifreeze) to function. This section focuses on checking the
coolant and adding more, if necessary. (Chapter 11 familiarizes you with the
parts of the cooling system and how they work; Chapter 12 tells you how to
flush the cooling system and replace the coolant, and how to do minor repairs
on it; and Chapter 21 tells you what to do if your vehicle overheats on the road.)
Keep the following points in mind as you check the level of the liquid in your
cooling system and add more, if necessary:
 Rather than open the cap on the radiator, just check to see whether
the liquid reaches the “Full” line on the side of the coolant reservoir.
(That’s the plastic bottle connected to the radiator that holds an extra
supply of liquid, as shown in Figure 2-1. It’s part of the coolant recovery
system.) If the liquid doesn’t reach the “Full” line, open the bottle and
add a 50/50 mix of water and coolant until it does.
Always use a 50/50 mixture of coolant and water to fill or top off the
cooling system. Use just water only in an emergency. Most modern
engines have aluminum cylinder heads, which require the protective
anticorrosive properties of antifreeze. For the purposes of brevity, I refer
to that 50/50 mix simply as “liquid” or “coolant” from now on.
36
Part I: Getting to Know Your Vehicle 

Some coolant recovery systems are pressurized and have a radiator
pressure cap instead of a normal cap. Some older vehicles have no
coolant reservoir, so to check and add coolant you have to open the cap
on the radiator.
Never add coolant to a hot engine! If you need to add more liquid, wait
until the engine has cooled down to avoid the possibility of being burned
or cracking your engine block. Don’t open the caps on either of these
systems when the engine is hot; if you do, hot coolant may be ejected. 
Be sure to read up on safely removing pressure caps and checking and
adding coolant in Chapter 12 before working on them.
 Coolant is usually red, green, blue, or yellow. If it looks colorless, looks
rusty, or has things floating around in it, flush your cooling system and
add new coolant.
 If the coolant has a sludgy, oily surface, immediately take the vehicle
to your mechanic to check for internal head gasket leakage. The serv-
ice facility has special equipment for performing this check.
 While you’re messing around with your cooling system, feel the radia-
tor hoses, too. (They’re the big hoses that go into the top and come out
of the bottom of the radiator.) If they’re leaking, cracked, bulgy, or
squishy, they should be replaced. The next section tells you how to
check all the hoses under the hood. For more information about replac-
ing hoses, see Chapter 12.
Check the Hoses
There are a variety of hoses under the hood. Some carry water or air;
vacuum hoses have . . . well . . . nothing in them. Walk around the hood area
and squeeze every hose you encounter. If you find any that are leaking, bulgy,
soft and squishy, or hard and brittle, it’s easy and inexpensive to replace
them. You can find instructions for how to do so in Chapter 12.
It pays to replace hoses before they leak, collapse, or break; by putting it off,
any savings in time or effort aren’t worth the aggravation of having your trip
come to an abrupt halt on the highway. Most tow trucks don’t carry spare
hoses (they’d have to carry too many different kinds, and they don’t have the
time to change hoses on the road), and you may end up paying an expensive
tow charge for a couple of dollars’ worth of hose that you could have replaced
ahead of time in about ten minutes. When you replace a hose, keep the old
one in the trunk so if you need one fast you won’t have to wait for the proper
one to arrive if the repair facility doesn’t have it in stock. (You can replace the
old, temporary hose with a fresh one when time allows.)

Chapter 2: Preventive Maintenance: A Monthly Under-the-Hood Check

Check the Dipsticks
Checking dipsticks is a major part of your under-the-hood check. It’s easy to
do and provides valuable clues, not only to whether the fluid levels are suffi-
cient but also to the condition of several vital systems on your vehicle. The
following sections deal with how to check each type of dipstick. If you have
trouble locating a dipstick, check your owner’s manual or ask a service sta-
tion attendant to check it for you and watch closely to see where it is.
Check the oil
Oil reduces the friction in your engine and keeps it running smoothly. You
should check your oil at least once a month to make sure that there’s enough
oil and that it isn’t contaminated.
Some European vehicles
don’t have an oil dipstick. If
you can’t find one on your
vehicle, check the owner’s
manual for the proper way
to check your oil.
To find out whether your
vehicle needs oil, follow
these steps:
1. When the engine is
cold (or has been off
for at least ten min-
utes), pull out the dip-
stick (the one with a
ring or other type of
finger grip on the end 
of it that sticks out of
the engine), and wipe
it off on a clean, lint-
free rag.
The location of the oil
dipstick depends on
whether your vehicle
has an in-line engine
(rear-wheel drive) or
a transverse engine
(front-wheel drive), as
shown in Figures 2-8
and 2-9.

2. Insert the stick back into the pipe.
If the dipstick gets stuck on the way in, turn it around. The pipe it fits into
is curved, and the metal stick bends naturally in the direction of the
curve if you put it back in the way it came out.
3. Pull the dipstick out again and look at the film of oil on the end of the
stick (see Figure 2-10). Note how high the oil film reaches on the dip-
stick and the condition of the oil, and add or change the oil as needed.
Oil turns black pretty
quickly, but that doesn’t
affect the quality. Rub a
little between your thumb
and index finger, and if it
leaves a dirty smudge, it
probably needs to be changed.
If your oil looks clean enough but only reaches the “Add” level on the
dipstick, you need to add oil. You can buy oil the next time you fill up
with gas at the service station or you can find it at auto supply stores,
supermarkets, discount stores, and large drugstores. Chapter 13 can
help you to determine the proper weight oil for your vehicle; it also pro-
vides instructions for locating the place to pour in the oil.
If the oil is dirty or smells of gasoline, it should be changed. You can pay
a mechanic or an oil-change station to change it for you, but why not
head to Chapter 13 to find out how to change the oil yourself? The task
is easy and can save you a lot of money.
4. Put the dipstick back into the pipe. You’re done!

Why you should check the oil yourself
The problem with driving into a service station
and allowing the attendant to check your oil is
that the dipstick always reads a little low
because so much of the oil is still inside the hot
engine rather then in the oil pan. By adding
more oil until it reaches the “Full” level on the
stick while the engine is still hot, the attendant
may overfill the engine and damage it. For this
reason, always wait at least ten minutes after
you shut off the engine before allowing anyone
to check the dipstick. If you don’t feel like sitting
around at a gas station, the best time to check
your oil is first thing in the morning, when the
vehicle has been sitting all night and the engine
is cold.

Check the automatic transmission fluid
To check your automatic transmission fluid, look for a dipstick handle
sticking out of your transmission toward the rear of an in-line engine on
vehicles with rear-wheel drive (refer to Figure 2-8) or sticking out of the
transaxle if your vehicle has front-wheel drive (refer to Figure 2-9).
If you have a vehicle with a manual transmission, disregard this part of the
under-the-hood check. The fluid level in a manual transmission must be
checked with the vehicle on a hoist to enable the technician to reach a plug
in the bottom of the transmission. It’s best not to monkey around with this
yourself. The next time your car is in for service, have the technician check
the transmission fluid level for you. It’s a good idea to know what type and
viscosity of fluid goes into your transmission and to make sure that’s what
the technician plans to use. Some newer manual transmissions use automatic
transmission fluid; others use engine oil.
To check your automatic transmission fluid, follow these steps:
1. With the gearshift in Neutral or Park and the parking brake on, let
your engine run. When the engine is warm, pull out the dipstick.
(Don’t turn off the engine.)
2. Dip the tip of your index finger into the fluid on the dipstick and rub
the fluid between your finger and the tip of your thumb.
The transmission fluid on the dipstick should be pinkish and almost
clear. If it looks or smells burnt or has particles in it, have a mechanic
drain and change the fluid.
3. Wipe the dipstick with a clean, lint-free rag; then reinsert it and pull it
out again.
4. If the transmission fluid is clear but doesn’t reach the “Full” line on
the dipstick, use a funnel to pour just enough transmission fluid down
the dipstick tube to reach the line. Don’t overfill!
There are several types of transmission fluid. Each is made for a specific type
of automatic transmission. Newer transmissions from the major automakers
require different fluid than older ones. Because so many different kinds of
transmissions are around these days, check your owner’s manual or dealer-
ship to find out which type of fluid your vehicle requires, and enter that type
on your Specifications Record in Appendix B.
A faulty transmission and one that’s just low on fluid share many of the same
symptoms! If your vehicle hesitates when your automatic transmission shifts
gears, check the transmission fluid level before you let any mechanic start
talking about servicing or adjusting your transmission or selling you a new
one. Obviously, adding transmission fluid is a lot cheaper than replacing the
whole transmission system! See Chapter 20 for advice.
40

Check the power-steering fluid
To check the power-steering fluid, locate the power-steering pump in your
vehicle (see Figure 2-11). If you can’t find it, your owner’s manual should tell
you where it is and whether you
need to check it and add to it with
the engine running or turned off.
Unscrew the cap on the pump and
see whether the fluid reaches the
“Full” mark on the dipstick. If the
level is low, check your owner’s
manual or dealership to find out
what kind of fluid your power-
steering pump requires. Mark this
on your Specifications Record in
Appendix B for future reference.
Check the Brake
Fluid
The brake booster is on the driver’s side of your vehicle, usually up near the
firewall. Just in front of that, sitting on and connected to the brake master
cylinder is the brake fluid reservoir, usually a plastic canister that contains
(you guessed it) brake fluid (see Figure 2-12). Older vehicles don’t have a
plastic reservoir; instead, the master cylinder is a little metal box with a lid
that you must remove to check the fluid level (see Figure 2-13).
Figure 2-12: The master cylinder on many popular
cars.

Chapter 2: Preventive Maintenance: A Monthly Under-the-Hood Check
Figure 2-11: The power-steering pump.
Figure 2-13: Releasing the lid of a metal
master cylinder with a screwdriver.

When you put your foot on the brake pedal, the fluid in the master cylinder
moves down the brake lines to the front and rear brakes. If there’s insufficient
brake fluid, air is introduced into the brake lines and your vehicle doesn’t stop
properly. Therefore, it’s important to keep enough brake fluid in your brake
fluid reservoir.
If your vehicle has an anti-lock braking system (ABS), consult your owner’s
manual before checking your brake fluid. Some ABS systems require you to
pump the brake pedal approximately 25 to 30 times before opening and
inspecting the fluid reservoir.
To check your brake fluid, do the following:
1. Clean the top of the reservoir carefully.
A small amount of dirt falling into the fluid can cause the internal seals
of the master cylinder to fail. Your brakes will begin to lose effectiveness
and ultimately fail completely.
2. Open the top of your brake fluid reservoir.
If you have the kind with a little plastic reservoir on top, just unscrew
the cap of the reservoir shown in Figure 2-12. If you have a metal master
cylinder that contains the reservoir, use a screwdriver to pry the retain-
ing clamp off the top (see Figure 2-13).
Don’t leave the master cylinder uncovered or an open can of brake fluid
sitting around for too long. Brake fluid soaks up moisture to keep it from
settling in the hydraulic components and corroding them. If moist air
gets to brake fluid for as little as 15 minutes, the fluid is ruined. So don’t
dawdle, and keep the can tightly closed until you’re ready to use it.
3. Look to see where the fluid level lies between the “Low” and “High”
marks on the plastic reservoir to make sure that the brake fluid level
is within 1⁄2 inch or so of the cap.
If the level isn’t high enough, add the proper brake fluid for your vehicle.
(You can find instructions for buying the proper brake fluid in Chapter 15.)
If the brake fluid reservoir is empty when you check it, you may have to
bleed the brake system. Turn to Chapter 15 for step-by-step instructions.
4. Check the color of your brake fluid.
Because brake fluid deteriorates with use, it should be replaced by a
mechanic if it’s dark in color.
Have your brake fluid changed every two years. Doing so protects the
hydraulic components from internal corrosion and premature brake failure.
42
Part I: Getting to Know Your Vehicle 

Also keep the following points in mind as you check the brake system:
 Brake fluid is toxic, so take any rags with more than just a couple of
small spots of fluid on them and any partially used cans of fluid to a
toxic waste center for disposal.
 Don’t get brake fluid on anything that’s painted because brake fluid
eats paint. If you spill any, wipe it up immediately and dispose of the rag
eco-logically!
 Don’t get grease or oil in your brake fluid; either one may ruin your
hydraulic brake system.
Check the Wiring
Feel the wires that you encounter under the hood. If they feel hard and inflex-
ible, if bright metal wires show through the insulation, or if the wires look
corroded or very messy where they attach to various devices, they may need
to be changed before they short out. Have a professional do the rewiring
work for you.
Check the Windshield Washer Fluid
Under the hood of your vehicle is a plastic container that contains the fluid for
your windshield wipers. Is it full of liquid? If not, you can fill it with any one of
a variety of windshield washer solutions — you can even use a home window
cleaner. Just don’t use detergent, which can leave a residue that can plug up
your lines. Plus, it isn’t easy to drive with suds all over your windshield!
Pay attention to the kind of windshield washer fluid you use. Some are con-
centrated, which means that you need to mix them with water before adding
them to the reservoir. If you live in an area that gets cold in the winter, con-
sider a premixed washer solution that contains antifreeze. This solution
comes in quart and gallon sizes and keeps your windshield clean while pre-
venting the liquid from freezing up in cold weather.
Check and Replace Windshield Wipers
If your wipers have been making a mess of your windshield, buy new blades or
new inserts for them. The rubber wiper inserts are inexpensive and usually
just slide into place. The metal blades into which the inserts fit are a little
43
Chapter 2: Preventive Maintenance: A Monthly Under-the-Hood Check

more expensive, but if your old ones look corroded or generally aren’t in good
shape, you should replace them as well. Consult your owner’s manual or auto
parts store for the type and size of blades you need and for instructions on
inserting the blades if you can’t figure out the instructions on the package. Be
aware that some vehicles have different-sized wipers for the driver and pas-
senger sides and that other vehicles have only one wiper. If your vehicle has a
rear window wiper, don’t forget to check that, too.
To avoid being caught in a downpour with no visibility, change your blades
after a hot summer, before an annual rainy season, or at least twice a year.
Check the Tires
Tires that are low on air pressure wear down faster, increase fuel consump-
tion, and make your vehicle harder to steer. Tires with too much pressure
may blow out or steer erratically. For these reasons, keep your tires inflated
to within the manufacturer’s specified range. Check the pressure in each tire
regularly, and add or release air as needed. Chapter 17 has instructions for
performing these easy tasks and checking your tires for signs of problems.
Don’t forget to check the sidewalls.
Drive and Enjoy!
If you’ve done this monthly under-the-hood check, congratulations! You now
know that your vehicle has what it needs in terms of fuel, oil, water, and
other exotic beverages. You can be reasonably sure that it won’t leave you
stranded on the highway because of a faulty hose, wire, or belt, and you did it
all yourself! Get in and drive around. It feels smoother, right? The pickup is
better. Your vehicle knows that you care about it, and your efforts have
drawn the two of you closer to one another. Silly romanticizing? Well, I have
either an extremely affectionate car or a wild imagination.

 Getting the best tools for your money

W
hether you’re trying to cook up a decent meal, paint a picture, run an
office, or work on your vehicle, you’re only as good as your tools. Just
as you can’t slice tomatoes super-thin with a bent, rusty, dull knife, you can’t
do any kind of work on your vehicle if you lack the means to loosen or
remove parts, clean them, reinstall them, adjust them, or replace them, and
test the results.
Before you run off to return this book because you aren’t prepared to spend a
lot of money on tools that you’ll probably never use again after you ruin your
engine or cut off your thumb, let me tell you that all you really need are a few
basic, inexpensive implements. (I’ll deal with the engine and your thumb
later.) In this chapter, I list and describe the basic tools you need for working
on your vehicle. You may be surprised at how many of them you already own,
and in the event that you need to buy a few, I give you pointers on getting
value for your money.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Shopping for Tools
Tool prices vary widely, but if you keep your eyes open and know where to
go, whom to talk to, and what to look for, you can get a good value at a fair
price. Here are some general pointers:

 Shop for tools in a major auto parts chain store, and stick to well-known
brands. Poor quality tools can break and cause injuries.
 Watch the newspaper for sales; most chains have them regularly, and
you can save a lot of money that way.
 Buy each kind of tool in sets of different sizes rather than buying each
size at random. You can save money this way.
 Look for high-grade steel with no rough edges.
 Pick out friendly-looking salespeople and ask them what kinds of tools
they buy. Most are auto enthusiasts who are delighted that you’re plan-
ning to do your own work (and be a future customer), and they’re happy
to point out the best buys.
Buying everything at once isn’t necessary to get started on your car; use the
beg, borrow, and steal-from-the-family-toolbox methods if you must. Or, if as
you read this chapter you’re made painfully aware that you need to buy practi-
cally everything, consider prepackaged tool kits. Nearly every major supplier
carries an inexpensive basic automotive tool kit that contains everything you
need for maintenance and minor repairs. If you’re totally tool-poor, such a kit
may prove to be the best buy. Just make sure that you’re getting good quality
tools; it’s better to have a couple of tools that work well than to have a large
assortment of junk.
While I’m on the subject, empty toolboxes are inexpensive and worth buying.
They keep tools clean, in good shape, and, most important, all in one place.
Look for a lightweight, plastic toolbox that fits easily into the trunk of your
vehicle. Although your tools are useful around the house, it’s nice to have
them handy if you get stuck away from home.
Screwdrivers
There are two basic types of screwdrivers: standard, or slot, screwdrivers (the
most common type) and Phillips screwdrivers. The difference between a stan-
dard screwdriver and a Phillips screwdriver is the shape of the head, as shown
in Figure 3-1. You use Phillips screwdrivers with Phillips screws and standard
screwdrivers with — you guessed it — standard screws.
Offset screwdrivers, which are “S”-shaped and have different-sized tips at
each end, also are very handy because they make it easy to get to screws that
have little clearance over the head. Offset screwdrivers come in both stan-
dard and Phillips styles and some have one of each type of head at either end
(see Figure 3-2).
46
Part I: Getting to Know Your Vehicle 

Figure 3-1: Standard (a) and Phillips (b) drivers and their screws.
Using the wrong type or size screwdriver can
damage the screw, the screwdriver, and even you
if your hand slips while you’re struggling to use
the wrong tool. Always use a screwdriver with a
tip that’s the same width and type as the head of
the screw you’re working on.
Because you usually can’t use a standard screw-
driver on a Phillips screw or vice versa (although
there are some exceptions), and because your
vehicle is fitted with both types of screws in a
variety of sizes, you need several of each type of
screwdriver (not just for your vehicle, but for
almost anything around the house).
Screwdriver shafts vary in length too, which is
useful because a longer shaft provides greater
access to “buried” screws that are sunk below the
surface of some parts instead of level with them; a
shorter shaft gets into tight places more easily.
Handles also vary. It’s important to have large,
easy-to-grip handles to help you loosen tight
screws.

Chapter 3: The Way to Your Car’s Heart Is through Your Toolbox

screwdriver.

You can get all the screwdrivers you need to work on your vehicle for rela-
tively little money. Look for sales on plastic- or rubber-handled screwdrivers
in sets of varying sizes. Also available are nice gadgets that contain assorted
Phillips and standard screwdriver heads in a single, magnetized ratchet
handle. You just pop the right-sized head on the shaft and twist the handle to
turn the screwdriver automatically. This magnetized tool also serves as a
screwholder (see the next section).
Screwholders
Screwholders are perfectly marvelous for hanging onto screws that have to
fit into tiny places. Instead of holding a screw in place with the fingers of one
hand while wielding the screwdriver with your other hand, you simply fit the
screw into the screwholder and use the screwholder instead of a screwdriver
to insert and tighten the screw. One type of screwholder has a magnet to hold
the screw; another (see Figure 3-3) has a little gizmo that grabs the screw
when you twist the screwholder. Both are great and work equally well. They
come in standard and Phillips versions.
Figure 3-3: A screwholder helps you get into hard-to-reach places.
48
Part I: Getting to Know Your Vehicle 
The turning of the screw
If you find yourself confronted with a screw
that’s difficult to start unscrewing, try giving it a
slight twist in the opposite direction (clockwise),
as though you were trying to tighten it. Then
loosen it (counterclockwise). If this trick doesn’t
work, tap the screwdriver on the head with a
hammer, which may loosen the screw a bit. If
strong-arm tactics don’t get you anywhere, try
squirting the troublemaker with penetrating oil.
(Don’t use penetrating oil on a running engine
or on any really hot areas because it could
ignite.) Remember to keep your temper with dif-
ficult screws; otherwise, you risk stripping the
threads and turning a fairly simple job of replac-
ing what you’ve loosened into a hair-puller.

Wrenches
Wrenches are probably the most basic tools for auto repair. You need a couple
of different kinds in different sizes. There are several types of wrenches, and
some have very specialized uses, but the following sections cover the kinds
you need for most jobs. Look for sets made by well-known toolmakers, and try
to buy them on sale. (For more pointers on buying tools, see the earlier sec-
tion “Shopping for Tools.”)
Most wrenches are available in both standard — also known as SAE (Society of
Automotive Engineers) — and metric measurements. Before you go wrench-
shopping, know which system of measurement your vehicle is based on.
Originally, most foreign vehicles were based on the metric system (except
British ones, which had their own thread standard), whereas domestic engines
used SAE standards based on fractions of an inch. Today, most American vehi-
cles have a mix of SAE and metric nuts and bolts. Foreign vehicles or foreign
components used on American vehicles (a practice that’s becoming quite
common) use metric nuts and bolts — even the inch-based British. Check your
owner’s manual or ask your dealer to tell you whether your vehicle requires
metric or standard SAE tools before you buy anything.
Socket wrenches
A good set of socket wrenches, shown in Figure 3-4, can really make the differ-
ence between enjoying your work and killing yourself over it. Socket wrenches
come in sets for a wide variety of
prices, depending on quality and
how many wrenches are in the set.
Sets can include a mix of SAE and
metric sockets, all SAE sockets, or
all metric pieces. Unless you’ve
decided to become a mechanic,
you can buy an inexpensive set of
basic socket wrenches suitable for
your vehicle and home repairs. If
you’re not sure you’re up for any-
thing major, start with just a spark-
plug socket, a ratchet handle,
and an extension bar that lets you
easily reach the socket deeper
into the engine compartment, as
required for some spark plug
changes (see Figure 3-5).
49
Chapter 3: The Way to Your Car’s Heart Is through Your Toolbox
Figure 3-4: A socket wrench set.

Figure 3-5: A spark-plug socket (a), a ratchet handle (b), and an extension bar (c).
A good set of socket wrenches should contain the following basic items:
 A variety of 1⁄4-inch, 3⁄8-inch, or 1⁄2-inch drive sockets.
 A spark-plug socket: This large socket has a soft lining to hold the
spark plug securely without damaging its soft jacket when you remove
and insert it. Spark plugs come in two sizes, so be sure to get the size
that fits the spark plugs in your vehicle. Your owner’s manual may note
the spark plug size, or you can ask your dealership or service shop.
The word “drive” refers to the size of the square hole in each socket
where it attaches to the ratchet handle. It’s easy to remember that 
the smaller the drive, the smaller the job you use it for. You can use
adapters to convert sockets of one drive to fit handles of another drive.
 At least one ratchet handle, which allows you to turn the socket as
many times as you need to without having to remove the handle from
the socket after each turn: The ratchet handle should fit any of the
sockets. Most sets have two or three handles with at least one adapter.
You may want to add additional extensions to extend the handle to 
different sizes and adapt it to different drives.
 A flex-head handle: Although not strictly necessary, a flex-head handle
is very useful because it enables you to hold the ratchet handle at any
angle when working in tight places — and engines are full of tight places!
a

c
50
Part I: Getting to Know Your Vehicle 

 Socket extenders: These indispensable items help you get your socket
head way down into the bowels of your engine compartment to reach
those almost-unreachable nuts and bolts.
The way to identify a good socket wrench set is by the number of teeth in the
ratchet handle. Most have 20 to 30 teeth. The really good ones have up to 60
teeth. The more teeth the handle has, the better it can fit into tight places.
With more teeth, you have to move the handle only a few degrees to turn the
nut as much as a cheaper handle would in many degrees. In other words, a
ratchet handle with 24 teeth must be moved 15 degrees to reach its limit, but
a handle with 60 teeth has to be moved only 6 degrees to turn a nut as far. You
can find instructions for using a socket wrench in Chapter 6.
Combination wrenches
When shopping for wrenches, you’ll come across open-end wrenches and box-
end wrenches, but the very best kind to get are combination wrenches, which
have both an open end and a boxed end (see Figure 3-6). These wrenches
come in sets of several sizes, and each wrench is made to fit a nut of a spe-
cific size, whichever end you use. See the sidebar “Using a combination
wrench like a pro” for details.
51
Chapter 3: The Way to Your Car’s Heart Is through Your Toolbox
Using a combination wrench like a pro
Here are a few tips for using a combination
wrench:
 Always use the proper size wrench. If the
wrench you use is too big, it can slip and
round off the edges of the nut, which makes
the nut harder to tighten later on. It also can
round off the inside edges of the wrench,
with the same results. (Of course, a wrench
that’s too small won’t fit over the nut.)
 To use the open end of the wrench most
effectively, place it around the nut you want
to remove and then move the wrench to the
right so that the nut moves in a counter-
clockwise direction. If the nut sticks, give it
a squirt of penetrating oil.
 Use your free hand to keep the wrench
down over the nut. This approach gives you
some control and prevents the wrench from
flying off the nut.
 When you move the wrench as far as it can
go, you loosen the nut 15 degrees. (That’s
why the slot is at an angle.) By simply turn-
ing the wrench over so that the other sur-
face of the same end is around the nut, you
can move the nut another 15 degrees with-
out having to place the wrench at a differ-
ent angle.

Figure 3-6: Combination wrenches have one open end and one boxed end.
Torque wrenches
A torque wrench (two types of which are shown in Figure 3-7) is designed to
tighten a nut, bolt, or screw to an exact degree to avoid under-tightening or
over-tightening things.
If you’re replacing a spark
plug and you don’t tighten it
enough, it will work itself
loose and fail to deliver a
spark. If you over-tighten a
spark plug, you can strip the
threads or crack the plug.
Similarly, parts that have gas-
kets can leak if the bolts that
hold them aren’t tightened
enough. But if you over-
tighten the same bolts, the
gaskets will be crushed, caus-
ing the fluid to leak anyway.
Most really good torque
wrenches are expensive, 
but a cheaper one is good
enough to serve your pur-
poses. If you’d rather not
spend the money until you’re
sure that you really like
working on your vehicle,
borrow a torque wrench just
to get the feel of how tight 
a nut, bolt, or other part
should be. Or you can just
forget the whole thing — I’ve
never used a torque wrench; 
I use common sense.

Figure 3-7: A dial torque wrench (a) and a deflecting
beam torque wrench (b).

If you use a torque wrench, keep the following in mind (follow these tips when
you’re using any kind of wrench to tighten anything):
 Grip a torque wrench well down the shaft (not up close to the dial), and
operate it smoothly.
 Tighten a series of nuts or bolts to the specified torque in the specified
sequence, which will distribute the pressure evenly instead of in strict
clockwise or counterclockwise order.
 When tightening a series of bolts, tighten them all just until they’re snug.
Then go back and tighten them all a bit more. Then go back and tighten
them all the way to the torque specifications. Doing so ensures that the
entire part you’re tightening is under even pressure, prevents leaky gas-
kets, and increases the life of the bolt and the part.
 Before using a torque wrench, make sure that the nut or bolt turns freely
so that the torque wrench gets a true reading of the proper nut tightness.
You can use a lubricant such as WD-40 on the threads and run the nut up
and down a few times to free it before using the torque wrench on it.
Adjustable wrenches
An adjustable wrench, some-
times called a crescent wrench,
is a useful addition to your tool-
box (see Figure 3-8). You proba-
bly already have one in the
house, and you can adjust the
jaws to fit a variety of nuts and
bolts simply by turning the
wheel. I like the very small and
medium sizes because they fit into
tight spaces easily.
Pliers
Almost everyone has needle-nosed and slip-joint pliers (see Figure 3-9); if you
rummage through the family toolbox, you’ll probably discover that you have
them, too. Both types of pliers are useful for auto repair.
53
Chapter 3: The Way to Your Car’s Heart Is through Your Toolbox
Figure 3-8: An adjustable wrench.

If you have to buy pliers, the
very best kind to get are com-
bination slip-joint pliers. You
can adjust this general-pur-
pose tool to several widths
with a sliding pin. If you’re the
only person on your block
that doesn’t possess combi-
nation slip-joint pliers, by all
means rush out and buy one
before dark. Again, it needn’t
be expensive. Just make sure
that the tool works easily, is
made of forged hardened
steel, and seems to be well-
finished.
If you’re really into tools, you may also want to buy the following pliers, but
you can easily get along without them:
 Robogrip pliers are a useful variation of slip-joint pliers that automati-
cally lock in position when you have a grip on the part that you want to
manipulate.
 Adjustable vice-grip pliers are useful for persuading recalcitrant stuff to
loosen or twist, especially if, for example, you round off the edges of a
nut so that normal tools don’t loosen it. When set properly, the jaws lock
onto a metal part very tightly, and you can pull, push, or twist almost
anything with them.

slip-joint pliers (b).
Using pliers safely
Here are a couple of notes on the use of pliers:
 If you’re working on electrical wiring and
don’t want to get shocked, make sure that
the handles of your pliers are covered with
rubber to insulate them. If the handles are
naked metal, slip a length of rubber hose
over each handle, leaving the hose in one
piece. Doing so insulates the pliers, and the
rubber straightens out when you release
the pliers, causing them to spring open
quickly.
 Never use combination slip-joint pliers on
nuts and bolts — they round off the corners,
making them harder to replace. Besides,
nuts and bolts are the reason you have all
your lovely wrenches.

Gauges
Despite the simple principles behind
how an engine works (for the low-
down, head to Chapter 4), many auto
repair tasks require fairly precise
adjustments: You put only so much
oil into the engine. You add only so
much air to tires. You tighten some
nuts and bolts only so tight. And you
leave a gap of a precise size between
spark plug electrodes by using feeler
gauges. Several tools are available to
help you determine when enough oil,
fluid, air, pressure, or whatever is
enough. This section highlights those
gauges that are most useful.
Wire and taper feeler gauges
You use wire and taper feeler gauges for 
“gapping” spark plugs. These tools are very
inexpensive — some stores even give them
away free with other purchases. Although I usu-
ally discuss specialized tools in the chapters
that call for them, I want to mention these
gauges now so that you can pick them up while
you’re at an auto supply store buying other
stuff.
You can use either a wire feeler gauge (see
Figure 3-10) or a taper feeler gauge (see 
Figure 3-11) for gapping spark plugs. Gapping
simply refers to sliding the proper-sized wire or
taper gauge between the spark plug electrodes
to make sure that the surfaces are the proper distance apart. Gapping
ensures that the spark can jump across the gap with the proper intensity.
All cars sold in the U.S. since 1975 have been equipped with electronic igni-
tion systems. So, unless you’ve got an even older model, the ignition timing
never needs adjustment.

gauge.

Tire pressure gauges
If you never check anything else on your vehicle, make a habit of regularly
checking the tire pressure; it’s critical both for safety and good fuel economy.
Tire pressure gauges come in several styles. The most basic, shown in Fig-
ure 3-12, looks like a big chrome pen, with a bulbous end that fits over the
tire’s valve stem and a plastic or metal rod, marked in pounds per square
inch of pressure, that pops out to show you the pressure in the tire. You can
find instructions on how to check your tire pressure in Chapter 17.
Figure 3-12: A tire pressure gauge.
Compression gauges
You use compression gauges, shown in Figure 3-13, to check the pressure
that builds up in each cylinder as your engine runs. These gauges also reveal
worn or damaged piston rings and valves. If your vehicle is new, you proba-
bly won’t have this problem for some time, but if you have an older or second-
hand vehicle, this easy-to-use gauge is a good investment because it can help
you spot trouble and save money. Chapter 8 has instructions for using a gauge
to check compression. The screw-in kind shown on the right in Figure 3-13 is
easiest to use but usually costs a bit more.
56

Figure 3-13: Compression gauges.
Work Lights
Whether you plan to work on your vehicle at home in your garage, in your
driveway, at the curb near your house, or in the auto shop at a local school, 
I can guarantee that the lighting will be inadequate once you get under the
hood — or under the car, if you’re that adventurous. A work light provides
all the illumination you need and enables you to shine the maximum amount
of light right on the work area and not in your eyes.
You’ll find that a work light is useful for a variety of home repairs and for
working outside after dark, but if you’ll be working far from an electrical
outlet, you’ll need either a long extension cord for the work light or a 12-volt
battery-operated fluorescent light. Fluorescent work lights can draw power
from the car’s battery or cigarette lighter or plug into a wall socket. They also
come with changeable batteries, like flashlights.
If you get a work light that gets its power from your vehicle’s battery, it won’t
be useful for repairs in your home. Portable battery-powered fluorescent
lanterns are useful for night work and for camping, but I don’t recommend
one because the batteries can go dead from disuse or if you need to work for
a long time. Luckily, most extension cords and work lights are inexpensive, so
you may want to get more than one type. Figure 3-14 shows two types of work
lights.
57
Chapter 3: The Way to Your Car’s Heart Is through Your Toolbox

Figure 3-14: Work lights.
When you shop for a work light, be sure to get one that has
 A protective cage around at least half the bulb.
 A power cord that’s long enough and properly insulated. Go for at least 
a 25-foot cord. Lights with shorter cords are cheaper, but if you need to
buy an extension cord to get the light to your vehicle, you may end up
spending more in the long run. (Battery-operated work lights are also
available that don’t require power cords.)
 The Underwriter’s tag, which ensures that you’re getting quality 
equipment.
The typical work light cage has a hook at the top so that you can hang the
light from the inside of the hood or on a nearby part. The hook is very handy,
but don’t hook the light to anything that carries electricity or to anything that
could be ripped from its moorings if the light cord gets yanked too hard!
Jacks
Most new vehicles come with a jack to be used when changing tires. If you
have a secondhand car, or if your jack has been lying around neglected, you
may need to buy one. When shopping for a new jack, you can buy the scissor
type, but I suggest that you invest in a hydraulic jack, which is faster and
safer and not terribly expensive. Illustrations of different types of jacks appear
in Chapter 1. Be sure to buy one that can handle the weight of your vehicle.
Whatever type you buy, make sure that the jack is suited to your vehicle’s
body design. To determine the type of jack you need and to find out how to
use the jack that came with the vehicle, check your owner’s manual or ask
someone at an auto parts store.
58
Part I: Getting to Know Your Vehicle 

Check your jack periodically, never use it without the base plate, and never
jack up your vehicle unless the wheels are properly blocked. You can find
instructions and safety tips for using a jack and changing a tire in Chapter 1.
Your jack should be in the trunk of your vehicle at all times. There’s nothing
more depressing than knowing how to change a flat and realizing that you’ve
left your jack in your garage when you get a flat tire on the side of the road.
Jack Stands
If you plan to remove a wheel for any reason, you need a pair of jack stands
as well as a jack. The stands hold the vehicle off the ground with less danger
of slipping and enable you to jack up more than one side of the vehicle at a
time. Chapter 1 shows you what they look like and how to use them.
Remember to get two jack stands — you’ll need them both.
Substituting boxes, stones, or bricks for jack stands is very dangerous. They
can slip out or break while you’re under the vehicle. A jack can do the same
thing, and when it really comes down to it, jack stands aren’t all that stable,
either. So I recommend that, instead of doing anything under your vehicle
that involves more than just reaching under the vehicle for a few minutes
(like opening and replacing the oil drain plug or changing an oil filter), you
seriously consider paying a professional to put your vehicle on a hoist and
do the job. If you can work under your vehicle without having to jack it up,
you should also get a creeper.
Creepers
A creeper is basically just a board
with casters (wheels that can
move in several directions) on the
underside (see Figure 3-15). If you
have an SUV with sufficient clear-
ance under it to allow you to scoot
around underneath without having
to jack it up, a creeper comes in
handy when removing mud and
debris from the undercarriage.
If you have some carpentry skills, you can make a creeper from some ply-
wood and a couple of old roller-skate wheels. If you’re fed up with buying
things and you don’t want to make a creeper, try lying on an old bed board or
a ratty old blanket instead.
59
Chapter 3: The Way to Your Car’s Heart Is through Your Toolbox
Figure 3-15: A creeper.

If you’re not yet game for a lot of under-the-car work and you just want to
change your tires, change your oil, and be done with it, forget about the
creeper. Get a jack and jack stands that work properly, and know how to use
them safely (see Chapter 1).
Fire Extinguishers
A fire extinguisher isn’t really a tool, but it’s a must for your vehicle. Get the
23⁄4-pound dry-chemical ABC-rated type.
An engine fire won’t necessarily ruin your vehicle — if you can extinguish it
quickly. A gasoline leak can be ignited by a stray spark from your spark plug
wires. The resulting fire looks awful, but it’s really burning on the outside of
your engine. If you put it out quickly, your vehicle may suffer little or no
damage.
Cigarette butts may land on your backseat, causing a fire, and fires can be
caused by ruptured fuel lines and faulty wiring as well, so an inexpensive fire
extinguisher not only may save you money but also may save your life. If the
flames are anywhere near the fuel tank, forget the heroics; just run for it and
throw yourself to the ground if you think that the tank may explode.
Because the fuel tank is usually located right under the rear of most vehicles,
keep your extinguisher under the front seat so that you can get to it when you
need it. It should be in a suitable bracket that will prevent it from rolling
under the pedals.
Funnels
You use funnels to fill your coolant recovery bottle and add oil, brake fluid,
windshield washer fluid, and transmission fluid. Steal a large funnel from
the kitchen and dedicate it to auto work, or buy one at an auto supply or
hardware store. Either metal or plastic is fine as long as you clean it thor-
oughly after each use.
Some automotive funnels come with a short hose attached so that you can
insert the hose directly into a narrow opening in a space that’s too small for
the funnel to fit into.

More Things to Carry in Your Vehicle
You can pack your auto repair toolbox with the best tools that money can
buy, but all those fancy gadgets and gizmos won’t do you any good if they’re
at home when your vehicle breaks down 30 miles from civilization. Don’t
tempt fate: Keep basic tools and materials onboard at all times.
In addition to the tools mentioned earlier in this chapter, be sure to keep the
following items on board (you probably have most of this stuff already, so
there’s no excuse for being unprepared):
 Rags: Rags should be clean and lint-free. Keep a clean, lint-free rag in
your vehicle to wipe your oil or transmission dipstick or to clean the
inside of your windshield if it clouds up.
Get rid of gasoline-soaked rags, which are highly combustible. Never
keep them in closed places. Don’t use an oily rag on anything that isn’t
oily already. Because your vehicle contains a variety of substances that
must be kept away from other substances, throw out or wash dirty rags,
and use a clean one each time you start a job.
 Spare parts: If you replace your spark plugs, save the old ones if they’re
not too worn. Carry them in your trunk-compartment toolbox for quick
replacements if something goes wrong with the ones in your engine. If
you have to use the old plugs in an emergency, be sure to replace them
as soon as possible because they won’t hold up well. The same goes for
old, not-too-cruddy air filters and other minor gizmos. A couple of extra
nuts, bolts, and screws also are useful to have on hand in case you lose
the ones you have or strip them accidentally.
 Emergency parts: Carry a spare set of windshield wiper blades, an extra
radiator cap, and extra fuses. If you plan to travel for a while in hot
weather in remote regions, top and bottom radiator hoses might be a
good idea. These items are inexpensive and could get you out of a lot of
trouble on a long trip. Although they’re more costly, it’s good to carry
extra accessory belts, too. Emergency road services may not replace
these things on the road, and if the parts you need aren’t available in the
area, you’ll have them on hand when you reach a repair facility.
 Spare tire: Check your spare tire often. It’s humiliating to go through the
work of changing a tire only to find that your spare is flat, too. If your
spare is worn beyond belief, most garages will sell you a not-too-hideous
secondhand tire at a low price. Make sure that it’s the right size.
 Lug wrench: A lug wrench is sometimes provided, along with a jack, 
on new vehicles (see Figure 3-16). You use it to remove the wheel or lug
nuts when you change a tire. If you buy a lug wrench, get the cross-shaft
kind, which gives you more leverage. If your vehicle has alloy wheels
with lovely, shiny chrome lug nuts, be sure your wrench is the right size
and type so that it doesn’t scratch them. (Chapter 1 has instructions for
using a lug wrench.)
61
Chapter 3: The Way to Your Car’s Heart Is through Your Toolbox

 A can of inflator/sealant:
This item saves you the 
trouble — and possible
danger — of changing a flat
on the road. It attaches easily
to the valve stem on your flat
tire and inflates the tire with
goop that temporarily seals
the puncture. Choose a
brand that enables you to
drive at least 50 miles — that
should get you to a repair
shop. Be sure to tell them
that you used inflator/sealant
and ask them to remove it
when they fix the flat.
 Jumper cables: One of the
most common automotive
malfunctions is the loss of
power to start the engine,
either from an old or faulty
battery or from leaving the
headlights on by mistake. If
you’re in this situation, and if
your owner’s manual indicates
that you can jump a start with-
out harming your onboard
computer, you can wait for AAA
or CAA roadside assistance (if
you’re a member) or a nearby
garage to come and bail you
out; or, if you’re in a safe, well-
populated area, you can stop 
a passing vehicle, whip out 
your jumper cables (shown in
Figure 3-17), attach them in sec-
onds, and “jump a start” from
the Good Samaritan’s vehicle to
your own. Many people are will-
ing to lend their cars to this sort
of operation because they lose
nothing but a few minutes of
their time, but it’s up to you to
decide whether you want to risk
getting carjacked if the Good
Samaritan turns out to be a
devil in disguise. Your alterna-
tive, of course, is to use your

cellphone to call roadside assistance or the highway patrol to send help.
Chapter 23 has instructions for the proper way to jump a start.
You can buy a set of jumper cables for much less than you’d have to pay
a garage to send someone to start your car. Good cables cost more
because they have more strands of better-conducting wire, which let
more juice flow between the vehicles with less loss of voltage.
Sometimes the success or failure of an attempt to jump a start depends
on the quality of the jumper cables and their grips. If you get a cheap
set, here’s an easy way to make them work better: Get under the plastic
sheath that covers the place where the cables meet the grips and
squeeze the connection tight with pliers. Doing so improves the connec-
tion, and sometimes the cheap set of cables works beautifully — at least
for the first few times. Ultimately, the best way to stay out of trouble is
to pay a little extra for a quality set of cables.
 Snow and ice equipment: If you live in an area that’s cold in winter,
carry tire chains or a bag of sand in case of icy conditions. (Rock salt is
no longer used for this purpose because it corrodes metal and is consid-
ered an environmental hazard.) A small shovel also may prove useful for
digging your tires out, and a scraper allows you to clear your windshield
of snow and/or ice. A can of de-icer is useful in icy weather.
 Flashlights and reflectors: A flashlight in your glove compartment can
help your kids locate dropped toys on the floor of the car, enable you to
see under the hood if your vehicle breaks down, and serve as an emer-
gency light for oncoming traffic if you have to stop on the road for
repairs. (A flashlight with a red blinker is safest for the last purpose.) 
Of course, you have to put in fresh batteries now and then and carry a
couple of extras.
An inexpensive set of reflector triangles can save your life by making
your stopped vehicle visible on the road. Flares can be dangerous, and
many states have rules regarding their use on highways.
 First-aid kit: Keep a first-aid kit in your workshop and in your vehicle.
Choose one that’s equipped with a variety of bandages, tweezers, surgi-
cal tape, antibiotic ointment, something soothing for burns, and a good
antiseptic. You can find inexpensive kits at drugstores and auto parts
stores.
 Hand cleaner: Most hand cleaners are basically grease solvents. They
range from heavy-duty stuff that removes the skin along with the grease,
to soothing, good-smelling creams that leave your skin feeling reborn, to
precleaners that you use before you start working so that the grease
slides off your hands easily afterward. Some of these cleaners can also
be rubbed into work clothes to remove grease and oil stains before you
launder them.
63
Chapter 3: The Way to Your Car’s Heart Is through Your Toolbox

 Gloves: Keep a pair of gloves in the vehicle for emergencies. Industrial
rubber gloves, available at swimming pool supply stores, aren’t affected
by gasoline, solvent, or battery acid. They’re your safest bet. Thin, tough,
and comfortable dishwashing gloves are available at any discount store or
supermarket. They cost little and keep the grease from under your finger-
nails. One problem, however, is that gasoline or solvent may melt them.
 Spare tools: If you can’t carry your toolbox in your vehicle all the time,
or if it’s too large or too heavy to waste fuel toting around, place a
couple of screwdrivers, some standard-size combination wrenches, an
adjustable wrench, and a can of penetrating oil in a lightweight toolbox
in your trunk compartment.
Auto parts stores carry some very handy gizmos that combine a variety
of basic tools into one all-purpose, weird-looking instrument that can
save weight and space in your trunk compartment.
 Hat: To keep the dust and grease out of your hair, and to prevent long
hair from being caught in moving parts, wear a hat that you can afford 
to get dirty. A wooly watch cap or a baseball hat worn backwards works
just fine. At the very least, keep a hair band in the glove compartment 
to tie back your hair. In this case, safety trumps vanity.
 Cellphone: A cellphone literally can be a lifesaver when you’re stuck on
a road somewhere with a dead vehicle or when you have an accident. It
enables you to call for help without having to rely on the kindness of
strangers. (It’s also handy for calling your loved ones or next appoint-
ment to tell them that you’re going to be delayed.) Some cellphones
have built-in AAA roadside assistance or 911 call buttons.
 Miscellaneous stuff: Rolls of duct tape and electrician’s tape, a sharp
knife, and scissors come in handy. A disposable camera lets you collect
evidence for insurance claims if you’re involved in an accident. Keep a
pen, a small pad, and some extra change on hand for parking meters or
pay phones.

O
ne of the major events that marked the transition of early man from
“wise monkey” to a more civilized critter was gaining the ability to get
something else to do his work for him. Along with such major technological
breakthroughs as the club and spear, the control of fire, and the invention of
the loincloth was the eventual use of round logs (later cut into slices called
“wheels”) to move things and people. Wheeled carts of various types were
pushed or pulled by humans and animals for centuries until some early sci-
ence-fiction freak decided to invent a machine that could move itself, and the
first engine appeared.
Today, most people possess vehicles that can move themselves. True, you
have to tell your vehicle when to go and when to stop, and you have to steer
it in the proper direction and keep it in good running order, but any vehicle is
basically a set of wheels with an engine to turn them.
The internal combustion engine (ICE), which still forms the heart of most
vehicles, is a fairly efficient, relatively uncomplicated piece of machinery. It
works on a mixture of fuel and air to produce enough power to turn a shaft
that turns the wheels. The basic gizmos on your vehicle are simply the things
that bring the fuel and air together in the proper quantities, ignite them, and
channel the resulting power to the wheels. The rest of the stuff is there to
make this happen with ease and efficiency, to provide you with some control
over what’s going on, and to give you a place to sit and to stow your groceries.

Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Because diesels and most alternatively fueled vehicles have pretty much the
same basic systems as ICEs do — with the exception of the fuel system — and
because ICEs still make up the majority of vehicles on the road (although I
hope this will change given the dwindling supply of petroleum and the growing
concerns about smog-causing emissions and global warming!), this chapter
gives you a brief overview of how each of the basic automotive systems func-
tions and how these systems work together to make your vehicle run. Don’t
worry about the type of vehicle you own; with the exception of the fuel system,
every vehicle works on the same principles. (I cover clean diesels in Chapter 9
and alternatively fueled vehicles in Chapter 10.)
Because it’s much easier to do any job if you understand what you’re doing
and why you’re doing it, I advise you not to jump right into the instructions in
this book for doing specific jobs before you get to know the system involved.
Take it in easy stages. Reading this chapter will enable you to view your vehi-
cle as a series of simple systems, each with a specific job to do, so you can
stop seeing it as a dismaying collection of wires, hoses, and gizmos and be
able to deal with it easily and confidently. When you have a general idea of
how things work, the individual chapters in this book that explore each
system in detail will be easier to understand. And when you’re familiar with
how a system functions, you’ll be ready to tackle the chapter that shows you
how to work on that system.
To get the most from this chapter, take this book out to your vehicle and try
to find as many of the parts as possible. (If you don’t know how to get the
hood open, you can find instructions in Chapter 1 or in the owner’s manual,
which may also help you locate parts.) Just touching the weird-looking
gizmos under the hood helps you get past any doubts and fears you may
have about getting more intimately involved with your vehicle. But then, isn’t
it always that way?
Keeping Your Owner’s Manual Handy
Although you certainly don’t need them to get through this book, it’s good to
have both an owner’s manual and a service manual for every vehicle you
own. If you don’t have an owner’s manual, ask your dealership to get one for
you or to tell you how to get one from the manufacturer. If you have an older
vehicle, you can find new or used service manuals or instruction books for it
in bookstores. Public libraries often have surprisingly large collections of
service manuals, too. Service manuals for many vehicles also are available
from automotive publishers in paperback, on disc, or online.
I strongly suggest that you get the service manual because every auto repair
facility can’t stock a service manual for each year, make, and model of every
66
Part I: Getting to Know Your Vehicle 

vehicle, and if you lend your service manual to an independent service facil-
ity that’s working on your vehicle, you can save money by reducing the time
it would take them to figure out the proper way to make a repair. Also, if you
get to the point where you want to do more than basic repairs, a service
manual becomes indispensable. The drawings in service manuals show you
where every little screw and washer fits so that you don’t end up with a
couple of “extra” parts at the end of the job; the manual also shows you 
how to do each job in the most efficient manner. The “How to Take Anything
Apart — and Get It Back Together Again” section in Chapter 1 helps you to
keep track of parts and get them back in the proper order.
Every vehicle manufacturer makes sure to do something a little bit differently
than the competition does so that it can get patents and say that its vehicles
are the best. Also, the location and looks of the engine and transmission in
rear-engine vehicles and front-wheel drive vehicles are different from those
with traditional front engines and rear-wheel drive. Electric vehicles (EV)
have electric motors instead of engines, and hybrids have both! Therefore, if
any part on your vehicle isn’t exactly where it is in the pictures in this chap-
ter, or if a part doesn’t look quite the same, don’t panic. Believe me, all the
parts are there — otherwise your vehicle wouldn’t go.
If you have trouble finding something, your owner’s manual should have a
diagram (which was probably gibberish to you until you bought this book)
showing the location of each principal part. You also can ask a friend who
has a similar vehicle or your friendly automotive technician to point out
these “missing” parts. I’m willing to bet, however, that if you read this chap-
ter carefully with an eye on your own vehicle, you’ll be able to locate almost
all the parts yourself.
If you’re planning to work on your vehicle and want instructions for making
specific repairs, you can get a subscription for $19.95/year per vehicle that
allows you to download instructions for specific tasks from Chilton, one of the
major publishers of automotive service manuals. Visit www.chiltondiy.
com for more information.
Enough about manuals. Get ready to take a quick trip through the basic parts
and systems on your vehicle. When you finish this chapter, you’ll truly know
“What Makes It Go.”
Introducing the Engine 
Control Unit (ECU)
Meet the engine control unit (ECU, also called Powertrain Control Module,
or PCM), which is the key player in virtually every system involved in running
your vehicle. In an automotive sense, the ECU is the all-knowing, powerful
67
Chapter 4: What Makes It Go? The Inner Secrets of Your Car Revealed!

“god” that makes it go. You’ll find it plays a vital role in most of the systems
explored in this chapter, so I thought I’d introduce you to it first.
The ECU is the most powerful computer on modern vehicles. It uses a variety
of sensors to monitor and control most of the engine functions, including the
electrical, fuel, and emissions control systems. Among other tasks, the ECU
controls the fuel injectors on fuel-injected engines; fires the spark plugs; and
controls valve timing, the fuel/air mixture, battery charging, and even the
cooling fan. It’s the key to the diagnostics that pinpoint problems and is pri-
marily responsible for managing the fuel efficiency and performance of your
vehicle. If the ECU malfunctions, it usually needs to be replaced.
What Makes Your Vehicle Start?
Although people tend to think that most vehicles are totally powered by fuel,
many parts — the radio, headlights, air conditioner, windshield wipers,
power seats and windows, clock, and so on — actually function on electricity,
which is provided by the electrical system. The electrical system includes
several subsystems that provide your vehicle with that vital spark that makes
it start, keeps it running, and powers all electrical devices. It’s one of the
many systems on a vehicle that’s monitored and controlled by the ECU (see
the previous section). Figure 4-1 shows you the electrical system.
Figure 4-1: The electrical system.

1. When you turn the key in
your vehicle’s ignition
switch to Start or acti-
vate the ignition by push-
ing a button, you close a
circuit that allows the
current to pass from your
battery to your starter
via the starter solenoid
switch (see Figure 4-2).
2. The starter makes the
engine turn over (that’s
the growling sound 
you hear before the
engine starts running
smoothly). Chapter 5 tells
you exactly how it does this.
3. The electric current stops flowing to the starter but continues to flow
through the charging system (which uses an alternator to generate
power and charge the battery) and to the rest of the electrical system.
4. Now the fuel system comes into play (see Figure 4-3): If you drive a vehi-
cle with an internal combustion engine (ICE), whether your vehicle is
more than 20 years old or just 20 days old, has fuel-injection or a car-
buretor, it probably has the same basic parts in its fuel system with one
exception: On modern vehicles, the fuel system — along with most other
systems — is controlled by the ECU. Chapter 7 explores the fuel system
in detail, and Chapter 8 tells you how to keep it in tune.

6. Each pound of fuel is mixed with 14.7 pounds of air to form a vaporized
mixture, like a mist. Because fuel is much heavier than air, this mixture
works out to something like 1 gallon of fuel to 2,000 gallons of air (which
is the equivalent of a gallon of gas to a roomful of air). In other words,
your engine really runs on air, with a little fuel to help it!
7. The fuel/air mixture passes
into the cylinders in your
engine. A cylinder, as shown
in Figure 4-4, is a hollow pipe
with one open end and one
closed end. Inside each cylin-
der is a piston, which fits
very snugly and moves up
and down. The piston moves
up, trapping the fuel/air mix-
ture in the upper part of the
cylinder and compressing it
into a very small space.
8. A spark from a spark plug
ignites the fuel/air mixture,
causing it to burn and
expand rapidly.
9. This expansion of gases forces the piston back down again, with more
power than when it went up.
10. Attached to the bottom
of the piston is a con-
necting rod that’s
attached to a crank-
shaft, which leads,
eventually, to the drive
wheels of your vehicle.
As the piston and the
connecting rod go up
and down, they cause
the crankshaft to turn.
As shown in Figure 4-5,
this is pretty much the
same motion you use to
pedal a bike: Your knee
goes up and down while
your foot pedals around and around.
11. To the rear of the crankshaft is the transmission, called a transaxle on
vehicles with front-wheel drive. If your vehicle has rear-wheel drive
(see Figure 4-6), the transmission is under the floor ahead of the front

seat. If it has a transverse engine and front-wheel drive (see Figure 4-7),
the transmission is under the engine. On rear-engine vehicles, both the
engine and the transmission are under the rear deck lid, where the trunk
ordinarily is found.
Figure 4-6: Cutaway view of a car with rear-wheel drive.
Figure 4-7: Cutaway view of a car with front-wheel drive.
12. If your vehicle has a manual transmission, you’ll also find the clutch
located between the crankshaft and the transmission. The clutch con-
nects or disconnects the engine from the rest of the drive train. Because
the parts are all stretched out in a row and easy to see, Figure 4-8 shows
you the drive train on a vehicle with rear-wheel drive and a manual trans-
mission. Remember, in a car with an automatic transmission, the clutch
action is done automatically.

13. When you shift into Drive (or First, if you have a manual transmission), a
set of gears causes the rest of the crankshaft (which is called the drive-
shaft after it leaves the transmission) to turn at a particular speed.
14. The driveshaft runs to the rear wheels of conventional rear-wheel-driven
vehicles and ends in another set of gears called the differential. The dif-
ferential turns the power of the engine and the transmission 90 degrees
into the axles that connect to drive wheels of the vehicle. Because on
most vehicles the axle is set at right angles to the driveshaft, you can
see that the differential is really changing the direction of the power so
that the drive wheels can turn.
Chapter 18 looks at all types of drive trains and transmissions in detail,
including all-wheel drive, four-wheel drive, and continuously vari-
able transmissions (CVT). In that chapter, Figure 18-3 shows you how
the differential changes the direction of the power 90 degrees.
Vehicles with front-wheel drive or with rear
engines don’t require a long driveshaft
because the power source is located right
between the drive wheels that drive the vehi-
cle. On these vehicles, the transmission and
the differential are combined into a single unit
called the transaxle, which connects directly
to provide power to the drive wheels. Figure
4-9 shows you how power flows through a
transaxle.
15. The drive wheels turn and push the vehicle
forward (or backward), and off you go. And all
you had to do was turn on the ignition and
step on the gas!

What Makes Your Vehicle Run?
The following sections take a closer look at what various automotive systems
do to keep your vehicle moving happily down the road. Because these sys-
tems work simultaneously and just keep on doing the same thing over and
over, there’s no need to take them step-by-step.
The ignition system
After your engine has started running, the ignition system continues to 
provide high voltage to the spark plugs so that they can provide the spark
that causes the fuel/air mixture to burn. To do so on modern vehicles with
distributorless ignition systems, the ECU or a dedicated ignition control
module (ICM) receives signals from sensors and controls when the spark
plugs fire and ignite the fuel/air mixture in the cylinders, which provides
the power to drive the engine. Figure 4-10 shows a distributorless ignition
system.
Figure 4-10: The distributorless electronic ignition system.
Chapter 5 examines both distributorless electronic ignition systems and ones
with distributors and explores the rest of the electrical system and subsys-
tems in greater detail. Chapter 6 shows you how to keep the various parts of

The cooling system
The combustion of fuel and air takes place at around 4,500°F, so the excess
heat must be removed or the engine would melt down. This is accomplished
by the circulation of liquid coolant through water jackets that surround the
cylinders which carry the heat to the radiator, which dissipates it. A water
pump keeps the coolant circulating while a cooling fan keeps the air flowing
through the radiator when you’re idling in traffic. You can see the entire cool-
ing system in Figure 4-11. Modern vehicles also have a transmission cooler to
keep the transmission from overheating.
Chapter 11 explores the cooling system in greater detail, and Chapter 12
shows you how to do simple jobs like flushing the system and replacing the
coolant. It also shows you what to do if your vehicle overheats.
Figure 4-11: The cooling system.
The lubrication system
Oil constantly circulates through your
engine to keep its moving parts (pis-
tons, connecting rods, crankshaft, and
the like) lubricated to move freely and
to reduce the friction that causes your
engine to heat up. An oil pump keeps
the oil circulating, and an oil filter
keeps it clean. Figure 4-12 shows you
what a lubrication system looks like.
Chapter 13 tells you what oil does and
how to change your oil and oil filter. For
a close-up look at various steering and
suspension systems, see Chapter 16.

The exhaust system
The exhaust system, shown in Figure 4-13, is your vehicle’s waste-disposal
system. Exhaust gases from the burnt fuel/air mixture that was ignited in
the cylinders pass through exhaust pipes to the tailpipe at the rear of the
vehicle.
Because exhaust gases contain toxic substances and affect global warming,
on the way to the tailpipe, emissions controls such as a PCV valve, various
sensors, a catalytic converter, and other gizmos remove some of the harmful
substances and recycle unburned fuel vapors before they can get into the air.
A muffler controls the noise of the escaping gases; if it fails, you can get a
ticket, probably for disturbing the peace! A muffler also has an effect on the
pressure required to pass the exhaust gases through it: It creates the “back
pressure” that the engine requires to run efficiently and affects the tempera-
ture and therefore the efficiency of the catalytic converter.
You get a closer look at all the parts of the exhaust system in Chapter 7.

Today, vehicles not only have hydraulic brakes — many have electronic
brake systems, as well. Most modern vehicles come with anti-lock braking
systems (ABS) that can prevent skids in slippery conditions and keep you in
control of your vehicle until you can stop safely. Electric vehicles (EV) and
hybrids feature regenerative braking systems that generate electric current
to drive their electric motors.
For details on all the various braking systems and parts, including power
brakes and parking brakes, check out Chapter 14. Chapter 15 has instruc-
tions on checking your brakes and doing other related jobs, and Chapter 10
has a section on regenerative braking systems.
Figure 4-14 shows you the major parts of a system with drum brakes at the
rear wheels and disc brakes up front. Use it as you review the steps that
follow, which give you a basic view of how a brake system operates.

1. To stop your vehicle, you step on the brake pedal.
2. The brake pedal pushes against a piston in a cylinder located under the
hood. This part is called the master cylinder, and it’s filled with a liquid
called brake fluid.
3. When the piston in the master cylinder is pushed by your brake pedal, it
forces the brake fluid out of the master cylinder into tubes called brake
lines, which run to each wheel. (A power brake booster located
between the brake pedal and the master cylinder increases the force
applied to the piston in the master cylinder so that it takes less effort to
stop your vehicle.)
4. Each wheel has either a disc brake or a drum brake. To keep it simple, 
I just look at disc brakes here. (Drum brakes work on the same general
principles, as I explain in Chapter 14.) A disc brake is composed of a flat,
iron disc (surprise!) sandwiched between a pair of brake pads by a
caliper, as shown in Figure 4-15. The caliper contains one, two, or four
pistons that force the friction material on the pads against the disc. 
Figure 4-15: A disc brake.
5. Brake pads located in the caliper on both sides of the disc grab the disc
and force it to stop turning. This forces the wheel to stop turning. When
the wheels stop turning, the vehicle comes to a stop.
6. When you take your foot off the brake pedal, the whole process is
reversed: The brake pads release their hold on the disc, the fluid moves
back up the brake lines to the master cylinder, and the wheels can turn
freely again.

Four-wheel disc brakes are standard on most new vehicles. Other vehicles
have disc brakes on the front wheels and drum brakes on the rear wheels. A
few older vehicles have drum brakes all around.
Now that you have a general picture of how the various systems in your vehi-
cle work together, don’t stop here! The rest of this book goes into detail
about each of the systems outlined in this chapter and what you can do to
repair them and keep them running smoothly. Be sure to read the chapter on

In This Chapter
 Keeping systems in synch with the engine control unit (ECU)
 Checking out the major electrical subsystems: Starting, charging, and ignition
 Paying attention to indicator lights on the dashboard
 Getting enlightened with fuses, directional signals, and headlights
T
he electrical system includes several subsystems that provide your vehi-
cle with that vital spark that makes it start and then keeps it running. It’s
one of the many systems on a vehicle that’s monitored and controlled by a
kind of “super computer” called the engine control unit, or ECU for short.
You encounter this god-like critter in several chapters of this book, so you
should meet it before you get to the various systems that form the electrical
system.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Introducing the Engine Control Unit
(ECU)
The engine control unit (ECU) is the most powerful computer on a vehicle. It
uses a variety of sensors to monitor and control most of the engine functions
of the car, including the electrical, fuel, and emissions control systems.
Among other tasks, the ECU fires the fuel injectors on fuel-injected engines,
fires the spark plugs, and controls valve timing, emissions controls, the
fuel/air mixture, and even the cooling fan. The ECU itself rarely malfunc-
tions, is the key to the diagnostics that pinpoint problems, and is primarily
responsible for managing the fuel efficiency and performance of your vehicle.

Moving on to the electrical system (see Figure 5-1), here are some of the ser-
vices that the individual systems and major parts involved in the electrical
system perform:
 The starting system, unsurprisingly, provides the initial power to get
your engine started.
 The ignition system fires the spark plugs so they can cause the fuel and
air to “combust” and drive your engine.
 The charging system generates electrical power for the various systems
in your vehicle that depend on electric current, and it regulates the
power flowing to the battery to keep it from running down.
 The battery stores excess current for future needs.
 Various circuits run a mixed bag of electrical gadgets, like your vehicle’s
horn, headlights, and so on, most of which are protected by fuses.

The Starting System
The starting system, shown in
Figure 5-2, is the portion of the
electrical system that gets
your vehicle started. When
you turn your key in the igni-
tion switch to “Start” (or acti-
vate the ignition by pushing a
button), the action closes a
circuit that lets electrical cur-
rent flow from your car’s bat-
tery to its starter. On the way,
the current passes through a
device called the starter sole-
noid. Basically, all the sole-
noid does is pass the current
along and move the starter
gears into contact with the flywheel. You don’t adjust or replace it unless it
breaks down.
Because actually seeing and touching something is worth a thousand words,
it’s a good idea to take this book out to your vehicle and trace the path of the
electric current to each part in the system. Don’t be shy now! (If you need
them, you can find instructions for opening the hood in Chapter 1.) I know
the area looks like a maze of wires, bottles, and boxes, but once you can iden-
tify the major parts, it won’t be as scary anymore.
As you try to trace the wiring through the starting system, if you find a
couple of parts that I haven’t mentioned yet, just hang in there. Like the sole-
noid, you don’t have to fuss with these parts unless they fail; and if they fail,
they have to be replaced by a professional.
The following sections give you a closer look at each part of the starting
system. Be sure to read them before undertaking any of the electrical work cov-
ered in Chapter 6.
The battery
The battery is the big box that sits under the hood, usually up near the front
of the vehicle. It’s filled with acid, distilled water, and a set of plates that are
combined into “cells” (see Figure 5-3) that produce electric current for start-
ing the car, turning on the lights, and powering the ignition system. The bat-
tery also stabilizes the voltage in the electrical system and provides current
whenever the electrical demands exceed the output of the charging system.
Quite a helpful gadget!

Figure 5-3: Cutaway view of a battery.
On the battery, attached to either the top or the sides of the box are two
large metal terminals. One is a positive terminal; the other is a negative 
terminal. You can tell which is which because the positive terminal is usually
larger and may have a “+,” “POS,” or the word “Positive” on or near it. The
negative terminal usually has “–” or “NEG” on it.
On many vehicles, there’s a red cap on the positive terminal, and the battery
cable leading to it may be red as well. The cable to the negative terminal is
usually black. The clamps on the cables that you use to jump-start a dead
battery are usually colored red and black so that you can easily match them
to the terminals. You can find instructions for jump-starting a dead battery in
Chapter 21.
Most vehicles are negative ground, which means that the wire from the nega-
tive terminal is attached to the frame of the vehicle to ground it; the wire
from the positive terminal leads to the starter, ignition, and so on.
Today, most batteries are sealed and don’t require much maintenance. However,
deposits do form on the terminals, and they can impede the flow of current.
Chapter 6 tells you how to check your battery and remove these deposits.

The starter
After the battery sends the current
to the starter solenoid (refer to
Figure 5-2), the current goes to the
starter. The starter is the device
that makes your engine turn over.
(Figure 5-4 shows what a starter
looks like, and Figure 5-5 shows
how a starter works.) It’s an electri-
cal motor with a gear called a starter
drive at one end. The starter drive
engages a ring gear on a flywheel
that’s bolted to the back of the
engine crankshaft. When you turn
your key in the ignition switch (or push the ignition button on some vehi-
cles), the starter drive slides down the shaft and engages the ring gear. This
spins the flywheel, which starts the crankshaft turning so that the pistons
can go up and down, the spark plugs can fire, and the engine can start run-
ning. As soon as the engine is started, the starter has done its job.
If you use a key to start your vehicle, you should let go of the key immediately
after the engine starts. As your key returns to the “On” (or “Run”) position
(where it stays until you shut off the engine), the starter drive disengages
from the flywheel, and your engine continues running on the fuel and air that
are being pumped into its cylinders.
85
Chapter 5: The Electrical System: Your Car’s Spark of Life
I know what the problem is; 
I just don’t know where it is . . .
After I took my first class on the electrical
system, I went out one morning and found that
my car, Tweety Bird, wouldn’t start. I remem-
bered my instructor saying that if you hear a
clicking noise (that’s your solenoid) but your
engine won’t start running, you probably have a
loose wire somewhere between the ignition
switch and the starter. So I opened the hood (it
was only the second time I’d gotten that far) and
peeked in. Sure enough, I saw a cluster of wires
on the firewall in front of my steering wheel. I
could see where the wires ran along the frame
of the car to the battery, but after that I got lost.
I ended up calling the AAA.
When the AAA truck arrived, I proudly informed
the technician that I knew what was wrong. “It’s
just a loose wire between my battery and my
starter,” I announced. “Then why didn’t you fix
it yourself?” he asked. “Because I don’t know
which gadget is the starter!” He was nice
enough to keep from laughing, and I felt better
when the problem did turn out to be a loose wire
on the starter. He also pointed out the starter
and showed me the wires that connected to it.
Figure 5-4: A starter with a starter
solenoid attached.

Figure 5-5: Anatomy of a starter.
If you keep the ignition key in the “Start” position after the engine starts run-
ning, you’ll hear a strange noise. That noise is the clutch in the starter drive
that allows the engine to spin faster than the starter. Even though this one-
way clutch prevents starter damage after the engine starts, it’s not a good
idea to hold the key in the “Start” position for more than ten seconds at a
time when the engine is under its own power. If the vehicle doesn’t start,
allow the starter to cool down for one to two minutes before attempting to
start it again. Failure to do so can overheat the starter and damage it. And
don’t turn the key to the “Start” position when the engine is running. If you do,
you can damage the gear on the starter and the ring gear on the flywheel.
The Charging System
After you start your engine, it (usually) runs at a nice steady rumble unless
you have a hybrid or electric vehicle (EV). EVs run silently, and hybrids 
are silent when operating on the electric motor only (see Chapter 10). The
rumble in a conventional vehicle is possible because as soon as the pistons
in the cylinders start to go up and down, your engine begins to run on its
usual diet of fuel and air (read all about it in Chapter 7). When you let go of
the key and your ignition switch moves from “Start” to “On,” the electric
current stops flowing to the starter but continues to flow through the 
charging system (see Figure 5-6) and the rest of the electrical system.
The alternator
The running engine drives a belt that enables your alternator to produce elec-
tric current for the rest of the trip. Here’s how it does this: Your alternator (see

Figures 5-6 and 5-7) replaces the electricity that was taken from the battery
when you started the car. Then, every time your battery sends out some of its
“juice,” the alternator replaces it.
Figure 5-6: The charging system.
Figure 5-7: The alternator.
An alternator produces alternating current (AC), which is internally con-
verted to the direct current (DC) needed to drive various gadgets. You occa-
sionally hear the alternator referred to as a generator. Generators are usually
found on pre-1964 vehicles. They generate direct current (DC) and pass it on.
Today’s generators still generate electric current for other uses, but their
automotive days are over.

Chapter 5: The Electrical System: Your Car’s Spark of Life

When the alternator is generating electric current, it’s said to be charging.
Although most cars just have dashboard “idiot lights” that go on if the alter-
nator isn’t functioning properly, some vehicles have gauges called voltmeters
that show whether the system is charging or discharging. They either have a
“C” at one end and a “D” at the other end of the scale or a range of voltage
levels (usually from 8 to 18).
With the engine running and all accessories off, the system voltage should be
13.5 to 14.5 volts. If not, something may be wrong with the charging system.
The alternator also supplies your electrical system with current to run the
radio, headlights, and so on. I get to that equipment at the end of this chapter.
The voltage regulator
The voltage regulator (see Figures 5-6
and 5-8) is a device that controls the
alternator. On older cars, it’s a little box
mounted somewhere under the hood. On
newer cars, it may be mounted inside
the alternator or inside the ECU. If the
voltage regulator fails, the alternator is
literally “powerless.”
The Ignition System
The purpose of the ignition system is to ignite, or fire, the spark plugs in order
to generate power to run the engine. To do so, the battery sends current to the
ignition coil. Then that high voltage goes on to the spark plugs — either
through a distributor, if you have an older vehicle, or directly to the spark
plugs, if you have a newer one.
Most vehicles built prior to 1974 use a non-electronic distributor ignition
system. Most vehicles built from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s use an 
electronic distributor ignition system. Today’s vehicles use an electronic dis-
tributorless ignition system, which, as the name implies, has no distributor at
all. I discuss and illustrate both of these systems a little later in this chapter.
As later sections explain, both types of electronic ignition systems employ
electronic parts. Unlike older systems, except for the spark plugs, their com-
ponents don’t need to be replaced unless they break down. The good news is
that they tend to be relatively trouble-free. The bad news is that if they do
break down, you have to pay a professional to replace them.
Because all types of ignition systems employ spark plugs, you get to explore
them first. Read on!
88
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 
Figure 5-8: One type of voltage
regulator.

The spark plugs
Spark plugs are located in
the cylinders of your vehicle
(look ahead to Figure 5-17).
They deliver the spark of volt-
age to the combustion cham-
ber just when the fuel/air
mixture is at the point of
greatest compression. The
resulting combustion pro-
vides the power to propel
your vehicle. Chapter 6 tells
you how to “read” your spark
plugs for clues as to how your
vehicle is running and pro-
vides instructions for remov-
ing, gapping, and replacing
spark plugs. Figure 5-9 shows
you the various parts of a
spark plug. You need to get to
know them if you want to
work on them yourself.
The location of the cylinders
varies from one type of engine
to another; the order in which the spark plugs fire the fuel in the cylinders
differs from one engine to another as well. The next two sections tell you
about cylinder sequence and firing order. It’s good to know how this works
because if the spark plugs aren’t firing properly, your engine is as “out-of-
tune” as an orchestra whose players aren’t keeping time. (That’s probably
why they call it a tune-up.)
Cylinder sequence
The cylinder sequence of an engine is the order in which the cylinders of the
engine are numbered. This sequence varies from one type of vehicle to
another, depending on whether it has front-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive
and whether it has an in-line engine, with the cylinders lined up in one row,
or a V-type engine, with the cylinders in two parallel rows.

Here are cylinder sequences for
several types of engines:
 Vehicles with front-wheel
drive have transverse
engines. On both in-line
and V-type engines, the
cylinders run from one
side of the vehicle toward
the other. Aside from
being set cross-wise, they
have the same sequence
and firing order as their
rear-wheel drive in-line or
V-type counterparts (see
Figure 5-10).
 In all U.S.-made in-line 
4- and 6-cylinder vehi-
cles with rear-wheel
drive, the cylinder
nearest the front is
called the #1 cylinder.
The numbering for the
rest of the cylinders
(#2, #3, #4, and so on)
runs in sequence back
toward the firewall at
the rear of the engine
compartment (see
Figure 5-11).
Some foreign automak-
ers reverse the cylin-
der sequence. As you
can see in Figure 5-12,
the #1 cylinder is at the rear,
near the firewall. If you have a
foreign car and no owner’s

Chapter 5: The Electrical System: Your Car’s Spark of Life

Transverse engines have the same cylinder sequence and firing order as in-
line engines, and no matter what the engine configuration, the #1 spark plug
is always the spark plug in the #1 cylinder (see Figures 5-10, 5-15, and 5-16).
Firing order
Don’t confuse cylinder
sequence with firing order.
Although your engine may have
its cylinders in simple numeri-
cal sequence, if the cylinders
were fired in that order, the
engine would rock violently as
first the cylinders on one side
(or toward the front) fired in
rapid succession, and then the
other cylinders did likewise. To
avoid this, the firing order is
carefully arranged to distribute
the shock of combustion evenly
throughout the engine.
The cylinders fire in very swift
sequence, and the result is a
fairly stable engine. The firing
order is printed inside each of
the engines shown in Figures
5-10 through 5-16. Trace the
path of combustion back and
forth through each of these
engines to see how the shock
of combustion is distributed to
avoid rocking the engine. And
remember, the whole thing hap-
pens very rapidly.
Now that I’ve dealt with the
basics, the following sections
deal with the two types of electronic ignition systems: the modern ones 
that no longer have distributors, and the older electronic ignitions with 
distributors.

Modern distributorless ignition systems
Found in most vehicles from the mid-1990s on, distributorless ignition sys-
tems (see Figure 5-17) have fewer moving parts and are much more fuel-
efficient and less prone to breaking down than those with distributors. In all
distributorless ignition systems, the ECU or a dedicated ignition control
module (ICM) controls when the spark plugs fire and ignite the fuel/air mix-
ture in the cylinders, which provide the power that propels the vehicle.
The following sections take a closer look at the electronic components found
in modern distributorless electronic ignition systems (refer to Figure 5-17).
Figure 5-17: A distributorless ignition system.
The electronic coil module
The electronic coil module does the same thing in a much more sophisticated
way as the ignition coils and distributor on older vehicles did: It transforms

receives from the battery into a big enough jolt of voltage (15,000 to 60,000
volts) to jump the spark plug gap. On most vehicles, a set of spark plug wires
(sometimes called ignition cables) carries the high voltage to each spark plug.
On these systems, instead of just one coil increasing the voltage and sending
it to each of the spark plugs, each spark plug has its own little coil. As a
result, if one should misfire, all the others can carry on the job until the
system is repaired.
Ignition system sensors
An electronic ignition system relies on a number of electronic sensing devices
that feed information to the ECU, or a dedicated ignition control module
(ICM) (see Figure 5-17), which sends the signals that fire the spark plugs at the
proper time.
A crankshaft position sensor (refer to Figure 5-17) is mounted on the
engine block and can read the position of, you guessed it, the crankshaft. It’s
one of the sensors that tells the ICM when to fire each spark plug by keeping
track of where the crankshaft is and how fast it’s spinning at any given time.
A camshaft position sensor found on distributorless ignition systems
(refer to Figure 5-17) is another trigger device. It helps the spark plugs to fire
at the right time, provides the data to synchronize the fuel injectors, and
identifies misfiring cylinders.
Electronic ignitions with a distributor
Although most more recent vehicles don’t have distributors, many built
from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s still have them. (If your vehicle doesn’t
have one, you can disregard this section and bop on down to the sections
“Warning Lights and Malfunction Indicator Lights (MIL)” and “Other Electrical
Gadgets.”) In an ignition system with a distributor, the distributor works 
in much the same way as the old-fashioned mechanical distributor that 
preceded it, but without all the moving parts that constantly needed adjust-
ing. It still gets voltage from a coil and distributes it to each spark plug in turn.
The good news is that electronic distributors are relatively trouble-free. The
bad news is that if they break down, you have to pay a professional to replace
them. They include the following parts, which can be seen in Figure 5-18:
94
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

Figure 5-18: An electronic ignition system with a distributor.
 The distributor cap (shown in Figure 5-19)
sits atop the distributor to protect the parts
inside from the elements. Current enters and
leaves the distributor via the coil and spark
plug wires that run through holes in the cap to
each spark plug.
 The rotor (refer to Figure 5-18) sits atop the
distributor shaft inside the distributor. As the
distributor shaft turns, the rotor rotates with it
and points toward the terminal at the base of
each spark plug wire so that each plug can fire
in the correct order. For example, when the
rotor’s pointing at the terminal of the wire lead-
ing to the #1 spark plug, it directs the current to that spark plug at pre-
cisely the time when the fuel/air mixture in the #1 cylinder is waiting
to be burned.
 The armature (refer to Figure 5-18) sits inside the distributor, revolving
past a sensor called the pickup coil. Each time one of the teeth on the
armature passes the sensor, it creates voltage that signals an ignition con-
trol module (ICM) to shut down the primary circuit in the coil. This
“fires” a jolt of high voltage to the secondary coil circuit, which shoots it

out through the rotor to the proper spark plug. A circuit in the electronic
module switches the primary circuit back on between each “firing.”
 The ignition control module is a transistorized component that trig-
gers the ignition coil to fire high voltage. The module is a “non-wear”
component that replaced the old-style “breaker” points in the early to
mid-1970s.
 A pick-up coil is a magnetic pulse generator that tells the ignition con-
trol module when to fire the spark plugs. Some vehicles use a Hall-effect
switch or a photoelectric sensor to do the same thing. It probably 
doesn’t make much difference which type your vehicle has because
there’s no need for you to develop a personal relationship with it.
Warning Lights and Malfunction
Indicator Lights (MIL)
Until fairly recently, vehicles were equipped with either dashboard gauges
that monitored your vehicle’s temperature, oil pressure, charging system,
and fuel level; or warning lights that told you something bad had already
occurred in one of these areas (which is why we usually called them “idiot
lights”).
The warning systems on today’s vehicles are much more efficient. Warning
lights still tell you how much fuel you have; whether the hood, trunk, or a
door is open; or if the parking brake is engaged. They beep at you like a
frustrated parent if you don’t put your seat belt on. And malfunction indica-
tor lights (MIL) check almost every system and warn you about problems
that may need to be corrected.
The only trouble is that MILs can be so enigmatic about what’s gone wrong —
especially when the ominous words “Check Engine” appear — that they can
be very unsettling. That warning can apply to the engine, emissions, or acces-
sories, so at first you can’t know if it’s just that your gas cap is loose or if
major surgery is required.
When I turn on Esmerelda’s engine, a whole panel of little yellow symbols lights
up. Many of these MIL are undecipherable. Others are initials that stand for . . .
what? My owner’s manual describes most of them, but because these lights
only stay on for seconds, it’s hard to keep track of them. And if one of them
stays lit (bad news!), basically all the owner’s manual advises is to head for the
dealership. Because that means I have to pay someone to put the car on a scan
tool and “read the codes,” as a confirmed do-it-myselfer, I’m not happy.
96
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

However, because the MIL report the findings of the electronic sensors that
constantly monitor your vehicle’s airbags, traction control, ABS system,
ECU, transmission, and other vital systems — all of which you can’t work on 
yourself — if one of them stays lit after the others go out, it’s probably a good
idea to head for the car doctor. Failing to do so can void your warranty or
really damage your vehicle.
There is one bright spot on the horizon: In some areas, there are now do-it-
yourself service centers where you can drive into one of their bays, follow
instructions for finding the place under your dashboard to plug in their diag-
nostic equipment, get a printout of the “codes,” and look up what’s wrong.
There’s a good chance that you’ll need professional help, but if you just left
your gas cap loose, you can save yourself a lot of time and money.
Other Electrical Gadgets
In addition to what I cover in the alternator section earlier in this chapter,
by keeping the battery charged, the alternator also indirectly supplies the
electrical current for the sound system, headlights, taillights, directional sig-
nals, defroster/heater/air conditioner blower, and other electrical gadgets.
Although most of these components require professional repair, the following
parts are pretty easy to deal with yourself:
 Fuses protect electrical component circuits the same way they do in a
home. The fuses are located in a fuse box that’s usually found under or
near the dashboard and possibly under the hood. Your owner’s manual
should show you where the fuse boxes on your vehicle are, or you can
crawl under the dashboard and trace the wires from your sound system
until you reach the fuse box. See Chapter 6 for instructions on checking
fuses and replacing a burned-out fuse.
 Windshield wipers need to be checked and their blades replaced peri-
odically. Chapter 2 provides tips on checking and replacing your wind-
shield wiper blades and windshield washer fluid.
 Directional signal flashers on your dashboard do more than tell you
whether the directional signals themselves are flashing. They’re also
designed to provide clues to malfunctions elsewhere on your vehicle!
Chapter 21 tells you how to decipher these clues and rectify the prob-
lems that they indicate. For information about replacing directional sig-
nals, flip to Chapter 6.
97
Chapter 5: The Electrical System: Your Car’s Spark of Life

 Headlights and headlamps have been considerably improved in recent
years. Although vehicles with sealed-beam units and old-style light
bulbs are still on the road, more modern vehicles have headlamps filled
with halogen or Xenon gas. The Xenon headlamps are also known as
HID (high intensity discharge) lamps. They’re brighter and use less
power than halogens do. Most of these are no more difficult to adjust
and replace than sealed- beam units were (see Chapter 6 for instructions
on how to replace headlights and headlamps).
Headlight development continues. Innovations that already exist and will
become more widely available include adaptive front lighting systems (AFS)
that can swivel to illuminate a corner and lightweight LED headlamps that
have the potential to outlive your vehicle.

U
nlike older vehicles, which needed ignition tune-ups at least once a year,
most vehicles on the road today have electronic ignition systems that
are built to go for years without the need for them. The term “tune-up” is still
used to refer to routine maintenance, which varies with a vehicle’s make, model,
and year, so check your owner’s manual for scheduling recommendations.
Although this chapter provides instructions for quite a number of jobs you
can do yourself, because major tune-ups require electronic diagnostic equip-
ment and sensitive onboard computers, they should be done by profession-
als at the dealership or a qualified service facility. And remember, if you fail
to get a scheduled tune-up you could violate your vehicle’s warranty or leas-
ing agreement.
In case you’re wondering what a modern tune-up includes, it generally
involves doing an electronic diagnostic check, changing spark plugs,
replacing air and fuel filters, and checking fluid levels. Other parts may 
not need to be replaced for the life of the car.
There are several jobs involving the electrical system that you can deal with
yourself. The first involves checking, reading, and reinstalling or replacing
spark plugs if your vehicle’s performance suddenly drops and if your vehicle
is configured so that you can work on the spark plugs without harming your
engine. You also can troubleshoot and replace fuses and replace and adjust
the headlights. In this chapter, the sections “Changing Your Spark Plugs,”
“Changing Fuses,” and “Dealing with Headlights and Directional Signals” tell
you what to do and whether you should do it yourself.

If you haven’t already done so, please read Chapter 5 before this one so that
you understand what you’re working on. Also, be sure to read the sections in
Chapter 1 called “Following safety rules,” “Buying the right parts for your
vehicle,” and “How to Take Anything Apart — and Get It Back Together
Again” before you undertake any electrical work.
Before you get down to work on your electrical system, please be aware that
there are devices that you shouldn’t attempt to deal with yourself unless
you’ve worked on them before. If you have trouble with your defroster, heater,
anti-theft devices, or stereo system, get professional help. Later, if you turn into
a confirmed do-it-yourselfer, you can find books that deal with these repairs.
Don’t attempt to work on your air conditioner under any circumstances. It con-
tains refrigerant under pressure that can blind you if it escapes. For service
or repairs, head to the dealership or to an automotive air-conditioning 
specialist. Now, let’s get on to what you can do!
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Determining Whether Your Vehicle 
Needs a Tune-up
Tune-up intervals vary from one vehicle to another. Most older vehicles with
non-electronic ignitions should be tuned every 10,000 to 12,000 miles or
every year, whichever comes first. Newer cars with electronic ignition and
fuel injection systems are scheduled to go from 25,000 miles to as many as
100,000 miles without needing a major tune-up.
Refer to your owner’s manual for recommended tune-up intervals, but be
aware that even if it says that the vehicle doesn’t require scheduled tune-ups
very often, it’s in your best interest to check periodically that your vehicle’s
working at peak efficiency. If you do a lot of stop-and-go driving or pull heavy
loads (like a camper or boat), your ignition system may need to be tuned
more often. Here are a couple of symptoms that tell you that your electronic
ignition system may need to be tuned or adjusted:
 The car stalls a lot. The spark plugs may be fouled or worn, the gap
between the spark plug electrodes may need adjusting, or an elec-
tronic sensing device may need to be adjusted. Stalling also can be
caused by problems with the fuel system (see Chapters 7 and 8).
If you’re having trouble pinpointing why your vehicle is stalling, you can
help your automotive technician diagnose the problem by paying atten-
tion to whether the engine stalls when it’s hot, cold, or when the air 
conditioner is on.
100
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

 The engine is running roughly when idling or when you accelerate.
Chances are the vehicle needs a tune-up.
 The car gets harder to start. The problem can be in the starting system
(for example, a weak battery), in the fuel system (for example, a weak
fuel pump), in the ignition system, or can be due to an electronic compo-
nent, such as the electronic control unit (ECU).
Changing Your Spark Plugs
How often you replace spark plugs depends on the type of plugs you have.
You may have 30,000-mile plugs, or if the plugs have platinum tips, they may
be good for up to 100,000 miles, although some professionals recommend
replacement every 60,000 miles to avoid damage to the engine. (For detailed
information about what spark plugs do, turn to Chapter 5.) However, if they
become fouled with oil or become defective, spark plugs may need to be
replaced ahead of schedule.
There are several ways to tell whether or not the spark plugs on your vehicle
need to be changed or just need to be adjusted and replaced. This section
tells you how to do that. Of course, before you can evaluate the condition of
your spark plugs, you have to find them.
Finding your spark plugs
To locate your spark plugs, look for a set of thick wires (or thin cables) that
enter your engine block in neat rows — on both sides if you have a V-type
engine or on one side if you have a 4- or 6-cylinder in-line engine (also called
a straight engine). These spark-plug wires run from the ignition coil (or the
distributor on older vehicles) to the spark plugs. You can see where the
spark plug wires connect to the spark plugs on various types of engines in
Figures 5-10 through 5-16 in Chapter 5. And, if you’ve never met one, Figure 6-3
later in this chapter provides a look at the anatomy of a spark plug.
Don’t see your plugs? They may be hidden or hard to reach, which means
that you need to reevaluate your plan to work on them. Be sure to read the
following section before you do another thing!
Deciding if you should do the job yourself
The first — and most important — thing to consider is whether or not you
should change the spark plugs on your vehicle yourself. Because so many
modern vehicles have crammed engine compartments that make access diffi-
cult, which can damage the spark plug wires and the threads in the cylinder
101
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Electrical System in Tune

heads, I honestly feel hesitant about even providing instructions. So take the
cautions below seriously before deciding whether or not to proceed.
Even if only one of the following conditions is true for your vehicle (and
they’re true for most modern vehicles), you should have a professional
change your plugs. You don’t want to risk having to replace a really expen-
sive ECU just to save a few dollars on a job that only has to be done infre-
quently! So don’t be a hero!
 There’s so little space between the stuff under the hood that it’s diffi-
cult or impossible to get at your spark plugs. Remember, you need room
to get a socket wrench in there to unscrew the plug and then replace it,
and you need to have an unimpeded view of what you’re doing. Not only
that, but if you don’t get the wrench at the correct angle, you can cross-
thread the plug or strip the threads it screws into. Both are bad news. You
could end up needing a multi-thousand dollar repair.
 The entire engine has to be dismounted and lifted out of the vehicle
in order to reach at least one plug. If you have one of these beasts,
leave this job to the professionals.
Studies have found that many shops just don’t bother to dismount the
engine to get at difficult plugs. If left unchanged, that one funky plug can
increase your fuel consumption, add to air pollution, and cause other
problems. So, if your engine is one of these, when you bring your vehicle
in for a tune-up be sure to confirm that the shop will do whatever’s neces-
sary to replace every plug.
 Your engine has an aluminum cylinder head. Because the metal is soft,
it’s easy to strip the threads in the spark plug’s hole. If you do, the head
will probably have to be removed for repair, and that means more mega-
bucks. Most modern engines have aluminum heads, so for most people,
this fact should eliminate doing this job yourself.
 Your spark plugs are hidden. On some vehicles, you can’t get at the
plugs until you remove other parts that are in the way. For example, on
some transverse engines, you’d have to remove the top engine mount
bolts in order to tilt the engine forward to replace the rear spark plugs.
And on other engines, you can only get to some spark plugs from under-
neath or through the wheel well area.
Still other engines conceal the plugs beneath a metal shield that covers
the engine. Removing this shield can require disconnecting cables that
can seriously affect the ECU. That’s why the shield is there! Some older
domestic engines, most modern import engines, and an increasing
number of modern domestic engines have systems that place an 
ignition coil directly atop each spark plug. There are no spark plug
wires, and you can’t see the spark plugs until you remove the aluminum
cover that’s bolted to the top of that engine.
If I were you, I’d leave all these vehicles to the professionals who have
hoists and special tools that allow them to do the work safely and with
relative ease.
102
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

Okay, with all this in mind, if you can get to your plugs easily and feel that
you can do the job safely, proceed to the next section. Otherwise, skip it.
Before you take care of your spark plugs, you must understand what the
terms cylinder sequence and firing order mean. Chapter 5 has detailed
explanations for these terms and illustrations of most of the major configura-
tions, so if you haven’t read them, stop for a moment and check them out.
What you need to change 
and gap your plugs
If you’ve decided that you can get at your spark plugs without damaging your
vehicle, assemble the items you need before you begin:
 An old blanket, mattress pad, or padded car protector to place over
the fender where you’ll be working to protect it from scratches:
Commercial car protectors often come with handy pockets that hold
tools and little parts while you work. You can make such a pocket your-
self by pinning up the bottom edge of your folded blanket or pad.
 Work clothes: Wear something that you don’t mind getting stained with
grease, oil, and other stuff. Changing spark plugs may be simple, but it
can get messy. Trust me.
 Hand cleaner: Chapter 3 has suggestions for the best type to buy.
 Clean, lint-free rags: You’ll use these to wipe the spark plugs clean, wipe
the cleaner off your hands, and generally tidy up after the work is done.
 A work light (or flashlight, at least): Chapter 3 describes the different
types available.
 A new set of spark plugs: The next section helps you determine what
type and how many spark plugs your vehicle needs. Buy one for each
cylinder in your engine. And don’t be shocked if you’re told that you
need eight spark plugs for your 4-cylinder engine. Some engines require
two spark plugs per cylinder.
Never change just a few plugs; it’s all or nothing for even engine perfor-
mance. If you’re feeling especially wealthy, buy an extra plug in case you
get home and find that one of them is defective, or in case you acciden-
tally ruin one by dropping and cracking it or by cross-threading it when
you install it. If you don’t use it, keep it in your trunk compartment tool
kit for emergencies. Spark plugs don’t get stale.
 Anti-seize compound and silicone lubricant (optional): The threads of
the spark plugs should be lightly coated with a dab of engine oil off the
oil dipstick or with anti-seize lubricant before you install them in the
engine. Also, if there are rubber boots on your spark plug wires, apply 
103
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Electrical System in Tune

silicone lubricant to them to prevent them from sticking to the porcelain
part of the spark plug. (Silicone boots don’t need this.)
 A wire or taper feeler gauge: You use this to gap spark plugs. (I explain
what gapping is in the later section “Gapping your spark plugs.”) Chap-
ter 3 shows you what these gauges look like and what they’re used for.
 A small set of basic socket wrenches that includes a ratchet handle
and a spark plug socket: If you need to buy a set of socket wrenches,
Chapter 3 describes them and provides tips on buying good ones.
Buying the right plugs
To buy the proper spark plugs for your vehicle, you must know its specifica-
tions (or “specs,” as they’re often called). Your owner’s manual may have
specifications for buying and gapping the spark plugs on your vehicle. If you
don’t have an owner’s manual, or if yours lacks the necessary information,
you can find the correct spark plugs and spark plug gap in a general “Tune-Up
Specification Guide” (called a “spec sheet,” for short) at an auto supply store.
These guides are either in pamphlet form or printed on large sheets, like the
one in Figure 6-1, that are displayed near the parts section of the store. If you
can’t find a spec sheet at the store, ask a salesperson to show it to you. For a
sample spec sheet, see Figure 6-1. I’ve italicized the examples in the list of
basic information below so you can find them on the figure.
To obtain the specs for your particular vehicle, you need some basic informa-
tion. All this information should be in your owner’s manual, and most of it
is also printed on metal tags or decals located inside your hood. You can usu-
ally find these in front of the radiator, inside the fenders, inside the hood —
anywhere the auto manufacturer thinks you’ll find them. I know of one vehi-
cle that has its decal inside the lid of the glove compartment. These identifi-
cation tags also provide a lot of other information about where the vehicle
was made, what kind of paint it has, and so on, but don’t worry about that
information right now.
Here’s what you need to know to obtain the specs for your vehicle:
 The make of the vehicle (Toyota, Chevrolet, and so on).
 The model (Prius, Malibu, and so on).
 The model year (2004, 1999, and so on).
 The number of cylinders and type of engine.
 Whether the vehicle has an automatic or a manual (standard)
transmission.
104
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

 The engine displacement: How much room there is in each cylinder
when the piston is at its lowest point? (For example, a 3-liter 6-cylinder
engine has a displacement of one-half liter, or 500 cubic centimeters —
usually shown as 500 CCs — in each cylinder.) The bigger the displace-
ment, the more fuel and air the cylinders in the engine hold.
The displacement of engines on older vehicles may be listed in cubic
inches, such as 302, 350, 454, and so on. Modern vehicles are usually
listed in liters (1.8, 2.3, 5.9) or cubic centimeters (2200, 3400, 3800).
 The kind of fuel system: If your engine is fuel-injected, you may 
need to know whether your car has throttle body injection or multi-port
injection. Carburetors, on the other hand, were distinguished by how
many “barrels” they had. (Chapter 7 makes sense of this stuff.)
 Whether the vehicle has air conditioning: It’s not usually necessary to
take this into account when buying most parts, but you never know
when you’ll need it.

If you haven’t already done so, enter your vehicle’s make, model, year, and
number of cylinders on a copy of the Specifications Record in Appendix B. If
your owner’s manual has the model number of the plug you need and the size
of the gap, enter that information, too. If not, take the record with you to the

At the auto supply store, don’t just ask a salesperson which type of plug you
should buy — you have a very good chance of getting the wrong one. First
look up the specifications yourself, and then ask for the plug by number. If
you’re unsure, have a salesperson double-check it for you.
Look up your vehicle by make and model under the proper year on the spec
sheet at the store. (For example, for my first car, Tweety Bird, a “previously
owned” 1967 Mustang, I looked under 1967, then under Ford, then under
Mustang, then under “200 cu. in. 6 Cyl. Eng. (1 bbl.)” — which means that
Tweety had an engine displacement of 200 cubic inches, a 6-cylinder engine,
and a single-barrel carburetor.) Then write down the following information
from the spec sheet in the appropriate columns on your Specifications Record:
 The spark plug gap: This is the amount of space that there should be
between the center and side electrodes of each spark plug.
 The part number for the spark plugs designed for your vehicle.
Removing old spark plugs
Before you undertake any of this work, re-read the section “Deciding if you
should do the job yourself,” and if your vehicle fits even one of those descrip-
tions, don’t try to do the work in this section. It’s better to pay a professional
than to risk damaging your engine or ECU!
One way to royally confuse yourself and turn the relatively simple task of
changing spark plugs into a nightmare is to pull all your spark plugs out 
at one time. To keep your sanity and to avoid turning this job into an all-
weekend project, work on one spark plug at a time: Remove it, inspect it,
clean it, and — if it’s salvageable — gap it. Then replace it before you move on
to the next spark plug in cylinder sequence order. To maintain the proper
firing order, each spark-plug wire must go from the spark source to the
proper spark plug. Therefore, only remove the wire from one plug at a time,
and don’t disconnect both ends of the wire! This way, you won’t ever get into
trouble — unless a second wire comes off accidentally.
Follow these steps to remove each spark plug:
1. Gently grasp a spark plug wire by the boot (the place where it 
connects to the spark plug), twist it, and pull it straight out.
Never yank on the wire itself (you can damage the wiring). The shiny
thing sticking out of the engine block after you remove the wire from
the spark plug is the terminal of the spark plug. Figure 6-3 later in this
chapter shows you all the parts of a spark plug, including the terminal.
106
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

2. Use a soft, clean rag or a small paintbrush to carefully clean around
the area where the spark plug enters the block. You also can blow the
dirt away with a soda straw.
Cleaning the area keeps loose junk from falling down the hole into the
cylinder when you remove the plug.
3. Place your spark plug socket (the big one with the rubber lining)
over the spark plug; exert some pressure while turning it slightly to
be sure that it’s all the way down.
Like everything else in auto repair, don’t be afraid to use some strength.
But do it in an even, controlled manner. If you bang or jerk things, you
can damage them, but you’ll never get anywhere if you tiptoe around.
4. Stick the square end of your ratchet handle into the square hole in
the spark plug socket.
You may work more comfortably by adding a couple of extensions
between the handle and the socket so that you can move the handle
freely from side to side without hitting anything. Add them in the same
way you added the socket to the handle. If a plug is hard to reach, the
sidebar “Getting to hard-to-reach plugs” gives you additional tips.
107
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Electrical System in Tune
Getting to hard-to-reach plugs
With all the stuff crammed under the hoods of
vehicles, it can be hard to get at some spark
plugs and, even when you can reach them
easily, they may be difficult to remove. Here are
some tips on extracting these spark plugs:
 Almost every vehicle has at least one plug
that’s a miserable thing to reach. If you have
one, and it’s safe for you to deal with, save
it for last. Then you can work on it with the
satisfaction of knowing that, when you get
the darn thing finished, you’ll have finished
the job.
 If you find that one or more plugs are
blocked by an air conditioner or some 
other part, try using various ratchet handle
extensions to get around the problem.
There are universal extensions that allow
the ratchet handle to be held at odd angles;
T-bar handles for better leverage; and
offset handles for hard-to-reach places
(see Chapter 3 for examples). Just remem-
ber that you must keep the ratchet handle
right in line with the angle of the plug it’s
contacting to avoid stripping the threads.
 If you absolutely can’t reach the offending
plug, you can always drive to your service
station and humbly ask them to change just
that one plug. They won’t like it, but it is a
last resort. If you get to that point, you’ll
probably be glad to pay to have it done.

5. Loosen the spark plug by turning it counterclockwise.
To get the proper leverage,
place your free hand over
the head of the wrench,
grasping the head firmly,
and pull the handle, hitting it
gently with the palm of your
hand to get it going (see
Figure 6-2).
It’s okay to exert some
strength; just be sure your
socket is securely over the
plug and that the ratchet is
at the same angle as the plug
to avoid stripping the
threads on the plug or in the
spark plug hole in the engine
head.
You may have some difficulty loosening a spark plug for the first time.
Grease, sludge, and other junk may have caused the plug to stick in
place, especially if it’s been a long time since it was changed. If it feels
stuck, try a little spray lubricant. You’ll feel better knowing that after
you’ve installed your new plugs by hand, it will be a lot easier to get
them loose the next time. So persevere. I’ve never met a plug that didn’t
give up and come out, eventually.
6. When the ratchet turns freely, finish the job by removing the ratchet
handle and turning the socket by hand until the plug is free from the
engine.
108
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 
Mastering the mighty ratchet
Ratchet handles can be a bit tricky if you’ve
never used one. When you figure out how yours
works, it will make many jobs much easier. The
little knob on the back of the ratchet handle
causes the ratchet to turn the socket either
clockwise or counterclockwise. You can tell
which way the handle will turn the plug by lis-
tening to the clicks that the handle makes when
you move it in one direction. If it clicks when you
move it to the right, it will turn the socket coun-
terclockwise when you move it, silently, to the
left. If the clicks are audible on the leftward
swing, it will move the socket clockwise on the
rightward swing.
Every screw, nut, bolt, screw-on cap, and so on
that you encounter should loosen counter-
clockwise and tighten clockwise (“lefty loosey,
righty tighty”). If your ratchet clicks in the wrong
direction, just move that little knob to reverse
the direction. Figure 6-2 shows you the proper
way to use a ratchet handle.
Figure 6-2: Using a ratchet handle.

After you remove the spark plug from the engine, remove the plug from the
socket. But don’t go on to the next plug until you’ve read the plug (see the
section “Reading your spark plugs” and Table 6-1) and gapped and replaced
it, following the instructions later in this chapter.
Reading your spark plugs
You can (and should) actually read your spark plugs for valuable “clues”
about how your engine is operating. To read your spark plugs, follow these
steps:
1. When you get the first spark
plug out of the engine, remove
the plug from the spark plug
socket and compare the condi-
tion of the plug to the clues in
Table 6-1.
Figure 6-3 can help you to iden-
tify the various parts of a plug
mentioned in the table.
2. Check the plug’s shell, insula-
tor, and gaskets for signs of
cracking or chipping, which
indicate that the plug should be
replaced.
3. Look at the plug’s firing end
(the end that was inside the
cylinder).
As you can see in Figure 6-3, the
hook at the top is the side elec-
trode, and the bump right under
its tip is called the center elec-
trode. The spark comes up the center of the plug and jumps the gap
between these two electrodes. This gap must be a particular distance
across for your engine to run efficiently.
4. Take your wire or taper feeler gauge and locate the proper wire. 
(If your spark-plug gap specifications say .035, look for this number
on the gauge.) Then slip that part of the gauge between the two elec-
trodes on your old plug.
If the gauge has a lot of room to wiggle around, it may be because your
old plug has worn down its center electrode, causing a gap that’s too
large. If the gauge can’t fit between the center and side electrodes, the
gap is too small, which means that the spark plug isn’t burning the
fuel/air mixture efficiently.

5. Look at the center electrode bump again and use Table 6-1 to judge its
condition.
Is it nice and cylindrical, like the center electrodes on your new spark
plugs? Has the electrode’s flat top worn down to a rounded lump? Or has
it worn down on only one side? Chances are it’s pretty worn because it’s
old. When the center electrode wears down, the gap becomes too large.
(When you do this job yourself, you’ll probably check your plugs more
often and replace them before they get too worn to operate efficiently.)
6. Clean the plug by gently scrubbing it with a wire brush.
7. Either gap or replace the old plug with a new one, following the
instructions in the next two sections.
Keep in mind that although you don’t need to clean new spark plugs,
you do need to gap them. Some plugs are sold “pre-gapped,” but I recom-
mend checking them with a feeler gauge anyway.
110
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

8. Repeat the entire process for each additional plug.
Work on only one plug at a time, and don’t remove a plug unless the one
you just dealt with — or its replacement — is safely back in the engine.
To keep your engine operating efficiently, don’t mix plugs in varying states of
wear. Either replace all the plugs with new ones or clean and reinstall all the old
ones. If you find that a few of your old plugs aren’t too worn and are in fairly
good shape but you need to replace the others, clean and regap the salvageable
plugs and store them in your trunk compartment tool kit for emergencies.
Sometimes you can cure a problem — such as carbon-fouled plugs — by
going to a hotter- or cooler-burning plug. You can identify these by the plug
number: The higher the number, the hotter the plug. Never go more than one
step hotter or cooler at a time.
If your plugs indicate that something is seriously wrong with the way your
engine is running, ask a professional for an opinion. If you’re told that it
requires extensive or expensive work, get a second opinion at another service
facility without telling the technicians that you went to the first place. This is a
good policy to follow whenever major repair work is suggested. You wisely get
a second opinion when a doctor tells you that you need major surgery; why
not give your vehicle the same thorough attention before incurring a major
expense? Chapter 22 has plenty of tips for surviving automotive surgery.
Gapping your spark plugs
As I mention in the preceding section, the space, or gap, between the center
and side electrodes needs to be an exact distance across; otherwise, your
plugs don’t fire efficiently. Adjusting the distance between the two electrodes
is called gapping your spark plugs.
Gap new as well as old spark plugs, even if the package says that the new
plugs are “pre-gapped.” To avoid problems, work on only one plug at a time,
in cylinder sequence order.
The following steps explain how to gap your spark plugs:
1. If you’re regapping a used plug, make sure that it’s clean (gently scrub
it with a wire brush). If you’re using a new plug, it should be clean
and new-looking, with the tip of the side electrode centered over the
center electrode.
You shouldn’t see any cracks or bubbles in the porcelain insulator, and
the threads should be unbroken.
111
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Electrical System in Tune

2. Select the proper number on
your feeler gauge, and run
the gauge between the elec-
trodes (see Figure 6-4).
If the gauge doesn’t go
through, or if it goes through
too easily without touching
the electrodes, you need to
adjust the distance between
the electrodes.
3. Adjust the gap as necessary.
If the wire didn’t go through,
the gap is too narrow. Hook the
part of the feeler gauge that’s used for bending electrodes under the side
electrode and tug very gently to widen the gap.
If the gauge goes through too easily without touching the electrodes, the
gap is wide. Press the side electrode very gently against a clean, mar-
proof surface until it’s slightly bent down toward the center electrode.
4. Run the gauge through the gap again.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until the gap is just right.
You want the gauge to go through fairly easily, just catching the elec-
trodes as it passes.
If you keep adjusting the gap too narrow or too wide, don’t feel bad.
Everyone I know goes through the “too large–too small–too large” bit a
couple of times for each plug, especially the perfectionists.
After you’re done gapping your spark plug, it’s time to insert it in the engine.
The next section has the details.
Installing a spark plug
To insert a spark plug into the engine, follow these steps:
1. Clean the spark plug hole in the cylinder block with a clean, lint-free
cloth.
Wipe away from the hole; don’t shove any dirt into it.
2. Lightly coat the threads of the spark plug with a dab of oil from the oil
dipstick, being careful not to get any on the center or side electrodes.
3. Carefully begin threading the spark plug into the engine by hand,
turning it clockwise.
112
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 
Figure 6-4: Gapping a plug with a wire gauge.

This is called “seating the plug.” You have to do it by hand or you run
the risk of starting the plug crooked and ruining the threads on the plug
or the threads in the spark plug hole in the engine.
If you have trouble holding onto the plug, you can buy a spark plug
starter and fit it over the plug. Or, you can use just about anything you
can wrap around or slip over the plug top, including an old spark plug
wire boot, a finger cut from a vinyl glove, an old piece of thin plastic
tubing, or a piece of vacuum hose.
4. After you engage the plug by hand, turn it at least two full turns
before utilizing the spark plug socket and ratchet.
5. Slip the spark plug socket over the spark plug, attach the ratchet handle,
and continue turning the plug clockwise until you meet resistance.
Don’t over-tighten the plug (you can crack the porcelain); just get it in
nice and tight with no wiggle. The plug should stick a little when you try
to loosen it, but you should be able to loosen it again without straining
yourself. Tighten and loosen the first plug once or twice to get the
proper feel of the thing.
6. Take a look at the spark plug cable before attaching its boot to the
plug. If the cable appears cracked, brittle, or frayed or is saturated
with oil, have it replaced.
7. Before you attach the boot to the spark plug, apply some silicone
lubricant to the inside of the boot; then push the boot over the
exposed terminal of the new plug and press it firmly into place.
You’ve just cleaned, gapped, and installed your first spark plug. Don’t
you feel terrific? Now you have only three, five, or seven more to do,
depending on your engine.
8. Repeat the steps to remove, read, gap, and install each spark plug.
It’s at times like these that owners of 4-cylinder cars have the edge on
those who drive those big, expensive 8-cylinder monsters. Unless, of
course, they have two plugs in each cylinder. . . .
113
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Electrical System in Tune
Leave your distributor to a pro
Most cars built after 1975 have electronic igni-
tion systems that require no regular servicing.
Some have no distributors at all. All testing and
servicing of these systems should be left to
trained professionals because they’re easily
damaged if hooked up improperly, and they
employ high voltage that can also damage you.
If you’re curious, Chapter 5 explains what dis-
tributors do.

When you’re done, start your engine to prove to yourself that everything still
works. Then wash your hands with hand cleaner. If you’ve had a hard time
with a hard-to-reach plug, get some rest before taking on additional work.
And take comfort in the fact that, next time, the job should be a breeze.
Replacing a Battery
No matter how well your vehicle is working, if your battery dies and can’t be
recharged, you’re stranded in a vehicle that you can’t drive in for service. A
battery usually has a sticker on it that shows when you bought it and how long
you can expect it to survive. To prevent being stuck on the road with a dead
battery, enter that information in your Specifications Record in Appendix B and
have the battery replaced before it comes to the end of its life expectancy.
To extend its life, your battery should be checked and maintained regularly.
You can find instructions in Chapter 2 for dealing with it as part of your
monthly under-the-hood check. And if it has just run out of juice temporarily
because you left the lights on, Chapter 21 tells you all about jumping a start.
Deciding if you should do the job yourself
Unless your vehicle has a shield over the battery that’s difficult or dangerous
to remove, it shouldn’t be hard to replace it yourself. However, if installation
and disposal are included in the price of a new battery, there may be no advan-
tage in undertaking the job.
To further assist you in
deciding whether or not to
do the job, open the hood of
your vehicle (Chapter 1 tells
you how) and find the bat-
tery. Figure 6-5 shows you
where it’s located and what
it looks like. If the battery on
your vehicle is concealed
under a plastic shield, take a
look at what’s holding it in
place. If you see just a few
screws or bolts, you can
probably unscrew them and
remove the shield without
much trouble. If it looks diffi-
cult to get the thing off, have
the battery installed wher-
ever you buy it.
114

Battery

Figure 6-5: Locating the battery under the hood.

Buying the right battery for your vehicle
If you’ve decided to replace your battery yourself, the first thing to do is to
buy the right one. Keep the following in mind:
 If you haven’t already put the information on your Specifications
Record, consult your owner’s manual to find the specifications for
the battery designed for your vehicle.
 Buy a brand name battery at a reputable dealership, auto parts store,
or battery dealer. (Chapter 1 has useful tips on buying the right parts
for your vehicle.)
Batteries are priced by their life expectancy. Most are rated for five
years. Don’t risk getting stranded by a poor quality battery that malfunc-
tions, but if you don’t plan to keep your vehicle longer than five years,
don’t spring for an expensive long-term battery that will vastly outlive
your need for it.
 Take the new battery out to your vehicle and compare it with the orig-
inal one. It should be the same size, shape, and configuration. If it isn’t,
march right back in and return it for the right one.
While you’re battery shopping, be sure you have all the stuff you need for the
job. If you don’t have an adjustable wrench (see Chapter 3), buy or borrow
one. You’ll also need a couple of clean lint-free rags, a pair of disposable latex
gloves, some water and baking soda, and a battery brush. To protect your
eyes from any deposits that can hurt them, invest in an inexpensive pair of
safety goggles, too.
How to remove and install a battery
When you have your equipment handy and you’re ready to start, follow these
easy steps:
1. Make sure that your vehicle is in Park, with the engine shut off and
the parking brake on.
2. Open the hood and place a blanket or pad over the fender to protect it.
3. Remove the cables from the battery terminals.
Look in your owner’s manual to see whether your vehicle has negative
ground (most do). If it does, use an adjustable wrench to first loosen the
nut and bolt on the clamp that holds the battery cable on the negative
terminal. (That’s the post with the little “–” or “NEG” on it.) If your vehi-
cle has positive ground, loosen the cable with “+” or “POS” on it first.
Remove the cable from the post and lay it out of your way. Then remove
the other cable from its post and lay that aside.
115
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Electrical System in Tune

If you have trouble loosening the bolt, grab it with one wrench and the
nut with another, and move the wrenches in opposite directions. In this
case, you don’t want to remove the bolts; just loosen them enough to
release the cable clamps.
4. Remove whatever devices are holding the battery in place.
When you’re removing a bolt or screw, after you’ve loosened it with a
tool, turn it the last few turns by hand so that you have a firm grip on it
when it comes loose and it doesn’t drop and roll into obscurity.
5. When the battery is free, lift it out of its seat and place it out of your way.
6. If the tray on which the battery was standing is rusty or has deposits
on it, clean it with a little baking soda dissolved in water.
Wear your gloves because the battery stuff is corrosive and be sure the
battery tray is completely dry before taking the next step!
7. Place the new battery on the tray, facing in the same direction as the
old one did.
8. Replace the devices that held the old battery in place. Try to wiggle
the battery to make sure it’s completely secure.
9. Replace the battery cables on the terminals in reverse order from
which you removed them.
(If your vehicle has negative ground, the positive cable goes back first.)
Make certain that the clamps holding the cables on the battery termi-
nals are gripping the posts tightly.
10. Take the old battery to a recycling center that accepts batteries.
Batteries are filled with a toxic, corrosive liquid and must be disposed of
properly. What’s more, old batteries are usually rebuilt into new ones,
so just throwing one in the trash is doubly bad for the environment. 
If you have your new battery installed when you buy it, the shop will
recycle the old one for you. They’ll probably want to charge a few 
dollars for this service, but try to negotiate it into the price. You also
can call your local recycling center for a referral.
Changing Fuses
If your stereo goes dead, your turn signals don’t blink, a light goes out, or
some other gadget stops working, it’s often just the result of a blown fuse.
You can change fuses yourself, easily and with very little expense. This 
section shows you how.
Many vehicles have two fuse boxes: one under the hood and one under the
dash. A fuse box is easy to recognize (see Figures 6-6 and 6-7), and replacing
burned-out fuses is a fairly simple matter. Changing a fuse is much cheaper
116
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

than paying for new equipment or repairs that you don’t need (even if you
chicken out and have an automotive technician do it), so take a few minutes
to find your fuse boxes. Your owner’s manual can help you locate them.
Before you open or work on a fuse box, be sure that your vehicle’s ignition is
turned off.

Chapter 6: Keeping Your Electrical System in Tune

Never replace a fuse with one that has different amperage than the original. The
new fuse has to be the same color and size as the one you’re replacing. As
you can see in the figures, the lid of each fuse box usually has a chart that
shows you what each fuse is for and how many amps it is. If the fuse you’re
replacing has different amperage than the one on the chart, someone may
have replaced it incorrectly, and that may be why it’s blown.
After you’ve replaced all the burned-out fuses, test the part that malfunc-
tioned to see if it’s operating properly again. If it still doesn’t work, have it
professionally repaired or replaced.
Blade-type fuses
Most modern vehicles have blade-type fuses with
prongs that plug into the fuse box the same way
that appliances plug into wall outlets (see Fig-
ure 6-8). They come in various sizes and are color-
coded for amperage.
If you can’t just yank a fuse out, you need a plug
puller. If you’re lucky, your automaker has pro-
vided one right in the fuse box. If not, try a pair of
tweezers.
You can tell if the fuse has blown by looking at the
filaments visible in its little window. If they’re fused
(no pun intended) or burned through, the fuse has
had it.
Tubular fuses
If you encounter tubular glass fuses, look for one
that’s black inside or no longer has its filaments
intact (see Figure 6-9). To remove this blown fuse,
gently pry it out with your fingers, a very small
standard screwdriver, a small set of pliers, or, as a
last resort, a bent paper clip.
To avoid breaking the fuse, try prying up one of
the end caps first. If that doesn’t work, gently pry
it up from one end of the center area. Inspect the
fuse to be sure it’s burned out, and then gently
press a new fuse into place.

Dealing with Headlights 
and Directional Signals
Today’s vehicles feature many kinds of illumination: Headlights, taillights,
directional signals, and fog lights make it easier for you to see and be seen;
overhead lights, map lights, lit glove compartments, and illuminated mirrors
on sun visors all require attention periodically. In this section, I deal primarily
with headlights and modern headlamps. If you experience problems with
other lights, it’s usually just a matter of changing the bulb or changing the fuse
associated with the light. If that doesn’t do the trick, seek professional help.
Older vehicles have headlights with sealed-beam units (bulbs). Modern vehi-
cles have headlamps filled with halogen or Xenon gas. In the interest of
brevity, where I refer to both systems, I just call them headlights.
Troubleshooting headlights
Here are some headlight problems and how to tell what may be wrong with
them:
 If a headlight doesn’t work on Low beam but does work on High, you
have to replace the whole sealed-beam unit or headlamp.
 If a headlight doesn’t work on either High or Low beam, you probably
just have a bad connection in the wiring.
 If both of your headlights go out at the same time, chances are the
units are okay but the fuse that controls them has blown and needs to
be changed. The “Changing Fuses” section earlier in this chapter tells
you how to do that.
It doesn’t hurt to wash the outside of your headlights and taillights occasion-
ally; clean lights provide better visibility at night. If you still have trouble seeing
at night (and you’ve been getting enough vitamin A), check to make sure that
both of your headlights are shining straight ahead rather than at the side of the
road or into the eyes of other drivers. If they appear to be out of alignment,
check out the “Checking headlight alignment” section later in this chapter.
Determining which headlights you have
Before attempting to replace or adjust your headlights, you need to know
whether you have halogen or Xenon headlamps or the old-style sealed-beam
units. You can tell which type of headlights you have by looking at them
when they’re on at night.
119
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Electrical System in Tune

Headlights with sealed-beam units are quickly going out of style. The light
they give off is just plain white. Many modern vehicles have halogen head-
lights. The newest models often come with HID (high intensity discharge
lamps), also called Xenon or bi-Xenon lamps. Light from Xenon lamps has a
bluish cast.
If you’re in doubt, check the clear outer cover of your headlamp assembly. If
it’s marked with D1R, D1S, D2R or D2S, you have HID lamps. (Those markings
denote the type of bulb.) If the lens cover isn’t marked and you still see a
bluish cast to the light from the lamps, you either have an aftermarket
Xenon system or a halogen bulb that’s been tinted. Your parts dealer or ser-
vice facility can tell which type you need by looking at the bulb.
Replacing and adjusting halogen 
and Xenon headlamps
Although they are far more powerful than sealed-beam units and enable a
driver to see 20 percent farther, these modern units require less power to
operate. Xenon are the brightest, have the longest life, and consume the least
power. Halogen and Xenon headlamps have also allowed designers to get
pretty creative with shapes because they use small, replaceable lamps that
don’t have to be contained in round or rectangular housings.
To replace a bulb on a halogen
or Xenon headlamp, use Fig-
ure 6-10 as a guide while you
take the following steps:
1. Make sure that your vehi-
cle’s ignition is off before
you open the unit.
2. Open the hood and find
the wiring leading to 
the electrical connector
that plugs into the bulb 
assembly.
3. Remove the connector.
The connector can be held in place by a ring that unlocks by twisting it
counterclockwise, by a little catch that you need to press down while
pulling on the plug, or by a metal clip that pulls off (don’t lose it!).
4. Pull out the bulb assembly, remove the old bulb, and install the
replacement.

Figure 6-10: Replacing a halogen or Xenon lamp.

Don’t touch the replacement glass bulb! Natural oils from the skin on your
fingers will create a hotspot that will cause the new bulb to burn out pre-
maturely. Instead, handle the bulb by its plastic base or the metallic tip,
if it has one. Also, these fragile bulbs are filled with gas under pressure,
so be careful to avoid breaking them.
5. Replace everything you removed and replug the connector.
6. Turn your headlamps on. If the bulb is still out and the fuse is okay,
have a professional diagnose and fix the problem.
Because HID headlamps are so
intensely bright, it’s most important
that they be properly focused to avoid
temporarily blinding other drivers,
pedestrians, or animals. If you want to
check that the beams are properly
aligned, see “Checking headlight align-
ment” at the end of this section.
If you need to adjust the alignment of a
halogen headlamp, it has two adjusting
screws, as shown in Figure 6-11. The
screw on the bottom will angle the
beam higher or lower; the one at the
top or side will focus the beam to the
left or right.
Replacing and adjusting 
sealed-beam headlights
Older vehicles have sealed-beam units, which are relatively easy to deal with.
If one of your headlights ceases to shine, first consult your owner’s manual to
see whether it contains instructions for replacing the bulb. If it doesn’t, the
following steps should get you through the job with a minimum of hassle:
1. Make sure that the vehicle’s ignition is off before you open the unit.
2. Remove any exterior rings or frames that surround the headlight.
If you need some exotic tool to do this, forget the job and have it done
professionally.
3. Carefully turn the correct screws to loosen the retaining plate that
holds the unit in place.
121
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Electrical System in Tune

Figure 6-11: Headlamp adjustment screws.

The plate has several screws; round headlights have three screws that
loosen the plate, and rectangular headlights have four. The other screws
align the headlights by adjusting the angle of the bulb.
If you turn the wrong screws, your headlights go out of alignment, so
check your owner’s manual for details. If you think you’ve messed up
the alignment, see the next section “Checking headlight alignment.”
4. Remove the bulb.
If the retaining screws stick, spray a little penetrating solvent (like 
WD-40) on them. Hold onto the bulb as you remove the screws so that it
doesn’t fall out and smash. Pull the wiring connector off the back of the
old bulb and set the bulb out of the way.
5. Scrape any corrosion off the connector, and check its wiring for wear.
If the connector is very corroded or the wiring looks bad, the problem
with the light may be in the wiring rather than the bulb. You’ll know for
sure in a minute. . . .
6. Plug the wiring into the new bulb, and insert the bulb into the 
receptacle.
Be sure to put the new bulb into its locking slots with the unit number at
the top. Any small bumps you find on the back edge of the bulb should
align with corresponding little depressions in the socket.
7. Hold the bulb in place while you put back the retaining plate. Then
replace whatever trim surrounded the headlight.
8. Turn your headlights on. If the bulb is still out and the fuse is okay,
have a professional diagnose and fix the problem.
Checking headlight alignment
If you managed to goof up your headlight adjusting screws, or if you just
aren’t sure whether your headlights are properly aligned, you can perform a
simple check. When you’re driving on a fairly straight road at night, see if
your headlights appear to be shining straight ahead and are low enough to
illuminate enough of the road in front of you to enable you to stop safely if an
obstruction appears. Be sure to check your headlights on both high and low
beams.
You can also have headlights checked and aligned professionally. Auto repair
facilities often have headlight-aiming equipment to check and set your head-
lights in accordance with state laws. Some are certified Motor Vehicle Bureau
inspection stations. Note, though, that if you go to a repair facility that does
MVB inspections just to see whether your headlights are aimed properly,
you’ll probably have to pay them for checking the lights and for an inspection
certificate whether or not they have to adjust your lights.
122
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

A cheaper way to check out headlight adjustment is to contact a highway
patrol station. The station may have the equipment to check your headlights
for you or be able to tell you where their current highway checkpoints are so
that you can check the lights yourself. Of course, if the highway patrol finds
that your headlights aren’t in focus or finds anything wrong with your vehi-
cle’s emissions, you’ll have to get the problem fixed within a stipulated
period or face a fine.
If you try to fix the alignment problem yourself by turning the adjustment
screws on your headlights, go back to the checkpoint afterward for a certifi-
cate saying that the lights have been adjusted and meet the proper standards.
This certificate is usually part of the price.
Replacing directional signals
Directional signals are usually easy to replace. On some vehicles, you have to
remove the frame from around the signal to reach the bulb. On others, you
can access the bulb from the trunk. If any of your directional signals stop
flashing or don’t flash in synch, or if the directional signal indicators on your
dashboard don’t flash, the signal lights themselves may not be malfunction-
ing. You can find information about troubleshooting directional signals in
Chapter 20.

his chapter introduces you to a traditional fuel system. The fuel system
shown in Figure 7-1 stores and delivers fuel to the combustion cham-
bers of the engine so that it can be burned efficiently. Although most fuel sys-
tems have some basic components in common, fuel systems do vary. Most
modern vehicles employ fuel injectors to get the fuel to the engine, whereas
vehicles built before the mid-1980s usually relied on carburetors. Since
many of the basic parts covered in this chapter either are common to both
systems or do the same jobs as their counterparts on carbureted vehicles
did, this chapter is relevant no matter which type of vehicle you have.
Today, in addition to vehicles that run on gasoline, there are a number of
other fuel systems around. If your vehicle has a diesel engine, be sure to
read Chapter 9, which helps you understand and maintain a diesel engine and
covers eco-friendly biodiesel and clean diesel models. There are hybrid
vehicles that generate their own power, so they can use electric motors to
augment traditional gasoline engines when necessary and can even run on
all-electric power at times. Other eco-friendly vehicles run entirely on alterna-
tive sources of power such as natural gas (NGV) and hydrogen (fuel cells).
You can discover more about these modern environmental marvels in
Chapter 10.
In this chapter, I trace the flow of fuel from the fuel tank to the engine block,
through the exhaust system, and out of your vehicle. When you know what
each component does and where to find it, it’s easy to see how all the parts
work together to provide your vehicle with “GO power.”

If a picture is worth a thousand words, actually looking at — and maybe even
touching — something is worth a thousand pictures. So, if possible, take this
book out to your vehicle, open the hood, and visit with the parts of the fuel
system as you read about them.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Basic Fuel System Components
Whether your vehicle is more than 20 years old or just 20 days old, has fuel
injectors or a carburetor, it probably has the same basic parts in its fuel
system with one exception: On modern vehicles, the fuel system — along
with most other systems — is controlled by the engine control unit (ECU).
The ECU controls the fuel/air mixture and other fuel system operations
based on inputs from a mass air flow meter, a throttle position sensor, and an
oxygen sensor. As you can see in Figure 7-1, it’s located under the hood.
Figure 7-1: A fuel system.
Fuel tank
The fuel tank is a metal or plastic composite container that’s usually located
under the trunk compartment (refer to Figure 7-1), although some vehicles

Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

have some fairly interesting alternative locations for it. If you’re not sure
where your fuel tank is and you can’t find it just by looking under the car,
your owner’s manual or mechanic can show you where it’s located.
Inside the fuel tank is a little float that moves up and down as the fuel level in
the tank increases or decreases. The float is at its highest when the tank is
full. Its position relative to the top of the tank is picked up by a sensor that
sends an electronic signal from the tank to the fuel gauge on your dashboard
so that you can tell when you have to buy more fuel. (Chapter 8 tells you why
you should always try to keep your fuel tank full.) Although some vehicles
run on diesel fuel or alternative fuels, the ones I talk about in this chapter
are gasoline-powered, so I may refer to fuel as gasoline.
Fuel lines and fuel pump
The fuel pump (see Figure 7-2) pumps fuel through the fuel lines that run
under your vehicle from the fuel tank to the fuel injectors (or to the carbure-
tor on older vehicles). Engines with fuel injection use an electric fuel pump
that may be located in or near the fuel tank. (On most carbureted vehicles, a
mechanical pump is under the hood.)

Chapter 7: The Traditional Fuel System: The Heart and Lungs of Your Car

If your vehicle is suffering from fuel-system problems, remember that a
number of things can be the cause. Most fuel pumps are located inside the
fuel tank or so far under the vehicle that you can’t reach them easily without
a hoist or crawling under your vehicle, so have a professional check it for you.
If your fuel pump does need replacing, ask your service facility to replace it
with a new one, as their charges for rebuilding yours would probably be more
expensive than for just installing a new one. Be sure that they guarantee the
pump for at least a year. Hopefully, it will last much longer than that.
Fuel filters
Fuel filters do exactly what their name implies — they filter impurities out of
the fuel. As the fuel passes along the fuel line on its way to the fuel injectors (or
carburetor), it passes through the principal fuel filter. A small screen inside this
filter traps the dirt and rust that would otherwise foul up your injectors.
If you drive around most of the time with a near-empty fuel tank, the water in
the air inside the tank may cause rust to form, contaminate your fuel, and
foul up your fuel filter and possibly the fuel injectors.
There’s usually a filter screen inside the fuel tank, and some vehicles have
additional fuel filters inside the fuel pump, between the fuel tank and the fuel
pump, and at the entrance to the throttle body. Figure 7-3 shows two types of
fuel filters.
Figure 7-3: External (a) and spin-on (b) fuel filters.

Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

To avoid fouling up your vehicle as well as your vehicle’s warranty, it’s
important to change your fuel filter(s) according to the manufacturer’s 
maintenance schedule. Chapter 8 can help you tackle this task.
Cold air collector box and air filter
Because gasoline engines run on a mixture of air and fuel, the air has to be
cleaned before it’s mixed with the fuel. The air filter removes dirt and dust par-
ticles before they can enter the combustion chamber. In the “olden days,” most
air filters were inside large, round air cleaners that sat on top of the carbure-
tor. Today’s fuel-injected engines have a rectangular air filter inside a cold air
collector box located near the front of the engine compartment; see Figure 7-4.
Figure 7-4: The cold air collector box houses the air filter.
To find the rectangular cold air collector box in your vehicle, pop the hood
and follow the large air intake duct away from your engine. If you have an
older vehicle with a large round air cleaner, you can’t miss it. If you don’t
know how to get the hood of your vehicle open, see Chapter 1 or your
owner’s manual.
To keep your engine functioning efficiently, be sure to check your air filter
regularly as part of the under-the-hood check that I cover in Chapter 2, and
replace it at least once a year or every 20,000 miles, whichever comes first.
(Replace the air filter more often if you regularly drive in a dusty or sandy
area.) Chapter 8 helps you find your air filter, judge whether it needs to be
changed, and change it yourself (it’s a surprisingly easy job).
The intake and exhaust manifolds
After being filtered in the cold air collector box, air bound for the engine
flows through the air intake manifold. This chamber usually is found near the
Cold air collector box
Air filter
129
Chapter 7: The Traditional Fuel System: The Heart and Lungs of Your Car

top of the engine; it holds the air under vacuum and admits it into the com-
bustion chamber with the proper amount of fuel. After the fuel/air mixture is
burned in the engine, another set of manifold pipes, called the exhaust man-
ifold, carries carbon monoxide and other waste gases away from the engine
through the exhaust system for disposal. You usually find the exhaust mani-
fold either lower down on the same side of the engine as the intake manifold
or on the other side of the cylinder head.
The fuel/air mixture
In case you’re wondering why air is such an important fuel system compo-
nent, it’s because liquid gasoline won’t ignite on its own. The pressure caused
by the rapid expansion of burning gases is what drives the engine. The only
way to get gasoline to ignite is to mix it with air — hence the need for the
fuel/air mixture.
The explosive nature of fuel and air together is why so many accidents occur
with near-empty gasoline cans. People tend to think that an almost-empty
can of gasoline is harmless, but it couldn’t be more dangerous! Gasoline in
liquid form will burn but not explode. An air and gasoline vapor combination
is more explosive than TNT! Even a seemingly empty can still contains gaso-
line vapor, and you need only one part of gasoline to 2,000 parts of air by
volume to get a combustible mixture! Any kind of spark can set it off.
Never carry gasoline in anything but a specialized fuel can, and keep that can
filled up. What’s more, unless you’re going far from any source of fuel, don’t
carry (or store) gasoline at all, and get rid of any old cans you have around.
(See the sidebar called “How to dispose of empty gasoline cans safely” in
Chapter 1).
Following Fuel through the Fuel Injectors
Just about every new vehicle is fuel-injected. (The last carbureted vehicles
came off the assembly line in 1990.) Although they’re more expensive to ser-
vice than carburetors were, fuel injection systems with computerized elec-
tronic sensing devices have shown sufficient sensitivity, accuracy, and
dependability to repay their cost with better performance, greater fuel econ-
omy, cleaner exhaust emissions, and more controllable power. Some of the
newest models are reported to be 95 to 100 percent clean-burning! Innovations
in design are constantly producing cheaper and more durable systems.
Basically, fuel injection systems inject fuel at precisely the right time and
place for it to mix with air and form the fuel/air mixture that drives the
engine. This section follows the fuel and air through the fuel injection system
to the cylinders.
130
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

Fuel injection systems are too difficult to adjust or repair yourself, but if you
know how they work, you can communicate with your technician more knowl-
edgeably, which will save you time and money. Besides, it’s really interesting!
Today’s engines use electronic fuel injectors that are controlled by transistors
in the ECU known as injector drivers. The ECU relies on feeds from a variety
of sensors to tell it the following:
 How much air is flowing in through the air intake system
 The pressure of the air in the intake manifold
 The engine coolant temperature
 The engine speed
 The throttle angle
 The amount of oxygen in the exhaust gases
The ECU’s injector driver uses all this information to figure out just how
much fuel to spray into each cylinder to mix with the air to get the optimum
power to drive the piston.
A transistor turns the injector on by completing a circuit to allow electric
current to flow through a solenoid in the injector. A spring-loaded valve in
the injector opens, and fuel is injected into the engine cylinders. The amount
of time that the ECU keeps the current applied to the injector is known as the
injector pulse width. The ECU controls the fuel/air mixture by controlling
that pulse width, changing the pulse width to make the mixture richer or
leaner based on the information it gets from the various sensors.
You can find fuel injectors (see Figure 7-5) in
one of two places: Modern multi-port injection
systems are located in the intake port just
ahead of the intake valve. The earlier throttle-
body fuel injection systems are located inside
the throttle body assembly (surprise!), which
is kind of like an electronically controlled car-
buretor. The following sections explore each of
these injection systems in detail.
Multi-port fuel injection
Most modern vehicles have multi-port fuel
injection (MFI) with a separate fuel injector for
each cylinder. This system mixes the fuel and
air together right in the intake port for each
engine cylinder just ahead of the intake valve.

Figure 7-5: Anatomy of a fuel
injector.

Here’s how multi-port fuel injection systems work:
1. An electrical fuel pump pumps fuel from the fuel tank through a fuel
filter to the fuel rail assembly, which carries fuel under pressure to
the fuel injectors (see Figure 7-6).
The fuel rail assembly also may contain the fuel pressure regulator,
which maintains proper fuel pressure and meters unused fuel back to
the fuel tank. Fuel injectors, one for each cylinder, are attached at one
end to the fuel rail and at the other end to the intake port in the engine.
2. A whole bunch of sophisticated sensors measure a variety of factors
and send messages to the ECU, which decides how much fuel to inject
at any given time.
These sensors are so perceptive that they even check the weather; how
much weight you’re carrying in the vehicle; and whether you’re starting
up, speeding up, slowing down, or idling at a light. This information
makes the system respond faster and results in greater fuel economy
than older vehicles achieved with throttle-body fuel injection (described
in a later section).
3. The ECU completes the electrical circuit to the injector solenoid for
the proper injector pulse width, and fuel under pressure is injected
into the intake port just before the intake valve.
Figure 7-6: Fuel flows through the fuel rail to the injectors.
Sequential fuel injection
More recent fuel-injected engines feature sequential fuel injection (SFI) in
which the fuel injectors fire in sequence rather than all at once. Because each
injector opens individually just before its intake valve opens, the fuel is
always sprayed right into an open port and therefore stays in suspension.

This type of system is more efficient than a system whose injectors fire simul-
taneously. (For example, if you have a six-cylinder multi-port fuel-injected
engine that’s simultaneously fired, three of the six injectors are pulsed
together, and then the other three injectors are pulsed.) In addition, emission
levels are lower in an SFI system, but the system requires a separate electri-
cal circuit for each injector.
Gasoline direct injection
The gasoline direct injection (GDI) system is relatively new in the United States
but is expected to grow more popular as time goes on. It resembles diesel tech-
nology (see Chapter 9) but uses gasoline instead of diesel fuel. Instead of being
mixed with air to form a fuel/air mixture prior to injection, the gasoline is
injected directly into each engine cylinder. The ECU uses data from various sen-
sors to time the injection of the fuel into the cylinder and regulate the resulting
fuel/air mixture for maximum efficiency under varying driving conditions.
Although a gasoline direct injection system is currently more expensive to
build than a standard engine, it measures fuel so precisely that you get the
most bang for the buck. However, to handle its higher emission of NOx
emissions (nitrogen oxides), the GDI system requires a more costly catalytic
converter than a standard engine does. Because of the greater fuel efficiency,
automakers are currently working on gasoline direct injection systems to
reduce their emissions and bring down the cost. As fuel becomes more
expensive and the efficiency of these engines increases relative to the costs,
they’ll become more popular and more widely available.
133
Chapter 7: The Traditional Fuel System: The Heart and Lungs of Your Car
Improvements to fuel injection systems
Two exciting ways that fuel injection systems
are being perfected is the replacement of
moving parts with stationary ones and solid
parts with intangible substances. By reducing
the number of mechanical parts, car manufac-
turers hope to reduce production costs and
create devices that are less susceptible to
breakdown due to physical stress.
Now, I’ve been in favor of simplification ever
since my mother taught me to always buy the
washing machine with the fewest gadgets on
the principle that the fewer parts involved, the
fewer things there are that can break down. But
I keep having this fantasy that if they continue
to replace mechanical car parts with miniatur-
ized and computerized equipment, eventually I
may lift the hood of my vehicle and find nothing
but a little black box! At that point, when things
go wrong, I’ll probably have to seek the services
of a wizard rather than a technician!
The upside is that using less metal, plastic, and
rubber places less strain on the world’s dwin-
dling supply of raw materials. It also reduces
the amount of energy consumed by production
(as well as driving) and the number of disposal
facilities required to process all the worn and
broken stuff that gets thrown away. So let’s
hope that the trend continues, wizards and all.

Throttle-body fuel injection
Throttle-body fuel injection (TBI) was the first fuel injection system to
become popular as carburetors were being phased out. This system is less
complicated than the multi-port fuel injection systems found on more recent
vehicles (refer to the preceding sections), but it’s also less efficient. Instead
of using individual fuel injectors to pump the fuel into each cylinder, the TBI
system mixes the fuel and air together right in the throttle assembly of the
vehicle. Along the way, sensors monitor air flow, throttle position, tempera-
ture, and other factors and report back to the ECU (engine control unit).
You can see the parts of this system in Figure 7-7. Some of these systems use
solenoids to spray the fuel into the airstream in the throttle through a fuel
injector nozzle.
If you have a vehicle with throttle-body fuel injection, here’s how it works:
1. An electrical fuel pump pumps fuel to the throttle body assembly. The
throttle body assembly looks similar to a carburetor and houses the fuel
injector(s) and a fuel pressure regulator.
2. The fuel pressure regulator maintains proper fuel pressure and meters
unused fuel back to the fuel tank.
3. A computer controls one or two fuel injectors mounted in the throttle
body assembly. The computer applies electrical current to the injector
solenoid for the proper duration (called the injector pulse width), and
fuel under pressure is then injected and mixed with air as it passes
through the throttle on its way to the engine.

The Engine Block: Where the Fuel
System and Ignition System Meet
Whether accomplished through a fuel injection system or a carburetor, after
the air and fuel unite in the form of a vapor and the spark plugs are ready to
provide that all-important spark of ignition, all that’s needed is a spot for that
passionate meeting to take place. The rendezvous occurs in your engine’s
cylinders, and it’s truly a triumph of timing (as any successful rendezvous
must be!).
In this section, I describe the major parts of the engine and explain how they
create the power that drives your vehicle.
Major engine components
Inside the engine are several fascinating parts, which you can see in Figure 7-8.
At the top are the cylinder heads. These contain the mechanisms that allow
the valves to open and close, letting the fuel/air mixture into the cylinders
and allowing the burnt exhaust gases to leave. Below the cylinder heads is
the engine block itself. This piece contains the cylinders, which contain the
pistons.
Figure 7-8: The main parts of an internal combustion engine.
So what’s a cylinder? It’s a hollow iron pipe that’s capped at one end and has
a spark plug inserted into and through that cap so the plug’s electrodes are
available for action (see Figure 7-9).

The cylinders in the engines on vehicles with rear-wheel drive often run
from the front of the engine back toward the firewall at the rear of the engine
compartment. On other vehicles, particularly those with front-wheel drive,
the cylinders in the engine are set sideways, parallel to the wheels. These
engines are called transverse engines (see Figure 7-10).

Engines that have a single row of cylinders are called in-line engines (some-
times called straight engines). V-type engines have two parallel rows of cylin-
ders set on an angle to each other. On rotary engines (found on some Mazdas),
there’s a single large internal chamber inside which a three-lobed, or triangular,
rotor revolves. The rotor makes an eccentric or uneven revolution, continually
forming smaller chambers in which occur the same four-stroke power cycle
as in a conventional internal combustion engine (the next section describes
the four-stroke power cycle).
Each cylinder has a number, determined by the particular engine’s cylinder
sequence. You can find descriptions and illustrations of the cylinder sequence
for a variety of engines in Chapter 5.
Inside each cylinder is a metal piston that fits snugly against the walls of the
cylinder so that nothing can get past it. On the outside of the piston are
piston rings that ensure a snug fit. The cylinder also has other openings
besides the ones for the spark plug and the piston. These are for the intake
valves and the exhaust valves.
At the bottom of the engine is the crankcase, which houses the crankshaft
and the oil pan. Coolant circulates throughout the engine to keep it cool, and
oil circulates to keep the parts moving freely.
Now that you’ve met the “players,” you’re ready to get on to the main event
in which they play their roles: the fiery meeting of air, fuel, and fire known as
the four-stroke power cycle.
The four-stroke power cycle
The piston rides up and down inside the cylinder on a connecting rod that
attaches to the crankshaft, causing the crankshaft to turn. Each movement of
the piston is called a stroke. Four strokes — down, up, down, up — complete
the cycle that creates the power to drive the engine. This process is aptly
called the four-stroke power cycle. The four-stroke power cycle varies slightly
depending on whether your vehicle’s engine is a conventional internal com-
bustion engine or a diesel engine. I cover the conventional internal combus-
tion engine in this section and the power cycle in diesel engines in Chapter 9.
Here’s what happens on each stroke of the piston in a conventional internal
combustion engine:
1. Intake stroke: See Figure 7-11. When the piston moves down, it creates a
vacuum in the top portion of the cylinder (where the piston was at the
end of its last upstroke). Air can’t get in from the bottom of the cylinder
because the rings on the piston seal it off. Then the intake valves, con-
veniently located in the cylinder head, open up and let the fuel/air mix-
ture into the cylinder. This mixture rushes in to fill the vacuum left by
the piston.

2. Compression stroke: See Figure 7-12. The piston moves back up, com-
pressing the fuel/air mixture into a tiny space between the top of the
piston and the top of the cylinder. This space is called the combustion
chamber and also happens to be where the end of the spark plug enters
the cylinder. The difference between the total space inside the cylinder
and the space inside the combustion chamber is called the compres-
sion ratio. It indicates that the pressure has been raised from normal
air pressure of 15 psi (pounds per square inch) to hundreds of psi,
which makes the resulting explosion much more intense.
At this point, the intake valves have closed, so the compressed mixture
can’t get out. (The intake and exhaust valves create airtight seals to
ensure that nothing can get past them when they’re closed.)
3. Power stroke: See Figure 7-13. The spark plug produces a spark across
the gap between its electrodes. This spark ignites the compressed
fuel/air mixture. Then the burning fuel/air mixture ignites, creating
intense pressure that forces the piston down again. The power that
pushed the piston down is transmitted, via the connecting rod, to the
crankshaft. It then travels, via the drive train, through the clutch or
torque converter, the transmission, the driveshaft, the differential,
and so on to the wheels. (A quick overview of this process appears in
Chapter 4.)
4. Exhaust stroke: See Figure 7-14. The piston moves up again, pushing the
burned gases up with it. Then the exhaust valve opens and lets the
burned gases out into the exhaust manifold. From there, the burned
gases travel through the exhaust system (which includes antipollution
devices), through the muffler, and out the tailpipe into the environment.
The cylinders don’t fire all at once. To keep the engine properly balanced
with all that action going on, they fire in a particular order called the firing
order. So while one cylinder is going through the intake stroke, another will
be at the compression stroke, and so on. The firing order varies from one
engine to another, and Chapter 5 has descriptions and illustrations of the
firing orders for a variety of engine types.
When you understand the four-stroke power cycle it’s easier to see why the
diagnostic inspectioins and service required by your warranty are so impor-
tant. Spark plugs are checked and replaced because, if the spark is insuffi-
cient or the timing is off, the result is less power and incompletely burned
fuel. Increased air pollution and fuel consumption are high prices to pay for
stretching the intervals between spark plug replacements, especially because
they’re much less frequent than before! Chapters 6 and 8 show you what you
can do to help keep your electrical system and fuel system in tune.

Chapter 7: The Traditional Fuel System: The Heart and Lungs of Your Car

Supercharging with Turbochargers
A supercharger is a pump that compresses the intake air and forces it into the
cylinders of a gasoline-powered car. Because superchargers are usually belt-
driven by the engine (instead of being driven by recycled exhaust gases as a
turbocharger is), they consume engine power to increase engine power.
Because they’re not fuel-efficient, they’re generally used only to increase the
speed of “high-performance,” low-efficiency vehicles. Supercharging should-
n’t be confused with turbocharging.
Turbocharging means to use a turbine — powered by the engine’s waste
gases — to force greater amounts of air into an engine’s cylinders. This
process produces more power in both diesel and conventional vehicles
because they run on a greater volume of air and fuel. The more air the engine
can take in, the bigger the bang during the power stroke of the four-stroke
power cycle. At first, cars were turbocharged to perform better on race-
tracks, but when automakers began to put smaller engines in larger vehicles
to lighten their weight and conserve fuel, turbocharging provided a way to
increase the engine’s power so that these bigger vehicles wouldn’t be slug-
gish on the road.
Here is how turbocharging works:
1. The hot exhaust gases leave the exhaust manifold, but instead of
going directly through the exhaust system and out of the vehicle via the
tailpipe, they first pass through a turbine, which is just a fan that’s set in
motion by the expanding gases.
2. A shaft connects the fan to a compressor, which blows fresh, filtered air
into the cylinders. (On a carbureted vehicle, the compressor takes the
fuel/air mixture and blows it into the cylinders.)
3. The excess and used exhaust fumes pass from the turbine to the exhaust
system and continue on their way to the tailpipe and out into the air.
The more load on the engine, the hotter and faster the exhaust fumes that
turn the turbine. The faster they turn it, the more air the compressor sends
to the engine and the more power the engine can produce. This unique way
of converting exhaust gas energy into mechanical power has a nice merry-go-
round effect.
Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Well, usually the first thing an engineer learns is
“The simpler, the better,” or as the Zen monks put it, “Less is more.” (From
engineering to philosophy in a couple of paragraphs! Maybe I ought to
change the name of this book to Zen and the Art of Auto Maintenance.)
140
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

When it came to designing diesel cars, the pressing problem was how to
change a car with a reputation of being noisy, underpowered, and smoky into
a faster, quieter, more-efficient vehicle that could meet the requirements set
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The results have been
heartening indeed. A turbocharger can increase the power of a diesel vehicle
by 50 percent while lowering its fuel consumption by 20 to 25 percent! What’s
more, because the turbine itself is powered by the hot gases that normally
would go out of the exhaust pipe, you don’t need to provide anything extra to
drive it. What a wonderful example of recycling!
Check out Chapter 9 for more about diesels, especially the new environmen-
tally friendly innovations that have turned diesel-driven vehicles from poten-
tial causes of cancer into efficient eco-friendly vehicles. The innovations also
are turning overburdened garbage dumps into recycling opportunities.
The Exhaust System
The exhaust system, shown in Figure 7-15, is the waste disposal system of
your vehicle. When the fuel system brings the fuel and air together in the
cylinders to drive the vehicle, waste products are formed, and some of them
are toxic. This section deals with how the exhaust system works to detoxify
or reduce these toxins before they’re released into the environment.
Now that people all over the world are finally aware of how toxic exhaust
gases can be for people and how drastically they affect global warming, it’s
really important to understand the system that works to detoxify these pollu-
tants and disburse them as safely as possible.
As the exhaust gases pass from the cylinders in the engine through the 
muffler to the tailpipe at the rear of the vehicle and into the air, emissions-
control devices — including the PCV valve, various sensors, a catalytic 
converter, and other components — work to reduce or remove the harmful
substances and recycle unburned fuel vapors.
There’s little you can do to maintain or repair most of the parts in the
exhaust system except to check and clean your PCV valve and replace it, if
necessary; and troubleshoot to see whether your catalytic converter needs
to be replaced (Chapter 8 has instructions for both of these tasks). If the con-
verter, the tailpipe, or the muffler needs to be replaced, have the job done by
a professional.
The following sections explore each of the major parts of the exhaust system
in . . . exhaustive? . . . detail.
141
Chapter 7: The Traditional Fuel System: The Heart and Lungs of Your Car

Figure 7-15: The exhaust system.
The muffler
Exhaust pipes carry what’s left of the exhaust gases through a muffler, which
controls the noise of the escaping gases to the tailpipe and out of the vehicle
(see Figure 7-16). If it fails, you can get a ticket, probably for disturbing the
peace! Besides keeping the noise down, the muffler also has an effect on the
pressure required to pass the exhaust gases through it, which creates the
“back pressure” that the engine requires
to run efficiently and affects the temper-
ature and therefore the efficiency of the
catalytic converter.
The next sections take a closer look at
two emissions control devices that
play a major part in cleaning up exhaust
gases and have had a major effect on
reducing air pollution.
The PCV valve
The PCV valve (shown in Figure 7-17) is part of the positive crankcase ventila-
tion system, which reroutes unburned gases, or blow-by, from the crankcase
to the intake manifold and back to the engine, where they can be reburned in
the cylinders. This process cuts the amount of pollution released into the
environment. It also increases fuel economy because unburned fuel in the
blow-by is consumed the second time around. The PCV valve also extends the
life of the engine by reducing the water vapor and acid deposits that contaminate
oil and form engine sludge. Figure 7-18 shows you how the PCV valve works.

Figure 7-16: The muffler.

The catalytic converter
The catalytic converter (shown in Figure 7-19) is usually attached to the
exhaust pipe just after the exhaust manifold pipes. It was developed to deal
with smog by further reducing the toxic substances in the exhaust gases
before they can pollute the air. The catalytic converter is basically a cylinder
filled with either little ceramic beads or a honeycomb structure coated with
minute amounts of expensive metal catalysts that interact with the pollutants:
 Reduction catalysts (rhodium and palladium) turn the NOx (nitrogen
oxide) emissions to oxygen and nitrogen, which exist in the air we
breathe.
 Oxidation catalysts (palladium and platinum) turn carbon monoxide
and hydrocarbon into harmless carbon dioxide and water.
The use of catalytic converters brought about another development that has
been of great benefit to the environment. Originally, the lead in gasoline
fouled catalytic converters, rendering them less effective and eventually
destroying them, so legislation was passed to remove lead from fuel. Because
lead is toxic to humans and other animals, we’ve all benefited greatly from its
removal from automotive fuel and its emissions.

Other emissions control devices
Other emissions control devices include an exhaust gas recirculation system
(EGR). An EGR valve on the intake manifold allows a small percentage of
the exhaust gases back into the intake manifold, which lowers the peak 
combustion temperature in the combustion chambers and results in lower
NOx emissions. Also, oxygen sensors tell the ECU about excess oxygen in
the exhaust gases so that the ECU can correctly control the fuel/air mix-
ture. Air injection systems and various other gizmos also help clean up the
exhaust before it enters the air.
Engineers are developing new ways to clean up and reduce automotive emis-
sions every day. All you need to know is that the parts and processes are
there, and they’re working to keep you healthy. But the healthiest thing you
can do is drive the most-efficient vehicle possible, as little as possible! To get
more specific, Chapter 9 tells you about new diesel engines and fuels that 
not only burn clean but also can reduce the burden on overflowing garbage
dumps. Chapter 10 covers a variety of hybrid and alternatively fueled 
vehicles that may inspire you to trade in Old Faithful for a 21st-century 
set of wheels.

F
uel system problems may occur for a variety of reasons. Some remedies,
such as replacing a fuel filter, are relatively inexpensive. Others, such as
replacing a fuel pump, are costly. Because unethical mechanics often try the
more expensive solutions first and work backwards to the cheaper ones, you
end up paying for all the time, labor, and parts involved. You can avoid the
expense of repairs that don’t solve the problem by using the instructions in
this chapter to check things out before heading for professional help. If you
can do the job yourself, great! If you can’t, you will still be able to discuss the
less-expensive possible solutions with your service facility and request that
they try them first. If these work, they won’t waste their time (and your
money) on lengthy test drives and diagnostics. At the very least, try to do the
simple adjustments and maintenance tasks (such as changing the air filter)
yourself. Doing so will cost you little in time and money and may prevent
major repair bills. Plus you can brag about doing it yourself!
If your vehicle has fuel injection, air and fuel filters, and PCV valves, they
should be checked and replaced, if necessary, at the intervals specified in
your owner’s manual, or you may risk voiding your warranty. Otherwise,
your fuel system should just hum along for years. If it breaks down, don’t
monkey with it; take it to a professional for repairs. If your vehicle has a car-
buretor, it requires periodic tune-ups to keep it operating at peak efficiency.
Regardless of what kind of fuel system your vehicle has, it requires the basic
maintenance (such as changing air and fuel filters and PCV valves) mentioned
in this chapter. All the work in this chapter is under-the-hood stuff, so you
don’t need to jack up your vehicle, and you probably don’t have to indulge in
any acrobatics to reach the scene of the action.

Before you undertake any of the work in this chapter, be sure to read (or
reread) Chapter 7. If you understand where the part you’re dealing with fits
into the system and what it does, you’ll have a clearer idea of why the work
you’re doing is necessary and how it needs to be accomplished. This knowl-
edge not only makes the job easier and more pleasant, but it also helps you
locate each part and understand how it functions. Also check out the cover-
age of safety, buying parts, and taking things apart and putting them together
again in Chapter 1. Believe me, the aggravation you can prevent with just a
little preparation is well worth the time!
If your vehicle isn’t due for regular maintenance and it isn’t starting right up
in the morning, starts conking out at stoplights or running roughly, or is pro-
ducing readings that indicate problems on the electronic diagnostic machine
at your repair shop, it may be a good idea to try the work outlined in this
chapter before opting for major surgery. Even if it turns out that the problem
calls for more drastic measures, you’ll still have taken care of maintenance
that would have been necessary before too long.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Maintaining Your Air Filter
On most modern vehicles, the air filter is under the hood inside a rectangular
cold air collector box that’s located up near the front of the engine compart-
ment. Figure 8-1 shows you what it looks like. (Other vehicles, including those
with carburetors, have big round metal air cleaners that are hard to miss.)
As you can see in Figure 8-1, the air cleaner has a large air inlet duct (also
called the air intake hose) connected to it. Loosen the hose clamp that seals
it to the box, and then undo all the screws, clamps, or wing nuts that hold the
lid of the box in place. Put the fasteners you removed somewhere safe so that
they don’t roll off into oblivion. Open the lid of the box and . . . voila! . . . you
should find the air filter inside (see Figure 8-1). Lift out the old filter (it isn’t
fastened down) and take a look at it.
Some older vehicles have permanent air filters, and some off-road vehicles
have more-complex filters with wet and dry elements. Clean and replace
these according to the instructions in your owner’s manual. If you don’t find
a pleated paper, cotton, or gauze filter inside your air cleaner, you probably
have one of these alternatives.
146
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

Figure 8-1: The cold air collector box houses the air filter.
Checking and cleaning your air filter 
and cold air collector box
To figure out whether your air filter needs to be replaced, just hold it up to
the sun or to a strong light. Can you see the light streaming through it? If not,
try dropping it lightly, bottom side down, on a hard surface. Doing so should
jar some dirt loose. If the filter is still too dirty to see through after you’ve
dropped it a few times and it looks as though it just needs a bit of cleaning,
you can try to clean it following the directions below. If that doesn’t work,
you need a new one.
To clean a pleated air filter either use an air hose to blow the dirt off (not
through) it or a vacuum to suck it out. For both methods, handle the filter
gently to avoid crushing the pleats. Keep the nozzle of the air hose or vacuum
cleaner several inches away from the filter — don’t jam it up against it. And if
you’re using compressed air, do it away from the vehicle to avoid blowing the
dirt around under the hood.
If the interior of the box is fouled with dust or sand, before you clean the box
paste some duct tape over the open end of the air intake hose so that the dirt
can’t get in. Then either use the compressed air hose to blow the dirt out of
the box or the vacuum cleaner to suck it out.
I prefer a “hand vac” for this job. You don’t have to buy a compressed air gun
or schlep the car to a service station to use theirs (and some of them are now
charging for the air!). Also, with a hand vac, you run less risk of blowing the
dirty air out of the cold air collector box and into something else. I keep a
battery-powered hand vac in the trunk of my car to do stuff like this as well
as to get the dirt off the floor mats and to clean the upholstery.

Chapter 8: Keeping Your Fuel System in Tune

Buying and replacing an air filter
Because the air filter extracts dirt and dust particles from the air, you should
change it at least once a year or every 20,000 miles, whichever comes first —
unless yours gets very dirty before then. If you do most of your driving in a
dusty or sandy area, you may need to replace your air filter every 5,000 miles
or less. If a road trip takes you to such an area, it’s a good idea to check the
air filter right after you return.
When buying an air filter, keep the following points in mind:
 Look for well-known, quality-brand filters, especially if you’re buying
at discount stores. Unknown brands sell for very little, but they aren’t
always of good quality, and if your air filter lets a lot of junk get into 
your fuel system, you may find that the cheap filter is very costly in the
long run.
 If you need help determining which air filter you need, go to your
local auto supply store or to the parts department at your dealership.
Give them your vehicle’s make, model, and year, and they’ll select the
right part number for your vehicle.
When you have the correct part number for the filter, enter it in the
Specifications Record in Appendix B.
 To save yourself a trip back to the auto supply store, take the time to
open your cold air collector box and check the filter you purchase
against your current filter while you’re still in the store parking lot.
Make sure that the filter you get matches your old filter in size and
shape. It should look exactly like the old one. If it doesn’t, you’ve bought
the wrong filter. If the new filter looks right, replace the old filter with the
new one, making sure that the rubber rim is facing up to create a seal
between the filter and the box.
When the cleaned filter — or the new one — is in place, put the lid back on
the box and replace all the stuff that held it on. Then, remove the duct tape
from the open end of the air intake hose and use the hose clamp to reattach
it to the box. Done!
Replacing a Fuel Filter
Unless your vehicle suddenly starts to hesitate or run roughly, fuel filters on
modern fuel-injected vehicles only need to be checked — and replaced, if
necessary — during the tune-up inspections specified in your owner’s manual.
The likelihood of a fuel filter malfunctioning is significantly greater if you tend
to ride around with an almost-empty fuel tank. (See the sidebar “Why you
should keep the fuel tank full” to find out why this is a bad idea.)
148
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

If your vehicle starts to run roughly as soon as you fill it up with gas, contami-
nants in the fuel may have plugged up the filter. In that case, it should be
replaced immediately. To decide whether you can do this job yourself, you need
to know what type of fuel filter your vehicle has and whether you can tackle the
job. Check your owner’s manual or a service manual for your vehicle’s make,
model, and year to find the filter and see what’s involved in changing it.
Deciding whether to change 
a fuel filter yourself
Changing the filter on a fuel-injected vehicle can be tricky. On fuel-injected vehi-
cles, you need to disable the fuel pump to relieve the pressure on the fuel
lines, which may be secured to the filter with clamps, threaded fittings, or spe-
cial quick-connect fittings. Lines with threaded fittings require a special flare-nut
line wrench. Lines with special quick-connect fittings may require special tools
to disconnect them. Ask the clerk at an auto parts store or the service depart-
ment at your dealership which type of filter your vehicle has. If doing this infre-
quent job requires purchasing special tools, it’s probably cheaper to have it
done by a technician. If not, the first thing you need to do is find the filter.
Locating the fuel filter
Your owner’s manual should show you where your fuel filter is and whether
there’s more than one on your vehicle. If it doesn’t, ask someone in the service
149
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Fuel System in Tune
Why you should keep the fuel tank full
Because the space in the fuel tank above the
fuel level is filled with air, and because air con-
tains quite a bit of water vapor, the water in the
air tends to condense on the sides of the fuel
tank and elsewhere on cool mornings. This
water vapor can rust the insides of a metal fuel
tank, it can mix with the fuel in any tank — metal
or plastic — and it can act in a variety of pesky
ways to keep your vehicle from operating effi-
ciently. If you keep your fuel tank well-filled,
there’s less room for air and therefore less
water vapor hanging around. This is an excel-
lent reason for not driving around until your fuel
gauge reads “Empty.”
Another reason for making those extra trips to
the gas station is that the rust formed by the
water vapor in the air tends to sink to the bottom
of the fuel tank. These sediments can do no
harm as long as they’re happily sloshing around
in the bottom of the tank. But if you let the fuel
level in the tank get too low, the fuel fed to your
engine could be like the last bit of coffee in the
bottom of the pot — full of sediment that tends
to stick in the throat. Some fuel tanks have fil-
ters to prevent this junk from getting through to
the engine, but the filters can get choked up if
you consistently drive on an empty tank.

department at your dealership or consult a service manual for your vehicle’s
make, model, and year. (Although it’s a good idea to own one, you can usually
find these manuals at your local library.)
If your engine has fuel-injection, your fuel filter is located somewhere in the
high-pressure fuel line, either under the vehicle near the fuel tank (see
Figure 8-2) or under the hood in the fuel line near the engine (see Figure 8-3).
Figure 8-2: A fuel filter located under the vehicle near the fuel tank.
Some vehicles also have a fuel filter in the fuel
pump as well as a filter screen inside the fuel
tank. If they get blocked up, only a professional
should deal with them.
On some vehicles, the fuel filter is found anywhere
in the fuel line from the fuel tank to the fuel injec-
tors and is held in place by metal clamps on either
side of it. Some fuel filters on fuel-injected engines
require special tools to disconnect the fuel lines in
order to get to the filters.
Don’t use a work light with an incandescent bulb
when changing a fuel filter. Fuel that drips on the
bulb can cause it to break and start a fire. Use a
flashlight if you need to shed some light on the
subject.

Replacing a fuel filter
Here are step-by-step instructions for changing a fuel filter. Before you get
started, read them carefully and make sure that you want to do this job 
yourself.
1. Relieve the pressure in the fuel line before disconnecting it. To do so,
you have to disable the electric fuel pump before you start the engine. 
To disable the fuel pump, do the following:
1. With the engine off, remove the fuel pump fuse from the fuse box
(your owner’s manual should show you where it is), following the
instructions in Chapter 6.
2. Make sure that the parking brake is on and that the vehicle is in
Park or Neutral, and then start the engine. It won’t run very long
after you start it up, but the pressure in the fuel lines will be
reduced.
3. Turn off the engine. With the fuel pump disabled, you’re ready to
disconnect the fuel lines from the filter.
2. Look at the old filter and the new one before disconnecting anything.
You should see an arrow stamped on both filters that shows in which
direction the fuel flows through it. If the new one doesn’t have an arrow
on it, look to see in what direction the old filter is installed so that you
can tell which end of the new filter goes where.
3. Remove whatever is holding the old filter in place.
4. Put the new filter on with the arrow facing toward the engine or in
the same position as the old one was.
5. Replace whatever holds the filter in place, and make sure it’s secure.
6. Replace the fuse for the fuel pump in the fuse box.
7. Make sure that the parking brake is on and that the vehicle is in Park
or Neutral, and then start the engine and check for leaks around the
filter.
Replacing an insert 
in a fuel filter
If your vehicle has a fuel filter with an insert that can be replaced, follow 
Step 1 in the previous section to disable the fuel pump. Then open the cap 
on the filter, lift out the old insert, and drop in the new one facing in the 
151
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Fuel System in Tune

same direction as the old one was (see Figure 8-4).
Be sure to replace the cap securely. Then replace
the fuse for the fuel pump, check to be sure the
vehicle is in Neutral or Park with the parking
brake on, start the engine, and check the filter 
for leaks.
Servicing the PCV Valve
The PCV valve (positive crankcase ventilation
valve) is a vital part of the emissions control
system on most vehicles. Chapter 7 tells you all
about both the valve and the rest of the emissions
control system.
Not every vehicle has a PCV valve, but most do. If
yours has one, and if your engine has been idling
roughly or a malfunction indicator light goes
on, check the PCV valve (shown in Figure 8-5) 
to make sure that it isn’t clogged with sludge from
the contaminants in the exhaust fumes
or stuck in the wide-open position.
Car manufacturers suggest that PCV
valves be cleaned or replaced after
somewhere between 20,000 to 50,000
miles of driving. Consult your owner’s
manual to see where the PCV valve is
located on your vehicle and what the
recommended service intervals are. The
valve is usually replaced during sched-
uled tune-ups, but depending on its
type and location, you may be able to
check, clean, and replace it yourself.
This section has instructions for doing
all the jobs.
Locating the PCV valve
The PCV valve is usually plugged into a rubber grommet in the valve cover
(see Figure 8-6), although it may be located on or near the intake manifold
(see Figures 8-6 and 8-7). A hose leading to the PCV valve is often kept in
place by a clamp. Sometimes there’s a little L-shaped housing on the end of
the hose that covers the end of the valve.

Checking the PCV valve
There are several ways to check whether
your PCV valve is functioning properly. Pick
the one that seems easiest for you (the engine
should be idling no matter which method you choose):
 Method 1: Following the instructions in the next section, remove the
PCV valve from the valve cover with the hose still attached. Then place
your finger over the open end of the hose (see Figure 8-8). If the valve’s
working well, you will feel strong suction. Try shaking the valve. If it’s
unobstructed, it should rattle. If it’s fouled, the rattle will be indistinct or
non-existent.
 Method 2: Remove the cap from the oil filler hole on the valve cover
and place a stiff piece of paper over the opening. If your PCV valve is
working properly, the paper should be sucked against the hole within
seconds.

the valve cover, with the hose that
leads to it removed.

If the valve doesn’t seem to be working
properly, before you go to the trouble
to replace it, try cleaning it to see if
that makes a difference (see the later
section that covers cleaning the
valve). If that doesn’t work, replace it
with a new valve (following the
instructions in the next section). The
good news is a PCV valve isn’t terribly
expensive.
Removing and
replacing the 
PCV valve
Follow these instructions to remove your vehicle’s PCV valve in order to
check, clean, or replace it with a new one:
1. Locate the PCV valve and loosen the hose clamp if there is one, or pull
the little L-shaped housing off the end of the valve.
2. Remove the valve.
Some PCV valves are held in place with a rubber grommet and can just
be pulled free. Others are threaded into place. If you can’t unscrew the
valve by hand, try to grasp its base with the open end of a combination
wrench or a small crescent wrench. (See the “Wrenches” section in
Chapter 3 for more on these tools.)
3. While you have the PCV valve off, check the hose and the hose clamps
or grommet. (You don’t want to have to make two trips to the auto
parts store!)
Remove the hose and blow through it. If the hose is dry, brittle, soft,
spongy, or full of sludge or hard deposits, you should replace it. If the
clamps are rusty or the grommet looks deteriorated, you should replace
them, too. In Chapter 12, you find out about the various types of hose
clamps available and which kind you should buy for your vehicle.
4. If the new valve screws into place, do this by hand to avoid stripping
the threads in the valve cover.
Make sure that the valve is seated securely (it should stick just a little
when you try to unscrew it again), but don’t over-tighten it!
5. Reconnect the hose to the PCV valve.
6. Start the engine, and check around the PCV valve for leaks.
154

Figure 8-8: One way to check your
PCV valve.

Cleaning the PCV valve
If your vehicle’s PCV valve isn’t working, you can clean it yourself by immers-
ing it in carburetor cleaner or solvent your auto supply store deems suitable.
There should be no gummy deposits or discoloration on a clean valve. If your
PCV valve must be replaced, buy a new one, remove the old valve, and insert
the new one in its place (refer to the previous section for instructions on
replacement).
Troubleshooting Catalytic Converters
The catalytic converter is a very important part of the emissions control
system on your vehicle. (Chapter 7 tells you what this part looks like and
how it works.) It’s usually good for the life of a vehicle, but occasionally it
does fail. The best thing you can do is be alert for signs of trouble and head
for a service facility if you suspect that the catalytic converter is malfunction-
ing. Technicians will put your vehicle on an electronic diagnostic machine to
locate the source of the problem, possibly remove the oxygen sensor from
the exhaust manifold or exhaust pipe ahead of the catalytic converter to see
if that changes things, and replace the catalytic converter, if necessary.
Here are five ways to tell that something may be wrong with your catalytic
converter:
 Your vehicle’s fuel efficiency suddenly drops.
 Your vehicle doesn’t accelerate when you step on the gas pedal.
 Your vehicle may refuse to start.
 Your vehicle fails an emissions test.
 The MIL or Check Engine light comes on.
The most common cause of failure in a catalytic converter in an older car is
that it becomes so clogged that the exhaust gases can’t get through it to the
muffler and out of the car. (If air can’t get out the rear of the vehicle, it can’t
come in the front end, so the engine dies because no air is coming in to form
the fuel/air mixture.)
Every car sold in the U.S. since 1996 has had an OBD (On-Board Diagnostic) II
system that tests the catalytic converter (among many other things). If the
unit allows too much pollution to escape from the tailpipe, it illuminates the
MIL and produces a trouble code that can be read by a technician with
what’s called a “scan tool.” 
The catalytic converter is sensitive to changes in the contents and temperature
of the exhaust gases, so another possible cause for failure is if the cylinder
head gasket is damaged, allowing oil or coolant to get into the combustion
155
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Fuel System in Tune

chamber and be burned in the cylinders. Also, if your ignition system isn’t
operating properly, unburned fuel in the exhaust gases can cause the catalytic
converter to wear out or break down. This is another good reason for going for
tune-ups at specified intervals!
It’s against the law in many states to remove a catalytic converter and run a
vehicle without one.
Because the catalytic converter can become extremely hot, it’s important not
to park your vehicle over a bed of dry grass or dry leaves, which could catch
fire and destroy not only your vehicle but also the surrounding area!
Checking the Compression 
in the Cylinders
If your vehicle has been running roughly or seems
to be losing power, it’s possible that there’s a lack
of pressure in one or more of the cylinders.
Without enough pressure, the fuel/air mixture
doesn’t ignite efficiently. If one or more cylinders
has a good deal less pressure than the others, the
engine doesn’t run evenly.
So why wouldn’t there be enough pressure?
Because something is letting the pressure
escape. Where can it go? Basically, three places:
either out through one of the valve openings
(because the valve is improperly adjusted or so
worn that it doesn’t close properly) or down past
the rings on the piston or through a blown head
gasket. These rings prevent the pressure at the
top of a cylinder from escaping and the oil that
lubricates the engine from entering a cylinder.
When the rings get worn, oil gets in and pressure
gets out.
To determine whether pressure’s escaping from
the engine, you need to check the compression in
the cylinders. For this job, you need a compression gauge (see Figure 8-9).
This device tests the amount of pressure that the piston exerts on the fuel/air
mixture before the spark plug fires the mixture. Your compression gauge can
tell you whether one or more of your cylinders isn’t firing efficiently and
whether your rings or valves are worn or out of adjustment. These gauges
don’t cost much, and they’re quick and easy to use. Some gauges screw into
the spark plug opening, and others have to be held in place.
156
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 
Figure 8-9: A compression
gauge.

Checking compression is easier if
you have someone to assist you,
especially if your gauge needs to be
held in place (see Figure 8-10).
If your engine is covered by a
shield, carefully remove any dust
on the surface of the shield before
you remove it. If removing the
shield involves removing other
parts that may be damaged in the
process, have a professional check
the compression for you.
Here’s how to use a compression
gauge:
1. Unless you buy or borrow a remote starter switch, have someone sit
in the driver’s seat with the engine off, the gearshift in Park or
Neutral, and the parking brake on.
2. The next step depends on the type of distributor you have:
• On vehicles with distributors: Pull the big wire that leads to the
coil from the center of the distributor cap, and lean the metal
connector against an unpainted metal surface as far away from the
spark plugs as possible.
157
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Fuel System in Tune
Poor maintenance results in poor performance
Poor maintenance can cause the rings and
cylinder walls to become thinner with wear,
creating a gap between them that allows gases
to bypass the rings. This reduces compression
in the cylinders and, as you know from the sec-
tion on the four-stroke power cycle in Chap-
ter 7, you don’t get as big a bang for your buck,
so your vehicle loses power. Piston rings can be
replaced, but it’s an expensive job. Before you
allow anyone to undertake a “ring job,” check
the compression to see whether your car really
needs it and be sure that the vehicle’s blue
book value warrants such a costly investment.
You may save money in the long run by trading
in the old “fuel hog” for a more efficient vehicle.
Figure 8-10: Checking compression.

• On vehicles with distributorless ignitions: Disconnect the electri-
cal connector at the ignition control module. If you’re not sure
what to disconnect, ask a mechanic.
3. For safety’s sake, disable the fuel injection system so that gasoline
mist won’t spray out of the spark plug holes and possibly ignite.
Remove the fuse labeled “Fuel Pump”; then start the car and let it run
until it stalls from lack of gasoline. If you can’t find the right fuse and
you want to do a compression test anyway, be especially careful.
4. Before you remove them, label the boots that connect each spark plug
wire and each spark plug so that you can remember which plug each
boot was attached to.
If you get the plug wires mixed up, you can really screw up your engine.
5. Remove all the spark plugs and lay them down in a clean place.
Keep the labeled plugs in order to insure that you return each one to its
original cylinder when the time comes.
6. If you have a remote starter switch, connect one clip to the battery’s
positive or “plus” terminal, and the other to small terminal of the
starter solenoid.
7. Insert the compression gauge into the hole in the engine where the
first spark plug screwed into the cylinder (refer to Figure 8-10).
8. If you don’t have a remote starter switch, have a friend turn on the
ignition until the engine cranks over about six times. Otherwise, press
the button of the remote starter switch.
Be sure to keep the gauge plug firmly inserted while the engine is crank-
ing. (The car won’t run because the engine has been disabled.)
9. Look at the gauge and write down the reading, which will be in psi
(pounds per square inch). Then reset the gauge.
10. Repeat Steps 6 through 8 for each of the other cylinders and don’t
forget to reset the gauge and crank the engine each time.
11. After you’ve tested each cylinder, look at the readings.
The highest and lowest shouldn’t vary by more than 15 percent. If one or
more of the cylinders reads well below the rest, use a trigger-type oil can
to send a good squirt of motor oil down the spark plug opening, and
retest the compression of that cylinder with the gauge. If the reading is
the same, the valves either are worn (and letting pressure escape) or
are out of adjustment. If the reading rises dramatically after you insert
158
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

the oil, you probably need new rings on the piston in that cylinder. If
the pressure recorded by the gauges is less than 100 psi, the cylinder
definitely isn’t mechanically sound.
After you know what’s wrong, you have to decide whether the problem
is worth correcting. If your vehicle was on its way out anyway, it’s time
to get rid of it. If it’s otherwise in good shape, you may want to have the
engine rebuilt or replaced with a new or remanufactured one.
12. Replace each spark plug in the cylinder it came from.
Make sure that the ignition is off before you reconnect the spark plug
wires, and be sure to put the correct spark plug wire boot back on each
plug. Screw the plugs in by hand to avoid damaging the threads in the
aluminum valve cover.
If the “Check Engine” warning light comes on after you perform a compres-
sion test and doesn’t disappear in a couple of days, have it reset at the 
dealership.
What to Do When All Else Fails
If you try all the fixes that I cover in this chapter and your vehicle still isn’t
idling properly, isn’t starting up in the morning without a hassle, or is hesitat-
ing or stalling at corners or when you accelerate sharply, then you need extra
help. But you don’t have to seek help like a lamb being led to the slaughter!
If you want to drive into a service facility like someone who knows the score
and is prepared to judge intelligently whether the proposed remedies are
necessary, here’s what to do:
1. Ask the people at your service facility whether they intend to test
your ignition system in case that’s the culprit.
2. Ask whether they intend to test your exhaust gases to see whether
you’re running on a fuel/air mixture that’s too lean or too rich or
whether your catalytic converter may be at fault.
Notice that I don’t say “tell them” because if you do and the work turns
out not to have been necessary, you’ll get charged for it anyway. Just
suggest that these may be the culprits to impress them with the fact that
you’re an informed customer (and no longer a dummy . . .).
159
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Fuel System in Tune

3. After they identify the problem, if the suggested remedy is costly or
seems overly drastic, get a second opinion at another service facility.
Even if your vehicle has a traditional internal combustion engine, you may
want to brush up on newer and more fuel-efficient alternatives that await you
when it’s time to buy a new one. Chapters 9 and 10 tell you all about vehicles
equipped with diesel engines and alternative fuel systems.

hink of this chapter as a mini-version of Auto Repair For Dummies devoted
entirely to diesel-powered vehicles. It explores the new generation of clean
diesel vehicles and explains how diesel engines work. It also provides instruc-
tions for maintaining and troubleshooting diesel-powered vehicles and for
finding a good diesel mechanic when your best efforts just aren’t enough.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Clean Diesels: Nontoxic Newcomers
Diesel-powered vehicles are popular in the large part of the world where
gasoline is very expensive or almost unavailable. In the United States and
Canada, up until recently diesel engines were found mainly in heavy equip-
ment, large trucks, buses, heavy-duty pickup trucks, and boats. Diesel-
powered passenger vehicles existed, but they had a reputation for being
noisy, underpowered, smelly, and carcinogenic. For a short period in the
1980s people overlooked those negatives when fuel shortages made diesel-
powered vehicles popular because they got 25 percent more miles per gallon
than gasoline engines and diesel fuel was less expensive than gasoline. They
soon fell out of favor because major carmakers dropped diesel engines into
vehicles that weren’t equipped to withstand the higher stress these engines
imposed.

The good news is that growing concern about the environment and the dis-
turbing news that emissions from high-sulfur diesel oil were contributing not
only to air pollution and global warming but to cancer as well produced leg-
islation that accelerated technological breakthroughs in diesel mechanics.
The result is a new generation of clean diesel vehicles (see Figure 9-1) that not
only perform efficiently but also have the potential to recycle waste products
into clean-burning sources of energy. U.S. federal law mandated significantly
lower emissions on diesel engines nationwide by late 2006, and modern fed-
eral standards have significantly reduced the levels of sulfur in diesel fuel.
As fuel prices rise and nations compete (sometimes violently) for dwindling
sources of oil, efficiency and power are excellent reasons for replacing your
gas-guzzler with a vehicle that saves you money because it goes farther on
less fuel and gives you the satisfaction of knowing that you’re doing your bit
to protect the environment.

The Pros and Cons of Diesels
If you’re considering buying a new set of wheels, take a good look at this
chapter on the new clean diesels as well as the alternatively fueled vehicles
that I cover in Chapter 10 before you decide what to buy. This section helps
you weigh the advantages and disadvantages of diesel-powered vehicles.
To help you accurately compare diesel vehicles with traditional gasoline-
powered and alternatively fueled vehicles, here are some commonly held
positive and negative beliefs about diesels, plus some facts to consider:

Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

PRO: Diesels get great mileage. This is true; they typically deliver 25 to 30
percent better fuel economy than similarly performing gasoline engines.
Diesels also can deliver as much or more fuel economy than traditional gaso-
line-electric hybrids, depending on the models involved and whatever rap-
idly developing automotive technology achieves.
CON: Although diesel fuel used to be cheaper than gasoline, it now often
costs the same amount or more. Diesel fuel is also used for commercial
trucks, home and industrial generators, and heating oil, so as demand for
diesel passenger vehicles grows, the price of diesel fuel is likely to continue
to rise because of competition from those other users.
BUT: Even if the price goes up, diesel fuel would have to be 25 to 30 percent
more expensive than gas to erase the cost advantage of a diesel engine’s
greater fuel efficiency.
PRO: Diesel fuel is one of the most efficient and energy dense fuels available
today. Because it contains more usable energy than gasoline, it delivers
better fuel economy.
CON: Although diesel fuel is considered more efficient because it converts
heat into energy rather than sending the heat out the tailpipe as gas-powered
vehicles do, it doesn’t result in flashy high-speed performance. In some ways,
a gasoline-powered engine is like a racehorse — high-strung, fiery, and fast —
whereas a diesel engine is more like a workhorse — slower, stronger, and more
enduring.
BUT: Because of the way it burns fuel, a diesel engine provides far more
torque to the driveshaft than does a gasoline engine. As a result, most
modern diesel passenger cars are much faster from a standing start than
their gas-powered counterparts. Diesels with manual transmissions usually
don’t have to be downshifted to easily pass other vehicles on the highway,
and although they don’t reach the highest speeds of gasoline-powered cars,
many diesels still can cruise quite handily at 100 miles per hour or more (pro-
viding you can find a place to do that legally!). What’s more, diesel-powered
trucks, SUVs, and cars also can out-tow gas-powered vehicles while still deliv-
ering that improved fuel economy.
PRO: Diesels have no spark plugs or distributors. Therefore, they never
need ignition tune-ups.
CON: Diesels still need regular maintenance to keep them running. You have
to change the oil and the air, oil, and fuel filters. Cleaner diesel fuels no
longer require you to bleed excess water out of the system, but many vehi-
cles still have water separators that need to be emptied manually.
163
Chapter 9: Diesels For Dummies

PRO: Diesel engines are built more ruggedly to withstand the rigors of higher
compression. Consequently, they usually go much longer than gas-powered
vehicles before they require major repairs. Mercedes-Benz holds the longevity
record with several vehicles clocking more than 900,000 miles on their original
engines! You may not want to hang onto the same vehicle for 900,000 miles,
but longevity and dependability like that can sure help with trade-in and
resale values.
CON: If you neglect the maintenance and the fuel injection system breaks
down, you may have to pay a diesel mechanic more money to get things
unsnaggled than you would to repair a gasoline system because diesel
engines are more technologically advanced.
BUT: All types of vehicles need maintenance, and the increasing complexity
of both traditional and alternative vehicles may require repair by specialized
technicians that work at higher rates than the mechanics at your neighbor-
hood garage.
Diesel technology is constantly being improved. Government pressure to pro-
duce low-emission diesel engines for passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, and
farm and construction equipment has resulted not only in low-sulfur diesel
fuels but also specialized catalytic converters, advanced filters, and other
devices to cut down or destroy toxic emissions. There are also dual-fuel
engines that run on natural gas but can switch to diesel if the gas supply runs
out. To reduce dependency on dwindling supplies of petroleum, biodiesel
fuels derived from agricultural and commercial sources are being developed.
The section “Diesel fuel” later in this chapter tells you more about them.
What Makes It Go?
The basic difference between a diesel engine and a gasoline engine is that in a
diesel engine, the fuel isn’t ignited by an outside power source like a spark
plug. Instead, the fuel is sprayed into the combustion chambers through
fuel injector nozzles just when the air in each chamber has been placed
under such great pressure that it’s hot enough to ignite the fuel sponta-
neously. (You can find more-detailed information about this process in the
later section “The diesel four-stroke power cycle.”)
Most conventional gasoline engines have compression ratios of around 8:1,
which means that the volume of each cylinder is eight times larger when the
piston is at the bottom of the cylinder than when the piston is at the top of the
cylinder. Diesel engines may employ compression ratios of above 20:1. Because
of this volume, and because the compressed air can reach very high tempera-
tures, diesel engines must be built for greater strength and endurance.
164
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

Following is a step-by-step view of what happens when you start up a diesel-
powered vehicle. In the later section “The diesel four-stroke power cycle,”
you take a closer look at each step of the power cycle that converts all this
into power to drive the vehicle.
The following details may vary from one vehicle to another, but the action
remains pretty much the same. (You may find it fun to compare this descrip-
tion with the short overview of how internal combustion engines work in
Chapter 4.)
1. When you first turn the key in the ignition, you’re asked to wait until the
engine builds up enough heat in the cylinders for satisfactory starting.
(Most vehicles have a little light that says “Wait,” but a sultry computer
voice may do the same job on some vehicles.) Turning the key begins a
process in which fuel is injected into the cylinders under such high pres-
sure that it heats the air in the cylinders all by itself. The time it takes to
warm things up has been dramatically reduced — probably no more
than 1.5 seconds in moderate weather.
Diesel fuel is less volatile than
gasoline and is easier to start if
the combustion chamber is pre-
heated, so manufacturers origi-
nally installed little glow plugs
that worked off the battery to
pre-warm the air in the cylin-
ders when you first started the
engine. Better fuel management
techniques and higher injection
pressures now create enough
heat to touch off the fuel with-
out glow plugs, but the plugs
are still in there for emissions
control: The extra heat they
provide helps burn the fuel
more efficiently. Figure 9-2 shows a glow plug in a precombustion cham-
ber, which allows the glow plug to heat a smaller amount of air more
quickly and efficiently. Some vehicles still have these chambers, others
don’t, but the results are still the same.
2. When everything is warm enough, a “Start” light goes on. When you see
it, you step on the accelerator and turn the ignition key to “Start.”
3. Fuel pumps deliver the fuel from the fuel tank to the engine. On its
way, the fuel passes through a couple of fuel filters (see Figure 9-3) that
clean it before it can get to the fuel injector nozzles (see Figure 9-4).
Proper filter maintenance is especially important in diesels because fuel
contamination can clog up the tiny holes in the injector nozzles.

4. In the most common type of modern diesel fuel system, called common
rail direct injection (CDI) and shown in Figure 9-5, the fuel injection pump
pressurizes fuel into a delivery tube called a rail and keeps it there under
constant high pressure of 23,500 pounds per square inch (psi) or even
higher while it delivers the fuel to each cylinder at the proper time.
(Gasoline fuel injection pressure may be just 10 to 50 psi!) The fuel injec-
tors feed the fuel as a fine spray into the combustion chambers of the
cylinders through nozzles controlled by the engine’s engine control unit
(ECU), which determines the pressure, when the fuel spray occurs, how
long it lasts, and other functions. 
Other diesel fuel systems use hydraulics, crystalline wafers, and other
methods to control fuel injection, and more are being developed to pro-
duce diesel engines that are even more powerful and responsive.
5. At this point, the action moves to the cylinders, where the fuel, air, and
“fire” meet. While the preceding steps get the fuel where it needs to go,
another process runs simultaneously to get the air where it needs to be
for the final, fiery power play.

On conventional diesels, the air comes in through an air cleaner that’s
quite similar to those in gas-powered vehicles. However, modern tur-
bochargers can ram greater volumes of air into the cylinders and may
provide greater power and fuel economy under optimum conditions. 
A turbocharger can increase the power on a diesel vehicle by 50 percent
while lowering its fuel consumption by 20 to 25 percent!
6. Combustion spreads from the smaller amount of fuel that’s placed under
pressure in the precombustion chamber to the fuel and air in the com-
bustion chamber itself.
Figure 9-5: A common rail fuel injection system.
The Fuel System
The fuel system in a diesel engine performs the same functions as it does in
gas-powered engines and consists of many of the same parts. After the fuel
gets to the cylinders, however, there’s a difference in the four-stroke power
cycle that converts it into the power to drive the vehicle. The next section
provides a closer look at that cycle.

Chapter 9: Diesels For Dummies

The diesel four-stroke 
power cycle
Although some smaller diesel engines (on motor-
cycles and marine engines, for instance) operate
with two-stroke power cycles, most automotive
diesel engines use a four-stroke power cycle,
which is similar to, but not the same as, the power
cycle of a gasoline engine (see Chapter 7). Here’s
how the diesel’s four-stroke power cycle works:
 Stroke 1: Intake stroke (see Figure 9-6). The
piston descends, the intake valve opens,
and air is drawn into the cylinder.
 Stroke 2: Compression stroke (see 
Figure 9-7). The intake and exhaust valves
are closed as the piston moves upward and
places the air under extreme pressure. As the
pressure increases, the air heats up to the
flash point (the point at which it causes the
fuel to undergo spontaneous combustion).
Just before the flash point is reached, fuel
injectors spray fuel into the combustion
chambers at the precise instant when igni-
tion is to take place.
 Stroke 3: Power stroke (see Figure 9-8).
With the intake valve and the exhaust valve
closed, the fuel ignites, and combustion
forces the piston down. This driving power is
transmitted through the transmission and
the rest of the drive train to the wheels,
causing the vehicle to move.
 Stroke 4: Exhaust stroke (see Figure 9-9).
The exhaust valve opens as the piston rises
and pushes the burned gases out of the 
cylinder.
Diesel fuel
Diesel engines run on diesel fuel, which is more
efficient than gasoline because it contains 10 per-
cent more energy per gallon than gasoline. It’s also
safer than gasoline because its vapors don’t
explode or ignite as easily as gasoline vapors.

When the exhaust from conventional diesel fuel was found to cause cancer,
clean diesel engines were developed. Although thousands of conventional
diesel fuel-burning vehicles are still on the road, public pressure and environ-
mental organizations have prodded individual states and the federal govern-
ment to enact legislation and fund replacement programs to take them out of
use as quickly as possible.
Standard diesel fuel
Much stricter diesel fuel standards have had a huge impact on cleaning up
diesel exhaust. By 2007, the sulfur content of diesel fuels was restricted to 
15 ppm (parts per million) compared to the dirty diesel previously in use that
averaged something like 550 ppm. This ULSD (ultra low sulfur diesel) is
derived by extra refining of the same high-sulfur petroleum diesel oil as
before, but biodiesel fuels derived from agricultural and waste products are
becoming more popular in North America. I cover biodiesel fuel in the next
section.
Standard diesel fuel (sometimes called diesel oil) comes in two grades: Diesel
#1 (or 1-D) and Diesel #2 (or 2-D). Just as gasoline is rated by its octane,
diesel fuel is rated by its cetane, which indicates how easy it is to ignite and
how fast it burns. The higher the cetane number, the more volatile the fuel.
Most diesel vehicles use fuel with a rating of 40 to 55. You won’t have to
worry about which type to use because all diesel automakers specify Diesel
#2 for normal driving conditions. Truckers use Diesel #2 to carry heavy loads
for long distances at sustained speeds because it’s less volatile than Diesel #1
and provides greater fuel economy.
Don’t confuse diesel fuel grade ratings with API (American Petroleum Institute)
categories for oils used to lubricate diesel engines. The later section “Changing
the lubricating oil” contains a guide to these API categories and more informa-
tion about them.
Diesel fuel also is measured by its viscosity, which has to do with its thick-
ness and ability to flow. Like any oil, diesel fuel gets thicker and cloudier at
lower temperatures. Under extreme conditions, it can become a gel and
refuse to flow at all. Diesel #1 flows more easily than Diesel #2, so it’s more
efficient at lower temperatures. The two types of oil can be blended, and
most service stations offer diesel fuel blended for local weather conditions.
If you plan to drive in very cold weather, choose diesel fuel rated at least 10
degrees lower than the coldest temperatures you expect to encounter.
Consult your owner’s manual for specifics.
Because emissions from conventional diesel fuel have been found to be
extremely toxic to humans and other living things, until safer forms of this
fuel are developed, be careful not to inhale the fumes while pumping it into
your fuel tank. (The same goes for gasoline!)
169
Chapter 9: Diesels For Dummies

The diesel fuel sold at truck stops is often cheaper than at service stations,
and the fuel is fresher, too. Freshness is important because diesel fuel can
easily become contaminated by the water vapor that condenses in fuel tanks,
and although it’s rarely found in North America these days, really dirty fuel
can contain fungus and other microbes that can clog filters and fuel injectors.
If you find yourself at a station that arouses your suspicions, look for slimy
stuff on the nozzle of the fuel pump. Try to fill up at a truck stop on a
Saturday morning, when commercial trucking action is light. Weekday
evenings are the worst times to buy because muscling a small vehicle into a
crowd of big rigs isn’t easy!
Biodiesel fuel
Biodiesel fuels derived from agricultural materials have the potential to pro-
vide a clean-burning alternative to dwindling sources of petroleum.
Rudolph Diesel’s first engine was designed to run on peanut oil, and Henry
Ford envisioned plant-based fuel as the primary fuel for transportation and
partnered with Standard Oil to develop biofuel production and distribution.
However, as this book goes to press, the only type of biodiesel fuel that can be
used in vehicles in the United States and Canada without violating manufac-
turer’s warranties is B5, a blend of 5 percent biodiesel and 95 percent regular
diesel. Most diesel engines run just fine on blends of up to 30 percent biodiesel.
For higher blends, the engine control unit’s (ECU) electronic fuel “mapping”
system, which regulates timing, fuel/air mixture, and so on, has to be
reprogrammed to perform efficiently. The reason is that, although there’s no
mechanical difference between a diesel engine that runs on diesel oil and a
biodiesel-burning engine, biodiesel has slightly different energy and burning
characteristics than regular petroleum-based diesel.
Biodiesel vehicles in the U.S. have been modified by do-it-yourselfers and
specialty shops so that they can use higher biodiesel blends and fuels made
from a variety of substances. It’s possible to make biodiesel from most any
crop-based oil, and the news is filled with stories about modified vehicles
that run on biodiesel made from french-fry oil and other restaurant grease,
fresh-pressed cottonseed oil, you name it. But some of these oils contain
compounds that can eat through gaskets and may be prone to going rancid if
stored too long. Also, because biodiesel is a better solvent than standard
diesel fuel, it can remove deposits in the fuel lines. That sounds like a good
thing, but those deposits may foul up fuel filters and fuel injectors as they
move through the fuel system. As a result, federal standards for the chemical
composition of biodiesel fuel must be in place before it’s available in wide-
spread use and before automakers will permit its use under warranty in any-
thing but very diluted amounts. This should happen very soon.
170
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

The Electrical System
Diesels require more stored energy for starting than gasoline vehicles do,
especially on cold days. Instead of just using the battery to enable the
starter to crank the engine, a diesel must have sufficient power to enable the
glow plugs to warm the combustion chambers and then must build up
enough heat and compression in the cylinders to ignite the fuel. For this
reason, diesels must possess considerably more battery capacity than con-
ventional vehicles. Some diesels come equipped with two batteries; others
feature a single oversized battery that may be more than 50 percent bigger
than one found on a conventional vehicle. You can find instructions for jump-
starting diesel batteries in the section “Caring for Your Diesel” later in this
chapter.
Aside from this battery issue, electrical systems on diesels are pretty much
the same as those on conventional vehicles; alternators, solenoids, and
starters perform their usual functions. For information about these compo-
nents, turn to Chapter 5.
The Emissions System
Along with much cleaner fuel, automakers are transforming the old, toxic
diesels into vehicles with clean exhaust emissions by making dramatic
changes to their emissions control systems. As of 2007, all diesels sold in
the U.S. were clean diesels, and they’ll continue to get cleaner each year as
new technologies for exhaust cleansing are developed. California has led the
171
Chapter 9: Diesels For Dummies
Emergency substitutes
Theoretically, diesel engines should be able to
run on kerosene, certain airplane fuels,
biodiesel in all blends between 5 percent and
100 percent, and home heating oil, but the key
word here is “theoretically.” Do not use these
oils in your vehicle except in absolute emergen-
cies. Standards of refining, filtering, and blend-
ing these oils differ widely, and they can ruin
your engine, void your warranties, and create a
whole lot of trouble for you.
If you find yourself low on fuel in a remote area,
look for trucking companies, food-processing
plants, electric plants, hospitals, and farms.
These places usually have diesel engines on the
premises, and some good Samaritan may take
pity on you and let you have some.
If you absolutely can’t find a source of diesel
fuel, as a last resort borrow some home heating
oil or buy some Jet-A fuel at a local airport.
Diesel mechanics consider these substitutes to
be like rotgut whiskey — it will get you there,
but it’s not the best stuff for your system! Drive
on these fuels only long enough to get to the
nearest source of proper fuel.

way in this area of change, and each year more and more states adopt its
standards, which are stricter than those set by the federal government.
Hopefully, the federal government will raise its standards as high as
California’s (or higher!) as time goes on.
The first innovations in cleaner diesel emissions systems were the additions
of the following components (you can see them in Figure 9-1):
 A diesel oxide catalytic converter that cleans hydrocarbons from the
exhaust stream
 A diesel particulate filter (see Figure 9-10) that scrubs sooty particles
from the exhaust, trapping them in the filter material and regularly hit-
ting the filter with a burst of superheated gasses to burn up the particles
Figure 9-10: A diesel particulate filter.
A number of automakers have introduced additional emissions traps to their
diesel passenger vehicles and light trucks. Here are two systems:
 One system injects a mist of urea (a type of ammonia) that’s nontoxic,
odorless, and biodegradable into the exhaust stream, where it bonds to
toxic NOx emissions (nitrogen oxides) and breaks them down to nitro-
gen and water. Then the exhaust flow carries the residue into a selective
Particulate
filter
172
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

reduction catalyst (SRC) where it’s burned away. The urea container must
be refilled regularly, usually with each scheduled mechanical checkup.
 The other system uses a new type of plasma catalyst to superheat and
convert the NOx emissions into ammonia and then into harmless nitro-
gen gas.
Caring for Your Diesel
Regular maintenance is absolutely imperative if you want a diesel engine to
last, and every diesel owner will probably encounter some pitfalls and prob-
lems. This section helps you deal with maintenance and repair issues —
whether or not you choose to do the work yourself.
Although diesel engines require no ignition tune-ups and tend to last longer
without major repairs than gasoline engines, they do require regular low-cost
maintenance, mostly in the form of frequent oil and filter changes. The urea
injection systems that reduce NOx emissions (see the previous section) 
also need refilling, which is usually done as part of regularly scheduled 
maintenance.
If you own a conventional gas-powered vehicle and you get sloppy about main-
tenance and don’t change the oil often enough, you’ll probably end up with an
engine that has aged prematurely. If you own a diesel and do the same thing,
you may end up with an engine that’s prematurely dead. The same goes for
changing filters: A dirty fuel filter can impair a conventional vehicle’s perform-
ance, but dirty fuel can clog a diesel’s fuel injection system, and you may need
expensive professional help to get back on the road again.
As a rule, you shouldn’t try to clean or adjust a diesel’s fuel injectors yourself,
but if you maintain your vehicle according to the directions in the owner’s
manual, they can last 100,000 miles or more. After all, truckers have always
preferred diesels because they find them to be tough, reliable, and cheap to
run and maintain.
Most diesels are designed so that the owner can perform regular mainte-
nance chores without an undue investment of time and money. The following
sections cover these tasks in general terms; your owner’s manual should
contain the rest of the information you need.
If your owner’s manual doesn’t advise you on a specific maintenance task, or
if you have no manual, amble on over to your dealership’s parts department
and ask to see a copy of the service manual for your vehicle (some book-
stores and public libraries may also have them). A quick look at the proper
sections should tell you whether you can do the job yourself. If you’re not
sure, ask one of the service advisors at your dealership to show you where
173
Chapter 9: Diesels For Dummies

the oil, air, and fuel filters are located and what’s involved in changing or
servicing them. Most service facilities are pretty nice about that kind of thing.
If the job really is easy, they don’t make enough on it to make lying to you
worth the loss in customer goodwill; if the job isn’t so easy, they figure you’ll
be happy to have them do it for you.
Changing the lubricating oil
Because diesel fuel is sometimes called diesel oil, be aware that the oil you
have to change is not the fuel oil but the oil that lubricates the engine. This job
requires lubricating oil that’s specially designed for diesel engines — not gaso-
line engines. After you understand that distinction, the actual work involved is
the same as it is for conventional vehicles except that you have to do the task
more often on a diesel.
Be sure to check your oil dipstick at least once a week (following the instruc-
tions in Chapter 2), and change the oil filter every time you change the oil
(see Chapter 13 for instructions). Don’t be surprised if you change the lubri-
cating oil in your diesel, run the engine for two minutes, and check the dip-
stick only to find that the new oil has turned pitch black; this is normal and
not a reason to change the oil again immediately.
Your owner’s manual tells you the maximum interval you can wait between
changes, but I believe that the more often you change the oil on any vehicle,
the longer the vehicle will live and the healthier it will be. That goes double
for diesels because extreme heat and pressure help to contaminate the lubri-
cating oil more quickly. The cost of having a professional change the oil on a
diesel engine can be from two to four times greater than on a gas engine. This
may be extra motivation for doing this relatively simple job yourself.
Because the procedure is the same, all the
instructions for changing oil and oil filters in
Chapter 13 are relevant for diesels except for the
oil classification codes. (The classification codes
for automotive oils tell you which oil to use
under a specific set of conditions.) Figure 9-11
shows what the API classification code symbol
looks like on containers of diesel oil from reliable
manufacturers.
As new and improved oils appear on the
market, these codes have changed from the
original CA to CB to CC, and so on. Each new
level can replace previous ones, and the earli-
est oils are considered obsolete. Unless your
vehicle is several years old, your owner’s manual will list the proper API cate-
gory oil to use. The manual also specifies a viscosity grade in the form of a

number preceded by the initials “SAE.” This grade refers to the “weight” of
the oil and the temperature conditions under which it will flow. Diesel lubri-
cating oil comes in the same range of weights as oil for conventional vehicles,
and you can find additional information on that in Chapter 13.

out the most recent API classification codes at your dealership or auto parts
store, or go to the American Petroleum Institute (API) Web site at new.api.
org/certifications/engineoil/categories and click on Engine Oil
Guide.
Changing the air filter
The air filter setup on most diesels is the same as on gasoline-powered vehi-
cles, with the filter located inside the cold air collector box located under
the hood. You can find directions for reaching the air filter in Chapter 8.
You have to take one big precaution when you change the air filter on a
diesel: Always shut off the engine first. Diesel engines produce exceedingly
powerful suction, and the air intake goes directly to the engine. Because
almost anything can fly or drop into it — from nuts and bolts to your favorite
hairpiece — you risk serious damage to the engine if you open the cold air
collector box with the engine running.
Changing the fuel filters
Most diesels have two fuel filters: a “primary” filter located between the fuel
tank and the engine, which cleans the fuel before it gets to the fuel transfer
pump; and a “secondary” filter up near the engine, which gives the fuel a
final cleaning before it gets to the fuel injectors. Both are usually easy to
change, and your owner’s manual should show you how to do this job. On
some diesels, the job is much like changing the oil filter on a conventional
vehicle: You unscrew the old one, moisten the gasket of the new one with
fuel, and screw it into place. Others have filters with replaceable cartridges;
you just remove the old one and pop in the new one. There’s one catch to
changing the fuel filter, however, and the next section has the details.
Bleeding and priming the fuel system
When you change the fuel filter or run out of fuel in a diesel vehicle, you must
bleed the air bubbles out of the fuel system and then prime it to get a new
supply of fuel circulating. Cranking the engine does the job but also wears
down the battery, so most diesels include a manual primer pump and an air-
bleed screw for the purpose of bleeding the system and priming it. On many
175
Chapter 9: Diesels For Dummies

vehicles, you simply pump the primer’s handle to get the fuel moving, and
then you turn the air-bleed screw until a hissing noise tells you that the air is
escaping. Just keep pumping until all the air leaves and the noise ceases; then
tighten the air-bleed screw and replace the pump handle.
Because bleeding and priming the fuel system is something that you may
need to do fairly often, I suggest that you check the equipment and proce-
dure for any model you’re interested in purchasing to be sure that you can 
do this job quickly and easily.
Draining water separators
Diesel fuel can easily become contaminated by water because diesel fuel
absorbs water more than gasoline does. For this reason, many diesel vehicles
feature a gadget called a water separator that collects water from the fuel.
It’s usually located on or near the fuel filter. If your vehicle doesn’t have one,
I strongly suggest that you have one installed. The part shouldn’t be terribly
expensive, and it can save you a bunch of money on repairs.
Although a few water separators are self-cleaning, most need to be manually
drained: You just turn a little drain valve called a petcock and empty the
water from the collection chamber of the separator.
It’s a good idea to check the water separator weekly at first to see how fast it
fills up under normal conditions when you’re driving on fuel from your usual
source. If the fuel contains a lot of water, you may want to consider buying it
elsewhere.
Jump-starting diesel batteries
Even though diesel-powered vehicles can have dual batteries or one oversized
battery (refer to the earlier section, “The Electrical System”), it’s possible to
jump-start a diesel from the battery on a conventional gasoline-powered 
vehicle.
To avoid confusion, in this section I call the vehicle with the dead battery the
disabled vehicle and the one you’re jumping the start from the source vehicle.
Follow these steps to jump-start a dead diesel battery:
1. Make sure that both vehicles are in Park or Neutral with the parking
brakes on.
2. Turn on the heater on the disabled diesel vehicle to protect the elec-
trical system from surges in voltage.
176
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

3. Make sure that the lights and other electrical accessories on the dis-
abled diesel vehicle are off.
4. A vehicle with dual batteries usually has thicker cables on one of the
batteries. If either vehicle has dual batteries, always attach the jumper
cables to the battery with thicker cables.
If either vehicle has dual batteries with cables of the same thickness, use
either battery for the jump. If a vehicle has only one battery, just be sure
to hook the cables up in the proper order.
5. Connect the clamp on one of the jumper cables to the positive termi-
nal of the disabled vehicle’s battery.
The positive terminal should have a (+) or a red cover on it.
6. Connect the other end of the same jumper cable to the positive termi-
nal of the source vehicle.
7. Connect one end of the other jumper cable to the negative terminal (-)
of the source vehicle.
8. Here’s the tricky part: Connect the other end of that jumper cable to
an unpainted, metallic part of the disabled vehicle.
I often use the bracket that keeps the hood up, but any such part will do
as long as it’s not near the battery, belts, or any other moving parts of
the engine.
9. Start the engine on the source vehicle.
10. Start the engine on the disabled vehicle, and let both engines run for
a minute or two, more if the battery has been dead for a long time.
11. Turn off the engine of the source vehicle. (Leave the disabled
vehicle’s engine running.)
12. Remove the cable from the unpainted metal part of the disabled
vehicle.
13. Disconnect the cable from the positive terminals of both vehicles.
14. Disconnect the cable from the negative terminal of the source vehicle.
15. The disabled vehicle should be driven around for at least 15 minutes
to ensure that the battery is fully charged.
If you jump-start a dead diesel vehicle and the battery dies the next time you
try to start the car, you probably need a new battery. Be sure to get the
proper one for your vehicle’s make, model, and year.

Chapter 9: Diesels For Dummies

Getting Started on a Frosty Morning
Diesel drivers everywhere are thankful that diesels have become easier to
start in cold weather. Most turn over within 1.5 seconds of turning on the
ignition.
Metal cylinder walls become very cold when the temperature drops, so most
vehicles are harder to start in cold weather. Because diesel engines require
much higher temperatures to fire the fuel, they’ve always been harder to
start in cold weather than gasoline-powered vehicles. To warm things up
before the engine can run, a variety of heaters have been developed that
keep various parts of the vehicle warm and snuggly even when it isn’t being
driven. Some of these gadgets may be on the vehicle when you buy it; others
you can buy and install later on if the need for them arises.
If you’re planning to buy a diesel, be sure to ask which heating devices are
included in the purchase price. If you live in a cold climate or do much travel-
ing, consider having several devices available for extreme weather condi-
tions. The following sections describe some of your options.
Block heaters
Many diesels come equipped with built-in electric-powered block heaters to
keep the engine block warm overnight. You just park the vehicle, plug the
heater cord into a heavy-duty three-pronged extension cord, and then plug
the extension cord into a 110-volt electrical socket that can handle a three-
pronged plug. When shopping, don’t skimp on the length of the extension
cord — it can be 50 feet to a socket from a motel parking lot! I’ve been told
that in Alaska, where a block heater is vital, electrical outlets are built right
into some parking meters. I doubt that anyone tries to beat those meters,
especially at –40°F!
If your vehicle doesn’t have a block heater, you can buy one and have it
installed. Various types are available, but immersion-type heaters are the
most popular.
When buying a heater, consult the charts at an auto parts store or dealership
to match the wattage of the heater to the size of your engine and the range of
weather you expect to encounter. When plugged in, a high-wattage heater will
run up your electric bills unnecessarily if you have a small engine or don’t
expect the temperature to go below zero very often.
178
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

Battery warmers
If your diesel doesn’t start in cold weather and you remembered to plug in
the block heater, your battery may be the culprit. Batteries can lose 35 per-
cent of their power at 32°F and as much as 60 percent at 0°F. Because the bat-
tery has to supply the glow plugs with sufficient juice to get things warmed
up (refer to the earlier section, “What Makes It Go?”), a frostbitten battery
isn’t of much use on an icy morning.
This problem has two remedies: You can buy a battery with greater capacity
(providing that there’s room for one under the hood), or you can buy a bat-
tery warmer. The two most popular models, both of which simply plug into a
nearby 110-volt socket, are
 The “hot plate” warmer, which simply slides under the battery like a
cookie sheet and warms its little toesies.
 The “electric blanket” warmer, which wraps around the battery and
uses more current than the hot plate version to deal with really frigid 
situations.
Oil warmers
You can buy a heated dipstick to heat the oil in the engine crankcase (you
just trade it for your normal dipstick and plug it into an electrical outlet) and 
a host of other gadgets to warm the coolant in the engine and the fuel in the
fuel lines. (Most people don’t need all this stuff, but for my readers in Alaska,
Canada, and other cold climates, I want to cover the subject thoroughly.)
Here’s a handy hint that may work in a pinch: On a day when your block
heater isn’t able to combat the cold effectively, if you have an electric hair
dryer and a long enough extension cord to get it to the vehicle, try turning
the dryer on and putting the nozzle into the car’s air inlet duct. The warm
air should help your engine warm up faster.
What not to do on a frosty morning
Never use engine-starting fluids to start your engine — no matter how eager
you are to get underway. The ether in these fluids can ignite at such low 
temperatures that you risk a fire or an explosion, either of which can mean
severe damage to both yourself and your precious diesel. Although the con-
tainers carry instructions, measuring the “safe” proportions required is just
too hard. If you feel that you must use this stuff, I suggest that you have a
starting-fluid injection kit installed instead; it’s safe and effective. Just stay
away from those spray cans!

Chapter 9: Diesels For Dummies

Finding a Reliable Diesel Mechanic
If you need professional diesel maintenance or repair and your vehicle is out
of warranty, you may want to check around for a good independent diesel
mechanic so that you can compare prices with those of the dealership or get
a second opinion on major surgery. One way to find a good independent
diesel mechanic is to look in your local yellow pages under “Automobiles,
Repair” (or something similar) for a shop whose ad carries the logo of the
Association of Diesel Specialists (ADS). The ADS authorization goes to repair
facilities that send their mechanics to factory schools for instruction, main-
tain standards of cleanliness, and meet requirements for stocking the tools
and parts to deal properly with a variety of diesel systems. (Chapter 22 is
devoted to finding and maintaining a good relationship with a mechanic; it
also tells you how to get satisfaction on complaints about labor or services.)

I
n recent years, environmental concerns about the impact of automotive
exhaust on air quality, health, and global warming — plus the fact that
the rapidly diminishing world supply of fossil fuels has contributed to inter-
national conflicts and radically raised the price of fossil fuels — have moti-
vated hundreds of thousands of drivers to replace gas-guzzling vehicles with
more efficient ones. United States federal and state clean-air laws, rising fuel-
economy standards, and growing public and auto-industry awareness have
greatly accelerated the development of an ever wider variety of vehicles that
run on alternative fuels. Although alternatively fueled vehicles may require
different kinds of fuel tanks, regenerative brakes, and modified fuel injec-
tion and emissions control systems, the brakes, cooling, steering, suspen-
sion, lubrication, and safety systems are pretty standard on most of them.
This chapter covers alternative fuels and vehicles that will eventually sup-
plant traditional gasoline-powered internal combustion engines (ICE).
However, it will be a while before ICEs are relegated to museums and classic
car collections; improvements, particularly in emissions control systems,
have made them cleaner and more efficient. The need for greater fuel effi-
ciency has led to the development of ICEs that can shut down half their cylin-
ders when power demand is light and then resume running on all cylinders
when you need to “step on it.” Engineers also are constantly working on fine-
tuning ICEs to boost fuel efficiency and reduce emissions and low rolling
resistance tires have improved fuel economy as well. 

Consult your owner’s manual for maintenance instructions, but don’t try to
repair specialized systems yourself. They should be repaired by profession-
als with the experience and tools to deal with their components and the high
voltages that may be involved. Although, at this writing, some alternatively
fueled vehicles in this chapter are still in development, they’re expected to
be available within the next couple of years and may already be available by
the time you read this book. Welcome to the new millennium!
Ethanol
Alcohol fuels have been around for years, typically mixed with gasoline in a
blend also known as gasohol. E10, with a ratio of 10 percent gasoline to 90 per-
cent ethanol, can be used in any ICE, and many oil companies already blend
their fuels that way. Methanol, mostly used in race cars, isn’t popular for other
vehicles because it isn’t as clean and it also relies on fossil fuels. The use of
these fuels in higher proportions requires modification to the fuel storage and
delivery systems on cars and trucks. E85, a mixture of 85 percent ethanol to
15 percent gasoline, can be used in flex-fuel vehicles, and car enthusiasts
have modified their vehicles to run on ethanol or methanol alone, with mixed
results. One point that’s commonly overlooked is that alcohol is about half as
energy-dense as gasoline, so you can only go half as far on a tank. 
Because ethanol is biodegradable, nontoxic, and dissolves in water, E85 has
been praised by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as producing emissions
that contain less carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide than emissions from
vehicles that run on gasoline or diesel oil. As the supply of gasoline dimin-
ishes, the current E85 standards that require the mix to contain 15 percent
gasoline are being challenged to allow a greater proportion of ethanol. 
The major controversy concerning ethanol fuel concerns the sources used to
produce it. Corn-based ethanol has disastrous effects on the price and avail-
ability of corn for food and other products. It also doesn’t produce as much
energy as gasoline and requires fossil-fuels to grow, refine, and deliver it.
Happily, cellulosic ethanol does not have those drawbacks. Because it is
derived from the cellulose found in non-food agricultural and waste products
such as switch grass — a fast-growing plant that has a high yield of energy
and requires little in the way of fertilization and other high-energy production
costs — old newspapers, and other substances, it can compete with gasoline
for fuel efficiency and not affect the price and supply of grains and other veg-
etation vital to humans and livestock.
Although vehicles can run on pure alcohol, the addition of gasoline is usually
justified because it helps with ignition in cold weather, and if the fuel catches
fire, it burns with a visible, colored flame. 
182
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

You can find out more about ethanol and whether your vehicle can run on
E85 at www.e85fuel.com. To find E85 in your area, go to the “How to find
alternative fuels” sidebar.
Flex-fuel Vehicles
Vehicles that can run on two or more types of fuel are called flex-fuel vehi-
cles (FFVs). (They’re also known as dual-fuel or multi-fuel vehicles.) The most
popular FFVs can run on either gasoline or ethanol or a mixture of the two. 
At least one major carmaker has a test fleet of vehicles that burn liquid
hydrogen but can switch to gasoline if there’s no hydrogen to be found. Many
people drive FFVs and don’t even know it! If you’d like to know whether your
vehicle is an FFV, check your owner’s manual, look for a sticker inside the
little door you open to add fuel, call your dealership, or go to www.fuel
economy.gov, which has a list of available flex-fuel vehicles.
Hybrids
Hybrid vehicles are called hybrids because they utilize both a small internal
combustion engine (ICE) and an electric motor to obtain maximum power
and fuel economy with minimum emissions. How they do this varies from one
model to another, with varying success. What all hybrids have in common is
the ability to generate electric current, store it in a large battery, and use
that current to help drive the car. This is usually done in two ways: Hybrids
can capture electrical energy produced by a regenerative braking system

making these fuels available in thousands of
service stations nationwide is a slow process.

ing a variety of alternative fuels in your area
as well as the ones with the lowest price

(described later in this chapter), and their engines can power a generator, too.
Hybrids can also conserve energy by shutting down the ICE when the vehicle is
in Park, idling at a light, or stopped in traffic; or when the electric motor’s
energy is sufficient to drive the vehicle without assistance from the ICE.
Parallel hybrids
A parallel hybrid (see Figure 10-1) uses both an electric motor and an internal
combustion engine (ICE) for propulsion. They can run in tandem, or one can
be used as the primary power source with the other kicking in to assist when
extra power is needed for starting off, climbing hills, and accelerating to pass
other vehicles. Because both are connected to the drive train, they’re said
to run “in parallel.” 
The Toyota Prius uses a power split device that connects the ICE, the electric
motor and the continuously variable transmission (CVT) (see Chapter 18). 
It allows the engine and the motor to operate together or separately, and
enables either one to generate power for storage or immediate use. It’s basi-
cally a parallel hybrid, but because of this unique feature, Toyota refers to it
as a “series/parallel hybrid.”
I drive a Prius (named Esmerelda) so here’s as an example of how this type of
parallel hybrid works:
1. When you press the ignition button, the electric motor uses energy
stored in the high-voltage battery to start the car. (A 12-volt battery
under the hood supplies power for lights, radio, and so on, as in conven-
tional vehicles.)
2. Whenever the high-voltage battery needs charging, the ICE starts up to
generate electricity for it, and once the vehicle is moving faster than
around 15 mph, the ICE kicks in to provide additional power for acceler-
ating, driving at high speeds, and going up hills.
3. When you step on the brakes, the regenerative braking system gener-
ates electricity to power the vehicle or be stored in the high-voltage 
battery.
4. When the vehicle stops, the ICE shuts off automatically so you don’t
waste fuel. Even though you’re sitting there in a silent car, the radio, air
conditioner, windshield wipers, and other electric features continue to
work uninterrupted!

Figure 10-1: How a parallel hybrid works.
Series hybrids
A series hybrid (see Figure 10-2) uses a gasoline or diesel ICE, coupled with a
generator, to generate electricity but not to drive the car. The engine can send
the electric current directly to the electric motor or charge a large battery
that stores the electricity and delivers it to an electric motor on-demand. The
electric motor propels the vehicle, using its power to rotate a driveshaft or a
set of drive axles that turn the wheels.

Plug-in hybrids
Because plug-in hybrids (see Figure 10-3) feature larger batteries that can be
charged at any ordinary 110-volt electrical socket, they have the capacity to
extend the ability of the electric motor to drive the car farther without the
need for starting the ICE and therefore substantially increase the vehicle’s
fuel efficiency. Estimates have ranged as high as 100 mpg!
Some technologically savvy individuals have adapted their hybrid vehicles
into plug-in hybrids, and automakers are in the process of developing and
producing them (sometimes in cooperation with major utility companies).
The development of new, smaller, high-capacity lithium-ion batteries that can
be recharged many times is the key to making plug-in hybrids available to the
general public. Estimates are that plug-in hybrids equipped with these more
powerful batteries will have a range of as much as 125 miles before the
charge is depleted and the vehicle reverts to standard hybrid mode. 
Figure 10-3: A plug-in hybrid.
The main environmental problem with plug-in hybrids is that the electric cur-
rent they draw is usually generated by utility companies powered by fossil
fuels. The good news is that some major chains have committed to establish-
ing charging stations powered by solar panels or wind energy, and many
hybrid owners are willing to install solar panels to recharge these vehicles at
home. Plug-in hybrids charged by commercial sources of electricity or solar
panels will be less dependent on the ICE, but will still need it for long trips,
climbing hills, and so on. Future hybrids may use a small fuel cell to make
electricity from hydrogen, which would mean the ICE would have to run even
less frequently. There’s more about plug-ins and fuel cells later in this chapter.

Although instructions are available for converting conventional hybrids into
plug-in hybrids, doing so yourself will void your car’s warranty. 
Two-mode hybrids
Two-mode hybrids (see Figure 10-4) may be the key to a competitive place for
the U.S. in the hybrid market. Instead of the large storage battery found on con-
ventional hybrids, two-mode hybrids use smaller batteries and two electric
motors located inside an automatic transmission with two sets of gears —
one for the ICE and the other to amplify the power of the electric motors. The
transmission can function as a continuously variable transmission (CVT), as
well. In one mode, at lower speeds, the vehicle can run with one or both elec-
tric motors, with or without the ICE, or on the ICE alone. At higher speeds, the
second mode kicks in, and the ICE runs continuously in its higher gear ratios.
Figure 10-4: A two-mode hybrid.
Regenerative brakes
Hybrids and other energy-efficient vehicles have regenerative braking sys-
tems that generate electric power to help keep the batteries charged. When
the driver applies the brakes, the electric motor turns into a generator, and
the magnetic drag slows the vehicle down. For safety, however, there is also a
normal hydraulic braking system that can stop the car when regenerative
braking isn’t sufficient. There’s no difference in maintenance or repair except
that the brake pads tend to last much longer because they don’t get used as

much. In fact, if you drive a hybrid in a moderate manner, you almost never
actually use the disc brakes on the wheels and may be able to go the life of
the car without changing pads. (Chapter 14 tells you about brakes.) The big
difference is that regenerative brakes capture energy and turn it into electric-
ity to charge the battery that provides power to an electric motor.
Electric Vehicles (EV)
Many people picture electric vehicles (EVs) as glorified golf carts powered
by 12-volt batteries, with limited range and speed. They assume the vehicles
are great for local driving but can’t contend with traffic on busy streets or
highways. However, as larger and more powerful EVs with a wider range
appear, this image is no longer accurate.
Modern EVs accelerate more powerfully, have competitive top speeds, seat 
at least five passengers, and can be recharged easily by their owners. They
can haul big loads and climb steep hills with relative ease. As with plug-in
hybrids, storage-battery technology has been slow to achieve the break-
through needed to let EVs store enough energy to give them the extended
range to compete with vehicles powered by conventional engines and to
recharge fast enough to compete with just driving into a filling station. Major
efforts are being made to improve storage batteries and cold-weather perfor-
mance. EVs powered by fuel cells have the potential to overcome these
drawbacks. EVs are already popular in Europe, and EVs with enhanced per-
formance are featured in car shows throughout the U.S. 
Electric vehicles utilize a powerful electric motor and a large capacity battery
to store the energy and deliver it to the motor on-demand (see in Figure 10-5).
They also have the same 12-volt battery as other vehicles to keep electric
devices working when the motor that drives the vehicle isn’t in use.
Otherwise, EVs have the same steering, suspension, and other gizmos as con-
ventional vehicles and use the same regenerative braking system to gener-
ate electric current when the brakes are applied. Because EVs don’t have a
conventional fuel system, a dashboard display tells you when the vehicle is
generating, storing, or using electricity and how far you can go without
recharging the battery.
Except for a small fan that may kick in for a short time when you start the car,
EVs are silent when you start, drive, and come to a stop. How hard you step
on the accelerator tells a computerized controller how fast you want to go.
The controller can shut down the motor to prevent it from operating at too
high a speed and deliver just the right amount of energy to the motor. The
more power the motor receives, the faster it can turn the drive axle that
transmits the power to the wheels. The power is transmitted to the drive axle
directly because an electric motor delivers full torque at all times, so a trans-
mission isn’t necessary. Despite this different configuration, you drive an EV
in the same way as you do a conventional vehicle.
188
Part II: Powering Up with Air, Fuel, and Fire 

Recharging the battery on an electric car is usually cheaper per mile than
buying gasoline, and because it’s a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) it doesn’t
pollute the air as vehicles that run on fossil fuels do. However, plugging into
power from public utilities generated from fossil fuels presents the same
problems as with plug-in hybrids. Happily, the positive developments for
remedying this apply to EVs as well. Fuel cells (see the next section) may be
the deciding factor in whether EVs become the “greenest” way to go.

Tragic history of the EV
Although electric vehicles (EVs) were popular
in the early 1900s, they were eclipsed by 
petroleum-powered cars. The first popular EV
was the EV-1. General Motors produced and
leased about 1,200 from 1997 to 1999. In 2004,
when the last lease expired, although there was
a waiting list of about 35,000, GM said that EVs
weren’t popular enough to continue production.
Over the protests of the lessees, who were 
willing to buy them, GM recalled the EV-1 and
destroyed most of them. For undisclosed rea-
sons, the Smithsonian even took their EV-1 off
display a few years later! The documentary film
Who Killed the Electric Car? delves into this
controversial story. The demand for zero-emis-
sions vehicles (ZEVs) has now renewed inter-
est in a new generation (pardon the pun) of
affordable electric vehicles.

Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Vehicles
Although hydrogen is the element found in the greatest quantities in the uni-
verse, it doesn’t exist in a purely natural state on earth as fossil fuels do. It is
attractive as a fuel because, by a process called electrolysis, it can theoreti-
cally be derived from water, the air, and many other substances. Of course,
until ways can be found to fill a vehicle’s tank with water and have it produce
its own hydrogen, there’s still the problem of the fossil-fuel energy necessary
to produce hydrogen in large quantities and deliver it to a vehicle as a liquid
or gas. And because hydrogen is highly flammable and very cold in its liquid
form (minus 453°F!), there are safety concerns about shipping it, pumping it
into a vehicle’s fuel tank, and storing it there under extreme pressure. 
How fuel cells work
A fuel cell creates electrical current from hydrogen and oxygen and may well
be the best use of hydrogen as an alternative to fossil-fueled vehicles. When
used in a hydrogen-powered EV called a fuel cell vehicle (FCV), virtually the
only tailpipe emissions that hydrogen produces are water molecules. Although
there are many types of fuel cells, the ones using a polymer exchange mem-
brane are the most popular for vehicles because they produce more power and
operate at lower temperatures, which enables them to warm up faster than
other, hotter, types of fuel cells. The resulting current is fed directly to the vehi-
cle’s electric motor.
As you can see in Figure 10-6, a fuel cell has a positive anode and a negative
cathode. Hydrogen gas enters the cell and is sent to the anode, while oxygen
in the form of air flows to the cathode. A thin plate of platinum particles
serves as a catalyst to split each atom of hydrogen into positive and negative
ions. The polymer electrolyte membrane lets the positive ions go through it 
to the anode. The negative ions can’t get through and have to take another
route to the cathode — on the way they create electrical current to drive the
electric motor of the vehicle (represented as a light bulb in Figure 10-6).
When the positive and negative hydrogen ions are reunited at the cathode,
they combine with the oxygen from the air into H2O and leave the cell as
water vapor. On vehicles, hundreds of individual fuel cells are linked together
into fuel cell stacks to increase the electrical output. Whether or not they
become widely available depends on whether cheaper and more efficient
alternative vehicles eliminate the need for them.

Figure 10-6: How a fuel cell works.
Natural Gas Vehicles (NGV)
Natural gas vehicles (NGV) use compressed natural gas (CNG) rather
than liquid natural gas (LNG) such as butane and propane. Because CNG
burns cleanly with few emissions, NGVs are popular outside the United
States. NGVs haven’t been as popular in the U.S. because natural gas isn’t as
available as gasoline at filling stations, although it is a common fuel for shut-
tles, buses, and fleets that must meet government clean-air requirements. 
The biggest differences between gasoline vehicles and NGVs are as follows
(see Figure 10-7): Because CNG is compressed, it requires fuel tanks that can
withstand such pressure. (The fuel is measured in units called gasoline-gallon
equivalents, or GGE.) Fuel lines on NGVs also have to be high-pressure lines,
and the fuel injection delivery system has to be specially made for CNG. But
after the gas is mixed with air and injected into the engine’s combustion
chamber, the engine works the same as a gasoline ICE. A significant differ-
ence occurs at the tailpipe, however. CNG produces far fewer pollutants than
either gasoline or diesel, which means that most NGVs meet low- to ultra-low-
emission standards.
You can find stations that sell CNG in your area at gasprices.mapquest.

efficiently, too. This part tells you how the cooling system

W
ith all that air, fuel, and fire stuff going on in its engine, your vehicle
needs something to help it keep a cool (cylinder) head! Because water
is usually cheap, plentiful, and readily available, auto manufacturers have
found it to be the simplest answer to the problem. A few have found that air
is even cheaper and more abundant; they designed the air-cooled engines on
the old Volkswagens, but aside from some VW bugs and air-cooled Porsches
that are still on the road, there are few air-cooled vehicles available in the
United States these days.
Of course, nothing is as simple as it seems. Automakers have added some
gizmos to keep the water in the engine from boiling too easily: a water
pump, fan, radiator, thermostat, and coolant. There’s also a transmission
cooler to keep the transmission from overheating and an air-conditioner to
keep you from overheating. Together they comprise your vehicle’s cooling
system (see Figure 11-1).
The cooling system is highly efficient. It usually requires almost no work to
keep it operating — just a watchful eye for leaks and an occasional check or
change of coolant. Of course, some vehicles have more complicated systems
or variations on the theme, but in general, if you understand the way the
basic cooling system works, you should have little trouble dealing with the
one in your vehicle. Whether you do the work yourself or have it done profes-
sionally, keeping the cooling system in good shape will go a long way toward
“keeping your cool” when things heat up on the road.

Figure 11-1: The cooling system.
This chapter explores the cooling system part by part. Chapter 12 shows you
what to do if your vehicle overheats and how to maintain and troubleshoot
the cooling system and make easy repairs. Chapter 21 helps you get out of
trouble if your car overheats on the road.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Coolant/Antifreeze
To keep the water in the cooling system from boiling or freezing, the water is
mixed with coolant or antifreeze. In the interest of brevity, I just call it
“coolant” throughout this book.
Most coolants contain about 95 percent ethylene glycol, a chemical that stops
water from freezing or boiling even in extreme temperatures. (Ethylene glycol
is toxic; there are nontoxic coolants that contain propylene glycol instead. See
Chapter 12 for more.) In addition to the glycol, coolant also contains rust,
corrosion, and foaming inhibitors, so coolant does more than just keep the
water in the system in a liquid state: It also helps to prevent the formation of
rust on the metal surfaces of the engine and the radiator, lubricates the water
pump, and keeps the liquid from foaming as it circulates through the system.
Since the early 1960s, auto manufacturers have designed the cooling systems
of most vehicles for a 50/50 mixture of ethylene glycol and water, which is

still generally considered the proper proportion of coolant to water for the
cooling systems of most vehicles. (I often refer to the coolant and water mix-
ture as “liquid” in this chapter.)
Today’s engines require specially formulated coolants that are safe for alu-
minum components. There are long-life (sometimes called “extended life”)
coolants with organic acid rust and corrosion inhibitors that promise to last
for as long as five years. Automakers use some of these coolants as original
fluid in new vehicle radiators made of aluminum (they can’t be used in any-
thing except aluminum radiators).
Due to differences in Japanese, Korean, European, and American compounds,
you can shorten coolant life by putting the wrong stuff in your vehicle’s cooling
system. So make sure that you use the automaker’s recommended coolant to
ensure the longest life and best protection for your vehicle.
If your cooling system is operating properly, you shouldn’t have to keep
adding liquid to it. Chapter 2 shows you how to check the level and condition
of the liquid in the cooling system, and Chapter 12 shows you how to add
liquid or flush the system and replace the liquid in it.
The Radiator
When the fuel/air mixture is ignited in the cylinders, the temperature inside
the engine can reach thousands of degrees Fahrenheit. It takes only half that
heat to melt iron, and your engine would be a useless lump of metal in about
20 minutes if your vehicle couldn’t keep things cool. Naturally, the coolant
(and water) that circulates from the radiator through the top radiator hose to
the thermostat and around the cylinders in the engine block gets very hot,
so it’s continually circulated back to the radiator via the bottom radiator hose,
where it cools off before heading back to the scene of the action. The radiator’s
pressure cap keeps your car from boiling over, and the coolant recovery
system holds extra coolant so it doesn’t overflow onto the roadway.
The hoses
The radiator is designed to cool the liquid quickly by passing it over a large
cooling surface. The liquid enters the radiator through the top radiator hose,
which is usually connected to (you guessed it) the top of the radiator (refer
to Figure 11-1). As the liquid descends, it runs through channels in the radia-
tor that are cooled by air rushing in through cooling fins between the chan-
nels. When the liquid has cooled, it leaves the radiator through the bottom
radiator hose (surprise!). This hose usually has a spring inside it to prevent 
197
Chapter 11: The Cooling System Up Close

it from collapsing when the water pump draws coolant from the radiator. 
(If it collapses anyway, Chapter 12 has instructions for replacing it.)
Smaller-diameter hoses also lead from your engine to the heater core (see
the later section, “The Heater Core”). Some vehicles have a small bypass
hose near the thermostat as well (see the later section, “The Thermostat”).
These hoses are an important part of the cooling system because they’re
designed to carry the liquid in it from one component to another.
The coolant recovery system
A coolant recovery system is a plastic or metal container with two little
hoses coming out of the cap (see Figure 11-2). One hose leads to the radiator,
and the other serves as an overflow pipe for the container, which holds an
extra supply of water and coolant in case the system loses any.
When your cooling system heats up and starts to overflow, the liquid pours
back into the recovery system reservoir instead of pouring out of the radia-
tor overflow pipe and onto the ground. When the system cools off, the pres-
sure drops and the liquid is drawn out of the reservoir and back into the
radiator. This process not only saves you coolant but also protects animals
and children from sampling puddles of the toxic stuff.
Some of today’s new vehicles have
pressurized reservoirs. In these
cases, you may find the pressure
cap (which I get into in the next sec-
tion) on the reservoir and not on the
radiator. I’ve been told by radiator
specialists that, on some vehicles,
this system doesn’t work very effi-
ciently because, as the pressure
builds up in the coolant reservoir, it
forces the coolant out of the over-
flow pipe and onto the street. Not
only is this overflow a toxic hazard,
but as the coolant supply dimin-
ishes, the chance of the engine over-
heating increases, leading to a
vicious circle. 
Many recovery systems are considered “sealed” because you add water and
coolant by opening the cap on the reservoir rather than on the radiator. You
also check the level of liquid in the system by seeing whether it reaches the
“Max” level shown on the side of the container rather than by opening the
radiator and looking inside. (For instructions on adding liquid to a sealed
system safely, see Chapter 12.)
198
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 
Figure 11-2: A coolant recovery system.

The pressure cap
To further retard the boiling point of the liquid in the cooling system, the
entire system is placed under pressure. This pressure generally runs between
7 and 16 pounds per square inch (psi). As the pressure increases, the boiling
point rises as well. This combination of pressure plus coolant gives the liquid
in your cooling system the capability to resist boiling at temperatures that
can rise as high as 250°F or more in some vehicles.
To keep the lid on the pressure in the system and to provide a convenient
place to add water and coolant, each radiator has a removable radiator
pressure cap located on either its radiator fill hole or its coolant recovery
system.
The pressure cap has two valves: a pressure valve that maintains a precise
amount of pressure on the liquid in the system, and a vacuum valve that
allows the liquid to travel back into the radiator from the recovery reservoir.
Pressure caps are relatively inexpensive, but if you have a cap that isn’t work-
ing properly, or if you have the wrong type of cap, you’ll be amazed at the
amount of trouble it can cause. For example, if the gasket inside the cap isn’t
working, the pressure in the system will escape, allowing the liquid to boil at a
lower temperature. A modern cooling system that has been designed to oper-
ate normally at temperatures over 212°F, and that is filled with liquid and in
perfect condition, will still continually boil over if the radiator cap isn’t operat-
ing efficiently. That boiling liquid will be forced into the overflow system, and
your vehicle’s engine will overheat. An overheated engine can cause an incon-
venient highway breakdown and possible danger to your engine.
If your vehicle overheats on the highway, Chapter 21 can get you cooled
down safely. Chapter 12 offers remedies for other overheating problems.
The Fan
Air rushing through the radiator cools things off when you’re driving merrily
down the highway, but a fresh supply of air doesn’t move through the radia-
tor fins when the vehicle is standing still or crawling its way through heavy
traffic. For this purpose, the fan is positioned so that it cools the liquid in the
radiator (refer to Figure 11-1). Today, most fans have a plastic shroud that
funnels air through the radiator. Some vehicles have air dams that help force
the air up through the radiator from below.
Originally, the fan operated in connection with the water pump, and they
were both driven by a single fan belt that ran around a pulley connected to
the alternator. This fan belt drove the fan as long as the engine was running.
Almost all fans today are electric and thermostat-controlled, not hooked by
199
Chapter 11: The Cooling System Up Close

belts to the engine or water pump. These fans only come on when they need
to. Because the air rushing past them allows these fans to simply “coast” at
high speeds, the engine doesn’t have to work as hard or burn as much fuel to
supply the power that the fans would normally consume.
Some vehicles now have two fans because styling changes that have lowered
the profile of the hood area have caused radiators to get lower and longer,
meaning that a single fan doesn’t cover the entire surface. These two fans are
sometimes run by electric thermostats that aren’t connected to the water
pump at all (I cover the water pump in the next section).
The Water Pump
The water pump (see Figures 11-1 and
11-3) draws the cooled liquid from the
radiator through the bottom radiator hose
and sends it to the engine, where it circu-
lates through water jackets located
around the combustion chambers in the
cylinders and other hot spots. Then the
liquid returns to the radiator to cool off
again. An accessory belt connected to the
crankshaft drives some water pumps,
while some overhead cam engines drive
the water pump with the timing belt.
Chapter 2 tells you how to check acces-
sory belts, and Chapter 12 has instruc-
tions for adjusting and replacing them.
If the timing belt drives your water pump,
the water pump will be difficult to see
unless you remove the plastic timing belt 
cover.
The Thermostat
The thermostat is the only part of the cooling system that does not cool
things off. Instead, it helps the liquid in the cooling system warm up the
engine quickly.
200
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 
Figure 11-3: A water pump.

The thermostat is a small,
metal, heat-sensitive valve (see
Figure 11-4) that’s usually
located where the upper radia-
tor hose meets the top of the
engine. (On a few vehicles, you
find the thermostat where the
bottom hose joins the engine.
Your owner’s manual should
tell you where yours is.) When
it senses hot liquid, the thermo-
stat allows the liquid to pass
through. But when the thermo-
stat senses that the liquid is
cold (like when you first start
your engine in the morning), it closes and doesn’t allow the liquid to circulate
through the radiator. As a result, the liquid stays in the engine, where it gets
hot as the engine warms up, and in turn, the increasing heat of the liquid
helps the engine to warm up more quickly. As a result, the vehicle runs more
efficiently and burns less fuel.
The Heater Core
The heater core is located inside the vehicle between the instrument panel
and the firewall (refer to Figure 11-1). It looks like a miniature radiator minus
the fill neck and cap. The purpose of the heater core is to provide heat for the
passenger compartment. The same liquid that the water pump circulates
throughout the engine also circulates through the heater core when the
engine is operating. When you get chilly, you can direct air across the heater
core and heat the interior of your vehicle by turning on the inside fan.
Because the heater core is relatively passive, it usually doesn’t need atten-
tion unless it breaks.
The Transmission Cooler
Vehicles with automatic transmissions have a transmission cooler located 
in or near the bottom or side of the radiator (refer to Figure 11-1). The trans-
mission fluid circulates from the hot transmission to the cooler, which cools
it and returns it to the transmission. If the transmission cooler on your vehi-
cle is working properly, you don’t need to monkey with it. If it leaks, have it
repaired by a professional.

Air Conditioning
Air conditioning is now standard equipment on most vehicles rather than an
option. It uses refrigerant to remove the heat from the air (rather than cooling
it) and a blower to send the cool air into the passenger compartment.
Until 1992, a refrigerant called CFC-12 (commonly called Freon) was standard
on most vehicles. When it was found to contribute to the depletion of the
ozone layer, CFC-12 was phased out and replaced by R-134a. Production of
CFC-12 ceased at the end of 1995, and although the stuff can be recycled, 
supplies may be limited. The biggest improvements since the development 
of R-134a are better, less-porous hoses and seals so that the smaller R-134a
molecules don’t leak out like they used to. A new CO2 refrigerant system that
has been in the prototype stage since around 2002 may be the next major
development in vehicle air conditioning systems.
If your vehicle was built before 1992, you may have trouble getting Freon if
you need to replace the refrigerant in your vehicle’s air conditioner.
Conversions to an alternative refrigerant (R-134a) are expensive, so think
about this fact before buying a pre-1992 used vehicle or undertaking expen-
sive repairs on an older vehicle that you already own; the vehicle may not be
worth as much as it would cost to rebuild the air conditioning system.
Chapter 12 tells you how to troubleshoot problems with your air conditioner
and provides tips on servicing it and finding out what it would cost to con-
vert from CFC-12 to R-134a refrigerant.

E
very vehicle has a cooling system to help it run efficiently and prevent it
from overheating. Keeping it operating properly usually requires just an
occasional check or change of coolant and a watchful eye for leaks. (Chapter
11 takes a close look at the parts of the cooling system; please review it
before undertaking any of the work in this chapter.)
This chapter discusses the things you can do to help your vehicle keep its
cool under normal circumstances. It tells you how to prevent overheating by
checking and replacing the liquid in the system, how to flush the system and
change the coolant, and how to deal with other common causes of overheat-
ing, such as a malfunctioning pressure cap or thermostat, deteriorated
hoses, and coolant leaks.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Overcoming Overheating
The first sign of overheating is either when the needle on the temperature
gauge pushes its way into the ominous red zone or the “Check Engine” or
“Temperature” malfunction indicator light on the dashboard casts a sinis-
ter glow. Left alone, the liquid in the radiator eventually boils over and
steam rolls out from under the hood.

If you ignore the problem, your vehicle eventually loses power, your engine
grinds to a halt, and you end up with a giant repair bill. If you take action at
the first indication of a problem, you probably can avoid this doomsday sce-
nario. Even if you end up needing major repairs, at least you’ll know that you
explored all the cheaper options first.
Addressing occasional overheating
Although overheating isn’t the problem it once was — there was a time when
most every vehicle overheated occasionally — it can still happen. Often the
cause of the problem is nothing more than being stuck in stop-and-go traffic
on a hot day. If your car overheats, Chapter 21 tells you what to do.
Dealing with a chronic hothead
If your vehicle overheats often and constantly loses coolant, the problem
may be caused by one or more leaks in your cooling system (see the sections
“Finding Leaks in the Cooling System” and “Repairing Leaks in the Cooling
System” later in this chapter). If your vehicle overheats in normal weather
and traffic, you may need to add liquid to the system, replace the thermo-
stat, adjust or replace the accessory belt, or check the water pump. You
may be able to deal with most of these problems by following the instruc-
tions in later sections of this chapter.
The first thing to check if your vehicle overheats often is the pressure cap.
Sometimes the gasket on the cap deteriorates and lets pressure escape,
which causes the cooling system to malfunction. Most service stations can
test your cap for you and tell you whether it’s in good condition.
When I bought Tweety Bird, my first car, she sang when I shut off the engine!
Her mysterious behavior was eliminated by a new pressure cap. Although I
paid for some unnecessary (and unsuccessful) repairs before it occurred to me
to ask the shop to test the cap, I was luckier than someone I met who paid big
bucks for radiator rebuilding and a new water pump before discovering that all
he needed was a cap that cost less than $10! Lesson learned: Professionals
sometimes try the more profitable solutions first. Do-it-yourselfers try the
cheapest solution first.
If your vehicle is old and the cooling system isn’t leaking, be sure the shop
just pressure tests the cap. Pressure testing the entire system can sometimes
cause leaks by blowing out any stuff that’s plugging them up! The section
“Locating leaks by pressure-testing the cooling system” later in this chapter
tells you more about this process.
204
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

Identifying other causes of overheating
Some overheating problems aren’t related to the cooling system at all. Other
circumstances that can cause a vehicle to overheat include lack of oil, a
blown head gasket, and transmission problems. If the cooling system
seems to be in good order after you check it and do the maintenance work
covered in this chapter, investigate these possibilities:
 Late timing: If your ignition system is malfunctioning, late timing may be
causing your vehicle to overheat because the spark plugs are firing the
fuel/air mixture after the piston moves back down from the top of its
stroke. When the spark plugs fire too late to allow all the fuel to burn prop-
erly, more heat burdens your cooling system. Late timing alone doesn’t
cause an engine to overheat by more than a few degrees, but when coupled
with other problems, it can bring the engine temperature to a critical point.
The remedy is simple: Have a service facility place your vehicle on an elec-
tronic diagnostic machine to check your timing and adjust it if necessary.
 Plugged radiator: Some radiators get so plugged up with rust, sediment,
or small insects that even cleaning and flushing them doesn’t get all the
junk out. Because plugged passages cut down on the system’s liquid cir-
culation, the system can’t cool efficiently. The remedy is to have a radia-
tor specialist remove and inspect the radiator. If you’re lucky, just
steam-cleaning the radiator does the job; if you’re not, the solution may
be more expensive. Keep your fingers crossed. . . .
 Slipping accessory belt: On many modern vehicles, the accessory belt is
hidden by a plastic shield or dust cover that may be difficult to remove.
However, if you can see and reach the accessory belt that drives the water
pump, check to be sure that there’s no more than about 1⁄2 inch of give. If
the belt is looser than that, it may not be driving the pump properly, and
that can impair circulation and overheat the cooling system. If the belt
seems loose or very frayed, you can try to replace it by following the
instructions in the section “Adjusting and Replacing Accessory Belts” later
in this chapter. If you can’t do the job, have a professional deal with it.
 Collapsing bottom radiator hose: Occasionally, a bottom radiator hose
begins to collapse under the vacuum that the water pump creates, and
the impaired circulation causes overheating. The section “Check the
hoses” later in this chapter tells you how to determine whether the hose
is collapsing.
 Low oil level: If you still can’t find the cause of overheating, check your
oil dipstick. A vehicle that’s low on oil tends to overheat because the oil
removes from 75 to 80 percent of the “waste heat” in your engine (in
addition to doing its other job of cushioning the moving engine parts).
If you’re one quart low in oil and your vehicle holds five quarts, the oil
will carry away 20 percent less heat than it should. See Chapter 2 for
instructions on checking the oil level and adding oil as part of a monthly
under-the-hood check.
205
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Car from Getting Heartburn

Under normal circumstances, you can prevent overheating by checking the
level of liquid in the system and maintaining it properly. The next sections
tell you how to do so.
Checking and Adding Liquid 
to Your Cooling System
One of the quickest, easiest, and least expensive tasks you can perform to
keep your cooling system cool is to check the fluid level in the system and, if
necessary, add water and coolant. Before you attempt to do anything to your
cooling system, be aware of two important safety rules:
NEVER REMOVE THE PRESSURE CAP WHEN THE ENGINE IS HOT.
NEVER ADD COLD WATER TO A HOT ENGINE!
Removing a pressure cap safely
Before you can do anything involving your cooling system, you need to know
how to remove the pressure cap safely. It’s dangerous to remove the pres-
sure cap from the radiator or coolant recovery system reservoir while the
engine is still warm. Because it’s hard to tell just how hot things are inside
the engine, follow these guidelines when removing a pressure cap:
 Keep your cool until your car regains its own! Never remove the cap
from a radiator or coolant recovery system reservoir when the engine is
hot. Because adding cold water to a hot engine can crack the engine
block, you have no reason to remove the cap until the engine tempera-
ture drops to a safe level.
 If your engine overheats on the highway, get safely to the side of the
road, turn off the ignition, and then wait 15 to 20 minutes for things to
cool down. If you can stay safely away from traffic, you can lift the hood
to help the heat escape but you should leave the pressure cap alone.
 If you’re parked where traffic is zooming by, or if you’re concerned about
your security if you leave your vehicle, you’re better off just waiting in
the car until the engine cools. If it heats up again when you start driving,
get to the nearest service station or a place where you can safely park,
get out, and deal with the situation yourself. Chapter 21 has more tips
about what to do if your car overheats on the road.
206
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

To remove the pressure cap safely, follow these steps after the engine is cool:
1. Don’t remove the cap on the radiator unless your vehicle has no plas-
tic coolant recovery reservoir. (These days, almost every vehicle
does; Figure 12-1 shows you what one looks like.)
2. If your system has a safety pressure cap, lift the lever on the safety
cap to allow the pressure to escape.
To keep from burning your hand, place a cloth over the cap after you
raise the lever (see Figure 12-1). Then turn the cap counterclockwise to
remove it.
If your vehicle doesn’t have a safety cap, place a cloth over the cap
and turn it counterclockwise just to its first stop.
Turning to the first stop allows some of the pressure to escape, but if
you see liquid or a great deal of steam escaping, retighten the cap and
wait for things to cool down. If nothing escapes, continue turning the
cap counterclockwise to remove it.
Figure 12-1: A coolant recovery reservoir (a) and a cap being removed safely from a radiator (b).
3. Tilt the cap as you remove it so that the opening points away from
you (and anyone else nearby).
If there’s still enough heat and pressure to spray hot stuff around, it
lands on the engine or inside the hood, where it can do no harm. Be par-
ticularly sure to follow this procedure if you don’t have a safety cap.
4. When you finish, replace the cap by screwing it on clockwise. (If you
have a safety pressure cap, push the lever down again.)

207
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Car from Getting Heartburn

Radiator safety caps cost very little, so if you don’t have one, buy one!
Almost every service station stocks them, but they’re cheaper in auto supply
stores. Check your owner’s manual for the amount of psi (pounds per square
inch) of pressure in your system and look for the proper number of psi on the
new cap. These safety caps are well worth the money.
Of course, if the engine is completely cold, you face no risk at all, so get into
the habit of checking your coolant level at least once a month in the morning
before you warm up the engine, as part of the under-the-hood check in
Chapter 2.
Avoiding disaster when adding liquid 
to any type of cooling system
As you know from Chapter 11, most vehicles have coolant recovery systems.
Some are pressurized and serve as the fill tank when you need to add coolant,
but there are many vehicles still on the road that require you to add liquid
directly to the radiator. The following cautions apply no matter which type 
of vehicle you have.
Never add cold liquid to a hot engine!
Adding cold liquid to an engine that’s hot can crack the engine block
because the hot metal contracts sharply when the cold liquid hits it. If you
must add liquid to an engine that’s still warm (and I can’t imagine why you
should) always do so slowly with the engine running. This way, the cold
liquid joins the stream of hot water that’s circulating through the system
rather than falling all at once into the system when you start the engine
again. This technique isn’t foolproof, however, so I advise patience instead.
Under normal conditions, a 50/50 mix of water and coolant is preferred for
most vehicles. If the day is extremely hot or cold, a higher proportion of
coolant/antifreeze may be necessary (see “Determining whether your coolant
needs changing” later in this chapter).
Don’t overfill the system!
If you overfill the system, the extra liquid gets hot, expands, and flows out of
the overflow pipe. That may not seem too terrible, but because coolant is
toxic, it can harm animals or children, who love its sweet taste (see “Keeping
coolant out of the mouths of babes and small animals” later in this chapter).
If you don’t have coolant on hand and you just need to add a little liquid to
the cooling system, plain old tap water will do. But try to maintain a good
coolant level by adding a similar amount of straight coolant the next time you
add liquid to the system.
208
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

Several types of coolant are on the market. If your vehicle has an aluminum
engine, make sure that the coolant container specifies that it’s safe for alu-
minum engines. If you have extended-life coolant in the system, only add
extended-life coolant to it.
Keep some coolant in your trunk to use in case you’re driving in an area
where you may not be able to find the brand of coolant for your system.
Checking and adding liquid to 
a coolant recovery system
Many vehicles have a pressurized coolant recovery system called an expan-
sion tank that makes opening the radiator unnecessary. These systems are
considered “sealed” because the safety pressure cap is on the recovery reser-
voir rather than on the radiator. On these systems, you can check the level of
liquid on the side of the plastic reservoir, and you just open the cap on the
reservoir to check whether the coolant looks as though it needs changing or
to add water and coolant.
You will probably never need to open the cap on the radiator, but if you have
to open the cap for any reason, make sure to fill the radiator to the top with a
50/50 mixture of coolant and water before replacing the cap. This addition
bleeds the system by forcing any air that may have gotten into the system
into the reservoir and out through its overflow pipe when the engine heats
up. Follow these steps when adding liquid to the coolant recovery system:
1. Check the liquid level.
Look at the outside of the reservoir to see where the level of the liquid in
it lies relative to the “MAX” and “MIN” lines embossed on the side (refer
to Figure 12-1).
2. If the liquid level is low, add equal parts coolant and water to the
reservoir.
Follow the instructions in the earlier section, “Removing a pressure cap
safely,” to remove the pressure cap on the reservoir, and add equal parts
coolant and water until the level reaches the “MAX” line on the side of
the container.
Checking and adding liquid to a radiator
If you don’t have a pressurized coolant recovery system, you have to add
liquid directly to the radiator. Here’s how:
1. Open the radiator cap, following the instructions in the earlier section
“Removing a pressure cap safely.”
209
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Car from Getting Heartburn

2. Take a peek down the radiator fill hole to see how high the liquid
level is inside.
If you’re unsure about what the liquid level should be, just make sure
that it covers the radiator tubes that are visible when you look down the
hole, or that it reaches to within a couple of inches below the cap.
3. Add water and coolant, or pre-diluted coolant, as necessary.
Be sure to follow the tips given in the earlier section “Avoiding disaster
when adding liquid to any type of cooling system.”
4. When you finish, replace the cap by screwing it on clockwise. (If you
have a safety pressure cap, push the lever down again.)
Flushing Your System and 
Changing Your Coolant
You should do three things to keep your cooling system in good shape:
 Check for leaks.
 Replace worn hoses before they split.
 Flush the system and change the coolant at least once a year or every
20,000 miles, whichever comes first, unless your vehicle has the new
extended-life coolant that lasts for five years.
I discuss the leak situation and how to change hoses later in this chapter.
This section covers the proper way to flush your system and change the
coolant in it.
Deciding if you’re up for the job
There are pros and cons to flushing your cooling system and changing your
coolant yourself:
PRO: The difference in cost is tremendous: If you do it yourself, all you need
to buy is a jug of coolant, which sells for less than $10. A professional job can
cost as much as five times more. Remember, not only does your service sta-
tion expect to make a profit on the coolant (they bought it and stocked it,
didn’t they?), but they also charge for labor and coolant recycling.
CON: In the “good old days,” flushing the system and changing the coolant your-
self was easy. You just hooked a garden hose to a little tee in the heater hose,
opened the radiator cap, and let the coolant and water flow through the system
and onto the ground until the system was clean. However, times have changed.
210
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

Coolant is highly toxic, especially to children and small animals, who love its
sweet taste. If a small child, dog, or cat drinks the stuff, it will probably die. 
To protect your children, pets, and the animals in your area, see the section
“Keeping coolant out of the mouths of babes and small animals” later in this
chapter. Because of the need to keep the used coolant out of the environment,
flushing and changing coolant has become more complicated. Service stations
in most states must either meet stringent disposal requirements or purchase a
machine that recycles the coolant by cleaning the coolant as it flows out of the
vehicle, adding a shot of the chemicals that have been depleted by use, and
putting the coolant back into your system. The good news is that this recycled
coolant is every bit as good as the stuff you buy at the auto supply store.
Although a flushing “tee” may be installed in one of the heater hoses on your
vehicle, please don’t try to use it yourself without following the instructions
in “Flushing the system,” later in this chapter, so that you can do the job and
recycle the used coolant safely.
Determining whether your 
coolant needs changing
There are several situations when
the coolant in your vehicle defi-
nitely should be changed: if you
haven’t changed it in a year or in
the past 20,000 miles; if your vehi-
cle constantly loses liquid in the
system and overheats easily; or if
you’ve frequently added plain
water to your cooling system to
the point where it’s probably low-
ered the proportion of coolant to
less than half the required 50/50
mixture.
Even if none of the above is true,
your coolant may still need a
change.
Checking the coolant is espe-
cially important if you haven’t
changed the coolant recently or
if you’ve been adding a lot of
plain water. Coolant testers like
the one shown in Figure 12-2 are
cheap and easy to use; they tell you whether the protection level of 
the coolant in your system is adequate. They usually involve opening 
211
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Car from Getting Heartburn
Figure 12-2: A coolant protection level tester.

the pressure cap and drawing a little liquid out of the system and into the
tester. Little balls or a float in the tester tell you whether you need to add
coolant (the instructions are on the package). (While you’re at it, you also
can check the liquid in the tester for rust.) You can buy test strips that do the
same thing as a tester by changing color.
Here are a couple of things to consider in order to decide whether a change
really is in order:
 The quality of the liquid in the system: Unscrew the pressure cap and
look at the liquid inside the reservoir or radiator, depending on the type
of system you have. Coolant can be green, greenish yellow, orange, red,
or blue, but is the liquid clear, or is stuff floating around in it? Does it
look rusty? (Don’t mistake red coolant for rust; rusty water has particles
floating around in it.)
 How frequently you’ve added water and how much you’ve added: If
you’ve been adding plain water every couple of days or weeks, your
coolant protection level is probably low.
 What kind of climate you live in: If the temperature gets very cold in
the winter or very hot in the summer, be sure that you have enough
coolant/antifreeze in your system before extreme weather sets in. In
most areas, a 50/50 solution is recommended for year-round use. If the
weather turns extremely cold, you can add a slightly higher proportion
of antifreeze without hurting your cooling system.
Never exceed a 70/30 mixture of antifreeze to water. Freeze protection
actually worsens with too much antifreeze and not enough water. If the
weather is extremely hot, exceeding the recommended proportions of
water and coolant won’t help prevent your vehicle from overheating; it
may actually cause it to overheat more rapidly.
 How often you use your car’s air conditioner: Although the air condi-
tioner does a fine job of keeping the interior of the car cool, it raises the
temperature of your engine. So be sure to have a 50/50 mix of coolant to
water during the warm months when you use your air conditioner most
often.
If during a pre-summer check you find that the level of coolant is very
low or that its protection level is weak, it may be a good time to flush
your cooling system and start fresh. If you don’t flush the system then,
check the level again at the end of autumn to see whether you should
flush it before the cold weather sets in.
Figuring out how much coolant you need
You can consult your owner’s manual, the back of the coolant jug, or the
charts that coolant manufacturers supply to find out the number of quarts
that your cooling system holds. Many coolants are now pre-diluted with
212
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

water, but if you’re buying straight coolant, divide that number by two and
buy that amount of coolant. Adding an equal amount of water to straight
coolant gives you a 50/50 water/coolant mixture, which is fine for everything
but extremely cold weather.
Some auto manufacturers make coolant formulated specifically for their vehi-
cles. At least one coolant manufacturer advertises its coolant as being safe
for all vehicles. Whatever you buy, if your vehicle has an aluminum engine,
make sure that the coolant is marked “Safe for use on aluminum engines.” If
you’re adding coolant, always use the same brand and type as the coolant
already in the engine.
Keeping coolant out of the mouths 
of babes and small animals
Before you start to flush your cooling system yourself, it’s really important to
read this section in order to avoid endangering children and animals.
Anyone who has raised kids through the crawling and toddling stages knows
that they tend to pick up the most revolting stuff off the ground and put it
into their mouths. Because coolant looks and tastes good, a puddle of the
stuff can be hazardous to children. That goes double for thirsty cats, dogs,
and wildlife. Most coolant contains ethylene glycol, which is poisonous when
swallowed. According to the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), this
chemical causes depression followed by respiratory and cardiac failure,
kidney damage, and brain damage.
Although no coolant is completely nontoxic, some coolants on the market
contain propylene glycol instead of ethylene glycol to reduce their toxicity. At
least one brand has received the Seal of Approval from the ASPCA (American
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals). However, even if you use
this type of coolant, be sure to take the following steps to protect your pets
and small children from accidentally drinking coolant:
1. Make it a habit to check under your vehicle for coolant leaks.
If you find a puddle of colored liquid below the under-the-hood area and
it isn’t oily, it’s probably coolant.
2. Clean up any spills thoroughly.
Sop up all of it with kitty litter or absorbent rags, and then hose down
the area thoroughly until the surface is clean. (Don’t just hose it without
sopping it up — you’ll just be spreading the stuff around!)
213
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Car from Getting Heartburn

3. Dispose of the contaminated rags or kitty litter safely by placing it in a
plastic bag, sealing it, and putting it in the trash.
4. Store unused coolant safely.
The appropriate jugs have childproof lids, but you should still store
them out of reach and away from heat, which can release toxic fumes.
5. Store used coolant safely until disposal.
Pour used coolant into a container with a screw-on cap, label the con-
tainer as “coolant” or “antifreeze,” and place it well out of the reach of kids
and pets until you can dispose of it, following the instructions in Step 6.
Don’t put used coolant in containers that formerly contained beverages.
They’re too easily mistaken, and the sweet taste of the coolant can com-
pound the error.
6. Dispose of used coolant safely by taking it to a recycling center that
handles toxic waste or a place that specifically recycles used coolant.
To find a place to safely dispose of used coolant, visit the Web site for
Earth 911, www.1800cleanup.org/default.asp, or call your city hall
or your local toxic waste management agency.
Some auto supply stores accept used coolant as a public service. Call
the major stores in your area to find out whether they do so. If not, try a
service station, which can either run the coolant through its recycling
machine or include it in the batch sent out for safe disposal. Be pre-
pared to pay for this service, though, because the service station didn’t
get to flush your cooling system for you.
The EPA has this advice about coolant disposal (they refer to it as
“antifreeze”): “If your home is connected to a sanitary or municipal
sewer system, household quantities of antifreeze can be flushed down
the drain with plenty of water.” However, the EPA warns that antifreeze
can overwhelm the organisms in your septic system and damage the
system, and it suggests that if your wastewater goes into a septic tank,
you should dispose of antifreeze in a sanitary sewer system. The organi-
zation cautions, “Do not pour antifreeze into storm sewer openings, sink-
holes, or abandoned wells.”
If your engine boils over, be sure to clean up the spill wherever you are. Wild
animals are just as vulnerable to being poisoned by coolant as domestic 
pets are.
When you have your priorities in order regarding the safe handling of coolant,
if you’re still up for the job, the next section tells you how to flush a cooling
system.
214
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

Flushing the system
If your vehicle’s owner’s manual has instructions for draining the liquid from
the cooling system, follow them. (This option is better than following the
instructions in this section because air is less likely to be trapped in the
system after you finish the job.)
If you don’t have a manual, or if it lacks such instructions, follow these steps
to flush your cooling system and change the coolant without endangering the
environment:
1. Park the vehicle in a safe place, away from children and small animals.
Make sure that the engine is cold, the ignition is off, and the parking
brake is on.
2. Place a bucket that can hold at least two gallons under the drain valve
at the bottom of the radiator.
3. Open the drain valve and allow the liquid to drain into the bucket.
Don’t allow the liquid to drain onto the ground or into a storm drain or
sewer.
4. Close the drain valve!
5. Pour the used liquid into containers with tight-fitting lids. Label them
clearly as “antifreeze” or “coolant,” and place them away from kids
and pets until you can dispose of them safely.
A funnel and some old gallon water jugs do the job as long as you pour
carefully to avoid spilling the liquid on the ground and label them promi-
nently, as in Step 8.
6. Open the radiator pressure cap and fill the radiator with water.
7. Run the engine with the heater control on High for about ten minutes.
Keep an eye on the temperature gauge to make sure that the engine
doesn’t overheat. If your vehicle has an engine temperature warning
light instead of a gauge, shut off the engine as soon as it lights up.
8. Shut off the engine and allow it to cool down until the water in the
radiator is cool enough to touch. Then drain the water out of the
system into the bucket again, and transfer it from there into more
closed containers for disposal.
Label the containers “toxic water” to differentiate them from the others
and to prevent someone from drinking their contents accidentally.
9. Close the drain plug and refill the system with water and coolant.
215
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Car from Getting Heartburn

If you don’t have pre-diluted coolant, mix sufficient equal parts of water
and coolant to fill your system (see “Figuring out how much coolant you
need” earlier in this chapter). The liquid should reach the “MAX” line 
on the coolant recovery reservoir or cover the fins in the radiator. If it
doesn’t, continue to add equal parts water and coolant until it does.
10. To disperse the water and coolant evenly throughout the system,
replace the pressure cap and run the engine with the heater on High
until the temperature gauge reads in the normal range.
11. Shut off the engine.
12. Clean up any spills, place contaminated rags or kitty litter in sealable
plastic bags and put them into the garbage, and store the unused
coolant safely away from kids and pets.
To clean up spilled coolant and properly dispose of the bottles of used
coolant and toxic water, see the earlier section “Keeping coolant out of
the mouths of babes and small animals.”
13. After you’ve driven your car for a few days, check the liquid level in
the recovery system reservoir again, adding equal parts water and
coolant to the reservoir if the level is low.
If it’s low again in a few more days, have the system checked at a service
facility.
You can buy products for cleaning the cooling system during the flushing
process. These products remove rust and sediment that flushing with plain
water can’t. If your cooling system has been cleaned regularly and you want
to clean it yourself, buy a well-known brand and follow the instructions on
the package carefully.
If your vehicle’s cooling system hasn’t been cleaned for a few years, using a
cleaner on a system that has years of built-up rust and sediment can free so
much of the stuff that you run the risk of clogging your radiator or thermo-
stat or possibly loosening the deposits that have prevented the system from
leaking. Have the system flushed, cleaned, and refilled professionally.
Finding Leaks in the Cooling System
In addition to keeping the water and coolant level where it needs to be, you
can prevent trouble in your cooling system by keeping an eye out for leaks
and replacing old or damaged hoses. Figure 12-3 shows the common trouble
spots in the cooling system — the places where you should check for coolant
leaks.
The following sections give you a few pointers on what types of coolant leaks
to look for, and the section, “Repairing Leaks in the Cooling System,” tells you
what to do if you find them.
216
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

Figure 12-3: Where to check for cooling system leaks and other problems.
Look under your vehicle
Look under your vehicle in the morning to see if there’s any liquid on the
ground below the under-the-hood area. If you see liquid, stick your finger in 
it and smell it. If it’s coolant (green, red, blue, orange, or rust-colored), get a
flashlight, look around under the hood at the parts of the car located over the
puddle, and feel around for wetness. Be sure to check the hoses leading to
the coolant recovery reservoir and the radiator.
If you’re not sure what’s leaking out of your vehicle, turn to Chapter 20 for an
easy way to locate, troubleshoot, and deal with leaks of all types, including
coolant, oil, transmission fluid, and brake fluid.

Check the radiator
Feel the underside of the radiator to see if it’s leaking, and look around your
radiator for whitish deposits or rust-colored stains. These indicate old leaks
that have dried, but they may not be all that old; water tends to evaporate
quickly on a hot radiator. If you find any deposits or stains, the “Radiator
leaks” section later in this chapter tells you what to do. Also check the front
end of the radiator to see whether the surface is befouled with dirt, leaves, and
bugs. If so, wash them off with a brush and a garden hose.
If your radiator catches a lot of debris, to trap the stuff and keep it from get-
ting stuck between the radiator fins you can attach a piece of nylon window
screen over the front surface with twist-ties. You still need to check the screen
periodically to be sure it isn’t blocked, but it makes the stuff easier to remove.
Check the pressure cap
If your vehicle overheats easily, the cheapest remedy is to buy a new safety
cap — or ask a mechanic to pressure-test your cap to see whether it’s func-
tioning properly. If you need a new one, give the salesperson the make,
model, and year of your vehicle and check the pressure limits (psi) on the
new cap against your owner’s manual to make sure that you’re buying the
proper cap for the amount of pressure in your cooling system.
Never let an unfamiliar service station hook you into buying a new cap unless
you watch them pressure-test your old one. You may want to have them test
the new cap as well. I’ve been sold a faulty new cap to replace a faulty old one!
Check the hoses
Regularly check all the hoses under the hood of your vehicle, whether you’ve
been having trouble or not. For instant panic, there’s nothing like having a
hose burst while you’re driving. If it’s a radiator hose, the resulting shower of
steam is frightening at best and dangerous at worst. If a vacuum hose goes,
the sudden loss of vacuum can stop your vehicle in the midst of traffic.
Checking your hoses and replacing the funky ones before they leak can save
your nerves and your pocketbook in the long run.
If you find a hose that’s soft and squishy, bulging, hard or brittle, cracked,
leaking, or marked with a whitish deposit where stuff has leaked and dried,
replace it immediately before it breaks. I show you how to do that in the
“Buying and Replacing Hoses and Hose Clamps” section later in this chapter.
218
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

If you find a hose that’s collapsed when the engine is cold but springs back
when you remove the pressure cap, the cap or coolant recovery system —
not the hose — is at fault.
If your car starts to overheat and you suspect that the bottom radiator hose
is collapsing, park in a safe place away from traffic. Make sure that the car is
in Park or Neutral with the parking brake on. Then open the hood without
shutting off the engine. Take a look at the bottom hose (be careful not to get
your hair or clothing caught in the fan or the accessory belt) and see
whether the hose has collapsed. If it has collapsed and you have a spare hose
with you, replace it (see the later section “Replacing hoses” for instructions).
If a radiator hose malfunctions while you’re driving, no service facility is
going to send a replacement hose out to you, so the vehicle will have to be
towed. If you had a hose replaced because it looked like it was getting worn,
or if you want to hedge your bets on the road, keep the old hoses or, better
yet, new top and bottom radiator hoses in the trunk. Even if you don’t want
to change a hose yourself, you won’t be stuck somewhere waiting for a new
hose to be delivered to a service facility if they don’t have one in stock.
While you’re checking hoses, check the hose clamps that secure all the hoses
under the hood, and tighten any that appear loose. Replace those that are
rusty, corroded, or impossible to remove without special tools with screw-type
hose clamps (see the next section, “Buying and Replacing Hoses and Hose
Clamps”).
Buying and Replacing Hoses 
and Hose Clamps
If you’ve followed the instructions in the “Check the hoses” section and
found one that’s leaking or deteriorated, replacing it is usually pretty easy
and inexpensive, with two caveats:
 Make sure that both ends of the hose are accessible. Some heater
hoses disappear through the firewall and under the dashboard. I’d
much rather pay a mechanic than hang upside down in a cramped space
while I locate and replace one of these hoses.
 Never attempt to replace a hose connected to your air conditioner. Air
conditioners and their hoses contain refrigerant under pressure that can
blind you. If you have any problems with your air conditioner or its
hoses, seek professional help.
219
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Car from Getting Heartburn

If your service facility doesn’t have an air conditioner specialist on staff,
consider going directly to the specialist to avoid paying for the time it
would take your service facility to deliver your vehicle to the specialist
and then pick it up.
Buying the right hose
Before you can replace a hose, you need to visit the parts department at your
dealership or an auto supply store to buy the proper type, diameter, and
length of hose for your vehicle.
If possible, while you’re still in the parking lot wherever you bought it, check
the new hose against your old hose. If the hose doesn’t seem to be the same
size and shape as your old one, take it back in and exchange it. If you can’t
drive your vehicle to the store, remove the hose by following the instructions
in the section “Replacing hoses” and take it with you so that the parts depart-
ment at the store can match it.
If you can’t bring the vehicle or the hose with you, here’s how to find the right
replacement for the vehicle’s make, model, and year without a sample on hand:
 If it’s a top radiator hose: Don’t
get a radiator hose that has wire
inside it. Radiator hoses have to
bend to fit properly between the
radiator and whatever they lead
to. Some hoses are straight
tubes, with wire coiled inside
the rubber casing. These are
called universal hoses; they’re
designed to bend to fit many
cars. Often, the wire breaks or
works its way through the top
covering of the hose, causing
the hose to leak. The kind of
hose to look for is called a pre-
formed hose, shown in Figure 12-4, which is made with the proper bend
already in it and no wire inside the rubber.
The hose should be squeezable — another reason that you don’t want a
top radiator hose with wire inside. This way, if you have problems with
your cooling system, you can squeeze the hose to see whether the
system is operating under pressure.
220
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 
Figure 12-4: A preformed top radiator hose.

A dangerously pressurized hose
that’s hard to squeeze warns
you not to remove the radiator
cap until the car cools down
and the pressure is reduced.
 If it’s a bottom radiator hose:
The hose must have a wire coil
inside it (see Figure 12-5) to
help it keep its shape and with-
stand the vacuum caused by the
water pump drawing water out
of the radiator.
 If it’s any other kind of hose:
Make a photocopy of the
Specifications Record in
Appendix B for each of your
vehicles and enter the following
information on it. Then take it to
the auto supply store whenever
you have to buy hoses and
other parts.
• The make, model, and
year of your vehicle: The
auto supply store may also
need to know the size and
type of your engine and
whether the vehicle has
air-conditioning.
• The type of hose, if you
know it: For example, a
heater hose or vacuum
hose.
• What part(s) the hose 
connects to
• The diameter, color, and
length of the hose: Most
hoses are sold by their
inside diameter (see Fig-
ure 12-6), so you may have to disconnect one end of the hose,
measure the inside diameter, and reconnect it if you’re going to
drive to the store.

and the outside (b) diameters of a hose.

Buying and replacing hose clamps
When buying a new hose, don’t forget to buy new hose clamps. They should
be large enough to fit the outside diameter of the hose.
Clamps are so inexpensive that you should make it a habit to replace them
whenever you change a hose. If you’re changing a hose that was secured with
wire hose clamps or screw-type clamps, replace them with gear-type clamps
that can be removed and replaced easily. Figure 12-7 shows all three types of
clamps. Here’s how to deal with each kind:
 Wire hose clamps: I hate these
clamps because they are relatively
hard to deal with. If you need to
change a hose that has them, use 
a pair of slip-joint pliers (see
Chapter 3) to pinch the wire ends
together so that you can slip them
off the hose, and then replace
them with gear-type clamps.
 Screw-type clamps: These
clamps don’t loosen easily, so
they’re often found on radiator
hoses and the like to keep them
in place. Unscrew the screw and
remove it. Then slip your screw-
driver under the clamp and
loosen it. To avoid the hassle of
reinserting the screw, replace
with gear-type clamps.
 Gear-type clamps: These clamps are my favorites. Just use a screw-
driver to turn the screw counterclockwise to loosen the clamp, slip the
clamp over the hose, slip the end of the new hose in place, and turn the
screw clockwise to tighten the clamp. Easy!
It’s impossible to tell someone in a book how tight or loose a clamp should
be. If the clamp is so tight that it appears to be cutting into the hose, loosen
it. If you can hear or see air or liquid escaping from the ends of the hose, the
clamp should be tighter. Give the hose a tug to see whether it’s secure, and
check it again after you run the engine, to make sure that it isn’t leaking.
222

Figure 12-7: Various types of hose clamps.

Replacing hoses
The basic process of changing a hose is quite simple (see Figure 12-8), but
there are differences, depending on the type of hose you’re replacing.
 If the hose is a vacuum hose, you’ll find literally nothing in it. Just
loosen the clamps, remove the hose, slide the new clamps on the new
hose, slip the ends of the hose over whatever they connect to, and
tighten the clamps.
 If the hose is a fuel hose, have a professional replace it. Fuel is not only
highly flammable, but it’s also toxic. The danger, effort, and time neces-
sary to clean up any spills and to dispose of everything properly at a
hazardous waste center just isn’t worth trying to tackle this relatively
inexpensive job yourself.

Chapter 12: Keeping Your Car from Getting Heartburn

 If the hose contains liquid under pressure, before removing the hose,
be sure that the engine is shut off and the liquid has been allowed to
cool so the pressure is released.
To prevent leaks, some manuals suggest putting a water-resistant
sealant on the ends of the fittings to which the hose connects. Because
these sealants tend to make the hoses difficult to remove when you need
to replace them again, I suggest that you try it without sealant first. In
most cases, if the hose is the right one and the clamps are on tight
enough, you should be able to get by without sealant. If the hose leaks,
you can always go back and use the sealant as recommended.
 If the hose is a radiator or heater hose, to catch the coolant and water
that will run out of the system, you’ll need a bucket or pan that holds at
least two gallons of liquid and will fit under the radiator drain valve
(called the petcock) that drains the radiator.
Never allow coolant to drain onto the ground (see “Keeping coolant out
of the mouths of babes and small animals” earlier in this chapter).
If you haven’t flushed your cooling system and replaced the coolant 
in the past year, do so at the same time you replace the hose. (See 
the “Flushing Your System and Changing Your Coolant” section for
instructions.)
Some newer engines have cooling systems that need to be bled. If your
engine falls in this category, the cooling system contains special bleeder
screws. If you’re not sure what type of system your vehicle has, check
the owner’s manual or ask a mechanic before you undertake this job.
To do it properly, you need to follow instructions in the owner’s manual
or a service manual for your vehicle.
Follow these steps to replace a radiator or heater hose:
1. Make sure that the parking brake is on and that the car is in
Neutral or Park before you start work.
2. Remove the pressure cap from the radiator or coolant reservoir,
and place a bucket or drain pan under the radiator drain valve.
3. Open the drain valve, allow the coolant to drain into the con-
tainer, and then close the valve.
4. Remove the clamps at both ends of the hose.
As I say in “Buying and replacing hose clamps” earlier in this chap-
ter, you’re going to replace those clamps, so if you can’t remove
them easily, cut them off. (If you haven’t read that section, do so
before going any further.)
5. Carefully twist the hose to remove it, and use the container to
catch the liquid that drains from it.
Be gentle when removing the hose. If you’re not careful, you could
damage the radiator.
224
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

6. Use any degreaser or just a damp clean rag to clean the fittings
that the new hose will attach to, and install new clamps over the
hose (refer to Figure 12-8).
7. Install the new hose, attaching and clamping one end securely in
place before you tackle the other end.
Make sure that the hose won’t interfere with any moving parts or
touch the engine when it’s hot, and that the clamps are tight.
8. If the coolant that you drained is fairly new and your container
was clean, pour the liquid back into the system; otherwise, refill
the system with a 50/50 mix of fresh coolant and water.
If you’re replacing the coolant, see “Keeping coolant out of the
mouths of babes and small animals” for instructions on disposing
of the old stuff safely.
9. Start the engine and add more water and coolant as the level in
the radiator drops.
Don’t fill the radiator to the top of the neck or the coolant reser-
voir up to the “MAX” line until the thermostat opens. When the
upper hose is hot, the thermostat has opened. Then it’s okay to
top off the radiator or the reservoir.
10. Replace the pressure cap.
If your engine is the type that needs to be bled, do so now, follow-
ing the instructions in the owner’s manual or service manual for
your vehicle.
11. Run the engine and double-check that the clamps are nice and
tight so that no liquid leaks out.
Repairing Leaks in the Cooling System
When you find a leak, you must decide whether you can handle it yourself or
you need to see a professional. The following sections cover the different
types of leaks and give you a few pointers to help you decide.
Radiator leaks
If the radiator is leaking badly, I recommend going directly to a reliable radia-
tor shop. If they say it’s cheaper to replace it than to repair it, do so.
225
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Car from Getting Heartburn

At the radiator shop, ask the radiator specialists what they intend to do and
request a written estimate before they do the work. If the estimate seems
high, call another radiator shop (use the yellow pages to find one), tell them
what needs to be done, and ask for an estimate.
Leaks in the engine-block core plugs
On the sides of some engine blocks are little circular depressions called core
plugs, or freeze plugs (see Figure 12-9). These plug the holes where sand was
removed when the engine
block was cast. If you see
leaks or rusty streaks lead-
ing away from the core
plugs on your engine block
or signs that leaks from
them have dried, and
you’ve been losing liquid
lately, you may need to
have the core plugs
replaced. Your best bet is
to seek professional help
on this one. If replacing
them is a high-ticket item,
get a second estimate. If
that’s high, too, check the
bluebook value of your
226
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 
Figure 12-9: Core plugs in the sides of the engine block.
A word about sealer
If you find a small leak in your radiator or engine
block (a couple of drops a day, with no need to
add water more frequently than once a week),
you may want to try a sealer, or stop-leak as it’s
sometimes called, before you head for a repair
shop.
You add sealer to the liquid in your cooling
system. It circulates around with the water and
coolant, and when it finds a hole where a leak is
occurring, it plugs it up.
You can purchase several kinds of sealers. The
trick is to choose the one that does the best job
without gumming up the cooling system. Ask for
advice at the dealership or auto supply store. It’s
especially important that the sealer be compat-
ible with your coolant (the label should tell you). 
Sealers are usually added through the radiator
fill hole. Some coolants have a sealer built in,
but these are rarely strong enough to deal with
established leaks. If you try a sealer and the
leaks recur in a couple of days, get professional
help. On the other hand, if the leaks occur in any
of the hoses, replacing the hoses yourself is
quite simple. The section “Buying and Replacing
Hoses and Hose Clamps” earlier in the chapter
tells you how to do it.

vehicle’s make, model, year, and accessories on www.kbb.com or www.
edmunds.com to see whether it’s worth putting the money into it.
Internal leaks
Sometimes a leak right under the cylinder head can be the result of an ill-fit-
ting head gasket or the fact that the bolts that hold the cylinder head on the
engine block (see Figure 12-10) are too loose or too tight. If you try to tighten
these bolts yourself, you may damage the gasket because the bolts have to be
tightened to specifications and you probably don’t have a torque wrench.
The best thing to do is to get professional help here. If a mechanic only has to
tighten the bolts, the cost should be minimal, whereas replacing the head
gasket is more costly.
Figure 12-10: The head gasket lies between the cylinder 
head and the engine block.
You’re always ahead of the game if you go to a professional with a good idea of
what’s wrong and the possible ways to correct the problem. (If you’re told that
the head gasket has to be replaced before the technician has really checked the
head, don’t tell the technician what to do; just ask whether it would be wise to
just try tightening the bolts first instead of replacing the gasket immediately.)
With today’s aluminum cylinder heads, it’s quite possible that your cylinder
head may have small cracks that are allowing coolant to leak internally. If this
is the case, usually you’ll notice thick, white smoke from the tailpipe and/or
Cylinder head

227
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Car from Getting Heartburn

engine oil that looks like a mocha milkshake when you inspect the oil dip-
stick. Also, vehicles with automatic transmissions have a transmission
cooler inside the radiator that can leak. When it leaks, coolant mixes with the
transmission fluid, making the transmission fluid on the dipstick look like a
strawberry milkshake. Both problems require professional help.
Leaky water pump
Often, a water pump that’s about to break down sends out noisy warning sig-
nals and then starts to leak before it fails completely. On some overhead
cam engines, the water pump is behind the timing cover and is driven by the
timing belt, making inspection difficult. Leave those to a professional. If the
water pump on your vehicle is visible, you can check your pump by looking
around it for leaks or signs of rust or corrosion around the seals.
If the pump is leaking in the front where it rotates with the belt, the pump
probably needs to be replaced. If the leak is around the gasket that lies
between the water pump and the engine, you may be able to stop it by tight-
ening the bolts that hold the water pump in place. If tightening the bolts
doesn’t do the job, then you probably need a new pump.
Originally, the water pump operated in connection with the fan and there was
a single fan belt that ran around a pulley connected to the alternator. Almost
all fans today are electric and thermostat-controlled, not hooked to the engine
or water pump. These fans are mounted to the radiator and only come on
when they need to, so they’re not part of the water pump system anymore.
If your water pump needs to be replaced, instead of paying top dollar for a
new one, ask your mechanic about installing a rebuilt or remanufactured
pump (the glossary explains the difference between these two terms) if such
a pump is available for your vehicle and if it’s considerably less expensive
than a new one. Professionals usually prefer to obtain these parts themselves
so that they can make a little profit on the part, but if your mechanic is okay
with you providing the pump, there are a few things to keep in mind: Make
sure that the pump is designed for your vehicle’s make, model, and year;
comes with a gasket that matches the old one; and comes with at least a 
90-day written warranty or guarantee. If the service facility provides the
pump, they should be willing to guarantee it for the same amount of time.
Locating leaks by pressure-testing 
the cooling system
If you can’t locate the source of a leak and your vehicle is losing liquid from the
cooling system on a regular basis, drive to your service station and ask the
attendants to pressure-test your cooling system. The test involves very little
228
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

time or labor, so a friendly technician may do the test free of charge. While
you’re at it, have the technician pressure-test the radiator pressure cap as well.
If you have an old vehicle that hasn’t had its cooling system serviced or
rebuilt in a long time, pressure-testing the system may dislodge the deposits
sealing the weak spots, causing the system to leak. Before the technician
starts testing the system, ask whether the procedure is worth the risk.
Adjusting and Replacing Accessory Belts
Chapter 2 tells you how to check accessory belts. Whether or not you can
adjust or replace a belt yourself depends on the type of belt(s) you have.
On most modern vehicles, a single, long, flat belt called a serpentine multi-
accessory drive belt (see Figure 12-11) drives all the engine accessories. This
belt winds its way around every accessory pulley, and on the way winds
tightly around a “tensioner” pulley that keeps the belt at the correct tension.
In cases where it’s possible to adjust the tensioner, you usually find a set of
marks on the tensioner assembly that indicates the correct tension.
There are very few older vehicles still
on the road that have an accessory
belt that only drives one component. If
your car has this setup, you can check
the belt by following the instructions
in Chapter 2 to see whether it has
more than 1⁄2 inch of “play” and needs
to be adjusted; or is cracked, frayed, or
otherwise in need of replacement.
It isn’t easy to figure out whether a belt
is at the right tension just by looking at
it, and often it’s obscured by a shield
or cowling. If the belt is loose, you’ll
hear squeaky noises when you acceler-
ate sharply. With the hood up, the
gearshift in Park or Neutral, and the
parking brake on, have a friend accelerate the engine while you listen. Be
sure to keep your hair and clothing away from the belt.
Because tensioners are spring-loaded, they can be unsafe to deal with your-
self. Check your owner’s manual or a service manual for your vehicle’s
make, model, and year to see what’s involved in adjusting your accessory belt.
If you can’t reach the adjusting mechanism without removing other parts, if
adjusting the belt requires special tools, or if it looks as though releasing the
tension may be risky, you should have a professional deal with it.
229
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Car from Getting Heartburn
Figure 12-11: Serpentine multi-accessory
drive belt.

If the belt squeaks, it may have been contaminated by water, coolant, oil, or
another fluid. If it’s just water, check around the water pump and the hoses
to see where the leak is, and eliminate the cause of the leak. The water will
dry up on its own. The belt needs to be replaced if the contaminant is
coolant, oil, power-steering fluid, or some other substance or if the belt has
broken, is frayed, or has large cracks or pieces missing.
If a belt needs to be replaced and you’re dealing with a shop you know and
trust, ask them to check the tensioner. Replacing a tensioner may be costly, so
if it looks as though it may need to be replaced soon, you can avoid having to
pay again for the time and labor to access it by having both jobs done at once.
Replacing Your Thermostat
If your vehicle has been overheating or doesn’t warm up properly and none
of the things in the preceding section is the problem, you may need to
replace your thermostat. This little gizmo simply stays closed and keeps the
liquid in the engine block until the engine heats up. Although it’s a simple
device, it can malfunction.
If the thermostat sticks in the open position, it doesn’t keep the liquid in the
engine long enough, so you have trouble getting your car warmed up. If the
thermostat sticks in the closed position, the liquid isn’t allowed to get to the
radiator, and overheating results.
Because replacing the thermostat is quite simple and thermostats are quite
inexpensive, you may want to try this task before you take more drastic
measures:
1. Locate your thermostat if you haven’t already done so.
Most thermostats are located where the top radiator hose joins the
engine, so these steps deal with this type. If your thermostat is in the
bottom radiator hose, the principle is the same.
2. Buy a new thermostat.
Supply the usual information (vehicle make, model, year, and so on) to
the auto supply store. If you’ve done other work on your vehicle and
have filled out the Specifications Record in Appendix B, you should know
the drill by now.
3. Unscrew the clamp that holds the end of the radiator hose where your
thermostat is located.
4. Pull off the hose.
230
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

Some fluid will escape, so have a clean two-gallon container handy to
catch it, and return the fluid to the radiator when you finish the job. Or
you can consider this a golden opportunity to flush your cooling system
and change the coolant by following the instructions that I provide ear-
lier in this chapter. Whatever you do, avoid spilling the coolant where ani-
mals and small kids can get to it.
5. Remove the bolts that hold the thermostat housing in place, and lift
out the old thermostat.
Compare the new thermostat and its gasket with the old ones. If the new
thermostat and the gasket that’s included with it aren’t exactly like the
old ones, go back to the store for the right ones.
There’s a gasket around the hole where the thermostat was located —
take that off, too. Scrape off any pieces of gasket that may be stuck, but
be sure not to let these pieces fall into the hole!
6. Lay the new gasket in place.
7. Drop in the new thermostat,
making sure to place the spring
side down (see Figure 12-12);
then replace the bolts.
8. Replace the hose, and screw
down the hose clamp.
Screw it down tightly but not
tight enough to cut into the hose.
9. Replace whatever fluid ran out
of the hose by pouring it from
the container into the radiator
fill hole or coolant reservoir.
Be sure not to pour it on the
ground where children and animals can be endangered by it. If you acci-
dentally spill fluid, wipe it up thoroughly before hosing down the area
and place the rags in a sealed plastic bag before disposing of them.
Servicing Air Conditioners
Most people tend to run the air conditioner in their vehicles until it breaks.
However, air conditioners should be serviced professionally each year.
Air conditioners contain refrigerant under pressure, which can injure or 
blind you if it escapes; don’t attempt to work on the air conditioner or its hoses
yourself.
231
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Car from Getting Heartburn
Figure 12-12: Thermostats are replaced
spring side down.

If your vehicle was built prior to 1992, the air conditioner contains a refriger-
ant called Freon (CFC-12). Because Freon contributes to the breakdown of the
ozone layer, manufacturers ceased production of it in 1995. Newer vehicles
use an environmentally acceptable refrigerant called R-134a. It’s possible that
new types of refrigerants may be used as automotive technology changes.
If you have a pre-1992 vehicle and your air conditioner breaks down, you may
find that Freon is hard to obtain. Your options are to run without air condi-
tioning, have the air conditioner converted so that it can use R-134a, or get a
newer vehicle.
To find out the cost to convert a vehicle’s air conditioner from Freon to 
R-134a, consult the auto manufacturer or an authorized dealership or service
facility, or call the EPA Stratospheric Ozone Hotline at 800-296-1996.
Be alert to the following signs that your vehicle’s air conditioner may be in
trouble:
 The air it puts out isn’t as cold as it used to be
 A funny smell is coming from the vents
 The air conditioner’s drive belts, compressor, or blower are noisier than
they used to be
 You hear a rhythmic clicking noise under the hood when you turn on the
air conditioner or defroster
 The defroster no longer defogs the windshield effectively
 You find water on the floor of the passenger compartment
 The cooling fan keeps cycling on and off

hen people think about the good life, they tend to think in terms of
freedom from pressure, discomfort, and friction. If your car could talk,
it would probably agree. When you consider that the temperature in your
vehicle’s combustion chambers can get as high as 4,500°F, with high pres-
sures, the shock of combustion, and many metal parts rubbing and grinding
against one another, you can see that a vehicle that’s not adequately pro-
tected against heat and friction will swiftly come to an untimely death.
Luckily, this kind of protection is cheap and easy to ensure. It’s a simple
matter of providing sufficient lubrication to keep things running smoothly
and then making sure that your vehicle gets regular attention.
Changing the oil is the most essential thing you can do to give your vehicle 
a long and happy life. And changing the oil regularly is a gift that keeps on
giving because an engine that keeps its cool and operates with less effort
uses less fuel. So if you change your oil on a regular basis, you can cut fuel
consumption, which in turn reduces the carbon dioxide emissions that con-
tribute to global warming. Such a deal!
This chapter tells you how to choose the right kind of oil for your vehicle,
how frequently you should change the oil for maximum performance, and
how to do the job quickly and easily.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.

How Oil Benefits Your Vehicle
To choose the proper kind of oil, you should know what that oil is expected to
do. When your engine isn’t running, the oil slops around quietly in a container
called the oil pan, which is located at the bottom of the crankcase just below
the engine (see Figure 13-1). When the engine is running, oil is pumped by an
oil pump through holes and chan-
nels in the engine, where the oil
helps to cool and clean the engine
and provides a nice, slippery cushion
that keeps moving parts from grind-
ing one another into oblivion. The fol-
lowing sections explain in greater
detail how oil benefits your vehicle.
Oil cools the engine
Because the oil pan is located below
the engine, where the air that rushes
past the moving vehicle can cool it,
the oil picks up some of the heat as it
travels around inside the engine and
then cools off when it circulates through the oil pan. Although this isn’t enough
to keep most engines sufficiently cool without a cooling system, it helps.
Oil keeps your engine clean
Most engine oils contain some detergent, which helps flush out the muck that
accumulates inside your engine. Not only does detergent remove and dis-
solve this old sludge, but it also helps prevent new gobs of the stuff from
forming. Believe me, you have no idea of the meaning of any of those yucky
words until you’ve looked into the engine of a vehicle that hasn’t had its oil
changed often enough. Masses of black slimy stuff, hunks of indefinable vile-
ness, and pebble-like particles cling to everything. It’s hard to see how these
engines function at all. Even more depressing are the all-too-visible signs of
wear on steel parts that have been eroded away by this ugly stuff or have
succumbed to friction because the oil lost its ability to protect them. If your
vehicle hasn’t had its oil changed often enough, you can consider the growls
coming out of its engine to be cries of pain!
Oil cuts down on friction
By far the most important thing that the oil in your engine does is to form a
cushion between moving parts to help them slide past one another easily.

Figure 13-1: Oil is filtered as it circulates
through the engine.

This lubrication cuts down friction, which in turn dramatically reduces the
heat and wear that friction can cause.
Figure 13-2 shows you how oil cuts
down on friction. As you can see,
each piston is attached to a connect-
ing rod. Each connecting rod has a
hole in it with a bearing that the
crankshaft fits through, enabling
the crankshaft and the connecting
rod to operate together. Now take 
a closer look at the enlarged portion
of the figure: Notice that there’s a
space around the crankshaft that’s
always filled with oil. When the
engine is running, the oil pressure
forms a cushion that keeps the con-
necting rod bearings from ever
touching the crankshaft. Instead,
each bearing moves on its cushion 
of oil to prevent friction and wear,
which is important because the rod
exerts 4,000 pounds of pressure
every time it moves down. This
arrangement has additional benefits:
If the bearings wear, replacing them
is much less costly than replacing
the connecting rod or the crankshaft.
This same principle applies to other
moving parts in your vehicle.
Oil retards corrosion
Oil retards corrosion in your engine by enveloping the particles of water and
acid that are present. These particles, plus the solid particles that the oil
holds in suspension, contaminate the oil and thin it out. You must change the
oil regularly to get rid of this stuff before it can build up to the point where
the oil can’t do its job properly.
What You Should Know about Oil
Various types of motor oil are on the market, each designed for a particular
purpose. This section helps you choose the proper type of oil for your vehicle
by explaining the significance of the oil additives, viscosity ratings, and classi-
fication codes that you’ll encounter at auto parts stores and service stations.

Oil additives
To help the oil keep your engine cool, calm, collected — and clean and 
corrosion-free — refiners blend in various additives, which can account for
as much as 25 percent of the cost of the oil. (Don’t confuse these with the
aftermarket additives sold at auto supply stores, described in the sidebar
called “Using aftermarket additives: Should you or shouldn’t you?”)
The additives in oil help in the following ways:
 They enable the oil to pour better in cold weather.
 They prevent corrosion of the metal parts of the engine.
 They cut down on friction between moving parts.
 They dissolve impurities and prevent sludge from building up.
 They prevent foaming at high temperatures.
Viscosity ratings
Oil is rated and identified by its viscosity, which determines its ability to
flow. In cold weather, oil thickens and becomes less able to flow through the
engine. In hot weather, oil thins out, and although it flows well enough, it may
become so thin that it can’t prevent friction.
236
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 
Using aftermarket additives: 
Should you or shouldn’t you?
You can buy three basic types of aftermarket
additives in auto parts stores, each of which is
designed to augment the additives in the oil
itself. The first type thickens the oil. The second
type loosens junk and dissolves gummy
deposits. The third type acts as a friction lubri-
cant to make the oil “tougher” under extreme
temperatures and usage.
Remember that even though most oils don’t
advertise the presence of additives, they
already have most of this stuff in them, and no
amount of additional additives can improve the 
performance of oil unless the oil you start with
is of the best grade. If you buy a well-known
brand, you get all the protection you need in
these categories if your engine is in reasonably
good shape. If you use API-rated oil of the
proper weight and classification and change it
often, you can leave the rest of the additives on
the store shelves. They may provide temporary
relief if the engine is disintegrating, but they’re
not a cure for a worn-down, filthy, miserable old
engine. And using aftermarket oil additives
actually may void manufacturer’s warranty on
some engines.

Two types of oil are on the market: single-viscosity oil and multi-viscosity oil.
(These are also called single-weight and multi-weight or multigrade.) For many
years almost every vehicle has been designed to run on multi-viscosity oil.
Automakers rate oil viscosity according to the temperature range expected
over the oil change period. The lower the number, the thinner the oil and the
more easily it flows. In 10W-40 oil, for example, the two numbers mean that
it’s a multi-viscosity oil that’s effective over a range of temperatures. The first
number, 10, is an index that refers to how the oil flows at low temperatures.
The second number, 40, refers to how it flows at high temperatures. The W
designation means that the oil can be used in winter.
To find out which viscosity to choose for your vehicle, look in your owner’s
manual for an oil viscosity chart. Just select the range of temperatures in
any location where you plan to spend a good deal of time driving and the
type of driving conditions you will operate under, and look on the chart for
the grade of oil recommended for use. If you don’t have an owner’s manual,
check with your dealership.
The “Choosing the Right Oil for Your Vehicle” section later in this chapter
provides some surprising information on how your driving conditions affect
the kind of oil you should buy and how often you should change it.
Oil classification codes
The oil industry’s American Petroleum Institute (API) has adopted a symbol
to certify that a particular motor oil meets the latest industry requirements
and codes for protection against deposits, wear, oxidation, and corrosion.
The starburst symbol on an oil container label shown in Figure 13-3 means
that the oil meets the current engine protection standard and fuel economy
requirements of the International Lubricant Standardization and Approval
Committee (ILSAC), a joint effort of U.S. and Japanese automobile manufac-
turers. The API donut symbols also shown in Figure 13-3 mean that the oil
meets Energy Conserving requirements (it improves fuel economy by reduc-
ing engine friction). Oils without these symbols may not perform as well.
The classification codes for vehicles with gasoline engines started with SA in
the early 1960s. As engines became more demanding and oil improved, the
codes progressed alphabetically from SB onward. Any oil coded before SJ is
no longer considered current. You can use SM (and any future grades that
come along) in a vehicle of any age to make the engine run and feel better. All
the major brands of oil with the API symbol are equally good.
At publication, CI-4 Plus oil is the latest, most advanced oil for diesel engines.
Oils with CF (or higher) designations also are currently acceptable. For more
complete classifications for diesel oils, see Chapter 9.

symbol for diesel engine oil (c).
Synthetic oil
A lot of claims have been made about synthetic oils: that they allow longer
intervals between oil changes, result in less wear on engine parts, and are able
to operate at higher engine temperatures. The longer interval claim has yet to
be proven; in fact, one synthetic oil manufacturer that claimed a 20,000-mile
oil change interval for its oil has retracted that claim and now suggests that its
oil be changed at the normal frequency for mineral-based oils.
A Consumer Reports test found no difference in engine wear between vehicles
that had mineral oils in their engines and those that had synthetic oils in their
engines. There’s no doubt, however, that synthetic oils do perform better than
mineral oils at very low and very high temperatures. So if you live in a very
cold or hot climate, or if your engine works very hard pulling a trailer or climb-
ing steep hills, synthetic oil may be right for you. Just be forewarned that syn-
thetic oil is expensive; it can cost three times as much as mineral-based oil.
A compromise between synthetic and mineral oil has been developed. This
blend of mineral and synthetic oil sells for less than synthetic oil and more
than mineral oil.
Choosing the Right Oil for Your Vehicle
If all the preceding variables have you wondering how you’re going to choose
the right oil for your vehicle, ask yourself the following questions:
 What kind of oil have you been using? If your vehicle is running well,
there’s probably nothing to be gained by switching to another brand of
oil. There’s not a lot of difference between API-rated oils as far as per-
formance is concerned, and you’d have to drain all the oil out of your
engine before replacing it with another brand.

 What kind of oil does your owner’s manual recommend? Is your vehi-
cle still under warranty? Be sure to use whatever weight of oil the
owner’s manual recommends. Using something other than the recom-
mended oil may invalidate the warranty on a new vehicle.
Some car manufacturers now offer their own brands of motor oil specifi-
cally designed for their vehicles, and if you have a vehicle with that kind
of oil in it, it’s a good idea to continue to use it. Otherwise, stick with the
same stuff you’ve been using as long as it bears the API symbols and is
the proper weight for your vehicle.
 Do you live in a very cold or very hot climate? Is it mountainous? Are
there sharp changes in temperature where you live or where you’re
going? Multi-weight oils cover a range of temperatures. Consult a viscos-
ity chart to be sure that the oil you use will flow properly under extreme
conditions.
The lower the number after the “W,” the better the oil works in cold
weather; the higher the number after the “W,” the better the hot weather
performance. For example, the best oil for a Minnesota winter may be a
0W-20 and the best for a Florida summer 30W-50.
If you’re going to be driving your vehicle in an area where the conditions
are very different from those at home and those conditions call for oil 
of a different viscosity than you usually use, drain all the oil from the
engine before switching to the new viscosity, and drain it again before
switching back to your usual weight oil after the trip is over.
 How old is your vehicle? If you have a really old vehicle that has been
running on single-weight oil for most of its life, it has built up quite a bit
of sludge because some single-weight oils don’t have detergent in them.
If you suddenly switch to multi-viscosity oil, the detergent in it will free
all the gook in your engine, and the gook will really foul things up. 
 How worn is your vehicle’s engine? If your vehicle has been logging a
great many miles over several years and has been running on 30- or 40-
single-weight oil, multi-weight oil isn’t consistently thick enough to lubri-
cate the worn engine parts that have become smaller while wearing
down, leaving wider spaces between them. To keep the oil thick enough
to fill these gaps, switch to heavier single-weight oil as your vehicle gets
older and starts to run more roughly or burn up oil more quickly. If
you’ve been running on 30-weight oil, switch to 40-weight at least during
the summer, when oil tends to thin out. The manual for Tweety Bird (my
faithful 1967 Mustang) called for 10W-40 oil, but when she had more than
80,000 miles to her credit, I put her on straight 40-weight oil. There’s
even 50-weight oil for the real oldies!
Whenever you buy oil, look for major brands or check Consumer Reports.
Good brands of oil are often on sale in supermarkets and at auto supply
stores, so if you want to save money and you spot a sale of a major brand
with API certification, buy a case and stash it away.
239
Chapter 13: Oil: Keeping Your Car Young and Happy

No matter how cheap low-grade oil is, it will cost you money in lower fuel econ-
omy, poorer performance, and repair bills for wear and tear on your engine.
How Often You Should Change Your Oil
Dirty oil just doesn’t do the job as well as fresh oil does. The additives in
dirty oil boil out, contaminants form in the crankcase and eat metal parts,
and water collects over time and forms sludge. The oil holds more and more
abrasive particles of metal suspended in it, and these particles wear away the
parts of the engine that the oil is supposed to protect. That’s why you should
change your oil at regular, reasonable intervals. But what is a reasonable
amount of time — or mileage — between oil changes?
All oil looks pretty black within a couple of days after an oil change, so the
only way to avoid running on oil that’s so dirty that it becomes a liability is to
keep a record of when it was last changed and to change it frequently — as
often as every 1,000 miles in extreme operating conditions (I get to what
240
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 
What to do when no amount or type of oil can help
If your vehicle has a worn, clanking workhorse
engine, investigate the following alternatives to
an oil change:
 Find out how much it would cost to rebuild
the engine. A simple engine rebuild only
replaces parts that are completely worn
out, leaving you an engine with some new
and some half-worn pieces. The price
depends on how many parts have to be
replaced and how much work is involved.
Prepare to pay up to $2,000 to $4,000 for this
service — perhaps more if you have a
newer engine.
 Buy a new engine or a good remanufac-
tured one and have it installed. This is a
more expensive but often longer-lasting
solution if you just have to keep Old Faithful
or are restoring a classic car. The cost,
including labor, can easily range from $2,500
to over $5,000 — perhaps more for modern
engines with fancy electronic components.
But that’s still cheaper than a new vehicle,
and you get all-new parts.
Be sure to check your vehicle’s current blue
book value at www.kbb.com or www.
edmunds.com to see whether a new or
remanufactured engine is worth the
expense, keeping in mind that other sys-
tems may be at the point of wearing out, as
well.
If rebuilding or replacing the engine will
cost more than the vehicle’s blue book
value, it’s not worthwhile (unless Old
Faithful has sentimental value because your
firstborn was conceived in the backseat).
 Put Old Faithful out of its misery. You’ll both
be happier in the long run. Either sell it to a
wrecker who will resell some of its parts
and recycle the rest, or donate it to a char-
ity and put the tax deduction toward the
purchase of a replacement vehicle.

those are in a minute). By changing your oil frequently, you may get twice the
mileage out of an otherwise good engine.
You’ll be surprised by what some “extreme operating conditions” are: If you
do a lot of stop-and-go driving in city or rush-hour traffic, make a lot of short
trips each day and leave the car parked long enough to have your engine cool
down between them, and don’t often get up to high speeds on a highway,
your engine rarely gets hot enough to evaporate the water that forms in the
crankcase and builds up sludge in the engine. Other extreme conditions are if
you drive in very hot weather or in areas with a lot of blowing dust or dirt, or
tow or haul heavy loads all the time. In any of these circumstances, change
the oil as often as every 1,000 to 3,000 miles on older vehicles. On new vehi-
cles, follow the manufacturers’ recommendations for extreme use.
Some manufacturers suggest that oil be changed every 7,500 miles or more, but
that’s based on optimum operating conditions, and the manufacturers are the
ones who get to sell you a new vehicle if your old one wears out prematurely.
Although new vehicles can run longer on the same oil than older ones can, and
improvements in motor oil have extended its efficiency over longer periods of
time, to be on the safe side, I now change my oil every 5,000 miles or every six
months, whichever comes first. If you’re a freeway driver who goes on a lot of
long journeys at high speeds, you can probably extend the oil change interval,
but on anything but the newest vehicles I wouldn’t go longer than 5,000 miles
between changes. And never, under any circumstances, go farther than the
manufacturer’s recommended maximum interval between oil changes.
How to Change Your Oil Yourself
Changing oil is usually easy. In fact, unless it’s impossible to reach your oil
filter and/or oil drain plug, you have good reasons to change your oil and
oil filter yourself: It’s cheaper, you know that the job’s being done right, and it
requires little time or effort. (During one of my TV guest appearances, Regis
Philbin changed the oil in a car in five minutes, and he didn’t get a spot on his
Italian silk suit!) All you have to do is unscrew a plug and a filter, let the oil
drain out, replace the filter and plug, and pour in some new oil.
If you have a professional do it for you, you have to telephone the shop to
make an appointment, drive the car in, either wait for it or find a ride home
and back again to pick it up, and then wait until they write up your bill — all
of which takes much longer than changing your oil yourself. If you go to 
one of those quickie oil change places, you don’t know what viscosity and
grade of oil they’ve really used, whether they really changed the filter, and
whether the drain plug was secured properly. (If you don’t think that’s a
problem, check out the nearby sidebar “A tragic tale”!) Most important, when
you see how inexpensive and easy it is to do this job yourself, you’ll change
your oil as often as necessary rather than adding visits to the service station
to your procrastination list!
241
Chapter 13: Oil: Keeping Your Car Young and Happy

If you can’t reach the oil filter or drain plug without having to crawl under
your vehicle, or if you want to chicken out of the job for any other reason,
most shops regularly offer low-priced specials for changing oil or include it 
in maintenance packages. Just be sure that they use the right grade of high-
quality oil for your vehicle and that they change the oil filter, too. To be sure
they’ve replaced the drain plug, drive the car off the spot where they’ve
parked it and look for fresh oil on the ground that was under it. Paranoid?
Maybe, but if the oil drains out while you’re driving, you could ruin the engine
in a matter of blocks.
Get your supplies together
Before you start the job, assemble the following items:
 Oil: Check your owner’s manual to find the proper oil viscosity recom-
mended for your vehicle and the number of quarts you need. (As a gen-
eral rule, most vehicles require five to six quarts of oil, but you don’t
want to risk overfilling it.) If you have no manual, call a local dealer who
sells your vehicle’s make and model and ask someone in the service
department. Or find the information at your local library in a service
manual for your vehicle’s make, model, and year.
 An oil filter: Under the hood of most cars, sticking out of the engine is
what looks like a tin can screwed into the engine block. This is the oil
filter (see Figure 13-4). As the oil circulates from the oil pan through
your engine, it passes through this filter, which cleans the oil and
removes some of the particles of metal and dirt. Change the oil filter
242
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 
A tragic tale
Before I stopped being an automotive “dummy,”
my family car, Big Green Feller, resided for its first
35,000 miles in a commercial garage where pro-
fessional mechanics looked after it. Whenever
they said that the car needed the oil changed, I
scheduled the work promptly. Yet when I took the
engine apart in an adult-education automotive
class, I found that the mechanics had never
changed the oil! This lack of proper lubrication
had led to big trouble: The dirty old oil had formed
big, black pebbles, and the camshaft had practi-
cally worn away! When this happens, either you
opt for major and expensive surgery or you get
rid of the vehicle. As I sadly watched Big Green
Feller vanish into the sunset, the major question
on my mind was, “How did this happen?”
The answer, unfortunately, was that I’d
depended on someone else for lubrication
reminders and had trusted someone else to do
the job properly. Not only had I been paying at
least twice as much as it would have cost to do
the job myself, but I ended up paying to replace
a car that could have gone almost twice as far
if it had been lubricated properly.

every time you change your oil,
especially if you do it less fre-
quently than every 5,000 miles.
Oil filters sell for very little at
auto supply stores (at a service
station, you’ll usually pay more).
Check the price of an oil filter at
your dealer’s parts department.
If it’s within a dollar or two of
the auto parts store price, buy
it. It’s probably a better filter.
(Some of the auto parts store fil-
ters are very cheaply made, and
they fail occasionally.) Make
sure to get the right filter for
your vehicle’s make and model!
 An oil filter wrench (optional):
Most oil filters screw on and off.
If your old filter hasn’t been
changed in a long time, you may
need an oil filter wrench, like the one shown in Figure 13-5, to unscrew
your filter. Always tighten the new filter by hand to avoid crushing the seal.
 An adjustable wrench: Use this tool
to unscrew the oil drain plug. If
you’re not sure what an adjustable
wrench is, see Chapter 3.
 A screwdriver: Select one that’s
strong enough to punch a hole in an
oil filter (you’ll find out why later on).
 An oil drain plug gasket: If you buy
your oil filter from a dealership, a
new gasket may be in the package. If
it isn’t, get a gasket for your vehi-
cle’s make, model, and year.
Some vehicles don’t have drain plug
gaskets, relying instead on a tapered
metal-to-metal contact to prevent oil
leakage. Don’t try to use a gasket on
one of these arrangements. It won’t
work, and you may end up with your
new oil in a pool on the floor.
 A drain pan to catch the oil: Find an
old basin that’s low enough to fit
under your vehicle’s drain plug with-
out the necessity of jacking up the car, and large enough to hold all the
old oil — usually about five quarts. Line the basin with a heavy-duty
243
Chapter 13: Oil: Keeping Your Car Young and Happy
Figure 13-4: An oil filter.
Figure 13-5: An oil filter wrench.

plastic garbage bag, opened so that it can catch the oil, leaving the basin
clean.
You can buy a container made especially for catching old oil. These con-
tainers are reusable, but you have to wash them out and find a place to
keep them, or throw them out and buy another one each time. More
important, you can’t recycle the oil that’s drained into them.
 A funnel: Oil is sold in containers that have narrow necks to facilitate
pouring the oil into the engine. If you’re still worried about your aim, use
a funnel to prevent messy spills. The funnel also comes in handy for
decanting the used oil into containers for recycling. See the later section
“Recycle your old oil and filter” for instructions on doing that.
 Thin disposable plastic gloves to keep your hands clean: You also can
use dish detergent to easily remove oil from your hands.
 Things to clean up oil: You should have a clean, lint-free rag handy for
wiping your oil dipstick and a dirty, old, thick rag that you don’t mind
throwing away to use on spills and tools. You can use paper towels to
clean up spills and tools, but don’t risk bits of paper getting into your
engine by using paper to tidy it up. (If you own a cat, kitty litter is the
best way to sop up spills on the ground, but not on the engine. See the
later section “Clean up spilled oil thoroughly” for more instructions.)
 A work light: A work light helps you see better underneath the vehicle;
a flashlight can be awkward if you have to hold it between your teeth!
Do the job systematically
Always use a system when you do an oil change: Do each part of the job in
order, and don’t change that order from job to job. This may sound unduly
restrictive if you like to improvise, but if you ignore this advice, you may find
that you’ve added the new oil before replacing the oil drain plug or the oil
filter. In either case, you wind up with your brand-new oil all over the ground
and not enough oil in the engine to drive to the store for more. Also, the
minute you replace the oil drain plug, always tighten it completely and — 
so that you won’t forget it — put in the new oil immediately. (Don’t laugh;
people have forgotten and have ruined their engines in a couple of miles.)
Although the oil change process takes 17 steps to explain, it shouldn’t take
more than 15 minutes to accomplish after you buy the necessary stuff. Follow
these easy steps to change your oil and oil filter:
1. Either park on level ground or in such a way that the oil drain plug is
at the lower end of the oil pan.
If you’ve chosen to disregard my suggestion that you not do the job if
you have to jack up your vehicle, at least read Chapter 1 to be sure that
you do so safely. Block the wheels, use jack stands, and don’t jack the
car up too high, or the oil may not drain out of the oil pan completely. If 
244
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

you can, jack up the vehicle so that the oil drain plug is at the lower end
of the oil pan.
2. Before you begin work, be sure your gearshift is in Park or Neutral
with the parking brake on, and set out all your tools and equipment.
Place all the stuff you’re going to use within easy reach so that you don’t
have to jump up and run around to the other side of the vehicle in the
middle of the job.
3. Warm up your engine for two or three minutes so that the gook gets
churned up and can flow out of the engine easily.
You don’t want the engine so hot that you burn yourself. When it’s
slightly warm, shut off the engine.
4. Use a work light or flashlight to look under your car. You should be
able to see and reach a large nut or plug located under the oil pan at
the bottom of the engine (see Figure 13-6).
This is the oil drain plug.
It unscrews with the aid of
an adjustable wrench. If the
plug is too hot to touch
comfortably, let the engine
cool off for a while longer.
If you can’t reach your oil
drain plug easily and you
still want to do this job
yourself, you’ll have to
either crawl under your car
to reach the plug or jack up
the car.
5. Push the basin with the plastic bag opened inside it (or the oil-change
container) under the oil drain plug so that it can catch the oil.
The oil may not come down vertically to start with; it may come out
sideways from the direction the drain plug is facing. Allow room for that
when you place the drain pan.
6. Use your adjustable wrench to unscrew the oil drain plug until it’s
almost ready to come out. Then protect your hand with the dirty rag
or a disposable plastic glove, and give the plug a last quick turn by
hand to release it. Pull your hand away quickly so that you don’t get
oil all over yourself.
If the plug falls into the container, you can retrieve it later. The oil should
drain out of your engine into the container (remember to retrieve the
gasket if, against my recommendation, you’re going to reuse it). While the
oil drains, get out from under the vehicle and take a look under the hood.

bottom of your oil pan.

7. Remove the cap from the oil filler hole at the top of your engine.
This large cap is easy to recognize: It lifts or screws right off, revealing a
largish hole.
8. Unscrew the oil filter
using an oil filter
wrench if you can’t do 
it by hand.
The oil filter looks like a
tin can that’s screwed
onto the engine (see
Figure 13-7). Like most
other things you find on
a vehicle, the oil filter
unscrews if you twist it
counterclockwise. The
old filter will have oil in
it, so be careful not to dump it on anything when you remove it. If any rem-
nants of the rubber seal from the old filter remain on your engine,
scrape them off carefully, making sure they don’t fall into the hole.
On some vehicles, you can easily reach the oil filter by leaning under the
hood. Unfortunately, on other models the filter must be reached from
under the vehicle. If your vehicle is one of these, you may have to jack
the vehicle up to get at it.
9. Empty the oil from the filter into the drain pan.
Use a screwdriver to punch a hole in the dome of the can (which
releases the pressure in the filter) and invert it in the drain pan to allow
the oil to flow out. When the filter has drained completely (this can take
as long as 12 hours), wrap it in newspaper and set it aside to take to a
recycling center with your old oil (see the section “Recycle your old oil
and filter” later in this chapter).
10. While the old oil drains out of the engine, open a new bottle of oil.
Dip a finger in the new oil and moisten the gasket on the top of the
new oil filter. Then screw the new filter into the engine where the old
one was.
Follow directions on the filter, or turn it gently until it settles into place,
and then turn it another three-quarter turn. Unless the filter manufac-
turer specifically recommends it or there isn’t enough space to get your
hand into the area, don’t use an oil filter wrench to tighten the filter. It
should fit tightly, but you don’t want to crush the gasket or the filter 
will leak.
11. Reach under the vehicle again and use your dirty rag to wipe around
the place where the oil drain plug goes.
246
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 
Figure 13-7: The oil filter is screwed onto your engine.

12. Replace the oil drain plug and use an adjustable wrench to tighten it.
If your vehicle uses an oil drain plug gasket, make sure that the old
one has been removed, and lay a new gasket on the pan before you
replace the plug.
13. After you install the oil filter and replace the oil drain plug, use a
funnel — or just good aim — to pour all but one quart of fresh oil into
the oil filler hole.
14. Replace the oil filler cap and run the engine for 30 to 60 seconds while
you check for leaks from the oil drain plug and around the filter.
The oil pressure light on your dashboard should go out in 10 or 15 sec-
onds (or if your vehicle has an oil pressure gauge, the needle should
move off of “Low”). Don’t rev up your engine during this period. Your oil
pressure ranges from zero to low while the light is on and won’t reach
the proper pressure until your oil filter fills up. If the light doesn’t go out,
check under the vehicle and around the engine for leaks. Running the
engine circulates oil into the new oil filter, and because filters hold from
a half to a full quart of oil, you want to be sure that your filter is full to
get an accurate reading on the oil dipstick.
15. Shut off the engine and wait five to ten minutes for the oil to settle
into the oil pan. Then remove the oil dipstick, wipe it with a clean,
lint-free rag, and shove it back in. Pull it out again and check it.
Refer to Figure 2-10 in Chapter 2 if you don’t know what an oil dipstick
looks like. Your owner’s manual should tell you where it is on your engine.
16. Keep adding oil a little at a time and checking the stick until you
reach the “Full” line on the dipstick.
17. Remove the drain pan from under the vehicle, drive around the block
a couple of times, let the oil settle down again, and recheck the dip-
stick and the dashboard indicator.
Never keep running an engine or drive a vehicle that tells you its oil 
pressure is low. Because oil not only lubricates but also helps cool the
engine, you can ruin your engine if you drive even a short distance with
insufficient oil or with a defective oil pump.
In Appendix B, enter the vehicle mileage and date of the oil change in the
Maintenance Record and the oil filter make and part number, with the weight
and amount of oil you needed, on the Specifications Record.
When you see how easy changing the oil is, you’ll tend to change your oil
more frequently, and your vehicle will perform better, last longer, burn less
fuel, and cause less air pollution. You’ll feel pretty happy with yourself, too!

Chapter 13: Oil: Keeping Your Car Young and Happy

Clean up spilled oil thoroughly
You can’t just hose off oil you’ve spilled on the ground — it will only rise to
the surface of the water and spread to a larger area. The best way to clean up
spilled oil is to cover the oil with a generous layer of kitty litter, let it soak 
up the oil for a few hours (it will even pull some up out of the concrete or
asphalt), then sweep up and properly dispose of the oil-soaked stuff. Next,
squirt some liquid dishwashing soap onto the stain and scrub with a stiff
brush; or on unpainted concrete, scrub the area with a solution of half laun-
dry soap and half bleach. Wipe up the dirty cleaning liquid with paper or
cloth towels, and rinse the area well.
Recycle your old oil and filter
Never dump oil onto the ground, throw it out with your regular garbage, or flush
it down a drain. It’s a major toxic pollutant that needs to be treated accord-
ingly. In many locales, putting oil filters into a landfill is against the law, so
you may risk a fine.
So what do you do with your old oil? Decant the oil from the garbage bag that
was in your collection pan into clean disposable containers with tight-fitting,
screw-on lids — the bottles that the new oil came in or old, washed soda bot-
tles work well. Place a funnel in the neck of the container, tie-off the bag, and
hold it above the funnel. Then cut a tiny hole in a bottom corner of the bag
and let the oil drain out of the bag into the funnel and container. You may
want to cover the ground underneath the container with a thick layer of
newspapers. (If you spill oil anyway, see the preceding section “Clean up
spilled oil thoroughly.”)
Oil recyclers probably won’t accept oil that’s contaminated with another sub-
stance or in a dirty container, so take it to a toxic waste disposal center.
The Steel Recycling Institute says that if all the oil filters sold in the United
States each year were recycled, enough material would be recovered to build
16 stadiums the size of Atlanta’s Olympic Stadium! Many auto parts stores
and some service stations accept old oil and oil filters for recycling. If you
don’t have one close by, look in your local yellow pages for the nearest oil
recycling center or toxic waste disposal center, or visit www.earth911.org
or www.filtercouncil.org and type in your zip code.

T
his chapter deals with an automotive system that most people take for
granted even though it may be the only system in your vehicle that can
kill you if you don’t keep it in good repair. As you’ve probably guessed —
especially if you read chapter titles — I’m talking about your brakes.
As with the other basic automotive systems covered in this book, 
I deal with brakes in two parts: This chapter covers the general theory
behind brakes and braking systems, and Chapter 15 tackles the hands-on
information you need to repair and maintain them.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Brake System Basics
One reason that today’s vehicles are the safest in history is that, since 1968,
all vehicles come equipped with dual brake systems to ensure that if one set
of brakes fails, the other set can still stop your car (see the “Dual brakes”
sidebar later in this chapter). Your vehicle also has a dashboard light to warn
you if your brakes are malfunctioning. A growing number of modern vehicles
not only are equipped with hydraulic brake systems but also feature 
electronic brake systems that operate even more safely and efficiently.
Because electronic brake systems employ most of the same hydraulic parts
as hydraulic systems, I start with the basics and get to the more advanced
systems later in this chapter.

Figure 14-1 shows a basic brake system with a brake booster, disc brakes on
the front wheels, and drum brakes on the rear wheels. Your vehicle may have
disc brakes all around, but the principle is the same in any case.
Figure 14-1: A brake system with drum brakes at the rear and discs 
up front.
The following sections take a look at each of the components of a basic
hydraulic brake system, starting with the first point of contact between you
and your brakes and working down the line to the brakes themselves.
The brake pedal
The brake pedal in your vehicle is attached to a shaft that leads to the brake
master cylinder. When you step on the brake pedal, small pistons in the
master cylinder force brake fluid out of the master cylinder and into the
brake lines. (I tell you how to buy the proper brake fluid and work with it
safely in the “Flushing and Changing Brake Fluid” section in Chapter 15.)

Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

If your brakes are working properly, the pedal should stop a couple of inches
from the floor. It should push down easily, stop firmly at its lowest point with-
out feeling spongy, and stay put instead of sinking down slowly when you put
normal pressure on it. Chapter 15 shows you how to check the brakes on
your vehicle.
Power brakes
Today, most vehicles have power brakes with a brake booster located
between the brake pedal and the master cylinder to increase the force applied
to the pistons in the master cylinder so that your car can stop with less effort
on your part (see Figure 14-2). The two most common types of power brake
boosters are vacuum-assisted boosters, which use engine vacuum and atmos-
pheric pressure to do the job; and hydraulic-assisted boosters (commonly
referred to as hydro-boost units), which use hydraulic pressure from the car’s
power steering to accomplish the same thing. Some vehicles with anti-lock
braking systems (ABS) have a hydraulic pump to generate pressure for
booster operation. (You can find a section on ABS later in this chapter.)
Figure 14-2: When you step on the brake pedal, the brake booster activates the master
cylinder.
Your owner’s manual can tell you what kind(s) of brakes you have on your
vehicle, in case you don’t already know, but seeing for yourself is more fun.
Later in this chapter, I cover each type of brakes in detail.

Chapter 14: It’s the Brakes!

The brake master cylinder
Under the hood of your car, usually up near the firewall on the driver’s side,
you should see either a metal box (see Figure 14-3) or, on most newer vehicles, a
plastic container (see Figure 14-4). This is the brake master cylinder (refer to
Figure 14-2). It’s filled with brake fluid and is connected to your brake pedal,
with brake lines leading from it to the four wheels of your vehicle. Stepping on
the brake pedal activates the brake power booster, which activates the pistons
in the master cylinder, forcing brake fluid out of the master cylinder into the
brake lines. When you release the pedal, the fluid flows back into the master
cylinder. In Chapter 15, I show you how to open and check the master cylinder
safely. This task is also part of the monthly under-the-hood check in Chapter 2.

Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

Brake lines
The brake lines run from the master cylinder along the frame of your vehicle
to each wheel. The lines are made of steel except for the portions that lie
right near your front wheels and your rear axle. These portions are made 
of rubber or synthetic material that’s flexible enough to contend with 
the greater amount of movement that takes place in these areas as the
suspension system works and the wheels turn when you steer.
Brake fluid
Although electronic brakes using electric motors to do the work are in 
development, brake systems today still are activated by hydraulic fluid
called, you guessed it, brake fluid. You can make your brake system work
better and live longer if you change the fluid — or have it changed by your
mechanic — once every 24 months, regardless of mileage. Brake fluid soaks
up moisture from the atmosphere. As this water contaminates it, the boiling
point of the brake fluid lowers until it can reach a point where it begins to
boil as brake heat builds up. When that happens, the air bubbles in the boil-
ing fluid cause the brakes to fail, a situation nobody wants. Chapter 15 tells
you how to change brake fluid.
253
Chapter 14: It’s the Brakes!
Dual brakes
A dual brake system simply means that the
inside of the master cylinder is divided into two
compartments, each filled with brake fluid. On a
vehicle with rear-wheel drive, one compart-
ment has brake lines that lead to the brakes on
the front wheels; the other compartment has
lines leading to the brakes at the rear wheels
(refer to Figure 14-3). If a leak or a block devel-
ops in one set of lines, the fluid in that com-
partment is lost or useless. But the other com-
partment and set of brakes can still stop your
vehicle. It may not stop smoothly, but it will stop,
and in such a case, that’s all that counts! This
simple modification has saved countless lives.
Most front-wheel drive vehicles have a diago-
nally split hydraulic brake system that ties the
right-front wheel with the left-rear wheel and
the left-front wheel with the right-rear wheel.
That’s because the front brakes on front-wheel
drive vehicles do almost 90 percent of the brak-
ing. By diagonally splitting the hydraulic system,
you always have one front brake and one rear
brake operating in the event of a hydraulic 
failure.

The parts discussed thus far are common to most hydraulic brake systems.
Now for some of the major differences: When you press the brake pedal and
force the brake fluid from the master cylinder into the brake lines, what hap-
pens next depends on the type of brakes you have. For many years, cars had
drum brakes (see Figure 14-5) on all four wheels. As you can see in Figure 14-1,
some vehicles have drum brakes on the rear wheels and disc brakes (see
Figure 14-8) on the front wheels. Today, many vehicles have four-wheel disc
brakes, and most have the power brakes described earlier in this chapter.
Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) also have become popular, and I get to
them shortly.
Drum Brakes
Drum brakes, shown in Figure 14-5, are the oldest type of brakes still on the
road. Their main advantage is that they require less hydraulic pressure to
stop your vehicle because the brake shoes tend to screw themselves into
the brake drums after the pistons in the wheel cylinders push them there.
The following sections get you acquainted with what’s inside drum brakes
and how they work. Chapter 15 shows you how to access a drum brake and
check its condition.
Even if your vehicle has disc brakes all around, you should read this section
because they work on the same principles as drum brakes.

Brake drums
Brake drums are hollow steel cylinders located in back of each wheel (refer
to Figure 14-5). Because the lug bolts that go through them are the same as
the ones that go through the wheels of your vehicle, the drums turn when the
wheels turn. If you keep your brakes in good condition and replace your
brake linings before they become too worn, your brake drums should last
for the life of your vehicle. If drums become worn, they can be “reground” or
“turned” to a smooth surface — unless they’re worn more than their manu-
facturer’s recommendation (usually more than .060 of an inch), in which case
the drums must be replaced. Chapter 15 shows you how to inspect your
brake drums and get a fair deal if they need work.
Wheel cylinders
As you can see in Figure 14-6, wheel cylinders are small but powerful mecha-
nisms located inside each brake drum on the brake backing plate.
Figure 14-6: Anatomy of a wheel cylinder.
The brake fluid that’s forced through the brake lines by the piston in the
master cylinder goes into the wheel cylinders. The fluid then activates the
two small pistons located inside each wheel cylinder by forcing them farther
apart. The pistons emerge from either end of the wheel cylinder and push
against the brake shoes. Figure 14-7 shows how the wheel cylinders work.

Chapter 14: It’s the Brakes!

Seals inside the wheel cylinder, called cups, keep the brake fluid from leaking
out. Dust boots on each end of the wheel cylinder prevent dirt and dust from
entering and fouling the cylinder.
Figure 14-7: A drum brake in action.
Brake shoes
As you can see in Figure 14-7, brake shoes are curved pieces of metal that
stop the vehicle when the pistons in the wheel cylinders push them against
the inside of the brake drum. The brake shoes are attached to a set of springs
that draw them back into place when you take your foot off the brake pedal.
Chapter 15 provides tips on getting the best deal if your brake shoes have to
be replaced.
Brake linings
Either bonded or riveted to the brake shoes are curved brake linings of
tough, very heat-resistant material. As you can see in Figure 14-7, when the
brake shoes are forced against the insides of the brake drum, the linings
create friction, which causes the brake drum to stop turning. This in turn
forces the wheels to stop turning, which stops the car.
The brake linings on front-wheel drum brakes have a larger surface than
those on the rear wheels because the front wheels bear most of the pressure
of stopping (the weight shifts from the rear to the front when you brake).
Also, in a front-wheel drive vehicle, most of the weight of the drive train is
up front to begin with. For these reasons, on each set of brake linings on any

2. Fluid in the wheel cylinder

3. As the brake shoes are

wheel, the lining toward the front of the vehicle is larger and often is a differ-
ent color so that mechanics don’t make a mistake when replacing them.
You should check your brake linings for wear every 10,000 to 20,000 miles.
Chapter 15 shows you how.
Adjusting devices
Drum brakes that could be manually adjusted used to be popular, but today’s
passenger vehicles have self-adjusting brakes. The self-adjusting device is
located at the bottom of the brake backing plate. These devices are used to
adjust the distance between the surface of the brake lining and the inside of
the brake drum when you step on the brake pedal. As your brake linings
become worn, the distance increases, and the adjustment compensates for
that. If you didn’t have a self-adjusting device and your linings became very
worn, eventually the brake shoes wouldn’t contact the inside of the drum and
your car wouldn’t stop. You can see the self-adjusting device on the drum
brake in Figure 14-5.
Disc Brakes
Disc brakes used to be found mainly on the
front wheels of vehicles, with drum brakes
at the rear (refer to Figure 14-1). Today most
passenger vehicles have disc brakes all
around. Each brake has a flat steel disc —
you knew that, right? — sandwiched
between a pair of calipers (see Figure 14-8)
or a single caliper (see Figure 14-9). These
calipers contain one or more pistons that
force the brake fluid in the brake lines into
the disc. Between the disc (sometimes
called a rotor) and the pistons are brake
pads, which operate in the same way that
brake shoes do: They grab the disc with
their friction linings and force the disc to stop
turning, which in turn forces the wheel to
stop turning and the vehicle to stop moving.
The effect is the same as on a bicycle when the brakes grab the wheel directly
to stop it from turning. Chapter 15 tells you how to inspect and troubleshoot
disc brakes.

Chapter 14: It’s the Brakes!

Disc

Figure 14-8: A multiple caliper disc
brake.

Older vehicles use fixed-caliper brake systems in which one or two pistons on
each side of the disc push the pad against it. A single-piston floating-caliper
disc brake system is becoming increasingly popular (see Figure 14-9). When
you apply the brakes, the caliper moves from side to side and centers itself.
Because these systems are self-adjusting, more reliable, and less expensive,
they’ll probably become the standard.
Figure 14-9: Anatomy of a single-piston, floating-caliper disc brake.
Disc brakes have advantages over drum brakes. Because they operate in the
open air (instead of inside brake drums), they’re less prone to overheating.
They’re also less affected by water because the leading edge of each brake
pad scrapes the water away before it can get between the pads and the disc.
(When drum brakes get wet, the brake linings may not grab the brake drum
satisfactorily and the car may not stop.)
The Parking Brake
The parking brake, or emergency brake, is usually attached to a car’s rear
wheels. On vehicles with rear drum brakes, the parking brake is usually
attached with cables to the rear brakes, as shown in Figure 14-10. These are
called integral parking brakes (see Figure 14-11). Although most newer vehi-
cles have self-adjusting systems, if your vehicle doesn’t you can easily adjust
the cables, which run underneath the car, by turning a screw that controls
the tension on the cable. Chapter 15 provides instructions on how to do so.

On other vehicles with drum brakes, different devices do the same job. Some
parking brakes on vehicles with rear-wheel drive are linked to the transmis-
sion, and rather than activating the rear brakes, they stop the driveshaft
from turning the rear wheels. On these brakes, shown in Figure 14-12, the
band and lining are attached to a drum on the transmission. When you pull
the lever, the band squeezes the lining against the drum, and the driveshaft
stops turning. When a transmission-type parking brake doesn’t seem to be
performing properly, have a professional check it.

Chapter 14: It’s the Brakes!

If you have rear disc brakes on your car,
it may incorporate a parking brake that
works like a mini-drum brake attached to
the rear wheels (see Figure 14-13). Most
parking brake systems for vehicles with
rear disc brakes, however, employ the
disc brake itself. Vehicles with disc
brakes on both front and rear wheels 
use a cable to activate their parking
brakes. You can see how it all hooks up
in Figure 14-14.
Figure 14-14: A cable activates the parking brake system 
on some rear-wheel disc brakes.
Anti-Lock Braking Systems (ABS)
Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) are designed to prevent skidding and
enable you to keep steering control of your vehicle until you can stop safely.
This system also often shortens the distance your vehicle takes to stop and
can prevent the tire damage that would result if you had to stop with the
wheels locked.
ABS comes in two types: two-wheel and four-wheel. Some light trucks and
vans have a two-wheel anti-lock braking system on the rear wheels that main-
tains directional stability. Although the front wheels can still lock up, the
vehicle continues to move in a straight line. With just enough pressure
applied to the brake pedal, the driver can control the steering. You find 
four-wheel anti-lock braking systems on other light trucks and most cars.

These prevent all four wheels from locking up, which enables you to maintain
steering ability in emergency stopping situations. If no impending lockup
occurs, the ABS stays in standby mode.
How ABS works
Here’s how an anti-lock brake system operates: A microprocessor called an
anti-lock brake computer monitors the speed of each wheel with an electronic
component called a speed sensor. When you apply firm pressure to the brake
pedal, the system triggers electronic solenoids to trap or release hydraulic
pressure to each wheel independently, thousands of times faster than if you
pumped the brake pedal as you would with ordinary brakes. You can usually
hear this happening and feel the brake pedal pulsing when the system ener-
gizes. While the system is working, it’s important to keep your foot pressed
firmly on the pedal until the vehicle stops.
Do not pump your brake pedal if your vehicle has ABS. Instead, use firm pres-
sure on the brake pedal, keep steering, and let the microprocessor do the
work for you.
If the anti-lock system has a problem, a warning light on the dashboard
comes on and normal braking without anti-lock takes over. So if your amber
anti-lock light illuminates, remember that you still have normal brakes. Just
pump them and steer in the proper direction as though you’d never heard of
ABS. And be sure to get the ABS fixed as soon as possible!
What ABS doesn’t do
ABS can’t prevent all skids, nor does it always stop your vehicle in a shorter
distance. Although ABS does help you maintain steering, your vehicle may
not turn as quickly on a slippery road as it would on dry pavement. A combi-
nation of excessive speed, sharp turns, and slamming on the brakes can still
throw an ABS-equipped vehicle into a skid. On roads covered with loose
gravel or freshly fallen snow, the locked wheels of a vehicle without ABS can
build up a wedge of gravel or snow and stop faster than an ABS-equipped
vehicle. Therefore, it’s important to keep a safe distance between your vehi-
cle and the one in front of you and to try to maintain a constant speed rather
than jamming on the brakes at the last minute.
When you drive a new vehicle with ABS, it’s a good idea to know what the
brakes feel like when they’re operating normally. Find an empty parking lot on
a rainy or snowy day and slam on the brakes, noticing how your vehicle
responds. Keep your foot firmly on the pedal and get a feel for steering while
the brakes operate. Then you’ll know what to expect in a panicky situation.
Chapter 15 shows you how to check your anti-lock braking system; a profes-
sional must do adjustments and repairs.
261
Chapter 14: It’s the Brakes!

Other Electronic Braking Systems
Because the brake system is such a vital feature of every vehicle, the technol-
ogy for creating safer and more responsive systems is constantly developing.
Newer electronic braking systems now exist that provide additional advan-
tages, often coupled with ABS. The following sections cover two that are in
production now.
Brake Assist (BA)
Brake Assist (BA) is like having a superhero in the car to save you in an emer-
gency. It keeps an electronic eye on how you’re braking, and if you suddenly
get into an emergency and have to stop short, BA automatically boosts the
power of the brakes to help you. When you’re out of trouble and take your
foot off the brake, the system automatically does so too and resumes its 
surveillance.
Originally offered as an option on high-end vehicles, often as part of a 
“pre-collision” package, BA is becoming available on more vehicles as the
cost of the system goes down. You often find it combined with EBD, which 
I cover next.
Electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD)
First popular on luxury vehicles and some SUVs, electronic brakeforce 
distribution (EBD) ensures that braking power is distributed proportionately
among all the wheels. If a vehicle carries a heavy or unequally distributed
load, ordinary brake function can be skewed to one area of the vehicle, caus-
ing it to pull to one side or even sending it into a skid. To ensure stability,
EBD automatically distributes the force of the brakes proportionately to all
the wheels so that the vehicle can stop safely.
Regenerative braking systems that literally generate power to drive hybrid
vehicles are discussed in Chapter 10. If you haven’t read that chapter on
alternatively powered vehicles yet, you’re gonna love it!

anti-lock braking systems (ABS). This chapter provides instructions for per-
forming preventive maintenance on your brakes and doing checkups that
help you to spot trouble before it occurs. If you need professional work done,
this chapter also provides tips that enable you to deal with an auto mechanic
or brake specialist knowledgeably.
If you haven’t read Chapter 14, or if you’ve forgotten what you read, please go
back and review it before continuing with this chapter. Before you can trou-
bleshoot or work on your brakes, you must be familiar with how the system
on your vehicle works, what its principal parts do, and what should be hap-
pening when you step on the brake pedal.
Although you can probably do most of the work in this chapter yourself, if
you want to do major brake work, you should do it under supervision. If you
don’t get things back together properly, you risk losing much more than you
gain! However, if after reading this chapter you simply can’t stand the idea of
exposing your brakes to a total stranger, get yourself to a good community
auto class at a local high school or dealership and do the work under an
instructor’s watchful eye. In such a setting, you have access to the hydraulic
hoists, brake lathes, and other expensive equipment needed to do a really
good job. So even if you’re sure that you need no further instruction after
reading my enlightened and crystal-clear prose, having the equipment and
the instructor’s expertise available is still worth the price of enrollment.

Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Checking Your Brake System
It’s best to start by going over the brake system in your vehicle and checking
each part for wear and proper performance. If it’s safe for you to do the nec-
essary work, I tell you how to do it in this section. If you need professional
help, I tell you what the work should probably entail so that you don’t end up
paying more than is necessary.
Check your brakes every 10,000 to 20,000 miles, depending on your vehicle’s
age, type, braking system, and how much stop-and-go driving you do. If you
tend to ride your brakes, they get more than normal wear and should be
checked more frequently. If it’s taking longer, your vehicle pulls to one side,
or your brakes squeal when you try to stop, check them immediately. (After
one of those breathtaking emergency stops on the freeway, I always say
“Thanks, pals” and promise myself that I’ll peek at my brakes and brake lines
soon and make sure that they’re in good shape.)

Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 
Extending the life of your brakes
The best way you can “be a buddy to your
brakes” is to extend their lifespan. You’re also
doing yourself a favor, and not just because
repairing and replacing brakes is expensive:
These techniques will help your brakes help
you live longer, too!
 Riding your brakes (keeping your foot on the
brake pedal when you drive) causes them
to wear out prematurely. The excess heat
also can warp brake rotors and brake
drums.
 Although being cautious is always a good
policy, try to anticipate stopping situations
well enough in advance to be able to slow
down by releasing the pressure on your gas
pedal and then using your brake pedal for
that final stop. In slippery conditions or sit-
uations that call for slowing down rather
than stopping, if you have traditional brakes,
instead of jamming on your brakes and
screeching to a halt, pump your brake pedal
to reduce speed and avoid sliding. If the
road is slippery and your vehicle is
equipped with ABS, don’t pump the brake
pedal; simply apply firm, steady pressure
and keep steering.
Maintaining the speed limit so that you don’t
have to stop at every light also increases
fuel efficiency, which reduces not only your
expenses but also global warming! You can
find more fuel-saving tips in Chapter 26.

Use extreme caution when checking vehicles with anti-lock braking systems
(ABS). Some ABS are pressurized by an electric pump, and there may be
more than 2,000 psi pressure in certain parts of the system! The “Checking
Anti-Lock Brakes” section in this chapter tells you what you can do and what
should be done by a professional.
Checking your brake pedal
If you’re like most people, you’re usually aware of only one part of your brake
system: the brake pedal. You’re so familiar with it, in fact, that you can proba-
bly tell if something’s different just by the way the pedal feels when you step
on the brakes.
To check your brake pedal, you simply do the same thing you do every time
you drive: You step on the pedal and press it down. The only difference is
that you should pay attention to how the pedal feels under your foot and
evaluate the sensation. The following steps tell you what to feel for:
1. Start your engine, but keep it in Park with the parking brake on. (If
your vehicle doesn’t have power brakes, it’s okay to do this check
with the engine off.)
2. With the vehicle at rest, apply steady pressure to the brake pedal.
Does it feel spongy? If so, you probably have air in your brake lines.
Correcting this problem isn’t difficult; unless your brakes have ABS or
other sophisticated brake systems, you can probably do the job yourself
with the help of a friend. The “Bleeding Your Brakes” section later in this
chapter tells you whether you can bleed the system on your vehicle and
provides instructions for doing the job.
Does the pedal stay firm when you continue applying pressure, or 
does it seem to sink slowly to the floor? If the pedal sinks, your master
cylinder may be defective, and that’s unsafe.
3. Release the parking brake and drive around the block, stopping every
now and then (but without driving the people behind you crazy).
Notice how much effort is required to bring your vehicle to a stop. With
power brakes, the pedal should stop 1 to 11⁄2 inches from the floor. (If you
don’t have power brakes, the pedal should stop more than 3 inches from
the floor.)
If your vehicle has power brakes and stopping seems to take excessive
effort, you may need to have the power booster replaced.
4. If you feel that your brakes are low (meaning that the pedal goes
down too far before the vehicle stops properly), pump the brake pedal
a couple of times as you drive around.
265
Chapter 15: Be a Buddy to Your Brakes and Bearings

If pumping the pedal makes the car stop when the pedal’s higher up,
either a brake adjustment is in order or you need more brake fluid.
Check the brake fluid level by following the instructions in the next sec-
tion, “Checking your master cylinder.”
If the level of brake fluid in the master cylinder is low, buy the proper
brake fluid for your vehicle (see “Flushing and Changing Brake Fluid”
later in this chapter for tips) and add fluid to the “Full” line on your
master cylinder. Check the fluid level in the cylinder again in a few days.
If it’s low again, check each part of the brake system, following the
instructions in this chapter, until you find the leak, or have a brake spe-
cialist find it and repair it for you.
If you find that you’re not low on fluid, drive carefully to your friendly
service facility and ask them to remedy the situation. When they’ve
worked their magic, the pedal shouldn’t travel down as far before your
vehicle stops.
Disc brakes self-adjust and should never need adjusting. Drum brakes
also have self-adjusting devices that should keep the drum brakes prop-
erly adjusted. If any of the self-adjuster components on drum brakes
stick or break, the drum brakes won’t adjust as they wear out, resulting
in a low pedal. Chapter 14 tells you more about self-adjusting devices.
5. As you drive around, notice how your total brake system performs,
and ask yourself these questions:
• Does the vehicle travel too far before coming to a stop in city
traffic? If it does, either your brakes need adjusting or you need
new brake linings.
• Does the vehicle pull to one side when you brake? On vehicles
with front disc brakes, a stuck caliper and brake fluid leak can
cause this problem. On vehicles with front drum brakes (antiques),
a wheel cylinder may be leaking or stuck, or the brake shoes may
be wear-ing unevenly. I explain how to check disc and drum brakes
in the section “Getting at Your Brakes” later in this chapter.
• Does your brake pedal pulsate up and down when you stop in a
non-emergency situation? A pulsating brake pedal usually is
caused by excessive lateral run-out (mechanic-speak for wobbling
from side to side), which causes a variation in the thickness of the
discs. This can happen because your brakes are overheating from
overuse.
ABS brakes sometimes pulsate when you need them to stop
quickly, so don’t confuse that with a braking problem (read
“Checking Anti-Lock Brakes” at the end of this chapter). Make sure
that your rear brakes are working; if not, they could be causing
your front brakes to work too hard and overheat.
266
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

• Does your steering wheel shake when you brake? If it does and
you have disc brakes, your front brake discs need to be profes-
sionally machined or replaced.
• Do your brakes squeal when you stop fairly short? The squealing
is a high-pitched noise usually caused by vibration. Squealing can
occur when the brake linings are worn and need replacement, the
brake drum or disc needs to be machined, the front disc brake
pads are loose or missing their anti-rattle clips, the hardware that
attaches the brake calipers is worn, or inferior brake linings are 
in use.
Properly functioning disc brakes are sometimes a little noisy, and
totally eliminating a squeal can be difficult. When you open your
brakes to check them, make sure that your brake discs or drums
aren’t badly scored or worn and that plenty of lining material is
left. Also, the brake pads on disc-type brakes should fit properly
into the caliper. Some disc brake pads require special shims to
eliminate squeal.
• Do your brakes make a grinding noise that you can feel in the
pedal? If so, stop driving immediately and have your vehicle towed
to a brake repair shop. Further driving could damage the brake
discs or drums. Grinding brakes are caused by excessively worn
brake linings; when the lining wears off, the metal part of the
brake pad or brake shoe contacts the brake disc or drum and can
quickly ruin the most expensive mechanical parts of the brake
system.
• Does your vehicle bounce up and down when you stop short?
Your shock absorbers may need to be replaced. Chapter 16 has
information about shock absorbers.
Never put off brake work. If any of the checks in this chapter show that you
have a problem, take care of the situation immediately. If your brakes fail, 
you (and other people) may be in serious trouble. Other kinds of automotive
trouble may keep your vehicle from moving, but brake trouble keeps it from
stopping. The rest (and you) may be history.
Checking your master cylinder
Brake fluid is stored in the master cylinder. When you step on the brake
pedal, fluid goes from the master cylinder into the brake lines; when you
release the pedal, the fluid flows back into the master cylinder. Essentially,
when you check your master cylinder, you’re making sure that you have
enough brake fluid.
267
Chapter 15: Be a Buddy to Your Brakes and Bearings

If your vehicle has ABS, consult your owner’s manual before checking the
master cylinder. Failure to do so may result in under- or over-filling the reser-
voir. And remember that some ABS are under extreme pressure and should
be handled professionally.
To check the brake fluid in your master cylinder, follow these steps:
1. Open the brake fluid reservoir on top of your master cylinder.
If you have the kind with a little plastic bottle on top, just unscrew the
cap on the little plastic bottle that sits on top of the master cylinder 
(see Figure 15-1). (Some master cylinders have a cap for each chamber.)
If you have a metal reservoir, use a screwdriver to pry the retaining
clamp off the top (also shown in Figure 15-1).
Don’t let any dirt fall into the chambers when you open the lid. If your
hood area is full of grime and dust, wipe the lid before you remove it.
Figure 15-1: Unscrew the plastic reservoir cap (a) or use a screwdriver to release the lid on
your master cylinder (b).
2. Take a look at the lid.
Attached to the inside surface of the lid is a protective diaphragm with
rubber cups (see Figure 15-2). As the brake fluid in your master cylinder
recedes (when it’s forced into the brake lines), the diaphragm cups are
pushed down by air that comes in through vents in the lid. The cups
descend and touch the surface of the remaining brake fluid to prevent
evaporation and to keep the dust and dirt out. When the fluid flows back
in, the cups are pushed back up.

Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

If your brake fluid level is low, or if 
the cups are in their descended posi-
tion when you remove the lid, push
them back up with a clean finger
before you replace the lid.
If the cups seem very gooey or can’t
be pushed back to their original posi-
tion, the wrong brake fluid may have
been used. Because some power
steering fluid reservoirs are the 
same shape as the brake fluid reser-
voirs in master cylinders, there have
been cases where power steering 
fluid was accidentally installed in the
master cylinder. If this happens,
everything but the steel brake lines
must be rebuilt or replaced, includ-
ing the master cylinder!
3. Look inside the master cylinder.
The brake fluid should be up to the “Full” line on the side of the cylinder
or within 1⁄2 inch of the top of each chamber. If it isn’t, buy the proper
brake fluid for your vehicle and add it until the level meets the line.
Be sure to read the “Flushing and Changing Brake Fluid” section in this
chapter to ensure that you buy the proper kind of brake fluid. Also
remember to close the brake fluid reservoir as quickly as possible so
that oxygen or water vapor in the air doesn’t contaminate the fluid. And
try not to drip it on anything — it eats paint!
A low brake fluid level may not mean anything if it’s been a long time
since any fluid was added and if your vehicle has been braking properly.
If you have reason to believe that your brake fluid level has dropped
because of a leak, use this chapter to check the rest of your system very
carefully for leaks.
4. If both chambers of your master cylinder are filled with brake fluid to
the proper level, close the master cylinder carefully, without letting
any dirt fall into it.
If dirt gets into your master cylinder, it will travel down the brake lines.
If it doesn’t block the lines, the dirt will end up in your wheel cylinders
and damage your brakes.
5. Brake fluid evaporates easily, so don’t stand around admiring the
inside of your master cylinder. Close it quickly, and be sure that the
lid is securely in place.
269
Chapter 15: Be a Buddy to Your Brakes and Bearings
Figure 15-2: Rubber cups inside the lid
of a master cylinder.

Because most master cylinders are pretty airtight, you shouldn’t lose
brake fluid in any quantity unless it’s leaking out somewhere else. If your
fluid level was low, you’ll find the cause as you continue to check the
system.
6. Use a flashlight or work light to look for stain marks, wetness, or gunk
under the master cylinder and on whatever is in its vicinity.
If your master cylinder is — or has been — leaking, you’ll see evidence
of it when you look closely.
It’s a good idea to check your master cylinder at least every couple of 
months — more often if it was low in fluid when you last checked it. This 
task is part of the regular under-the-hood check that I describe in Chapter 2.
Checking your brake lines
If the fluid level in your master cylinder remains full (see the preceding sec-
tion), chances are that you don’t need to check for leaks in the brake lines
that carry the fluid to each wheel cylinder. However, if you find that you’re
losing brake fluid, or if the inner surfaces of your tires are wet or look as
though something has been leaking and streaking them, it could be a leak in
the wheel cylinders or the brake lines — or a visit from a neighbor’s dog!
The easiest way to check brake lines is to put the vehicle up on a hydraulic
hoist, raise it over your head, walk under it, and examine the lines as they
lead from the hood area to each wheel. Leaks may be coming from holes in
the lines where the steel lines become rubber ones or where the brake lines
connect with the wheel cylinders.
If you don’t have access to a hoist at the auto repair class at your local
school or at a friendly garage, you have to jack up your vehicle, one end at a
time, and get down on the ground with a flashlight or work light to look at
your lines. Before you do so, be sure to check Chapter 1 for instructions and
safety tips on jacking up your car!
To check your brake lines, do the following:
1. Check carefully along the brake lines for wetness and for streaks of
dried fluid.
2. If you see rust spots on your lines, gently sand them off and look for
thin places under those spots that may turn into holes before long.
3. Feel the rubber parts of the brake lines for signs that the rubber is
becoming sticky, soft, spongy, or worn.
270
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

Your brake lines should last the life of your vehicle. If they look very
bad, have a professional take a look at them and tell you whether they
should be replaced. If the vehicle is fairly new and the brake lines look
very bad, go back to the dealership and ask them to replace the lines
free of charge.
4. Look at the inner surfaces of your tires for drippy clues about leaking
wheel cylinders.
Getting at Your Brakes
Checking your brakes to see whether they’re in good condition isn’t as scary
as it sounds; in fact, it’s quite simple — with two qualifications: Don’t fiddle
with anything unless I tell you to, and be sure to disassemble the stuff that
covers your brakes in the proper manner so that you don’t have trouble
reassembling it. For details on this foolproof technique, see the section in
Chapter 1 called “How to Take Anything Apart — and Get It Back Together
Again.”
Keep the following in mind for any major work your brakes may need:
 Don’t attempt to replace brake shoes or discs, linings, or wheel cylin-
ders yourself unless you do so under the eye of an auto shop instruc-
tor. If you choose to go this route with proper supervision, the money
you save more than pays for your tuition! The job is neither difficult nor
complicated. It just needs supervision.
 If you’d rather have the work done for you, find a reliable brake spe-
cialist rather than taking your vehicle to the corner garage. If you have
an exotic system, go to your dealership. If not, get an estimate from the
dealership, and then have the mechanic at your local service station rec-
ommend a brake specialist or try the yellow pages or the Internet to
locate brake shops in your area. Call a couple of places and ask for esti-
mates on rebuilding your brakes. Eliminate the cheapest place as well
as the most expensive! Chapter 22 is filled with advice on finding good
service facilities and dealing with them successfully.
Things to do and not to do 
when working on brakes
Here are a couple of “nevers” to remember when working on your brakes.
Doing any of these things can cause serious damage and huge headaches:
271
Chapter 15: Be a Buddy to Your Brakes and Bearings

 Never step on your brake pedal when you have the brake drum off
your brakes. The pistons can fly out of the ends of the wheel cylinders
because the drum won’t stop the brake shoes from moving outward. (If
this makes no sense to you, Chapter 14 tells you how wheel cylinders
work.)
 Never use anything but the correct brake fluid in your brakes.
 Never get oil anywhere near your brake system. Oil rots rubber and
will destroy the cups in the master cylinder reservoir and the dust boots
on your wheel cylinders. If it gets on your brake linings, they won’t
grab the brake drum.
 Never get brake fluid on a painted surface. Brake fluid will destroy
the paint.
 Never remove wheel cylinders or brake shoes, or tamper with the self-
adjusting device on your brakes, without supervision.
Now, here’s what you can do: Most modern vehicles either have disc brakes
on the front wheels and drum brakes on the rear wheels or disc brakes all
around. Your owner’s manual should tell you what the configuration is on
your vehicle. When you know, follow the instructions in the following sec-
tions that deal with the type of brakes on your vehicle.
When you check your brakes, check one of your front brakes first because
the linings wear faster on the front brakes than on the rear ones. If the first
set of brakes you look at seems to be in good condition, and if your vehicle
has been braking properly, there’s probably no need to check the other three.
Just remember to check the other front wheel first the next time. If your
brakes haven’t been behaving properly, check each set of brakes until you
find the culprit.
Before you start to check your brakes, scan the instructions later in this
chapter (including the “Checking and Packing Wheel Bearings” section) to be
sure that you have the necessary tools and products on hand. You don’t want
any last-minute surprises when your vehicle is up on jack stands with at least
one wheel off! If you’re unfamiliar with the tools you need for the job, see
Chapter 3 for descriptions.
I provide separate sections for checking and reassembling drum brakes and
checking disc brakes, so just read the ones that relate to the type of brakes
you have. The section on checking and packing wheel bearings applies to
both drum and disc brakes, but if you have disc brakes, do these jobs only
under supervision at an auto class.
272
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

A front-wheel drive vehicle doesn’t conform exactly to the following descrip-
tion. You can still check the brakes, but you can’t repack the wheel bearings.
Brakes in vehicles with ABS and other brake-related safety systems are
linked to sophisticated electronic control systems and have wheel speed 
sensors mounted on the axles near the brakes, so if your brakes don’t feel
right, see the brake specialist at your dealership or a reliable brake shop.
Checking drum brakes
As you can see in Figure 15-3, you 
have to remove a bunch of stuff to 
get to a drum brake. The steps in this
section explain how to do so and 
what to look for when you finally get
to your brakes.
Arrange to do this work in a well-
ventilated area, wear an inexpensive
but protective paper mask, and be
very careful not to inhale the dust
from the brake drum. If you have an
older vehicle, it probably contains
asbestos. If you get asbestos in your
lungs, you run the risk of serious 
lung disease. Even asbestos-free 
brake dust is nasty stuff when 
inhaled.
Follow these steps to check drum brakes:
1. Jack up your vehicle.
For instructions, see Chapter 1. Be sure to observe safety precautions
with that jack!
Brake drums are classified as either hubbed or floating (hubless).
Hubbed drums have wheel bearings inside them; floating drums simply
slide over the lug nut studs that hold the wheels on the vehicle.
2. If you have a hubbed drum, pry the grease cap off the end of the hub
using a pair of combination slip-joint pliers (see the tool in Chapter 3)
and lay the grease cap on a clean, lint-free rag.
If you have a floating drum, skip Steps 3 through 7 and just slide the
drum off the hub.

to get at your drum brakes.

You sometimes need to strike floating drums with a hammer to break
them loose from the hub.
3. Look at the cotter pin that sticks out of the side of the castellated nut
or nut-lock-and-nut combination.
Notice in which direction it’s placed, how its legs are bent, how it fits
through the nut, and how tight it is. If necessary, make a sketch.
4. Use a pair of needle-nosed pliers to straighten the cotter pin and pull
it out.
Put it on the rag that you’re using to hold all the parts you’ve taken off,
and lay it down pointing in the same direction as when it was in place.
5. Slide the castellated nut or nut-lock-and-nut combination off the 
spindle.
If it’s greasy, wipe it off with a lint-free rag and lay it on the rag next to
the cotter pin.
6. Grab the brake drum and pull it toward you, but don’t slide the drum
off the spindle yet; just push the drum back into place.
The things that are left on the spindle are the outer wheel bearings and
washer.
7. Carefully slide the outer bearing, with the washer in front of it, off the
spindle.
8. Whether or not you want to repack your wheel bearings, check them
now by following the instructions in the “Checking and Packing Wheel
Bearings” section later in this chapter. Then resume with Step 9.
As long as you’re removing your bearings, you should check them for
wear. If they’re packable, it’s a good idea to repack them while you have
everything apart. (All this task involves is squishing wheel-bearing
grease into them, a wonderfully sensual job.)
9. Carefully slide the drum off the spindle, with the inner bearings
inside it.
Inhaling brake dust can make you seriously ill. For safety’s sake, never
attempt to blow away the dust with compressed air. Instead, put your
mask on and saturate the dust completely by spraying the drum with
brake parts cleaner according to the instructions on the can. Wipe the
drum clean with a rag; then place the rag in a plastic bag and dispose of
it immediately.
10. Take a look at the inside of the drum.
274
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

You can probably see grooves on the
inner walls from wear. If these grooves
look unusually deep, or if you see hard
spots or burned places, ask your ser-
vice facility to let you watch while
they check out the drums with a
micrometer (see Figure 15-4). If the
drums aren’t worn past legal toler-
ances (0.060 of an inch), they can be
reground (or turned) rather than
replaced. A special machine called a
brake-lathe does this job in a relatively
short amount of time. It shouldn’t be a
major job in terms of expense. You
could do it yourself, under supervi-
sion at a school auto shop; most classes have the machine.
If you need new drums, have a professional install them for you because
the brake shoes must be adjusted to fit. Make sure that the shop orders
drums for your exact make, model, and year and that they specify drums
for front or rear wheels. Brake drums must also be replaced with drums
of the same size for even braking performance. The new drums should
look exactly the same as your old ones.
11. Look at the rest of your brakes, which are still attached to the brake
backing plate (see Figure 15-5).

Figure 15-4: Checking drum wear with a
micrometer.

Here are the parts you should look at, what you should find, and what to
do if they need to be repaired or replaced:
• Wheel cylinders: The wheel cylinders should show no signs of
leaking brake fluid. If they’re leaky, consult a brake shop.
• Brake shoes and linings: These should be evenly worn, with no
bald spots or thin places. The brake lining should be at least 1⁄16
inch from the steel part of the brake shoe or 1⁄16 inch from any rivet
on brake shoes with rivets, preferably more. The linings should be
firmly bonded or riveted to the brake shoes. Most brake shoes and
linings are built to last for 20,000 to 40,000 miles; some last even
longer. If yours have been on your vehicle for some time, they’ll
have grooves in them and may be somewhat glazed.
If your brake drums have been wearing evenly and your vehicle
has been braking properly, disregard the grooves and the glazing
unless your linings look badly worn. If your linings are worn, have
them replaced at once. This job involves replacing the brake shoes
with new ones that have new linings on them. For even perfor-
mance, always replace brake shoes in sets (four shoes for two
front or rear wheels is a set). Replacing them all at once is even
better.
If your brake shoes need to be replaced, remember that almost all “new”
brake shoes are really rebuilt ones. When your brake shoes are
replaced, your old brake shoes are returned to a company that removes
the old linings, attaches new ones, and resells the shoes.
12. Take a look at the self-adjusting devices on your brakes. (Figure 15-5
shows one of the most common self-adjusters.) Trace the cable from
the anchor pin above the wheel cylinder, around the side of the back-
ing plate, to the adjuster at the bottom of the plate.
Is the cable hooked up? Does it feel tight? If your brake pedal activates
your brakes before it gets halfway down to the floor, the adjustment is
probably just fine. If not, and if the cylinders, linings, shoes, and so on
are okay, the adjusting devices may be out of whack. Making a couple of
forward and reverse stops should fix them. If this approach doesn’t
work, you may need a professional to adjust them. Don’t attempt to
fiddle with these parts yourself.
Reassembling drum brakes
After you finish inspecting your brakes, you’re ready to reassemble every-
thing. Refer to Figure 15-3 to make sure that you get everything back in the
proper order and direction. The following steps tell you how:
276
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

1. As you did with the drums (see the previous section), saturate the dirt
on the brake backing plate with brake parts cleaner; then wipe it off
with a clean, grease-free rag.
Don’t blow the dust around — it can cause serious lung damage.
2. Wipe the dirt off the spindle and replace the wheel hub and brake
drum on the spindle. If you have a floating drum, skip Steps 4 through 8
and slide the drum back over the lug nut studs until it contacts the hub.
Be gentle so that you don’t unseat the grease seal.
3. If you haven’t already cleaned the inside of the drum, spray it with
brake cleaner and wipe it out with a grease-free rag.
4. Replace the outer wheel bearing (smaller end first) and the washer.
Don’t let any dirt get on these parts!
5. Replace the adjusting nut by screwing it on firmly and then backing it
off half a turn and retightening it “finger tight.”
Another way to complete this step is to back the adjusting nut off one full
notch (60 degrees) and, if the notch doesn’t line up with the hole in the
spindle, back it off just enough until it does. Then spin the wheel by hand
to be sure that it turns freely. If it doesn’t, loosen the nut a bit more.
6. Insert the cotter pin into the hole in the castellated nut.
The cotter pin should clear the outer grooves and go all the way
through. Make sure that it’s pointing in the same direction as it was
when you took it off (refer to your sketch if you made one in Step 3 of
the previous section).
7. Bend the legs of the cotter pin back across the surface of the nut to
hold it in place.

9. Follow the instructions in Chapter 1 to replace your wheel, lug nuts,
and hubcap, and lower the vehicle to the ground.
10. Don’t try to detoxify the contaminated rags you used on this job by
laundering them! Place them in a sealable plastic bag, zip it closed,
and dispose of it immediately.
Checking disc brakes
Today, most vehicles have four-wheel disc brakes. Others have disc brakes
on the front wheels and drum brakes on the rear wheels.
277
Chapter 15: Be a Buddy to Your Brakes and Bearings

You should check disc brakes 
(see Figure 15-6) and disc brake
linings every 10,000 miles — 
more often if your brakes sud-
denly start to squeal or pull to 
one side, or if your brake pedal
flutters when you step on it.
Don’t confuse the fluttering
with the normal pulsing of ABS
brakes when they’re applied in
an emergency stop.
When you check your disc
brakes, measure the thickness
of the linings on the pads so
that you can tell whether the
linings on your brakes are
badly worn. If the lining is
down to the thickness of the
steel backing plate, the pads
should be replaced.
To check disc brakes, follow these steps:
1. Jack up your vehicle and remove a front wheel.
You can find instructions for how to do this safely in Chapter 1.
2. Look at the brake disc (also called a rotor), but don’t attempt to
remove it from the vehicle.
The brake caliper has to be removed before you can remove a brake
disc, and the good news is that there’s no need to do so. If you’re work-
ing alone, just check the visible part of the disc for heavy rust, scoring,
and uneven wear. Rust generally is harmless unless the vehicle has been
standing idle for a long time and the rust has really built up. If your disc
is badly scored or worn unevenly, have a professional determine
whether it can be reground or needs to be replaced.
3. Inspect your brake caliper (the component blocking your view of the
entire brake disc).
Be careful. If the vehicle has been driven recently, the caliper will be hot.
If it’s cool to the touch, grasp it and gently shake it to make sure that it
isn’t loosely mounted and its mounting hardware isn’t worn.
4. Peek through the inspection hole in the dust shield on the caliper and
look at the brake pads inside (refer to Figure 15-6).
If the linings on the brake pads look much thinner than the new ones
you saw at the supply store or dealership parts department, they proba-
bly have to be replaced. If the linings have worn to the metal pads, the
disc probably has to be reground or replaced as well.

5. Follow the instructions in Chapter 1 to replace your wheel, lug nuts,
and hubcap, and lower the vehicle to the ground.
If the disc and pads seem to be in good condition and your brake pedal
doesn’t flutter when you step on it, you don’t need to do anything else.
Relining, caliper maintenance, and disc grinding should be left to a profes-
sional unless you do the job under supervision at an auto class.
Checking and Packing Wheel Bearings
As you can see in Figure 15-7, wheel bearings usually come in pairs of inner
and outer bearings. They allow your wheels to turn freely over thousands of
miles by cushioning the contact between the wheel and the spindle it sits on
with frictionless bearings and lots of nice, gooey grease. This grease tends to
pick up dust, dirt, and little particles of metal, even though the bearings are
protected to some extent by the hub and the brake drum or disc.
Usually, only the non-drive wheels (that is, the front wheels on rear-wheel
drive vehicles and the rear wheels on front-wheel drive vehicles) have
repackable wheel bearings. Vehicles with front-wheel drive have sealed front
bearings, but some have packable rear ones. The bearings on four-wheel
drive vehicles are quite complicated and should be repacked professionally.
Before you check your bearings, consult your owner’s manual or dealership
to find out whether the bearings on your vehicle are sealed. If they are, you
can’t repack them.
 If you have drum brakes, it’s important to check the bearings when
you check your brakes to make sure that the grease hasn’t become
fouled. If it has, the particles act abrasively to wear away the very con-
nection the bearings are designed to protect, and the result is a noisy,
grinding ride. In extreme cases, you could even lose the wheel! If the
bearings look cruddy, either repack them yourself or get a professional
to do it.
 If you have disc brakes, you have to remove the caliper to get at the
bearings. Although this task isn’t terribly difficult, certain aspects of the
job can create problems for a beginner. Because your brake system can
kill you if it isn’t assembled properly, I strongly suggest that if you want
to do it yourself, you do the job under supervision at an auto class.
If you don’t want to — or shouldn’t — check your bearings right now, try the
process I outline in the later section “A quick way to tell whether your bear-
ing’s wearing.” If they are, have your wheel bearings repacked immediately. If
you need other brake work, have it done at the same time so that you don’t
have to pay for any duplicate labor involved.
279
Chapter 15: Be a Buddy to Your Brakes and Bearings

Inspecting and repacking 
your wheel bearings
If you have disc brakes and you have to remove the caliper to get the disc
off the spindle in order to get at the inner bearings, I think that you should
inspect and pack them only under supervision at an auto class or under the
eye of an experienced mechanic. It’s not a difficult job; it’s just that you may
not get the calipers back on right, which could cause your brakes to malfunc-
tion. Otherwise, if you have drum brakes, go right ahead and do the job
yourself. Figure 15-7 gives you a detailed look at what you’ll encounter. Follow
these steps to repack your wheel bearings:
1. If you have drum brakes
and your bearings aren’t
sealed, to get at the bear-
ings follow the instructions
in the earlier section
“Checking drum brakes.”
When you get to Step 7,
where you slide the outer
wheel bearings off the spin-
dle, return to this section.
2. If you haven’t already done
so, carefully slide the outer
bearing, with the washer in
front of it, off the spindle.
As you can see in Figure 15-7,
the bearings are usually
tapered roller bearings, not
ball bearings.
3. Take a good look at the
grease in the spaces
between the bearings. Don’t
wipe off the grease!
If the grease has sparkly 
silver slivers or particles in it,
or if the rollers are pitted or
chipped, you must replace 
the bearings. If the outer 
bearings are damaged, the
inner bearings probably are,
too. In this case, either
replace the bearings in an

auto class under the instructor’s guidance or have a repair facility do the
job for you.
4. If you don’t intend to repack your outer bearings at this time but you
want to continue your inspection, don’t attempt to wipe any grease off
them, no matter how icky they look.
Just put them in a little plastic bag and lay them on your rag, pointing in
the right direction. The bag will keep dust from getting into them. A
speck of dust can wear out a bearing quickly.
If you do intend to repack your outer bearings, clean them thoroughly
in solvent or kerosene with an old paintbrush. Don’t smoke when
cleaning the bearings!
You need to get rid of all the old grease in order to inspect the bearings
properly. Also, when you repack the bearings with fresh grease, you
don’t want any old grease spoiling the new stuff.
5. When the bearings are shiny and clean, rinse them off with water and
dry them, or use brake cleaner to remove the solvent.
If you pack new grease over the solvent, the grease will dissolve and
you’ll ruin your bearings.
6. When the bearings are clean and dry, look at the rollers for signs of
wear.
If the rollers are gouged or bluish in color, or if you can almost slip the
rollers out of their place, replace the bearing and its race, which is
pressed into the hub. You can see the race in Figure 15-7.
7. To repack the outer bearing,
take a gob of wheel-bearing
grease (which is different from
most chassis-lube grease) and
place it in the palm of your left
hand (if you’re a righty).
You may want to invest in a pair
of thin, disposable plastic gloves
for this job. However, there’s
something kind of nice about
fresh, clean grease, and if you
use gloves, you miss one of the
more sensual aspects of getting
intimately involved with your
car. In any event, hand cleaner
gets the grease off easily.
8. Press the bearing into the gob of
grease with the heel of your
other hand (see Figure 15-8).
281
Chapter 15: Be a Buddy to Your Brakes and Bearings
Figure 15-8: How to pack bearings with your
bare hands.

Doing so forces the grease into the bearing and out the other end. Make
sure that you work the grease into every gap in the bearing. You want it
to be nice and yucky. Then put your bearing down on your clean rag.
Another set of bearings is in the center hole of the drum or disc. These
are your inner wheel bearings. At this time, you have to decide whether
you’re going to remove the inner bearings to check and pack them. The
following will help you decide whether to remove the inner bearings:
• You can’t remove the inner bearing from its seat in the hub
unless you have a new grease seal for it. So if you’re just check-
ing on this occasion, leave the inner bearings alone until you’re
sure from the condition of the outer bearings that repacking is in
order.
• Generally speaking, if the outer bearings look okay, the inner
ones are okay, too. Just check each wheel and put everything back
according to the instructions for reassembling drum brakes earlier
in this chapter.
9. If you’re not planning to repack the inner bearings, do not attempt to
take them out of their seat in the drum or disc. Skip Steps 10 through
13 and continue with Step 14.
If you are repacking the inner bearings, slide the brake drum or disc
toward you, with the inner bearings still in place, but do not slide the
drum completely off the spindle. Instead, screw the adjusting nut
back in again, pull the drum toward you, and push it back.
The adjusting nut should catch the inner bearing and its grease seal and
free them from inside the hub.
10. Clean and pack the inner bearings using the technique described in
Steps 5 through 8.
11. Take a rag and wipe out the hole in the hub of the drum where the
inner bearing was; then take a gob of grease and smooth it into the
hole.
Be sure that the grease fills the races inside the hub where the bearing
fits. Wipe off excess grease around the outside of the hole so that it
doesn’t fly around when the car’s in motion, possibly damaging your
brakes.
12. Insert the inner bearing into the hub with the small end first. Take the
new grease seal and spread a film of grease around the sealing end
(the flat, smooth side).
13. To fit the new grease seal into place properly, slide it in evenly; 
otherwise, it will bend or break and you’ll lose your grease.
282
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

Find a hollow pipe or a large socket from a socket wrench set that has
roughly the same diameter as the seal. With the flat, smooth side of the
seal toward you, place the seal in the hub opening, and use the pipe or
socket to move it into the hub gently and evenly. The new seal should
end up flush with the outside of the hub or slightly inside it.
14. Return to the earlier sections “Checking drum brakes” or “Checking
disc brakes.”
You’ll be glad to know that your rear wheels have no wheel bearings to pack
(unless your vehicle has front-wheel drive and the manual says that you can
repack the rear bearings). You do have axle bearings, but you must replace
these if they wear out; you can’t repack them.
If your vehicle is quite old and you hear a clicking or grinding noise from the
vicinity of your rear wheels, have these bearings checked and replaced if nec-
essary. It’s easier to hear worn axle bearings when you drive down an alley
or a narrow driveway because the noise echoes loudly.
A quick way to tell whether 
your bearing’s wearing
If you just want to check your wheel bearings for wear without removing the
wheels, do the following:
1. Jack up your vehicle and support it on jack stands.
If you’ve been checking your brakes, your car is already jacked up; if
not, instructions in Chapter 1 show you how to do this task safely.
2. Without getting under the vehicle, grasp each wheel at the top and
bottom and attempt to rock it.
There should be minimal movement. Excessive play may indicate that
the wheel bearing is worn and needs adjustment or replacement.
3. Put the gearshift in Neutral if you have an automatic transmission,
or take your manual transmission out of gear.
4. Rotate the wheel, listening for any unusual noise and feeling for any
roughness as it rotates, which may indicate that the bearing is dam-
aged and needs to be replaced.
5. Shift back into Park (for an automatic transmission) or gear (for a
manual transmission) before lowering the vehicle to the ground.
283
Chapter 15: Be a Buddy to Your Brakes and Bearings

Flushing and Changing Brake Fluid
After checking your brake system, if you find that you have a leak or you
have to bleed your brakes (see the section “Bleeding Your Brakes” for more
information), you’ll have to restore the brake fluid in your master cylinder
to its proper level. Here are some things that you should know about buying
and using brake fluid:
 Always use top-quality brake fluid from a well-known manufacturer.
Many vehicles call for either D.O.T. 3 or D.O.T. 4 fluid. D.O.T. 5 is now
available, too; it’s a great improvement because it doesn’t eat paint or
absorb moisture. The downside is that because D.O.T. 5 doesn’t absorb
it, water that gets into your brake system can form little pools that can
corrode your brakes.
Sometimes the type of brake fluid you should use is listed on the master
cylinder reservoir cover or cap. If not, check your owner’s manual or ask
the service department at your dealership for the proper type for your
vehicle.
 Exposure to air swiftly contaminates brake fluid. The oxygen in the air
oxidizes it and lowers its boiling point. Brake fluid also has an affinity for
moisture, and the water vapor in the air can combine with the brake
fluid, lowering its boiling point and, in cold weather, forming ice crystals
that make braking difficult. Adding fluid contaminated with water vapor
to your brake system can rust the system and create acids that etch
your wheel cylinders and master cylinder and foul your brakes, causing
them to work poorly — or not at all. It can also destroy vital parts of
ABS and other expensive braking systems.
If you’re just going to add brake fluid to your system, buy a small can of
the correct type, add the fluid to your master cylinder, and either throw the
rest away or use it only in emergencies. The stuff is pretty cheap, and your
vehicle shouldn’t need more fluid after you fix a leak. If you keep a can
with only a little fluid left in it, the air that fills up the rest of the space in
the can contaminates the fluid no matter how quickly you recap it.
 Keep brake fluid away from painted surfaces — unless it’s D.O.T. 5, 
it eats paint. (If this stuff seems scary, remember that the same state-
ments can be made about turpentine and nail polish remover.)
You should flush and replace the fluid in your brake system every two years.
Service facilities now do this with brake flushing machines. If you want to do
it yourself, follow these steps:
1. Use a cheap, plastic turkey baster to remove the old, dirty fluid from
the master cylinder reservoir.
2. Use a lint-free cloth to wipe out the reservoir — if you can get in there.
284
Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

3. Pour new brake fluid into the reservoir just until it reaches the “Full”
line, replace the cap on the reservoir, and then follow the steps in the
next section, “Bleeding Your Brakes.”
As you bleed the brakes, the new fluid pushes the old fluid out of the
system. Continue to bleed the brakes until you see clean, clear fluid exit-
ing the bleeder screw.
Bleeding Your Brakes
If your vehicle has squishy-feeling brakes, the way to get the air out of the
lines is to bleed the brakes. To do the job, you need either a brake bleeder
wrench or a combination wrench that fits the bleeder nozzle on your vehicle,
a can of the proper brake fluid, a clean glass jar, and a friend.
To avoid getting air into the actuator of ABS, EBD, BA, or other sophisticated
brake systems, a professional should bleed the brakes for you.
Follow these steps to bleed your brakes:
1. Find the little nozzle
called a brake bleeder
screw (see Figure 15-9)
that’s located behind
each of your brakes.
Reaching this bleeder
screw may be easier if you
jack up the vehicle (see
Chapter 1 for instructions
and safety tips). If you’re
going to crawl underneath,
lay down an old blanket or
a thick layer of newspa-
pers first. If you really
want to be comfortable,
beg or borrow a creeper to
lie on and slide around
with easily (I describe
creepers in Chapter 3).
2. Special wrenches called
bleeder wrenches fit the
bleeder screw and can
prevent rounding the
screw’s hex-head. Find 
the proper wrench or
socket that fits the screw, and loosen the screw.

Figure 15-9: Using a bleeder hose to bleed your

Be careful not to break the screw off or you’ll need professional repairs.
If it’s stuck, spray some penetrant like WD-40 around the screw. After
you loosen the screw, tighten it again (but not too tight).
3. If you have a small piece of flexible hose that fits over the end of 
the bleeder screw, attach it and place the end of the hose in the 
jar. Then fill the jar with brake fluid to cover the end of the hose 
(see Figure 15-9). If you don’t have anything that fits over the bleeder
screw, just keep the jar near the nozzle so that any fluid that squirts
out lands in the jar.
4. Have your friend slowly pump your brake pedal a few times (see
Figure 15-10). Have your friend say “Down” when pressing the brake
pedal down and “Up” when releasing it.
If the vehicle is jacked
up, before you let your
friend get into it with
you underneath it, make
sure that the wheels are
blocked in the direction
in which the car would
roll and that it isn’t
parked on a hill. Leave
your tires in place so
that the vehicle will
bounce and leave you
some clearance if it
falls.
5. When your friend has
pumped the pedal a few
times and is holding the pedal down, open the bleeder screw.
Brake fluid will squirt out (duck!). If there’s air in your brake lines, air
bubbles will be in the fluid. Seeing these bubbles is easiest if you’re
using the hose-in-the-jar method, but you can also see them without it.
6. Before your friend releases the brake pedal, tighten the bleeder
screw.
If you don’t, air is sucked back into the brake lines when the pedal is
released.
7. Tell your friend to release the pedal, and listen for him or her to say
“Up.” Then repeat Steps 2 through 6, loosening the screw and tighten-
ing it again and again until no more air bubbles come out with the
fluid.
8. Open your master cylinder and add more brake fluid until the level
reaches the “Full” line.

Figure 15-10: How to bleed your brakes.

If you neglect to do so, you run
the risk of draining all the fluid
out of the master cylinder and
drawing air into the lines from
the top. If that happens, you have
to go back and bleed your master
cylinder until you suck the air out
of that end of the system. Who
needs the extra work?
If you goof and have to bleed the
master cylinder, it’s the same
deal as bleeding your brakes
(friend and all). Just bleed it at
the point where the brake lines
attach to the cylinder or at the
master cylinder’s bleeder nozzle
if you have one (see Figure 15-11).
9. Repeat Steps 2 through 8 with
each brake until the air is out of
each brake line. Don’t forget to
add brake fluid to the master
cylinder after you bleed each
brake.
10. After you finish the job and bring the brake fluid level in the master
cylinder back to the “Full” level for the last time, drive the vehicle
around the block.
The brake pedal should no longer feel spongy when you depress it. If it
does, check the master cylinder again to be sure that it’s full, and try
bleeding the brakes one more time (this situation isn’t unusual, and it
doesn’t take as long as it sounds).
If you know that no air is left in the brake lines but the brakes still don’t feel
right, you may need a new master cylinder. Unless you have one of the few
Japanese vehicles that integrate the ABS actuator in the master cylinder, you
should definitely consider installing it yourself — at an auto class. All it
involves is disconnecting the old master cylinder (a bolt or two and the hoses
leading to the brake lines), removing it without spilling brake fluid on anything
painted, installing the new one, filling it with brake fluid, and bleeding it. If your
vehicle has ABS, the new fluid is pumped through the actuator as well as the
master cylinder when you bleed the system, using up a bit more brake fluid
than bleeding a non-ABS system, so plan ahead and buy an extra can or two.
If the job seems like too much of a hassle, have a professional do the work.
You shouldn’t have to pay for much labor, and if you choose a brake shop
wisely, the whole deal shouldn’t cost too much. Whatever you do, just be
sure that when the job is finished, they (or you) bleed the brakes and the
master cylinder to get all the air out of the lines.

When I bought Tweety Bird, my first car, I had her master cylinder replaced
professionally for about $60. (It would cost sooo much more now!) A few
months later, I helped a friend replace a master cylinder with a rebuilt one.
The rebuilt master cylinder cost about half of what I’d paid for a new one,
and there were no labor charges (naturally). What are your time and trouble
worth to you?
Adjusting Your Parking Brake
These instructions for adjusting your parking brake work only if you have
drum brakes on your rear wheels. If you have a manual transmission, you
may have a transmission-type parking brake, which should be adjusted 
professionally, and parking brakes on rear-wheel disc brakes should be left to
professionals, too. Your service manual may tell you which kind you have, or
you can crawl under the vehicle and see for yourself. (Chapter 14 describes
both integral and transmission-type parking brakes and shows you what they
look like.) Because most people have integral parking brakes, that’s the type I
deal with in this section. Figure 15-12 shows you several types of integral park-
ing brakes. They may look different, but you adjust them all the same way.

Part III: Staying Cool and In Control 

You shouldn’t have to pull or push the parking brake handle to the most
extreme level to make the brake work. (As the cables loosen up, you have to
pull the handle up higher to engage the brake.) Also, you shouldn’t be able to
drive the vehicle with the parking brake on. If you can, the brake needs to be
adjusted or repaired.
To adjust your parking brake, do the following:
1. Jack up the car (a hoist would be lovely) and make sure that it’s
secure (see Chapter 1 for instructions). Be sure to leave your parking
brake off.
If you don’t want to jack the car up, you can slide underneath it armed
with a work light.
2. Trace the thin steel cables that run from each of your rear wheels
until they meet somewhere under the backseat of the vehicle.
Where they meet there should be a device (usually a bar and a screw)
that controls the tension. Compare what you find with the parking
brakes in Figure 15-12 to see which type you have. If you can’t find the
system on your vehicle in that illustration, you probably need profes-
sional help.
3. Turn the screw (or whatever else you have) until the cables tighten
up, and then tighten the screw nuts to hold the screw in place.
You may have to hold the cable to keep it taut (the illustration at bottom
left of Figure 15-12 shows you how).
4. Get out from under the vehicle and test-drive it to see whether the
parking brake is working.
5. Pay attention to whether the parking brake warning light on your
dashboard comes on when the parking brake is engaged. If it doesn’t,
check or replace the bulb or fuse.
You can find instructions for checking fuses in Chapter 6. If changing the
bulb or fuse doesn’t work, get someone to check the connection
between the warning light and the brake; there may be a short in it.
Checking Anti-Lock Brakes
Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) vary from one vehicle to another, and 
most require no special maintenance. (Chapter 14 tells you how ABS brake
systems work and how to operate them properly.) Manufacturers install a
warning light — usually yellow or amber in color — in the instrument panel
that, under normal circumstances, goes on briefly during engine startup and
turns off in a short amount of time. If it goes on while you’re on the road, the
ABS system isn’t working properly and your vehicle is using only the normal
brake system. In this case, get the ABS repaired as soon as you can.
289
Chapter 15: Be a Buddy to Your Brakes and Bearings

If you want to test the operation of your anti-lock brakes, find an empty park-
ing lot on a rainy day. While traveling on a slippery surface at about 30 mph,
with no obstacles in front of you, firmly press the brake pedal. You should
hear some clicking and feel some pulsing of the brake pedal while the vehi-
cle comes to a stop without sliding. If the warning lamp stays on, or if you
suspect that the ABS isn’t working properly, take your vehicle to a profes-
sional who specializes in brake systems.

E
xcept for the steering wheel, you probably consider the steering and 
suspension systems on your vehicle to be unknown territory, and up until
now, you’ve probably been content to leave it that way. But these systems are
the unsung heroes that smooth out the driving process and keep you headed
exactly where you want to go. This chapter can help you get a good idea of
how the type of steering and suspension your vehicle possesses works so that
you can deal intelligently with a technician if something goes wrong.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
The Steering System
The steering system consists of a series of linkages and gears that link the
driver to the wheels. On most vehicles only the front wheels turn in response
to the steering wheel, while the back wheels just follow along. When you
make a turn, each of the front wheels has to turn at a different angle because
one wheel is closer to the direction you’re turning in than the other one is
(think of the “snap the whip” game).
There’s a difference between how far you turn your steering wheel and how
far the wheels of your vehicle turn during one rotation of the steering wheel.
This is called the steering ratio. The more you have to turn the steering
wheel to get the wheels to respond, the higher the steering ratio. To find the

steering ratio, you divide one complete rotation of the steering wheel (360
degrees) by the amount of degrees the wheels turn. The steering ratio in
most cars is between 12 and 20:1. For example, if the wheels on your car turn
20 degrees during one rotation of the steering wheel, the steering ratio would
be 18:1 (360 divided by 20).
The steering linkage
The steering linkage is composed of all the parts of the steering system that
connect the steering wheel to the front wheels (see Figure 16-1). When you
turn your steering wheel, the steering linkage causes your front wheels to
respond by moving in the proper direction. The principal parts of the steer-
ing linkage are the tie rod ends, ball joints, and control arms.
Figure 16-1: A rack-and-pinion steering system.
Tie rod ends
As you can see in Figure 16-1, the tie rod ends are a type of ball socket assem-
bly located where the steering linkage connects to the wheels. As the two
parts of the linkage move against each other, the grease in the tie rod ends
cushions them. The grease keeps the parts moving freely and prevents fric-
tion that would wear them away.

The steering linkage actually connects to the wheels, which are held in place
by a spindle that goes through the wheel and is attached to one or two con-
trol arms, or steering arms that allow the wheels to turn in any direction. To
keep things moving freely, ball joints are located at points where movement
takes place.
Ball joints
Ball joints are important parts of the steering systems on all vehicles. A ball
joint is a ball socket assembly that attaches the steering knuckle to the 
suspension system. The ball joint allows for pivotal and rotational move-
ment of the wheel as it moves up and down and is steered left to right. You
can see where ball joints are located in Figures 16-6, 16-10, and 16-15, which
show various configurations.
Some steering system components are filled with grease to cut down on fric-
tion and keep the parts they protect from wearing away prematurely. In the
past, these components needed the grease replenished at regular intervals.
Almost all of today’s vehicles (with the exception of a few SUVs, trucks, and
specialty vehicles) have lifetime lubrication systems that are designed to oper-
ate for the life of the vehicle without the need for additional lubrication.
Power steering systems
When power steering was first introduced, it was intended to help drivers
of large or heavy vehicles to steer more easily when parking or heading
around curves. Then it became a luxury option for passenger vehicles. Today,
virtually every vehicle on the road comes equipped with a power steering
system. This section describes the most popular types of power steering.
Three types of power steering systems are in use today, or are scheduled to
make their appearance in a very short time: rack-and-pinion, recirculating-ball,
and steer-by-wire. The following sections take a closer look at each of them.
Rack-and-pinion steering
Rack-and-pinion steering is found on most modern passenger vehicles (refer
to Figure 16-1). The pinion is a gear that connects to the shaft of the steering
wheel. The rack has notches cut in it that engage the teeth on the pinion gear.
Each end of the rack connects to an inner and outer tie rod, which connect
to the control arm, which connects to the spindle on the wheel at that side of
the vehicle. As the steering wheel turns, the gear turns, moving the rack,
which moves the tie rods, which cause the wheels to turn.
A rotary valve senses whether the driver is turning the steering wheel or just
driving straight ahead. It does this via a steering shaft that connects to the
295
Chapter 16: Steering and Suspension Systems Smooth the Way

steering wheel at one end and to the pinion gear at the other. As the steering
wheel turns, the torsion bar twists, and the pinion gear responds accordingly.
Rack-and-pinion power steering is powered in two basic ways. Other steering
systems described in this chapter may work on the same principles, but the
clearest way to view them is to relate them to rack-and-pinion systems:
 Hydraulic power steering systems incorporate a power-steering pump
that’s connected to the engine by a belt wrapped around a pulley (see
Figure 16-2). As vanes inside the pump turn in response to the speed of
the engine, they force power-steering fluid under hydraulic pressure into
a piston located at the center of the rack. As you can see in Figure 16-2,
the hydraulic piston has an opening on either side of it that allows the
fluid to enter. The direction in which the steering wheel is turned forces
the fluid into one side of the piston or the other. This causes the piston
to move the rack in that direction, which moves the tie rods and the
wheels accordingly.

 Electronic power steering systems, also called electronically assisted
steering, use an electric motor or motors instead of hydraulics to drive
the steering mechanism (see Figure 16-3). An ECU controls the operation
of the system. If the electronic system fails, the rack-and-pinion system
continues to operate as unassisted (or unpowered) steering.

Recirculating-ball steering
Another type of steering system most often found on trucks and SUVs is
called recirculating-ball steering because it features a recirculating-ball gear
(see Figure 16-4). The outer part is a block that has a hole in it and gear teeth
on the exterior. A rod with threads at one end screws into the threads inside
the hole. The threads in the rod are filled with ball bearings that reduce fric-
tion between the threads in the rod and the threads in the hole and keep the
rod moving firmly in place.
The rod is connected to the steering wheel at the other end. When you turn
the steering wheel, it turns the rod, which turns the block it’s screwed into.
The gear teeth on the outside of the block move the wheels in whatever
direction the block is turning in response to the steering wheel. If the system
is power assisted, the power-steering pump sends hydraulic fluid under
higher pressure to one side of the block or the other, depending on which
way the steering wheel is turned.

Steer-by-wire
Steer-by-wire is a new and innovative steering system that’s controlled elec-
tronically. It senses the direction, force, and speed with which the driver is
turning the steering wheel and conveys that information to a motorized steer-
ing system. Figure 16-5 shows a prototype steer-by-wire system. Because this
system eliminates the pumps, hydraulic lines, pulleys, and other mechanical
gizmos that connect the steering wheel to the wheels in rack-and-pinion and
recirculating-ball systems, it steers more smoothly, frees up room under the
hood, reduces the possibility of mechanical failure, lightens the weight of the
car, and increases fuel economy. Such a deal!
Figure 16-5: Steer-by-wire.
Checking your steering
Checking your steering is easy. Just stand outside your vehicle, near the door
on the driver’s side. Stick your hand through the open window and move 
the steering wheel, with your eye on the left front tire. If you can move the
steering wheel at all before the tire starts to move, then you need to have
both your steering and alignment checked. There should be no “play” in the
steering wheel before the signal is transmitted to the tires.

As you drive your car, be alert to signs that it isn’t handling as easily as
before. If the vehicle seems to have a mind of its own and begins to resist you
on turns (and when you’re pulling out of turns), take a good look at your tires
for signs of wear caused by misalignment.
Suspension Systems
Underneath your vehicle are the main elements of the suspension system,
which supports the vehicle and keeps the passenger compartment relatively
stable on bumpy roads. This section deals with the most important parts
involved in these systems and then with the major types of suspension sys-
tems. Figure 16-6 shows you a typical suspension system.

Major parts of the suspension system
You’ll understand the different types of suspension systems best if you’re
familiar with the major parts involved.
Control arms
Control arms are sometimes referred to as A arms, A frames, I arms, or links
(look ahead to Figure 16-15). Ever hear the term multi-link suspension? It
means that more than one link is holding the wheel to the frame or body.
Stabilizer bars
Stabilizer bars (see Figure 16-7) are designed to prevent a vehicle from
swaying and lurching on sharp curves and turns and when the wheels are
traveling over uneven ground (a better solution than the legendary mountain
goat that had shorter legs on one side than on the other for traveling along
slopes!). These stabilizers (or anti-sway bars) also improve high-speed stabil-
ity. Most vehicles have a front stabilizer bar and some also have a rear stabi-
lizer bar. The stabilizer connects one side of the suspension to the other
through the frame. As your car begins to dip on one side, the stabilizer bar
restricts that side’s movement, depending on the diameter of the bar. Larger-
diameter stabilizers restrict more than smaller ones do. More and more modern
vehicles are offering stability control systems that perform more efficiently.
Chapter 19 tells you how these work.

Springs
Springs are the core of the suspension system. Various types of springs are
used to carry the weight of the vehicle and keep it off the tires, absorb the
bumps, and keep your car at its proper trim height. These can be leaf springs,
coil springs, torsion bars, or air springs (see Figure 16-8). Most cars use
either coil or leaf springs; SUVs use coil springs, torsion bars, or leaf springs. 
Figure 16-8: Coil springs, leaf springs, torsion bars, and air springs.
Here’s a rundown of each type of spring:
 Leaf springs, still found on pickup trucks and pickup-based SUVs, are
usually made up of several relatively thin metal plates, called leaves,
piled one on top of the other. The reason for using these layers instead
of one thick metal bar is that, as a bar bends, the top of the bar has to
stretch a little. Unlike a single, thick bar, which, if bent too far, would
split from the top down, leaf springs are more flexible; each leaf bends
independently, and the leaves can slide on one another instead of break-
ing (see Figure 16-9).

Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

Figure 16-9: Leaf springs bend but don’t
break because they can slide flexibly on one
another.
Each end of a set of leaf springs
is attached to the frame at the
rear of the car with fittings that
allow the springs to bend and
move freely. These fittings usu-
ally have rubber bushings that
allow the fittings to bend and
twist freely; they also absorb
some of the vibration and pre-
vent it from reaching the pas-
senger compartment.
 Coil springs look like old-
fashioned bed springs. They’re
usually found at the front of the
car, although they can be at
both the front and the rear. At
the front end, coil springs also
help cushion the bumps, vibra-
tions, and steering movements.
Front coil springs can sit on
either the upper or lower con-
trol arms. They’re cushioned
by ball joints (see Figure 16-10).

At the rear, they’re often suspended between control arms that have
rubber bushings. Figures 16-10, and 16-16 through 16-18 show the loca-
tion of coil springs on a variety of suspension systems. If the coil springs
are making noise, you may be able to lube them with spray-on grease at
the points where they connect at the top and bottom. However, I recom-
mend that you check with the service department at your dealership
before undertaking the job yourself.
 Torsion bars are used mainly in SUVs and trucks. They’re located at the
front of the vehicle, connected at one end to a control arm. What they
connect to at the other end differs from one vehicle to another. (Figures
16-10 and 16-11 show some configurations.) Torsion bars twist to accom-
modate differences in the load that the vehicle may be carrying, which
allows the front wheels to move up and down freely. Think of torsion bars
as coil springs that didn’t get wound into a spiral.
Figure 16-11: Torsion bars provide stability.
 Air springs are usually found on luxury vehicles. A rubber air spring can
be filled with the right amount of compressed air to control the ride and
maintain the proper height. With this type of system, a computer moni-
tors the ride height and signals an onboard air compressor to pump
more air into the air springs when weight is added to the vehicle. When
the weight is removed, the computer turns on an exhaust solenoid to let
air out of the air springs (refer to Figures 16-8 and 16-12).
Usually, there’s nothing to lubricate with air springs. But check with the
dealer to find out whether it’s okay to apply a rubber conditioner to the
air bags to prevent them from wearing out prematurely.

Figure 16-12: How air springs work.
Shocks and struts
Shock absorbers and MacPherson struts (see Figures 16-13 and 16-14) do
most of the work of protecting the passenger compartment from bumps. One
or the other is located near each wheel. The way they cut down on vertical
movement is interesting. When a wheel hits a bump, the wheel tends to keep
bouncing up and down long after the bump has been left behind unless the
movement is controlled. The bouncing effect is due to the inflated rubber 
tire on the wheel and also to the fact that a coil spring that’s pulled or 
compressed doesn’t just snap back into its former shape but keeps moving
up and down for some time afterward. Shock absorbers and struts allow the
springs to compress freely and to return or rebound slowly — like the door
check on a storm door that opens quickly and easily but closes gently.

Figure 16-13: Standard shock absorbers.
Here are some points to keep in mind regarding your shocks and struts:
 Shock absorbers that are faulty or worn increase tire wear and can
cause you to lose control of the steering if you go over bumps and
dips at high speeds.
 There are a couple of ways to tell whether your vehicle needs new shock
absorbers. One is by leaning heavily on a fender or placing your weight on
a bumper and then releasing it suddenly, watching to see whether the vehi-
cle returns slowly to its original position. If the vehicle continues to bob up
and down, you need new shocks. Another way is to stop fairly short. If
your car dips up and down a couple of times before coming to rest, you
need new shocks if your vehicle has them. If it doesn’t, a professional
should troubleshoot the suspension system to identify the problem.
 MacPherson struts do more than shock absorbers do. Both shocks and
struts control the ride, but a strut is also a structural member of the sus-
pension system.
 Electromagnetically adjustable shocks contain a hydraulic fluid
whose viscosity can be altered by electromagnetic current. Sensors
determine how stiff or soft the shocks need to be. Some are driver-
controlled by a switch in the cabin that usually offers “sport” and 
“comfort” settings, and sometimes “tow” or “load” settings, as well.
Although replacing standard shock absorbers isn’t hard, the job can be brutal
because you have to jack up your vehicle and crawl under it. Unless you can
replace them under supervision on the lift at an auto class, I strongly recom-
mend having a professional do it for you.
306
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 
Figure 16-14: A MacPherson strut.

Within limits, you have a choice as to the type of shocks you use on your
vehicle: “Heavy-duty” shocks provide a slightly harder ride; other shocks
may not do as well with the entire family and two Great Danes in the car, but
they give a softer ride. Some shocks even provide automatic level control for
vehicles that carry loads ranging from very heavy to almost weightless. Suit
yourself.
Types of suspensions
Several types of suspension systems have been developed to make riding in
your vehicle safer and more comfortable. Most cars have independent front
suspension systems in which each front wheel is attached separately and 
can move independently of the others. Some vehicles also have independent
rear suspensions, hence the term four-wheel independent suspension. Older
rear-wheel drive vehicles and many of today’s trucks use a dependent type
of rear suspension that incorporates the rear drive-axle assembly.
Traditionally, double-wishbone suspensions and strut suspensions have been
the most common suspension systems found on consumer vehicles. But air
suspensions are becoming more popular, and electromagnetic suspensions are
coming into play.
Double-wishbone suspension
Double-wishbone suspension systems use a shorter upper control arm and
a longer lower control arm that hold the wheel to the frame. The control
arms allow the wheel to move up and down, kind of like a hinge allows a door
to swing open and closed. The lower arm is larger because it bears most of
the load when the vehicle moves up and down. There are rubber bushings
at the inboard end of the control arms, and a ball joint at the outboard end
of the control arm allows the wheel to rotate and pivot (see Figure 16-15).

Chapter 16: Steering and Suspension Systems Smooth the Way

Multi-link suspension
Multi-link suspension (see Figure 16-16) is a more sophisticated version of
double-wishbone suspension, and it comes in a variety of configurations. The
main advantage of all of them is greater flexibility that enhances a vehicle’s
ability to adjust to changes in driving conditions on the road. Although multi-
link suspension systems still have “wishbones,” each of the arms connect to
the spindle separately rather than as one solid unit. As a result, each can
pivot independently in response to the movement of the steering wheel.
Figure 16-16: Multi-link suspension.
Strut suspension
There are two types of strut suspensions: conventional and modified (see
Figures 16-17 and 16-18). Conventional struts have the coil spring wrapped
around the strut cartridge, and modified strut suspensions have a remotely
mounted spring. Strut suspensions use no upper control arm. The upper
strut mount is what holds the wheel in place. You can find more information
about different types of shocks and struts in the earlier section, “Shocks and
struts.”

Air suspension systems
Air suspension is found on some luxury cars and SUVs. It employs air-filled
bags or tubes controlled by sensors that determine when the suspension
needs to be softened or stiffened and pumps air into them or lets air out of
them accordingly. Some air suspension systems are controlled by the driver,
whereas others are automatic.
Bose acoustic suspension
Bose acoustic suspension is a product of the same company that builds
those sensitive and expensive sound systems and earphones. By applying
acoustic technology Bose has come up with a unique suspension system that
represents a major automotive advance. Instead of conventional springs,
shock absorbers, or hydraulics, Bose suspension employs an electromagnetic
motor at each wheel. As the movement of the vehicle compresses and expands
the system, amplifiers send electricity to boost the power at each of the
wheel motors, enabling them to adjust the suspension much faster than con-
ventional systems can. This sophisticated and sensitive system of controlling
the motion of each wheel enables the rest of the vehicle to remain level when
the driver steps on the accelerator or the brake pedal or makes a sharp turn,
and it virtually eliminates vibrations in the passenger compartment. Bose
expects to have this system available — at least on high-end vehicles — by
2009. Hopefully, as has happened with other significant advances in automo-
tive technology that have enabled vehicles to operate more efficiently and
safely, the system will swiftly become more widely available.

I
f you think about tires only when it’s time to buy new ones, you need to
think again. The right tires in the right condition can enhance your driving
experience and make it safer. In fact, your brakes and your tires have a two-
way relationship: Poor braking action results in increased tire wear, but prop-
erly balanced and aligned wheels and properly inflated tires in good
condition can help stop your car up to 25 percent faster!
Worn tires can cause your vehicle to skid or hydroplane in wet weather even
if the treads aren’t down to the legal tolerances. So checking your tires can
save your life! There’s also a strong correlation between tire inflation and tire
wear. If your tires are underinflated, the outer treads wear out faster. If your
tires are overinflated, the centers of the tread areas go. And if the wheels 
get out of alignment, your tires can wear out in as little as one day of hard
driving! So, to get more mileage from your tires plus better braking action and
a smoother, quieter ride, you ought to know a bit about buying, checking, and
maintaining the tires on your vehicle.
In this chapter, I tell you about the kinds of tires available. (You can buy dif-
ferent types and grades, and just as you wouldn’t wear your finest shoes to
the beach, you don’t want to put the most expensive, long-lasting, high-speed
set of tires on an old car that just goes back and forth to the shopping
center.) I also tell you how to check your tires and how to read your treads

for clues about how well your vehicle is performing — and how well you’re
driving. If these clues show that you need to have your tires and wheels bal-
anced or aligned or your tires replaced, I provide enough information for you
to be sure that the work is done the right way for the right price.
You don’t have to do much (in terms of physical labor) with this chapter, so
just find a comfortable place to read, relax, and enjoy. For information about
how to change a flat tire, see Chapter 1.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Tire Construction
Every tire has several major parts (see Figure 17-1). You find out more about
them in the next section, “The Secrets on Your Sidewalls, Revealed!,” which
decodes all the useful data molded into the sidewall of a tire. But to start,
here’s a brief description of each part:
 The sidewall is the part of the tire between the tread and the bead. It
keeps the air in, protects the components inside the tire, and keeps 
it stable.
 The tread is the part of the tire that gets most of the wear and tear. It
used to just be made of rubber (hence the phrases, “where the rubber
meets the road” and “burning rubber”). Today, the tread can be made
from natural rubber, synthetics, or both. The tread patterns help the tire
grip the road and resist puncturing. These patterns also are excellent
indicators of tire wear and have built-in treadwear indicators that let
you know when it’s time to replace your tires. I get into reading these
clues later in this chapter, in the section called — unsurprisingly —
“Checking your tires for wear.”
 The bead is a hoop of rubber-coated steel wire that’s shaped to help
hold the tire onto the rim of the wheel. Most tires have several beads
grouped into a bead bundle.
 The body of the tire is located beneath the tread and the sidewalls. It
helps the tire keep its shape when inflated instead of blowing up like a
balloon.
 The plies make up the body of the tire. They’re rubber-coated layers of
various materials (the most popular is polyester cord). The more plies,
the stronger the tire. The innermost belt is called a liner; it provides a
stable base for layering all the plies. High-speed tires sometimes have
cap plies on top of the regular ones to keep the plies and belts in place.
 The belts are located between the body and the tread. They provide
longer wear, puncture resistance, and more directional stability and are
312
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

usually made of rubber-coated steel. Belts also can be made of aramid
(which is harder than steel), fiberglass, polyester, rayon, or nylon. But
steel is the most popular type of belt material.
 The tire valve lets air into and out of the tire. The valve core prevents
air from escaping. Each valve should have a valve cap to keep dirt and
moisture from getting into the tire.
Figure 17-1: Anatomy of a tire.
For many years, tires came in a variety of constructions. There were bias-ply
tires that featured cords wrapped around the beads at overlapping angles.
These were superseded by bias-belted tires, which were constructed in the
same manner as bias-ply tires but featured belts of another material that
wrapped around the tires’ circumference. Today, all vehicles come fitted with
radial tires with belts that run at right-angles to the tread. Also available are
run-flat tires, puncture-proof tires, and other new types, which are covered
later in this chapter.
Radial tires have become the standard because they provide better handling,
especially at high speeds; they tend to grip the road more efficiently, espe-
cially when cornering; and they can deliver twice the mileage of bias-ply and
belted tires. Radial tires run cooler because they have less internal friction.
Wear varies; some high-performance cars with tire treads made of a relatively
soft compound that provides better road grip get only a few thousands miles
per set if driven hard. But for most vehicles, tires last from 25,000 miles and
up, depending on the belt material used. Top-of-the-line steel-belted radials
can last from 40,000 to as many as 100,000 miles under average driving condi-
tions. To decide what type of tire is right for your vehicle, see “Tips for
Buying Tires,” later in this chapter.

The Secrets on Your Sidewalls, Revealed!
Many people are willing to spend extra dollars for tires with names like
MACHO WILDCATS or TOUGH GUYS embossed in large white letters on the
sidewalls, but did you know that the wealth of information that is embossed
on those sidewalls in quiet little black letters can be more valuable in the
long run? And this information is free — if you know how to decode it. Even if
you’re not the inquisitive type, the data in the following sections can help
you when you buy and maintain tires. Figure 17-2 shows you all the different
types of codes you can find on the sidewall of a tire.
Figure 17-2: The secrets of your sidewalls, revealed!
Tire codes
Until around 1978, tire sizes were indicated by alpha-numeric codes, such as
D78-14. With the adoption of the metric system, the codes changed drasti-
cally, and now modern codes provide more information. Tire dealers are
required by law to have leaflets available that explain tire grades and ratings.
The leaflets also tell you which metric codes replace the old alphanumeric
designations. For example, here’s a breakdown of the information provided
by a common “P-metric” tire code, P215/65R15, as shown in Figure 17-2:
 P = Type of vehicle. In this case, P means passenger. Other codes
include LT for light truck and T for temporary or spare tire. Small pickup
trucks and RVs often come with P-rated tires because they aren’t
expected to carry heavy loads.

Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 
Adapted from the NHTSA (www.safercar.gov)

If you’re planning to do any heavy hauling, look for a vehicle equipped
with LTs. (Also check the load index information farther down this list.)
 215 = Tire section width. This is measured across the tread, from one
sidewall to the other, in millimeters. In this case, the tire width is 215
mm. Remember, the wider the tire, the higher the number.
 65 = Aspect ratio or tire series. This is the ratio of the tire’s sidewall
height to its width. In this case, the tire’s sidewall height is 65 percent 
of its width. Tires with a low aspect ratio (less than 70) are referred 
to as low-profile tires and usually are found on the touring tires or high
performance tires described in the later section “Passenger vehicles.”
 R = Tire type. For tire type, R means radial and LT means light truck.
Most tires on passenger vehicles are radials.
 15 = Diameter of the wheel. The diameter is measured in inches. In this
case, the diameter is 15 inches. Buying new wheels with larger diameters
(and 18- to 20-inch wheels aren’t uncommon these days) requires buying
new tires with diameters to match.
 89 = Load index. This number refers to how much weight the tire can
carry. This information is especially important if you carry heavy loads
(including several obese passengers), haul a lot of gear on camping
trips, or if you’re moving your kid to a college dormitory! There’s no law
that requires the manufacturer to put load index information on the
sidewall, but your owner’s manual may have it. If not, consult a tire
dealer.
 H = Speed rating. The speed rating of the tire is described in the next
section. Providing this information on the sidewall isn’t required by law.
 M+S or M/S = Mud and snow codes. If you live in or drive through areas
with extreme conditions, look for these codes on the sidewall.
Codes may differ slightly from one tire to another. In addition to the P-metric
code, there are European metric codes, which can be as simple as 155SR13 or as
complex as 185/70R14 88S, but the data they disclose is pretty much the same.
Speed ratings
Sometimes an additional letter appears between the load index and tire type,
such as P215/65R15 89H in Figure 17-2. The letter H refers to the speed rating,
which represents the safest maximum speed for the tire. It tells you nothing
about a tire’s construction, handling, or wearability but rather measures the
tire’s ability to dissipate heat so that it can endure the high temperatures that
high speeds create.
315
Chapter 17: How to Keep Your Car from Getting Sore Feet

Tires with the most common speed ratings, T and H, can go well over the
speed limit. They’re usually good buys because tires with higher speed ratings
are more durable. However, if you usually drive at low speeds on local streets
and rarely drive on the highway, the extra expense may not be worth it.
DOT identification and registration
The Department of Transportation (DOT) identification number on the side-
wall (refer to Figure 17-2) has a wealth of information. Here’s what the letters
and numbers of the DOT code mean:
 DOT indicates that the tire meets or exceeds United States Department
of Transportation safety standards.
 The next two numbers or letters identify the plant where the tire was
made.
 The next numbers or letters are marketing codes provided by the manu-
facturer. They serve as a registration number that identifies the tire in
case of a recall. (You can find more information on recalls in the later
section “Dealing with Defective Tires.”)
 The last four numbers are the week and year the tire was produced. For
example, 2408 would mean the tire was made during the twenty-fourth
week of 2008.
Be sure to check this code to see how old the tires on your vehicle really are!
In some cases, it can only be found on the inside sidewall, but it’s worth
getting down there with a flashlight. A 2008 exposé by ABC’s Underground
20/20 found that, despite the fact that tires over 6 years old could suffer
blow-outs that had resulted in a considerable number of fatal accidents,
supposedly new tires were for sale at tire dealerships and major chains
with codes showing that the tires were 12 years old or more! In 2008,
NHTSA ruled that this date code had to appear on the outside of the tire
where owners could easily check them on their own vehicles.
Under federal law, the dealer is required to put the tire’s DOT number and the
dealer’s name and address on a form that’s sent to the manufacturer. Although
tire outlets owned by manufacturers and certain brand-name outlets must

Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 
Here’s a list of what the most common speed rating letters mean:
 Q = 99 mph
 R = 106 mph
 S = 112 mph
 T = 118 mph
 U = 124 mph
 H = 130 mph
 V = 149 mph
 W = 168 mph
 Y = 186 mph
 ZR = Sometimes used for tires that
can go over 149 mph; always
used for tires that can go over
186 mph

Chapter 17: How to Keep Your Car from Getting Sore Feet
send them in to the manufacturer, independent tire dealers can simply fill out
the forms and give them to customers to mail to the manufacturer. For more
ideas about buying tires, see “Tips for Buying Tires” later in this chapter.
When you buy new tires, make sure that they’re properly registered. Unlike
guarantees and warranties, in case of a recall you aren’t eligible to receive
replacements unless your tires have been properly registered and you
respond to the recall within 60 days!
Tire quality grade codes
The Uniform Tire Quality Grading System (UTQGS) rates tires for treadwear,
traction, and temperature, but although the federal government requires that
ratings be determined on most passenger car tires, they’re set by tire manu-
facturers and not by an objective testing service. Personal driving habits,
type of vehicle, road conditions and surfaces, and tire maintenance all have a
huge impact on a tire’s longevity and performance.
To find the tire rating for tires required to use them (many light truck 
and SUV tires aren’t), go to www.safercars.gov/tires/pages/
TireRatings.cfm and enter the brand of tire that you’re interested in. 
You can then sort the tires by wear, traction, and temperature, all of which 
I describe in the next section. Your dealer also should have this information
on hand.
Look for the tire quality grades shown in Figure 17-2 on the sidewalls of the
tires on your vehicle or on stickers affixed to the treads of tires at a dealer-
ship. Here’s what they mean:
 Treadwear: This comparative number grade is based on carefully con-
trolled testing conditions. In the real world, a tire rated 200 would have
twice the treadwear of one rated 100 — if all other wear factors were
equal.
 Traction: This AA, A, B, or C grade represents the tire’s ability to stop on
wet pavement under controlled conditions (with AA being the best pos-
sible rating). The grades are based on straight-ahead braking only, not
on cornering or turning. The higher the grade, the shorter distance it
takes to stop the vehicle. A tire with a C grade just meets the govern-
ment’s test, whereas tires with B, A, and AA (in ascending order) exceed
government standards.
 Temperature: This A, B, or C grade represents heat resistance and the
tire’s capability to dissipate the heat if the tire is inflated properly and
not overloaded. Grade C meets U.S. minimum standards, while grades B
and A exceed government standards.

Other sidewall information
Check the sidewalls shown in Figure 17-2 and on your own vehicle for the fol-
lowing safety data:
 MAX LOAD: How much weight the tire can bear safely, usually
expressed in both kilograms (kg) and pounds (lbs)
 MAX PRESS: The maximum air pressure the tire can safely hold, usually
expressed in pounds per square inch (psi)
MAX PRESS is not the proper pressure to maintain in your tires! To 
find the amount of psi the tires should normally hold, look for the 
manufacturer’s recommended pressure for the best handling and wear on
the tire decal on the door, door pillar, console, glove box, or trunk of
your vehicle.
You can find instructions for checking tire pressure, reading treads for clues,
and other work that you can do on your tires in the “Caring for Your Tires”
section later in this chapter.
Types of Tires
As I explain earlier in this chapter, if you use the proper type of tires on your
vehicle, they will wear better, provide better traction, provide the best brak-
ing action, and are safer than the wrong tires. Here are some of the types of
tires that you may want to consider.
Passenger vehicles
The following types of tires are suitable for passenger vehicles, which include
everything except trucks and SUVs (covered in the following section), race
cars, construction equipment, and other specialized vehicles:
 Basic all-season tires are standard equipment on most popular vehicles
because they usually provide a comfortable ride and good treadwear.
The speed rating (see the “Speed ratings” section earlier in the chapter)
is usually T or H. If “M+S” is printed on the sidewall, the tire meets stan-
dards for mud and snow, but if you live in an area with really inclement
weather, you’ll probably need snow tires instead.
 Touring tires are generally more expensive than basic all-season tires and
can be found on sportier vehicle models because the tires are supposed
to handle better and grip the road at higher speeds in dry conditions.
Whether they’re worth the money depends on the individual product.
318
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

Touring tires have higher speed ratings, lower profiles (sometimes called
lower aspect ratios), and may not be as durable as all-season tires.
 Performance tires are designed for people who drive aggressively. They
perform better in terms of braking and cornering in dry conditions but
usually are noisier and wear out more quickly than all-season tires. They’re
usually speed-rated at least at H and have a wide, squatty, low profile.
 Ultra-high-performance tires have both the positive and the negative
aspects of performance tires to a greater degree: They go faster and
brake and handle better in both wet and dry conditions, but they ride
less comfortably and wear out even faster. They may have profiles as
low as 25 and usually are speed-rated V through ZR.
As a rule, low-profile tires such as touring tires and ultra-high-performance
tires may not be as durable as all-season tires because they’re more easily
damaged by potholes and other road hazards and are more sensitive to under-
inflation than tires with higher profiles. There also have been many reports of
damage to alloy wheels, especially the larger diameter, aftermarket wheels,
when low-profile tires are used because the tires don’t absorb as much of the
shock from bumps and potholes as do tires with higher profiles.
Tires for trucks and SUVs
SUVs, small pickup trucks, and vans may come with passenger-rated tires or
truck tires. What you need depends on where you usually drive and how
much you carry. Here are the categories for truck tires:
 Light-truck tires are intended for use on light trucks and SUVs. They
come in a variety of styles designed for normal conditions, driving on- or
off-road, or both. The thicker treads on the off-road variety offer better
traction on unpaved surfaces. Light-truck tires also vary for carrying
normal, heavy, and extra-heavy loads.
 Street/sport truck tires are pretty much the same as all-season tires
except that they have a sportier look and are supposed to handle better.
 Highway tires are useful if you drive a larger van or pickup truck
because they can carry heavier loads.
 Off-road tires have treads designed to deal with really difficult terrain.
Because they’re noisier and not as comfortable or fuel-efficient on paved
roads as street/sport or highway tires, forget these tires unless you
really plan to head for the hills or desperately want to project a more
macho image enough to pay bigger bucks for tires and fuel. However, a
compromise may be all-terrain off-road tires, which may not get you
quite as far off the beaten path but are more comfortable and quieter
than these heavy-duty beauties.
319
Chapter 17: How to Keep Your Car from Getting Sore Feet

 Snow tires may be better than all-season tires for driving in areas with
heavy snowfall or muddy roads. Their treads usually have wider grooves
and protuberances called lugs to provide better traction, but they’re
noisy, don’t handle as well on dry roads, and are generally less fuel-
efficient than all-season tires, so use them only when necessary.
Specialized Tire Systems
Some tires are so sophisticated that they require a special system to enable
them to communicate with the driver and/or other automotive systems. The
following tires and systems fall into this category.
Run-flat tires
Run-flat tires can be driven on without any air pressure inside the tire! This
means that you don’t face the stress and danger involved in having a blow-
out or changing a tire at the side of the road. Run-flats can be constructed in
two different ways:
 Self-supporting run-flat tires have stronger sidewalls to keep the tire
from collapsing if the air pressure inside the tire drops. Layers of rubber
and heat-resistant cord, and sometimes support wedges, are used in the
sidewall.
 The PAX system designed by Michelin allows you to drive up to 55 mph
for up to 125 miles with zero air pressure inside a tire! The system
includes a tire, a tire-monitoring system that measures the temperature
and the pressure of the air in the tire, and a wheel with a strong inner
ring that supports the tread if the tire loses half its air pressure. Unlike
most other tires, the system also features a special anchoring mecha-
nism that keeps the tire on the wheel if the air pressure in the tire drops.
Michelin claims that PAX system tires wear longer and get better fuel
economy than traditional tires because of reduced rolling resistance. If
the tread area is punctured, the tire can be repaired and the support ring
reused. You can read more about this system at www.michelinman.
com/difference/innovation/paxsystem.html.
Under normal circumstances, properly inflated run-flat tires should last the
same 30,000 to 40,000 miles as many ordinary tires. You can drive run-flat
tires with no air pressure in them for 50 to 125 miles at speeds up to 50 or 
55 mph without further damaging the tire. Although run-flats are durable,
running on them without air at high speeds for a long period can damage
them. Because the driver often can’t feel any difference when a run-flat goes
320
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

flat, automakers incorporate low-pressure warning systems to alert the driver
that a tire has lost pressure and to drive more slowly and get the tire repaired
as soon as possible to avoid further damage to the tire or wheel. See the next
section for more details on these warning systems.
Some run-flat equipped vehicles may not even come with a jack or spare tire!
Although run-flats are durable, there’s always the chance that one can be dis-
abled by a defect or accident, so if your vehicle lacks this equipment and has
room to carry it, I strongly suggest that you buy yourself a jack (see Chapter 3)
as well as a small, temporary spare tire in the correct size for the wheels on
your vehicle. By being prepared, you save yourself a tow and/or a long wait if
the dealership doesn’t have the proper tire in stock. Forewarned is forearmed!
Although you can have run-flat tires installed on a vehicle that didn’t come
with them, you also need to purchase a warning system designed for the new
tires, and if the rims on your current wheels aren’t sturdy enough to accom-
modate run-flats, you may have to replace those, too.
Also be aware that vehicles that come equipped with run-flats have suspension
systems that are tuned to the rigidity of the sidewalls. So if you replace the tires
on a vehicle with a standard suspension with run-flats, there may be a difference
in the way your vehicle handles, and the ride may be a bit harder and noisier.
Be sure to purchase run-flats and have them installed at a car or tire dealer
that knows how to do it properly. There’s a good case to be made that the
expense is well worthwhile compared to the possible consequences of blow-
outs and flat tires.
Low-pressure warning systems
Both run-flat and self-inflating tires (see the next section) require low-pres-
sure warning systems, and the federal TREAD Act mandates that all vehicles
built in the 2008-model year and after must come equipped with this safety
feature. If your vehicle is an earlier model that doesn’t have such a system, to
save your tires — and yourself — from damage caused by running on flat
tires, you may want to have such a system installed.
You can find two types of low-pressure systems on modern vehicles:
 Direct systems: The only option for vehicles that didn’t come equipped
with run-flats. They employ a sensor on the wheel that usually is placed
opposite the valve stem. The sensor sends a signal to a unit that usually
activates a warning light on the instrument panel (some systems have
warning chimes). The sensors are powered by small, five-year batteries
that usually are replaced with each new set of tires.
321
Chapter 17: How to Keep Your Car from Getting Sore Feet

 Indirect systems: The least expensive option and therefore the type that
automakers often prefer to use. They employ the same sensors as are
used on ABS systems to measure the speed of the wheels. However,
when used with run-flats, an indirect system needs to be specially tuned
to be sensitive enough to the very slight differences between an inflated
run-flat and one that’s flat.
Self-inflating tire systems
Self-inflating tires aren’t due to be generally available for several years, but
you should be aware that they’re in the works. Michelin, in partnership with
several other companies, is developing TIPM (Tire Inflation Pressure
Management), a tire inflation system for passenger cars and light trucks that
will include a compressor that automatically adjusts the pressure in each tire
while the vehicle is in operation to suit the actual driving conditions of the
vehicle, taking into account load, weather, and speed. TIPM will automatically
compensate for natural leakage as well as slow-leak punctures. The driver
will be able to select comfort, sporty, all-terrain, or over-obstacle driving
modes and adjust the pressure accordingly.
Tips for Buying Tires
Tire wear is affected by a number of factors: the condition of the vehicle’s
brake system and suspension system, inflation and alignment, driving and
braking techniques, driving at high speeds (which raises tire temperatures
and causes them to wear prematurely), how great a load you carry, road con-
ditions, and climate. So, before you rush out and buy a set of tires, you have
several things to consider:
How important is fuel-economy? Some types of tires are more fuel efficient
than others. The bottom line is that the narrower the tread width and the
higher the inflation pressure (psi), the less rolling resistance and thus the
most fuel economy from the tire. However, the way any tire performs is most
affected by road and weather conditions and, of course, the way you drive!
Are you hard on tires? If you tend to “burn rubber” when cornering, starting,
and stopping, you know where that rubber comes from. A pair of cheaply
made tires will wear out quickly, so buy the best quality you can afford. And
learn not to be such a lead-foot!
Do you drive a great deal and do most of your driving on high-speed high-
ways? A tire with a harder tread compound will take longer to wear out under
these conditions. See the “Tire quality grade codes” section earlier in this
chapter for more information about treadwear ratings.
322
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

Do you drive a lot on unpaved rocky roads, carry heavy loads, or leave
your vehicle in the hot sun for long hours? If so, you need higher-quality
tires that have the stamina to endure these challenges. Look for extra 
load-rated or even LT (light truck) tires. A tire dealer can tell you which tires
are rated for extra loads.
What’s the weather like in your area? Today, front-wheel drive vehicles with
high-tech all-season tires get better traction than the old snow tires, which you
had to replace when warm weather set in. However, if you drive under extreme
conditions, you may want to check out tires designed for them.
Do you drive mostly in local stop-and-go traffic, with many turns? Softer
tires with wider treads will suit you best.
How long do you intend to keep your vehicle? Putting expensive tires on a
car that you intend to get rid of in 10,000 or 20,000 miles is foolish. On the
other hand, if you intend to keep your vehicle for several years, you’ll save
money in the long run by opting for more expensive, longer-lasting tires over
cheapos or tires rated for less than 40,000 miles. Cheap tires wear out more
quickly and cost more in the long run if you figure in the cost of buying,
mounting, and balancing that second set. What’s more, if you suffer a
blowout, or if your tires fail to grip the road, you’ll pay a great deal more if
your vehicle — or you — is injured.
If you drive only a couple of thousand miles a year, don’t expect a pair of
60,000-mile radials to last forever. Rubber treads tend to rot eventually
because of the ozone in the air, which causes cracks and hard spots in the
sidewalls (it’s a condition called ozone checking). For this reason, if your
323

Retreads: Bargains or blowouts?
Millions of tires are discarded every year, and
an entire industry has developed to put them
back in service by replacing the worn tread
areas with new ones. The retreading process
involves grinding the tread off an otherwise
sound old tire and winding a strand of uncured
rubber around the tire. Then the tire is placed in
a mold, where the rubber is cured under heat
and pressure and the tread itself is shaped.
Finally, the tire is painted.
For many years, retreads had a reputation of
being unreliable, and most consumers assumed
that the strips of tread they saw littering the 
highways came from retreaded tires that had
disintegrated on the road. But today, advances
in retreading have raised their quality. Although
they are now hardly used on passenger vehicles,
and high-performance vehicles are probably
better off with new tires, most large commercial
trucks (such as semis) use them, as do virtually
all the world’s airlines. Retreaded tires are also
used on school buses, racing cars, taxis, trucks,
and federal and U.S. military vehicles.
You can find out more about retreads at
www.retread.org.

tires have more than 40,000 miles of wear and tear, even if the treads are in
good shape, have the tires checked to make sure that deteriorating rubber
hasn’t made them prone to blowouts and leaks.
Do you feel vulnerable on the road? If you worry about having a blow-out,
don’t feel that you can change a flat yourself, or are afraid that you’ll be car-
jacked or injured if you stop to change a tire, run-flat tires (described earlier
in the chapter) are well worth owning.
In addition to knowing which kind of tire is best for your vehicle and under-
standing the tire codes (explained in the section called “The Secrets on Your
Sidewalls, Revealed!”), keep the following tips in mind when you shop for tires:
 You can find the proper tire size for your car in your owner’s manual or
on a sticker affixed to the vehicle. If neither exists, ask your dealer.
 Although you should never buy tires that are smaller than those speci-
fied for your vehicle, you often can buy tires a size or two larger (if the
car’s wheel clearance allows it) for better handling or load-carrying abil-
ity. However, buy these larger tires in pairs and place them on the same
axle. Ask your mechanic or a reputable tire or auto dealer for advice
about the proper size range for your vehicle. Sometimes buying larger
tires also requires larger wheels, which can quickly get expensive.
 Never use two different-sized tires on the same axle.
 If you’re replacing just one or two tires, put the new ones on the front for
better cornering control and braking (because weight transfers to the
front tires when you brake). Of course, if you have a sports car or perfor-
mance vehicle with rear tires that are larger than the front tires, you
have to make sure you keep the proper sizes on each axle.
 You have to “break in” new tires, so don’t drive faster than 60 mph for
the first 50 miles on a new tire or spare.
 Store tires that you aren’t using in the dark, away from extreme heat and
electric motors that create ozone.
Caring for Your Tires
Tires don’t require a great deal of maintenance, but the jobs in this section
will pay off handsomely by increasing your tires’ longevity, handling, and per-
formance as well as providing you with a more comfortable ride.
Checking tire inflation pressure
The single most important factor in caring for your tires is maintaining the
correct inflation pressure. True, most newer vehicles have the built-in 
324
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

pressure-monitoring systems described earlier in this chapter, but there are
still many vehicles on the road without them.
If your vehicle doesn’t have a pressure-monitoring system, you should check
your tires at least once a month and before every long trip to see that they’re
properly inflated. Tires that are correctly inflated tend to wear properly in
spite of minor weather ups and downs. Underinflated tires wear out faster,
create excessive heat, increase fuel consumption, and make the vehicle
harder to handle. Overinflated tires can blow out more easily, wear out faster,
and make the vehicle unstable and unsafe to handle. The section “Checking
your tires for wear,” later in this chapter, helps you check for signs of these
problems and tells you what to do about them.
Check tire pressure in the morning before you start out or when you’ve
driven less than a mile. If you drive more than that, your tires will heat up
and the air will expand, so you won’t get an accurate reading.
If the weather has changed radically, it’s time to check pressure again. In hot
weather, the pressure in your tires rises by one pound per square inch (psi)
of pressure for every 10°F as the air in them heats up and expands. This can
result in overinflation. Conversely, in cold weather, the pressure falls by one
degree for every 10° drop as the cold air contracts, so your tires can end up
underinflated. Therefore, if the weather gets very cold — and it looks as
though it will stay that way for some time — and if you get a low reading, you
may want to add a bit of air to your tires to bring the pressure back up.
Here’s how you check the air pressure in your tires:
1. Buy an accurate tire gauge at a hardware store or auto supply store.
Figure 17-3 shows you what one type of tire gauge looks like.
Figure 17-3: The number on the tire gauge indicates air pressure in psi.
325
Chapter 17: How to Keep Your Car from Getting Sore Feet

2. Determine the proper air pressure for your tires by looking for the
proper inflation pressure on the tire decal.
You can find the tire decal on one of the doors, door pillars, glove box,
console, or trunk. Sometimes the tire decal specifies one pressure for
the front tires and a different pressure for the rear tires.
Don’t consult the tire’s sidewall for the proper inflation pressure. The
sidewall lists the maximum pressure that the tire is capable of handling,
not the pressure that’s best for performance and wear (unless you’re
carrying heavy loads).
3. Remove the little cap from the tire valve that sticks out of your tire
near the wheel rim.
You don’t have to remove your wheel cover or hubcap for this step.
4. Place the open, rounded end of the tire gauge against the valve so
that the little pin in the gauge contacts the pin in the valve.
5. Press the gauge against the valve stem.
You’ll hear a hissing sound as air starts to escape from the tire. At this
point, a little stick will emerge from the other end of the tire gauge valve
(see Figure 17-3). It emerges partway almost as soon as the air starts to
hiss and stops emerging almost immediately.
6. Without pushing the stick back in, remove the gauge from the tire
valve.
7. Look at the stick without touching it. There are little numbers on it;
pay attention to the last number showing.
The last number is the amount of air pressure (in psi) in your tire, as
shown in Figure 17-3. Does the gauge indicate the proper amount of pres-
sure recommended on the decal?
If the pressure seems too low, push the stick back in and press the gauge
against the valve stem again. If the reading doesn’t change, you need
more air.
Instead of a stick, some tire gauges feature a dial on the face of the gauge
that shows the air pressure, and digital tire pressure gauges are becom-
ing increasingly common. If you have one of these, just check to see if
the needle on the dial — or the digital readout — shows the correct psi. 
If it doesn’t, you need to add air to the tire until the reading is correct.
But you knew that, right?
8. Repeat Steps 3 through 7 for each tire.
Run-flat tires and little temporary spare tires can lose pressure over
time, so be sure to check them, too.
9. Add air, if necessary, by following the steps in the next section,
“Adding air to your tires.”
326
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

Adding air to your tires
If your tires appear to be low, check the pressure according to the steps in
the preceding section and note the amount that they’re underinflated. Then
drive to a local gas station.
Be sure to bring some change (usually quarters) with you for the air dispenser.
(Forget about things being “as free as air” — at many stations it isn’t!)
Follow these steps to add air to your tires:
1. Park your vehicle so that you can reach all four tires with the air hose.
2. Remove the cap from the tire valve on the first tire.
3. Use your tire gauge to check the air pressure in the tire and see how
much it has changed since your last reading (tests have shown that
tire gauges on the air hoses at many gas stations are inaccurate).
The pressure will have increased because driving causes the tires to heat
up and the air inside them to expand. To avoid overinflating the tire, no
matter what the second reading indicates, you should only add the same
amount of air that the tire lacked before you drove it to the station.
4. Use the air hose to add air in short bursts, checking the pressure after
each time with your tire gauge.
5. If you add too much air, let some out by pressing the pin on the tire
valve with the back of the air hose nozzle or with the little knob on
the back of the rounded end of the tire gauge.
6. Keep checking the pressure until you get it right.
Don’t get discouraged if you have to keep adjusting the air pressure. 
No one hits it on the head the first time!
Rotating your tires
People have differing points of view on tire rotation. Some say that you can get
up to 20 percent more wear if you rotate your tires. Others caution against
rotating them because rotation may hide the distinctive treadwear patterns
that provide the clues to poor alignment, worn shock absorbers, and defec-
tive brakes found in the “Checking your tires for wear” section later in this
chapter. If your tires seem to be wearing evenly and you haven’t had any of
these problems, then it’s a good idea to rotate them — but check them first for
signs of problems that may have arisen since the last time they were rotated.
327
Chapter 17: How to Keep Your Car from Getting Sore Feet

For uniform tire wear, the tires on most vehicles should be rotated approxi-
mately every 6,000 miles, unless they show the signs of irregular wear in
Table 17-1 and Figure 17-9 later in this chapter. There are a few other excep-
tions to this rule: Vehicles that have larger wheels and tires in the rear and
vehicles that have different wheels front to back can’t undergo tire rotation.
And if you have unidirectional tires or tires with asymmetric tread designs,
you can’t rotate them in the patterns shown in Figure 17-4.
When you rotate tires, you simply move each tire from one location to another.
However, where you move the tires depends on the type of tires and vehicle
you have (see Figure 17-4). If you’re not sure where to move the tires on your
vehicle, consult your owner’s manual (usually it has a diagram showing how
the tires should be rotated), call the tire manufacturer, or ask the dealership.
Figure 17-4: How to rotate your tires.
To save the enormous amount of effort involved in jacking up your vehicle
and changing each tire, you can always just drive to a service facility and
have them rotate the tires for you. Many shops include free tire rotation and
wheel balancing in oil change and other special service promotions, and
most tire dealers include periodic tire rotation and wheel balancing in their
warranties. (I explain wheel balancing in the next section.)

The tires on the front and rear wheels may require different air pressures. After
the tires are rotated, remember to adjust the air pressure on each tire to what-
ever is indicated on the tire decal on your vehicle or in your owner’s manual.
If you have a matching, full-sized spare, you can include it in the rotation
process by starting it out in the right rear position and using the tire that
would have been moved to the right rear as the spare tire until the next rota-
tion. Obviously, you don’t include a “Temporary Use Only” spare tire (those
teeny little ones) in any rotation pattern.
Balancing your wheels
Wheel balancing does a lot to eliminate some of the principal causes of tire
wear, and an unbalanced wheel and tire can create an annoying vibration 
on smooth roads. Because balancing is a job that should be done with the
proper equipment, and because that equipment is costly, get the job done for
you at a service facility or tire store. Just remember that there are two kinds
of wheel balancing: static and dynamic.
 Static balancing deals with the even distribution of weight around the
axle. You can tell that you need to have your wheels statically balanced if a
wheel (or more than one wheel) tends to rotate by itself when your vehicle
is jacked up. It rotates because one part of the wheel is heavier than the
rest. To correct this problem, a technician finds the heavy spot and applies
tire weights to the opposite side of the heavy spot to balance it out.
 Dynamic balancing deals with the even distribution of weight along the
spindle. Wheels that aren’t balanced dynamically tend to wobble and
wear more quickly. Because imbalance can be detected only when the tire
is rotated and centrifugal force can act, correcting dynamic balance is a
relatively complex procedure. Most service stations have computerized
balancers that not only balance the wheels but also locate the places
where tire weights are needed and decide how much weight to add.
Having your tires balanced both statically and dynamically shouldn’t be terri-
bly expensive and may be included in a service or warranty package. As
with any general service, it pays to check around for the best deal.
If you plan to have your wheels balanced professionally, rotating your tires
yourself beforehand is a waste of time. The technicians have to remove the
tires to balance them anyway, so they may as well rotate them, too.
Aligning your wheels
A cheap and easy way to substantially improve your vehicle’s handling and
extend the life of your tires is to be alert to signs of misalignment and to have
your wheels aligned immediately if the signs appear.
329
Chapter 17: How to Keep Your Car from Getting Sore Feet

I learned this lesson the hard way when I wore out a tire that was almost new
in one day of highway driving because it was out of alignment! If I’d known
enough to check my tires, I’d have seen that the tread on this tire was worn
down one side, a sure sign of misalignment.
This job is sometimes called front-end alignment because the front wheels get
out of line most often. They get that way because of hard driving with dramatic
getaway starts and screeching stops, hitting curbs hard when parking or cor-
nering, accidents, heavy loads, frequent driving over unpaved roads or into
potholes, and normal wear and tear as the car gets older. Occasionally, the rear
wheels need realignment as well. Vehicles with independent rear suspensions
and front-wheel drive vehicles require four-wheel alignment. I used to think
that alignment involved taking a car that had been bashed out of shape and lit-
erally pulling it back into line. Untrue. All the technicians do is adjust your
wheels to make sure that they track in a
nice, straight line when you drive. To do
so, they use special equipment to check
the following points:
 Caster: Has to do with the position
of your steering knuckle as com-
pared to a vertical line when viewed
from the side (see Figure 17-5). If
properly adjusted, it makes your
wheels track in a straight line
instead of weaving or shimmying 
at high speeds. Caster also helps
return the steering wheel to a
straight-ahead position after com-
pleting a turn.
 Camber: The inward or outward
tilt of the top of the wheels when
viewed from the front/rear of the
vehicle — in other words, how 
“bow-legged” or “knock-kneed”
they are (see Figure 17-6). If the
wheels don’t hang properly, your
tires wear out more quickly, and
your car is harder to handle.
 Toe-in and toe-out: Involve placing
your tires so that they’re properly
positioned parallel to the frame
when driving down the road. Some
cars call for a little toe-in (tires
pointing inward, as in Figure 17-7),
whereas others are set with a little
toe-out (tires pointing outward). The
result should be a nice, straight

track when the car is moving
quickly. On some front-wheel
drive vehicles, the manufac-
turer may set the rear tires with
a little toe-in and the front tires
with a little toe-out so that the
tires are parallel to the frame
when the vehicle is in motion.
 Turning radius: The relation
of one front wheel to the other
on turns. If you turn to the
right, the right front tire needs
to turn at a slightly greater
angle than the left front tire
(see Figure 17-8). Your vehi-
cle’s steering arms accommo-
date this feat. If your tires squeal
sharply on turns, one of your
car’s steering arms may be your problem.

How do you know if your wheels need aligning? Look at your tires to see
whether they show any of the treadwear patterns that I discuss in the next sec-
tion, and pay attention to how your car steers and handles. Does it pull to one
side? Does the steering feel loose and sloppy? Is your vehicle hard to handle
after a turn? If your tires show any unusual wear patterns and/or you answered
yes to any of these questions, your car probably needs an alignment.
Checking your tires for wear
You should check your tires for wear at least once a month and before and
after long trips. To determine whether you need to (a) buy new tires, (b) have
your wheels balanced, (c) have your wheels aligned, or (d) change your dri-
ving habits, simply read your tire treads for clues. Table 17-1 and Figure 17-9
show you what to look for.

Figure 17-9: What the signs of poor treadwear mean.
Underinflated tires wear out faster, create excessive heat, increase fuel con-
sumption, and make your car harder to handle. Overinflated tires can “blow
out” more easily, wear out faster, and make the vehicle unstable and unsafe
to handle. And a new set of tires on wheels that are out of alignment can wear
out completely in as little as one day of hard driving!
To determine what’s causing problems with your tires, try the following:
 Look for things embedded in each tire. Do you see nails, stones, or
other debris embedded in the treads? Remove them. But if you’re going
to remove a nail, first make sure that your spare tire is inflated and in
usable shape.
If you hear a hissing sound when you pull a nail, push the nail back in
quickly and take the tire to be fixed. If you aren’t sure whether air is
escaping, put some soapy water on the hole and look for the bubbles
made by escaping air. If you’re still not sure whether the nail may have
caused a leak, check your air pressure and then check it again the next
day to see whether it’s lower (for help, see “Checking tire inflation pres-
sure” earlier in this chapter). Tires with leaks should be patched by a
professional. If the leak persists, get a new tire. These instructions apply
to any sharp object that may have penetrated through the tread.
 Look at the sidewalls. Check for deeply scuffed or worn areas, bulges or
bubbles, small slits, or holes. Do the tires fit evenly and snugly around
the wheel rims?
 Look at the treads. Most tires have built-in treadwear indicators (see
Figure 17-10). These bars of hard rubber are normally invisible but
appear across treads that have been worn down to 2⁄32 of an inch of the
surface of the tire (the legal limit in most states). If these indicators
appear in two or three different places less than 120 degrees apart on the
circumference of the tire, replace the tire.
Severe underinflation
Overinflation
Poor alignment

333
Chapter 17: How to Keep Your Car from Getting Sore Feet

If your tires don’t show these indicators
and you think that they may be worn
below legal tolerances, place a Lincoln
penny head-down in the groove between
the treads. If you can see the top of
Lincoln’s head, your tire probably needs
to be replaced.
To measure treadwear more precisely,
place a thin ruler into the tread and mea-
sure the distance from the base of the
tread to the surface. It should be more
than 2⁄32 inch deep. (Note: If your front tires
are more worn than your rear ones and
show abnormal wear patterns, you proba-
bly need to have your wheels aligned.)
Sometimes 2⁄32 inch of tread isn’t enough to keep you safe. If you live in a
rainy area, measure the depth of your treads with a quarter rather than
a penny, using Washington’s hair to see if your tires have at least 4⁄32 inch
of tread remaining, which reduces the distance and time it takes for the
car to stop.
 Pay attention to leaks. If you keep losing air in your tires, have your local
service station check them for leaks. Sometimes an ill-fitting rim causes a
leak. The service facility has a machine that can fix this problem easily.
If the facility can’t find a leak, your rims fit properly, and you’re still
losing air, you probably have a faulty tire valve that’s allowing air to
escape. If a tire valve needs to be replaced, be sure that the replacement
provided by the service facility has the same number molded into its
base as the valve it’s replacing.
Dealing with Defective Tires
Tires, like vehicles, can turn out to be lemons. But these lemons can put 
your life on the line. Defective tires should be replaced by the manufacturer,
but you may need proof before you file a complaint. If you discover that 
one of your tires is defective, go to www.safercars.gov/tires/pages/
TireDefects.htm for links that enable you to check for recalls; check for
complaints by make, model, and year; and search to see whether a safety
investigation is underway into defects found on a particular tire (there may be
fees for this search, however). You can file a complaint at www-odi.nhtsa.
dot.gov/ivoq/index.cfm.
If you prefer, you can call the Vehicle Safety Hotline toll free at 1-888-327-4236
to report safety defects and to obtain information on cars, trucks, child seats,
and highway or traffic safety.

Take the Drive Train:
Understanding and Maintaining
Your Transmission without 
Losing Your Mind
In This Chapter
 Exploring the major components of the drive train
 Getting to know your transmission
 Finding out how manual, automatic, and continuously variable transmissions work
 Becoming familiar with four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive
T
he transmission system in your vehicle is probably its most complex
system in terms of automotive mechanics. But take heart: You don’t have
to be a genius to understand it (or I wouldn’t be writing about it!). For
starters, think of the transmission as a communication system that takes
messages from you about whether you want to go forward or backward —
and at what speed — and passes them on to the wheels.
Transmission systems vary from one vehicle to another. With a manual
transmission (sometimes called a standard transmission), you shift into the
proper gear at the proper time yourself; with an automatic transmission,
the shifting is done for you. Some newer vehicles feature a continuously
variable transmission (CVT). But the result is the same: Every transmission
transmits power from the engine and directs it to the wheels. However, it
doesn’t do the job alone; it’s part of a system that has several components,
commonly known as the drive train.
This chapter takes you for a ride on the drive train. By the end of the line, the
transmission and its related parts should no longer be a mystery. All
aboooard!

After you get familiar with the drive train, your next mission (if you care to
undertake it) is to establish a closer relationship with it. Because most of the
parts related to your drive train are either electronic or require special tools
and a hoist to deal with, you really can’t do much to repair it yourself.
However, you have no reason to feel helpless because there are lots of things
you can do for your drive train, such as troubleshooting, simple maintenance,
undertaking repairs wisely, and driving in ways that don’t abuse it. This chap-
ter covers it all. If you maintain it properly, the transmission and other parts
involved will glide you along smoothly for the life of your vehicle. If it isn’t
performing well, being able to troubleshoot the symptoms can save you 
hundreds — even thousands — of dollars.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
The Drive Train
When your vehicle changes direction from forward to reverse, the drive
wheels that actually drive the car (you find out which ones they are later in
this chapter) don’t just have to be told which way to rotate. They also must
know how fast to turn, and they must be supplied with extra power for start-
ing, climbing hills, and pulling heavy loads. All these things are accomplished
via the drive train. By knowing what each part does and how it relates to the
other parts of the drive train, you can trace the flow of power from the
engine to the wheels.
Here’s an interesting way to look at how the drive train functions: Imagine
that you’re the captain of a ship. You have a lovely set of engines down in the
engine room that manufactures power to move your ship. You’re up on the
bridge, surveying the ocean with your binoculars, when suddenly you see an
iceberg dead ahead. Instead of running down to the engine room and person-
ally reversing the propellers so that the ship moves backward, you pick up
the intercom and call the engine room. “This is the captain speaking. Reverse
engines!” The person in the engine room hears you and does what’s neces-
sary. The ship is saved.
In a car, you’re still at the wheel giving orders, but you’re giving them to a
vehicle that can’t hear you. You need a piece of machinery to communicate
with other machines. In this case, that piece is your gearshift. By moving the
gearshift with your hand, you tell the transmission what to do. Then the
transmission tells the wheels via the driveshaft.
With the aid of the drive train, you can tell your wheels not only to go 
forward or backward but also how fast to go. When you step on the 
accelerator, you compel the engine to produce power, but that power has 
to get to the wheels in the proper way for the wheels to respond most 
336
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

efficiently. There are ways to convey that extra power to the wheels by con-
trolling how fast they turn in relation to the engine’s speed when you’re going
up a hill, pulling a heavy load, or just trying to overcome inertia so the vehi-
cle can start moving. To do this, your transmission has more than just for-
ward and reverse gears; it has low and high gears, too. Some transmissions
have as many as seven forward gears to control power and speed efficiently.
Continuously variable transmissions glide from one end of the spectrum to
the other without separate gears. In all cases, the lower gears provide more
power at lower speeds. The higher gears provide less power but allow the vehi-
cle to move at higher speeds because the wheels can turn faster in these
gears at any engine speed. The following section shows how power flows
through traditional drive trains; because you’ll understand them better when
you’re familiar with the basics, we get to the more exotic versions later on.
How Power Flows through the Drive Train
Most vehicles come with two basic types of drive trains: front-wheel drive
and rear-wheel drive. The names are self-explanatory: With front-wheel
drive the power flows from the engine to the front wheels, which drive the
car. With rear-wheel drive, the power flows to the rear wheels, and they’re in
charge. Surprise! (There are all-wheel drive, four-wheel drive, and other
variations, but I keep it simple for now.) On almost all vehicles, the front
wheels respond to the steering system, which directs the vehicle around
curves and turns.
On rear-wheel drive vehicles, all the parts involved run like the cars on a
train, from the engine in the front to the wheels at the rear. (That’s probably
why they called it the “drive train.”) Although today more vehicles have
front-wheel drive — which combines the transmission and other parts into
one neat package called a transaxle — in order to get a good look at every
part involved in a drive train, it’s easier to follow the power through a rear-
wheel drive vehicle with a manual transmission. When you know what each
part does and whether or not it’s done manually, automatically, or combined
into some exotic new mechanism, you’ll stay on track through the more
detailed descriptions of each type of vehicle found in separate sections of
this chapter.
To make your ride smoother, Figure 18-1 shows all the components as they’re
located on a vehicle with rear-wheel drive and a manual transmission. If your
vehicle has front-wheel drive, Figure 18-2 shows you the way the power flows
through a transaxle. The principles and parts are pretty much the same in
each type of drive train.
337
Chapter 18: Understanding and Maintaining Your Transmission

Figure 18-1: The drive train in a vehicle with rear-wheel drive and a manual transmission.
Use Figure 18-1 to trace the flow of power from one part of the drive train to
the next, as described in the following steps:
1. The running engine produces power that causes the crankshaft to turn
at a particular rate of speed. The faster the engine runs, the more power
it produces and the faster the crankshaft turns.
2. At the end of the crankshaft is the engine flywheel. This disk-shaped
plate turns at the same rate and in the same direction as the crankshaft.
3. Facing the flywheel is the first part of the clutch. When you step on the
clutch pedal, the clutch disconnects the engine from the transmission
to allow the car to change gears.
4. After you move the gearshift to the proper gear, when you take your
foot off the clutch pedal, the clutch allows the engine and transmission
to resume contact and turn together at a new speed.
5. On the other side of the clutch, the drive train continues, with a sepa-
rate shaft. It’s not called the crankshaft anymore; it’s now called the
transmission input shaft because it carries the power via the turning
shaft into the transmission. It rotates at the same speed and in the same
direction as all the parts I’ve covered up to now.
6. Inside the transmission is a group of gears that can move together and
apart, in various combinations, to determine how fast and with how
much power the vehicle’s wheels turn and whether they go forward,
backward, or stop.
7. The next part of the drive train emerges from the other side of the 
transmission. It’s now called the transmission output shaft because 
it transmits the power that the transmission is putting out to the 
driveshaft.

8. The driveshaft of a rear-wheel
drive vehicle with a conven-
tional engine has a U-joint (short
for universal joint) at either
end. The U-joints enable the dri-
veshaft to move freely without
affecting the more rigid trans-
mission shaft at one end and to
absorb the vertical movement
of the rear axle and wheels at its
other end.
On vehicles with transverse
engines (see Figure 18-2), ball-
and-socket fittings called con-
stant velocity joints (CV)
transmit engine power from the
axles to the wheels. You can find
them where each axle joins the
transaxle and where each con-
nects with the vehicle’s drive
wheels. Like U-joints, they 
can turn and move in any 
direction — up, down, and from
side to side.
9. The differential is another box of gears that, in a rear-wheel drive vehi-
cle (see Figure 18-3), takes the movement of the spinning driveshaft
through a 90-degree angle to the axle that turns the drive wheels. It also
allows each side of the axle to rotate at a different speed. This ability is
necessary because, when you go around a sharp curve, the outside
wheel travels farther than the inside wheel and has to move more
quickly than the inside wheel, just like the ice skater at the end of a
snap-the-whip line.
10. The differential also provides the drive wheels with extra power by
using its gears to convert varying numbers of revolutions of the drive-
shaft into one revolution of the drive wheels. This is called the gear
ratio. I get into details about gear ratios in the later section “Manual
Transmissions.”
On a front-wheel drive vehicle the transaxle is in line with the center
hubs of the front wheels (refer to Figure 18-2). The axles (sometimes
called half-shafts) emerge from each end and run straight to the wheels.
The differential changes the direction of the power coming out of the
engine and into the transaxle.

wheels move at right angles to the spinning driveshaft.
Four-wheel drive
If you own a sport-utility vehicle (SUV) that features four-wheel drive
(as shown in Figure 18-4), your drive train includes a transfer case (see
Figure 18-5). The transfer case controls the power to the front and rear drive
axles. When you switch from two- to four-wheel drive with either a dash-
mounted switch or a floor-mounted shifter, a gear in the transfer case
engages the front driveshaft along with the rear driveshaft so that all four
wheels get power from the engine. In two-wheel drive, only the driveshaft
connected to the rear wheels gets power from the engine, and the front
wheels are disengaged.
The transfer case also usually has settings for low and high gears. Low gear
delivers a lot of torque (pulling and pushing power) to the wheels for travel-
ing in very rugged, muddy, snowy, or slippery terrain at slow speeds. High
gear is for traveling at moderate speeds on normal roads in wet or moder-
ately slippery conditions. (Your owner’s manual can tell you how fast your
vehicle’s system will let you drive without damaging it.)

All-wheel drive
All-wheel drive (AWD) vehicles are different from four-wheel drive (4WD)
vehicles in that AWD vehicles send power to all four wheels all the time. As
shown in Figure 18-6, AWD vehicles usually employ three differentials: one
between each set of drive wheels and one in the center. They must split the

power from the engine to the front and rear wheels for two reasons: because
each set travels differently through a turn, and because many systems use
computers that sense the amount of traction needed by each wheel and send
different amounts of power to each wheel, if necessary.
Figure 18-6: An all-wheel drive vehicle has three differentials so the wheels can operate
independently of one another.
Manual Transmissions
Even if your vehicle doesn’t have a manual (sometimes called standard) 
transmission, you should understand how a manual transmission works.
The principles involved are fairly simple, and automatic transmissions do
basically the same things, just without a manual clutch and with less manual
shifting.
What a manual transmission consists of
This section takes a closer look at each major part of a manual transmission.
You encounter most of them in the drive train section earlier in this chapter,
but this section puts them into closer perspective.

Figure 18-1 shows you where each part is located on the drive train of a
manual transmission. Figure 18-7 shows a five-speed manual transmission.
Figure 18-7: Five-speed transmissions are standard on many vehicles.
The gearshift
You use the gearshift to select and change gears. It’s usually found on the
floor in front of or between the front seats. Older cars used to have shifts
with three forward speeds located on the steering column. Then sportier
models with four forward speeds emerged. The gearshift in those vehicles
was located on the floor, which gave rise to the phrase “four on the floor.”
Today, vehicles with manual transmissions have as many as seven forward
speeds! Gearshifts also have positions for Reverse and Neutral (so the vehi-
cle can idle out of gear).
The clutch
You use the clutch when you start, stop, and shift gears. In each case, you
step on the clutch pedal with your left foot to disengage the clutch disk
from the engine flywheel so that the engine’s crankshaft can turn indepen-
dently of the transmission input shaft (the turning shaft that carries the
power from the engine into the transmission). If you attempt to shift gears
without using the clutch, the gears in the transmission will rotate at different
speeds and could clash and injure the transmission. The clutch consists of
the following major parts, shown in Figure 18-1:

Chapter 18: Understanding and Maintaining Your Transmission

 The clutch pedal is located on the floor of the vehicle to the left of the
brake pedal. The clutch pedal is connected to a clutch release lever via
linkage. Sometimes a cable is used; most newer cars use hydraulic
components.
 The clutch disk faces the flywheel. This disk-shaped plate moves back
and forth to connect and disconnect the engine from the transmission.
 The clutch pressure plate is next to the clutch disk. This mechanism
forces the clutch disk against the flywheel or allows it to move away
from the flywheel when it’s time to change gears. When you’re not step-
ping on the clutch pedal, a coating of friction material causes the disk
and the flywheel to adhere to each other, which forces them to turn at
the same speed.
 The throw-out bearing is linked to the clutch pedal and activates the
release levers that move the pressure plate back and forth. When you
step on the clutch pedal to disengage the clutch and disconnect the
engine from the transmission, a clutch release arm forces the throwout
bearing into the pressure plate’s release levers. As a result, the pressure
on the clutch disk is released and the disk can turn independently of the
flywheel.
 After you move the gearshift to the proper gear and the engine is going
at its new speed, you release the clutch pedal. This causes springs in the
pressure plate to force the clutch disk against the flywheel again. The
friction material on the disk causes them to grab each other lovingly and
turn at the same rate once more.
The gears
The transmission contains the gears and responds to messages from the
gearshift and the clutch. On manual transmissions, the gears are metal
wheels with notches on the rims that allow them to mesh with one another
(see Figure 18-7). Originally, the gears in most manual transmissions were
moved into and out of mesh with each other by the gearshift lever. In modern
vehicles, the gears are always in mesh and only the synchronizers move, 
causing a change in power flow.
The number of gear wheels in the transmission depends on the number of
forward speeds the vehicle has. An additional gear reverses the direction of
power so that your car can move backward. Because you must bring a vehi-
cle to a stop before you back up and because you rarely want to hit high
speeds in Reverse, this gear works in conjunction with the lowest gear
because it can provide the power to overcome inertia and get the car moving
backwards.
344
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

How a manual transmission works
Generally speaking, the faster your engine runs, the more power it puts out. If
you need extra power to get up a hill — or to overcome inertia and just get
that heavy monster moving in the first place — your engine must run faster
than it runs when it’s just maintaining a steady speed. Low gears supply that
power by making your wheels turn at a slower rate than your engine does.
On the other hand, if you drive faster than the range of speed provided by a
gear, your vehicle will “red line” — go beyond the maximum numbers of rpm
(revolutions per minute) your engine is capable of — and damage the engine.
That’s why you have to shift up to the next higher gear as your speed
increases. The ratio between how fast your engine turns and how fast your
wheels turn is called the gear ratio.
Here’s how the gear ratio works: As
you can see in Figure 18-8, a large
gear is placed next to a small gear
so that their teeth mesh. If the large
gear has 30 teeth and the small gear
has 10, the large gear turns once to
every three turns of the small gear.
In other words, the large gear turns
only a third of the way around for
every complete revolution of the
small gear. The gears in your trans-
mission work on this principle,
which, in this case, is called a 3:1
gear ratio. As you can see in Figure
18-7, the turning drive train brings a
gear into contact with other gears of
different sizes. That’s why the trans-
mission input shaft that runs
between the engine and the transmis-
sion turns at the same rate of speed
as the engine but the transmission output shaft that leaves the transmis-
sion and carries the power via the driveshaft and differential to the rear
wheels turns at a different rate, depending on which gears in the transmis-
sion are engaged.
If you’re feeling mind-boggled, reread Steps 5 through 10 in “How Power
Flows through the Drive Train” earlier in this chapter.
345
Chapter 18: Understanding and Maintaining Your Transmission
Figure 18-8: A 3:1 gear ratio: A gear with 
10 teeth will have rotated completely when a
30-tooth gear has traveled only a third of the
way around.

Now take a closer look at what goes on when you shift from one gear to the
next.
 In First gear (the lowest gear), the gears in the transmission make the
driveshaft (and therefore the wheels) turn more slowly than the engine.
In fact, the driveshaft may turn only once for every four engine revolu-
tions (a 4:1 gear ratio). All the power of the swiftly running engine is
channeled into those few turns. The wheels turn more slowly, but they
have more power to put into each turn, so your vehicle can start, climb
a hill, or pull a trailer. Not only does the engine run faster in First gear,
but you also have the mechanical advantage of the big gear providing
more leverage by turning slowly, but with more force.
 In Second gear, the engine turns more slowly than it did in First, putting
out less power but more speed because the wheels can turn more
quickly. In this gear, the driveshaft may turn once for every two engine
revolutions, or twice as fast as in First gear.
This process continues through each successive gear until the highest
one. Every model of vehicle has its own set of gear ratios designed to
provide the best combination of power and economy.
 Around Fourth gear, the gear ratio can drop to around 1:1, which means
that the engine and the driveshaft turn at relatively the same rate of
speed. The wheels can go very fast; yet the engine doesn’t put out addi-
tional power to produce that speed. Because you’ve overcome inertia by
the time you shift into Fourth gear and generally have nothing more to
contend with than wind resistance and the surface of the highway, you
don’t need much power to keep moving at a good clip after you get there.
 In Fifth gear, the ratio is usually an overdrive of around 0.75:1, which
means that the engine can turn more slowly than the output shaft’s
speed. You want to be at that ratio on the highway for good fuel econ-
omy. However, you need to downshift if you want to gain speed to pass
someone because you don’t have much engine power with this ratio.
Some vehicles now have as many as seven gears! Although the ratio may
be the same in a seven-speed transmission as in a five-speed, the greater
number of gears provides a more precise range of ratios. The more for-
ward speeds, the more precisely power can be applied to the drive
wheels and the more fuel-efficient the vehicle becomes.
Automatic Transmissions
Did you know that today’s automatic transmissions are computer-
controlled hydraulic systems? Previous automatic transmissions were
mechanically controlled. This section covers the basic features of several
popular automatic transmission systems.
346
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

An automatic transmission works on the same basis as a manual transmis-
sion does, with a gear selector on the steering column, dashboard, or floor
to allow you to tell your vehicle to park, idle, go into Reverse, go forward at
varying speeds, or move into lower gears. But instead of a manual clutch, an
automatic transmission uses a torque converter and hydraulic pressure to
change gears automatically.
A torque converter replaces the standard transmission’s clutch. The 
torque converter is a fluid coupling that uses hydraulic pressure to control
the amount of engine power transmitted through the converter to the 
transmission input shaft. It allows the vehicle to idle with the gear selector
in Drive, provides a smooth transfer of power, and at highway speeds can be
locked up to reduce slippage and improve fuel economy.
Shifting in an automatic transmission is controlled by a hydraulic system
that’s usually electronically controlled. Most hydraulically controlled trans-
missions consist of an intricate network of valves and other components
along with hydraulic pressure to control the operation of sets of planetary
gears (see Figure 18-9). These gearsets can be fashioned to generate three or
more forward speeds. Continuously variable transmissions (CVT) don’t
use planetary gears (I get to them later in this chapter).
Figure 18-9: A cutaway view of a modern hydraulic automatic transmission.
A very thin oil called transmission fluid fills the transmission system and
generates hydraulic pressure. As the engine speed changes, the pump that
pumps the transmission fluid to develop hydraulic pressure also changes
speed. The transmission fluid responds to the changes in pressure by flowing
through the transmission at different rates. When the vehicle is moving
slowly, the pressure is low and only the low gears respond. As the car’s speed
increases, so does the pressure, and higher gears are brought into play.

Chapter 18: Understanding and Maintaining Your Transmission

The hydraulic pressure drives the transmission gears by means of friction
bands and plates. These bands and plates function like the clutch on a manual
transmission, pulling various gears into and out of action. When mechanics
tell you that your bands need adjusting, these are the bands they’re talking
about. They usually can make this adjustment without taking the transmis-
sion apart.
Electronic transmission systems use a computer called a transmission 
controller to keep track of engine speed, acceleration, load (as when you’re
driving up a hill), and braking. It uses this information to send electronic 
messages to solenoids that control shifting.
Because of their ability to make more precise adjustments as you speed up,
climb hills, take turns, and employ ABS brakes, electronic systems are more
efficient than hydraulic systems and can increase fuel economy.
Dual-clutch transmissions
Originally, prospective car-buyers had two basic options when choosing a
transmission: manual or automatic. Now there’s a third type that offers the
driver the best features of both in a single vehicle! You can kick back and let
your vehicle shift gears automatically, or you can manually select them your-
self without the need to operate a clutch pedal. These nifty transmissions 
are known by a variety of names: dual-clutch, automated manual, semi-
automatic, even “clutchless” (which makes no sense since they have two
clutches instead of one!). To stay sane, I call them dual-clutch transmissions,
or DCT for short. DCTs operate more smoothly than ordinary automatics or
manuals, and they can deliver better fuel economy, as well.
As you can see in Figure 18-10, the most significant structural difference is
that a DCT has two clutches (hence the name “dual-clutch”). One clutch 
operates the odd-numbered gears, and the other clutch controls the even-
numbered gears. The result is that the flow of power to the transmission from
the engine isn’t interrupted as the transmission shifts from one gear to
another.
The DCT also has two transmission input shafts, one inside the other. The
hollow outer shaft contacts the even-numbered gears, and the shaft inside it
contacts the odd-numbered gears.
DCTs don’t use torque converters; instead, most of them use “wet” clutches
to hydraulically operate the gears, as most automatic transmissions do. This
also lubricates them to cut down friction and heat. “Dry” clutches similar to
the ones in manual transmissions will probably be available, too.
348
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

Figure 18-10: A dual-clutch transmission has two clutches and two transmission shafts.
Don’t confuse the more common sport mode found in many conventional
automatic transmissions with a dual-clutch transmission. Automatics with
sport mode enable the driver to shift manually by electronically locking each
forward gear until the driver uses the gear selector to change gears. To keep
the engine from blowing apart under stress if the driver fails to shift properly,
many only allow the driver to lock into a gear until the engine hits red-line, at
which point an electronic engine shutoff device kicks in. Others simply shift
themselves if the rpms get too high.
Continuously variable transmissions
Newer vehicles are now available with continuously variable transmis-
sions (or CVT, for short) that have no physical gears at all! Instead, they
move seamlessly from one gear ratio to the next by means of a pulley
system that not only provides for smoother shifting but also results in higher
fuel efficiency.
It’s interesting to note that the CVT isn’t a new concept. In 1490, Leonardo da
Vinci designed a CVT, and Subaru brought the first production model to the
United States in 1989.

Chapter 18: Understanding and Maintaining Your Transmission

CVTs aren’t complicated 
systems. They may use
hydraulic pressure, springs,
or centrifugal force to adjust
gear ratio in response to
information collected by sen-
sors and sent to a computer.
Most of them consist of an
input drive pulley that’s con-
nected to the engine crank-
shaft and brings energy into
the transmission from the
engine. An output pulley
(or driven pulley) sends 
the energy out of the trans-
mission to the driveshaft.
(It’s called “driven” because
the input pulley drives it.)
As you can see in Figure 18-11,
each pulley consists of two
cones and a belt that rides in
a groove between them. As the distance between the cones changes, the belt
rides higher or lower in the groove. Where it’s riding changes the radius of
the belt’s loop around each pulley, and its position on each pulley (its radius)
determines the gear the vehicle is in.
CVTs are constantly evolving. Newer versions employ quieter and longer-
lasting flexible metal belts that connect butterfly-shaped metal pieces and
systems that use disks and power rollers, but the advantages remain the
same: faster response time, greater power, smoother shifting, higher 
efficiency, and fuel economy. CVTs currently may be more expensive than 
traditional transmissions, but they’re worth it.
Troubleshooting Your Drive Train
Did you know that a low transmission fluid level or a malfunctioning, 
inexpensive gizmo may cause the same symptoms as a faulty transmission?
Who knows how many unsuspecting customers have paid big bucks to
rebuild or replace transmissions when they could have corrected the prob-
lems themselves with very little money or effort! This section shows you how
to troubleshoot your transmission and try the cheapest remedies before
paying professionals to do major surgery.

If you have to take the problem to a specialist, be sure to read the section
called “Undertaking Transmission Repairs Wisely” later in this chapter. If
you’re lucky, your transmission may need only a simple adjustment. If you’re
not so lucky, your transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced. But in any
event, you’ll know that you’re getting the proper service.
Symptoms of a sick transmission system
If weird things start happening on the road, how can you tell whether the
transmission or one of the other parts of the drive train is in trouble? If this is
the case, continuing to drive may make the situation worse. Here are ways
your vehicle tries to tip you off:
 If light grey smoke is coming out of the tailpipe, this can mean you’re
low on transmission fluid and the engine could be burning. Check the
following section to beat “Those low-transmission-fluid blues.”
In some pre-1990 vehicles, the smoke may also be due to a faulty
vacuum modulator that’s siphoning the fluid out of the transmission
and into cylinders of the hot engine. Consult a service manual for your
make, model, and year to see if Old Faithful has a vacuum modulator; if
it’s easy to reach, try unscrewing it and replacing it before you consider
more costly remedies.
In most post-1990 vehicles with automatic transmissions, the vacuum
modulator has been replaced by an electronic solenoid. It does the
same job but is controlled by the electronic control unit (ECU) rather
than engine vacuum, so there’s no siphoning problem.
 If thick, black or tan, oily liquid is coming from under the vehicle, gear
oil may be leaking from a manual transmission, the differential, an
axle, or the steering gears. Any of these leaks needs immediate attention.
 If the engine speeds up when you step on the accelerator but your
vehicle doesn’t; or if it hesitates before responding when you shift
gears (or doesn’t respond at all); or if shifting suddenly becomes awk-
ward or noisy, the cause depends on whether you have an automatic or
manual transmission. If you have an automatic transmission, you may
just be low on transmission fluid, have a disconnected hose or plugged
filter, or your transmission controller may be out of whack. If you have
a manual transmission, the trouble could be in the clutch or another
component. In any case, it’s a job for the car doctor.
 If you hear a clunking sound, it can mean transmission trouble or just a
low fluid level. If a loud clunking suddenly comes from under the hood, it
could be just a broken accessory belt. In either case, pull to the side of
the road and call for a tow.
351
Chapter 18: Understanding and Maintaining Your Transmission

Those low-transmission-fluid blues
If your automatic transmission seems to be acting up by hesitating when
you change gears or by shifting with a “clunk,” first check your transmission
dipstick. Your transmission fluid may be low or dirty. Chapter 2 tells you
how to find and check your transmission dipstick and how to buy the proper
kind of transmission fluid for your vehicle.
It’s a good idea to check transmission fluid fairly often as part of the monthly
under-the-hood check in Chapter 2. A good many “band jobs” have been
bought and paid for when a quart of transmission fluid would have solved the
problem for pennies. Before emptying your wallet, check your transmission
fluid level and try the following remedies:
 If your fluid level is low, with the parking brake on and the gearshift in
Neutral or Park, use a funnel to add a teeny bit of fluid at a time down the
dipstick hole until the fluid level just reaches the “Full” line on the stick.
Do not fill beyond the line! Driving with too much transmission fluid can
damage your transmission. Check the stick again in a couple of days; if
the level is low again, you either have a leak or may need to have a seal
replaced.
To check for a leak, before you drive off in the morning look at the
ground under the vehicle for a greasy red, pink, or reddish-brown leak
around the transmission area — or on the transmission itself, if you can
see it easily. (If you have a rear-wheel, four-wheel, or all-wheel drive
vehicle, to get a look at the transmission you’ll probably have to jack up
your vehicle or have a professional place it on a hoist.)
 If your fluid level is fine but your transmission isn’t working well; or if
your fluid keeps disappearing and no leaks are evident, you probably
need transmission work.
 If the transmission fluid on the dipstick looks or smells burned or
dirty, you may want to consider having the fluid, filter, and the pan
gasket changed.
Transmissions should be serviced every 25,000 to 30,000 miles, but if your
vehicle has more than 100,000 miles on it and the transmission fluid has
never been changed, don’t change it unless there are really serious reasons
for doing so. The old transmission fluid has formed a deposit around the
front transmission seal. If this fluid is totally replaced with fresh fluid, the
new stuff may dissolve the deposit and cause the old seal to leak. In this case,
I’d add just enough new fluid to bring the level up to the “Full” mark on the
dipstick or as close to it as possible. Then, when the poor, neglected beast
dies, have the transmission rebuilt (unless the rest of the vehicle is dying,
too). This does not mean that you shouldn’t have the transmission serviced.
Because you’ll probably lose only three quarts in the process of servicing,
replacing the lost fluid shouldn’t disturb the seals.
352
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

If you have no mechanical problems but want to replace all the fluid in your
vehicle’s transmission, check into one of the several transmission services
available now though repair shops and dealerships that use suction pumps
to flush virtually all the old fluid out of a transmission, circulate a cleaning
agent through the system, and refill it — all without having to take the 
transmission apart.
If you have an all-wheel drive or four-wheel drive vehicle, don’t forget to
check the fluid level in the transfer case, too.
Your manual or automatic transmission system will work better and live
longer if you have the U-joints in your drive train checked and replaced with
new ones if they’re loose, and if you have your differential lubricated at 
regular intervals.
Taking Care of Your Clutch
Most drivers can expect their clutches to last 40,000 to 60,000 miles but your
clutch can be good for as little as a few thousand miles or as long as the life
of your vehicle depending on the type of vehicle you drive, the way you 
drive it, and how much maintenance it receives.
Most newer vehicles with manual transmissions have self-adjusting
clutches that require no adjustment, but if you have an older model without
self-adjustment, you can cut down on the wear on your clutch disk by keep-
ing your clutch pedal properly adjusted. (If you’ve forgotten, the “What a
manual transmission consists of” section earlier in this chapter tells you
what these parts are and what they look like.)
Your clutch pedal should move down 3⁄4 inch to 1 inch without effort and then
require a good deal more effort to travel the rest of the way down to the floor.
This pedal free-play ensures that when you release the pedal, the clutch disk
is fully engaged. Too much free pedal play isn’t good, either, because too
much pedal travel is used up doing nothing: There’s not enough movement
left at the bottom of its travel to compress the clutch springs and allow the
engine flywheel and the clutch disk to separate. With this excessive pedal
play, the gears clash whenever you shift into First or Reverse from a stopped
position.
If there’s no free pedal play on your clutch pedal, another problem can occur,
even if there’s enough play to allow the clutch disk to engage. In this case, 
the throwout bearing, which responds to pressure on the clutch pedal by
causing the disk to disengage, may go on spinning. If the throwout bearing is
allowed to revolve constantly in this way, it will wear out, which makes get-
ting into or out of gear difficult.
353
Chapter 18: Understanding and Maintaining Your Transmission

Don’t ride the clutch. Riding it can wear out the throwout bearing, too. You
can tell that something is wrong because the bearing makes whirring, whin-
ing sounds. If the sounds disappear when you release the clutch pedal and
resume when you step on it, you have a bad throwout bearing. If you think
that you have one, or if your clutch misbehaves in other ways, go to a reliable
mechanic and have the clutch checked out.
If you have a clutch disk replaced, have the entire clutch checked at that time
to be sure that other parts aren’t going to need work soon. Here’s what
should probably be done in each case:
 If the flywheel is worn, have a professional resurface it. This proce-
dure involves grinding it down to a new, flat surface and then polishing it
to a mirror-like finish. If you fail to have this work done, the worn fly-
wheel can wear out the facing of the new clutch disk very quickly. And if
you’ve already had the disk replaced, chances are that it managed to
score the flywheel by the time you recognized the trouble signs and had
the disk attended to.
 If the pressure plate is excessively worn, scored, or glazed; or if the
springs on the pressure plate become loose, you should have them
replaced, as well.
Because excessive wear on any part of your clutch results in wear on the
other parts, it’s generally a good idea to have the clutch assembly, levers,
clutch disk, and throwout bearings checked and, if necessary, replaced at the
same time. You also can have the pilot bearing (located where the crankshaft
meets the flywheel) checked then, too, which saves you money on labor
charges by eliminating the necessity of getting into your clutch and putting it
back together a second time.
Undertaking Transmission 
Repairs Wisely
Your first line of defense against unnecessary transmission work is to have
your automatic transmission serviced periodically, according to the manu-
facturer’s recommendations (usually around every 24,000 miles). Your
second line of defense is to understand what the basic kinds of transmission
work involve. Here are the various types of work that your vehicle may
require and what each of them entails:
 If your transmission needs servicing:
• The transmission fluid should be changed, if necessary.
• The bands on a hydraulic transmission should be adjusted, if this
job can be done externally.
354
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

• The transmission filter should be replaced.
• The gasket around the transmission pan should be replaced, and
the fluid in the pan should be changed.
 If your transmission is leaking:
• If the front seal is bad, the technician must remove your transmis-
sion to replace it, but he or she doesn’t have to take the transmis-
sion apart. Front seals usually have the biggest leaks.
• If the problem is the rear seal, the technician must remove your
driveshaft, but your transmission can stay in place.
 If your transmission must be overhauled:
• The transmission should be removed and disassembled.
• The seals, clutches, bands, and bushings that are worn or defec-
tive should be replaced.
 If your transmission must be replaced: The old transmission must be
removed and a new one installed. You do have an option as to whether
you replace it with a used, rebuilt, or new transmission. I make the dis-
tinction between used and rebuilt because you can buy a transmission
from a wrecking yard that has salvaged one designed for your vehicle’s
year, make, and model. This option is cheap, but risky. Your other option
is to find a rebuilt transmission that has been salvaged and then com-
pletely refurbished and comes with at least a three-month guarantee.
These cost a bit more, but you get a chance to make sure that the thing
is in good working order.
Occasionally, gearshifts may become hard to move. This problem can
happen if the gearshift linkage, which connects the shift lever to the rods that
go to the transmission, needs adjustment, lubrication, or minor repair. These
repairs aren’t expensive and should certainly be investigated before you let
anyone talk you into major transmission work.
Front-wheel drive vehicles have a transmission and axle assembly all in one,
called a transaxle. All-wheel drive and four-wheel drive vehicles usually
have an additional component called a transfer case. Expect to pay more for
transaxle repairs and transmission repairs on a vehicle with a transfer case.
As you can see, knowing what kind of transmission work is necessary can
save you from paying for more work than you need. A number of other things
can go wrong and seem to indicate that you need major transmission work to
correct them; yet these problems often can be fixed for very little money. An
unscrupulous mechanic can diagnose one of the problems as a major trans-
mission breakdown and charge you hundreds of dollars when the real solu-
tion could be achieved for much less (see “Those low-transmission-fluid
blues” earlier in this chapter).
355
Chapter 18: Understanding and Maintaining Your Transmission

When your transmission needs work, you have to rely on professionals, but
that doesn’t mean that you have to blindly accept whatever they tell you.
Transmission repairs can range from regular service, which is relatively
simple and inexpensive, to highly complicated and very expensive rebuilds
and replacements. The best way to get an accurate diagnosis and the repairs
that your vehicle really needs is to follow the advice I give in the section
called “Getting the Best Possible Deal” in Chapter 22. If you get ripped off
anyway, the chapter also tells you how to get satisfaction on complaints.
Here are some additional guidelines: 
 For transmission repairs, take your vehicle to the dealership or to a
reputable transmission specialist. Ask the technician to diagnose the
trouble and give you an estimate of the costs.
 Don’t let the technician take the transmission apart. When your trans-
mission is in pieces, you’re a sitting duck! Have the specialist drive the
vehicle, listen to it, ask you questions about its history and its symp-
toms, and give you his or her ideas. The technician may say, “You may
just need your transmission serviced, or you may need a new transmis-
sion; I can’t tell until I open it up.” Fine. Ask for estimates for both jobs,
and if the prognosis is expensive, get additional estimates. You’d get a
second opinion before going through major surgery, wouldn’t you?
How to Keep from Driving 
Your Transmission Crazy
Driving your vehicle with expertise can prevent many of the most common
causes of transmission failure. If you have a manual transmission, you
should shift into the proper gear at the proper time to reduce the strain on
the engine and the transmission and should not ride your clutch. To do this,
a good driver with a manual transmission learns to watch the tachometer, or
just “feel” the vehicle’s need for more power or more speed, and then shift
into the proper gear for each occasion.
Many drivers with automatic transmissions just shift into Drive and go up
steep hills, carry heavy loads, and bounce into jackrabbit starts, happily
oblivious to the fact that even automatic transmissions have gear selectors
that provide one or two lower gears for these occasions. On the other hand,
if you stay in a low gear unnecessarily, you’re transmitting excessive power
to your rear wheels, and your transmission feels the strain. If you attempt to
356
Part IV: Smoothing the Ride: Steering and Suspension, Tires and Transmissions 

speed in a low gear, you strain the transmission even more. On the other
hand, if you attempt to climb hills in high gear, you force the engine and
transmission to make the effort in a gear that lacks the power for the job. The
result: more strain.
To avoid unnecessary wear and tear and to extend the life of your transmis-
sion if it’s manual or a traditional automatic, use the following shifting 
strategies:
 When you need a sudden burst of speed, use passing gear. On vehi-
cles with an automatic transmission, passing gear provides the same
kind of increased power as downshifting a manual transmission. You
use passing gear when you’re already in high gear and need an extra
burst of power to pass a car or enter a freeway. If you’ve been traveling
at less than 50 mph, suddenly flooring the accelerator makes your car
downshift automatically to the appropriate lower gear to provide more
power by speeding up the engine.
 Use Overdrive (or the highest gear on a manual transmission) when
you’re traveling steadily at a high speed. With Overdrive or “top” gear,
you have an extra, higher gear that allows your rear wheels to turn even
faster while maintaining the same engine speed. After you’re really
moving, shifting into Overdrive means that you can move at the same
speed while the engine turns more slowly and consumes less fuel.
 Shift manual transmissions to higher gears as soon as your speed
enters their range. There’s no need to supply extra power when it’s not
needed. Your owner’s manual should tell you the range of speed for each
gear. Automatic transmissions shift for you.
 If traffic slows and you feel the engine straining (called lugging), shift
manual transmissions into a lower gear. Downshifting enables the
engine to turn faster and carry you along with less strain. After you’re
moving freely again, return to a higher gear.
 With both types of transmissions, select lower gears for heavy loads
and steep hills. If you come to a steep hill — or if you’re carrying four
kids, two dogs, and everything you’ll need for a month in the country —
go for the lower gears instead of trying to haul the whole mess as fast as
you can. Then shift back up again to coast down the hill. This way, the
power goes toward carrying the load rather than toward maintaining
speed.
Continuously variable transmissions (CVT) move smoothly from one
speed to another without any physical gears at all. They respond to all road
situations faster and more efficiently. You may want to ask Santa for a vehicle
that has one.

ith the growing emphasis on fuel economy, it’s easy to forget that the
most important issue for everyone who owns, drives, or is a passen-
ger in modern vehicles is safety. Getting there efficiently is not as important
as getting there in one piece! As prospective buyers and state and federal
government have made reducing road injuries and fatalities a major priority,
automotive technology has responded with a variety of improvements and
innovations. Many safety systems that were introduced as optional features
on luxury vehicles a few years ago have become available either as an option
or as standard equipment on an increasing number of models because
research and testing by NHTSA and the IIHS has prompted government 
legislation to make an increasing number of them mandatory.
This chapter describes the most important safety features that are currently
available or will be in the near future. I hope that it will inspire you to keep
up-to-date on what’s out there and make these protective systems a priority
when choosing your next vehicle.
Every one of the safety features in this chapter is important, so the order in
which they appear shouldn’t affect the amount of attention you pay to each
of them. Although buying a vehicle with highly rated protection systems may
cost a bit more, ask yourself what the health — and lives — of you, your
family, and friends is worth. If you’re driving an older vehicle that lacks many
vital safety features, you should definitely consider replacing it with a newer,
safer, model.

Besides the systems in this chapter, rain-sensing windshield wipers, self-
defogging side mirrors, night-vision enhancement, headlamps that can swivel
to illuminate corners, and other innovations are becoming popular. Keeping
up-to-date on what’s available is easy. Several organizations and agencies
have Web sites that rate vehicles and safety systems. At the NHTSA site,
www.safercar.gov, you can type in a vehicle’s make, model, and year and
see its rollover and crash-test ratings. The IIHS lists the Ten Safest Vehicles
along with ratings for air bags on www.iihs.org and offers a free brochure
called “Shopping for a Safer Car” that you can view and download from the
Consumer Brochures link. In addition, publications such as Consumer Reports
feature the results of their tests and ratings on a regular basis.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Air Bags
Air bags have been around for quite a while and are credited with saving tens
of thousands of people from injury and death. Air bags also have been
accused of causing injuries when they deploy with too much force. As a
result, they’re constantly being upgraded to be more sensitive and versatile,
and they’re designed for several locations to provide protection in a wider
variety of accidents. This section tells you about the types of air bags found
on many modern vehicles and what should be available over the next few
years. It also tells you how to position yourself (and other passengers) to
avoid being injured by them if they deploy.
Traveling safely with air bags
The most important way to protect yourself from being injured by an air bag
is to maintain a space of at least ten inches from the area where it’s located. If
you’re the driver, this does not mean that you have to scoot the entire seat
back ten inches from the air bag if that makes it difficult to steer and reach the
gearshift and pedals. Instead, recline the seat back and raise the seat until
you’re a safe distance from the bag and still can see and drive comfortably.
Because the driver’s front air bag (often called the frontal air bag) is located
in the center of the steering wheel, if your steering wheel can be adjusted, tilt
it downward so that the air bag area is aimed at your chest rather than at
your head and neck. Figure 19-1 shows ways for the driver to reach the
proper distance from the front air bag.
362
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

Figure 19-1: How to achieve the correct position.
If you don’t wear a seat belt, or if you’re wearing it improperly, you not only
risk hitting whatever’s in front of you if the car stops abruptly, but you also
can end up on top of an inflating air bag and be injured by it.
If necessary, don’t be afraid to jam on the brakes. Air bags aren’t deployed
unless you hit something that the ECU senses as a moderate or severe crash.
Just tapping an adjacent vehicle or curb or nudging the stanchion in a park-
ing lot shouldn’t trigger the air bags in your vehicle.
How air bags work
Basically, an air bag system is made up of one or more air bags, the crash
sensors that detect that a crash has taken place (or in some cases, may be
about to happen), and the mechanisms that inflate and deploy the bags. Air
bags usually are inflated with a harmless gas (usually nitrogen or argon). 
To keep you from suffocating and give you room to move around, the gas
escapes through vents in the fabric and the bag deflates in less than a second
after deployment.
If you notice something that looks like smoke after an air bag deploys, it’s
probably starch or talcum powder that’s sometimes used to lubricate the
action of the air bag. The substance is usually harmless, but it may contain a
little sodium hydroxide, which could irritate your eyes or throat for a little
while but won’t cause injury.

Chapter 19: Staying Safe on the Road
Adapted from the NHTSA (www.safercar.gov)

Air bags are placed in several locations. The frontal air bag on the driver’s
side is usually located in the center of the steering wheel, and the passenger-
side air bag can be found on the dashboard. A variety of side-impact air bags
may be found on or over the doors, on the roof of the passenger compart-
ment, or on the sides or backs of the front seats. There are even new seat belt
systems that contain air bags to protect passengers from . . . air bags! I cover
each type of air bag later in this chapter. Here’s what’s involved in order to
deploy an air bag:
 The crash sensors measure how fast the vehicle is decelerating or how
badly it’s crushed, if hit on the side. Frontal-crash sensors may be
located in the passenger compartment, near the engine, or inside the
ECU. Side-impact sensors can be located in the door, the pillar between
the doors, the doorsills, or the ECU.
 The ECU uses information from the sensors to decide whether or not to
deploy a particular air bag.
 The air bag inflator receives a signal from the ECU if the vehicle has
crashed severely enough to warrant air bag protection. This signal starts
a chemical reaction that produces the gas that inflates the air bag (see
Figure 19-2). In frontal collisions, all this happens in less than 1⁄20 of a
second, and side air bags inflate even faster because there’s usually less
space between the potential victim and the site of impact.
Figure 19-2: How air bags work.
 ON-OFF switches that can disable air bags when they’re potentially
more dangerous than protective may be found on some vehicles
because the speed with which an air bag inflates can injure someone it’s
meant to protect. Modern sports cars and trucks that lack rear seats
usually come equipped with these switches.

Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

To ensure that children are placed in the rear seats of vehicles that have
them, those vehicles aren’t allowed to have an ON-OFF switch as standard
equipment. If you want to have a switch installed in a vehicle with rear seat-
ing, you have to apply for it and explain why it’s necessary. Because the
driver and passenger air bags operate independently, turning one off doesn’t
affect the other. To decide whether your vehicle should have an ON-OFF
switch, you can read a copy of NHTSA’s brochure, “Air Bags and On-Off
Switches: Information for an Informed Decision” at www.safercar.gov/
airbags/Brochure/index.html. If you decide to request a switch, you
can download the proper Request for Air Bag On-Off Switch form.
Many newer cars also equip the front passenger seat with a pressure sensor
that deactivates the passenger-side air bag when it determines that a small-
statured person, such as an infant or toddler, is in the seat. A “Pass Air Bag
Off” warning will light up somewhere on the dashboard. These systems aren’t
perfect, though, and are no substitute for an ON-OFF switch.
Replacing air bags
When an air bag is deployed, it can’t be reused, and you shouldn’t drive your
vehicle until it has been replaced. Be sure to go to an authorized repair
center for this job; a “black market” exists for unused air bags recovered
from vehicles that have been scrapped. Unless an air bag was designed 
especially for your vehicle’s make, model, and year, it won’t work properly —
or possibly at all — when it’s needed the most. You can find out whether a
particular vehicle’s air bags have been deactivated by going to www.safer
car.gov/airbags/VINs/Find_VIN.html and typing in its VIN (vehicle
identification number).
Having an air bag doesn’t mean that you can do without your seat belt. Each
safety measure has a job to do to keep you from being injured in an accident.
The following sections describe each type of air bag you may find on a 
vehicle. Some are standard equipment required by law, whereas others are
optional. If you’re shopping for a new set of wheels, air bag equipment should
be a major factor.
Frontal air bags
Originally, the only air bags found on most vehicles were frontal air bags
designed to protect drivers and passengers in front-end accidents. The
driver’s air bag and the passenger’s air bag are in different locations and have
different shapes (see Figure 19-3). Because sensors can tell whether someone
is in the passenger seat, each is deployed independently of the other.
365
Chapter 19: Staying Safe on the Road

Figure 19-3: Different types of air bags.
Because the speed and force with which air bags deployed sometimes caused
injuries, over the years, frontal air bags have constantly been improved to
increase their efficiency. Two such types found on more recent vehicles are
advanced frontal air bags and dual-stage air bags.
Advanced frontal air bags
All passenger cars, SUVs, and light trucks manufactured after September 1,
2006, are supposed to come equipped with advanced frontal air bags designed
with sophisticated sensors that enable the ECU to regulate how powerfully
the air bag will inflate depending on each occupant’s size, whether the seat
belt is worn, the position of the seat, and the force of the crash. Some can
even sense how much you weigh! Advanced frontal air bags can minimize the
risk of air-bag injury for children and adults of small-stature or fragile health
either by not allowing the air bag to deploy when it’s potentially more danger-
ous than the crash itself or by inflating the air bag with less force.
Because advanced frontal air bags can be turned off automatically if the sen-
sors detect a child or very small person in a front seat, they must be equipped
with an indicator light. Often in the center of the dashboard where everyone
can see it, it says “DRIVER AIR BAG OFF” or “PASS. AIR BAG OFF.”
Having an advanced frontal air bag system does not mean that kids can travel
safely in the front seat. They’re still much safer in the rear of the vehicle, as
mandated by law. For information on what to do if you can’t avoid putting a
child in a front seat, see the child safety seat section later in this chapter.

Door-mounted air bag

Frontal air bags
Tubular air bag
366
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

You can tell whether a vehicle has advanced frontal air bags by looking at the
label on the reverse of each sun visor for the phrase, “EVEN WITH
ADVANCED AIR BAGS.”
Dual-stage air bags
In order to protect riders from bags that inflate too forcefully, dual-stage air
bags (sometimes called multi-stage air bags) have inflators that go off in one,
two, or more stages depending on the severity of the crash. Variable output
inflators do the same thing using a range of pressures rather than in stages.
In the United States, dual-stage air bags are now required by law on both the
driver and passenger sides of the vehicle.
Side air bags (SAB)
Because frontal air bags don’t protect individuals during side-impact crashes
or rollovers, a variety of side air bags (SAB) have been designed to do the job
(refer to Figure 19-3). They come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and locations.
Designed to protect the head, chest, and body from hard objects and struc-
tures in the interior of the vehicle as well as from intrusions by exterior
objects, SABs often stay inflated longer than frontal air bags in case of
repeated impacts. Many SABs are designed to sense how severe a crash is
and to “decide” whether or not to deploy and with how much force to use if
they’re needed. According to the IIHS, automakers have agreed informally to
have side air bags as standard equipment on cars, pickups, and SUVs by
around 2010; they’re already included as standard or optional equipment on
a growing number of vehicles.
If you’re shopping for a vehicle, the type and number of side air bags should
be a serious factor in your choice. Not only do they keep you safer on the
road, but the more prospective buyers demand them, the sooner they’ll
become standard equipment.
The basic types of SABs are each designed to protect different areas from
injury (refer to Figure 19-3):
 Curtain and tubular air bags protect your head. Both types of air 
bags are usually located above the side windows of a vehicle and are
designed to protect people seated in both the front and the rear. Besides
protecting you from impacts, curtain air bags may keep you from being
thrown out of the vehicle during a rollover. Tubular air bags stay inflated
for about five seconds (rather than about 1⁄20 of a second) to protect your
head from repeated impacts and during rollovers. Because of their
smaller size, tubular air bags are designed to work in tandem with stan-
dard side air bags, not to replace them.
367
Chapter 19: Staying Safe on the Road

 Seat-mounted air bags are located on the outer side of seats to protect
the chest (or torso) when a vehicle is hit from the side.
 Door-mounted air bags protect your torso from side impacts and in
rollovers.
 Combo air bags protect both the head and the chest. They’re especially
protective in rollovers. Larger than the other types, combo air bags 
usually are installed on the side of the seats.
You can watch videos that show how each type of air bag is deployed at the
NHTSA’s Safer Car Web site, www.safercar.gov/airbags/pages/
ABTypesSABCurtain.htm, and you can find out whether a particular 
vehicle has side air bags at www.iihs.org.
Side Impact Protection Systems (SIPS)
For additional protection in the event that a vehicle is hit from the side, side
impact protection systems (SIPS) are now mandatory on American cars, util-
ity vehicles, passenger vans, and pickup trucks. SIPS feature a variety of
structural design elements as well as the side air bags and curtains described
in the previous section. SIPS can include crash-resistant door pillars with top
portions that are more rigid than the lower portions in order to transfer the
force of the impact away from the head as the lower part of the pillar moves
inward. Other SIPS components can include safety cages incorporated into
the body structure of the vehicle and crumple zones that absorb some of the
impact by crumpling in a way that doesn’t endanger the occupants. Steel
beams reinforce the doors and sides of the vehicle to prevent them from
crushing those seated inside. Some vehicles have side-impact tubes that
transfer the thrust of the crash to a steel box located in the center of the
vehicle; the box collapses to absorb the impact. Others have increased
padding in doors and other areas.
Adjustable Devices
Although the ability to adjust side- and rear-view mirrors and seat-back
angles has been standard for many, many years, an increasing number of
other devices now can be tailored to fit each driver, and sometimes passen-
gers, as well. The more comfortable a driver is — and the better he or she
can reach and operate the steering wheel, pedals, and gearshift — the more
efficient and less distracted and fatigued that driver will be, especially on
long or difficult trips. 
368
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

Here are some of most important adjustable features currently available:
 Adjustable seats: The ability to adjust a seat’s height, angle, and dis-
tance from the steering wheel is now standard equipment, and many
models offer power seats that not only do this with little effort but also
have a built-in memory that enables them to automatically adjust to the
needs of each person who uses the vehicle on a regular basis.
 Adjustable steering wheels: According to Road & Track, “researchers
suggest that 40 percent of women driving larger vehicles do not sit at a
safe distance from the steering wheel.” Now, steering wheels whose tilt
can be adjusted and that can telescope toward or away from the driver
are increasingly standard. Some steering wheels can even be swung to
the side without affecting the settings to allow the driver to enter and
exit the vehicle more easily.
 Adjustable pedals: A switch or keypad that simultaneously adjusts the
height of both the accelerator and the brake pedals, as well as their dis-
tance from the driver, is now available. If you’re below or above average
height, this feature is worth serious consideration.
 Adjustable head restraints: In 2007, according to the IIHS (the only
agency that tests seats and head restraints dynamically to see how well
they prevent whiplash injuries), about 200,000 whiplash injuries out of
around 2 million claims filed annually caused serious long-term medical
problems. They stress that the design of the seat and the head restraint
must work together for effective protection.
The IIHS advises that “head restraints should be positioned high enough to
protect the head so as to minimize neck distortion. Ideally the top of the
head restraint should be positioned even with the top of the head and at
least level with the top of the ears or about 3.5 inches below the top of the
head. . . . The distance from the back of the head to the restraint should be as
small as possible, preferably less than 3 inches. On seats without horizontally
adjusting head restraints, this can be adjusted by adjusting the seatback
recline angle.” Figure 19-1 shows you the ideal position for both the seat and
the head restraint.
Vehicles should have head restraints that automatically adjust when the
angle of the seat back is changed. But to avoid whiplash injuries, people who
are not of average stature may need to adjust their head restraints manually
to the safest position, and this definitely includes rear-seat passengers! In
this case, the tallest people are at greatest risk, although short people are
also affected.
Many vehicles don’t have adjustable rear seat head restraints, and some have
no head restraint for the center rear seat. If you’re looking for a new vehicle,
check to see whether passengers in the rear of the vehicle will be able to
travel safely.
369
Chapter 19: Staying Safe on the Road

Child Safety Seats and Booster Seats
According to research by NHTSA, in the first 20 years, approximately 7,000
lives were saved by the proper use of child restraints. As safer seats are
developed and facilities made available to insure safe installation, the yearly
figures are improving.
NHTSA suggests replacing child safety seats after five years or after an acci-
dent, and sending the registration card to the manufacturer so that you’re
notified in case of a recall.
Child safety seat requirements
Even with all the publicity, the sad fact is that many parents remain ignorant
about the proper way to seat their children in a vehicle, and research has
found that thousands of child safety seats are improperly installed. No single
seat can carry a child safely from infancy through childhood and children need
special seating much longer than many would assume. Figure 19-4 shows you
the four steps and types of seats that are necessary to seat a child safely at
different stages of growth.
Children should be placed far enough away from the side of the vehicle so
that they can’t open the door or window.
Ideally, all young children should be placed in the center of the back seat.
Obviously, it’s impossible to place more than one child in that position, but
children are still better off in the rear than in the front passenger seat. With
two kids, place the younger one in the center of the back seat and the other
on the passenger side of the back seat so that you can see both of them
clearly in the rear-view mirror. If you’re concerned about keeping an eye on
children in the back seats, aftermarket wide rear-view mirrors are available
to give you a good view. Instead of turning around while you’re at the wheel,
learn to “talk to the mirror,” and if pandemonium ensues, pull over and park
at the side of the road before dealing with it face-to-face.
Here are NHTSA’s recommendations for insuring that your children will have
the best chance to travel safely on the road at each stage of their growth and
development (refer to Figure 19-4):
 Infants up to at least 1 year old and less than 20 pounds need special
rear-facing safety seats. Place an infant in the back seat of the vehicle in
a rear-facing child safety seat for as long as possible, up to the height or
weight limit of the particular seat you use. Be sure that the seat can be
adjusted so the infant’s head is supported and doesn’t bobble around.
 Until children reach around age 4 and at least 40 pounds, they must
ride in the back seat in forward-facing child safety seats.
370
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

Figure 19-4: Seating children safely.
There are convertible seats on the market that will take a child from 
toddler age until they need a booster seat, and some seats can be used
as part of a stroller, on dining chairs, and in airplanes. Be sure to check
that whatever type you’d like to buy is rated properly for the entire age
range.
 Children who weigh at least 40 pounds and are at least 4’9” tall 
(usually between the ages of 8 and 10) should ride in a booster seat.
The booster seat is used to elevate the child high enough for the adult
seat belt to fit properly, with the lap belt laying across the upper thighs
and pelvis (rather than the stomach) and the upper strap going over the
shoulder (not the neck) and down across the chest.
Rear-facing seat: Less than
20 lbs + less than 1 year old
Front-facing seat: 20 to
40 lbs + over 1 year old 
Booster seat: Over 40 lbs and
up to 4’9“ tall
Seat belts: Seat belt fits
properly + legs bend over
front of seat when back is
erect against the seat.
371
Chapter 19: Staying Safe on the Road
Adapted from the NHTSA (www.safercar.gov)

Some booster seats have backrests, some are backless, and others con-
vert from one form to the other. If your child is old enough to sit up
straight in the booster seat with his or her back against the back of the
rear seat and the seat belt fits properly, unless your vehicle has low seat
backs or no rear headrests, a backless booster is fine. Otherwise, a back-
rest is a good choice until the child’s head is higher than the backrest.
Don’t give in to pressure from your kids to get out of “babyish” booster
seats prematurely. It’s better to have an angry child than an injured one.
If your child will be riding in someone’s vehicle without your supervi-
sion, it pays to find out how and where he or she will be placed. If neces-
sary, send the proper seat along.
 Children are ready to get out of a booster seat and just use the vehi-
cle’s seat belt when the following conditions are present: Both the
lower and upper belts fit properly (see the preceding booster seats
bullet) and their legs are able to bend at the knees against the edge of
the seat when they sit up straight against the seat back without slouch-
ing. Figure 19-4 shows you what that placement should look like.
Children should only be placed in the front seat of a vehicle if the vehicle has
no rear seat, if there are too many children for all to fit on the rear seat, or if a
child is so sick that you have to be able to reach him or her immediately in an
emergency.
If you must place a child in the front passenger seat on occasion, make sure
that the seat is shoved back as far as possible, that the child is in a safety
seat that keeps him or her in an upright position, and if the vehicle has an air-
bag ON/OFF switch, the “How airbags work” section in this chapter tells you
how to disable the passenger-side air bag. If you have to choose which child
to put in front, pick the one who can best remain restrained in the proper
position, even if it isn’t the oldest or largest child.
Choosing child safety seats
Here are some tips for selecting the best seat for your child and testing it out
to be sure it’s the proper one:
 Buy a new seat. Secondhand seats may be worn or defective.
 A child safety seat must have a label that says it meets or exceeds
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.
 Read the current child seat ratings for safety, durability, and ease of
use. Select from among top-rated seats listed at www.nhtsa.dot.
gov/CPS/CSSRating/Index.cfm or in the most current listings in
Consumer Reports. At www.aap.org/family/carseatguide.htm, the
American Academy of Pediatrics also provides an extensive and detailed
amount of information on this vital topic.
372
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

 Take your child along when shopping for a seat so that you can see
whether you can work the buckles easily while the kid is squirming
around. Tension adjusters to lengthen or tighten the straps should be
easy to use, and straps should go into the buckles and be released easily
(but not so easy that “even a child can do it!”).
 Make sure that your child is comfortable. If you have an infant, the seat
should adjust to recline so that his or her head is supported. 
 There should be room in the seat for the child to grow into and to
accommodate layers of heavier clothing. If you choose wisely, your kid
is going to be in that seat for at least four years. 
Considering types of harnesses and anchoring systems
Child safety seats come with a variety of harnesses to keep your child securely
buckled in place. Some have a three-point harness with straps that come over
the child’s shoulders and connect with a buckle close to the bottom of the seat.
Five-point harnesses have five straps, one for each shoulder, one for each hip
and one at the child’s crotch. Some seats feature a padded or triangle-shaped 
T-shield that’s attached to the shoulder straps and the front of the seat. Still
others have a shield that drops down from overhead to keep the child in place.
The five-point harness is generally considered to be the safest and most com-
fortable for a child, so you may want to look at seats with a five-point harness
first.
Any child seat or booster seat is only as effective as the way it’s anchored to
the vehicle. There are two anchoring systems available to ensure that your
child’s seat is safely anchored, and compatibility with these should definitely
be a vital consideration when choosing a seat:
 The LATCH system: LATCH is an acronym for “Lower Anchors and
Tethers for Children.” Since September 1, 2002, every new vehicle and
child safety seat has been required to have this system, which elimi-
nates the need to use seat belts to secure the seat. As shown in 
Figure 19-5a, the system includes anchor hardware on the vehicle and
hooks and straps on the seat that attach to them. You can find more
information on LATCH and how to use it to install child seats at www.
chop.edu/consumer/jsp/division/generic.jsp?id=77978.
Unless both your vehicle and the child seat have the LATCH system, you
will still need to use seat belts to install the seat! Before installing it,
inspect the seat belts to be sure that they are not frayed, are securely
anchored to the vehicle, and that the latches work properly. If you spot
any problems, have new seat belts installed throughout the car. And be
sure the seat can be securely anchored using seat belts alone.
 ISOFIX connections: ISOFIX has been the worldwide standard in child-
seat safety and convenience since 2004. It’s available as standard equip-
ment or as an option. This rigid interface between the child seat and the
373
Chapter 19: Staying Safe on the Road

body of the vehicle enables the seat to be installed easily and to stay
safely in place. With ISOFIX installed, instead of fussing with seat belts or
hooks and straps, you just click the seat into the anchor points in the
car, as shown in Figure 19-5b.
Figure 19-5: The LATCH car seat system (a) and an ISOFIX car seat system (b).
Testing the candidates before you purchase
After you select the best candidates, take the seats out of the store to the
parking lot and try them out in the rear seat of your vehicle to see whether
they’re easy to handle and whether your child is comfortable in them.
Because you aren’t going anywhere, there’s no need to install each one —
just place it on the seat and set your child in it.
If a store won’t let you try seats out in your vehicle, offer to buy the one that
looks the most likely to work for you and tell the clerk that you’re going to try
it out in the parking lot and may be returning immediately to exchange it for
another — and another — until you find the one that satisfies your needs. 
At that point, the department head or store manager will probably give you
permission to test the seats out without going through all that rigmarole.
Check to see whether your child will be able see out of the window.
Obviously this isn’t a requirement for tiny infants, but a seat that sits high
enough to afford visibility will cut down on the complaining as time goes on
and the baby grows up.
Have the seat installed professionally at the store (if you feel that they’re
capable of doing that properly) or at your dealership, or locate a child-seat
fitting station and have it installed there. To find local, professional assis-
tance with correctly installing a child safety seat, go to www.nhtsa.gov
and click on Locate a Child Seat Fitting Station in the left-hand column. 
The site also contains valuable information on child seats and a place to file
complaints.

Smart Seat Belts
Although seat belts have been mandatory on passenger vehicles for years,
the technology to create “smart” seat belts that are safer, more efficient, and
significantly adaptable to each individual is just hitting its stride.
Currently available are seat belts with pretensioners that detect a crash and
increase the tension of the seat belt to literally haul you into a safer position
on the seat. Although how these smart seat belts do this varies from one
model to the other, most use the same sensors that activate the air bags in
response to a crash. And there are seat belts on the road today that have
built-in load limiters that lengthen the belt a bit if it constricts too forcefully
during a high-speed crash.
BFGoodrich has a smart belt that inflates a little air bag that runs the entire
length of the seat belt. It deploys along with the other air bags to protect you
from them by pushing away from you rather than toward you. These are
expected to become standard on personal vehicles, school buses, trains, and
airplanes, too. The newest smart seat belts can anticipate a possible accident
and react before it happens! Most of them are connected to sophisticated 
air-bag sensors and to the anti-lock braking system (ABS) described in
Chapter 14. Currently in the works is an ultrasound finger scanner on the
dashboard that can “read” the bone density of the individual and use it to
determine how much tension that person’s bones can handle! This could be
especially important for seniors and children.
No matter how smart seat belts become, unless drivers and passengers are
smart as well, the belts can’t be truly safe and effective unless you wear
them! They also need to be properly adjusted. A well-fitting seat belt should
allow you to move around enough to look out the side window and run 
your vehicle efficiently. If the seat belts in your vehicle seem to have been
designed for basketball players or dwarves, consult your dealership or a reli-
able auto parts store for gadgets that keep them from cutting into your neck
or strangling you. Be sure your passengers in the rear seat are belted in, too.
The Center for Transportation Injury Research at the University of Buffalo,
New York, found that unbelted passengers sitting behind the driver tripled
the odds that the driver would be killed in an accident because, if the
unbelted passengers hurtle forward, they quadruple the maximum force to
the driver’s head and chest.
Pregnant women should always wear seat belts that are positioned correctly
in order to avoid injuring themselves and their unborn children. The lap belt
should be as low as possible around the hips rather than across the stomach,
and the shoulder belt should rest across the breastbone rather than the
stomach. NHTSA advises against deactivating air bags; its tests have shown
that there’s risk for greater injury without an air bag because it helps spread
the force of the crash, which would be concentrated by the seat belt, over a
larger area.
375
Chapter 19: Staying Safe on the Road

One last reminder for expectant parents: Don’t forget to bring an infant safety
seat along with you to the hospital so your newborn can ride home safely.
“Eyes” in the Back of Your Vehicle
When parking a vehicle or backing out of any parking space or driveway,
most of us wish we had eyes in the back of our heads. What scares us when
it’s difficult to see what’s behind us is not simply the possible damage to our
vehicles — or to someone else’s if we collide with them; the really tragic risks
involve hitting a human being or an animal. Unfortunately, small children and
pets are all but invisible in rear-view mirrors, and thousands have been killed
or injured by vehicles that backed over them. Back-up warning devices, also
called rear sensing systems, and parking sensing devices are being developed
in a variety of configurations and are increasingly found as standard or
optional equipment on passenger vehicles.
Back-up beepers and sensors
For many years, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
has required construction equipment and other industrial vehicles to be
equipped with back-up beepers that sound a warning to everyone within
earshot when the vehicle is in Reverse, and this has probably saved many
lives. Some passenger vehicles, particularly SUVs, are equipped with audible
back-up alerts. Because kids and animals probably don’t know enough to
respond to audible alerts, the sensors and back-up cameras and monitors
described in the following sections are probably a better solution.
Sensors that can be mounted at the rear of a vehicle are available on the
aftermarket, as optional equipment on some vehicles, and as standard
equipment on many luxury models (especially SUVs). Sensors use sonar to
detect objects behind the vehicle and beepers or warning lights to alert 
drivers when they detect something dangerously close behind them.
Back-up cameras and monitors
Back-up cameras that offer a view of what’s behind the vehicle are now
becoming popular options on newer models and are expected to become
standard equipment on many models before too long. A variety of back-up
cameras are already available on the automotive aftermarket, all of which
require a monitor to view what they record. Cameras mount on the rear
panel, on or under the rear bumper, or inside the vehicle, and monitors may
be incorporated into rear-view mirrors, can be placed on the windscreen or
the dashboard, or can hook into a navigation system. This safety device is
definitely a worthwhile investment!
376
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

Blind-spot information systems (BLIS)
The area where drivers can’t see vehicles in adjoining lanes behind or to 
the side when using their side and rear-view mirrors is called the blind spot.
Collisions and near-misses when changing lanes because the blind spot 
rendered a vehicle invisible are a daily occurrence on most highways and
busy streets. As a result, Volvo has led the way in developing a blind-spot
information system (BLIS) that employs a little camera mounted on each side
mirror (see Figure 19-6) to alert drivers who are planning to change lanes to
vehicles in those lanes that they may otherwise not be able to see. It also
tells drivers when there is sufficient space to change lanes safely.
When a vehicle appears in a blind spot, the camera on that side activates a
light on the door panel near that mirror. When there’s enough room to
change lanes safely, the light goes off. Drivers testing this system report that
the light isn’t distracting when they aren’t looking to change lanes and that
checking to see whether the light is on before changing lanes quickly
becomes as natural as checking the mirrors. 
Figure 19-6: A blind-spot information system.
It’s a well-known fact that most side mirrors distort how close the vehicles
coming up in adjacent lanes are, and I carefully adjust my side mirrors and
rear-view mirror so that the moment a vehicle coming up behind me in the
next lane disappears from view in the rear-view mirror its front-end becomes
visible in the mirror on that side. I believe that modifications to side mirrors
should be a priority for automakers. Until we all have BLIS-equipped vehicles,
I urge you to never make a lane change unless you turn and take a swift peek
out the side window to see whether there’s someone dangerously close 
to you.

Camera
377
Chapter 19: Staying Safe on the Road

Drivers are warned about extensive blind spots on large trucks that make
smaller vehicles all but invisible to truck drivers. Hopefully, BLIS will help to
rectify that situation, especially if the federal government sees fit to mandate
it for use on commercial vehicles. Until then, watch for BLIS systems to
appear on a growing number of passenger vehicles. I hope every driver can
be in a state of BLIS before long!
A system is becoming increasingly popular on up-scale pickups, SUVs, and
large sedans that automatically tilts your side-view mirrors downward when
you back up to park so that you can see the curb or whatever else is along-
side the car. After the car is parked, the system automatically returns the 
mirrors to their original positions.
Brake-Shift Interlocks
A brake-shift interlock is a device that prevents the gearshift from being acci-
dentally shifted out of the Park position, which could allow the vehicle to
accidentally roll into danger. The device makes it impossible to move the
gearshift without simultaneously stepping on the brake pedal. Although
many vehicles already come with this as standard equipment, in 2006, in
response to a growing number of accidents involving children injured while
playing with gearshifts, NHTSA and 19 automakers agreed to have brake-shift
interlocks on all new vehicles by 2010.
Traction Control Systems (TCS)
Traction control systems (TCS) have been around, in one form or another,
for years (see Figure 19-7). The system senses when one or more wheels is
spinning faster than the others and attempts to prevent the vehicle from
going out of control. The problem can be due to a slippery surface but also
can occur when a vehicle with front-wheel drive is driven so hard that the
drive wheels don’t steer properly and lose traction.
Electronic traction control systems use the anti-lock braking system (ABS)
to sense and compare the speed of each wheel and automatically pump the
brake on a wheel that’s spinning faster than the others. (You can read about
ABS in Chapter 14.) Some TCS also decrease the power supplied by the
engine to the wheel or wheels that are slipping. On systems like these, the
accelerator pedal pulsates, much as the brake pedal does when ABS is
employed. Other forms of traction control that involve throttles and 
turbocharging exist, and more are being developed.
378
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

Figure 19-7: A traction control system.
Traction control is no substitute for snow tires or chains in icy or snowy
weather because it doesn’t increase traction — it just tries to keep wheels
that lose traction from spinning out of control.
Electronic Stability Control (ESC)
Making emergency maneuvers to avoid obstacles, taking turns at high
speeds, and cornering too sharply or too fast are some of the situations that
can cause your vehicle to veer from the path you expect to follow when you
turn the steering wheel. As a result, your vehicle either oversteers (turns
more radically because it’s sliding or spinning) or understeers (turns less than
you planned because it loses traction). Electronic stability control (ESC)
keeps your vehicle on the straight and narrow to prevent it from skidding
sideways, spinning out, or rolling over.
As you can see in Figure 19-8, ESC uses the wheel-speed sensors that enable
ABS and TCS. It also has a sensor that monitors the steering angle (the position
of the steering wheel) and compares it with the data from a rotation sensor
that monitors the yaw angle (how much the vehicle is rocking from side to
side) to see where the vehicle is actually going. Other sensors can measure
additional types of movement. With all this input, the vehicle’s ECU can

monitor how well your vehicle is responding to the position of the steering
wheel and, by activating the brakes on the proper wheels and modulating
power, correct the course of your vehicle so that you can go on your way safely.
Figure 19-9 shows how ESC works to correct understeering and oversteering.

To find out whether a particular vehicle is equipped with ESC, just enter 
the make, model, and year at www.iihs.org/ratings/esc/esc.aspx.
Because many automakers have trademarked their own names for their ESC
systems, you can find a list of them at money.cnn.com/2006/06/12/
Autos/esc_names/index.htm.
Don’t think that having an ESC-equipped vehicle means it will take care of you
if you drive carelessly. ESC doesn’t prevent accidents in normal stop-and-go
driving or at low speeds; it’s designed to go into action to help keep you from
losing control at high speeds or on slippery roads. And “help” is the key word:
ESC can’t prevent loss of control in every situation, especially if you’re driving
too fast! The terrible toll caused by vehicles going out of control has made
ESC a feature that drivers shouldn’t do without (see the nearby sidebar).
Rollover Stability Control (RSC)
The tendency of SUVs to roll over under conditions that were previously
thought safe has prompted the development of rollover stability control 
systems (RSC) that identify situations where a vehicle that is taking a turn
too sharply or too fast could roll over, and then help to prevent this from
happening. RSC employs the sensors and other components found on ABS,
381
Chapter 19: Staying Safe on the Road
Research makes a strong case 
for requiring ESC on all vehicles
When it comes to advocating ESC on all vehi-
cles, the following quote from the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) says it all:
“In Institute studies, ESC has been found to
reduce fatal single-vehicle crash risk by 56 per-
cent and fatal multiple-vehicle crash risk by 32
percent for cars and SUVs. Many single-vehicle
crashes involve rolling over, and ESC effective-
ness in preventing rollovers is even more dra-
matic. It reduces the risk of fatal single-vehicle
rollovers by 80 percent for SUVs and by 77 per-
cent for cars. If all vehicles were equipped with
ESC, as many as 10,000 fatal crashes could be
avoided each year.
“Federal studies also show large benefits. The
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) estimates the installation of ESC
reduces single-vehicle crashes of cars by 
26 percent and single-vehicle crashes of SUVs
by 48 percent. NHTSA estimates that ESC has
the potential to prevent 64 percent of the pas-
senger car rollovers and 85 percent of the SUV
rollovers that would otherwise occur in single-
vehicle crashes.”
The IIHS requires a vehicle to have ESC to earn
their “Top Safety Pick” status. Although a grow-
ing number of vehicles already come equipped
with ESC as standard or optional equipment (by
2007, the percentage of vehicles with ESC was
ten times higher than in 1998), all cars, SUVs,
pickups, and minivans built by the 2012 model
year will have to have it. 

TCS, and ESC, along with a roll-rate sensor and other modifications. To be
effective, RSC has to be sensitive enough to differentiate between critical 
situations and relatively harmless instability caused by variations in the 
surface of the road or roadside shoulders, or by uneven loads.
If the system senses a potentially hazardous situation, it applies pressure to
the brakes on the wheel or wheels on the vehicle closest to the outside of the
turn, which helps keep the inside wheels on the ground. First introduced as
an option on higher-priced vehicles, RSC is becoming available on more vehi-
cles as time goes on.
Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
Cruise control has been around for quite a while and is standard on most 
passenger vehicles today. However, adaptive cruise control (ACC) transforms
cruise control into a system that can be programmed to maintain a safe 
distance between your car and the vehicle in front of you and to provide 
protection if a crash seems imminent.
Adaptive cruise control is available on a growing number of vehicles, and 
systems vary from one automaker to another. Variations include the ability to
not only set the distance but also the minimum time gap to the vehicle 
ahead. Some systems employ a laser-based system called lidar (an acronym
for “light detecting and ranging”) and others use radar sensors to detect a
slower vehicle in front of you and adjust your speed accordingly. Each
system has its advantages and drawbacks: Lidar is less expensive but has a
shorter range and doesn’t operate as well in wet weather conditions that
require windshield wipers or if the vehicle ahead is too dirty to reflect light
properly. Radar is more expensive but doesn’t have these problems. At pres-
ent, radar seems to be more popular.
On ACC systems with forward collision warning (sometimes called collision
mitigation systems), if the driver ahead brakes suddenly, a flashing red light
can appear on your windshield along with an audible alarm. ACC systems
also may include collision warning with brake support (CWBS) that will pre-
pare your brakes for a panic stop. Additional features of ACC systems can
tighten seat belts and deploy air bags in critical situations.
Because of the high percentage of rear-end accidents, there’s strong support
for mandating that vehicles be equipped with ACC and other collision preven-
tion systems until your vehicle does most of the driving for you, staying in
lane and changing lanes at safe distances from surrounding vehicles and
obstacles and responding faster to critical situations than human drivers can.
I can hardly wait!

Telematics: How Cars Communicate
Telematics (a term derived from combining the terms “telecommunication”
and “informatics”) is the technical term for the wireless systems that enable
your vehicle to communicate with the outside world. The information
exchanged often involves GPS (global positioning systems) and can include
where you are and the best way to get where you want to go, your vehicle’s
speed and condition, where other vehicles in the vicinity are and how fast
they’re going, the nearest restaurant or gas station, instant traffic reports,
Bluetooth and other phone and instant messaging systems, music down-
loads, and other vital stuff. This section describes the most popular ways
that telematic systems can make driving easier and safer. Services provided
by individual systems overlap, so the telematic system in a particular vehicle
may combine the features of one or more of the following systems.
Navigation systems
Navigation systems have become increasingly popular as standard or optional
equipment and also are available as stand-alone aftermarket units that can
mount on the dashboard or above the windshield, and as part of in-dash
aftermarket stereo and DVD systems with pop-up or fixed display screens. 
All navigation systems are based on GPS technology that receives satellite
signals that determine your exact longitude and latitude. When you enter the
address of your destination or the name of a place of interest on a touch
keypad, a CD that’s loaded with street maps and installed in your vehicle
enables the system to determine the best route. Most systems allow you to
modify the suggested routes by stipulating that you don’t want to take free-
ways, go over bridges, or drive on unpaved roads, and offer you a choice of
the shortest, fastest, and other alternative routes.
These are the types of navigation features you may encounter:
 Built-in navigation systems provide spoken turn-by-turn directions
through the vehicle’s audio system as well as a choice of map displays
that enable you to zoom in or out, orient by the compass or the direc-
tion in which your vehicle is traveling, and so on. Most built-in systems
will locate a variety of establishments in a specific area, including restau-
rants, service stations, hospitals, police stations, parks, and other
places of interest.
 Aftermarket navigation systems vary from some that are little more
than a basic GPS to others that will provide oral directions and a full
spectrum of information.
 Navigation services have been incorporated into cellphones, PDAs,
computers, and other electronic devices. 
383
Chapter 19: Staying Safe on the Road

Tracking systems
Tracking systems employ a combination of GPS, cellular, and other electronic
technologies to enable a vehicle to communicate its location and condition to
an outside source. Tracking systems are used to locate stolen vehicles; moni-
tor the location of every vehicle in a commercial fleet; and enable worried
parents to keep track of where their kids are driving, how fast they’re going,
and whether seat belts are engaged. 
Tracking systems have been criticized for “spying” on people, just as every
device that incorporates GPS technology (including cellphones) has come
under suspicion that it may be used by “Big Brother” to keep an eye on
everyone’s whereabouts. At least this invasion of privacy is currently
optional and can help you keep track of your kids and recover a stolen car!
Following are good examples of the range of telematic tracking services 
available. I’m not endorsing them, as they each have competent competitors.
For a comparison of the features of various telematic services go to
www.edmunds.com/media/editorial/telemetrics/popout.html.
OnStar
OnStar was the first widely available telematic system in North America. It
uses a combination of GPS, cellular technology, voice recognition, and
MapQuest data to connect you with its Call Center and provide you with a
variety of services. OnStar enables you to communicate verbally with live
and virtual advisors, get directions, report an accident or a flat tire, or
announce that you need the doors unlocked for you. In an emergency, your
vehicle can communicate its position and condition with no human assis-
tance at all! Sensors that report that air bags have been deployed activate an
automatic message that the vehicle has been in an accident, and even if
nobody in the vehicle is able to communicate verbally, the service can call
911 and send help. Additional options can include automatic diagnostics and
hands-free access to e-mail, weather reports, and stock quotes. Most major
domestic and international automakers now offer systems similar to OnStar,
so factor this in when deciding which vehicle best satisfies your needs and
budget.
LoJack
LoJack is a tracking system that offers two packages that can work together
or separately. If you report that your vehicle has been stolen, LoJack’s Stolen
Vehicle Recovery System inaudibly transmits a unique code connected to the
vehicle’s unique VIN as well as the present location of the vehicle to police
cruisers with tracking computers within a 25-mile range. LoJack claims a 
90 percent recovery rate, and the system qualifies for a deduction on some
insurance policies. LoJack’s Early Warning Recovery System alerts you when
your vehicle is being moved without your permission by sensing that some-
one who isn’t carrying LoJack’s Key Pass is at the wheel.

A
s you work on your vehicle, you’ll get to know it better. Before long,
you’ll become more sensitive to its signals. If something sounds funny
or smells funny or just doesn’t feel right, you’ll soon sense it. This can help
you forestall expensive repairs because you’ll be able to prevent trouble or
deal with it before it becomes a major problem. And if something does need
repair, being able to report symptoms accurately will save your mechanic
time — and you money.
If you really want to diagnose symptoms professionally, you can buy an elec-
tronic diagnostic code reader, or, better yet, a scan tool that plugs into a
Diagnostic Communications Link (DCL) mounted under the dashboard of
most modern vehicles. Do-it-yourself versions cost from $60 to about $400.
They read any trouble codes the on-board diagnostic program (OBD) has rec-
ognized and translate the codes into problems you can look up in a repair
manual for your vehicle to see what’s involved in buying the part and replac-
ing it yourself.
For those of us who aren’t that ambitious, this chapter shows how to use
your eyes, ears, and nose to sense automotive symptoms, and it tells you
how to deal with them.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.

Sounds
You probably know how your vehicle sounds when it’s running properly, and
your ears can alert you to anything that sounds strange. Well, tune in to what
your ears are telling you! If you hear a strange or different sound, pay atten-
tion to it and react accordingly.
 If a fan belt or accessory belt “sings” (you hear a high-pitched squeal
that stops when you shut off your engine), readjust or replace the belt.
These belts should have about 1⁄2 inch of play and shouldn’t be frayed,
cracked, or glazed on the underside. Some belts tend to sing more than
others. You can find instructions for adjusting and replacing belts in
Chapter 12.
Don’t drive with a broken belt. If you carry a spare belt, you may be able
to save yourself towing charges if you know how to replace it. Replacing
a serpentine belt at roadside is difficult. You’d need a tow, but at least
you wouldn’t be stranded until a new belt could be obtained.
 If your radiator “sings” (you hear a continuous high-pitched sound
that may continue after the engine’s shut off), check the radiator 
pressure cap. The rubber gasket may be worn, and steam from the hot
engine may be escaping past it. Chapter 12 tells you how to remove a
radiator cap safely.
 If something ticks rhythmically while your engine idles, shut off the
engine, wait ten minutes for the engine to cool down and the oil to settle
in the oil pan, and then check the oil level, following directions in Chapter
2. The hydraulic lifters that operate the valves in your engine can make
these ticking noises if you’re down as little as a quart of oil. If the level is
low, add oil up to the “Full” line on the oil dipstick and check it again in a
couple of days. If you have enough oil, have a mechanic check the valve
adjustment if your car has adjustable valves (some don’t). Faulty valves
can seriously affect your vehicle’s performance and fuel consumption.
 If you hear a loud tapping or knocking sound in your engine, pull to
the side of the road immediately and call for road service. The source
may be just a loose rocker arm or carbon buildup inside the engine, but
if it’s a loose bearing or a faulty piston, letting it go unheeded can
destroy the whole engine.
Mild knocking or “pinging” may be the result of using fuel with the wrong
octane rating. Check your owner’s manual to see whether your vehicle
needs low-octane or premium fuel. Most newer vehicles can automati-
cally adjust to a higher or lower octane than they were designed for. But
even though you may not hear pinging if you put regular gas in a vehicle
that’s supposed to use premium, you probably won’t get the best perfor-
mance. And putting premium in a vehicle designed for regular fuel only
makes the oil company wealthier.

Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

 If you hear the engine running after you turn off the ignition, your
engine is dieseling. This condition only happens to cars with carbure-
tors. It is usually caused by an idle speed that’s set too high or excessive
carbon in the combustion chamber that ignites unburned fuel in the
cylinders.
 If you hear a whistling noise coming from under the hood, check the
hoses for vacuum leaks. If the whistling comes from inside the vehicle,
there’s probably a leak in the weatherstripping. Patch the weatherstrip-
ping according to the directions in Chapter 24.
 If the engine idles with an offbeat rhythm, it isn’t displaying musical
talent; it’s probably misfiring, and one of the spark plugs or spark plug
wires may be at fault. Try the following:
• With the engine off, check the spark plug cables for breaks or
shorts in the wiring.
• With the engine off, remove the spark plugs one at a time and check
to see if they’re clean and properly gapped. Replace any that are
fouled or burned. Chapter 6 shows you how to do all this spark
plug work.
If attending to the spark plugs doesn’t help, have a technician check the
ignition system with an electronic engine analyzer. (People used to
check spark plugs by holding the end of the spark plug cable close to a
metal surface to see whether a spark jumped across when the engine
was cranked, but the high voltage in most ignition systems now makes
that procedure extremely dangerous.)
 If the idling is rough but even, have a technician put your vehicle on an
electronic diagnostic machine to check it, or check the compression in
each cylinder yourself, following the instructions in Chapter 8. If the
engine needs to be rebuilt, you may prefer to get another engine — or
another vehicle.
An easy way to determine whether your engine is idling evenly is to
place a stiff piece of paper against the end of the tailpipe while the vehi-
cle is idling (with the parking brake on, please). Doing so amplifies the
sound and enables you to hear the rhythm. A misfiring cylinder comes
through as a pumping or puffing sound. An even but rough idle is a clue
that you may need to have your fuel injection system checked out by a
mechanic with electronic diagnostic equipment.
 If your car sounds like a “Mack truck” or makes some other loud, 
abnormal sound, a hole in the muffler is probably the cause. Replace it
immediately: Traffic cops hate noisy mufflers, and carbon monoxide
hates people!

Chapter 20: Troubleshooting Leaks, Squeaks, Smells, and Strange Sensations

 If the horn is stuck, your vehicle is producing what may be the worst
noise it can make. Before this happens, have someone honk your horn
until you can locate it under your hood. There are usually two horns,
and each one has a wire leading to it. If your horn gets stuck, pull these
wires to stop the noise (see Figure 20-1) — sometimes you have to pull
only one. When you take your car to a service facility to have the horn
fixed, tell the mechanic that you pulled the wires, and find out why the
horn got stuck. If you can’t get at the horn wires, pull the fuse that goes
to the horn to stop the noise. Another way to quiet things down fast is to
disconnect one battery terminal. Of course, your vehicle won’t run with
the battery terminal disconnected, so this is just a short-term measure
until you can fix the horn or help arrives.
 If you hear a sound but can’t locate the source, get an old stetho-
scope from a medical supply house or your family doctor. As shown in
Figure 20-2, take off the rubber disc and insert a piece of tubing in its
place (about 11⁄2 inches will do). Then put the plugs in your ears, run 
the engine, and move the tube end of the stethoscope around the hood
area. The stethoscope amplifies the sound as you near the part that’s
causing it.
A wooden broomstick works the same way. Place one end on the bone
behind your ear and place the other end on the parts that seem to be
the source of the noise.
 If your tires squeal on curves (and you aren’t speeding), check their
inflation pressure, treads, and alignment by using the instructions in
Chapter 17.
 If you hear whining or humming sounds on curves, your wheel bear-
ings may be wearing. Chapter 15 turns you on to the sensual thrill of
repacking them with your bare hands.
Figure 20-1: If your horn gets stuck, pull a wire to silence it.
388
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

 If your tires “tramp” (they make a
weird, rhythmic sound as you drive),
check inflation, tire wear, and wheel bal-
ancing (see Chapter 17).
 If you hear squealing when you step on
the brake, you’ve probably worn the
brake pads down too far. Get them
replaced immediately. Some disc brakes
are naturally noisy, and others have
built-in wear sensors that squeal when
it’s time to replace the pads. But if the
sound gets louder, have the brakes
checked or follow the instructions in
Chapter 15 and check them yourself.
If you have drum brakes, brake linings
that are glazed or worn can cause them
to squeal, as well.
 If you hear rumbling noises coming
from under or toward the rear of the
vehicle, the trouble could be a defective
exhaust pipe, muffler, or catalytic con-
verter; or it could be coming from a
worn universal joint or some other part
of the drive train. Have a service facility
put the car up on a hoist and find the problem.
 If you hear clunking under your vehicle, especially when you go over a
bump, check the shock absorbers and suspension system. If the sound
is toward the rear, your tailpipe or muffler may be loose.
Squeaks, Rattles, and Vibrations
If you hear suspicious squeaks, rattles, or vibrations, you may be able to save
yourself some money by checking and tightening the following items before
seeking professional help:
 Loose screws and bolts: Check both inside the vehicle and under 
the hood.
 Rearview and side mirrors
 Dashboard knobs and trim
 Sound-system speaker grills
 Window and door cranks and locks
389
Chapter 20: Troubleshooting Leaks, Squeaks, Smells, and Strange Sensations
Figure 20-2: A piece of tubing 
and an old stethoscope make an
efficient troubleshooting device.

 Ashtray and other storage compartments: Are they empty? Do the lids
fit snugly?
 Glove box: Is the door shut tight? Is anything in the glove box rattling
around?
 Wheel covers or hubcaps: Remove them and check inside for pebbles.
 Outside trim
 Trunk: Is something you’ve stashed in there moving around?
If none of these is the culprit, or if the noise persists, have a repair facility
find the cause. Often, something inside the vehicle vibrates sympathetically
because another part of the vehicle is running roughly.
If your car squeaks like an old taxi, especially when you drive it on a bumpy
road, it may just need lubrication. However, the problem may be worn shock
absorbers or struts, suspension ball joints, or broken stabilizer links (see
Chapter 16).
You may get used to the squeaks and groans, but because they’re caused by
parts rubbing together or moving without the proper lubrication, they indi-
cate wear that can damage your vehicle. Obviously, action is required.
Smells
The only odors you should smell inside your vehicle should come from
smelly things that you’ve put in it: the takeout lunch that you bought at a
drive-through, the perfume that your 6-year-old squirted all over herself, your
not-so-freshly groomed dog who’s pressing his nose against your recently
washed windows. You can get rid of persistent odors easily by using a spray
that eliminates odors rather than masking them. But if you smell any of the
items in the following list, take immediate action to correct it:
 Do you smell rubber burning under the hood? One of your hoses may
have come loose and landed on a hot part of the engine. Rescue it before
it melts through.
 Do you smell something burning with the hood closed? Feel your
wheels. If one is hot, a brake shoe or pad may be dragging, or you may
have left the parking brake on. If neither of these checks out, an over-
heated clutch of a manual transmission car may be the cause.
 Do you smell oil burning (a thick, acrid odor)? First check the oil dip-
stick by following the directions in Chapter 2. Your oil pressure gauge
may be lying, and you may be running out of oil. Or your engine may be
overheating, and your temperature gauge may be broken. If neither is
the case, look around the engine for oil leaking onto the engine block or
390
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

exhaust manifold. If the oil situation seems to be okay, check the trans-
mission fluid dipstick. Sometimes a faulty vacuum modulator can
siphon the fluid out of the transmission and feed it to the engine, where
it’s burned. Also, if the transmission fluid is very low, it can be burned in
the transmission because the gears aren’t lubricated enough and are get-
ting very hot.
 Do you smell oil or exhaust fumes in the passenger compartment? The
cause could be burned oil from the engine area, but it also could be a
faulty exhaust pipe under the car that lets exhaust gases into the vehi-
cle through the floorboards.
Exhaust fumes contain carbon monoxide, so if you smell oil or exhaust
inside the car, be sure to keep your windows open at all times and have
the problem checked out as quickly as you can. People have died from
inhaling carbon monoxide or from passing out at the wheel because of
it. Although the exhaust of most post-1995 vehicles is so clean that a bad
headache is probably the worst you can get, have it checked anyway. It
never pays to take chances.
 Do you smell something sweet and steamy? Take a look at the tempera-
ture gauge or light on your dashboard to see whether your engine is
overheating. Chapter 12 tells you how to cool things down.
 Do you smell rotten eggs? The smell is probably coming from the cat-
alytic converter, which is part of the exhaust system. The converter
may be malfunctioning, or you may have a problem with your engine.
 Do you smell burned toast (a light, sharp odor)? Unless you’ve brought
breakfast with you, it may be an electrical short circuit, or the insulation
on a wire may be burning. Check around under the hood. Driving is a bit
risky, so either get to the nearest service station or have roadside 
service come to you.
 Do you smell that “new car smell” in your new vehicle? It may be due
to toxic emissions from the materials and adhesives used in the passen-
ger compartment. If your vehicle smells strongly of these, until the odor
dissipates, consider opening the windows or running the air conditioner
while you drive.
 Do you smell gasoline? If you just had trouble starting the car, the
engine may be flooded. Wait a few minutes and try again. If the smell
comes from under the hood, check your fuel injection system or carbu-
retor to make sure that it isn’t leaking fuel. Also check your fuel pump
(if it isn’t hidden inside your fuel tank). Leaking gasoline will wash a
clean streak across it, which can be seen with the naked eye. Then check
all visible fuel lines and hoses that lead to the fuel tank. If they’ve
rotted or are disconnected, you’ll smell fuel vapors without seeing any
leaks. Taking a look under the vehicle after it has been parked overnight
may help, but remember that fuel evaporates quickly, so the clues may
be stains rather than wet spots.
391
Chapter 20: Troubleshooting Leaks, Squeaks, Smells, and Strange Sensations

Obviously, you shouldn’t smoke while you check for a fuel leak! But
then, you never should smoke when you’re working on your vehicle.
Gasoline ignites easily, and gasoline vapors can explode, so if you smell
gasoline — and you didn’t just fill your tank — find the source of the
leak and have it repaired immediately. If your usual repair facility isn’t
close by, either drive to the closest garage and have them repair it or
call your auto club and have them tow the vehicle to a repair facility.
Smoke
If you see smoke coming from your tailpipe, pay attention to the color for
clues to the cause of the problem:
 If you see white vapor on a cold morning, disregard it if it stops after
the vehicle warms up. If it continues after the engine is warm, a cracked
engine block or cylinder head or a leaky head gasket may be letting
coolant into the engine. You need professional help with this one.
 If you see black smoke and you drive an older vehicle with a carbure-
tor, the fuel/air mixture may need to be adjusted to a leaner setting or
the carburetor float may have absorbed gasoline and is flooding the
engine.
Black smoke from a vehicle with fuel injection usually requires special
diagnosis and should be left to a repair facility.
Check to see whether the fuel/air mixture on either type of vehicle is too
rich by running your finger around the inside edge of the tailpipe (first
make sure that it’s not hot). If carbon comes off on your finger, the mix-
ture is probably too rich.
 If the smoke is light or dark blue, the vehicle is burning oil, which can
indicate that oil is leaking into the combustion chambers and you may
need to have your valve stem seals replaced or your engine rebuilt or
replaced.
 If the smoke is light gray, the car may be burning automatic transmis-
sion fluid. Check the transmission dipstick following the instructions in
Chapter 2. Is the fluid dark and burned-looking? Does it smell burned? If
so, changing the fluid may solve your problem.
A faulty transmission vacuum modulator, as found on very old cars,
also can suck transmission fluid into the engine, where it’s burned in the
cylinders and causes light gray smoke to come out of the tailpipe. Have
the mechanic check the problem.
392
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

There is hope . . . being low on transmission fluid can cause the same
symptoms as a transmission that needs servicing, repair, or replace-
ment. To avoid paying for work that your vehicle may not need, be sure
to read Chapter 18 before you opt for major transmission surgery.
Leaks
Pay close attention to leaks. Running a vehicle that’s drastically low on a vital
fluid can cause severe damage. After you find the source of the leak, the fol-
lowing information will help you decide whether you can handle it yourself or
you need professional help.
If water is getting into your vehicle’s passenger compartment, check the
rubber gaskets and weatherstripping around the windows, doors, and sun-
roof, and refer to Chapter 24 for instructions on how to fix it.
Unless your vehicle has a protective shield under the engine area, here’s an
easy way to see whether anything is leaking out from under your vehicle and
a few pointers to help you decide what to do about it:
1. Park your vehicle overnight on a clean patch of pavement or a large,
clean piece of white paper.
Either tape some sheets of paper together or buy a roll of plain white
commercial wrapping paper. Newspaper is too absorbent and can
change the color of the stains.
2. Place marks on the paper to show where each of the four wheels is
resting, and indicate the front and rear ends of the vehicle.
3. In the morning, move the vehicle and look for small puddles or traces
of liquid on the ground or paper. Touch and smell each puddle or
trace of liquid.
Here’s how to decipher the evidence:
 If it’s clear, watery, and under the air conditioner, it’s probably just
normal condensation if you’ve used the air conditioner recently.
 If it’s black or dark brown, greasy, and located under the engine area,
it’s probably oil. Figure out which part of the vehicle was over the spot:
Look under the hood around the oil filter and the engine and under the
vehicle for leaks around the oil drain plug, the crankcase, and the oil
pan below it.
 If it’s thick, black or tan oily liquid, gear oil may be leaking from a
manual transmission, the differential, an axle, or the steering gears.
Any of these leaks needs immediate attention.
393
Chapter 20: Troubleshooting Leaks, Squeaks, Smells, and Strange Sensations

 If it’s red, pink, reddish-brown, and greasy and you have an auto-
matic transmission, it’s probably transmission fluid. Check the trans-
mission dipstick (see Chapter 2), and if the level is low, top it off with
the proper transmission fluid. Then check the dipstick again in a day or
two. If it’s low again, have a professional check the transmission to make
sure that the seals are intact.
 If it’s watery or slippery; green, red, blue, or yellow; and is coming
from under the radiator or engine, it’s probably coolant. To check the
radiator, pressure cap, engine, and hoses for leaks, turn to Chapter 12.
Coolant is toxic to children and animals, so leaks need to be remedied
quickly. If you can’t locate the source of the leak or your vehicle is losing
coolant on a regular basis, consult a mechanic.
 If it’s oily; pink, red, or clear; and you find it toward the front bumper
(usually on the driver’s side), it’s probably power-steering fluid. The
power-steering system is sealed and shouldn’t lose fluid. Chapter 2 tells
you how to check the dipstick. If the level is low, add more and check
again in a couple of days. If it’s low again, have a mechanic check things
out. The good news is that electronic power steering systems eliminate
the need for fluid entirely; Chapter 16 describes them.
 If it’s a light-colored or clear fluid, it may be brake fluid. Even if the
leaks have dried, the stains should be visible. Depending on which part
of the car was parked over the puddle or spot, check for brake fluid
leaks around the master cylinder and around the brake lines. If the
leak is where a wheel was standing, check down the inside surface of
that wheel. If you find stains or wetness there, the brake cylinder could
be leaking — or a dog could have “marked” your tires!
Leaky brakes are too dangerous to leave unattended. Have a profes-
sional repair any brake fluid leaks immediately.
 If it smells like rotten eggs, it’s battery acid. Avoid getting it on your
hands or clothes and have the battery replaced.
 If it smells like gasoline, it probably is! (If you drive a diesel, get to
know what diesel fuel smells like so you can identify it.) If the smell is
coming from under the hood, check around the fuel pump and the fuel
injectors — or the carburetor if your vehicle still has one. If the leak
seems to be under the center of the vehicle, check the fuel lines. If it’s
under the rear end, check the fuel tank. (Don’t smoke while you do
this!)
Gasoline ignites easily, and gasoline vapors can explode, so if you smell
gasoline — and you haven’t just filled your tank — find the source of the
leak and have it repaired immediately. If your usual repair facility isn’t
close by, either drive to the closest service station and have them repair
it, or call your auto club and have them either fix it on the spot or tow
the car to a repair facility.
394
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

If you can’t locate the source of the leak and your vehicle is losing liquid from
the radiator on a regular basis, Chapter 12 can help you find the leak and
check your radiator pressure cap.
Strange Sensations
This is a catchall category for those things that just “feel funny.” Use the
process of elimination to check anything that may cause your vehicle to run
roughly: hoses, tires, brakes, oil levels, spark plug connections, the cooling
system, clutch, gearshift, and steering linkage. (The book’s index can steer
you toward the chapters that include instructions for checking these things.)
Here are a few specific sensations that you may encounter:
 If steering is difficult and you have power steering, see “Check the
power-steering fluid” in Chapter 2 for information about checking the
power-steering dipstick. If it’s low again soon after you fill it, check for
leaks in the hoses leading from the unit to the front wheels.
 If your car starts wandering instead of running in a straight line, the
cause may be worn steering components or wheels that are out of align-
ment. If the vehicle starts pulling to the left or right, one of the tires may
be underinflated or faulty, or the front end may be out of alignment.
Look for the solutions to these problems in Chapter 16.
 If your car pulls to one side when you step on the brake pedal,
Chapter 15 tells you how to check your brakes.
 If your vehicle vibrates at highway speeds, the wheels may need to be
balanced.
 If the engine speeds up but your vehicle doesn’t accelerate when you
step on the gas pedal; if there’s a delayed response (or none at all)
when you shift gears; or if shifting suddenly becomes awkward or
noisy, check the transmission (see Chapter 18). If you have an auto-
matic transmission, you may just be low on transmission fluid, or
you may have a disconnected hose or plugged filter.
If you seek professional help, make sure that they check the problems
that are cheapest to remedy before deciding that you need major trans-
mission work!
If you notice anything strange when your vehicle’s running, I strongly suggest
that you do the under-the-hood check in Chapter 2. This easy, 15-minute
monthly checkup can prevent 70 percent of the problems that could cause
your vehicle to break down on the highway. By checking for symptoms of
trouble in advance, you can save yourself time and money that otherwise
would go to towing and repairs.

Chapter 20: Troubleshooting Leaks, Squeaks, Smells, and Strange Sensations

Directional Signals
Directional signals are vitally important for communicating your intentions to
other drivers. If the signals malfunction, they should be fixed immediately —
hand signals just don’t do the job. Here’s what to do in a variety of situations:
 If all your directional signal lights don’t go on, check the fuse. Chapter
6 has instructions for finding your fuse box and replacing fuses.
 If all your directional signal lights go on but don’t blink, your flasher
unit is bad. This unit usually plugs directly into the fuse box, so look for
trouble there first. After you replace the bulb or fuse that’s defective, the
dashboard flashers go back to normal. Isn’t that lovely?
 If both signal lights on one side don’t go on, check to see whether the
bulbs need replacing. If they don’t, the signals may not be grounded
properly. Your mechanic can tell you whether this is the case.
 If there’s no light on your dashboard when you move your directional
signal lever, either the bulb on your dashboard flasher is out or the unit
is malfunctioning.
 If one signal light is flashing faster or slower than the others, check to
see whether the bulb is the proper one for your vehicle. A heavy-duty
bulb will flash faster than a standard bulb. Also check for loose connec-
tions or corrosion around the socket the bulb fits into.
Be sure to replace burned-out bulbs at once. They usually cost very little, and
changing them involves little labor. Headlights are more expensive because
they have to be replaced as a unit (see Chapter 6 for instructions).

hether your vehicle dies on the road or in front of your house, it’s
always a time of unrivaled panic and stress. But an informed, well-
organized approach to diagnosing your sick monster’s ills can pay off by get-
ting you moving again with a minimum loss of time, money, and composure.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Getting Off the Road Safely
If you have reason to believe that your vehicle is having a problem, try to get
to the right-hand shoulder of the road as soon as possible, especially if you’re
on a highway. Very often, if a vehicle is going to do its swan song while in
motion, it will give you a couple of hints first. If you can recognize those hints
as signs of impending disaster, you’ll be able to get out of traffic before the
car dies completely.

All the following symptoms are good reasons to head for the side of the road
immediately:
 Your vehicle experiences a sudden loss of power, or you suddenly have
to floor the accelerator to maintain speed or to keep moving at all.
 A warning light comes on.
 Your engine suddenly runs roughly.
 The engine is misfiring.
 You hear unfamiliar noises.
 Your vehicle is pulling to one side.
 The pavement hasn’t changed but your tires are no longer rolling along
smoothly.
 You have a flat tire.
As you pull your vehicle off the road, keep the following safety procedures 
in mind:
 Try to coast along the shoulder until you’re well away from any
curves in the road behind you. This placement pays off when you’re
ready to get back onto the road because you can spot oncoming traffic
before it’s on your tail. And if you’re on a narrow road, try to park away
from curves ahead as well so that you’ll see what’s coming at you when
it’s time to drive away.
 If the engine dies right on the highway and you can’t get off the road,
don’t get out of the car! I know that sitting in a dead vehicle with traffic
piling up behind you is unnerving, but attempting to cross a high-speed
freeway on foot is suicide.
Just think good thoughts and surround the car with white protective
light (every little bit helps!), and, most importantly, stay calm. If it’s after
dark, put the interior light on so that you’re more visible. If the engine is
operable, keep it running so that you don’t run the battery down.
Most heavily traveled highways are also heavily patrolled, and a nice
highway patrol officer will be along before you know it. When the officer
is on the scene, it’s a simple matter of stopping traffic long enough to
push your vehicle to the right-hand shoulder.
Whether you’ve managed to park at the side of the road or you’re stuck in a
traffic lane, take these additional safety precautions:
 Roll down the window on the driver’s side, hang out a white cloth or
piece of paper, and roll the window back up to secure it in place. The
cloth or paper alerts drivers that your vehicle is in trouble and that they
should proceed around you. If you can easily reach the passenger-side
398
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

window without getting out of the car, do the same on that side. Just try
not to obstruct your ability to see out the windows.
 If you know that you’re going to need roadside assistance, use your
cellphone to call your auto club or the highway patrol. If you’re read-
ing this and you don’t have a cellphone, resolve to get one immediately;
it’s the best protection against getting stuck in these situations and
against carjackers. If you don’t otherwise need a cellphone, get a low-
cost one without a contract that lets you just pay as you go.
If you have no phone, you’re not stuck in a highway traffic lane, and you
can see an emergency call box only a few feet away, use the call box to
call for help, get right back in the car, and lock the doors. If no call box is
nearby, you’re probably better off just hanging the white cloth or piece
of paper out the window and waiting for the highway patrol to spot you.
In these days of daytime carjacking, walking along the highway alone
can be dangerous. So is opening the door to what appear to be good
Samaritans. If someone stops to help, just roll down the window an inch
or two, thank them for their help, and ask them to phone the highway
patrol or the AAA or CAA (if you’re a member) and report your location.
 To avoid being hit by a passing vehicle, never work on your vehicle
from the side that’s exposed to traffic. If you can, drive farther off the
road to a safe, well-traveled place, and try to reach into the trouble area
from the front or the side that’s away from traffic.
 If it’s daylight, put on your emergency blinkers or your left-turn signal
to alert oncoming traffic to the fact that your vehicle isn’t moving.
This is not a good idea at night because motorists coming up behind you
may think that your vehicle is still rolling along the highway and run
right into the rear end of your car. (Drunk drivers are especially prone to
this sometimes fatal error.)
 If it’s nighttime and you’re not stuck in traffic, quickly place warn-
ing lights or reflective markers about six feet behind the vehicle to
alert traffic, and then get back in the car. If you don’t have lights or
markers, either turn on the interior lights manually or leave the car door
that’s away from traffic open so that the interior lights stay on. Don’t
worry about running down the battery; the tow truck will either haul
you away or jump a start if you need one.
 To alert oncoming traffic, always carry reflective markers, a large bat-
tery-operated light, or a couple of milk cartons filled with wax and a
wick in the trunk of your vehicle. (I don’t suggest carrying flares
because they can be dangerous.) Forewarned is forearmed!
 If you get a flat tire, do not attempt to change it unless you can get to
the side of the road and the tire is on the side of the vehicle that’s
safely away from traffic. Even then, I’d think twice about exposing
myself to possible carjackers.
399
Chapter 21: What to Do If Your Car Drops Dead or Won’t Start

Because driving on a flat tire for any longer than it takes to park safely
can destroy the tire, you need to replace it close to where it went flat.
This is another reason subscribing to roadside service is a good idea!
If you have a flat tire in a place where no help is available, or if you’re in
your driveway or garage, you can find complete instructions on how to
change a flat tire in Chapter 1.
Troubleshooting the Problem
If you’ve managed to get off the road and into a safe area, and you want to 
try to deal with the situation yourself, it helps to view what happened in
“dietary” terms: Your vehicle lives on a mixture of air, fuel, and fire — if it
won’t go, it’s not getting one of those ingredients.
Air
Air is simple — and probably not the problem. Your vehicle gets its air
through the cold air collector box, or air cleaner. Unless the air filter inside
it is totally clogged, your engine should be getting enough air to keep it going.
In a worst-case scenario, something has gone amiss with your engine control
unit (ECU) and it’s keeping air from mixing properly with the fuel. If that’s the
case, a “Check Engine” light should be glowing on your dashboard and the
best you can do is call a tow truck and get to a repair shop. But the problem
is most likely something else: One of the vacuum hoses may have become
disconnected, or your PCV valve may be malfunctioning, either of which
could keep your car from breathing properly. To troubleshoot the problem,
do the following to check the hoses and the PCV valve:
 Look at all the hoses under the hood. Have any of them become discon-
nected or broken? Do you hear air whistling while the engine idles — if it
can? One strategic lost hose can slow or stop your engine. If this is the
case, reclamp the wanderer or tape the hole and you’ll soon be on your
way. Of course, if you make a habit of checking and replacing worn
hoses before disaster strikes (see Chapters 2 and 12), you can avoid this
trouble completely.
 Check your PCV valve to make sure that it’s clear and functioning. The
“Servicing the PCV Valve” section in Chapter 8 can help you to do so.
400
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

Fuel
Whether your vehicle runs on gasoline, has a diesel engine, or is a hybrid or
an alternatively fueled vehicle, it may not be getting whatever fuel it needs
to keep it going. Therefore, if the engine turns over but doesn’t start running,
the first question you need to answer is whether your fuel tank is empty.
Even if your fuel gauge says that you still have some fuel, the gauge may be
on the blink. When did you last fill the tank?
No matter how nervous you are, never smoke when working on a vehicle,
especially if you’re dealing with the fuel system!
Sometimes the problem is too much fuel. If you open the hood and find that
everything is covered with gasoline, don’t try to start the engine! Gasoline is
too flammable to monkey around with. Just hoist that white flag and get help.
If you’re not out of fuel and your vehicle lost power before it died, fuel is
probably not getting to the engine. The following sections offer additional
reasons that specific types of vehicles may not be getting enough fuel.
Gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles
If you have a modern vehicle with a multiport or sequential fuel injection
system, either the fuel pump isn’t pumping fuel or the ECU isn’t triggering
the fuel injectors. In either case, a professional will have to troubleshoot it.
Ethanol, methanol, and flex-fuel vehicles
The potential problems are the same whether the vehicle is running on pure
gasoline or on gasoline mixed with alcohol in one form or another: Either
you’re out of fuel no matter what the fuel gauge tells you, or the fuel pump or
fuel injectors aren’t working properly. In any case, there isn’t much you can
do but call for help and be patient until it arrives.
Electric vehicles
If an electric vehicle suddenly stops running, the battery that drives it (the
big one, not the little guy under the hood) has run out of juice. Either you’ve
driven too long without recharging it or the system is malfunctioning.
Dashboard malfunction indicator lights should alert you to this problem
before the vehicle stops completely.
If a cable that conducts the current from the battery to the motor has dis-
connected, don’t try to deal with it yourself. You can’t trace the cable to or
from the motor to the battery, and the voltages are so high that you could
put yourself in danger if you try to reconnect any loose cable or wire you
find. Get the vehicle towed to a repair shop that can handle battery-powered
electric cars and trucks, and let them do the job.
401
Chapter 21: What to Do If Your Car Drops Dead or Won’t Start

Hybrids
Hybrids combine a gasoline engine and an electric motor. If a hybrid vehicle
suddenly stops running, the systems are too sophisticated to try to trou-
bleshoot yourself, and don’t expect the tow truck operator to be able to trou-
bleshoot or repair it. Because being pulled by a tow truck can damage your
hybrid, request a flat-bed tow truck to get the vehicle to the nearest dealer-
ship that sells your vehicle and let them deal with it.
Natural gas, hydrogen, fuel cells, and other exotica
Natural gas and hydrogen are stored under great pressure and are definitely
too dangerous to monkey with yourself. If your vehicle operates under any of
these systems, request to be towed by a flat-bed truck to your nearest dealer-
ship because most service stations aren’t able to deal with these fuel sources
either.
Fire
If you think that your engine is getting enough air and fuel, you’re probably
having ignition system trouble. As I explain in Chapter 4, on traditional vehi-
cles the “fire” is really electric current that’s stored in the battery, replaced
by the alternator, monitored by sensors, and directed by the ECU to the
spark plugs in the cylinders at the proper time. If something along the way
goes wrong and the spark fails to reach the plugs, all the air and fuel in the
world won’t produce combustion in the cylinders, and the vehicle won’t go.
Because the engine was running before it died, it’s probably not the fault of
the battery, solenoid, or starter.
If just one spark plug suddenly malfunctions, the engine will continue to run
on the other cylinders. It won’t run smoothly, but it will get you off the road
and into a repair shop.
If your car has an electronic ignition system, the ignition module may
have gone bad. Because these vehicles have high-energy ignition systems
that operate at 47,000 volts or higher, the old technique of pulling a distributor
or spark plug cable to test for a spark is unsafe. Whether the vehicle has a dis-
tributorless ignition system or has an electronic ignition, you need to have
a professional check it out. The good news is that these systems aren’t prone
to breaking down, so they probably aren’t the problem. Chapter 5 gives you a
good view of how both systems work.
402
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

If your vehicle is an older model with a non-electronic ignition system, you
can check the distributor cap to see whether the spark is getting from there
to the coil and on to the spark plugs.
As you can see, unless you’re out of fuel, most modern vehicles that drop
dead on the road just can’t be dealt with on the spot. In addition to the
causes I’ve already addressed, sometimes part of your engine has given out.
If it’s the transmission, or some other part that’s really expensive to replace,
you may be saying good-bye to Old Faithful if its blue book value is less than
the cost of parts and labor. On the bright side, the sophisticated systems in
most modern vehicles are relatively trouble-free; you usually have plenty of
warning before they give up the ghost. Of course, if you haven’t checked and
maintained your vehicle properly — if you’ve ignored the malfunction indi-
cator lights, the knockings, the smoke from the tailpipe, the hesitations, and
the other symptoms that I cover in Chapter 20 — well, you asked for it.
Handling a Vehicle That 
Overheats on a Hot Day
It’s rare with modern vehicles, but even the happiest, most beautifully tuned
vehicle can overheat (nobody’s perfect). If you find yourself in stop-and-go
traffic or climbing a steep grade on an extremely hot day, and your dash-
board temperature indicator starts to rise or a malfunction indicator light
comes on, here’s how to help your vehicle regain its cool:
 At the first sign of overheating, shut off your air conditioner and open
your windows. Doing so decreases the load on the engine and helps it
cool off.
 If you continue to overheat, turn on the heater and blower. Doing so
transfers the heat from the engine to the passenger compartment of the
vehicle. (This does wonders for your overheated engine but very little
for you!)
 If you’re stopped in traffic and the temperature gauge is rising, shift
into Neutral or Park and rev the engine a little. Doing so makes the
water pump and the fan speed up, which draws more liquid and air
through the radiator. The increased air and liquid circulation helps cool
things off.
 Try not to ride your brakes. In stop-and-go traffic, crawl along slowly,
on little more than an idle, rather than moving up and then braking
repeatedly. Brake drag increases the load on the engine and makes it
heat up. If traffic is crawling, move up only when the gap between you
and the vehicle in front of you gets too large.
403
Chapter 21: What to Do If Your Car Drops Dead or Won’t Start

 If you think that your vehicle is about to boil over, drive to the right-
hand side of the road, open the hood, and sit there until things cool
off. Remember, don’t open the radiator cap under these circumstances,
and if your engine has boiled over, don’t add water until the engine is
quite cool again.
If you must add water when the engine is still a little warm, add the
water slowly while the engine is running in Neutral or Park. Follow the
instructions at the beginning of this chapter to park where you can
safely get out and open your hood. Then, to avoid the possibility of
burning yourself, follow the instructions in Chapter 12 for opening a
radiator pressure cap and adding liquid to the system safely.
Overheating When It Isn’t Hot Outside
Although hot weather is the most common cause of overheating, many other
factors can cause the same problem. If your vehicle overheats in traffic in
normal weather, one of the following may be the culprit:
 The water and coolant level in the radiator is low. If you haven’t checked
your fluid level in a while (or ever), check it now, either by looking at the
level through the side of the coolant recovery system or by following the
instructions in the “Check the Coolant” section in Chapter 2.
 There’s a leak in the cooling system. Chapter 12 has an entire section
that explains where to look for leaks in various parts of the cooling
system and what to do after you find them.
 If you can’t locate any leaks, your thermostat may be malfunctioning.
Obviously, you can’t replace the thermostat at the side of the road, but
Chapter 12 has instructions for doing so cheaply and easily when you’re
safely back home. In the meantime, if you can park and get to the ther-
mostat safely, you can eliminate this malfunction as a possibility. Wait
until the engine cools down completely, and use those instructions to
remove the old thermostat and reconnect the hoses without it. If the
engine starts up and runs well without the thermostat, the old one was
probably screwing up the works.
Get a new thermostat immediately if you find that your old one isn’t
working. Driving for long distances without a thermostat can damage
your engine.
 If none of these seems to be the problem and your vehicle continues
to overheat, check out Chapter 12 for other possible causes and their
solutions.
404
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

If Your Vehicle Won’t Start
Consider those panicky times when your vehicle won’t start (they’re definitely
on my “Top Ten List of Lousy Situations!”). If you left your lights, heater, radio,
or some other electrical gizmo on after you parked the car and turned off the
engine, you know what the trouble is: Your battery is dead. The last section 
of this chapter, “Jumping a start,” explains the safest way to jump-start your
vehicle.
Of course, there are other possible reasons that your vehicle won’t start. The
next section lists them.
Won’t-start symptoms
Your conventionally fueled vehicle may not start for a number of reasons.
The following list outlines the most common circumstances and tells you
what action you can take to try to remedy each situation:
 The car is silent when you turn the key in the ignition. Check the bat-
tery terminal cable connections (see Chapter 2). If they look really cor-
roded, you need to clean the battery posts and cable connectors or
replace the cables, following the instructions in Chapter 2. Reattach the
cable connectors to the battery, making sure they are firmly in place.
Now try again to start the engine.
 The car makes a clicking noise but won’t start. This sound usually
means a dead battery. If not, check the wiring to and from the starter for
a loose connection.
 The engine cranks over but won’t start. You may be out of fuel, or the
fuel isn’t getting to your engine (see “Fuel” earlier in this chapter). If it’s
not a fuel problem, the electrical spark isn’t getting through to the spark
plugs (see “Fire” earlier in this chapter).
 The engine starts but dies. If you have fuel injection, you need profes-
sional help.
 The car won’t start on rainy days. If you have a non-electronic ignition
system or an electronic ignition with a distributor cap, check inside
the cap for dampness.
Be sure the ignition is off and the vehicle is in Neutral or Park before you
raise the hood and remove the distributor cap.
405
Chapter 21: What to Do If Your Car Drops Dead or Won’t Start

If you find moisture, get some mechanic’s solvent from your friendly
service station — they use it to clean car parts — or buy an aerosol can
of it at an auto supply store. To evaporate any dampness inside the dis-
tributor cap, turn the cap upside down and pour or spray some solvent
into it. Swish it around and pour it out. Then dry the cap as best you can
with a clean, lint-free rag, and replace the cap.
Use only clean solvent; even a tiny speck of dirt can foul the points.
Gasoline won’t do because a spark can ignite gasoline fumes and cause
an explosion or a fire.
 The car won’t start on cold mornings. If you have fuel injection, you
need to have a professional diagnose the cold-start problems. 
 The engine misses while idling. The spark plugs may be misfiring (see
Chapter 6), the fuel pump may be malfunctioning, or the fuel filter may
be clogged (see Chapter 8).
 The engine misses or hesitates during acceleration. There are several
reasons why this may happen: It could be faulty spark plugs, dirty fuel
injectors, or a malfunctioning ECU. Some do-it-yourselfers buy diagnostic
computers and learn to read the trouble codes, but chances are it will
turn out to be something you won’t want to undertake yourself. It’s easiest
to have a service facility put the vehicle on the “scope” and deal with it.
 The engine is knocking or pinging. In older gasoline-powered vehicles,
this usually was caused by using fuel with the wrong octane rating. In
modern vehicles, the ECU senses engine noise and adjusts the timing,
fuel/air mixture, and other factors to handle octane differences. Still,
because using fuel with the wrong octane rating can affect your vehicle’s
health and performance, if you aren’t sure whether it should be running
on regular unleaded or premium gasoline, check your owner’s manual. If
you have the right fuel and you want to track the problem down your-
self, checking the cooling system (see Chapter 12) and doing a compres-
sion check on the engine cylinders (see Chapter 8) may reveal the
answer.
Jumping a start
If your battery has died, you may be able to use jumper cables to jump a start
from some good Samaritan’s vehicle — with some important exceptions.
If either vehicle has an electronic ignition system or is an alternatively
fueled vehicle, the use of jumper cables may damage it. If your vehicle is one
that may be damaged in this way, you may find a warning to that effect in the
owner’s manual or on a decal under the hood. Even if you don’t find a warn-
ing, it pays to be safe, so call the service department at your dealership and
ask about your vehicle’s make, model, and year.
406
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

If you can safely use jumper cables on your vehicle, make sure that the bat-
tery on the good Samaritan’s vehicle has at least as much voltage as your
own. As long as you hook up the cables properly (and the proper way is the
same in every case), it doesn’t matter whether your vehicle has negative
ground and the GS’s vehicle has positive ground, or your vehicle has an
alternator and the GS’s vehicle has a generator.
To safely jump a start, follow these steps:
1. Take out your jumper cables.
It’s a good idea to buy a set of jumper cables (see Chapter 3 for tips) and
keep them in the trunk compartment. If you don’t have jumper cables,
you have to find a good Samaritan who not only is willing to assist you
but who has jumper cables as well.
2. Place both vehicles in Park or Neutral, with their ignition switches
shut off and their parking brakes on.
3. Connect the cables.
The positive cable has red
clips at either end, and the
negative cable has black
clips. It’s important to attach
them in the proper order:
1. Attach one of the red
clips to the positive
terminal of your bat-
tery (it has “POS” or
“+” on it, or it’s bigger
than the negative 
terminal).
2. Attach the other red
clip to the positive ter-
minal of the GS’s car.
3. Attach one of the
black clips to the 
negative terminal on
the GS’s battery.
4. Attach the last black clip to an unpainted metal surface on your car
that isn’t near the battery. (I usually use one of the metal struts
that holds the hood open.)
Figure 21-1 shows how both the positive and negative cables should be
connected.

4. Try to start your vehicle.
If it won’t start, make sure that the cables are properly connected and
have the good Samaritan run his or her engine for five minutes. Then try
to start your car again. If it still won’t start, your battery may be beyond
help.
5. Disconnect the cables, thank the good Samaritan, and resume 
your life.
If the jump works and your car starts, don’t shut off your engine! Drive
around for at least 15 minutes to recharge your battery. If the car won’t
start the next time you use it, the battery isn’t holding a charge and
needs to be replaced.
If your alternator warning light stays on or the gauge on the dashboard con-
tinues to point to “Discharge” after your car has been running, make sure that
your fan belt or accessory belt is tight enough to run your alternator prop-
erly. If your battery keeps going dead, have a professional check both the bat-
tery and your alternator.
In any case, never drive around with a malfunction indicator light on 
or a gauge that reads in the danger zone; have the vehicle checked out 
immediately — that’s why those lights and gauges are there!

When All Else Fails: Finding and
Dealing with a Good Mechanic
In This Chapter
 Choosing the type of service facility that’s right for you
 Paying attention to the certification of the mechanic and/or shop
 Evaluating automotive service facilities and deciphering a mechanic’s invoice
 Maintaining a good relationship with a repair shop
 Getting satisfaction on any complaint
You just moved and your trusted former repair facility is too far away. Or
you bought a new set of wheels, and your old shop doesn’t work on that
particular type of vehicle. You haven’t the faintest idea of where to go when
your vehicle requires service that’s beyond your abilities, or where to get
help in an emergency. The phone book is full of ads, but how can you tell
which shops are reliable and which are just waiting to take advantage of you?
Relax, dear friend; you’ve come to the right place for advice.
In this chapter, I tell you how to find a good service facility, give you tips for
establishing a good relationship with one, and provide you with a winning
strategy for getting satisfaction on any type of consumer complaint.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Choosing a Service Facility
Several kinds of shops repair and service vehicles: dealerships, chain stores,
specialists, and independents. How do you decide which is the right shop for
you? Each has its drawbacks as well as its advantages. The following sections
describe each of these service options so that you can choose the type that’s
best for you.

Of course, the type of facility you select may vary depending on the kind of
specialized service your vehicle requires. If you drive a hybrid or other alter-
natively fueled vehicle, it’s probably best to stick to the dealership. If you
drive a traditionally powered vehicle, you may be able to depend on an expe-
rienced independent for the best deal on reliable, competent service at a
good price. You may find the best buys on tires at a major chain and the best
brake or transmission work done at shops that specialize in them. See the
section “Finding a Reliable Service Facility” for more information.
Dealerships
When they buy a new vehicle, many people assume that they have to use the
dealership’s service facilities, at least until the warranty period is over. Be
aware that, in most cases, you can have warranty service (but not repairs)
done by any licensed independent mechanic as long as all the service
requirements in your owner’s manual are fulfilled and you’ve kept the
invoices for service and maintenance to prove it. (There are some excep-
tions, so read your warranties before going elsewhere for specialized work.)
Of course, you may want to stay with the dealership that sold you the vehicle
because dealerships may offer the following advantages:
 They often provide extra services to ensure goodwill. These can
include notification of any maintenance that’s due, special sales on serv-
ice and optional equipment, and so on.
 They usually have a variety of factory-trained specialists on the prem-
ises. The advantage is that you may be able to have brake work, trans-
mission work, and sometimes even bodywork done at the same place.
 They stock a wide variety of original parts and equipment (OEM)
made specifically for your vehicle. This not only assures you of satis-
faction if parts fail, but original parts may increase the resale value of
your vehicle.
 If you have a complaint, you’re dealing with an established company
that’s financially able to reimburse you and that’s insured to cover
any major lawsuits that may result.
However, dealerships have disadvantages to consider as well:
 Dealerships may be more expensive than other types of service facili-
ties. Independent shops usually have a lower overhead to support.
 The sales and service departments of a dealership often operate as
separate entities. The attitude may be, “We have more work than we can
handle, so if you’re not happy here, you can go somewhere else.” If you
feel that’s the case, complain to the dealership.
410
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

 You probably won’t receive the personalized service that you may get
from an independent repair shop. At the dealership, you generally deal
with a service writer who assigns your vehicle to the next technician
available when its number comes up. Of course, if you build a good rela-
tionship with the service writer, he or she may honor your request for a
specific technician who’s familiar with your vehicle and its quirks.
Chain and department stores
Large chain stores and department stores that have automotive service
departments offer their own set of pros and cons. Some advantages include:
 They can be less expensive than dealerships.
 They usually stock a wide variety of parts, many of which are made to
their specifications and carry their brand name. How these parts com-
pare in price and quality to the original equipment supplied by the car
manufacturer varies, depending on which chain you deal with.
The only time you absolutely don’t want to use anything but original
equipment is when you’re restoring a classic car or if there are no reli-
able aftermarket parts available.
 They usually provide good guarantees on parts and labor. And if you
have a complaint, they’re generally motivated to keep your goodwill.
 Large chain stores maintain branches nationwide that honor their
warranties and guarantees. If you move or travel frequently, this feature
can be very beneficial.
Chain and department stores also have their disadvantages, including the 
following:
 They use service writers, and the work tends to be impersonal, with a
new technician working on your vehicle each time.
 Technicians at some chains get a commission on the parts they sell.
This may motivate them to sell you a new part instead of repairing an
old one, or to perform work that your vehicle may not really need.
Here’s a feature of large chains that has both positive and negative aspects:
They’re good training grounds for inexperienced technicians who are just out
of school and are working at their first professional jobs. If it falls into incom-
petent hands, your vehicle may turn out to be a guinea pig as well as a gas
hog. On the other hand, it may be lucky enough to be tended to by bright,
enthusiastic young people with all the latest knowledge and techniques at
their fingertips.
411
Chapter 22: When All Else Fails: Finding and Dealing with a Good Mechanic

Independents
An independent service facility can offer the best — or the worst — alterna-
tive. Consider these points:
 Honest, reliable, and experienced independents can provide person-
alized service based on high standards of excellence. They can offer
you the opportunity to communicate directly with a professional who
knows you, knows your vehicle, and cares a great deal about maintain-
ing a good reputation because most independent business comes from
referrals.
 Many independent shops are less expensive than dealerships. Others,
especially those that service only luxury cars or high-performance
sports cars, may offer the finest workmanship at relatively exorbitant
rates. A cherished few provide fine workmanship at low prices — these
people are probably saints disguised in greasy coveralls!
 Check carefully to be sure that the shop is reliable and able to do the
job. Expertise, the ability to stay current by attending classes held by
automakers (who sometimes bar independents from enrollment), the
availability of specialized tools and service manuals, and the variety of
parts in inventory may vary from one independent shop to another. A
good independent knows where to find the proper talent, borrow the
tools, and buy OEM parts at a good price. An unreliable one patches
things together, uses cheap parts, and hopes for the best.
Specialists
There are two types of specialists: One type is a specialized chain store or
independent facility that deals with a specific kind of repair, such as brake
work, transmission work, bodywork, or muffler replacement. The other type
of specialist is an independent shop that works only on specific makes or
vehicles, such as Ferraris, Volvos, motorcycles, or classic cars.
Here are the pros and cons to consider:
 A reliable specialist can provide the experience, specialized tools, and
extensive inventory that may be unavailable at a shop that handles
everything in general and nothing in particular. If you know that the
trouble with your vehicle resides in a particular automotive system, you
may want to look for a well-established specialist who focuses on that
type of work.
412
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

 Some specialized chains that sell and install cheap parts may be more
interested in selling new parts than in repairing old ones. Their life-
time guarantees may keep you coming back to pay more for the labor 
to install those “free” replacement parts than you’d spend initially on
higher-quality parts that last longer.
Check out national chains that specialize in the type of repair you need
in consumer publications such as Consumer Reports (www.consumer
reports.org) to be sure that the one you choose has a good reputa-
tion for durable parts and quality service.
Finding a Reliable Service Facility
Several organizations test, rate, and certify good service facilities or individ-
ual technicians. If you’re unsure about a particular shop, you can feel pretty
secure if you see a sign posted in the shop or a patch on a technician’s uni-
form that indicates that the shop or the individual has achieved recognition
from one of the following programs:
 AAA (American Automobile Association) or Canadian Automobile
Association (CAA) Approved Repair Facilities: Both the AAA and the
Canadian Automobile Association have rating programs for auto repair
shops. Representatives from these organizations visit and evaluate serv-
ice facilities to make sure that they meet high standards for reliable work
at a fair price, willingness to resolve complaints, and a history of few
complaints. To qualify, shops must provide customers with written esti-
mates of all costs and offer a minimum warranty on parts and labor of 12
months or 12,000 miles (12 months or 20,000 kilometers in Canada).
In most cases and with some exceptions, both the AAA and the CAA are
willing to arbitrate disputes between members and approved shops if
negotiations between the shop and the member aren’t successful.
To find an Approved Repair Facility in your area, look for the AAA or
CAA logo on display at a shop, contact your local or regional association
office, or visit www.aaa.com or www.caa.ca to find contact information
for national headquarters.
If you’re a member of one of these clubs and you have an unresolved
complaint about an approved shop, contact the Approved Auto Repair
Service Program at your local auto club or its national headquarters.
 ASE (National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence) Certified
Technicians: The ASE certifies technicians (not individual shops) by
testing them on a variety of automobile repair specialties, including
brakes and transmissions. ASE-certified automotive technicians and
other service professionals can be identified in several ways: the blue
and white ASE Blue Seal of Excellence sign displayed by a facility, the
413
Chapter 22: When All Else Fails: Finding and Dealing with a Good Mechanic

ASE certificates earned by their technicians displayed in the office or
waiting room, or the ASE shoulder patch on a technician’s uniform. To
obtain a list of ASE-certified technicians and/or Blue Seal businesses in
your area, visit www.asecert.org.
 ADS (Association of Diesel Specialists): If you own a diesel-powered
vehicle that’s out of warranty and you’re looking for a reliable diesel
mechanic, look in your local yellow pages under “Automobile Repair &
Service” for a shop that displays the ADS logo. ADS-authorized shops
must send their technicians to factory schools to keep abreast of new
parts, techniques, and systems; must meet high standards for cleanli-
ness; and must stock sufficient tools and parts to deal efficiently with
most diesel repair and maintenance jobs. To obtain a list of authorized
shops, visit www.diesel.org.
 ASA (National Automotive Service Association): The ASA advances pro-
fessionalism and excellence in the automotive repair industry through
education, representation, and member services. For a list of ASA
member shops, look for the ASA logo in your local yellow pages under
“Automobile Repair & Service” or visit www.asashop.org.
 Service and achievement awards: Check out the framed certificates
hanging in the facility manager’s office. Reliable facilities often receive
awards for customer service excellence. Also look for certificates
awarded to individual technicians who have completed factory-training
programs that qualify them to operate specialized electronic equipment
and for grateful letters from satisfied customers.
 Better Business Bureau: Check with your local Better Business Bureau
(www.bbb.org) to find out whether a shop has been the subject of
numerous consumer complaints.
 Referrals: I’ve always felt that the best way to find a good mechanic is
the same way you find a doctor, lawyer, or plumber — through referrals.
Ask people who drive the same make vehicle as you do where they go
for repairs, and then check out the shops that are conveniently located.
Evaluating a Facility
A quick way to do a preliminary check on an auto repair facility is to call a
shop and ask for its basic prices on regular maintenance jobs for the make
and model vehicle you drive — ask about flushing the cooling system and
changing the oil and oil filter, for example. Also ask what the hourly labor
rate is and whether the shop uses OEM (original equipment manufacturer)
parts for your particular vehicle.
414
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

Before you need service, follow up a positive phone interview with an unan-
nounced visit to gather answers to the following questions:
 Is the place clean and well-organized or filthy and cluttered? Auto
repair is a trade that calls for patience and precision. If the shop is
sloppy and disorganized, the work may be, too.
 Does the shop have modern electronic diagnostic and testing equip-
ment? Up-to-date machines save time (and your money) by pinpointing
trouble areas and checking adjustments and tolerances. Ask if shop tech-
nicians attend factory schools and seminars run by manufacturers to
learn how to use the more sophisticated analyzers and if they keep up-
to-date on new systems.
Modern vehicles require sophisticated, specialized, diagnostic computer
equipment, sometimes specific to the make and model of vehicle. Find
out whether your vehicle is in that category. If it is, you may have to take
it to your local dealership for any work involving computer-controlled
functions.
 Does the shop have the necessary tools to do your job? Ask whether
any part of the job will have to be sent out to a specialist. If so, ask if the
shop will only charge you what the specialist billed them, or if the shop
will increase the charge to compensate themselves for the time and
effort involved in delivering the vehicle to the specialist and picking it
up afterward.
If the entire job has to be done by an outside specialist, consider taking
the vehicle there directly instead of having your shop serve as a middle-
man. Avoid conflicts with your service facility by saying that you want
another estimate.
 What form of payment does the shop accept? The advantage of using a
credit card is that in the event of a dispute, you can withhold payment
until the credit card company investigates the situation.
 How long does the shop guarantee its repairs? Guarantees usually
range from one month to one year. If a shop doesn’t think that its work
will endure for at least three months, go elsewhere.
 Can the shop provide references? Most shops allow you to call a few of
its customers who have the same vehicle to see whether they were satis-
fied with service.
Find out how the shop determines the price you pay for repairs. The answer
has a great impact on your wallet as well as on the quality of the work.
 By the clock: Any type of automotive repair facility may determine the
cost of a job by multiplying a fixed hourly labor rate by the time it took
to complete the work. This simple system encourages technicians to
take the time to do their best work. However, this system makes it diffi-
cult to accurately estimate what the job will cost because unexpected
technical problems can raise the price significantly.
415
Chapter 22: When All Else Fails: Finding and Dealing with a Good Mechanic

 Pre-established price lists: Specialists and major chains such as brake,
muffler, and transmission shops often set fixed prices for specific jobs.
Sometimes several basic services are combined into one package. Prices
are easy to understand and usually are competitive. You don’t pay more
if the job goes slowly.
 Flat rates: Most shops base their prices on the Flat Rate Manual, which
lists every job that can be done and the amount of time it should take to
accomplish the job on a specific vehicle. Estimates are accurate because
they aren’t affected if a job takes longer than normal. However, you may
be charged for the amount of time listed in the manual no matter how
little time the work actually takes. Few shops will keep a technician who
can’t “beat the book” by a substantial amount of time, so mechanics may
skimp and cut corners to complete repairs as quickly as possible.
 Variable flat rates: Some dealerships price jobs not only by the Flat Rate
Manual but also by the level of skill necessary to do the work properly.
Maintenance jobs usually are priced at a lower rate than more sophisti-
cated repairs. You aren’t penalized if the job takes longer than expected.
 Flat rates and parts commissions: At many chains or department stores,
the mechanic shares in the profits on the sale of parts. You aren’t penal-
ized if the job takes longer than expected, but you may have to pay more
for a new part that could have been repaired cheaply and easily, or for
parts that you never needed in the first place.
Getting the Best Possible Deal
A big repair job is like major surgery: Not only do you want the best possible
surgeon, but you also want to be sure that the surgery is necessary and that
it’s done under the best possible terms. Consumer laws in many states hold the
repair facility responsible for failing to provide a written estimate, failing to
notify the customer if the estimate increases radically because more problems
have been uncovered, and failing to turn over parts that have been replaced
when the customer has asked that they be saved. Because this may not be the
case in your state, follow these guidelines whenever you bring your vehicle in
for maintenance or repair, or to a shop you haven’t patronized before:
 If you’re dealing with a new shop or you’re faced with major repairs,
get at least a second opinion and an estimate of costs from another
repair shop. If there’s a big discrepancy, or if it’s a very costly job, get a
third estimate and discard any that are much higher or lower than the
others.
 Ask for detailed, written estimates and updates. Require the shop to
call you before they start the repairs if they find that the job will cost
more than originally estimated. Beware of general statements; try to get
as detailed an estimate as possible.
416
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

 If major work is underway, ask to be notified about what they find
right after they open the vehicle up to diagnose the problem. Will it be
a simple adjustment or a major rebuild? Ask to be called if that estimate
changes because the shop uncovers other problems during the course
of the estimated repairs.
 Save yourself from paying for unnecessary R&R (which means
“removal and replacement,” not “rest and relaxation!”). If the techni-
cians have to open the transmission or the cylinder head or get into the
engine or any other hard-to-get-at area in order to make a repair, ask
them to check the whole area for any other parts that look as though
they’re about to need repair or replacement. A good chunk of the cost
for labor is usually associated with just taking stuff apart and putting it
back together again, so if the shop has to do removal and repair only
once, you save money.
 Don’t give the shop carte blanche to replace anything they please.
Tell them that you will want to see how badly the parts are wearing
before they proceed with any unauthorized work, and call around for
estimates before you agree to additional major surgery if you feel that
the price the shop quotes is out of line. (However, keep in mind that
you’ll have to pay the new shop for R&R, as well.)
 Ask that all the parts that are replaced be returned to you, regardless
of whether the laws in your state require it. That way you can be sure
that you’re getting what you pay for.
 Ask for credit for the core charge on any rebuildable part that’s going
to be replaced. Always ask what the shop will do with your old part. If
they’re going to rebuild and resell it or sell it to a rebuilder, the core
charge should be deducted from the price of the part that you buy to
replace it.
Now go home, cross your fingers, and wait for the operation to be over. Of
course, you may still be ripped off, but you’ll know that you’ve done every-
thing possible to prevent that from happening. And because you’ve been so
diligent and are so familiar with the parts and systems involved, you just may
scare a potential cheat into doing a good job and charging you properly for it.
If, despite all your precautions, you end up getting ripped off anyway, the
“Complaining Effectively” section later in this chapter shows you how to get
satisfaction on any type of complaint.
Always check the invoice carefully
When you bring a vehicle into a service facility, you receive an original
invoice with information identifying your vehicle, listing the work they plan
to do, and an estimate of what it will cost. When the work is finished, they
will give you a final copy of this invoice that lists the actual work done and
417
Chapter 22: When All Else Fails: Finding and Dealing with a Good Mechanic

the cost of the labor and parts it required. This section tells you what to look
for when you receive the original, estimated invoice and how to understand
the final bill.
Make sure that the original invoice for the job includes a written guarantee
on parts and labor, and find out whether any of the parts installed comes
with its own warranty. (This is especially important if it’s a big job that
involves expensive parts.) Knowing just where the responsibility lies in the
event of a dispute or a malfunctioning part always pays off.
A standard mechanic’s invoice is divided into separate areas, each of which
serves a different purpose. To decipher an invoice, match the number pre-
ceding each of the following items with the corresponding number on the
invoice shown in Figure 22-1:
1 Description of the work: This area should list each job that needed to
be done. When you pick up your vehicle from the shop, check this area
item by item to see that everything was taken care of.
2 Labor charges: These charges are shown in fractions of an hour. If a job
seems to have taken an excessively long time, ask to check the Flat Rate
Manual, which is a listing of every job that can be done on a vehicle,
with the amount of time it should take to accomplish it.
If the hours seem right, multiply them by the shop’s hourly rate to make
sure that the math is correct. Then check that the labor total is the same
as that shown in the Totals column 5.
3 Parts used: Each part should be listed with its price. Make sure that the
costs have been added correctly and that the total is the same as that
shown in the Totals column 5.
4 Subcontracted repairs: This area should show all the work that was sent
out of the shop to be done by a specialist. The total costs should be
repeated in the Totals column 5.
5 Totals: All the charges in the previous sections are repeated and totaled
separately in this column. You pay the final figure.
In addition, every invoice should have a space for a written estimate 6 and a
phone number 7 where you can be reached if necessary. You’ll be asked to
sign the estimate on the signature line 8 when you receive the original esti-
mated invoice, before the work begins.
Be sure to read the small print above the signature line before you sign. The
small print should cover only your approval of the estimate and the fact that
you’re willing to allow the technicians to drive your vehicle in order to test,
diagnose, and repair it.

Chapter 22: When All Else Fails: Finding and Dealing with a Good Mechanic

The reverse side of the invoice often contains information about the shop’s
warranty and the mechanic’s lien, which allows service facilities in some
states to sell your vehicle if you refuse to pay for services. For this reason, if
a dispute occurs, you should always pay your bill and then seek restitution.
As I mention earlier in this chapter, credit cards really come in handy in these
situations. To find out how to get satisfaction regarding a dispute, turn to the
“Complaining Effectively” section later in this chapter.
Establish a good relationship 
with your service facility
Finding a mechanic who’s reliable, honest, intelligent, efficient, and relatively
inexpensive isn’t enough. You should aim for “most favored customer” status.
After you discover an outstanding automotive shop, the ball is in your court
when it comes to establishing a good and lasting relationship that will have
them going out of their way to make you happy. Even though most small busi-
nesses are struggling to stay alive these days, a good independent service
facility is an exception. Every outstanding one that I’ve encountered has had
more business than time to deal with it.
When I moved to a new city and needed someone I could trust to do major
work or emergency surgery on Honeybun, my precious little classic car, I had
to beg a highly recommended specialist in classic Mercedes to take me on as
a customer. Only the facts that I had restored Honeybun myself and promised
never to bother him with maintenance got him to agree. We became good
friends, in no small part because I faithfully followed these guidelines:
 Call for an appointment. Don’t just show up and expect the shop to
drop everything and take care of you.
 Get your vehicle into the shop early (by 8:30 or 9:00 a.m. at the latest)
if you hope to get it out the same day. Allow sufficient time to give the
technician or service writer a full account of what you want done or
what you’ve found to be wrong with the car.
 Bring along a written list of the things you want serviced or repaired.
Include a phone number where you can be reached if questions arise or
if the work is going to cost more than the original estimate.
 On your list of what should be serviced or repaired, be as specific as
possible about the symptoms you’ve experienced. This is of great use
to the technicians who work on the vehicle. Help them out even more by
clarifying what is happening, when it happens, and where the trouble
seems to be located.
420
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

To give you an idea of what kinds of things to look for, important symp-
toms include:
• Warning lights and abnormal gauge readings
• Abnormal changes in acceleration, braking, mileage, steering, and
fluid levels
• Drips, leaks, odors, vibrations, and smoke signals
• Any change in the sounds the vehicle makes when starting up, on
the road, or coming to a stop
• Unevenly or prematurely worn belts, tires, and hoses
If you can provide enough information to help the shop diagnose the
trouble easily, you won’t have to pay for test drives and electronic diag-
nostic procedures that may cost more than the simple adjustments or
repairs that are necessary.
 Provide the clearest information you can regarding all the symptoms,
but do not diagnose the problem yourself! If you tell a shop that your
vehicle needs a specific job done on it, then that’s the work that will be
done, and you’ll pay for it whether the vehicle needed it or not. If you
want to inquire whether the trouble might be caused by a malfunction in
a specific part, then do so but keep it in the form of a question. The final
diagnosis must be up to the repair shop so that it can be responsible if
the diagnosis turns out to be wrong.
 Keep a maintenance record on your vehicle and bring a photocopy
for the shop’s records if it didn’t perform the past maintenance. I pro-
vide a blank Maintenance Record, as well as a Specifications Record for
basic information about a vehicle that will come in handy when shop-
ping for parts, in Appendix B at the back of this book.
 Don’t press to get the job done fast unless you’re really in a bind. A
great way to take the pressure off everyone is to ask whether the shop has
a spare vehicle, or loaner, that you can borrow until you get yours back.
 Call to make sure that your vehicle is ready before you make the trip
to pick it up. If it isn’t ready, try to be understanding (unless the shop is
chronically slow about getting work done). If it’s a matter of parts that
were ordered but not delivered on time, there’s little that the shop can
do about it. If there’s a delay simply because the shop is overbooked
with work, be polite but firm about your need to get the vehicle back as
soon as possible.
 When the vehicle is ready, ask what was wrong and what was done to
repair the problem. Enter the details on your Maintenance Record for
future reference. These records are also assets when you sell your 
vehicle.
421
Chapter 22: When All Else Fails: Finding and Dealing with a Good Mechanic

 Be prepared to spend a little time test-driving to be sure that the job
has been done to your satisfaction. You’re better off returning immedi-
ately with your complaints than showing up several days later, after any
number of things may have happened to mess things up.
 Show your appreciation for a job well done. A phone call to the man-
ager means a lot to a service facility, but a letter that the shop can 
display, praising a technician’s work, is even better.
If you know that your favorite independent technician likes a particular
beverage or snack, arrange your pick-up for the end of the day, and
bring that treat along in a paper bag. If you’re lucky, you may be invited
to stay and share it. I’ve received some of my most valuable tutoring
strolling around a shop after working hours, cold beverage in hand,
while my mechanic expounded on the secrets of his art.
Complaining Effectively
Even if you follow all my advice about finding good service facilities and stay-
ing on the best of terms with them, there’s still a chance that someday you’ll
get into a dispute. If you’ve maintained a good relationship with a shop,
they’re likely to be cooperative about redoing work that fails to correct a
problem, replacing defective parts that they’ve installed, and the like.
If you approach the shop assuming that the people there are going to treat
you fairly and honestly, chances are that they will. If you attack immediately
on the assumption that they’re out to get you, you put them on the defensive
and make things much harder for yourself.
Getting satisfaction on any complaint
I learned the following technique from an excellent human-potential trainer,
and I pass it on to you. It’s based on this “Golden Rule”:
THE BEST WAY TO GET WHAT YOU WANT IS TO MAINTAIN A FRIENDLY ATTITUDE
IN ALL DISPUTES — AND REFUSE TO BE SWAYED FROM YOUR PURPOSE!
Follow these steps to get satisfaction when dealing with any kind of dispute:
1. Before you contact anyone, decide exactly what you want done.
Presenting a specific plan for remedial action is much more powerful
than waiting passively for someone else to decide what they’re willing to
do for you.
422
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

2. Time your campaign carefully.
Don’t call just before lunchtime or closing time. Someone who’s hungry
or eager to get home won’t want to spend a lot of time trying to help you.
Try calling 24-hour customer-service numbers in the middle of the night.
Chances are they’ll be grateful for a bit of diversion.
3. Approach the proper person in a friendly way, assuming that he or
she wants to do everything possible to settle the issue fairly.
To find out which person to approach, see the next section, “Climbing
the complaint ladder.”
4. Open with a bit of friendly conversation.
The key is to establish a relationship as human beings. If possible, get on
a first-name basis. Most complaint personnel have been trained to deal
with suspicion, anger, and aggression. Very few are taught to expect
friendliness, trust, and compassion. When they encounter it, the battle
tactics they’ve been taught are useless.
5. Clearly state the problem and what you’d like the person to do about it.
Tell your story as though you were talking to a sympathetic friend, with-
out blaming anyone. Keep it as short as possible, and don’t cloud the
issue with unnecessary details.
6. Be prepared to back up your request with as much documentation as
possible.
This is why it’s so important to keep maintenance records, invoices,
guarantees, and warranties. If you’re asked to document your case,
never part with your originals; just send copies. It’s foolish to place your
strategic weapons in the hands of a company that has everything to gain
by “losing” them!
7. Listen patiently to the person’s responses without interrupting.
If he or she gives you a hard-luck story to explain negligence or inability
to give you satisfaction, be sympathetic. Showing that you care about
the person’s problems will encourage him or her to care about yours.
8. In a friendly fashion, keep reiterating your problem and what you
want done to rectify the situation.
Say things like, “Gee, that’s really a problem. I know how hard it must be
to deal with something like that — and what can you do to help me?” Be
reasonable. If the person can’t do exactly what you suggest, be willing to
consider other alternatives as long as the problem is resolved.
9. Encourage the other person to see the problem through your eyes.
Say, “Jim, put yourself in my place. How would you like to schlep your-
self to work on the bus for a week only to find that your car still doesn’t
work when you pick it up and won’t be ready for another ten days?”
423
Chapter 22: When All Else Fails: Finding and Dealing with a Good Mechanic

10. If the person says that he or she can’t help you, ask who has the
authority to do so, and get your call transferred.
11. If you’re told that it’s company policy not to provide a remedy for
your problem, stay cheerful — but refuse to accept it.
Kid the person out of it. (“Oh, come on, Charlotte, there has to be some-
one who can take this load off your shoulders. I’m sure your company
wants to deal fairly with its customers, so who has the power to ‘temper
justice with mercy’?”)
12. Repeat the process with every person you’re referred to. Keep repeat-
ing it until you get satisfaction.
This combination of friendliness, sympathy, and inflexibility really pays off. I’ve
seen people go out of their way to help me after they realized that I expected
them to be compassionate and creative people who could remedy the situation
and that I cared about the difficulties they may have in doing so. So try it. What
can you lose? You can always bring out the big guns as a last resort!
Instead of calling Customer Service, go directly to the Cancellations depart-
ment. Most companies arm Customer Service agents with many ways to deny
you what you want, but they give the charmers in Cancellations every oppor-
tunity to keep your business. That’s why Cancellations is sometimes called
Retentions.
Climbing the complaint ladder
It’s usually good policy to take an auto repair complaint first to the person
you dealt with and then work your way up to higher levels of power, if neces-
sary. Going over someone’s head rarely pays off unless that person has
proven to be unsympathetic or unable to help you.
However, if the lower echelons fail to give you satisfaction, it pays to jump to
the highest authority you can. Even if “The Big Boss” sends your complaint
back down the ladder, it will have come from the Executive Suite — and the
“underlings” must deal with the chance that the boss will follow up to see
how well your complaint has been dealt with.
Here’s a list of the steps to climb if you’re working your way up the automo-
tive complaint ladder (you can adapt it to deal with the hierarchy involved in
other kinds of complaints):
1. The technician who did the repairs
2. The manager of the shop, or the service manager if it’s a dealership
or large chain
3. The owner of the shop or dealership
424
Part V: Staying Safe and Dealing with Emergencies 

4. The factory representative at the car manufacturer’s nearest regional
office
Write to the representative and explain what happened and what you
want in order to resolve the issue. Be sure to include the following 
information:
• The name and address of the service facility
• The names and titles of the people you’ve already dealt with while
trying to get satisfaction
• The make, model, and year of your vehicle and its vehicle identifi-
cation number (VIN).
• Copies (not originals) of any documentation that you think is
required, such as invoices, warranties, previous correspondence,
and so on
5. The president or CEO of the corporation that built the vehicle
Some people suggest going to the corporate public relations department
first, but I disagree. I’ve found that both the chief executive and the PR
department often send the matter back to the regional office for action,
so I’d rather have the president’s or CEO’s initials on the letter when it
shows up at regional headquarters again.
6. If you still “can’t get no satisfaction” or you have problems with an
independent shop that refuses to settle the matter properly, write to
your local Better Business Bureau, your local Bureau of Automotive
Consumer Affairs (if there is one), and your state’s Consumer
Protection Agency.
These organizations may suggest taking the matter to a mediation serv-
ice, or they may apply pressure of their own. Some states have special
bureaus dedicated solely to handling auto repair disputes. If you live in
Canada, contact the Canadian Motor Vehicle Arbitration Plan (CAM/VAP)
at 800-207-0685 or www.camvap.ca.
7. If the shop has AAA, CAA, ASE, ASA, or ADS accreditation, write to
those organizations with the full specifics of your complaint.
8. If your problem is with a dealership, visit the National Automobile
Dealers Association (NADA) Web site at www.nada.org to see whether
your state has a mediation service (these services have no clout with
independents, however).
9. Consider taking either an independent service facility or a dealership
to small claims court.
In many states, new laws have raised the maximum of small claims set-
tlements to levels that cover all but the most expensive auto repair dis-
putes. The fees involved are generally negligible, and you don’t need a
lawyer. From my experience, small claims procedures are usually swift
and fair and aimed at allowing “the little guy” to bring a case of litigation
425
Chapter 22: When All Else Fails: Finding and Dealing with a Good Mechanic

without the need for legal or technical expertise or for great amounts of
time and money. Be sure to bring all your documentation and, if possi-
ble, a witness who can testify on your behalf. “Expert” witnesses, like
other automotive technicians, can be especially useful.
Many establishments would prefer to settle a dispute personally than to
lose valuable time in court and have the fact that they’ve been sued by
dissatisfied customers known to the general public and the Better
Business Bureau. So it may be good to make these intentions known to
the shop before you actually pursue these options.
10. If you’re really riled, you can complain to the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) (or one of its regional offices) at www.ftc.gov/
bcp/consumer.shtm.
11. To register complaints about defects and to obtain data on recalls,
fuel, tires, child seats, seatbelts, and other safety-related issues, call
the Department of Transportation’s Vehicle Hotline at 888-327-4236.
12. Another excellent guide to obtaining satisfaction is the Consumer
Action Handbook. It’s full of valuable information on a variety of
topics. Request the handbook by visiting www.consumeraction.gov.
13. Contact the Consumer Federation of America at www.consumerfed.
org. This group of some 300 nonprofit organizations represents 
consumer interests through advocacy and education.
No matter which line of recourse you decide to follow, paying the disputed
bill first is always a good policy if your state honors the mechanic’s lien men-
tioned earlier in this chapter. If you use a credit card, you may then be able to
have the credit card company withhold payment until the disputed matter is
investigated and resolved. Even if you lose, it’s better than having your vehi-
cle towed away and sold for a fraction of its value. So pay up first, and then
go get ’em!

 Cleaning and repairing upholstery, carpeting, headliners, and more
A
vehicle is more than a collection of parts and systems. When you drive
it, try to trade it in, or sell it, it’s judged on its appearance as well as its
performance. Contrary to popular belief, the main reason for washing your
car often and keeping a good coat of wax on it isn’t to keep it looking good
but rather to wash away the salt, mud, and chemical-laden dust and dirt that
provide breeding grounds for rust and accelerate paint deterioration.
If you live in an area near the seashore, where a lot of salt is used on the roads
in the winter, or where there’s industrial air pollution, it’s imperative that you
wash your vehicle at least once a week. If you have no access to a hose or a
place to wash your car, or if the weather in your area gets so cold that the
water freezes on the windshield, drive to a coin-operated do-it-yourself car
wash and use its facilities. The steamy hoses keep both you and your vehicle
warm enough to wash away the mud and salt in the winter and can do an even
better job than you could do at home, especially if your water pressure is low.
If you use a do-it-yourself car wash with high-pressure hoses, be sure to adjust
them so you don’t damage the paint and protective coatings on your vehicle.
Always clean the interior of your vehicle before you wash the exterior. For
advice on how to deal with each of the materials you may find inside your
car, see the “Cleaning the Interior” section later in this chapter.

In this chapter, you discover the best ways to keep your vehicle clean and in
good condition — inside and out and even under the hood!
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Environmentally Safe Ways 
to Clean Your Vehicle
Washing a vehicle can require a fair amount of water and produces some
nasty runoff. A major advantage of using a car wash is that, rather than allow
the dirty water to run into natural bodies of water via storm drains, most of
these facilities are required to either remove contaminants like chemical
cleaners, soap, oil, and grease and recycle the water to wash additional 
vehicles; or send the runoff to the sewage treatment plant so it can reenter
the environment harmlessly. Because the price of water is rising, many car
washes are recycling it whether or not they’re required to.
430
Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 
The lazy person’s guide to “good housekeeping”
If you have no time or inclination for cleaning
your vehicle yourself, hire someone to do it for
you. The expense more than pays off in the
increased life of your car. At the very least, take
it to a car wash every week or two and be sure
that the interior gets cleaned and vacuumed as
part of the deal.
Car washes vary considerably in efficiency and
reliability. Be aware that your vehicle will prob-
ably respond to the rather rough and impersonal
scrubbing it will receive from the machines at
some car washes by acquiring scratches and
losing a bit of paint around the edges. Spinning
car-wash brushes are especially lethal for vehi-
cles with clear-coat finishes. To keep the
damage to a minimum, find a low-cost “brush-
less” or “touch-free” car wash that uses 
curtains of jiggling strips or one that washes
vehicles by hand.
Forget about the optional hot-wax sprays
offered by car washes. They’re simply not
strong enough to provide sufficient protection.
Unless the car manufacturer warns that waxing
will mar a special finish, most vehicles need a
good coat of wax or one of the new polymer
products to protect it from rust and fading. If you
don’t want to wax the car yourself, hire some-
one to do it by hand.
If you drive a convertible or a luxury or classic
car and you can’t keep it clean yourself, hire
someone to wash it by hand at least every
couple of weeks. Running such a special vehi-
cle through a commercial car wash is tanta-
mount to murder!

When washing your vehicle at home, use biodegradable cleaning products to
minimize environmental pollution. Try to do the job on a grassy or graveled
area where the water can be absorbed and filtered by the dirt below, or do
your washing near a drain connected to your home’s sewer system. Do not
just let the water run down the street and into a storm drain.
No matter where you wash your car, conserve water. Don’t let the hose run
while you work. Use it only to wet and rinse the vehicle, and shut it off when
you don’t need it. Car Wash Association studies have found that people often
use as much as 140 gallons for a single car wash, which isn’t surprising when
you consider that a 5⁄8-inch hose can deliver 14 gallons of water per minute.
A good way to save water by not having to wash your vehicle as often, but
also to preserve the finish of your vehicle, is to protect it with a car cover.
The sidebar entitled “Car covers” later in this chapter tells you what you
need to know in order to buy the right kind of cover for your vehicle.
Cleaning the Exterior
Keeping the exterior of your vehicle clean isn’t a matter of being a fanatic
who spends every second of free time washing and waxing and dusting; just
spending an hour or two each week can keep your new set of wheels young
or brighten up Old Faithful.
De-bugging your vehicle safely
Getting rid of the bird-poop, tree sap, and other icky stuff on the body, win-
dows, chrome, and wheel covers of your vehicle requires special treatment,
often with harsh chemicals. Here are some precautions to take:
 Don’t scratch at hard-to-remove dirt. Soak it loose by placing a wet rag
on it. Wash off bird droppings and sap immediately with mild soap and
water. If left to harden, they’re much harder to remove and can perma-
nently damage the finish.
 Before you use a product designed to get rid of tar, dead bugs, and
other hard-to-remove substances, read the label to make sure that it
won’t damage the finish. Test specialized commercial solvents first on a
door jamb or other hidden painted surface.
 Be sure to remove intense cleansers thoroughly and wash the surface
with soap and water immediately afterward.
431
Chapter 23: Keeping Your Vehicle Clean and Beautiful

Washing your vehicle’s body
Most people think that there’s nothing special to know about washing the
outside surface of a car, but this isn’t the case. Doing the job efficiently saves
you time and effort and ensures that the vehicle’s body comes out looking
great. If you work in a haphazard way, the task takes much longer, and you
run the risk of scratching the finish, streaking the surface, and leaving the
body vulnerable to rust.
Most modern vehicles are painted in a two-step process that produces a
clear-coat finish, which can far outlast the acrylic lacquer or enamel used on
older vehicles. Although a clear-coat finish protects and enhances the paint,
it’s extremely sensitive to abrasion and chemicals. If it wears away, the paint
beneath it will deteriorate rapidly.
Protecting the surface
Whether your vehicle has a clear-coat finish or not, to wash its body efficiently
and preserve its sensitive “skin,” follow these guidelines:
 Never wipe or dust the body with a dry cloth. The tiny particles of dust
and grit on the surface can scratch the paint, leaving it looking cobwebby
wherever the sun hits it.
 Never wash a vehicle in the hot sun. The cool water will cause the hot
body to contract, which can crack the paint and ruin the finish. Park in
the shade or wait until morning or evening.
 Be sure the windows and sun roof are closed before washing. (Don’t
laugh, it can happen to anyone!) If you’ve never washed the vehicle with
a hose before, spray lightly around the edges of the windows, sunroof,
and rear deck lid for a short time and then check to see if the weather-
stripping leaks. If it does, consult the instructions in Chapter 24 for

Safety tips for using commercial products
A commercial product can be just the thing you
need to keep your vehicle in great shape, but
with any store-bought cleaning supply, it’s in your
car’s — and your — best interest to pay atten-
tion to a few common-sense and safety rules:
 Always read and follow the directions on
the package. Some products can damage
your skin or your car’s surface if left on too
long or if applied and removed improperly.
 Never use a spray in an unventilated area.
And never get your face close enough to
inhale it or risk getting it in your eyes.
 Don’t smoke when using chemicals or
petroleum products. As a matter of fact,
don’t smoke, period!

patching or replacing weatherstripping, and try to avoid spraying these
areas until you remedy the problem.
 Before you wash the car, hose it down to get rid of the surface dust,
and then clean and polish such exterior surfaces as vinyl hardtops,
convertible tops, glass windows and sunroofs, chrome bumpers and
trim, side mirrors, wheel covers, whitewalls, and tires. Then, when you
wash and rinse the whole vehicle, you’ll be sure to get off the last residue
of all the substances you used for those jobs. Later sections of this chap-
ter explain how to clean and restore some of those special surfaces.
 Use cold or lukewarm water and a hose rather than a bucket of water
to wet and rinse the car. A bucket holds a finite amount of water. As you
rinse out your rag or sponge, the dirt is transferred to the water and
back to the rag, where it can scratch or streak the paint. A hose with a
spray nozzle can project a stream of water forceful enough to loosen the
mud, bugs, bird waste, and other baddies that stick to the surface.
Blasts at extremely high pressure may loosen and chip paint and parts.
 Use a sponge, soft rag (old terrycloth towels, T-shirts, or cotton 
diapers are wonderful), or a cotton wash mitt. Cotton swabs and an 
old toothbrush will help you get into small areas.
 To avoid cobwebby scratches, follow the contours of the surface
rather than going in circles. Rinse the rag often to get rid of grease and
dust particles. Be thorough but gentle; vigorous scrubbing can scratch
and remove the paint.
 Don’t use the hose under the hood because the water can damage
electronic circuits. I explain what you can and can’t do in this area in
the “Cleaning under the Hood” section later in this chapter.
 Use gentle cleansers. Your vehicle’s sensitive skin requires gentle
cleansers just as your own body does. Use a commercial car-washing
product, not laundry or dish soap or detergent, which can remove the
wax and other protective finishes from the surface. If you have a unique
paint job or other special surfaces on your vehicle, check your owner’s
manual for instructions on how to deal with them.
Doing the job methodically
Every job goes more smoothly and efficiently if the work you do is organized
properly. The following tips help you wash your vehicle in an order and
manner that will get you the best results.
 Always wash the body of a vehicle from the top down so that soap
scum and sludge don’t muck up freshly washed areas.
 Remember to get to all the corners where dirt can collect and rust can
form: behind the wheels, inside the fenders, and behind the bumpers.
Don’t forget the underbody — this is usually the muddiest and greasiest
place of all and the most prone to rust. It’s okay to use a more powerful
jet of water under here to dislodge the mud, salt, or grime.
433
Chapter 23: Keeping Your Vehicle Clean and Beautiful

 Wash one section of the vehicle at a time. Hose it down, soap it up, and
rinse it off. When you finish the entire vehicle, hose it all down again to
get off every last bit of soap. Remove the spray nozzle from the hose and
use a medium stream of water that flows off in sheets and makes drying
the car easier.
Make sure that no water collects in the tiny rust-prone spaces around
the trim and behind the bumpers.
 Towel-dry the car immediately with terry towels, cotton diapers, or
a synthetic chamois to get rid of water spotting that can mar the 
surface. Chamois are good for this purpose and can be washed, rinsed,
and used for years. But they’re more expensive, and I find that old, dry
terry towels and diapers work pretty well, too. Don’t rub hard, and if the
towel-drying rag you’re using gets dirty, switch to a clean one to avoid
scratching the surface.
 At regular intervals, apply a coat of wax or sealer. A high-quality poly-
mer sealant provides the best protection because it binds with the paint.
The slippery surface retards water spots and makes it easier to remove
bugs and tree sap. A good sealer can last up to six months. Carnuba wax
gives a deeper shine but lasts only a couple of months. Follow the
instructions in the later section, “Clear coat and other delicate finishes,”
to get the best results.
If your vehicle has a clear-coat finish, use a product designed for it and
don’t use power buffers or polishers on it. These are too intense for
your vehicle’s sensitive skin. The sidebar “Electric buffers” later in the
chapter explains why.
Restoring visibility to windows and mirrors
Just as “the eyes are the windows of the soul,” the windows are the eyes of
your car. In both cases, clarity is important! Employ the same products you
use to clean glass in your home to clean your car’s glass windows and mir-
rors. Many of these products simply spray on and wipe off without rinsing.
Just keep the following in mind:
 Be sure to use a lint-free soft rag or sturdy paper towels to avoid
scratching the glass. Newspaper also does a pretty good job.
 Wait to clean the inside surfaces of the windows and sunroof until you
do the interior of the car. The “Cleaning inside the windows” section
has tips on how to clean these properly.
 Use vertical strokes on the outside of the windows and sunroof, and
horizontal strokes on the inside, so that you can see at a glance which
side the streaks are on when you’re wiping off the cleaner.
 Lift your windshield wipers away from the glass to clean under them,
and don’t forget to wipe the wipers, too. A dirty blade can streak or
434
Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 

scratch the glass. Handle the wipers gently to avoid bending the mecha-
nism. Remove dead leaves that may have accumulated in the well under
the wipers. Chapter 2 has instructions for checking and replacing wind-
shield-washer fluid and wiper blades.
 Carry a package of pre-moistened glass cleaner wipes and a clean soft
rag in your car to spruce up the windshield when visibility gets cloudy.
If you have a convertible with a plastic rear window, that window may
become cloudy from oxidation, especially if the hot sun shines on it con-
stantly. Excellent conditioners designed to keep plastic windows clear and
supple without scratching them are available. If your convertible’s rear
window is already clouded beyond visibility, I’ve found that Meguiar’s Mirror
Glaze Clear Plastic Cleaner polishes the cloudy stuff right off the window,
leaving it relatively clear again. If you must park your vehicle where the sun
can shine directly on its plastic window for long periods of time, cover the
outside of the window with an old towel to protect it from the sun.
Polishing metal trim and chrome
Consider its shining trim to be your vehicle’s jewelry and keep it protected
and looking good. Several excellent polishes are designed specifically to
clean chrome without scratching the delicate layer of plating. These prepara-
tions also retard rust and leave the surface bright and shining. You can use
chrome polish on other metal surfaces, too. Here are some tips for polishing
metal trim and chrome:
 Try not to get the polish on the surrounding paint. The polish can 
discolor it.
 Be sure to do the inside surfaces of a metal bumper, too, if you can
reach it. And don’t forget the metal frames around the lights and side
mirrors.
 Use a special glaze on black metal or plastic trim around the windows,
on bumpers, or as side-protector strips. The glaze, usually liquid, restores
some luster to the blacked-out trim. As with metal polishes, avoid getting
the glaze on the vehicle’s paint.
 If you find rust on any metal area, get rid of the stuff immediately! For
instructions, rush directly to the section on rust removal in Chapter 24.
 After you clean metal surfaces, wax them to prevent rust from form-
ing. Use a special wax designed for chrome bumpers and metal surfaces
because these areas require more protection than painted surfaces do.
Other types of wax may prevent the chrome from getting the oxygen it
needs to preserve its shine.

Chapter 23: Keeping Your Vehicle Clean and Beautiful

Caring for wheels and tires
Wheels come in a variety of styles and metals these days. They can be
chrome-plated or made of aluminum or magnesium alloys or steel. Choose a
wheel cleaner designed for the wheels on your vehicle, and apply it gently
(your soft old toothbrush or a clean soft paintbrush comes in handy here).
Clean one wheel at a time and rinse it immediately before the cleaner dries in
order to avoid staining the metal.
Clean the sidewalls of your tires whenever you wash your car. (You wouldn’t
take a bath without washing your feet, would you?) Use mild soap or dish
detergent to remove dirt and grease. A brush or scratchless kitchen scouring
pad removes the stubborn stuff, but before you go at it like you’re scrubbing
your bathroom grout, be sure to wet the tires.
Never use gasoline or kerosene to clean tires. If your vehicle has whitewalls
that are extremely dirty or greasy, you may have to resort to a special white-
wall cleaner to restore them to their original pristine good looks.
If you want your tires to look extremely shiny and spiffy and preserve the
rubber as well, spray them with a tire protectant. It will leave them shining
and retard ozone checking. You can usually use the same stuff for other
black vinyl or rubber exterior surfaces.
Cleaning and repairing convertible tops
A convertible is a joy to drive with the top down, but if you don’t take care of
it properly, you may find yourself cold and wet when the time comes to put it
back up. This section deals with cloth tops (affectionately known as ragtops)
and vinyl-covered hardtops.
Ragtops
If you have a convertible with a cloth top, keep that top clean by vacuuming
it often or by using a whisk broom to get the dust out of the areas around the
trim. This isn’t just a matter of cleanliness; the dirt can cause the fabric to rot
away if it’s allowed to remain there. Do the following to keep your ragtop in
good shape:
 Check the top occasionally to make sure that it’s not getting caught in
the mechanism that raises and lowers it. This can leave greasy streaks
on the fabric, weaken it, and cause it to tear. If your top has a plastic rear
window, make sure that it isn’t getting scrunched by the mechanism
when the top is down, and follow the instructions in the earlier section,
“Restoring visibility to windows and mirrors,” to clean it without
scratching it.
436
Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 

 Inspect the metal mechanism that raises and lowers the top and polish
it occasionally to keep it shiny and beautiful. Put a coat of wax on the
metal to retard rusting, and oil the hinges now and then to keep things
working smoothly. Use the oil sparingly to avoid staining the top.
 Remember to dust or vacuum the well into which the top folds and to
keep it free of objects that can puncture or mar the top. I remember a
friend who had a convertible with a glass rear window. The top was up
for most of the winter, and that well seemed like an ideal place to stash
her umbrella and other paraphernalia. Then one day the sun shone, and
she happily pressed the button to automatically lower the top. Crunch!
End of story.
 Check for weak spots or tears, and check the seams for threads that
are beginning to break. Seams that are loosening up can be restitched
by hand before they become major problems. Try to use the same holes
as the original stitches, stitching right on top of them, and use strong
thread in the same color as the original.
 If you see a weak place or a small hole, reinforce it by placing a patch
on the inside of the top, and glue it in place with a good adhesive 
or stitch it down securely. Convertible tops are under considerable 
tension, and a tiny rip can swiftly tear right across the top.
Vinyl hardtops
Vinyl tops usually clean up easily with water and mild soap or dish detergent.
If the top is very dirty, you may want to try a commercial product made espe-
cially for vinyl tops. Use a fairly soft brush to get the dirt out of the tiny
crevices in the finish (a recycled toothbrush or nail brush easily gets into the
areas around the trim). Brush in circles because the crevices run in every
direction, and rinse often to wash the dirt away. Vinyl hardtops respond
nicely to a light coat of wax or the proper silicone preservative. 
Here are a few more tips:
 If you find that your vinyl hardtop has bubbles in it, prick the areas
with a pin and try to press the air out. If any adhesive comes out of the
holes, wipe it off the vinyl immediately. When the air is out, press the vinyl
against the roof to reseal it. If the adhesive has dried out, you can use a
glue injector to insert a tiny amount of vinyl adhesive under the surface.
Air bubbles can create holes in the vinyl if something catches them.
 If you find holes or rips in the vinyl, use a vinyl repair kit to correct
them. You can find different types of kits on the market. Before you buy
anything, read the instructions to be sure that you select the simplest kit
that suits your purposes.
 If your vinyl top has faded and become discolored, excellent sprays
are available that can renew the color for you. Before you use these
sprays, be sure to mask the surrounding areas of the car. Always choose
the same color or a slightly darker shade to cover up spots.

Chapter 23: Keeping Your Vehicle Clean and Beautiful

Cleaning and polishing your vehicle
Let me be clear on the distinction between washing and cleaning and polish-
ing the exterior of a vehicle. Washing, which I cover earlier, gets rid of the dirt
on the surface. Cleaning and polishing goes a little deeper. As a vehicle gets
older, especially if it’s exposed to the sun and other elements, the top layers
of paint or clear coat begin to fade and oxidize, giving the body a hazy or
smoky-looking surface. Regular washing and waxing usually retards this
process, but an occasional good cleaning and polishing actually removes tiny
scratches and dead paint.
Clear coat and other delicate finishes
If your car is a dark color or has a delicate lacquer or clear-coat finish, you
want to avoid removing the thin outer layers. Look for a polish or wax/cleaner
designed for these finishes that contains chemicals rather than abrasives
because scratches really show up on these finishes. Don’t use an abrasive
cleaner on chrome or plastic unless the label specifically says that you can. If
you do, you run the risk of scratching the surfaces and removing the chrome
plating. Do not use rubbing compound or electric buffers or polishers on clear-
coat finishes; these products and tools can ruin the finish. The sidebar “Electric
buffers” provides the details.
Acrylic or enamel finishes
When you clean and polish a vehicle that’s been painted with acrylic lacquer
or enamel, you use special products that actually remove a very thin layer of
paint. When this layer goes, so do the scratches, oxidation, and thin coat of
grime that regular washing doesn’t get rid of, leaving even a well-kept vehicle
shining with unusual brilliance.
438
Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 
Electric buffers
You may have seen professionals use electric
buffers to apply cleaners and wax and to shine
a car to a high gloss. Although buffing pads are
available that can be attached to the shaft of an
electric drill, don’t use these or any other high-
speed gadgets to buff or polish your vehicle.
Professional buffing equipment works gently at
slow speeds to avoid scratching or grinding the
paint right off the surface. Low-speed buffers
also are available, but most of this equipment
can burn the finish if not used properly. So
unless you have the light, experienced touch of
a professional, I suggest you employ one.

To clean and polish a lacquered or enameled vehicle, follow these steps:
1. Wash the car and all its surfaces, as explained in the earlier section
“Washing your vehicle’s body.”
2. Use car polish to remove the scratches.
If the finish is in such bad shape that just using car polish doesn’t shine
up the dull surface or eliminate scratches, try using a rubbing compound,
carefully following the advice in the nearby sidebar, “Rubbing com-
pounds.” If the finish is somewhere between perfect and really bad shape
(that is, if it feels slightly gritty to the touch but doesn’t have scratches
and a lot of oxidation to grind out), try using detailing clay. You rub the
clay over the paint surface after applying a spray-on lubricant that comes
with the clay bar; it grinds away surface contaminants without taking off
any paint. A well-clayed car finish can feel as smooth as glass.
3. Protect your vehicle from the elements by waxing it; instructions are
in the next section, “Waxing your vehicle.”
A variety of cleaning and polishing products are available to you, including
some that combine wax with a car cleaner to reduce the number of steps you
have to go through. These combination products are easy to use and work
439
Chapter 23: Keeping Your Vehicle Clean and Beautiful
Rubbing compounds
Most polishes have a mild abrasive action, but
the abrasives in rubbing compounds are
designed to dig a bit deeper into the surface,
discard the top layers of paint, and get down to
the fresh stuff underneath (assuming that there
is any). As a general rule, avoid any polishing
preparation that contains such strong abrasives
because it can go right through your vehicle’s
painted finish.
Some cars are painted with acrylic lacquer or
enamel that has a hardener in it, which helps
protect the finish and keep the color from fading
for a long time. However, if your vehicle is in
really sad shape, with paint that has faded and
dulled to the point that it has little shine, you may
want to try using a rubbing compound to restore
the finish before you spring for a paint job or
dump Old Faithful for a better-looking set of
wheels.
Rubbing compounds come in fine, medium, and
coarse grades. Always try the fine grade first
because the others may be too harsh. The
coarse grade removes so much paint that it’s
usually used for prefinishing jobs in which the
surface is taken down, restored, and repainted.
Use rubbing compound sparingly. Follow the
directions on the package and don’t bear down
too hard. Go easy at first to avoid removing
patches of paint that have loosened from the
surface, bubbled, or chipped around the edges.
You can always apply a bit more elbow grease
if your initial efforts prove to be too gentle.
Always wax the car after using a rubbing com-
pound — unless, of course, you’re going to
paint it.

well if the vehicle isn’t too filthy, but they can’t substitute for a thorough
waxing when it comes to long-term protection.
Some commercial car-polishing products contain fine particles of abrasive,
which effectively remove an infinitely small top layer of paint and grime. For
this reason, don’t use these products more than once a month. Don’t use them
at all on clear-coat finishes.
Waxing your vehicle
If washing removes the surface dirt, and cleaning and polishing removes the
dead layers of paint, waxing a vehicle preserves that clean and shiny finish
and seals its “pores” against dirt, water vapor, and rust. If water doesn’t bead
on the surface of the vehicle when it rains or when you hose it down, it needs
waxing badly. Don’t neglect this step. Even if you use a car-washing product
that has wax in it, you must still give most vehicles a thorough waxing at
least twice a year, in the spring and fall, to protect them from heavy weather.
Nothing is more vital than a thorough wax job if you want to keep your vehi-
cle rust-free and looking young for years to come.
To avoid scratching the surface and trapping minute particles of dust, always
be sure to wash the vehicle before you wax it, no matter how clean it looks.
After applying wax or polymer sealant, use a terry cloth towel to break up the
hazy surface by rubbing in one direction. Then switch to a soft, lint-free cloth (a
cloth diaper works best) and rub in the other direction to bring out the shine.
If you drive a dark-colored vehicle or one with a clear-coat or sensitive lacquer
finish, make sure that the cleaners and waxes you use have no abrasives in
them. If you’re unsure as to whether the finish on your vehicle requires special
handling, check your owner’s manual or call your dealership for instructions.
Unless your vehicle came with specific instructions from the manufacturer,
you can choose from a variety of waxes, ranging from combination products
that have both cleaners and wax together, to liquid, soft, and hard waxes. Or
you can use a polymer sealant. Here’s a closer look at your options:
 Liquid waxes: Generally speaking, liquid waxes are very easy to use but
don’t last as long as soft or hard waxes, although some of the abrasive-
free liquid wax/cleaners specially formulated for vehicles with delicate
finishes are quite effective. Liquid wax is excellent to replace the wax
you lose if you wash your car with a wax-free detergent or soap, or for a
touch-up between professional waxings.
 Soft waxes: These are my favorites. Soft waxes are light and fluffy and
are very easy to apply and remove. Some are mixed with a light cleaner,
but be sure to wash the car thoroughly first anyway to remove particles
that can scratch it. Apply soft wax with the applicator pads provided or
440
Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 

with a soft terry cloth rag. Simply wipe on the wax, following the contours
of the surface; allow it to dry to a haze; and wipe the haze away.
Because the waxes that contain cleaners usually contain abrasives,
don’t use them for every car wash or more often than once a month. In
between, use a liquid car cleanser that contains a little wax.
 Hard or paste waxes: These types of waxes provide the most protection
and should be used for your semi-annual major wax job. They last longer
than anything except polymer preservatives. Hard or paste waxes are
harder to apply and require rubbing and buffing to bring up a high-gloss
shine. Always do a small area at a time to avoid letting the wax harden to
a point where it’s hard to remove. Apply the wax according to the direc-
tions on the can with an applicator or soft, lint-free rag.
 Polymer preservatives: Products that contain polymer substances
claim to protect a vehicle more effectively than wax and for longer peri-
ods of time. They literally bond with the surface and prevent it from
fading and oxidizing. At the auto supply store, you can buy poly-sealants
that are easy to apply and are supposed to protect your vehicle for six
months to a year.
 Polyglycotes: Professionals and auto manufacturers offer silicon-based
polyglycotes that are supposed to last from two to five years, but the
jury’s still out on whether they can live up to their promises; most have
to be freshened and buffed periodically to maintain the shine, which
isn’t much different than waxing. If you still want to use one of these
products, wash the vehicle thoroughly and give it a good cleaning and
polishing first (see the earlier sections in this chapter). Some polygly-
cotes products say that they can be applied over wax, but I prefer to get
all the wax off the vehicle before applying them. When the surface is
really clean, shiny, and dry, apply the protective coating, following the
directions on the label. Make sure that it gets into all the little crevices
around the trim and on the painted metal inner surfaces of the doors
and deck lid. I recommend that you regularly inspect your vehicle for
rust to make sure that this miracle stuff is really doing its job.
Cleaning under the Hood
Many car owners never bother to deal with the dirt under the hood on the
assumption that what they can’t see can’t hurt them. Although it’s true that only
people who exhibit show cars or are compulsively fastidious set much store by
having the engine area constantly at its pristine best, there are practical reasons
for removing a gross accumulation of grease, oil, fuel, and dirt from under the
hood and for making an effort to keep things under control from then on.
Most engines are made of metal and depend on rubber hoses, gaskets,
and wiring, if they’re to work properly. Because all the aforementioned 
baddies can seriously deteriorate nonmetal parts and wiring, keep the 
441
Chapter 23: Keeping Your Vehicle Clean and Beautiful

under-the-hood area as clean as possible. If it’s beginning to look grubby, get
a rag and wipe off as much of the dirt and grease as you can without remov-
ing or moving hoses and wiring.
Never use a hose to wash under the hood — the water can ruin the electronics.
If the situation has reached the unspeakable stage, I strongly urge you to
have a professional clean the area. Although engine degreasers are available
at auto supply stores and coin-operated steam-cleaning facilities at do-it-
yourself car wash centers, I don’t recommend that you try either of these
alternatives and instead have your engine cleaned professionally if it’s too
dirty to wipe clean yourself. When the job is done, you should be able to
keep it in good condition by simply wiping off the area every now and then.
If you’re planning to sell your vehicle, think twice about having the area
under the hood cleaned. Although cleaning certainly spiffs it up, potential
buyers may assume that it was done to obliterate signs of unsuccessful
surgery on the engine.
Whenever you clean under the hood, make sure that you clean the blow-by
on the inner surface of the hood, too, and that you remove the mud and dirt
that have accumulated on the inner walls of the car’s body and near the
wheel wells.
If you find that oil accumulates very quickly on your engine, first check the
PCV valve to see whether it’s plugged up. This little gadget is responsible for
rerouting the exhaust fumes from the crankcase back to the engine, where
they’re burned again and then released through the exhaust system. If the
valve gets plugged, pressure can build up in the crankcase and create oil
leaks around the engine. A PCV valve can be checked and replaced very
easily (read all about it in the section “Servicing the PCV Valve” in Chapter 8).
Oil also may seep from under the valve cover gasket if the cover needs to be
torqued down properly or the gasket needs to be replaced. If this seems to
be your problem, check with a mechanic.
If you think that cleaning your engine is compulsive, my uncle sprayed the
under-the-hood area of his secondhand Cadillac with gold paint so that he
could impress the service station attendants!
Cleaning the Interior
The interior of your vehicle is like your living room at home: It’s “decorated”
with carpeting, paint, fabric, plastic, vinyl, and glass. Some cars have rubber,
leather, and wood as well. Unlike the interior of your home, your car stands
out in public and reflects your personal habits (and you certainly don’t want
442
Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 

everyone to think that you’re a slob!). Keeping the interior clean is more than
a matter of pride; because dirt contains grit and chemicals that can eat away
the surfaces of your automotive “furniture,” it’s vital to practice the same
good housekeeping techniques on your vehicle that you would on your home
in order to keep it in decent condition for a long, long time.
Generally speaking, the same procedures and products that you use at home
work quite well in your car. If you’re an old hand at housework, read the 
following sections just to make sure that you don’t forget anything. If good
housekeeping has never been your bag — or if you’ve spent your life in
hotels — the following sections tell you how to clean and care for the interior
of your vehicle.
When you’re ready to go on your cleaning campaign, pick a day when you
have time to putter about. Arm yourself with a portable hand vacuum
cleaner; line up all those groovy bottles of special cleaners; festoon the area
with clean terry cloth rags or other softies, an old toothbrush, and cotton
swabs for getting into little spaces; and tackle the entire interior in one glori-
ous effort. Unless you habitually drive out into the wilderness, chauffeur a
horde of wild kids armed with ice cream cones, or the weather gets really ter-
rible, you probably won’t have to go through this task more often than once a
month — less often if you’re very fastidious and don’t travel around a lot.
Keeping things tidy
Clean the interior before you do the exterior. The most effective thing you
can do is vacuum the seats first, remove and clean the floor mats, and then
vacuum the carpets. Dust the dashboard, rear window shelf, and other sur-
faces, and use the swabs or toothbrush to get into A/C vents, around dash-
board knobs, and other tight places. Aerosol cans of air used for cleaning
cameras and computers can force dust from tiny apertures.
Never use a dry rag or paper towels to clean the plastic lenses on instrument
panel gauges. Small, dry particles of dust and grit can scratch the surface. The
lens-cleaning cloths or tissues you use on your eyeglasses or camera do a good
job. If the lenses are clouded, use a plastic cleaner sparingly with a clean, damp
terry cloth rag or sponge. Excess moisture can damage electronic instruments.
Here are a few other ways to maintain order and cleanliness in your vehicle:
 Keep the clutter under control and the seats free of everything but
you, your passengers, and the seat belts. Objects left lying on seats may
rip or stain them as people enter, leave, and move about. Maps and
guidebooks belong in the glove box. Store the flashlight, tools, and a
copy of this book in the trunk; or store them under the passenger seat, 
if you can secure them there adequately.
443
Chapter 23: Keeping Your Vehicle Clean and Beautiful

 Your fire extinguisher takes precedence over any other candidate for
under-the-driver’s-seat storage. You have to be able to reach it quickly
in case of an emergency (and the trunk is right over the fuel tank). Store
the fire extinguisher securely so that it can’t roll out from under the seat
and interfere with your driving.
 Don’t keep objects on the rear window ledge or dashboard. If you
have to stop suddenly, they can obscure visibility or fly around and hurt
someone. Small objects like pencils and coins can fall behind the dash-
board and damage the air vents, so find a better place for them as well.
Shiny items will reflect on the windshield and obscure vision.
To reduce sun damage and keep the vinyl, plastic, or leather surfaces
from cracking and fading, apply a conditioner with UV protection (that
doesn’t leave a shiny surface) to the dashboard regularly.
 If you have children who require a supply of toys, store the toys
safely. Keep them on the floor in an open carton that fits snugly between
the rear seat and the back of the front seat, and make putting them away
a regular part of each driving experience.
 If your car doesn’t have a cup holder, buy one at your dealership or
auto parts store.
 Don’t allow old food and drink containers to clutter up your vehicle.
They attract ants and other insects that can “bug” your vehicle’s equip-
ment and wiring, and they stink.
 Follow the instructions in your owner’s manual when cleaning seat
belts. Ordinary household cleaners, ammonia, and solvents can weaken
the webbing.
 Remember to vacuum and clean the trunk compartment. It’s part of
the vehicle’s interior, too!
Cleaning upholstery and carpeting
You can use the same products to clean car upholstery and carpeting that
you use to clean your chairs, sofas, and rugs. Keep the following in mind:
 Avoid using large quantities of water; you don’t want to get the padding
under the fabric wet or rust the upholstery buttons, if there are any.
Avoid sponges, working instead with damp rags wherever possible. If you
think that you’ve gotten things too wet, use a portable hair dryer to dry
the padding quickly and evaporate water from around buttons and seams.
 The best products for fabrics and rugs are the ones that spray on, turn
to powder, and are removed by vacuuming. Stain-repellent sprays are
excellent if the fabric is clean and new; otherwise, they simply preserve
your stains forever. See the later section “Fighting stains and odors” for
more information.

Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 

 To keep upholstery from fading and deteriorating, park the vehicle
facing in a different direction as often as possible so that the sun 
doesn’t keep hitting the same surfaces. During dry seasons, keep a
window or the sunroof open a crack to prevent heat from building up
inside. It can dissolve fabric adhesives and crack vinyl seat covers.
Vinyl and plastic
Vinyl seats and interiors and plastic surfaces such as dashboards, steering
wheels, and interior moldings usually respond well to water and a mild soap
or dish detergent, but you may have to resort to special vinyl-cleaning prod-
ucts if you’ve allowed things to get out of hand. You can use a soft brush on
vinyl to get at the dirt in the graining, along the welting, and around uphol-
stery buttons, if there are any.
Protect all vinyl and plastic surfaces from sunlight and heat with products
designed for those materials. While you’re at it, use them or a spray silicone
lubricant on dashboards, weatherstripping, vinyl or rubber floor mats, and
tires, too, to prevent them from cracking and drying out and to keep them
supple. Avoid oil- and petroleum-based products that can damage vinyl and
leave it brittle.
Leather
If you’re lucky enough to have leather seats in your vehicle, take care of them.
If properly cared for, leather can last a long time but, like all skin, it dries out
and ages prematurely if it’s not kept clean and moisturized. Follow this advice
for caring for leather upholstery:
 Use a high-quality product like saddle soap to clean and preserve
leather seats. Neatsfoot oil waterproofs, softens, lubricates, restores,
and preserves leather that has been cleaned first.
 If you must park where the sun can get at your leather seats, lean them
forward or drape something over them to protect them. If conditions are
severe, think about installing window film that blocks UV rays. If this is
impossible, take comfort from the fact that leather seats don’t get as hot
as vinyl ones, so you can probably sit down on them without screaming.
Fighting stains and odors
Stains are caused by a wide variety of substances and can be enlarged or set
permanently if you try to remove them improperly. In the interest of brevity
and because I believe in leaving specialized areas to the specialists, I suggest
that you refer to a stain-removal guide before tackling stains on fabric uphol-
stery or carpeting. These stain-fighting tactics may also help:
445
Chapter 23: Keeping Your Vehicle Clean and Beautiful

 Be sure to attack the stain while it’s fresh; the older a stain gets, the
harder it is to remove. You may want to stow a small spray container of
stain remover in the trunk so that you can attack stubborn stains before
sunlight and heat set them, but test the remover on a hidden spot first.
 Avoid drastic measures that can harm the upholstery. I prefer to con-
sult the experts on things like chewing gum, tar, blood, and other hard-
to-remove substances.
 To avoid spreading a stain, work from the edges in toward the center.
Use a minimum of liquid and dab rather than scrub. When the stain is
gone, dry the surface with a portable hair dryer.
 You may be able to cut the stains off high-napped carpets and then
camouflage the resulting bald spots with loops cut from a hidden area
and glued in with clear adhesive. Try this trick on an area that doesn’t
show first to see whether your handiwork would look better (or worse!)
than the original stain.
 Odors are considered stains, too — even though they assault your
nose rather than your eyes. Odor removal sprays encapsulate odors, lift
them out of the fabric, and destroy them, rather than masking them with
stronger fragrances, as most air fresheners do.
Repairing tears and holes
Auto seats get considerable wear and tear, and reupholstery is very expen-
sive. If you catch small tears and holes early, you can save yourself a lot of
money. Try the following:
 Sew up tears in fabric seats with strong matching thread or use patch
kits that allow you to put the patch under the fabric and seal the
wound with a colorless adhesive.
 For vinyl upholstery, check out the various vinyl repair kits available
and choose the simplest one that can do the job. If you have to patch
an area where the vinyl no longer exists, be sure that the patch is at
least 1⁄2 inch larger than the hole so that when you slip it under the hole,
the adhesive doesn’t contact the padding. If your seats need major cor-
rective surgery, go to a professional who can do the work properly.
Caring for headliners
The headliner is the covering for the inside of your vehicle’s roof; it’s usually
cloth or vinyl on older models and a form-fitting felt-covered plastic on many
newer vehicles. Many vinyl and cloth headliners are held in place by adhe-
sives that can be dissolved by cleaning materials or pulled away by strong
vacuuming, causing the headliner to sag. For this reason, treat it gently. If the
446
Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 

headliner is badly stained or torn, either spend the bucks to have it profes-
sionally repaired or replaced, or live with it until you get a new vehicle.
Cleaning floor mats
The vinyl floor coverings that substitute for carpet on many new vehicles don’t
look very sturdy to me. Floor mats are useful for protecting them and are easy
to remove and clean. You can also use mats to protect existing carpets, espe-
cially in rainy or muddy areas, and to hide carpeting that’s stained or torn.
Clean vinyl and rubber floor mats with cold water and soap. You can take
them right out of the car and hose them down as you wash the car. Use a
brush or scratchless kitchen scouring pad to gently remove caked-on dirt. Be
sure to rinse mats thoroughly, and don’t replace them until they’re dry on
both sides. Clean mats made of carpet with a carpet cleaner or shampoo.
Place old or worn mats or throw rugs on the floor of the trunk or hatchback
area to reduce the noise level and protect the interior.
Cleaning inside the windows
Clean the interior surfaces of your windows and sunroof and the rearview
mirror to remove the films caused by smoke and by the vapors that vinyl,
plastic, and adhesives give off. Wash them the same way you wash your win-
dows at home, or refer to the earlier section “Washing your vehicle’s body”
for general instructions. When washing windows, remember to use horizontal
strokes on the inside and vertical ones on the outside so that you can tell
which side of the glass the streaks are on.
Avoid products with ammonia, which can damage tinted window film, and
don’t get dedicated glass cleaners on synthetic surfaces because it can stain
them.
Remembering Those Final Touches
Just to cover all the bases: Oil the hinges of the doors, hood, and rear deck
lid now and then; and spray the door and trunk locks with graphite to keep
them working smoothly. Be happy that you don’t have to put fresh flowers in
a little crystal vase in the passenger compartment, as some chauffeurs used
to do! (But if you’re lucky enough to have one of the modern Volkswagen
Beetles — complete with dashboard bud vase — stop by the florist on your
way home and pick up one of your favorite blossoms.)

Car covers
After you have your vehicle looking wonderful
inside and out, it pays to keep it that way. If you
have no garage and you must park outdoors,
you may want to invest in a cover to protect
your vehicle from the sun and keep the dirt and
dust off it. The first thing you should realize is
that you don’t buy a cover to protect a vehicle
from moisture. People who purchase vinyl or 
waterproof covers to keep their vehicles dry
innocently cause more trouble than they pre-
vent: Moisture gets under the cover anyway —
from underneath — and is trapped there and
prevented from evaporating quickly. So, a vehi-
cle that’s covered with a waterproof cover
remains damp longer than one that’s been
unprotected and has dried quickly in the air and
sunlight following a storm.
Now that you know not to buy a vinyl or water-
proof car cover, here’s what to look for when
you’re shopping for a cloth cover:
 The best covers on the market are cotton or
cotton and polyester, woven so closely that
they keep out the sunlight, prevent a good
deal of moisture from getting through, dry
out quickly, allow any moisture to evaporate
easily, and are durable enough to last a
couple of years. The fabric is also soft
enough to avoid scratching the finish. The
best covers come in shapes and sizes
designed to fit specific vehicles, and you
order them by year, make, and model. These
can cost up to a couple of hundred dollars,
but they save you money in the long run if
you have an expensive vehicle to protect.
 Some covers come with cables that slide
under the car and lock onto the cover to
keep it from being stolen. You may want this
option, especially if your vehicle sits unat-
tended for long periods of time.
 The cheaper car covers designed for small,
medium, and large models work fairly well.
If you buy one of these, make sure that it
has no metal cleats or grommets that can
scratch the car and that it will stay on
securely in gusting, windy weather. Mail-
order ads in car magazines have some of
the best buys.

Bodywork: Getting Rid of Dings,
Dents, and Other Hard Knocks
In This Chapter
 Ridding your vehicle of rust
 Getting rid of small dents, dings, and other imperfections
 Touching up paint
 Repairing damage to weatherstripping and windshields
 Obtaining the best deal on professional bodywork
Your vehicle’s body is subject to the same ravages of time and hard
knocks as your own. If you want Old Faithful (or the new pony) to stay
forever young, you must keep a careful eye on it and forestall major damage
by taking care of the minor stuff as soon as possible. Earlier chapters in this
book deal with proper nutrition and regular maintenance for your vehicle’s
innards and how to keep it clean inside and out. This chapter deals with the
dings and dents that your vehicle may suffer, and America’s number-one car
killer: rust. You also find out how to touch up paint, replace worn weather-
stripping, deal with windshield damage, and, if all else fails, get the best pos-
sible deal from body shops. So get out there and spruce up your vehicle — it
will love you for it!
The following word of warning applies to all the tasks outlined in this chapter:
NO MATTER HOW OPTIMISTIC AND AMBITIOUS YOU ARE, DO NOT TACKLE ANY
BODY DAMAGE LARGER THAN A COUPLE OF INCHES IN SIZE.
Repairing a small area is relatively easy. But if your vehicle has suffered fairly
extensive body damage, such as major rusting or large holes, dents, creases,
or tears in its metal or fiberglass skin, I advise you to forget about trying to
fix it yourself unless you have considerable skill in working with your hands
and you really enjoy challenging and time-consuming jobs with less-than-
perfect results. Amateur attempts usually give themselves away with uneven
surfaces or color, and the filler or paint may wear away prematurely if the

surface isn’t prepared properly. Instead, rely on a professional body shop for
appropriate major surgery. (You wouldn’t try to set a broken leg yourself,
would you?) I cover body shops and ways to get the best work for your money
in the section, “Turning to the Pros for Larger Repairs,” later in this chapter.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Getting Rid of Rust
Rust, the “heavy” of this chapter, should probably be called car cancer. It
arrives unheralded, eats corrosively into the car’s body in unsuspected
nooks and crannies, and — if you’re foolish enough to simply paint over it —
goes right on with its deadly work unseen. This imagery may seem exces-
sively grim, but I honestly believe that over the years more fine vehicles have
given way to the ravages of rust than have been demolished in accidents. The
good news is that many modern vehicles have aluminum or plastic pieces,
hoods, trunk lids, fenders, and bodies that aren’t subject to rust.
The first line of defense against rust is to wash and wax your vehicle regu-
larly. See Chapter 23 for tips on doing these and other cleaning chores.
Checking for rust
If you live in an area where the streets are salted in winter, where it rains or
snows a great deal, or near the seashore — in other words, anywhere your
vehicle is exposed to moisture and/or salt — you must be especially vigilant
about detecting and getting rid of rust quickly. However, even if you live in a
dry climate, you must still make a habit of checking carefully every few
months. If you find rust forming, get rid of it before it can do major damage.
The paint on your vehicle is there not only for beauty but for protection as
well. Paint and clear-coat finishes help retard rust and, on aluminum parts,
corrosion and pitting. As long as your paint job is unmarred, metal body sur-
faces are safe. But something as seemingly innocuous as a small scratch can
spell the beginning of trouble. Check the following trouble spots:
 Small scratches, nicks, and spots where the paint may have flaked off:
Touch up the paint in those areas before rust or corrosion can form on
the bare metal (see “Touching Up Your Paint Job” later in this chapter).
 Dark spots in the paint, which may indicate that the metal is rusting
underneath: If you find these spots, read the next section to find out
how to take care of the problem.
450
Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 

 Pitted places in the paint and on the chrome and metal trim: Treat
these spots with rust remover, following the directions on the package.
Look for a rust remover that’s safe to use on painted surfaces, and test
the stuff on a small, hidden area first to make sure that it doesn’t affect
the color — no matter what the package says.
Another prime breeding ground for rust is any place on a vehicle where
grime, dirt, or salt can accumulate. These areas are usually around fenders,
under trim, and so on. Pay special attention to the following tips when you
look for rust:
 Each time you wash the car, take a flashlight and check around the
fenders, in the wheel wells, and behind metal bumpers.
 Shine a light into the little crevices between the car body and all the
trim and moldings that are affixed to it. Look all around the lights, win-
dows, side mirrors, sunroof, and antenna, too.
 If you live in a damp area, check the metal surfaces inside the vehi-
cle, and don’t forget to check around the window frames.
 One of the most insidious places rust forms is under your vehicle,
where you can’t see it. The next time you bring your car in for service,
have the shop put it up on the hoist and check its underbody thor-
oughly. If you’re afraid that the shop won’t be thorough enough, ask
them to let you have a look around while it’s up there. Some shops won’t
allow this because of liability issues, but if you’ve built up a good rela-
tionship with an independent technician or service writer, they may be
willing to sneak you in.
Even if you have a vehicle with plastic or aluminum (and therefore rust-
proof) body parts, the underbody is steel and therefore still the most sensi-
tive area where rust is concerned. I’ve ridden in venerable old cars where the
floorboards had rusted through so completely that I could see the road flash
by below. And if rust attacks the frame, Old Faithful can be on its way to the
Great Car Lot in the Sky before you know it.
Dealing with any rust you find
Okay, the worst has happened: You find some rust spots on your car. Don’t
panic: You still have time to save the patient — unless the rust has gone too
far. If the rust is underneath the vehicle, on the underside of the body or
bumpers where it doesn’t show, or still confined to very small areas that can
be touched up easily, you can probably take care of the matter yourself.
Here’s what to do:
1. Gently scrape away the rust with a single-edged razor blade or fine-
grain sandpaper.
451
Chapter 24: Bodywork: Getting Rid of Dings, Dents, and Other Hard Knocks

For slightly larger painted areas, use a brush with stiff (but not metal)
bristles. Use coarse sandpaper to grind the rust off large areas that are
out of sight and not surrounded by paint. Rust remover can make this
job easier if you apply it after you get the crusty stuff off the surface.
Always work inward from the edges to avoid extending the area by dam-
aging the paint. Don’t turn a small job into a large one by carelessly 
damaging the surrounding paint!
2. After you’ve removed all the rust, apply some rust arrestor to keep
the rust from spreading further.
3. As soon as the area is dry, prime and paint it to protect the surface
and restore it to its former beauty. See the “Touching Up Your Paint
Job” section later in this chapter for details.
If you see large rust holes in the body of the vehicle, or if the frame has been
badly weakened by rust, get a couple of estimates from reliable body shops
on what repairing the damage would cost. Then check those estimates
against what your vehicle is worth by looking up the blue book value by
make, model, and year at the Kelley Blue Book site (www.kbb.com) or
Edmunds’ site (www.edmunds.com). If you’re not computer savvy, call your
local bank, insurance company, or loan agency or look in the Classified sec-
tion of your newspaper to see what vehicles of that make, model, and year
are selling for these days. If your vehicle seems worth the effort and money,
and is mechanically sound, bite the bullet and get it fixed professionally.
Otherwise, it’s time to get yourself another set of wheels.
Undercoating to prevent rust
Special undercoating, which prevents rust from forming on the undersurface
of a vehicle, works quite well if the vehicle is so new that absolutely no rust
exists. Thankfully, most modern vehicles have already been dipped, frame
and all, in rust inhibitors before being primed and painted. So if I were offered
undercoating as a dealer option on a new vehicle, I’d refuse it. However, if
you drive a much older model and are considering having it undercoated (or
doing it yourself), consider these points:
 If rust is already present on the underbody, undercoating simply locks
the rust away, where it continues its insidious work unseen. Have all
the rust removed and a rust arrestor used to destroy any rust that may
have been overlooked, and then have the undercoating applied.
 Spray undercoatings designed for amateur use are probably better
than nothing, but continue to watch closely for rust after applying
them. If you decide to try one of these, work in a well-ventilated area.
 Don’t spray the undercoating (or anything else, for that matter) on any
cables, pipes, or parts that get hot. Otherwise, they’ll smell awful when
the heat hits them.
452
Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 

Removing Small Dents and Dings
Although you need special tools and equipment to yank, hammer, or other-
wise coax large dents in damaged steel body parts back into place, taking
care of little dents and dings is another matter. This type of damage responds
to simple measures and may not require much work at all, even on aluminum
and plastic parts. Here are some situations that you may want to tackle:
 If the paint has simply flaked or has been scratched off the surface,
follow the instructions for touching up paint later in this chapter.
Before you prime and paint the vehicle, take care of any rust, dings, or
dents that you find. By taking care of all these things at once, you can
then put a final coat of paint on all of them at the same time and have a
car that looks wonderful.
 If a steel surface has been pushed in and hasn’t been badly creased,
you can try to pop it back into place with a rubber plunger (the kind
they call a plumber’s helper). Just moisten the edge of the rubber, place
the plunger over the dent, establish suction by pressing down on the
handle, and then pull it toward you. It may take a couple of tries before
the metal pops back to normal. This technique works especially well on
large expanses of metal, such as doors and fenders, if they have only
been bent inward. It may work on aluminum as well as steel, depending
on the size of the dent, but it doesn’t work on plastic body parts.
 If you have small dents in a steel part, you can attempt to hammer
them out by placing a flat piece of metal (with a rag wrapped around it
to protect the paint from scratching) on the outer side of the vehicle and
banging the dent from the underside with a flat-ended hammer. Be very
careful to bang only the underside of the dent and not the surrounding
area, or you’ll end up with a couple of new bumps to deal with. Work
from the shallow sides of the dent toward the deeper areas and avoid
overworking the metal, which stretches it.
Don’t try this with aluminum, which can stretch, or plastic, which is
likely to crack.
 If you have very small dings or places where the paint has chipped,
you can fill them in with glazing putty, which is very easy to handle. Use
a putty knife to apply it, following the directions on the package, and
then prime and paint the area. If the damaged area is larger than a very
small, shallow ding, you need to resort to a body filler designed specifi-
cally for a steel, aluminum, or plastic body. The next section tells you
how to use this material.
There are inexpensive specialty shops that just fix dents and dings. Many of
these “paintless” dent-repair specialists are mobile and will come to you. Always
get an estimate before you commit to doing any bodywork yourself. Having the
work done professionally may cost you so much less in time and effort than
struggling through a learning process that it will be cheaper in the long run!
453
Chapter 24: Bodywork: Getting Rid of Dings, Dents, and Other Hard Knocks

Filling Small Dents and Holes
Dents and holes can be repaired in one of two ways. As I mention earlier, you
should have large damaged areas repaired by having a professional replace or
straighten the body panels. You can fill smaller indentations with body filler.
Many people refer to the process of using plastic body filler as bondoing.
Although “bondo” has become a synonym for all car body fillers, Bondo is
really the commercial name of a wide variety of auto body-repair products
manufactured by one company; each product is designed for a specific body
material.
Many compounds are on the market for filling small holes, dents, and creases
in the surface of your car. Buy a good-quality product designed for the type of
material your vehicle’s body is made of (the cheap stuff may break loose or
flake away) and follow the directions on the package closely.
Most kits contain at least two substances: the filler and a hardener that you
mix with the filler before you use it. Check carefully at the auto supply store
to find the kit with the easiest instructions that can do the job for you as
simply as possible. The salespeople should be helpful if you tell them that
this is your first attempt at bodywork.
To give you an idea of how to apply body filler, here are a few general instruc-
tions that suit most situations (but be sure to read and follow the directions
on the product you buy):
1. Clean the body area thoroughly to remove all traces of dirt, wax, or
rust. (See Chapter 23 and “Getting Rid of Rust” earlier in this chapter.)
2. Sand the area using #180 or #220 aluminum oxide sandpaper or the
type specified for your vehicle’s plastic or aluminum parts.
The salespeople at the auto supply or auto paint store can help you
make the right selection. Because body fillers don’t stick to paint, you
must sand the area. When sanding, be sure to feather-edge (blend) the
paint edges to prevent the old paint from chipping up through the new
paint in the future and to ensure a good bond. Gently work inward from
the edges of the dent to avoid enlarging the damaged area.
3. Mix only as much hardener-filler as you’re going to use right away.
4. If there’s a hole in a metal vehicle’s body, place fiberglass screening
or fine aluminum chicken wire beneath the hole (on the underside of
the body) to keep the filler from falling out. If you have a fiberglass or
plastic part, use the appropriate patch kit available at your local auto
supply or auto paint store.
454
Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 

Be sure to clean the area under the edges of the hole thoroughly to get
rid of any dirt or paint that may be present. Then mix a very small pro-
portion of filler and hardener and apply it to the edges of the screen and
the edges of the area to be patched in order to hold the screen in place.
If the kit contains no applicator, use a putty knife or plastic pot scraper
to apply the filler. Let the screen patch dry for several hours before
moving on to the next step.
5. Apply the plastic filler, working slowly and carefully to avoid spread-
ing the filler outside the dent or hole and marring the surrounding
area.
After you finish, the filled portion should be slightly higher than the sur-
face of the car around it.
6. As soon as the filler starts to harden (about to the consistency of hard
cheese), use a perforated file to bring the level down almost to the
level of the paint.
7. Wait at least 20 to 30 minutes until everything is bone dry; then sand
the area with medium-grain sandpaper until it conforms perfectly to
the surrounding body surface.
8. When everything is smooth and even, prime the area and touch up
the paint.
You can use primer as a last layer of filler to fill tiny holes or irregularities.
Apply several layers of primer, sanding each layer with a sanding block,
until the area appears perfectly smooth. (To check that it’s smooth, wet
the primer and look at the way light reflects off the surface.)
Touching Up Your Paint Job
The techniques used to paint the body of a vehicle can vary depending on
the size of the area you’re working on and the original paint and finish. Unless
you have an experienced and steady hand (and the car’s original paint hasn’t
faded or changed color since it was new), it’s almost impossible to conceal
the fact that you repainted anything larger than a small area. Larger areas
require spray-painting, which must be done in a well-ventilated area that’s
free from dust and dirt. So if the area you need to paint is large, it will proba-
bly cost you less in time, money, and effort to have the job done by a profes-
sional who can match the paint and do the job right.
Never attempt to do a major paint job on a good vehicle without trying your
hand on an old wreck first. If you practice on a junker, you can afford to make
mistakes — because even a bad paint job can increase the resale value of a car
that’s practically worthless to begin with.
455
Chapter 24: Bodywork: Getting Rid of Dings, Dents, and Other Hard Knocks

If you want a cheap but decent job that will last a year or so, find out where
local car dealers take the used cars they get as trade-ins to have them spiffed
up before resale. To save money, you can remove any rust, spot-fill, and paint
the small areas yourself, and then have the rest of the job done professionally.
On the other hand, touching up a small spot with a little bottle of touch-up
paint is easy. Before you start the job, mask the surrounding area well and
use even, sweeping strokes to apply the paint. (Follow the directions on the
can carefully.)
Practice on a piece of scrap metal before you tackle the car, and don’t expect
the results to look terrific. Follow these steps:
1. To find the right paint color you need, look on the firewall of your
vehicle — you should see a little plate with the body number and
paint code number on it.
If you can’t find the paint code number, consult your owner’s manual or
ask your local dealership where to find it.
2. At the dealership’s parts department, buy a little bottle of touch-up
paint that matches the code number.
If that’s not possible, your local auto supply store should have a chart
that indicates the proper paint to match your vehicle’s make, model, and
year. If you can’t find the right paint at either source, call a professional
auto paint supply store. They’re also often good sources for semiprofes-
sional advice.
Touch-up bottles of paint usually come with a brush or applicator in
them. You also need a small bottle of primer unless the paint specifies
that it isn’t required.
3. Make sure that the area is rust-free.
If the damage is only a deep scratch or a tiny spot, you may need just a
dab of rust arrestor to stop the rust from continuing to form under the
new paint. If the area is any larger, you must remove all the rust care-
fully, following the directions in the earlier section, “Dealing with any
rust you find.”
4. Sand the spot carefully with a small piece of #220 sandpaper to rough
up the surface so that the primer adheres properly.
5. Wash the area thoroughly to remove any rust arrestor, dust, dirt,
filler residue, and wax; then let the area dry completely before you
apply the primer.
Primer is used to seal a metal surface against rust and to provide a sur-
face for the paint to adhere to. Primer also fills in tiny holes and imper-
fections in the surface.
456
Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 

If you’re dealing with a surface scratch or a chip that isn’t down to the
bare metal, you can probably get away with simply applying the paint.
But never apply paint to bare metal or plastic. If a bare spot is exposed,
or if the spot is larger than a fraction of an inch, prime the area first.
6. Use a tiny brush or a matchstick to apply the primer sparingly.
You shouldn’t need more than a drop to cover the damaged area. Avoid
getting primer on the original paint. If you do, wipe it off immediately. Let
the primer dry thoroughly before moving on to Step 7.
7. Mix the paint in the touch-up bottle thoroughly to blend the color pig-
ments properly.
Unless your vehicle is very new, the color probably won’t match exactly
(which is another reason for keeping the area as small as possible). The
paint on new models doesn’t fade as quickly or badly as old paints did.
8. Apply the paint, covering the surface of the spot completely and work-
ing inward from the edges.
If you’re painting a scratch or a very small area, you can cut down the
brush or use a matchstick or toothpick instead. The paint should be 
no thicker than the surrounding surface or it will show, run, bubble, or
peel off.
9. Wait several days for everything to dry completely, and then polish
the whole vehicle to blend in the painted area and bring everything
to a high gloss.
10. Give the car a coat of wax or polymer to protect your hard work (see
Chapter 23).
Installing New Weatherstripping 
or Patching the Old
Whistles and leaks inside your vehicle are usually the result of worn, torn, or
faulty weatherstripping (the gaskets that you find around the doors, windows,
the sunroof, and the trunk opening). If the interior or trunk gets wet when
you wash the car or when it rains, use a garden hose to locate the areas on
the weatherstripping that let the water in. If the windows whistle when you
drive with them closed, check the weatherstripping for the cause of the
sound effects. (If you notice leaks under the vehicle, see Chapter 20 for ways
to find the source and eliminate the problem.)
If your old weatherstripping is in pretty good shape but is admitting air or
water in one or two small areas, try applying weatherstripping adhesive
under the loose portions, or use a clear silicone sealer (which comes in a
tube) to seal around the areas that leak.

Chapter 24: Bodywork: Getting Rid of Dings, Dents, and Other Hard Knocks

If the weatherstripping is old, dried, cracked, or worn, you can probably buy
a whole new piece designed for your vehicle’s make, model, and year at your
dealer’s service department.
To install new weatherstripping, follow these steps:
1. Check to see whether the new weatherstripping is the same as the old
piece you’re replacing.
The piece should be the same shape and thickness and should have
holes, channels, and rubber studs on the inner side that match the ones
on the original.
2. Remove any screws and gently peel off the old weatherstripping,
prying any rubber studs out of the holes they’re inserted into without
damaging the paint or scratching the surrounding trim.
If the weatherstripping is hard to remove, spray weatherstripping
remover around the area and wait until the adhesive softens before 
continuing.
3. Use weatherstripping remover to remove any old adhesive that
remains on the frame after the seal is gone.
4. Insert the new weatherstripping into the frame to make sure that it
fits the holes and contours of the frame. Then gently remove it.
5. Make sure that the new weatherstripping is clean.
Either rinse it off and dry it thoroughly or use fine-grain sandpaper to
remove any unauthorized bumps and rough spots.
6. Apply weatherstripping adhesive (it comes in a tube) sparingly to the
strip and to the surface of the frame.
7. Before the adhesive dries, replace the new weatherstripping, making
sure that every rubber stud or other fastening device is in its hole
securely.
8. Replace any screws that you removed, and make sure that the ends of
the weatherstripping meet and are glued down securely.
A quick and easy way to patch things up if you don’t care how they look is 
to get a roll of black household weatherstripping about 1⁄2 inch wide with an
adhesive back and simply stick small pieces of it onto or under the weather-
stripping in the trouble areas. This stuff is also useful for keeping camper
hatches and sunroofs from leaking or banging if they don’t fit quite perfectly
and for keeping rain from coming past the rubber sleeve where the camper
shell meets the cab of a truck. You can always use it around the house, too!

Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 

Dealing with Damaged Windshields
Windshields can easily collect pits and cracks from flying pebbles and other
debris. It’s vital that these be repaired immediately — no matter how small —
because, as you continue to drive, they will inevitably grow in size, obscure
or distract your vision, and ultimately destroy your windshield. How you deal
with windshield damage depends on the size of the crack or pit. This section
discusses your options.
Generally speaking, if the windshield damage is less than one inch in diame-
ter, it usually can be repaired. If it’s much larger, you’re probably better off
getting a new windshield installed instead of paying a professional to repair 
it, only to have the weakened area give way at a future date.
If the damage is really tiny, you can try one of the windshield glass repair kits
on the market, but their durability and whether they render the site irrepara-
ble by a professional is still under debate.
If any damage is right in your line of vision, repairing it may not be the safest
way to go. Have the windshield replaced with a new one as quickly as possi-
ble. It’s not a great idea to get a used windshield from a wrecker because it
may have tiny flaws, and it must be installed professionally anyway. Because
airbag deployment creates stress on windshields and is designed with a spe-
cific windshield in mind, don’t risk a part that isn’t OEM. That bargain could
cost you your life in an accident. For this reason, have the work done by a
windshield specialist you can trust. In many areas, mobile windshield
replacement companies will do the job right in your driveway.
If you can’t get to a repair facility right away, gently put some transparent
tape over the damage to keep it from spreading and try to drive as little as
possible. Don’t touch the damage, try not to get it wet, and don’t run the air
conditioner, heater, or defroster because moisture and changes in tempera-
ture can accelerate its growth.
Turning to the Pros for Larger Repairs
If, for any reason, you feel that it’s wiser to have a professional make repairs,
in order to ensure that you get the best work at a reasonable price, you must
be able to choose the right shop, make the best decision about the type of
parts you feel are acceptable, and check to be sure the job’s been done prop-
erly. This section helps you accomplish all these tasks efficiently.

Chapter 24: Bodywork: Getting Rid of Dings, Dents, and Other Hard Knocks

Evaluating body shops
Body shops run the gamut from small back-alley paint booth operations to
high-tech specialists with space-age lasers, computerized sonar, electric eyes,
and robots that scan, measure, and repair auto damage and alignment elec-
tronically. Some shops still mix colors by eye and formula, and others use
computers and scanners that match even faded colors perfectly.
To protect the environment, find a shop that filters, recycles, and disposes of
waste materials in an ecologically sound manner even though some states
and provinces still don’t require it. If you need to locate a reliable body shop,
consult the sections in Chapter 22 on finding and evaluating a good service
facility. Then use the following tips to pick the best one:
 Take a look around the shop to see whether they remove — or at 
least properly mask — chrome, trim, rubber, locks, door jambs, and
handles to prevent paint from getting on them.
 Look along the sides of finished vehicles. The light reflected off the
restored surfaces will reveal whether they’re smooth and shiny. Does
the color match the rest of the vehicle exactly?
 Get at least three estimates. Each estimate should include a list of all
the parts that need to be replaced or replated.
 Ask the owner or manager the following questions:
• Do you have the latest high-tech equipment? If your vehicle has
been damaged extensively and is covered by insurance, go for the
most sophisticated setup you can find. If damage is relatively
minor and you’re paying for it yourself, a good job done with more
traditional equipment at a lower price may suffice.
• Do you do all the work in-house, or do you send some of it out?
Tell them that you’ll want to see invoices for any new parts and out-
side labor involved. If trim must be sent out for plating, you may
save money by arranging to take it there and pick it up yourself.
• What guarantees or warranties apply for parts and labor?
Unless your insurance company guarantees the work it authorizes
for the life of the vehicle, make sure that you’ll be covered by the
shop, if problems occur.
• How do you prepare the surface of the vehicle before you paint?
If steel body panels (not aluminum, fiberglass, or plastic) are to be
replaced, will the new ones be galvanized to protect them from
rust? If old paint is stripped away from steel surfaces, will the bare
metal be treated if the galvanized zinc layer has been stripped
away? What kinds of primers does the shop use to ensure that new
paint will adhere properly, especially if parts being painted are alu-
minum, fiberglass, or plastic?
460
Part VI: Helping Your Vehicle Look Its Best 

• Which sealants, coatings, catalysts, and hardeners do you use to
protect the newly restored surfaces? They should be the same, or
at least as good, as those on the rest of your vehicle, or the restored
areas will age prematurely when exposed to the elements.
Choosing parts
Unless your insurer specifies that only OEM parts be used, body shops
should offer you several options on the type of parts they buy for your vehi-
cle. Used parts of all kinds can cost half as much as OEM equipment, but if
you have to pay for the parts and labor to replace low-quality parts often,
they can end up costing you more. As an environmentalist, I favor anything
that can be reused, so here are the pros and cons for each type of part that
may be available:
 OEM (original equipment manufacturer) parts are supplied by the
original automobile manufacturer. They may cost more, but they’re
under warranty, designed for your vehicle, and often are more durable.
 Replacement parts are made by independent companies called after-
market suppliers. They can range from poor quality to as good as OEM.
Discuss with your body shop the origin of any aftermarket parts they
propose to use and their warranties.
 Rebuilt parts are used parts that have been taken apart, cleaned, and
readjusted — often by hand from kits — until they’re “as good as
new.” Be sure that these parts are guaranteed and are from a reputable
source.
 Remanufactured or factory rebuilt parts usually have been rebuilt on
an assembly line by a major company and repackaged for resale like
new parts. How good they are depends on the standards of the remanu-
facturer. Entering the brand name into your favorite Internet search
engine to do a bit of research can help here.
 Recycled parts can range from used parts of questionable quality
fresh from a junkyard to higher quality parts in good condition.
They’re always cheaper but usually come with a limited warranty or
none at all. If you have a reliable mechanic who knows how to choose
wisely, and you want to save money and be environmentally responsible,
the risk may be worth it. Recycled parts decrease not only what ends up
in landfills but also the energy and toxic materials used for rebuilding or
reconditioning.
 Reconditioned parts usually are used for old vehicles whose manufac-
turers no longer provide OEM parts. Quality depends on the source, but
the parts should be in spiffy condition with worn components replaced or
rebuilt and all the rust removed. Warranties, if they exist, are limited and
usually don’t apply to labor.
461
Chapter 24: Bodywork: Getting Rid of Dings, Dents, and Other Hard Knocks

Checking bodywork
When the work on your vehicle is finished, check it carefully before you leave
the shop:
 Check light reflected along the repaired surface for ripples, bumps, or
depressions.
 Make sure that the edges of the hood, rear deck lid, sunroof, and
doors are smoothly aligned with the body of the vehicle.
 Check whether the inside edges of the doors, hood, and trunk are
neatly painted, or whether the old paint shows through.
 Look for unpainted spaces around the edges of door handles, chrome,
and other fittings. For painting, these parts should be removed rather
than masked so that the paint extends under them and protects the area
from rust. If inadequate masking has allowed the paint to overspray
these and other unpainted surfaces, refuse to pay until the unwanted
paint has been completely removed.
 Compare newly painted parts to other areas to be sure that the color
matches the older paint exactly.
Because bodywork requires such expertise, buying a new bumper or piece of
trim (or locating an unflawed one at a wrecker’s) is often less expensive than
restoring the damaged part. Many modern vehicles have thin body panels
that are designed to be replaced rather than repaired. They crumple so easily
that they’re as difficult to straighten as tinfoil, and it’s cheaper and easier to
have a new panel installed and painted.
If extensive areas of a metal car body need to be repaired, have those dam-
aged body panels replaced rather than filled in with body fillers. It’s a good
idea to ask each body shop you consult whether they plan to replace large,
damaged areas with sheet-metal body panels welded in place of the old ones
or if they plan to straighten the old panels and finish them with a thin skin of
filler. Many vehicles are still made primarily of steel with plastic bumper
covers and trim pieces, but a growing number use aluminum for door skins
and hoods, and a few have all-aluminum or all-plastic (including fiberglass)
bodies. A good shop will have no difficulty working with plastics or with alu-
minum body parts. But if you have an all-aluminum vehicle and have sus-
tained underbody or frame damage, make sure that the shop is certified to
work on aluminum.

Chapter 25
The Ten Most Important
Preventive Maintenance
Measures
In This Chapter
 Taking steps to make your vehicle last longer
 Making your vehicle safer and more enjoyable
T
he major goals of preventive maintenance are to keep your vehicle from
breaking down on the road, to catch minor problems before they become
major expenses, to prevent premature wear and tear by keeping parts from
wearing each other away and by removing objects that could damage your
vehicle’s interior and its occupants, and to safeguard warranties and guaran-
tees on your vehicle and its parts. The tips in this chapter tell you what you
need to do and refer you to more information in this book that will keep your
vehicle running better, longer.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Change the Oil Frequently and Regularly
Oil reduces the friction in your engine and keeps it running smoothly. Most
automakers recommend much longer intervals between oil changes, but I
believe that the most important thing you can do to extend the life of your
vehicle is to change the oil every 5,000 miles or six months, whichever comes
first, and as frequently as every 3,000 miles if you drive mostly in stop-and-go
traffic or on dusty or wet roads. Chapter 13 helps you decide how often to
change your oil and provides instructions for doing that job. It can be easier
than cooking dinner!

Do a Monthly Under-the-Hood Check
If you take 15 minutes to do the under-the-hood check in Chapter 2, you can
prevent 70 percent of the reasons your vehicle might break down on the road!
At least be sure to check the following fluid levels once a month: oil, coolant,
automatic transmission fluid, brake fluid, power steering fluid, and wind-
shield washer fluid. Refill or replace these fluids as necessary.
Check the Tire Inflation and Alignment
Underinflated tires wear out faster, create excessive heat, increase fuel con-
sumption, and make your vehicle more difficult to handle. Tires that aren’t
properly balanced or that are out of alignment wear out rapidly, increase
wear and tear on the steering and suspension systems, and may take you
for a bumpy or unsafe ride. Check the air pressure in your tires and look for
signs of wear and misalignment at least once a month and before every long
trip. Chapter 17 shows you how easy this is to do.
Keep the Interior Clean
The cleaner you keep the interior of your vehicle, the longer the upholstery
and carpets will remain in good condition. Remove the mats and vacuum them
along with the upholstery, headliner, and carpeting when they start to get
dirty or every time you wash your vehicle. Wipe up spills and get rid of stains
as they occur, before they have a chance to set and become permanent. If it’s
too late to prevent stains, consult a stain-removal guide for the ways to avoid
making the stain bigger or permanent. Use an odor remover to keep the inte-
rior of your vehicle smelling fresh. Chapter 23 offers advice for cleaning your
vehicle’s interior and dealing with nasty stains and odors.
Keep trash and personal effects in receptacles, and keep kids’ toys stashed in
a box that fits snugly on the floor behind the front seat. If you have to stop
short, these things can become lethal projectiles. Unsecured objects on the
floor or under the driver’s seat can wedge under brake and accelerator pedals.

Part VII: The Part of Tens

Wash the Vehicle Frequently 
and Keep It Out of the Sun
Wash your vehicle once a week to protect paint and prevent rust. Work in the
shade; sunlight on cleaners can ruin the finish of the paint. If water doesn’t
bead up on the car when it rains or when you hose it down, it needs waxing.
Wax at least twice a year, in the spring and fall, to protect your car from
weather extremes and preserve its finish. Chapter 23 tells you how to keep
your car clean and protect it from the elements.
Get Rid of Rust
Rust can start out as a small spot in an inconspicuous nook or cranny and
then spread like cancer through the vulnerable metals on your vehicle.
Chapter 24 has tips on checking for and removing rust, preventing the forma-
tion of more rust, and restoring your vehicle’s finish.
Change the Filters
Changing your air, fuel, and oil filters regularly can help extend the life of
your vehicle, increase its fuel efficiency, and improve its performance.
 Air filters keep dirt out of fuel injection systems and carburetors.
Your vehicle runs on a mixture of fuel and air, so if air can’t flow freely
through a dirty filter, you pay the price in fuel consumption and perfor-
mance. Change the filter every 20,000 miles, and more frequently if you
drive in dusty areas like deserts or near construction sites. Chapter 8
shows how to check and replace air filters.
 Fuel filters help prevent rust and sediment from entering the engine.
Change the fuel filter at every tune-up — more often if you regularly
drive with an almost-empty fuel tank. (Not a good idea!) Chapter 8 tells
you how to check and replace a fuel filter.
 Oil filters clean the oil and remove metal and dirt that, in circulating
through an engine, create friction between moving parts, damage the
engine, and wear it out prematurely. Change the oil filter every time you
change your oil. Chapter 13 tells you how to do this.
467
Chapter 25: The Ten Most Important Preventive Maintenance Measures

Change the Coolant
Coolant helps your vehicle keep its cool, and changing it is a job that you
can handle yourself if you do it in an environmentally safe manner. Change
the coolant at least once a year or every 30,000 miles, whichever comes first.
Do it more often if your engine has been losing coolant or overheats easily.
Chapter 12 has instructions on checking and changing coolant.
Lubricate the Moving and Rubber Parts
A lube job involves applying grease and oil to some parts of your car to keep
them moving freely and to keep rubber parts supple. Modern vehicles have
sealed joints that don’t need to be refilled with grease, but all vehicles still
have transmissions and other parts that need to be checked and serviced
regularly. Many service facilities include this as part of oil changes or other
scheduled maintenance packages.
To prevent friction that can wear parts away prematurely, investigate and
eliminate all squeaks and rattles as soon as they occur. Chapter 20 helps you
troubleshoot strange sounds and other symptoms.
Get Scheduled Maintenance 
to Keep Warranties Valid
Performing scheduled maintenance prolongs the life of your vehicle, ensures
that your warranties remain valid, and may improve resale value when you’re
ready to part with the vehicle. Check your owner’s manual or ask the deal-
ership for your vehicle’s maintenance schedule and warranty information.
Appendix B contains a Maintenance Record to help you keep track of what
you did and when you did it. Maintain a copy for each vehicle you own.
You don’t have to have scheduled maintenance done at a dealership. Licensed
independent shops can do the work without voiding the warranty as long as
they use parts supplied by the original manufacturer of your vehicle (com-
monly known as OEM) or aftermarket parts that meet your automaker’s 
specifications.

Ten “Eco-Logical” Ways 
to Save Fuel
In This Chapter
 Checking under the hood
 Driving with fuel economy in mind
 Saving fuel when filling the tank
 Streamlining your vehicle inside and out
W
ith rising fuel costs, increased emphasis on global warming, and the
economic and political impact of dependency on fossil fuels, increas-
ing fuel efficiency has become a major goal for federal and state governments
and for most drivers, even if just to save money. The best way to avoid wast-
ing fuel and dumping the unburned residue into the environment is to drive
efficiently. But it doesn’t end there: How well you maintain your vehicle has a
major impact on its fuel economy because the more efficiently it operates,
the less fuel it will burn and the less pollution it will add to the air. And there
are other factors to consider, as well.
This chapter gives you ten very important ways to do your part for the envi-
ronment by saving fuel. I call it “eco-logical” because it makes sense to view
your vehicle and your driving techniques from an environmental perspective
as well as from an automotive point of view. I’ve also used “Eco-Logic” icons
like the one on this page throughout this book to alert you to issues and
tasks that are directly related to the environment.
Whenever you encounter a term set in this font, you’ll find it defined in the
glossary in Appendix A.
Take a Look under the Hood
For your vehicle’s best fuel economy, follow these recommendations to make
sure that parts of your vehicle are in good condition and functioning properly:

 If your air filter is dirty, you can lose one mile per gallon at 50 mph.
Cleaning or replacing your air filter can cut your fuel consumption, and
if you cut it by only 10 percent, you can save an average of 77 gallons a
year! Chapter 8 tells you how to check and replace your air filter.
 If your PCV valve isn’t functioning properly, your engine runs less
efficiently, and you may be burning and polluting your oil and the air,
as well. Chapter 7 tells you what the PCV valve does, and Chapter 8
shows you how to check and replace it.
 If your spark plugs are misfiring because they’re dirty or improperly
gapped, the problem can cost you up to 25 percent in gas mileage.
Find out about spark plugs in Chapter 5 and how to check, adjust, and
replace them in Chapter 6.
 Consult your owner’s manual for how often your vehicle needs a tune-
up, and if it’s overdue, have it done immediately. A simple tune-up can
reduce carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon exhaust emissions by 30 to 
50 percent. It also saves fuel and improves your vehicle’s performance.
 If the accessory belts that connect your fan, water pump, alternator,
air conditioner, and a variety of other devices are too loose or too
tight, a serious loss of efficiency can be the result. A belt should have
about 1⁄2 inch of “give” and shouldn’t be frayed or badly worn. Chapter 2
shows you how to check these belts, and Chapter 12 provides instruc-
tions for adjusting and replacing them.
 If a brake is poorly adjusted, it may “drag” while the vehicle is in
motion. Moving the wheel against the dragging brake takes more
power, which means that your brake linings and the fuel in your tank
don’t last as long. To check for dragging brakes, jack up each wheel (see
Chapter 1) and spin it. If a brake shoe or brake pad is dragging, you
can feel it as you try to turn the wheel on the hub. Chapter 15 tells you
everything you need to know about brakes. If you have a hybrid vehicle
with regenerative braking, a professional should check your brakes.
 If you hear a rumbling sound while driving or when spinning the
jacked-up wheel, your wheel bearings may be worn and may need to
be replaced. The wheel bearings are in there to prevent friction, and if
they’re worn, it takes extra energy (think fuel) to turn the wheels and
move the vehicle down the road. Chapter 15 has instructions for check-
ing and repacking wheel bearings.
Start Up without Warming Up
When you start your car in the morning, do you warm it up before you drive
off? If you do, stop! Modern vehicles don’t need much (if any) warm-up, and
experts caution you not to indulge in lengthy warm-ups because they waste
fuel, pollute the air, and increase wear on your vehicle.
470
Part VII: The Part of Tens

If your vehicle doesn’t start up immediately, try the following:
 Have a professional check for a computer malfunction. Vehicles with
fuel injection may have problems starting up because of a computer
malfunction. A professional who deals with your model will have to set
things right. Check out the section called “What to Do When All Else
Fails” in Chapter 8.
 Check your thermostat and replace it, if necessary. The thermostat ini-
tially keeps the water in the engine from circulating, which helps the
engine to quickly reach and maintain the proper temperature. If you
have trouble starting your vehicle on cold mornings, Chapter 11 can
help you locate your thermostat, and Chapter 12 shows you how to
check and replace it if it’s no longer properly regulating the flow of water
through the engine.
Drive Eco-Logically
Evaluate your driving techniques in terms of fuel consumption. For example,
if you’re driving at 55 mph and accelerate to 65 mph but then have to brake
after a block or two, you’ve wasted the fuel it took to accelerate the vehicle
because you returned to the original speed so soon.
Before putting on extra speed, check to be sure that you won’t have to waste
the effort by slowing for a blinker, crossroad, or curve ahead. Remember,
every time you step on the brake pedal, you cancel the speed that you used
fuel to achieve!
Here are some other driving techniques that can help you save fuel:
 Adjust the driver’s seat as comfortably as possible. Research has
shown that a comfortable driving position helps you tread more lightly
on the accelerator, and a light foot saves fuel. By driving at 50 mph
instead of 70 mph, a “featherfoot” can cut fuel consumption by 20 per-
cent! Increased wind resistance at the higher speed also causes your
vehicle’s chassis to age twice as fast.
 Start and accelerate slowly and smoothly. Moving a vehicle from a sta-
tionary position takes power. You can apply that power efficiently by
starting and accelerating slowly, or you can blow the whole thing by
slamming on the gas pedal for a quick getaway. A fast start may cost you
eight miles per gallon for the first four miles. A slow start can carry you
50 percent farther on the same amount of gas. So try not to speed — at
least for the first mile!
 Obey the speed limits, especially in city traffic. Traffic lights are set for
the local speed limit, so if you maintain a nice, steady, legal speed, you’ll
find that the lights magically turn green as you approach them. The
result is less work for you and 15 percent less fuel consumed. My Prius
471
Chapter 26: Ten “Eco-Logical” Ways to Save Fuel

has a lovely animated display that shows how my driving affects fuel
consumption. It has taught me to drive more efficiently!
 Try to stay in your lane. Each time you change lanes to pass another
car on the highway, you waste fuel because you have to accelerate to
pass and then you usually have to step on the brake to avoid hitting the
vehicle in front of you when you get back into the lane. The result is up
to 30 percent more fuel wasted than if you were to stay in your lane.
 Set a steady pace. Anticipate slowdowns and halts in traffic so that you
don’t have to stop short. If you’re not speeding, you may be able to
account for a lot of slowdowns just by taking your foot off the accelera-
tor; by decelerating rather than braking, you don’t wear out your brakes
as quickly, and you save fuel.
 Build up speed slowly before you get to a hill. The extra momentum
will carry you at least part of the way up. Don’t accelerate to maintain
your speed while you’re climbing unless you’re holding up traffic. Keep
the gas pedal steady, and never crest the top of a hill at a high speed
because you’ll only have to brake on the way down, wasting the fuel that
got you up there so quickly in the first place.
 Try coasting down hills, using the weight of your vehicle and its
momentum to carry you down, with your foot off the accelerator. If
you’re holding up traffic by coasting down a hill, accelerate gently to the
legal speed limit.
 If you have an automatic transmission with an overdrive option, use
it. Doing so can save you another 10 percent in fuel.
 If you have a manual transmission, shift into higher gears as soon as
possible. Practice doing so at the lowest speed the vehicle can handle
without laboring or lugging the engine.
Structure Trips to Save Fuel
A one-mile trip on a cold engine can cut fuel economy by as much as 70 per-
cent, so consider these recommendations when you need to go out to shop
or run errands:
 Walk, ride your bike, or take public transportation.
 If your trips take you farther afield and you need to drive, conserve
fuel by combining lots of little trips into one longer one.
 Shop locally. Slightly higher prices are likely to be balanced by what you
save in time, effort, and fuel.
 If you can, skip the trips altogether and shop by phone or online.
 Consider putting together carpools, which are great fuel-savers and
often result in new friendships as well.
472
Part VII: The Part of Tens

Believe it or not, it takes more fuel to make a left turn than a right turn
because, for a left turn, you usually have to wait, idling at zero miles per
gallon, until traffic clears and then overcome inertia to get the vehicle moving
again. For the same reason, a trip around the block can use less fuel than a U-
turn that involves a lot of stopping and starting.
Fill ’Er Up Eco-Logically
Fuel economy involves more than altering driving techniques. How you pump
gas affects your fuel consumption and can save you money as well. (Chapter
1 tells you how to fill ’er up yourself.) Keep the following points in mind the
next time you fill up at a service station:
 In hot weather, fill up in the early morning or evening when the air is
cooler and before gasoline is delivered to the station. Like everything
else, gasoline expands with heat. An increase of only 30 degrees can
cause ten gallons of gas to expand by as much as four-fifths of a quart —
that’s as much as a bottle of whiskey! This expansion reduces its energy
content, so you pay more for less when the fuel is hot.
 Never overfill the tank. When the filler hose clicks off automatically,
resist the temptation to squirt in that extra little bit. An overfilled tank
will run over and spill gasoline on the ground if you drive up a hill or
park in the heat of the sun. Not only does this spillage waste fuel and
dissolve asphalt on driveways and roadways, but the fumes also con-
tribute substantially to air pollution.
Keep Your Side Windows Shut 
and the AC Turned Off
Open side windows increase wind resistance, which reduces fuel efficiency.
Use the interior vents or the sunroof instead. You may think that turning on
the air conditioning in your vehicle is a good alternative to opening side win-
dows, but it costs you mileage because your engine has to put out extra
power to make the air conditioner work. Some air conditioners can consume
an extra 21⁄2 miles per gallon! So if you live in a fairly cool area, you may not
want (or need) to use your vehicle’s air conditioning at all.
Keep Your Tires Properly Inflated
Underinflated tires consume about one mile per gallon of extra gasoline. They
wear out faster, too, so make sure that your tires get all they need. Chapter 17
473
Chapter 26: Ten “Eco-Logical” Ways to Save Fuel

shows you how to “read” your tires’ treads to see whether they’re properly
inflated and how to find the proper pressure range on the sidewalls of your
tires.
After a car has been driven for a while, the tires heat up and the air in them
expands. Therefore, to get an accurate reading, always use your tire gauge in
the morning before you drive the car, and if you need air, head to the nearest
air pump and let the tires cool down before adding the proper amount of air,
following the instructions in Chapter 17.
Snow tires consume a lot more fuel than regular tires. If they aren’t manda-
tory in your state in winter, take them off the car as soon as weather permits
and consider all-weather tires instead. Ask a trusted tire dealer what’s best
for your driving situation. You may need just one set of tires, or you may be
better off with one set for summer and another for winter.
Clean Out the Junk
Every 500 pounds you carry costs you from two to five miles per gallon, so it
pays to keep your vehicle as light as possible. Clean all but the essentials out
of the trunk and interior, and consider how much fuel you’d save if you lost
some extra pounds, as well! Turn to Chapter 23 for advice on cleaning your
vehicle’s interior.
Keep Your Vehicle Waxed
Did you know that a highly waxed vehicle cuts wind resistance dramatically?
And it looks good, too. Chapter 23 shows you how to wash and wax your
vehicle properly.
Use a Trailer Instead of a Roof Rack
Those light-looking roof racks are deceptive. They create quite a bit of drag,
especially when fully loaded, and the ensuing wind resistance substantially
interferes with the air flow around your vehicle. As a matter of fact, a small
trailer loaded with the same gear is less of a liability because trailers travel in
the wake of the vehicle and meet with less air resistance. Of course, they
weigh more, too, but once underway, they follow along easily if you don’t
speed. Besides, you always disconnect the trailer when you don’t need it, but
you tend to carry the empty roof rack around even when you have no load to
put on it.

alternator, air conditioning compressor, fan, power-steering pump, and water
pump.
adaptive cruise control (ACC): Transforms cruise control into a system that can
be programmed to maintain a safe distance between your car and the vehicle in
front of you and to provide protection if a crash seems imminent.
additives: Substances that may be added to gasoline, diesel fuel, coolant, or
lubricating oil. Popular additives clean gasoline and diesel fuel injectors, add
water pump lubricant and corrosion preventers to coolant, and add viscosity
extenders to lubricating oil.

the time of purchase (stuff you buy after you buy the vehicle, usually from a
source other than the automaker).
air bag: An inflatable bladder that pops out of the dash, steering wheel, and/or
side panels during a collision to protect the vehicle’s occupants.
air cleaner: A container, called the cold air collector box on modern vehicles,
that’s located on or in the air inlet duct to the fuel injection system or carburetor.
It contains an air filter, which removes dust and dirt from the air before it enters
the engine. (This container also acts as a flame arrester in case of backfire.)
air filter: The element in the air cleaner that removes impurities from the air.
Most air filters are disposable, although some aftermarket types can be cleaned
and reused.

wheels rather than just to the front or rear wheels. Full-time all-wheel drive oper-
ates constantly and improves handling even on dry pavement. Selectable all-
wheel drive is engaged manually at the driver’s discretion. See also four-wheel
drive and traction control.

Appendix A: A Practical Glossary of Automotive Terms

bearings: Antifriction devices that are usually found between two moving parts.
For example, the babbit bearings found between the connecting rod and the
crankshaft are lubricated and cushioned with oil, and, although the front wheel
bearings on front-wheel drive vehicles don’t need servicing, on some vehicles
they must be repacked with lube grease at regular intervals. Bearings can be 
ball- or roller-type.
biocide: A product that kills any fungus or microbes that may have contaminated
diesel fuel.
biodiesel: Diesel fuel derived from agricultural and other waste products. It 
doesn’t produce carcinogenic emissions and can help reduce human dependence

between the brake pedal and the master cylinder to increase the force applied to
the pistons in the master cylinder. There are two common types: the vacuum
booster, which uses engine vacuum and atmospheric pressure; and the hydro-
boost unit, which uses hydraulic pressure from your car’s power steering
system. Some vehicles with anti-lock braking systems (ABS) have hydraulic
pumps to generate pressure for booster operation.
brake discs: Also known as rotors, these are used universally on front braking
systems and on some rear braking systems. Brake fluid under pressure pushes

built. Unlike antique cars, classic cars don’t have to be extremely old; for exam-
ple, Ford Mustangs and Volkswagen Beetles built in the late 1960s have long been
referred to as classics. In a few years, these classics will be antiques as well!
clean diesel: A diesel engine that has been modified to run without producing
many toxic emissions. Also refers to diesel fuel that burns clean, such as
biodiesel and low-sulfur diesel.
clear coat: A finish on modern vehicles that protects the paint and retards rust.
See also polymer coating and rubbing compound.
cloud point: The lowest temperature at which diesel fuel tends to thicken and
cloud up.
clutch: In a manual transmission, a device that disconnects the engine from the
transmission to allow the driver to change gears and then allows the engine and
transmission to resume contact and turn together at a new speed. In an auto-
matic transmission, a clutch performs a similar function. See also clutch disk,
clutch pedal, engine flywheel, pedal free-play, pressure plate, and throw-out
bearing.
clutch disk: In a manual transmission, a spinning plate located at the end of the
driveshaft facing the engine flywheel and covered with an asbestos surface. When

engine and the transmission to turn at the same speed.
480
Auto Repair For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

clutch pedal: A pedal located on the floor of the car to the left of the brake pedal
on cars with manual transmission. When the clutch pedal is depressed, it disen-
gages the clutch so the engine and the crankshaft can turn independently of the
transmission and the driver can change gears.

pumped at high pressure into a distributor tube called a rail, which delivers fuel
to all the fuel injectors.
compressed natural gas (CNG): An alternative fuel designed to replace gasoline
as a source of automotive power. See also natural gas vehicles (NGV).
compression gauge: A device used to check the amount of pressure created in a
cylinder when the piston is at its highest point and is squeezing the fuel/air
mixture into the smallest possible space. A poor compression-gauge reading can
indicate the need for repairs such as a valve job or new piston rings.
compression ratio: A measure of the amount of pressure applied to the fuel/air
mixture in the combustion chamber. It’s determined by comparing the volume
of the combustion chamber when the piston is at its highest point to the volume
of the cylinder when the piston is at its lowest point.
connecting rod: The metal rod that connects the piston to the crankshaft and
converts the up-and-down motion of the piston into the circular motion of the
spinning crankshaft. The phrase “throwing a rod” refers to a broken connecting
rod breaking through the side of the engine block.
constant velocity joints (CV): The ball-and-socket fittings that transmit engine
power from the transaxle to the wheels. Found mostly at either end of the drive
shafts in front-wheel-drive cars and on the drive shafts of some rear-wheel-
drive cars with independent rear suspension systems, these joints are specially
designed to transmit engine torque while allowing full steering and suspension
movement. They allow movement combinations and angles that U-joints are inca-
pable of handling. See also universal joints.
continuously variable transmission (CVT): A computerized transmission with an
infinite range (rather than a definite set of physical gears) that provides optimum
performance and fuel economy with less wasted energy from the engine.

point and lowers the freezing point of the water in the cooling system, prevents
rust and corrosion, and lubricates the water pump. Also called antifreeze.
coolant recovery system: A plastic bottle or metal tank that acts as a reservoir
for liquid expelled from the cooling system through the overflow pipe and then
returns the liquid to the system when it cools down. This requires a special radi-
ator pressure cap. The system is sometimes called a closed cooling system when
it’s part of the original equipment.
cooling system: A system that stores, circulates, and cools a mixture of water and
coolant that flows through water jackets in the engine block and cylinder heads
and through the radiator in order to keep the engine from overheating as you
drive. See also coolant recovery system, fan, pressure cap, thermostat, and
water pump.

refunded for a rebuildable part that’s exchanged for a rebuilt part of the same
type. A common core charge is for an alternator or starter.
core plugs: Metal plugs in the sides of the engine block that can pop out because
of excessive pressure from ice formation and can prevent the engine block from
cracking. These plugs sometimes develop leaks and should be replaced. Also
called freeze plugs.
cotter pin: A locking device shaped like a pin but split up the center. It’s usually
inserted in a hole drilled through a nut and bolt and is intended to lock the nut in
place so that it can’t unscrew. After insertion, the legs of the cotter pin are bent
around the nut to keep it in place.
crankcase: The lower portion of the engine where the crankshaft is located. The
oil pan is located at the bottom of the crankcase.

power from the pistons to the crankshaft, which in turn transmits power to the
transmission, then to the driveshaft, and eventually to the drive wheels.
crankshaft position sensor: A trigger device that tells the powertrain control
module the position of the crankshaft. This input allows for proper timing of igni-
tion and fuel injection, among other things.
crankshaft pulley: A grooved wheel attached to the front end of the crankshaft.

made straight 4- or 6-cylinder engine or at the rear of the engine on a foreign-
made car. See also firing order.
diesel engine: An engine that burns diesel fuel instead of gasoline. The diesel
fuel is injected directly into the combustion chamber, or a pre-combustion
chamber on some vehicles, where it’s ignited by the heat caused by intense com-
pression rather than by a spark from a spark plug.
diesel fuel: Fuel for cars with diesel engines. It’s similar to home heating oil,
kerosene, and jet fuel. Also known as diesel oil. See also biodiesel, clean diesel,
and cetane rating.
dieseling: An engine on older, carburated vehicles that continues to run after the
ignition switch has been turned off is said to be dieseling.
differential: A “box” of gears, situated in rear-wheel drive cars between the rear
wheels, that turns the power of the rotating driveshaft at right angles to drive
the rear axles and rear wheels. In front-wheel drive cars, the differential is
located in the transaxle. The differential also allows each of the drive wheels to
turn at a different speed when cornering.
dipstick: A metal stick that’s inserted into a reservoir to check the level of the fluid
in the reservoir by means of markings on the stick. The most common dipsticks
check the levels of engine oil, transmission fluid, and power-steering fluid.
disc brakes: Brakes that have calipers with high-friction brake pads, which grab
a brake disc (sometimes called a rotor) attached to the wheel and force it to stop
turning, thus stopping the car. Older cars have disc brakes on the front wheels
and drum brakes on the rear wheels. Many other cars have disc brakes on the
front and rear wheels.

performed electronically on distributorless ignition systems. See also engine
control unit (ECU) and electronic ignition system.
distributor cap: A cap that covers the distributor. It has an outlet for each spark
plug wire, plus an outlet where the wire from the ignition coil enters the cap to
conduct high-voltage electrical current to the rotor. The cap keeps dirt and mois-
ture from getting into the distributor.

the clutch, transmission, driveshaft, differential, and the axle on which the
drive wheels are situated. On front-wheel drive vehicles, the transmission and dif-
ferential are combined into one unit called a transaxle, which connects directly
to the drive wheels.
drive wheels: The set of wheels that are connected to the driveshaft or
transaxle and actually drive the vehicle forward and backward while the other
set of wheels may simply turn in response to the car’s motion. Vehicles are now
identified as having front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, four-wheel drive, or
all-wheel drive.
driveshaft: In rear-wheel drive cars, the spinning metal shaft that transmits
power from the transmission to the differential, the rear axle, and the rear
wheels. In front-wheel drive cars, two shorter driveshafts transmit power from
the transaxle to the front wheels.

responsible for controlling the operation of one or more electronic systems. The
earliest example replaced the points in mechanical distributors in the mid-1970s.
electronic ignition system: A computer-controlled ignition system that transmits
electrical current to the spark plugs by electronic means, eliminating the need for
gapping and replacing distributor parts and frequent tune-ups. Modern distribu-
torless ignitions have ignition control modules (ICM) or are controlled by the
ECU. Older electronic ignition systems with distributors controlled by an elec-
tronic control module (ECM) are still on the road but are disappearing fast.
electronic sensing devices: See sensors.
electronic stability control (ESC): A system designed to help prevent a vehicle
from skidding, spinning, or rolling over and to help return it to its intended path
when it goes out of control. Using the sensors and computers that enable ABS and
TCS, it monitors how the vehicle is responding to the steering wheel and helps you
keep control of your vehicle by activating individual brakes and reducing power.
emergency brake: See parking brake.
emissions control system (ECS): Parts on a vehicle that reduce or remove harm-
ful substances from the exhaust gases and recycle unburned fuel vapors before
they get into the air and contribute to pollution and global warming. These
parts include the PCV valve, various sensors, a catalytic converter, and other
components. See also exhaust system.
engine: The part that produces power to drive a vehicle. It’s usually fueled by
gasoline or diesel fuel but may be powered by alternative fuels.
engine block: The cast iron, aluminum, or ceramic block in which the cylinders
and the crankshaft are located. Also called the cylinder block.
engine control unit (ECU): The most powerful computer onboard a modern vehi-
cle, also called a powertrain control module (PCM). Controls most engine func-
tions including spark and valve timing, emissions controls, air/fuel mixture,
fuel delivery, and even the cooling fan. The ECU also processes signals from all
the various engine, emissions, and related sensors. See also electronic sensing
devices, onboard computers, and transmission controller.
engine flywheel: A spinning plate located at the end of the crankshaft on vehicles
with manual transmissions that engages the clutch disk, causing the engine and
the transmission to turn at the same rate of speed. Also helps to dampen engine
vibration. The starter turns the flywheel in order to start the engine. See also clutch.
engine management computer: See engine control unit (ECU).
EPA estimates: Estimates of the average amount of fuel consumed in city and
highway driving by a particular vehicle, based on tests administered by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These estimates should be used for com-
parison only because they vary with the driver, the load, and road conditions.

exhaust system and out of the vehicle through the tailpipe. See also intake
manifold.
exhaust port: The opening in the cylinder head that enables the exhaust valve to
allow the fuel/air mixture out of the combustion chamber.
exhaust system: The system that conducts exhaust gases from the exhaust
manifold away from the passenger cabin to the tailpipe and into the air. Along
the way, devices in the emissions control system (ECS) burn off or remove
harmful substances, and a muffler (and resonators in some cases) controls 
the noise of the escaping gases. See also catalytic converter, PCV valve, and 
resonator.
exhaust valve: The valve that opens to allow the exhaust gases to pass from the
combustion chamber to the exhaust manifold.
fan: Electrically driven and mounted in front of the radiator — or, in older vehi-

engine — the fan draws air through the radiator to cool the liquid in the cooling
system when the car is standing still or operating at low speeds, or when the air
conditioner is running. Electrically driven fans are controlled by a thermal sensor
in the cooling system.
fan belt: On older vehicles, a single flexible rubber belt that connects the fan, the
water pump, and the alternator on some older vehicles. The operation of the
engine turns the fan, which turns the belt, which drives the alternator, enabling it
to generate electric current. See also accessory belt.

chamber (intake stroke), compress the mixture (compression stroke), transmit
the power created by the combustion to the crankshaft (power stroke), and
expel the exhaust gases from the cylinder (exhaust stroke).
four-wheel drive: Allows a driver to adjust a vehicle to operate in difficult terrain;
how this is accomplished differs from one model to another. Four-wheel drive
should be used only when needed because it doesn’t work efficiently under
normal road conditions. See also all-wheel drive.
freeze plugs: See core plugs.
friction: The rubbing of two moving parts against each other. Friction creates
heat and wears down moving parts. The lubrication system uses oil to reduce

and stop your car.
front-end alignment: See alignment.
front-wheel drive: A vehicle that’s “pulled” by its front wheels rather than “pushed”
by its rear wheels has front-wheel drive. This arrangement eliminates the long dri-
veshaft and the center floor hump found on cars with rear-wheel drive. See also
transverse engine, transaxle, and constant velocity joints.
fuel/air mixture: A vaporized, mist-like combination of fuel and air that’s com-
pressed in the cylinders and ignited to produce the power that drives the engine
and the vehicle.
fuel cell: A power plant that creates electrical current from hydrogen and oxygen
that’s passed over a catalyst, usually a microscopically thin sheet of platinum.
The electrical current then is fed directly to the vehicle’s electric motor for
propulsion. See also alternatively fueled vehicles.

ing them to move freely and preventing them from wearing each other away. See
also ball joint, steering knuckles, and tie rods.
grease seal: A circular, metal-backed, rubber device, that keeps grease from leak-
ing out and protects wheel bearings and similar parts from dust and water.
ground: An object that makes an electrical connection with the earth, to safely
complete an electrical circuit. For example, one terminal of the battery is wired to
the metal frame of the vehicle to utilize the frame as a path for returning electric
current to the battery and thus completing the electrical circuit. All vehicles made
in the U.S. are negative ground because the negative terminal is wired to the
frame. In some countries, this is called negative earth.

to gauges, which indicate levels of oil and engine temperatures, thus enabling the
driver to prevent breakdowns and damage). See also malfunction indicator
lights (MIL).
idling: The engine speed when a vehicle isn’t moving.
ignition coil: The part of the ignition system that receives a small amount of elec-
trical voltage from the battery, amplifies it into a big jolt of voltage, and sends it to

distributorless ignition systems, each spark plug may use its own coil.
490
Auto Repair For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

ignition control module (ICM): A computer on an electronic system that receives
data from sensors and controls the firing of the spark plugs, sometimes con-
trolled by the engine control unit (ECU).
ignition switch: The means by which you activate a vehicle’s electrical circuits
and start the engine. On many vehicles, it’s a slot in which you insert the key to

from the battery. Other vehicles may have an ignition button to push instead. See
also keyless ignition and keyless entry.
ignition system: A system that provides the high-voltage electric current used to
ignite the fuel/air mixture in the combustion chambers of the cylinders. Its
parts include the ignition coil, which amplifies the voltage it gets from the bat-
tery and sends it to the distributor, which directs the current to each spark
plug at the proper time. In cars with distributorless ignitions, the engine con-
trol unit (ECU) directs low-voltage current to the spark plug coils and then to the
spark plugs.
ignition timing: The timing of the spark plug spark in the combustion chamber
during the piston’s compression stroke. This timing is preset by the auto manu-
facturer and rarely needs to be adjusted in vehicles with electronic ignition 
systems. In vehicles with engine control modules or distributorless ignitions,
no manual adjustment can be made.
injector driver: A transistor that is located in, and controlled by, the ECU. It con-
trols how much fuel to spray into each cylinder to mix with the air in order to get
the optimum explosion to drive the piston.

jack stand: A safety device that keeps the vehicle from falling to the ground if the
jack is removed or faulty. Most jobs require two jack stands for safety.
journal: The area on the crankshaft that fits into the bearings in the engine
block and the lower portion of the connecting rod(s). A layer of oil and metal
bearings cushions the movement of the journal to prevent premature wear.
jumper cables: Cables used to jump a start by conducting current from one 
battery to another, allowing a vehicle whose battery has run down to start and
begin to generate its own power. Jump-starting can injure onboard computers on
some vehicles. Before using jumper cables, consult your owner’s manual for
instructions. See also negative terminal and positive terminal.
keyless entry: A feature that allows you to open a vehicle’s door without a key
because the vehicle recognizes a chip in a remote device. Some keyless entry 
systems require you to click the remote, whereas others can sense its presence
without “seeing” or “hearing” it. See also keyless ignition.
keyless ignition: A feature that allows you to start and run a vehicle with no need
to place a key in the ignition switch. This feature often is combined with keyless
entry.
knocking: A sound that occurs in the cylinders when the fuel/air mixture is
ignited too soon and the subsequent explosion hits the piston as it travels up 
the cylinder on the compression stroke. Also called pinging, detonation, or pre-
ignition. Usually, it’s due to faulty timing, gas with a low octane rating, or a build-
up of carbon in the cylinders. Knocking sounds like marbles rattling in a can and
can be heard best when accelerating up hills. The term is also used to describe
the sound a worn-out bearing or piston pin makes. See also four-stroke power
cycle.
leaf springs: A series of flexible steel plates, placed one on top of the other, that
carry the weight of the vehicle and bend to absorb the bumps and shocks of dri-
ving. They’re most often used in the rear suspensions of trucks and some sport-
utility vehicles. See also suspension system.
lubrication system: A system that stores, cleans, cools, and recirculates oil through
the engine to lubricate and cool its moving parts. The system components are the
oil pan, oil pump, oil filter, and dashboard oil gauge or warning light. You can
check the level of oil in the system with the oil dipstick.
lug nuts: The nuts that hold the wheel onto a vehicle. You remove them with a
lug wrench in order to change a tire. Some vehicles use lug bolts instead.

through the brake lines to the brakes when you step on the brake pedal.
Hydraulic clutches have master cylinders, too.
mechanic’s lien: Recourse available to repair facilities in some states by which
they can confiscate and sell your vehicle to compensate themselves if you don’t
pay your bill.
misfiring: The failure of the fuel/air mixture in one or more cylinders to
undergo combustion while the vehicle is running. Misfiring can be due to poor
compression caused by worn or improperly adjusted valves, worn piston rings,
or a faulty head gasket. Or it can be caused by poor ignition due to worn, dirty,
or improperly gapped spark plugs, poor fuel delivery, or faulty ignition wiring.
Misfiring can be detected by placing a stiff piece of paper at the end of the
tailpipe and listening for an irregular puffing sound.
motor mounts: The brackets that hold the engine and transmission to the frame
of the car and have rubber or polyurethane elements that cushion vibrations.
muffler: A device for controlling the noise of the exhaust gases before they’re
released into the air through the tailpipe. Mufflers also help control exhaust gas
pressure. Some innovative systems use specially designed piping, sometimes
combined with electronics, to cancel out loud exhaust tones and to muffle the
noise without an actual muffler, thus allowing the exhaust to flow more freely,
which improves engine performance and fuel economy. See also resonator.
natural gas vehicles (NGV): Vehicles powered by compressed natural gas (CNG).
negative ground: See ground.
negative terminal: The battery terminal that conducts electric current back to
the battery. The negative terminal usually has either “NEG” or “–” on it.

a vehicle has traveled. Some vehicles also have a trip odometer that can be set to
zero in order to register the mileage on a particular trip.
OEM (original equipment manufacturer): Parts supplied by the original manufac-
turer of a particular vehicle. See also NOS (new old stock), rebuild, replace-
ment parts, and remanufactured.
oil: A substance that lubricates and cools the moving parts of the engine and
reduces the formation of rust and corrosion. Oil comes in varying weights suit-
able for efficient operation in cold and hot weather and for engines in varying
states of wear. See also viscosity.
oil drain plug: The plug that secures the drain hole in the oil pan. In many (but
not all) vehicles, an oil plug gasket lies between the plug and the hole and should
be replaced if leakage occurs. In some vehicles, there’s no gasket because the
metal-to-metal connection between the drain plug and the oil pan is tapered and
leak-free.
oil filler hole: A hole at the top of the engine through which new oil can be added
after the filler hole cover is removed.
oil filter: A can-like device that screws onto the outside of the crankcase and
cleans the oil as it circulates through the lubrication system. Oil filters should
be replaced as part of every oil change.
oil pan: The chamber at the bottom of the crankcase that stores oil. The oil
drain plug at the bottom of the oil pan can be removed to allow old oil to flow
out of the car during an oil change.
oil pressure gauge: A dashboard device that indicates the oil pressure as the oil
is pumped through the engine. If this gauge shows a sharp drop, reads “Low,” or
lights up, stop the car immediately and find the reason for your loss of oil pres-
sure before driving any farther. Without oil pressure, you can burn out your
engine in a very short time. A low indication doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re
low or out of oil in your oil pan; among other things, it could mean that the oil
pump is defective or has failed. See also malfunction indicator light (MIL).
oil pump: A small pump located in the crankcase that circulates the oil from the
oil pan to the moving parts of the engine.
onboard computer: One of many computers that may control ignition systems,
fuel systems, heating, ABS, airbag deployment, electronic stability control,
traction control, rollover stability control (RSC), seat belt pre-tensioning, and
other systems. See also ECU (engine control unit), electronic sensing devices,
sensors, system management computers.

lower gear for a short burst of extra power to pass other vehicles on the highway.
This gear is engaged by sharply depressing the gas pedal. When the pedal is
released, the car returns to a normal driving gear.
PCV valve: Part of the positive crankcase ventilation system, which routes
crankcase blow-by to the intake manifold and back to the engine where it’s
reburned in the cylinders as part of the fuel/air mixture. This action cuts emis-
sion pollution and increases fuel economy because unburned fuel in the blow-by is
consumed the second time around. It also keeps the blow-by and water vapor from
fouling the oil in the crankcase, thus reducing the formation of engine sludge.
pedal free-play: The distance the clutch pedal can be depressed before it begins to
disengage the clutch. About 3⁄4 to 1 inch of pedal free-play is normally required to
assure that the clutch will be fully engaged when not in use. Without pedal free-play,

from the tailpipe.
planetary-gear system: A set of gears used in some automatic transmissions
that features a central gear, called a sun gear, surrounded by two or more smaller
planetary gears that mesh with a ring gear.
polymer coating: A coating that prevents paint from oxidizing, protecting a car
from premature fading and rusting. Do-it-yourself polysealants last for six months
to a year; professionally applied polyglycotes are touted as lasting from two to
five years but haven’t really been around long enough to prove this. See also
clear coat.
positive terminal: The battery terminal that leads to the electrical system on
vehicles with negative ground. The positive terminal usually has “POS” or “+” on
it. Jumper cables and other devices that connect to the battery usually have red
clips for the positive terminal and black clips for the negative terminal and
ground.
power booster: See brake booster.
power brakes: A brake system that uses a power booster to make braking
easier.

(sometimes automatic transmission fluid).
powertrain control module (PCM): A computer that controls the operation of the
fuel, ignition, and emissions control systems on newer vehicles. Also called an
electronic control module (ECM).
precombustion chamber: A small chamber located outside the combustion

term is used to measure the amount of air pressure in tires and the amount of
compression of the fuel/air mixture in the combustion chamber, etc. In the
metric system, pressure is measured by kilograms per square centimeter.
pulse width: See injector pulse width.
push rods: The rods that run between the camshaft lifters and the rocker arms.
The lifters and the push rods are pushed up by the cam lobes, causing the rocker
arms to make the valves open and close. Engines with overhead cams don’t
need push rods because the camshaft cam lobes contact the valves or rocker
arms directly.
race: A metal ring surrounding the balls or rollers of a wheel bearing, allowing
them to turn against its smooth surface.

site direction to prepare for the next stroke without removing the tool from the
screw or bolt. See also socket wrench.
rear axle ratio: The number of times the rear wheels turn compared to a particu-
lar transmission speed. The higher the rear axle ratio, the slower the engine can
run and still allow the vehicle to achieve a given speed.
rear-wheel drive: A vehicle that’s pushed by its rear wheels rather than pulled by
its front wheels has rear-wheel drive. See also front-wheel drive, all-wheel drive,
and four-wheel drive.
497
Appendix A: A Practical Glossary of Automotive Terms

rebuilt: See rebuild.
rebuild: To disassemble a device, clean it thoroughly, replace worn parts, and
reassemble it. Engines, clutches, carburetors, and brakes are sometimes rebuilt
as part of the maintenance or restoration of older vehicles. You can rebuild certain
parts yourself with a kit containing instructions and part replacements, or you can
buy a rebuilt part and turn in your old part for a core charge. Rebuilding is some-
times called overhauling. See also remanufactured.
regenerative braking system: Brakes found on EVs and hybrid vehicles that gen-
erate energy and feed it to the battery that powers the electric motor. See also
brake system.
remanufactured: A part or engine that has been completely refurbished with new
parts—as opposed to a rebuild, where only worn or defective parts are replaced.
replacement parts: Parts made by independent companies called aftermarket
suppliers. These parts can range from poor to as good as OEM (original equip-
ment manufacturer).
reproduction: A vehicle or part that has been duplicated by other manufacturers
because the original is no longer widely available. See also NOS (new old stock)
and OEM (original equipment manufacturer).

the noise of the escaping exhaust gases, or “tunes” the exhaust tone, to make a
four-cylinder engine sound more like a V-8, for instance.
restoration: Restoring a vehicle to its original condition (including original parts,
paint, rechroming, and so on) rather than merely rebuilding or repairing one. 
See also NOS (new old stock), OEM (original equipment manufacturer),
reproduction, rebuild, and cherry condition.
retreads: Used tires that have been refurbished by grinding the tread off and
replacing it. Not used much on passenger vehicles. The quality of retreads can
vary; to be safe, only buy retreads from well-known manufacturers.

that have valves activated by an overhead cam or rocker arms. See also valve
cover.
rocker arms: Curved levers, each of which has one end contacting a push rod
and the other end bearing on a valve stem in order to make the valves open in
response to the pressure of the cam lobes on the spinning camshaft and close
from the pressure of the valve spring. Cars with overhead cams don’t always
require rocker arms because the valve stems may have lifters that contact the
cam lobes directly.
rollover stability control (RSC): A safety system that identifies situations in
which a vehicle that’s taking a turn too sharply or too fast could roll over, and
then helps to prevent the rollover.
498

top of the distributor shaft and rotates with it to conduct electric current to each
spark plug terminal in turn. The discs on disc brakes are also referred to as
rotors, as is the triangular device inside a rotary engine that revolves, creating
smaller chambers where the four-stroke power cycle takes place. See also 
ignition system.
rpm: The abbreviation for revolutions per minute.
rubber: All the rubber seals, mats, and pads that cushion and protect car win-
dows, trim, handles, bumper sections, carpets, and so on. A restoration should
include replacement of all damaged or missing rubber with OEM (original 
equipment manufacturer) rubber parts or exact reproductions.
rubbing compound: A polish that contains abrasives harsh enough to remove
layers of dead paint. Useful in radical restoration procedures, rubbing com-
pounds shouldn’t be used on new vehicles with clear coats or delicate finishes.
safety pressure cap: See radiator pressure cap.
sealed beam unit: A headlight that contains high- or low-beam filaments or both,
a reflector, and a lens. It is sealed to keep out dirt and moisture. When the head-
light fails, you replace the entire unit. Sealed beam units usually are found on
older vehicles. Newer vehicles have small bulbs or high intensity discharge
lamps (HID) filled with halogen or xenon gas.
sealer: A substance added to the liquid in the cooling system to seal small leaks;
also called stop-leak. Other kinds of sealing compounds are used to coat surfaces
before installing hoses or gaskets. These are effective in preventing leakage but
usually make the hose or gasket hard to remove.
sensors: Electronic devices that monitor conditions such as fuel pressure, intake
air temperature, throttle position, wheel speed with anti-lock braking systems
(ABS), electronic stability control, rollover stability control (RSC), and trac-
tion control systems, engine speed, and load. This data is fed to the engine con-
trol unit (ECU), which controls a variety of system management computers.
serpentine belt: See accessory belt.
service manual: A handbook published by a car manufacturer or a specialized
publishing company that contains instructions and specifications for the mainte-
nance and repair of specific vehicles. Most deal with only one make, model, or
year. Although intended for professionals or very experienced amateurs, service
manuals are useful for locating various parts on your vehicle and for parts specifi-
cations. It’s good to carry one in case of a breakdown in an area where local tech-
nicians may be unfamiliar with your vehicle. If you don’t want to buy one, ask
your local library to find one you can borrow. See also owner’s manual.
service writer: The person responsible for receiving vehicles brought to the ser-
vice department at dealerships. He or she estimates the nature and cost of
repairs and when the work will be completed.
shims: Thin pieces of metal used between parts to fill gaps or level them.

shock absorbers: Devices located near each wheel to cut down the vertical
bouncing of the passenger compartment on the springs after the wheels go over
a bump or the vehicle stops short. Shock absorbers also improve handling on
rough road surfaces. See also suspension system and stabilizing system.
sludge: A combination of oxidized oil, gasoline, coolant, and blow-by that can
foul an engine. Modern engine oils have detergents to break down sludge.
socket wrench: A wrench that completely covers the head of a bolt rather than
fitting around its circumference. A socket set usually consists of a variety of sock-
ets, at least one handle (usually a ratchet handle), a couple of extenders, and
sometimes a spark plug socket as well.
solenoid: A device connected to electrical current that induces mechanical move-
ment in another device. See also starter solenoid.
spark plug: A device that delivers the electrical spark to the combustion cham-
ber. The spark ignites the fuel/air mixture and produces the power that drives
the engine. See also ignition system, and spark plug gap.
spark plug gap: The space between the center and side spark plug electrodes,
across which the spark must jump to ignite the fuel/air mixture in the combus-
tion chamber. Adjusting this gap is a major part of the basic tune-up because
the width of the gap affects the intensity of the spark. See also feeler gauge.
spark plug socket: A metal cylinder with a rubber lining that fits over the exposed
end of the spark plug to make it easy to remove the plug without damaging its
porcelain surface. This socket can be purchased separately or as part of a socket
wrench set.
specifications: The size, description, or part numbers for various items needed to
maintain or repair a vehicle; often referred to as specs. See also owner’s manual
and service manual.
speedometer: A dashboard device that measures and indicates how fast the vehi-
cle is going. If a vehicle has a speedometer cable, it should be lubricated when
the needle starts to move erratically or if the cable begins to make noise.
Electronic speedometers on many modern vehicles don’t have cables.
spindle: The small shaft located at each front wheel on which the front wheels
revolve on rear-wheel drive vehicles.
splash shield: A removable device found on disc brakes that helps to keep water
and dirt from fouling the brakes.
springs: Devices to cushion and absorb shocks and bumps and to keep the vehi-
cle level on turns. A vehicle can have air springs, leaf springs, coil springs, or a
combination of these. See also suspension system.
stabilizers: A variety of devices used to keep the passenger compartment of a
vehicle from swaying and lurching on sharp curves and turns. Also known as
sway bars. See also suspension system.
standard transmission: See manual transmission.
500
Auto Repair For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

starter: A small electrical motor that causes the engine crankshaft to begin to
turn, which starts the engine running and so starts the car. See also starting
system.
starter solenoid: A device that uses electrical current to start and engage the
starter. See also solenoid.
starting system: The portion of the electrical system that starts the car. Consists
of the ignition switch, which closes the circuit and allows current to flow from
the battery to the starter via the starter solenoid and in some cases a relay. It’s
also called the cranking circuit.
steering-axis inclination: An alignment adjustment that allows the steering wheel
to return to the straight-ahead position when the vehicle comes out of a turn.
steering knuckles: A type of ball joint located at the ends of the tie rods on the
steering linkage. See also grease fittings.
steering linkage: The system that connects the steering wheel to the front wheels
and allows the wheels to change direction in response to commands from the
driver. It contains grease fittings to cushion against wear and friction. See also
alignment.
steering ratio: The relationship between how far you turn the steering wheel and
how far the wheels actually turn.
steering system: A series of linkages and gears that link the driver to the wheels.

the bottom or from the bottom to the top of the cylinder. See also bore and four-
stroke power cycle.
strut: An efficient type of shock absorber. See also suspension system.
supercharging: A method of increasing engine power by forcing larger amounts of
air into the cylinders using an accessory belt-driven air compressor (also called a
blower). Unlike turbocharging, which uses air compressed by an exhaust-driven
turbine, supercharging decreases fuel economy.
suspension system: A system that cushions the passenger compartment of the
vehicle from the bumps and shocks caused by the wheels moving over irregular
road surfaces. The system includes springs or torsion bars, shock absorbers,
steering linkage, upper and lower control arms, and stabilizers.
synchromesh: A manual transmission device that allows two gears to mesh
more smoothly by causing them to spin at the same rate of speed before coming
together.
system management computers: Computers that control various systems and
features on a vehicle. See also engine control unit (ECU), electronic sensing
device, and transmission controller.
501
Appendix A: A Practical Glossary of Automotive Terms

tachometer: A device for measuring engine rpm. Many vehicles with manual
transmissions have a dashboard tachometer to aid in changing gears. Most cars
with automatic transmissions also have tachs these days because owners seem
to expect them.
tailpipe: The last link in the exhaust system. It conducts exhaust gases from the
muffler to the rear of the vehicle and into the atmosphere.
telematics: A word derived from combining “telecommunication” and “informat-
ics,” it’s the technical term for the wireless systems that enable your vehicle to
communicate with the outside world.
thermostat: A device that keeps the hot coolant confined to the engine cooling
passages to help the engine warm up more quickly. After the engine has warmed
up, the thermostat allows the coolant to flow to the radiator, where it’s cooled
and recirculated through the engine to prevent overheating. See also cooling
system.
throttle: A device that controls the power produced by a gasoline engine at any
given moment by regulating the amount that goes into the cylinders. Mechanical
throttles consist of a throttle arm located on the outside of the throttle-body on
fuel injection systems. The throttle arm is connected to the accelerator pedal,
which activates a throttle valve where it joins the intake manifold. Electronic or
throttle-by-wire systems use a sensor on the accelerator pedal to send an elec-
tronic signal to the fuel injection system telling it how much fuel to spray into the
cylinders based on demand from the accelerator.
throw-out bearing: A part of the clutch, activated by the clutch pedal, that allows
the clutch to disengage. If you allow the car to idle in gear with the clutch pedal
depressed instead of shifting to Neutral, you can wear out the throw-out bearing.
Also called the clutch release bearing. See also pedal free-play.
tie rods: Parts of a rack-and-pinion steering linkage that connect the rack to the
steering arm.
timing: The capability of the valves, ignition system, and other engine-driven
parts of the vehicle to work together for maximum efficiency. On older cars,
timing is checked as part of the basic tune-up because if the timing is off, the
vehicle can’t perform well.
timing belt: A crankshaft-driven, toothed belt that drives an overhead cam or
camshafts and, in some vehicles, a water pump. This belt should be changed at
the mileage interval recommended in your owner’s manual.
timing chain: A crankshaft-driven chain that drives the camshaft(s), which in
turn open and close the intake and exhaust valves. In many modern vehicles,
this part has been replaced by a timing belt. See also valve timing.
tire valve: A small valve mounted on the wheel rims of tires that allows air to be
added to the tire with a properly equipped air hose and allows air to be with-
drawn from an over-inflated tire by pressing on the little stem at the end of the
valve. Tire valves should have caps to protect against leaks and to keep dirt from
fouling the valve.
502
Auto Repair For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

tires: Critical parts of your vehicle that allow braking, accelerating, and cornering
on wet or dry roads and contribute significantly to the quality of the ride. All pas-
senger vehicles today use radial construction tires. Sidewalls are usually rein-
forced with polyester, fiberglass, steel, or nylon. Treads are reinforced with a
combination of polyester, steel, and sometimes nylon. See also alignment, ozone
checking, retreads, and tire valve.
toe-in: An adjustment of front-wheel alignment so that the tires are slightly
pigeon-toed when the vehicle is standing still. Toe-in is required for proper steer-
ing and tire wear.
toe-out: A wheel alignment angle used to control the way the vehicle tracks on
turns. Tires should never be toe-out.
torque: Turning or twisting force. See also torque wrench.
torque converter: A fluid coupling in an automatic transmission that transfers
power from the engine to the transmission input shaft.
torque wrench: A special wrench that measures the exact amount of torque
being applied to tighten a nut or bolt.
torsion bars: See suspension system.
traction control system (TCS): A feature that senses when one wheel is spinning
faster than the others and corrects it by automatically applying the brakes, cut-
ting off power to that wheel, and/or reducing acceleration to improve traction
and maintain stability. See also anti-lock braking system (ABS) and electronic
stability control (ESC).
trailer-towing packages: Optional equipment that usually includes a heavy-duty
suspension, a larger radiator, and a rear bumper with a trailer hitch and wiring
for the tow vehicle’s lights.
transaxle: A single unit combining the transmission and the differential. The
transaxle connects directly to the driveshafts on front-wheel drive or rear-
engine vehicles.
transfer case: A unit mounted between the transmission and driveshaft of four-
wheel drive vehicles that controls the flow of power to the front and rear drive
axles when you shift back and forth between two-wheel and four-wheel drive.
transistor: A tiny electronic component with at least three connections but no
moving parts that functions as a switch or amplifier, by controlling the flow of
current.
transmission: Typically an assembly of toothed gears that mesh in varying arrange-
ments to enable your vehicle to move forward and backward with varying amounts
of power to meet a variety of driving situations. Manual transmissions are oper-
ated by means of a clutch and gearshift. Automatic transmissions are driven by
hydraulic pressure. Continuously variable transmissions (CVT) are automatic
transmissions that use pulleys instead of toothed gears.
503
Appendix A: A Practical Glossary of Automotive Terms

transmission controller: A computer found on electronic transmissions that
controls shifting by monitoring engine speed, load, and other factors. See also
system management computers.
transmission fluid: A thin oil that fills the automatic transmission so that it can
run on hydraulic pressure. It’s also found in many power-steering pumps.
transmission input shaft: The turning shaft that carries the power from the
engine and torque converter or clutch into the transmission.
transmission output shaft: The turning shaft that carries the power out of the
transmission to the driveshaft.
transverse engine: An engine that’s mounted between the drive wheels with its
cylinders running parallel to the wheels. Most front-wheel drive vehicles have
transverse engines.
trim: Nonfunctional metal or plastic moldings, frames, and other decorative 
additions to vehicle bodies and interiors.
tune-up: The process of replacing fuel filters, air filters, and spark plugs to
ensure that air, fuel, and spark are available in good condition to obtain maximum
engine efficiency.
turbocharging: Using an exhaust-driven turbine to compress air and drive it
into the cylinders in order to increase the power of the engine. See also 
supercharging.
turn over: An engine is said to turn over when the starter has caused the crank-
shaft to begin to turn, which starts the pistons moving so that combustion can
begin to take place in the cylinders, providing power to move the vehicle.
turning radius: A measure of how tightly a vehicle can turn when the steering
wheel is held all the way in one direction.
U-joints: An abbreviation for universal joints.
undercoating: A protective material applied to the undersides of new vehicles to
prevent the formation of rust.
universal joints: Couplings located at either end of the driveshaft on a rear-
wheel drive vehicle that allow the shaft to move freely without affecting the more
rigid transmission shaft and to absorb the movement of the axle and wheels.
Also called U-joints. On cars with transverse engines, these are called constant
velocity joints (CV).
vacuum modulator: A device found on some older automatic transmissions
which controls the pressure in the transmission’s hydraulic system. If the
vacuum modulator malfunctions, it can give the impression of transmission fail-
ure or can leak transmission fluid into the intake manifold, producing smoke
at the tailpipe. 
504
Auto Repair For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

valve cover: A metal lid located on top of the cylinder head on vehicles with over-
head valves. The valve cover is removed when adjustable valves need adjusting.
valves: Found in the cylinder head, valves open and close to allow fuel and air to
enter the combustion chamber and exhaust gases to leave it. They are opened
by means of valve lifters, push rods, rocker arms, and overhead camshaft lobes,
and closed by springs. See also exhaust valve, intake valve, timing belt, and
timing chain.
vaporize: To convert a liquid into a mist by breaking it into small particles and
mixing it with air. Fuel injector nozzles spray tiny amounts of gasoline or other
fuel into the ignition chamber, vaporizing it to produce a combustible fuel/air
mixture.
VIN (vehicle identification number): A unique number found on the left-hand
corner where the dashboard meets the window as well as on the registration and
other paperwork for each vehicle.
viscosity: The thickness or pourability of a liquid. Oil comes in a variety of thick-
nesses, or weights, as well as in single viscosity (single-weight oil) and in a blend
of viscosities (multi-weight oil), which enable it to flow easily in cold weather and
reduce thinning in hot weather. The higher the weight, the greater the viscosity of
the oil. You can find the weight of the oil on the outside of the bottle.
voltage regulator: An electrical device that controls or regulates the electric volt-
age generated by the alternator. On many vehicles this is an integral part of the
alternator rather than a separate component, or this function may be performed
by the PCM.
V-type engine: An engine in which the cylinders occur in two rows set at an angle
to each other, with the crankshaft running through the point of the V. V-type
engines are identified by number of cylinders as V6, V8, and so on.
warning lights: See malfunction indicator lights (MIL).
warranty: A promise by an automaker or dealership to fix or replace parts on a new
vehicle if they malfunction before a specific time or distance has elapsed. See also
guarantee.
water jackets: Channels in the engine through which water and coolant
(antifreeze) circulate to cool the engine. See also cooling system.
water pump: A device that circulates the liquid through the cooling system by
pumping it from the engine water jackets to the radiator.
water separator: A device found on diesel vehicles that removes any water that
may have contaminated the diesel fuel.
wheel alignment: See alignment.
505
Appendix A: A Practical Glossary of Automotive Terms

wheel balancing: A procedure that ensures that the weight of a wheel and tire
assembly is distributed evenly so that your vehicle moves smoothly at any speed,
with no vibration in the steering wheel or other areas. Usually, the wheel and tire
assembly is removed from the vehicle and placed on a balancing machine, which
measures imbalance and indicates the points around the rim where small weights
must be mounted in order to make the wheel vibration-free, especially at highway
speeds.
wheel bearings: The inner and outer bearings found at each wheel that cushion
the contact between the wheel and the spindle it sits on. They’re packed with
grease to prevent wear from the friction produced by the turning wheels. See
also bearings.
wheel cylinder: On drum brake systems, a small cylinder, located at each wheel
brake, that uses brake fluid to exert hydraulic pressure, which forces the brake
shoes against the brake drums and stops the vehicle. See also calipers.
zero-emission vehicles (ZEV): Vehicles that produce no emissions when running.
Some state laws mandating the production of ZEVs, especially in California, have
motivated carmakers to comply, mostly by accelerated research and develop-
ment of electric vehicles (EV). See also partial zero-emission vehicles (PZEV).
