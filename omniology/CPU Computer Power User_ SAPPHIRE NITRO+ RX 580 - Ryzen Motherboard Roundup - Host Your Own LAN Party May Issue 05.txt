EVGA Upgrades Its Bronze PSU 
Lineup With Smaller B3 Models 
EVGA has released a new series of power supplies that are 
rated at 80-PLUS Bronze efficiency. The new B3 Series 
is more compact in size than the preceding B2, plus 
it incorporates some nice new features. The B3 Series 
is available in 450W, 550W, 650W, 750W, and 850W 
capacities. The units measure just 150mm long for the 
450/550/650, and 160mm for the 750/850. EVGA says 
its latest bronze series now has modular cables and comes 
with the company’s ECO Intelligent Thermal Control 
System, which keeps the fan turned off until the PSU hits 
a certain load level. EVGA says the hydraulic dynamic 
bearing fan in the B3 also runs quieter and has a longer life 
span. The new power supplies target price-conscious users 
who still want a quality product. MSRPs for the B3 PSUs 
are as follows: 450/$49.99; 550/$59.99; 650/$69.99; 
750/$89.99; and 850/$99.99. 
G.SKILL Cranks Up To 4,333MHz & 
More With New Trident DDR4 Kits
Memory manufacturer G.SKILL has announced a new ultra-
fast Trident Z memory kit. The company said its new Trident 
Z DDR4-4333MHz 16GB is the first desktop memory 
available in the market at that speed that uses two 8GB 
modules. The 1.4V memory has latency timings of CL19-19-
19-39. In addition to this new speedy kit, G.SKILL says it has 
other kits in the same family under development that are even 
faster. As proof, the company released a stress test screenshot 
showing a 16GB DDR4 kit with memory timings of CL19-
19-19-39 reaching speeds of 4,402MHz, and another 
screenshot of a 16GB kit with the same timings breaking 
4,500MHz. The company says the DDR4-4500MHz kit was 
a “proof of concept.” The DDR4-4400MHz memory kit is 
actively being developed, but G.SKILL says it will “require 
some time to be ready for market production.”

Thermaltake’s View 28 RGB Is An 
ATX Chassis With Gullwing Panel
Thermaltake has a new ATX midtower chassis series called 
View 28 that includes a windowed side panel that wraps 
around the top of the case. The company says the gullwing 
panel design permits you to admire every component in 
your build from the side as well as the top. (There’s a tinted 
front panel as well.) There are two versions of the chassis: a 
base edition that comes with a 120mm exhaust fan, and a 
Riing Edition version that comes with one of Thermaltake’s 
Riing RGB fans. The chassis of the View 28 RGB comes 
with an RGB LED controller integrated into the upper 
front panel. The RGB Matrix controller button lets you 
control all the lighting in your system. The tool-free chassis 
comes with a PSU shroud, and there’s room for a dual-slot 
GPU up to 410mm and multiple drives. Fans of liquid 
coolers can place a 360mm radiator in the front. 
Biostar Intros Mini-ITX For Ryzen
BIOSTAR is adding two more models to its RACING Series 
of motherboards. The company says the new RACING 
X370GTN and RACING B350GTN are not only the world’s 
first Mini-ITX motherboards developed for AMD’s Ryzen 
platform, they’re also the first boards sporting the X370 and 
B350 chipsets that are RGB. The RACING X370GTN and 
RACING B350GTN are both equipped with the BIOSTAR 
5050 LED Fun Zone package that includes two 5050 LED 
headers and VIVID LED DJ software to control your system’s 
lighting. The two motherboards support other BIOSTAR 
features as well, such as the company’s FLY.NET networking 
utility that allocates more bandwidth to online gaming. The 
boards have two DIMMs and can handle up to 32GB of 
DDR4-3200 (OC). They support USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C 
(one port each) and have one M.2 and four SATA3 6Gbps 
connectors. MSRP for the RACING X370GTN is $129, 
while the price of the RACING B350GTN is $109.
NVIDIA Springs New Top-Of-The-Line 
Pascal Graphics Card, The Titan Xp 
Just weeks after launching the powerful GeForce 1080 Ti, 
NVIDIA unveiled a new top-of-the-line graphics card called 
the Titan Xp. The latest card to carry the Titan title has 3,840 
CUDA cores and a boost clock speed of 1,582MHz. It has 
12GB of GDDR5X, a memory speed of 11.4Gbps, and a total 
memory bandwidth of 547.7GBps. NVIDIA says the Titan Xp 
with Pascal architecture is capable of processing up to 12Tflops 
and offers up to three times the graphics performance of the 
previous Titan version, the Titan X with Maxwell architecture. 
The new two-slot Titan Xp card draws 250W of power and 
has one 8-pin and one 6-pin power connector. The card keeps 
temperatures under control by using vapor-chamber cooling. 
The MSRP for the Titan Xp is $1,200. Enthusiasts with extra-
deep pockets will be thrilled to hear the card supports SLI 
(NVIDIA has 2-, 3-, and 4-way bridges available for $39).

FSP Launches New Dagger Series 
PSUs For Small-Form-Factor Systems
FSP Group announced a new line of SFX power supplies. 
The Dagger series is launching with two models: the 500W 
and 600W. 
The new PSUs have a single 12V rail and are rated 80-PLUS 
Gold for efficiency. They are fully modular and are equipped 
with flat ribbon cables. FSP says the Dagger series uses high-
quality Japanese capacitors, and each unit is cooled with a 
dual ball-bearing fan. The company says the SFX Dagger has 
twice the power density as a typical ATX power supply.
The Dagger 500W has an MSRP of $99, while the Dagger 
600W is priced at $109. Both models have a five-year warranty.
Republic Of Gamers Launches 
ROG Gladius II Gaming Mouse
ROG has a new Gladius mouse. The ROG Gladius II 
updates the original with a more sensitive optical sensor, 
topping out at 12,000dpi as opposed to 6,400dpi. The 
Omron switches have been upgraded as well and are now 
rated at 50 million clicks instead of 20 million. You can 
still swap out switches to match your taste and gaming 
style, only now there are rubber covers instead of sticky 
adhesive pads on the screws you remove to change out 
parts. Along with the original DPI switch that lets FPS 
gamers adjust sensitivity when aiming, ASUS says there’s 
now a DPI target button near the thumb, so you can make 
adjustments with less interference to gameplay. The new 
Gladius II is RGB and supports ASUS Aura Sync.
MSI Announces New GAMING X+ 
GeForce Graphics Card Series
MSI continues to segment its graphics card offerings and has 
announced a new GAMING X+ series that uses GeForce 
GTX 10 Series GPUs. The GAMING X+ appears to fall 
between the GAMING X and GAMING Z series in terms 
of power and performance. So far, MSI has announced two 
GAMING X+ cards based on the GTX 1080: the GTX 
1080 GAMING X+ 8G and the GTX 1080 GAMING X+ 
6G. Aside from differing amounts of GDDR5 memory as 
indicated in the names, the cards also differ in clock speeds. 
The GTX 1080 GAMING X+ 6G uses a GP106-400 GPU 
and has base/boost clocks of 1,594/1,809MHz, while the 
GTX 1080 GAMING X+ 8G uses a GP104-400 GPU and 
has base/boost clocks of 1,771/1,911MHz.

Android Reaches “Milestone 
In Technology History” 
Android has officially taken the reign as the world’s most 
popular operating system for internet use away from 
Microsoft—though just barely, according to the most recent 
numbers from web analytics provider StatCounter. At 37.93%, 
Android’s share of the worldwide OS internet usage market 
is just ahead of Microsoft’s 37.91%. “This is a milestone in 
technology history and the end of an era,” said StatCounter 
CEO Aodhan Cullen. “It marks the end of Microsoft’s 
leadership worldwide of the OS market, which it has held since 
the 1980s.” The growth in the smartphone market, combined 
with declining sales of traditional PCs, drove the shift.
Microsoft has little to fear in the worldwide operating system 
desktop market, though, according to StatCounter. The 
group’s most recent North America numbers show Microsoft 
with a 39.5% share, followed by iOS with 25.7% and 
Android with 21.2%.
“Lip Passwords” Could Offer 
New Authentication Alternative
Researchers at Hong 
Kong Baptist University 
believe a lip-motion 
password technique 
they’re developing could 
change the way we 
access secure systems 
and areas. As the name 
implies, a lip-motion 
password uses a person’s 
lip motions to create a 
password, extracting the visual features of lip shape, texture, 
and movement to characterize a person’s lip sequence, which a 
system matches with the password content for authentication. 
Department of Computer Science Professor Cheung 
Yiu-ming said the lip password has a number of advantages over 
conventional access-control methods. Lip passwords can’t be 
mimicked, so a system can validate a user while also rejecting 
both the correct password spoken by an imposter and the 
incorrect password spoken by the user. Compared to current 
voice-based authentication, Yiu-ming said, a lip password is less 
susceptible to background noise and distance, plus a speech-
impaired person could use the technology. In addition, speakers 
of any language can use lip passwords, and users can reset lip 
passwords as needed. The technology can work by itself or in 
conjunction with other biometrics such as facial recognition. 
SOFTWARE SHORTS
$7.9 million gross revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 
to more than $58 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, 
according to Sensor Tower. Other app categories also saw 
increased spending year-over-year: photo and video spending 
was up from $0.30 in 2015 to $0.70 in 2016, while spending 
on music was up from $3.40 to $3.60.
Although spending on apps increased, the 
actual number of app downloads and installs 
declined slightly. In the fourth quarter of 
2016, the average iPhone user downloaded 
33 apps, down from an average of 36 a year 
earlier. Social networking apps saw the biggest 
decline, going from an average of 3.3 apps 
to 2.3 apps over the past year. Game app 
downloads were also down slightly, from 10.5 
in 2015 to 9.9 in 2016. 
iPhone Users Spending More 
On Apps & In-App Purchases  
Owners of iPhones in the United States spent about 14% more 
on apps and in-app purchases last year, according to a study by 
Sensor Tower Store Intelligence. The average user spent $40 in 
2016, with more than 80%, or $27, of that spent on games. 
The biggest gains were in the entertainment 
category, which includes apps such as HBO 
NOW, Hulu, and Netflix, Sensor Tower 
reports. Although dollar-wise the number 
is small (iPhone users spent about $2.30 
on entertainment apps last year), spending 
was up 130% from the $1 the average user 
spent on entertainment apps in 2015. In 
the entertainment category, Netflix saw its 
App Store subscriptions increase from about

Twitter Rolls Out Version 
Designed To Minimize Data Use  
Twitter knows there are barriers to using its program: slow 
mobile networks, expensive data plans, and lack of storage on 
mobile devices, to name a few. Its newest mobile version—
available via smartphone or tablet at mobile.twitter.com—
loads more quickly over slow connections, takes up less space 
on mobile devices, and is more resilient to unreliable mobile 
networks, the company notes. Twitter Lite still has the key 
features of Twitter, including the timeline, Tweets, Direct 
Messages, trends, profiles, media uploads, and notifications, 
but with 30% faster launch times and quicker navigation, 
according to Twitter. A new data-saver mode lets you preview 
images and videos before fully loading them, saving mobile 
data. Offline support ensures you’ll be able to use the site if 
you temporarily lose your connection. Twitter Lite is available 
to users around the world, but the company notes it will be 
especially helpful to users in emerging markets throughout 
the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, and Africa, allowing 
many users to experience Twitter for the first time.
Nokia, Facebook Break 
Spectral Efficiency Records
A technology being developed by Nokia Bell Labs could increase 
the capacity of subsea links by about 2.5 times, according to 
recent tests conducted by Nokia and Facebook. Probabilistic 
constellation shaping, or PCS, technology uses “shaped” QAM 
(quadrature amplitude modulation) formats that can flexibly 
adjust transmission capacity to near the physical limits of each 
fiber-optic link. Nokia and Facebook tested PCS on a 5,500km 
submarine cable between New York and Ireland. The test achieved 
a record spectral efficiency of 7.46b/s/Hz, which Nokia notes 
shows the potential to upgrade that cable to 32Tbps per fiber. 
Dr. Stephen Grubb, Facebook’s global optical network architect, 
said the demonstration shows PCS can achieve capacities close to 
what’s called the Shannon limit, or the maximum transfer rate of 
a communications channel. Such advancements ensure companies 
are maximizing their investments in submarine cable systems and 
lowering the cost per bit of submarine transport, he said.

Job Of The Month
Every business seeks to develop technology that will give it an edge over the competition, but nowhere 
is that need more critical than for companies in the defense industry. General Dynamics is a leading 
player in national defense, and the company is always looking for top-notch technical talent. If you’re a 
new engineering or computer sciences graduate, you might want to check out entry-level opportunities 
at GD. The company currently has an embedded software engineer position at its Dedham, 
Massachusetts, offices that is designated for new grads. Candidates must have a B.S. in engineering 
or equivalent and experience with Agile is preferred. You’ll need to be able to pass a background check, 
too, as the person in this position must be able to obtain a secret security clearance. Job details are 
somewhat vague, as you might expect, but GD says you’ll be part of a team that analyzes requirements 
and then designs, builds, and tests software apps and systems for new company products.

Robot-a-job-alypse
Pundits have been warning us for some time that 
robots are coming to take all our jobs, but that may 
not happen as soon as they think. Forrester now 
predicts that robots, job automation, and artificial 
intelligence will claim about 24.7 million jobs in the 
next 10 years, but (and this is the good part) the 
new technologies will create 14.9 million new jobs, 
too. So although there’s still a net loss of some 9.8 
million jobs in the United States by 2027 due to the 
ongoing robot invasion, it might not be as catastrophic as some folks would have you believe.

And Now, For Your 
Moment Of (Ry)Zen 
AM4 Motherboard Roundup
all the boards with the flagship Ryzen 
7 1800X. Graphics horsepower was 
provided by the GIGABYTE GeForce 
GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming, while speedy 
storage was provided by the 480GB 
Patriot Hellfire. 
Speaking of high-speed storage, AMD 
Ryzen processors have four dedicated 
PCIe 3.0 storage lanes to provide up 
to 32Gbps of bandwidth for PCIe and 
SATA SSDs. Almost all X370 and B350 
motherboards include a 32Gbps M.2 
slot. Unfortunately, neither the X370 
nor B350 chipsets natively provide 
additional PCIe 3.0 lanes. Some X370 
motherboards do offer a second M.2 
port, but typically the additional M.2 
port is only wired for PCIe 2.0 x4 
(20Gbps) speed. No boards we reviewed 
have supported RAID over M.2 SSDs.
The AM4 platform does allow you to 
create RAID configurations with SATA 
devices, and the X370 chipset natively 
supports up to four 6Gbps SATA ports 
(in RAID 0, 1, and 10 configurations) 
and up to two SATA Express ports. 
The X370 chipset also provides eight 
general-purpose PCIe 2.0 lanes that can 
be used for additional connectivity, such 
as more SATA and USB ports. As you 
might expect, the native B350 chipset 
offers slightly less connectivity with just 
two 6Gbps SATA ports and six general-
purpose PCIe 2.0 lanes.
Motherboard manufacturers add their 
own custom touches to the X370 and 
B350 chipsets that, for example, improve 
overclocking potential, sound quality, and 
network connectivity. With fewer free 
general-purpose lanes than Intel’s recent 
chipsets, it’s critical for manufacturers 
Ryzen processors have an integrated 
dual-channel DDR4 memory controller. 
With AMD’s X370 and B350 chipsets, 
motherboard manufacturers can support 
overclocked memory (Ryzen processors 
support up to DDR4-2667), but as we 
began work on this roundup, memory 
support was still a work in progress. As 
an example, we tested the boards in our 
roundup with a 16GB HyperX Predator 
DDR4-3200 kit, and although all the 
motherboards were able to boot using the 
3,200MHz XMP settings, benchmark 
numbers were sometimes better with the 
kit running at 2,933MHz.
When we brought this up, mother-
board companies told us that it’s 
important to always use memory that’s 
been qualified and tested for the specific 
board—not currently as easy task 
for a roundup. To fairly compare the 
motherboards, we tested all the boards 
using the HyperX Predator’s 2,933MHz 
profile. In general, qualified high-speed 
kits vary widely from board to board, 
though most support up to DDR4-3200 
in some capacity. Just as we were going 
to press (and once all of our benchmark 
testing was complete), AMD told us it 
had recently released new microcode 
that will improve memory capability; 
some vendors had updated their BIOS 
downloads accordingly, while others 
had not. Go to your motherboard 
manufacturer’s website and look for a 
BIOS with AGESA 1.0.0.4a firmware. 
You might have to apply a BIOS update, 
of course, but it looks like AMD is 
addressing the issue.
In addition to the 16GB HyperX 
Predator DDR4-3200 memory, we tested 
A
MD is not throwing away its shot. 
In the spirit of the “Hamilton” 
refrain, Team Red has proved to be 
scrappy and hungry to get back into 
the enthusiast market with its Ryzen 
processors. Smashing every expectation, 
AMD is ready to rise up and contend 
with Intel’s monarchy.
As with most major CPU architecture 
changes, moving to Ryzen means you’ll 
need a new motherboard. Ryzen’s AM4 
platform introduces several new chipsets, 
including X370, B350, A320, X300, and 
A300. Thus far, motherboard makers 
have gravitated toward the X370 and 
B370 chipsets, as these two platforms 
both support overclocking and have 
better onboard connectivity, such as 
native USB 3.1 ports and more general-
purpose lanes, than the A320, X300, or 
A300 chipsets. Our roundup includes 
three X370 motherboards and one B350 
board, so you can get a general idea of 
the differences. 
The X370 chipset is the option 
mostly likely to attract enthusiasts, 
because it supports both SLI and 
CrossFire configurations. Similar to 
Intel’s recent mainstream processors, 
Ryzen CPUs provide 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes 
for graphics use. When two GPUs are 
installed, the X370 chipset splits this 
bandwidth into x8/x8. Some X370 
motherboards also support 3-way 
CrossFire, though the third PCIe x16 
slot is typically wired for only PCIe 
2.0 x4 bandwidth. The B350 chipset 
doesn’t support SLI at all, and though 
CrossFire is possible on some B350 
motherboards, GPU lane bandwidth is 
split at PCIe 3.0 x16/PCIe 2.0 x4.

board with only an 8-pin EPS connector. 
Similar to many other MSI boards, the 
X370 XPOWER GAMING TITANIUM 
features Military Class 5 components 
with titanium chokes and dark capacitors 
for VRM duties. 
To quickly resolve any issues, there’s 
a debug LED, as well as power, reset, 
clear CMOS, and BIOS flashback 
buttons. Speaking of the BIOS, we like 
the MSI includes a search feature in 
its BIOS interface, so you can quickly 
find the voltages and frequencies you 
want to adjust.
MSI provides one of the more 
detailed qualified vendor lists for 
memory compatibility you’ll find, which 
is especially critical with AM4 boards 
as mentioned earlier. As of press time, 
MSI lists support for DDR4 modules as 
fast as DDR4-3200. This board is one 
where the benchmark numbers with our 
HyperX kit were slightly better with the 
kit’s DDR4-2933 profile.
Similar to its Z270 sibling, the X370 
XPOWER GAMING TITANIUM 
offers some power user extras for 
system storage. There are two M.2 
ports, and the top slot comes with 
MSI’s M.2 Shield and supports up 
to 32Gbps bandwidth. The second 
M.2 slot—powered by four PCIe 2.0 
lanes—restricts bandwidth to 20Gbps, 
but we still like that MSI gives you the 
flexibility to install two M.2 devices. A 
U.2 port provides further high-speed 
storage options, while six 6Gbps ports 
offer connectivity for SATA SSDs 
and HDDs.
The X370 XPOWER GAMING 
TITANIUM was all-around performer 
with top scores in two games, the 
CPU-intensive POV-Ray 3.7, and the 
storage-intensive CrystalDiskMark 
5.1.2. The board delivered the best 
frame rates in both Metro: Last Light 
(102fps) and Dying Light (144fps), 
and barely missed the top frame 
rate in Witcher 3 (74fps). The M.2 
Shield appeared to have a positive 
effect on the 480GB Patriot Hellfire’s 
speed, as the X370 XPOWER 
GAMING TITANIUM swept the 
2 audio suite. The X370 XPOWER 
GAMING TITANIUM isn’t a carbon 
copy, though, and lacks some of the 
high-end amenities of the Z270 version, 
such as the OC Dashboard daughterboard 
for overclocking.
Despite not having all of the over-
clocking conveniences of its Z270 
sibling, the X370 XPOWER GAMING 
TITANIUM is still a good option for 
enthusiasts considering a hefty Ryzen 
overclock. Completely digital power 
delivery and load-line calibration, for 
example, is onboard to ensure precise 
power delivery to the CPU. MSI includes 
both an 8-pin and 4-pin CPU power 
connector, so your Ryzen processor can 
receive more electrical current than a 
to make smart use of what’s available. 
We think all the motherboards in our 
roundup do a suitable job of adding value 
to the respective chipset.
MSI X370 XPOWER 
GAMING TITANIUM
We examined the Z270 XPOWER 
GAMING TITANIUM in last month’s 
Z270 roundup, and as you might expect, 
MSI’s X370 chipset variant offers a 
similar mix of high-end features for 
enthusiasts. Key reappearances include 
MSI’s M.2 Shield that helps prevent 
thermal throttling with M.2 SSDs, 
additional power for the CPU socket 
and PEG slots, and immersive sound via 
Audio Boost 4 hardware and the Nahimic

ASRock engineers put in some 
extensive work into power delivery on 
the X370 Taichi. In addition to the 
12+4-phase design, an IR (International 
Rectifier) digital power controller routes 
juice to the Ryzen processor, ideal for 
achieving optimal overclocks. Premium 
heat-resistant chokes are used for both 
the CPU and memory power to improve 
stability under load. ASRock’s Hyper 
BCLK Engine II serves as the base clock 
generator and allows for BCLK up to 
136MHz. Impressively, ASRock rates the 
board for up to 300-watt TDP overclocks.
When it comes to memory speed, 
ASRock qualifies a number of memory 
kits at DDR4-3200, and our test system 
quickly posted with the 16GB HyperX 
Predator kit running at 3,200MHz. 
But similar to MSI’s X370 GAMING 
TITANIUM, scores were marginally 
better at the 2,933MHz profile.
For high-end GPU configurations, 
ASRock equips the X370 with two PCIe 
3.0 x16 slots that support both SLI and 
CrossFire (or Quad-SLI and CrossFire 
with dual-GPU cards). We like that 
ASRock provides two slots’ worth of space 
between them, as this layout improves 
airflow with two add-on cards. At the 
bottom of board, there’s also a PCIe 2.0 
x16 slot wired for x4 speed that shares 
bandwidth with the bottom M.2 slot. 
Installing an add-on card into the bottom 
PCIe x16 slot disables the second M.2 
slot, and vice versa. We’d have preferred to 
see ASRock switch off the board’s PCIe x1 
slots and SATA ports.
The top M.2 slot is where you’ll want 
to install your high-speed storage devices, 
because it has access to four PCIe 3.0 
lanes. This M.2 slot is also compatible 
with ASRock’s optional U.2 adapter, 
should your build plan call for a U.2 
device. SATA connectivity is generous 
with a total of 10 6Gbps SATA ports. 
Eight of the ports support RAID 0, 1, 
and 10 configurations. 
In our benchmark tests, the X370 
Taichi was competitive across the board, 
yet the motherboard shined the brightest 
in SiSoftware Sandra 2017 processor 
tests. Top marks include the Dhrystone 
ASRock X370 Taichi
Balancing performance, connectivity, 
and cost on a motherboard is a tough 
job, one ASRock appears to be quite 
good at, based on the X370 Taichi. 
ASRock manages to include 12+4-phase 
power delivery, an external base clock 
generator, two M.2 ports, and onboard 
802.11ac Wi-Fi for only $209.99. We 
give the X370 Taichi style points, as 
well, thanks to the white and black 
clockwork theme that runs through 
the PCB and heatsinks. The only con 
of such an impressive design? ASRock 
tells us it has been difficult to keep 
up with demand at retail. 
CrystalDiskMark results with the fastest 
sequential read/write and random 4K 
read/write numbers.
As of press time, the X370 XPOWER 
GAMING TITANIUM was the most 
expensive X370 chipset motherboard 
available on Newegg by $45 and 
cost $80 more than the majority of 
available X370 boards. The board’s 
robust overclocking capabilities and 
impressive performance certainly make 
it worth consideration for performance 
enthusiasts, but if you’re looking for 
an install-and-forget-it board, it might 
be worth taking a long look at more 
affordable options.

source that compensates for voltage drop 
over long cable runs. Inside the BIOS, 
you can add up to 0.3V to the original 
USB output voltage, should you need to 
strengthen signal stability.
Gamers building a system around 
Ryzen should like the onboard audio 
and network amenities on the GA-
AX370-Gaming K7. The board includes 
two audio codecs (one for front-panel 
inputs and one for inputs on the rear 
panel) that support up to 120dB SNR 
and hardware decoding of DSD128. To 
avoid distortion with high-end headsets, 
there are smart headphone amplifiers 
that will automatically detect headset 
impedance and deliver an appropriate 
mode. The GA-AX370-Gaming K7 
features seven onboard temperature 
sensors, as well as two external 
temperature sensors that you can place 
anywhere inside your case. You can 
customize which sensor a particular fan/
pump header will respond to, as well 
as fan speed profiles to ideally balance 
noise level and cooling performance. 
The GA-AX370-Gaming K7 comes 
with GIGABYTE’s USB DAC-UP 
2 technology to improve performance 
with VR headsets and other high-power 
USB hardware. USB DAC-UP 2 ports 
(the two yellow USB 3.0 ports on the 
rear panel, as well as the internal USB 
3.0 headers) boast a dedicated power 
AV2 (304.7GIPS) and Whetstone AVX 
(195.57GIPS) tests, as well as Multi-
Media Integer (578.2Mpixels per 
second) and Multi-Media Quad ALU x1 
(3.83Mpixels per second) tests. The X370 
Taichi also went wild in The Witcher 3, 
with 75fps. 
ASRock provides a lot of valuable 
power user additions to the X370 
Taichi, so it has some undeniable appeal 
to enthusiasts on a budget. We also 
like that ASRock gives the board some 
overclocking chops. Hopefully more units 
will be available by the time you read this.
AORUS GA-AX370-Gaming K7
The GA-AX370-Gaming K7 is the 
AORUS flagship for the X370 chipset. 
Like all the AORUS boards we’ve 
reviewed thus far, RGB LEDs can be 
found along the PCB edges, under the 
heatsinks, and near the slots. Modders 
and enthusiasts in search of a “wow” 
factor won’t find a much flashier option 
than the GA-AX370-Gaming K7. We 
also like that the LEDs can be split into 
multiple zones, including a separate 
zone for third-party RGB and RGBW 
light strips, to allow for accent colors. 
A plethora of performance additions are 
onboard, as well.
When Ryzen was first announced, 
the slightly more affordable GA-AX370-
Gaming 5 was our first look at the X370 
chipset. The AX370-Gaming K7 is 
similar in many ways, including support 
for a PCIe, NVMe M.2 (or U.2) SSD, 
four USB 3.1 ports on the rear panel, 
and 6+4-phase digital power delivery. 
Turbo B-Clock technology is the most 
notable addition to the GA-AX370-
Gaming K7, as you can make linear 
adjustments to the BCLK all the way up 
to 300MHz. In essence, Turbo B-Clock 
provides you another way to overclock 
your Ryzen CPU. 
 GIGABYTE designs the AORUS 
GA-AX370-Gaming K7 to be extremely 
builder-friendly. There are eight 4-pin 
hybrid headers that will automatically 
detect if the connected device is a fan 
or water pump and will correspondingly 
dole out juice in PWM or voltage 
Specs: Max memory: 64GB DDR4 (DDR4-2667; Max OC: DDR4-3600); Slots: 2 PCIe 3.0 x16, 1 PCIe

is wired for the full PCIe 3.0 x16 
bandwidth, while the second x16 slot 
works electrically at PCIe 2.0 x4 speed. 
If you install an M.2 SSD in the top 
M.2 slot (the 32Gbps slot), the Gaming 
K4 will also disable the second PCIe 
x16 slot. In short, it’s likely power users 
will want to stick with a single-GPU 
setup, but the same is true for most 
other B350 chipset boards. 
The Fatal1ty AB350 Gaming K4 
has a number of features to enhance 
the gaming experience. There’s a Key 
Master utility, for example, that lets you 
create macros, sniper modes, and repeat 
delays on your mouse and keyboard. 
For immersive sound, ASRock adds 
Creative’s Sound Blaster Cinema 3 with 
3,200MHz, and you can install up to 
64GB of system memory. 
Most B350 chipset motherboards 
include one 32Gbps M.2 port, but that’s 
generally the extent of M.2 support. The 
Fatal1ty AB350 Gaming K4 provides a 
second M.2 port where you can install 
a SATA M.2 SSD. This M.2 port would 
be ideal for a large capacity M.2 drive 
serving as file storage. The board also 
features six 6Gbps ports, some of which 
will be disabled if you install a drive into 
the bottom SATA M.2 slot.
ASRock equips the Fatal1ty AB350 
Gaming K4 with two PCIe 3.0 
slots—and as is standard for the B350 
chipset—these slots operate differently 
than the X370 chipset. The top slot 
sound fidelity level. There are two NICs 
onboard, one Killer E2500 and one 
Intel i211, should users prefer one NIC 
architecture over another. 
3DMark’s Fire Strike Extreme test 
had held all of the other boards in this 
roundup under an overall score of 9900. 
The GA-AX370-Gaming K7 wasn’t 
having any of that, busting out an overall 
score of 10,062 that was highlighted 
by a Physics Score of 18701. This 
motherboard was also the top performer 
in SiSoftware Sandra 2017’s Memory 
Bandwidth tests, producing a 34GBps 
score in both the Integer and Floating 
tests. Benchmark numbers were also 
excellent in the CPU-intensive Cinebench 
15 and POV-Ray 3.7.
GIGABYTE continues to impress with 
the AORUS brand. The GA-AX370-
Gaming K7 is an attractive motherboard 
with an eye toward extreme tweakers and 
gamers. We also like that this board had 
no performance drop when our HyperX 
kit was clocked at the 3,200MHz profile. 
It could have benefited from a second 
M.2 slot (all the other options in this 
roundup have a second M.2 slot), but 
there’s plenty here to satisfy power users.
ASRock Fatal1ty AB350 Gaming K4
The Fatal1ty AB350 Gaming K4 is the 
one board in this roundup based on the 
B350 chipset. As a reminder, the B350 
chipset limits support of dual-GPU 
setups and has fewer native SATA ports 
and general-purpose lanes. Otherwise, the 
B350 chipset supports much of the X370 
chipset’s connectivity, such as 32Gbps 
M.2 slots and overclocking for the Ryzen 
CPU and system memory. 
In general, motherboards based on the 
B350 chipset have fewer overclocking 
amenities than the X370 chipset. 
ASRock, though, doesn’t disregard 
overclocking as an option with the 
Fatal1ty AB350 Gaming K4. Similar 
to the X370 Taichi, power delivery is 
completely digital and passes through 
premium power chokes. The Gaming 
K4 also boasts a 6+3 power phase 
design. ASRock has qualified the board 
to support DDR4 memory at up to 
Specs: Max memory: 64GB DDR4 (DDR4-2667; Max OC: DDR4-3200); Slots: 2 PCIe 3.0 x16, 4 PCIe 2.0 
x1; Storage: 2 M.2 (slot 1 supports type 2242/2260/2280, slot 2 supports 2230/2242/2260/2280/22110), 
6 6Gbps SATA; Rear I/O: 1 HDMI, 1 DVI-D, 1 VGA, 6 USB 3.0 (1 Type-C, 5 Type-A), 2 USB 2.0, 1 PS/2, 1 
Ethernet, audio I/O; Form factor: ATX; Warranty: 3 years

Reality 3D technology that brings 
virtual surround sound to stereo 
headphones or speakers. You can 
customize the audio experience 
via the SBX Pro Studio software. 
Benchmark-wise, the Fata1ty 
AB350 Gaming K4 was always 
going to struggle against the 
higher-priced X370 chipset 
boards. But despite not winning 
any of the tests, if you scan 
through the results, you’ll see 
there’s hardly any drop-off in 
most of our tests. It’s clear that 
the motherboard can produce top-
notch numbers when paired with 
high-end components.
Budget-minded enthusiasts 
who don’t plan on using a 
dual-GPU setup should certainly 
consider the B350 chipset. 
The Fatal1ty AB350 Gaming 
K4 is one of the more capable 
B350 chipset motherboards on 
the market. And at $109.99, 
it’s $100 less than the least 
expensive X370 option in 
this roundup. 
The AMD Adventure Continues
With the recent release of 
Ryzen 5 processors (and the 
expected release of Ryzen 3 
processors later this year), AMD 
continues to fill out its CPU 
roster at all price points. A Ryzen 
7 chip is still likely the best 
pairing for MSI’s X370 XPOWER 
GAMING TITANIUM and 
its overclocking features. The 
ASRock X370 Taichi is also 
overclock-ready and is quite a 
bit more affordable. The AORUS 
GA-AX370-Gaming K7 is feature-
rich for gamers and would go well 
with any Ryzen chip. Need to 
shave some budget off your Ryzen 
build and still want performance? 
Consider the well-designed 
ASRock Fatal1ty AB350 Gaming 
K4 and a Ryzen 5 processor. ■

based on the H110 chipset. Wireless 
connectivity is onboard, too. The Trident 
3 Arctic comes with an Intel Dual Band 
Wireless-AC 3165 module that supports 
both 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.2.
The Trident 3 Arctic is a solid 
gaming platform and is designed to 
seamlessly work with your home theater 
environment. MSI ensures support for 
Xbox Play Anywhere and Playstation 
Now, should you already own a console 
title and want to play on the high-end 
Trident 3 Arctic hardware. MSI also 
indicates you can play with a controller, if 
you prefer it over a keyboard and mouse.
Unlike a console, you’ll also be able to 
upgrade the Trident 3, as MSI allows you 
to access the key hardware, such as the 
storage or graphics card, to keep up with 
future hardware requirements. On the 
side opposite the power button, there’s 
a slight indentation on the panel cover, 
which gives you access to the screws that 
keep the chassis cover in place. Once you 
remove the screws, it’s easy to access the 
various components. 
Any hardware going into a home 
theater environment will need to 
be extremely quiet. MSI equips the 
It’s easy to access the ports you’ll 
need. The front panel includes a separate 
headphone output and microphone 
input, which helps to avoid audio issues 
that can occur with a combo jack. There 
are also two USB 3.0 Type-A ports 
(standard connector), a USB 3.0 Type-C 
port (reversible connector), and a VR 
Link port. The latter is a front-facing 
HDMI port that’s ideal for connecting 
a VR headset. When you do, MSI’s 
GAMING Center software will auto-
detect it and optimize system settings 
for VR performance. If you’re in need 
of more ports, the rear panel provides 
another USB 3.0 port, four USB 2.0 
ports, an Ethernet jack (Intel i219V 
NIC), and additional audio I/O. 
Under the hood, the Trident 3 Arctic 
features a full complement of power user 
hardware. The previously mentioned 
GeForce GTX 1070 comes with 8GB of 
GDDR5 memory, which is important 
because VR games often recommend more 
than 4GB of video memory. The storage 
subsystem boasts a 256GB Intel SSD 
600p Series for the OS drive and a 1TB 
Hitachi Travelstar for file storage. The 
motherboard is a proprietary MSI design 
A
s PC gaming and VR continues to 
move into the mainstream, there’s a 
real need for high-end computers that 
look the part in the social spaces of your 
home. And although we love big rigs with 
colorful liquid cooling loops, custom paint 
jobs, and panels that show off the high-end 
hardware, we know that such builds aren’t 
for everyone and generally don’t mesh 
well with modern interior design. The 
Trident 3 Arctic assimilates into a home 
theater without a second glance. Inside 
this console-sized chassis is an Intel Core 
i7-7700, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070, 
and 16GB of DDR4-2133 memory—
more than enough to power the VR 
experience and games.
The Trident 3 Arctic’s dimensions (2.83 
x 13.63 x 9.15 inches [HxWxD]) are 
extremely close to a PlayStation 4 Pro, 
and the whole system only weighs 6.9 
pounds, so you could conceivably carry it 
in a backpack. MSI also includes a stand, 
so the system can sit vertically if necessary. 
The Arctic version, obviously, features a 
bright white exterior. MSI even installs 
white vents, and there are vents on almost 
every side to allow for airflow—no matter 
if you lay the PC down or sit it up.

and Dying Light (84fps) were both well 
over 60fps. There was also a big boost in 
3DMark’s Fire Strike Extreme test with an 
overall score of 7986—up from 5200 on 
the original Trident.
MSI continues to improve its Gaming 
Desktop lineups, and the Trident 3 
Arctic is a good example of how MSI is 
challenging how we think about small 
form factor systems. As in the high-end 
notebook world—where size constraints 
call for more costly, customized designs—
the Trident 3 Arctic ($1,499) comes at 
a slight price premium, especially if you 
compare costs with similar components. 
But you’d be hard pressed to find a small 
form factor case that will look as nice 
inside a home theater as the console-sized 
Trident 3 Arctic.  ■

Trident 3 with its Silent Storm Cooling 
2, which is a design that separates the 
various heat generating components into 
different chambers with their own airflow. 
The biggest vent on the Trident 3, for 
example, serves as a GPU intake fan, and 
the GeForce GTX 1070 pushes hot air 
out the rear panel and a vent in the side 
panel. Smart thermal design allows the 
Trident 3 Arctic to keep noise levels under 
36dB(A) at full load. In idle, MSI rates 
the Trident 3 Arctic for a noise level of 
25dB(A).
We reviewed MSI’s first Trident 
iteration back in November of last year, 
and the initial Trident boasted a GeForce 
GTX 1060 3GB GPU and an Intel Core 
i7-6700. The Trident 3 Arctic’s upgraded 
hardware—the GeForce GTX 1070, in 
particular—made a big difference in our 
benchmark results. For example, frame 
rates in the Witcher 3 jumped from 36fps 
to 57fps, while Metro: Last Light (82fps)

to spare. Two of the six cores can boost 
up to 4GHz for those poorly-threaded 
applications, and the Ryzen 6 1600X also 
enjoys another 100MHz XFR boost to 
those cores when conditions allow. 
To make sure this constantly shifting 
clockspeed provides tangible benefits, 
AMD has deployed a smart 
grid of interconnected 
s e n s o r s  w i t h i n  e a c h 
Ryzen processor capable 
of granular reporting of 
power and temperatures, 
up to a thousand times 
per second. Pure Power, 
Precision Boost, and the 
aforementioned XFR, which 
account for 3/5ths of AMD’s 
SenseMI technologies, let 
each Ryzen processor tune 
its power consumption behavior to the 
silicon’s specific capabilities. Clockspeed 
adjustments occur in 25MHz increments, 
and performance is directly tied to the 
cooling capacity of your hardware. This 
the system memory, I/O, and PCIe 
devices. This chip features a 192mm2 die 
consisting of 4.8 billion transistors, and 
it is manufactured on Global Foundry’s 
14nm FinFET process. 
The Ryzen 5 1600X is a thirsty 
processor, and to keep its cores hydrated, 
there’s a sizeable 512KB L2 cache per core 
and 16MB of L3 cache shared between 
cores. The core clock is set to 3.6GHz 
and the processor can boost all of its cores 
to 3.7GHz when there’s TDP headroom 
L
ast month we took the shrink wrap off 
the eight-core Ryzen 7 CPUs, and now 
it’s the six-core Ryzen 5 1600X’s turn to 
upend the sub $300 processor market.
The Ryzen 5 1600X is based on the 
same Summit Ridge architecture in the 
Ryzen 7, and in an unprecedented feat of 
engineering, the architecture 
of the Ryzen processors 
realized a 52% increase in 
IPC (instructions per clock) 
compared to Bulldozer. Just 
like in the Ryzen 7s, there 
are two quad-core CCX 
(CPU Complex) units in 
the Ryzen 5 1600X, but 
one core in each module 
has been disabled for a 3+3 
CCX configuration. SMT 
is turned on and lets the 
processor handle up to twelve concurrent 
threads. These units are mounted to 
AMD’s Infinity Fabric, which refers to the 
interface and bus that lets the modules,

support would improve in the 
subsequent weeks and months, 
and our testing of this processor 
appears to bear that out. 
In a move that’s already 
making waves among enthusiasts, 
AMD chose to carry forward 
its practice of unlocking its 
processors for overclocking, 
and as long as you’re using an 
X370 or B350 chipset-based 
motherboard, moving the 
multiplier to give Ryzen a healthy 
boost is easy. With the Ryzen 
5 1600X installed in our MSI 
X370 XPOWER GAMING 
TITANIUM, we managed to 
improve our scores almost across 
the board with a six core clock 
set at 4GHz, with a 1.4V core 
voltage enabled in the UEFI 
setup menu. 
The Ryzen 5 1600X is a beast 
when it comes to single- and 
multi-threaded applications, and 
processor doesn’t ship with a CPU cooler, 
and our testing was performed using the 
EK-XLC Predator 240 AIO liquid cooler, 
which gave us plenty of thermal runway 
to really get this processor flying. The two 
SenseMI technologies not directly related 
to clockspeed adjustments are Neural Net 
Prediction and Smart Prefetch, which 
aim to assist in preloading necessary 
instructions into cache, anticipating 
the location of future data calls, and 
determining the best route for data to 
travel through the processor.
Even though it has two fewer cores to 
work with, the Ryzen 5 1600X is still a 
95-watt processor, just like the Ryzen 7 
1800X. There’s an onboard dual-channel 
DDR4 memory controller that supports 
speeds up to 2,666MHz with two single-
rank DRAM modules. However, with the 
help of an overclocked memory profile, 
we were able to test the processor with 
a 16GB GeIL EVO X kit clocked at 
3,200MTps. In our initial Ryzen 7 review, 
we mentioned that motherboard memory

The only real complaint we had 
with the Founder’s Edition GTX 1080 
Ti was its rather noisy blower-style 
cooler. To keep the AORUS 1080 Ti 
running cool and quiet, GIGABYTE 
m o d i f i e d  i t s  X t re m e  Ga m i n g 
WINDFORCE cooler so that now 
there’s a copper core behind the GPU 
built into the card’s brushed aluminum 
backplate. Over the top of the GPU 
and memory chips, GIGABYTE has 
installed a large copper baseplate. 
On top of that, there’s a heatsink 
with angled fins threaded with 
GIGABYTE’s composite vapor-
chamber-like heatpipes. The middle 
fan in the trio of stacked double 
ball bearing fans spins the opposite 
direction, which spreads cool air over 
more of the card’s surface. There’s also 
some visual flair in the form of RGB 
LED-backlit AORUS and Fan Stop 
base and boost clocks set to 1,480MHz 
and 1,582MHz, respectively. That 
makes this gaming behemoth capable 
of 11.4TFLOPS of raw compute and 
484GBps memory bandwidth, which is 
a few percentage points faster than the 
TITAN X. Compared to the reference 
design card, the AORUS 1080 Ti 
simply soars. 
In its default Gaming Mode, the 
base and boost clocks are locked in 
at 1,569MHz and 1,683MHz. When 
you install the AORUS GRAPHICS 
ENGINE (formerly the Xtreme 
Gaming Engine) utility, you can 
unlock OC Mode to raise the base 
and boost clocks to 1,594MHz and 
1,708MHz, which is up to 228MHz 
faster than the reference design. This 
is the setting we tested the card at, and 
as you can see from the scores, 4K is 
where this card feels most at home. 
A
s much as we love new GPU 
launches, there’s always that dead 
period right after the reference design 
models launch but just before the 
AIBs have had a chance to take off 
the training wheels and really let the 
silicon sing. As we go to press, that 
dead period is over for the GTX 1080 
Ti, and the first custom card we’ve 
been able to test is GIGABYTE’s 
AORUS GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11G. 
This card features the 16nm 
FinFET-based GP102, created with 
12 billion transistors. There are 28 
Streaming Multiprocessors, 3,584 
CUDA Cores, 224 texture units, 
and 88 ROPs. NVIDIA combined 
eleven 32-bit memory controllers for 
a 352-bit wide memory bus, which 
is paired with 11GB of GDDR5X 
clocked at 11,010MHz (effective). 
The Founder’s Edition 1080 Ti has

logos on the top edge of the card and a quartet of RGB LED 
bars on the face of the card.
The cooler isn’t the only custom component in this 
package. The PCB features a 12+2 phase VRM, as well as 
high-quality TITAN X-grade chokes and capacitors, and 
an aerospace-grade coating prevents dust buildup, resists 
component corrosion, and acts as a moisture barrier. 
There is a plethora of outputs on this card, including three 
full-sized DisplayPort 1.4 and one dual-link DVI-D outputs. 
When it comes to HDMI, the AORUS VR Link feature lets 
you utilize two of the rear-facing HDMI ports, or utilize the 
card’s internal HDMI port for connecting to a VR headset to 
a front panel-based output. 
We’ve already declared the GTX 1080 Ti the definitive 4K 
gamer’s graphics card, making the tangibly faster AORUS 
GTX 1080 Ti 11G . . . even more definitive. Definitely. ■

ARCTIC Freezer 12
high-end Intel and AMD processors. Ryzen 
7 CPUs, for example, have a 95-watt TDP, 
while the Intel Core i7-7700K features a 91-
watt TDP. ARCTIC must be fairly confident 
in the cooler’s reliability, as the company 
supports it with a six-year warranty. 
On the Freezer 12, ARCTIC also 
improves fan efficiency at the boundary level, 
resulting in better performance at lower fan 
speeds. Plastic clips built into the included 
92mm fan make it a breeze to snap the fan 
on and off. With an Intel processor, the 
mounting system allows you to orient the 
Freezer 12’s heatsink in any direction. As 
such, the 92mm fan can direct airflow to the 
top or rear of the case, as well as serve as an 
intake or exhaust. Those on AMD’s AM4 
platform can only orient the fan to the rear 
of the case, because the Freezer 12 is only 
designed to use the metal backplate for the 
new AMD socket. 
The Freezer 12’s heatsink features three 
6mm heatpipes that make direct contact 
with the CPU—a common design among 
O
ver the years, air coolers have gained 
a reputation as being louder than 
their liquid-cooling counterparts. There 
are, of course, many excellent low-noise 
air coolers on the market, but most of the 
quiet heatsink/fan combos feature tall (and 
sometimes wide) heatsinks and multiple 
noise-optimized fans. Near-silent acoustics 
with a small air cooler is a challenge, which 
makes the ARCTIC Freezer 12 all the more 
impressive. This compact CPU cooler 
boasts a semi-passive design with a 92mm 
fan that only starts to spin when the PWM 
signal is above 40%. And even under full 
load, ARCTIC only rates the 92mm fan for 
0.3 Sone (roughly 22dBA).
The Freezer 12 is a follow-up to 
ARCTIC’s Freezer i11 family, which also 
offers low-noise design but not a passive 
cooling mode. Notably, ARCTIC also 
adds support for AMD’s AM4 socket—the 
Freezer i11 only supports recent Intel sockets. 
ARCTIC rates the Freezer 12 for a TDP of 
up to 150 watts, so it should support the 
modern air coolers. ARCTIC includes its 
MX-4 thermal paste for excellent thermal 
conductivity. The compact heatsink should 
fit into all but the smallest form factor 
cases with dimensions of 5.1 x 4.3 x 3.5 
inches (HxWxD). 
We installed the Freezer 12 into a system 
with Intel’s Core i7-7700K and an AORUS 
GA-Z270X-Gaming 7 motherboard. Idle 
temps, on average, were 35.8 degrees Celsius, 
which is a bit higher than normal, but an 
expected result because the 92mm fan was 
running at minimal rpms. POV-Ray 3.7 
testing pushed average temperatures to 78.5 C 
with a maximum of 85 C. With testing load, 
of course, fans were running at the maximum 
2,000rpm. Lastly, we ran Prime95’s Small FFT 
torture test for 10 minutes. This demanding 
load pushed average temperatures to 96 C, 
and the Core i7-7700K throttled to a lower 
speed after five minutes of testing.
ARCTIC’s Freezer 12 may not have been 
able to handle the heavy stress of Prime95, 
but it did sufficiently well with POV-Ray 
3.7. Near-silent—and sometimes completely 
silent—operation is the most compelling 
reason to purchase the Freezer 12, and the 
small footprint could be a big bonus for 
builders working on a small form factor rig. ■

SAPPHIRE NITRO+ 
Radeon RX 580 8GB Limited Edition
two black 95mm dual ball-bearing fans, 
but the Limited Edition ships with a set of 
frosted translucent fans with blue LEDs. 
It took us less than five minutes to swap 
them out, and the extra illumination, 
although not RGB, was a nice touch. The 
SAPPHIRE logo is RGB-controllable, 
however, and SAPPHIRE’s NITRO Glow 
feature lets you vary the color by fan speed 
or GPU temperature, cycle through colors, 
or run with the static color of your choice. 
The Limited Edition also has a dual 
BIOS switch on the top edge that lets you 
choose between the NITRO+ clock of 
1,411MHz, or the Limited Edition clock 
of 1,450MHz. This is clearly a binned 
chip, and we are pleased to report that the 
card remains fairly quiet under load, even 
when running at the higher core clock. In 
order to feed this card with enough juice to 
maintain those clocks, there are 8-pin and 
6-pin PCIe power ports on the top edge 
of the card. Display outputs on the back 
bracket include two HDMI, two DP, and 
one DVI port. 
Last year’s Radeon RX 480 was capable 
of running our games at a playable 1440p, 
but only just. The NITRO+ Radeon RX 
580 Limited Edition feels much more 
at home at this resolution. The Limited 
Edition extras are great for fanatics, but at 
$249, the vanilla NITRO+ feels like the 
ideal option for a vast majority of gamers 
in search of a 2017 upgrade.  ■

A
s part of AMD’s attempt to roll out 
the red carpet for Vega later this year, 
we’re getting a refreshed line of graphics 
cards in the 500 Series. The SAPPHIRE 
Radeon RX 580 NITRO+ Limited Edition 
is Polaris, refined, enhanced, and ever-so-
slightly tweaked. 
This is not a new architecture, these 
are the same fourth-generation GCN 
(Graphics Core Next) architecture-based 
GPUs manufactured on Global Foundries’ 
14nm FinFET process. The GPU inside 
the RX 580 measures 232mm2 and it has 
the same 36 compute units as 2016’s RX 
480. There are 2,304 stream processors, 
144 texture units, and 32 ROPs. Again, 
there are 4GB and 8GB GDDR5-enabled 
RX 580s, and they both feature a 256-bit 
memory bus. The RX 580 has its reference 
base and boost clocks set to 1,257MHz and 
1,340MHz, respectively. In short, the only 
thing “new” about these cards is the higher 
clocks. There are 500 million gamers—
by AMD’s count—who’re running a 
two-year-old or older graphics card, and 
it’s these folks who can see the biggest 
improvement from a 500 Series upgrade. 
This card’s gunmetal grey heatsink 
shroud, a color exclusive to the Limited 
Edition, looks familiar on the outside, but 
the underlying Dual-X heatsink is bigger 
and better, featuring four nickel-plated 
copper heatpipes, more robust VRM 
cooling, and a 54-fin heatsink. All told, 
the cooler lets the card run up to 12dbA 
quieter. Out of the box, the card features

Patriot Viper V570 Gaming Mouse
The four LED-lit DPI indicators are 
adjacent to the DPI switches, and there’s 
a row of seven programmable buttons 
that span the left side of the mouse, above 
the thumb. At the top of the thumb’s 
resting position is a sniper button, which 
dramatically reduces the DPI setting 
(to 400DPI) for those times when you 
need pinpoint accuracy in games. We’ve 
also found the button ideal for making 
fine adjustments to images using various 
Photoshop tools. In total, there are 13 
programmable buttons on the Viper V570. 
The LED-lit mouse wheel features a rubber 
no-slip grip down the center, and there 
are five ceramic foot pads that provide 
minimal friction on virtually any surface. 
You can snap off a top portion of the 
mouse housing to access the hidden weight 
compartment, letting you add up to 34.2 
grams. That’s enough to make this fairly 
light mouse feel like a brick in your hand, 
which is good for making sure the cursor 
stays put even after adjusting your grip. 
Under the housing, Patriot equipped 
this mouse with an Avago 9800 laser 
L
ast year, we found Patriot’s Viper V560 
Laser Gaming Mouse to be a feature-
packed mouse for a surprisingly affordable 
price. Since then, the company best known 
for its memory products released the 
more budget-minded V530 LED Gaming 
Mouse, and now, after a bit of a delay, 
it’s time for the full-featured Viper V570 
Gaming Mouse to sneak out of its hole. 
The design of this mouse vaguely 
resembles that of the V560; it has a 
rubberized pad for your thumb to rest on, 
the DPI buttons are in roughly the same 
place between the right and left mouse 
buttons, and this is clearly a right-handed 
mouse. The swappable right side panel is 
gone, however, and in its place the side of 
the mouse features a subtle bulge to keep 
your ring finger and pinky in place. The 
surface of the mouse is covered in matte 
black plastic, with a rectangular glossy 
panel on top of the device where you’ll find 
one of the RGB LEDs. There are six other 
RGB LEDs on the mouse, and you can use 
the Viper software to synchronize them or 
create your own LED color scheme. 
sensor, letting you adjust the DPI to up to 
12,000. The rest of the switches are zero-
delay Omron switches. One of the unique 
features we like about the Viper V570 is 
the software-enabled Auto-Speed feature, 
which lets the mouse bounce between 
two preset DPI settings, depending on 
the detected mouse movement. You can 
set Auto-Speed ranges for each of the four 
DPI profiles stored on the device. We 
also like that the mouse is customizable 
enough to be use as an MMO mouse, 
but there aren’t so many buttons on it 
that they get in the way when using it for 
other computing tasks. 
Patriot crammed a lot of premium 
features into the Viper V570 Gaming 
Mouse, but still managed to keep the price 
reasonable. We’re impressed, again.  ■

ASUS ROG Swift PG27AQ
and supports color reproduction based on 
100% of the sRGB color space. Like most 
4K monitors on the market today, this 
one is limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. 
If you’ve ever noticed LED-backlight-
induced flickering, then you know how 
disrupting it can be. ASUS has solved 
the issue with its Flicker-Free technology, 
making everything you watch on the 
PG27AQ look smooth. 
Gamers running a GeForce GTX 
980 or higher can tap into another of 
this monitor’s smoothing technologies, 
NVIDIA G-SYNC. This lets the monitor 
employ a variable refresh rate, whereby 
the graphics card dictates how often the 
screen draws an image. This eliminates 
the ever-present screen tearing that occurs 
when framerates and screen refresh rates 
fall out of sync, and it does so without 
the stuttering that the Vsync setting 
introduces. 
The ROG Swift PG27AQ features 
a 5-way joystick on the backside of the 
right-edge, which makes navigating the 
OSD simple and fast. There’s a button 
dedicated to the ASUS GamePlus extras, 
which let you superimpose one of four 
different crosshairs, display an FPS 
counter, or enable an onscreen timer. This 
monitor also supports a half-dozen preset 
M
ost PC users tend to upgrade 
their graphics card, processor, 
motherboard, and memory at a faster 
clip than they do their monitors. But 
as a result, many are using a display 
that’s rather long in the tooth. If you’re 
considering a new monitor, the ASUS 
ROG Swift PG27AQ should be on your 
short list, as it is loaded with eye-popping 
reasons to upgrade.  
The centerpiece of this bold and 
beautiful monitor is the 27-inch UHD 
(3,840 x 2,160) resolution IPS (in-plane 
switching) panel. For those upgrading 
from a 1,080p display, the PG27AQ 
delivers 300% more desktop real estate 
but retains the 16:9 widescreen aspect 
ratio. The 8.3-megapixel panel features 
a 0.155mm pixel pitch, which means 
that there are 163 pixels per square inch. 
With such a high pixel density, you can 
be assured that no matter what you’re 
viewing, it’ll appear crisp, vivid, and true-
to-life. This IPS panel is ideally suited 
to gaming with its 4ms gray to gray 
response time, 1,000:1 contrast ratio, 
300cd/m² brightness, and 178 degree 
vertical and horizontal viewing angles. 
When it comes to colors, this monitor 
also shines, it features a 10-bit panel 
capable of displaying 1.07 billion colors 
display modes, including Scenery, Racing, 
Cinema, RTS/RPG, FPS, and sRGB. 
Blue light filters come standard 
on many modern monitors and the 
PG27AQ is no different; there are 5 low 
blue light levels you can choose from. 
The LED-lit stand also lets you adjust 
the screen for your comfort, with support 
for height (120mm total), tilt (-5 degrees 
and + 20 degrees), swivel (-60 degrees, 
+60 degrees), and rotate (90 degrees, for 
portrait or landscape viewing modes) 
adjustments. If the highly adjustable 
stand doesn’t do it for you, the monitor 
also supports a VESA-compatible mounts. 
On top of everything else, this monitor 
also comes with a pair of 2-watt stereo 
speakers, a pair of USB 3.0 ports, a USB 
3.0 upstream port (the requisite cable), 
and even a 3.5mm headphone jack. 
It’s true you’ll need some serious 
graphics horsepower to fully appreciate 
this monitor, and deep pockets to boot, 
but if you’ve got it (courtesy of NVIDIA) 
and them, then consider the ASUS ROG 
Swift PG27AQ, as it is one of the best-
looking UHD monitors you can buy.   ■

ENERMAX ETS-N31
and a static pressure of 0.86mmH20. 
Ramping the fan up to 2,000rpm 
brings airflow up to 32.8cfm and static 
pressure to 2.15mmH20. Maximum 
noise level from the cooler, according 
to ENERMAX, is 24.5dB(A). The fan 
features a clip-on design that’s simple to 
snap on and off the heatsink. 
The ETS-N31 is one of the easiest to 
install air coolers we’ve tested. Where 
others include several mounting brackets 
and a universal backplate with multiple 
sets of holes, ENERMAX goes with a 
setup that’s more like a stock cooler. The 
pre-installed AMD mounting bracket, 
for example, is a metal rocking clip that 
hooks onto the motherboard’s plastic 
retention bracket. Securing the ETS-N31 
to an Intel socket also utilizes the pre-
installed AMD clip, but you must first 
attach the included plastic Intel mounting 
bracket to your motherboard. For a tool-
less design, the Intel mounting bracket is 
secured by plastic push-pins.
Less-advanced builders, or people who’ve 
never installed a CPU cooler, should 
appreciate the simple installation process. 
That being said, some power users might 
prefer a more solid mounting mechanism—
one that doesn’t rely on plastic retention 
L
ooking for a new CPU cooler to pair 
with a Ryzen processor? ENERMAX 
recently released the ETS-N31, an 
affordable ($19.99) air cooler with a pre-
installed AMD mounting bracket. The 
ETS-N31 is also designed to maximize 
system compatibility, thanks to a 
compact, slim design that should fit into 
most any chassis and not interfere with 
a motherboard’s DIMM slots. The ETS-
N31 is compatible with modern Intel 
processors, as well, and features a tool-free 
mounting system.
If you’ve owned or seen an ENERMAX 
air cooler in the past, you’re likely familiar 
with the host of cooling enhancements 
the company adds. The ETS-N31, 
despite its compact design, comes with 
ENERMAX’s big three: HDT (Heat-pipe 
Direct Touch), VEF (Vacuum Effect), and 
VGF (Vortex Generator Flow). VEF and 
VGF are two technologies that help to 
increase air convection and airflow around 
the heatsink’s three 6mm heatpipes. When 
combined with the included 92mm fan, 
ENERMAX rates the ETS-N31 with a 
130W TDP cooling capacity.
The 92mm fan supports a PWM range 
from 800 to 2,000rpm. At the lowest 
speed, ENERMAX rates it for 13.12cfm 
brackets—to help ensure even pressure. 
Still, many coolers in the ETS N31’s $19.99 
price range also rely on plastic backplates, 
mounts, and/or retention brackets. 
To test out the ENERMAX ETS-
N31, we installed it onto an AORUS 
GA-Z270X-Gaming 7 with Intel’s Core 
i7-7700K. Idle temps, on average, were 
32.3 degrees Celsius—a fine starting 
point for an air cooler. Temperatures 
were less impressive under load. Average 
temperatures after running POV-Ray 3.7 
for 10 minutes brought the Intel Core 
i7-7700K up to 87.5 C with a maximum 
temperature of 90 C. Prime95 is an even 
more demanding test, and here, the Intel 
Core i7-7700K occasionally throttled 
down with temperatures reaching 99 C, 
and average temperatures were 96.6 C. 
We don’t expect a compact, affordable 
CPU cooler to keep up with power user 
duties, so the high temperatures under load 
weren’t too surprising. Still, ENERMAX 
offers other compact coolers, such as the 
ETS-T50 AXE, that are quite capable. Ease 
of installation and superb compatibility are 
the ETS-N31’s best calling cards, making it 
an option for beginners. ■

of the GPU’s heatspreader, and both the 
heatpipes and copper plate sport a nickel-
plated finish. There’s no backplate or PCB 
face plate like on MSI’s higher-powered 
cards, but the same red and black heatsink 
shroud with red LED highlights is here 
and an RGB MSI dragon logo adds some 
extra visual appeal. The aforementioned 
Gaming App lets you tweak the LED 
behavior, and for those who want to push 
the clocks higher, MSI’s Afterburner 
software is one of the best Windows-based 
overclocking utilities we’ve used. 
The large 95mm TORX 2.0 fans on 
this card feature two types of blades, 
with matte-textured traditional blades 
connected low on the hub alternating 
with bulging blades with a glossy stripe 
mounted higher on the hub. These 
“dispersion blades” accelerate airflow 
without increasing noise output, for 
22% more air pressure than fans with 
traditional blades. MSI’s ZeroFrozr 
technology keeps the fans motionless 
until the GPU is under load. 
Power comes to the card via a single 
8-pin PCIe power port and display 
outputs on the back bracket include two 
HDMI, two DP, and one DVI port. 
If you’re looking to max out the 
settings on all of your games at 1080p, 
the MSI Radeon RX 570 GAMING X 
4G will more than get you there. The 
4GB frame buffer is too small for reliable 
1440p gaming, though less demanding 
games will look great at this resolution.  ■

e just got a hold of the MSI Radeon 
RX 570 GAMING X 4G, a sub $200 
card that performs a lot like the stock-
clocked RX 480 from last year. Under the 
hood, you’ll find the same 14nm FinFET 
Gen 4 GCN (Graphics Core Next) 
architecture-based GPU, now named 
Polaris 20, which measures 232mm2. 
Astute readers will notice that this die size 
is the same as on the RX 580, and that’s 
because it’s essentially the same GPU, 
only with four fewer CUs enabled (there 
are 32 total). As a result, there are 2,048 
stream processors, 128 texture units, and 
32 ROPs. This card features 4GB of 7Gbps 
GDDR5 installed on the PCB, however, 
we’re told that there will be some RX 570s 
with 8GB of memory. The memory bus is 
256-bits wide and the card is capable of 
up to 224GBps of memory bandwidth. 
AMD’s RX 570 reference design calls for 
base and boost clocks of 1,168MHz and 
1,244MHz, respectively. MSI’s substantial 
cooler and custom seven-phase VRM-
based PCB give the GPU a lot more space 
to run wild, however, so the OC Mode 
clock (enabled via the MSI Gaming App) 
can boost the core to up to 1,293MHz and 
the memory clock to up to 7,100MHz. 
All of MSI’s GAMING X series graphics 
cards look roughly the same. But the RX 
570 is a 150-watt card, so it doesn’t make 
sense to install the same heatsink that MSI 
uses for the GeForce GTX 1080 or even 
the RX 580. On this slightly slimmed 
down version of the Twin Frozr VI you’ll 
find one 8mm and one 6mm heatpipe 
that converge over a copper plate on top

AVADirect does a good job of 
using all of the Core P5’s considerable 
space. For example, the long 480mm 
radiator fills up the right side of the 
case, while the AORUS GA-Z270X-
Gaming 7 and GTX 1080 Founders 
Edition cards anchor the left side. The 
hardline tubing loop runs throughout 
the system and brings everything 
together visually. AVADirect made a 
few interesting bends with the PETG 
hardline tubing, opting to loop many 
of the bends rather than making 
conventional 90-degree turns. We 
particularly like the loops in the short 
runs; they are more attractive than a

The AORUS GA-Z270X-Gaming 7 
illuminates much of the left side with

Way More Powerful 
Than Project Scorpio
A build that looks this nice deserves 
high-end hardware to match. To reach 
5GHz on the Intel Core i7-7700K, 
AVADirect made small changes to the 
BCLK and CPU voltage, so you know 
the builder didn’t just pump up the 
multiplier. The dual NVIDIA GeForce 
GTX 1080 Founders Edition cards also 
boast a swift 1,898MHz Boost Clock, 
a big jump from the stock 1,733MHz 
Boost Clock speed. To maintain optimal 
SLI speed, AVADirect also installs 
GIGABYTE’s high-bandwidth SLI 
bridge. The Z270 Scorpio’s cooling 
system had no problem with the extra 
CPU and GPU power.
AVADirect fills out the system with a 
32GB of G.Skill Trident Z DDR4-3466 
(two 16GB modules), a 500GB Samsung 
960 EVO, and a Corsair AX1200i power 
supply. On the latter, the builder adds 
the same piano-black paint job as the 
Thermaltake Core P5 case, as well as 
black individually sleeved cables. Cable 
combs are liberally applied to the cables 
to keep the wiring neat. AVADirect 
also optimized the 500GB Samsung 
960 EVO’s performance with some 
tweaks to the BIOS and bus speeds. 
The AORUS GA-Z270X-Gaming 
7 is a solid base for this configuration 
of high-end hardware, and it offers 
some flexibility for upgrades down 
the road. For example, you could 
build upon the single Samsung 
960 EVO with two more PCIe,

3DMark’s Fire Strike Extreme 
is an excellent example of the 
system’s optimization with 
the incredible Graphics score 
of 20701 pushing the Overall 
score to 17238. We performed our game 
tests on the Z270 Scorpio at both 2,560 
x 1,400 and 3,840 x 2,160 resolutions. 
At the former, frame rates were well above 
100fps, highlighted by 168fps in Dying 
Light. Bumping up to 4K resolution 
wasn’t much more of a test for the rig, as 
Dying Light still ran at 100fps.
There was no letdown in any of our 
benchmark tests. Random 4K reads and 
writes in CrystalDiskMark, for example, 
were above 800MBps. Sequential 
read/writes reached 3,167MBps and 
1,710MBps, respectively. The CPU-
intensive Cinebench 15 (1087 points) and 
POV-Ray 3.7 (2,364.6 pixels per second) 
scores are much higher than the scores 
we see with a stock-clocked Intel Core 
i7-7700K. The Scorpio’s system memory 
is fast, too, with 39GBps in SiSoftware 
Sandra’s Memory Bandwidth test.
Your Enthusiast Horoscope 
The AVADirect rigs we’ve seen are 
routinely big, bold, and beautiful, 
and the Z270 Scorpio delivers much 
of the same, in terms of attention to 
detail and creativity. There’s beast in 
this beauty, as well, with exceptional 
overclocks and performance opti-
mizations that power users should 
appreciate. And although we know 
that not everyone can afford an $8,000 
build, AVADirect’s overclocking service

A Stealthy Scorpio
Fan noise is a common issue people 
have with open-frame chassis, but the 
Z270 Scorpio build is surprisingly 
quiet—it stays nearly silent under 
most loads. The EKWB pump was only 
audible during boot, and fan noise from 
the Thermaltake Riing 12 LED Orange 
fans was non-existent, except when we 
ran games at 4K resolution. Even then, 
system noise under 100% load was 
comparable to the idle noise level of air-
cooled hardware in a conventional case. 
Orange Crush
The Z270 Scorpio’s aggressive 
overclocks and the BIOS tweaks—which 
would be available to any customer 
who selects AVADirect’s overclocking 
service—ensure the system would put 
the hurt on our benchmark tests.

SkyVue
“I was intrigued by Corsair’s new low-profile watercooler, the H5 
SF,” Stephenson says. “So I decided to do something that would 
highlight it in a build. At the same time, I had a SilverStone LC-02 
HTPC case that was all-aluminum but, more importantly, it had 
the risers and extensions necessary to mount a video card in a ‘laid 
down’ position. The idea for the art deco skyscraper cover came 
only after the assembled internal component structure looked like a 
tall, stepped building. I had a 3-year-old art deco lamp design that 
meshed nearly perfectly with the physical requirements of the cover.”
In addition to the H5 SF, SkyVue contains an Intel Core i5-6600K 
processor, a GIGABYTE GA-Z170N Mini-ITX motherboard, a 
16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 kit, a GIGABYTE GeForce 
GTX 1070 Mini ITX graphics card, a Corsair SF600 SFX power 
supply, a Kingston HyperX Predator 240GB M.2 SSD, and a Corsair 
Neutron XT 480GB SSD.
A Clean Slate
SkyVue isn’t a brand-new mod; Stephenson submitted it as a 
Mad Reader Mod entry nearly a year ago, but sometimes it takes us 
a while to find a spot for some of the great projects that show up in 
our inbox. In the meantime, Stephenson completed another mod, 
which he calls Clean Slate.
“I finished it in December 2016,” he says. “Recently I’ve made a 
few cosmetic changes and am currently reshooting the photography 
for the Cooler Master Case Mod World Series 2017.”
You heard the man; keep an eye out for it! ■
T
his month’s Mad Reader Mod comes to us by way of Jeffrey 
Stephenson, the beginning of whose PC-building career 
more or less epitomizes the old saying “necessity is the 
mother of invention.”
“I started ‘modding’ back in 2002 after VIA released the very first 
Mini-ITX motherboard, and there were few available cases for it,” 
Stephenson says. “I discovered that a desktop cigar humidor was the 
perfect size and proceeded to mount a computer inside of one. VIA 
invited me to display my creation at CES 2003, and things kinda 
took off from there.”
Stephenson, a retired 62-year-old living in rural Florida, says 
he does all of his modding either on the dining room table or 
on a folding card table set up on his deck. He says he put in a 
considerable amount of time on SkyVue: “Around 200 hours over a 
nine-week period.”
His inspiration for the build is fairly obvious; SkyVue is an art deco 
skyscraper. “I find retro designs that I like and try to translate that style 
into a PC enclosure,” Stephenson explains. “The cover is veneered in 
Sapele, an African variety of Mahogany. SkyVue has an aluminum 
frame that has aircraft-grade birch plywood fused to it. The three 
decorative stripes are polished aluminum bar stock.”
A Solid Foundation
Stephenson, who was an engineer in the U.S. Navy, has more 
than a passing familiarity with equipment cooling. Not surprisingly, 
it was a cooling system that led to the creation of SkyVue.

PAX East 2017
The Best & Brightest Of Boston’s 
Big Gaming Show
Outside the halls of PAX East, Boston was a cold and snowy affair, complete with icicles adorning the Boston Conven-
tion & Exhibition Center. Freezing temperatures and icy conditions might have made travel difficult, but attendees were 
rewarded with access to plenty of new games, high-end PC hardware, and awesome geekery. At the center of the show 
floor, Intel showcased the seven finalists competing in the 2017 Extreme Rig Challenge. Designed and constructed by 
boutique system builders, all of these rigs feature a 7th Generation Intel Core processor and Intel SSD 600p Series 
SSD. Other than these requirements, the system builders were free to select the rest of system components.
NCIX PC won last year’s competition, and the builder is back with a 
lot of colorful customizations.
Origin PC’s system includes two PCs, both capable of powering a VR 
system, and an LCD display/window on each side.

LANFest Springs Into Action
LANFest NETWAR 32.0 
& Gamers For Giving 2017
Ever have one of those weekends when there’s just way to much stuff going on to do all the things you want to do? 
The first weekend of April was kinda like that, with top-shelf LAN parties taking place in Omaha, Nebraska (LANFest 
NETWAR 32.0) and at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Michigan (Gamers For Giving 2017). CPU was lucky 
enough to be in attendance at both events, so we thought we’d share a little of the fun we had with you.
NETWAR 32.0 was a landmark event for the 
Omaha LANFest chapter, as it was the first 
NETWAR event ever to surpass the 500 attendee 
mark! The NETWAR staff were well prepared, 
though, and the venue was more than up to the 
task of containing so much gaming energy for 
the event’s 27-hour duration. In addition to the 
courts where the LAN party was held, The Mark 
contains bowling lanes, a laser tag facility, an 
arcade, and more.
NETWAR 32.0
NETWAR kicked off at 7:00 p.m. on Friday, March 31 at The Mark, an amusement center in Omaha, Nebraska, and ran straight through until 10:00 p.m. the 
following night (April 1). In just 27 hours, the LAN party hosted tournaments in League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Rocket League, and 
Overwatch, and offered free-play periods for Unreal Tournament, CS:GO, and Heroes of the Storm. Travis and company also held their usual massive door prize 
raffle on Saturday afternoon, we judged a mod contest, and there were several vendors at the LAN showing off their products and services, as well.
The intrepid NETWAR staff prepares the venue for the madness 
to come . . . .

The winning mod in our contest was by Joshua Judy, who modified one of Thermaltake’s Core small form factor cube cases so that it can accommodate 
standard ATX motherboards. To do this, he had to build his own custom motherboard tray and literally turn the case upside down, which in turn forced him to 
rotate the front panel logo and relocate the case feet. Speaking of the feet, he built his own custom feet that include backlit acrylic inserts, an extension of 
the translucent acrylic accent he added between the front panel and the case body. Add to that his hardline cooling system and hand-sleeved cables, and you 
have a great-looking case that is thoroughly re-engineered to do what Judy wants it to.
Dave Cathey was also at NETWAR, and his Twelve-80 scratch build 
(right) was a close runner-up. He built the main structure of the 
case (including both sides) out of a single sheet of aluminum, added 
another piece for the case’s bottom and back panels, did a ton of 
custom work on his components, and added the cool vinyl logos you 
see here and there. Cathey’s projects are always great, and this one 
was no exception!

Gamers For Giving 2017
We’ve covered Gamers for Giving events in the past, but here’s a quick refresher: Gamers for Giving is a LAN event hosted by the Gamers Outreach 
Foundation, a charitable organization that raises funds to put videogame carts in hospitals for kids. This year’s event, held at Eastern Michigan University’s 
Convocation Center, a several-thousand-seat sports arena and event center, raised $315,069 for the GO Kart program. The event hosted more than 1,200 
attendees on-site, and its live-stream broadcast was viewed by more than 240,000 unique visitors, who could also donate via the web.
Zach Wigal, founder of the Gamers Outreach Foundation.
There was, of course, a lot of gaming throughout 
the two-day event, which started at 9:00 a.m. 
on Saturday, April 1 and ran through 11:00 p.m. 
on Sunday, April 2; tournaments included Halo 5, 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered, Super 
Smash Bros. Melee, Clash Royale, Call of Duty: 
Infinite Warfare, Overwatch, League of Legends, 
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Hearthstone, 
Rocket League, and StarCraft 2. There were lots of 
cool AFK contests and activities, as well, including 
a CPU Case Mod Contest.

The winner of our mod contest was Joel Dekker, whose custom oak scratch build is one of the nicest wooden cases we’ve 
seen in a long time. The woodworking alone is impressive, but as you can see through this rig’s enormous side panel window, 
the system inside is pretty well-made, too. Dekker’s custom cooling loop and sleeved cables give the inside a clean, powerful 
look that nicely complements its exterior.
You’ve probably seen this before in our coverage of Gamers for Giving 
events, but in case you wondered: Mad Reader Mod alumnus James 
Fislar built this stunning Gamers for Giving PC with help from NVIDIA, 
Intel, HyperX, EVGA, and EKWB.

YouLAN 
How To Host Your Own LAN Party
Here’s a definite: You haven’t done 
anything yet. Buying a seat at a LAN party 
and winning a pepperoni-pizza-eating 
contest is one thing. Negotiating with a 
venue to host your event, enticing enough 
people to attend, setting up a network, and 
actually running the show—it all adds up 
to countless unpaid hours for a brand-new 
LAN party that could have rows of empty 
seats. You don’t want that to happen. We 
don’t want that to happen.
After hosting CPULAN last year, we 
learned firsthand how much work goes 
into organizing and hosting a LAN party. 
We have plenty of advice to pass on to 
happens online, and it’s been that way for 
nearly two decades. Of course, the presence 
of the almighty internet makes gaming with 
friends and strangers alike a trivial matter, but 
it misses out on all the other fun that only 
happens when gamers get together IRL. In 
our humble opinion, there’s no better place 
to gather and game than a LAN party.
Maybe you love attending LAN parties 
as much as we do. Maybe, between 
Overwatch matches and swigs of energy 
drinks, you think, “I could do this. I 
should do this.” Maybe you feel like the 
best LAN party ever is going to be the 
one that you organize. Maybe you’re right.
S
ince the existence of “2P,” videogames 
have had a social element. Yes, there are 
plenty of great titles for when you want to 
be a hermetic gamer and go it alone, but 
so many epic and unforgettable moments 
happen in multiplayer. GoldenEye was 
golden when you and three friends fought 
against each other to be the last man 
standing. World of Warcraft wows the most 
when you down a new raid boss with your 
guild or reach the top of the Arena ladder 
with your team. CS:GO only goes when 
your 5 goes head-to-head with another 5.
The overwhelming majority of multi-
player gameplay, whether that’s PvP or co-op, 
One day, your LAN party may host hundreds of gamers who hail from every corner of the country. That day is not today. For your first LAN party, 
keep your expectations in check if you want to make it to your second LAN party. Creating a small, memorable event is a much better recipe for 
success than trying to hold a massive LAN party and having it bomb.
46 May2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

event catered for a small number of people 
that will spread the word.”
Once you determine how many gamers 
you’ll be inviting to your soirée, you have 
to find a place to put them all. You don’t 
need a tutorial to explain where to host 
that 10-man LAN Engstrom suggests: 
Your home will work perfectly for a very 
small party. When attendees are fighting 
for elbow room in your one-car garage, 
though, you’d better find a bigger space.
Small, first-time LAN parties should 
have plenty of available options, which 
will let you find a venue within your 
budget. College students have university 
facilities at their disposal, and grown-ups 
with an exceptionally cool boss (or an 
irreplaceable position at their company) 
might be able to get away with using their 
place of employment for their LAN party. 
Unsurprisingly, several LANFest events 
occur on Intel’s campuses, for example. 
If you deal with venues that will rent 
you “Conference Room B,” you’ll have 
the benefit of discussing your event with 
someone who knows exactly whether her 
venue can accommodate your LAN party. 
Our admins differed slightly on an exact 
attendance goal for your first LAN party, 
but none of them recommended exceeding 
25 attendees. Engstrom says first-time 
organizers should set a target even lower.
“I always recommend that people con-
centrate on starting in the five- to 10-person 
range,” he says. “Start with a group of 
friends that can provide you feedback, that 
won’t be angry that things are not working 
right away. The first few LANs are always 
a learning process, as you will eventually be 
adding more switches, DHCP servers, and 
game servers in the future.”
Baker and Bratcher agree that even rookie 
LAN party organizers should be able to pull 
off a 25-person gathering. This size will keep 
logistics such as power, internet, and staffing 
all manageable and any unforeseen issues 
relatively easy to contain. By limiting your 
attendance, you can focus on delivering a 
LAN party people will want to return 
to . . . with their friends. “It’s better to focus 
on quality vs. quantity throughout all stages 
of organizing a LAN party,” says Harold 
Bratcher. “A limited number of attendees 
gives your LAN a chance to be a quality 
aspiring admins, but don’t take our word 
for it; we called on a few friends to offer 
their insights, as well.
Our Panel Of Experts
A good LAN party doesn’t happen with-
out a great organizer or two. Our admins 
have learned from experience what works 
and what doesn’t, and they want to pass 
that experience on to you.
Husband and wife team Harold and 
Ruxandra Bratcher are proof that you don’t 
have to know everything about launching 
a LAN party as long as you team up 
with others who know the rest. The duo 
coordinates SAN LAN (www.sanlan.org), 
a huge event in San Antonio, Tex.; Harold 
deals with the technical aspects of SAN 
LAN, while Ruxandra handles press and 
marketing. According to Harold, “Our goal 
is to institute the largest and most exciting 
tournaments in the South Texas area.”
Nick Engstrom says that KCGameOn 
(kcgameon.com) started like a lot of 
successful LANs start. Originally, the LAN 
party began as a team-building event for a 
dozen co-workers. KCGameOn kept growing, 
and now it hosts over 500 attendees and 25 
tournaments every two months. Engstrom has 
his eye on December, when he says he aims to 
host a multi-day event for 1,000 attendees.
Shane Baker helms eDrenaline eSports 
(www.edrenaline.net), which is bringing a 
big tournament to the Cleveland area this 
August. He’s preparing to host 16 amateur 
teams to do battle in Overwatch and 
Heroes of the Storm, respectively.
 Finally the University of Wisconsin-
Stout’s PONG (People’s Organization of 
Network Gaming; pong.uwstout.edu) makes 
LAN party organization a true team effort. 
Connor Glade, Pierce Lannue, Dan Murray, 
and Kayla Frohmader each weighed in on 
questions related to their area of expertise.
Party Planning
Tempting as it might be to attempt 
the next QuakeCon or DreamHack, your 
LAN party will be much more successful 
if you start with more modest ambitions. 
It’s better to keep your first event small 
and grow it organically than commit to the 
world’s first 490-empty-seat LAN party.
Everyone loves freebies, especially free hardware, and that can be a tricky issue for fledgling LAN 
parties. If you approach sponsors honestly, keep your request reasonable, and follow through on 
promoting them at your event, you’ll build a relationship that could eventually lead to the good stuff.
CPU  /  May2017 47

and the highest cost, don’t be afraid to 
do some analog advertising, particularly 
if you live in area with a high density of 
potential attendees (hint: like a major 
university). “I do not think social media 
is a waste of time in any sense, but there 
are many other resources that can be used 
with it,” Frohmader says. “For example, 
our LAN information is displayed at 
least a week ahead of time on posters 
across our campus and at local shops 
surrounding campus.”
The allure of prizes and swag is a 
big draw, of course, but stockpiling an 
appreciable amount of phat lewt isn’t 
something you should finance out of your 
pocket. Ideally, you want sponsors to 
shower you with giveaway goodies. First-
time LAN party organizers may struggle to 
prove their event’s worth to manufacturers 
that have limited supplies they can dole 
out to all the other LAN parties clamoring 
for the same hardware, but that shouldn’t 
deter you from establishing partnerships 
now that could turn into serious hardware 
as your event grows over time.
“Pay attention to social media and see 
which companies seem to embrace the 
LAN party scene,” Baker recommends, 
“then just think of yourself as a salesman 
do your best to ‘sell’ your LAN party 
to them. What do you have to offer in 
return for their sponsorship?”
Murray says that communication 
with sponsors after your event is just as 
important after your event as it is before. 
“Make sure you keep the sponsors updated 
and let them know that their donations/
help wasn’t wasted. Send pictures of the 
event and the sponsor’s product, tell them 
what forms of exposure you brought to 
their company, and just let them know 
their product went to a good cause.”
Although most organizers approach 
hardware companies with sponsorship 
requests because of the tangible rewards 
they can deliver, remember that other 
sponsors can also provide benefits to your 
event. Local restaurants could cut you 
and your attendees a deal on food, and 
energy drink brewers typically send their 
beverages for quenching thirst and fueling 
all-night gameathons. (A word of advice: 
use simple math to figure out how many 
computers can be used on a single circuit.”
Engstrom also recommends thoroughly 
investigating and understanding what a 
venue intends to charge you for using its 
space. “There are several hidden costs that 
you need to watch for: table/chair rental, 
power cords, truck rental to haul the gear, 
clean-up fees, tear-down fees, up-front 
deposits, and venue insurance are just 
some of the things we have run into.”
Party Promotion
Usually, finding a venue to hold your LAN 
party is the easy part, as plenty of places will 
gladly take your money to use their facilities. 
Convincing strangers to pay you money 
to attend your LAN party—that’s another 
matter entirely. Let’s start by disabusing you of 
any fanciful notions that “professional LAN 
party planner” will become your new full-
time job title. Sure, you might put in full-time 
hours leading up to your event, but you won’t 
make a dime doing it. If you have to buy 
networking equipment or other hardware, 
look at your LAN party as a long-term 
investment (which makes having a successful 
first event doubly important.)
“If you’re considering organizing LAN 
parties for profit, forget it,” Ruxandra 
Bratcher says. “You have to be able to invest 
quite a bit in your passion. SAN LAN’s 
comeback event in August 2016 had a cost of 
approximately $7,500. This cost went down 
about 20% to 25% for the next events, as we 
didn’t have to buy anymore equipment.”
Using social media to reach your target 
market shouldn’t come as a big surprise, 
as all of the organizers we talked to utilize 
Facebook for their LAN parties. With a 
little social networking savvy, though, you 
can find potential attendees outside your 
circle of friends.
“Start by using a Twitter crawler to 
find all profiles that say ‘games’ or 
‘gaming’ in a 50 mile radius from your 
venue location,” Engstrom recommends. 
“Follow all of these people and make sure 
you drop some information about your 
LAN in your tweet history.”
Although traditional methods of 
advertising such as television and radio 
tend to have both the most limited reach 
A little creativity could score you a nice 
deal, though. We’ve heard of small LAN 
parties convening at a Denny’s restaurant.
Rather than fixate on the physical space 
for your event, our organizers stress finding 
a place capable of meeting the unique 
needs of a LAN party, namely power, 
internet, and HVAC.
“Heating and cooling of the LAN area is 
something that may not be obvious at first, 
but it can really affect how much people 
enjoy the event,” Glade explains. “With so 
many consoles, PCs, and people generating 
heat, it won’t take long for the event space to 
get too hot if it’s not being handled properly.”
Engstrom agrees. “Air conditioning is 
really easy to overlook. One of the easiest 
way to drive away players is to make them 
uncomfortable for hours at a time.”
Baker says that a venue’s internet speed 
has become even more important as games 
increasingly connect to third-party servers 
rather than support LAN play. “Most LAN 
parties today actually rely on the internet, 
because so many popular games don’t have 
the ability to run a local server.” We also 
recommend understanding ahead of time 
what a venue charges its customers for 
bandwidth consumption. The last thing 
you want is to be stuck with an outrageous 
bill because half of your attendees were 
streaming Netflix in 4K rather than gaming.
Finally, do your homework on a venue’s 
electrical infrastructure, because we’d wager 
there aren’t many gatherings that are more 
power-hungry than a LAN party with 
dozens of gaming PCs and networking 
equipment. Our admins agree that a good 
rule of thumb to follow is to budget four or 
five PCs for every 20-amp circuit. Engstrom 
and Glade both say that developing a circuit 
map helps prevent power-related headaches 
on the day of your LAN party.
“Talk to the building manager about 
electricity,” Glade says. “Plan how many 
power strips and extension cords to get 
and what length. PONG has a number of 
power diagrams that show exactly where 
to plug in extension cords, and where on 
the tables the power strips go.”
“We use a circuit finder to map and 
label all of the circuits we use for each 
LAN,” Engstrom adds. “This allows us to

basics. That said, there’s nothing basic 
about your first LAN party, even if you’re 
not planning a blockbuster.
Although we recommend giving your 
event some structure, usually in the 
form of tournaments, you should avoid 
overwhelming your attendees with a 
schedule that feels more like weekend 
National Guard drills. Set up a poll on 
your LAN party’s website (yes, you’re 
going to need one) so you’ll know what 
games your attendees actually want to 
play, and space out tournaments with the 
expectation every single one of them will 
last longer than intended.
Your LAN party might be your idea, 
but it shouldn’t be a solo project; it’s time 
to call in those favors you’ve banked with 
your buddies over the years. Line up a few 
friends to serve as event staff, and be sure 
to get enough recruits to ensure that no 
one works a 48-hour shift.
Finally, as much work as hosting your 
own LAN party is, don’t lose sight of the 
fun. Keep your event focused on giving 
your attendees every opportunity to have a 
great time, and they’ll be back for more. ■
firewall to connect to Steam or Battle.net. 
For servers we have two 1U rackmount 
16 Intel Xeons with 256GB of RAM and 
8TB of storage. Those boxes run several 
TeamSpeak, CS:GO, and Steam caching 
servers for our events.”
On the software side, pfSense is one 
of the most popular tools for LAN party 
admins, and for good reason. As free, open-
source software, it won’t add anything to 
your LAN party’s bottom line, and there is 
ample documentation available online for 
you to learn its ins and outs.
“It is the easiest, yet most versatile 
routing software to utilize,” Lannue says. 
“It fulfills all of our needs in one package: 
routing, load balancing, DHCP, firewall, 
DNS, and other logging services. Once it 
is set up, it is easy to maintain.”
Prepare For Liftoff
As soon as you know how many gamers 
you want to attend your LAN party, 
where your attendees will convene, how 
you plan to convince them to attend, and 
what you’re going to use to connect them 
together, you’ll have covered most of the 
Be sure to discuss food and drink with 
potential vendors, even those that don’t 
have on-premises food service, ahead of 
time.) Sometimes, sponsors will aid a 
LAN party with cold, hard cash.
“SAN LAN got lucky and received a 
financial sponsorship from StreamMe, 
which provided us with $2,000 [as 
prize money] for the winning teams,” 
Ruxandra Bratcher says. “We are really 
grateful to have such an important eSports 
production and streaming company 
helping our event grow.”
Networking Know-How
Obviously, setting up a LAN party’s 
network is a much different animal than 
connecting your three home PCs to a 
media server. It’s a dense topic, and one 
that could fill an article or two by itself, 
but we’ll cover some of the basics.
If your networking experience is 
limited, recruiting a knowledgeable 
friend is invaluable, but there are other 
ways to learn the ins and outs. Engstrom 
recommends tapping into the Reddit 
hive mind. “A great place for reference 
and interaction is reddit.com/r/lanparty.
These folks will typically answer your 
networking questions, as well.”
You can also gain “on-the-job” experience 
by volunteering at another LAN party. As 
long as you don’t plan to schedule your own 
LAN party on the heels of theirs and/or 
poach attendees, you’ll find that the local 
scene isn’t a zero-sum game. Most established 
admins will bestow their knowledge upon 
LAN party padawans.
A home router and a couple of switches 
might allow you to host a small LAN 
without adding a big expense to your bottom 
line, but once your event grows large enough 
to earn a “medium-sized” designation, expect 
to start acquiring more robust networking 
hardware. As an example, Harold Bratcher 
lays out SAN LAN’s setup.
“For our network we have a pfSense 
SG-2440 firewall, a Cisco Systems SG-
200-18 for our core switch, and Cisco SG-
200-8 switches for our tables. Each player 
plugs into the table switch. From there 
they are routed back to the core switch 
and then out to the internet through the 
Believe it or not, your attendees might not want to spend every second of your LAN party glued to their 
systems. By offering a diverse selection of activities, such as tabletop and/or console gaming, and fun 
contests, you’ll give partygoers other things to do and more reasons to come back for your next LAN party.

Up until the day of the event, we had 
never met in person. Despite that, we 
clicked instantly. It always seemed like 
we were on the same page. He was really 
a pleasure to work with. I hope we get 
the opportunity to work together again.

HC
: I really enjoyed the event. I 
knew several of the competitors 
Q
: How did you and Jim get paired 
up for that event? Did you know 
him before, and how did the partnership 
work out?
HC
: I honestly am not sure how 
Jim and I became a team. I’m 
not sure if he picked me, I picked him, 
we picked each other, or we ended a 
team by default.
We’ve known each other for a few 
years now. We were both brought in by 
a mutual friend to help administrate an 
Q
: Your work has appeared in our 
monthly “Mad Reader Mod” feature 
once (our October 2014 issue), and you 
participated in the 24 Hours of LeMods 
event at QuakeCon in 2016. What other 
contests and modding events have you 
been a part of?
HC
: I’ve competed in Cooler 
Master’s Case Mod World Series 
and GIGABYTE’s Mod2Win contest 
previously. I’ve also competed in some 
smaller “Mod of the Month”-type events 
and done well. The CPU Magazine 
PDXLAN mod contest has always been 
my favorite.
Q
: You won the 24 Hours of LeMods in 
2016, right? Can you tell us about that 
event, and about your DOOM mod, built 
with Jim Weist?
HC
: Yes, we did win the 24 Hours 
of LeMods at Quakecon 2016. 
The basic idea of the event is to give 
three teams of two modders each 
identical hardware and give them three 
consecutive eight-hour days to build the 
best mod they can.
Jim and I agreed that we wanted to 
do something that we hadn’t seen before 
in a contest like this, so we decided on 
doing electroplating live at the event. 
We combined that with a faux-rust-
painting technique that I really think 
brought out the atmosphere that you 
feel when playing Doom.

me long to break out my Dremel and drill 
to make the modifications to install more 
fans, and these soon turned into lighted 
fans and neon.
Q
: It’s probably not hard to get inspired 
to mod when you attend a modding-
rich event like PDXLAN in Portland. Was 
there anyone in particular whose work 
really motivated you to try your own mods?
HC
: Bill Owen of Mnpctech was 
probably the greatest influence in 
bringing me back to modding. I had stepped 
back from PC building for about three years. 
I decided to do a build again and came across 
one of Bill’s videos while doing research on 
cases. It was all over then, I jumped in with 
both feet.
Ron Lee Christianson has also been a huge 
influence. His Resident Evil mod just blew my 
mind. It drastically expanded my ideas of what 
a mod could be. Ron and I have since become 
friends. I’ve had the opportunity to work with 
him, as well. He continues to inspire me more 
than anyone else.
Q
: How many PDXLAN events have 
you attended now?
Q
: How long have you been modding 
now, and how did you get your start?
HC
: I’ve been modding for about 18 
years now. I started like quite a 
few modders did back then, with the desire 
and it was fun just to see all their work. 
Unfortunately, I became sick towards 
the end of the event and wasn’t able to 
finish my 2099 build in time.
Q
: Did you ever get a chance to finish 
2099? It looked like it was going to 
be pretty cool!
HC
: I had to put 2099 on the 
back burner shortly after 
the contest ended, as I was preparing 
to move. Once the move was over, I 
found the box containing several key 
components for the build was missing. 
I was completely heartbroken. Luckily, 
a manufacturer has stepped forward to 
assist me in replacing those parts.
Not all is bad, though. The delay has 
actually worked out well from a design 
standpoint, as I wasn’t quite happy 
with the design I had come up for the 
exterior. The limited time I had to 
build with during Gigabyte’s Mod2Win 
contest meant I needed to make the 
exterior simpler than I originally 
planned for. Now I can go back and 
make the exterior design mesh better 
with the interior.

Q
: If you could outsource one step 
in every mod project, which one 
would it be, and why?
HC
: That would definitely be the 
paint. I’m a competent painter 
in my own right, but it’s often easier to 
outsource it. Let the professionals deal 
with the sanding dust and cleaning the 
spray guns.
Q
: How long have you been offering 
custom PC services through Tek by 
Design, and what kinds of services do 
you provide?
HC
: Tek by Design will turn four 
years old this year. Over that 
time the selection of available services 
has expanded greatly. Originally, 
I offered mostly design consultation 
and system builds. Now Tek by Design 
has its own brand of stainless steel

Can We Bend It? 
Alphacool Custom Hardline Cooling Tutorial, Part II
Trail & Error
At first, we tried using the high setting 
on our 1500-watt heat gun, reasoning 
that we would be able to get decent 
bends as long as we kept the pipe six 
or more inches away from the nozzle 
of the heat gun. Although this was a 
sound strategy in theory (and one that 
may work for you), it took significantly 
longer than we were hoping for the pipe 
to get soft, and when our patience wore 
thin and we brought the pipe closer, we 
found ourselves going from rigid and 
unbendable to boiling plastic in the blink 
of an eye. 
Strategies that helped us included 
lowering the temperature (our heat gun 
has high and low settings) and bringing 
the pipe to within two to three inches 
of the heat gun’s nozzle. Rotating the 
pipe and moving it back and forth over 
the nozzle will gradually bring the pipe 
to bending temperature and help you 
determine, based on when the pipe begins 
to get floppy, how much heat is enough. 
The fundamental key to bending 
tubing is applying just the right amount 
of heat to ensure the plastic tube is 
pliable enough to be molded into a 
shape that lets it line up with the ports 
on your radiator, blocks, reservoir, 
and pump. Too much heat, and the 
plastic tubing can actually begin to 
boil, adding unsightly bubbles to the 
plastic. Overheated tubing can also 
warp and lose its shape, despite the use 
of a silicone insert, rendering the pipe 
unusable. If you attempt to bend before 
the plastic is hot enough, you can force 
the plastic to buckle, fold, or flatten. 
Heat guns come in many varieties, with 
different wattages and settings, which will 
affect how quickly you get to a bendable 
pipe. The environment in which you’re 
working and even the chemical properties 
of the PETG or acrylic pipe you’re using 
can also have a big impact on your bending 
experience, which is why there’s no magic 
formula for finding and maintaining that 
ideal bending temperature. 
L
ast month, we touched on why an 
enthusiast might want to install a custom 
hardline liquid cooling setup in her rig, 
listed the requisite liquid-cooling parts, 
enumerated the handful of items that vary 
between flexible and hardline cooling loops, 
stressed the importance of making sure 
all components share the same threading 
and fitting sizes, and even covered some of 
the advantages of using PETG over acrylic 
tubes, but stopped short of actually delving 
into the particulars of bending. If you’d like 
a refresher on any of last month’s topics, we 
encourage you to read that article first. 
In this article, we’ll talk about the tools 
available that can make cutting and bending 
a significantly less stressful endeavor, cover 
some strategies for finding your ideal 
bending technique, and help you avoid 
making the (many, many) mistakes we 
made. Let’s get bending.
Part I, Addendum
Last month, we recommended using 
olive oil to lubricate the silicone insert when 
bending PETG or acrylic tubes. After we 
went to press, our Alphacool representative 
Eddy Peters suggested dish soap as an 
alternative, and we can verify that it works 
just as well as the olive oil, but is easier to 
clean out afterward. Regardless of the type of 
lubricant you use, you’ll need to thoroughly 
wash out the tubes before installing them and 
filling the system with coolant. 
Hot Topic
Working with a heat gun requires a clear 
work space, a decent pair of gloves that will 
insulate your hands and fingers from the 
hot pipe and the heat gun’s nozzle, and a 
healthy dose of plain old caution. At full 
temp, a heat gun can melt plastic and ignite 
combustible materials. Even after it has been 
turned off, the heat gun’s nozzle will remain 
very hot for several minutes, so be careful.
There are lots of tools you can buy to help make identical bends every time, but they require practice to master. 
CPU  /  May2017 53

Those bent tubes also make great 
reference pieces for making your 
final measurements. For instance, the 
180-degree mandrel from our Monsoon 
Hardline Pro kit creates two-inch-long 
bends. Keep in mind that you want to 
measure from the center of the hole, 
either of the pipe or the fitting, to the 
center of the opposite hole to get proper 
distances. Once you know how much 
length it takes to create your various 
bends, you can factor those in when using 
a ruler to note the distances between 
the various fittings. It’s also important 
to measure from the inside base of the 
fitting, not the opening edge. 
Another strategy we learned to rely 
on was to make our bends as close 
to the middle of the 80cm tubes as 
possible, which gave us plenty of excess 
to cut off when it came time to trim the 
pipes to fit between the components’ 
fittings. As we mentioned last month, 
we used the Alphacool pitsaw for 
trimming our pipe, but a ratcheting 
PVC cutter would be a fine substitute 
because it creates clean cuts that don’t 
require a reamer or deburring tool to 
smooth out. The old adage “measure 
twice, cut once” applies . . . to an 
extent. When trimming the bent pipe 
to fit into your system, err on the side 
of having the pipe be ever so slightly 
too long, and don’t be afraid to make 
two or three cuts to the ends of the pipe 
to get it to fit. It’s much easier to deburr 
the pipe ends each time you trim off a 
fraction of an inch than it is to have to 
scrap the pipe and start again because 
you accidentally trimmed off too much. 
Bending Tools
As we mentioned last month, some 
experienced system builders prefer to 
bend by hand. Although it can take a 
substantial amount of practice to get 
good at it, making your bends by hand 
is beneficial because you can typically 
tell how much a tube will bend before it 
begins to buckle or warp. Alternatively, 
when bending with a mandrel kit 
like the Monsoon Hardline Pro or 
the Alphacool Double Bending Tool, 
to be the softest, but if there’s not enough 
softened tube on either side, the pipe will 
bend at a sharper angle and potentially 
buckle. Take the time to familiarize yourself 
with the process and your tools by making 
some practice bends at various angles. 
It’s also important to heat up a portion 
of the pipe that’s slightly larger than the 
portion that’ll need to bend. A 90-degree 
bend, for example, may require you to 
bend two to three inches of the tubing. The 
middle of that 90-degree bend will need 
Determining the ideal heat gun setting, nozzle distance, and heating time are key to consistently 
making quality bends.
There’s a lot that can and will go wrong as you begin to make your first bends.

fair bit of extra money, but it’ll also 
eliminate some serious frustration. 
Some hardline bending purists may see 
this strategy as a cop out, but the end 
result still looks stunning. 
One of the most important pieces of 
advice we can impart is to make sure 
every fitting, spacer, and adapter is 
screwed in tightly. In the case of the 
hardline fittings we used, which employ 
O-rings, it’s important to only finger-
tighten the components. Using a wrench 
or pliers can strip threads of soft metals 
like aluminum and copper, and of 
plastics like acetyl. 
Try, Try Again
Even though we struggled—and 
failed—repeatedly, anyone who wants to 
take his system to the next level should 
absolutely consider installing a custom 
hardline liquid-cooling system. As long 
as you have enough pipe, you can always 
start from scratch. Making a stunning 
loop takes time, so be patient. And most 
of all, be creative! ■
enough to hold its shape. You can also 
use a small fan to decrease the time it 
takes to get the bend to solidify. Before 
the pipe is cool, try to avoid touching or 
applying pressure to the softened portion 
of the pipe, as it can dent or mar the 
surface of the tube. 
The Big Cheat
There’s a shortcut to making 
a good-looking hardline tubing 
system, and it’s one we see even 
professional modders employ all 
the time. It involves getting a series 
of angled fittings, spacers, and 
adapters and connecting them in 
a series to eliminate the need for 
making an additional bend right at 
the waterblock, reservoir, pump, or 
radiator. We used four 90-degree 
adapters on the radiator, and it 
simplified connecting the pipes to 
the next component in our loop, even 
though our measurements were slightly 
off. It’s true, replacing tube bends with 
adapters and spacers will cost you a 
you’re less likely to see 
the inside curve of the 
tube until it has cooled, 
and by then it’s usually 
too late to finesse it 
into the shape you want 
by applying a little 
more heat. 
On the flipside, using 
one or more bending 
tools is a good way to 
create consistent bends, 
which is important when 
you’re constructing a 
symmetrical hardline 
tubing system. Even 
when using tools, 
however, we found that 
there are usually one or 
two areas that’ll require a 
little hand bending. 
We had a lot of success 
with Monsoon Hardline 
Pro Mandrel Kit. We 
used the included set of 
brackets to mount the 90- 
and 180-degree mandrels 
to a flat board, and this provided us with 
a stable platform for making most of our 
bends. We used the 360-degree mandrel 
for some hand bending that was required 
to make the double loop-the-loop at 
the base of our pump and reservoir. The 
Alphacool Acrylic Double Bending Tool 
was also handy for making bends to pipe 
that already had one or more bends in it, 
and it works just fine with PETG. 
We should also point out that you 
don’t need to restrict yourself to using 
tools created specifically for hardline 
bending; for a handful of very sharp 
bends we needed to create, we used 
the shaft of a permanent marker in 
place of a mandrel. You can use almost 
any rounded, solid object to aid in the 
bending process, as long as it’s sturdy 
and you can get a good grip on it. 
Cooldown
After bending the pipe around 
a mandrel or the household object of 
your choice, it generally takes about 30 
seconds for the pipe to become cool 
The end result isn’t even close to what we see from CPU’s Mad Reader Mods, but it’s a start.

When AORUS Met Ryzen 
GIGABYTE’s GA-AX370-Gaming K7 Is AM4 Done Right
Around January, we started getting reports 
from our engineers showing Ryzen had 
the potential to make a big splash. At 
that point we only had early engineering 
samples but the hype began to build. Fast-
forward to the launch of Ryzen 7, and it 
was clear AMD delivered.
“The [GA-AX370-Gaming K7] is our 
flagship AM4 motherboard, and we, like 
our customers, wanted it all. We started 
out with all the features and software that 
have become staples in our motherboard 
lineup such as RGB Fusion, Smart Fan 5, 
System Information Viewer, Dual Hybrid 
Fan headers, etc., but we knew we had to 
do more.”
Zen State Of Mind
As AMD marched 
toward Ryzen’s in-
evitable release, its 
partners, including 
GIGABYTE, followed 
closely behind. Al-
though the company 
has been developing 
motherboards for 
decades, AMD’s Zen 
microarchitecture 
required GIGABYTE 
to build an elite board 
around a brand-new 
platform.
Hurwitz explains 
GIGABYTE’s design 
process for the GA-
A X 3 7 0 - G a m i n g 
K7. “There are two 
important factors to 
keep in mind with a 
new platform: function 
and implementation. 
Function-wise, AMD 
has stepped up its 
feature set to include 
A
s far as seismic events that shake the 
PC industry go, AMD’s debut of 
its long-awaited Ryzen processors 
had to have registered at least an 8.0 on 
the Richter scale. After playing second 
fiddle to Intel’s chips for years, we finally 
have another series of very powerful 
and very affordable CPUs that look 
capable of challenging for the throne. 
Typical of AMD’s high-end offerings, 
every Ryzen has an unlocked multiplier, 
giving power users almost free reign to 
tinker with the CPUs, extracting even 
greater performance from Ryzen’s already 
formidable silicon. We covered Ryzen 
extensively last month, with our review 
of the Ryzen 7 1800X on page 22 and 
a four-page in-depth look at the Ryzen 
platform, starting on page 46.
However, every enthusiast with a 
modicum of experience knows that no 
processor can reach its true potential 
without a little help from an equally 
capable motherboard. A thorough BIOS, 
tough-as-nails board components, and an 
array of inputs and outputs do so much 
heavy lifting that one could make the case 
that an elite motherboard is every bit as 
crucial as the CPU itself. Ask anyone who’s 
ever tried to coax every last megahertz out 
of a processor with a budget motherboard 
and tell us what he said.
GIGABYTE wants Ryzen owners to 
push their new processors without fear 
or hesitation. When designing the GA-
AX370-Gaming K7, the company wanted 
its AM4 flagship to have every weapon 
possible at its disposal.
“When we first began getting specs 
for Ryzen, we were excited but cautiously 
skeptical,” says Matthew Hurwitz, 
GIGABYTE technical marketing manager. 
“Roadmaps and data sheets are great, 
but until you have a product in hand to 
test, you learn to curb your expectations. 
things like native USB 3.1 Gen. 2 support. 
Users looking to upgrade to the AM4 
platform should feel secure knowing they 
are buying a platform with a modern 
feature set to support the current hardware 
landscape and beyond.”
The dawn of the Ryzen Era wasn’t 
completely free of snags. Shortly after 
launch, AMD and motherboard makers 
had to contend with system memory 
support quirks that affected the range 
of speeds that worked with Ryzen-
compatible motherboards. Hurwitz says 
AMD made a splash when it released its Ryzen CPUs to the masses, and 
GIGABYTE was ready with the GA-AX370-Gaming K7. Armed with features 
like Turbo B-Clock, this AORUS motherboard should give power users the 
ability to squeeze every last drop of performance out of the new processors.

Cocked, Locked & Ready To Overclock
Befitting its role as the flagship of 
GIGABYTE’s X370 motherboards, the 
GA-AX370-Gaming K7 has virtually 
every bell and whistle in the company 
storeroom. It has sights to see and is 
cool for coolers. We’ll explore those in 
short order, but in order to really tap 
into Ryzen’s potential, GIGABYTE 
equipped this motherboard with 
components designed for overclocking 
and performance tuning.
One of the key ingredients is 
GIGABYTE’s Turbo B-Clock, a specialized 
IC engineered to—you guessed it—give 
power users greater control over their BCLK 
frequency. Using Turbo-Clock, the GA-
AX370-Gaming K7 opens up a 100MHz 
to 300MHz frequency range, essential for 
maximizing CPU and memory clocks.
“Turbo B-Clock lets users squeeze 
every megahertz out of their CPU and 
memory,” Hurwitz says. “Currently the 
highest multiplier for memory is 36X. 
If you want to push your memory past 
3,600MHz, Turbo B-Clock is a must.”
We have seen the light, literally. With the Age of LEDs upon us, the GA-AX370-Gaming K7 lets users put on a 
serious light show. Strategically placed LEDs (such as between the board’s DIMM slots, above) and serious 
software are proof of the resources GIGABYTE has devoted to making the LED experience top-notch.
Enthusiasts have no shortage of options with the GA-AX370-Gaming K7’s RGB Fusion software. Advanced users can dive into the desktop app to create 
custom colors and effects, make and share profiles, and more.
CPU  /  May2017 57

Expect GIGABYTE to supplement the 
GA-AX370-Gaming K7’s LED capabilities 
in the future. Hurwitz was short on 
details at the time of this writing, but he 
tells CPU that GIGABYTE is “working 
with . . . memory manufacturers to sync 
your motherboard, GPU, and RAM.”
Chill Out
Although the GA-AX370-Gaming K7 
is built to handle punishing workloads, 
GIGABYTE understands that the mother-
board is only part of the equation. In order 
to give enthusiasts virtually free reign 
over their cooling loadout, GIGABYTE 
litters the motherboard with fan/pump 
headers and temperature sensors, then ties 
everything to its Smart Fan 5 utility.
“Smart Fan 5 gives users full control 
over their system cooling profile,” Hurwitz 
explains. “We want our customers to be 
able to control and customize their system 
to match their usage scenario. Some users 
simply want plug and play. Others want to 
set very specific fan curves or voltages.”
These aren’t garden-variety headers, 
either. Of the GA-AX370-Gaming K7’s 
eight cooling headers, a pair supports 24W 
Elsewhere, the board possesses an 
abundance of IR (International Rectifier) 
components. Its 6+4-phase power delivery 
system consists of fourth-generation IR 
digital power controllers and third-gen 
PowIRstage ICs. The ICs also benefit from 
Isense, which spreads out the thermal 
load in order to keep individual ICs from 
coming under fire disproportionately.
Cue The Lights
Over the last year, LED lighting has 
exploded, going from a popular option 
for modders to a mainstay on just about 
every component imaginable. Most 
high-end motherboards have followed 
suit, sprinkling LEDs here and there in 
an effort to keep up with the competition.
The GA-AX370-Gaming K7 has 
plenty of LEDs, but GIGABYTE has 
done much more than merely load up 
the board and send it out to consumers. 
Consistent with the control the company 
has given power users over their 
components’ clocks, the GA-AX370-
Gaming K7 presents LED aficionados 
with a dazzling amount of command over 
LEDs both built into the board itself as 
well as third-party light strips connected 
to onboard headers. GIGABYTE collects 
the GA-AX370-Gaming K7’s LED 
capabilities under the “RGB Fusion” 
umbrella, which consists of a mobile 
app and an extensive desktop client. The 
software has a handful of basic options 
for someone who wants to quickly add 
a little visual pop, but its true power 
hides in Advanced Mode. Here, RGB 
Fusion goes well beyond creating custom 
RGB colors. You can make your own 
effects and transitions, isolate and tweak 
individual LED zones on the GA-AX370-
Gaming K7, and save each configuration 
as a custom profile.
The board’s RGBW pin header 
opens up more possibilities. As its name 
suggests, it’s able to address RGBW light 
strips (and, in conjunction with the RGB 
Fusion software, dynamically relocate pin 
“locations” for better compatibility) to 
produce better white light. UV-reactive

Upgrade To A Next-Level SSD
Our storage has been slowing us down for decades. The fastest processor and fistfuls of high-end RAM can be 
stopped dead in their tracks if your system’s storage bottleneck is particularly glaring. Early solid-state drives 
liberated us from the tyranny of sluggish HDDs, but as soon as manufacturers figured out how to optimize 
NAND and storage controllers we ran headlong into yet another bottleneck. Rather than hardware limitations, 
the 6Gbps SATA bus itself kept most SSDs from realizing their true potential.
We solved that problem, too, as the PCIe bus has all the bandwidth a solid-state drive could need. Gumstick 
SSDs that use the M.2 interface have flourished; we now have options galore. Budget builds, high-end gaming 
rigs, and everything in between—they should all have an SSD. And of course, solid-state drives continue to be 
an all-around awesome choice for enthusiasts seeking the best possible bang:buck ratio when upgrading their 
machines. We’ve collected 16 candidates worthy of your bucks.
Eye On Optane
Every now and then, a company zigs while the rest of the industry zags. That’s a fair description of Intel’s 
Optane drives, which take a different approach to solid-state storage. In 2015, Chipzilla whipped power users 
into a frenzy when it announced 3D XPoint memory, the product of a joint effort between Intel and Micron. 
Originally promoted as being a mouthwatering 1,000 times faster than traditional NAND, 3D XPoint SSDs looked 
like the next game-changing tech.
However, the first batch of Optane drives for desktop systems don’t quite live up to the early hype. Initial Optane 
SSDs will serve as a non-bootable cache, akin to Intel’s 20GB SSD 311 Series. By caching frequently used data, 
an Optane SSD teams up with a hard drive to yield far better results that what you’d otherwise get from a hard 
drive. Standard PCIe SSDs will outrace an Optane SSD cache, but enthusiasts will eventually be able to score a 
bootable 3D-XPoint-based drive. Our guess is that a consumer offering will look something like Intel’s Optane SSD 
DC P4800X, but retooled for client systems rather than data centers. Like any revolutionary hardware, expect to pay 
a hefty early adopter tax for a consumer version of the P4800X, as the 375GB version of the drive carries a $1,520 
MSRP. If you can both afford a drive and afford to wait, these SSDs could yet deliver on Intel’s 3D XPoint promises.

Why You’ll Dig It: Forget for a moment that Intel launched the SSD 750 Series two years ago. These drives have withstood the test of time and remain one 
of the best options for anyone looking for a PCIe NVMe SSD. Don’t let that MSRP scare you, either; we didn’t have any trouble finding this drive online for less 
than $850 (you might be able to scare up one for even less than that), and 1.2TB is a lot of fiendishly fast storage. How fast? We’re glad you asked. The 1.2TB 
SSD 750 Series drive zooms around the test track at a brisk pace of 2,400MBps for sequential reads and 1,200MBps for sequential writes. It handles random 
I/O pretty well, too, clocking random reads of 440,000 IOPS and random writes of 290,000 IOPS. If you have other plans for your motherboard’s PCIe x16 or x4 
slots, Intel has you covered, as the SSD 750 Series drives are 
also available in a 2.5-inch U.2 form factor. (Make sure your 
mobo supports U.2, naturally). As you probably expect at this 
point, Intel backs its flagship SSDs with a five-year warranty. 
Who Should Apply: Simply put, power users who 
want a PCIe SSD that is very, very big and very, very fast.

Why You’ll Dig It: Patriot is one of the OGs of enthusiast SSDs, so when the company introduces its high-end PCIe NVMe SSDs, you pay attention. 
Along with its 240GB little brother, the 480GB Hellfire represents Patriot’s current crop of PCIe SSDs. With a Phison 5007-E7 controller at its disposal, 
this SSD runs circles around hard drives and 6Gbps SATA SSDs. And of course, the Hellfire is also capable of hanging with other PCIe SSDs. According 
to Patriot’s internal testing, both Hellfires soar to 3,000MBps sequential reads in ATTO; the 480GB Hellfire yields slightly better sequential write 
throughput—2,400MBps. In CrystalDiskMark’s sequential tests, the Hellfires pump the brakes a bit, as the 480GB Hellfire turns in reads and writes 
of 2,550MBps and 1,260MBps, respectively. We think you’ll agree that’s still crazy fast. Random performance is similarly electric. When the 480GB 
Hellfire is firing on all cylinders, 4K random writes 
top out at 210,000 IOPS, and the drive can hit 
170,000 IOPS for random reads. Built-in ECC (up 
to 120 bits per 2KB), bad block management, and 
static and dynamic wear leveling are additional 
perks you’ll get from this devilishly good SSD.

Why You’ll Dig It: As it turns out, ZOTAC has more goodies for your PCIe slots besides graphics cards. Released last year, ZOTAC’s SONIX is the 
company’s first PCIe NVMe SSD, and it’s a burner. Equipped with Toshiba MLC NAND, a 512MB DRAM cache, and a Phison controller, the 480GB 
SONIX manages a sizzling 2,600MBps on sequential reads and 1,300MBps on sequential writes. Plus, ZOTAC wraps the SONIX in a sleek enclosure 
(you can’t see it in the image below, but ZOTAC’s logo is carved into the SONIX backplate) that’s more than a pretty face. Beneath the metal, a heat 
spreader covers the drive’s controller and its NAND, which is particularly helpful considering some PCIe SSDs have been susceptible to thermal 
throttling. ZOTAC covers the SONIX with a three-year warranty.

LEDs (white and red, respectively), so it will fit right in with that slick build you’re planning. For enthusiasts who prefer the M.2 form factor, the M8Pe(G) is 
Plextor’s gumstick take on the drive, and it features a heatsink that matches the M8Pe(Y)’s design. Of course, the M8Pe(Y) is more than a pretty face. The 
512GB version featured here carved up CrystalDiskMark’s 
sequential tests, slicing and dicing its way to 2,300MBps 
reads and 1,300MBps writes. Its random performance is just 
as strong. In IOMeter at a queue depth of 32, the M8Pe(Y) 
delivered random 4KB reads up to 260,000 IOPS and random 
4KB writes up to 250,000 IOPS. Plextor also punished the 
M8Pe(Y) for two days of sustained read and write testing, 
1,008 hours of error testing, and 250 power cycles. In other

Why You’ll Dig It: If ever there was an ADATA SSD that lived up to the company’s XPG (Xtreme Performance Gear) label, it’s the XPG SX8000. ADATA 
released its XPG SX8000 PCIe NVMe SSDs into the wild last fall, and they’ve been a strong option ever since. Under the hood, so to speak, you’ll find 
a Silicon Motion SM2260 storage controller and 3D MLC NAND, and this SSD knows a few additional tricks, as well. By using intelligent SLC caching, 
ADATA reserves a portion of the XPG SX8000’s NAND to act like SLC, boosting read/write throughput for frequently accessed data; a built-in DRAM cache 
buffer can also increase performance. At a queue depth of 32, 
this drive can read data sequentially at a smokin’ 2,500MBps. 
Sequential writes are well beyond anything a 6Gbps SATA SSD 
can hope for, too, with the XPG SX8000 reaching 1,100MBps at 
full speed. It deals with 4KB random data at up to 140,000 IOPS 
and 150,000 IOPS for reads and writes, respectively. As proof 
these drives are built to last, ADATA backs the whole family 
with a five-year warranty. Look around online, and you can

now they’re more affordable than ever. Corsair’s Force Series LE 960GB 
is a can’t-miss option for anyone looking for almost a terabyte of solid-
state storage on the cheap. As it does with its Force Series MP SSDs, 
Corsair turns to Phison (specifically, the PS3110-S10) for the Force Series 
LE’s storage controller. For any drive with room to store a bunch of data, 
keeping said data safe and sound is extremely important. Corsair got the 
memo. Technologies like SmartECC and SmartRefresh are designed to 
ward off data-destroying errors that can occur within NAND cells, while 
tried-and-true wear-leveling and garbage collection techniques keep this

are pretty amazing for being the company’s “mainstream” SSDs. As you 
might know, Samsung likes to keep R&D under its own roof, so the 960 
EVO’s Polaris controller and V-NAND are both homegrown. The combination 
works, as the 1TB 960 EVO has hustle to spare: 3,200MBps sequential 
reads and 1,900MBps sequential writes aren’t too far removed from the 
960 PRO drives’ 3,500MBps and 2,100MBps sequential performance. At 
a queue depth of 1 and a single thread, the 1TB reads random 4KB data 
at 14,000 IOPS and writes it at 50,000 IOPS, but when you feed it with 
four simultaneous threads at a queue depth of 32, random performance 
skyrockets to 380,000 IOPS (read) and 360,000 IOPS (write). Samsung also

Why You’ll Dig It: Every power user deserves a turbocharged SSD, but not every power user has the cash to sink into a big drive, which generally delivers 
the best performance. Riding to the rescue is Patriot’s 240GB Hellfire PCIe SSD. What this drive lacks in capacity (although, let’s be honest, 240GB is more than 
enough for your OS, a couple of games, and a few high-priority applications) it makes up for in speed. Patriot ran the Hellfire through ATTO and CrystalDiskMark 
to show how fast it can be, and the results are undeniably impressive. The 240GB Hellfire charged through ATTO’s sequential tests, producing a maximum read 
of 3,000MBps and a max write of 2,300MBps. In CDM’s sequential tests, this Hellfire isn’t as fast, but fast (2,740MBps sequential read) is still fast (1,090MBps 
sequential write). You should also feel good about this Hellfire’s random performance. Its 4K random read of 170,000 IOPS is just as good as the 480GB Hellfire, 
and a maximum random write of 185,000 IOPS is just 
a slight drop from the 480GB Hellfire’s 210,000 IOPS. 
This SSD is $130 well spent.

Why You’ll Dig It: When other companies were introducing their first attempt at PCIe NVMe SSDs, Samsung was busy cranking out its second 
generation of high-end drives. As a result, the flagship 960 PRO series is the company’s best yet, which is saying something when you consider the 
last-gen 950 PRO SSDs remain ridiculously good. In terms of raw power, the 1TB 960 PRO is a force of nature. Its rated sequential performance almost 
looks like a misprint: 3,500MBps reads and 2,100MBps writes. A quad-threaded workload of 4KB random data at a queue depth of 32 shows off 
the potential of Samsung’s Polaris controller, too. In this scenario, the 1TB 960 PRO clocks maximum random reads of 440,000 IOPS and maximum 
random writes of 360,000 IOPS. Yes, you’ll pay a premium 
for a 960 PRO, but in addition to the terrific performance the 
960 PRO is built to last. Samsung covers these SSDs for five

is ongoing, too, so expect Mesen to be 
even better over time. When you feel like 
pressing pause on Breath of the Wild, 
Mesen is a blast from the past that should 
make any NES purist happy. ■
ROMs are essentially cartridge-less 
games that require an emulator to play. 
Consider Mesen, which has been under 
development for a little over a year and is 
an intriguing offering.
Multi-threaded and built in C++, 
Mesen tries to faithfully re-create the NES 
console. It has passed a staggering 157 of

intendo’s NES Classic Edition has been 
perpetually sold out since its release. 
People aren’t really buying Nintendo Switch 
consoles so much as they’re paying $350 to 
be able to play the latest Zelda installment 
(on balance, still not a bad investment). If 
you’re still looking for proof that the 8-bit 
NES is an immortal game console, we don’t 
know what else to offer as evidence.
Prior to—and after, for that matter—
the advent of the NES Classic Edition 
and Nintendo’s Virtual Console, most 
old-school gamers got their hit of 
nostalgia using an emulator. (Please, 
consult your attorney before use.) 
Although this is far and away the 
most common use for NES emulators, 
our collective love of classic Nintendo

Angry Koala is also an inclusive koala. 
It’s is available for Linux, Windows, and 
macOS, so you can put it to work for you 
no matter what your preferred platform 
happens to be. The software is still in 
diapers; if you want to wait to trust Gaucho 
with your mission-critical work, as it were, 
we don’t blame you. At the very least, 
though, it’s already worthy of a test drive. ■
Gaucho is, at its core, a task and app 
launcher. Power users who spend a lot 
of time rooting around in their shell or 
terminal will get a lot of mileage out of 
this program. Adding and editing tasks 
is plain and simple, and Gaucho is of 
course able to juggle them in multiples. 
You can group tasks together into suites, 
then launch them with the Run button.
W
e admit it: We’re often guilty of 
discussing power users only in the 
context of modders, overclockers, and 
other hardware enthusiasts. It’s easy to 
get carried away when there’s so much 
awesome hardware out there, but there are 
plenty of power users who are perfectly 
content using components at stock speeds 
while tweaking their system for better 
performance. For our power users that 
prefer to stick with software, Gaucho 
could be your Huckleberry.
Gaucho already scores points in our book 
for coming from a developer named “Angry 
Koala.” But this open-source software’s real 
appeal is how it proves that powerful doesn’t 
have to be synonymous with complicated 
or Byzantine. Its UI is minimalist to the 
point of being nearly non-existant, yet it 
does what it needs to do without being ugly. 
For a program like Gaucho, you really don’t 
need anything more.

Drone Racing 
A Hobby Grows Into A Burgeoning Professional Sport 
day jobs to race professionally full-
time. The following looks at the 
sport’s remarkable progression in just 
a few years’ time.
A Sport In The Sky
Undoubtedly, 2016 was a pivotal 
year for drone racing, a sport that 
only really traces back several years 
to when hobbyists in Australia 
and California reportedly began 
gathering in parks, empty fields, 
abandoned buildings, and other 
locales to share a collective interest in 
two things humans have always been 
interested in: flight and competition. 
By 2015, local race groups 
began emerging in increasing 
numbers. Soon, regional and 
national organizations surfaced 
and helped bring life to major 
regional, national, and international 
championship races in 2016 in 
such locations as Miami, Dubai, 
New York City, and Hawaii. 
Three more notable organizations 
driving the sport forward include 
the DRL (Drone Racing League), 
IDRA (International Drone Racing 
Association), and MultiGP Drone 
Racing League. 
“There were several events that 
defined 2016 as being the breakout 
year for drone racing,” says Justin 
Haggerty, founder and CEO of IDRA, 
which helped stage the inaugural World 
Drone Prix in Dubai. What happens this 
year will help determine if the sport’s 
early momentum can continue, he says. 
“Drone racing is a young sport that’s 
growing globally, but the community 
remains small,” he says. To succeed, “the 
human experience must drive its culture,” 
he adds. That’s why IDRA is holding 
its Drone Racing Series and IDRA 
will only fly faster and longer. “If this 
continues, then who knows where we will 
be in the next few years,” Browning says. 
Already, drone racing leagues and 
organizations have attracted major 
partnerships and exposure from the likes 
of Mountain Dew, ESPN, The Discovery 
Channel, and notable investors. Beyond 
race series and national and world 
championships, drone racing is also 
featuring enough prize and sponsorship 
money that some racers are ditching their 
W
atching a drone race can 
get intense. After all, we’re 
talking about LED-bearing, 
propeller-twirling aircraft 
navigated by pilots to speeds 
of 80mph or faster buzzing like 
a pack of crazed black birds 
down narrow hallways, around 
flags, through hoops, and 
past other strategically placed 
obstacles. Then there are the 
crashes. They happen often 
and out of blue, such that the 
impact of two drones colliding 
in midair or a drone smashing 
into a concrete wall genuinely 
startles you. 
Collectively, the crashes, 
high speeds, and pilots’ 
superior flying skills on display 
have helped drone racing grow 
into a burgeoning professional 
sport. Commonly described 
as “flying robots” or esports 
happening in real world, 
drone racing shares traits with 
NASCAR and Formula One 
but also uses technology—FPV 
(first-person view) goggles, 
onboard cameras, radio 
receivers/transmitters, and 
more—in uniquely exciting 
ways to provide participants 
and spectators a super-charged bird’s-eye 
view of the action not common with other 
sports. Drone racing is also the rare sport 
in which seemingly anyone can excel no 
matter the age, gender, or physical ability. 
“Watching six drones take off and 
fly through one gate at one time is 
exhilarating, especially when there’s 
destruction,” says Rudi Browning, a 
13-year-old highly ranked drone racer 
from Australia. As the sport’s technology 
continues to advance, he says, pilots

to be associated with massive blue-chip 
companies like Allianz,” Horbaczewski says.
DRL actually considers itself a 
technology company. As such, while racers 
in other organizations build, modify, 
customize, and repair their own race 
drones, DRL racers fly identical aircraft 
DRL builds in-house. “That’s important 
in a few ways,” Horbaczewski says. “One, 
it levels the playing field, so when a pilot 
wins, you know it was pilot skill that drove 
the victory and not a slightly faster drone.” 
Crashes also factored into the decision. 
“Drone racing is a sport that involves a 
lot of crashing, and the races are relatively 
constrained by both the crash rate and the 
battery life. So you need a lot of drones,” 
says Horbaczewski. DRL brings 500 
drones to each race, which enables more 
expansive racing than if racers “show up 
with a homemade drone,” Horbaczewski 
says. “I just don’t think there’s a 
professional sport out there that people 
use homemade equipment as the primary 
equipment of the league,” he adds. Using 
in-house drones also enables DRL to 
gather data from the onboard CPUs to 
improve performance. DRL’s proprietary 
Recently, DRL partnered with Allianz to 
make the global insurance company the title 
sponsor of DRL’s 2017 race circuit. “I think 
it really changes the position of the sport 
Challengers Cup as open-registration 
and publicly held events, Haggerty says. 
The organization recently completed a 
Challengers Cup race in Istanbul.
In terms of backing, Haggerty says 
investors and media platforms have 
recognized drone racing’s potential, but 
not all have been a good fit. As such, 
IDRA walked away from various early 
opportunities, including a three-year deal 
with ESPN. Now, IDRA is emphasizing 
an online-platform strategy that includes 
partnerships with Dailymotion and a 
three-year distribution deal with Amazon 
Prime Instant Video.  
Although 2016 marked DRL’s first 
year, it managed to ink several deals, 
including one that saw ESPN air its races. 
“In 2017, we’re taking everything we 
learned last year and enhancing the sport 
with it,” says Nick Horbaczewski, DRL 
founder and CEO. That means more 
races and DRL’s first international races in 
places such as Munich and London. 
“We’ve also substantially upgraded our 
technology, which allows us to race on larger 
courses in more interesting places with 
faster drones,” Horbaczewski says. “That 
will really enhance the viewing experience.” 
Unlike other race leagues and organizations, Drone Racing League builds all the drones used in its 
races in-house, with the theory being that the best pilot wins a race and not the best drone. 
Many drone race events, including ones the MultiGP Drone Racing League helps stage, go beyond just 
holding races to include educational and instructional workshops that teach newcomers how to build 
and race drones.

didn’t,” he says. “The technology to do it 
on an amateur scale existed, but the gap 
between what you need for a professional 
event and an amateur event is huge.” 
Learning Through Competition
While DRL racers use identical drones 
for competition and race-ready kits are 
also available to buy, a large swath of drone 
racers build, mod, customize, and repair 
their own drones. Michael Gianoutsos, 
MultiGP chief marketing officer, says 
these areas of interest are what create the 
great sense of community among racers. 
“There are guys out there really interested 
in the software, but there are guys really 
interested in making the frames, and then 
other guys are really into organizing events. 
There are all these spheres of influence 
that you can go into, and it helps grow the 
community,” he says. 
MultiGP has worked to round up, 
provide direction to, and transform 
hundreds of local drone race groups into 
formal race chapters while maintaining a 
community vibe. The organization claims 
about 15,000 registered users and 1,000 
volunteer-run race chapters. “In the same 
age of social media, we started to see 
Facebook [drone racing] groups starting to 
pop up,” says Gianoutsos. Using a grass-
roots approach, MultiGP is working to 
put a coach and race field in every chapter 
city, something that’s creating a conduit 
for direct communication that “keeps us 
all connected,” says Shawn O’Sullivan, 
MultiGP head of press relations. 
MultiGP has also worked to bring 
uniformity to the various race formats and 
race classes that local groups use. “That’s 
ultimately the best way to succeed, having 
something that’s repeatable,” O’Sullivan 
says. Thus, on any given Sunday, MultiGP 
can help stage “a high-quality event 
anywhere from Boston to Bulgaria,” he 
says. In October, MultiGP will stage 
a national championship event in Las 
Vegas featuring racers who’ve advanced 
from about 15 regional qualifiers. Beyond 
racing, though, MultiGP requires chapters 
to stage constructive workshops, including 
to help newcomers learn how to build and 
operate race drones. 
from other organizations that have tried to 
build professional drone racing leagues but 
have fallen short. “It was sort of a faulty 
assumption to assume the technology to 
do this on a professional scale existed. It

challenges concerning racing indoors at

Virtual Practice Makes A Drone Racer 
Talk to anyone involved in drone racing and you’ll hear basically the same warning: You’re going 
to crash your race drone, and probably sooner rather than later. Even experienced pilots of 
hobbyist drones will find piloting racing drones much different due to the greater speed and extent 
to which pilots are in manual control of every aspect of flying, drone racers profess. 
A simulator is one way to gain racing experience without real-world ramifications. DRL (Drone 
Racing League) offers the well-known, multiplayer Racing Simulator, which the organization itself 
claims can “save you a ton of money considering the amount of crashing that can happen when 
first starting out.” Available for Windows and Mac systems and supporting compatible console and 
drone controllers, the simulator offers virtual versions of actual courses that DRL racers race. 
Nick Horbaczewski, DRL CEO, says one challenge drone racing faces is that there’s a pretty high 
barrier of entry into the sport. “Someone has to be interested and passionate enough to go out and 
learn all the hardware design and software, and once they’ve done all that, they need to learn how to 
fly it,” he says. “And learning how to fly it can be a painful process. This is a very high-skill activity, 
and I think people sometimes confuse that.” Compared to a hobbyist drone that “kind of flies itself,” 
Horbaczewski says race drones are fully manual-performance aircraft. 
Horbaczewski himself learned to race drones using DRL’s simulator. “I was actually competent 
enough I could fly it and focus on getting better as opposed to just repairing my drone that I 
crashed every couple of seconds,” he says. Broadly, the simulator is one area DRL is investing in 
to make entering the sport easier. “If a 9-year-old sees this on TV and says, ‘That’s really cool,’ 
they can download the game and play it, and they’re off researching drones and learning about 
design and getting technology,” he says.  
DRL is also using the 
simulator to discover 
new racers. In January, it 
partnered with Bud Light 
for the 2017 Bud Light DRL 
Tryouts where 24 participants 
converged in New York City 
to compete live for a $75,000 
pro contract for DRL’s 2017 
race season. “Now he’s 
traveling around the world 
with us and flying in real 
races,” Horbaczewski says. 
“What other sport gives you 
an opportunity to try out for 
a real sport through a virtual 
simulation that translates to 
real life?”
Drones made specifically for racing are often described as being 
more difficult to fly than commercial hobby drones due to the 
amount of manual control involved. Drone simulators, such as 
this one from Drone Racing League, let would-be pilots get up to 
speed before trying the real thing.

by an 11-year-old boy. “Drone racing is 
a father-and-son activity for him and his 
father,” O’Sullivan says. “Not only that, 
they have a three-generation connection. 
His grandfather also goes to the events, and 
he has a history in aviation engineering. It’s 
that interaction that we find so fascinating.” 
Broadly, O’Sullivan says drone racing 
taps into a primal desire humans past and 
present have shared to experience flight. 
“It doesn’t matter what nation you live 
in, at one point in time every human 
being dreams of flight,” he says. “That’s 
something we can actually achieve every 
single weekend, and the ability to pass that 
that loves technology is coming in,” says 
Gianoutsos. “The other cool part is we’re 
seeing a lot of youth come in because the 
fathers have realized drone racing is a really 
neat hybrid between a videogame and real 
life.” That element is getting kids active 
and socializing with others to learn about 
software, electrical engineering, and other 
skills they can apply elsewhere. 
O’Sullivan, who dubs MultiGP race 
events the “modern generation’s Pinewood 
Derby,” says the multi-generational 
connections drone races enable are crucial 
to the sport’s growth. He points to a recent 
regional qualifier race in California won 
Many people enter drone racing 
with or through a parent, child, spouse, 
sibling, friend, or other connection, 
something that sets up natural student-
mentor opportunities. Layering STEM 
opportunities in drone races also has 
many people within the sport excited. As 
Horbaczewski says, “What other sport 
exists that has real social value for the 
participants to learn really valuable skills 
in educational areas? It’s fantastic to see 
that emerge.”  
At MultiGP events, chapters commonly 
reach out to PC, virtual reality, and other 
potentially interested parties. “Everyone 
Make Space For The Big Boys
Australia’s Freedom Class Giant Drone Sports believes bigger is better 
where drone racing is concerned. The racing drone it’s creating is about 
10 times the size of typical race drones. Freedom Class believes that 
makes for a better live race experience. The following is part of our 
conversation with Chris Ballard, the organization’s co-founder.  
Q: What benefits do giant drones provide that smaller drones might not?
CB: Given the huge size (about 4 feet across), coupled with the massive 
power-to-weight ratio (60kW of electric motor power and overall 
weight of about 66 pounds), there’s a lot of space for equipment that 
the smaller aircraft cannot accommodate. This includes a full autopilot 
system with GPS that allows for numerous safety features, as well 
as the addition of geo-fencing; telemetry that allows 50 different bits 
of data to be communicated every 200ms, allowing for enhanced 
broadcast information, live visual tracking, and pilot and aircraft strategy 
management among many other possibilities; and HD video systems that 
allow a digital video stream to occur, providing significantly better visuals 
over the current norm in drone racing. Apart from those digital aspects, 
these aircraft are large enough to watch as a spectator. You can see them, 
hear them, and really feel them as they roar past, shaking the very air.
Q: What purpose will the Freedom 500 Series satisfy?
CB: The Freedom 500 is the step up from regular drone racing that’s 
necessary before a pilot can become a Freedom Class pilot. The Freedom 
500 is roughly twice the size of a regular racing drone in a package that’s 
significantly more aerodynamic than the popular flat-plate design of the 
regular racing drone. This extra size allows us to place the same systems 
that the Freedom Class has, making it suited for live broadcast, as well 
as being a perfect training system for drone racing pilots looking to 
step up their careers at an affordable price point. To become a Freedom 
500 racer, the pilot must first undergo the Freedom safety training and 
licensing system, a first in the world of drone racing. Freedom Class will 
be selecting the best pilots from the Freedom 500 series to undergo initial 
training and testing on the Freedom Class Giant Racing Drones.
Q: How does designing, prototyping, and piloting a giant drone 
compare to smaller drones?
CB: Designing a Freedom Class isn’t comparable to a regular racing 
drone. A regular racing drone is cut from flat carbon fiber sheets, usually 
between 3 and 6mm in thickness and held together with nuts and bolts. It 
usually weighs about 0.7 to 1.4 pounds and has up to 2kW of total power. 
The Freedom Class is designed from the ground up to be aerodynamic, 
so it’s a necessity to use molded carbon fiber to form the shell, which 
additionally adds strength and rigidity that is a must when dealing with 
60kW of electric motors. The Freedom Class V1.0 was handcrafted carbon 
fiber, initially created as a testbed for the power train, which worked 
beautifully. The airframe, however, started to experience significant 
vibrations at about 99mph, which lead to the total redesign of the chassis 
and surfaces. The firmware the Freedom Class uses and the Freedom 
500 used is a key difference to a regular drone racer. This software is 
meticulously tested and accredited to the highest of international aviation 
standards: DO-178C at its highest level of criticality (DAL-A).
Q: What are Freedom Class’s plans for the near future? Is an 
inaugural race planned this year?
CB: We’re taking a measured and holistic approach to creating an 
inaugural race leading to an international series. We’re ensuring that 
the Freedom 500 and the Freedom Class adhere to strict and in-depth 
safety systems and structured operational procedures, from the design 
process, manufacturing phases, and initial testing to the pilot training and 
licensing. Once that’s completed to an international standard, we’ll be 
announcing our inaugural races.

Competition-wise, drone racing is 
mentally taxing. In that way, it’s similar to 
esports, says McIntyre, who started flying 
drones to freestyle, do tricks, and “fly cool 
spots” before turning to racing. “Besides 
moving around your thumbs, you aren’t 
doing much moving,” he says. Mentally, 
however, “you have to strategize and look 
for lines prerace and during practice, and 
when it comes down to the actual racing, 
it’s just intense focus and concentration.” 
Cost-wise, drone racing is relatively 
affordable to enter compared to other 
sports, including auto racing, which it’s 
often compared to. “I love racing. My dad 
competed in the NHRA for 18 years,” 
says Haggerty. Unfortunately, he adds, car 
racing is also extremely expensive for most 
people. “Don’t get me wrong, building 
$500-plus drones and crashing often is 
expensive,” Haggerty explains. “However, 
the financial barrier to entry in drone 
racing is far lower than in auto racing. 
It’s for this reason that done racing will 
become one of the leading motorsports in 
the world.”  
McIntyre estimates it takes about 
$1,000 to buy everything needed to race 
with friends in a field if the pilot can 
learn from online resources and solder 
and has a basic knowledge of electronics. 
other as pilots. “The competition is fierce, 
and people will get upset when they aren’t 
doing as well as they think they should, 
but at the same time, everyone realizes we 
are playing with toys, so the atmosphere is 
usually pretty light,” he says. In fact, if a racer 
is experiencing a problem, McIntyre says 
“there are usually two people trying to help.” 
on to other generations above and those 
coming after us is very important and one 
of the foundation stones of MultiGP.” 
Flyers, Start Your Propellers
One of the most unique traits of drone 
racing is that it doesn’t discriminate. As 
O’Sullivan says, drone racing is a “truly 
agnostic sport” in that it doesn’t recognize 
age, race, sex, or physical ability. “This is 
something that almost everyone can do,” 
he says. Similarly, Horbaczewski says what 
makes drone racing so wonderful is that it 
crosses age and gender boundaries. “You 
can have a 9-year-old and 50-year-old 
racing on the same track, and there isn’t 
any inherent disadvantage there,” he says. 
Luke Bannister is evidence of this. The 
U.K. native won the 2016 World Grand 
Drone Prix and its $250,000 top prize at 
just 15 years old. Australia’s Rudi Browning 
is just 13 but already has several sponsors. 
He placed 13th at the 2016 Drone World 
Championships in Hawaii. “I’ve been flying 
drones for about two years now and am 
loving every minute of it,” he says. “It’s a 
high-adrenaline sport and is very exciting.” 
Despite intense competition, pro drone 
racer Travis “M0ke” McIntyre says racers are 
ultimately all friends who look up to each 
For several obvious reasons, many people describe drone racing as esports playing out in the real 
world. Like esports, drone racing isn’t physically demanding, meaning essentially anyone can take part. 
Mentally, however, the sport requires extreme concentration and execution. 
A major component of drone racing is the DIY mentality that pilots possess in terms of building, 
modifying, customizing, and repairing their own drones. Many credit this mindset for helping build the 
community atmosphere that drone racing is said to offer.

points to social media as an excellent resource 
for advice. “There are many forums full of 
intelligent people who are more than willing 
to help out,” he says. “However, when it 
comes to race day, most pilots play their 
cards close to their chest. It often gets quite 
competitive, but that’s all part of the fun.” ■
For those interested in racing drones, 
Browning advises against buying “cheap 
rubbish and clones” because they often 
break quickly. Instead, seek out sellers that 
specialize in drones, as they’ll have everything 
needed and typically offer great customer 
service and advice, he says. Browning also 
Becoming more competitive requires 
“spending a lot more money and time,” 
he says, particularly to stay current with 
the new products constantly coming out. 
“While I’m one to wait and see what 
other people have to say about [new 
products], there are plenty of people who 
are constantly buying all the new stuff 
looking for that edge,” McIntyre says. 
Buying a kit can allow a racer to “just 
plug and play,” but this route can mean 
considerable upkeep costs, McIntyre says. 
Propellers are cheap, for example, but a 
racer can easily go through several sets 
a day. There’s also a time investment to 
consider. “Not only does it take time 
to learn to fly and get good at it, but 
repairing drones and troubleshooting 
problems takes up a big chunk of time, 
too,” he says. 
Browning estimates 50% of drone 
racing is spent on repair, modification, 
customization, and building tasks. “Every 
single part is soldered together and is then 
programmed and tuned to fly however 
you may like,” he says. Racers also 
must understand how different frames, 
motors, propellers, and other components 
impact flight traits. “Modding drones 
is important, because at a high level of 
racing, you need different drones for 
different tracks,” Browning says. “Each 
drone may vary in speed, efficiency, torque, 
or flying time. It just depends on the day.”
As for race formats, McIntyre says there 
are two main types: racing once with the 
result determining the pace or racing 
multiple heats with overall points from 
each heat determining final standings. 
Because luck can largely factor into races, 
McIntyre says multiple-heat races seem to 
be the better system. “When it’s a one-heat 
race and you have a midair collision off the 
start, you’re out. Whereas in a multi-heat 
system, you could still win if you do well 
in the other heats,” he says. The different 
formats also influence the pilot’s given 
strategy. “Flying conservatively in a multi-
heat race can get you more points if you’re 
consistent and other competitors aren’t,” 
McIntyre says. “If it’s a one-heat race, you’ll 
probably push yourself a little harder to get 
a top spot.”
Drone Racing & STEM 
While the STEM opportunities created by done racing don’t typically receive a lot of attention, they 
have tremendous potential. In Baltimore, for example, drone company Global Air Media recently 
announced a Baltimore Drone Racing League for students, along with a partnership with a local 
makerspace organization to enable workshops that teach students and adults how to build and fly 
drones—skills that could translate into jobs and careers in a quickly growing sector. 
Last fall, the IDRA (International Drone Racing Association) hosted a congressional briefing to 
announce a nonprofit UAS (unmanned aircraft system) STEM Alliance that governmental agencies, 
congressional members, and corporations will participate in. IDRA CEO Justin Haggerty says 
promoting STEM education via drone technology and racing and thus establishing middle and 
high school drone programs will help “create the engineers and pilots of tomorrow” while also 
helping the drone racing community flourish. 
Nick Horbaczewski, DRL (Drone Racing League) CEO and founder, says numerous high school drone 
race leagues are already surfacing. “I’ve talked with some of the teachers involved in some of those 
efforts, and they love it because in their minds, [students are] learning hardware. They’re learning 
software. They’re learning robotics,” he says. “It’s rare you see science becoming sport in a way 
that’s convincing to both the science teacher and student-athlete. That’s what makes drone racing 
so special; it’s a true form of STEM education wrapped in a form that’s exciting for the participant.” 
As drones continue proving their commercial worth, more people are understanding the skill involved 
in flying them. “And we see it trickling down to schools,” says Michael Gianoutsos, MultiGP Drone 
Racing League chief marketing officer. In addition to high schools and middle schools, elementary 
schools are reaching out to MultiGP. “They want to know, ‘How can we get kids interested in new 
technology?’ This is one carrot that kids love because it’s fun and cool,” he says. 
Drones also have the ability to get kids outside, says Shawn O’Sullivan, MultiGP head of press 
relations. “Not like Pokémon GO, but actually bringing them outside and keeping them outside,” 
he says. “When you figure the average cost of involvement is about the same price as a 
videogame system, you can get into drone racing and get off the couch,” he says. Once kids are 
able to understand the concepts of the drone, or “STEM in a box,” as O’Sullivan says, they get 
hooked and “want to be outside more.” 
Horbaczewski sees drone racing enabling a “wonderful crossover” where someone can transition 
from seeing drone racing as something that’s cool to actually becoming competent in areas that 
STEM programs are designed to encourage students to get involved with. “I think you’re seeing 
people in the sport who probably wouldn’t have gotten interested in those areas getting extremely 
interested and becoming sort of experts so to speak because of their passion for the sport,” he 
says. “To borrow a phrase, [drone racing] is almost the ‘gamification of STEM.’ I think it’s an 
amazing opportunity, especially for educators who struggle to find a way to make these students 
want to get excited about these topics they should be excited about.”

The End-All Be-All 
Of Walking Simulators
BY ANDREW LEIBMAN
$15 (PC, PS4)   •   ESRB: (E)veryone
Double Fine Presents & David OReilly   •   www.everything-game.com
Everything is a game that a certain contingent of people will complain isn’t a 
game. Typically, these minimally interactive experiences—often pejoratively 
referred to as walking simulators—tend to focus on a narrative, and when 
the story is well done, we’re willing to forgive the inability to fire a weapon, 
wield a pick axe, or drive a car. This game, however, doesn’t have a coherent 
narrative thread in any form. What it does have, though, is everything else. 
In David OReilly’s Everything, you start out as a spec of light cruising through 
space. “Press X to think” and text pondering the nature of your existence 
appears. And then you’re a brown cow, rolling end-over-end through a grassy 
low-poly valley. There are a handful of trees, rocks, bushes, monkeys, bears, 
tufts of grass, and a small swarm of bees buzzing around. 
There’s a hazy circle at the top of the screen and occasionally arrows appear 
at the circle’s edges. The top and bottom arrows indicate the opportunity to 
ascend and descend by clicking and holding the right and left mouse buttons 
and selecting the triangles, respectively, which amount to zooming into or 
out of the current realm. For instance, descending into an ant from the cow 
shrinks your view so that you become aware of items that are similar in 
scale, such as leaves, mushrooms, worms, beetles, and pebbles. Descend 
again and you’ll go microscopic, joining the company of protozoa, DNA, 
molecules, elements, and plant pollen. When you encounter the arrow at the 
top of the circle, you can ascend through the realms up to galaxies, then a 
realm of kaleidoscopic pulsating shapes and theoretical particles, and back to 
the microscopic realm again. When an arrow appears on the right or left side 
of the circle, that means there’s a nearby opportunity to shift your control to 
something larger or smaller within your current realm. Click and hold the right 
or left mouse button again, then release it when the circle at the center of the 
screen intersects with the circle around the object you want to become. 
As you transfer to more things, you collect them, eventually unlocking the 
ability to transform into anything you’ve collected. Over time, you’ll unlock 
the ability to change the scale of anything. Aside from the drive to merely 
collect stuff, the game lets you band together things of the same type or 
things that are similar, or just create a massive group of everything you 
encounter. You can also dance when in a group of two or more or talk to 
various things to hear them talk back and react via stylized emoticons. 
As you explore, you’ll come across thought bubbles and audio prompts that 
trigger a recorded snippet of a lecture from famed philosopher Alan Watts. 
At this point, it’s safe to say that Everything is not for everybody, but if you’re 
intrigued by Watts’ musings, they do manage to add some colorful context 
to your explorations. In a bizarre twist for a game full of bizarre things, 
you can even put down the controls and the game will start to play itself. 
Documentary mode, which randomly cycles through things while displaying a 
Wikipedia-sourced description, has become our favorite screensaver. 
As long as you’re not opposed to a game being described by the phrases 
“interactive experience,” “existential philosophy,” and “rolling bears,” you, like 
us, may find yourself thoroughly enjoying what Everything has to offer. ■
Yeah, we know you have blogs to post, video to encode, reports to write, and code to compile. We do, 
too, but you have to take a break once in a while (and maybe blow some stuff up). That’s why each

Driven Insane
BY ANDREW LEIBMAN
$39.99 (PC, XOne, PS4)   •   ESRB: T(een)
Strategy First/Tiny Rebel Games   •   www.strategyfirst.com/FlatOut/#
There isn’t a lot of competition in the subgenre of combat racing, so 
you know that when a well-known franchise like FlatOut launches a 
new installment, there’s bound to be an eager fan base ready to accept 
it with open arms. Having played the game, however, that fan base 
instead should be throwing up those arms. 
We can’t fault FlatOut 4: Total Insanity for its stable of cars that only 
vaguely look like cars you’d recognize, a soundtrack full of ear-splitting 
indie garage punk, or for the “dozen NPCs” that really consist of two 
character models wearing six different kinds of face paint. At $39.99, 
we don’t expect FlatOut 4 to have the music and car-licensing deals of 
a Forza game or a small army of artists churning out assets. 
As a blend of destruction derby and racing, your primary goal is to 
win, either by being the fastest or by slamming your faster opponents 
out of the way. There are 20 tracks to race through in a decent mix of 
climates and environments. Alternative game modes include time trials, 
destruction derby arenas, assault races (think Mario Kart-style combat), 
and a bizarre series of mini games in which you eject the driver into the 
air and earn points. 
When you start the game, you only have enough cash to buy one of the 
two starter cars in the Derby class. There are also Classic and Allstar 
classes, and each has a series of unique races and exclusive cars. There 
are 27 cars in total, but the “design it once and paint it a different color” 
philosophy also applies here. The Cookie, Derby Cookie, and Cookie 
Offroad, for instance, are all the same elongated VW Beetle look-alike. 
The pickup truck model was mixed and matched with a snow plow, open 
bed, tow truck bed, topper, and a handful of other accessories to form the 
Snow Bane RX, Snow Quarterback, Yoozfool Ice Breaker, and Yoozfool Toe 
Truck. By our count, there are closer to 10 unique car models. 
For whatever reason, the majority of the cars tended to oversteer to the 
point of spinning out. The cars also feel extremely heavy, which might 
be a good thing in a car combat game, except that hurtling into fellow 
racers is just as likely to throw you into the weeds as it is to give you an 
advantage. We lost several races because our car was “destroyed,” but 
we never once witnessed an NPC-driven car get similarly disqualified. 
Despite the mix of terrain, it seems like the cars grip the same whether 
they’re on concrete, dirt, or snow. Even with a fully-upgraded car, you 
won’t be drifting around corners in this game.
Like everything else, the tracks are locked behind a progress wall. Although 
they look gorgeous and offer a good mix of off-road and tarmac sections, 
several of them are poorly designed. A few tracks have at least one 
insidious invisible bump that’ll send your car spinning out of control. Having 
a lead foot is also punished anytime you catch air and land without letting 
off the gas and steering wheel. Some bits of debris let you clip right through 
them, while others will kill your momentum or toss you out of bounds. 
We love a good arcade-style racer, but what we don’t love is the 
unpredictable physics and brick-like car handling. If you want to upgrade 
your car, prepare to race the same event again and again to earn money. 
If you want a new car, prepare to grind, hard. A game with FlatOut’s 
pedigree should be fun, but FlatOut 4: Total Insanity just made us want to 
throw the controller. ■

We Are Your 
Diablo-Style Overlords
BY CHRIS TRUMBLE
$39.99 (PC), $59.99 (XOne, PS4)   •   ESRB: (M)ature
Kalypso Media   •   www.kalypsomedia.com/en
Developer Games Farm has been making isometric action-RPGs for 
some years in the form of its Heretic Kingdoms titles, which borrow 
heavily from Diablo in terms of their interface, mechanics, and so on. 
For its latest release, Vikings: Wolves of Midgard, the Games Farm team 
has shifted its focus from traditional fantasy to Norse mythology, and 
the result is a pleasing if mindless hack-and-slash game set in cool 
environments that tosses in a novel game mechanic or two.
Vikings is available on the big three current platforms: PC, Xbox One, 
and PlayStation 4. I played it on PC, where it is playable with mouse 
and keyboard or with a control pad; playing on the PC will also save 
you a cool $20, as the game retails for $59.99 on consoles. I tried 
both control sets, and while both are serviceable, I preferred the game 
pad as the game leans heavily on your character’s roll mechanic to 
avoid damage in combat. In encounters with multiple enemies (which 
accounts for the majority of the fights), using the left stick to run and 
the right stick to roll works pretty well, and the game maps the abilities 
you acquire as you level up to a few buttons that are by and large 
pretty easy to manage.
At the outset of the game, you’ll find a pretty limited selection of 
character customization options; you choose your Viking’s gender, hair 
style, tattoos, and the like from a short list of options, and then you pick 
a class in the form of allegiance to a particular Norse god. Each god 
grants followers a number of “gifts,” which are the abilities you’ll use 
in combat when you want to move beyond mashing the attack button, 
and each god’s gifts are based on a particular style of combat. If you 
choose Thor, for instance, you’ll want to stick to large, two-handed 
axes, hammers, and swords. Choose the goddess Skathi if you want to 
play with a bow, Loki if you want to dual-wield smaller weapons, Odin 
if you favor a staff, and so on.
In the game, the Norse legend of Ragnarok, the war that ends all nine 
worlds, has begun. The Jotan and other foes are vying with the gods of 
Asgard for supremacy, and the humans of Midgard (Earth) are caught in 
the crossfire. After a brief introduction and some training-wheels combat, 
you’ll become the Chieftain of Ulfang Village, which has been destroyed 
and is in dire need of some leadership. As leader, you will work to rebuild 
your village and protect it by battling first with nearby clans that threaten, 
and with greater foes as the game progresses. In between missions, you 
can visit Ulfang’s various tradespeople to sell or dismantle the gear that 
piles up in your bags as you fight, and to craft new items.
Missions largely consist of hacking your way through a sprawling level 
and picking up collectibles in the process, then arriving at a final arena 
at the end of the level and heading in for a boss fight. The boss fights 
are challenging but not brutally hard on normal difficulty, and each 
has its own unique fight mechanics that you’ll need to figure out and 
counter to survive.
Along the way, you’ll collect the blood of your fallen foes to sacrifice 
to your god of choice—this is how you level up—and you’ll find 
and win cool gear to upgrade both your character’s look and 
combat effectiveness.
Games Farm and publisher Kalypso Media didn’t reinvent the wheel 
here by any means, but the bugs that plagued the PC version’s early 
days have seemingly been mostly ironed out, and thanks to some really 
nice visuals and fun combat, I enjoyed my time with the game. There’s 
a two-player co-op mode if that’s how you roll, and nice touches like 
quasi-destructible environments (you can knock structures down on/out 
from under your foes and damage them) and the need to avoid freezing 
to death in parts of some levels help keep the formula fresh. ■

them “create user habits that stick.” His Hook Model illustrates steps he discovered are common among products that do so. In 
particular, Eyal sees great potential in creating habit-forming behaviors in products that can positively impact users while also helping 
users avoid the downsides of “digital distraction.” We spoke with Eyal about how products can form habit-forming behaviors, the

put them in this little box that we know 
today as the Skinner Box, and he gave them 
a reward. A little food pellet every time they 
would peck at a disk. At first, he would do 
that on a predictable schedule. If the pigeon 
pecked on a disk, it would get a food pellet. 
So he could train these pigeons to peck at 
the disk whenever they were hungry. 
But then Skinner did something a little 
bit different. He added a variable reward. 
Sometimes, the pigeon would peck at the 
disk and nothing would come out. No 
food pellet. The next time the pigeon 
pecked at the disk, it would receive a 
reward. What Skinner observed was that 
the rate of response, or the number of 
times these pigeons pecked at the disk, 
increased when a reward was given on a 
variable schedule of reinforcement. Now, 
we see this in all sorts of products and 
services both online and offline. When 
we think of anything that has a bit of 
mystery, a bit of anticipation, a bit of 
uncertainty, this is what brings people 
back time and time again. Scrolling 
through your News Feed. Watching a 
sports game. Getting back on Slack to 
figure out what the latest update was to 
the project you’re working on. All of these 
things utilize an element of uncertainty 
and variability. That’s something we find 
highly engaging and habit-forming. 
Finally, the last step of the Hook is the 
investment phase. The investment phase is 
all about getting people to put something 
into the product in anticipation of a future 
benefit, and this is a really big deal. Product 
are examples of these internal triggers and 
how we attach products to some of these 
uncomfortable emotional states. 
It’s very important to realize that there’s 
only one reason why we use any product 
or service: The purpose of products is to 
modulate mood. That’s it. When you look 
at the fundamental truth of why we use 
stuff, it’s only to change how we feel. And 
you can be very technologically savvy and 
build amazing solutions, but if you don’t 
understand what itch you’re scratching 
psychologically for the user, there’s a very 
high chance your product will fail. That’s 
all about the trigger phase. 
The next step of the Hook Model is 
the action phase. The action phase is all 
about constructing an action that’s as 
simple as possible to get the reward. To 
scratch the user’s itch. So scrolling on 
Pinterest, searching on Google, pushing 
the Play button on YouTube. That’s an 
incredibly tiny action, but it provides an 
immediate reward. That’s a little bit about 
the action phase, but there’s much more. 
Then comes the reward. The reward 
phase is where the user gets what he came 
for, but a common misconception is that 
people think, “Well, if I just give the 
people what they want, that’s enough.” But 
it’s not. It turns out that to form a habit, 
the products from these world-changing 
companies like Facebook, Instagram, and 
the others, they don’t just provide a reward, 
they use what’s called a “variable reward.” 
This comes out of the classic work of B.F. 
Skinner. Skinner took these pigeons and 
Every hook starts with a trigger, which 
is something that tells the user what to do 
next. There are two types of triggers. One 
is external triggers that give the user some 
piece of information on what to do. For 
instance, Click Here. Buy Now. Play This. 
Things like that that give the user some 
piece of information. We in the design 
community, the engineer community, we 
know all about this call to action. We 
know all about these external triggers, but 
what I found people don’t think about 
enough is the second type of trigger, 
which is the internal trigger. 
The internal trigger is something that 
tells the user what to do next but where 
the information for what to do is stored 
as a memory inside the user’s head. The 
ultimate goal of a habit-forming product 
is to attach itself to an internal trigger so 
that an external trigger is eventually no 
longer required. If you think about it, 
you almost never see an ad for Facebook 
or for Slack or Instagram or Snapchat 
because the ultimate goal of these 
products is for you to trigger yourself to 
action. That’s where the power of forming 
a habit is such that once you create an 
association with an internal trigger, you

building healthy habits or breaking 
unhealthy habits—is to understand how 
these habits work in the first place. And 
that’s what the Hook Model is for. 
Q
: You’re an advocate of using 
“attention-retention tools,” or 
technologies that curb the triggers 
products use to hook users. What are 
some examples of attention-retention 
tools and how they benefit users? 
NE
: This is a natural progression of 
what technologies do. We have 
a technology. We adopt it wholesale. 
We think it’s awesome, and then a little 
while later, we say, “Wait a minute, there 
are actually a lot of bad sides, too.” If 
you think of the miracle of personal 
transport, a little more than a hundred 
years ago society had access to cars, and 
they changed the world. Of course, they 
also create pollution and accidents and 
all sorts of bad things come from this 
cool technology. So what do we do? Well, 
we build new technologies to fix the 
problems of the last generation. 
There are tons of tools available today 
that individuals who care enough to do 
something about this problem can use to 
protect their attentional faculties, and the 
way they do that is by using these tools I call 
attention-retention devices. One example: 
In my house during the weeknights, I have a 
timer connected to my router. Every night at 
10 p.m., my internet shuts off. I could clearly 
unplug my router from the timer and get 
back online, but it gives me that moment to 
think. That moment of mindfulness so that 
I don’t keep surfing the web and can stop 
and ask myself, “Is this really important? Do 
I really need to be doing this now, or is sleep 
more important to me?” 
I think those people who can master 
their attention, master their focus, this 
is going to be the competitive edge of the 
foreseeable future. It’s not so much access to 
information. We’re drowning in information. 
The rare commodity that differentiates who 
can do really great work in the years to come 
is going to be who can master their attention. 
I think these attention-retention tools will be 
a big part of that. ■
And the investment is that every time I 
friend someone, like something, comment, 
post, any time I do that I’m storing value 
in the product. I’m co-creating a product 
with Facebook so if you were to log in to 
my Facebook account, it would be boring 
to you because it’s been customized based 
on the data I invested in the platform. So 
Facebook has a very, very good hook, and 
it’s a great explanation for why Facebook is 
now touching almost 2 billion people.  
Q
: You’re in a unique position where 
you’ve written a book that informs 
companies how to hook users, but you 
also offer users advice about how to not 
let their habits and behaviors get out of 
control. Is that accurate, and if so, how 
do you balance those positions? 
NE
: The problem isn’t that Facebook, 
Instagram, Slack, and these 
other companies know how to use these 
techniques. The problem is there are far too 
many companies that don’t know how to 
use these techniques. Companies that could 
really benefit us. When you think of the 
state-of-the-art when it comes to interacting 
with local business or government services 
or starting healthy habits like eating better 
or keeping in touch with loved ones, so 
many products out there have the best 
intentions, but they just suck. They’re 
not designed well. People don’t use the 
product because they don’t have these hooks 
embedded. That’s why I wrote this book. I 
wrote this book for the designers out there, 
the engineers, the entrepreneurs who want 
to help people build healthy habits but for 
lack of good design, their products aren’t 
changing behavior. That’s the first reason I 
wrote the book. 
The second reason I wrote the book 
is that the only way we can control 
these bad habits, or control how we use 
technologies, is to understand how they 
hook us—understand fundamentally 
what’s behind our behavior. So it’s very 
intentional that I’m just as much an 
advocate for building healthy habits in 
our lives as I am for breaking unhealthy 
habits that we don’t want. But the source 
or root for doing either of those things—
designers and developers don’t think about 
this enough. The beauty and promise 
of interactive technologies is that the user 
can make the product for himself. So the 
investment phase is really about getting 
people to put data, add content, accrue 
followers, or perform some other learned 
skill or reputation on the platform. They 
make the product better and better with use 
so that over time, it appreciates with value. It 
gets better and better with use, and therefore 
becomes harder and harder to leave. 
Now, the other thing that investments 
do is load the next trigger. They bring you 
back on your own. For example, when I 
send someone a message on Slack, there’s no 
immediate gratification. What I’m getting 
is that I’m investing in a platform in order 
to get a reply. When that reply comes back, 
it comes back in the form of an external 
trigger that prompts me through the hook 
once again. That notification telling me that 
someone has replied is the external trigger 
for the next cycle through the Hook. And 
through these successive cycles, habits are 
formed, and eventually I won’t even need 
those external triggers. Now, I’m using the 
products purely when I’m prompted with 
my internal triggers, those emotions, to use 
the product again and again and again, and 
a habit is formed. 
Q
: You’ve described Facebook as one of 
the most habit-forming products of 
all time. What traits and characteristics 
have you found that habit-forming 
technologies such as Facebook share?
NE
: Facebook has an excellent hook. 
The hook is very clear. The external 
trigger is the notification. The internal 
trigger is feeling boredom or loneliness or 
seeking a connection—something people 
experience very frequently throughout their 
day. The action is to just open the app and 
scroll the feed. Very, very easy. As soon as 
we start scrolling the feed we get rewarded 
with all these things we see in our News 
Feed. What videos did people post? What 
did the comments say? How many likes did 
something get? A high degree of variability 
when it comes to checking our News Feed. 
That’s, of course, the variable reward phase.

Q&A With ENERMAX’s Ko-Min Kevin Tseng, Ph.D.
Global Head Of Sales & Marketing 
On The Company’s 27th Birthday
such as chassis, coolers, and fans; LEPA is 
a rising star creating fun and innovative 
computer DIY and consumer electronics 
products. ENERMAX focuses on developing 
advanced technology to bring consumers 
more convenient and efficient products. 
Take the REVOLUTION DUO PSU, for 
example: The dual-fan design is perfect for 
computer chassis with PSU shrouds and 
the patented FMA (Fan-speed Manual 
Adjustment) technology allows users to 
increase the system airflow manually.
LEPA always wants to offer entertaining 
and state-of-the-art products. For example, 
the NEOllusion CPU cooler provides 
15 colors and various lighting effects that 
builders can use to customize their builds, 
and the Q-Boom Bluetooth speaker with 
selfie remote shutter function makes it easy to 
snap photos on your devices.
Q
: How would you say the computer 
hardware market has changed the 
of them have been granted significant awards 
such as the 2009 Red Dot design award, 
the 2010 iF product design award (for the 
Revolution85+ power supply), the 2015 
Computex d&i award, and the 2017 German 
Design Award for our Digifanless PSU. 
ENERMAX is also an ODM (original 
design manufacturer) PSU provider. Back 
in 2010 when LEPA was established, 
it launched a PSU that was an ODM 
model by ENERMAX that quickly 
received the Dream Machine Award 2013 
from Maximum PC magazine; that PSU 
is the G1600, which has 80 PLUS Gold 
certification and is the only 18cm-deep 
chassis that performs at 1,600W.
Q
: How are ENERMAX and LEPA 
products different? Does each brand 
have a particular specialty or strength?
KT
: ENERMAX is a sophisticated PSU 
designer and maker of peripherals 
Q
: First off, congratulations on your 
company reaching 27 years in the 
computer hardware industry! What was 
ENERMAX’s first product, way back in 
1990, and how did the company start?
KT
: As some of you may know, 
we started as a power supply 
manufacturer. The first product we launched 
27 years ago was the AT switching power 
supply with 200W. Unlike the present 
power supply units with premium coating 
or decent silk-print on the housing, PSUs 
were bare metal and quite unappealing back 
then. At the time, lots of people considered 
a power supply one of the least important 
components in the system. However, Steven 
Su, the founder and CEO of our company, 
and his business partners anticipated that if 
the IT industry kept developing, there would 
be a need for stable and reliable PC power 
supplies for advanced systems. 
Prior to the establishment of the 
company, our founders served in executive 
positions in the IT industry. They have 
been well acquainted with the demands 
of ambitious PC hardware enthusiasts as 
customers and took the opportunity offered 
by the lack of quality, high-performance, 
and durable PC components at that time. 
Within a very short period of time, the 
ENERMAX brand became more and more 
popular around the world.
Q
: How long have ENERMAX and 
LEPA been associated, and how did 
their association begin?
KT
: ENERMAX is a world-renowned 
PC power supply unit manufacturer 
and designer, and our PSUs have been 
recommended by worldwide reviewers. Some 
86 May2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

and Platinum-rated lineups in early Q3 
this year. 
Furthermore, dimensions matter! Current 
high-efficiency 1,000W-plus PSUs on the 
market are generally large, many measuring 
18cm to 22.5cm in depth. The larger 
dimensions necessitate a PC case with a lot 
of interior space, and this decreases a builder’s 
freedom in selecting a chassis. To respond to 
the voice of the market, we’ll be releasing a 
fully modular, Platinum-rated 1,200W PSU 
with a depth of only 16cm to give enthusiasts 
greater flexibility in case selection. 
Last but not least, user-friendly designs 
are always what builders look for. After 
the launch of the D.F.R. technology, 
which makes the fan spin in reverse for 
10 seconds upon startup to blow away the 
dust and prevent buildup, we have received 
feedback from our customers who wanted 
an option to activate D.F.R. at any time 
during the unit’s operation. Users told us 
that they seldom turn off their computers, 
and since the current D.F.R. function is 
only activated at startup, they couldn’t fully 
enjoy its benefits. Consequently, we’ve 
created the D.F. switch for users to activate 
the D.F.R. at any time during the PSU’s 
operation. The D.F. switch is placed near 
the PSU’s on/off switch, and the switch 
will be implemented in our new Titanium 
and Platinum PSU lines.
Q
: We noticed on your site that ENER-
MAX is giving away some prizes 
as part of the birthday celebration in 
conjunction with Amazon and Newegg. 
Can you talk about what readers need to 
do to be eligible for the giveaways?
KT
: Yes of course! It’s actually pretty 
simple! From now until May 
31, all you have to do is leave a review 
on Amazon or Newegg of your recent 
ENERMAX or LEPA purchase during 
this year, and you can not only get a free 
ENERMAX sporty earphone (MSRP 
$19.99) but also a chance to win grand 
prizes, including power supplies, cases, 
coolers, graphics cards, memory, and 
more thanks to our friends at PNY and 
ADATA! You can visit the event site at 
www.enermaxusa.com/enermax27. ■
Q
: As CPUs and GPUs become more 
efficient, PSUs have followed suit, and 
there seem to be a lot of enthusiast-grade 
sub-1,000W PSUs today. Do you expect 
that trend to continue?
KT
: Yes, we expect so. We provide 
PSUs in the wattage range from 
300W to 1,700W to meet different 
application needs. Kilowatt PSUs occupy 
a very niche segment. ENERMAX PSUs, 
especially 1,200W to 1,600W units, are 
frequently adopted to power professional 
workstations for fluid dynamics, medical 
research, financial modeling, real-time 
graphics, 3D rendering, and heavy-duty 
ray tracing applications. So we believe 
there will be continuing demand for 
kilowatt power solutions. 
On the other hand, some users don’t 
really know how much wattage they may 
need. That’s why ENERMAX offers a 
Power Supply Calculator at www.enermax
.outervision.com to help them get an 
estimate on how much wattage they may 
need, and to help users select a suitable PSU 
for their systems. 
Q
: ENERMAX has power supplies 
with lots of interesting innovations 
built into them, including dual-fan units, 
D.F.R. (Dust Free Rotation) technology, 
fanless PSUs, and so on. Can you give us 
any hints as to what the next big thing 
will be in the power supply market?
KT
: Much like our hearts pump oxy-
genated blood to the rest of our 
bodies, a PC’s PSU converts alternating 
current (AC) into direct current (DC) 
and delivers the DC to the rest of 
the computer, including the CPU, 
motherboard, RAM, SSD/HDD, and so 
on. So I believe most people would agree 
that a strong, stable, highly efficient power 
supply is the heart of a strong, stable, and 
highly efficient PC. 
In the near future, therefore, we expect 
to see more high-efficiency PSUs available 
in the market, such as 80 PLUS Titanium-
rated PSUs (currently the highest efficiency 
level) and 80 PLUS Platinum-rated units. 
We will be launching our new Titanium 
most since ENERMAX began making 
computer components?
KT
: Over two decades, PC DIY users 
have gained more experience in 
building their own PCs. More online 
resources, such as tech review sites, are 
available, which has helped enhance 
users’ knowledge in selecting suitable 
PC components. 
In addition to functionality and stability, 
nowadays product appearance has played a 
more important role in PC DIY. Lots of PC 
DIYers look for components with unique 
design to express their own personality and 
style. That’s why we are seeing more and more 
PC chassis featuring ample, panoramic glass 
panels to allow users to showcase their rigs. 
Q
: On the other hand, what has been 
the biggest change in ENERMAX 
during that same time span?
KT
: In 2011, we entered a brand-new 
product category—CPU coolers. 
With the same focus on innovation and 
reliability that has created numerous 
award-winning products, we launched our 
first CPU air cooler, the ETS-T40 series. 
The thermal resistance value reached an 
unmatched 0.09°C/W; the outstanding 
performance was based on the integration 
of several innovative cooling technologies: 
VGF (Vortex Generator Flow), VEF 
(Vacuum Effect Flow), and SEF (Stack 
Effect Flow). In 2012, we launched our 
first AIO CPU liquid coolers, the ELC 
series, which came with a 120mm or 
240mm radiator. Thanks to the patented 
Shunt Channel cold plate technology, the 
ELC series achieved a better flow rate and 
ensured great heat dissipation, which made 
the liquid cooler an excellent choice for 
overclocking. In 2015, ENERMAX won 
the European Hardware Award for the 
LIQMAX II 240 AIO CPU water cooler. 
Over the past six years, our innovations 
and patented cooling technologies have 
continuously defined new standards for the 
market. Power supplies have been and will 
still be our core business, but I would say 
CPU coolers will become more and more 
important in our business.
